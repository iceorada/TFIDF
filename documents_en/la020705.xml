<LD>THE PERFECT STORE</LD>
<LD>   Inside EBay</LD>
<LD>   by Adam Cohen</LD>
<TE>   Little, Brown</TE>
<TE>   332 pages, $25.95</TE>
<TE>   Over Labor Day weekend in 1995, a 28-year-old computer programmer
named Pierre Omidyar launched a Web site called AuctionWeb from a
spare bedroom in his Silicon Valley home. It was badly designed,
difficult to navigate and didn't receive many hits, but because the
site was just a hobby for Omidyar, he didn't mind that people seemed
wary of participating in online auctions.</TE>
<TE>   That hobby evolved into EBay, a Web site that receives, seven
years later, more than a million visitors each day, bidding on
everything from garage junk to celebrity autographs, toy
collectibles, fine art and cars. Adam Cohen, a journalist and
co-author of "American Pharaoh," a biography of Chicago Mayor Richard
J. Daley, has delved into the making of this wildly successful
company and the passionate following it has inspired in "The Perfect
Store."</TE>
<TE>   Cohen explains his interest in writing a book about EBay, calling
it "easily the most interesting story of the early Internet age, and
one of the most important business stories of our time." Just as
impressive as EBay's financial success, Cohen argues, is its
idealistic mission: to operate as "a perfect marketplace" where all
buyers are given an equal opportunity at purchasing power and where
they can find a true sense of community. Omidyar "wanted it to
operate according to the moral values he ascribed to his own life ...
[and] introduced innovations that would make his site in many ways
the most genuine community in cyberspace."</TE>
<TE>   Word-of-mouth publicity about AuctionWeb caused traffic to
increase soon after its launch, and back then, transactions ran
smoothly. "Trust on the site was so high in the early days," Cohen
writes, "and the feeling of community so strong, that it was common
for sellers to ship items even before they had received bidders'
payments." To deal with the problem of deception in sales, Omidyar
created a Feedback Forum on the site, so that buyers could rate their
sellers.</TE>
<TE>   That step, which seems so logical and commonplace now, was
revolutionary back then. Having a "bulletin board" on the site is
partly what made users feel so involved. Unlike most Web sites, this
one had more to offer than simply clicking on an icon and making a
purchase. It was a place to spend time, to meet others with similar
collecting interests such as dolls or antiques, and to buy what you
wanted at whatever price you wanted to pay.</TE>
<TE>   The site was not without its flaws, including an unremarkable
domain name and a tendency to crash regularly. But after several
overhauls, the site became more sophisticated and better equipped to
handle its heavy traffic, and was given the catchier name of EBay,
along with a bright, friendly logo.</TE>
<TE>   Like Amazon.com, EBay had millions of happy, devoted customers.
Unlike Amazon, EBay has been hugely profitable from the start. It is
not only a survivor of the Internet boom and crash, but there is no
end in sight to its success.</TE>
<TE>   Reading Cohen's account of the disorganized, overwhelming early
days at the company--the small, underpaid staffers had to build their
own desks and make policies up as they went along--it's astonishing
to think about EBay's evolution and how it has shaped online
commerce.</TE>
<TE>   Today EBay is run by co-founder Jeff Skoll and CEO Meg Whitman,
and it's a vastly different environment than the one run by Omidyar,
who lives in Paris and is a happily married billionaire. The
company's innocent and idealistic beginning is now a faint memory;
what once had the feel of a beloved, quirky neighborhood shop is now
a powerhouse, multibillion-dollar corporation, with an emphasis on
continued profitability and brand expansion. Initially, EBay
consisted mostly of sellers seeing what they could get for a Beanie
Baby collection or an old dresser; today, sellers are far more
polished and professional, and many have even given up their day jobs
to make a full-time living on EBay sales.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout "The Perfect Store," Cohen's tone is so earnest and
uncritical that he fails to investigate any contradictions or
possibly troubling aspects. What about the morbid and pornographic
items that come up for sale? And what about the con men who are also
part of the EBay "community"? Cohen mentions them but doesn't go
beyond that. As for EBay's detractors, they are dutifully given space
in the book, but not much of a voice.</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say that EBay isn't a great company with good values
and admirable success; it's just that there must be more to this
"perfect store" than this supposedly insider account offers.
Considering that Cohen was given an employee ID and allowed to move
into EBay's headquarters to write this book, the lack of surprising
information is disappointing. Cohen does offer some colorful stories
about some of EBay's more eccentric users, but these too are told in
a straightforward way, without irony or wit.</TE>
<TE>   "The Perfect Store" would be a more compelling story without
overuse of the word "empowering" to describe EBay's effect, and
without repeatedly praising the so-called purity of Omidyar's vision.
Too many passages read like marketing material: "That transformation
power is the most remarkable aspect of the eBay story," Cohen gushes.
And he offers the dubious assertion that "EBay is the rare company
that was created with the express intention of advancing the public
good." Cynicism has no place in charting the rise of this impressive
company, but a bit more skepticism would not have hurt.</TE>

<LD>Meet Guy Gilchrist</LD>
<LD>   Hi. My name is Guy Gilchrist. I'm a cartoonist and the creator of
comic strips like "Mudpie" and "Nancy." I'm also a member of the
National Cartoonists Society, the world's largest organization of
professional cartoonists. Did you know that members of this
organization create many of the cartoons you see in newspapers and
other publications? These cartoonists believe very strongly in the
values of education and reading in particular. That's why, from time
to time, some of us will be creating special cartoons on this page
just for you, as I have here.</LD>
<LD>   My "Mudpie" cartoon invites you to spend some time with a book. My
favorite author? Why, it's Samuel Clemens, also known as Mark Twain.
He lived in Hartford, Conn., very close to my home. Why don't you
find a book by your favorite author and start reading it today?
You'll be in good company.</LD>

<HD>Buying Glory Is Nothing New</HD>
<DH>Experts say the urge to purchase patriotically began before
Sept. 11</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH LARGE</AU>
<BD>BALTIMORE SUN</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walk through any mall and you still see them: the flag T-shirts, the
patriotic picnic ware, the USA-emblazoned tongue rings. In post-Sept.
11 America, there are enough bright-starred, broad-striped products
to stretch from sea to shining sea.</LD>
<LD>   But if you're tired of seeing Old Glory used as a marketing
tool--or stuck on people's backsides or dangling from key rings--take
heart. Although the stores are filled with red, white and blue for
the Fourth of July holiday, the public's interest in outward signs of
patriotism may be waning--being replaced, perhaps, by a more enduring
interest in things American.</LD>
<LD>   "I have a 'flag-o-meter,' and I'm seeing a lot fewer these days,"
says Tom Holliday, president of the Washington-based Retail
Advertising and Marketing Assn. "I've been seeing a lot of patriotic
merchandise marked down." The flag decal in the back of Holliday's
car is beginning to curl because of the sunlight, he says, and he
won't replace it. "But that's not because I'm feeling any less
patriotic."</LD>
<TE>   Interestingly enough, there's been no real effort to "buy
American" since Sept. 11, in spite of people's newfound patriotism.
"We realize globalization is here to stay," says Cary Silvers, vice
president of Roper Reports, a New York-based consumer trend service.
If nothing else, it's hard to buy American. The four-poster bed
you've fallen in love with may be made in North Carolina, but the
bedposts came from South America.</TE>
<TE>   So what about all the fashion and furniture with American themes
we've been seeing in the last nine months? What about the meatloaf
and garlic mashed potatoes that can now be found on hip restaurant
menus?</TE>
<TE>   Many things can be attributed to the terrorist attacks, but
probably not these. Take the retro American dishes that have become
so trendy. While some argue that Americans turned to comfort food in
response to war and terrorism, its popularity really took off in the
'90s. In a survey conducted for Advertising Age, published in March,
84% of respondents said their buying patterns for food have remained
the same since Sept. 11, while 77% reported eating the same amount of
comfort food as before.</TE>
<TE>   The events of Sept. 11 seem to have simply accelerated a trend
toward Americana in home, fashion and food that was already on a
roll. Even the enormous amount of patriotic material we're seeing in
the stores now may only partly be a response to Sept. 11. After all,
Americans have been decorating their homes more and more for the
holidays in the last few years.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lot of Americana out there pre-9/11," says Diane
Daly, director of fashion and communications at Hecht's, pointing out
that popular designers such as Tommy Hilfiger and Ralph Lauren have
always specialized in it. Flag-inspired beaded evening bags were in
stores before the tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it all comes down to a different definition of patriotism
than the experts first thought. Silvers believes that one of the most
lasting lifestyle changes since the Sept. 11 attacks may be that
patriotism is making us examine our roots. A recent Roper survey
showed that more people are traveling within the United States this
summer for safety reasons, but Silvers believes Americans are also
newly interested in visiting historic sites. "When you tell the rest
of the world you're proud to be an American," he says, "you have to
know what you stand for."</TE>

<HD>Skirts Over Jeans: Not Easy to Pull Off</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEANNINE STEIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dear Fashion Police: I've been seeing a new trend lately that I think
is really fun, but I'm not sure how to pull it off--the
skirt-over-jeans look. While many may find it silly--and I have seen
some variations that do look silly--I think it's a fun trend! Can you
help with suggestions on how to wear it, and tell me if a certain
style of jeans works better than others?</LD>
<LD>   --WILLING TO TRY</LD>
<LD>   Dear Willing: We have to admit that this Bohemian wannabe look
that took off last spring is not one of our favorites. Though we
appreciate cutting-edge design and fashion experimentation, this one,
which paired short, flouncy skirts with pants, had us scratching our
head. The overall effect was utter confusion followed by a bad
compromise, as if the wearer couldn't make up her mind between the
two outfits, so she wore both.</LD>
<TE>   That said, if you still insist on indulging in this trend, there
are some do's and don'ts. First, we hope you have an innate fashion
sense, because this isn't the easiest thing to pull off successfully.</TE>
<TE>   Second, choose slim-fitting jeans or pants, not baggy ones that
are going to make you look sloppy once you start layering. Third,
don't pile up too much on top, i.e. camisole, blouse, sweater, etc.
Keep it simple to avoid looking like you took the entire contents of
your closet out for a spin.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth, we strongly suggest that to make a go of this trend you
incorporate the most up-to-date interpretations. Fall is around the
corner, and designers are already morphing the look into something
more sophisticated. Instead of skirts, they're opting for tunics over
pants, which, when belted, give the effect of a layer without
actually adding a skirt. Chloe, for instance, combines cropped skinny
pants with a filmy knit tunic top belted with a wide sash. Narciso
Rodriguez also starts with slim cropped pants and adds a sleeveless,
geometric fitted tunic that stops mid-thigh.</TE>
<TE>   If these designer pieces are too pricey, we're sure you'll have no
problems improvising. Explore your wardrobe for pieces that might
work before you start spending big bucks. Check out fashion magazines
for ideas, then take it from there.</TE>
<TE>   Dear Fashion Police: My husband wears Bermuda shorts every day if
possible. I've purchased corduroy as well as silk shorts for his
wardrobe. He asked me how to make his shorts more dressy by changing
his shoes. Currently he wears tennis shoes but would be open to
wearing leather shoes. How do you "dress up" someone in a nice silk
shirt and nice silk shorts?</TE>
<TE>   --SHORT ON IDEAS</TE>
<TE>   Dear Short: A dressy shorts outfit is something of an oxymoron,
like jumbo shrimp or plastic glasses. We've advised other readers on
this issue in the past, including a woman who wanted to know if she
could wear a pair of tailored wide-leg shorts with pantyhose to the
office. In a word: ick.</TE>
<TE>   Shorts are casual wear, and there's just so much you can do to
dress them up. We wouldn't recommend, for instance, that he pair silk
shorts and a silk shirt with wing tips or cap-toe oxfords, unless he
wants to be carted off to fashion jail. That Ralph Lauren-esque look
of wearing shorts with blazers and sockless penny loafers will only
work if your husband's name is Biff and he has a summer home in the
Hamptons.</TE>
<TE>   About the dressiest we would go footwear-wise would be fisherman
sandals, which come in leather and offer more coverage than, say,
flip-flops. And in case you were wondering--no socks. We found two
suitable styles at Nordstrom's online shopping site; the Tommy Bahama
San Gianni sandal for $145 and the Cole Haan Cortona sandal for $140.
For more information visit www.Nordstrom.com, or call (888) 282-6060.</TE>
<TE>   Your husband might also consider wearing a straw hat with his
ensemble to dress it up. Something like a straw fedora or Panama hat
with a tight weave will not only add a dash of panache but will also
protect his face from those evil sun rays. Various styles of hats in
a range of prices can be found at the Proper Topper,
www.propertopper.com, or call (888) 842-3055.</TE>

<LD>Glory and Quentin took the big, white tablecloth to Mama so she could
sew red stripes onto it. Then they hurried around the park, looking
for something blue.</LD>
<LD>   Glory didn't see the right shade of blue anywhere, until she
returned to Mama's table. There it was. The skirt for her costume.
Exactly the right blue. And the white shirt could be cut into stars.</LD>
<LD>   Without a costume, she certainly couldn't lead the parade. Not in
her yellow-flowered skirt. But it wouldn't be a Fourth of July parade
without a big flag to snap in the breeze. Somebody else could carry
the flag.</LD>
<TE>   "Mama," Glory said, "cut up my costume for the rest of the flag."</TE>
<TE>   The parade didn't start on time. Everybody wanted to wait until
the new flag was finished. A dozen people came to sew on stripes and
cut the white stars from Glory's costume shirt. They tacked the stars
to the blue cloth from her skirt.</TE>
<TE>   Quentin glued down some missed stitches with his spearmint gum.</TE>
<TE>   "Now the parade can start," Mayor Bassett boomed. "Glory
Halliburton, take the flag and lead us off."</TE>
<TE>   "I can't," Glory said sadly. "I don't have a costume anymore."</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't matter what you wear," Mayor Bassett said. "What
matters is that you care."</TE>
<TE>   Glory took the flagpole. It was heavy, but she held it high as she
led the parade.</TE>
<TE>   Behind her was Sugar McCrary, looking a little grumpy. But she
held her torch high.</TE>
<TE>   The Turkey Creek School Band played. The Singing Mothers sang.
Above them all, Glory heard Quentin's voice. "Mine eyes have seen the
Glory," he sang. "Glory, Glory Halliburton."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't her day after all, Glory realized. It belonged to
everybody who cared about the Fourth of July.</TE>
<TE>   And the new town flag would remind everyone for years to come just
how much they cared.</TE>
<TE>   Lael Littke once got to ride her horse and carry a flag in the
Fourth of July parade in her hometown of Mink Creek, Idaho. This

<LD>When Austrian artist Gottfried Helnwein opened a show of his
paintings recently, celebrities crowded a downtown gallery. Leonardo
DiCaprio rubbed elbows with Marilyn Manson. Beck chatted with Kevin
Smith. Mena Suvari stopped for a photo op, and Sean Penn lent his
cool. For a recent transplant, Helnwein attracted much Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   Beyond the paintings, actor Jason Lee was the reason for the high
celebrity quotient.</LD>
<LD>   Lee recently created the Jason Lee Foundation for the Arts to
support contemporary artists through grants and exhibitions. This was
the foundation's first opening in its new 3,000-square-foot downtown
space, and Lee had pulled Hollywood strings to amp up the star
wattage.</LD>
<TE>   "You can use Hollywood to your advantage," he said recently in his
photography studio. At the opening, he said, guests had expected a
typical industry schmooze party but had been drawn in by the
art--haunting large-scale works, some of stillborn children. "They
were enthralled by the work," he said. "It was a quiet, strange
exhibit."</TE>
<TE>   If people come for the celebrities but end up looking at the art,
he has achieved his goal, he said.</TE>
<TE>   For Helnwein, the mix of music, Hollywood and artists had served
another purpose--generating more work.</TE>
<TE>   He and Manson had agreed to do a project together, and Smith had
commissioned him to do a large scale painting of his son. Helnwein
couldn't wait to meet Dennis Hopper.</TE>
<TE>   He was following in the (big) footsteps of another Austrian. As it
had for Arnold, L.A. lay glittering in front of Helnwein. He was glad
he had come West.</TE>
<TE>   "New York is dead," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lee explained his vision for the foundation--drawing more people
to contemporary art, and, in particular, to the gallery on Traction
Avenue--as he and Helnwein gave a tour of Lee's studio and the
gallery around the corner. (Helnwein has a studio loft next door to
Lee's.)</TE>
<TE>   In Lee's studio, one of Helnwein's canvases, "Epi- phany II
(Presentation at the Temple)," a hyperrealist painting in blue tones,
depicts a young girl lying on a kitchen table in front of a
semi-circle of disfigured men in formal suits.</TE>
<TE>   "People are used to seeing things 24 frames a second," said Lee,
adding that his goal was to get people to concentrate on just one
frame at a time. "This town needs it more than anywhere else."</TE>
<TE>   The Next Generation</TE>
<TE>   Next week's opening of "Road to Perdition," a father-son story
starring Tom Hanks as a hit man for the Irish mob in Depression-era
Chicago, marks a first for the Zanuck family, one of Hollywood's most
powerful movie clans. It's the debut producing credit for the
family's youngest member: Dean Zanuck, 29.</TE>
<TE>   With this picture, the Zanuck movie-making gene will have been
passed to the third generation. Patriarch Darryl Zanuck founded 20th
Century Films, which, after a merger, became 20th Century Fox. Then
his son, Richard Zanuck, became the youngest corporate studio head at
28. Richard went on to produce several Academy Award-winning films,
including "The Sting" and "Jaws," and he and his wife, Lili Fini
Zanuck, earned Oscars for "Cocoon" and "Driving Miss Daisy."</TE>
<TE>   Their sons Harrison, 31, and Dean joined the Zanuck Co. about five
years ago. Now, Richard says, "I have tentacles through Lili and the
boys that keep me up to date and au courant."</TE>
<TE>   Dean recalled the adrenalin rush of watching his idea land in the
hands of Steven Spielberg and reach the screen starring some of the
industry's most well-respected talent. The graphic novel on which
"Road" is based was sent to him from "a pretty obscure literary
agent" in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   He pitched the idea over the phone to his father, who was
monitoring work on "Rules of Engagement" in Morocco. Dean said his
father "saw ... the father-and-son relationship that was the real
core of it all. He told me to send it to Steven Spielberg. That felt
good! You can't think much bigger than that!" About a week later,
Hanks and director Sam Mendes were attached to the idea.</TE>
<TE>   The film opens July 12 along with another Zanuck film: "Reign of
Fire," starring Christian Bale and Matthew McConaughey. On that
night, the father and sons will attend a Dodger game--and wait for
the box office numbers to arrive from New York.</TE>
<TE>   Quote/Unquote:</TE>
<TE>   "It's our own ya-ya sisterhood," says Cheryl Saban on Arianna
Huffington, Nancy Daly Riordan and Carol Biondi. Saban, who wrote the
philanthropic guide "50 Ways to Save Our Children" (Harper Trophy),
regularly meets with the three to discuss how to give. "I couldn't be
living this kind of fairy-tale life, which is what I think I live,
without doing this."</TE>

<LD>Any accurate inventory of California's cultural treasures would have
to include Heyday Books, which is precisely what a first-water
regional press ought to be--and so few are.</LD>
<LD>   Since publisher and editor Malcolm Margolin founded Heyday in
1974, the Berkeley-based press has issued a stream of high-quality
volumes on California's natural and cultural history, its
contemporary and historic literature and poetry. Books on the state's
Native Americans are one of the press' particular strengths.</LD>
<LD>   Margolin is the author of "The Ohlone Way," a reconstruction of
the period before European contact, when the San Francisco Bay Area
was home to what may have been the densest Indian population in North
America. Heyday has been a pioneer in making available to general
audiences the oral literature of California's 100 or more Indian
peoples. Over the years, Margolin has published a compendium of Maidu
myths and tales and dual language editions of the Wintu and Karuk
people's oral literature. Encouraging the preservation of such
languages is one of the publisher's preoccupations, a goal it
furthers through the nonprofit quarterly magazine News from Native
California.</LD>
<TE>   Southern Californians stopping by the Casino Morongo on their way
to Palm Springs might be surprised to discover that their Native
American hosts possess an ancient and still vigorous language,
spirituality and culture, all of which are explored in "The Heart Is
Fire: The World of the Cahuilla Indians of Southern California,"
published by Heyday last year.</TE>
<TE>   Margolin's latest enthusiasm is an ambitious new imprint devoted
to California's Central Valley, an endeavor underwritten in large
part by a three-year, $500,000 grant from the Irvine Foundation.
"We're not going to be doing a three-volume history of Lodi," he
quipped, "because the Central Valley is an amazing literary area with
its own world-class writers, photographers and artists. I think there
are more poets per capita in Fresno than anywhere else in the world."</TE>
<TE>   The Central Valley imprint's first titles will include a
collection of architectural designer David Wilson's photographs of
abandoned industrial and agricultural buildings. The work, says
Margolin, "has all the real mysteriousness of a genuine artist at
work. I realized how powerful it is when I drove from Berkeley to
Fresno and discovered David had changed my way of looking at these
structures. That's what art can do for a place."</TE>
<TE>   Other volumes will include a collection of site-specific works and
photos suggested by poet and farmer David Mas Masumoto. It will
include his work and that of 19 other Central Valley writers. There
will be a "powerful" first novel, "Blood Vine" by Aris Janigian, and
the collected poems of Tulare poet laureate Wilma McDaniel. "She was
a part of the Okie migration into California," said Margolin "and has
been writing poems for 75 years or so. They are poems of deep
experience told in a quirky, salt-of-the-Earth outsider's voice."</TE>
<TE>   Margolin's discussions with the Irvine Foundation spurred him to
begin thinking about succession. "The Irvine people were
understandably interested in the future of a press that is so
dependent on my good health, sanity and sobriety," said Margolin, who
is 61. "The truth is that I started out as a one-man band and Heyday
has become a three-ring circus. I used to store our inventory in our
house. Our kids slept on the unsold books and, as they went, the kids
slept closer and closer to the floor. That was our tracking system."</TE>
<TE>   Margolin is in the process of turning Heyday into a nonprofit and,
he said, "giving more of its work over to other people. I've been
taking long vacations and firing myself from a lot of jobs."</TE>
<TE>   Work in Progress</TE>
<TE>   Ann Beattie is the author of numerous novels and short-story
collections: "Over the past few weeks, I finally got around to
revising a story I wrote in August of 2000, when I was taking care of
my husband, who had just had his tonsils out at age 50, and I was
setting the alarm to get up and give Vicodin at two-hour intervals.
I've also just finished a six-page short story, which is the shortest
thing I've written in a long while.</TE>
<TE>   "I've recently returned to teaching and I'm doing a lot of reading
on the American short story for the two classes on that topic I'll be
doing at the University of Virginia at Charlottesville in the fall.
As I've conceived the course, the stories are arranged by category,
so the students may read a particular author just once or several
times. The categories are arranged by physical objects; there are
refrigerator stories and car stories, for example. Obviously, this is
somewhat tongue-in-cheek, but it also allows my students to approach
this work without reference to the symbols and other academic
preoccupations that turn so many of them off. It also allows them to
learn some real things about American culture--and they begin to
learn the role of specificity in literature.</TE>
<TE>   "Arranging stories in these categories and thinking about them in
this way has reinvigorated my own feeling about American short
fiction. Besides, when else do I get a chance to talk about short
stories for two hours a week?"</TE>

<HD>Models Get Tough</HD>
<DH>Their lawsuit alleges that certain agencies illegally fixed
fees and charged excessive commissions</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALLI HERMAN-COHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thirteen years ago, Carolyn Fears left her rural Illinois home at 19
to join Ford Models in New York. The 6-foot redhead landed jobs in
Manhattan and Europe, appeared on billboards, magazine covers and in
numerous ads, eventually earning as much as $100,000 annually. As
glamorous as modeling seemed, Fears learned early on how tough the
business could be.</LD>
<LD>   "When I was first starting, I went to the agency to get my
paycheck, and they were taking $1,500 out of it. I said, 'What is
this?' One of the owners was standing behind me and said, 'That's to
put you in the agency's book. I don't see you on the cover of Vogue.
If you don't like it, get out.' I went into the bathroom and cried,"
Fears recalled. "It's intimidating and you just want to please
everybody. You're not thinking about the commissions and fees."</LD>
<LD>   Last week, Fears, 32, joined five other California models in
filing a class-action lawsuit in New York federal court against eight
top modeling agencies, alleging that the firms violate the law by
fixing fees and charging far more in commissions than is legal. Fears
hopes the lawsuit will give models with New York agencies more
protection and a larger share of their earnings. The case, filed by a
partner of antitrust heavy hitter David Boies of Boies, Schiller &amp;
Flexner, alleges that New York modeling agencies have been fixing
prices on fees for nearly 30 years.</LD>
<TE>   According to the lawsuit, models are given form contracts, which
the agencies claim are standard and not subject to negotiation. Few
complain because like Fears and co-plaintiffs Amanda Masters, Lorelei
Shellist, Barbara Cheeseborough, Carla Gross (also known as Sebastian
Cardon) and Justin Klentner, they are concerned that they may be
blacklisted--a key reason it has taken so long for the allegedly
illegal practices to come to light, according to Brian Rishwain, a
partner in the Los Angeles firm Johnson and Rishwain, which has
joined the case.</TE>
<TE>   "You start modeling so young that you are just so happy to be
doing it," said Fears, who lives in Sunset Beach and opened a surf
shop with her earnings. "You naturally get wiser as you get older,
and by that point, you might be getting out of the industry and not
care." The case involves California residents partly because
Rishwain, a former model, was familiar with the industry and knew
local models. Andrew Hayes, the Boies partner who filed the case,
added that recently discovered documents and reports from individuals
helped bring what the suit is alleging to be a decades-old conspiracy
to light.</TE>
<TE>   The models, who are in their 30s and 40s, accuse the agencies of
violating federal antitrust laws and New York state laws regulating
employment agencies. According to the lawsuit, the Wilhelmina Model
Agency, Ford Models, Elite Model Management and five other New York
agencies conspired in the 1970s to set the fees they charge to
models, and to fix terms of their contracts. In addition, the lawsuit
challenges the long-standing practice whereby agencies collect a 20%
commission on the model's earnings and charge an additional 20%
commission to the model's employers. The eight agencies represent
more than half of the New York market, measured by total volume of
bookings, according to the complaint.</TE>
<TE>   "I look at it as a 40% commission," said Fears, who said that her
first Ford agency written contract didn't mention that the client
would be paying Ford an additional 20% to hire her. New York state
law allows any employment agency to collect only a 10% commission.
However, the models' lawyers said that modeling agencies have for
years presented themselves as managers, not employment agencies, in
an attempt to avoid the limit on commissions.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is, if you are a manager of a model, it would be
a conflict of interest to be taking money from the person who is
employing that model, without the model's consent or awareness of
it," said Rishwain.</TE>
<TE>   Joey Grill, vice president of Click Model Management in New York,
one of the defendants, called the suit "ridiculous." The other New
York agencies named in the case, Next Management Co., Boss Models,
Zoli Model Management (which was recently purchased by Click) and
Company Management, would not comment or return repeated telephone
calls. Modeling agencies not named in the suit aren't voicing
concern, according to Heinz Holba, president and founder of L.A.
Models, which is not a target of the suit. "I don't think this thing
has any merit, and neither does anyone else," said Holba, who noted
that California agencies are governed by different laws. However,
according to Rishwain, the commission rates are the same in
California and New York.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the models involved in the lawsuit are edging toward the
ends of their careers and have established other sources of income,
which helps shield them from potential backlash. Jobs have become
scarce in the slow advertising climate following Sept. 11, making
many models averse to more risk. Shellist, of San Diego, was
reluctant to discuss the case because she still works as a model, in
addition to using her fashion experiences to teach teen girls about
self-esteem. "Who wants to bite the hand that feeds them?" she said.
"The majority of us make a normal, average living," said Fears, who
estimated the average salary of a successful model at $40,000. "There
were years that I was borrowing money from my parents to get by."</TE>
<TE>   Some models said they began to question their agencies' practices
after taking acting jobs and discovering that under Screen Actors
Guild rules those commissions were limited to 10%. Klentner, who
lives in Los Angeles and is one of the plaintiffs, compared models to
other professionals with short careers, such as athletes, who
typically have better job benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "My only real concern has always been that whenever I did
commercials or acting jobs, I had a pension or health insurance,"
Klentner said. "I'm 39, and I have friends who started to model
before I did and truly have no job skills. On top of that, they have
no pensions or health benefits. There's an actors' old age home, but
there's nothing like that for models," said Klentner, who now designs
and builds custom homes in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm doing great now," said the Michigan native who once modeled
for GQ, Vogue, Calvin Klein and Versace, "but I have so many friends
who are in a really hard place now." Unlike actors, models have never
been able to build a strong union.</TE>
<TE>   Though Klentner made a nice living and had good experiences as a
model, he's not convinced that others will be as fortunate. He
doesn't like what he sees: "These agencies are getting rich, rich,
rich off of 15-year-old girls and 18-year-old guys."</TE>
<TE>   Models rarely challenge the practices of their agencies because
they are often young, naive and afraid, Fears said, noting that the
far-flung nature of the jobs has created a disjointed atmosphere
conducive to potential abuses. "Models travel a lot, they don't work
[as models] for very long and they don't work together in groups,"
she said. "We don't really have co-workers, and no one gets together
and talks about it. If they do, they are totally intimidated and
afraid to try and change the system."</TE>
<TE>   According to the lawsuit, modeling agencies allegedly used
meetings of a trade group, International Model Management Assn., to
fix rates and terms of models' contracts. The IMMA includes several
of the agencies named in the suit.</TE>
<TE>   Modeling agencies have been coming under increasing scrutiny in
recent years. Five years ago in Texas, the consumer affairs division
of the state attorney general's office investigated the fees that
modeling agencies were charging aspiring models to attend model
search seminars.</TE>
<TE>   Hayes said that the New York practices have gone unchallenged
because agencies can exploit the inexperience of their charges.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the people who come into the business are young and told
that it [the commission] is standard," said Hayes, whose firm won
price-fixing cases against Sotheby's and Christie's auction houses.</TE>
<TE>   "The models ask around and find out that it is standard. Uniform
pricing, regardless of market conditions, and lack of competition on
price, is often a sign that something else is going on," Hayes said.
"It's not proof in and of itself, but it makes you wonder why there
isn't any competition."</TE>
<TE>   The burden of commissions falls hardest on the legions of
lower-paid, less famous models who fill catalogs, department store
ads and other lower-profile assignments. "Contracts can be negotiated
for top supermodels," Rishwain said. "Everyone else has no bargaining
power in negotiating."</TE>
<TE>   For the models who have joined the suit, most said the issue isn't
money but the principle. They want to change the practices for the
many others who are still working. "There is no safety net," Fears
said. "You go at your own risk and try to get some money out of it.
It doesn't last forever."</TE>

<DH>Redesigned Earth Shoe is making strides in niche market</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALLI HERMAN-COHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fashion's retro infatuation has become a long-lasting love affair.
The latest relic to resurface is the Earth Shoe, that funny-looking,
sunken-heeled phenomenon of the 1970s.</LD>
<LD>   The brand was relaunched for the fall 2001 season, after a 25-year
hiatus, but without the iconic styles that made them famous. After
customers clamored for the authentic looks, the Earth footwear
company decided to reissue similar styles this fall.</LD>
<LD>   "People were yelling at us--'How could you do this and not bring
back the original designs?' " said Executive Vice President Charles
Liberge. "People were sending us pictures of their original '70s
shoes and asking us for copies."</LD>
<TE>   The shoes aren't exact replicas, but are modernized versions of
the stiff, original design by Danish yoga teacher Anne Kalso. New
styles borrow materials and technology from athletic shoes and
include an innovative solution to the problematic width question--a
set of insoles, one thick and one thin, that helps customize the fit.
The toe boxes are less square and the overall look is more European
athletic, less granola-eating geek.</TE>
<TE>   The new shoes still offer Kalso's "negative heel technology,"
which positions the heel about  1/4-inch lower than the toes to
create a stance that mimics bare feet walking in sand.</TE>
<TE>   The fall collection offers 31 styles for women and 23 for men;
retail prices are from $99 to $159--far above the 1974 prices of
$23.50 to $42.50.</TE>
<TE>   The funky little shoes earned their moniker on April 1, 1970, when
importers Raymond and Eleanor Jacobs opened their first shoe store in
Manhattan, coincidentally in the midst of the first Earth Day
celebration. Eleanor hand-lettered a sign advertising "earth shoes"
and the name stuck. The company grew to 110 shops, and competitors
cashed in with millions of imitations. By 1977, the company had gone
out of production.</TE>
<TE>   The new Earth Shoes are selling in nine countries and 500 stores,
including the Walking Company in Santa Monica and Fine Kicks,
Boulevard Footwear and Neo 39, all on Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena.
The company doubled its $1-million sales goal in its first season,
and the 2002 sales are expected to be $6 million. Liberge says the
company is on track to make it, one low-heeled step at a time.</TE>
<TE>   Letting Your Hair Down</TE>
<TE>   Chaz Dean is a healthy hair evangelist who has remade many a head
of straw-like hair into shiny tresses with his no-shampoo, "cleansing
conditioner" Wen hair products.</TE>
<TE>   When the hairstylist moved his operations from Bel-Air to an
unglamorous stretch of Fountain Avenue in Hollywood more than three
years ago, some loyal clients wondered if he had suds on the brain.</TE>
<TE>   But Dean has become a voice for the power of rehabilitation--he
just didn't stop at hair. He was one of several pioneers leading the
gentrification of his end of Hollywood, just down the block from
Amoeba Records.</TE>
<TE>   The professional photographer and intermittent landscaper has been
remaking three Craftsman houses into a beauty-and-spa compound that
gives the feeling of an urban hideaway.</TE>
<TE>   He has devoted an entire house to his latest project, a new
boutique stocked with exotic home decorations and subtly scented body
products.</TE>
<TE>   The shop is full of Moroccan glassware, tea sets, sushi platters,
candles, jewelry and, of course, his newly expanded Wen hair and body
products.</TE>
<TE>   Webby Award</TE>
<TE>   Photographer David McIntyre and makeup artist Kelley Quan were
presented with a Webby Award for their www.zoozoom.com online fashion
magazine at the June awards ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   Zoozoom.com, which was launched two years ago, won for its
originality and ease of navigation--words not often associated with
anything regarding fashion.</TE>

<HD>Snobs' Old Rules? Sniff.</HD>
<DH>If you want to get ahead, it's image, not money or
breeding, that counts</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>According to the man who wrote the book on snobbery, Los Angeles has
recently become an address one can announce with the quiet arrogance
so long reserved for the denizens of a few bergs on the Eastern
Seaboard. "It's still not exactly Florence, mind you, " says Joseph
Epstein, an essayist and author of the recently published "Snobbery:
the American Version," (Houghton Mifflin) "but if that's what hell
looks like, I don't think I'll mind it a bit. And that's hard for a
snobographer like myself to admit."</LD>
<LD>   That L.A. is a city of power and prestige is just one of the
things Epstein finds himself admitting. Quite early in his treatise,
he explains the roots of his own snobbery, which is a very wise
decision. Because if you're going to write a 251-page book in which
you define a snob by quoting Balzac and Proust (though mercifully not
in the original French) and chastise name-droppers while offhandedly
quoting everyone from Mao Tse-tung to Mike Nichols, if you're going
to include a bio reminding everyone that you were, for two decades,
the editor of the American Scholar whose work has appeared in the New
Yorker, the Atlantic Monthly and Harper's, then it is a good idea to
cop to your own blind spots right up front.</LD>
<TE>   "The great thing is to recognize snobbery and be amused by it," he
says from his home outside Chicago. "But I still have to be on guard
all the time. For instance, it pleases me to write for the New
Yorker. But I have to ask myself, 'Is the pleasure genuine or is it a
snobbish thing?' Is it because saying, 'I write for the New Yorker'
impresses some people? You would think all my years writing about all
this would have freed me from this baloney," he says, whittling his
professorial voice into a petulant whine, "but it doesn't always."</TE>
<TE>   The main point of what is a very amusing and insightful book is
that snobbery is alive and well, but all the rules have changed. The
age of the WASP, Epstein argues, is over (Someone should probably cc:
Ralph Lauren, Tom Wolfe and the folks at Restoration Hardware) and in
its place a new social caste system has risen, one based more on
image than breeding.</TE>
<TE>   After quickly working his way through a history of snobbery in
America, Epstein gets down to the modern categories--including
education, politics, fashion, fame--and by the time he is through,
many of our modern sacred cows--from Susan Sontag and the New York
Review of Books to the new hipness of middle age--have been reduced
from icons to snob fetishes.</TE>
<TE>   "When the style pages replaced the society pages," says Epstein,
"then we knew the world was now a different place."</TE>
<TE>   A place where one's car, one's profession, one's nearness to
celebrity, even one's choice of balsamic vinegar can carry more
social weight than one's family tree. In this new world, almost
anything goes. Previous political disenfranchisement--Epstein uses
gays and Jews as his examples--now conveys status. A new breed of
"virtucrats" manages to trump any real understanding of political
theory with sentimentality for the often ill-defined masses. And
where once most Americans were happy just to send their children
through college, now even the lower middle class yearns to utter a
sentence that includes the words "my daughter, who's at Stanford, you
know...."</TE>
<TE>   The fact that there is a hierarchy of water--not of water rights
but bottled water--reveals a society at once highly stratified and
hopelessly flailing. The modern snob often seems to be making it up
as he goes along, desperately hoping that Vanity Fair or Maxim
notices in time.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, none of this will come as a surprise to Angelenos.</TE>
<TE>   Old money in this town is anything that predates the latest Viacom
merger, and the fact that there is still a Los Angeles Blue Book
would come as a surprise to most citizens (including many of those
listed in it). This city was, and continues to be, a sanctuary from
the repressive traditions of the East, a place where fortunes are
made, not inherited, where the A-list is so elastic that one can be
on it one month and off the next and the only thing that's changed is
a decimal point at the box office.</TE>
<TE>   If the new currency in social stature is image, then Los Angeles
is Fort Knox. From baby strollers to colonics, from literature to
video games, every industry has its hierarchy and if one is not
available, a good snob will arbitrarily choose "the best."</TE>
<TE>   "Personal trainers, stylists, hair colorists, plastic surgeons,
chefs--everyone has 'their' person, and their person is the best,"
says Merle Ginsberg who, as entertainment editor of W and Women's
Wear Daily, divides her time between L.A. and New York. "Usually
because they also work for the big stars. Which makes sense because
they, in turn, are going to have access to the very best
things--first pick of the designers, first look at the new art.
Whatever."</TE>
<TE>   The current secession crisis is really the result of decades-long
snobbery. Oh, supporters say they are irate over inequitable
distribution of resources, but we know they're just tired of all the
Valley jokes.</TE>
<TE>   The fickle heart of L.A. snobbery is, of course, Hollywood. "There
is as much of a food chain in L.A. as there is in Washington," says
Graydon Carter, editor in chief of Vanity Fair. "Because these are
essentially one-industry towns." A reliable shorthand to Hollywood's
social structure is the demarcation between the "above the line"
talent--actors, directors, producers and, if one is being generous or
speaking of Tom Stoppard, screenwriters--and "below the line," which
is everyone else.</TE>
<TE>   "Producers think it's beneath them to have dinner with
screenwriters unless they're Steve Gagin. This year," says Carter.
"And it isn't about money, because some of the richest people in town
are television writers, and they seem to eat at pizza parlors,
mostly. I would say the hierarchy goes: movies, music, television."</TE>
<TE>   Epstein calls name-dropping "social-climbing on the cheap," but in
this town, one's car or condiments matter not if it is possible to
say with any sort of plausibility: "Sorry, I couldn't get back to you
yesterday. I was over at Tom and Rita's."</TE>
<TE>   There is a mild irony in this. "Back in the old days, the Blue
Ribbon ladies looked down on what they called show-biz," says Wanda
McDaniel, a former society editor and now a PR rep for Armani. Still,
Hollywood-based snobbery is hard to pin down because Hollywood is one
of those tantalizing, moth-murdering lights that allows Americans to
believe they live in a classless society. Overnight, the mythology
goes, one's fortune can change if only one is in the right place at
the right time. Hence, Epstein says, a real snob must have constant
reassurance that she or he is getting the right invitations, sitting
at the right tables or shopping at the right stores (as if briefly
sharing Barneys shoe department with Julia Roberts denotes a
relationship).</TE>
<TE>   An invitation to the Vanity Fair Oscar party is one of L.A.'s
golden tickets. Yet Carter claims it is a very democratic party--once
you're in, there's no VIP area. Because, of course, the whole thing
is a VIP area. In using the word "democratic" to describe an
exclusive event, Carter is straddling the narrow border between
elitism and snobbery. With the exception of Dominick Dunne, most real
snobs know that to claim snobbery is tacky. Elizabeth Familian, who
publishes the L.A. Masterplanner, the social calendar of the city's
elite, says there is no snobbery in L.A. because "anyone who is
willing to roll up their sleeves and work can get onto the A-list."</TE>
<TE>   Even Epstein agrees that not everyone on the A-list is a snob.
Everyone is entitled to elitism--the idea that certain things are
superior to others. But a snob finds it necessary to make those who
don't have, don't know, or weren't invited feel bad about it.</TE>
<TE>   On the way up the social ladder, says Carter, snobbery is seeking
out certain people for all the wrong reasons. "And once you're
established, snubbing certain people for the same wrong reasons."</TE>
<TE>   Youth and beauty have long been the most helpful tools when
climbing that ladder, and that remains true, especially in Los
Angeles. "I have to remember never to eat bread when I'm in L.A.,"
says Ginsberg. "People look down on you if you're a woman and you eat
bread. I swear they do."</TE>
<TE>   Other key accouterments include airplanes, East Coast architects
and paintings, says Carter. "Paintings clean up a lot of things.
Thirty years ago it was books, but now most Angelenos just use them
for coasters."</TE>
<TE>   Comments like that are constant reminders of L.A.'s long history
of being on the receiving end of snobbery, especially New York
snobbery, (although Carter is quick to assure that New Yorkers spend
hardly any time thinking about Angelenos, so obsessed are they with
themselves). But as Epstein points out, all snobbery is at some level
defensive, and indefensible.</TE>
<TE>   The man who defines himself by his new BMW is doomed to be
deflated the moment a Bentley pulls up beside him. Which may explain
why in L.A., where almost every luxury or sports car will inevitably
be snickered at by a parking attendant who has just put away the
newer Titanium model, the new status car is the electric hybrid. "It
is quite amazing," says Arianna Huffington, who neatly traverses
several of L.A.'s inner circles. "All these people who could afford
the most luxurious cars are driving these things. It's a sort of
'greener than thou' attitude."</TE>
<TE>   Many Angelenos have developed a busier-than-thou snobbery as well.
For the elite, there is simply not enough time in the day, and so on
the ninth day, God created cell phones and other gadgets--proof of
one's indispensability to the universe. Which then allows free time
to be seen as the next status symbol. Golf, for example, has long
been the sport of the elite, mainly because it involved a lot of
expense--equipment, lessons, country club membership, etc. But now
it's the time required that's the real currency. "Having four free
hours to devote to a game of golf is the ultimate symbol of being
ahead of the game," says Bill Higgins, a reporter at Variety.</TE>
<TE>   Vacations are also planned and evaluated for maximum
image-building. Educational trips, whether a long weekend at the Sun
Valley Writer's conference or a two-week excursion to the Galapagos,
have replaced cruises to the Caribbean, says Armani's McDaniel.
"Anywhere you can reach by commercial airline is out now," says
Carter. "Further away, harder to get to, places that require
chartering a plane or hiring a guide, those are the high-powered
vacations now."</TE>
<TE>   Although McDaniel admits there is still a lot of cachet in having
"the good Armani, the Armani that never hits the floor," she says she
is seeing an almost anti-snobbery becoming the new snobbery. With
millionaires and outlet malls flourishing at about the same rate,
anyone can have more, so now people want less. Sort of.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be what you drove; now people want to be around other
people whose values line up with theirs." Rather than have a huge
blowout in some hot restaurant, she says, "the cool thing is to have
a low-key birthday party where every seat is filled by a real
friend."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, if one of those real friends happens to be Tom Hanks,
well, so much the better.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Neil Simon's "California Suite," Jane Fonda plays a high-strung
East Coast intellectual doing battle with her ex-husband (Alan Alda),
who has, in her opinion, committed the unmitigated heresy of leaving
New York and becoming an unapologetic Angeleno.</LD>
<LD>   After she has criticized his haircut, sweater, girlfriend, use of
the word "girlfriend" and general laid-back attitude, he loses his
temper.</LD>
<LD>   "You're such a snob," he says. "Thank God there's a few of us
left," she says right back.</LD>
<TE>   So bearing in mind that one person's snobbery is another person's
good sense, here are a few hallmarks of snobbery, the L.A. version:</TE>
<TE>   * When mentioning your alma mater, you say "Cal" instead of
Berkeley, and you mention it often.</TE>
<TE>   * Your candy comes from Edelweiss chocolates, your diapers from
Dy-dee Diapers, your jewelry from Harry Winston, your nanny through
Nannies Unlimited, you got sober at Promises, your hair was colored
at Louis Licari, and you found all of these services in a book called
"L.A. First Class," but in conversation you neglect to mention this
last fact.</TE>
<TE>   * You read books in galleys, see only the director's cut of
movies, and get the weekend sections of the Times (L.A. and New York)
the Thursday before.</TE>
<TE>   * When it comes to filmmaking, you hate Hollywood, love India and
assume any film without subtitles is a (shudder) blockbuster.</TE>
<TE>   * You have never seen a Thomas Guide but assume your driver has
one somewhere.</TE>
<TE>   * You ask who's catering the event before R.S.V.P.-ing.</TE>
<TE>   * When you receive a bouquet of flowers, you're less interested in
who sent them than in what florist was used.</TE>
<TE>   * You never go to Chinois on Main with a party larger than four

<HD>From a Self-Indulgent Life to Parenthood</HD>
<DH>'Margarita Happy Hour,' by writer-director-editor Ilya
Chaiken in an auspicious feature debut, follows an artist struggling
with her life's transition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ilya Chaiken's "Margarita Happy Hour" captures beautifully a period
in a young artist's life when she's beginning to experience the full
impact of the responsibilities of motherhood.</LD>
<LD>   Eleanor Hutchins' Zelda is slim and striking, a standout in the
New York art scene she frequents. Home is a well-appointed Brooklyn
apartment she shares with her would-be novelist lover Max (Larry
Fessenden) and their baby, Little Z. Zelda can summon lots of sullen
attitude when she thinks the occasion calls for it, but fundamentally
she is a kind, thoughtful person and instinctively a responsible
mother.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, it is her desire to be a good parent that marks the
beginning of a slow and painful transformation. She yearns to remain
a scene queen, but taking care of Little Z takes priority. Like it or
not, Zelda is forced to consider the life she is leading. Just how
she and Max make ends meet is not clear, but her only apparent source
of income is as an illustrator for a porn publication. In addition to
caring for an infant, she is stuck with two losers--Max, an indolent,
hard-drinking failed novelist, and Natali (Holly Ramos), who's
recovering from a near-fatal drug overdose.</LD>
<TE>   Zelda draws solace from four friends she meets regularly at a
neighborhood bar for happy-hour margaritas, but inevitably she sees
herself in them--attractive women who sense their options are running
out along with their 20s. Suitable mates and suitable employment seem
elusive for this group, yet they cling to a carefree, hard-partying,
making-the-scene lifestyle that they should have outgrown.</TE>
<TE>   Writer-director Chaiken, admittedly drawing upon personal
experiences, has made a mature film grappling with immaturity.
Chaiken takes a wry, detached, sometimes ruefully amused stance, at
the same time involving us with people who are not particularly
sympathetic.</TE>
<TE>   Chaiken also manages to make the film conversational without
seeming talky, the curse of many New York filmmakers, and she has as
sure an instinct for the succinct image and brisk pacing as she does
for dialogue. Hutchins is as much a discovery as Chaiken, and both
command attention in a natural, unpretentious manner. Best known as
the director of the acclaimed "Habit" and recent "Wendigo," Fessenden
captures well the contradictions and conflicting impulses of Max.</TE>
<TE>   Effective in all its aspects, "Margarita Happy Hour" represents an
auspicious feature debut for Chaiken.</TE>
<TE>   Unrated. Times guidelines: Strong language, considerable
drug-taking and drinking.</TE>

<HD>Ratings Jump May Be a Sign of Better News for CNBC</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID BAUDER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Nearly buried in the bad financial news of the past week was the
glimmer of hope it offered to struggling CNBC.</LD>
<LD>   On June 26, the day after CNBC's David Faber first reported about
WorldCom Inc. inflating earnings by hiding nearly $4 billion in
expenses, the cable network had 29% more viewers than on a typical
day this year.</LD>
<LD>   After a nearly unrelenting two-year run of bad news following the
bursting of the Internet bubble, CNBC will seize on even that small
reason for optimism.</LD>
<TE>   "I do think we're going through a historic period right now where
American investors are going to have to engage in the complexities of
the financial markets," said Pamela Thomas-Graham, CNBC's chief
executive.</TE>
<TE>   And, she hopes, engage in CNBC again.</TE>
<TE>   The cable network has fallen far from its peak, when it averaged
418,000 viewers during the day in March 2000. For a few months, more
people watched CNBC during the day than watched CNN.</TE>
<TE>   The network's ratings fell with the stock market. During the first
half of this year, CNBC's average viewership of 232,000 was 23% lower
than it was the year earlier, according to Nielsen Media Research.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer people are investing in stocks now and, with the market
doing poorly, even fewer want to hear about it every day, said Jack
Wakshlag, a ratings analyst for the Turner television networks.</TE>
<TE>   CNBC will focus heavily on the corporate scandals as they unfold,
Thomas-Graham said. The network announced this week it had hired
former Securities and Exchange Commission member Laura Unger as a
commentator.</TE>
<TE>   The channel also is converting its prime-time lineup primarily to
business programming for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   That's partly out of necessity--it has no non-business star like
Geraldo Rivera anymore--and out of design to sharpen the network's
focus, Thomas-Graham said.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Williams' one-hour newscast will be moving from MSNBC to
CNBC exclusively starting July 15. The first third of Williams' show
will be about general news, with the rest largely concentrating on
business, she said.</TE>

<HD>Battery-Powered, Jerry Lewis Is Back in Action</HD>
<DH>Recovery* Driven nearly to suicide by chronic pain, the
comedian was saved by electronic spinal implants that give him relief
and renewed hope for the future.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB THOMAS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>On his 40th birthday in 1966, Jerry Lewis gave a lavish party for
himself at his Bel-Air estate. Although his films were panned by most
critics, they made big money for Paramount, and all the big shots
were there.</LD>
<LD>   Studio chief Barney Balaban announced grandly: "Just tell us what
you want, and we'll give it to you." Without blinking, Lewis replied:
"I would like the negatives of all my pictures after 30 years."</LD>
<LD>   The executives agreed, and on his 70th birthday, the first
negative arrived.</LD>
<TE>   Since then, no doubt motivated by Eddie Murphy's successful
version of Lewis' 1963 comedy "The Nutty Professor," six studios have
bought remake rights to Lewis movies: "The Bellboy" (MGM), "The
Errand Boy" (Disney), "Cinderfella" (New Line), "The Patsy" (Fox),
"The Family Jewels" (Paramount) and "The Ladies' Man" (Columbia).</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's nice that Hollywood recognizes what I did 40 years
ago wasn't too bad," Lewis says in a slightly smug reference to his
greater recognition abroad--especially in France--than at home.</TE>
<TE>   At 76, Lewis--and his legacy--remain remarkably robust despite his
penchant for controversy and a recent bout of severe back pain from
"years of pratfalls" that had Lewis considering suicide.</TE>
<TE>   The irrepressible clown, filmmaker and fund-raiser for the
Muscular Dystrophy Assn. just keeps going and going--not unlike the
pain-blocking batteries now implanted near his spine.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis is already preparing for this year's MDA telethon, has a
20-year contract to entertain at the Orleans Hotel &amp; Casino in Las
Vegas and occasionally hits the lecture circuit.</TE>
<TE>   He has no plans to make any new films, but he does have options to
appear in the remakes, as he did in "The Nutty Professor."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis also has a $1.5-million contract with Random House for a
memoir about his storied--and stormy--partnership with Dean Martin.
He started writing the book in 1996 and has completed about 1,300
pages, which he estimates is just one-third of the story. Movie
rights have been sold to HBO.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Lewis, his wife, SanDee (known as Sam), and their
10-year-old daughter, Danielle (nicknamed Dani), live on a shady
street not far from the Las Vegas Strip. The two-story family home is
spacious but not as grand as the palaces Jerry occupied in his
Hollywood heyday. (He was married to band singer Patty Palmer from
1944 to '81, and they raised five sons.)</TE>
<TE>   His haven is the office, its walls and shelves covered with
photographs of Jerry with celebrities, caricatures and paintings of
Jerry in clown makeup and costume, and family photos.</TE>
<TE>   The wide desk and the floor around it are littered with sheets of
paper with notes about his life with Martin.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis is late for an interview. He and Sam were attending a
program at Dani's school. Dani performed an imitation of ... Jerry
Lewis, of course, and the proud papa ("She is the air in my lungs")
deems the performance a hit.</TE>
<TE>   When Lewis finally breezes into the office, the first impression
is a shock. His cheeks are puffed out to twice their usual size. He
also lacks the slimness of his prime. He says one of his medicines
has caused the excess poundage.</TE>
<TE>   His voice is strong and exuberant, but he seems more serious than
in previous interviews; not once does the squeaky, little-boy
character emerge. His gravity is perhaps understandable. In the past
couple of years, Lewis has been plagued by devastating physical ills.</TE>
<TE>   Pain Reaches Crisis Point</TE>
<TE>   The low point came several months ago when his back pain grew so
intense that he couldn't sleep, began losing his eyesight and
couldn't walk more than a few feet. Medical help, including morphine,
was of no avail, and Lewis plunged into a deep depression.</TE>
<TE>   "I really thought about what gun I was going to use," he says.</TE>
<TE>   The turning point came as a result of a daily ritual he and
daughter Dani have. Each afternoon they discuss the events of the
day, and he often gives her a new word to learn. One day last year it
was "courage."</TE>
<TE>   On an afternoon in March, Dani found her father at his lowest
ebb--body slumped, head bowed.</TE>
<TE>   "Daddy," she said, "you're going to get better if you start using
your courage."</TE>
<TE>   "When she hit me with that line, I felt like I was struck by
something from heaven," Lewis recalls. "It turned my mental attitude
right around. I said, 'Let me get this fixed.' "</TE>
<TE>   He consulted Dr. Michael DeBakey, the famed Houston heart surgeon
who performed the first implantation of an artificial heart in 1966
and Lewis' life-saving double bypass in 1982. DeBakey, still
practicing at 93, suggested implantation of a new device from
Medtronic Inc., the Minneapolis company that invented the heart
pacemaker.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis had surgery April 8 in Houston to have a battery-powered
pulse generator implanted. Two wires deliver electronic impulses from
the device to the spinal cord, where electrodes are embedded to stop
the nerves from relaying pain messages to the brain. When Lewis left
the hospital five days later, he was able to walk down a 200-yard
corridor.</TE>
<TE>   "I have been pain-free for the first time in 49 years," said
Lewis. "I can raise the stimulator for when I want the pain to go
away." He couldn't resist adding: "It also opens my garage."</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Lewis flew to Australia to perform 28 sold-out
concerts from Sydney to Perth. At the sixth stop, he went to the
hotel bathroom during the night and for the first time in his life,
he fainted.</TE>
<TE>   His wife heard him fall and called for an ambulance. At the
hospital, doctors suspected spinal meningitis, and they tapped his
spine. Later, Sam told him: "If the ambulance had been 10 minutes
late, you'd have been gone."</TE>
<TE>   He returned to Las Vegas and fought repeated bouts of nausea. The
Labor Day telethon was six weeks away, and no one thought he would
make it. He did. With medical treatment he was able to perform for
"my kids," although he had to return to his dressing room for oxygen
after only eight minutes onstage.</TE>
<TE>   In May 2001, Lewis performed a concert before 20,000 in Chicago.
Afterward, he couldn't catch his breath. He took the red-eye back
home, and his condition worsened. He flew to Houston, where DeBakey
told him the diagnosis: pulmonary fibrosis, an increase of fibrous
tissue in the lungs.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis was assigned nine doctors to handle his case, including one
for diabetes, a condition he developed five years ago.</TE>
<TE>   It could be another year before the lungs heal completely. Among
the drugs prescribed for him was prednisone, a steroid. "It will
repair your lungs, but it also puts 45 pounds on you," Lewis says.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Gets Full Credit</TE>
<TE>   As evidenced by the litter in his office, the Martin and Lewis
book is Jerry's consuming interest right now. It promises to be a
mostly affectionate view of the partnership that began in an Atlantic
City nightclub in 1946 and ended in bitterness 10 years later on a
Hollywood sound stage.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm able to show who the real genius of that act was," Lewis
says, meaning Martin. "I got all the credit for it--'Jerry this,'
'Jerry that.' How my partner took 10 years of that I'll never know.
Probably because he was strong. He had pretty good feelings of
self-worth; he was able to handle it--until he couldn't take it
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Has Mr. Mercurial mellowed with age? Could this be the same jilted
Jerry who didn't speak to Martin for years after Dean walked out on
him? Is this the same surly showman whose sharp tongue has repeatedly
embroiled him in controversy, whether it's feuding with fellow
performers and former studios or lashing out at anyone who criticizes
him?</TE>
<TE>   In 1992 Lewis' charitable crusade, which has raised nearly $2
billion to date, came under fire for portraying muscular dystrophy
patients as "nothing but objects of charity, forever dependent and
forever with a hand out."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis replied angrily that the accusers were a small minority who
"confuse compassion with pity." He was so incensed over claims of
"pity mongering" that he announced he would no longer host the
telethon. He rescinded his threat in time for the 1993 event.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago Lewis stunned an audience gathered to honor his work
in Aspen, Colo., by saying he doesn't like female comics and that he
views a woman as "a producing machine" for children.</TE>
<TE>   But through it all, he fully intends to keep on going, perhaps
breaking fellow comic George Burns' longevity mark of 100 years.</TE>
<TE>   A more realistic goal involves Lewis' daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "She has infused my life with a spirit I've never known could
prevail," he says earnestly. "My sons were very important to me, but
not like that. I need 12 more years. I need to see her graduate from
college. I need to walk her down the aisle. Then I'll say, 'God, I'm
ready to do what you want.' "</TE>

<LD>It's a show about culture, but it is neither a dusty monologue from
some museum docent nor " 'Entertainment Tonight' for the radio,"
according to the host.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Public Radio International's "Studio 360" tries to draw
connections between fine art and pop culture, demonstrate how
high-concept design filters to everyday life, and expose, as the
show's motto says, "where art and real life collide."</LD>
<LD>   "This stuff is not just something that's in museums, it's not in
concert halls, it's on TV and in our bathrooms," said Kurt Andersen,
the voice behind the weekly program--the fastest-growing show on
public radio--which airs Fridays at 3 p.m. on KCRW-FM (89.9).</LD>
<TE>   "The goal for the show is to demonstrate that culture is a kind of
continuous panorama," Andersen said. "We think of culture as being
balkanized niches. It's a disparate fabric, but it's all one fabric.</TE>
<TE>   "The way we're trying to look at it is not in some ivory-tower,
abstract way," he said. "Everybody is welcome."</TE>
<TE>   Andersen, 47, said he sees the typical listener as someone who
would attend a Moby concert one night and go to a museum the next
day, or watch a Spanish art film as well as "Men in Black II."</TE>
<TE>   The hourlong magazine show features a guest and a broad "cover
story" topic each week, such as drugs, outer space, animals or
repetition. This week's program, about toys, features cult comic-book
artist Gary Panter, who was also set designer for television's "Pee
Wee's Playhouse." The show also talks to a virtuoso musician who has
moved from grand piano to toy piano, and has a segment on an artist
who portrays Bible characters and stories in Lego bricks.</TE>
<TE>   Other guests have included Woody Allen talking about the influence
of jazz on American culture, musician Steve Earle talking about
prison life and art, and usually silent magician-comedian Teller
talking about "the artistic urge to create, keep and reveal secrets."
On that same show was a story about coded messages stitched onto
quilts that aided slaves trying to escape through the Underground
Railroad.</TE>
<TE>   "Art and culture programming has historically been kind of stiff,"
said Dean Cappello, vice president of programming at New York's WNYC,
which co-produces the show with PRI, the Minneapolis-based public
radio network. But on "Studio 360," "there isn't this separation
between high and low. We're trying to look at the interesting,
profound ways people are expressing themselves. It's sort of
ear-catching, but it's also substantial."</TE>
<TE>   In a piece about Shakespeare and how his words have infiltrated
every aspect of culture, the show played a clip from an Arnold
Schwarzenegger movie in which he says to the bad guys, "To be, or not
to be? Not to be."</TE>
<TE>   "And then he shoots everybody," Cappello said. The point of the
excerpt was that Shakespeare has "seeped into a lot of different
areas of our lives and is more pervasive than people are aware of."</TE>
<TE>   A recurring segment is "Design for the Real World," which
deconstructs the logic behind everyday items, such as the baseball
cap, the light switch or the telephone ring. For example, according
to a Museum of Modern Art curator, a Post-it note looks the way it
does for two reasons: square, to keep the user's message focused and
concise; and yellow, for urgency.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Andersen's weekly commentary has examined topics
ranging from contemporary composers--"Who are our Brahmses and
Tchaikovskys, the historically important composers of this time? Why
don't we even know their names?"--to the covering of the breast on a
statue at the Department of Justice.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't sound like college professors talking to us," said
Eleanor Harris, senior vice president of syndication at PRI. "Public
radio has done incredibly well at providing really good, objective
information about news and covering things in depth. But sometimes it
can sound dry to people."</TE>
<TE>   That's why public radio has continually tried and failed to create
successful programs about art and culture, she said, and why PRI
spent five years developing "Studio 360." They tinkered with the
title and the format, and tapped Andersen a full year before the show
debuted, in December 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "He's really bright. His intense curiosity is something that
speaks to listeners," Harris said. "He is both well versed in 'high'
art and popular art, and he's really interested in how it all works
together."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Cappello said, "When we started out, I had some
trepidation: 'When so much before us has failed, why do we think this
is going to succeed?' It's more emotional. It has more impact.</TE>
<TE>   "We have listeners who have these big appetites for big ideas.
There's a sort of standard boilerplate idea of culture--fine art,
opera and those kinds of things," he said. "The difference for us is
to take it and bring it into a new form and make it fresh."</TE>
<TE>   That approach has helped make "Studio 360" the fastest-growing
program on public radio, he said. After the show debuted on WNYC, it
went national in March 2001. Now it's heard on 134 stations around
the country by more than 400,000 listeners a week.</TE>
<TE>   "The audiences we have in public radio are smart and engaged and
don't want things served up in the simplest form," Cappello said.
"Where the rest of media is faster, more digested, more wrapped up
with a bow, this show tries to explore the messier things in life. It
really does help you look at the world in a different way."</TE>
<TE>   KCRW was the first station outside New York to carry the program,
in January 2001. The reason, according to station general manager
Ruth Seymour: "Him."</TE>
<TE>   Andersen started his journalism career at Time, winning awards as
a criminal justice and national affairs reporter. He spent eight
years as the magazine's architecture and design critic, and also
wrote a weekly column about culture and the media. He worked as a
cultural columnist for the New Yorker and has written for the New
York Times, the Atlantic Monthly, Rolling Stone, Vanity Fair,
Architectural Record and others. He was editor in chief of New York
magazine and Spy, which he co-founded, and he also co-founded
Inside.com.</TE>
<TE>   He's produced TV shows for ABC and NBC. He authored a satirical
novel, "Turn of the Century" (1999), and is working on another. He
wrote a book of essays, "The Real Thing," and co-wrote an
off-Broadway revue, "Loose Lips."</TE>
<TE>   "I knew who he was and just figured--there are some people you
meet, they have a body of work behind them, and if you figure you're
running a station like KCRW, these are the kinds of people you want
to have on the air," Seymour said.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen said that even though he's never hosted a radio program
before, his previous work gives him insight into diverse subjects.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to draw on all of my experience. I feel I have a little bit
more standing to get under the skin of artists and writers than if I
hadn't tried to do what they do," he said. "The attempt and the wish
every week is to make the connections. And to not make it like
homework."</TE>

<HD>Ray Brown: the Heart of Jazz</HD>
<DH>The bassist who helped give birth to bebop also led young
trios to moments of musical magic. He died Tuesday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ray Brown's last appearance in the Southland took place a month and a
half ago. Leading his trio in the opening set of one of his annual
appearances at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill, he again accomplished one of the
feats of musical magic that characterized his long and productive
career.</LD>
<LD>   When the young members of his group seemed to have difficulty
finding contact with the heart of the music, instead emphasizing
harmonic coloration and fast-paced technical virtuosity, Brown took
charge. Launching into a medley of Ellington-associated tunes, taking
the lead on "Caravan," carving out the groove on "Things Ain't What
They Used to Be," he brought the music to life, transforming a
well-crafted but bland performance into an evening of high-spirited,
inventive jazz.</LD>
<LD>   The transformation was subtle, primarily noticeable in the music's
inner essence, in the feeling of rhythmic lift and drive that he
generated, rather than in any particular change in technical
achievement. At the bottom line, it was the sort of shrewd
metamorphosis, the capacity to trigger the spark of musical vitality,
that was one of the fundamental elements in Brown's creative genius.</LD>
<TE>   What was especially remarkable about that capacity was that it
flowed from the work of a bassist. Rooted at the heart of the rhythm
section, delivering its energy at the lower end of the spectrum of
sound, the instrument--and its players--traditionally played a
supporting role in the early jazz years.</TE>
<TE>   But its image began to change in the late '30s and early '40s
through the performances of Jimmy Blanton with the Duke Ellington
Orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   "Before Jimmy," bassist Arvell Shaw once said, "the bass just kept
time. After Jimmy, the bass could lead the band." He might have added
that, for Brown, the bass did lead the band.</TE>
<TE>   Brown died in Indianapolis on Tuesday. He was 75.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving on the jazz scene a few short years after Blanton's
untimely death in 1942, Brown was well aware--as were his gifted
contemporaries, Charles Mingus and Oscar Pettiford--of both the
opportunity and the freedom that Blanton had established for his
chosen instrument. He honed those qualities in his own playing while
becoming one of the vital participants in the revolutionary arrival
of bebop, a music that richly encouraged imagination, new ideas and
emancipation from the musical establishment.</TE>
<TE>   Moving easily from big bands to small ensembles, comfortably
handling the very different musical demands of each, Brown was an
established, innovative artist by the time he joined Oscar Peterson's
trio in the early '50s. And it was in this setting that he discovered
the musical seeds that would eventually blossom into his own trios.</TE>
<TE>   Like Art Blakey's small bands, Brown's trios became master-class
seminars for musicians lucky enough to participate, especially a
string of gifted pianists: Gene Harris, Benny Green, Geoff Keezer and
Larry Fuller. And the great beauty of working with this legendary
icon was the opportunity to fly freely, comfortably supported by
Brown's rhythmic wind beneath one's musical wings.</TE>
<TE>   On that late May evening at Catalina's, Brown was so alive,
hovering magisterially over his bass, urging his players forward,
smilingly interacting with the enthusiastic crowd, that it's almost
impossible to believe that he is suddenly, stunningly, gone from the
lives of those who loved and admired him, personally and
professionally.</TE>
<TE>   One can only assume that, given the choice, he may well have
elected to go as he did, still at the peak of his musical powers,
actively performing with his trio, taking a nap following an
afternoon game of golf.</TE>
<TE>   But none of that alters the fact that Brown will be missed
mightily, that--with all he had already said musically--there was
still much more that might have been said, that the music has lost
yet another of its great, original voices.</TE>

Recordings</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ray Brown recorded over such a long period of time, in so many
settings, that there are literally dozens of recordings that could be
included in any selective list of his most attractive musical
efforts. Obviously, it's worth checking out any of his numerous
recordings with Oscar Peterson. In addition, here are a few personal
favorites spanning much of his productive career:</LD>
<LD>   * "The Poll Winners" (Contemporary). A state-of-the-jazz-art
recording featuring Brown with guitarist Barney Kessel and drummer
Shelly Manne (1957).</LD>
<LD>   * "This One's for Blanton" (Original Jazz Classics). A lovely
pairing of Brown and, in one of his last outings, Duke Ellington.
(1972).</LD>
<TE>   * "Milt Jackson and Company" (Pablo). Bebop at its finest, with
Brown, Milt Jackson and trombonist J.J. Johnson. (1983).</TE>
<TE>   * "Soular Energy" (Concord Jazz). An early manifestation of the
Brown trio instrumentation, with a set of hard-swinging tunes
featuring pianist Gene Harris (1984).</TE>
<TE>   * "Don't Get Sassy" (Telarc). The trio concept continues with a
youthful Benny Green at the keyboard (1994).</TE>
<TE>   * "Super Bass" (Capri). An all-star bass summit featuring Brown
with Christian McBride and John Clayton (1989).</TE>
<TE>   * "Some of My Best Friends Are ... Singers" (Telarc). One of a
series of "Some of My Best Friends ... ," this one features Diana
Krall, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Kevin Mahogany and others (1998).</TE>

<HD>As Wrecking Ball Looms, It's So Long to Shanghai's SoHo</HD>
<DH>Arts* The city's building binge is wiping out an old
warehouse district that has become home to painters, sculptors and
galleries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN FACKLER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>SHANGHAI, China</DL>
<LD>When painter Ding Yi moved his studio into a decaying warehouse along
Suzhou Creek two years ago, he helped start something new in this
busy business city--an artists' community.</LD>
<LD>   So many painters and sculptors followed that newspapers began
calling the area Shanghai's SoHo, after the artist-loft district in
New York City. Soon, art galleries opened, attracting wealthy Chinese
and foreign collectors.</LD>
<LD>   But a bohemian enclave didn't fit in the city's redevelopment
plans. The Suzhou Creek warehouses, which cover several blocks, are
being torn down to make way for a city planner's vision of modern
urban utopia--a park and hundreds of families in rows of identical
high-rise apartment buildings.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a shame because a community was really taking shape here.
It's going to be hard to just re-create it somewhere else," said
Ding, who has the artist look, with his long hair and black, round
glasses.</TE>
<TE>   The change comes as China's largest city pushes forward with an
ambitious urban face-lift aimed at turning itself into a major
commercial center. But the demolition of the Suzhou Creek warehouses
highlights concerns that development is too heavy-handed.</TE>
<TE>   Since Shanghai's building binge began in the early 1990s, more
than 70,000 old buildings have been torn down every year, according
to city figures.</TE>
<TE>   Downtown, block after block of steeple-roofed tenement housing
from China's early 20th century industrial revolution has
vanished--to be superseded by Space Age glass office towers.</TE>
<TE>   City planners say hundreds of the most beautiful and historical
buildings will be saved.</TE>
<TE>   "But there has to be balance between preservation and development,
and we are still a developing country," said Huang Jiming, chief
engineer at the city government's Shanghai Urban Planning and Design
Research Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Redevelopment plans are laid out by city engineers such as Huang,
sometimes years ahead. In the City Planning Exhibition Hall,
residents crowd around a detailed model of the city in 2020 to see if
their homes will still be standing.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the new buildings are paid for by private investors. This
marriage of central planning and the market has revitalized Shanghai
after decades of neglect under communist founder and leader Mao
Tse-tung, who punished the city for its pre-revolutionary success as
Asia's business capital.</TE>
<TE>   But critics say Shanghai could suffer if not given freedom to grow
spontaneously. They say old neighborhoods should be allowed to
reinvent themselves and find new identities. Diverse neighborhoods
and rich history are what make cities like New York cultural as well
as commercial centers, they say.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be too late when they realize these ruined communities
were things of value that can never be rebuilt," said Lu Yongyi, a
professor of urban planning at Shanghai's Tongji University.</TE>
<TE>   Shanghai is still widely seen as the materialistic, shallow cousin
of Beijing, the political capital. Beijing's universities and art
schools attract the rougher edges of Chinese culture--from punk
rockers to deconstructionist thinkers.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't always this way. As a European-ruled treaty port before
World War II, Shanghai was a magnet for radicals including Mao and
novelist Lu Xun.</TE>
<TE>   A Shanghai cultural revival seemed possible during the 2000
Shanghai Biennale art exhibition, when riskier alternative shows at
Suzhou Creek studios drew more praise than the official entries in
the city's art museum.</TE>
<TE>   The Shanghai SoHo is now home to two major galleries and two dozen
of the city's best-known modern artists.</TE>
<TE>   One of the first to move here was Ding, the painter. He chose an
abandoned British-built cotton warehouse for its low rent and
space--enough to create dozens of wall-size paintings.</TE>
<TE>   He said artists were inspired by the old brick buildings, gritty
streets and tooting of barge traffic on Suzhou Creek, which skirts
the north edge of downtown Shanghai. They shared ideas and tried to
create a Shanghai scene.</TE>
<TE>   "This neighborhood was something that appeared spontaneously
because the setting worked for the artists," Ding said.</TE>
<TE>   Gallery owners and artists talk about creating the same atmosphere
elsewhere but admit it will be difficult to find a suitable
neighborhood. They do not seem to be coordinating efforts to find new
space, perhaps hoping an artists' colony will crop up anew elsewhere
with the same spontaneity.</TE>
<TE>   Ding and others in the Suzhou Creek enclave said officials refused
to speak to them about saving the warehouses.</TE>
<TE>   "We're too small. We're like the ants you discover while cleaning
your kitchen," said Lorenz Helbling, a longtime Swiss resident of
Shanghai who owns ShanghART, a Suzhou Creek gallery that will have to
move.</TE>
<TE>   "City planners just want to clear us out," Helbling said. "But for
us, this is home."</TE>

<HD>Donaldson, Smith Share a Blues Groove at Bakery</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Put alto saxophonist Lou Donaldson and organist Dr. Lonnie Smith
together on the same stage and the results are certain to overflow
with references to the blues, both directly and indirectly. And
that's exactly what happened Wednesday night at the Jazz Bakery.</LD>
<LD>   Donaldson started out as a bopper, like so many saxophonists of
his generation (he is now 75), following closely in the pathway
blazed by Charlie "Bird" Parker. By the '60s, however, he was
revealing a fascination with the then-emerging genre called "soul
jazz"--a kind of predecessor to the funk and blues grooves of later
decades.</LD>
<LD>   It was a lode that Donaldson worked with considerable
success--especially in hits such as "Alligator Boogaloo" and its
follow-ups.</LD>
<TE>   But as his Bakery playing made perfectly clear, he never has
really abandoned the boppish roots that have always been at the base
of his improvisations.</TE>
<TE>   Smith's long association with Donaldson (he was in the band for
the "Alligator Boogaloo" session) has established a smoothly
compatible musical camaraderie between the two artists. Like
Donaldson, Smith is firmly tapped into blues roots, his Hammond B-3
organ playing drenched with theatrical keyboard sweeps and sudden,
dynamic shifts of sound. As always, he was also a dramatic performer,
transforming much of the music into climactic, Wagnerian moments of
intensity.</TE>
<TE>   Supported by guitarist Randy Johnston and drummer Adam Cruz,
Donaldson and Smith testified (that's the best way to describe it) to
the vivid musical life still present in groove-driven blues--in music
that keeps the feet tapping with visceral rhythms without abandoning
the inventive expressiveness essential to the art of jazz
improvisation. It makes for a fascinating, always compelling musical
combination.</TE>

<HD>Durham Nurtures Its Blues Tradition</HD>
<DH>Music* In the 1930s and '40s, the Bull City style
flourished. After nearly dying out, it continues to influence modern
playing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM L. HOLMES</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>DURHAM, N.C.</DL>
<LD>John Dee Holeman spent a lifetime working in tobacco and driving
backhoes while occasionally moonlighting at house parties as a
guitar-picking bluesman who played the Bull City style.</LD>
<LD>   Glenn Hinson, then a student at Duke, came to Holeman's door in
1976 determined to persuade him to play the Eno River Festival.</LD>
<LD>   "I didn't think I was up to it, but he kept encouraging me to try
it," Holeman said.</LD>
<TE>   The invitation resulted in the revival of a Durham blues tradition
first made popular in the 1930s by musicians like Blind Boy Fuller
and the Rev. Gary Davis--two former Durham residents--and one that
has influenced musicians ranging from the Grateful Dead to Garth
Brooks.</TE>
<TE>   Holeman, 73, has gone on to tour worldwide. "A lot of people crazy
about my playing," he said recently.</TE>
<TE>   The style Holeman plays is also called the Piedmont blues, a
lighter, ragtime-influenced version of the somber Mississippi Delta
blues. It is distinguished by complex, two-finger guitar-picking.</TE>
<TE>   The lyrics, written mostly for black audiences of the 1930s and
'40s, touch on universal themes--hard times, booze, women, love.</TE>
<TE>   At that time, Durham was the center of an enormous tobacco
industry. From August to December, white and black farmers from
eastern North Carolina brought their crop here for auction. A trip to
town could last three days while farmers waited to see what price the
leaf would bring. During that time, the visitors would sate their
appetites with moonshine, prostitutes, good food and music, said
Hinson, now head of the folklore department at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</TE>
<TE>   Musicians mixed, with string bands and blues players playing
together regardless of race.</TE>
<TE>   "Music was this place in America, not the only place, but
certainly the most accepted place where all those color lines didn't
have any place," said Scott Ainslie, a blues musician and historian
who lives in Durham.</TE>
<TE>   Fuller, Davis and others, like harmonica player Sonny Terry and
washboardist Bull City Red, made as much in a day during market as
they made in an ordinary week playing at lunchtime outside the
tobacco factories, Hinson said.</TE>
<TE>   For these musicians, many of whom were disabled--Fuller and Davis
were both blind--no other Southern town of the time offered as much
promise.</TE>
<TE>   There is little physical evidence of that promise today. Hinson
pointed out some of the traces on a recent drive through Durham.</TE>
<TE>   A state historical marker dedicated last year on Fayetteville
Street, in the heart of the city's historically black Hayti
neighborhood, pays tribute to the Bull City blues. Nearby, the city
has its own marker near Fuller's gravesite.</TE>
<TE>   Fuller, the most prominent figure in the Piedmont blues, recorded
more than 130 songs, and his "Step It Up and Go" became a staple for
most bluesmen in the country, Ainslie said.</TE>
<TE>   Hinson can point out the double-shotgun house on Colfax Street
where Fuller lived before his death in 1941 of a kidney ailment when
he was in his early 30s.</TE>
<TE>   An unfinished clapboard house used as a juke joint in the 1930s
still stands on Chapel Hill Road about halfway between Durham and
Chapel Hill, a reminder of the raucous parties where the musicians
experimented with their sound while couples danced.</TE>
<TE>   World War II and the change in musical styles led to the
near-demise of the blues scene in Durham.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the Hayti Heritage Center is keeping the music alive with
its annual Bull Durham Blues Festival in September, setting aside
stage time for aging players such as Etta Baker and Holeman.</TE>
<TE>   "We're definitely looking at the last of the old cats," Ainslie
said.</TE>
<TE>   The music will live much longer in its influence on modern music,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Terry and fellow musician Brownie McGhee left Durham for New York
about the time of Fuller's death. There they ran a teaching studio
and mingled with Pete Seeger, Ry Cooder and other white musicians of
the 1960s folk revival.</TE>
<TE>   Modern country music also has some elements of Piedmont blues,
with the twangy guitar solos of Garth Brooks' recordings echoing
Fuller's rags of 60 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "This area played a pivotal role in how guitars are handled,"
Ainslie said.</TE>
<TE>   Holeman plucked out his first tunes as a child while waiting
overnight for the family's tobacco crop to cure. He picked up more
after coming to Durham.</TE>
<TE>   He has developed his own style since then, adding elements of jazz
and Delta blues, but he still recognizes his Durham roots.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very proud of it, to keep it going," he said. "I made a few
bucks at it too."</TE>

<HD>The Voices of Palestine</HD>
<DH>A Ramallah theater troupe visits with a show that shares
what its subtitle describes as 'Stories Under Occupation'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALLAN M. JALON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shortly before arriving in this country last month, Palestinian actor
Imad Farajin saw a newspaper photograph of a Palestinian boy sleeping
as he sat on a large, sun-splashed rock near an Israeli checkpoint he
was not allowed to cross.</LD>
<LD>   Behind him stood an Israeli soldier, holding a gun.</LD>
<LD>   Farajin says he imagined the boy to be "dreaming of a better life
in which he could go where he wants, do what he wants," adding, "I
wondered what Americans would think of this boy."</LD>
<TE>   Palestinian dreams and Palestinian despair are what Farajin and
nine of his colleagues with the Ramallah-based Al Kasaba Theatre have
put into "Alive From Palestine," a series of monologues and scenes
the actors have drawn from their daily experiences during recent
waves of conflict. They will present the show, subtitled "Stories
Under Occupation," Friday evening at the La Mirada Theatre, before
heading north for another one-time showing Sunday, at San Francisco's
Palace of Fine Arts. The performers enact their dreamlike
narratives--they bear overtones of Isaac Babel short stories and the
political theater of Bertolt Brecht--in Arabic, but English
translations appear on screens at the side of the stage.</TE>
<TE>   The actors arrived in Los Angeles this week after a run of five
performances at the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven, Conn., where the
production was part of the seventh International Festival of Arts and
Ideas, an 18-day, state-funded offering of dance, music and theater
from around the world. The Palestinians' appearance there provoked
debate and drew high praise.</TE>
<TE>   Well before Al Kasaba arrived in the United States, members of New
Haven's Jewish community divided over the very idea of a production
that they worried depicted a purely Palestinian point of view. Others
called it superb art. Festival managers combined the show with panel
discussions and lectures describing Jewish perspectives. The New York
Times ultimately ran a review that fervently recommended "a
plaintive, almost supplicating" production showing "a terrible
helplessness and sadness and an anger that is provoked by what feels
like oppression."</TE>
<TE>   The group's California trip is being paid for by several Arab
American and Palestinian-oriented organizations: American Friends of
Palestine, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee and
Humanity on Hold. Humanity on Hold's Web site depicts events in the
Middle East from a Palestinian point of view, including an image of
an Israeli soldier with the words "Born to Kill" etched on his
helmet. The site includes a Web memorial, a list of hundreds of
names, including Jewish ones, of people who have died in the last 22
months.</TE>
<TE>   Nicole Ballivian, a film producer in Hollywood who conceived of
the visit, says she raised $24,000 for it because her husband, Bashar
Daas, has acted with the group and because "it is important to put a
human face on what everybody is seeing in the news. Americans don't
know what living under occupation is."</TE>
<TE>   Several of the actors gathered in the enveloping coolness of the
bar area of the Holiday Inn in Hollywood this week to talk about the
intimately painful connections between their lives and their art. The
production, which consists of material the actors wrote themselves,
is unlike anything Al Kasaba had done in its more than three decades
as a leading Palestinian theater. Over a nine-month period, starting
after the second intifada erupted on Sept. 28, 2000, they created
hundreds of pieces about life under siege, from which they selected
the 13 in the show.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Farajin, 26, other actors from the group who
gathered for a collective interview about its tale of war and art
included Georgina Asfour, 25; Khalifa Natour, 37; and Hasam Abu
Eisheh, 43. They were joined by Amir Nizar Zuabi, 25, the director
and designer of the show, and George Ibrahim, general director of the
Al Kasaba Theatre. Most of them live on the West Bank or in
Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   Al Kasaba, which has a 400-seat theater in Ramallah, and another
with 100 seats in Jerusalem, traditionally works as a conventional
repertory theater, putting on productions of Shakespeare, Arthur
Miller, Max Frisch and other writers. After the uprising started
nearly two years ago, the theater became the site for readings of
poems and stories in honor of the rapidly increasing number of dead.</TE>
<TE>   At first, residents of Ramallah came to express their grief and
anger, but the evenings slowly turned into encounters between an
audience and performers from the theater. The actors began writing
their own stories of people who filled the theater and those beyond
it, stories in which human grief often mixed with bleak humor: lovers
trying to meet despite checkpoints, giving each other poison-gas
canisters and bullets as romantic gifts; parents separated from
children, sometimes at the funerals of children.</TE>
<TE>   One sketch inspired during that time tells of a woman who buys a
tin of olives, only to find they are rubber bullets. Another is about
a woman on a telephone who panics at seeing a missile come in one
window, only to sigh with relief at watching it go out another.</TE>
<TE>   "We added on layer after layer," says Zuabi. "We added a thematic
layer, and the dramaturgy of the inner piece got better and better."
Asfour wrote about her brother, shot as he drove the family through
an Israeli checkpoint.</TE>
<TE>   Her brother, driving Asfour and her sister, had just passed
through an Israeli checkpoint on the way from Jerusalem to Bethlehem.
"The bullet entered through the trunk, through the back seat and
through him."</TE>
<TE>   Though he had been hit in what is generally considered a resilient
part of the anatomy, it was a pretty serious injury. He had to go to
the hospital. Asfour says her sister, next to her in the backseat,
would have been hit had Asfour not been holding her close because it
was cold. "Who shot him? We don't know. But we saw other cars that
had all been shot at the checkpoint." In one of the play's
monologues, she tells how such things have become normal.</TE>
<TE>   During the interview, she recited the section in Arabic, in a
lilting voice: a song of resignation.</TE>
<TE>   "Death has become normal, and / bleeding has become normal too.
Fear and despair are normal / The checkpoints are closed? It's
normal, we'll go round the back, what do we care..../ My brother had
a bullet in his behind? Normal...."</TE>
<TE>   One day, in the old city of Jerusalem, Eisheh overheard an
exchange between a woman on a cell phone with an older son calling
from London--just after the funeral of her younger son. The woman put
on a bright face to sustain her own faith and give courage to her
son. She does so, performed by Eisheh, in the play. Each time she
relates more bad news--that the caller's uncle is in jail, that her
brother has been shot, that his sister has been divorced--she repeats
the phrase "praise God." "Your Uncle Jawad, I didn't tell you. / Your
Uncle Jawad was martyred / but praise God his kids are all right. /
The little one was shot / in the eye but he's all right...."</TE>
<TE>   "I heard this woman in the old city, and there was a power in
her," Eisheh said in the interview. "There was a power to survive."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the stories are fables. An Arab pleads with King Solomon,
the biblical King of the Jews, to take his people away from the
embattled land of modern Israel. The actor pleads: "Don't return my
white donkey / King Solomon. Just take / your people away from here.
/ We don't want anything from them. Just take them away and relieve
us."</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, this show insists on the Palestinian perspective. There
is no direct mention of suicide bombers. One piece talks of an
explosion, a person who declares, "they've hollowed me out ... wow, a
big hole, if you look inside / you'll see I have become a red
waterfall. I traveled tick-tick-tick / from the world. Bye-bye me."
The reference could be to a suicide bomber--or it might be the bloody
explosiveness of the whole Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   When the New Haven festival was being planned, its director, Mary
Miller, responded to the first rumblings of controversy by bringing
the script to local Rabbi Herbert Brockman. Says Brockman: "My first
reaction was, 'They're making theater in Ramallah! How wonderful!' It
is better to be expressing oneself through art than violence. I read
the script and I came away thinking that this was fine art."</TE>
<TE>   Others reacted more fiercely, sensing that the play portrayed
Israelis as the enemy and because Palestinians who die from Israeli
weapons are depicted as "martyrs." In the end, the festival combined
the play with the presentations that put it into a larger context of
Jewish views and history. About 40 sign-carrying protesters showed up
at the performances.</TE>
<TE>   "It is painful to watch for anyone who identifies with Israel,"
Professor Steven Fraade, who teaches ancient Jewish history at Yale,
says of the production. He had heard rumors that it was anti-Israel
but concluded that the piece was "not propaganda."</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in Hollywood, members of the troupe were divided about
what happened in New Haven. "It was a circus," says Zuabi, the
director. The play, he says, was swallowed by the Jewish community's
determination to turn a human statement into a political debate. "The
play is art. It is shaped by political circumstances, yes, but it is
art." Ibrahim takes a mellower view. "We came to the heart of the
lion. We came to America, and we brought this to where the American
Jewish people live. We had to accept that."</TE>
<TE>   From San Francisco, the troupe will take "Alive From Palestine" to
London for 11 performances, then to Sweden. But they probably will
not perform at home for quite a while. The region is in turmoil. It
is hard for people to get to the theater amid the curfews and
checkpoints. The future of the Al Kasaba Theatre, like the rest of
the Mideast, is uncertain. Ibrahim has long hoped to start a theater
school, but can't see it happening soon.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth," he says, "is that no matter what dramas we put on the
stage, what happens in real life is much more dramatic."</TE>

<HD>UCLA Live's New Season Has Quality Look</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You can say this about David Sefton: He's adaptable. After taking
some strong hits--including some from this column--regarding the
programming he devised for his first season as UCLA performing arts
director, he has been quick to correct some of his earlier missteps
by presenting a vastly improved UCLA Live schedule for the 2002-'03
season.</LD>
<LD>   The jazz and world-music choices are distinct levels up from last
year's on-again, off-again selections. And, to give credit where
credit is due, Sefton was correct when he noted at last week's news
conference that "we only had a few months to put that schedule
together, and in the arts-presenting world, tours are often in place
a year ahead of time."</LD>
<LD>   The problem with the 2001-'02 season, in fact, had less to do with
quality than with quantity and emphasis. Arriving from a
high-visibility London arts background that was strongly engaged with
pop culture, Sefton's initial approach to jazz and world-music
scheduling led many to wonder whether UCLA's historically strong
association with these genres would be left behind or experience
dramatic shifts in accent.</LD>
<TE>   It didn't help to alter that view when he opened the season by
joining the Mingus Jazz Orchestra and artist-in-residence Elvis
Costello in a shotgun marriage of disparate entities. Nor did the
paucity of world-music artists and the seeming lack of promotional
interest in their appearances seem to bode well for their future at
UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   But we can be thankful for adaptability. The 2002-'03 schedule
restores both world music and jazz to prominent positions. And the
choices--with one caveat--are generally first-rate, sometimes more
than that.</TE>
<TE>   The "more than that" category belongs to the Dave Holland Big Band
(Oct. 3), perhaps the least high-visibility act on the schedule, but
one with a great potential for creative payoff. There is also a
largely successful effort to cover a wide range of stylistic areas in
the lineup, ranging from Herbie Hancock (March 26) and Pat Metheny
(Nov. 16) to Bireli Lagrene (March 13) and a group of musicians (Bebo
Valdes, Eliane Elias, etc.) from the Latin-jazz documentary "Calle
54" (Oct. 10). Capping off the jazz schedule, there's an
appearance--look out for emotional fireworks--by eccentric jazz diva
Nina Simone (March 7).</TE>
<TE>   "We think that's a big step forward from last year's program,"
says Sefton, "and a real indication of how we view the importance of
jazz."</TE>
<TE>   In the world-music arena, similarly good choices prevail in a
dramatic expansion of bookings, topped by appearances by Brazilian
singer-songwriter Caetano Veloso (Oct. 29 and 30), the magical voice
of Malian Salif Keita (Nov. 2), Senegalese master Youssou N'Dour (May
1), and cellist Yo-Yo Ma with the Silk Road Project (Nov. 1).</TE>
<TE>   Other entries in the eclectic list of performers include Israeli
folk singer Chava Alberstein (Oct. 1), legendary Cuban singer Pablo
Milanes (Nov. 21), the Kodo drummers (Feb. 4-6), the Afro-Cuban All
Stars (Nov. 14), Palestinian artist Simon Shaheen and Quantara (March
9), sitarists Vilayat Khan and Shujaat Husain Khan (May 8), the
Orquestra Ibrahim Ferrer (April 1 and 2), the European klezmer band
Kol Simcha (March 16) and a calypso evening featuring the Mighty
Sparrow, Calypso Rose and David Rudder (Oct. 12).</TE>
<TE>   That's a strikingly impressive group of global artists. But let's
go back to that slight caveat mentioned above.</TE>
<TE>   It's this: What is missing in the programming for both genres is
the sort of envelope-stretching, thematically expansive efforts that
are in other areas of the UCLA Live calendar, especially dance and
theater. Misguided though the combining of Costello and the Mingus
orchestra may have been last year, it at least represented an attempt
to bring some out-of-the-box thinking to the presentation of jazz.</TE>
<TE>   More would be welcome. Sefton, with his European perspective, is
surely aware of the existence of such innovative ensembles as Italy's
Instabile Orchestra, France's Orchestra National de Jazz, Holland's
Willem Breuker Kollektief and Austria's Vienna Art Orchestra (to name
only a few), as well as the many fascinating performers who record
for German's ECM label. If UCLA (aided, one would hope, by the
appropriate national consulates) can't bring these compelling groups
to American audiences, who can?</TE>
<TE>   In this country, one doesn't have to look any further than the
artists who appear at Rocco's cutting-edge jazz room in Hollywood or
who are recorded locally by companies such as Cryptogramophone to
find some fascinatingly inventive music. And if Sefton--who seems
eager to bring younger listeners to UCLA programs--wants to expand
that desire to jazz, all he has to do is check out the audiences who
turn out for any appearances by, say, guitarist Charlie Hunter or the
ensemble Medeski, Martin &amp; Wood.</TE>
<TE>   In world music, the 2002-'03 schedule already includes Tabla Beat
Science, with its intriguing combination of Zakir Hussain and Ustad
Sultan Khan with Bill Laswell and Karsh Kale. More of this mixing and
matching would be welcome.</TE>
<TE>   Sefton clearly has interest in all these areas, but he also
pointed out that he has only now completed his first full season of
programming, learning and building as he goes.</TE>
<TE>   "We're really only beginning," he said. "But if we do it right,
you can expect the next season to be another step forward."</TE>

<TE>   Music Ed: Boston's Berklee College of Music has been offering
prime music education since the late 1940s, with a list of alumni
that includes hundreds of artists, functioning in every area of the
music business. Later this month, from July 21 to 27, Berklee in L.A.
will kick off its 13th season at Claremont-McKenna College in
Claremont. The program offers instrumental and vocal instruction,
ensemble work, improvisation and harmony classes, performance
opportunities, and faculty clinics to 250 young musicians (starting
at age 15).</TE>
<TE>   Local students who have passed through the program include tenor
saxophonist Teodross Avery ('95), who made his debut as a leader on
the GRP label a few days before his 21st birthday; Kendrick Oliver
('95), who formed the "New Life Orchestra" while he was still a
Berklee student; and drummer Abe Laboriel Jr. ('93), who performed
recently on television with the bands of Sting and Paul McCartney.</TE>
<TE>   Berklee in L.A. students have the opportunity to audition for
scholarships to attend Berklee as full-time students. Since the
Berklee in L.A. program began in 1990, the college has awarded more
than $550,000 in scholarships to participants. The session wraps up
on July 26 with a student "carnival" of events including a vocal
cabaret, ensemble concerts and guitar concerts on the Claremont
campus. Information: (909) 592-0500.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   H.M.I. Ed: The Henry Mancini Institute offers a vastly different
summer program aimed at older, professionally active musicians,
mostly in their 20s. This year, in its sixth installment, the Mancini
Institute will be directed by musician-composer Patrick Williams. The
season will be dedicated to Jack Elliot, founder and director of the
organization, who died last summer.</TE>
<TE>   The monthlong program provides scholarships to 84 musicians
selected by audition from more than 15 countries and 55 cities in the
U.S.. They will perform in a series of concerts at UCLA's Royce Hall
from July 27 through a final fund-raiser Aug. 17. Among the guest
artists are bassists Christian McBride and John Clayton, clarinetist
Eddie Daniels, organist Larry Goldings, trumpeter Randy Brecker, the
Peter Erskine Trio, guitarist Lee Ritenour, pianists Billy Childs,
Roger Kellaway and Dave Grusin, and flutist Hubert Laws. Information
regarding the free concert series: (310) 845-1900 or www.

<HD>Neil Finn Stands Ready to Ride Pop-Rock's Roots-Revival
Wave</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One big part of the appeal of such fast-rising freshman bands as the
Strokes, the Vines and the Hives is their common respect for the
craft of songwriting and unapologetic love of pop melody.</LD>
<LD>   If this does indicate a public shift from music of anger and
aggression back toward insightful and relentlessly catchy pop-rock,
Neil Finn, one of the modern masters of pop-rock songwriting, will
certainly be armed to cash in.</LD>
<LD>   Just this year, the New Zealander has put out two solo albums--one
live, one recorded in a studio--overflowing with the seamless lyrical
and melodic inventiveness that has distinguished his music for two
decades.</LD>
<TE>   On Wednesday at the House of Blues in Anaheim, the second show on
a new tour leg that also stops at that chain's West Hollywood club
tonight and Saturday, Finn built a magnificent two-hour show around
material from the more recent release, the 2-month-old "One All."</TE>
<TE>   Inspired support came from many of the same musicians who have
been at his shows since last year, including former Smiths
guitarist-songwriter Johnny Marr and ex-Prince sidekick Wendy
Melvoin, who has collaborated as a songwriter with Finn recently.</TE>
<TE>   His new songs constitute something so strong, it mattered little
how lightly he touched on his formidable catalog from his days in
Crowded House and Split Enz, though a solo performance of House's
"Fall at Your Feet" was arguably the evening's high point.</TE>
<TE>   It also was one of the rare instances in which an audience
sing-along transcended mere nostalgic familiarity to become a
bone-chilling example of spiritual redemption through communal
music-making.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Neil Finn plays tonight and Saturday at House of Blues, 8430
Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood. With Ed Harcourt. 9 p.m. $23. (213)
848-5100.</TE>

<HD>Just Grab a Magazine From the TV Screen</HD>
<DH>Cable* A new video-on- demand service lets subscribers
choose shows based on more than two dozen subject areas, updated
monthly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRAZIER MOORE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>You've put in a hard day. Now you're ready to chill in front of the
TV and watch some basket-weaving. Or maybe you've got a taste for
outer space. Or Shakespeare.</LD>
<LD>   What are the odds you could click to a show devoted to that
interest whenever you get the urge?</LD>
<LD>   It's a slam-dunk thanks to a new cable TV service called Mag Rack,
which, although available so far to just a tiny audience, is a
reminder that video on demand is a reality after years of delays.</LD>
<TE>   The Mag Rack concept is simple. Navigate to the Mag Rack channel.
Choose from more than two dozen topics, including bird-watching,
wedding tips, "Wine World" and "The Bible and You."</TE>
<TE>   Then, within each of these "magazines," the viewer can select any
of several stories, all available as video on demand--which means you
can select the program, pause, rewind and fast-forward it, all
through your cable box.</TE>
<TE>   Ready? "Welcome to 'Maximum Science,' " an announcer intones,
"bringing you the latest in science when you want to see it." And on
your TV screen you see a menu of stories (or would that be a table of
contents?) with a scientific bent.</TE>
<TE>   Each subject area is replenished by a new "issue" of Mag
Rack-produced programming (an hour or more, "chapterized" into
blocks) each month, while past "issues" are archived on the cable
operator's computer server.</TE>
<TE>   In short, Mag Rack seems to be a pretty faithful video equivalent
of the newsstand-browsing experience combined with the sporadic way
most people like to read their magazines--with the added advantage
that Mag Rack is typically packaged free with the subscriber's
premium service.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought there were large constituencies of viewers who were
very passionate about certain subjects but were being underserved by
television, even in the 500-channel universe," says Matthew Strauss,
Mag Rack's general manager.</TE>
<TE>   Though it might not warrant "a 24-7 digital network," he adds,
"each of those micro-niches might be perfect for a VOD service."</TE>
<TE>   Currently the 9-month-old Mag Rack is seen only by Long Island,
N.Y., subscribers of Cablevision (parent of Mag Rack as well as the
Bravo and American Movie Classics networks), which has announced that
in the next few months Mag Rack will also come to areas served by
Insight Communications, focused in the Midwest.</TE>
<TE>   A Satellite Killer?</TE>
<TE>   Video on demand-enabled digital subscribers are a tiny fragment of
the nation's 100-million-plus TV households. But the number is
growing: An estimated total of 6 million by the end of 2002 is
expected to double a year later.</TE>
<TE>   A recent headline in Electronic Media magazine raised the
question, "Is VOD cable's satellite killer?"</TE>
<TE>   In any case, digitally upgrading systems is one way the cable
industry is fighting against rivals like DirecTV, whose services are
often bundled with TiVo-like recorders that can store
satellite-delivered programming for future playback.</TE>
<TE>   Direct-broadcast satellite systems also offer pay-per-view
programming at frequent intervals. But full on-demand capability
isn't possible so far.</TE>
<TE>   On cable, most video on demand consists of movies and other
programming (like HBO) already available on other channels. That
redundancy factor sets Mag Rack apart, says Strauss--"We are
producing content for this new VOD technology and only for VOD."</TE>
<TE>   Industry observers are voicing early approval for Mag Rack.</TE>
<TE>   "It's ... one more way of differentiating themselves from
satellite," says Adi Kishore, an analyst with the Yankee Group in
Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Whether viewers who can get Mag Rack will watch it is another
matter. Kishore cited figures from late 2001 indicating that of five
customers with a video on demand system, only one had tried it.</TE>
<TE>   Strauss argues that Mag Rack is a great way to explain video on
demand's possibilities to newcomers.</TE>
<TE>   "We want them to perceive it as more than just a mechanism--taking
programming and sticking it on a server--but as a branded editorial
service that becomes synonymous with VOD," he says.</TE>

<LD>   Julia Roberts Weds in Midnight Ceremony</LD>
<LD>   In a move that will warm the hearts of cameramen all over
Hollywood, actress Julia Roberts married her cameraman boyfriend
Daniel Moder early Thursday in a midnight ceremony held at her
40-acre estate outside Taos, N.M.</LD>
<TE>   The wedding marks Roberts' second trip down the aisle. The Oscar
winner for "Erin Brocko- vich" was previously married for 21 months
to country-and-western singer Lyle Lovett.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts' publicist, Marcy Engelman, confirmed the wedding but
declined to give any details about the couple's nuptials, the bride's
attire or the guest list.</TE>
<TE>   Harrison Attacker Released From Clinic</TE>
<TE>   A paranoid schizophrenic who stabbed former Beatle George Harrison
on what he thought was a "mission from God" was conditionally
released from a psychiatric hospital in Liverpool, England, Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   A panel of experts said Michael Abram, 35, was fit to be released
from the Scott Clinic. Abram, who has a history of mental illness,
was accused of breaking into Harrison's home in Henley-on-Thames and
stabbing him repeatedly, puncturing a lung. He also was charged with
attacking Olivia Harrison when she came to her husband's defense. He
was tried for attempted murder but acquitted in November 2000 on the
grounds of insanity.</TE>
<TE>   George Harrison died of cancer Nov. 29, 2001.</TE>

<TE>   Bill Clinton Addresses AIDS Crisis on MTV</TE>
<TE>   Former President Bill Clinton will return to MTV 10 years after
his famous saxophone performance to address the global AIDS epidemic.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton will be one of several panelists taking questions from an
audience of young adults from more than 25 countries during the
hourlong program "Staying Alive: A Global Youth Forum on HIV/AIDS,"
to be taped July 11 in Barcelona, Spain. The special will be telecast
July 12 on more than 30 MTV channels around the world.</TE>
<TE>   The program is part of a new youth-oriented AIDS awareness
campaign MTV is launching in conjunction with the Kaiser Family
Foundation and Family Health International. A United Nations report
issued Tuesday predicts that more than 68 million people will die of
AIDS in the next two decades unless massive intervention efforts are
begun immediately.</TE>

<TE>   'Ararat' to Open Toronto Film Fest</TE>
<TE>   Atom Egoyan's controversial new film, "Ararat," will kick off the
opening-night gala at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival,
which runs Sept. 5-14.</TE>
<TE>   "Ararat," Egoyan's third festival opener, recounts the alleged
whitewashing of the 1915-17 mass killing of 1.3 million Armenians
under the Ottoman Empire.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement read by actor David Alpay, one of the film's stars,
Egoyan, who has Armenian heritage, said "Ararat" is a meditation on a
new reality since the last festival--a reference to the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "I am convinced ... that the film will provide the opening-night
audience with an emotionally loaded event," said the
41-year-old-director, whose movie credits include "The Sweet
Hereafter" and "Felicia's Journey."</TE>
<TE>   "Ararat" has been the subject of criticism and threats of protests
from Turkish groups that insist an Armenian genocide never happened
or that its extent has been exaggerated.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Deborah Norville will be the guest co-anchor of CBS' ''The Early
Show" next week. Norville, currently host of "Inside Edition," last
anchored a network morning show during her short-lived stint on
"Today," which ended in 1991.... A $50,000 donation from Bruce
Springsteen will pay for repairs at several playgrounds in the
artist's adopted hometown of Asbury Park, N.J. He'll join the E
Street Band for a performance from the city's boardwalk on NBC's
"Today" show July 30 to mark the release of his latest album, "The
Rising." KCRW-FM (89.9) will air a special episode of National Public
Radio's "Jazz Profiles" honoring Rosemary Clooney today from 7 to 8
p.m. The program will include interviews with Clooney, who died last
Saturday, Linda Ronstadt, Dave Frishberg, Jack Sheldon and others....
''Sex and the City'' star Cynthia Nixon confirmed Wednesday that she
is expecting her second child with longtime boyfriend Danny Mozes at
the end of the year. HBO says the pregnancy will not affect the
program's shooting schedule.... Actor-comedian Tom Arnold, co-host of
Fox Sports Network's "Best Damn Sports Show Period," married
girlfriend Shelby Roos in a ceremony held Saturday at the Four
Seasons Hotel.... Chris Rock and wife Malaak Compton-Rock welcomed
the arrival of a daughter, Lola Simone, in New York. It is the first
child for both.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The term "alternative" has less relevance than ever in contemporary
art discourse. Alternative to what? In this anything-goes cultural
moment--call it pluralistic, democratic, indiscriminate--there is no
single mainstream from which to deviate.</LD>
<LD>   Technically speaking, it's hard even to think of a substance that
has not yet been rendered an artistic medium, from chocolate to soap,
vacuum cleaners to elephant dung, fingernails to dryer lint. Given
this leveled state of affairs, the title of White Room's current
show, "Contemporary Alternative Photography," might seem gratuitous,
but it's not. Not only does the show contain some extraordinary work,
but it identifies a phenomenon within photographic practice that has
everything to do with purposeful distance from the norm.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly all of the 13 artists included belong to what Lyle Rexer,
author of several books on art and photography, has dubbed
"Photography's Antiquarian Avant-Garde." They use old photographic
processes, or variants thereof, to make images that straddle the 19th
and 21st centuries. Photography's already complex engagement with
time thickens and intensifies in work so insistently of the past and
the present.</LD>
<TE>   Deborah Luster's stunning portraits illustrate just how the layers
of significance build. Luster prints her small-scale images (5 by 4
inches) in silver gelatin on aluminum, a format reminiscent of the
tintype. Invented in 1856, tintypes were small, unique prints on
prepared metal plates. Cheap and readily available, they became
extremely popular during the Civil War, as soldiers could have them
made in the field and sent home to loved ones.</TE>
<TE>   Luster's pictures have an elegance their predecessors generally
lacked, but a similar stark, haunting presence. Her subjects, men and
women, black and white, are prisoners in three Louisiana correctional
facilities. They present themselves with sobriety (even when in
Halloween or Mardi Gras costumes) and the dignity of the
self-possessed. Though formally posed, the portraits feel intimate.
Like tintypes, they beg to be held, as their subjects, lost to
distance and circumstance, cannot be.</TE>
<TE>   Another compelling body of work here, by Raymond Meeks, represents
athletes competing in the 2002 Winter Olympics. His ambrotype
portraits (made by backing a glass negative with an opaque material)
are wonderfully shadowy and oblique. Long on character and short on
information, they reverse the conventional formula used in making
these faces known to the public.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the two action shots here (printed on paper from wet
collodion negatives, a dominant process from the 1850s to the 1880s)
are deliciously anachronistic. The process harks from an era of bulky
cameras and long exposures; the subjects--luge and cross-country
skiing--are sports whose performances are measured in milliseconds
and documented accordingly.</TE>
<TE>   By shifting to an obsolete process, Meeks enacts a change in our
frame of reference, re-invoking a sense of awe and wonder at the
speed of human locomotion. The luge image, with its bullet-like rider
and slightly tilted spectators, brings to mind Jacques Lartigue's
charming early 20th century photographs of racing cars.</TE>
<TE>   White Room's show is dense with marvels like these--lovely
photogravures of scenes in Japan by Peter Miller; palladium prints by
James Pitts that recall the distilled beauty of Karl Blossfeldt's
studies of plant forms; Tsutomu Otsuko's intriguing silver prints
toned by the action of earth and water; precious botanical images in
ambrotype by France Scully Osterman, and more.</TE>
<TE>   Solarized photomontages from the 1940s through the 1970s by the
late Edmund Teske are interesting though quirky inclusions in an
otherwise contemporary gathering. Olivia Parker's digital Nash prints
pull the show in yet another direction, toward the future, but the
soul of this show is in the past, nearer to photography's origins as
a hybrid of science, art and magic.</TE>

<TE>   White Room Gallery, 8810 Melrose Ave., West Hollywood, (310)
859-2402, through July 13. Closed Sunday and Monday.</TE>
<TE>   A Different Kind of Family Album</TE>
<TE>   Guiding Chris Verene's photographs of family, friends and
neighbors in his hometown of Galesburg, Ill., are equal parts
affection and affectation.</TE>
<TE>   Verene has been recording the lives of his extended circle for 15
years, and the tenderness implicit in that commitment sneaks into
some of the pictures themselves--especially those showing people
caring for others, worrying about them or mourning them. But in the
selection now at Rose Gallery, one can see strategy at work, a
stylistic strategy that gives Verene's humanism a bit of an edge.</TE>
<TE>   Verene shoots in color and writes identifying captions on the
pictures' wide white borders. The scenes (portraits and interiors,
mainly) are harshly lighted, like old flashbulb pictures. In book
form as well as on the wall, the series reads like a family album, a
chronicle made by an insider, primarily for domestic use.</TE>
<TE>   It's contrived to look amateurish, which gives it a kind of
backhanded charm. Verene identifies characters--tough, preteen Billy;
the cooler, older Josh; beleaguered cousin Steve and his sad-faced
little girl; Grandpa Bill, the lonely widower--and fleshes out their
stories through sequences that show us their homes as well as their
problems. Billy lives in a room where the walls are scarred with
graffiti more befitting a bus bench than a young boy's bedroom.
Steve's wife left the family to live in a women's shelter. Relatives

<TE>   Celebratory pictures of new babies being tossed and the family
gathered around the breakfast table on Christmas morning leaven the
mood, but only slightly. No ordinary family album would focus on so
much compromise. Verene (who now lives in Brooklyn) may love his
hometown and its citizens, but it's a love vexed by distance and a
superior education.</TE>
<TE>   It's not insignificant that Verene credits acerbic social
commentator Larry Fink for giving him confidence. He must have needed
a good deal of emotional stamina to construct such a grim, barbed
homage to the place he called home.</TE>

<TE>   The Multiple Resonance of Collage</TE>
<TE>   If collage tends to function as a tribute to the preexisting, how
fitting that one collage artist would use another as raw matter with
which to build his own work. Ray Johnson did just that with Joseph
Cornell--not with Cornell's work as much as with his persona.
Johnson, Cornell and Hannelore Baron represent "Three Approaches to
Collage" in a handsome, nicely crafted show by that name at Manny
Silverman Gallery.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson (1927-1995) and Baron (1926-1987) were contemporaries, a
generation younger than Cornell (1903-1972). Drawing from the realms
of literature, science, astronomy and cinema, Cornell made deeply
personal, poetic works in collage and box assemblage.</TE>
<TE>   Not many of the Cornell collages in this show would elicit much
zeal on their own, but all of them profit from the Cornell
mystique--that of a man who lived quietly, modestly, folding his
yearnings and fantasies into art.</TE>
<TE>   Part of Johnson's art practice consisted of "mail art," sent to
his friends and personal heroes. Cornell figured prominently in that
pantheon. Johnson's collages here--which incorporate Cornell's
silhouette, a drawing of a daffodil placed on his grave and a scrap
identified as an inkblot found in the artist's trash--double as fan
letters and private scrapbook pages, giddy meditations on the
master's glory.</TE>
<TE>   Baron's work stands apart from Cornell's and Johnson's in its
reliance on an abstract symbology rather than on recognizable
snippets from the wider culture. Baron moved to the U.S. from Germany
as a teenager during World War II--though, not knowing this, one
would still be able to discern a current of loss and melancholy in
the work.</TE>
<TE>   Her collages consist of scraps of fabric and fragments of her own
etchings, inked notations just beyond decipherability and lines drawn
as if to stitch all the pieces together. The colors in them seem
weary, and the textures, too, as if their lives had already been
fully lived before Baron invited them back in for another round.</TE>

<TE>   Dots and DabsThat Cast a Spell</TE>
<TE>   Like the exclamation points that follow every comment, however
mundane, in comic-strip speech, Cadence Giersbach's painting style
forces exuberance onto ordinary subjects. The New York-based
Giersbach, in her first L.A. solo show at Sandroni Rey, paints a pair
of palm trees against a wall, a topiary bush, a parked airplane, a
girl with tulips. None of the scenes is remarkable in itself, but
Giersbach renders them in a way that's at least momentarily dazzling.</TE>
<TE>   The images are broken down into discrete color forms, thousands of
them, from tiny amoeba shapes to broad areas. Like peas and
applesauce on a child's plate, the colors touch but don't blend. The
eye and the brain do the work reflexively to mix the colors and
create the illusion of depth, as in digital imaging, where
information is broken down into tiny constituent parts, and also in
the painting tradition of pointillism.</TE>
<TE>   Giersbach's clean-edged shapes and slick enamel surfaces call to
mind another tradition as well--the amateur practice of painting by
numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Certain passages in the paintings buzz with the friction between
abstract flatness and coherence into recognizable shapes. Giersbach
attempts to exploit the tension further by extending the imagery
beyond the edges of the panels. Two of the paintings here continue in
monochrome onto the wall, where the forms dissolve entirely into pure
design. It's a snazzy gimmick, but it doesn't make up for the
paintings' lack of real substance.</TE>
<TE>   Only one painting, "Little Girl (With Tulips)," contains enough
internal tension to merit long attention. The scene is skewed as if
seen through a distorting lens, so the space behind the child appears
warped and stretched, a bizarre taffy of khaki, slate, mint and
lavender. The girl herself lacks edges separating her from the
background, and that continuity clashes enough with our experience of
solids and space to make for a curious, hallucinogenic spell worth
prolonging.</TE>

<HD>Untamed, This 'Shrew' Delights</HD>
<DH>A lusty, raucous staging of the Shakespeare comedy in San
Diego is a war between the sexes that takes no prisoners.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>"The Taming of the Shrew," now on the Festival Stage at the Globe
Theatres, is a raucous, stylish, funny froth of gender combat that
shoots off sexual sparks like a summer lightning storm.</LD>
<LD>   Move over, Liz and Dick. Elizabeth Heflin as the razor-tongued
Katherine and Jeffrey Nordling as the "mad-brained rudesby" Petruchio
are perfectly matched as the high-octane couple whose wooing, wedding
and bedding is the heart of "Shrew."</LD>
<LD>   She rages, he ups the ante, and no mercy is asked or given in this
battle of the sexes.</LD>
<TE>   The dinner-table scene--she's hungry, he's domineering--is the
equivalent of two middleweight contenders going toe to toe for 15
rounds.</TE>
<TE>   Nordling's Petruchio is boorish, unapologetically macho and
thoroughly charismatic. Heflin's shrew is dangerous and magnetic. In
all, it's a war between worthy combatants, part soap opera, part pro
wrestling.</TE>
<TE>   Director John Rando, fresh from winning a Tony for Broadway's
"Urinetown," has given us a Padua full of poseurs, fops, pedants,
witty servants, befuddled seniors and the hormone-beset young. He has
even added a few touches of his own. Among them: horses that do
interesting things.</TE>
<TE>   Rando sees no need to nudge Katherine into being some aboriginal
Murphy Brown. Katherine's speech of submission--"Such duty as the
subject owes the prince / Even such a woman oweth to her husband"--is
done without a wink or an elbow in the ribs.</TE>
<TE>   Rando's style seems simple: Play the text and let the p.c. chips
fall where they may. It is, after all, a 400-year-old comedy, not a
platform document for a national political party.</TE>
<TE>   Though Petruchio versus Katherine is the main event, the undercard
of "Shrew" is equally superb.</TE>
<TE>   Dakin Matthews as Katherine's loving but terrified father,
Baptista Minola, reflects the fury that Katherine has wrought, and
the seeming impossibility of getting her married so that a younger
sister is free to accept a suitor. His flinching, cringing body
language whenever Katherine begins to rail speaks as loudly as a
dozen soliloquies.</TE>
<TE>   Laura Heisler as Bianca, Katherine's younger sister, holds her own
with her overpowering sibling, with a dash of sneakiness to her soul
and a pouty manner that manipulates any male within harm's way.</TE>
<TE>   Arnie Burton is a gem as the sly servant Grumio. Ditto for Rainn
Wilson as the equally conniving Tranio. Jeffrey Brick as Biondello
reels off possibly the most memorable speech of the evening, and
Globe veteran Jonathan McMurtry snaps life into Bianca's foolish
suitor Gremio.</TE>
<TE>   With right-on costumes by Lewis Brown and some kicky sound effects
by Chris Walker, this "Shrew" is untamed and a thorough delight.</TE>

<HD>Shark! Pet Some, Watch Others and Learn the Difference</HD>
<DH>A new exhibit at the Long Beach Aquarium includes a giant
tank for dangerous species and touch pools for gentle ones, a chance
for hands-on education.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE GORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gliding about in a murky quarantine tank at the Aquarium of the
Pacific lurks one lucky shark.</LD>
<LD>   Barely visible in the bubbly water, the sand tiger shark will soon
join about 150 other creatures in a $3-million, 10,000-square-foot
exhibit at the Long Beach aquarium.</LD>
<LD>   The open-air display features a giant tank for so-called toothy
sharks; three touch pools housing more gentle species; a gift shack,
cafe and an outdoor theater; giant statues; and plenty of hands-on
kiosks explaining sharks' biology, reproduction and importance in the
food chain. It's the newest permanent exhibit at the facility, whose
annual attendance has been about 1 million--roughly half of initial
projections when it opened in 1998.</LD>
<TE>   As massive as the shark lagoon's budget and size is its mission:
Correct misunderstandings associated with these creatures, many of
which are endangered.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Sandy Trautwein, curator of fish and invertebrates, is
even encouraging visitors to touch certain shark breeds in an effort
to bridge some of the gap between surf and turf.</TE>
<TE>   "By letting people touch sharks, we're hoping to build a newly
found respect for these creatures," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Such was the case last weekend when Makenna Lammons of Riverside
was visiting. "They're cool to touch," the 7-year-old said of the
touch-tank sharks. "They kind of feel like leather."</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to popular perception, shark attacks are rare and
fatalities even rarer. In the U.S., people are 30 times more likely
to be killed by lightning than a shark, according to the
International Shark Attack File, a compilation of all known
incidents.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, of approximately 350 species, fewer than 10% are
dangerous to people, scientists say. Meanwhile, humans kill more than
20 million sharks each year.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to counteract fears stirred up by films such as the classic
"Jaws" and a rash of reports about attacks last year is, of course, a
bit of a double-edged sword.</TE>
<TE>   The price the captive sharks will pay is a steep one--freedom. But
in exchange, they'll get what amounts to an underwater luxury suite
that officially opened about three weeks ago. Sharks may come off as
indestructible on the Discovery Channel, but once in custody, many
become fragile, requiring everything from special vitamins to
plankton filters.</TE>
<TE>   The history of keeping some sharks in captivity has been fraught
with failure. Biologists say great white sharks, for example, have
never been able to survive more than three weeks in captivity. During
a series of disastrous efforts in the 1980s, aquariums learned that
great whites refuse to eat and often bang up against the walls of
their tanks, unable to accept anything other than the open ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Only this year has an aquarium decided to give great white
husbandry another go; the Monterey Bay Aquarium says it wants to
capture a great white pup and eventually move it into a
1-million-gallon tank.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no experts who can tell you what is going on with these
sharks," Monterey Bay Aquarium field operations curator John
O'Sullivan told The Times last month. "You can fill a thimble with
the information we know about them."</TE>
<TE>   So far, efforts to find a pup have been unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   Once captured, if the pup fails to thrive, the Monterey aquarium
has promised to release it. But Trautwein's staff in Long Beach isn't
thinking about such a precarious endeavor. They maintain that
educating the public can be done without risking the lives of the
more delicate species.</TE>
<TE>   "People are still really fascinated by sharks--toothy, toothy
sharks," Trautwein says, so the aquarium is loading up on sand tiger,
sandbar, white tip and other hardier types. They'll be visible in the
big tank that's part of the lagoon. Visitors can watch them from
above or at eye level.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors who want to get a sense of a great white will get their
chance--sort of. Six of the largest, most interesting shark breeds
are represented, actual size, on giant tiles strewn throughout the
exhibit.</TE>
<TE>   But most of the live sharks at this exhibit are the touchable
sort. Swimming in three shallow pools are zebra, bamboo and epaulette
sharks, whose skin feels like fine sandpaper.</TE>
<TE>   "It was rougher than I thought it would be," said Nanette Taylor
of Laguna Niguel, who brought her 10-year-old niece to the aquarium.
Even though she knew the sharks were safe to touch, she exercised
some caution. "We kind of stayed away from the mouth region."</TE>
<TE>   Still, these animals are so tame that a few sit motionless while
half a dozen kids gently paw at them. Some of the bamboo sharks even
seem like sleepy housecats, swimming by lazily and raising their
heads a bit to be "petted." The sharks can always scuttle off into
designated hiding areas if they get overstimulated.</TE>
<TE>   They also like to pile on top of one another in corners and fall
asleep, or whatever the shark equivalent of that is, for reasons that
aren't quite clear.</TE>
<TE>   The special hiding areas are the tip of the fin when it comes to
accommodations designed for these ancient creatures.</TE>
<TE>   A massive sand-filtering system dedicated just for the sharks is
in place. And if that isn't enough, a bevy of creepy-looking
horseshoe crabs has been brought in for their ability to kick up
sand. Resembling spiders with thick shells, the crabs act sort of
like vacuum cleaners as they walk, Trautwein says.</TE>
<TE>   Bunches of rays (with the stingers clipped) also will be on hand
as a kind of entourage in the touch pools.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the exhibit, there are twice-daily shark feedings by
the aquarium staff, with fish, shrimp, clams and squid that are
already nice and dead, and vitamin supplements.</TE>
<TE>   For the humans, there are plenty of other cool things,
particularly for the young and inquisitive.</TE>
<TE>   Water-loving kids might like the giant statues of a squid and
shark carpeted with rubber matting in the middle of the lagoon. The
kids can push buttons to make water shoot out of holes in the squid
statue, to reenact the way the invertebrate defends itself with ink.</TE>
<TE>   And visitors who didn't know that sharks have a sixth sense can
learn all about it at the aquarium. Just before biting down on a
meal, sharks often roll their eyes back in their heads. That
activates a gland that senses the--get this--electrical field
surrounding the prey. Kids can get a sense of their own electrical
output at one kiosk, which lets visitors put their hands on a wall
and "see" the field.</TE>

<HD>'Noise' Is Involving Look at Cost of Economic Depression</HD>

Miller</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Echoes of John Osborne permeate "Noise," receiving its U.S. premiere
by the Furious Theatre in Pasadena. Alex Jones' slashing 1997 drama
of the perils of economic depression frequently suggests a latter-day
"Look Back in Anger."</LD>
<LD>   It begins with teenage factory worker Dan (Damaso Rodriquez)
bringing pregnant bride Becky (Vonessa Martin) to their new home, a
shoddy Black Country government housing flat (strikingly designed by
Shawn Lee).</LD>
<LD>   The grimy comic atmosphere soon darkens, as blaring techno music
from next door awakens the couple on their first night out and
continually thereafter. An official appeal to the authorities brings
their neighbor, dashing slacker Matt (James C. Leary), in search of
rapprochement while Dan is at work.</LD>
<TE>   This leads to harrowing developments symbolizing the lost
innocence of post-Thatcher England.</TE>
<TE>   Director Sara Hennessy marshals her forces with assurance. Besides
Lee, the solid design roster features notable contributions from
Christie Wright's lighting and Eric Pargac's sound, and the cast is
estimable, managing the Birmingham dialects without sacrificing
intelligibility.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez and Martin, wisely avoiding teen mannerisms, have an
easy chemistry that renders their plight doubly poignant. Leary
conceals his imbalance beneath layers of roughhewn charisma,
recalling the young Terrence Mann.</TE>
<TE>   Jones' impressive architecture occasionally tips the sociological
hat, and the intermission is questionable, halting the accelerating
tension. These are quibbles, though, as the nail-biting intensity of
the disturbing climax demonstrates the acute impact this haunting
work achieves.</TE>

<TE>   'Fluffy Bunnies' Flirts With the Edge</TE>
<TE>   Dating--eeeewww. Like "I Love You, You're Perfect, Now Change,"
the off-Broadway musical revue that played downstairs at the Coronet
Theater in 1998, and "Maybe Baby, It's You," which closed in May
upstairs at the Coronet, "Fluffy Bunnies in a Field of Daisies" takes
the stage to examine the mating rituals of attractive young
heterosexuals who don't seem to have much to do with their days but
agonize over sex or the lack thereof.</TE>
<TE>   Although the first two shows play it safe with a dose of
greeting-card schmaltz, the screamingly funny "Fluffy Bunnies," a new
comedy written and directed by Matt Chaffee at Hollywood's Zoo
Theatre, hops much closer to the edge of desperation, sending up,
rather than reveling in, sitcom platitudes.</TE>
<TE>   Against a set with absurd cartoons of outsized happy rabbits
looming through every window, these "fluffy bunnies" are frolicking
not among daisies but among landmines--and there's as much horror as
humor in wondering whether they'll make it through with their sanity
intact.</TE>
<TE>   Though raunchier and more down-and-dirty than anything in "I Love
You, You're Perfect" or "Maybe Baby," "Fluffy Bunnies" seems more
plaintively honest than deliberately gratuitous. And, amid all the
graphic sexual specificity, the three guys and a girl central to this
story become obsessed with an age-old philosophical question: whether
women can be divided into two camps, virgins and whores.</TE>
<TE>   This line of inquiry would be notably insulting if it didn't lead
to so much more angst among the male characters than the women, who
use the guys' obsession with knowing the answer to the
has-she-or-hasn't-she question to skillfully mess with their minds,
reducing them to a babbling, pleading, satisfying incoherence.</TE>
<TE>   "Fluffy Bunnies" doesn't really answer the virgin-whore
question--but when in doubt, why not do a big production number? Act
2 opens with just such a brilliantly out-of-place bit of Terpsichore,
choreographed by lead dancer Sangini Majmudar, who plays a
hilariously unhinged romantic in the first act, then seizes the
moment to illuminate the lunacy of modern-day dating through dance.</TE>

<TE>   'Three Grooms and Bride' Emphasizes the Personal</TE>
<TE>   For two couples--one gay, one straight--an attempt to cut costs by
doubling up on their marriage ceremonies turns into "the 'Waterworld'
of wedding parties" in Gary Goldstein's agreeable new comedy, "Three
Grooms and a Bride," at West Hollywood's Coast Playhouse.</TE>
<TE>   As in his previous works, Goldstein's strengths as a playwright
are his facility with likable characters and warm, sympathetic
humor--which should not be confused with sentimentality.</TE>
<TE>   The important distinction is that the conflicts Goldstein explores
are not the result of mischievous or malicious plotting (the easy way
to introduce tension) but rather of imperfect people trying to do the
best they can but falling short because of their limitations.
Sustaining interest without relying on an obvious villain is a
tougher challenge, and Goldstein's success in this regard is
noteworthy.</TE>
<TE>   Here, the frustrating logistics of planning the joint wedding
ultimately become a test of both couples' relationships, as motives
come under scrutiny and buried secrets come to light.</TE>
<TE>   For the gay couple, "tying the knot" is the pivotal issue
simmering under the surface. It's an important demonstration of
commitment for Adam (Seth Resnik), while Zack (Michael Otis) scoffs
at his partner's need for "some kind of Good Housekeeping seal of
approval," preferring to keep their relationship private and under
wraps.</TE>
<TE>   For the controlling Wendy (Stephanie Venditto) and her easygoing
fiance (Christopher Jacobs) most of the hurdles involve dodging the
complications introduced by the gung-ho wedding planner (a plum comic
role played to the hilt by Anne DeSalvo), who commits them to ever
more grandiose arrangements. The high comedic value of this angle
notwithstanding, Goldstein spends more time with it than he needs
to--postponing until midway through the second half a far more
important conflict arising from a revelation about Paul's past.</TE>
<TE>   In keeping with the venue and target audience, the piece is
weighted far more toward gay-oriented material. Randy Brenner's
staging lets no opportunity slip by to indulge in the gratuitous
beefcake that's become de rigueur for the genre.</TE>
<TE>   More important, he also coaxes credible, engaging performances
from his entire cast, particularly from the feisty Venditto, who
holds her own in what is predominantly a boys' club. The use of
celebrity voice-overs for the answering machine messages left by the
characters' families is a cute but nonessential gimmick.</TE>
<TE>   Though the topic of gay marriage figures prominently here,
Goldstein carefully contains it within a personal rather than a legal
context. Having a wedding ceremony is important as a validation of a
relationship, but the implicit issues involving coequal rights in
society at large are given a wide berth. That doesn't make
Goldstein's play any less amusing or enjoyable, but it does limit its
significance.</TE>

<TE>   'The Tempest' Is Not a Perfect Storm</TE>
<TE>   "The Tempest" is one of Shakespeare's most accessible plays, with
its comic interludes, its acts of magic and its depiction of the thin
line between revenge and forgiveness.</TE>
<TE>   A great deal of imagination has been invested in bringing these
qualities to life for the Kingsmen Shakespeare Company's outdoor
production in Thousand Oaks. Director Michael J. Arndt has
transferred the story of Prospero--a deposed scholarly
duke-turned-magician--to the 19th century, with its breathtaking
advances in science and technology, and the designers have rendered
Prospero's island paradise as a Jules Verne fantasy of art nouveau
style and Machine Age wonder.</TE>
<TE>   Although the production is nice to look at, its core is missing.
Too few of the performers convincingly bring their roles to life and,
as of opening weekend, hesitation between lines and awkward pauses
between scenes sapped the presentation's energy. Meanwhile, a mushy,
buzzing sound system swallowed many of the words.</TE>
<TE>   On the upper platform of a two-level set, designer Mary E. Murdock
creates an aerie filled with scientific equipment--Prospero's
headquarters as he uses magic to shipwreck those who once conspired
against him, then sets out to reeducate them about life's true
priorities.</TE>
<TE>   Lane Davies' Prospero carries a staff with a glowing glass orb,
and a variety of exotic puppets (designed by Murdock and Howard
Schmitt) are employed to create the story's elaborate phantasms.</TE>
<TE>   But Davies himself isn't nearly so magical. His Prospero is grand
and mellifluous but never reels toward the madness that makes the
character so hauntingly ambiguous. For complexity, the production
must rely on Derek Medina, who brings vulnerability and wounded pride
to the otherwise monstrous Caliban, the island's would-be ruler. And
for enchantment, the presentation has Megan Goodchild, who lends
freshness and wonder to the role of Prospero's daughter, Miranda.</TE>

<HD>A 'Harvard Man' on Morality's Slippery Slope</HD>
<DH>A basketball player finds himself on the road to regret in
James Toback's comedy, but it's hard to find anyone to root for.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>James Toback's "Harvard Man" is a fast and clever con-gone-wrong
comedy that reflects the writer-director's characteristic blend of
the intellectual and the criminal. But it lacks anyone to care
about--even the repellent characters are less than fascinating--and
the result is a crisply made movie that is no more than mildly
amusing.</LD>
<LD>   Adrian Grenier's Alan is a Harvard philosophy major and a point
guard on the basketball team. He considers himself a very cool guy,
carrying on simultaneous affairs with Cindy (Sarah Michelle Gellar),
daughter of a Mafia don who controls the Northeast U.S., and Chesney
(Joey Lauren Adams), a philosophy professor six years his senior.
With Cindy, a pert but tough-talking type who prides herself on being
her father's daughter, the relationship is pure lust; with Chesney,
there could be more.</LD>
<LD>   Alan has everything in his life under control until a tornado hits
his Kansas hometown and wipes out his parents' uninsured house. In an
instant, Alan becomes determined to snag the $100,000 his parents
need to rebuild. Where better to turn than Cindy's dad, Andrew
Bandolini (Gianni Russo)? Naturally, Bandolini wants a little
something in return, and Alan decides it's no big deal to shave a few
points off the next game.</LD>
<TE>   So far so good, but it all comes undone when Cindy decides to
place a $250,000 cash bet on the game with her father's bookie
associate Teddy (Eric Stoltz), whose key aide is the sultry Kelly
(Rebecca Gayheart). Not helping matters is that just at the moment
Alan most needs to keep his wits about him, he decides to drop three
sugar cubes laced with 15,000 micrograms of LSD, a gift from a
chemistry major pal.</TE>
<TE>   Audacious, imaginatively sustained mayhem ensues right to the
finish, but most everyone involved is so craven or calculating or
both, starting most crucially with Alan, that it's hard to care much
about how everything turns out. The key problem is Grenier (or the
way Toback has directed him). He's an able young actor effective
elsewhere, but here he's way too much the smart aleck and not nearly
charismatic enough to make Alan's fate much matter.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for drug use, language and some strong sexuality.
Times guidelines: unsuitable for younger teen audiences.</TE>

<HD>Water Puppets of Vietnam Are Making a Comeback</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID THURBER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>HANOI, Vietnam</DL>
<LD>A grinning tiger splashes through the water, grabs a duck from a
helpless farmer and races up a palm tree 20 feet away, its prey
dangling from its mouth.</LD>
<LD>   The audience roars at the antics--controlled by puppeteers
standing thigh-deep in water behind a bamboo screen. Long underwater
poles and ropes transmit the complex motions to the colorful
hand-carved puppets--including dancing maidens, smoke-belching
dragons and fish that pull lazy fishermen into the deep.</LD>
<LD>   Vietnam's unique water puppets have been portraying the foibles of
rural life for nearly 1,000 years. They are among many traditional
Vietnamese performing arts that nearly faded away during decades of
war and communist revolution, but have now found new audiences.</LD>
<TE>   About a dozen water puppet troupes are currently performing,
mostly in villages in northern Vietnam's Red River Delta. Most of the
puppeteers are farmers who devote long hours to practice but perform
for free.</TE>
<TE>   Water puppet shows originally were performed in rice paddies or
ponds when farm work allowed, either after spring planting or
harvesting.</TE>
<TE>   The performances intersperse vignettes of life in a farming
village with legends about Vietnam's creation, magical turtles and
brave kings. In many, the humans are outfoxed by nature, to the
delight of generations of rural Vietnamese.</TE>
<TE>   Water puppetry nearly disappeared during the decades of wars
against France and the United States, poverty and communist
revolution.</TE>
<TE>   After the Vietnam War ended in 1975, Communist authorities
believed that traditional culture and festivals were backward and
frivolous in a time of extreme poverty and political upheaval. That
policy began shifting in the mid-1980s as Vietnam introduced economic
reforms that ended its failed experiment in collectivized agriculture
and a centralized command economy.</TE>
<TE>   The government now officially encourages many traditional arts in
an effort to forge a national cultural identity, and this year plans
to ask UNESCO to designate water puppetry as part of the world's
cultural heritage.</TE>
<TE>   In theaters in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, water puppet
performances are packed every night with foreign tourists. But the
art form's future is less certain in its countryside roots, where it
faces growing competition from TV, pop music and the allure of
private enterprise.</TE>

<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Modesty seems rare in a world where Kreskin is "Amazing," San Diego
is "America's Finest City" and Starbucks' sizes start at "tall."</LD>
<LD>   But they weren't kidding when they named New York's train terminal
Grand Central. And few could argue with the title of tonight's
Learning Channel documentary "The Greatest Train Station: Grand
Central Terminal" (6 p.m.), which offers a one-hour look at the
landmark's history and inner workings.</LD>
<LD>   Built in 1913, Grand Central set new standards for luxury and
innovation. With its curved sky ceiling, marble and brass fixtures
and a ramp system that kept pedestrian traffic flowing, it was ornate
yet functional. With its shops, restaurants, even tennis courts, it
was almost a city within a city.</LD>
<TE>   "The railroads wanted you to believe that this was something like
you've never seen," said James W. Rhodes of the architectural firm
that oversaw the recent restoration. "Part of their advertisement
was, 'It must be seen to be believed--the greatest civic achievement
of all time.' All that's true."</TE>
<TE>   Along with footage of the original construction, the show looks at
the 10-year face lift finished in 1998. Almost every inch of the 49
acres needed attention. The impressive (if astronomically incorrect)
sky ceiling, for instance, was covered in decades of soot and grime,
which workers removed with soap, water, cheesecloth and elbow grease.</TE>
<TE>   Another major chapter in the terminal's saga was the 11-year
preservation fight that ended in 1978. The railroads that own the
terminal wanted to tear it down, but angry citizens prevailed.</TE>
<TE>   One observer calls Grand Central, which now employs 1,000 and
accommodates 500,000 users a day, a "visual reminder of a bygone
era." It also shows us how well things still can be done.</TE>

<HD>BAE's Deal May Be Worth $4 Billion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>LONDON -- BAE Systems, Europe's biggest weapons contractor, said its
share of an order to make radios for the U.S. armed forces may be
worth as much as $4 billion over the 20-year program, more than
previous estimates.</LD>
<LD>   BAE is in a group of companies led by Boeing Co. that has been
chosen to supply new radios allowing troops to transmit voice, data
and video information more quickly, it said. The U.S. Defense
Department has said orders may be worth $2 billion through 2008, the
program's first phase.</LD>
<LD>   "BAE is winning U.S. contracts because it has built up a
significant presence there," said Nick Cunningham, an analyst at
Schroder Salomon Smith Barney who rates the stock "outperform."</LD>
<TE>   BAE has transformed itself from a British-focused aerospace
company into an international defense systems business. Last year, it
had North American sales of $3.9 billion, and the Pentagon is its
biggest customer.</TE>
<TE>   The value of the new order to BAE, if options are exercised,
"could exceed $4 billion over the life of the program," the company
said.</TE>
<TE>   The first phase is expected to deliver more than 100,000 radios
for the Army and Air Force, BAE said. The radios will go into service
in 2008.</TE>

<HD>ECB Leaves Key Rate Unchanged</HD>
<DH>Economy: The Bank of England also holds steady as officials
take a wait-and-see attitude about a global recovery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SONJA DIECKHOEFER</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>FRANKFURT, Germany</DL>
<LD>FRANKFURT, Germany -- European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg
said Thursday that policymakers would not rush to raise interest
rates as the European economy struggles to revive.</LD>
<LD>   ECB officials met and voted to leave the bank's key short-term
interest rate at 3.25% for the eighth consecutive month.</LD>
<LD>   In London, the Bank of England met and kept its benchmark rate
steady at 4%.</LD>
<TE>   Like the Federal Reserve, which has maintained its key rate at
1.75% since December, the ECB and the Bank of England appear to
believe the global economic recovery isn't robust enough to justify
higher interest rates.</TE>
<TE>   In Europe, consumers and companies grew more pessimistic in June
as stocks tumbled, confidence polls showed.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the euro's 10% gain against the dollar this year probably
will damp exports, which account for 38% of the euro zone's gross
domestic product. A stronger euro can make exports more expensive for
foreign buyers.</TE>
<TE>   "Our attitude is to wait and see," Duisenberg told reporters. "I'm
not without concern, seeing the developments" in European and U.S.
stock markets, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The economy is weaker than anticipated," said Cees van Lede,
chief executive of Akzo Nobel, the world's largest maker of paints
and coatings. "The year should end OK, but I admit the jury is out."</TE>
<TE>   "Rate increases this year are increasingly unlikely," said Jan
Holthusen, an economist at DZ Bank in Frankfurt.</TE>
<TE>   French car and light-truck sales fell 10% in June, with sales at
both Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroen declining. Also, Matalan and
Arcadia Group, two of Britain's biggest clothing retailers, said
sales slowed in the last two months.</TE>
<TE>   "People spend less money," said Eric Gavet, 42, owner of a
newsstand on the Boulevard des Capucines in central Paris. "They
don't buy daily papers every day anymore. They think twice before
buying magazines."</TE>
<TE>   The economies of the 12 euro countries and Britain barely grew in
the first quarter. Signals have been mixed since then. A report early
Thursday showed that foreign orders for German industrial goods rose
almost 10% in May, but demand from domestic customers slipped 2.3%.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the wavering recovery, it's absolutely important we don't
get a rate increase," said Herbert Meyer, chief financial officer of
Heidelberger Druckmaschinen, the world's biggest maker of printing
presses.</TE>
<TE>   With spending weak, retailers find they can't increase prices to
cover rising costs. The inflation rate in the euro countries declined
to a 2 1/2-year low in June, under the ECB's annualized 2% limit for
the first time in 25 months.</TE>
<TE>   "Stock markets are depressed, the euro is rising and inflation is
within target. That's not the right time to raise interest rates,"
said Bernd Karstedt, who helps manage $97 billion at Union Asset
Management in Frankfurt.</TE>
<TE>   Bank of England Gov. Sir Edward George and Duisenberg had signaled
in recent months that they would have to raise rates as their
economies rebound, to prevent inflation from accelerating.</TE>
<TE>   But both men have since softened their remarks. George said June
26 that policy makers had "a certain amount of time."</TE>
<TE>   Duisenberg said the euro's recent rise would help slow inflation
as imports become cheaper for European consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, analysts expect both banks to raise short-term rates this
year. Almost half of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News expected
the ECB to raise rates in September by at least a quarter of a
percentage point.</TE>
<TE>   Most see the Bank of England lifting the price of credit in
August.</TE>

<HD>Fish-Dumping Claim Rejected by Vietnamese</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>HANOI</DL>
<LD>U.S. catfish farmers' claims that Vietnam is selling fish in America
below cost are an attempt to sabotage relations between the former
enemies, a Vietnam government spokeswoman said.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush in May signed a law that forced Vietnam to stop
calling fish it exports to the U.S. "catfish." Now the U.S.
International Trade Commission will investigate claims that the fish
that Vietnam relabeled as "tra" and "basa" is being dumped, or sold
for less than fair market value.</LD>
<LD>   "Slanderous claims that Vietnamese enterprises are selling tra and
basa catfish to the U.S. market at dumping prices are absolutely
baseless," Vietnam Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Phan Thuy Thanh said
at a news conference.</LD>
<TE>   The new dispute threatens to revive trade tension less than a year
after an accord on business between the countries took effect.</TE>
<TE>   The law Bush signed in May was aimed at shielding U.S. catfish
producers from cheaper Vietnamese products. It permits only a
specific North American fish variety to be labeled "catfish."</TE>
<TE>   Vietnam's exports of the product resumed under new labels, and the
Catfish Farmers of America then called for an anti-dumping
investigation in a petition filed June 28.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. International Trade Commission must report the
conclusions of its investigation to the Department of Commerce by
Aug. 19. It has scheduled a July 19 hearing on the petition.</TE>

<HD>Ford to Open Factory in Russia to Cut Car Prices</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>VSEVOLOZHSK, Russia</DL>
<LD>Ford Motor Co., the world's No. 2 auto maker, will open a
$150-million factory here next week in an effort to cut car prices
that are inflated by import duties.</LD>
<LD>   The factory will make 8,000 Ford Focus vehicles this year, with
production rising to about 10,000 cars in 2003, said Oksana
Khartonuk, a spokeswoman for Ford in Russia.</LD>
<LD>   The move is a sign that Russian President Vladimir Putin's efforts
to attract foreign investors are starting to pay off as the country
seeks to boost jobs and scrap Soviet-era factory technology, analysts
said.</LD>
<TE>   "This sends a signal that Russia is open for business," said
Roland Nash, head of research at Renaissance Capital in Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   "When major companies are ready to invest in Russia, it is a sign
that reforms have taken some effect."</TE>
<TE>   Producing vehicles locally will enable Ford to cut the price of
cars to Russians by circumventing import duties, the company said.
Import duties on cars brought into Russia total about 25%, compared
with about 2.5% in European markets.</TE>
<TE>   "Russia is a closed market and import duties are very high here,"
Khartonuk said. A Ford Focus produced at the factory will cost about
$10,900; the same car sells in Europe for about $13,900, she said.</TE>

<LD>LONDON -- U.S. computer maker Hewlett-Packard Co. will eliminate
1,580 jobs in Britain, more than 20% of its work force in the
country.</LD>
<LD>   The losses are among 15,000 job cuts announced after HP's
acquisition of Compaq two months ago.</LD>
<LD>   The company employs 150,000 people around the world and about
7,600 in Britain.</LD>
<TE>   Jobs to be cut include 450 permanent posts and 180 temporary jobs
at the former Compaq plant at Erskine, near Glasgow in Scotland.
About 900 jobs will remain there.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the eliminated jobs are at sites in London and Reading
in southern England and Livingston in Scotland.</TE>

<HD>Iran's Bond Sale Draws Attention in Europe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Iran's first foreign bond sale since the Islamic revolution of 1979
is attracting interest from Deutsche Bank, Pictet &amp; Cie and other
banks that aren't put off by the nation's place in President Bush's
"axis of evil."</LD>
<LD>   Money managers who met with Iranian officials this week in
Frankfurt and Paris say they may buy some of the $492 million in
securities underwritten by BNP Paribas and Commerzbank.</LD>
<LD>   "Nobody in Germany or continental Europe agrees with Bush," said
Holger Friedrich, who manages about $530 million in securities at
Union Investment, Germany's No. 3 fund manager.</LD>
<TE>   Many European money managers are ignoring Bush's January statement
that Iran, along with Iraq and North Korea, supports terrorists like
those that attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on Sept.
11. Instead, they say the country's oil and history of repaying debts
make it more trustworthy than emerging market alternatives such as
Brazil, Turkey and Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   For some U.S. investors, European willingness to invest in
countries accused of sponsoring terrorism is abhorrent, particularly
after the attack on New York's financial district.</TE>
<TE>   "I lost friends on that day," said Stapley Mitchell, who oversees
$4 billion at Fifth Third Investment Advisors in Grand Rapids, Mich.
"I don't care how much money you can make; these are people that are
trying to kill."</TE>
<TE>   Frank Scheidig, who oversees investment services for Deutsche
Asset Management's governmental clients, said there is no evidence
Iran supported the attacks on the U.S. After meeting with Iran's
deputy central bank governor, Mohammad Mojarrad, on Tuesday, Scheidig
said he may recommend that investors buy the bonds.</TE>
<TE>   "If there was the smallest confirmation that they supported Sept.
11, I wouldn't ever" invest there, Scheidig said.</TE>
<TE>   "With my knowledge, we would never spend a cent on any investment
in a country that would do something bad."</TE>
<TE>   Iran plans to sell the five-year bonds to yield 3.75 to 4.25
percentage points more than the so-called mid-swap rate, a benchmark
for corporate borrowing, said Dominique Audin, who helps manage $60
million in securities for Pictet Asset Management in London.</TE>
<TE>   Some investors said Iran needs to pay higher returns because the
U.S. sanctions make it a bigger risk.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't argue that Iran has as good credit as Russia," Audin
said. "Russia isn't being pointed at by the U.S. president as a
potential target."</TE>

<HD>Stocks in Europe, Asia Finish Stronger; U.S. Markets Closed</HD>
<DH>Investing: Wall Street's pre-holiday advance lifts world
indexes. The dollar gains some ground against the euro.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press and Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Major stock markets around the world posted gains Thursday, taking
heart from Wall Street's rebound late Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. markets were closed for the Fourth of July holiday and will
be open for a half-day session today.</LD>
<LD>   In Asia, stocks gained in South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan,
helped by U.S. markets' turnaround Wednesday. The Dow Jones
industrials rose 47.22 points, or 0.5%, to 9,054.97 and the Nasdaq
composite added 22.35 points, or 1.7%, to 1,380.17, after two days of
heavy selling tied to corporate accounting scandals and fear of
terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   In South Korea, the composite index rose 2% to 768.74, the fifth
consecutive gain. The index is up 10.8% this year, a strong
performance given heavy losses in most other markets.</TE>
<TE>   In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index rose 1.8% to 10,765.58, while
Taiwan's weighted index jumped 1.6% to 5,130.80.</TE>
<TE>   Many investors are betting that Asian companies will benefit early
from the global economy's recovery.</TE>
<TE>   But in Tokyo, shares fell as Japanese investors cashed in gains
from the previous session. The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei index slid
179.49 points, or 1.7%, to finish at 10,632.81. It is up 0.9% this
year, compared with the U.S. Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index's 17%
decline.</TE>
<TE>   In Europe, most markets closed higher as the European Central Bank
met and voted to leave short-term interest rates unchanged, citing
fears that Europe's economic recovery is lacking vitality.</TE>
<TE>   Also, a surge in shares of France Telecom helped drive the French
market. France Telecom rocketed 16% amid increasing confidence that
the French government, the company's major shareholder, will step in
to prevent a liquidity crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Vivendi Universal also rebounded after diving early in
the week on fears the company faces a cash crisis.</TE>
<TE>   France's CAC-40 stock index rose 2% on Thursday, but it's still
down 20.1% year to date.</TE>
<TE>   Gains in battered telecom shares also helped other markets.</TE>
<TE>   In Germany, the DAX index rallied 2.9% on Thursday. Britain's
FTSE-100 index rose 1.8%, while the Swiss market index was up 2.4%.</TE>
<TE>   Canadian stocks were flat, with the S&amp;P/TSX index edging up less
than 0.1% to 7,029.78. In Mexico City the IPC index added 0.4% to
6,352.89.</TE>
<TE>   In currency trading, the dollar continued to take back some ground
against the euro, as traders reassessed the chances the European
currency might continue its recent rally.</TE>
<TE>   The euro was trading at 97.9 cents in Europe, down from 98 cents
at the New York close on Wednesday. The euro peaked at 99.2 cents on
Monday, briefly toying with the $1 level.</TE>
<TE>   The euro has gained as some global investors have soured on
dollar-denominated assets in the wake of U.S. accounting scandals.</TE>

<HD>Mexico Puts Airlines on the Auction Block</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Mexicana and AeroMexico together handle about 80%
of the country's domestic flights.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACI CARL</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Seven years after the government seized Mexico's two largest airlines
during an economic crisis, both are back on the auction block despite
the slump in the airline industry caused by the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Officials say Mexican investors and several U.S.
airlines--including AMR Corp.'s American Airlines, Continental
Airlines Inc. and Delta Air Lines Inc.--have expressed interest in
buying shares of Mexicana and AeroMexico, which together handle about
80% of domestic air traffic.</LD>
<LD>   Mexico's antitrust watchdog agency, the Federal Competition
Commission, has ruled that the two must be sold separately to
preserve competition.</LD>
<TE>   Some analysts question whether Mexico's market can support two
large, independent carriers. Mexican unions and lawmakers say they
fear that cutthroat competition could drive one out of business.</TE>
<TE>   Both airlines have been operated by a government-controlled
holding company since 1995. With little competition, the two airlines
usually offer the same rates for the same routes, and it often costs
more to fly within Mexico than to fly to the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The government first announced plans to sell the airlines in 2000.
The sale was delayed by lawmakers, who argued that the companies
should be kept together, and later by the effects of the Sept. 11
attacks on the airline industry worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Cintra, the holding company that manages both
airlines, say the auction could take place by the end of the year.
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. has been hired to oversee the sale.</TE>
<TE>   Both airlines have turbulent histories.</TE>
<TE>   Mexicana, founded in 1921 by two Americans, ran into financial
problems in 1982, when the government bought control.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, a strike forced AeroMexico, Mexico's state-owned,
flagship airline, to file for bankruptcy protection. The airline was
then sold to a group of investors for $335 million. Mexicana was sold
a year later in an effort to help jump-start Mexico's sagging
economy.</TE>
<TE>   The government was forced to intervene again during Mexico's 1995
peso crisis, creating Cintra as part of a $100-billion bank bailout.</TE>
<TE>   The government bank savings protection agency controls more than
65% of Cintra. Its stake comes from the airlines' debt, held by
troubled banks that were taken over by the government. Mexican law
requires the sale of assets from seized banks to reduce taxpayers'
costs of the bailout.</TE>
<TE>   Both AeroMexico and Mexicana have improved under Cintra's
management, offering better service. Still, Cintra posted operating
losses of $40 million in the first quarter of this year.</TE>
<TE>   Most analysts agree it will be difficult to get a good price for
both airlines as the industry struggles to recover from the U.S.
terrorist attacks. But they add that there may not be a better time
in the near future.</TE>
<TE>   Several U.S. airlines, some of which already have business
alliances with Mexicana and AeroMexico, have shown interest. Mexican
law, however, limits direct foreign ownership to 25%.</TE>

<HD>Internal Compliance Officers Get More Respect as Demand
Surges</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WEI GU</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Wall Street is scrambling to hire internal cops even as overall
payrolls are slashed to get costs in line with shrinking post-boom
revenue.</LD>
<LD>   Compliance officers, who make sure firms adhere to securities
regulations, used to be looked at as a bunch of dusty drones toiling
in obscurity in back rooms.</LD>
<LD>   But now, they're a hot growth industry. Banks are looking to raid
one another's staffs, and even traders who used to pocket millions of
dollars a year are considering switching careers amid the stock
market slump.</LD>
<TE>   "For the first time, I see traders asking, how can I go into
compliance?" said Jack Kelly, managing director of
Compliancejobs.com, a division of executive search firm Taft
Associates Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Demand for compliance officers is up because banks need to comply
with new regulations, such as laws to stop money-laundering and the
USA Patriot Act, that aim to cut off money flows to extremist groups
after the Sept. 11 attacks. Brokers now are required to conduct more
checks on their customers to avoid being used for illegal schemes.</TE>
<TE>   Another factor driving the hiring boom is a steady stream of
investigations into alleged wrongdoing on Wall Street, including
charges of crooked stock trading, analyst conflicts of interests and
back-door deals with companies that imploded, such as energy company
Enron Corp. and telecommunications firm WorldCom Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not one of those glamorous jobs and was not in high regard,
but now they are given the respect that they deserve," said Rita Kohn
of Stamford, Conn., recruiting firm Dawn Taylor Associates, who saw
an upswing in the compliance area, mainly from top-tier firms. "There
is a lot of pressure on them to protect the interests of the firm and
navigate it through the choppy environment."</TE>
<TE>   Regulators, criminal investigators and attorneys hired by irate
investors are going over Wall Street's books and operations with
fine-toothed combs. The exchanges also are keeping a sharper eye on
the industry: The National Assn. of Securities Dealers will add as
many as 60 investigators and attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   Adding compliance staff will be a long-term trend because of the
globalization of financial markets, said Ken Froewiss, professor at
New York University's Stern Business School.</TE>

<HD>Pacific Bell to Pay $27-Million Fine for DSL Problems</HD>
<DH>Telecom: The company promises to improve its billing
practices after hundreds of customers complained to the Public
Utilities Commission.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>SAN FRANCISCO -- Under a tentative settlement with state regulators,
SBC Pacific Bell has agreed to pay what would be a record $27-million
fine for billing tens of thousands of customers for high-speed
Internet service they never requested.</LD>
<LD>   Pacific Bell initially downplayed the problems but on Wednesday
recognized them and promised to improve its DSL billing practices and
promptly credit any customers who are billed improperly.</LD>
<LD>   Since 1999, about 800 customers have complained to the state
Public Utilities Commission that Pac Bell billed them--sometimes
twice--for DSL services they didn't order, didn't receive or wanted
to drop. Under the settlement, the company acknowledged incorrectly
billing 30,000 to 70,000 customers.</LD>
<TE>   DSL, which stands for digital subscriber line, is a high-speed
Internet service that works over ordinary telephone lines but is many
times faster than standard dial-up connections.</TE>
<TE>   One customer said that a month after inquiring about DSL service,
she received a bill charging her $99.95 for activation and a monthly
service fee.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't even have a computer at the time," Bobby Schaefer of San
Diego said. "I was gathering information."</TE>
<TE>   If approved by the commission and an administrative judge, the
fine would go to the state's general fund.</TE>
<TE>   It would be the largest levied by state utility regulators,
surpassing the $25.6 million Pac Bell was fined last year for
misleading marketing tactics.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Bell, a unit of San Antonio-based SBC Communications Inc.,
has about 800,000 DSL customers. The company said it had created a
new DSL billing center with 100 on its staff.</TE>

<HD>Malone's Liberty Media Moves Closer to Controlling Telewest</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>U.S. billionaire John Malone came closer Thursday to gaining control
of Telewest Communications, the No. 2 British cable television
company.</LD>
<LD>   Microsoft Corp. offered Malone its 23.6% stake, which would give
him about half the shares. Tele- west also plans talks to cut its
$8.1-billion debt. Malone's Liberty Media Corp. owns enough bonds to
force Telewest to swap most of its debt for equity, investors said.</LD>
<LD>   "Liberty's probably got 25% of the bonds, meaning it can block any
restructuring that doesn't suit it," said Louis Gargour, a hedge fund
manager at RAB Capital, which owns Telewest bonds. "That puts it in
control."</LD>
<TE>   Malone is seeking to take control of Telewest and eventually merge
it with larger cable company NTL Inc., which is in Chapter 11
protection from creditors after amassing $17.5 billion in debt,
investors said. That would allow him to compete with Rupert Murdoch's
British Sky Broadcasting Group, the biggest British pay-TV provider,
and BT Group, the former phone monopoly.</TE>
<TE>   A combined NTL and Telewest would supply TV services to about 3.5
million British customers, compared with BSkyB's 5.9 million
satellite subscribers. It also would have 4.1 million phone customers
and 352,000 high-speed Internet users. The unprofitable companies
operate in franchises that do not overlap.</TE>

<HD>'Green' Rooms Still Gold for Business Travelers</HD>
<DH>Hotels: Environmental awareness has cut down on waste and
helped the industry weather the economic downturn.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL CONLON</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Business travelers can take credit for inspiring at least one trend
in the lodging industry that has stayed strong despite the bumpy
business conditions of the last two years.</LD>
<LD>   That's the growing environmental awareness or "green" movement in
hotels and motels that has affected everything from how often sheets
are washed to the kinds of lighting put in guest rooms.</LD>
<LD>   Patricia Griffin, president of the Texas-based Green Hotels Assn.,
said the groundswell for change that has been going on now for nearly
10 years originated with the most frequent guests.</LD>
<TE>   "The demand for this was strongest to begin with among business
travelers," Griffin said. "Maybe it's because they're better educated
or maybe just because they spend more time in hotels and they see the
waste.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're in a hotel for four or five days and spending most of
your time in meetings, you know the room doesn't have to be vacuumed
every day," she said. Nor do the towels always need to be changed
daily or the sheets washed every 24 hours for guests who stay for
several nights.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen a lot of changes," she said. One of the latest is that
more inns are telling long-term guests that sheets will be changed
every third day, if the guests agree, she said.</TE>
<TE>   It has become commonplace even for one-night guests to be asked to
leave the untouched towels hanging and place the soiled ones on the
counter or some other obvious place.</TE>
<TE>   The energy required to wash linens is a major expense in the
lodging industry, not to mention a waste of energy if some items
don't need a daily washing.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest change has been in fluorescent lighting," Griffin
said. The lower wattage involved also is an energy saver and new
shapes for bulbs have made that kind of lighting more adaptable to
table lamps and other fixtures where they were not seen before, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Another area where waste is being cut is in the switch to pumps
and other bulk-filled containers to dispense soap, shampoo and the
like in bathrooms, as opposed to individually wrapped soap and
single-serving bottles of liquids, she added.</TE>
<TE>   The drop in business travel caused by the economic downturn and
the events of Sept. 11 have hit the hotel industry but have not
impeded the "green" trend, Griffin said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is even more reason now to save money," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Details about the association, which provides information to the
lodging industry, can be found at www.greenhotels.com.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere on the travel front:</TE>
<TE>   * One always entertaining newsletter circulating on the Internet
is called "Really Useful Sites for International Trade
Professionals." Where else would you find, as is the case in the
current issue, a tip on a Web site that lists and rates public
restrooms worldwide--www.bathroomdiaries.com--including "golden
plunger" awards for the best of the best?</TE>
<TE>   * American Express Co. says it is adding two free services for
travelers check customers--help with replacing stolen or lost
passports or stolen or lost credit cards.</TE>
<TE>   It says its offices will connect customers with the nearest
consulate or embassy in the case of passports and perhaps provide the
documents the customer must file. For credit cards of all types it
says it will help customers begin the cancellation and replacement
process.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi Shares Surge as New Management Takes Charge</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: The veteran businessmen reveal plans to
avert a financial crisis and keep the company in one piece.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MERISSA MARR and WILLIAM EMMANUEL</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>PARIS -- Vivendi Universal's battered stock began a nervous recovery
Thursday after a team of French business veterans took charge of the
media group, vowing to avert a cash crisis and keep the ailing giant
in one piece.</LD>
<LD>   The new management team set to work on a rescue mission to tackle
the huge debt left behind by ousted empire builder Jean-Marie
Messier, sending Vivendi's shares as much as 17% higher after a
grueling sell-off this week.</LD>
<LD>   In a sign the French establishment had moved in to save the
teetering group, Vivendi unveiled a hit squad of French business
heavyweights led by new Chairman and Chief Executive Jean-Rene
Fourtou to take the reins of the world's second biggest media group.</LD>
<TE>   Vivendi appointed Axa insurance boss Claude Bebear, one of
France's most influential businessmen and the driving force behind
Messier's ejection, to the board and put him in charge of a new
finance committee, making him the power behind Vivendi's throne.</TE>
<TE>   "Bebear has the credibility to restore market confidence," bankers
at CSFB said in a research note.</TE>
<TE>   Fourtou and Bebear's first task will be securing short-term funds
after the group's debt ratings were cut to high-risk "junk" level.
Vivendi said it already was in talks with its main credit banks to
secure new credit "as soon as feasible" and the group set a two-week
deadline to resolve its cash problems.</TE>
<TE>   Concerns that Vivendi is struggling with its $18.5-billion debt
after its credit ratings were slashed, wiped a third off the market
value of the group in just three days this week.</TE>
<TE>   The shares have lost 75% so far this year amid mounting fears of a
cash crisis or accounting and debt problems. But they closed up 5.5%
on Thursday after Fourtou said he was confident Vivendi could make
ends meet.</TE>
<TE>   "The new team was essentially hired to sort out Vivendi's
short-term liquidity and it's likely to succeed in that. That's all
the market wants right now, it's not worrying about strategy too
much," said one London-based analyst.</TE>
<TE>   Messier had been blamed for many of Vivendi's woes after
transforming a water utility into a media titan, which is home to
prized assets including Hollywood's Universal Studios and the French
pay-TV station Canal Plus.</TE>
<TE>   Fending off talk that Vivendi may break up its scattered portfolio
of Hollywood movies, rap artists, water supplies and sewage farms to
pay back debt, the government and sources close to the new board
warned against dismantling the Messier empire.</TE>
<TE>   Culture Minister Jean-Jacques Aillagon said he wrote to Fourtou to
spell out his "vigilance, concern and worry" over the future of
Vivendi, which he called an "essential part of the French cultural
heritage."</TE>
<TE>   French politicians are keen to keep at least Vivendi's water and
TV business in French hands. Canal Plus is partly responsible for
funding France's cinema industry, a hot political issue in a country
proud of its cultural independence.</TE>
<TE>   "No breakup is envisaged at this stage. There's no need for it
from a strategic angle," said a source close to the board.</TE>
<TE>   The Vivendi crisis has triggered speculation it could be forced to
sell back the U.S. media assets it brought from the Canadian Bronfman
family two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   That would leave Vivendi looking barely different from the
diversified water company Messier began running in 1996, when its
stock price was almost twice what it is now.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that [media] content is essential for the various
networks we have. It would be wrong to sell Universal Music or
Universal Studios at a cheap price," another source close to Vivendi
board members told Reuters.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the clean-up operation, the new management issued a
two-page statement late Wednesday setting out Vivendi Universal's
funding needs for the next four weeks in a bid to soothe fears about
an imminent liquidity crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Fourtou is expected to preside over the sale of at
least one of Vivendi's core businesses to make debt more manageable.
The most likely to go would be the rest of its stake in water unit
Vivendi Environnement and Canal Plus--as long as they remain French,
analysts said.</TE>

<HD>Scandals Hit Home: She's Customer of MCI, Adelphia, Martha
Stewart</HD>
<DH>Culture: As corporate controversies mount, some fear that
weary consumers will grow to accept corruption.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Marty Huyette's home looks much like the others on her quiet street
in Redondo Beach.</LD>
<LD>   But it is a House of Scandal.</LD>
<LD>   Huyette's MCI long-distance telephone service is from WorldCom
Inc.; her cable TV is from Adelphia Communications Corp.; and she has
a subscription to Martha Stewart Living magazine.</LD>
<TE>   All three are embroiled in high-profile corporate controversies.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no way to avoid it," Huyette said. "Here I am in my
lovely little house, and my providers just happen to be [in trouble].
I don't have much choice in the matter."</TE>
<TE>   That may be the case for the utilities, but what about Stewart,
head of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc.?</TE>
<TE>   "Let he who is without sin cast the first stone," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The nearest most people used to get to corporate scandal was a
Harold Robbins or Sidney Sheldon novel. Now it's as close as the
phone or TV in the living room.</TE>
<TE>   "One suddenly finds that these corporate scandals are a lot more
interesting when they concern companies we have an intimate
relationship to," said Robert Thompson, professor of media and
popular culture at Syracuse University.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have ever made one of Martha Stewart's centerpieces out of
grapevines, it's a whole lot more relevant to your life than Enron
Corp. Martha brings a celebrity personality to corporate scandals in
a way Kenneth L. Lay never could. He can't make a good vegetarian
meatloaf."</TE>
<TE>   Huyette is a triple corporate scandal threat, but there are
millions who are touched by at least one of the companies. WorldCom
has about 20 million customers, Adelphia has about 5.7 million and
Martha Stewart Living goes out monthly to 2.4 million subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   That's a lot of intimacy with scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Huyette said she should have known from her last MCI bill that
parent company WorldCom was making desperate moves.</TE>
<TE>   A former movie set decorator who now designs interiors for
retailers ranging from mall carts to entire stores, Huyette reads the
fine-print inserts that come stuffed inside bill envelopes.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a 5-cent-a-minute plan, but in my June bill there was a
line that said my Sunday rate was going to 20 cents."</TE>
<TE>   She called and threatened to switch services. It worked--MCI found
her a new plan that made her happy.</TE>
<TE>   The scandal didn't enter into it.</TE>
<TE>   "You get kind of vested in these companies," Thompson said. "You
can go from cable to satellite, but it's a hassle. You can switch
long-distance companies, but maybe you get airline mileage from them.</TE>
<TE>   "You end up thinking that you prefer a little corruptive service."</TE>
<TE>   That's the danger, said University of Chicago sociologist Ari
Adut, who specializes in ongoing French political scandals.</TE>
<TE>   "People get numb to scandal. Some got so used to it in France they
think, 'Why vote?' " Adut said.</TE>
<TE>   "Here the danger is that there will be such a high expectation of
corporate corruption, foreign investors will stop investing in
America. We would all feel the effects."</TE>
<TE>   As bad as the news has been, that doomsday scenario still seems
far off. Especially on a pleasant afternoon in Redondo Beach, sitting
under a graceful pepper tree behind the house of scandal. Huyette
snaps off a low branch.</TE>
<TE>   "Martha uses the berries from this kind of tree in her wreathes,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   She is an unabashed fan of Stewart and hopes the magazine will not
be harmed by the scandal. "Gosh, I just subscribed for two more
years," she said. "It would not work without her. She is the empire,
like Oprah."</TE>
<TE>   Huyette, who herself is an entrepreneur, dreams of a time when she
can simplify her life and move far from contact with most suspect
corporations.</TE>
<TE>   "At night I turn out all the lights before I got to bed, and I can
still see all these little buttons of light on the equipment--the
fax, computer, printer, scanner, phone, VCR, battery charger. And
sometimes I just laugh at how ridiculous it is.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that maybe I could move to New Mexico. Live simply. No
computer, no television, maybe even no phone except for emergencies."</TE>
<TE>   No Martha?</TE>
<TE>   Huyette thought for a moment.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, I would probably still get it. I'm addicted to make-overs."</TE>

<HD>Apparel Retailers Catch New Girls' Surfing Wave</HD>
<DH>Sales may beat men's, and a new film could help</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE EARNEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Male surfers may still rule at the beach, but females are hijacking
the surf wear industry, driving sales and influencing marketing at
Southern California's largest surf apparel firms.</LD>
<LD>   Quiksilver Inc. in Huntington Beach recently predicted that
revenue from girls' products will eclipse sales to men and boys
within two years, an amazing acknowledgment from the sales leader of
an industry that once existed solely for males.</LD>
<LD>   Irvine-based Billabong USA, which launched its girls' line three
years ago, says sales of those products have swelled more than 50%
annually. That growth could explode after Aug. 16, when Universal
Pictures releases "Blue Crush," a movie about female surfers who will
be outfitted in Billabong clothes.</LD>
<TE>   Despite some skepticism about whether the movie accurately depicts
the lives of surfers, many insiders predict it will pump sales for
surf wear manufacturers and retailers, increase female attendance at
surfing schools and boost circulation for girls' surfing magazines.
Surf Diva surf school in La Jolla said its attendance jumped as soon
as the film's trailers started showing a few weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   But it is Billabong that stands to be the big winner, insiders
say, because its logos will be stretched across big screens from New
York to California.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be huge for them," said Sean Smith, a spokesman for
the Surf Industry Manufacturing Assn. in San Clemente. "A pretty
young girl runs on the screen and her rash guard (wetsuit-type shirt)
has 'Billabong' on it. That product placement is worth a fortune in
advertising dollars."</TE>
<TE>   "Blue Crush" is a testament to change taking place in the surf
world, because its budget was the largest ever for a surf movie, and
it's about females.</TE>
<TE>   "There's never been a film that cost as much or one that's been
promoted as heavily, not even close," said Matt Warshaw, a surf book
author in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   The $2.4-billion surf wear industry welcomes the movie's opening,
just as fall products start hitting stores. There have been signs
that business is picking up this year after a rocky 2001. An upturn
in this industry is particularly important to Southern California,
where most of these companies are based.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim-based Pacific Sunwear of California Inc., which sells
clothes and other products for surfers and skateboarders, predicts
that women's products will account for 45% of its sales this year. To
push its juniors business, PacSun will spend a record $10 million on
marketing, which will include placing ads in mainstream magazines
such as Seventeen, Teen People and YM, said Carol Apkarian, the
company's marketing director. Other than in-store advertising,
virtually all of the company's marketing this year will target
females, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "It needs to be a larger portion of our business since, let's face
it, girls are the shoppers," Apkarian said.</TE>
<TE>   Because Billabong is one of the three top-selling brands at PacSun
stores--along with Quiksilver and Hurley--the retailer is helping
with "Blue Crush" promotions. "It's an action sports movie that
appeals to teens, starring women, so it does just about everything we
want it to do," Apkarian said.</TE>
<TE>   Although most girls who buy surf wear will never ride a wave, the
number of female surfers is increasing. Of the 2.4 million people age
9 and older who surfed last year, 16% to 22% were female, said Angelo
Ponzi, owner of Board-Trac, a market research firm in Trabuco Canyon.
The number of females who surf every day jumped 120% from 1999 to
2001, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The growth in women's surfing prompted O'Neill Inc. to produce a
line of wetsuits that will make it easier for females to bear cold
waters, said Tom Brady, marketing director for the Santa Cruz firm.</TE>
<TE>   "We're doing more technical products for women because they're
demanding it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the women's market, technology and frivolity meet. Surf Diva,
for example, sells floral rash guards in pink and purple and "Daisy
Mae" surfboards emblazoned with a hand-drawn daisy.</TE>
<TE>   Making products for females gives companies much more latitude,
because girls generally aren't hung up on so-called "core" issues,
such as whether a brand is rooted in surfing, or where it's sold.</TE>
<TE>   "With girls, there's not so much worry about 'selling out,' " said
Kai Stearns, editor of Surfing Girl magazine in San Clemente. That
probably made it easier for Billabong to tie its juniors brand to a
movie about girls, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "If that was the guys, they wouldn't have done it because it's
like 'Oh, we're too cool for that,' " she said.</TE>
<TE>   Surf wear companies have been forced to step up their marketing to
keep pace with the growth of the girls' market. That growth has
increased the interest of so-called outsiders who now also sell surf
apparel, including Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. and Gap Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Movie Deal Called 'Uncharted Territory'</TE>
<TE>   Most consider the "Blue Crush" deal a major coup for Billabong,
although Quiksilver said it didn't compete for the deal and Costa
Mesa-based Hurley International said product placement deals are too
"geeky" for its brand.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything I've heard is that everybody wishes it was them,"
Stearns said.</TE>
<TE>   Billabong won't say how much it boosted its ad budget to snag the
product placement agreement or discuss other financial details of the
deal. Universal Pictures declined to be interviewed.</TE>
<TE>   "This is uncharted territory," said Jessica Trent Nichols,
marketing manager for Billabong's juniors division. "No one in the
surf industry has ever done a deal like this. The amount of branding
we have in the film is almost ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   Although it's a kick to see the Billabong brand blown up on the
screen, attaching a surf wear company to a movie it can't control is
inherently risky, Trent Nichols said.</TE>
<TE>   "That can be scary," she said. "In the surf industry, we're
usually afraid it's going to be some little beach bunnies running
around--your 'Baywatch' deal. This was a little more raw and
realistic."</TE>
<TE>   Some say the movie will feel authentic partly because it uses
professional surfers, both as stunt doubles and playing themselves.
But not everyone agrees.</TE>
<TE>   Naysayers, who tend to be male, say "Blue Crush" is too
"Hollywood" to accurately depict the life of surfers. Sam George,
editor of Surfer magazine in Dana Point, scoffed at the fact that the
female lead falls for a quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   "As if any woman surfer would ever go out with a football player,"
George said. "The movie is absurd, and like all absurd Hollywood
movies, it will cause a little tiny blurp of interest."</TE>
<TE>   Still, George acknowledged that "Blue Crush" could "touch off a
mini-trend in women's surf fashion" because it is sure to expand
awareness of surfing in land-locked areas.</TE>
<TE>   "That's been the backbone of the whole surf wear industry, getting
people in Iowa to dress like surfers," George said. "They don't make
those millions selling to girl surfers."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly it is youths who don't surf--and many who'll never see
an ocean--who will fuel the growth of these companies.</TE>
<TE>   Surf wear includes a wide array of products. Generally, the
clothes are stylish, youthful and comfortable, and include shorts,
T-shirts, jeans and sundresses. At the moment, a retro trend is
sweeping the industry, producing clothes nearly identical to those
sold in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   The surf products are alluring to youths in middle America because
of an image conjured up by marketers. Some companies emphasize a
laid-back, stereotypically Southern California lifestyle. Others push
edgier products, clothes that girls can wear in clubs and on dates.</TE>
<TE>   Although this stretches the definition of surf wear beyond the
snapping point, industry insiders say that if you trace the product
back far enough, you'll find the sand, and that's part of the
attraction.</TE>
<TE>   "They're born from the beach," said Smith, the manufacturing
association's spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Staying ahead of the fashion curve has become increasingly
important to surf wear companies, and fashion will become even more
crucial as women gravitate to these brands.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at companies like Volcom and some of the other
younger ones out here, it's not just about functionality, it's about
style," Smith said. "You're designing a line that people in New York
will look at and say, 'That's just really cool.' "</TE>
<TE>   Roxy is at the root of the female surfer market, a brand
launched--very gingerly--in the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, Quiksilver placed Roxy labels on bathing suits; then it
tried a few denim pieces. But when girls started showing up on
beaches in their boyfriends' trunks, "a lightbulb" flipped on, and
the company started cranking out board shorts for girls, said Randy
Hild, who helped build the Roxy brand.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a pretty dull lightbulb, it wasn't a brainstorm or
anything," Hild added. "No one really got it."</TE>
<TE>   Except female consumers, who began snapping up board shorts
instead of bikinis.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, Quiksilver was pouring money into advertising and changing
the focus of surf wear marketing. Instead of ads centered on surfing,
this marketing seized on a lifestyle.</TE>
<TE>   "They took pretty surfer girls, cute little surfers and showed
them having a great time together at the beach," George said. "They
were people endorsing a lifestyle, and that let other women go, 'Hey,
that could be me.' "</TE>
<TE>   "Let's face it, pro surfing is a blip on the American cultural
scene," George added. "But surf as a lifestyle is one of the most
dominant, prevalent marketing genres in America."</TE>
<TE>   Roxy kept "blowing up," as they say in the industry. Sales at
least doubled each year through 1999, when revenue from the brand hit
the "magical 100 million mark," Hild said. Quiksilver also launched a
Teenie Wahine brand to snag younger girls.</TE>
<TE>   'Gender-Biased' Industry Changes Its Thinking</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, other surf wear companies paddled like crazy to catch
the same wave.</TE>
<TE>   "Suddenly," George said, "the incredibly gender-biased surf wear
industry said, 'Wait a minute. Women buy way more clothing and
accessories than guys do. What were we thinking?' "</TE>
<TE>   Today, the Roxy brand includes luggage, shoes, sheets, lamps,
frames, jewelry boxes, license plate holders and steering wheel
covers.</TE>
<TE>   "Who would have thought a women's surf brand would be bigger than
the men's brand?" Hild said. "No one could have predicted that."</TE>

<HD>GM Jolts Electric Vehicle Market</HD>
<DH>Autos: Critics say the firm is trying to skirt a California
mandate by giving away limited-use neighborhood cars.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Motors Corp., which is suing in federal court to block
California's zero-emission vehicle mandate, has decided nevertheless
to jump into the market with its own version of a low-speed
neighborhood electric vehicle.</LD>
<LD>   The giant auto maker's tactics, however, are upsetting other auto
makers, environmentalists and some regulators.</LD>
<LD>   GM, which has publicly questioned the safety of the golf-cart-
based neighborhood electric vehicles, plans to give away 5,000 NEVs.
In doing so, it seeks to collect enough bonus credits from the state
to satisfy its entire zero-emission vehicle requirement under the
so-called ZEV Mandate that kicks in with the launch of the 2003 model
year.</LD>
<TE>   The California Air Resources Board says there are "some concerns"
that GM's program violates the spirit of the mandate and that the
auto maker is seeking to gain undeserved credits. A ruling from the
board on whether GM can earn full credit for a limited-use give-away
program is expected as early as next week.</TE>
<TE>   Whereas its Big Three rivals Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler
are selling their NEV products to agencies, institutions and
individuals, GM plans to give its two-passenger Pathways to
businesses, schools, hospitals and other agencies and institutions
that would use them only in closed-campus environments and not take
them on most public roads.</TE>
<TE>   And the company is giving the NEVs only for a year, after which
the recipients could buy them at a steep discount or return them to
GM and its partners, Georgia golf cart maker Club Car Corp. and
Detroit-based ZEV Exchange, a company started last year to broker
zero-emission vehicles and the credits that auto makers can earn for
providing them.</TE>
<TE>   "There is some question as to whether GM should receive full
credit if it is only placing the vehicles for one year," said Jerry
Martin, a spokesman for the California air board.</TE>
<TE>   Said David Modisette, executive director of the California
Electric Transportation Coalition: "Our concern, not just with GM but
with all the auto makers, is that when you start giving them away,
then you are not trying to make a real business out of it but are
using it purely as a way to satisfy regulatory issues. That's not
really a good-faith effort to create a real market."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, GM is sponsoring a bill in the state Legislature
that could give the California Highway Patrol unilateral authority to
restrict NEVs to streets with speed limits of 25 mph or less.</TE>
<TE>   The bill's author, Assemblyman John Campbell (R-Irvine), said
Wednesday that he was aware of concerns that the measure favors GM
and would withdraw it if Ford and DaimlerChrysler would not endorse
it as well.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, the vehicles are permitted on streets with speed limits
of up to 35 mph. DaimlerChrysler believes that a lower limit would
effectively kill NEVs' usefulness, said legislative affairs officer
Reg Modlin, because people would be unable to take them out of their
residential neighborhoods for trips, say, to the supermarket.</TE>
<TE>   "We oppose [the bill] because it is basically a GM strategy to
mess with their competitors," said V. John White, Sacramento-based
lobbyist for the Sierra Club.</TE>
<TE>   The purpose of a NEV is to provide an alternative to
pollution-causing gasoline-powered vehicles. Supporters say that many
local trips now made in standard automobiles or trucks could be made
in NEVs, reducing pollution while allowing individuals the freedom a
personal vehicle offers.</TE>
<TE>   There are only about 1,000 NEVs in use in California
now--including scores of the Neighbor model from Ford-owned Think
Mobility that were donated by Ford to the national parks in the
state. But the ZEV Mandate is expected to foster their rapid growth
if it survives the federal court challenge being pressed by GM and
DaimlerChrysler.</TE>
<TE>   That's because the mandate requires major auto makers to provide a
small number of zero- emission vehicles for "placement" with
consumers in California each year. Cart-based NEVs are one such type
of vehicle, and far more expensive full-function electric cars and
trucks are another.</TE>
<TE>   GM and other auto makers have said they cannot sell standard-size
electric vehicles for even a small fraction of what they cost to
build, and the mandate allows them for a time to offset the
requirement for those vehicles with NEVs.</TE>
<TE>   Because of a complex system of extra credits for early
introduction, GM would get credit for 20,000 zero-emission vehicles
if it placed just 5,000 NEVs in the state this year. That would
enable the auto maker to satisfy its ZEV requirement without having
to build or market larger vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   GM has seized on the mandate's use of the term "placement" to mean
that it can give the carts away. Nowhere in the mandate is there a
requirement that the vehicles be sold. Some credits are granted for
providing vehicles that can be sold, and more credits are granted for
placement.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives for Ford and DaimlerChrysler said their companies
would not criticize a competitor's market tactics. But privately, the
companies are furious, seeing GM's move as hampering efforts to build
a sustainable market in which motorists willingly buy
alternative-fuel vehicles such as the battery-powered NEVs.</TE>
<TE>   Modlin, who described the neighborhood vehicles sold by
DaimlerChrysler subsidiary Global Electric Motorcars as larger, "with
more features and more utility," than the GM Club Car vehicles, said
Chrysler executives "certainly hope the GM approach won't have a
negative affect on the market."</TE>
<TE>   Sara Tatchio, Ford's environmental affairs spokeswoman, said each
auto maker "has to take its own approach ... but we would like to
have seen the market develop in a more natural manner" with
competitive selling.</TE>
<TE>   For its part, GM said there is no reason to criticize its plan.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a free market, and if we believe it is in the best interest
of GM, then we will go ahead and do that," spokesman Donn Walker said
of the giveaway. "Our competitors are free to lower their prices.
It's no different than big incentives on sedans. Maybe this will help
bring the cost to consumers down."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, although DaimlerChrysler's GEM vehicles list for $5,995,
they are being sold through membership chain Costco for $3,995.</TE>
<TE>   The benefits of the program to GM, Walker said, are that "we gain
ZEV credits and meet compliance standards; it allows us to do some
good by placing them mainly with nonprofit organizations; and it
helps us gain insight and research into NEVs, the market for them and
their use patterns because we are requiring those who get them to
fill out occasional surveys."</TE>

<HD>States Screen Stocks for Ties to Terrorism</HD>
<DH>Investing: Fearful of becoming unwitting supporters of
terrorists, state and local officials are reviewing portfolios.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN IRITANI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State and municipal officials fearful of becoming unwitting
supporters of global terrorism are seeking ways to screen their stock
investments.</LD>
<LD>   Pennsylvania, California and the city of New York are reviewing a
new product called the Global Security Risk Monitor that identifies
260 firms doing business in six countries--Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Syria,
Libya and North Korea--identified by the State Department as sponsors
of terrorism, some of them suppliers of weapons.</LD>
<LD>   Though the U.S. government has published a financial blacklist of
210 alleged terrorists or terrorist-financing organizations,
officials at the National Assn. of State Auditors, Comptrollers and
Treasurers said they want to go further to ensure their investments
are not going into the coffers of Al Qaeda or other groups.</LD>
<TE>   "No Americans want to see our pension moneys go to companies
supporting terrorism," said Pennsylvania State Treasurer Barbara
Hafer, president of the national association and overseer of state
retirement funds worth more than $90 billion. "It is complex, but if
we can set up the [screening] system, we can send a very large
message to people that we don't like what they are doing."</TE>
<TE>   The monitor is produced by the Investor Responsibility Research
Center and the Conflict Securities Advisory Board, a Washington group
headed by Roger Robinson, a former National Security Council
official. Washington-based IRRC, a 30-year-old research firm
specializing in corporate governance, produced a similar list used
during the successful South Africa divestiture campaign.</TE>
<TE>   State and local officials have taken the lead in shareholder
divestiture campaigns aimed at tobacco companies and Swiss banks
accused of collaborating with the Nazis.</TE>
<TE>   Because it is global and covert, terrorism is far more complex
than earlier targets of shareholder divestiture campaigns, such as
those aimed at South Africa's apartheid regime or the military
government in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma. An antiterrorism
investment movement could pose a serious threat to corporate
reputations already battered by a spate of scandals.</TE>
<TE>   David DeRosa, president of Connecticut-based DeRosa Research &amp;
Trading Inc., said a company selling "Coca-Cola in the Sudan"
shouldn't face a problem. "On the other hand, if you're selling
electronics or something that's of a critical nature, your company
could wind up becoming an investment leper."</TE>
<TE>   The IRRC will not disclose the firms on its global security list.
However, Germany's Siemens, Japan's Mitsubishi Corp. and
Houston-based energy giant Conoco Inc. reportedly are named. U.S.
firms account for just 15% of the total, which is not surprising
because the U.S. government already has economic sanctions against
the suspect countries.</TE>
<TE>   Background Checks</TE>
<TE>   Robinson said his firm is not advocating shareholder divestiture
but simply providing investors with the information to make an
informed choice. The monitor includes background on company
operations, a political and economic snapshot of the targeted
countries and an assessment of the security risks of key industries
such as energy and telecommunications. None of the companies is
accused of illegal activities.</TE>
<TE>   "Getting ahead of these potential blows to the share value of
portfolio companies is what risk management is all about," he said.</TE>
<TE>   California State Treasurer Phil Angelides said he has asked the
California Public Employees' Retirement System, known as CalPERS, and
the California State Teachers' Retirement System, or CalSTRS, to
evaluate the monitor and "see if it raises any issues in our
portfolio." The treasurer is on the boards of both funds, which are
among the nation's largest, with portfolios of about $250 billion.</TE>
<TE>   At the urging of Angelides, CalPERS this year adopted standards
that for the first time linked investment decisions to nonfinancial
issues such as political stability and human-rights protections.
Under the new policy, CalPERS will not invest in Thailand, Indonesia,
Malaysia or China.</TE>
<TE>   Angelides said security issues were not included in that review
because the state couldn't get enough information about the funding
sources for the global terrorism network.</TE>
<TE>   "If the federal government wants to facilitate global investment,
it must also provide the tools to protect American investors against
unknowing actions that could threaten our society and our country,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Congress also has threatened to jump into the fray. Sen. Robert C.
Byrd (D-W.Va.) has proposed legislation requiring companies that want
to access the U.S. capital markets to disclose financial dealings of
more than $10,000 with countries that sponsor terrorism. The Senate
Select Intelligence Committee has approved a provision by Sen. Fred
Thompson (R-Tenn.) that would require U.S. intelligence agencies to
investigate whether foreign groups involved in the "proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction" are raising money in U.S. capital
markets.</TE>
<TE>   Drawing the Line</TE>
<TE>   Though the U.S. has restricted business with a few nations over
the years, it traditionally has kept its capital markets open to
foreign firms that meet its investment standards.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials and financiers fear that casting too wide a net
will frighten away global investors and further weaken a stock market
already battered by the technology collapse and corporate scandals.
Companies could take their business to other stock markets, and
foreign governments could retaliate by banning U.S. firms from their
markets.</TE>
<TE>   The problem, analysts said, is knowing where to draw the line in
an economy in which companies are global, capital flows like water
across borders and the ownership of assets can easily be obscured
through dummy corporations. Even when U.S. firms are barred from
trading with countries such as Sudan, Libya or Iraq, there often are
exceptions made for providing food or medical products.</TE>
<TE>   "I may choose not to invest in Korean construction companies with
an operation in the Sudan--that's easy," said Mark Headley, president
of San Francisco-based Matthews Asia Funds. "But does that mean you
don't own any international oil companies? Does that mean you can't
own IBM or you can't own Procter &amp; Gamble?"</TE>
<TE>   Executives doing business in the targeted countries said they are
legitimately bringing badly needed development to impoverished
nations.</TE>
<TE>   Paula Davis, a spokeswoman for Siemens, which has sold telecom,
power equipment and medical supplies in Iraq, Syria and Iran, said
the firm is "in full compliance with pertinent U.S. and [European
Union] laws as well as sanctions and restrictions imposed by the
United Nations."</TE>
<TE>   Conoco Chairman Archie Dunham has pushed for eliminating U.S.
sanctions on those oil-rich Persian Gulf countries, arguing that they
only benefit foreign competitors that are happy to fill the void.</TE>
<TE>   Sondra Fowler, a Conoco spokeswoman, said the company's business
in those countries is "minimal" and did not pose a risk to investors.
In 1995, the Clinton administration imposed a ban on business with
Iran, forcing Conoco to abandon a $2-billion oil deal later taken
over by the French. But a British subsidiary of Conoco has done
consulting work for Iran's state-owned oil company. The company was
forced to abandon its oil concessions in Libya when the Reagan
administration imposed sanctions in 1986 but hopes to reassert
control if the sanctions are lifted.</TE>
<TE>   Lack of Clear Evidence</TE>
<TE>   The lack of a clear distinction between the good guys and the bad
guys is what frustrates state officials. Since Sept. 11, Hafer has
met with officials from the General Accounting Office, the Treasury
Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission but said she
hasn't been able to "get to second base" on the issue of how--or
whether--they should be screening out companies with terrorist
connections.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary Rob Nichols said the
government welcomes the efforts by the state treasurers to weed out
questionable holdings from their portfolios. But he said the U.S.
government can expand the blacklist only when there is "clear,
credible and convincing information" that a person is a "terrorist or
financier of terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   SEC spokesman John Nester said companies listing in U.S. capital
markets are not specifically required to disclose business operations
in countries accused of terrorism or human-rights violations but must
notify investors of anything that would present a "material risk."
That would include having a large plant or major supplier in a rogue
nation that could be the target of a U.S. attack or trade embargo.</TE>
<TE>   With threats of another terrorist attack becoming a regular
occurrence, companies ignore these investor concerns at their peril,
warned Stephen Davis, president of Davis Global Advisors, a
Boston-based firm specializing in global corporate governance.</TE>
<TE>   "What's clear is anyone in the investing community is going to be
very skittish about the prospect of a newspaper story linking the
fund's investments to any company involved in terror," he said.
"That's something that's got to give fund managers nightmares."</TE>
<TE>   Take Canada's Talisman Energy Inc., which has come under fire for
its involvement in the Greater Nile Petroleum Operating Co. in Sudan.
That project is a major source of revenue for the Sudanese
government, which is accused of harboring terrorists and waging a
religious war in which millions were killed over the last two
decades. In 1997, the U.S. imposed a ban on U.S. companies trading
with Sudan and froze all government assets.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has refused to bar Talisman from the U.S. stock market,
but a divestiture campaign led by congressional critics, church
leaders and human-rights groups has shaved as much as $10 off the
company's share price, said Brian Prokop, an energy analyst at
Calgary's Peters &amp; Co. CalPERS and TIAA-CREF, the giant teacher's
retirement fund, were among those that sold their Talisman stock in
1999.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Greater Nile project has been a profitable venture,
Talisman officials are entertaining bids. The Indian government last
week approved a $750-million offer by the state-run Oil &amp; Natural Gas
Corp. for the Canadian company's 25% share of the Sudan project, but
Talisman has not confirmed whether the deal has been finalized.</TE>
<TE>   Any company buying into Sudan must weigh the financial gains
against the possibility of a terrorism or human-rights-related
backlash in the U.S capital markets, Prokop said.</TE>
<TE>   "If you get denied access to the U.S. capital markets, and if it's
not perceived as too much of an ouch, then it might be worth the
risk," he said. "But for the smarter companies, if you can avoid it,
you certainly would. You would be looking for other places that may
have equal risk but may not have the same perceptual risk."</TE>

<HD>Surprise: L.A. Schools Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amateur hour is over in the department charged with snagging state
construction funds for the Los Angeles Unified School District. Two
years ago, the school district scored about $34 million of the new
construction funding generated by Proposition 1A, the state bond
measure approved in 1998. In the next round of funding, the district
expects to grab $650 million, or half of the $1.3 billion the State
Allocation Board is giving local districts to help build needed
schools.</LD>
<LD>   Seeing is believing in a district that has a long reputation of
either failing to deliver or coming through years behind schedule and
millions over budget.</LD>
<LD>   That was then and this is now, says Roy Romer, who just completed
his second year as schools superintendent.</LD>
<TE>   Romer gave the facilities funding department enough staff to
handle the volume, and construction chief Kathi Littman supplied the
construction expertise that was lacking when former principals and
football coaches were in charge. It worked.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, Los Angeles students got robbed because of
administrative incompetence and an unfair formula that doled out
money to school districts on a first-come, first-served basis.</TE>
<TE>   Speed rather than need determined how much a school district would
get from the State Allocation Board. The first district to submit a
completed application won. Small suburban and rural school districts
went to the head of the line because they could easily find vacant,
hazard-free land that was suitable for schools. Similar land in Los
Angeles long has come at a high price and often in the face of
protest from tenants and homeowners who refuse to move without a
fight. By the time the LAUSD would get a site, architectural plans
and everything else approved, the state school construction money was
gone.</TE>
<TE>   A lawsuit filed two years ago by civil rights attorneys and
community groups forced the State Allocation Board to put need first.
That change gave the edge to the overcrowded Los Angeles district but
guaranteed nothing if it missed the deadline, which it too often did.</TE>
<TE>   This time around, district administrators got it right. We look
forward to a time when good work by LAUSD administrators is no longer
a surprise.</TE>

<LD>Who'd have thought that the opponents of open government could
include the League of California Cities, the California State Assn.
of Counties and the University of California? All of them
unfortunately disapprove of a state constitutional amendment that
would broaden open records laws that have been restricted over the
years by court decisions. Shame on them.</LD>
<LD>   Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco), the
sponsor of Senate Constitutional Amendment 7, notes that current law
contains no real punishment for any government agency that wrongly
withholds information.</LD>
<LD>   This ineffective statute barred reporters from digging into
scandals at the state Department of Insurance and kept secret for
half a century the records of a legislative committee that
investigated prominent Californians for alleged involvement in
Communist Party activities.</LD>
<TE>   Burton says his proposal simply shifts the burden of proof.
Currently, the news media and members of the public must first show
why they should be allowed access to government documents and
records. SCA 7 says government agencies must demonstrate why
materials--for instance, those that involve personnel or legal
matters--should be kept secret.</TE>
<TE>   Though the confidentiality of certain information that the state
keeps, such as individual Medi-Cal records, should certainly be
protected, the Legislature should be selective about allowing
loopholes.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents say the proposed law is too broad. Their argument sounds
like bureaucratic protection of paperwork.</TE>
<TE>   Burton's amendment passed the Senate last Friday on a vote of 34
to 0. Now it's in the Assembly, where Burton expects opponents to
harden their positions and make it more difficult to put the measure
before state voters in the Nov. 5 general election. The amendment
requires approval by two-thirds of the members of each house to be
added to the ballot. Time is short. The secretary of state says the
amendment must clear the Legislature by July 17, though sometimes
these deadlines can be stretched.</TE>
<TE>   Citizens have cause these days to distrust officials who try to
keep governmental information secret for any but the most urgent
reasons. Preventing SCA 7 from getting on the ballot would represent
another serious denial of that information.</TE>

<HD>A Hollywood Fade-Out</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Clint Eastwood's line, the one about a man having to know his
limitations, comes to mind in the wake of Chief Executive Jean-Marie
Messier's abrupt departure after less than two years at the helm of
Vivendi Universal. The 45-year-old Frenchman became the latest
leading man to be ridden out of town, blinded by Hollywood's bright
lights. Universal generated a staggering $30 billion in debt during a
media and communications company buying spree but never convinced
investors that it had a cohesive strategy to tie the purchases
together.</LD>
<LD>   Consumers undoubtedly will one day augment entertainment delivered
through television sets and movie screens with content sent straight
to cell phones and the Internet, but not on Messier's unrealistically
short timetable. Messier also failed at the impossible balancing act
of running a transatlantic entertainment company from a posh New York
City office with one's cultural feet planted firmly in France.</LD>
<LD>   Which brings up another line spoken by Eastwood, the one about
feeling lucky. Messier obviously felt charmed enough to bring a
once-sleepy French water utility to buy a storied Hollywood studio
and create a global media powerhouse. His mantra was "synergy"; his
high-voltage approach initially was persuasive. But the story line
crumbled as Vivendi Universal generated record losses.</LD>
<TE>   Vivendi Universal is just a new twist on the old "Foreign-Owned
Company Tries to Squeeze Universal Studios Into Its Business Plan"
script. Japan's Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. had a fling with
Universal when it was known as MCA Inc., eventually selling its stake
to Canada's Seagram Co., which, two years ago sold a majority stake
to Vivendi.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood reporters chronicling Messier's fall from grace could
have reprinted the lead of a 1998 newspaper story about Seagram
executive Edgar Bronfman Jr.'s time in Tinseltown: "An outsider buys
a studio, vows to tame a notoriously unruly business, then proceeds
to have his lunch eaten." Then again, Messier's wide-screen dreams
are understandable. Who wouldn't rather sell entertainment than
water? Though there are similarities in the Matsushita, Seagram and
Vivendi disasters, each company played a leading role in its own
wrecking. Matsushita's conservative business practices clashed with
Hollywood's big spenders, and Bronfman's "do it my way" management
style generated chaos among his studio executives.</TE>
<TE>   Enter the Frenchman, who made the French-speaking world delight,
at first, in his audacity. He wrote a 247-page autobiography titled
"J6M.com," which, loosely translated, stood for "Jean-Marie Messier,
Me, Myself, Master of the World." As Messier's hope collapsed, the
value of Vivendi Universal shares plummeted. Reality finally set in:
It is tough enough for AOL Time Warner to pull off the global media
powerhouse role, much less a French water utility.</TE>
<TE>   It would be easy to end with a gratuitous quote from "Hang 'Em
High." But we'll stick with a decade-old headline about another
Hollywood legend who crashed and burned: "The Insatiable Appetite and
Other Deadly Sins of Mike Ovitz."</TE>

<LD>I would like to praise Robert Scheer for having the guts to speak out
against the arrogant and narrow-minded stand of the overwhelming
majority of Americans ("God's Got Nothing to Do With the Pledge of
Allegiance Furor," Commentary, July 2).</LD>
<LD>   The Pledge of Allegiance should be equally available for all
Americans, not just exclusively for the use of individuals who accept
a monotheistic belief. Let us never forget that the men who attacked
our nation on Sept. 11 believed in "God" but had no respect for the
beliefs of others. What makes this country great are the words
"united we stand" because, despite our differences, we love and will
fight for this great nation.</LD>
<LD>   Madeleine Dunn</LD>
<TE>   New York City</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scheer is up to his usual self-contradictory tricks. While
entertaining us with his commentary, he states in the same paragraph
that belief in God is not the issue, then chastises the government's
endorsement of a monotheistic God. Who does is he think he's kidding?
His politically correct bias is about as subtle as a runaway freight
train!</TE>
<TE>   Jim Roberts</TE>
<TE>   La Mirada</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   At this very moment in history, when the large religions of the
world are debauching themselves in plain view, the leadership of this
nation can't step forward and stand for separation of church and
state. The World Trade Center was rammed for that very reason--the
terrorists want a theocratic state. Wherever they gain power they put
Islamic law in place. You wouldn't like it.</TE>
<TE>   Scheer and others have stepped forward and pointed out the massive
disconnect between our policy needs and the congressional agenda. The
Republican leadership marches behind the banner of deregulation, and
we need nothing of the sort. The Congress has on its plate numerous
policy points that are clearly anti-future and pro-stagnation, and it
does it with a busted budget. Not to worry, there will be a
correction, and the rich can ride it out.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>There must be some way to save Brian Breye's Museum in Black in
Leimert Park Village ("Museum in Black Closing, Out of Funds," June
29). When I was community relations director at UCLA's International
Student Center back in the '90s, I used to bring busloads of foreign
students to Breye's museum as part of Discover L.A., a program that
helped orient new students to the diversity in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Breye would hold the crowd of Chinese, Korean, Indian, Israeli and
European students enthralled as he wove stories about slavery,
segregation and liberation around specific pieces of the memorabilia
he had collected. He was generous with his time and knowledge, not
only with those students but also with the at-risk high school
students I used to bring by.</LD>
<LD>   Museum in Black functioned as a community living room. Whoever
walked in, from whatever part of town or of whatever skin color or
religion, was made to feel welcome and encouraged to participate in
the stimulating discussions that were always taking place. This is
not just a museum, not just a store, but an irreplaceable and
critically important space that should be maintained at any cost.

<LD>Re "Chain Reaction of Thirst in California Desert Dry Spell," June
23: As our native desert wildlife suffers in a severe drought, the
Bush administration allows damaging livestock grazing to continue on
5 million acres of the California Desert Conservation Area and Mojave
National Preserve.</LD>
<LD>   A handful of cattlemen already subsidized to graze their herds on
our public lands are being allowed to hammer habitat to dust, and
then when all the scant forage is gone, Interior Secretary Gale
Norton's field managers permit them to keep grazing livestock on our
stressed deserts by supplementing their feed. This is especially
appalling given that last summer an Interior Department judge ruled
that Norton has a duty to restrict livestock grazing to protect
endangered species and natural values.</LD>
<LD>   This is a starvation year in the California desert for the desert
tortoise, bighorn sheep and other wildlife as U.S. land managers are
more concerned with serving a few cattlemen than conserving our
American natural heritage.</LD>

<HD>A Hard-Liner Calls for Israel to Reoccupy the West Bank</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I commend Mary Curtius for "Israeli Despair Opens Door for
Hard-Liner" (July 30), which presented Israeli Cabinet member Effi
Eitam's views regarding the desirability of population transfer. It
is sad that the Arab rejection of peace has made positions such as
Eitam's popular in Israel. Since population transfer has worked
successfully to solve other irreconcilable ethnic problems, it is
heartening to see The Times report such a proposal without resorting
to the usual negativism.</LD>
<LD>   Eitam's proposals are a response to the inveterate hatred of
Arabs. They are regrettable, but the Palestinians have only
themselves to blame now that they are being advocated by many in
Israel's Jewish population. Population transfer of Jews from Arab
countries has already been implemented, with more than 2 million Jews
in Israel being descended from those who came from Arab countries
from which they were ejected after 1948. A transfer of Arab refugees
from Israel to these countries must now be seriously considered as
the most realistic solution of the Arab-Israeli conflict.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It becomes apparent to me that Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his
Cabinet are no longer occupied with protecting democracy but by using
any excuse they can to reacquire the Palestinian territory. This
includes religion, which Eitam has used in convincing Sharon to
launch the most blatantly ignorant actions thus far in the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Eitam underestimates his own people,
believing they are gullible enough to listen to his claims of moral
superiority, after he publicly prays for the Palestinians'
destruction. But the Israelis have become keener to his plot,
including rabbis like Michael Melchior. I hope for more Orthodox Jews
to speak out as he has, and convince Sharon that extremist actions
must be avoided.</TE>

centralized yet separate check-in, baggage and terminal facilities
will only exacerbate the delays. A people-mover to link the
individual terminals and parking is a fine idea, but the lack of
seamless or direct access for mass transit is a mistake.</LD>
<LD>   Not only should the Green Line enter the airport directly but a
provision for direct access by future high-speed rail should be part
of the design. Those who have used airports like Frankfurt
International or Charles de Gaulle, or even Portland International
Airport, know the convenience of truly integrated mass transit.</LD>
<LD>   Under the LAX airport plan, transit users would exit the Green
Line at Aviation Station, take a people-mover to the central check-in
facility, take another people-mover, possibly with some bags in tow,
to the baggage screening/main terminal area and finally take another
people-mover or walk to a terminal entrance. The last leg would be by
foot to the actual gate. And you thought it was bad now!</LD>
<TE>   Security is important, but the idea that one's journey from
fortress LAX would begin like a slow visit to a prison is not
comforting.</TE>

<LD>Language is no trivial matter. It affects how we think and,
therefore, how we act ("Barking Up the Wrong Tree," editorial, June
30). As a rescuer who fought successfully for new licensing
legislation to encourage people to spay and neuter their pets, I'm
convinced that guardianship will promote greater care and
responsibility toward companion animals, particularly with children
who will see themselves as guardians of their animals rather than
owners of property.</LD>

<HD>Lockyer Warns of Firms Posing as Legal Aid Services</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOCELYN Y. STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer is warning Californians to beware of
businesses that advertise "legal aid" or "legal services," only to
provide costly and shoddy services that may hurt clients in court.</LD>
<LD>   The warning, in a recently released consumer alert, is a reaction
to businesses that prey on the public's trust in legitimate legal aid
organizations.</LD>
<LD>   "The true nonprofit legal services organizations in California
provide indispensable free legal assistance to consumers who can't
afford to hire an attorney but need help while facing dangerous
domestic violence situations, evictions from their homes and other
emergencies," Lockyer said in the alert.</LD>
<TE>   Legal aid services are nonprofit, publicly funded organizations
that provide services to low-income clients at no charge or for a
minimal fee. Certain court forms refer the poor to legal aid.</TE>
<TE>   But some businesses, staffed by people who are not attorneys, have
adopted "legal aid" or similar names, leading some people to believe
that they are nonprofits.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, many of the victims ended up at the office of the
Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles, a legitimate nonprofit
organization.</TE>
<TE>   Elena Popp, executive director of the foundation, welcomed the
attorney general's alert.</TE>
<TE>   "It is actually very painful for us to see people come into this
office having paid $400, $500, $600 to someone to prepare paperwork
that is badly done," said Popp. "So they've been ripped off once by
having to pay this fee and then in court by losing their case."</TE>
<TE>   In May, the attorney general's office filed a friend of the court
brief in support of four Shasta County residents who won a case
against Modesto resident Walter Moore, who also used the name Jeff
Simmons.</TE>
<TE>   The four plaintiffs, all of whom were facing eviction, said they
were deceived into calling Moore by his use of the term "legal aid"
in advertising.</TE>
<TE>   "Here we have a profit-seeking businessman who's not a lawyer
calling himself 'Legal Aid' in the Yellow Pages and on the Internet,"
said Gary Rhoades, litigation director for the Housing Rights Center,
and lead attorney on the case.</TE>
<TE>   Moore operated a business offering several types of legal services
through advertisements that appeared in cities throughout the state.</TE>
<TE>   During the trial, former Moore employees said they had been
trained to tell callers they were the same "legal aid" mentioned in
court forms. Moore's business charged $85 to $400 to type simple
forms, Rhoades said.</TE>
<TE>   The jury found Moore guilty of violating the Unlawful Detainer
Assistance Act and of practicing law without a license and acting
with fraud, malice, or oppression.</TE>
<TE>   The judge determined that Moore had violated California's Unfair
Business Practices and False Advertising Laws. In February 2001, the
judge ordered Moore to pay restitution and issued a statewide
injunction prohibiting Moore and his associates from using the term
"legal aid" and similar names. The court ordered Moore to advertise
the verdict in newspapers in 22 cities.</TE>
<TE>   The case is on appeal.</TE>
<TE>   To verify that a legal aid organization is federally funded or to
find a local nonprofit legal aid office, consumers may refer to the
Legal Services Corp.'s Web site, www.lsc.gov/fundprog.htm.</TE>
<TE>   Those who have been victimized by document preparers who are not
attorneys should call their local district attorney or the Attorney
General's Public Inquiry Unit at (800) 952-5225. Complaints may be
filed online at www.ag.ca.gov/ consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Those in need of assistance may call the Legal Aid Foundation of
Los Angeles at (800) 399-4529.</TE>

<HD>Jeanne Bentley, 79; Veteran Educator, Counselor in Glendale
Schools</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jeanne Bentley, veteran teacher and counselor who spent her purported
retirement years as member and president of the Board of Education of
Glendale Unified School District, has died. She was 79.</LD>
<LD>   Bentley died Saturday at Verdugo Hills Hospital. No specific cause
of death was given.</LD>
<LD>   Even when she was listing her occupation as "homemaker," Bentley
was devoted to educating young people. At her death, she remained
active in 35 community organizations, including Glendale Healthy Kids
and Glendale Youth Coalition, and was in her third term on the
Glendale Board of Education. The board also elected her as its
representative to the California School Boards Assn.</LD>
<TE>   Born in Long Beach, Bentley was educated in the Glendale schools,
she would serve throughout her adult life, then went on to Taft
Junior College, UCLA and Cal State L.A. She taught elementary school
for three years, before resigning to raise the two daughters she had
with her husband, Gerald E. Bentley, who preceded her in death.</TE>
<TE>   There were no paychecks for many years, but Bentley was educating
youngsters as a volunteer. She served as Girl Scout leader, board
member of Campfire Girls, board member of Parent-Teacher Assns. at
three schools, board member and coordinator of youth programs for
both the Assistance League and the National Charity League.</TE>
<TE>   When her children went to college, so did she--to earn a master's
in counseling. Bentley earned nine state credentials and taught
elementary, junior and senior high school and was a counselor in
Glendale schools for more than 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   She also developed the Career Guidance and Resource Center for the
school district to help students find their futures. The "Career
Guidance" course she co-wrote has been emulated by other school
districts and is still required in all Glendale schools.</TE>
<TE>   To celebrate her retirement as head counselor for Crescenta Valley
High School, Bentley ran for the Board of Education and on April 6,
1993, was the top vote-getter on the five-member panel. She was
chosen as clerk, vice president and, from 1995 to 1997, president of
the board.</TE>
<TE>   Bentley easily won reelection in 1997 and again in 2001. She
dedicated herself to passing school bonds to finance school repairs
and reduce class size.</TE>
<TE>   Bentley is survived by her daughters, Robyn Brown of Woodenville,
Wash., and Brooke Moore of La Canada Flintridge; a sister, Evelyn
Bentley; and four grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service is scheduled for 3:30 p.m. Tuesday at La Canada
Presbyterian Church, 626 Foothill Blvd., La Canada Flintridge.</TE>
<TE>   The family has asked that, instead of flowers, memorial donations
be sent to the Bentley Family Charitable Trust at the Glendale
Community Foundation, P.O. Box 313, Glendale, CA 91209-0313.</TE>

<HD>Philip Bergen, 97; Guard Helped End Alcatraz Siege</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Philip Bergen was paying for a prescription in a San Francisco
drugstore when a radio flashed the news of what would later be
regarded as one of the most notorious and deadly escape attempts in
the 28-year history of Alcatraz.</LD>
<LD>   The date was May 2, 1946, the 14th anniversary of Lt. Bergen's
induction as a federal prison guard and seven years after he had
begun duty on "the Rock" in San Francisco Bay.</LD>
<LD>   Bergen quickly called the warden's office and made arrangements to
return as six inmates took nine guards hostage at the beginning of
what would be a bloody three-day battle that would leave three
inmates and two guards dead.</LD>
<TE>   But Bergen, who led the assault to retake occupied cellblocks, was
credited with saving many more lives of penal officers, the U.S.
Marines assisting them, and the 250 or so inmates then housed at the
storied prison. For his calm, courageous leadership, he was promoted
to captain of the guards, third in command of Alcatraz, which he
later described as "the most interesting place I ever lived."</TE>
<TE>   Bergen, whose recorded voice now informs tourists who flock to the
Rock with anecdotes from its years as a prison, died June 14 in a
hospice in Sun City, Ariz. He was 97 and died of natural causes.</TE>
<TE>   Born to an Irish American family in Chicago, Bergen wanted to be a
policeman but chose the security of a federal job when he came of age
in the Depression, joining the Bureau of Prisons. His first
assignment in 1932 was the Lewisburg Penitentiary in Pennsylvania,
but in 1939 he was transferred to Alcatraz, his favorite post, where
he remained for 16 years.</TE>
<TE>   From the outset, Bergen lived with the constant rumors that the
Rock would be closed within a month. He was promoted to assistant
warden at La Tuna Penitentiary in Texas and moved on in 1955, long
before Alcatraz actually was shut down in 1963.</TE>
<TE>   During his tenure, Bergen helped foil several of Alcatraz's 14
escape attempts, which involved 39 inmates. None was believed to be
successful. He could reel off statistics showing that 26 would-be
escapees were quickly recaptured, seven were shot to death by guards
and six presumably drowned in the turbulent bay waters.</TE>
<TE>   Bergen worked throughout his adult life to dispel reports--often
fanned by Hollywood interpretations such as the 1995 Kevin Bacon film
"Murder in the First" that inmates were brutally tortured and starved
on the Rock. Until his death, he advocated society's need for such a
maximum-security prison.</TE>
<TE>   At his retirement in 1967, Bergen said in the book "Alcatraz '46,"
which he helped Donald P. Denevi write in 1974:</TE>
<TE>   "No prison system, state or federal, which seriously proposes to
rehabilitate any sizable percentage of its inmates, can hope to do so
unless it has an Alcatraz--a penal institution of maximum security
and minimum privilege dedicated to the effective segregation of
convicted criminals who cannot be rehabilitated. Alcatraz Island
Prison is gone, but the Alcatraz concept lingers on, and rightly so,
because it is a valid concept."</TE>
<TE>   In the book and in comments over the years, Bergen said
incorrigible prisoners housed on Alcatraz were controlled through
isolation, loss of privileges and a restrictive diet limited to 1,200
calories a day.</TE>
<TE>   But, he said, they were never beaten or physically abused.</TE>
<TE>   "We got the people who couldn't be controlled. We did something no
other institution--state or federal--was able to do at that time,"
Bergen told The Times in 1987, when he returned to Alcatraz to record
the visitors' audiotape for the National Park Service, which now
operates the island. "We controlled these men, turned them around and
returned them back to other institutions in three to five years," he
said, "and we did it in a decent, humane way.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure there was violence at times," Bergen admitted. "There were
half a dozen murders while I was here. I was bruised and battered on
many occasions.</TE>
<TE>   "One time a con hit me in the mouth and all my expensive
bridgework was all over the floor. But we reacted to violence," he
said. "We didn't create it."</TE>
<TE>   Bergen, who lived with his wife and two young daughters in the
officers' five-acre enclave on Alcatraz during his 16 years there,
regularly attended annual reunions of guards and inmates. He quipped
in 2001 that he had finally discovered a common denominator between
the two disparate groups--age.</TE>
<TE>   Because he remembered so much of the prison history and told it so
entertainingly, he was much in demand as a speaker.</TE>
<TE>   The former prison guard, who in retirement served as police chief
of Beverly Shores, Ind., population 300, knew many of Alcatraz's most
famous guests.</TE>
<TE>   Among them was Robert Stroud, the so-called Birdman of Alcatraz,
who had maintained aviaries at other prisons and wrote books about
the care of birds. Bergen was never thrilled by Burt Lancaster's
sympathetic portrayal of Stroud in the 1962 film "The Birdman of
Alcatraz."</TE>
<TE>   During the infamous 1946 escape attempt, Bergen talked with Stroud
and relayed Stroud's assertion that no guns were being fired by
would-be escapees in the cellblock where he and other inmates not
involved in the revolt remained. Stroud asked that the guards cease
fire, and Bergen apparently persuaded the warden to agree. Bergen's
willingness to believe Stroud helped save more lives.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Bergen never romanticized the man he bluntly described as "a
homicidal, suicidal maniac."</TE>
<TE>   "His record was so bad, we just kept him in segregation," Bergen
told the Anchorage Daily News in 1996. "Stroud didn't like anybody in
the whole world except himself. He held the rest of us in utter
contempt. He had a mercurial temper that flared up at the slightest
provocation.... In our opinion, he'd kill someone if he could."</TE>
<TE>   Stroud contributed part of his book profits for defense of the
three surviving 1946 would-be escapees. Two were put to death in San
Quentin's gas chamber, and one was sentenced to life imprisonment.</TE>
<TE>   Bergen was called "Fearless Phil" for such efforts as quelling
that breakout effort. Inmates also nicknamed him "Ice" Bergen for his
strict enforcement of prison rules.</TE>
<TE>   Off duty, he loved rearing his family on the island and using the
recreational facilities along with all the community's children after
the prison boat returned them from school in San Francisco. They had
a playground, a recreation hall with bowling, pool, handball and a
gymnasium, plus movies and dances.</TE>
<TE>   Bergen planted Children's Victory Gardens during World War II,
adding sweet peas and roses to Alcatraz's meager flora, and bought
seashells at shops on Fisherman's Wharf to hide in the island's tide
pools for the children.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors include his two daughters, Pat of Lemoore, Calif., and
Kay of Phoenix; four grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Unity Is Put on Parade Across the Southland</HD>
<DH>Holiday: From Huntington Beach to Ojai, Sept. 11 injects
new meaning, along with renewed patriotism, into Independence Day
celebrations.</DH>

<LD>Javier Godinez never felt more American.</LD>
<LD>   The Mexico City native and mariachi band leader was getting ready
Thursday morning to take part in Huntington Beach's Fourth of July
Parade, tuning his strings and assessing the estimated crowd of
50,000, many bathed in red, white and blue.</LD>
<LD>   "There seems to be more unity," the Garden Grove resident
observed.</LD>
<TE>   Then, with a proud smile, he offered: "I am becoming an American
citizen in three months."</TE>
<TE>   Amid renewed anxiety over possible terrorist threats, thousands of
Southland residents celebrated the first post-Sept. 11 Independence
Day under heightened security and an even higher sense of patriotism.</TE>
<TE>   The tension was aggravated by a shooting Thursday at Los Angeles
International Airport that left three dead, including the gunman.
Although there was no immediate indication the shootings involved
terrorism, that fear fueled concerns.</TE>
<TE>   The incident certainly gave Julie Milne pause as she and her
family gathered at their summer vacation home in Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, 'Oh, my gosh! Terrorists have struck us again,' " said
Milne, who lives in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   "We are just trying to enjoy the holiday and think about the
meaning of it."</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of the fears--or perhaps because of them--Fourth of
July celebrants found meanings big and small as they clung to
tradition on this most American of holidays.</TE>
<TE>   "I was concerned about coming out here and in being in a big
crowd, but it wasn't going to stop me,'' said Tina Haas, 40, a Sylmar
homemaker as she lighted a barbecue at Hansen Dam Recreation Area in
the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Her husband, Frank, 40, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "If you hide in your house all the time, it just shows that you're
scared," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the countless parades, fairs and barbecues, there were many
reminders of the September tragedies, as well as the nation's
resilience.</TE>
<TE>   In Rancho Cucamonga, a parade featured girders and a firetruck
from the World Trade Center wreckage.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters, the first line of defense in this new war, received
standing ovations on Main Streets across the land. The military, the
first line of offense, gained renewed admiration.</TE>
<TE>   Janine Wiberly, 36, and her fiancee, Louis Zaffino, 38, were
perched on a ledge watching the Huntington Beach parade. When Vietnam
War veterans marched past, the couple said it stirred deep emotions.</TE>
<TE>   "It sent shivers down my spine," said Zaffino, attending his first
Fourth of July parade.</TE>
<TE>   Just down the street, Jack Real, 59, felt something similar as he
stood in a crowd where most were clad in some permutation of Old
Glory.</TE>
<TE>   Real, who resembles a cross between Santa Claus and a hard-core
biker, said he feels more camaraderie these days in the beach town he
has called home for four decades.</TE>
<TE>   When he rides his black bicycle, outfitted with a skull and pirate
flag, children and their mothers give him the thumb's-up in greeting.</TE>
<TE>   The events of Sept. 11, he said, spawned a sense of unity he
hasn't seen in years.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, look at [President] Bush," said Real, who makes no secret
of his Democratic leanings.</TE>
<TE>   "He practically stole the election, and now the whole country is
behind him. I am behind him," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As Real spoke, Godinez's mariachi band, aptly named "Los
Nacionales," or the nationals, and other parade entries streamed down
Pacific Coast Highway.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the band, Bill Cuppy, a local real estate agent and Boy
Scout volunteer, was running about handing out little American flags.</TE>
<TE>   It's an annual tradition for him, but this year he doubled his
patriotic giveaway.</TE>
<TE>   "I got 400 flags," he said, nearly breathless.</TE>
<TE>   "Normally, I give out about 200 or 250. After all that has
happened, we need more flags."</TE>

<HD>Suspect Shot in Drug Raid Seeks $35 Million</HD>
<DH>Claims: Family of paralyzed Santa Paula man challenges
city, county, U.S. government.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The family of a Santa Paula man who was shot and left paralyzed by
drug enforcement agents during an April drug raid has filed claims
against the city, Ventura County and the federal government seeking
$35 million in damages.</LD>
<LD>   The claims were filed last month and are the first step in a
process that will most likely end with the filing of a federal
lawsuit naming the city, county and the Drug Enforcement
Administration, said Stanley Raskin, a Torrance attorney representing
the family of Edward Barron.</LD>
<LD>   Barron, 22, was shot in the head April 17 by a DEA agent during a
confrontation in the frontyard of Barron's home. Authorities had come
to arrest Barron on a range of narcotics charges. Barron, the father
of three young children, has been a quadriplegic since the shooting
and is bedridden at a local hospital, Raskin said.</LD>
<TE>   "They were killers and a killer doesn't always kill his subject,"
Raskin said. "[Barron] is just beginning to talk two months after the
incident. He can slightly move one of his wrists."</TE>
<TE>   The shooting occurred as a four-month operation by the Santa Paula
Police Department and the DEA was wrapping up. Facing gang and drug
problems that had spun out of control last year, Police Chief Bob
Gonzales requested help from the DEA's Mobile Enforcement Team in
January.</TE>
<TE>   For the next four months, a team of gang and drug enforcement
experts slept in local motels or commuted from Los Angeles while
working with Santa Paula's 32-member Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   The operation ended in May after 21 drug-related arrests and the
seizure of several pounds of drugs and nearly a dozen guns.</TE>
<TE>   The operation had gone relatively smoothly until the April 17
confrontation with Barron.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Barron had well-known gang ties and was selling
drugs out of his home at the time of the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Backed up by Santa Paula officers, two federal agents pulled up to
the house about 7:50 p.m. as Barron stood in the yard with several
family members and friends, Gonzales said.</TE>
<TE>   The agents identified themselves immediately, Gonzales said.
Barron pulled a handgun from his waistband and, instead of obeying an
agent's order to drop the weapon, ran to the porch and pointed the
pistol at the agents, the chief said.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Barron pushed the issue and forced the [agents] to do what
they did," Gonzales said. "The DEA was our guest and we take as much
responsibility as our colleagues. I would prefer [Barron] be in the
county jail instead of a hospital bed, but he created that
situation."</TE>
<TE>   Gonzales said he expected a claim against the city and its police
department "because the trend is to sue."</TE>
<TE>   An investigation by the DEA "showed that this agent was acting
within the scope of his employment and dutifully and lawfully reacted
in self-defense," said Jose Martinez, a special agent at the DEA's
Los Angeles office.</TE>
<TE>   Barron's mother, Cecilia, who witnessed the shooting, said that
despite what Gonzales and DEA officials said, the truth of what
happened has yet to come out.</TE>
<TE>   "I am speechless right now," Cecilia Barron said when told of the
findings of the DEA's inquiry. "I have so much I want to say but I
can't, not right now. Our whole life has changed and it's been very
hard. [The DEA] did wrong."</TE>
<TE>   The federal government has six months to investigate any claims
filed against it before a lawsuit can be filed, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Raskin said private investigators have interviewed several
witnesses to the shooting, and a forensic expert will show that the
bullet hit Barron as he was retreating.</TE>
<TE>   Barron had a handgun stuffed in the waistband of his pants at the
time of the shooting, Raskin said, but he never grabbed the gun as he
tried to run. Instead, he said, agents planted the gun on the porch
after realizing they used too much force.</TE>
<TE>   According to the claim, Barron and a friend, Robert Garcia, were
standing on the front lawn of the house when the agents, wearing
masks, approached with guns drawn. Both men ran. Along with the
bullet in the back of his neck, Barron sustained three gunshot wounds
to the cheek, the claim states.</TE>
<TE>   Raskin said the Santa Paula officers "had jurisdictional control
and it was their responsibility to protect citizens. They almost
killed an unarmed man. It's bad training."</TE>
<TE>   Melissa Grisales, assistant to the city manager in Santa Paula,
said the claim is being investigated by an adjuster, who has 30 days
to return findings to the City Council before it votes on whether to
accept or reject the claim.</TE>
<TE>   County officials also have an adjuster investigating the claim,
said Jackie Cohen, manager of claims litigation for the county.</TE>

<KH></KH>
<HD>Hahn's Year-End Review</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Excerpts from a Times interview with Mayor James K. Hahn about his
reflections on his first year in office:</LD>
<LD>   On regrets about his first year:</LD>
<LD>   "The frustration, if I had any, is [that] I would have liked to
have had the 10% budget growth that [former Mayor] Dick Riordan was
experiencing the last few years, and then I could have had a lot of
extra money to spend on parks and playgrounds and more street
paving."</LD>
<TE>   On the toll of the office:</TE>
<TE>   "You're a human being, and the hours get to you after a while. A
lot of breakfast meetings and events that go into the evening make
the day pretty long."</TE>
<TE>   On the public's view of him:</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they know I'm the mayor yet.... It seems to me
there's not a lot of attention focused on me as an individual. That's
probably OK. But I think people are still getting to know that
there's a new mayor in town."</TE>
<TE>   On whether he enjoyed this year:</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah. It's been tough, though. It's been tiring.... The whole
fight by [former Police Chief] Bernard Parks to keep his job and the
reaction of different people was very discouraging to me, because it
was so unnecessary, all of that. But at the end of the day, I found
out that the ordinary folks on the street who I'd bump into say, 'You
know, don't listen to the so-called leaders. We still love you.
You're our mayor, and we're behind you.' You just have to recognize
that people who claim to be spokespeople for vast constituencies are
usually more spokespeople for themselves."</TE>
<TE>   On the press' focus on politics:</TE>
<TE>   "It may surprise you that I don't think about every single issue
that comes across the table every day in terms of its political
issues. But it seems to me that you do. And that's not what
government is. Sure, politics is part of it. But it's not the only
part of it. Secession is about the future of the city; it's not about
Jim Hahn's political future. And trying to get folks to focus on that
has been frustrating."</TE>
<TE>   On being mayor:</TE>
<TE>   "It's very humbling, and I'm very appreciative of this opportunity
to be the mayor. It's not something that my whole personal ambition
is tied up in, being elected and running things....</TE>
<TE>   "It always surprises people, that I'm just being a normal
person--shopping at the grocery store, and going to Home Depot in a
dirty T-shirt on a Saturday morning. They don't expect it. And I
don't want to lose that. And I think that's the frustrating thing. I
want to spend as much time as I can with my kids and be a good
parent. And I think some people that I've run into who are elected
officials just--they're too far gone into the whole political
ambition part of it. They're not regular anymore; they're not
normal."</TE>
<TE>   On being criticized for not having a higher public profile:</TE>
<TE>   "[San Francisco Mayor] Willie Brown is a good friend of mine, and
he's certainly a larger-than-life figure in San Francisco. But there
are a lot of people in San Francisco not that thrilled with him.... I
don't know that being Willie Brown as a larger-than-life figure has
made that much of a difference one way or another in the way that
city has been governed."</TE>

<HD>Fire Danger Sparks Vigilance</HD>
<DH>Safety: Living in forest full of fuel has residents of
rural O.C. on edge. They patrol back roads for signs of trouble.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE ANTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Mike Boeck looks at the steep slopes surrounding his Silverado
Canyon home, he sees trouble: a forest full of fuel, trees and
chaparral as dry as if they had been baked in a kiln.</LD>
<LD>   All it would take is one thoughtlessly discarded cigarette, one
goofball with some fireworks, one illegal campfire or one downed
power line.</LD>
<LD>   With a long holiday weekend and Orange County's mountains as
parched as they've been in more than 40 years, Boeck and his
neighbors are fighting fire before it begins by patrolling the
moonlit back roads of their rural community throughout the night.</LD>
<TE>   "We're going to be looking for people who are suspicious, people
with fireworks, people trespassing," said Boeck, who has removed nine
pickup truck loads of brush from around his mountainside stucco home.
"We are very vulnerable right now, so we're going to try to be the
eyes and ears of the sheriff."</TE>
<TE>   Those volunteer efforts are typical of late fall, when the Santa
Ana winds blow. But this isn't a typical year, and across Orange
County, residents and officials are geared up far earlier than usual
for a fire season many predict will be one of the worst.</TE>
<TE>   Seasonal firefighters, helicopters and air tankers were brought in
by the U.S. Forest Service weeks early. Training fires that usually
take place at Camp Pendleton in May were canceled--it was too risky.
On Monday, fires in Cleveland National Forest campgrounds were
banned, and the closure of some roads is being considered.</TE>
<TE>   An effort to clear plants within 100 feet of buildings in canyon
communities has so far produced 200 to 300 tons of material--50% more
than last year.</TE>
<TE>   Already this year, more than 5,000 acres of Orange County wild
lands have gone up in flames, compared with a total of 594 acres in
the three previous years.</TE>
<TE>   "The intensity of the fires we've had so far, and the fast rate of
travel despite no significant winds--it's making us extremely
concerned," Orange County Fire Authority Capt. Stephen Miller said.
"We are at a critically dangerous level for this early in the
season."</TE>
<TE>   The script has been months in the making. As of June 30, Orange
County had 3.2 inches of rain--one-fourth of what is normal and the
lowest amount since 1960-61.</TE>
<TE>   "I was up on Ortega Highway and you can feel [the moisture] coming
out of your skin," said Jon Anderson, the county's vegetation hazard
reduction supervisor. "It's dry as a bone."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the lack of rain has meant Anderson's crews have had
less work than in previous years.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the properties that we normally cut, we didn't cut--it
was so sparse," he said.</TE>
<TE>   What is there doesn't take much to ignite. When a county bulldozer
that was clearing weeds in Laguna Canyon last week hit a rock, the
spark set off a blaze that charred 80 acres.</TE>
<TE>   Every 15 days, fire authorities test the moisture content of
plants in the county's fire-prone canyons by baking them in an oven.
When George Ewan got the latest lab report, the numbers confirmed his
worst fears. The chamise, sumac and sage scrub were as dry as they
usually are in October. Some was nearly dormant.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been in California for 10 years, and I haven't seen the
moisture content in plants this low this early," said Ewan, wild land
fire defense planner for the Fire Authority. "It gives you that
sinking feeling."</TE>
<TE>   The 1993 Laguna Canyon fire that burned 450 homes and caused more
than $500 million in damage taught many lessons.</TE>
<TE>   One lesson that officials hope will pay dividends this year is a
1996 county building code change requiring "fuel modification zones"
around the perimeter of new developments.</TE>
<TE>   "The county is growing fast and it's encroaching on areas that
have burned in the past and will again in the future," Ewan said.
"It's not a matter of if it's going to burn, but when."</TE>
<TE>   Under the code changes, the sides of homes facing wild land areas
must be built with noncombustible materials, from the walls to the
window frames and eaves. Nothing combustible can be placed within 30
feet; the next 140 feet is made up of an irrigated greenbelt and a
zone with approved plants that maintain high moisture levels even in
drought years.</TE>
<TE>   A blaze in May that burned more than 1,000 acres and threatened
hundreds of homes around Rancho Santa Margarita was contained, in
part, when the zones provided fire breaks, Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   "The fire burned to the fuel modification zone, and it did exactly
what it was supposed to do," he said. "People living in these areas
have to take responsibility on their end to provide a good defense so
we can provide the best offense."</TE>
<TE>   That's why Boeck and his canyon neighbors will take turns
patrolling this weekend, armed with nothing more than a sharp eye and
two-way radios.</TE>
<TE>   Several recent small arson fires in secluded Black Star Canyon
--long a hangout for teens--have set area residents on edge, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not trying to confront anyone, but we are getting more
aggressive because of the recent arson fires," said Boeck, who lives
across the road from the volunteer fire department--a fact that, in
this dry season, offers little comfort.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hoping that just by our presence alone, we will deter
people from hanging around the area."</TE>

<HD>Upscale Suburb Warned Its Beauty Is Only Skin Deep</HD>
<DH>Glendora: Despite a median household income above $60,000,
the city lacks money for repairs to its decaying infrastructure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARIOT LOUIMA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a fairly well-to-do suburb with multimillion-dollar mansions in
the foothills and a bustling commercial center, but Glendora's
infrastructure is crumbling, and the city cannot afford repairs.</LD>
<LD>   An independent auditor identified nearly $100 million in repairs
needed to the city-owned water system and another $22 million for
city streets.</LD>
<LD>   The problem, said analysts with Citigate Associates, is that
Glendora has only $15.6 million in reserve and $4 million in a water
fund.</LD>
<TE>   The report, commissioned by the city, did not mention the sewer
system, but city officials said they suspect those lines also need
major repairs. But they said they have no idea what the work would
cost, or where they would find the money.</TE>
<TE>   Citigate's report was an eye-opener to the city of 49,415 in the
foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, 27 miles east of Los Angeles.
Commercial and residential development haven't slowed during the
economic slump, and the city--with a median household income in the
$60,000s--has virtually escaped the increase in violent crime that
has happened elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   But experts say Glendora's current financial difficulties are far
from unique among the state's more than 500 cities. Public spending
on infrastructure in California has declined more than 75% since the
1960s.</TE>
<TE>   And since 1978's Proposition 13, which capped property taxes,
municipalities all over the state have had a tough time raising money
for infrastructure maintenance, said Jeffrey Lambert, president of
the California Chapter of the American Planning Assn.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, Lambert said, cities make piecemeal repairs. If
a specific line is leaking, for example, they handle that leak.</TE>
<TE>   "There are several reports out there that suggest the
infrastructure needs--not just state roads and dams, but in local
cities--there is an overwhelming need for major upgrades," said Steve
Preston, chairman of the California Planners Roundtable.</TE>
<TE>   Most cities rely on some state funding for maintenance of arterial
roads, Preston said. Cities often allocate revenue from local taxes--
many times a gas tax--to pay for street repairs. Affluent cities such
as Glendora sometimes have difficulty finding resources because they
often don't qualify for the resources that are out there, Preston
said.</TE>
<TE>   When the report, which cost $104,000, was made public in April,
many Glendorans scratched their heads in confusion. The report gives
100 areas that local officials should address in the coming years,
including adoption of professional standards for several key city
jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "The sewer pipes are collapsing, the water pipes are collapsing,
the business corridor is virtually a slum, and nothing's being done,"
said Richard Jacob, a past city councilman who was recalled in a
recent special election, along with two others. In exasperation, he
added, "This isn't Watts, this is Glendora."</TE>
<TE>   Douglas Tessitor, who sits on the board of directors of the
Glendora Republican Club, said most elected officials have long been
aware of the infrastructure problems, especially those of the water
system, but have been unwilling to act for political reasons.</TE>
<TE>   "The stuff that is out of sight and out of mind that costs money
to fix is very easy to defer when there are other, higher profile,
sexier demands for money," Tessitor said.</TE>
<TE>   Idella  Cloutman, an 84-year-old grandmother who moved to Glendora
in 1933, said, "We're in pretty bad shape. [The city government]
didn't do anything for 30 years."</TE>
<TE>   Some officials said they hadn't been aware of Glendora's
precarious financial state.</TE>
<TE>   "I was surprised that the financial health of the community is not
what I expected," said City Manager Eric Zeigler, who was appointed
in May after serving nine months as interim manager.</TE>
<TE>   "When you neglect the physical infrastructure, you, one day, reach
a crisis point," he added. "I don't think we've reached a crisis, but
I don't think we're at a very healthy place."</TE>
<TE>   In response to the report, the City Council last month voted 4-1
to impose a development moratorium along Route 66, the city's main
business corridor. Officials said they hope to lift the moratorium,
once they have developed a downtown master plan.</TE>
<TE>   The findings of the Citigate report didn't come as a complete
surprise to some officials. In 1995, a report by AKM Consulting
Engineers outlined most of the problems with the city's water system,
estimating that improvements and repairs would cost $100 million.</TE>
<TE>   Two years after publication of that report--which became the
city's Water Master Plan--AKM Consulting suggested a 10-year capital
improvement program to address the most pressing problems, which
included the replacement of key wells and several water mains,
totaling $15 million.</TE>
<TE>   Although the city has collected $1.3 million annually since 1999
into a capital improvement fund, less than 20% of those initial
improvements have been completed.</TE>
<TE>   Public works director Richard Cantwell said just one of six water
mains has been replaced, at a cost of $1 million, and not a single
city well has been replaced.  "It will take over 70 years at this
rate to complete the projects outlined in the Water Master Plan," the
report found.</TE>
<TE>   Other areas of the city's infrastructure, such as the sewers,
still have not been studied.</TE>
<TE>   Glendora owns the sewer lines, but day-to-day maintenance is
handled by the Consolidated Sewer Maintenance District of Los Angeles
County.</TE>
<TE>   Glendora officials assumed for years that they weren't responsible
for major repairs to the system. That assumption ended in November
when the showroom of Glendora Interiors was flooded with raw sewage.</TE>
<TE>   The owner, Annette Nemeth, said the flood caused $86,000 in
damages to her office and showroom. The county's sewer maintenance
district has agreed to pay for half of the damages, she said. City
officials said they are not responsible. She is considering legal
action.</TE>
<TE>   Zeigler said the sewer backup was a wake-up call to him and other
officials. Zeigler said he had started asking questions about sewer
maintenance and learned "if there is a need for repairs to large
portions of the system, the responsibility falls on the city."</TE>
<TE>   The only problem, he said, is that "there is no identified source
of funds to make repairs to the system."</TE>

<HD>Alumnus Takes a Swing at College's Driving Range Plans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIN CHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A pile of boulders resembling a haphazard Maya pyramid at Los Angeles
City College has pitted an alumnus against a Los Angeles developer
and the leadership of the city's community college district.</LD>
<LD>   Now that construction has actually begun on a for-profit golf
driving range on the public college's property, LACC alumnus Duke
Russell is campaigning to stop it. Los Angeles developer Hee Cho,
president of CK Realty &amp; Management, has started pushing rocks around
3.8 acres at Melrose and New Hampshire avenues to create a driving
range near Koreatown.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, Russell has stepped up his efforts to reverse the deal
made in July 1999, well before school officials knew they would
receive $147 million for campus development from last year's
Proposition A referendum.</LD>
<TE>   If the board could have foreseen passage of the $1.25-billion bond
issue, which was divided among the city's nine community colleges,
LACC probably would have set aside the land and factored it into its
campus improvement plan, said Los Angeles Community College District
Chancellor Mark Drummond. Now, it's too late, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It wouldn't be very honorable to say, 'Now I change my mind.' "</TE>
<TE>   That's exactly what Russell wants Drummond and the board to do. He
has called on politicians, alumni, faculty members and residents to
urge the community college district board to cancel the contract, buy
out the developer and use the property for classrooms or sports
fields.</TE>
<TE>   The campus, with 48 acres, doesn't "have a lot of land, and four
acres is gigantic," Russell said. "That is not the way to use public
land.... It's not only absurd, it's just wrong, dead wrong."</TE>
<TE>   But the district board said it can do little to renege on the
contract, Drummond said.</TE>
<TE>   Russell's request to buy out Cho is "well beyond" the district
board's financial resources, LACC President Mary Spangler said. "The
district isn't about to commit to these kind of funds. Even if they
did, we wouldn't have the money to develop the property."</TE>
<TE>   Drummond estimated it would cost more than $10 million to buy out
Cho. The school can't use any of the bond issue, Drummond and
Spangler said, because the college already owns the land.</TE>
<TE>   Under the contract, Cho will pay LACC $120,000 a year to lease the
property, where he plans to spend $5 million building a driving
range, putting green, pro shop, pan-Asian restaurant, police
substation and 89 parking spaces, all slated for a January 2003
opening.</TE>
<TE>   Calling his project a "win-win situation" for himself and the
school, Cho said that if the school wanted the land back, he "should
consider it, but right now, there is no reason" for the school to
offer a buyout.</TE>
<TE>   The contract allows LACC to reassess and retake the property at
market value in 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   There is a driving range about five miles north at Griffith Park,
but Cho said his 69 tee stalls would be more accessible to golfers
from Koreatown. And unlike Koreatown's three other driving ranges,
Cho's would be a full-size, 200-yard facility.</TE>
<TE>   Some business owners welcome the range and speculate that property
values may rise.</TE>
<TE>   "God love him," said artist Toby Huss, 37, who owns National Mule,
a studio and store near the site. "Somebody had to do something with
it and develop it."</TE>
<TE>   But City Councilman Tom LaBonge, also an LACC alumnus, called the
agreement "very shortsighted by the college district. They missed
their mark on this."</TE>
<TE>   Chancellor Drummond said he "wasn't very excited" at the time of
the deal, but "looking at the blighted condition of that place, I
didn't see any alternatives."</TE>

<LD>One year into his job, Mayor James K. Hahn doesn't think most Los
Angeles residents know who he is--but that doesn't bother him. The
mayor said he'd rather people focus on the state of Los Angeles than
on him, preferring to be thought of like any other citizen.</LD>
<LD>   "Who cares about me?" Hahn said in a wide-ranging interview with
The Times last week to discuss his first year in office. "I'm not
important," he added, banging his fist repeatedly against the arm of
his chair. "The city is important. People who live in the city are
important. Their future is important."</LD>
<LD>   Hahn said he is not interested in seizing the limelight as he runs
the city government and leads the campaign against secession. His
indifference to his public image speaks to how he has spent his first
12 months as mayor--a year in which he operated largely behind the
scenes.</LD>
<TE>   In that time, the mayor was able to complete much of what he
promised to do when he was inaugurated last July 1: He expanded the
LA's BEST after-school program, created a $100-million housing trust
fund and built up a citywide network of neighborhood councils. To
improve public safety--his main platform in last spring's mayoral
campaign--Hahn launched several initiatives to boost the recruitment
and retention of police officers.</TE>
<TE>   But Hahn's reluctance to engage with his job in a more visible way
worries many city leaders, who fret that Hahn's reserved persona is a
liability, especially as he leads the effort to prevent the breakup
of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Frustrated by his unwillingness to embrace the rhetorical power of
his office, many local officials and political observers say Hahn
needs to seek out a more dynamic public image.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a seat warmer," said Shelly Mandell, president of the Los
Angeles chapter of the National Organization for Women, who backed
former Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa in last year's election.
"He lacks the imagination and the creativity and the drive, and he
just doesn't excite people."</TE>
<TE>   Although some praise him for doing an admirable job as the city's
top administrator--balancing the budget in a tight year and taking
steps to tighten security after Sept. 11--even those close to Hahn
lament that he has done little to grab the attention of the city.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't tell you the array of folks who have known Jim for 15 or
20 years and are startled by the absence of any leadership ability,"
said one longtime associate who did not wish to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn bristled at these criticisms, blaming the media for ignoring
what he has done, even as he rejected the notion that he must seek a
higher public profile.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess maybe what they're saying is I'm not a great orator or an
inspirational speaker," he said. "Those people always annoyed me, so
I try not to be like them, because to me it's so much of an act."</TE>
<TE>   Avoiding the Limelight</TE>
<TE>   The mayor dismissed officials who crave the limelight as
inauthentic, saying they are often warped by their political
ambition. "I think people want reality at the end of the day; they
don't want a performance," he said. "And I think what they see with
me is someone who's real, who's working hard, an ordinary person like
them who just happens to be the mayor."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's supporters argue that the bulk of the mayor's work has been
on issues such as police reform and governmental efficiency that do
not lend themselves to fast and splashy results.</TE>
<TE>   "Jim is someone who has always taken the long view," said John
Emerson, a former Clinton White House official who served as top aide
to Hahn when he was city attorney. "He's more a marathon runner than
a sprinter."</TE>
<TE>   After serving as city controller and city attorney for two
decades, Hahn came to the job of mayor fluent in the workings of
municipal government. He used that familiarity with City Hall to
tackle what he saw as backlogs in the bureaucracy, centering his
efforts on improving the delivery of city services, from pothole
filling to alleviating gridlock.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn streamlined the city's mechanism for using federal grant
money, freeing up millions of dollars that Los Angeles was at risk of
losing. He stripped down the application to form a neighborhood
council from 22 pages to five, speeding up the process for certifying
the new organizations, which were established three years ago to give
residents more of a voice in local government.</TE>
<TE>   To help stop the exodus of officers from the police force, Hahn
implemented three- and four-day work weeks, fulfilling a campaign
pledge to the police union. And he shortened the amount of time
applicants to the Police Department had to wait to be hired, slashing
the process from one year to several months.</TE>
<TE>   And Hahn has announced his commitment to placing $100 million in a
housing trust fund to pay for affordable housing in Los Angeles, a
widely applauded move that he promised during the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Working With Council</TE>
<TE>   In these tasks Hahn demonstrated a knowledge of the inner workings
of City Hall and a willingness to collaborate with the City Council
that his predecessor, former Mayor Richard Riordan, never shared,
political observers said.</TE>
<TE>   "He is far more attuned and effective as a leader of government
than Riordan ever was," said Raphael Sonenshein, a political science
professor at Cal State Fullerton. "Hahn is able to get the government
to move."</TE>
<TE>   But Hahn's style frustrates other officials and community leaders
who have urged him to adopt a bigger public role--a role that does
not come naturally to him.</TE>
<TE>   Fiercely protective of his privacy, Hahn rarely talks about his
family, even refusing to tell reporters what island in Hawaii he
vacationed on last summer. For most of the year, the mayor tried to
keep his schedule open during the evenings and on weekends so he
could go home to San Pedro.</TE>
<TE>   "It always surprises people, that I'm just being a normal person,
shopping at the grocery store, and going to Home Depot in a dirty
T-shirt on a Saturday morning," he said. "They don't expect it. And I
don't want to lose that."</TE>
<TE>   On more days than not, the mayor has no public events. When he
does, he often stands behind a lectern and carefully follows his
talking points.</TE>
<TE>   While his father, the late county Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, was
legendary for his political showmanship, Hahn has done little to seek
the spotlight. He refused to go out on the ice during the opening of
a downtown ice rink, for example, and declined to don a sombrero to
celebrate a new flight from Mexico to the Ontario airport.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not a grandstander," said political strategist Joe Cerrell,
a longtime friend of the Hahn family. "I get very frustrated
sometimes because at events he would rather stand around and [talk]
with me. I say, 'Why don't you go work the crowd?' But it's more
comfortable for him. Some people probably think he's a little cold
and aloof when he's really shy."</TE>
<TE>   More important than his ability to make small talk, critics say,
is Hahn's reluctance or inability to use the power of his office to
shape public opinion.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time that an enterprise is in trouble, you look to the
captain, you look to the chief, not only to calm people's fears and
reassure them, but to be active," said Fernando Oaxaca, a retired Los
Angeles businessman active in state GOP politics. "And I don't see
this guy out there."</TE>
<TE>   Urged to Communicate</TE>
<TE>   As Hahn takes on the twin secession movements in the San Fernando
Valley and Hollywood, political scholars say he needs to expand his
communication to the city's residents.</TE>
<TE>   "His strategy is to be consistent and steady over the long haul,
and thereby be a mayor that people have confidence in," Sonenshein
said. "But even in that, you have to communicate what you're doing."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said that although he is happy to publicize
the accomplishments of his administration, he has little interest in
being the focus of public attention.</TE>
<TE>   "That whole idea of the performance, of that larger-than-life
figure, I don't think you have to do that to be an effective mayor,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's top advisors say the very things Hahn is criticized
for by pundits are the qualities that the voters like.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a straight-shooting, steady urban mechanic," said political
consultant Bill Carrick, who is running Hahn's campaign to defeat
secession. "The people who want a poet laureate for mayor ... I think
he's going to win them over time."</TE>
<TE>   In the next few months, the public debate about secession will
give Hahn an opportunity to shape how the public views him, political
experts said.</TE>
<TE>   But the mayor said he is not interested in using the campaign to
build his public persona.</TE>
<TE>   Secession "is a huge event in the history of the city," he said.
"I'm just a blip on the chronological scale in terms of the number of
mayors here. It's not about me, it's not about my political future at
all.... I'm not important."</TE>

admire.</CP>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn has begun to regain the support among
African Americans that he lost after he opposed a second term for
former Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, but overall approval of his job
performance remains middling, a Los Angeles Times poll shows.</LD>
<LD>   Fewer than half--46%--of the city residents surveyed said that the
mayor is doing a good job; 26% disapprove of his performance and 28%
say they don't know whether he's doing well.</LD>
<LD>   The figures are similar to the ratings for former Mayor Richard
Riordan during much of Riordan's first term. In Hahn's case, however,
they come as he faces a major challenge--a battle to keep the city
from breaking apart--in which a more solid level of political support
would help, political analysts said.</LD>
<TE>   Many black community leaders were angered by the mayor's decision
to dump Parks, particularly because African Americans had
overwhelmingly voted for Hahn in the June 2001 election.</TE>
<TE>   But now support appears to be building, at least somewhat. After
the Parks decision, Hahn lost support in that community: Just 30% of
blacks surveyed by a Times poll in March said they approved of Hahn's
handling of the city.</TE>
<TE>   In the most recent poll, 39% of African Americans said they
approved of the mayor's performance. Still, 42% said they
disapproved.</TE>
<TE>   The poll, supervised by Times Poll director Susan Pinkus, was
conducted June 20 and June 29. It surveyed 1,790 people citywide, and
has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, who made one of his first forays back into the African
American community last week, said in an interview that he believes
he will enjoy stronger support in that community again. What people
thought about his decision on Parks will not affect their vote on
secession efforts in the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood, Hahn
predicted.</TE>
<TE>   They are "one of the most politically sophisticated communities in
the city," Hahn said. "They're used to people promising things and
not delivering. They really know how to tell the difference and
discern what's really going on.... I don't think they will buy the
[secession] arguments."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn also said he does not view his approval rating as negative.
Rather, he said, he sees it as "2 to 1 positive to negative."</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever you're making decisions, you're bound to make people
unhappy," he said. "I make choices every day."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan's support spiked six months after the Northridge
earthquake in 1994, to 59%. Analysts attributed that upsurge to the
quick repair of the Santa Monica Freeway and other recovery efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Times Poll also showed that secession would lose if
it were voted on now, political analysts say the mayor's tepid
approval ratings might not make him the best spokesman against a
breakup of the city. Rather, they say, he needs to assemble a team of
neighborhood, community and business leaders, as well as celebrities
and other politicians, to send messages against breakaway efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the mayor's consultants need to realize that they're
consultants against secession and not the mayor's consultants against
secession," said Harvey Englander, a political consultant who is not
involved in any of the secession campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to rest on his ability to rally other people and
his ability to create a rationale for people to vote against
secession based on their self-interest," Englander added.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor, and his consultants, already are building a broad
coalition of people to speak out against secession, and they say
voters will not hear from him alone on the issue. "I think in some
ways Jim serves as an organizer of all this to help people get
together and empower them to speak out," said Bill Carrick, a
political consultant who is managing the mayor's anti-secession
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "That doesn't mean he's not a good messenger to make strong
arguments about keeping the city together. He certainly has a
platform and a place to do that," Carrick said.</TE>
<TE>   Some Los Angeles residents who say they approve of the mayor's
handling of the city also say they support secession. And regardless
of their stand on the issue, more than 80% of poll respondents said
Hahn's opposition to the breakaway efforts will not affect their
votes.</TE>
<TE>   Elen Orson is a Hollywood Hills resident who supports Hahn and
secession. In fact, she suggested, he would be the perfect mayor to
oversee the transition.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad we have James Hahn at this time, because he seems to be
a pretty flexible guy, and the transition to a smaller Los Angeles is
going to take a lot of work," said Orson, who agreed to discuss the
mayor in a follow-up interview. "I think it's a good time to do this
[approve secession], when James Hahn is mayor."</TE>
<TE>   Tien Nguyen, a Northridge resident, said he believes the mayor is
heading in the right direction on most issues except secession.</TE>
<TE>   "Smaller government is better government to me," Nguyen said. "I
wish he would agree with it ... but if secession happens, he'll lose
some of his authority."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's support appears to be weaker in the Valley than it was
during the election. The mayor won 55% of the Valley's votes last
year, but in the poll only 44% of respondents said they approved of
his handling of the city.</TE>
<TE>   On the Westside, Hahn's support appears to have risen. He won 48%
of the vote in the area according to a Times exit poll of voters, but
now he receives the approval of 54% of those surveyed.</TE>
<TE>   Among Latinos, who were the strongest backers of Hahn's opponent,
Antonio Villaraigosa, the mayor now has a 46% approval rating. He won
only 18% of Latino votes in the election, according to the exit poll.</TE>
<TE>   Several of those who agreed to follow-up interviews mentioned the
mayor's father, Kenneth Hahn, a former county supervisor beloved in
the black community that he represented for decades. These people
said the mayor is not living up to his father's reputation.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the only reason he got in was because of his father,"
said Delbert Prillerman, a retired mortgage broker who lives in
Koreatown. "I just don't think he's a stand-up guy."</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Lupe Saldivar, a retired secretary from East Los
Angeles, said: "He ran on his father's reputation.... I don't think
he's done much for the city.... If he were to run again, I wouldn't
vote for him."</TE>
<TE>   And, Blanca Ebner, a Tujunga resident who, until recently, drove a
lunch truck, said she believes Hahn is "trying too hard. You can see
it; he's desperate."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   How the Poll Was Conducted</TE>
<TE>   The Times Poll contacted 1,790 people citywide by telephone June
20-28. Phone numbers were chosen from a list of all exchanges in Los
Angeles. Random-digit dialing techniques were used so that listed and
unlisted numbers could be contacted. The entire sample was weighted
slightly to conform with census figures for sex, race, age,
education, registration and area of the city. The margin of sampling
error for the entire city and for registered voters is plus or minus
3 percentage points. For certain subgroups the error margin may be
somewhat higher. Poll results also can be affected by factors such as
question wording and the order in which questions are presented.
Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish.</TE>

<LD>The body of a 7-year-old girl who was among five family members
drowned Tuesday during an outing at Lake Isabella in Kern County has
been recovered, a sheriff's spokeswoman said Thursday</LD>
<LD>   Later Thursday, the girl's 5-year-old brother, who had been on
life support, died at Valley Children's Hospital in Madera, where he
had been taken after being pulled from the lake Tuesday afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   Searchers pulled the body of Lindsey Skaggs from water near a
sandbar 100 feet out in the lake Wednesday evening. The family had
been playing on the sandbar Tuesday afternoon before the tragedy
occurred.</LD>
<TE>   Hospital personnel would not release the 5-year-old's name.
Meanwhile, the Kern County coroner's office identified the other
drowning victims as the parents, Martin and Charlotte Skaggs, both
45, and two other daughters, Melanie, 10, and April, 8.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the family had been living out of a car in the
area.</TE>
<TE>   The spokeswoman, in Kern County sheriff's headquarters in
Bakersfield, said investigators continued to believe the drownings
were accidental.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, Sheriff's Cmdr. Marty Williamson said wind might have
pushed one of the girls off the sandbar into deeper water in the lake
at the south end of the Sierra Nevada. Other family members
apparently drowned as they tried to rescue her, Williamson said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Is this the way it's going to be from here on out?</LD>
<LD>   Is every incident at an airport going to make us tremble?</LD>
<LD>   Every time we celebrate a national holiday, are we going to fear
the worst?</LD>
<TE>   The shooting at LAX came first, about 11:30 Thursday morning. Two
were dead and one more was dying. Minutes later, a twin-engine Cessna
crashed into a crowd at a park in San Dimas, killing four and
injuring at least 12.</TE>
<TE>   You didn't have to be paranoid to think that both could be the
work of terrorists sending a message to America on the day we
celebrate freedom. And you didn't have to be a conspiracy theorist to
wonder if it was just the beginning. I was glued to the TV, watching
victims carried to ambulances, waiting to find out what we were
looking at.</TE>
<TE>   At last report, we were told that neither situation appeared to
involve terrorism. But for a couple of hours, we were all terrorized
in a manner of speaking, because the one thing we know about life in
the postmodern world is that we don't know anything.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really hard to go out and celebrate the whole notion of
freedom and independence when we're living in an atmosphere of 'What
next?'," said Nancy Snow, a political analyst who's teaching a summer
course on media and social change at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing I heard on the news was that the Bradley
International Terminal was in lockdown, and I thought that was an
emblematic slogan for our times. We've got a semblance of freedom,
but we're also in lockdown."</TE>
<TE>   As the events unfolded, I felt perfectly helpless and a little
ticked off. We virtually declared victory after the Taliban were
routed and Afghans marched back into Kabul, and we proudly strung up
those "United We Stand" banners.</TE>
<TE>   But two months short of the first anniversary of Sept. 11, nothing
has changed.</TE>
<TE>   We have no idea where Osama bin Laden is. We haven't gotten any
closer to dismantling Al Qaeda. We've sacrificed some of the civil
liberties we claim to cherish. And we've still got the jitters. On
the Fourth of July, when we ought to be throwing hot dogs on the
grill and tossing Frisbees, we can't take our eyes off the gurneys on
TV.</TE>
<TE>   So what have we accomplished?</TE>
<TE>   More than a little, to be honest. We've put the Neanderthal
Taliban down, and we're trying almost single-handedly to nurse
Afghanistan back to health, which is a treacherous walk down a long
road. And 3,000-plus American martyrs have helped expose militant
Islam as nothing more than a despicable, bloody hypocrisy.</TE>
<TE>   But we completely forgot a vow we made to ourselves after Sept.
11. We were going to rethink the meaning of our lives, remember?</TE>
<TE>   We were going to live less materialistically and more
thoughtfully.</TE>
<TE>   We were going to give some consideration to the fact that much of
the world sees us as the fat kid at the birthday party, stuffing cake
into his mouth while everyone else dives for crumbs.</TE>
<TE>   "The rest of the world doesn't see us as we see ourselves--as good
people with good intentions," says Snow, a former official with the
State Department and the U.S. Information Agency.</TE>
<TE>   They see us as the guys who cut deals with petro-villains in the
interest of our own comfort and prosperity. They see us peddling arms
to despots of dirt-poor countries that could better use schools and
capital. And now we're threatening to blow Iraq to smithereens
because battleships and bombers are the only defense we know.</TE>
<TE>   We barely whisper about any of this, much less care, but we're all
screaming when someone wants to snip "under God" from the Pledge of
Allegiance.</TE>
<TE>   It's this combination of cluelessness and self-righteousness that
has the world's mongrels--those who profit from the imposed ignorance
of their own people--gunning for us.</TE>
<TE>   "I love this country, but there's a lack of critical thinking,"
says Snow. "We have all this talk of freedom, but the discussion in
Washington is about guns and missiles that will only promote the
cycle of violence. If you got a group of children together and put
the problems out there for them to look at, they could do a better
job."</TE>
<TE>   We don't have a greater freedom than our right to hold Washington,
and ourselves, to a higher accountability. And we don't have a more
appropriate time to remind ourselves of this than Independence Day
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Wake up, folks. This very conversation is our strength, and the
best salve for frayed nerves.</TE>

<LD>How the Poll Was Conducted</LD>
<LD>   The Times Poll contacted 1,790 people citywide by telephone June
20-28. Phone numbers were chosen from a list of all exchanges in Los
Angeles. Random-digit dialing techniques were used so that listed and
unlisted numbers could be contacted. The entire sample was weighted
slightly to conform with census figures for sex, race, age,
education, registration and area of the city. The margin of sampling
error for the entire city and for registered voters is plus or minus
3 percentage points. For certain subgroups the error margin may be
somewhat higher. Poll results also can be affected by factors such as
question wording and the order in which questions are presented.
Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish.</LD>

<HD>Mexico's 2006 Race Comes to Santa Ana</HD>
<DH>Immigrants: A Zacatecas club convention draws a
presidential hopeful to meet potential voters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Ricardo Monreal, governor of the Mexican state of Zacatecas,
comes to Santa Ana today for the third annual convention of Zacatecan
clubs from around the United States, he'll be stumping for his
nation's presidency some four years ahead of schedule.</LD>
<LD>   The clubs were started by immigrants to raise cash and other aid
for their villages in the impoverished agricultural state. They have
grown fivefold in number since a Monreal political operative began an
organizing drive across the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Monreal's early campaigning for the 2006 presidential race might
seem unorthodox, but it only reflects political reality: Half of
Zacatecans now live in the United States, and they soon may be able
to vote in Mexican elections.</LD>
<TE>   "Monreal has a big stage here and he's using it to better the
state," said Manuel de la Cruz of Norwalk, who has helped Monreal
garner support in the United States and is on the state payroll to
establish more clubs among Zacatecan immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Some club founders worry about the shift in emphasis to politics.</TE>
<TE>   "The government is involved in what are supposed to be nonprofit
organizations," said Felipe Cabral, a real estate agent who lives in
Cypress and is one of six U.S. representatives to Mexico's
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. An activist in his local
Zacatecas club, he has charged in his columns that many of the new
clubs cropping up are nothing more than names with few people in
each.</TE>
<TE>   De la Cruz, however, says the convention will prove that "these
clubs are not ghost organizations. They are backed by people. They
are funding projects."</TE>
<TE>   There's ample reason for Monreal's focus north of the border as he
seeks the nomination of his left-center Party of the Democratic
Revolution (PRD) for president in 2006. Mexico's congress is expected
to determine before then how Mexicans abroad can participate in the
election.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those potential voters are from Zacatecas, which sends a
higher percentage of its population, 50%, to the United States than
any other Mexican state. Los Angeles has more Zacatecans than any
other metropolitan area in the world. Chicago and the state's capital
of Zacatecas come in second and third respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Aid from Zacatecans in the United States is vital to the survival
of those left at home. Banks report an estimated $1.3 million a day
is wired from the United States to relatives in Zacatecas. Without
those funds and other donations from clubs, the state's economy would
collapse, De la Cruz said.</TE>
<TE>   Monreal also may very well need the political support of
Zacatecans in the United States. A measure that would allow Mexicans
abroad to vote died in the Mexican senate in 1998, but
representatives of several political parties say they still favor
legislation giving voting rights to the estimated 10 million to 20
million Mexicans living in the United States. They remain at odds
only over how to make a voting system that would be fair and fraud
proof.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a direct influence with their families; they send money
and they tell family members whom to vote for," Monreal said. "We are
talking about millions of people who could vote in 2006. For me, they
are fundamental for a victory."</TE>
<TE>   Other frequently mentioned possible contenders in the 2006
presidential race are Roberto Madrazo, PRI president; PRD President
Rosario Robles; and Manuel Lopez Obrador, Mexico City's mayor and a
member of the PRD.</TE>
<TE>   Since being elected governor three years ago, Monreal has worked
to established 16 federations of 274 Zacatecan clubs in 12 American
states with De la Cruz's help. The clubs conduct fund-raisers to send
money to Mexico, which then is matched by local, state and federal
governments for public works projects.</TE>
<TE>   The Monreal strategy mirrored the efforts of the federal
government, which began using U.S. clubs to spread its influence in
the 1990s. At the time, it was hoped that the clubs would build
support for the Institutional Revolutionary Party, said Eva Garcia
Valle, a sociology professor specializing in immigration at the
Autonomous University of Zacatecas.</TE>
<TE>   The professor and others recognize that the U.S. Zacatecan clubs
have changed the face of many small towns. They have raised $6
million in the last three years, which was matched by $12 million in
government money. The funds paid for hospitals, schools, wells and
paved roads.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the money comes from the Southern California Federation,
which includes 55 clubs linked to an equal number of towns in
Zacatecas. The federation sent $2.5 million last year that was
matched by $7.5 million in government funds.</TE>
<TE>   Las Animas, a farming village of 2,500 people, was one benefactor.
The residents had long sought to have potable water and drainage. A
California club sent $300,000 for the $1.2-million project.</TE>
<TE>   "We were the ones that provided the seed money and the social and
political pressure to get the job done," said Los Angeles resident
Martha Jimenez, who heads Club Fraternidad Las Animas. After studying
urban planning at UCLA, she sought $100 donations from many of the
800 California residents from Las Animas. She also conducted
fund-raising dances to collect the rest within three months.</TE>
<TE>   Donations for all projects have soared after the government
increased its match to the clubs' efforts in 1999, Southern
California Federation President Guadalupe Gomez said. Last year's
donation of $1.8 million was more than all the donations from 1992
and 1998 raised by the Southern California group.</TE>
<TE>   Other clubs around the country have duplicated the California
efforts. In 2001, Denver's federation sent one-fourth of the money,
$2.3 million, needed to pave a highway in Rio de Medina. The Oxnard
federation last year contributed one-fourth of the $1 million needed
to improve water distribution in Valparaiso.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its financial successes, the aggressive nature of the new
campaign to increase the number of clubs has offended Gomez, a
longtime Zacatecas activist in Santa Ana, especially after 13 clubs
split from his federation last year. He said he is reluctantly
attending the convention, which begins this morning at Santa Ana's
Embassy Suites Hotel and ends Sunday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "They have weakened our organization," said Gomez, who still leads
55 clubs. "It bothers me that the government was involved in that.
But I do want unity for our people. [Monreal] is a good governor but
he needs to straighten out his people."</TE>
<TE>   Monreal arrives today to pursue an agenda that includes
discussions about how to get ambulances and other donated items into
Mexico faster, how to keep the government from picking which projects
get funded, and how to reduce the number of leaders and create more
alliances among them.</TE>
<TE>   They also will discuss the high cost of sending money to Mexico
and the rights of immigrants in the United States, De la Cruz said.</TE>
<TE>   About 500 people are expected at the three-day convention. Each
participant will pay $50 to attend a banquet and the Orange County
club, Organizacion de Comunidades Zacatecanas en el Condado de
Orange, will pick up other costs. Discussions will continue Saturday,
and other events include a raffle for tractors to be sent to Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   That Monreal has created a Zacatecas network throughout another
country is not surprising to those who have watched how he has used
populist tactics during his political rise.</TE>
<TE>   He became the first PRD governor in 1998 in a state long
considered a stronghold of the PRI, which had dominated Mexican
politics until Vicente Fox became president in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   For Monreal, campaigning in Santa Ana seems natural even though
his state is 1,600 miles away.</TE>
<TE>   "If the rest of the Mexican governors had the vision this governor
has, their states would be better," De la Cruz said. "No governor has
the vision that Ricardo Monreal has."</TE>

<HD>Big, Fun and Cool Exhibits Pictured for Kids' Museum</HD>
<DH>Education: The facility, to be built in Hansen Dam
Recreation Area, aims to actively involve children in learning about
the natural world.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Once-fuzzy concepts for exhibits at the city's new Children's Museum
have been nailed down to the last high-tech detail and are ready to
be built.</LD>
<LD>   New York-based designer Edwin Schlossberg unveiled his ideas late
last year for exhibits for the $20-million, energy-efficient
structure to be built in the Hansen Dam Recreation Area in the
northeast San Fernando Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Museum Director Candace Barrett admitted that the proposed
exhibits were difficult to visualize.</LD>
<TE>   Until the museum is built and full of visitors, she said, "It's
hard to get a sense of it."</TE>
<TE>   "People think it's going to be an amusement park," said Marketing
Director Jennifer Gordon, who often describes the project to
community groups. "They think it's the next Six Flags, but I explain,
'No, it's an educational institution.' "</TE>
<TE>   The exhibits were modeled after an ecosystem, Schlossberg said,
and at the center of the museum ecosystem will stand three "life
nodes," called Tree, Dogbear and Puppycub.</TE>
<TE>   Expected to cost $13 million, the exhibits will be "a dynamic,
interdependent system that children power, change and keep running,"
planners said.</TE>
<TE>   Schlossberg's descriptions begin to make perfect sense when one
sees the drawings and specifications included in two large books of
plans that he and his colleagues have produced.</TE>
<TE>   Connecting the entire museum will be something that Schloss- berg,
56, calls the Big Fun Cool Thing, a transport system that runs
overhead, much like the moving rack at a dry cleaner's.</TE>
<TE>   Children will explore aspects of the natural world, including
earth, air, wind and fire--basic themes of the museum.</TE>
<TE>   Tubes built into the Big Fun Cool Thing will carry water and air
throughout the building, as well as lights, or fire.</TE>
<TE>   The Big Fun Cool Thing also will move children's artwork around
for everyone to see and will carry electronic messages.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on what's happening that day at the museum, the message
might be: "There are nine children here today with purple eyes,"
according to the plan.</TE>
<TE>   In the center of the museum, a waterfall will tumble 17 feet, with
waterwheels at the bottom that children can manipulate.</TE>
<TE>   Children are an essential part of the museum. Designers said, "The
system needs children to operate it in order to run."</TE>
<TE>   Sketches reveal Dogbear to be a 10-foot-long hollow, mechanized
animal, covered with knotted ropes instead of fur, so children can
climb on it. Soft material surrounds it in case they fall.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors can get inside its head, and there is wheelchair access
through its middle.</TE>
<TE>   Interactive Displays</TE>
<TE>   Interactivity is a Schlossberg specialty, Barrett and others said,
and he seems to relish giving children the opportunity to observe
cause and effect.</TE>
<TE>   Pet Dogbear and it wags its tail. Once inside, children can look
out and see the world through a dog's eyes. Its ears are full of
auditory sensors and devices. Children use bellows to simulate its
breathing and a suction hose to make it drink. Dogbear is the
ostensible parent of nearby Puppycub.</TE>
<TE>   Puppycub "eats" colored balls representing food that children
prepare for it in the museum's kitchen area. Then, to the predictable
delight of young visitors, the balls come out the back end of
Puppycub and fall through a pile of newspapers spread under it.</TE>
<TE>   Schlossberg studied with futurist R. Buckminster Fuller and
designed the exhibits for the Brooklyn Children's Museum and the
Immigration History Center at Ellis Island. He and his staff have
been working on the Los Angeles project for more than a year.</TE>
<TE>   Refinements are inevitable during the design process, and the
staff worked extensively with prototypes because, he said, "it's much
more difficult to fix an exhibit once it's built."</TE>
<TE>   Working with prototypes allows designers to discover just how an
exhibit will play.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes you think some device or design would be really cool,
but when you try it, Schlossberg said, you discover "it would
physically work, but it wouldn't be fun to do."</TE>
<TE>   The designers have created icons to explain how the exhibits work.
"Almost all the instructions are done with images rather than words,"
Schlossberg said.</TE>
<TE>   This was done in recognition of the extraordinary linguistic
variety in Los Angeles, and "because not all the kids are readers,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Just as children have to "feed" Dogbear and Puppycub to keep them
healthy, they have to give air, water and other essential elements to
Tree, a structure more than 20 feet tall.</TE>
<TE>   When visitors have pumped enough water into Tree and cared for it
optimally in other ways, it rewards them with what Schlossberg
describes as "a carnival-like moment." Its fruit flashes, its leaves
glow bright-green, birds chirp and music plays.</TE>
<TE>   The effects are created using fiber optics, which require little
energy and generate little heat. In short, it is a technology that
reflects the energy efficiency of the entire museum, Schlossberg
said.</TE>
<TE>   Bringing Ideas to Life</TE>
<TE>   A Los Angeles-area firm will likely be chosen to build the
exhibits, Schlossberg said. He does not expect the selection to be
made until next year.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a target around November to break ground," said Bill
Holland, chairman of the building committee for the museum, scheduled
to open in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   He said about half of the $33 million needed for the project had
been raised.</TE>
<TE>   Barrett thinks children will want to come back to the museum again
and again.</TE>
<TE>   She hopes it will function much as the backyards of childhood did.
"If you were lucky enough to have a backyard," she said, "every time
you went out into it, it was different."</TE>

<HD>Boy, 9, Shot in Buena Park During 4th Festivities</HD>
<DH>Crime: Police are unsure if the incident was a deliberate
act or celebratory gunfire.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 9-year-old was shot and critically wounded in Buena Park late
Thursday as he took part in a Fourth of July celebration in a crowded
public park, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The boy, who was struck once above the waist, was taken to UCI
Medical Center in Orange with a wound that could be life-threatening,
said Police Lt. Corey Sianez.</LD>
<LD>   The boy was at Boisseranc Park on Dale Street, north of La Palma
Avenue, celebrating with thousands, when he was shot about 9 p.m.,
Sianez said.</LD>
<TE>   Sianez said police officers were unsure who fired the shot or
whether the boy was the victim of celebratory gunfire into the air.</TE>
<TE>   "There's so many fireworks going on nobody would be able to
distinguish a gunshot," Sianez said.</TE>
<TE>   In recent days, police departments across the state stepped up
warnings about the dangers of firing guns into the air to celebrate
Independence Day.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Police Department launched a campaign asking
residents to call police if they see people shooting into the air.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1985, at least 40 people in Los Angeles County have been
killed by bullets fired in celebration on New Year's Eve and the
Fourth of July.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, 9-year-old Brian Perez was killed during
Independence Day celebrations in Los Angeles when a bullet fired into
the air struck him in the head as he played with friends.</TE>
<TE>   When a bullet is fired into the air, a typical slug leaving the
bullet casing climbs at a velocity of about 2,700 feet per second and
can soar as high as two miles.</TE>
<TE>   It can stay in the air more than a minute before falling to earth.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on the slug's orientation and weight, the speed of
descent can vary from 300 to 700 feet per second, Los Angeles police
said.</TE>

<HD>D.A. Gains Perspective on Grand Jury System</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As a veteran prosecutor, Tony Rackauckas knows his way around a grand
jury room. No doubt he has heard plenty of crybaby defendants and
weaseling defense lawyers complain about how the whole thing is
rigged against them as indictments are handed down.</LD>
<LD>   Oh how those complaints must have provided a parade of chuckles
for Mr. Rackauckas.</LD>
<LD>   He's not laughing now. In fact, it is the Orange County district
attorney himself who's doing the yapping.</LD>
<TE>   Now Rackauckas, fresh from a big reelection victory in March, is
the one indicted by the county grand jury. Not indicted in the legal
sense, but indicted in the layman sense. After taking testimony for
eight months, the grand jury concluded that Rackauckas has been far
from the moral exemplar he's supposed to be and claimed to be.</TE>
<TE>   The jurors' lengthy report chastised Rackauckas for intervening in
cases involving friends, for political cronyism and for a variety of
poor management practices.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, the panel found that from the outset of his
first term beginning in 1999, Rackauckas "set the wrong tone, which
continues to the present, that loyalty to the district attorney,
personally, is of prime importance."</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas has said the report is riddled with inaccuracies and
that he'll offer an extended rebuttal in the weeks ahead.</TE>
<TE>   It's a tight little box the D.A. is in.</TE>
<TE>   His defense, in essence, is that the grand jurors were led down
the primrose path by his accusers.</TE>
<TE>   It's a little fuzzy whether he thinks the jurors aren't overly
bright (They are, after all, allowed to question the accusers.) or
whether the grand jury system--which historically favors the
accuser--is skewed against poor old innocent people like himself.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, we have the mildly comic scenario of the county's top
legal officer being rebuked by an arm of the system that is usually a
prosecutor's handmaiden. It has left Rackauckas in the awkward
position of having to discredit the findings.</TE>
<TE>   They must be howling over at defense bar headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   In his first remarks on the subject, Rackauckas said that some of
the "inaccuracies" in the report could have been avoided if he had
"had an opportunity to read and discuss a preliminary report with the
grand jury in order to verify the accuracy of their findings."</TE>
<TE>   No defense lawyer could have said it better.</TE>
<TE>   The beauty of all this is that Rackauckas may be right. Maybe the
grand jury got it all wrong. Maybe jurors didn't ask the right
questions. Maybe they bought into the stuff said by Rackauckas'
"enemies" and have issued a distorted picture of the way he does
business.</TE>
<TE>   So what?</TE>
<TE>   What's Rackauckas going to do the next time he needs something
from a grand jury? How's he going to convince us we can trust that
the indictment is worth the paper it's printed on?</TE>
<TE>   There's another troubling element here, which didn't seem to
bother voters who gave Rackauckas an overwhelming endorsement at the
polls even after his election opponent had raised these same issues.
Namely, what if the grand jury got it right?</TE>
<TE>   The jurors have backed up what Rackauckas' detractors have said.
Remember how when this all started he suggested that the grand jury
investigation was routine maintenance, no big deal? That the
accusations were petty politics?</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney might somehow be vindicated, but at this
stage, you have to conclude that his opponents weren't just blowing
smoke. The grand jury could have come back with kudos for the job
Rackauckas was doing.</TE>
<TE>   No such luck. The grand jury jilted him. Now the county Board of
Supervisors has hired an outside law firm to review the jury's
findings.</TE>
<TE>   I wonder if the district attorney knows where to find a good
lawyer.</TE>

<HD>Figure in Key 1985 Case Dies</HD>
<DH>Suicide: Sagon Penn was found to have shot in self-defense
when he killed a police officer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>A man who killed one police officer and wounded another in 1985 in an
incident that led to substantial changes in the Police Department's
approach to the black community was found dead Thursday after an
apparent suicide overdose, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The body of Sagon Penn, 40 was found by his mother on the floor of
an apartment they shared in the suburb of Spring Valley. Officials
said a suicide note nearby suggested that he had apparently taken an
overdose of prescription anti-psychotic drugs because of a sense of
hopelessness.</LD>
<LD>   The changes brought about by the Penn case were credited with
helping San Diego avoid the kind of violence that erupted in Los
Angeles and other U.S. cities in 1992 after a Simi Valley jury found
white officers not guilty in the beating of black motorist Rodney G.
King.</LD>
<TE>   Two racially diverse San Diego juries found that Penn, an African
American, had acted in self-defense when two white officers, in what
started as a routine traffic stop, began beating him with fists and
nightsticks. One officer used racial slurs.</TE>
<TE>   In a brief but violent struggle witnessed by two dozen neighbors,
Penn, a martial arts expert, took away one officer's gun and began
firing, killing Officer Thomas Riggs, severely wounding Officer
Donovan Jacobs and wounding a civilian, Sara Pina-Ruiz.</TE>
<TE>   The incident was a wake-up call to officials about a growing
estrangement between police and residents of low-income,
predominantly African American neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "The Penn case brought to the surface all the boiling resentments,
prejudices and misunderstandings that existed between police and the
black community," said Milton Silverman, a lawyer who defended Penn.</TE>
<TE>   Penn never testified. But witnesses said the officers became
enraged after he refused to remove his driver's license from a
plastic holder in his wallet.</TE>
<TE>   The case tarnished the reputation of the Police Department when
testimony suggested that police handling of evidence had supported
the prosecution and that police had hidden records showing that
Jacobs had been reprimanded for using racial epithets.</TE>
<TE>   Although bitterly disappointed at Penn's acquittal at his second
trial in 1987, police officials redoubled efforts to hire and promote
minority officers and to listen to citizens' complaints. Advisory
boards and a citizens review commission were formed.</TE>
<TE>   Penn, who had once dreamed of becoming a police officer, was never
able to find emotional or financial stability.</TE>
<TE>   He was arrested for battery, vandalism and domestic violence and
served time in jail.</TE>

<HD>Pleading for Less Secrecy in Juvenile Courts</HD>
<DH>Some push to open up noncriminal hearings. Others say
judges already have that discretion and fear blanket media access
might hurt children.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's standing room only most mornings in the third-floor hallways of
the juvenile courthouse in Orange. Young couples, some entire
families, fill benches and line the walls, looking as though they are
waiting for the courtrooms to open.</LD>
<LD>   But behind twin wooden doors, judges are conducting serious
business, deciding what to do with children who have allegedly been
neglected or abused by their parents. The proceedings are closed to
the public, so only the parents and their lawyers are allowed into
the courtroom, one case at a time.</LD>
<LD>   It's been this way for decades. Seeking to protect the privacy of
children who in some instances have suffered unspeakable abuse,
California lawmakers have declared these hearings off-limits to the
public without a court order.</LD>
<TE>   That could soon change. Some California judges and children's
advocates are pressing for legislative changes that would make it
easier for the public--and the media--to attend juvenile hearings.</TE>
<TE>   Though juvenile criminal proceedings would remain closed, the
hearings at which judges decide what to do with abused and neglected
children would be open if the groups get their way.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to change the law to allow public access to juvenile
dependency hearings failed in 2000 amid heavy opposition from
children's rights groups.</TE>
<TE>   But proponents are now talking about reintroducing legislation or
at the very least starting a pilot program that would measure the
effect of opening the hearings. One powerful children's lobbying
group that opposed the 2000 legislation has hosted three recent
seminars to explore the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Those who want to open the courtrooms say the system would work
better if it operated in full public view; that social workers,
lawyers and judges would perform more thoughtfully if they knew their
actions could receive public scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   Across the country, several states have opened such hearings. In
1980, Oregon became the first state to make its juvenile hearings
public, allowing members of the media--or anyone else who is
interested--to watch as judges decide whether to take custody of
children allegedly victimized by their parents.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel R. Murphy, a circuit court judge in Linn County, Ore., said
he has had no complaints about the open proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's a lot of benefits. The government operates better
when it's under scrutiny," he said. "Other families will come in and
watch what happens to the families before them, and it gives them a
sense of what to expect. It's not a mystery to them. And a lot of the
scary stories they may have heard are dispelled when they see another
family go through a process that's not intimidating."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of open proceedings argue that media exposure would
further harm children recovering from physical and emotional wounds.</TE>
<TE>   "These kids have been victimized once; I don't want them to be
victimized again," said Alan Watahara, president of the California
Children's Lobby.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he said he might support legislation that would make it
easier for the public or media to attend the hearings and noted that
there have been discussions in the state about a pilot program in
which Juvenile Courts in some counties would be temporarily opened to
the public.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not saying, 'No, we don't want open courts.' I'm just saying
we have to be very thoughtful about who, how, where and when,"
Watahara said.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the private hearings, juvenile dependency trials are
among the least publicized proceedings in the state court system.</TE>
<TE>   A case moves into the system when county social workers attempt to
take custody of an endangered or abused child. In many instances,
there is a lawyer for each parent and a lawyer for the child while a
judge decides whether to take custody of the child or return the
child to his or her parents, and whether further court monitoring is
necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Media representatives contend that they could do a better job of
reporting about the efficiency of the system if they were allowed
complete access.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a process that is entirely unchecked by any exposure to
public scrutiny," said Terry Francke, general counsel to the
California First Amendment Coalition, which supports public access to
the Juvenile Courts. "I've heard stories of parents who want to take
their experiences public and being told by the court they can't, and
if they do, their children may suffer for it and they may have
trouble seeing their children."</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the proposals say that California judges already have
the discretion to allow the public into juvenile proceedings and thus
that a law mandating open courtrooms is unwise.</TE>
<TE>   "The current rules allow the court to control the dissemination of
information," said William W. Patton, a professor at Whittier Law
School in Costa Mesa, who wrote an analysis opposing the 2000
legislation. "If we change the rules, it inverts everything."</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Clara County, Judge Leonard Edwards said he routinely
opens his Juvenile Court to the public. "I believe the public has a
right and a need to know what goes on ... with our tax dollars and
our most vulnerable children," Edwards said.</TE>

<LD>An Oxnard farm worker was fatally stabbed Wednesday night following
an altercation at the Mira Loma apartment complex in Oxnard, police
said.</LD>
<LD>   The victim was identified by the coroner Thursday as 31-year-old
Amador Lopez.</LD>
<LD>   The stabbing reportedly occurred following an argument at the
apartment complex at 1600 West 5th St.</LD>
<TE>   Police officials said they received a report at about 8:30 p.m. of
a disturbance at the pool area. When officers arrived, they found
only Lopez, lying in a grassy area in the courtyard with a stab wound
to the chest.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez was transported to St. John's Regional Medical Center, where
he died a short time later, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The attack remains under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of the 157-unit apartment complex said Thursday they did
not know whether Lopez lived there.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral arrangements are being handled by Garcia Mortuary in
Oxnard. An official there confirmed Thursday that Lopez was a laborer
whose family lived in Arizona.</TE>

<HD>Unity on Parade in Southland</HD>
<DH>Holiday: From Ojai to Huntington Beach, Sept. 11 injects
new meaning, along with renewed patriotism, into Independence Day
celebrations.</DH>

<LD>Beverly White never felt more American.</LD>
<LD>   Decked out in a sequined jacket styled after Old Glory, the
69-year-old Ventura resident watched with delight Thursday as
cheerleaders, baton-twirlers and horseback riders marched past in
Ojai's Fourth of July parade--one of many patriotism-packed
celebrations throughout Ventura County.</LD>
<LD>   "I think since Sept. 11, Americans are more united," said White,
her red-white-and-blue-jeweled earrings sparkling. "We're more aware
of the freedoms we have here."</LD>
<TE>   Amid renewed anxiety over possible terrorist threats, thousands of
Southland residents celebrated the first post-Sept. 11 Independence
Day under heightened security and an even greater sense of
patriotism.</TE>
<TE>   The tension was aggravated by a shooting Thursday at Los Angeles
International Airport that left three dead, including the gunman.
Although there was no immediate indication the shooting involved
terrorism, that fear fueled concerns.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting gave Julie Milne pause as she and her family gathered
at their summer vacation home in Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, 'Oh, my gosh! Terrorists have struck us again,' " said
Milne, who lives in Las Vegas. "We are just trying to enjoy the
holiday and think about the meaning of it."</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of the fears--or perhaps because of them--Fourth of
July celebrants found meanings big and small as they clung to
tradition on this most American of holidays.</TE>
<TE>   ''I think everyone is taking a different look at things this year,
like wanting to keep families close together,'' said Rose Obradovich,
a 25-year Ojai resident who sat in the shade watching the town parade
with her husband, Steve, and her dog, Sugar.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all waiting and hoping nothing is going to happen," she
said. "But we're also going on with our lives."</TE>
<TE>   The Ojai parade drew 10,000 people--2,000 more than the population
of the small town at the base of Los Padres National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   "It's classic Americana," said Ventura County Supervisor Steve
Bennett, who waved to constituents from an electric go-cart. "You
know almost everyone, and you are so close to the people you can
actually shake hands."</TE>
<TE>   Added Mayor Steve Olsen: "Nobody in Ojai misses the Fourth of
July. They wait to go on vacation until after the parade."</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura, nearly 20,000 people crowded Main Street for the
city's annual street fair and Independence Day celebration, while
hundreds of holiday revelers headed to the beach.</TE>
<TE>   Police and parks officials closed access to Grant Park, a popular
hillside spot overlooking downtown, amid concerns about the threat of
wildfires from illegal fireworks.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the countless parades, fairs and barbecues, there were many
reminders of the September tragedies, as well as the nation's
resilience.</TE>
<TE>   In Rancho Cucamonga, a parade featured girders and a firetruck
from the World Trade Center wreckage.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters, the first line of defense in this new war, received
standing ovations on Main Streets across the land. The military, the
first line of offense, gained renewed admiration.</TE>
<TE>   Janine Wiberly, 36, and her fiance, Louis Zaffino, 38, were
perched on a ledge watching the Huntington Beach parade. When Vietnam
War veterans marched past, the couple said it stirred deep emotions.</TE>
<TE>   "It sent shivers down my spine," said Zaffino, attending his first
Fourth of July parade.</TE>
<TE>   Just down the street, Jack Real, 59, felt something similar as he
stood in a crowd where most were clad in some permutation of Old
Glory.</TE>
<TE>   Real, who resembles a cross between Santa Claus and a hard-core
biker, said he feels more camaraderie these days in the beach town
that he has called home for four decades.</TE>
<TE>   When he rides his black bicycle, outfitted with a skull and pirate
flag, children and their mothers give him the thumbs up in greeting.</TE>
<TE>   The events of Sept. 11, he said, spawned a sense of unity he
hasn't seen in years.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, look at [President] Bush," said Real, who makes no secret
of his Democratic leanings.</TE>
<TE>   "He practically stole the election, and now the whole country is
behind him. I am behind him," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Cuppy, a real estate agent and Boy Scout volunteer, was
running about handing out little American flags.</TE>
<TE>   It's an annual tradition for him, but this year he doubled his
patriotic giveaway.</TE>
<TE>   "I got 400 flags," he said, nearly breathless. "Normally, I give
out about 200 or 250. After all that has happened, we need more
flags."</TE>

<LD>Local and federal law enforcement authorities were searching Thursday
for a small plane stolen from a Camarillo Airport runway.</LD>
<LD>   The 1971 Cessna 182, white with a green stripe along its side, was
stolen between Monday and Wednesday afternoon, Ventura County
Sheriff's Capt. Steve Wade said.</LD>
<LD>   The theft was reported to the Federal Aviation Administration and
FBI, which sent alerts to airports nationwide, sheriff's spokesman
Eric Nishimoto said.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities have no reason to believe the theft is linked to
terrorism, Wade said. "The heightened awareness about it comes from
the current environment we're living in," he said. Anyone with
information is urged to call sheriff's officials at 654-2311.</TE>

<HD>Sept. 11 Debris Creates a Hush</HD>
<DH>Parade: Thousands turn out in Rancho Cucamonga to greet
shipment of wreckage from the attack on New York's twin towers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RANCHO CUCAMONGA</DL>
<LD>RANCHO CUCAMONGA -- There has never been an Independence Day parade
here like the one that drew an estimated 15,000 onlookers Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   There were no marching bands, no flag-twirling drill teams or
service club floats festooned with red, white and blue streamers.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, two flatbed trailer trucks carrying wreckage from the
Sept. 11 terror attacks on New York's World Trade Center traveled
slowly past the somber crowd lining two streets in this sleepy
foothill community 40 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   One trailer held the remains of a New York City fire truck that
officials said had been battered to destruction by the collapse of
the twin towers. The other carried 16 tons of twisted steel beams
pulled from the ruins.</TE>
<TE>   The steel will be used to make a pair of identical memorial
sculptures commemorating the heroism of firefighters and police
officers who were killed as they attempted to rescue people from the
twin towers.</TE>
<TE>   San Bernardino County residents and officials accompanied the
wreckage on an 11-day trek across the country. Now they hope to raise
$12 million to pay for the 37-foot-tall memorials.</TE>
<TE>   The planned design will resemble a huge sundial whose shadow will
touch 8:45 a.m. each Sept. 11. The bottom of the sundial will depict
a stairwell filled with rescuers and victims; the top will portray
flames--including one that a firefighter is disappearing into.</TE>
<TE>   Those planning the "Freedom's Flame" memorial plan to place one
sculpture in the Rancho Cucamonga area. They hope to find a spot in
New York City for the other.</TE>
<TE>   The memorial was conceived by San Bernardino County Dist. Atty.
Dennis Stout.</TE>
<TE>   But Stout concedes that it may take years to raise the money
required to pay for the work and to win permission of New York
officials to erect part of it there.</TE>
<TE>   "When the French first proposed giving the Statue of Liberty to
New York, there was little interest," Stout said Thursday as hundreds
crowded around the truckload of twisted beams at Chaffey College to
sign their names on the rusting ironwork.</TE>
<TE>   If a memorial created in remote Rancho Cucamonga seems audacious
to New Yorkers, Stout is emboldened by a previous public sculpture
effort. It was a statue called "Officer Down," depicting a police
officer coming to the aid of a mortally wounded colleague.</TE>
<TE>   The names of San Bernardino police officers killed in the line of
duty are listed on that statue, three copies of which are displayed
in public buildings around the county. Stout organized a private
foundation that raised $350,000 to pay for the artwork.</TE>
<TE>   Stout hopes a similar foundation will fund "Freedom's Flame." The
sale of such things as posters, T-shirts and commemorative coins has
raised $50,000 so far, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sculptor Lawrence Noble, a Crestline artist who worked with Stout
on the memorial to slain police officers, said the proposed sculpture
would allow visitors to touch the depictions of rescuers and victims
and experience some of the horror of Sept. 11 themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Those watching Thursday's procession said they had been touched by
the sight of the World Trade Center wreckage.</TE>
<TE>   "Seeing this makes it all seem so much more real," said a Fontana
resident, Angela Pipkin, as her 8-year-old daughter, Amber, climbed
onto the trailer to inscribe one beam with the words: "God Bless
America from the Pipkin and Dotson families."</TE>
<TE>   Maryann Rivas of Riverside sobbed as she placed a homemade red,
white and blue wreath on a twisted section of iron.</TE>
<TE>   "I still feel the loss from that day," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Spectators were in a jubilant mood until the flatbed trucks slowly
drew into view.</TE>
<TE>   Danielle Wells, 10, of Rancho Cucamonga, had waved a flag and
shouted "Happy Fourth of July" to passing cars. But she fell silent
when the battered New York City fire truck and the tower wreckage
appeared.</TE>
<TE>   A few steps away, Bob Olari, a Rancho Cucamonga loan officer,
pulled off his cowboy hat and held it over his heart as the two
trucks passed by.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened back there happened to all of us," Olari said.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Buege, a Los Angeles County firefighter who spent a week last
fall in New York working at the twin towers site, stood reverently
next to his wife and parents as he watched the wreckage pass slowly
in front of him.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted them to experience a little of what I did back there,''
he said sadly.</TE>

<HD>'Pavley's Ploy' May Carjack Motorists' Right to Choice</HD>
<DH>How bad is the auto emissions bill? ... Let me count the
ways.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH GREEN</AU>
<BD>Kenneth Green, chief scientist at the Reason
Foundation, was an expert reviewer for the most recent report on
global warming prepared by the United Nations-sponsored
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's war on sport utility vehicles shifted into high gear
with the backroom passage Monday of a bill that would commandeer
consumer choice in automobiles under the largely fraudulent pretense
of combating global warming. This is political carjacking at its
worst.</LD>
<LD>   Unable to pass federal fuel-economy regulations to stop people
from driving the larger, more comfortable cars they want,
environmentalists have taken their efforts to Sacramento.</LD>
<LD>   A bill by Assemblywoman Fran Pavley (D-Agoura Hills) was the car
haters' vehicle of choice because anything affecting the huge
California car market is likely to affect the rest of the country.
The measure, if signed by the governor, would make California the
first state to regulate tailpipe emissions of greenhouse gases.</LD>
<TE>   Unable to pass the bill through the normal legislative process,
Pavley had its language inserted into a nonenvironmental, technical
bill sitting on the Senate floor and got it voted out of the Senate
on Saturday. Call it "Pavley's Ploy," in case they change its name
again to further confuse the public. The bill is now on Gov. Gray
Davis' desk.</TE>
<TE>   Pavley's Ploy is supposed to reduce California's emission of gases
that some computer models hold responsible for global warming. But
the numbers suggest that Pavley's Ploy isn't about preventing global
warming. It's about preventing you from buying that next truck or SUV
or driving the one you have as much as you want.</TE>
<TE>   According to government emissions data, California motorists
produce less than one-quarter of 1% of the world's emissions of the
gases theoretically linked to global warming. According to government
computer models, about 80% of observed or predicted global warming is
because of greenhouse gases, most of the rest being caused by changes
in land use for farming, forestry and so on. Whatever its other
effects, when it comes to preventing global warming, this bill would
provide virtually no benefit to future generations.</TE>
<TE>   The only way to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide from cars (the
main greenhouse gas they produce) is to either reduce the amount of
fuel they collectively burn or change to a fuel that puts out less
carbon dioxide per unit of energy. And the only way to do that is
through mandating technology that would lighten and shrink cars,
levying fuel taxes to reduce driving, adding per-mile driving fees to
keep motorists off the road or pushing "alternative fuel" technology
such as natural gas and electric-powered cars.</TE>
<TE>   All those approaches have known failings, expose people to more
risks and deprive them of consumer choice, suck resources out of the
economy and sink those resources into bureaucratic paper-shuffling.</TE>
<TE>   While climate change is still largely theoretical, the damaging
effects of regulatory approaches like these are well-established
facts. Not to put too fine a point on it, but forcing people into
smaller cars would kill some of them. The National Academy of
Sciences has acknowledged that lighter and smaller cars are
inherently more dangerous. And no, that's not simply in collisions
with SUVs. That's also true in accidents when some lightweight cars
hit a guardrail.</TE>
<TE>   Pavley's Ploy would also slow down the fight against the
better-understood pollutants such as ozone and particulate matter
because anything that raises the price of new cars reduces the single
biggest positive force in easing air pollution: buying a new,
less-polluting car.</TE>
<TE>   Worse still, taking money out of people's pockets for higher fuel
and automobile costs will mean less for other needs, such as
education and health care.</TE>
<TE>   The degradation of transparency in California's Legislature is
only the first harm that Pavley's Ploy would foist on the public. If
Gov. Davis signs the legislation, Californians will be poorer for it.</TE>

<HD>Put Palestinian Elections on the Back Burner</HD>
<DH>The Bush plan is a recipe for failure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN KATULIS</AU>
<BD>Brian Katulis worked on a number of democracy promotion
programs in the West Bank, Gaza and Egypt for the National Democratic
Institute from 1995 to 1998. He co-authored an NDI-Carter Center
report on the 1996 Palestinian elections, based on an election
monitoring mission headed by former President Carter. The views he
expresses in this article are his alone.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush's call for new Palestinian elections leaves the Middle
East in a dangerous limbo.</LD>
<LD>   The central concept in Bush's latest plan puts the cart before the
horse--requiring free elections and a new Palestinian leadership as a
precondition for moving forward. Yet, as a practical matter, no true
democratic election can take place without serious negotiations
between Israel and some sort of Palestinian leadership about specific
details of these elections.</LD>
<LD>   The first Palestinian general elections in 1996 took place only
after protracted negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian
leadership, at a time when the Oslo process was fresh and political
negotiations and security cooperation were at their apex.</LD>
<TE>   Special provisions for how Palestinians in East Jerusalem would
vote, collection procedures for ballot boxes, security measures--all
were subject to negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. With
very little communication between Israel and Palestinian leaders
today, how can new elections be organized?</TE>
<TE>   There are numerous practical matters to consider:</TE>
<TE>   * Who will administer these elections? The recent Israeli
incursions into the West Bank destroyed several Palestinian Authority
ministry buildings, many of them related to civil administration.</TE>
<TE>   Do the Palestinians have a valid voter registry and the technical
capacity to organize a free and fair election? If so, will Israel
permit anyone connected with Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority to
play a key role in organizing these elections? Who will adjudicate
electoral disputes, which are as likely to happen in Gaza City as
they are in Florida?</TE>
<TE>   * Who can run for office? Will Israel and the U.S. accept no
limitations on who can run for office? Will they leave the ballot
open to Hamas militants and Islamic Jihad extremists? If they attempt
to control who runs, then they risk compromising the open nature of
democracy. However, if restrictions are not set, leaders worse than
Arafat may emerge as victors.</TE>
<TE>   * Will there be a free and open debate? Will Israel and the U.S.
demand restrictions on certain types of campaign speech--red lines
that candidates cannot cross when it comes to Israel and the peace
process?</TE>
<TE>   If limits are introduced, then the legitimacy of a new Palestinian
democracy may be compromised. On the other hand, without limits on
anti-Israel hate speech, the campaign may become one big incitement
rally for further violence against Israeli civilians.</TE>
<TE>   * Who can vote? In 1996, special provisions were made for the
Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem, an area that Israel
considers to be part of its undivided capital. But in 1996 less than
half the eligible voters in East Jerusalem cast a ballot--largely a
result of a large Israeli security presence at East Jerusalem polling
sites--compared with a 73.5% voter turnout in the West Bank and Gaza.
Will there be guarantees of access to the polls for the 200,000
Palestinians in East Jerusalem?</TE>
<TE>   * Will Palestinian voters have unimpeded access to the polls? In
the years since the first Palestinian elections, Israel has built new
settlements and created a new network of roads that extend across the
West Bank and Gaza Strip. The access roads that connect settlements
with Israel proper are frequently closed at a moment's notice,
leaving Palestinians stranded at checkpoints for hours on end in the
Israeli effort to ensure the settlers' safety.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, as a result of Israel's recent incursions, the
portions of the West Bank once partly controlled by the Palestinian
Authority are divided into at least eight zones with more than 100
Israeli checkpoints. Will Israel be willing to close these roads to
settlers on election day to ensure unfettered access to the polling
stations for all eligible Palestinian voters?</TE>
<TE>   Beyond these basic logistical questions, there are obvious,
broader questions, such as what to do if Arafat is reelected.</TE>
<TE>   The call for Palestinian democracy is noble, but it is not a
strategy for peace.</TE>
<TE>   Without making a serious effort to restart political negotiations
and security cooperation, and integrating the drive for democracy
with broader diplomatic efforts, the Bush plan is a recipe for
failure, destined to meet the fate of previous American Middle East
peace plans.</TE>

<AU>DAVID D. PERLMUTTER</AU>
<BD>David D. Perlmutter is an associate professor of mass
communication at Louisiana State University and a senior fellow at
the Reilly Center for Media &amp; Public Affairs. He is the author of
"Policing the Media" (Sage, 2000).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A fish counter at a supermarket in my city is occasionally staffed by
a fellow whom my family likes to think of as a former Enron
executive--or maybe he's from Arthur Andersen, Tyco, Adelphia or
WorldCom. Pointing to gray, pungent salmon steaks I ask with a
straight face: "Are these fresh?" Without blinking he will nod.
"Sure. Just in." I thank him, move on and return another day when one
of the other clerks will crack open the actually fresh fish box in
the back.</LD>
<LD>   I've often thought of confronting "Captain Pinocchio," as our
family dubs him. How can you just stand there and lie? About fish?</LD>
<LD>   Alas, I'm sure he thinks of himself as an honorable man. And so do
they all, big and small: Tyco's L. Dennis Kozlowski (accused of tax
avoidance), Andersen's Joseph Bernardino (accused of overseeing
obstruction of justice in the Enron case), Bernard Ebbers of WorldCom
(accused of sweethearting himself a $366-million loan), John Rigas et
familia of Adelphia, who made billions in loans to themselves out of
the company cookie jar, the Merrill Lynch "advisors" fined $100
million for their misleading, self-interested recommendations of
garbage stocks and, of course, the capos of the Enron mafia.</LD>
<TE>   That's the problem. Ethics has become such a marginal component of
business education and training that more and more people, from the
local fishmonger to the Lear-jetting CEO, think that doing good
business has nothing to do with doing good.</TE>
<TE>   The big fallout of the collapse of what used to be norms of
ethical business practice is obvious: The markets are as lifeless as
those salmon cuts, and some companies are belly-up. Good news, like
unexpectedly green earning reports, used to drive rallies. Now, who
doesn't assume good news is just a prestidigitation of shady
accounting?</TE>
<TE>   But, as a teacher, I see the smaller, more personal wounds of the
culture of "unethics."</TE>
<TE>   Every semester, each course I teach features a session that I
dread. I call it "E" day. For students, that term signifies exams,
but for me it's the class period in which we specifically discuss
ethics. No other three hours of my life leave me as gloomy.</TE>
<TE>   One lad worked at a fast-food restaurant. He was given
comprehensive training in the chain's hygiene regime, whose published
codes would have satisfied NASA technicians. But then the lunch shift
began, and the customers wanted their curly fries right away. And the
counter was short-staffed. And the manager was yelling to "pump them
out." So little details, like washing hands after going to the
bathroom or handling money, or changing the oil in the frying bin or
using a hankie when sneezing, got shunted aside.</TE>
<TE>   Another student's father was a property appraiser. The real estate
agents make it clear that unless he inflates the price of the houses
he evaluates, he will not get their business again. A young man
relates that, at a magazine where he interned, "the news guys print
stories that the advertising guys tell them to."</TE>
<TE>   Over and over, story after story, the pattern is the same.
Companies list and preach often voluminous ethical rules or
guidelines. Then everyone is put into situations of customer
pressure, deadlines, sales-volume demands, profit maximization
targets and productivity quotas that make following the ethical path
impossible, or at least career-dampening.</TE>
<TE>   Many of my students register the ambiguous ethical messages of the
workplace as confirmation of their cynicism. "How can we be ethical
when the company isn't?" one challenged me. Others anguish over their
principles, religious and secular, crashing into the demands of their
vocational aspirations.</TE>
<TE>   Of course corporations are reaping what they sow--and in more than
depressed stock prices. A survey of businesses, government agencies
and nonprofit groups by the accounting firm KPMG found that losses
from employee theft more than doubled from 1994 to 2000. Employee
thieving now costs about five times as much in goods as shoplifting.
We need an ethical revolution in the modern workplace, where
companies appoint "integrity specialists" to the management team and
ethicists to the board of directors. Perhaps, too, investment
analysts should rate companies on scales of integrity.</TE>
<TE>   Such moves toward restoring faith in business would help at the
top. Among the sales clerks and fry chefs, the first issue is
learning to treat the customer as a human being to be respected, not
a rube on the midway. I'm enough of a sucker to believe that most
workers at least want to be honest on the job, but they need the
leadership and incentives to be so.</TE>

<LD>"If I had it to do over again, I'd just let it rip," Gore told a
private gathering of many of his most significant donors and
fund-raisers, according to an aide who relayed the remarks to
reporters. "To hell with the polls, tactics and all the rest. I would
have poured out my heart and my vision for America's future."</LD>
<LD>   --Washington Post,</LD>
<LD>   June 30, 2002</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pity Al Gore. Like the comic-book character Howard the Duck, he's
"trapped in a world that he never made."</TE>
<TE>   Gore's conduct in the 2000 presidential campaign--despite the fact
that he won the popular vote--has been widely criticized.</TE>
<TE>   And, indeed, he seemed most of the time to be a kind of media
Frankenstein, an artificial product whose every position and passion,
every word and gesture, emerged from focus groups and opinion
surveys.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign amounted to a kind of reductio ad absurdum of
American politics. He tried to so fully embody what we want from a
politician, tried so thoroughly to erase himself with polling data,
that he ceased to exist at all.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally he tried to simulate passion--if the focus groups
responded to passion--but he was, and remains, absolutely incapable
of arousing any.</TE>
<TE>   Gore hence came to embody postmodern politics and postmodern
media, in which image and reality are impossible to distinguish from
one another, or in which there is no difference between them.</TE>
<TE>   It got so severe by the end that the question of "who Al Gore
really is" seemed impossible to ask: He "really" was a sheer media
image, a computer animation.</TE>
<TE>   It reached the point at which asking who Al Gore really is, deep
inside, was like asking who Shrek really is: He really is whatever
he's programmed to be, whatever sells tickets.</TE>
<TE>   Now Gore regrets his lost authenticity, pines nostalgically for
the time when he actually existed. But it is too late. His
authenticity is conceptually unrecoverable.</TE>
<TE>   There is nothing left for the authentic Al Gore to be or to do or
to say.</TE>
<TE>   Look at it like this: The idea that Gore wasn't authentic enough
in the last campaign is itself a media criticism of that campaign.
It's precisely the commentators and the focus groups and the polls
that have told Gore he wasn't real enough.</TE>
<TE>   And so Gore has resolved to get real: "I would spend more time
speaking from the heart on a few occasions each week, addressing the
major challenges of the country in-depth, and spend a lot less time
going to media events and making tactical moves."</TE>
<TE>   But, of course, that is itself a tactical move and a media event.</TE>
<TE>   Gore has abandoned his truth fatally, fully, permanently. His
condition is chronic, and there is no treatment. Every attempt to
regain his authenticity only casts a new, infinitely repeated image
through the hall of mirrors that is his political life and our media
experience of that life.</TE>
<TE>   Once you succumb fully to the postmodern condition, once you allow
yourself to be eviscerated entirely by the media machine, there is
nothing--literally, nothing--left.</TE>
<TE>   You have ceased merely to represent your self falsely; you have
become a lie. You have lost your self entirely; have released your
self fully into the realm of fiction. For Gore to try to get rid of
his media image is to re-create his media image, and we won't believe
in him any more afterward than we did before.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PIR PANJAL RANGE, India</DL>
<LD>To prove a point, fighters from one of the world's most ruthless
guerrilla armies emerged from the dense mountain forest and walked
right under the noses of Indian soldiers hunkered down in hillside
bunkers.</LD>
<LD>   The 15 Jaish-e-Mohammed militants chose a farmhouse next to a site
the Indian army often uses for ambushes as the meeting place for a
rare interview with a foreign journalist, as if daring the security
forces to come out and fight.</LD>
<LD>   "You can see for yourself," Alim Khan said with a smile, as his
men set up a defensive perimeter around the house Tuesday night. "The
Indian army is terrified."</LD>
<TE>   Khan, 24, is deputy divisional commander of the Jaish-e-Mohammed
in the Pir Panjal, a mountain range that forms the western edge of
the Himalayas, with steep canyon walls and peaks that rise to over
19,000 feet.</TE>
<TE>   It is a busy crossroads for separatist rebels fighting Indian rule
in the region, and villagers say at least eight guerrilla forces are
active in the area, in spite of several hundred thousand police and
soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   The disputed Kashmir region is divided between India and Pakistan.
Separatists in India's Jammu and Kashmir state are seeking
independence or unity with Pakistan, where the vast majority of
citizens share their Muslim faith.</TE>
<TE>   U.S.-led efforts to get Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf to
prevent the separatists from crossing into Indian-held territory, and
to close down the guerrillas' training camps in Pakistani-controlled
areas, will not stop Jaish-e-Mohammed, Khan said.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as the people of Jammu and Kashmir are concerned, we have
never taken up arms for Pakistan, nor are we going to lay them down
for Pakistan," Khan said, shifting a Kalashnikov assault rifle in his
lap. "We have taken up the gun for our own cause.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not terrorists," Khan insisted. "Go to any street of any
village, even any child will tell you how the [Indian] security
forces are committing atrocities against us. Women are being harassed
and physically and sexually assaulted."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking with a bluster that suggested his group has not been
cowed by either Pakistani or Indian forces, Khan described what he
said was a recent encounter with Indian soldiers as more proof that
his men are feared in the mountains, where they say they move freely
after sunset.</TE>
<TE>   "Just a few days ago, the army crossed my path twice, and there
were only two of us," Khan said. "But the soldiers were so terrified
that they didn't fire at us.</TE>
<TE>   "The army doesn't want to fight here," he asserted, "but they are
forced to by the politicians."</TE>
<TE>   Jaish-e-Mohammed's cadres are fierce fighters who say they are
waging jihad, or holy struggle, to free Jammu and Kashmir state from
Indian rule. It is a cause for which they say they are eager to die.
Martyrdom in this blood-stained Shangri-La of soaring mountains and
terraced green rice fields, they believe, will send them straight to
paradise.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the law of the world: The sufferer who gets killed while
defending or demanding his rights is called a martyr," Khan said.
"And the whole world calls him a hero. So if we get killed fighting
for our cause, we will be martyrs as well."</TE>
<TE>   To India's government, Jaish-e-Mohammed is a band of terrorists
supported by Pakistan in a proxy war that New Delhi says Musharraf's
government is still waging, despite his promises to stop.</TE>
<TE>   The name Jaish-e-Mohammed sends tremors through the Indian
security forces like that of few other enemies. The group, which
relies heavily on Pakistani and other foreign fighters, is notorious
for suicide attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The group's leaders include Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh, who is on
trial in a Pakistani court in the kidnapping and murder of American
reporter Daniel Pearl.</TE>
<TE>   Indian authorities say Jaish-e-Mohammed militants were involved in
the Dec. 13 attack on parliament in New Delhi, in which nine victims
and the five attackers died.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf banned the group and four other organizations in
January, during an earlier round of international demands to avert a
war between India and Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Khan agreed to an interview on condition that the exact location
not be revealed. The meeting was delayed by a day after guerrillas
and Indian troops fought nearby for at least two hours late Monday,
with mortars and assault rifles.</TE>
<TE>   Guides who brought the reporter into the mountains were told to
wait for instructions before climbing to one of three possible
rendezvous points.</TE>
<TE>   But Khan quickly got word of the journalist's arrival through a
network of village informants and appeared at the farmhouse door with
a lieutenant, Ajmer ul Islam, 24, an angry man who appeared
suspicious. He wore a round, flat-topped pakol hat popular among
Afghans and with tribesmen in Pakistan's North-West Frontier
Province.</TE>
<TE>   At least 12 guerrillas encircled the house, ready for an attack by
some of the 200 Indian soldiers based at a hillside camp only a few
hundred yards away.</TE>
<TE>   The rebels waiting in the moonlight would have made easy targets
for snipers or mortars. However, any firefight would risk killing
villagers, and soldiers may have held their fire for that reason.</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers shot at least one flare that lighted up the night sky
over their camp, a guide said later, but neither side fired shots
during the guerrillas' half-hour visit to the village.</TE>
<TE>   As Khan and Islam sat cross-legged on the basement floor next to a
bed, a man covered in a black hood that left only a slit for his eyes
guarded the door, waving what looked like a 9-millimeter automatic
pistol.</TE>
<TE>   "Do your work quickly," he hissed, after getting word of the
Indian flare.</TE>
<TE>   Khan, who said he was a student of Islamic literature before
taking up arms six years ago, spoke with a poetic flair in Urdu, a
language common in both Pakistan and India. But he did not speak in
what he said was his mother tongue: Kashmiri.</TE>
<TE>   Islam said very little, and the few words he did mutter in Urdu
suggested a Pakistani accent. While Khan smiled and clearly enjoyed
showing off oratorically, Islam only stared ahead coldly.</TE>
<TE>   "I begin with the name of the Almighty, who is merciful," Khan
began. Then he dismissed Musharraf as largely irrelevant to the fate
of Kashmir. India and Pakistan began fighting over the region more
than five decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as Mr. Musharraf is concerned, he must be dealing with his
own problems and pressures," Khan said. "But as far as Mr.
Musharraf's statement or ban [on Jaish-e-Mohammed] is concerned, it
is limited to Pakistan and it is not going to affect our cause and
movement in any way."</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf promised U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Richard L.
Armitage and President Bush last month that Pakistan would end what
India calls "cross-border terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   The commitment came under intense U.S. and other foreign pressure
amid fear of all-out war between the two nuclear powers. India
threatened to attack Pakistan after three gunmen opened fire on an
army base near the city of Jammu and on a bus carrying mostly wives
and children of Indian army soldiers. The May 14 attack left 34
people dead.</TE>
<TE>   India's new foreign minister, Yashwant Sinha, charged Wednesday
that infiltrations into Jammu and Kashmir state are continuing after
a brief lull. Indian troops killed three militants trying to cross
from Pakistani-held territory between June 24 and 27, and three more
suspected infiltrators Saturday. Another militant was slain after
crossing into Indian-controlled Kashmir on Sunday, according to the
Indian army.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan angrily denied Sinha's claim that Musharraf had reneged
on his promise, and accused New Delhi of stirring up trouble by
refusing to respond to Musharraf's peace overtures.</TE>
<TE>   Khan said his group continues to recruit young men to join the
jihad and claimed that they receive training in Jammu and
Kashmir--not, as India insists, in Pakistani territory. He admitted,
though, that his guerrillas have changed tactics to stay supplied
with ammunition.</TE>
<TE>   "Earlier, we were attacking the army and not taking their guns
with us, but now we have started taking them," Khan said.</TE>
<TE>   "In the future, we are going to use their arms against them. And
by the grace of God, after this ban [in Pakistan], our moujahedeen
have done a better job and we have put more pressure on the [Indian]
army."</TE>
<TE>   The owner of the farmhouse was feeling the pressure of having Khan
and his lieutenant as lingering guests, with the army not far from
his door. And when the man in the black hood suggested that it was a
good time to go, Khan reluctantly stopped talking and rose to leave.</TE>
<TE>   Islam scolded his perspiring host for worrying so much: "We have
to be martyrs someday, so why not today?"</TE>

<HD>Big Battle for a Silly Old Bear</HD>
<DH>Who owns the honey pot? An 81-year-old widow is taking on
Disney in a fight over Winnie the Pooh and a $1-billion-a-year
empire.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Once upon a time--well, actually 78 years ago--a British playwright
named Alan Alexander Milne scribbled some lighthearted verses about a
boy and his constant companion, a dimwitted bear who couldn't get
enough honey.</LD>
<LD>   Winnie the Pooh was an immediate sensation. Milne spent the rest
of his life trying to escape the suffocating shadow of his cuddly
creation. Even today, people can't get enough of that silly old
bear--or his honey.</LD>
<LD>   Pooh has become a $1 billion-a-year industry for Walt Disney Co.,
which acquired rights to the Milne characters in 1961. Disney has put
Pooh and his forest friends in movies and computer software, on its
ABC television network and on videotapes and DVDs. There's Pooh fruit
juice and Tigger telephones. Pooh Beanie Babies dressed in satiny
feng shui robes and leather-like black biker jackets. Piglet cookie
jars. Pooh chopsticks. A toaster that plays a Pooh jingle while
toasting bread in a pattern that resembles the bear's face.</LD>
<TE>   At Tokyo Disneyland, visitors wait two hours to ride Pooh's Honey
Hunt--the park's most popular attraction.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Disney paid $352 million to buy the remaining Pooh
rights from various Milne heirs in England. Yet there remains one
threat to the entertainment giant's Pooh empire. Her name is Shirley
Slesinger Lasswell.</TE>
<TE>   Lasswell is an 81-year-old widow who lives in Beverly Hills and
gets around in a chauffeured silver Mercedes with a 3-foot Pooh doll
buckled in beside her. Lasswell and her daughter inherited
merchandising rights to Milne's characters half a century ago from
Lasswell's first husband, a literary agent.</TE>
<TE>   In 1961, Lasswell turned those rights over to Disney for a share
of the merchandising revenue. Since then, she and her daughter,
Patricia Slesinger, have collected $66 million in Pooh riches. But
they are unhappy. They contend that Disney has cheated them out of at
least $200 million in royalties and are asking a court to terminate
their Disney contract so they can shop their Pooh rights to other
companies.</TE>
<TE>   Their 11-year-old lawsuit, one of the longest-running sagas in Los
Angeles Superior Court, is set for trial in March.</TE>
<TE>   For Disney, the stakes are enormous. The company recently warned
shareholders that "damages could total as much as several hundred
million dollars and adversely impact ... any future exploitation" of
Pooh, Piglet, Tigger and Eeyore.</TE>
<TE>   It has been a nasty fight. In the early 1990s, Disney workers
shredded boxes of old files sought by Lasswell and her daughter,
including one labeled "Winnie the Pooh, Legal Problems." Disney says
the papers were irrelevant, but a judge last year fined the company
$90,000 and ruled that the jury would be told about the destruction
of evidence if the case was to go to trial.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides agree that Lasswell and her daughter are entitled to
Disney royalties on a wide range of Pooh products. The dispute
centers on whether their rights extend to videotapes, DVDs and
computer software featuring the Milne menagerie.</TE>
<TE>   Disney's lead attorney, Daniel Petrocelli, dismisses the case as
"overreaching" and "rooted in greed."</TE>
<TE>   Lasswell resents the suggestion that she and her daughter are gold
diggers: "We're not grab, grab, grab. We're low-key people," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Back in the '50s, Lasswell marketed upscale Pooh toys and
children's clothing to department stores, helping to revive the
franchise years before Disney became involved. Lasswell believes that
she has been key to developing the Pooh brand.</TE>
<TE>   "We wouldn't be spending all these millions on lawyers all of
these years if we just wanted more money," she said. "We just want
what we're entitled to: no more, no less."</TE>
<TE>   A Boy's Stuffed Toys</TE>
<TE>   A.A. Milne was one of Britain's most popular playwrights in the
early 1920s. At one point, five of his comedies were playing at the
same time in London and New York.</TE>
<TE>   In 1920, Milne and his wife, Daphne, had their only child,
Christopher Robin Milne. They gave him stuffed toys, including a
bear, a tiger, a kangaroo and a donkey whose neck grew limp from the
boy's affection. Mother and child would play together, creating
stories and voices for the animals. Milne used this as inspiration
for a 1924 poem about a boy and his teddy bear, and he later created
the cast of "Winnie-the-Pooh," published in 1926. The book's hero was
a boy named Christopher Robin.</TE>
<TE>   The "bear of little brain" and his playmates had personalities and
enduring charm. The simple line drawings of Ernest H. Shepard brought
the characters to life. The four Pooh books have sold more than 50
million copies in 33 languages.</TE>
<TE>   Milne was smothered by Pooh's success. He fretted about being
typecast as a children's writer and grew uneasy about using his son's
name in the stories.</TE>
<TE>   One of the first to see Pooh's financial potential was Stephen
Slesinger, a young New York literary agent. Slesinger established one
of the first successful character licensing firms, acquiring rights
to Tarzan and Charlie Chan. He helped create the Red Ryder comics and
films and served as the agent for western writer Zane Grey.</TE>
<TE>   In 1930, Slesinger sailed to England to secure from Milne the
rights to sell Pooh merchandise in the U.S. and Canada. He agreed to
pay Milne a $1,000 advance, plus royalties equal to 3% of the
merchandising revenue. Two years later, Slesinger acquired the radio
and television rights at a time when TV was still just a budding idea
among a few engineers. During the Depression, Slesinger licensed Pooh
toys and dishes, an RCA record narrated by Jimmy Stewart and a board
game by Parker Bros.</TE>
<TE>   By the mid-1930s, Milne was enjoying steady royalties from his
Pooh books as well as Slesinger's merchandise, but his literary
career was in a painful slide. His novels and plays about marriage
and murder mysteries flopped. Critics suggested that he return to
children's verses.</TE>
<TE>   The very mention of Pooh often would make Milne shudder, said his
biographer, Ann Thwaite. Milne wrote 530 pages of memoirs and
mentioned the Pooh characters on just four.</TE>
<TE>   "He spent five years writing the children's books in a lifetime of
being an author--more than 50 years," Thwaite said. "He went on to
write marvelous plays and stories, and nobody seemed to be the least
bit interested in them."</TE>
<TE>   The Pooh stories also poisoned the relationship between Milne and
his son.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Milne was continually teased for his role in the Pooh
books. As an adult, he wrote that his father "had filched from me my
good name and had left me with nothing but the empty fame of being
his son."</TE>
<TE>   By the time A.A. Milne died in 1956, Christopher had rarely seen
his father for years.</TE>
<TE>   To escape his celebrity, Christopher and his wife moved to the
English countryside and opened a small bookshop. Only once did he use
his famous name--to lead a campaign against a 1980s oil- drilling
project that threatened Britain's Ashdown Forest, the real-life
setting for Pooh's Hundred Acre Wood. Christopher died in 1996, at
75.</TE>
<TE>   Disney Shows Interest</TE>
<TE>   By the 1940s, Walt Disney's studio was enjoying the success of a
string of animated films, including "Snow White and the Seven
Dwarfs," "Fantasia" and "Bambi." Disney was scouting for other
children's stories to animate and took a keen interest in Pooh.</TE>
<TE>   But Roy O. Disney, Walt's brother and the financial brains of the
company, uncovered a problem.</TE>
<TE>   "A.A. Milne has certainly completely balled up his rights in
Winnie the Pooh," he wrote in a 1947 memo. "Milne has given to
Slesinger not only rights to merchandising, but also rights for radio
and television.... If we were to attempt to do anything with Winnie
the Pooh, Slesinger is in a beautiful spot to either hold us up for
an outrageous price or sit back and reap the rewards of our
investment."</TE>
<TE>   Disney took a pass on Pooh.</TE>
<TE>   About this time, Slesinger had his eye on Shirley Basso, a
stunning showgirl 20 years his junior. In 1947, the doe-eyed brunet
was a dancer in "Hellzapoppin!" on Broadway. One of the show's
producers introduced her to Slesinger.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a little pixie, so sweet and so creative," she recalled.</TE>
<TE>   The couple flew to Las Vegas in 1948 to be married. Silent film
actress Clara Bow was the maid of honor. The newlyweds honeymooned at
Slesinger's dude ranch in Colorado and split their time between a New
York penthouse and a bungalow at the Hotel Bel-Air.</TE>
<TE>   Slesinger died in 1953 while in Los Angeles producing a TV pilot
based on the "Blondie" comic strip. He bequeathed his merchandising
and licensing business to Shirley and their 1-year-old daughter,
Patricia.</TE>
<TE>   Within a few years, the stream of royalties began to dwindle.
Shirley sold the Colorado ranch. She could no longer afford the
Manhattan penthouse.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, 'Now what do I do?' But it was right there for me,"
she said. "I decided to promote Pooh."</TE>
<TE>   She reread Milne's books and wrote down verses to use in a new
line of products. She designed Pooh postcards, stationery, wall
hangings and oversize coloring books. She fired the Long Island,
N.Y., firm that had been hand-stitching Pooh dolls for 20 years--she
thought they weren't "snuggly enough"--and hired other factories to
churn out plusher products. She visited buyers at Lord &amp; Taylor and
Bonwit Teller in New York, Marshall Field &amp; Co. in Chicago, Filene's
in Boston and Neiman Marcus in Dallas. Soon they were carrying her
Pooh line of children's apparel, pink pinafores and plastic-lined
panties with Pooh quotations.</TE>
<TE>   In 1960, Shirley got a call from Disney asking if she was
interested in selling her Pooh rights. She was excited by the idea.</TE>
<TE>   "I really went as far as I could go [with Pooh]. It was just me,
not some huge company," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She reached a royalty agreement in 1961 with Disney that gave her
4% of the revenue on worldwide Pooh sales. Soon after, Shirley said,
she met Walt Disney himself at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'Shirley, you won't be sorry,' " she recalled.</TE>
<TE>   In 1965, Disney struck a deal with Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. to sell
Pooh merchandise designed by Disney. A year later, Disney released
its first Pooh movie, with an Americanized Christopher Robin
character. Ernest Shepard, Pooh's original illustrator, pronounced
the film "a travesty."</TE>
<TE>   Shirley remarried in 1964, to cartoonist Fred Lasswell, and moved
with her husband and daughter to Tampa, Fla., where she drove a
Cadillac with a "POOH 1" license plate.</TE>
<TE>   The family's Pooh royalties rose from $13,000 in 1967 to $89,000
by 1981, their attorneys said. Pooh money helped pay for Patricia
Slesinger's college education and her art history studies abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Shirley's doubts about Disney surfaced in 1981 while she was on a
trip to Disney World in Florida. A self-described Pooh "shopaholic,"
she went on a buying spree. Later, she compared her haul with
Disney's royalty statements and saw that many of the Pooh products
were not listed. She hired a lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   By then, Disney had turned Pooh into a global brand and wanted to
streamline its character rights. Instead of having separate contracts
with the Slesinger and Milne families, Disney wanted to bring all the
deals under one contract.</TE>
<TE>   In 1983, Shirley Lasswell, Christopher Milne and representatives
of the Milne estate signed a new Disney contract. The deal trimmed
the Slesinger family's Pooh royalties from 4% to about 2% of what
they expected to be a much larger revenue pie. It called for more
detailed accounting of what was sold. Disney also paid Lasswell and
her daughter $750,000 to resolve the dispute over past royalties.</TE>
<TE>   The peace didn't last long. By the late 1980s, videotapes were the
rage, and Disney was busy putting Pooh movies and TV programs on
video. In 1987, a lawyer for the Milne estate and Lasswell compared
notes about Disney's royalty payments. In one 12-month period, Disney
paid the family more than $1 million in royalties on Pooh records and
videotapes, plus $17,000 for computer software. Then royalties for
those products suddenly dropped. For one six-month period in 1989,
according to court records, Disney paid Lasswell and her daughter
just $22.37 on software sales.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, Lasswell hired an auditor to review Disney's books and
concluded that the company had failed to keep complete sales records
for Pooh merchandise for eight years. She and her daughter sued
Disney in 1991. The next year, they received a $2.2-million
"catch-up" payment to clear up discrepancies uncovered in the audit.</TE>
<TE>   The current court case centers on whether videotapes, DVDs and
software are covered by the 1983 royalty agreement. The family
contends that Disney executives promised that videos and other
emerging technologies would be included, even if they were not
spelled out in the contract.</TE>
<TE>   Disney says the Slesingers tried in 1983 to include videos in the
deal and signed even after the company rejected the demand.</TE>
<TE>   "The case boils down to whether they are entitled to be paid for
all sorts of uses that are not covered by the contract," said
Petrocelli, the Disney attorney. "They say that when Winnie the Pooh
is dancing down Main Street and hugs a kid, they ought to get a
royalty from that. But the contract never gave them those rights."</TE>
<TE>   While the case dragged on, Pooh's popularity exploded. In 1994,
when Disney's merchandise contract with Sears, Roebuck expired, the
company launched a "Pooh initiative," rolling out new lines of Pooh
products, including wallpaper, bedsheets, snow globes and a "classic"
line of stuffed dolls and novelties that more closely resemble
Shepard's original drawings.</TE>
<TE>   Disney's annual Pooh revenue rose from $100 million to more than
$1 billion in just four years, Disney Chief Executive Michael Eisner
told an investment conference in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Shirley Lasswell and daughter Patricia also have seen their Pooh
wealth soar. It took 24 years for their total Pooh earnings to reach
$1 million. Since filing their lawsuit, they have received $65
million in royalties.</TE>
<TE>   Milne Estate Sells Rights</TE>
<TE>   Last year, seeking to tie up legal loose ends in its Pooh royalty
agreements, Disney bought all future rights from the Milne estate for
$352 million. A Milne family trust distributed the money to four
principal beneficiaries.</TE>
<TE>   A London men's club to which A.A. Milne once belonged received $88
million; the members decided to set up a scholarship fund for actors
and writers. An additional $88 million went to the British boarding
school that Milne attended as a boy. The Royal Literary Fund for
struggling writers was given $132 million. The $44 million remaining
was put in a trust named for Clare Milne, the author's granddaughter,
who has cerebral palsy; the trust pays benefits to her and other
disabled people.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the Pooh holdouts are down to Shirley Lasswell and her
daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Patricia Slesinger, 49, says the legal battle with Disney has been
emotionally draining but also educational.</TE>
<TE>   She has learned about the role her parents played in building the
Pooh merchandise empire. Slesinger, who lives in Los Angeles and runs
her own business publishing glossy shopping guides for high-end
hotels, has spent hours on EBay hunting for treasures licensed by her
father or designed by her mother.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Disney published a 176-page coffee-table book about
the history of Pooh. Slesinger was offended to find no mention of her
family.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody has done a great job" developing the Pooh brand, she
said. "But don't try to erase us out of history."</TE>

<TE>(BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>The Pooh Money Pot</TE>
<TE>Since British author A.A. Milne created the Winnie the Pooh
characters in the 1920s, the stories have continued to generate
enormous wealth:</TE>
<TE>* Book publishers Dutton Children's Books in the U.S. and Egmont in
Denmark receive proceeds from the sales of A.A. Milne's children's
classics. The books have sold more than 50 million copies worldwide.
But that income is dwarfed by the $1 billion a year that Walt Disney
Co. receives in worldwide sales of Pooh merchandise, including
toasters, breakfast cereal, computer software and videos.</TE>
<TE>* Shirley Slesinger Lasswell inherited the merchandising rights to
Pooh from her husband, a literary agent. In 1961, she sold her rights
to Disney for a share in product royalties. Lasswell and her
daughter, Patricia Slesinger, have received $66 million in Pooh
royalties. But they are suing Disney, alleging fraud and breach of
contract, and claim they have been cheated out of $200 million to
$300 million in royalties.</TE>
<TE>* Last year, the Milne estate in England received a lump-sum payment
of $352 million from Disney for future Pooh merchandise and motion
picture rights. That money was then distributed to various Milne
beneficiaries:</TE>
<TE>* $132 million to the Royal Literary Fund to help struggling writers.</TE>
<TE>* $88 million to the Westminster School, a British boarding school
Milne attended.</TE>
<TE>* $88 million to the Garrick Club, an exclusive men's club in London
that Milne joined in 1919.</TE>
<TE>* $44 million to the Clare Milne Trust to help care for the disabled
granddaughter of the author and others with disabilities.</TE>
<TE>*  And heirs of Ernest H. Shepard, original illustrator of the Pooh
books, continue to receive royalties from book sales and received an
undisclosed sum from the Disney payout.</TE>

<LD>Re "Training Rxzzzzz," by Marc Siegel, Commentary, July 1: I
graduated from medical school in 1962, but it is still fresh in my
mind--the long hours and the sleepless nights. I remember thinking,
at the time, what is being accomplished except extreme fatigue?</LD>
<LD>   Why did I have to stand there at 3 in the morning holding a
retractor in the operating room after being up for 24 hours? What was
I learning except how to sleep standing up? I could have been easily
replaced by an operating room tech working an eight-hour shift. But
that would have cost the hospital some money.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, they got tired me for next to nothing. I agree with
Siegel that more supervision and more residents are the answer.</LD>
<TE>   More residents would eliminate the need for us to work shifts such
as 36 hours on and 12 hours off, for weeks at a time.</TE>
<TE>   Since the hospitals did not eliminate these onerous shifts on
their own, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education
will do this for them. This is a first step.</TE>

<HD>Thousands Wait for Hours as Incident Delays 35 Flights</HD>
<DH>Scene: Shooting turns a holiday into chaos and bewilderment
for crowds at the airport.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Thirty-five departing flights and about 10,500 passengers were
delayed by the Independence Day shooting at Los Angeles International
Airport, acting Police Chief Martin Pomeroy said Thursday night.</LD>
<LD>   As a day of fear stretched into the hours of darkness, hundreds of
travelers still waited behind police tape in front of the Tom Bradley
International Terminal, where the bullets had flown. They stood 50
abreast, in a line stretching from the terminal doors out into the
street that runs in an oval around the airport.</LD>
<LD>   Their ranks reached for hundreds of yards. Most of them wore
expressions of anguish and impatience.</LD>
<TE>   The Fourth of July was a day of bewilderment, even chaos, at LAX,
affecting everything from the air transportation system to personal
schedules. As departing flights were canceled or postponed, nine
arriving flights destined for the Bradley terminal were diverted to
remote gates.</TE>
<TE>   Travelers were thrown into confusion the moment the shooting
started. People screamed, fell, ducked and ran. They dropped
everything, including their passports and wallets. "You must leave
now! This is not a request!" an airport police officer shouted in
English to people from abroad who could understand hardly a word.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an order! Let's go! Move!"</TE>
<TE>   The Bradley terminal was closed. The ticket counter and parts of
Delta Airlines' nearby Terminal 5 also were shut down for a time,
apparently as authorities investigated rumors of a second gunman.
Part of the terminal reopened after five hours, but only to people
with boarding passes. The line of people waiting for taxis grew to be
two terminals long. Thirty-five flights were delayed, and some
passengers waited up to eight hours.</TE>
<TE>   At 4:15 p.m., Mayor James K. Hahn declared, perhaps with an excess
of optimism: "The airport is resuming normal operations." Airport and
airline officials said all remnants of confusion would be over by
today. Hahn encouraged the public to continue with flight plans.
"There is no reason," he said, "for the traveling public to shy away
from air travel."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn took the opportunity to remind interviewers of his
$9.6-billion plan to improve LAX security. But neither the mayor nor
other transportation officials could say that they had solved the
question of how to prevent a shooting just inside a terminal's front
door.</TE>
<TE>   Late into the night Thursday, portions of the Bradley terminal
seemed anything but normal. Frustrated travelers milled around,
carrying bags, guitar cases and surfboards. Mothers hunted for snack
shops where they could buy their crying children something to drink
or eat.</TE>
<TE>   About a third of the stranded passengers had been on connecting
fights, and many had no notion how to reach where they were going.
But officials from domestic airlines said that because the terminal
closure primarily involved international flights, the incident had
little impact on other U.S. airports.</TE>
<TE>   Yifat Beinglass, 26, said she was going to Tel Aviv on El Al, the
airline whose ticket counter was the scene of the shooting. She
ducked into a nearby kitchen when the gunfire started. "I thought it
was fireworks at first," she said.</TE>
<TE>   At 8 p.m., she was still trying to get onto a flight, which she
had heard was rescheduled for 2 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Sherri Nelson of Ft. Riley, Kan., had been headed for Mexico City
with her children, ages 1 1/2 and 8, to attend her mother's funeral.
She said the kids were hungry. "There's nothing to eat, and to get to
the restaurants, you have to have a boarding pass."</TE>
<TE>   She looked ruefully at her toddler, who had fallen asleep in the
stroller. In a tone of understatement, Nelson said: "He got a little
cranky this afternoon."</TE>
<TE>   Worse, she said, her flight was supposed to have left at 4 p.m.,
and now she had no idea when it would depart.</TE>
<TE>   Marvin Lee, 22, was on his way from New Zealand to Brazil. He had
been standing at the Varig ticket desk when he heard what seemed like
five or six shots. Everyone turned in the direction of the shooting
and hit the floor, he said. Then people began to get up. Lee saw
people dashing toward him. He said everyone hit the floor again.</TE>
<TE>   "I was petrified," Lee aid. "I've never heard a gun before in my
life. We don't even have guns in New Zealand."</TE>
<TE>   He hid behind the ticket counter until the police ordered him to
leave the terminal. Then he tried to call his mother, but he could
not get through. So, Lee said, he passed the time reading a book
about vampires.</TE>
<TE>   Exhausted travelers mobbed one of the Bradley snack shops. They
bought every bag of corn chips and beef jerky they could find. Many
did not wait to pay for them before they ripped them open and began
eating.</TE>
<TE>   Connie Ariaga said she had left Atlanta the day before, bound for
Manila. She was eating an early lunch when it was interrupted by the
gunfire. Ariaga and her 4-year-old son dropped their food and hid
behind a trash can.</TE>
<TE>   Now the youngster sat in a stroller outside the snack shop,
opening a bag of jelly beans. "I'm starving, and we're eating junk
food," his mother said. "But at least this store was open."</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, a pair of college students, Miles Leach and Neill
Broderick from Kentucky, sprawled on the floor, awaiting a Qantas
flight to New Zealand for study abroad.</TE>
<TE>   They had been there since 8 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   "I just talked to the folks back home who were watching this on
TV," Leach said. "We wanted to let them know we were OK."</TE>
<TE>   "There were a lot of scared friends and family," Broderick said.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone at the terminal was a passenger.</TE>
<TE>   Melissa Knieling, 18, of Long Beach was standing on the steps
outside, raising money for battered women when she heard the shots.</TE>
<TE>   At first, she said, she was not alarmed. But "when I heard the
sirens, I started panicking."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very worried," she said, hours afterward. "My life is in
danger along with every other body in this airport.</TE>
<TE>   "They said they heightened security after 9/11. If people lose
their lives, then this isn't heightened security. There is not enough
security at airports.</TE>
<TE>   "If there was, people wouldn't get through with guns and knives."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Xu, 35, a businessman from China, was having drinks at a
McDonald's on the second floor when the shooting started.</TE>
<TE>   He ran to an elevator, but didn't see anyone who looked dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm frightened," he said nonetheless. "I just want to go home
immediately."</TE>
<TE>   Another businessman, May Park, 40, originally from Seoul, who now
lives in Miami, had arrived in Los Angeles for a job transfer.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't see anything, but I heard a gun shoot three times,"
Park said. "There was panic and screaming.... Everyone was down and
screaming."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Whittington of Austin, Texas, agreed. He had just stepped
out of a restroom. "People were running from the building," he said.
"My mother was on the other side."</TE>
<TE>   When the shooting stopped, he said, a security guard was the only
person standing. Whittington went and found his mother.</TE>
<TE>   Albert Montes, 39, of Carson said he and his wife were dropping
off her mother, Edi Paulus, for a return flight to Brazil after her
visit to see her granddaughter for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   By the fourth shot, Montes said, they realized the danger, dropped
to the floor and hid behind some luggage. "They were slow, like one,
two, three, four, five.... People started ducking. People just
started to run, just trying to get out of there.</TE>
<TE>   "I just told [my wife and mother-in-law] to duck down and be
calm."</TE>
<TE>   He was thankful that they had left the baby at home.</TE>
<TE>   Kay Bernstein, 47, of Sherman Oaks was supposed to pick up a
17-year-old exchange student from Germany. By 1:30 p.m., Bernstein
still had not found the girl and could not confirm whether her flight
had even landed.</TE>
<TE>   Outside a newsstand, Ciara Parker, 19, of San Diego stood in line,
munching on a super-sized bag of chips and clutching a bottle of
water.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a big mistake," she said, "to book tickets on the Fourth
of July."</TE>

<HD>Gunman Kills Two at LAX</HD>
<DH>FBI Identifies Shooter as Egyptian-Born Resident of Irvine</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS and MITCHELL LANDSBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite stepped-up security at Los Angeles International Airport, an
Egyptian-born man pulled a gun and opened fire Thursday at a busy
ticket counter of El Al Israel Airlines, killing two people and
wounding several others before an airline guard shot him dead,
authorities said. The attack delayed thousands of passengers and
closed the airport's international terminal for hours.</LD>
<LD>   Although Israeli officials said they believed the shooting was an
act of terrorism, U.S. authorities said it appeared to be an isolated
incident.</LD>
<LD>   FBI officials said the shooter had two driver's licenses, one
identifying him as Hesham Mohamed Hadayet and the other as Hesham
Mohamed Ali. He was 41, entered the country in 1992 and was a
resident of Irvine. One of the licenses listed his birth date as the
Fourth of July.</LD>
<TE>   When police arrived at the man's apartment, they found a note on
the door saying, "Read the Koran."</TE>
<TE>   Passengers and others who witnessed the attack said the gunman
appeared to grow agitated while talking to a ticket agent at the El
Al counter. He pulled out a gun and shot her, then began firing at
people in line, witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   "There were people laying all over the floor. There was blood,"
said Arie Golan, who joined a security guard in wrestling the man to
the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said the security guard shot the man once at close range
after the attacker had been disarmed and was being held on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting occurred at an airport that has been on high alert
for a terrorist attack, on a holiday when the entire nation was
warned to be on the lookout, and at the counter of an airline
generally considered to have the best security in the world.</TE>
<TE>   The gunfire, which began just before 11:30 a.m., forced the
evacuation of the Tom Bradley International Terminal, delaying 35
outbound flights and 10,500 passengers. Delays stretched up to eight
hours. The south section of the terminal reopened at 4:30 p.m., but
the rest remained closed while the FBI completed its investigation of
the shooting scene.</TE>
<TE>   Rethinking Security</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn, who unveiled a $9.6-billion
reconstruction plan for LAX this week, said he plans to reassess
airport security. He said security now focuses on preventing
passengers from getting on a plane with weapons, not screening people
at ticket counters.</TE>
<TE>   "Our airport security is much like airport security around the
world," Hahn said. "The perimeter you establish for protection is
just outside the area where the airplanes are and the gates. Parking
lots, lobbies, ticketing areas are not past those security
points--they're before them."</TE>
<TE>   An FBI official in Los Angeles, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said the gunman carried no identification but
investigators were able to identify him through other means.
Authorities also said they had found Hadayet's vehicle in an airport
parking garage.</TE>
<TE>   The dead bystanders were Israeli emigre Jacob Aminov, 46, a
diamond importer who lived in North Hollywood, and a woman the
Israeli Consulate identified as Vicky Chen, a 20-year-old Israeli
working for a company under contract with El Al.</TE>
<TE>   Among those injured, Sarah Phillips, 61, a Canadian, was shot in
the foot and reported in stable condition at Centinela Medical
Center, police said. The others were treated for heart palpitations
and other stress-related ailments and released, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Aminov was taken to King-Drew Medical Center, where grief-stricken
family members gathered. They described Aminov as a hard-working,
devoutly religious man, and said he was seeing friends off at the
airport when he was shot. He was hit at least once in the chest,
doctors said.</TE>
<TE>   Aminov was in cardiac arrest when he arrived by ambulance at the
hospital shortly after noon, said Dr. Jean-Claude Henry. Doctors
worked on him for nearly an hour before declaring him dead, Henry
said.</TE>
<TE>   Aminov's wife, who is pregnant with the couple's sixth child, was
at the hospital when she learned her husband could not be saved. By
coincidence, Aminov was a friend and neighbor of Golan, the man who
helped subdue the shooter. Golan, 54, said he spotted Aminov in the
check-in line, walked over to say hello, and then was on his way
outside to smoke a cigarette when the shooting began.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of people watched the attack unfold as they stood in line
at El Al and surrounding airline counters in the crowded terminal.</TE>
<TE>   Guillermo Fergoza was with his wife, Yolanda, about 25 feet away
when he noticed a man talking to an agent at the El Al counter. "They
started arguing at the counter," said Fergoza, who was at the airport
to put his son on a flight. "He stepped back and pulled the gun out
of his waistband. A lot of people started falling to the floor."</TE>
<TE>   Two brothers, Paul and David Parkus, were standing in line at a
nearby Singapore Airlines ticket counter.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard 'pop, pop, pop!' and spun around and saw this guy
shooting away," said Paul Parkus, a 38-year-old Los Angeles
photographer. "The El Al guys came over the top of the counter" and
tackled the shooter, they said.</TE>
<TE>   David Parkus, 39, a trauma surgeon from Beaumont, Texas, said he
ran to the ticket counter and helped the guards subdue the gunman,
whom he described as weighing 200 to 250 pounds. The man stabbed at
least one of the security guards, Parkus said.</TE>
<TE>   Golan, a 54-year-old veteran of the Israeli army who was on his
way to visit his grandchildren in Israel, described a similar scene,
differing on some details.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard a lot of shots, maybe 15 or 20. It was very quick. I
heard the shots, turned, and I saw the security guard jump over the
rope," he said. As the guard began grappling with the shooter, Golan
said, he dashed over to help.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted to stop him," he said. "I jumped on him. He still
had the gun in his hand. It was a small gun, maybe a .22. We wrestled
him to the ground."</TE>
<TE>   Golan said the shooter lost his grip on the gun, which fell and
skittered out of reach across the floor. According to witnesses, as
the two men struggled to hold down the shooter, who was lying on his
back, another El Al security guard ran over, stood over the man and
shot him once in the abdomen.</TE>
<TE>   Golan recounted his role as he sat on a curb outside the terminal,
his clothes splattered with dime-size drops of blood, a cigarette
held in a trembling hand.</TE>
<TE>   He described the shooter as powerfully built, about 5-foot-10, his
hair tinged with gray.</TE>
<TE>   FBI spokesman Matt McLaughlin said the man carried .45-caliber and
9mm handguns, as well as a six-inch knife. A law enforcement source
said the gunman also carried additional ammunition clips.</TE>
<TE>   At the man's apartment in Irvine, FBI, LAPD, immigration officers
and Irvine police had set up a cordon and were preparing to search
the home late Thursday. Police said the man's wife and two elementary
school-age sons were not home when they arrived and their whereabouts
were unknown.</TE>
<TE>   A neighbor, who would not give his name, said that his wife and
the gunman's wife had volunteered together at a local elementary
school. "They seemed like nice people. It's all pretty shocking to
us," the man said. Neighbors said the man worked for a limousine
service and was seldom seen outside the apartment except when he
stepped out to smoke.</TE>
<TE>   During a 30-minute news conference Thursday afternoon, authorities
said they believed the shooting was an isolated incident. Still, an
FBI official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said later that
authorities had not ruled out terrorism as a motive.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's consul general in Los Angeles, Yuval Rotem, said he did
not believe it was random.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like a terrorist attack and it looks like a terrorist
attack," he said, based in part on past airport killings. Rotem cited
a 1985 attack at the Rome airport that killed 17 people, as well as
incidents in Paris, London and other European cities.</TE>
<TE>   The gunman did not say anything while he was shooting, Rotem said.
But he added, "It was very obvious. He was trying to target and gun
down as many Israelis as he can. It may turn out to be one more
attack against Israel."</TE>
<TE>   Rotem credited Haim Sapir, the chief of El Al security, with
saving lives. He said Sapir was stabbed and shot before shooting the
man.</TE>
<TE>   Guard 'a Hero'</TE>
<TE>   "He's a hero," Rotem said. "He and his colleagues were able to
save many passengers."</TE>
<TE>   Sapir, believed to be in his early 40s, was treated at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   Rotem said the attack would not interfere with El Al's daily
operations.</TE>
<TE>   "Our answer to terrorism is to be as normal as we can even if it's
an abnormal situation,' he said.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI took charge of the investigation, with the Los Angeles
Police Department acting as an assisting agency.</TE>
<TE>   Acting LAPD Chief Martin Pomeroy said additional police would be
deployed at the airport, beginning today. He urged people to continue
with holiday celebrations, and Hahn encouraged the public to continue
flying.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no reason for the traveling public to shy away from air
travel," the mayor said.</TE>
<TE>   Most flights in and out of the airport continued to operate
normally throughout the day, which launched a four-day weekend for
many people. During the time that the Bradley terminal was closed,
passengers waited outside on the lawn, reading books on benches,
standing on top of parking structures and watching the terminal.</TE>
<TE>   El Al, the Israeli national air carrier, prides itself on having
the industry's most stringent security. It places undercover armed
guards on every flight, much of its airport ground staff is also
armed and cockpits are reinforced to prevent unauthorized entry.
Israel noted that its airliners have not fallen victim to air piracy
for more than two decades.</TE>
<TE>   El Al points to its rigorous screening as its best defense. From
the moment a traveler purchases a ticket for an El Al flight, the
person's name and data are sent to Israeli intelligence. Once a
passenger reports to an airport, he or she is subject to intensive
questioning.</TE>
<TE>   It varies from airport to airport, but El Al officials
occasionally call the traveler's contacts in Israel to verify
information.</TE>
<TE>   Questioning is often intrusive and searches can be extremely
thorough, to the point of shaking each piece of underwear in a
suitcase and unscrewing every bottle of makeup or shampoo.</TE>

<DH>Recreation: The king of four-wheeler trails, the Rubicon,
is so popular that its future is at risk.</DH>

<AU>RONE TEMPEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LOON LAKE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>To Shad Sarti, there is no more fitting celebration of American
freedom than riding his customized 625-horsepower Toyota monster
truck on the Rubicon Trail.</LD>
<LD>   A Caltrans highway line striper from Redding, Sarti, 29, was here
at the High Sierra trail head for his ninth consecutive Fourth of
July weekend.</LD>
<LD>   "There is nothing more American than four-wheeling," said Sarti,
"and nowhere more American than the Rubicon."</LD>
<TE>   The Halloween death mask was already in place on the spare-tire
rack. Sarti's wife Renee, 23, unfurled the Confederate flag to fly
above the cab. When Renee stripped to her swimsuit, a checklist
posted on the back of Sarti's truck trailer was complete: "Beer. Bad
Ass Trucks. American Pride. Women Wearing Bikinis."</TE>
<TE>   To some, the Independence Day weekend may mean tall ships in
Boston Harbor, a parade on Main Street or fireworks over a darkened
baseball diamond. But the Sartis and hundreds of others find the
essence of America with an annual pilgrimage to one of the nation's
most famous four-wheel trails.</TE>
<TE>   "This is Christmas in the summer for four-wheelers," said Will
Coelho, 22, who was with friends from Walnut Creek. "You can be as
loud as you want here and drink as much as you want."</TE>
<TE>   The rugged dirt path from the western Sierra Nevada to Lake Tahoe
is holy ground for the millions of Americans who enjoy off-road
driving. By day's end Sunday, 2,000 to 3,000 people are expected to
have lumbered and careened on some part of the 22-mile pathway that
has earned a "most difficult" Class-10 rating from the expanding
off-road community.</TE>
<TE>   "The Rubicon is the crown jewel of off-roading," said Del
Albright, a retired California Forestry Department firefighter. He
holds the title "trail boss" for the Friends of the Rubicon, a
recently mustered organization dedicated to keeping the mountain
trail open for four-wheelers, motorcycles, mountain bikes and
equestrians.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the oldest and hardest continuous four-wheel-drive trail
in the world," said Dan Mainwaring of Georgetown, Calif., president
of Jeepers Jamboree, which this year celebrates its 50th anniversary
as host of an annual Rubicon trail rally. "Most people feel that if
you haven't done the Rubicon, you haven't four-wheeled."</TE>
<TE>   In 1953, the former Indian foot trail and stagecoach route was the
setting for the country's first organized four-wheel-drive event.
Flat granite and boulder-strewn sluices provide a dream venue for
those who love to test machine against nature.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Army's super-secret Delta Force trained here before
leaving for Afghanistan. Chrysler Corp. sponsors several annual
promotional excursions for Jeeps on the trail. The company recently
announced a 2003 Rubicon model of its Jeep Wrangler. The Rubicon's
renown has never been greater. But its problems have become so
obvious that they are acknowledged not just by environmentalists, but
even by mainstream off-road organizations. Like many of America's
favorite off-road venues, the Rubicon is in danger of being loved to
death.</TE>
<TE>   Pressure from the estimated 70,000 off-roaders who make the
pilgrimage here each summer is taking a toll. The delicate mile-high
terrain is scarred from renegade drivers who leave the main trail.
Human waste fouls the path. And erosion has become so extreme that a
regional water agency last year temporarily banned use of the trail
to protect runoff bound for Lake Tahoe.</TE>
<TE>   The Rubicon symbolizes the predicament faced by many California
forest areas under increasing pressure from a recreation-crazed
populace. According to the state Department of Parks and Recreation,
3.5 million Californians, representing 14% of all households,
participate in some form of motorized off-road activity.</TE>
<TE>   Extreme sports television marketing urges Americans to confront
nature rather than passively enjoy it: A lake is not simply a lake;
it is a water challenge. A stream is not something in which to
languidly dangle a toe; it is a barrier, it is to be forded.</TE>
<TE>   Said Daphne Greene, head of the state Off-Highway Motor Vehicle
Recreation Commission: "It is extremely difficult to educate the
off-road community when you turn on the TV and you see a vehicle
crashing through the air and slamming through meadows and rivers."</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is that more trails will be shut down," said Greene,
a Gov. Gray Davis appointee who owns her own San Rafael off-road
consulting company, "because people think this kind of behavior is
acceptable."</TE>
<TE>   Rubicon veterans in the Sierra foothills are perplexed about how
to go about saving the famous trail while keeping it open for public
use.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of the problem is that the Rubicon is so popular that on
some weekends it gets overloaded," said Mark Smith, a 75-year-old
former lumberjack, who is considered one of the fathers of American
off-roading.</TE>
<TE>   After helping start the first Jeepers Jamboree in 1953 as part of
a Georgetown Chamber of Commerce campaign to attract tourists to the
Sierra foothill community, Smith has gone on to build a sizable
business as an off-road consultant to Chrysler's Jeep division, the
U.S. military and others.</TE>
<TE>   Smith led an effort 15 years ago to get the trail declared an
"unmaintained county road" in hopes that it would help protect it
against environmental restrictions. He strongly defends continued use
of the Rubicon and opposes any type of permit system that would
restrict access to off-roaders.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one trail they can't take away from us," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   But like other old-timers, Smith said he is concerned by a new
breed of renegade off-roaders who come to the trail intent on
destruction. They stage "bash-athons," flinging their vehicles into
as many obstacles as possible, and "stacking" events--piling vehicles
one on top of another. On Thursday, despite signs warning drivers
away from wetlands, deep tire grooves were obvious in several marshy
lakeshore areas.</TE>
<TE>   "The last four years, there have been a lot of these people coming
here, abusing our trail," agreed Mainwaring, who replaced Smith as
president of Jeepers' Jamboree. "Law enforcement has to get tougher."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the growing lawlessness that includes use of
firearms and excessive drinking, the Rubicon also faces considerable
sanitation and environmental challenges. The most difficult may be
what to do about the estimated 75,000 pounds of human waste produced
during the course of a single summer. Other than encouraging people
to pack their waste out with them, no solution has been offered. The
terrain is too rocky to dig effective latrines and too remote to
maintain portable toilets.</TE>
<TE>   Erosion also poses a potential problem, particularly on the Lake
Tahoe side of the trail.</TE>
<TE>   After complaints that sediment from the trail was spewing into
Lake Tahoe, a regional water board issued a violation notice to
Placer County in December 2000. But the notice was withdrawn a year
later after an extraordinary volunteer effort in which trail true
believers turned out en masse to rebuild a portion of the Rubicon to
prevent sediment from spilling into a feeder creek.</TE>
<TE>   Albright, the "trail boss," and another crew of volunteers were on
the trail again this week, ahead of the July 4 onslaught. They
drained mudholes and put up barriers to block bypasses used by some
renegade drivers.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the trail's history and the strong community support to
keep it maintained, the Rubicon has never been a cause celebre for
environmentalists the way, for example, the now-banned Barstow-to-Las
Vegas desert race was a decade ago. When three environmental groups
filed a federal lawsuit in February against the El Dorado National
Forest, demanding that off-road trails be clearly marked, they were
careful to point out that they were not targeting the Rubicon.</TE>
<TE>   "At least on the Rubicon, people have acknowledged the problems
and are trying to solve them," said Karen Schambach, director of the
Center for Sierra Nevada Conservation and one of the plaintiffs in
the suit. "I'd be happy if the other trails got as much attention."</TE>
<TE>   David Widell, the governor's appointee who heads the state
Off-Highway Motor Vehicle Recreation Division, contends that the
Rubicon is too powerful a cultural and political icon for a direct
confrontation between off-roaders and environmentalists.</TE>
<TE>   "The Rubicon," Widell said, "isn't just another designated trail.
This is the 1,000-pound gorilla. Mix that with Lake Tahoe and you
have a complicated political situation. The fortunate part is that,
with something this big, it forces people to deal with the issue at a
higher level of thought, rather than just shutting it down."</TE>
<TE>   The recent El Dorado lawsuit and the water board action were
wake-up calls for California off-road enthusiasts, many of whom
already felt themselves under siege. Over the last 18 months,
off-road closures have hit a trail at Surprise Canyon, near Death
Valley National Park, and at the Imperial Sand Dunes Recreational
Area east of Brawley.</TE>
<TE>   The Surprise Canyon closure was ordered when the U.S. Interior
Department determined that off-road vehicle use was damaging habitat,
including that of the endangered Mojave desert tortoise.</TE>
<TE>   At the Imperial dunes north of the Mexican border, the shutdown of
an area popular with dune buggy enthusiasts was designed to protect
Peirson's milk vetch, an endangered plant that grows only in the
Imperial Valley desert.</TE>
<TE>   "When Surprise Canyon shut down," Greene said, "I thought, 'Oh,
God! The Rubicon could be next.' "</TE>
<TE>   But, at least for now, the Rubicon roars on.</TE>
<TE>   By late Thursday morning, several dozen spectators had already
gathered at a famously difficult part of the Rubicon Trail called
Little Sluice Box. Some sat in lawn chairs drinking beer and shouting
encouragement and criticism as Tim Williamson of Turlock bent the
front drive shaft of his new Jeep Wrangler.</TE>
<TE>   Such a blow might be devastating to many people, but Williamson
accepted it with a shrug.</TE>
<TE>   "The truck just slipped and landed flat on my dern drive shaft,"
said Williamson, 30, whose 4-year-old son was in the cab with him at
the time.</TE>
<TE>   The boy also seemed unfazed. In fact, he had the look of a future
off-roader himself.</TE>
<TE>   "Heck, that boy's first word was 'twisted' (an off-road term),"
said his father. "All he plays with at home are monster trucks that
he drives over rocks and ramps."</TE>

<LD>After a year of mourning, Nepal's King Gyanendra has moved into the
palace where his elder brother was assassinated in a royal family
massacre in June 2001, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The king, Queen Komal and their daughter, Princess Prerana, moved
into the Narayanhiti Palace, the traditional home of the Shah dynasty
rulers. The home is guarded by more than 3,000 soldiers of the Royal
Nepalese Army.</LD>
<LD>   Previously, Gyanendra and his family lived in their mansion in the
capital, Katmandu, where Crown Prince Paras will continue to live.</LD>

<LD>German police arrested a suspected member of an Algerian militant

<LD>   The 57-year-old man, an alleged member of the Armed Islamic Group,

<LD>Augusto Pinochet resigned as senator-for-life and formally ended his
political career, days after Chile's highest court ruled that the
former dictator was mentally unfit to stand trial on charges of
ordering political killings.</LD>
<LD>   Chief government spokesman Heraldo Munoz called the resignation
"an expected, logical and necessary decision," and supporters and
opponents alike welcomed the move.</LD>
<LD>   A civilian government report estimated that 3,200 people were

<HD>23 on Cargo Plane Die in Central Africa Crash</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BANGUI, Central African Republic</DL>
<LD>A Boeing 707 crashed in a sparsely populated area of this capital
city Thursday, killing 23 people and injuring two others aboard,
witnesses and officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The jet was carrying passengers along with a load of onions and
garlic from N'Djamena in Chad to Brazzaville in the Republic of Congo
when it tried to land here because of technical problems, said
officials at the regional air authority, Asecna.</LD>
<LD>   It crashed about 11:15 a.m. two miles short of the runway at
Bangui's international airport in clear weather, Asecna said.</LD>
<TE>   Residents rushed to the scene, and some tried to carry off the
food, witnesses said. The crowd gave way when soldiers, firefighters
and presidential guards arrived and began searching the debris.</TE>
<TE>   The Central African Republic, a former French colony, is one of
the world's poorest countries.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Wesio, an Asecna official in Bangui, said the plane was
carrying 17 Chadian passengers and eight crew members. He said 23
people had been killed and that two survivors were hospitalized. By
evening, 22 bodies had been recovered. There was no immediate word on
whether anyone on the ground had been hurt.</TE>
<TE>   Officials had no comment on the cause of the crash.</TE>
<TE>   The plane exploded when it came down in the Guitangola
neighborhood, scattering wreckage and causing the roof of an empty
house to collapse, witnesses said. Bodies lay in the mud amid bags of
vegetables and pieces of the plane.</TE>
<TE>   "I was afraid when I saw the plane coming down, and all of a
sudden I heard a loud noise, and some parts of the aircraft flew into
the air and fell in the mud," said a woman on a nearby farm who gave
her name only as Zara.</TE>
<TE>   The plane was operating under the license of Prestige Airlines,
which is based in the Republic of Congo. Jean Francois, Prestige's
head of operations in Brazzaville, confirmed that a company plane had
crashed but had no details. He said the airline was sending a team of
inspectors to the scene.</TE>

<DL>BAGRAM, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>The order came from the top: "Uncle Sam Says Have Fun," read the
posters plastered around U.S. military headquarters in Afghanistan on
the Fourth of July.</LD>
<LD>   The troops did their best, using a helicopter pad as a basketball
court and trading ration packs for T-bone steaks flown in for
celebrations.</LD>
<LD>   But as many of the 7,000 U.S. Special Forces and other troops at
Bagram air base made what they could of July 4 celebrations in sparse
surroundings far from home, security on the perimeter was on high
alert for possible terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   No trouble was reported.</TE>
<TE>   Red-white-and-blue flags brightened the rows of green, dusty tents
that house the troops, who are in Afghanistan to hunt down the
remnants of Al Qaeda and the Taliban and help restore the country to
peace after 23 years of war.</TE>

<HD>Swiss Open Probe Into Collision as Relatives Mourn at Crash
Site</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UEBERLINGEN, Germany</DL>
<LD>As relatives of victims in a deadly collision between a chartered
Russian airliner and a DHL cargo jet arrived here to honor the dead,
Swiss prosecutors announced Thursday that they have launched a
criminal investigation into the accident.</LD>
<LD>   German prosecutors had earlier begun a probe into the Monday night
tragedy, which killed 71 people, including 45 children from Russia. A
key issue is whether negligence by Swiss air traffic controllers may
have been responsible for the crash.</LD>
<LD>   The probe will investigate the chain of events and clarify whether
Swiss air traffic controllers "made errors for which they could be
held criminally liable," said Christoph Naef, a Swiss prosecutor.</LD>
<TE>   Swiss controllers gave the Russian Tupolev-154 even less warning
time of the impending collision than previously claimed--just 44
seconds, Peter Schlegel, head of Germany's federal air accident
investigation office, said Thursday. "Descending of one of the planes
should have started at least 90 seconds before the crossing point,"
he said, so the first order to descend came with less than half the
time required for safety.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives of the Russian victims attended a memorial ceremony
Thursday in Ueberlingen, a lakeside resort town in southwestern
Germany near the crash site. They then visited a field where they saw
the charred tail of the Russian plane. Grieving amid the wreckage,
they laid wreaths and flowers. Some plucked stalks of grain or
scooped up handfuls of earth to have something in memory of the site.</TE>
<TE>   The children were mainly from the political elite of the Bashkir
republic, an oil-rich, predominantly Muslim region of Russia, and
were headed for a beach vacation in Spain. Rescue workers had found
the bodies of 68 victims, including the two on board the DHL Airways
Boeing 757 jet, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Schaeuble, a local official, told a news conference that
the bodies were so badly damaged, psychologists had advised against
allowing parents to see them.</TE>
<TE>   Swiss air traffic control Tuesday was forced to revise its version
of how much warning the Russian pilot had that he was on a collision
course. It initially said that the Bashkirian Airlines jet had been
given nearly two minutes' notice and that the pilot did not begin
descending to avoid the cargo jet until after receiving a third
request. The Swiss revised their account after the German
investigative agency estimated the time at 50 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   The Russian plane started to descend 30 seconds before the
collision, after a second order was issued, Schlegel said. He also
said Thursday that 14 seconds before the crash, flight control
received the message "TCAS descend," but that "it is not clear from
which plane this message came."</TE>
<TE>   The phrase refers to the modern collision-avoidance system, called
TCAS, that both planes had on board. The devices normally should have
been able to communicate with each other, but it is unclear whether
both were turned on. Investigators believe that the message was
probably from the cargo jet, Schlegel said.</TE>
<TE>   The planes collided while both were descending sharply in an
effort to avoid each other. The cargo plane's descent apparently was
in response to the on-board collision-avoidance system.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the collision, a single flight operator was
handling five airplanes on two screens at Zurich airport in
Switzerland, including the two that collided. This is not an unusual
burden, Schlegel said. Swiss traffic control was in charge of the
flights because the planes were in the approach area to the Zurich
airport.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Thiel, head of the German air accident investigation agency's
lab in Braunschweig, where flight recorders from both planes were
taken, said Thursday that specialists hadn't yet retrieved
information from them. The recorders were badly damaged, which would
cause some delay, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Russian plane was headed from Moscow to Barcelona, Spain, and
the cargo plane was en route to Brussels from Bahrain, after a
stopover in Bergamo, Italy.</TE>
<TE>   German Transport Minister Kurt Bodewig said Thursday that a
Europe-wide system of air traffic control must be established to
replace the current fragmented system based on individual countries.</TE>
<TE>   "The Balkanization must be replaced by a common system," he said.
"We need a single European airspace. Air transport is international,
and so we must deal with it on a large scale."</TE>
<TE>   Germany is a strong backer of European Union plans to introduce
common surveillance of European airspace by 2004, but critics of the
proposal argue that it could cause job losses and safety risks.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters say the plan would bring greater safety by
consolidating control at a smaller number of centers, requiring
less-frequent transfers of responsibility from one set of controllers
to another. German air traffic control turned over the flight paths
of the Russian jet and the cargo plane to Swiss controllers shortly
before the accident.</TE>

<HD>N. Ireland Talks End on Note of Optimism</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: The British and Irish premiers say the parties
to the 1998 peace agreement remain committed to it despite recent
street violence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>LONDON -- Despite recent street violence in Northern Ireland, the
parties to the 1998 Good Friday peace deal remain totally committed
to it, the prime ministers of Britain and Ireland said Thursday after
talks in Belfast.</LD>
<LD>   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern and his British counterpart,
Tony Blair, met the parties to the 1998 agreement in hopes of
breathing life back into the peace process, after Protestant calls
for the British leader to take firm action to halt violence in the
troubled province.</LD>
<LD>   But if Protestant unionists wanted concrete measures, what they
got were reassuring words and a promise to spell out in coming weeks
how the British government will make it clear that it will not
tolerate violence.</LD>
<TE>   "There is no acceptable or tolerable level of violence," Blair
said in a joint news conference with Ahern. "This process is one in
which violence has to be shunned completely, not partially."</TE>
<TE>   Blair said he had no doubt that the nationalist party Sinn Fein
remains committed to the peace process. But he also said unionists
think the British and Irish governments believe that some violence is
acceptable, adding that steps must be taken to reassure them this is
not so.</TE>
<TE>   He promised to announce steps by the end of this month to restore
confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "For all the difficulties and how many times we have been there
with these difficulties, this is an agreement that still has
delivered a tremendous amount to the people of Northern Ireland,"
Blair said.</TE>
<TE>   Security was tight for the meeting, held at the request of David
Trimble, first minister in Northern Ireland's power-sharing
government and the leader of the Ulster Unionists. His Protestant
party has warned that the peace agreement faces a crisis after recent
outbreaks of sectarian violence.</TE>
<TE>   "They've got to re-create this confidence and do it quick,"
Trimble said after the talks. If there is no serious progress by
Blair's government this month, "there is going to be a very serious
problem indeed."</TE>
<TE>   Tensions have risen in recent weeks with Protestant allegations
that the Irish Republican Army has tested new weapons in Colombia and
is planning new attacks, claims that the IRA denies.</TE>
<TE>   The 1998 peace deal spawned the power-sharing government in
Northern Ireland, but Trimble has warned the Blair government that it
must take tough action to stop violence. Last month he threatened to
resign over the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Ahern said there would be difficulties in the peace process from
time to time but that these could be overcome. "There was, I think, a
huge effort by everybody to walk with each other to try to
de-escalate the tensions and the difficulties for the short term and
the long term in these communities that are suffering so much,
whatever background or whatever tradition people come from," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's talks came amid Northern Ireland's "Orange marching
season," traditionally a time of increased tensions when pro-British
Protestants stage marches to mark Protestant victories over Roman
Catholics centuries ago.</TE>
<TE>   The most contentious of the marches--in Portadown, southwest of
Belfast, the provincial capital--is due Sunday, when members of the
Protestant Orange Order say they will defy a ban and parade through a
Catholic neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   The march has been banned over the past five years but held
nonetheless. A hefty police and army presence and barbed-wire
barricades have prevented violence in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Violence broke out Saturday in west Belfast when 300 Catholic
nationalists rioted after a parade by the Orangemen crossed the edge
of a nationalist neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the tensions in Northern Ireland are reports that an IRA
splinter group opposed to the peace process, known as the Real IRA,
has been plotting to assassinate a top unionist politician or other
figure involved in the peace process.</TE>

<HD>Democracy Fans in Tonga See No Reason to Revel</HD>
<DH>South Pacific: Islands' 84-year-old king, revered by many,
refuses to share power and stifles dissent.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>NUKU'ALOFA, Tonga--King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV celebrated his 84th
birthday Thursday with a military parade and a lavish feast, but
without the gift that would make many Tongans happy--democracy.</LD>
<LD>   The all-powerful king, who has ruled this small Polynesian nation
since 1965, has refused to bow to the demands of democracy advocates
and share power with an elected parliament.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, critics say, royal family members have enriched
themselves through special deals with the government, banking many
millions of dollars overseas while most of the island nation's people
live in poverty as subsistence farmers.</LD>
<TE>   "He is the world's last absolute monarch," asserted Lopeti
Senituli of the Tonga Human Rights and Democracy Movement. "Tonga is
the last of the dinosaurs. We hope the change can happen peacefully."</TE>
<TE>   Tupou is revered by many of his people as a benevolent and kindly
sovereign. But as Tonga's economic ties to the outside world have
grown over the last decade, so has the pressure to share power.</TE>
<TE>   "The royals and the nobles make up less than 1% of the population,
but they control 99% of the resources," businesswoman Mel Deagan said
as the king's parade went past her newly opened Internet cafe. "A lot
of people say it's time for democracy."</TE>
<TE>   Under Tonga's 127-year-old constitution, nine members of the
country's 30-member parliament are elected by the public.
Pro-democracy candidates have consistently won since the early 1990s,
but they are regularly outvoted in parliament by the 21 members
selected by the king and Tonga's handful of noble families.</TE>
<TE>   Should the king ever need it, he has veto power over any act of
parliament. He also appoints all Cabinet ministers. For prime
minister, he chose the youngest of his three sons, Prince Ulukalala
Lavaka Ata.</TE>
<TE>   Defenders of the royal family say the country doesn't need to
change its system because the king protects his people and has their
best interests at heart.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a very loving king, a Christian king and a king who is
acceptable to his people," said Giulio Masasso Paunga, minister for
labor, commerce, industries and tourism. "The most important thing
the king has done for Tonga is maintain the kingdom as a peaceful
country and protect the freedom of people here."</TE>
<TE>   The government also has tried to muzzle democracy advocates. It
has twice jailed the country's most prominent pro-democracy leader,
parliament member Akilisi Pohiva, for 27 days. It has sued him for
defamation more than two dozen times for speaking out against the
monarchy.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, it has put him on trial for sedition for publishing
a letter allegedly written by the king's private secretary referring
to $350 million that the monarch held in overseas accounts. The royal
family says the letter is phony.</TE>
<TE>   Pohiva attends parliament sessions Monday through Friday mornings
and goes to court each Friday afternoon for his trial. He figures the
court proceedings will end sometime next year. He faces seven years
in prison.</TE>
<TE>   "The constitution includes freedom of press and freedom of speech,
but that does not include discussing the royal family," said Pohiva,
whose battle with the monarchy dates to 1985, when he was fired from
his post as teacher for espousing his views.</TE>
<TE>   Tonga lies south of the equator between New Zealand and Hawaii.
Most of the country's 100,000 people survive on the crops they grow,
such as cassava, taro and coconuts. But an even greater number of
Tongans have moved overseas to find work. The money they send home to
their families is the country's biggest source of foreign income.</TE>
<TE>   The king's birthday is a major holiday and is celebrated with a
week of festivities, including a beauty pageant, a cooking contest
and a Bartender of the Year competition. Virtually the entire armed
forces of 360 men took part in the parade.</TE>
<TE>   Today, two high school football teams made up of Tongans living in
California and Hawaii will play a game for the king.</TE>
<TE>   Tongans tend to be big people, and the islanders have high rates
of obesity and diabetes. Tupou was listed in the 1976 Guinness Book
of World Records as the world's heaviest monarch at 462 pounds. More
recently, he began dieting and exercising and is said to have shed
165 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Democracy advocates had hoped that the king would make a place for
himself in Tonga's history books by bequeathing democracy to the
kingdom as he reached old age.</TE>
<TE>   Now their hopes rest with his heir, Crown Prince Tupouto'a, a
well-read bachelor of 53 who at times has hinted privately to some
that he might be open to change. Members of the royal family declined
to be interviewed this week.</TE>
<TE>   Any alteration in government is not likely to happen through
violence. Although their ancestors were fierce warriors who once
raided other South Pacific islands, today's Tongans are peaceful
people. Time drifts by slowly here, and few are eager for rapid
change.</TE>
<TE>   Although Pohiva has been the country's top vote-getter in five
elections since 1990, most people are cautious about speaking out
about the monarchy. Students attending the king's parade said they
had never learned about democracy and didn't know what the term
meant.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a Tongan democracy, and we are enjoying it," said Steven
Wood, a teacher and Education Ministry official. "It is a little
different from America. We still have our king, and we want him to be
ruler for a very long time."</TE>
<TE>   In April, democracy advocates called for a referendum on a
proposal to shift the balance of power. All members of parliament
would be elected, and the one who had majority support would become
prime minister. At least seven of the 12 Cabinet members would have
to be members of parliament.</TE>
<TE>   "In this day and age, the one who has power should be accountable
to the people," said elected parliament member Fred Sevele, a
prominent Tonga businessman. "We just want more sharing of power."</TE>

<HD>Top Palestinian Security Officials Leave Posts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Yasser Arafat fired the powerful head of his West Bank Preventive
Security Services on Thursday, ending days of speculation over Jibril
Rajoub's fate, but not before exposing growing fissures inside the
senior ranks of Palestinian leadership.</LD>
<LD>   Both Rajoub and Gaza Strip-based Police Chief Ghazi Jabali were,
until recently, pillars of the regime they served. But Arab media
reported this week that the Palestinian Authority president had
decided to fire both men.</LD>
<LD>   They, in turn, vowed to defy dismissal, posing a serious challenge
to Arafat's rule at a time when both Israel and the United States are
urging Palestinians to dump their leader.</LD>
<TE>   Jabali told aides Thursday that he had not been fired but was
quitting to run against Arafat in presidential elections scheduled
for January.</TE>
<TE>   Rajoub continued to reject the media reports through much of
Thursday. He told Israel Television that if Arafat wants to institute
reforms, he should begin not with Rajoub's security service "but with
the corrupt people and corrupt administration."</TE>
<TE>   But shortly before midnight, Rajoub told Al Jazeera television
that Arafat had fired him during a two-hour meeting and added that he
accepted the decision. Arafat aide Nabil abu Rudaineh confirmed the
sacking, saying, "Arafat took the decision as part of the changes it
was known would happen."</TE>
<TE>   Rajoub, who speaks fluent Hebrew, had close ties to Israeli
security officials before the outbreak of Israeli-Palestinian
violence in September 2000 and has long been considered a possible
successor to Arafat by both U.S. and Israeli officials. But the
Israeli army attacked his CIA-built headquarters in the West Bank
town of Beitunia during its invasion this spring of Palestinian
territories and forced Rajoub's men to surrender militants held
there. The defeat caused Rajoub to lose credibility among
Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   The political infighting took center stage in the West Bank on
Thursday even as hundreds of thousands of Palestinians scurried to
restock their larders after Israel in several places lifted for
several hours the curfews that had kept residents of entire cities
confined to their homes for days.</TE>
<TE>   Israel moved large forces back into the West Bank last month,
after two suicide bombings in Jerusalem claimed the lives of 26
Israelis. Troops had kept curfews clamped on cities for long
stretches as they conducted house-to-house searches for militants and
their weapons.</TE>
<TE>   In the Gaza Strip late Thursday night, Jihad Amareen, a militant
with the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, was killed along with a nephew who
served as his assistant when the car they were riding in exploded
near the Shati refugee camp, Palestinians reported. Palestinians in
Gaza accused Israel of assassinating the men. A spokesman for the
Israeli army refused to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Al Jazeera, the Arab news channel, reported earlier in the day
that hundreds of Preventive Security officers had informed Rajoub's
designated replacement that they would not serve under the new
commander. A group of senior officers sent a letter to Arafat
bitterly complaining about the way Rajoub had been dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   Confined once again to his battered Ramallah headquarters by
Israeli troops who surround the compound, Arafat is supposed to be
implementing a sweeping reform of his tattered bureaucracy and
shattered security services.</TE>
<TE>   But unrest within the top ranks of the leadership is growing as he
begins to move against specific officials. Rajoub, who claims the
loyalty of the several thousand men serving under him, is thought to
be capable of posing a serious threat to Arafat's grip on power if he
chooses not to accept his dismissal after all.</TE>
<TE>   Rajoub's power base lies in the West Bank, with the members of
Arafat's own Fatah faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization
who rose through the ranks there.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat's power rests with the exiles who accompanied the
Palestinian leader back to the West Bank and Gaza Strip from exile
after the PLO signed the historic 1993 Oslo peace accords with
Israel. For many Palestinians, this old guard has been largely
discredited during the nearly two-year conflict with Israel for
failing either to achieve a diplomatic breakthrough or force Israel
to end its occupation of Palestinian-controlled territories.</TE>
<TE>   "I am a partner in this authority, I'm not just an employee,"
Rajoub said Thursday night after confirming his dismissal. "There is
a political leadership that took this decision.... I will not allow
myself or anyone else to violate presidential decisions."</TE>
<TE>   Jabali is widely criticized among Palestinians as corrupt and is
seen as having little political support.</TE>
<TE>   However, the clash with the security chiefs is seen as
particularly dangerous for Arafat at a time when Palestinians are
increasingly expressing dissatisfaction with his regime and aiming
barbs directly at his leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Zuhair Manasra, the governor of Jenin, in the West Bank, and a
returned exile thought to be deeply loyal to Arafat, told Al Jazeera
that he will be replacing Rajoub.</TE>
<TE>   "I received a letter from my direct boss, the minister of the
interior, appointing me as the commander of the apparatus," Manasra
said. He said Rajoub was slated to replace him as governor of Jenin.</TE>
<TE>   At a Gazan news conference Thursday, civil defense chief Mohammed
abu Marzuk, who also reportedly has been sacked, was defiant.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the right as strugglers to discuss the decision to move
me or sack me and not to hear that from the media," Abu Marzuk said.</TE>
<TE>   Someone, he said, was trying "to make trouble and differences
between Palestinian national leaders--we have to stand strong around
the Palestinian leadership and not allow this to happen."</TE>
<TE>   Israel and the United States have demanded that Arafat streamline
his myriad security organizations and make them accountable to one
minister. Israel has accused the various security services of
coordinating, planning and participating in attacks on Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat has appointed a new interior minister, Abdel Razak Yehiyeh,
and charged him with reorganizing the security services.</TE>

<HD>Rest of City Workers Join Toronto Strike</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>This metropolis, already sweltering through a heat wave among mounds
of uncollected garbage, was dealt another blow Thursday when its
remaining city workers walked off the job, creating the largest
municipal strike in Canadian history.</LD>
<LD>   The labor disruption comes at the height of the tourist season in
the country's largest city.</LD>
<LD>   Citing failed negotiations over job security, more than 15,000 of
the city's employees who work indoors walked off the job Thursday
morning. They joined almost 7,000 outdoor workers, including garbage
collectors, who went on strike more than a week ago.</LD>
<TE>   In Toronto, full-time permanent city workers in unions are
guaranteed lifetime employment after 10 years on the job. Workers
want that term reduced to six years.</TE>
<TE>   The expanded strike has shut down public swimming pools, day care
centers and animal shelters, and will curtail public health services
such as restaurant inspections and water testing at beaches.</TE>
<TE>   "We have made every effort to negotiate collective agreements with
the City of Toronto," Ann Dembiniski, president of a local chapter of
the Canadian Union of Public Employees, said in a news release.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto Mayor Mel Lastman told a news conference Thursday that he
was upset by the effect the strike was having on the city's
residents. But he gave no indication that the two sides were close to
a resolution.</TE>
<TE>   "The people of Toronto feel the union has nothing to complain
about and should get back to work," Lastman said.</TE>
<TE>   Lastman also said he would have no objection if city staff were
legislated back to work by the Ontario provincial government, adding
that legislation has been drafted.</TE>
<TE>   There is speculation that the province would force workers back if
the strike poses a public health threat.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Sheela Basrur, the city's medical officer of health, said her
office had already identified sites where it was critical that action
be taken.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Raid on Village Raises Hard Questions</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: 'Why are they shooting our women and
children?' one victim asks, after the hunt for militants costs more
civilian lives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KANDAHAR, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>In the intensive care unit of the Mirwais Hospital, a 6-year-old boy,
his legs as spindly as pencils, lay with a bandage over his chest
where doctors had removed life-threatening shrapnel.</LD>
<LD>   Across the hall, five children--all with shrapnel wounds--told a
terrifying story of being pursued by an American warplane as they ran
for their lives through wheat fields and dry riverbeds.</LD>
<LD>   In the men's ward, the injuries were similar, but the tone was
angry, indignant, betrayed. Among the injured were people who had
fought with Afghan President Hamid Karzai against the Taliban and had
backed the U.S. war on terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   All of them were victims of a U.S. airstrike early Monday in a
village deep in Oruzgan province in central Afghanistan. Afghan
officials estimate that 44 people died and 120 were wounded, with
more than 20 requiring hospitalization.</TE>
<TE>   Although many questions remain about the reasons for the raid and
the amount of Taliban activity in the province where it took place,
there is no doubt that during the attack women and children were
killed and injured; friends and fellow fighters of Karzai's were
killed; and a party for an upcoming wedding came under fire.</TE>
<TE>   Here in Kandahar, where the majority of the severely injured were
brought, the episode poses hard questions about the costs associated
with the U.S. policy of hunting down every last Taliban and Al Qaeda
fighter.</TE>
<TE>   "Why are they shooting our women and children?" asked Abdul Kaliq,
a 25-year-old farmer from Kakarak, the village where the raid took
place.</TE>
<TE>   "The Americans should make peace in Afghanistan and rebuild
Afghanistan," he said, wincing as he moved in the hospital bed.
Shrapnel lacerated his back and both arms during the raid.</TE>
<TE>   Others sounded angrier.</TE>
<TE>   "Those people bombed our women and children, they killed our women
and children, they are our enemy," said Khudai Nazar. The Kakarak
resident was at the hospital visiting fellow villagers who were
injured.</TE>
<TE>   Nazar, along with several of the injured men and Karzai, is a
member of the Popolzai clan and fought with the Afghan leader last
fall when Karzai went to Oruzgan to rally citizens against the
Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   This is the second time Nazar has lost someone close to him as a
result of U.S. military action. His cousin died when American forces
mistakenly bombed Karzai's troops in December, killing three U.S.
Army Special Forces soldiers and about 25 Afghans.</TE>
<TE>   The circumstances surrounding the Monday attack near the town of
Deh Rawod--as in many of the other American actions that have
resulted in civilian deaths and injuries--remain shrouded in
contradiction. Pentagon officials insist that their forces were fired
on repeatedly by antiaircraft weapons in the area, while villagers
are adamant that they were celebrating the upcoming wedding and,
according to Afghan tradition, firing guns. The Pentagon says there
were Taliban in the village; the locals say they oppose the Taliban
and that, although some supporters of the former regime once lived
near there, none were in the village the night of the party.</TE>
<TE>   Army Maj. Gary Tallman, a spokesman for the joint Afghan-U.S. team
investigating the attack, said American forces on the ground had
reliable information from several sources that senior Taliban leaders
were in the tiny village at the time of the attack.</TE>
<TE>   He said a Special Forces team had surveyed the area at least four
times in the last two weeks and that each time planes had been fired
on by antiaircraft guns.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the gunfire was celebratory or aggressive, the response
affected far more lives than those of the people firing the weapons,
according to injured villagers and their relatives.</TE>
<TE>   If there were Taliban in the village, as U.S. officials contend,
there also were about 300 people attending the engagement party for a
villager's son. As is customary, the women were celebrating in one
group and the men in another. The party went late because summers are
hot in Afghanistan and only night brings some welcome coolness.</TE>
<TE>   As tradition dictates, neither the groom nor bride were present,
although the party was held in part at the home of the groom's
family. Many relatives were among the dead or injured.</TE>
<TE>   With the festivities, some people said they didn't even hear the
AC-130 gunship as it approached the compound. Sadiqa, 15, was in the
women's section listening to music when the firing started.</TE>
<TE>   The first fire hit among the women, she said. Terrified, she and
others ran out of the courtyard and into surrounding fields. Sadiqa
said she searched for a dry stream bed where she could hide. She was
shot as she ran, the shrapnel shearing into both legs.</TE>
<TE>   Days later, she still wore the salmon-colored dress she had put on
for the party. Her injuries will heal, doctors say; far harder is the
loss of her entire family, 15 people who died in the raid.</TE>
<TE>   On a neighboring bed, Sabor Gul, 11, stared out in distress. She
looked terrified as two reporters asked what had happened. A nurse
explained that the girl was scared because the visitors were
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "The American people bombed us," Sabor said softly. "The airplane
was very big. When the bombing started, every woman was scared; other
women were killed in the river."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the horror of what has happened, not a single person
interviewed said they wanted the Americans to withdraw from
Afghanistan. Rather, they had a realpolitik view of their situation.</TE>
<TE>   "No, the Americans should not leave," said Mohammed Shah, 25, the
brother of the groom, who had shrapnel injuries on his legs and arms
and had fought with Karzai in Oruzgan. The Americans "should not let
the Taliban get away," he said, adding that he fears that supporters
of the deposed Islamic regime will kill villagers who supported
Karzai.</TE>
<TE>   But he said the Americans must find some other way to track down
Taliban fighters.</TE>
<TE>   "They should come and surround our village, ask us questions and
search our houses," he said. "This is not the way: to bomb us."</TE>

<HD>Airline Guards' Response Is Praised</HD>
<DH>Security: Swift reaction lives up to El Al's reputation and
may have saved more lives. But incident raises new questions about
safety.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As bloody as the shootings were at Los Angeles International Airport,
a quick response by El Al airline security personnel may have
prevented a more deadly outcome, officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike many domestic airlines, El Al, Israel's national airline,
has armed personnel on the ground at most of its facilities. Police
said that at least two El Al security guards, assisted by a
passenger, subdued the gunman in Thursday's attack. One of the
security guards shot and killed him. Neither the agents nor the
gunman have been identified.</LD>
<LD>   In Israel, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres praised the "swift
reaction and the courage" of the airline guards in Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Richard Garcia, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Los
Angeles office, also credited the quick response by the security
personnel with preventing further injuries.</TE>
<TE>   But the incident raised new questions about airport security.
While a variety of measures, including random searches, more air
marshals and stricter scrutiny of boarding passengers, have been
instituted since the Sept. 11 terror attacks, those steps have
chiefly focused on protecting aircraft and passengers once they have
cleared security gates. There is no screening of people approaching
ticket counters.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to look at this incident to see what we need to do,"
said Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn. "Our present layout is not
designed with security in mind. Security is an evolving science."</TE>
<TE>   El Al prides itself on having the industry's most stringent
security, including plainclothes armed guards on every flight,
intensive passenger searches, reinforced cockpits, undercover guards
in airport terminals and extensive profiling of ticket holders to
detect possible terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those measures trouble civil liberties advocates in the
United States. Airline officials, however, note that no El Al flight
has been the target of a successful air piracy attempt in more than
two decades.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even more security personnel inside airports does not
necessarily assure safety. National Guard troops have been deployed
at many U.S. airports for months after the Sept. 11 attacks. And not
even Israeli security has been enough to thwart some of the deadliest
attacks in airline terminals.</TE>
<TE>   In December 1985, Palestinian gunmen opened fire and threw
grenades at passengers at the El Al check-in counters at airports in
Rome and Vienna, killing 18 people.</TE>

<HD>Friendly Offer of Ride to Airport Ends in Death</HD>
<DH>Shooting: Family man of Valley Village came to the U.S. 14
years ago and made his mark in the Jewish community with devotion and
generosity.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Jacob Aminov was a deeply religious man, a devoted father of eight
and the kind of friend you could always count on, said those who knew
him.</LD>
<LD>   So it was not unusual that Aminov, who was also known as Yaakov,
offered to drive a longtime friend to the airport Thursday, even on a
day when many were worried and his family begged him not to go.</LD>
<LD>   "His son was saying to him, 'Don't go. It's dangerous,' " said
Aminov's brother-in-law, Mark Ezerzer.</LD>
<TE>   Aminov, 46, a diamond importer who owned a jewelry distribution
company in downtown Los Angeles, immigrated from Israel 14 years ago.
He had taken his friend, who was traveling home to Israel, to the
airport and was waiting in line at the El Al Israel Airlines ticket
counter when he was shot. He was hit at least once in the chest and
was in cardiac arrest when he arrived by ambulance at Martin Luther
King Jr.-Drew Medical Center just after noon, said Dr. Jean-Claude
Henry.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors worked on him for nearly an hour before declaring him
dead, Henry said. Aminov's wife, Anat, who is pregnant, fainted when
she learned that her husband had not survived his injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "She was severely grieved," Henry said.</TE>
<TE>   At Aminov's home in Valley Village, just hours later, friends,
neighbors and relatives filled the living room and spilled into the
frontyard. They described him as honest, spiritual and soft-spoken.</TE>
<TE>   "He would not speak one word unnecessarily," said friend Nir
Yacoby, who added that Aminov was "always smiling."</TE>
<TE>   Aminov worked hard at his job. But his true devotion, said his
friends, was to his family. He and his wife were expecting their
sixth child. Aminov is also the father of three other children from a
previous marriage.</TE>
<TE>   "Family was his main focus, and not just his own children, but the
extended family as well," said Rabbi Aron Tendler, who has known the
Aminov family for many years.</TE>
<TE>   Aminov was also the founding member of Yad Avraham, an Orthodox
Jewish synagogue in North Hollywood, Tendler said. He also frequently
was host to religious seminars at his home. Aminov prayed twice a
day, once in the morning and once in the evening.</TE>
<TE>   "The family was very generous," Tendler said. "They were not a
wealthy family. But he and his wife really made their home a center."</TE>
<TE>   Jack Katash, 52, attended synagogue with Aminov. He said Aminov
gave money to the poor and donated his time to the congregation.</TE>
<TE>   "He was generous in every way--you name it," Katash said. "He's
one of the best."</TE>
<TE>   Aminov was introduced to his wife through a rabbi and the two were
married more than 10 years ago, said Mike Bachar, who is Anat
Aminov's brother.</TE>
<TE>   Bachar said his 38-year-old sister, who sells hats out of her
home, was in shock Thursday evening.</TE>
<TE>   "She doesn't know how she is going to start her life again," he
said. "She was leaning on him."</TE>
<TE>   Late Thursday, relatives told Aminov's children about their
father's death. "They didn't understand it," Bachar said. "They had
no idea."</TE>
<TE>   The family planned to bury Aminov in Israel, where much of his
extended family still lives.</TE>
<TE>   Tendler said, "When God takes a good one, that makes it all the
more painful."</TE>

<HD>4 Die, 12 Injured as Plane Crashes Into Crowd at Park</HD>
<DH>Accident: Aircraft clips a tree, scattering debris and
sending the fuselage into holiday throng.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH and ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A small twin-engine plane crashed into a crowd of families as they
began their Fourth of July picnics at a San Dimas park Thursday
afternoon, killing four people and injuring at least 12, four of them
critically. Among the dead were the pilot, a 12-year-old girl and a
15-month-old boy.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said the Cessna 310 was lifting off from nearby Brackett
Field in La Verne when the pilot, Michael Brand, radioed that he was
having trouble climbing. Witnesses said the plane began to sink and
veered left over Puddingstone Reservoir, then clipped a tree on shore
and began breaking apart. It skidded into a crowd of about 500 people
who had been picnicking and playing at a lakeside beach.</LD>
<LD>   "Debris, smoke and bodies went flying," said Javier Franco, 24,
who was spending the day with his family at Frank G. Bonelli Regional
Park. "It was chaos."</LD>
<TE>   Frine Flores, 32, of Pasadena said: "Everyone was crying,"</TE>
<TE>   Flores said she had finished her lunch and was heading to her car,
"when all of a sudden, we heard a roaring sound." She said she looked
up and saw the plane "coming in at a steep angle."</TE>
<TE>   Franco said he and others ran to the wreckage to see if they could
help. He said he saw two girls, one about 15, the other about 3,
pinned beneath one of the wings.</TE>
<TE>   "My father and some others helped me lift the wing off and we
pulled them out," Franco said. He said the girls were silent and
still. The mother of the younger girl ran up and lifted her child,
moaning: "My baby. My baby," Flores said. A severely injured boy, who
appeared to be about 4, was lying on the ground nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital officials, family members and coroner's officials
identified the dead as Brand, 44, of Glendora, passenger Michael
Alder, 49, of Glendora, Jackie Ngo-Ton, 12, of La Mirada and
15-month-old Brandon Truong of El Monte.</TE>
<TE>   One of the critically injured was Jackie's 8-year-old brother,
Andy. He was flown by helicopter to Childrens Hospital in Los
Angeles, where he was reported unconscious and in critical condition
with severe head wounds. A 12-year-old girl was also flown to the
hospital, where she was in serious condition with internal injuries
and multiple cuts and bruises.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the injured were flown by helicopter to Pomona Valley
Hospital Medical Center and Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   The patients at the Pomona hospital were identified as Richard
Kang, 54, and his wife, Kyung Kang, 49, both of whom were treated and
released, and a relative, Duk Sun Kang, who was listed in serious
condition. None of the other injured were identified, and details
about their conditions were not immediately available.</TE>
<TE>   Federal records indicate that Brand was an experienced pilot--a
certified flight instructor with licensing that allowed him to fly
commercially. Authorities said early in the evening that an
unidentified passenger had survived the crash, but that could not be
confirmed later Thursday. authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   They were flying in the Cessna, a popular five-seat propeller
plane with a good safety record. It lifted off the runway and headed
west over the reservoir, following a standard flight pattern.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Schiff, a retired Trans World Airlines pilot and air safety
consultant, said the plane's behavior--sinking after takeoff and
banking to the left--was consistent with a left engine failure. But
he and the National Transportation Safety Board, which is handling
the investigation, said it was too early to draw any firm
conclusions.</TE>
<TE>   Flores said the park was peaceful before the accident. Jet Skis
and sailboats were zig-zagging across the quiet lake and the shore
was dotted with families and friends enjoying the holiday.</TE>
<TE>   Franco said that about 12:30 p.m., his mother, Rosa, looked up and
realized something was wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "She said, 'That plane is too low, and it's coming in,' " Franco
said.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said the plane started disintegrating when it clipped
the tree. Small chunks of debris flew in all directions, landing
among groups of people scattered along the shore, but most of the
serious injuries were apparently sustained when the fuselage skidded
through the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses reported that sheriff's deputies, county firefighters
and a lifeguard rescue boat quickly converged on the scene. Scuba
divers searched the lake to make sure there were no other victims, a
sheriff's deputy said. The FAA and National Transportation Safety
Board also were investigating the crash.</TE>
<TE>   Several people reported a strong smell of aviation fuel, but there
was no fire. Even as the injured were evacuated and the investigation
began, the rest of the park and the reservoir remained open. Hundreds
of people continued to celebrate and picnic on the far side of the
lake.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Most fishermen like to catch and keep the big ones and throw the
little guys back, but a new study suggests that it's better for the
fish species to do exactly the opposite.</LD>
<LD>   In a study in the journal Science, researchers at Stony Brook
University in New York conducted a four-generation laboratory study
of fish and found that when the bigger fish are allowed to live,
eventually the species may double in size and number.</LD>
<LD>   The study, led by David O. Conover, a professor at the Marine
Sciences Research Center at Stony Brook, experimented with a species
called the Atlantic silverside but said this principle should apply
to most free-swimming harvested fish.</LD>

<LD>The son of James Byrd Jr., a black man dragged to death in 1998 by a
white supremacist in Jasper, led a fast and prayer vigil to fight for
the life of his father's killer.</LD>
<LD>   John W. King, the first of two white men sentenced to death for
the 49-year-old Byrd's slaying, has almost exhausted his state
appeals. Byrd's son, Ross, who initially favored the sentence, has
since changed his mind.</LD>
<LD>   "When I heard King had exhausted his appeals, I began thinking,
'How can this help me or solve my pain?' and I realized it couldn't,"
Byrd said.</LD>

<LD>He gorged, and gulped and nearly gagged.</LD>
<LD>   And then, in a last-minute feeding frenzy, Takeru Kobayashi of
Japan--the Michael Jordan of hot dog eating--defended his world title
by gobbling a world record 50 1/2 franks in just 12 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   The reed-thin Kobayashi plowed through an average of one hot dog
every 14.25 seconds to ensure he would retain the mustard yellow
championship belt in the 87th competition at Nathan's Famous on New
York's Coney Island.</LD>
<TE>   Kobayashi, 24, employed the "Solomon method": snapping the hot
dogs in half, then simultaneously shoving both pieces into his mouth.</TE>
<TE>   Before the contest, Kobayashi weighed in at 113 pounds. After he
won, he'd ballooned to 129.</TE>

<HD>Buffalo Bill Rides Again in Old Poster</HD>
<DH>History: Billboard promoting 1878 appearance found behind
crumbling wall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JAMESTOWN, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>JAMESTOWN, N.Y. -- The crumbling brick facade of a downtown building
revealed a long-forgotten secret: a 124-year-old billboard promoting
a dramatic appearance by Buffalo Bill Cody.</LD>
<LD>   Experts say the 26-by-10-foot billboard, uncovered when workers
began removing the wall last month to prevent its collapse, is among
the earliest graphic representations of the Wild West legend.</LD>
<LD>   Pasted to wood sheathing behind the bricks was the paper poster of
Cody waving his hat to a crowd, announcing "Buffalo Bill in his new
theatrical drama ... May Cody" on March 14, 1878.</LD>
<TE>   "We knew we had to act quickly," said Keith Schmitt, acting
director of the Chautauqua County Arts Council, which quickly began
preservation work on the fragile paper.</TE>
<TE>   Schmitt and volunteers photographed the pieces and collected those
that were removable as historians began researching the performance
at the Allen Opera House in this city 60 miles south of Buffalo.</TE>
<TE>   Historian Karen E. Livsey found that the show was part of a sixth
anniversary tour of "The Buffalo Bill Combination," an early theater
troupe organized by and starring Cody. "May Cody" depicted the
Mormons' early settlement in Utah.</TE>
<TE>   William F. Cody was a Pony Express rider and Civil War veteran who
later hunted buffalo to feed railroad construction crews.</TE>
<TE>   Cody became a national folk hero in the pages of the "Buffalo
Bill" dime novels of Ned Buntline, who persuaded Cody to take to the
stage to tell stories of the Wild West.</TE>

<HD>Bush Blends Patriotism, Religion</HD>
<DH>Holiday: President, in Ripley, W.Va., for the 4th of July,
focuses on U.S. unity amid terrorism and the nation's debt to one
deity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RIPLEY, W.Va.</DL>
<LD>In a mountain hamlet, where the T-shirts proclaimed that it was
hosting ''The nation's largest small town Independence Day
celebration,'' President Bush imbued the Fourth of July with the aura
of a religious holiday.</LD>
<LD>   To a throng of West Virginians gathered before a county
courthouse, the president delivered a message of American unity in
the face of attack, vowed the use of massive military might around
the world and steeped it all in the cadences of a country preacher.</LD>
<LD>   The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks offered the president a new context
for an old message, well-worked by politicians from town mayors to
chief executives on the national holiday.</LD>
<TE>   ''In this 226th year of our independence, we have seen that
American patriotism is still a living faith. We love our country only
more when she's threatened,'' the president said.</TE>
<TE>   Offering a declaration of unity, he said: ''When you strike one
American, you strike us all....</TE>
<TE>   ''History has called America to use our overwhelming power in the
defense of freedom. And we'll do just that.''</TE>
<TE>   The president, who boarded Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base
outside Washington in a gray business suit, white shirt and red tie,
shed the tie and jacket and appeared here in a white Western-style
shirt, quickly rolling up his sleeves even before he began speaking
to the sun-draped crowd.</TE>
<TE>   He said that the liberation of Afghanistan from Taliban rule ''was
the beginning of the long and unrelenting struggle we have entered''
and declared: ''We will take the battle to the enemy, wherever he
hides and wherever he plans and wherever he dwells.''</TE>
<TE>   And throughout were reminders that the Founding Fathers had, even
as they established freedom of religion as an underlying principle,
declared the nation's debt to a single deity.</TE>
<TE>   ''We're thankful for our freedom, the freedom declared by our
Founding Fathers, defended by many generations and granted to each
one of us by Almighty God,'' Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   He also used the day to declare that he would speed the process
for foreign-born members of the U.S. armed services to apply for
citizenship. The White House later said that this could affect as
many as 15,000 military personnel.</TE>
<TE>   The president's helicopter, Marine One, landed Thursday morning in
the front yard of Mabel Chapman, 81, who, reporters were told, cut
her two-acre lawn herself on a riding mower.</TE>
<TE>   Bush made his remarks in front of the flag-bedecked Jackson County
Courthouse, erected in 1916 at the intersection of Main and Court
streets. Placed as a camera-friendly backdrop for the president were
about two dozen men in military regalia: green uniforms for current
members of the Army, the caps of the American Legion and Veterans of
Foreign Wars for the veterans.</TE>
<TE>   The town, with a population listed at 3,023--well more than
appeared to have turned out--is 32 miles from the state capital,
Charleston, and about 250 miles west of Washington.</TE>
<TE>   But West Virginia--dubbed both the northernmost Southern state or
the southernmost Northern state, depending on perspective--offered
Bush more than convenient geography. It is prominent in his political
universe.</TE>
<TE>   It was one of a small group of states that by conventional wisdom
would support a Democratic presidential candidate--but one in which
broad shifts in voting patterns in 2000 put it into Bush's camp.</TE>
<TE>   Without it, he would have lost the election, and he had been
president less than a month when he paid his first visit here in
2001.</TE>
<TE>   And Ripley offered him not just a friendly crowd but also one
receptive to a religious message.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Jack Miller of the West Ripley Baptist Church declared in
his invocation before Bush arrived: ''We have ridiculed the absolute
truth of [God's] word in the name of multiculturalism. We have been
forced to honor sexual deviance in the name of freedom of expression.
We have exploited the system of education in the name of the
lottery.... We have killed our unborn children in the name of
choice.''</TE>
<TE>   That message decrying multiculturalism seemed to conflict with
Bush's statement later that "every ethnic background is known and
respected here in America. Every religious belief is practiced and
protected here." On other occasions Bush has noted that some
Americans don't practice religion. He made no such point Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Roy Guthrie--who was sharing a platform with notables from
Bush and Gov. Bob Wise and Sen. John D. "Jay" Rockefeller IV, both
Democrats, to the Miss Ripley Fourth of July Queen 2002--said, ''God
gave us the greatest country in the world.''</TE>
<TE>   And when the crowd, with Bush on the stage, recited the Pledge of
Allegiance, the words ''under God'' boomed out from hundreds and
hundreds of throats, in spontaneous rebuke to the U.S. appellate
court ruling last week that those two words make the pledge
unconstitutional because it melds the roles of church and state.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, said Bush, wrapping religion and the flag into a single
fabric, ''no authority of government can ever prevent an American
from pledging allegiance to this one nation under God.''</TE>
<TE>   The president spent barely two hours here, returning to Washington
at midday, and he planned to watch the fireworks display Thursday
night over the Washington Monument from a White House balcony, White
House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said.</TE>

<DH>Citizenship: 70 new Americans savor their moment of triumph
at Jefferson's Monticello.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.R. MOEHRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va.</DL>
<LD>   This was the day they thought would never
come. Fleeing the Nazis and the Communists and the tanks of Tiananmen
Square, dodging bullets and rockets and long knives, escaping civil
wars and mass arrests and torture squads, they didn't dream that one
day they would be here, standing on this mountaintop, soaring above
this valley--free.</LD>
<LD>   Not that this is the Promised Land. They don't believe in promised
lands. They didn't know what to expect when they set out for this
country, and they weren't always welcomed when they arrived.</LD>
<LD>   The only promise they had in mind was one they made themselves, to
try for a little peace and dignity, to risk everything so their
children might have a chance at happiness. America was the place that
helped them keep that promise, and this mountaintop was where that
promise would become a pledge. And Thursday was the day.</LD>
<TE>   It happens every summer. Randomly chosen immigrants living in the
Charlottesville area receive an invitation to Monticello, the
magnificent white-columned mansion of Thomas Jefferson, to be sworn
in as American citizens. The ceremony is meant to be a departure from
the norm: Typically, after showing proof of residency, after
undergoing background checks, after passing an American history test,
immigrants become naturalized in some stuffy courthouse or
bureaucrat's office.</TE>
<TE>   But every Fourth of July--the anniversary of Jefferson's death as
well as America's birth--the process is transformed into something
special, a lavish ceremony with speeches and bunting and hundreds of
onlookers, which celebrates America's four centuries of immigration
as much as it honors the immigrants themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Ceremony Has Added Meaning This Year</TE>
<TE>   And this year, with America at war, with Americans wary about
illegal immigrants in their midst, with every American citizen
declared a target by terrorists, the 40th annual Monticello ceremony
was sure to take on more meaning. Every immigrant who received an
invitation last week knew that becoming a citizen would be an act of
bravery as well as a moment of triumph.</TE>
<TE>   The ceremony was scheduled for 11 a.m. Some were there by 5:45. So
they had hours to trade stories. Why they left home. How they got
here. Each story was different and each was the same. They came from
vastly different places and cultures, but they stayed for one reason.
America fed their hunger for freedom and made them hungry for more.</TE>
<TE>   Daud Mahmoud's story--which he told carefully, haltingly--begins
and ends with the soil. Daud grows things for a living, and when he
learned last week that he and his wife, Adela, would be among the 70
men and women from 33 countries being sworn Thursday, his heart
opened like one of his prized flowers. He read aloud the letter from
the Immigration and Naturalization Service, saying that he and Adela
had been chosen, and they grew wild with excitement. A man of
routine, Daud tried to focus for the rest of the week on his daily
schedule--rise at dawn, exercise, shower, pray, off to work at the
green nursery--but it was hard to concentrate.</TE>
<TE>   As a boy in Kabul, Afghanistan, Daud loved his native land and
never wanted to leave. Family meant everything to him, and in Kabul
he was surrounded by 13 siblings and 100 first cousins. America was a
distant planet swimming in a far-off galaxy. If he harbored any ideas
of visiting, these were just vague dreams. They didn't become
desperate hopes until 1979, when the tanks appeared.</TE>
<TE>   As troops from the Soviet Union came rumbling across the border,
many in Daud's world suddenly vanished. Some were killed; others fled
into the mountains. A few managed to leave the country, like his
brother, who crossed into Pakistan, then onward to America, with his
wife and children.</TE>
<TE>   Daud longed to join his brother, but his parents were old. Someone
had to stay behind to care for them. "I couldn't leave," Daud said in
the voice of a gentle man from a violent place.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Daud had a good job in the ministry of agriculture. He was
doing what he loved, studying crops and climate, learning to make
things grow. He surveyed his life in Kabul--a family he loved, a
house he owned, a fine orchard out back--and he felt rooted to the
ground, like one of his apple trees.</TE>
<TE>   Nine years passed. The Soviet invasion stalled. But as the troops
pulled back, Afghanistan slid into civil war. The streets around
Daud's house crackled with gunfire.</TE>
<TE>   "The rockets was passing our house," Daud said. "Tens of rockets
every night. Every second we thought, this rocket's going to hit the
house."</TE>
<TE>   Government officials pressured Daud to join the party, join the
fight. One of his bosses even waved a pistol in his face. Daud simply
kept working, kept making things grow and bided his time.</TE>
<TE>   Husband Decides 'It's Time for Us to Go'</TE>
<TE>   By then his parents had died, so Daud took Adela aside one morning
and whispered, "It's time for us to go."</TE>
<TE>   Seven months' pregnant, Adela cringed. But she knew Daud was
right.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course it was life-threatening," he said. "But I said, Let me
to get this chance at life. I don't like to be in danger every day.
Better to be in danger one day than every day."</TE>
<TE>   It was early spring but biting cold. Snow and frozen mud covered
the ground. Daud and Adela disguised themselves and their four
children, all under 13, then hurried into a hired car and sped for
the border.</TE>
<TE>   No one said a word. Adela sat in the front seat, paralyzed.</TE>
<TE>   "I had the Koran on my chest," she said, "praying to God to save
us."</TE>
<TE>   Her greatest fear wasn't land mines but bandits. They might kill
or kidnap Daud and leave her stranded with the children in the Khyber
Pass. Armed men did stop the car twice, waving guns, demanding money,
but Daud paid them each time and was allowed to proceed.</TE>
<TE>   They reached Pakistan in 20 hours, dazed and weak. They had
nothing. They lived for a time with Daud's uncles and cousins, and
Daud found a job at an office many miles away. He commuted on an old
bicycle, a 45-minute ride each way.</TE>
<TE>   Family Settles in Virginia, Via Dallas</TE>
<TE>   Soon he had enough money to take his family to Dallas, where his
brother had settled. "My brother picked us from the Dallas airport,"
Daud said, "and we were crying, everyone crying."</TE>
<TE>   A sister had also made her way to America, to Virginia, and she
told Daud about life here. Rolling farmland. Cool mountain air. He
liked the sound of these mountains: Blue Ridge Mountains. He knew
that he would need mountains around him to feel at home.</TE>
<TE>   So 18 months later, he moved his family once more, to
Waynesboro, a small town just 30 miles west of Monticello, where he and
Adela began the process of becoming Americans. They bought a house at
the end of a quiet street. They sent their children to the local school.
They encouraged their oldest son to join the Marines. They learned
English--a struggle for Daud, whose tongue spoke Dari and often
wouldn't listen to his American head.</TE>
<TE>   He worked with a tutor in the evenings and on weekends.</TE>
<TE>   Adela attended cosmetology school and found work as a hairdresser.
But Daud had trouble getting a job. After eight months of looking, he
grew desperate. He begged one nursery to take him on, even offering
to volunteer, to demonstrate his work ethic. They gave him a try, at
minimum wage.</TE>
<TE>   He was overjoyed. At last he was making things grow again.</TE>
<TE>   "I do a great job," he said. "I'm proud of myself. I'm honest.
Reliable. Dependable. Responsible for something when it is given to
me."</TE>
<TE>   Last September, however, he was laid off. Business was down
sharply. A week later came the attacks on the World Trade Center and
the Pentagon, and Daud sank into a deep depression. "I had no job,"
he said, "and every day you're watching people that they were died.
They were killed. They were under the whole debris."</TE>
<TE>   A doctor found that Daud's blood pressure was dangerously high.
The doctor prescribed pills and told Daud to control his stress. But
how could he control stress when no one would hire him? Daud mailed
200 resumes: No one wanted a Muslim from Afghanistan last fall.</TE>
<TE>   He focused his efforts on one nursery, visiting the owner again
and again.</TE>
<TE>   "I went there every day," Daud said. "Then one day the owner said:
'I like your consistency.' "</TE>
<TE>   Daud got the job this year and threw himself into his work. "The
plants talk to me," he said. "I look at their faces and they say, I
am hungry, I am sick, I am tired. They tell me what they need."</TE>
<TE>   He was delighted, and proud, when four of his new co-workers
appeared in the audience a few minutes before the Monticello ceremony
began.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been great since he started working there," said Deborah
Wilder. "He's so professional, and he works so hard."</TE>
<TE>   And everything he touches, she added, just seems to grow.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes his life doesn't seem real. "I don't believe I
could make all this journey," Daud said. "If I know it would take me 14
years to make this journey, when I started it might make me weak."</TE>
<TE>   How can one life span contain two such distinct lives, he wonders.
Did he dream the Afghanistan life? It's hard to tell the difference
sometimes between dreams and memories. "Some nights I am still
dreaming I'm in Afghanistan," he said, "and people are chasing me."</TE>
<TE>   But in the morning, when he wakes up, he's in the Blue Ridge
Mountains. He's wearing sport sandals and chinos and a white polo
shirt. He's watching Peter Jennings. He's driving a shiny red
Chevrolet. He's drinking Coors Light and rooting for the Washington
Redskins.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel, and I'm sure my family feels, that we were born here," he
said. "And we are part of this country. We were born in Afghanistan,
but now the United States feels like Afghanistan to me."</TE>
<TE>   And so the Monticello ceremony seemed more a confirmation of
something already true than a transformation. An important
confirmation, however, a day he and Adela thought would never come.</TE>
<TE>   And for Adela it didn't come. Not Thursday. When Daud phoned
Monticello for details of the ceremony, he learned that Adela's name
wasn't on the list. He had misread the letter. Only he was chosen to
take part in the ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   Adela will be sworn in later this summer, in a stuffy courthouse
or a bureaucrat's office.</TE>
<TE>   She was devastated when he told her. She dropped her eyes and said
nothing. He tried to comfort her, promising that when she became a
citizen they would celebrate again, make that day special too. She
smiled weakly and looked up at him.</TE>
<TE>   "I know," she said, barely audible.</TE>
<TE>   But she was putting on a brave face for Daud. And she wore a
special dress for the occasion that he was sure to love, covered with
pink flowers. Daud also dressed up, wearing a crisp white shirt.
Together they arrived at Monticello just before 8 a.m. They strolled
across the lawn, with three of their children, and up to the
registration table, in the shade of a spreading tulip poplar that
Jefferson himself had planted.</TE>
<TE>   Immigrants From All Over the World</TE>
<TE>   Then they took a seat among the men and women from Fiji and Iran
and El Salvador, from Guyana and Ukraine and Poland, from Malaysia
and Taiwan and Albania. Daud sat in the front row, not far from Alla
Roubinets, of Belarus, who escaped Adolf Hitler as a 5-year-old and
survived Joseph Stalin as an adult. "My father and my husband's
father were killed in the war," she said. "We have hard time. Not
good. Then we come to America. America did good for us."</TE>
<TE>   He sat a few rows from Helen Shen of China, who came to California
to study and stayed because of Tiananmen Square. He sat in front of
Ilka Waufle of Brazil, who had spent much of the week memorizing the
oath of citizenship as if it were a poem.</TE>
<TE>   And for her, it was.</TE>
<TE>   In the back row sat John Kanu, a third-year medical student at the
University of Virginia. He came to America 13 years ago from
Freetown, Sierra Leone, to avenge the death of his father, who became
ill when Kanu was a boy.</TE>
<TE>   Kanu believes his father's illness was treatable. But Sierra Leone
doctors misdiagnosed the condition, he said, and his father suffered
horribly. After three years of pain, his father died.</TE>
<TE>   To honor his father's memory, Kanu came to America for college and
medical school, paying his way with loans and grants. He was lonely
and homesick when he arrived, a teenager speaking in a thick Krio
accent in a place where everyone spoke in a languid drawl. And he
couldn't speak with his mother and sisters back home, because civil
war had erupted in Sierra Leone. The only news he received was the
occasional TV report about people being tortured and mutilated by the
rebels.</TE>
<TE>   "Children had their arms cut off," he said. "It was a very trying
time. It put a lot of strain on me."</TE>
<TE>   He survived those bleak days by concentrating on his father, who
showed such courage. With no formal education, Kanu's father worked
as a custodian at a university. But he constantly urged Kanu to aim
for college, for medical school, for the moon.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Kanu's mother and his family were settling themselves in the
audience, waiting to see the young medical student become an
American.</TE>
<TE>   While waiting for the ceremony to begin, he studied the symptoms
of pulmonary disease in one of his medical textbooks.</TE>
<TE>   Across the great lawn, appraising the lines of Jefferson's mansion
carefully, was Paul Jasiurkowski, from Poland, for whom America is
most vividly embodied by a house.</TE>
<TE>   Living in Krakow in the 1970s, Jasiurkowski worked as a ditch
digger. There were days, standing in his ditch, he would pause to
gaze down the street at the American consulate. "I noticed that huge
big American flag," he said. "And always I could feel my skin
crawling when I see that flag. I would get chills."</TE>
<TE>   Leaning on his shovel he would think: "Someday."</TE>
<TE>   In 1981, someday arrived. Jasiurkowski moved to Virginia to work
as caretaker on a wealthy woman's farm. He tended the woman's alfalfa
fields, stacked her hay, fed her Black Angus cows and fell in love
with the landscape. Over time he convinced her to sell him a small
piece of the farm, which he held on to for 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   A few months ago, Jasiurkowski broke ground on that piece of land,
and his new house, partly designed by him, will soon be finished. He
drives there every day in his truck and had every intention of
driving there Thursday after the ceremony, even though his wife made
a batch of sauerkraut and friends were coming over to celebrate.</TE>
<TE>   He almost can't help himself, his wife said. He likes to go there
and sit on the piles of dirt and grin at the giant hole in the
ground.</TE>
<TE>   Some days he joyfully digs a ditch around the house, for the
drainage system. But now, in America, he uses a backhoe, which he
borrows from his new next-door neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Daud wanted to meet his fellow immigrants, but he was shy. Also,
he wanted to stay close to Adela, who felt left out, and often went
missing among the gardens.</TE>
<TE>   "Why you are staying away from me today?" he kidded her, and she
smiled.</TE>
<TE>   At last it was time for the ceremony. Irish author Frank McCourt
was the guest speaker, and he described his "love" for America,
emphasizing the word again and again. He recounted how his love
swelled and broke his heart after the attacks on the World Trade
Center, and he congratulated the immigrants on sharing this love, and
he thanked them for "expanding" American society.</TE>
<TE>   "You have so much to look forward to," he said. "And your children
have so much to look forward to. So thank you for becoming Americans.
And welcome."</TE>
<TE>   At noon, it was time for Daud to walk up the front steps of
Jefferson's house and recite the oath of citizenship, to declare that
he would defend the Constitution and the laws of the United States,
and that he would bear arms on behalf of the United States. He raised
his right hand and swore.</TE>
<TE>   A judge declared him a citizen of these United States, and the
band played "God Bless America," and the crowd stood and applauded.
Daud hugged Adela and his children and beamed at everyone.</TE>
<TE>   Not with pride, but a sense of accomplishment. He had set out to
do this thing, and this was the day he did it. He struggled to
describe what he had done to everyone who stopped by to congratulate
him, but the words weren't there.</TE>
<TE>   Still, you could see in his smile as he walked to his car,
past the lovely flower beds and soaring sugar maples and blooming
impatiens, what it was.</TE>
<TE>   He had made America grow--by one.</TE>

<HD>N.J. Blaze Kills 3 Children, 3 Firefighters</HD>
<DH>Deaths: The duplex fire in a Philadelphia suburb is being
investigated as a crime. The girls' mother is in critical condition;
eight firefighters were injured.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GLOUCESTER CITY, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Fire broke out in a two-story duplex Thursday, killing 3-year-old
twins, their 5-year-old sister and three firefighters trying to
rescue them, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   One of the three firefighters had proposed to his girlfriend at a
Fourth of July fireworks display only 12 hours earlier.</LD>
<LD>   The blaze was being investigated as a crime, although there was no
evidence it had been set, authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   The three firefighters who died had been looking for the three
young sisters when the roof collapsed, authorities said. Five other
firefighters also were trapped but were dug out by comrades, said
acting Camden County Prosecutor James Lynch.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like a deck of cards falling down," said neighbor Monique
Gagliardi as she watched rescue workers remove a child's body from
the debris. "It was horrible."</TE>
<TE>   The fire was extinguished within about five hours, and rescuers
used backhoes to clear debris while they searched for victims. When a
firefighter's body was removed, police and firefighters lined up
several rows deep and saluted.</TE>
<TE>   Two Mount Ephraim volunteer firefighters, Chief James Sylvester
and Deputy Chief John West, were killed alongside Thomas Stewart III,
who had used the public address system on a firetruck Wednesday night
to propose to his girlfriend.</TE>
<TE>   "They were dedicated firemen, and they died doing what they
loved," said Anthony Stagliano, a spokesman for the Gloucester City
Fire Department.</TE>
<TE>   The girls' mother was hospitalized in critical but stable
condition. Gagliardi said the woman ran back into the house to try to
save her daughters. Their father was treated for minor smoke
inhalation, said Greg Reinert, a spokesman for the prosecutor's
office.</TE>
<TE>   Eight firefighters were treated at a hospital for minor injuries
and released.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. James McGreevey stopped at the hospital on his way to the
fire scene. He said the three firefighters made "the supreme
sacrifice," and he promised the state would pay for their children's
college education.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors said the home was rented by a family that had lived
there less than a year.</TE>
<TE>   Holiday festivities in the town of 11,000 residents were canceled.</TE>
<TE>   Gloucester City is about five miles south of Philadelphia.</TE>

<KH>DISPATCH FROM THE RODEO-CHEDISKI FIRE</KH>
<HD>As Danger Ebbs, Residents Assess the Financial, Emotional
Damage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SLATER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PAYSON, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>It takes a good 10 hours to circumnavigate the Rodeo-Chediski fire,
with its 200-mile perimeter and hundreds of roadblocks and detours.
All along every route are yellow signs: "Watch for elk."</LD>
<LD>   The elk are easy to spot these days. They are either huddled in
nervous, thirsty herds or charred black, lying on their sides in the
gray ash.</LD>
<LD>   The homes seem much the same. There are the ones still standing,
almost awkwardly in the middle of a skeletonized forest. And there
are the ones, sometimes just across the road, that appear magically
transformed from a home into a hole.</LD>
<TE>   With the blaze finally withering under the onslaught of pickaxes
and rain, people are beginning to count the dead elk, calculate the
dollar value of the lost houses, study nearly every aspect of one of
the most devastating wildfires of the last two decades and the
largest in Arizona history.</TE>
<TE>   What everyone in these parts already knows is that it has been a
fascinating, humbling event: a 2,000-degree demonstration of nature's
duality--terrifyingly powerful and astoundingly beautiful at once.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a fire," one soot-covered man said with a sense of awe
after a day on the fire line. "That's a real fire."</TE>
<TE>   In a similar way, the blaze has left bare the communities,
exposing them for what they are: small mountain towns with
once-spectacular views whose residents are in the midst of trying
times.</TE>
<TE>   In the community of Eagar, near the New Mexico border--Mormon
country, as people like to say--some residents criticized members of
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for taking better
care of their own than of non-Mormons. The critics, it seems, hadn't
met the Mormon couple who welcomed 11 evacuated strangers of various
faiths into their home for nine days.</TE>
<TE>   Here in Payson, meanwhile, a man allegedly pilfered sleeping bags,
shampoo, canned food, clothing--a van full of supplies meant for
evacuees.</TE>
<TE>   And there's part-time firefighter Leonard Gregg, a member of the
White Mountain Apache tribe, accused of intentionally starting a
blaze that has devastated the economy of his already impoverished
community, the Fort Apache Indian Reservation. Destitute himself,
Gregg allegedly set the fire because he was desperate for the $8 an
hour he would earn fighting it, prosecutors say.</TE>
<TE>   Many who don't live here view Arizona as a desert--a mostly flat,
hot place with the occasional iron-red cliff, lakes Mead and Havasu,
and the Grand Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   A hundred miles northeast of Phoenix, though, the desert rises up
and becomes forest, with dense, cool stands of ponderosa pine and
streams so clear a fisherman often sees the rainbow trout hit his
fly.</TE>
<TE>   The Rodeo fire began June 18 on a mountainside between the two
Arizona extremes, a place on the reservation with scrub brush and
pines. In a single day it ran up the canyons near the town of
Cibecue, spread out across the ridges and became a six-mile line of
200-foot-tall flames.</TE>
<TE>   The smoke turned the sun into a red disk during the day, the moon
into a red disk at night.</TE>
<TE>   Then, on June 20, 15 miles to the northwest near Chediski Peak, a
lost hiker started a fire in an attempt to signal a passing
helicopter. Two days later the fires merged.</TE>
<TE>   Daylight diminished even more, getting as dark as during a solar
eclipse. At night, cool air from the upper atmosphere settled down on
the fire like a lid, holding in the smoke.</TE>
<TE>   "The monster," U.S. Forest Service spokesman Jim Paxon called the
inferno.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities ordered residents of Show Low, Pinedale, Linden,
Heber, Overgaard and other towns to evacuate.</TE>
<TE>   More than 30,000 people fled, many with only a few hours' notice
or less. In some cases, sheriff's deputies arrested those who refused
to leave, on charges of endangering the deputies' lives.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Powell, a 62-year-old former grocer on a run of tough luck,
had been living with relatives in the forest since spring. When a
ranger told them to go, they made their way to the middle school
here, like more than 800 others.</TE>
<TE>   They had almost no money, and they weren't getting along, Powell
said. When he went into the school to collect the $10 a local Indian
casino was giving each evacuee, he came out to find his relatives had
driven away.</TE>
<TE>   "They left me two bicycles and my dog," Powell said. Then he
started crying.</TE>
<TE>   Along with thousands of evacuees around the rim of the fire,
Powell took up residence in a gymnasium. The gyms became small
communities, with strangers sleeping next to one another on cots,
volunteer pianists plunking out ragtime tunes, massage therapists
working the kinks for free.</TE>
<TE>   The strangest of the makeshift towns, perhaps, was the one at
Eagar High School, where people slept beneath a massive, opaque
sports dome. Workers laid out more than an acre of artificial turf,
and life went on atop an oversize football field. The bleachers were
off-limits, so there were no fans, only players.</TE>
<TE>   At least one woman living in the dome gave birth. Two elderly
sisters arranged their cots as if they were sofas and giggled as they
invited people into their "living room."</TE>
<TE>   At another shelter, Red Cross workers said, an elderly woman died
in her sleep on a donated Barcalounger.</TE>
<TE>   The Rodeo-Chediski fire has been among the costliest wildfires of
the last 20 years. At its peak, battling the 469,320-acre blaze cost
$8 million a day. More than 4,500 firefighters rotated on and off the
lines in 12-hour shifts--if they were lucky. Three airfields were
needed to launch more than two dozen tanker planes and helicopters.</TE>
<TE>   The series of fires that swept through Yellowstone National Park
in the summer of 1988 were larger, scorching almost 1.6 million acres
in and around the park. Santa Barbara's Painted Cave Fire of 1990
burned more structures: 641.</TE>
<TE>   The most devastating blazes, everyone here knows, are the ones in
which people die. Twenty-five people perished in the 1991 Oakland
fires; 14 firefighters were killed in a blowup during the South
Canyon Fire in Colorado in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   There have been many others. Nine firefighters have died battling
wildfires so far this year, including one killed Tuesday by a falling
tree near Durango, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   No one has died yet as a result of this fire. The devastation,
however, has been great and wrenching.</TE>
<TE>   Word came Wednesday that the residents of Heber and Overgaard
could go home. Most people didn't know whether they even had homes to
return to. They knew only that Heber had done relatively well and
that Overgaard, just to the southeast, had lost the vast majority of
the 200 homes consumed in the area.</TE>
<TE>   As the cars and campers headed up Arizona Highway 260, winding
through burned forest then green forest then burned pines again, they
had their headlights on. It was a funeral procession of sorts,
acknowledging all that was lost.</TE>

<LD>   Water from the 45-year-old dam began flowing out of its
spillway--a 400-yard-wide earthen chute--and into the Guadalupe
River, about three-fourths of a mile downstream.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not going to take any chances," said Al Rose, as he and his
children loaded a van and two trailers with their belongings. "I'd
rather spend a few hundred dollars and get everything out than spend
thousands of dollars later."</TE>
<TE>   Lake manager Jerry Brite said the overflow could dump as much as
50,000 cubic feet of water per second into the river--more than 100
times the normal flow rate.</TE>
<TE>   South and Central Texas have been pounded by storms for almost a
week. In San Antonio, officials discovered two bodies Thursday in a
car in the Olmos Basin, bringing the death count from the storms to
at least seven.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, President Bush approved federal aid for 10
flood-damaged counties.</TE>
<TE>   "With this assistance, the recovery process can begin for families
and businesses devastated by heavy rains and flooding," Gov. Rick
Perry said.</TE>
<TE>   Some areas have received as much as 24 inches of rain in the last
week, and flood warnings were expected to be in effect through the
weekend. Perry declared a disaster Wednesday for 29 counties.</TE>
<TE>   Residents in neighborhoods along the Guadalupe and Comal rivers
were advised to leave.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a voluntary evacuation, but we thought it best to get out.
There will be a lot of water in the river in a very short period of
time, and they're not exactly [sure] where it's going to go, since it
will go over the spillway," Paul Klein, who lives near Canyon Dam,
told radio station WOAI.</TE>
<TE>   The Army Corps of Engineers began opening the dam's floodgates
Thursday morning to lower the water level, spokeswoman Judy Marsicano
said. They would be closed once water begins to flow over the
spillway.</TE>
<TE>   In San Antonio, low-lying areas remained covered with brown,
debris-laden runoff, but water levels were dropping steadily as rain
tapered off. City Manager Terry Brechtel said more than 200 homes
sustained flood damage.</TE>
<TE>   All highways into Bandera County northwest of San Antonio were
closed, Judge Richard Evans said. Hundreds of people were evacuated,
but about 1,500 people were stranded in outlying areas.</TE>
<TE>   "The city of Bandera is totally isolated," Evans said. "We can't
get out."</TE>

<HD>This 4th, 'More Awareness of What It's All About'</HD>
<DH>Holiday: Amid tightened security, New York pays tribute to
Sept. 11, and displays across the U.S. go on as promised.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHELLE MUNN and KIM MURPHY</AU>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Americans braved stifling heat and new terrorism
warnings Thursday to celebrate the first Fourth of July since the
Sept. 11 hijack attacks, as fireworks displays and small-town parades
unfolded without major incident across the country.</LD>
<LD>   Other than a shooting attack at Los Angeles International Airport
that left three people dead, a heavy police presence at celebrations
from Arizona to the national Mall helped provide a mainly safe
holiday.</LD>
<LD>   In New York, thousands gathered for Macy's Fourth of July
fireworks show in lower Manhattan. The event was dedicated to
American heroes and those who died Sept. 11. It featured 28,000
fireworks in a 90-minute ceremony near the Statue of Liberty. City
officials urged residents to turn out in force for the pageantry, but
they beefed up security to guard against a terrorist attack.</LD>
<TE>   A flight ban to 10,000 feet was enforced over Manhattan, major
highways were shut down near the event and bomb-sniffing dogs
patrolled the scene.</TE>
<TE>   In Seattle, police searched ice chests and picnic baskets as
spectators filed into a lakeside park celebration. In Houston, police
with dogs took the unusual step of conducting a predawn security
sweep at two parks slated for Fourth of July festivities.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, the thermometer climbed to 99 degrees, the hottest
Fourth of July since 1919. As the day wore on, the crowds grew,
though attendance was believed to be lower than in previous years.
There were minimal delays at security checkpoints throughout the
evening, and police reported nothing out of the ordinary.</TE>
<TE>   Fighter jets patrolled the skies, fences enclosed the Mall,
security cameras panned for suspicious activity and a force of 2,000
officers, some wearing fluorescent yellow vests marked "police,"
milled through the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "We needed to be here after Sept. 11. It was the patriotic thing
to do," said Donna Wagner, who came to the celebration with her
husband, Walt.</TE>
<TE>   "I am concerned about safety," added Sudeep Kumar, who brought his
wife and 8-year-old daughter to the festivities. "But I think the
security is good, and this is one of the safest areas. They're doing
a great job to protect us. It's a little inconvenient, but I'm
willing to go through that."</TE>
<TE>   The fireworks over the Mall began shortly after 9 p.m., and the
crowd oohed and aahed at the display. It began fairly traditionally
but quickly escalated to include peace signs, smiley faces and
three-dimensional pyrotechnics straight out of the special-effects
shop.</TE>
<TE>   Holly Shaffer, of Mar Vista, was in Washington for the annual
convention of the Daughters of the American Revolution. "It was worth
my while. It was wonderful.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a safer place to be than Los Angeles today."</TE>
<TE>   Except for the shooting in Los Angeles and a small plane that
crashed into a crowd at San Dimas, the major casualties of the day
appeared to be the fireworks injuries that plague July Fourth
celebrations every year.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the day unfolded with unease. The FBI issued a terrorist
bulletin that included a warning that an individual with "terrorist
ties" had downloaded information from a Web site about two U.S.
football stadiums. But President Bush, dropping in on the mountain
hamlet of Ripley, W.Va., before flying back for the capital's
celebration, struck a determined tone.</TE>
<TE>   "In the 226th year of our independence, we have seen that American
patriotism is still a living faith. We love our country only more
when she is threatened," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said the nation was
prepared for anything. "Throughout America, local law enforcement
agencies are exercising their discretion about how to beef up, step
up preventive measures. It's visible for all to see."</TE>
<TE>   On the Las Vegas Strip, thousands of people paid tribute by
viewing the Sept. 11 memorial that wraps around a 150-foot-tall
replica of the Statue of Liberty in front of the New York-New York
Hotel &amp; Casino. The wrought-iron fence in front of the statue was
covered with hundreds of fire and police department T-shirts from
around the country, many with prayers for the victims of the Sept. 11
attacks on the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   "We were on the World Trade Center observation deck on Sept. 2,"
said Bill Hooks of Fort Worth, "and today, we wanted to see this
memorial. We're a little nervous about being here today, but you
can't let terrorism stop you."</TE>
<TE>   Show Low, Ariz.--evacuated in the path of a raging wildfire only
days before--mounted its annual Fourth of July parade, with about
25,000 people crowding into the streets, waving flags and cheering. A
young girl waved a "Thank you!" poster as a line of firetrucks blared
sirens and flashed lights.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of residents of Shanksville, Pa., flocked to a hillside
overlooking the crash site of United Airlines Flight 93, which was
diverted from its intended target after it was hijacked Sept. 11. The
plane crashed instead into a vacant field, killing all 44 people on
board. The town held its first Fourth of July parade, led by a fire
engine paid for with donations after the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   In South Pasadena, a large crowd assembled for a parade amid a
maze of police barricades. A "scent evidence team" van with
bomb-sniffing dogs waited in the background.</TE>
<TE>   "Scared. That's how I'd describe it," said Michael Cunningham, who
has been to nearly all of the nine previous Independence Day parades.
"People are afraid. You can sense it."</TE>
<TE>   Many of those at the Southland celebration echoed a sentiment
expressed by partygoers across the country: that they were out waving
flags, despite vague apprehensions, because it seemed like the right
thing to do.</TE>
<TE>   "The country is a lot more united this year," said Mike Sandford,
the South Pasadena parade co-founder, who was dressed as Uncle Sam.
"We are more patriotic. We cooperate more together.... We should open
up and have a good time and not be ruled by [terrorists]. This is
what the Fourth of July is about: freedom--a celebration of who we
are and what we are about."</TE>
<TE>   Seattle's massive celebration went off without a hitch, despite a
warning by the FBI last week that the city was an "easy target" for
terrorists, with its relatively small police force.</TE>
<TE>   The city had nearly 600 officers on patrol at three parks where
people were gathered to watch fireworks, and it took the unusual step
of setting up a police operations center. The U.S. Coast Guard and
Harbor Patrol for the first time were strictly enforcing an exclusion
zone around the barges where fireworks were set off.</TE>
<TE>   Police spokesman Duane Fish downplayed the remarks by FBI special
agent Charles Mandigo about the relatively small number of officers
on the Seattle force, less than the national average based on the
city's population.</TE>
<TE>   "It's significant in terms of numbers, but that doesn't make us a
soft department in terms of preparation. Numbers don't always equate
to being prepared," Fish said.</TE>
<TE>   At Myrtle Edwards Park, Joane Binkley said she was not letting
concerns about terrorist attacks keep her home. "I'm going to watch
my back, but at the same time, this is a free country--and I'm going
to go."</TE>
<TE>   The alert authorities disclosed Thursday came from the FBI, which
said an individual with terrorist ties had downloaded information
about the Edward Jones Dome, home to the St. Louis Rams, and the RCA
Dome, used by the Indianapolis Colts.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI refused to identify the group the individual was connected
with, where the person was and whether information about other
stadiums or arenas was downloaded.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Benton of Valparaiso, Ind., who celebrated the holiday in Las
Vegas, said this Fourth of July had added meaning for him. "This
year, I have more awareness of what it's all about and what we've
gone through to get here. Nine-eleven brought us together and made me
more aware of our freedoms."</TE>

<HD>Arid Conditions Force Horse, Burro Roundup</HD>
<DH>Drought: Emergency herding has collected more than 300
equines in Nevada. They will be put up for adoption.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>COLD CREEK, Nev.</DL>
<LD>Wild horses and burros, symbols of the Old West, have roamed the flat
Nevada desert landscape for centuries. That same parched land now
threatens to become their graveyard.</LD>
<LD>   Relentless sun coupled with 100 rainless days make for a severe
drought season that's killing the wild animals' food.</LD>
<LD>   Conditions are so bad that the Bureau of Land Management has been
conducting emergency roundups for two weeks, gathering more than 300
animals in southern Nevada.</LD>
<TE>   It's the driest Gary McFadden has seen in his 11 years as a BLM
wild horse specialist in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   "They're out of feed and they're getting weak," McFadden said. "It
was less of a gamble to gather them now. We waited as long as we
thought we could."</TE>
<TE>   The hot, dry conditions are the same as those that have served as
incubators for wildfires throughout the West and prompted the BLM and
National Park Service to ban open flames in some camp areas.</TE>
<TE>   An emergency roundup soon will begin in Utah and possibly in
Wyoming and Arizona in coming months, said Lili Thomas, national BLM
specialist. In New Mexico, Santa Fe National Forest managers have
ordered most ranchers with grazing allotments on the forest to remove
some or all of their cattle by mid-July because of the worst forage
conditions in nearly half a century.</TE>
<TE>   "If it continues to be really hot and windy, there could be more
roundups all over," Thomas said. "We're constantly looking at water
holes and making sure there's enough forage."</TE>
<TE>   More than 48,600 wild burros and horses roam Montana, Oregon,
Nevada, California, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Wyoming, Idaho and
Colorado. Nevada is home to more than half, with 25,096.</TE>
<TE>   The BLM's last emergency roundup in southern Nevada was last year.
Officials had no plans for another roundup until next summer.</TE>
<TE>   The hills of Cold Creek were filled with the sound of a helicopter
during a recent roundup about 50 miles north of Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Clouds of dust kicked up by the hooves of running horses filled
the air as the animals, followed closely by the helicopter, made
their way into holding pens.</TE>
<TE>   "The lucky ones are coming off first," said Dave Sjaastad of the
BLM's herd management facility in Ridgecrest, Calif., where the
horses will be shipped.</TE>
<TE>   "So far they have been in quite respectable condition."</TE>
<TE>   The 57-acre facility serves California, Nevada and Arizona, and it
will be filled to its 1,100-animal capacity with horses by the end of
the season, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the animals will be taken to Ridgecrest to be treated,
inoculated and made available for adoption nationwide. Horses older
than 5 years are sent to a sanctuary in Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, 6,192 horses and burros were adopted in 2000, Thomas
said.</TE>

<HD>2 Pilots' Licenses Revoked by FAA</HD>
<DH>Aviation: The American West fliers are accused of operating
a passenger jet under the influence of alcohol. They can apply to get
their permits back after a year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Federal Aviation Administration announced Thursday that it had
revoked the licenses of two America West airline pilots who were
arrested Monday in Miami for operating a passenger jet under the
influence of alcohol.</LD>
<LD>   The order takes effect immediately, FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown
said. The two men--pilot Porter Cloyd, 44, and co-pilot Christopher
Hughes, 41--may reapply for new licenses in a year, she added.</LD>
<LD>   FAA regulations prohibit pilots from operating an aircraft or
performing other "safety-sensitive" functions within eight hours of
consuming alcohol or if they have an alcohol concentration in their
blood of 0.04 or higher.</LD>
<TE>   Cloyd and Hughes had blood-alcohol levels that were above the
legal limit of 0.08 in Florida, where they were scheduled to fly 124
passengers on an America West flight to Phoenix. Authorities were
alerted by a security screener who smelled alcohol on the pilots'
breath. The plane had left the gate, though had not yet taken off,
when the flight was called back.</TE>
<TE>   To renew their licenses, the two pilots would have to enter a
rehabilitation program and agree to continued testing and monitoring.
America West, which has a policy forbidding alcohol use within 12
hours of flying, announced Wednesday that both pilots had been fired.</TE>
<TE>   The case of Cloyd and Hughes is fairly unusual, according to the
FAA, which instituted a program in the 1970s to identify pilots who
might have substance abuse problems. A rehabilitation program with
follow-ups helps pilots and seven other "safety-sensitive" categories
of airline personnel get help rather than try to hide their problems,
Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   The FAA now requires all airlines to test pilots and other
categories of workers for substance abuse--including random testing,
post-accident testing, reasonable-suspicion-of-misuse testing, tests
after a return to duty and follow-ups after a return to duty.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, the FAA said, 10,257 random tests nationwide were
performed on pilots for alcohol abuse and five violations were
reported. Fifteen tests for reasonable suspicion found four
violations. But there were no violations found from 113 post-accident
tests, 32 follow-up tests and two return-to-duty tests, Brown added.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, there were nine violations among pilots. Before the Cloyd
and Hughes case, there were seven violations among pilots this year.
All, like the two America West pilots, were found on the basis of
reasonable suspicion.</TE>
<TE>   FAA officials claim that their program on substance abuse, which
relies on self-reporting and peer pressure, has a higher success rate
among pilots than in most other industries, Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   Cloyd had twice before been arrested on charges related to alcohol
abuse: In 2000, when he was sentenced to two years' probation for
disorderly conduct, and in 1998, for misdemeanor domestic assault on
his then-wife. He subsequently took an anger management course in
order to get the assault charge dropped, Arizona authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Both men now face a felony charge in Florida for operating an
aircraft under the influence of alcohol; each was also charged with
operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol. They were
released on $7,000 bond each and returned to their homes in Arizona.
If convicted, they could face up to five years in prison.</TE>

<HD>Powell Is Awarded Liberty Medal</HD>
<DH>Tribute: Secretary of State, at Independence Hall, is cited
for efforts in terrorism war and the battle for human rights.</DH>

<LD>PHILADELPHIA--Secretary of State Colin L. Powell was awarded the 2002
Philadelphia Liberty Medal on Thursday for his leadership in the war
on terrorism, his efforts in the Middle East and his concern for
human rights.</LD>
<LD>   Powell said the ceremony at Independence Hall was proof that the
nation's spirit had not been broken since the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks.</LD>
<LD>   "The terrorists thought that they could keep us from celebrating
the Fourth of July. They were wrong. We are here, and we will
remain," Powell said.</LD>
<TE>   Powell also asked all Americans to devote more time to public
service.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody can make the time to serve on a school board, volunteer
at a local shelter, mentor a kid who needs someone to care," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Powell, 65, rose from humble beginnings in Harlem to become the
nation's first black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1989.
He directed Operation Desert Storm in the Persian Gulf in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   He chaired a volunteer organization and wrote a bestselling
autobiography before being sworn in as secretary of State on Jan. 20,
2001.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia Mayor John F. Street called Powell "a warrior for
peace, a warrior for justice."</TE>
<TE>   "Colin Powell is driven by a conviction that the world must be
cleansed of hatred and restored to dignity," Street said.</TE>
<TE>   The Liberty Medal was established in 1988 to honor individuals or
organizations whose actions represent the founding principles of the
United States. Past recipients include former President Carter,
former Israeli Prime Minister (and now foreign minister) Shimon Peres
and the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall.</TE>
<TE>   The Liberty Medal is administered by Greater Philadelphia First, a
regional business and civic organization, and comes with a $100,000
prize.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KIRKWOOD, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>A sheriff's deputy was shot dead Thursday, possibly after confronting
burglars who had stolen weapons from a Pennsylvania shop, police
said.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Kevin J. Tarsia, 36, was shot in a parking lot in Kirkwood,
near the New York-Pennsylvania line.</LD>
<LD>   Just before the shooting, Pennsylvania police said someone used a
pickup truck to ram the front door of Mess's Fireworks in Great Bend,
Pa., five miles south of Kirkwood. The thieves fled with rifles and
handguns. The pickup was later recovered.</LD>
<TE>   A call to the fireworks store was not immediately returned.</TE>
<TE>   Tarsia, who lived in Kirkwood and worked for the sheriff for 13
years, was the first deputy killed in the line of duty since the
sheriff's department was founded in 1806.</TE>

<HD>Hussein's Stepson Has No Links to Terrorism, U.S. Believes</HD>
<DH>Security: He's being held in Florida on visa charges.
Officials want to ask him about his plans to go to the flight school
a Sept. 11 hijacker attended.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department said Thursday that the stepson
of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, now being held in Florida, is not
believed to be connected to any terrorist group or plot, despite his
interest in a course at a Florida flight school attended by one of
the participants in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Mohammed Nour al-Din Saffi, whose mother was forced to divorce her
husband and abandon her son in order to marry the Iraqi leader in the
early 1980s, is now a citizen of New Zealand.</LD>
<LD>   He was arrested by Immigration and Naturalization Service
officials Wednesday on visa violations and remains in INS custody
pending further investigation, an INS statement said Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   An FBI official said federal law enforcement agencies were
interested in talking to Saffi about why he came to the United
States. The FBI had been aware that Saffi had entered the country and
was monitoring his movements, the official added.</TE>
<TE>   But at least at this stage, U.S. officials say he is not suspected
of being involved in an anti-American scheme. "He is not considered
part of any terrorist activity at this time," according to the INS
statement.</TE>
<TE>   New Zealand authorities, who investigated Saffi after Sept. 11
after learning that he was Hussein's stepson, also said he was not
suspected of terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Saffi, who is employed by Air New Zealand, had planned to attend a
four-day Boeing 747 recertification course at the Miami flight
school, the INS said. It was the same flight school attended by Ziad
Jarrah, one of the men suspected of hijacking United Flight 93, which
crashed into a Pennsylvania field on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Saffi is being processed for deportation, an INS spokesman in
Miami told Associated Press. Saffi arrived in Miami after going
through Los Angeles International Airport on a flight from New
Zealand.</TE>
<TE>   His status as a tourist--his New Zealand passport enabled him to
enter the United States without obtaining a visa--does not allow him
to enroll in a school of any kind in the United States, INS officials
say.</TE>
<TE>   Saffi was arrested within 24 hours of arriving in Miami. The INS
has not said how agents learned of Saffi's plans to enroll in flight
school.</TE>
<TE>   Experts on Iraq claim that Saffi, who is 36, is a castoff of
Hussein with virtually no connections to the ruler or his family.</TE>
<TE>   He is the son of Samira Shahbandar, a former flight attendant who
was married to a senior official in Iraq's national airline when
Hussein became enamored of her and demanded that she divorce her
husband, according to Amatzia Baram, an expert on Iraq and Hussein's
family at the University of Haifa in Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Shahbandar became Hussein's second wife. They subsequently had a
son, Ali, who is now about 16. Saffi, following Muslim tradition,
remained with his father after the divorce.</TE>
<TE>   Saffi "was just a person with no particular connections to Saddam.
He stayed with the father's side of the family and Saddam had no
attachment to him," Baram said. "He was a private citizen and was
never a political or security figure, since he was not family."</TE>
<TE>   Baram described any fears of Saffi representing a threat to the
United States as "meaningless."</TE>
<TE>   "I really doubt he's connected with any plots or sabotage," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Saffi's standing also would be low even if he had been connected
to the Iraqi leader, since his mother has been supplanted by two
other women Hussein has married over the last decade. Hussein has
four wives now, Baram said.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>STATELINE, Nev.</DL>
<LD>Firefighters neared victory over a blaze that continued into the
Fourth of July at Lake Tahoe's tourist-jammed south shore that burned
nearly 700 acres of forest and narrowly missed many upscale homes and
condominiums.</LD>
<LD>   "We really did throw everything at it as quick as we could," said
Laura Williams, spokeswoman for the Sierra Front Fire Dispatch Center
in Minden, Nev.</LD>
<LD>   The assault paid off as about 650 hustling firefighters, aided by
calmer winds, managed to get a line around 60% of the burn area a day
after the fire broke out.</LD>
<TE>   After a massive attack Wednesday by ground crews, air tankers and
helicopters that dumped Tahoe water on hot spots, Forest Service
spokesman Rex Norman said the air tanker flights were halted Thursday
as the fire died down.</TE>
<TE>   Full containment was expected for Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "Luckily, there was hardly any wind," said Forest Service
spokeswoman Barbara Rebiskie. "Mother Nature did really well today."</TE>

<HD>FCC Steps Up Airwave Hunt</HD>
<DH>Wireless: Regulators have intensified the search for
bandwidth as carriers spend billions to expand calling capacity but
try to avert financial downfall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Federal regulators and industry officials have stepped up their
search for more airwaves for the beleaguered wireless industry as
carriers try to stave off the financial carnage that has engulfed the
rest of the telecom industry.</LD>
<LD>   A shortage of airwaves has forced Sprint PCS Group, VoiceStream
Wireless and other companies to borrow heavily to handle calls placed
by the nation's 128 million mobile phone users.</LD>
<LD>   Although wireless companies are spending nearly $10 billion this
year to expand calling capacity and provide new high-speed data
services, revenue per minute of mobile telephone use has plummeted to
14 cents, from 53 cents in 1992, according to industry figures.</LD>
<TE>   That's because the industry's titans, in an effort to gain market
share, have been underpricing their services relative to their costs.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a basic rule of economics: If you sell something for $1
that costs you $1.05, you can't make money," said Herschel Shosteck,
president of Shosteck Group, a Wheaton, Md., telecommunications
consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   A major spectrum expansion is critical if the industry is to avert
an erosion in the quality of cell phone service or a financial
meltdown in the next two years, analysts said. At stake are the pace
of innovation in a key industry sector and tens of thousands of jobs.
That's particularly true in California, the industry's nerve center
and home to Qualcomm Inc. and about 2,000 other wireless firms
employing 60,000 workers.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many types of events out there that could spell doom
for the industry," said Adam Zawel, an analyst for Cambridge,
Mass.-based Yankee Group, citing uncertain government policy, new
competing wireless technologies and the economy. "But there are also
still a heck of a lot of people out there without a cell phone,"
Zawel said. "The challenge is ... to get more phones into the market
and get everyone to use advanced wireless services," which generate
more revenue.</TE>
<TE>   In a controversial move to alleviate the crunch, the Federal
Communications Commission announced last week that it would auction
740 wireless licenses beginning Aug. 27. But those airwaves are
currently used by television broadcasters, and some wireless firms
and lawmakers have opposed an auction because carriers would then be
forced to spend years and hundreds of millions of dollars to relocate
broadcasters to other parts of the spectrum.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, those airwaves represent only about 78 megahertz of
spectrum, about one-third of the 200 MHz the industry says it needs
to satisfy wireless demand.</TE>
<TE>   "The wireless revolution is becoming a victim of its own success,"
said Thomas J. Sugrue, chief of the Federal Communications
Commission's wireless bureau. "The simple truth is that as our
society grows increasingly dependent on wireless technology and
services, spectrum demand is stressing the supply, and that has made
spectrum management difficult for government."</TE>
<TE>   This bleak picture is a stark contrast with two years ago, when
the wireless industry was flying high and aggressively building
networks and pursuing acquisitions. But carriers have since found it
more difficult to attract customers because most American consumers
who want a mobile phone now have one. The remaining 50% of Americans
who don't have one are mostly the elderly, the poor and children too
young to own a phone.</TE>
<TE>   Carriers have compounded their woes by following in the footsteps
of dot-com and fiber-optic entrepreneurs, borrowing too heavily and
building too aggressively in the face of slowing demand. The number
of mobile phone subscribers will increase 14% this year--an all-time
low rate, according to Prudential Securities Inc.</TE>
<TE>   With less business to go around, experts predict the industry will
shrink to no more than four major players within two years.</TE>
<TE>   One likely combination, industry experts said, involves the
nation's No. 3 carrier, AT&amp;T Wireless, and No. 2 Cingular Wireless,
which is owned by SBC Communications Inc. and BellSouth Corp. Because
their networks share similar technology, the two firms could save
billions of dollars by combining. Market leader Verizon Wireless
could achieve a similar synergy by acquiring No. 4 Sprint PCS,
experts said.</TE>
<TE>   But Sprint may still be wary of a deal after the Justice
Department's rejection of its proposed $115-billion merger with
WorldCom Inc. two years ago. And federal regulators are likely to be
skeptical of mergers that would leave 65% of the wireless market
controlled by two companies owned by the regional Bells. The fear is
that the Bells might then easily overwhelm the market's remaining two
weaker competitors, Nextel Communications Inc. and VoiceStream.</TE>
<TE>   The unpleasant options leave the industry's major players with
little choice but to hunker down, for now.</TE>
<TE>   Nextel, which is carrying $14 billion in debt, has slashed capital
spending 20% to $2 billion this year. But the company continues to
generate cash and remains hopeful that its "credit profile will
improve significantly over the next few years" from subscriber growth
and lower operating costs, Chief Financial Officer Paul Saleh said.</TE>
<TE>   Nextel hopes to keep afloat for the short term with $1 billion in
cash, a line of bank credit for $1.5 billion and other sources that
might provide as much as $5 billion more in capital if needed.</TE>
<TE>   Rival Sprint PCS faces a similar cash crunch. Though the company
added 4 million subscribers last year, it lost $1.25 billion in 2001
and recently reduced its 2002 wireless subscriber growth forecast by
10% to 15% from an earlier target of 3 million. Executives even have
hinted at selling assets to improve Sprint's balance sheets.</TE>
<TE>   "A lack of capital will continue to hamstring expansion plans,"
Sprint Corp. Chairman William E. Esry said in a speech at an Atlanta
trade show last month. But, he added, Sprint is still committed to
delivering a wireless network "where you can move from your office to
your home ... with total uninterrupted, fast and secure
communications."</TE>
<TE>   The diminutive cell phone seems an unlikely device to drive such
an ambitious strategy.</TE>
<TE>   When introduced 20 years ago, cell phones weighed as much as a
brick and cost more than $3,000. The FCC, which in 1982 set aside 40
MHz of spectrum for mobile phones--nearly seven times the amount used
by a single television station--believed it would take decades for
demand to exceed capacity, recalled Martin Cooper, a former project
manager at Motorola Inc. who is known as the father of cellular
phones for his pioneering work on the technology in the early 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   But the devices proved an immediate hit with on-the-go consumers
who reaped the benefits of a take-no-prisoners price war among
carriers. The demand forced the FCC to quadruple to 180 MHz the
amount of airwaves devoted to wireless services.</TE>
<TE>   The demand also has spawned a vicious upgrade cycle that has
forced carriers to spend billions of dollars each year on system
improvements. After building the initial analog phone system, for
instance, carriers spent billions more to add digital mobile phone
service. Now, with another costly upgrade in the works--this time for
high-speed Internet access--profits will elude the wireless industry
for at least two more years, predicts Roger Enter, a wireless analyst
for Yankee Group.</TE>
<TE>   But carriers are betting that consumers will flock to high-speed
phones, which will allow them to do such things as display maps for
travel directions, download audio files and use other potentially
lucrative subscriber services.</TE>
<TE>   However, even if high-speed wireless data appeal to consumers,
their growth probably will be constrained by the shortage of airwaves
that appears more dire now than it did only a few months ago.</TE>
<TE>   The industry has been seeking to double the amount of spectrum
allocated for wireless use. Carriers have been eyeing a 140-MHz swath
of airwaves in the 1710-MHz-to-1850-MHz band that the military is
using for defense operations, as well as a 190-MHz block of airwaves
being used by some of the nation's universities and churches for
educational television and wireless networking</TE>
<TE>   But in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the Pentagon
has strengthened its hold on its airwaves. In October, the Commerce
Department, which manages airwaves owned by the federal government,
removed all but about 45 MHz of the 140 MHz of military airwaves that
had been under consideration for possible commercial wireless use.
And the FCC said last year that it would not reallocate the schools'
and churches' airwaves to commercial wireless carriers. Those moves
come on top of an FCC decision to keep wireless carriers on the hook
for $16 billion worth of disputed wireless licenses the industry
won't be able to use for at least a year.</TE>
<TE>   Hawthorne, N.Y.-based NextWave Telecom Inc. originally acquired
the licenses for $4.7 billion at a 1996 FCC auction. But it failed to
pay for them and filed for bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   The FCC took the licenses back and re-auctioned them to Verizon
and 19 other carriers for $16 billion during a red-hot wireless
market last year. But the sale was thrown into question when NextWave
successfully sued to recover its licenses.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute is pending before the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   "The large carriers in the industry are between a rock and a hard
place," said S. Mark Tuller, general counsel for Verizon Wireless.</TE>
<TE>   "The FCC spectrum task force is a good idea. But when you talk
about spectrum policy, the NextWave issue is like the elephant in the
room. It has a paralyzing effect."</TE>
<TE>   The FCC formed a Spectrum Policy Task Force this month with an eye
toward freeing up more airwaves for wireless carriers. The Senate
Commerce Committee also recently held hearings to examine the issue.</TE>
<TE>   But cellular pioneer Cooper has been advocating that the industry
change its ways. His company, Arraycom Inc. of San Jose, has
petitioned the FCC to force carriers to use spectrum more
efficiently.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't take a genius to see that wireless carriers could get
all the spectrum they want and still not be able to serve the market"
at the price they are giving away service. "We need a sounder policy;
we just can't continue this [cell phone] spectrum grab."</TE>

<LD>After months of moves that could be called curious, questionable or
even silly, the only way to describe Dodger General Manager Dan
Evans' off-season right now is successful.</LD>
<LD>   It's not as if this season has been a best-case scenario for the
Dodgers, as if all their wishes came true. Their best pitcher has a
bad back. The third baseman hit better last year when he had a hole
in his abdomen. The second baseman is having trouble hitting the ball
and, lately, getting into the lineup.</LD>
<LD>   Outside of Shawn Green's power surge the last six weeks, the
recurring themes among what has gone right for the Dodgers and
enabled them to hop into first place in the National League West
midway through the season are the transactions made by Evans.</LD>
<TE>   Trading Gary Sheffield to the Atlanta Braves not only brought the
intended clubhouse alchemist in Brian Jordan, it netted an All-Star
pitcher in Odalis Perez.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii has already given the Dodgers a
victory for each million of the $11-million fee they paid for the
rights to negotiate with him.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers couldn't be sure which Omar Daal they'd receive when
they acquired him in a trade from the Philadelphia Phillies, but he
has been pitching more like the guy who was 16-9 with a 3.65
earned-run average in 1999 than the one who was 4-19 with a 6.14 ERA
in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Center fielder Dave Roberts has brought a real leadoff hitter back
to L.A.</TE>
<TE>   And after trading away apparent best closer candidate Matt Herges,
the Dodgers found a guy as fearsome as any bullpen-dweller on their
own roster: Eric Gagne.</TE>
<TE>   Throw in the glove of Cesar Izturis, who was obtained with Paul
Quantrill for Luke Prokopec, add the new life in Eric Karros' bat and
the Dodgers have one of the best records in the major leagues.</TE>
<TE>   "I give the scouts the credit," Evans said. "They recommended the
players."</TE>
<TE>   But he isn't about to propose a toast.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone within the organization who said it didn't feel good to be
in first place would be lying," Evans said. "It's been good for the
organization. But at the same time, everybody has to retain the focus
as to what we're trying to accomplish. Our goal is not to be in first
place now, it's to be in first place at the end of the season."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the long view was what was missing from Dodgerdom during the
winter, when Evans kept saying he had a plan and we all wondered if
that plan had anything to do with making the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "Criticism comes with the job," Evans said. "That's OK. One thing
I really benefited from is I had a lot of good bosses who explained
to me you just can't worry about the criticisms from people you don't
work with.</TE>
<TE>   "If your game plan doesn't work, I think you should be criticized.
A lot of people felt our off-season shopping should be done by end of
the winter meetings. We didn't have that mind-set. We didn't leave
Boston with a finished club. But we didn't have to play our first
ballgame for another four months."</TE>
<TE>   With the World Series champion Diamondbacks in their division, it
figured that the Dodgers' travel plans for success had to pass
through Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, the beginnings came on the road to Arizona,
somewhere along Interstate 10. Still jittery about flying in the
weeks after Sept. 11, Evans decided to drive with Manager Jim Tracy
to the first two games of the World Series in Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Evans had just been formally given the job after basically running
the club for the last three months of the season as an assistant to
Dave Wallace.</TE>
<TE>   He made only one move of consequence during that time, trading for
pitcher James Baldwin, and that wasn't nearly enough to get the
Dodgers to the pennant. But he also used that time to learn the inner
workings of his support staff and the personnel tendencies. Which
scouts were conservative, which ones were liberal, which ones would
speak up and which ones had to be pressed for an opinion.</TE>
<TE>   Now it was time to think ahead, with plenty of time in the car
with Tracy, nothing but pavement ahead and desert to the side.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew we wouldn't be interrupted," Evans said. "I knew we could
openly kick some things around. We started to see some things about
our club."</TE>
<TE>   They knew they had to improve the leadoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   They wanted to, in Evans' words, "diversify our rotation."
Although he appeared to take it literally by bringing in pitchers
from Venezuela, the Dominican Republic and Japan, he was talking
about bringing in different styles of pitchers, and, more important,
more left-handers. That's critical in a division that features
left-handed sluggers such as Barry Bonds, Todd Helton, Luis Gonzalez,
Larry Walker and Ryan Klesko.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Evans said, "We wanted to see if we could add some guys
who have been part of winning teams, guys who have been solid winning
guys."</TE>
<TE>   The result was such a good group of guys that when Evans left for
a 10-day trip through the minor league system, he discovered "I
really missed being around the club. They just have such a good
atmosphere."</TE>
<TE>   Halfway through the season, Evans' work isn't quite finished. With
such a thin margin separating the Dodgers, Diamondbacks and Giants at
the top of the division, he might need to make another move. They
could use another big bat so that Green doesn't have to supply all
the power.</TE>
<TE>   They also could shore up the middle relief corps. That could be as
simple as having Kevin Brown and Darren Dreifort come back from their
injuries, which would allow Daal to go back to the bullpen and
Dreifort to actually earn some of the $9 million he's getting this
year.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sitting back waiting for those two to come back," Evans
said. "They're coming off of surgeries. I'm trying to take the same
approach we had in the off-season, because you can't guarantee their
returns.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's something there, we'll explore it. But we don't have
any glaring weakness in our pitching staff.</TE>
<TE>   "You always want to improve. Every team has room for improvement.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a good club right now. If we think we can get better, we
will, we're not going to do things just to prove we can make a move."</TE>
<TE>   Evans has proved he can make a move. Or two. The Dodgers, somehow,
are in first place. Maybe it doesn't take a bunch of guys having
career years to overachieve. Maybe all it takes is one guy to have a
career year. The general manager.</TE>

<HD>Angels Show Little Sizzle</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Anaheim loses to Orioles, 7-2, before sellout
crowd. Glaus aggravates sprained ankle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the first day of July, the Angels were rolling merrily along, half
a game out of a playoff spot. By the Fourth of July, the Angels were
sputtering, their offense temporarily out of order and their slugging
third baseman injured.</LD>
<LD>   For the home team, there was nothing festive about Thursday's
holiday. In a game with an absence of clutch hitting and an excess of
sloppy fielding and inadequate relief pitching, the Angels lost to
the Baltimore Orioles, 7-2, before a sellout crowd of 43,342 at
Edison Field.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a bad game all the way around," Angel starter Kevin Appier
said.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels lost two of three games to the sub-.500 Orioles and
lost for the sixth time in 11 games. They fell five games behind the
Seattle Mariners in the American League West, their largest deficit
since May 18. The Angels also dropped 3 1/2 games behind the Boston
Red Sox in the wild-card standings.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're going to contend with Seattle and Oakland later on, we
need to win games like this and series like this," second baseman
Adam Kennedy said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always a concern if you get too far behind," infielder
Scott Spiezio said. "We're not there right now. But it would be nice
to put together a little bit of a streak."</TE>
<TE>   For the Angels, the most immediate concern is the condition of
third baseman Troy Glaus, who left the game in the sixth inning after
aggravating an injury. Glaus suffered a mildly sprained left ankle
Wednesday, when he crashed into an advertising panel while chasing a
pop foul, although he did not come out of that game.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels listed Glaus, who leads the team in runs scored and is
tied for the team lead in home runs, as day-to-day. Angel Manager
Mike Scioscia said Glaus was not sent for X-rays on the injured
ankle.</TE>
<TE>   "He just tweaked it a little bit," Scioscia said. "He'll be OK."</TE>
<TE>   If Glaus is seriously injured, the Angels could recall Shawn
Wooten from his minor league rehabilitation assignment.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels were shut out by 26-year-old rookie Rodrigo Lopez
Tuesday and were nearly shut out by 30-year-old rookie Travis
Driskill Thursday. They have failed to score in 30 of their last 32
innings.</TE>
<TE>   They went one for 12 with men in scoring position Thursday and two
for 25 in the series.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't been effective with runners in scoring position,
certainly," Scioscia said. "Consequently, we're not scoring runs."</TE>
<TE>   Scott Spiezio, who moved from first base to third after Glaus left
the game, made a terrific defensive play at first base but made one
error at third and could have been charged with another. Right
fielder Tim Salmon tried but failed to make a sliding catch of a line
drive. The Angels guessed correctly on a pitchout, but Jorge Fabregas
could not get the ball out of his glove in time to throw the runner
out.</TE>
<TE>   In one inning, the Orioles stole three bases against Fabregas and
reliever Lou Pote.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels needed four relievers to get the final eight outs. Scot
Shields retired the side in order in the ninth inning, but seven of
11 batters reached base against the trio of Pote, Scott Schoeneweis
and Dennis Cook.</TE>
<TE>   Appier pitched valiantly and certainly better than his numbers
indicated. But those numbers--five runs given up over 6 1/3
innings--boosted his earned-run average to a season-high 4.69.</TE>
<TE>   "I was far from perfect," Appier said, "but I didn't really throw
horribly."</TE>
<TE>   In his first nine starts this season, Appier went 5-1 with a 2.96
ERA. In the eight starts since, he is 1-6 with a 7.09 ERA.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels trailed, 3-0, after six innings, in no small part
because Appier got a pop fly and a strikeout after the Orioles had
runners on second and third with one out in the second inning.</TE>
<TE>   In the seventh inning, Appier gave up two singles, one that
caromed off the glove of Spiezio. The Angels summoned Schoeneweis,
who gave up a double that allowed both inherited runners to score.</TE>

<LD>Bernie Lincicome in the Rocky Mountain News: "John McEnroe loses me
three sentences into his autobiography. When McEnroe applies the
events of Sept. 11 to his life, national tragedy becomes another
incident like his divorce from Tatum O'Neal, his battles with Bjorn
Borg, his Davis Cup participation, his anger-management sessions.</LD>
<LD>   "It's obvious McEnroe's ego is beyond book binding and there are
still 337 pages to go.... Why would I bother with McEnroe's
self-examination other than to confirm that he is exactly as we
always thought he was: a brat, a punk, a weasel, a tennis player,
interchangeable identities?"</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who was the first Dodger to hit 40 or more home runs
in a season?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Snobbery: Greg Cote of the Miami Herald commenting on America's
fleeting interest in soccer: "We like our soccer in small, very
occasional doses....We not only don't like soccer, we're damned proud
of the fact.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what always gets me. Not that most Americans would prefer
a 90-minute root canal. That we take such great delight in our
disdain.</TE>
<TE>   "I love soccer, personally. Yet I feel like I'm at an A.A. meeting
making such an admission."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tennis opposites: Gary Shelton of the St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times,
noting the contrast at Wimbledon between Anna Kournikova and Martina
Navratilova:</TE>
<TE>   "One has kissed a lot of trophies. The other would like to sell
you some lipstick.... Kournikova has won 171 singles matches in her
career. Navratilova has won 170 singles titles.... Kournikova has
never won a singles title.</TE>
<TE>   "Once a promising teenager, Kournikova has become the WTA's
ultimate one-and-done player.... Guest appearances on Letterman last
longer."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Too eager: Colorado Rocky shortstop Juan Uribe batted .373 in
April, but his average has dipped to .247 since because of a lack of
patience.</TE>
<TE>   Said Manager Clint Hurdle: "Until he allows the pitcher to
actually let go of the ball before he takes a whack at it, he's going
to struggle."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   OK, it's his list: Jerry Greene of the Orlando Sentinel lists his
top 10 sporting heroes.</TE>
<TE>   Included are Steve Young, Satchel Paige, Arnold Palmer, Jack
Nicklaus and Nancy Lopez. Number one is a bit surprising: Don Shula.</TE>
<TE>   "The man sliced me apart more than once with his laser-vision
glare, but during the Dolphins' perfect season and beyond, he was
greatness personified."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's that bad: Frank Isola in the New York Daily News on the
unrewarding drafts of the Knicks over the years:</TE>
<TE>   "If the United States military drafted as poorly as the Knicks,
we'd all be speaking German today."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1947, Larry Doby became the American
League's first black player when he struck out as a pinch-hitter in a
6-5 loss at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Gil Hodges, 40, in 1951 when the club was in
Brooklyn.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Dave Kindred in the Sporting News: "The nation's
first drive-through barber shop must be in Milwaukee. How else to
explain Bud Selig's haircut?"</TE>

<HD>Dodger Bats Produce Only St. Louis Blues</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Ishii gets outpitched by Cardinal rookie Smith,
3-2. Vina saves day with stop in the ninth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Maybe it was the 96-degree heat, or the oppressive humidity, or the
fact they didn't arrive at their hotel here until 5:30 a.m. after
playing in Phoenix the night before, but the Dodgers, with the
exception of pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii, seemed as flat as much of the
Midwest terrain Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Ishii threw one of his best games of the season, giving up three
runs and four hits and striking out seven in six pitch-efficient
innings, but the offense wilted on a sweltering afternoon, managing
one hit in 11 at-bats with runners in scoring position in a 3-2 loss
to the St. Louis Cardinals before 39,421 in Busch Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Rookie right-hander Travis Smith, who moved into the rotation
after the stunning death of Darryl Kile on June 22, gave up one run
and seven hits in six innings, and second baseman Fernando Vina made
a game-saving diving stop in the ninth inning, as St. Louis increased
its lead over Cincinnati in the National League Central to three
games. The Dodgers' lead over Arizona in the West fell to 1 1/2
games.</LD>
<TE>   Cardinal center fielder Jim Edmonds slugged his 17th homer of the
season in the first inning, left fielder Albert Pujols hit his 19th
homer in the fourth, and Tino Martinez's sixth-inning sacrifice fly
was the difference.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Grudzielanek doubled and scored on Marquis Grissom's two-out
infield single in the seventh, pulling the Dodgers within 3-1, and
the Dodgers threatened in the ninth off closer Jason Isringhausen
when Cesar Izturis singled, Dave Hansen reached on an infield single,
and the runners advanced to second and third on Isringhausen's
throwing error.</TE>
<TE>   Grissom followed with a three-hop smash up the middle, but Vina, a
Gold Glove Award winner last season, made a backhand, diving stop on
the outfield grass and threw to first in time to retire Grissom.
Izturis scored on the play, but Hansen had to hold at third, where he
remained when Paul Lo Duca lined to right to end the game.</TE>
<TE>   "Vina made a heck of a play or else the game is tied with the
winning run on first base," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said. "We just
came up short."</TE>
<TE>   Smith, who began 2002 with two innings of major league experience
in seven seasons and was recalled from triple-A Memphis on June 27,
was not dominant--he struck out two and walked one--but he caught the
Dodgers on a good day.</TE>
<TE>   "We were sluggish--you could tell," Lo Duca said. "When you get in
at 6 a.m., there's going to be a lot of tired guys. That's not an
excuse. But sometimes when you're tired you swing at bad pitches you
don't normally swing at, or you try to do too much because you're
tired. That's what we did today."</TE>
<TE>   Though the humidity created a heat index of 106 degrees, Ishii
(11-5) kept his cool. The left-hander needed only 80 pitches to
complete six innings, and he pitched far more aggressively early in
the count.</TE>
<TE>   "That may have been his best performance since his [major league]
debut because he threw strikes and did not create additional
opportunities for the opposition," Tracy said. "We'll take what we
saw from him today on any day of the season."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii has lost his last three starts, but pitching coach Jim
Colborn said Thursday's game should provide a boost during a
well-deserved All-Star break.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the break will be good for him," Colborn said. "We don't
realize the stress that can build up from moving to another culture.
You need breaks to step back and refresh. I'm real proud of the way
he's competed in the first half. In some ways, it's more than I
expected. I thought it might take a while for him to be comfortable
here, but it hasn't."</TE>
<TE>   Smith, the Cardinal pitcher, is also going through an adjustment
period, as are all the Cardinals. As they leave their clubhouse every
day, they walk by Kile's locker, which still contains his game
jersey, hat, batting helmet, spikes and batting gloves.</TE>
<TE>   They are still grieving, still trying to come to grips with the
loss of their teammate, and no one bears that burden more than Smith,
a bespectacled 29-year-old whose boyish looks have earned him the
nickname "Harry Potter."</TE>
<TE>   "You never replace him--it's impossible," Smith said of Kile. "I'm
here to do what I can do to help the team, whether it's as a starter,
reliever, whatever. These guys have been fabulous. They need someone
to pitch, so that's why I'm here. They want me to help them, and I'm
going to do whatever I can."</TE>

<HD>Miller in Unison With Players</HD>

<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>He is 85, in the 20th summer of retirement, and his voice and
opinions in support of the union he built into one of the country's
most powerful remain as firm as ever, as rigidly insistent as at any
time in his 16 years as executive director of the Major League
Baseball Players Assn.</LD>
<LD>   Reached at his Manhattan apartment, Marvin Miller said that should
the sport experience a ninth work stoppage, an interruption in the
2002 season or postseason, it will be the result again of management
demands, an attempt by owners to have the union join them in cutting
future salary growth.</LD>
<LD>   Miller called it a "replay of everything I've seen" in baseball's
tumultuous labor history and "so atypical" again of labor disputes in
other industries--disputes in which it is usually the union making
demands--that "it's hard to describe and even harder to grasp."</LD>
<TE>   "For 30 years now, ever since the '72 pension fight, every dispute
that has led to a stoppage has been over issues raised by
management," Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like nothing we've seen [in any other industry]."</TE>
<TE>   Whether the owners alone were responsible for all eight work
stoppages is debatable. On that, Miller may be guilty of revisionist
history.</TE>
<TE>   There is one certainty: Although the union would be happy if the
current system continued, it is the owners' quest for increased
revenue sharing and a tax on high payrolls that has driven the
current bargaining negotiations--as intermittent and nonproductive as
they are--to the brink of a decision by the union on whether to set a
strike date and, if so, whether it should be in August, September or
beyond.</TE>
<TE>   Union officials and player representatives from each of the 30
teams will meet in Chicago on Monday to discuss the possibilities,
but the latest indication is that the players will delay setting a
date so as not to overshadow Tuesday's All-Star game.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it happens Monday or later, the setting of a strike date
might accelerate negotiations and provide the union with its only
option if owners declare an impasse and unilaterally implement new
work rules.</TE>
<TE>   But it might also leave fans convinced again that greedy players
would be responsible for any work stoppage.</TE>
<TE>   "No other conclusion is possible," Miller said when asked if he
felt it was the owners' intention from the start to implement. "And
if the union sets a strike date, we're going to get the usual, 'Oh
boy, the union wants more; what do they want now?'</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody will interpret it as the only defensive move the union can
make.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, the hope [in setting a date] is that the losses involved
in a long strike would make the owners think twice about the demands
they are making."</TE>
<TE>   What would Miller, who headed the union from 1966 until 1982 after
16 years with the United Steelworkers of America, recommend?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really not close enough to the situation," he said, "but my
feeling is that if the union and players feel there's no possibility
of a reasonable settlement, I think an [August] strike date would
make more sense than a later one.</TE>
<TE>   "If your object is to inflict some pain in the hope that you bring
[negotiating] reality to the front again, I think you do that earlier
than later [when there's still hope of saving the postseason].</TE>
<TE>   "On the other hand, if the union feels, for whatever reasons, this
is all a lot of foreplay and a settlement is possible, that's
different."</TE>
<TE>   In a wide-ranging interview, Miller:</TE>
<TE>   * Suggested that the NFL, NBA and NHL unions had basically sold
out to management by agreeing in their current labor contracts to
"join what amounts to a conspiracy with the employer to cut its
members' future salaries";</TE>
<TE>   * Said he is convinced, despite ownership laments about
competitive and revenue disparity, that this is a "golden age in
baseball";</TE>
<TE>   * Voiced puzzlement at how big-market clubs continue to back
bargaining proposals that will cost them significant revenue;</TE>
<TE>   * Expressed support of drug testing where there is probable cause
but said he opposed random testing for steroids or other substances
because it invades privacy, could be used for indiscriminate abuse by
management and "there is a little too much confidence in test
results. The number of false positives is alarming."</TE>
<TE>   * Accused Commissioner Bud Selig of obvious conflicts of interest,
saying it goes beyond the most obvious of those conflicts--his role
as commissioner and club owner. Selig has put his Milwaukee Brewers
in a blind trust, but Miller said that doesn't change the facts or
perspective.</TE>
<TE>   As owner of a "so-called have not" in baseball's revenue lexicon,
Miller said Selig is "using his position as commissioner to push for
a solution to baseball's so-called problems" that will directly
benefit his small-market team, which is a "textbook definition of a
conflict of interest."</TE>
<TE>   "And my puzzlement," Miller added, "is not so much about him but
how the so-called 'have' clubs continue to be quiet and go along with
this. A 'have' club has to be saying, 'Well, let's see now. We have
to be quiet under penalty of a major fine and we have to go along
with this commissioner's policies because, even though it may cause a
stoppage and severe loss of revenue to us, we have to agree to
support the policies because it will cost us even more money each
year through [the increase in] revenue sharing and the tax on
payrolls.' I've heard of win-win situations, but they're in a
lose-lose situation, and still they remain quiet."</TE>
<TE>   While Selig insists that management proposals would help the
entire industry, not just the small-market teams, the hardened Miller
comes from a lifetime of dealing with big business.</TE>
<TE>   He successfully led the baseball union out of a wilderness that
was decades of player abuse and restraint by the owners, who now
believe the pendulum has swung too far the other way.</TE>
<TE>   The current negotiations, however, can't be painted in either
black or white.</TE>
<TE>   If the owners, citing operating losses of $500 million last year
and debt of more than $3 billion, are prepared to risk another work
stoppage and court fight through unilateral implementation of new
work rules, the union's only option is to set a strike date.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the union's most recent negotiating stance has
been basically to avoid negotiating, leaving management proposals
unanswered.</TE>
<TE>   The union may be determined to maintain the current system,
avoiding a cap-like tax on payrolls and a revenue-sharing plan that
would significantly increase the $187 million that big-market clubs
are doling to their weaker brethren this year, but unless the union
offers meaningful proposals--counter or otherwise--it may be
enhancing the owners' future claim of a legal impasse.</TE>
<TE>   Miller said he chats with union successor Don Fehr occasionally
but is not privy to negotiation details.</TE>
<TE>   Nor, he said, does he have baseball's internal financial figures
"and I don't trust them when they're presented."</TE>
<TE>   But, citing record revenue of $3.5 billion, upward trends in all
the components making up that revenue (attendance is down 5% but
still expected to top 70 million) and--for the most part--spiraling
franchise values, the "usual measurements of any industry," Miller
said there is no evidence baseball is experiencing anything less than
a "golden age."</TE>
<TE>   And, he added, "Selig and the owners don't even seem to realize
it. All they do is talk down the business and the players. I call it
negative promotion."</TE>
<TE>   Miller also said that despite all of the management rhetoric about
financial instability and competitive imbalance, owners are basically
asking the union to join them in restraining a free market and
cutting future payroll, and any union short of a "company union,
which is what the football, basketball and hockey unions are now,"
should never be in that position.</TE>
<TE>   "By that I mean, a) there is no evidence it is needed and never
has been, and b) the payrolls are as high as they are substantially
because the owners unilaterally make the decision to sign players at
such figures," Miller said, pointing out that the union is concert
only to the minimum salary and, to an extent, salaries determined in
arbitration.</TE>
<TE>   "Given those facts," he continued, "it makes it virtually
impossible for the union to be party to a concerted attempt to cut
salaries lower than they would be if there was no union at all.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, [because of antitrust restrictions] it wouldn't be
possible for the owners to do any of the things they are proposing,
such as pooling revenue and putting a tax on payrolls, if there
wasn't a union.</TE>
<TE>   "So many people don't seem to understand the terrible position the
union is in."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, but a union whose constituency has an average salary of
$2.4 million always seems to do pretty well.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, it can be said that the union is 8-0 against the usually
divided owners, coming out of previous stoppages.</TE>
<TE>   It is also clear that the winning pitcher in many of the early
confrontations, even at 85, hasn't changed his delivery.*</TE>

<TE>   The Miller File</TE>
<TE>   Born: April 14, 1917 in Bronx, New York.</TE>
<TE>   Labor background: Three years at the National War Labor Relations
Board, then worked for the Machinist Union and the United Auto
Workers before working his way through the ranks in 16 years with the
United Steelworkers, to become that union's leading economist and
negotiator.</TE>
<TE>   Career in baseball: Elected head of the Major League Baseball
Players Assn. in 1966, serving in that capacity for 16 years.</TE>
<TE>   Accomplishments: A pioneer in the unionization of professional
athletes, he made gains at the bargaining table and educated players
who previously had accepted the owners' pronouncements on the
economics of the sport. Supported challenges to the reserve clause in
1975 that led to the era of free agency. Although unpopular with the
owners, and incurring the wrath of fans during two player strikes, he
earned respect for the fledgling union, as well as better salaries, a
much-improved pension plan and better working conditions. The average
salary increased during his tenure from $19,000 to $240,000.</TE>
<TE>   Work stoppages: Union's first strike, lasting 13 days at the
beginning of the 1972 season, occurred under his leadership, as did
the 50-day strike midway through the 1981 season.</TE>
<TE>   Post-baseball: Served for many years as an advisor to the union.
Recounted his experiences in baseball in his 1991 book "A Whole
Different Ball Game: The Sport and Business of Baseball."</TE>

<HD>Richter Decides It's Best to Remain With Rangers</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Goalie Mike Richter agreed to terms Thursday with the New York
Rangers, the only NHL team he has played for.</LD>
<LD>   Richter, 35, was 24-26-4 in 55 games last season, finishing with a
2.95 goals-against average, a .906 save percentage and two shutouts.</LD>
<LD>   Technically, the Rangers are signing Richter away from the
Edmonton Oilers, who acquired his rights from New York on Sunday
night, hours before he became an unrestricted free agent.</LD>
<TE>   The Oilers will receive a compensatory draft pick that the Rangers
would not have been eligible for had Richter signed elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Injuries have caused Richter, the winningest goalie in Ranger
history, to sit out 37 games the last two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   He needed reconstructive surgery on his left knee after the 2000
season, which caused him to sit out the first five games the next
season. Then, in February 2001, he injured his right knee and was
sidelined the final 23 games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Columbus Blue Jackets upgraded their blue line by signing
free-agent defensemen Scott Lachance and Luke Richardson.</TE>
<TE>   Lachance, 29, had one goal and 10 assists in 81 games with
Vancouver last season, but the 6-foot-1, 215-pounder had a plus/minus
rating of plus-15.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson, 32, has 15 years of NHL experience. The 6-4,
210-pounder had one goal, nine assists and a plus-18 rating in 72
games with Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Right wing Randy McKay, a free agent who split last season between
New Jersey and Dallas, signed a two-year contract with the Montreal
Canadiens.</TE>
<TE>   Motor Racing</TE>
<TE>   A lightning strike on the grounds at Daytona International
Speedway left eight people in need of medical attention.</TE>
<TE>   Track officials said employee Walter Williams and race fans
Richard Santora, Alfred and Mary Greene and Dwayne and Derek Decoux
were treated and released at care centers at the track.</TE>
<TE>   Qualifying for Saturday night's NASCAR Winston Cup Pepsi 400 was
later postponed and rescheduled for today at 7 a.m. PDT because of
heavy rain.</TE>
<TE>   Two other fans, Brian and Tina Decoux, were taken to nearby
Halifax Medical Center, where they were treated and released.</TE>
<TE>   About 1 p.m. PDT, a strong thunderstorm swept through Daytona
Beach, drenching the raceway and halting Winston Cup practice.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   A man surrendered to police in the shooting death of a 20-year-old
during a robbery at the home of Orlando Magic guard Troy Hudson.</TE>
<TE>   Kenthaddeus Taylor, 25, was charged with second-degree murder and
attempted home invasion after he told investigators that he was
involved in the shooting death Sunday of Carrick Reid, said Lt. Gary
Calhoun, a Maitland (Fla.) police spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Hudson was not at the house during the robbery and shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor was booked into the Orange County Jail and held without
bond.</TE>
<TE>   Calhoun said investigators had been looking for Taylor since he
was released from Halifax Medical Center in Daytona Beach on Sunday
night after being treated for gunshot wounds to a hand and hip.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Matthew Emmons of the United States came from behind to defeat
Espen Berg-Knutsen of Norway to win the world championship in the
rifle, prone position, from 50 meters at Lahti, Finland.</TE>
<TE>   Berg-Knutsen led with 598 points out of 600 going into the final,
but Emmons shot his last few rounds well and Berg-Knutsen faded to
third.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Olga Dovgun of Kazakstan tied the world record in winning the
women's rifle, prone position with 597 points.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. crews had mixed fortunes in second-round races in the Temple
Cup for college eights at the Henley Royal Regatta at
Henley-on-Thames, England.</TE>
<TE>   Harvard defeated University College of Dublin by one length and
Marist beat England's Reading University by three-quarters of a
length.</TE>
<TE>   However, Orange Coast College, which won its first race Wednesday
against Bristol of England by four lengths, lost to Queen's
University of Belfast by 2 3/4 lengths. Colgate lost by one length to
England's Oxford Brookes University and Yale lost to the University
of London by a length.</TE>
<TE>   Russia held off the United States for a 6-5 victory, its first win
of the season in World League water polo, at the National Aquatic
Center at Los Alamitos. Russia and the U.S. go to 1-2 in league play
and will meet again in the U.S. season finale on Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   Passings</TE>
<TE>   Earl Francis, the opening-day starter for the Pittsburgh Pirates
in 1963 and a rookie on their 1960 World Series championship team,
died Wednesday following a long illness.</TE>
<TE>   Francis, who was 66, died in the intensive care unit of UPMC
Presbyterian Hospital in Pittsburgh, where he was being treated for
diabetes.</TE>
<TE>   Francis was 16-23 with a 3.77 earned-run average in six major
league seasons.</TE>

<LD>Whether it was a Fourth of July gesture or a sincere statement,
veteran French cyclist Richard Virenque's Tour de France prediction
was a stunner.</LD>
<LD>   Thursday, Virenque said Americans could sweep the top three places
in cycling's premier event, naming three-time defending champion
Lance Armstrong and Armstrong's former U.S. Postal teammates Tyler
Hamilton and Levi Leipheimer as favorites to occupy the podium in
Paris.</LD>
<LD>   Armstrong termed Virenque's comments a compliment--"That would be
spectacular," he said--but was quick to issue a caution about the
trio's prospects for the 89th edition of the race, which begins
Saturday in this tiny, cycling-mad country.</LD>
<TE>   "There are a lot of guys in the race who want to be on the
podium," Armstrong said. "It's very competitive.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not guaranteed to be at the front. There could be somebody in
front of me. There could be 10 guys in front of me. That's why I
still get nervous before the Tour de France; that's why I prepare and
train so hard. The day you're not nervous is the day you lose."</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton, now a co-leader for the Denmark-based CSC Tiscali team,
demurred even more.</TE>
<TE>   "That would be something, but I think that would be a very
difficult task for all three," said the Massachusetts native, who was
one of Armstrong's chief support riders the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   During the last calendar year, U.S. riders have notched their best
results in Europe in more than a decade, landing on the podium in all
three of cycling's Grand Tours.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton finished second in last month's Tour of Italy despite
riding the last two weeks with a hairline shoulder fracture and a
torn tendon in the joint. Leipheimer, now riding for the Dutch team
Rabobank, finished third in the Tour of Spain last September.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like Levi came out of the blue," Hamilton said of
Leipheimer, who left his home in Montana to begin racing in Europe as
a teenager. "All the Americans you see doing well have really paid
their dues."</TE>
<TE>   In the absence of past Tour winners Marco Pantani of Italy and Jan
Ullrich of Germany, most observers are banking on the Texan to win
his fourth consecutive Tour title. Some even have predicted a boring
three weeks, with sprinters going for stage wins in the first week to
10 days and Armstrong dominating in the mountains as he has in each
of his three victories.</TE>
<TE>   However, Armstrong and others expect strong performances from
Spanish teams ONCE and Kelme, both deep with climbing and overall
talent. Other teams, such as Germany's Telekom, will build strategy
around their sprinters--but that means they may not be as willing to
help Postal chase down early breakaways.</TE>
<TE>   The jeopardy to Armstrong would come if a rider with climbing
ability got into one of those breakaways, was well-positioned midway
through the race and managed to hold his own with the champion in the
mountains. Postal, which features three new riders, could find itself
working harder than ever early on to prevent that from happening,
sapping the team's energy.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong also needs a continuation of his remarkable good fortune
over the last three years, during which he has been unimpeded by
major crashes, equipment problems or illness.</TE>
<TE>   The 2,036-mile course, one of the shortest in history, is a
thousand fewer miles than it was a decade ago. Organizers, aiming to
make the marathon event as suspenseful as possible, have gradually
decreased the distance while keeping the most challenging climbs.</TE>
<TE>   Another, less tangible factor is a belief that demanding even more
superhuman exploits than the race already does leads to more use of
performance-enhancing drugs that plague the sport.</TE>
<TE>   The 21-team field will roll counterclockwise as it does every
other year, west to Brittany, south along the Atlantic coast, east
through the Pyrenees and north over the Alps.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the mountain stages have been pushed a few days later
and the second individual time trial one day later, to the eve of the
largely ceremonial finish in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   "Every year, they try to make the course more challenging for the
past year's winner," Armstrong said. "That's their responsibility, to
keep the race exciting. I didn't take it personally.</TE>
<TE>   "The Tour de France is two long [individual] time trials, the Alps
and Pyrenees, and always finishes in Paris. And hopefully the best
man wins."</TE>

<HD>Sisters' 1-2 Punch Has a New Recipe</HD>
<DH>Wimbledon: Serena, Venus Williams win way to final, but
this time Serena assured of No. 1 ranking.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WIMBLEDON, England</DL>
<LD>Instead of referring to Wimbledon as simply Wimbledon, the Brits like
their shorthand neat and tidy. They often speak of it as SW19, which
is the location of this historic place.</LD>
<LD>   After Thursday, does SW stand for Serena Williams?</LD>
<LD>   It was at SW19 that Serena created another historic moment--which
seems to be a weekly occurrence--by becoming the No. 1 female player
in the world.</LD>
<TE>   For the first time, a sister will be replacing her sister at the
top.</TE>
<TE>   Not to mention that a sister again will be playing her sister in a
Grand Slam final, after Serena and Venus Williams each won their
semifinals Thursday to set up the championship match.</TE>
<TE>   No matter who wins the title, when the WTA's rankings are released
Monday, Serena will be No. 1 and her older sister Venus No. 2,
officially trading places.</TE>
<TE>   The sheer odds of this happening?</TE>
<TE>   "One in a million," Serena said.</TE>
<TE>   WTA tour officials intentionally did not tell her about the
prospect of becoming No. 1 after they did the math late Wednesday
night.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know going into the match," Serena Williams said.
"Normally, you guys [in the media] take the liberty to tell me. At
the French, I was actually a little nervous about being No. 2. No one
said anything to me, so I wasn't really looking at the points. I just
thought I was a little farther behind."</TE>
<TE>   Before the flip-flop at No. 1, there is a little more history, of
course. Venus and Serena will be playing in the Wimbledon final on
Saturday, the first time that siblings have met for a Wimbledon title
since Maud Watson defeated her sister Lillian in 1884.</TE>
<TE>   This will be the third time in 10 months that there has been an
all-Williams final in a Grand Slam event. Venus, who leads their
series, 5-3, won the U.S. Open in straight sets in September.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly four weeks ago, Serena beat Venus for the first time in a
Grand Slam event, winning the French Open final.</TE>
<TE>   At Paris, Serena needed three difficult sets to get past Jennifer
Capriati in the semifinals. The losing semifinalists at Wimbledon on
Thursday--No. 6-seeded Justine Henin of Belgium and No. 9 Amelie
Mauresmo of France--were unable to sustain any sort of momentum
against the hard-hitting brilliance of each Williams sister.</TE>
<TE>   In the first semifinal, top-seeded and two-time defending champion
Venus lost the first two games to Henin and immediately found her
second gear, winning, 6-3, 6-2. It was Venus' sixth victory in seven
matches with the Belgian.</TE>
<TE>   Said Venus, who has won 20 consecutive singles matches at
Wimbledon: "I think this was the best match I've played the whole
tournament, and the fact I did play a very good player who knows how
to play on grass. The intensity level was very high."</TE>
<TE>   Although it's difficult to quantify, Serena, perhaps, was even
more impressive in her semifinal, hitting seven aces in her 6-2, 6-1
victory over Mauresmo. The younger Williams' service has not been
broken in the last three matches, and she has not lost a set.</TE>
<TE>   From 2-2 in the first set, Williams won 10 of the final 11 games
of the match, including a riveting battle in the fifth game of the
second set on Mauresmo's serve. The game went to eight deuces, and
Mauresmo fought off seven break points before succumbing on the
eighth, trying every shot in her considerable arsenal.</TE>
<TE>   "I just knew I was going to have to pick up my game--I'd have to
be Serena Williams, you know," Williams said. "I haven't been being
Serena Williams. But today I have.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I had to take away her coming to the net by playing my
game, forcing her. It's going to be difficult coming in on a ball
that's coming a hundred miles an hour."</TE>
<TE>   It only served to widen the divide between the Williamses and the
rest of the field.</TE>
<TE>   Henin and Mauresmo, unlike former No. 1-ranked Martina Hingis,
have decent serves and can hit with power from the baseline. Yet
Henin, who reached the final here last year, losing to Venus Williams
in three sets, was run ragged on Thursday. Mauresmo, coming off one
of her best victories in more than three years--a determined,
well-executed effort against Capriati--tried a variety of game plans
against Williams, but little seemed to work.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Mauresmo nor Henin saw the all-Williams final as
particularly beneficial to the sport.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not good to see two sisters in the final," Henin said. "It's
tough for the public to see sisters play each other because they
don't know who to root for."</TE>
<TE>   Henin thinks the sisters find it difficult to have the same kind
of competitive hunger against each other that they have against
others.</TE>
<TE>   Said Mauresmo of the final matchup: "Well, to me, I think it's a
little bit sad for women's tennis. But maybe it's not the point of
view for everybody. First, I think people are going to get bored by
it. It was already final at the French Open. You know, I'm not
counting how many people since yesterday told me, 'We don't want
Williams final.' Some people think like this. Some people think it's
good. You know, everyone has a different opinion."</TE>
<TE>   The sisters are still sorting out the issues when they play in
these high-profile marquee matches.</TE>
<TE>   "A win's a win," Serena said. "You have to go there and fight. I
know Venus has beaten me a few times. She felt bad. Like when I beat
her at the French Open, I kind of felt like I wished there was
something she could have won too. But we did. We both walked out as
winners."</TE>
<TE>   The titles can't be shared, nor can the No. 1 spot.</TE>
<TE>   Serena was genuinely thrilled by her surprising arrival at the
top.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still waiting for the catch," she said. "There's always a
catch. I guess there's not. I'm very happy right now. I've worked
hard. I've worked really hard. I deserve it."</TE>

<HD>Yankees Stop Indians and Thome's Streak</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Raul Mondesi and Jason Giambi homered, Jim Thome didn't and Mike
Mussina had his best start in nearly a month.</LD>
<LD>   For all that went right for the New York Yankees, an injury to
Derek Jeter nearly ruined a perfect Fourth of July at Yankee Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   "It's scary," Manager Joe Torre said of seeing his star shortstop
lying in pain on the field.</LD>
<TE>   The fear subsided as Jeter walked off the field and the Yankees
won again, ending Thome's seven-game homer streak and beating the
Cleveland Indians, 7-1.</TE>
<TE>   "You like for them to last, but they don't go on forever," said
Thome, who finished one game shy of the major league record.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees held Thome in check, including in a key moment in the
seventh inning. With a 4-1 lead, reliever Mike Stanton retired him on
a routine fly to center with the bases loaded to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   Thome went hitless in three at-bats with an intentional walk as he
failed to match the record shared by Ken Griffey Jr., Don Mattingly
and Dale Long.</TE>
<TE>   Mondesi, acquired from Toronto Monday for Scott Wiggins, a
double-A reliever, hit his first Yankee homer leading off the second
inning against Chuck Finley (4-11) and had a run-scoring double in
the sixth. New York moved a season-high 22 games over .500.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 9, Toronto 5--Derek Lowe got his 12th victory as the Red
Sox completed their first five-game sweep in 13 years. Lowe (12-4)
yielded five runs--four earned--and seven hits in 6 2/3 innings at
Fenway Park.</TE>
<TE>   Nomar Garciaparra homered and drove in four runs for the Red Sox,
who had not swept a five-game series since Aug. 25-28, 1989, against
Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 2, Minnesota 1--John Olerud drove in both runs, hitting a
tiebreaking double in the eighth inning, in a meeting of AL division
leaders.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners have won nine consecutive games against the Twins,
who have lost six in a row at Safeco Field.</TE>
<TE>   Mark McLemore led off the bottom of the sixth with a triple to
center and scored on Olerud's sacrifice fly. Edgar Martinez pinch-hit
for McLemore in the eighth and walked. Charles Gipson pinch-ran and
scored on Olerud's double.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 11, Tampa Bay 8--Rafael Palmeiro hit a tiebreaking solo
homer in the eighth inning, helping the Rangers complete a three-game
sweep at Arlington, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Palmeiro led off the eighth and hit the first pitch from Travis
Harper (3-4). It was his 19th homer of the season and 466th of his
career. He moved out of a tie with Dave Winfield and into sole
possession of 22nd place on the career list.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 3, Kansas City 2--First baseman Raul Ibanez misplayed
Scott Hatteberg's bases-loaded grounder for an error in the bottom of
the ninth inning.</TE>
<TE>   With one out in the ninth, Royal closer Roberto Hernandez (1-1)
gave up a single to Terrence Long, walked Greg Myers and hit
pinch-hitter Olmedo Saenz with a pitch to load the bases. Ibanez, who
homered in the seventh to give the Royals a 2-1 lead, allowed two
runs to score with his error.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 6, Chicago 5--The Tigers scored four runs in the top of
the eighth inning enabling Steve Sparks to win for the first time
since May 29--a span of six starts. Sparks (4-8) gave up five runs
and four hits in seven innings.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Erstad Is Willing to Sign Extension Now</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Outfielder Darin Erstad said Thursday he is willing to forgo free
agency and sign a long-term contract extension with the Angels before
the end of the season.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm a loyal guy," he said. "The Angels have been good to me,
through the good times and the bad times. I have no intention of
going anywhere else."</LD>
<LD>   General Manager Bill Stoneman said--and Erstad acknowledged--that
the two sides had agreed last winter to defer contract talks until
the coming off-season. Erstad said he is not concerned about his
contract and would not mind if the Angels still wanted to wait. But
Erstad also said he is more comfortable with the idea of signing a
long-term contract to stay in Anaheim now than he was in the
off-season, or in spring training.</LD>
<TE>   Said Stoneman: "We love him. We hope he's here for a long time."</TE>
<TE>   Erstad, 28, was a finalist for the American League All-Star team.
He is hitting .310 with six home runs and 48 runs batted in, and he
ranks among league leaders in batting average, hits and stolen bases.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the leader of this team," pitcher Jarrod Washburn said. "I
don't think we can afford to lose him, for all the things he does on
the field and for his leadership. I think they need to do whatever
needs to get done to keep him here for a long time."</TE>
<TE>   Erstad agreed last winter to a one-year, $6.25-million contract.
An executive from another major league club suggested Erstad could be
in line for a contract similar to that of Oakland outfielder Jermaine
Dye.</TE>
<TE>   The A's signed Dye last winter for three years and $32 million.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In an age where baseball's popularity among youth already is
declining, Angel Manager Mike Scioscia is concerned that a strike or
lockout could so alienate youngsters--and their parents--that some
kids with major league potential might swear off the sport entirely.
The players' union could set a strike date at a board meeting Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what's disturbing about work stoppages: It definitely
impacts the popularity of baseball," Scioscia said. "If a youngster
is not going to ballgames because his dad is upset those guys are on
strike, it obviously affects the next generation of talent that comes
into the big leagues, because you'll lose some of it."</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Gagne Doesn't Need to Change</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>After Eric Gagne jumped ahead of Arizona's Quinton McCracken,
0-and-2, in the eighth inning Wednesday night, the Dodger closer
pumped two 97-mph fastballs at McCracken, who barely fouled them off.</LD>
<LD>   "I had a lot of defensive swings up there," McCracken said. "I'm
just looking and trying to react. The guy's throwing 100 mph, so
there's not much room for error."</LD>
<LD>   Gagne's next pitch was a changeup, which McCracken reached out and
poked into the right-field corner for a two-run triple that scored
the tying and go-ahead runs in the Diamondbacks' 5-3 victory and
tagged Gagne with his second blown save in 32 opportunities.</LD>
<TE>   Gagne's changeup has been devastating, baffling numerous hitters
who think it's a split-fingered fastball. But after McCracken failed
to catch up with Gagne's fastball Wednesday, the Diamondbacks were
surprised Gagne didn't stick with the heat.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes you wonder why he went with a changeup in that
situation," Arizona reliever Matt Mantei said.</TE>
<TE>   Some Dodgers were apparently thinking the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone popped off on the team bus [Wednesday night], wondering
why he threw a changeup," Dodger catcher Paul Lo Duca said, declining
to name the Dodger. "My argument was that no one said anything the
last 30 times [Gagne used the changeup successfully]."</TE>
<TE>   Gagne's third pitch is a cross between a slider and curve, but he
hasn't had to use it much. Though there is a danger of falling into
more predictable patterns when you rely heavily on only two pitches,
Lo Duca doesn't believe Gagne needs to expand his repertoire.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no need to use his slider/curve any more than he has
been," Lo Duca said. "He just didn't throw [the changeup] where he
wanted to Wednesday night, and [McCracken] hit a bloop triple."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Manager Jim Tracy will shuffle his rotation during the All-Star
break so that his two hottest pitchers, Hideo Nomo and Odalis Perez,
can open a four-game series against Arizona in Dodger Stadium next
Thursday and Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Ashby will start Saturday, Kazuhisa Ishii will pitch Sunday,
and Omar Daal will open a two-game series against St. Louis on July
15.</TE>
<TE>   In opening the second half with Nomo, who has won his last seven
decisions dating to May 12, including an eight-inning shutout of
Arizona on Monday night, Tracy is essentially tabbing the 33-year-old
right-hander as his ace, or at least a co-ace with Perez.</TE>
<TE>   "Do we turn our heads and not look at what Nomo did the other
night?" Tracy said. "He's starting to send the message, more and
more, that if it's a big-game situation, he's interested."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Though a Dodger trainer has advised against it, right fielder
Shawn Green is planning to participate in Monday's home run derby as
part of the All-Star festivities in Milwaukee. Green sat out games
Sunday and Monday because of a jammed left thumb but has played in
the last three games, homering Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "As of now, I'm going to do it unless the thumb acts up," Green
said. "If it's better in the next couple of days, I should be fine.
If it's not, I won't push it."</TE>

streak snapped Sunday, when he gave up five runs and seven hits in
seven innings of a 5-1 loss to the Angels. Morris, the Cardinal
right-hander, has a 2-0 record and 3.79 ERA against the Dodgers.</TE>

<HD>Galaxy's Ruiz Puts on a Show</HD>
<DH>Soccer: His second goal, a beauty in the 87th minute, gives
L.A. an important 2-1 victory over first-place San Jose.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The lights of the Rose Bowl dimmed, Carlos Ruiz stood on the floor of
the venerable stadium with his baby daughter in his arms and looked
up to the sky as the postgame Fourth of July fireworks show burst all
around.</LD>
<LD>   Joining the 55,234 in attendance in wide-mouthed wonder, Ruiz, the
Galaxy's rookie forward from Guatemala, was celebrating his first
Independence Day in his adopted home.</LD>
<LD>   Minutes earlier, it was Ruiz who elicited the oohs and aahs from
the fifth-largest crowd to take in a Galaxy home game.</LD>
<TE>   Ruiz's two goals, the second coming in the 87th minute, gave the
Galaxy a 2-1 come-from-behind victory over the first-place San Jose
Earthquakes.</TE>
<TE>   "It was important to get the win and create some positive momentum
for the Galaxy," said Ruiz, whose two scores were his first since
June 1 and gave him 12 on the season. Ruiz also moved into third
place among Major League Soccer scorers with 24 points, behind
Dallas' Jason Kreis (26) and New England's Taylor Twellman (25).</TE>
<TE>   "Now hopefully we can take the momentum forward and keep it
going."</TE>
<TE>   With the win, the Galaxy (7-6-2, 23 points) moved within six
points of the Earthquakes (9-5-2, 29 points). A loss would have put
the Galaxy in a 12-point hole and into a last-place tie with the
Kansas City Wizards. The teams meet again Sunday night in San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz's game-winner was set up when Danny Califf, who had entered
the game eight minutes earlier, inbounded a long, over-the-head pass
from the right sideline into the middle of the penalty box.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Albright headed the ball backward to Alexi Lalas, who
back-heeled a nifty pass to an oncoming Ruiz. Ruiz's left-footed kick
buried the ball into the net, past San Jose goalkeeper Joe Cannon.</TE>
<TE>   Lalas claimed that he knew Ruiz was behind him.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course," he laughed. "He was screaming his head off.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not really a set play because you certainly don't work on
it. There was a little desperation there at the end with the long
throw-in and Chris Albright ... hit a beautiful little flick and I
knew [Ruiz] was behind me. It's not the prettiest looking thing, but
it will do the trick.</TE>
<TE>   "We're athletes but we're also entertainers. Tonight was about
entertainment."</TE>
<TE>   The entertaining play also ended the Galaxy's three-game losing
streak to the Earthquakes, who beat them in overtime of last year's
MLS Cup title match.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz's first goal came in the 34th minute.</TE>
<TE>   With Gavin Glinton trapped in the right corner, he found Ezra
Hendrickson to his left. Hendrickson quickly passed to the middle of
the box, where Ruiz stepped in front of San Jose midfielder Manny
Lagos and headed the ball past Cannon.</TE>
<TE>   The Earthquakes had scored four minutes earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Ramiro Corrales lofted a high pass into the box from the left side
and Lagos leaped into the scrum, redirecting the ball into the net
with the outside of his right foot for his second goal of the season.</TE>
<TE>   It was the only shot to get by Galaxy goalkeeper Kevin Hartman,
who had seven saves, five in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Also having a good game for the Galaxy was midfielder Peter
Vagenas, who marked and shut out Earthquake forward Landon Donovan.</TE>
<TE>   "[The win] is very important for a couple of reasons," Galaxy
Coach Sigi Schmid said. "We didn't beat them last year so now we've
established [that we can] in their minds and also in our minds.</TE>
<TE>   "And now it also puts the onus on them that they need to take a
victory at home."</TE>

<KH>GOLF ROUNDUP</KH>
<HD>Webb Is History With Opening 79</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If there's history to be made at this U.S. Women's Open, it probably
won't come from Karrie Webb.</LD>
<LD>   Bidding to become the first woman to win three consecutive Opens,
Webb was blown away by hot afternoon winds at Hutchinson, Kan., and
finished with her worst round in seven years on the LPGA Tour, a
nine-over 79 that left her hopeful only of playing on the weekend.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm pretty shocked," Webb said. "I felt like I hadn't been on the
course."</LD>
<TE>   Juli Inkster played as if she owned it.</TE>
<TE>   Inkster, who won her first of three consecutive U.S. Women Amateur
titles at Prairie Dunes in 1980, birdied four of the first six holes
and finished with a 67 to share the lead with Laura Diaz and Shani
Waugh.</TE>
<TE>   Inkster, 42, is trying to become the oldest champion of the
Women's Open. Fay Crocker was 40 years 11 months when she won in
1955.</TE>
<TE>   Annika Sorenstam, playing in the same group as Inkster, also had
problems. Three consecutive bogeys on the back nine dropped her back
to even-par 70.</TE>
<TE>   It was the 17th consecutive round in which the 31-year-old Swede
failed to break 70 in the Women's Open, dating to the final round of
her second victory in a row in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   A 70 certainly was a solid score, only Sorenstam had reason to
expect much more. She tied Inkster for the lead at three under after
making a six-foot birdie on the par-three 10th, but then needed 18
putts over the final eight holes.</TE>
<TE>   By late afternoon, the sun began to bake the greens and a blustery
wind made scoring even more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Only six players finished the first round under par. Kim Saiki had
a bogey-free 68, with Lorie Kane and Catriona Matthew at 69.</TE>
<TE>   Se Ri Pak, who won the LPGA Championship on a difficult course
last month, bogeyed three of her first seven holes and closed with
two bogeys for a round of 74. She was paired with Webb.</TE>
<TE>   Webb had an eight-over 79 in the LPGA Championship five years ago.
Her previous worst score in a U.S. Open was a seven-over 78 at
Blackwolf Run in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The crushing hole for the 27-year-old Aussie was the par-three
fourth, where she hit into a bunker, blasted over the green and into
waist-high weeds, had to drop back into the bunker after declaring it
unplayable, and walked off with triple bogey.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   David Gossett, who got his first PGA Tour victory at last year's
John Deere Classic in Silvis, Ill., had nine birdies on his way to a
seven-under 65 to take the lead in the first round of the Western
Open at Lemont, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   "I certainly like the Chicagoland area and this is a great golf
course," he said. "I just played well today. There are three more
rounds, but it's nice to get off to a great start."</TE>
<TE>   He'll have to wait to see if it will hold up, though. The first
round will be completed this morning after rain interrupted play for
almost three hours in the afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   There were still 50 players on the course when play was stopped
because of darkness.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Estes finished his final hole after the horn blew, but it was
worth it to take the extra time. He birdied the par-five ninth and
finished at 66.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Darren Fichardt, beaten in a playoff at the Irish Open last week,
shared the first-round lead in the European Open at Straffan,
Ireland.</TE>
<TE>   His five-under-par 67 left him tied with Jarrod Moseley, one shot
in front of Michael Campbell, Jorge Berendt and Joakim Haeggman.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Norman and Colin Montgomerie each shot a three-under-par 69
to share fifth place.</TE>
<TE>   Montgomerie said he would have been delighted at the idea of a 69,
given his recent back problems. He completed last week's Irish Open
in pain but felt fine after getting his swing back into the proper
alignment.</TE>

<HD>Smith Gets Big Ride and American Victory</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>Mike Smith's riding fortunes were boosted this week before he ever
rode in a race. After Smith worked Came Home five furlongs Wednesday
morning at Santa Anita, trainer Paco Gonzalez named him to replace
the recently retired Chris McCarron on the colt for the $500,000
Swaps Stakes on July 14.</LD>
<LD>   Then Thursday the hits kept coming for Smith, who rode an old
friend, The Tin Man, to victory in the $150,000 American Handicap at
Hollywood Park. The Tin Man beat Devine Wind and Alex Solis by a
neck, then Smith and trainer Richard Mandella had to sweat out an
inquiry by the stewards, who allowed the result to stand.</LD>
<LD>   "When we were coming to the wire," Smith said, "my horse was
looking around so much, I went left-handed [with the whip] just to
shake him up a little bit. Alex was about two or three [horses] away
from me, and I was hoping that we'd get over to Alex a little bit, so
that my horse would see him and go on. That's what happened, but it
did get a little too close for comfort. There was no real contact,
nothing like a bump or anything like that."</LD>
<TE>   The Tin Man, running 1 1/8 miles on grass in 1:46 4/5, paid
$10.40. Devine Wind finished 1 1/2 lengths ahead of Kappa King, the
even-money favorite, and Native Desert, at 9 trying to become the
race's oldest winner, ran fourth in the seven-horse field.</TE>
<TE>   The victory ended a stakes drought for trainer Mandella, who
hadn't won an added-money race in almost three months.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier on the card, trainer Mel Stute ended an even longer stakes
void when he saddled Buffythecenterfold, a 6-1 shot, for a one-length
victory over Tricks Her in the $110,600 Landaluce. Ridden by Matt
Garcia, Buffythecenterfold added to her debut, a win against maidens
on June 15.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Good Journey, brought from behind by Pat Day, beat Morluc for a 1
1/4-length win in the $250,000 Firecracker Handicap at Churchill
Downs. Even The Score finished third.</TE>
<TE>   Good Journey, paying $6.40 as the second choice, ran one mile on
grass in 1:34 4/5.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-year-old hadn't run since winning the Citation Handicap at
Hollywood Park last November when trainer Wally Dollase shipped him
to Kentucky, where he won a prep for Thursday's race on June 15.
Since leaving France and joining Dollase in California in 2000, Good
Journey has five wins, two seconds and two thirds in nine starts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In 100-degree heat at Belmont Park, Owsley won the $250,000 New
York Handicap, right after Left Bank broke the track record with a
1:20 seven-furlong clocking in the $150,000 Tom Fool Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   Left Bank, paying $5.20 and ridden by John Velazquez, beat
Affirmed Success by 6 1/4 lengths.</TE>
<TE>   Owsley, a 4-1 shot ridden by Edgar Prado, beat Volga by a neck.
Janet, the shipper from Santa Anita, finished third.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lost At Sea, owned in part and trained by Jerry Hollendorfer, paid
$46 after outfinishing See How She Runs in the $150,000 Iowa Oaks at
Prairie Meadows. See How She Runs had gone into the day with a
five-race win streak.... The Jenine Sahadi-trained La Martina, owned
by Team Valor, won the $125,000 Walmac Lone Star Oaks.... In a
spectacular spill during the stretch run of Hollywood's seventh race,
Marcutio ducked through the inner rail, tearing up 56 feet of the
aluminum fence. The apprentice Omar Figueroa was carried off on a
stretcher and taken to Centinela Hospital, where he was being
examined for injuries to his right wrist and elbow and left forearm.
An outrider caught Marcutio not far from one of the infield lakes and
the 3-year-old gelding did not appear to be seriously injured....
Proud Girly broke down on the backstretch of the Landaluce, suffered
a fractured pelvis and was euthanized.</TE>

victory for her new connections in tonight's ninth, a $20,000 claimer
at 350 yards.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Charles Boylas and James Azevedo and trained by Paul
Jones, Crashin Bac was last after breaking slowly at 2-1 on May 5,
then rebounded with a solid second at 9-2 six weeks later. Despite
bobbling at the start, the 3-year-old Splash Bac filly was beaten by
only a neck by Al Paca.</LD>

retains the mount on Crashin Bac, who will leave from post four in
the field of six.</LD>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Janea's Dbldiamond. 2. Ageless. 3. Be Nice. 4.
Metamorphosis. 5. Wired To Win. 6. Ponderosa Ruby. 7. Cheer The
Royal. 8. Mary Blue Beduino. 9. Especialy Red Hot. 10. Double Timen.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use Janea's Dbldiamond and Continental Trail in the first,
Ageless, Ima Ham and Baby Loves Diamonds in the second, single Be
Nice in the third and Metamorphosis, Willow Talk and Traffic
Attraction in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Juan Gordito could improve in the fifth as he
switches to jockey Alex Bautista. Momma Is A Moviestar is a firster
in the sixth for sharp trainer R C Howell.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Looking to ride the wave of popularity created by the United States'
run in the World Cup, Major League Soccer has altered its All-Star
game.</LD>
<LD>   Rather than the usual all-MLS inclusive match, a collection of MLS
All-Stars, who will be voted in by fans, players, coaches and media,
will play the U.S. national team on Aug. 3 at RFK Stadium in
Washington.</LD>
<LD>   "All of America and a generation of soccer fans have waited a
lifetime for a magical World Cup performance like this," MLS
Commissioner Don Garber said of the U.S. advancing to the
quarterfinals for the first time in 70 years.</LD>
<TE>   "This U.S. team achieved great things for our sport during their
impressive run in South Korea and Major League Soccer wants to
celebrate this achievement."</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition will also give some MLS players a chance they
otherwise wouldn't have had at becoming All-Stars as 11 members of
the U.S. national team play for MLS clubs.</TE>

<HD>NHRA Keeps Tracks Open to the Public</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It has been more than 50 years since Wally Parks formed the National
Hot Rod Assn., its main premise to get hot rodders off the streets
and into a controlled environment where they could indulge their "me
against you" racing urges without endangering others.</LD>
<LD>   The Glendora-based NHRA has grown into the world's largest
motorsports sanctioning body, with 80,000 members, 130 member tracks
and a $50-million racing series, but it still holds true to its
original plan of providing racing space for would-be street rodders.</LD>
<LD>   Three NHRA sanctioned drag strips in Southern
California--California Speedway in Fontana, Irwindale Speedway and
Los Angeles County Raceway in Palmdale--have scheduled times for
inexpensive street-legal "run what you brung" racing.</LD>
<TE>   "We had heard repeatedly about the increase in drag racing on our
city streets and the dangers posed by this," said Bill Miller,
California Speedway president. "A number of recent traffic fatalities
have been linked to illegal drag racing on city streets. We hope by
giving people a designated time and place, we can get them off the
streets."</TE>
<TE>   The three tracks offer a variety of conditions.</TE>
<TE>   California Speedway has a quarter-mile strip with a low limit of
10 seconds elapsed time, which equates to about 135 mph in the
fastest cars.</TE>
<TE>   Irwindale is an eighth-mile, also with speed limits. LACR is a
quarter-mile facility where cars range from clunkers seen on the
freeways to jet dragsters that can hit 314 mph.</TE>
<TE>   The LACR has what it calls "grudge racing" Wednesday and Friday
nights. Irwindale has "test and tune nights" on Thursdays. Racing at
Fontana is on specified weekends, all in the daytime. The next one is
July 13-14.</TE>
<TE>   "It's surprising, and not something we planned, but American
muscle cars seem to dominate on Saturdays, with mostly imports on
Sunday," said Dennis Bickmeier of the California Speedway staff.
"We've been getting 350-400 cars a day and about 1,000 spectators."</TE>
<TE>   Street-legal racing, as prescribed by the NHRA, "features time
trials and grudge racing only, which ensures each participant the
opportunity for a maximum number of passes down the drag strip."</TE>
<TE>   Some street-legal events require mufflers and tires approved by
the Department of Transportation, whereas others permit open exhausts
and/or drag slicks. All have strict safety rules. For instance, at
Fontana and Palmdale, a helmet is mandatory if a vehicle is faster
than 13.99 seconds for the quarter-mile, at Irwindale if under 8.6
seconds for the eighth-mile.</TE>
<TE>   Costs are minimal, $20 to race and $10 to watch at Fontana and
Irwindale, $15 to race and $5 to watch at Palmdale.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a lot of skeptics when we announced our eighth-mile drag
strip, people saying it would never work, but the response has been
overwhelming," said Doug Stokes, Irwindale spokesman. "The other
night, there were 85 cars in line, waiting for their chance to run
the 660 feet as fast as their car would go, and there were another
120 cars in the pits.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know where the racers come from. Last Thursday, a woman
in her 40s showed up with a new Saturn--still had the sticker on--and
she made two runs. She said when she was a girl, her brothers raced
at the old Irwindale track but they wouldn't let her race so when she
heard about our place, she came out, took two runs, and said she had
satisfied her dream of drag racing."</TE>
<TE>   Once a month, on a Sunday, Irwindale holds a competition that is
part of the Summit Racing Series, in which drivers in several classes
accumulate points toward the national finals, Oct. 10-13, at the Top
Gun Raceway in Fallon, Nev. Team Irwindale will be represented by 48
vehicles, four alternates and eight high school students in the
Fallon runoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The next Summit series racing is scheduled July 21.</TE>
<TE>   The LACR has weekend racing for clubs or professionals through
December. Many NHRA Powerade series competitors test on the Palmdale
strip.</TE>
<TE>   The Irwindale and Palmdale tracks also have junior drag racing
programs once a month for drivers from 8 to 17 in one-half scale
dragsters.</TE>
<TE>   Details: California Speedway, (909) 429-5200; Irwindale Speedway,

<TE>   Last year at this time, Dale Earnhardt Jr., in his first return to
the Daytona track where his father had been killed five months
earlier, won the Pepsi 400, one of the most dramatic races in NASCAR
Winston Cup history.</TE>
<TE>   "The team will never forget last year's win," Earnhardt said. "We
had so much on our minds, and to go out and win like we did was a
great help to the whole team, and the entire DEI organization too."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Waltrip, his Dale Earnhardt Inc. teammate, finished
second.</TE>
<TE>   "We're having a poor season right now, but it's nothing like the
nightmare we all went through last year," Earnhardt said. "To win
again [Saturday night] would launch us into the second half of the
season, just like last year's win did. And we'll have a
baseball-theme paint job again."</TE>
<TE>   Earnhardt's No. 8 carried a special paint scheme celebrating
baseball's All-Star game last year. Budweiser, his sponsor and the
official beer of Major League Baseball and NASCAR, as well, has
decided to celebrate Tuesday's game in the same way.</TE>
<TE>   The Pepsi 400 will be the first of 20 consecutive weekends of
racing for Winston Cup teams.</TE>
<TE>   Perris Auto Speedway</TE>
<TE>   Dwarf cars, scaled down versions of 1930s and 1940s coupes, will
run their U.S. Nationals tonight and Saturday night on Perris'
half-mile clay oval. Close to 150 of them are expected, with Jim
Scribellito of El Cajon the defending champion. Also on the program
will be lightning sprints, mini versions of the popular World of
Outlaws winged sprint cars. Both the dwarfs and lightnings are
powered by motorcycle engines.</TE>
<TE>   Heats tonight will set the fields of Saturday night's 20-lap
championship events.</TE>
<TE>   Track president Don Kazarian announced a record purse of $100,830
for the Budweiser-Temecula Valley Pipe and Supply-Barrett Homes Oval
Nationals on Oct. 31-Nov. 1-2. The winner's payout of $30,000 will be
one of the largest in non-winged sprint car history. More than 90
cars are expected.</TE>
<TE>   Irwindale Speedway</TE>
<TE>   After playing to a turn-away crowd of more than 6,500 last week,
the NASCAR super late models will return Saturday night for a 75-lap
main event, plus shorter main events for late models, American race
trucks and legend cars.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday night will also mark the beginning of Irwindale's
"Christmas in July" celebration in which the track will collect toys
donated to the L.A. County Fire Fighters and the L.A. County
Department of Children and Family Services' annual "Spark of Love"
program. Every fan bringing a new, unwrapped toy of $15 value or more
will receive a $5 gift certificate good for admission or use at the
track's concession booths.</TE>
<TE>   Last Laps</TE>
<TE>   Motorcycle road-racing champion Eddie Lawson and the late Dale
Earnhardt are the latest inductees into the Motorsports Hall of Fame
in Novi, Mich. Others selected in the hall's 14th year include
two-time Indianapolis 500 winner Gordon Johncock, drag racer Eddie
Hill, road racer Brian Redman, and posthumously, engine builder Fred
Offenhauser, racing pioneer Gaston Chevrolet and stunt pilot Paul
Mantz.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura Raceway, Orange Show Speedway in San Bernardino and Costa
Mesa Speedway will all be dark this weekend.</TE>

<HD>Astros Finally Living Up to Expectations</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This is how the Houston Astros expected to play all season. They
might soon find out if they've waited until it was too late.</LD>
<LD>   Lance Berkman drove in three runs and the Astros, finally playing
like the National League Central contenders they were projected to
be, won for the seventh time in nine games by beating the Pittsburgh
Pirates, 8-6, Thursday at PNC Park in Pittsburgh. The victory enabled
them to remain 7 1/2 games behind the St. Louis Cardinals.</LD>
<LD>   Berkman's two-run double highlighted a five-run third inning
against Joe Beimel (1-3). He added another run-scoring double in the
fifth as the Astros overcame a pair of two-run homers by Brian Giles.</LD>
<TE>   "This was a good time to pick it up offensively because our
rotation is a little dinged up right now," Berkman said</TE>
<TE>   Berkman leads the majors with 78 runs batted in, nine in his last
three games. He drove in five runs in a 6-5 victory Tuesday in
Cincinnati and added another RBI in an 11-4 win over the Reds
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 5, Cincinnati 4--The Brewers lost their first seven
games against the Reds this season, getting outscored 48-20, and were
only 2-46 when trailing after eight innings before they rallied in
their last at-bat against Danny Graves at Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to protect a 4-3 lead, Graves (3-3) gave up singles to
Robert Machado and Alex Sanchez. With two out, Eric Young then
doubled to the gap in left-center with both runners scoring easily.</TE>
<TE>   Graves blew a save for the sixth time in 31 chances, leaving
Cincinnati with its third straight loss. The Reds have lost 14 of 19
home games.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 5, Chicago 1--The Braves won for the 13th time in 15 games
at Atlanta and improved to 54-31, tying them with Seattle for the
best record in the majors. The Cubs lost for the eighth time in 10
games.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Prior (2-2) gave up only three hits in six innings but
allowed a leadoff single to Chipper Jones in the bottom of the
seventh and hit Andruw Jones with a 1-2 pitch. After Vinny Castilla
popped to third, Javy Lopez lined a double off the base of the wall
in right-center for a 2-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 2, Philadelphia 1--Brad Wilkerson hit a two-out, two-run
homer off Jose Mesa in the top of the ninth inning at Philadelphia,
the Expos' first hit since the fourth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Mesa (2-5) relieved to start the ninth and walked Brian Schneider.
After Mike Mordecai sacrificed and with Jose Macias at the plate,
Philadelphia tried a hidden-ball trick with second baseman Tomas
Perez tagging Schneider.</TE>
<TE>   Second-base umpire Brian Runge called Schneider out, but after
Montreal Manager Frank Robinson talked to crew chief Tim McClelland,
who was behind the plate, the call was reversed, with McClelland
ruling time had been called.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 9, New York 7--The Marlins defeated Al Leiter for the
third time this season after having won only once in their previous
nine games against him. At Miami, Marlin starter Julian Tavarez (7-4)
won for the sixth time in his last nine starts.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Piazza hit his 18th homer for the Mets, giving him three home
runs in his last two games. Tavarez yielded five runs and nine hits
in six innings. Leiter (8-7) gave up six runs--one earned--and eight
hits in five innings.</TE>

<HD>Anderson Pitching In for Arizona</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Left-hander beats Giants for his second
consecutive win, helping Diamondbacks move within 11/2 games of
Dodgers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Brian Anderson went 17 starts without a victory. Now he has won two
in a row for the first time in more than a year.</LD>
<LD>   The left-hander yielded two runs and four hits in seven innings in
the Arizona Diamondbacks' 6-3 victory over the San Francisco Giants
Thursday to improve to 3-1 in his last four starts.</LD>
<LD>   Anderson last won consecutive starts on May 17 and May 22 of last
season, at Cincinnati and at home against San Francisco.</LD>
<TE>   "He was fantastic today," Arizona Manager Bob Brenly said. "He had
tremendous control. He was working the corners well.</TE>
<TE>   "Even when he was forced because of the count to throw the ball
down the middle of the plate, he had enough movement and enough
difference in speed to get some off-balance hits. That was just what
we needed today."</TE>
<TE>   Don't expect Anderson (4-7) to get carried away with success,
though.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't say I'm on a roll. I wouldn't say that at all," he
said. "I think you get on a roll after a month, month and a half of
pretty consistent outings."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson said adding a cutter and a "slurve" and dropping the
slider from his limited arsenal of fastball-changeup over the last
two outings has helped considerably.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that I'm more confident in my abilities," he said, "but
more confident in that I feel that I have a couple of more weapons
that I didn't have before."</TE>
<TE>   Byung-Hyun Kim got three outs for his 22nd save in 25
opportunities, helping Arizona close within 1 1/2 games of the
Dodgers in the NL West.</TE>
<TE>   Junior Spivey, one of six Diamondback players selected by Brenly
for Tuesday's All-Star game in Milwaukee, extended his hitting streak
to 18 games, the longest active streak in the majors. The second
baseman drove in one run and scored another.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Finley had two hits in three at-bats with an RBI and scored
twice for the Diamondbacks in the opener of a four-game series.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Counsell's two-run single highlighted Arizona's four-run
third inning off Jason Schmidt (4-3). The bases-loaded hit just past
shortstop Rich Aurilia gave Counsell a career-high 41 RBIs.</TE>

<HD>Cabo Pulmo Is a Pearl in Sea of Cortez</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETE THOMAS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>LOS BARILLES, Mexico</DL>
<LD>There's a sprawling blue bay about 20 miles south of this small Baja
California town, a haven for colorful creatures both wild and
wonderful.</LD>
<LD>   Tourists from as far north as La Paz and as far south as Cabo San
Lucas are brought there to swim among the creatures and to marvel at
what a little protection can do for an ecosystem.</LD>
<LD>   On a recent boat trip to Cabo Pulmo National Marine Park, with
Mark Rayor of Vista Sea Sport (www.vistaseasport.com) in nearby Buena
Vista, a group of divers took the backward plunge over the rail and
followed the sun's rays down, only to find that rays of a different
sort were following them.</LD>
<TE>   They were bat rays, about 10 of them, shy but curious, hovering in
the distant haze like alien space vessels suspended in flight. They
watched the bubble-blowing intruders for only a few moments, then
turned as one and, with a few flaps of their wing-like fins, blended
back into their shadowy surroundings.</TE>
<TE>   The divers continued downward to about 45 feet, to a coral floor
teeming with reef fish and harboring dozens of green morays, holed up
in their classic ambush position, champing at water as they waited
for something more substantial to pass.</TE>
<TE>   Most amazing, though, were giant groupers, some measuring five
feet and weighing more than 200 pounds. They were encountered at
almost every turn, poised almost motionless just above the reef,
pointed in various directions as if on sentry duty, which, in a way,
they were.</TE>
<TE>   After the dive, Rayor and John Ireland, owner of Rancho Leonero
Resort (www.rancholeonero.com), explained that these magnificent
behemoths, so powerful and yet so vulnerable to fishing pressure, had
all but disappeared before the establishment of the reserve in 1995,
an area 10 miles long and extending three miles out where neither
commercial fishing nor sportfishing is allowed.</TE>
<TE>   Now the groupers are back, as are many other species of fish that
have taken up residence in the reserve, which features nearly a dozen
dive sites and boasts visibility ranging from 30 to 80 feet.</TE>
<TE>   Even more remarkable than the comeback of the groupers, Rayor
said, is the seasonal presence of hammerhead sharks.</TE>
<TE>   "We never used to see them, and now we're seeing more and more. In
fact, they're starting to become predictable," he said.</TE>
<TE>   This at a time when sightings of schooling sharks at other Sea of
Cortez dive sites, such as El Bajo to the north and Gordo Banks to
the south, are occurring less frequently. Sharks are among many
embattled sea creatures in the Sea of Cortez, victims of overfishing
and the indiscriminate nature of gillnets and long-line gear.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be that Cabo Pulmo was not any more special than any
of the other dive sites we go to because there were fish everywhere,"
Rayor said. "But that's not the case anymore. Cabo Pulmo has become
the main event."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cabo Pulmo National Marine Park is home to the only living coral
reef in the Sea of Cortez and the only substantial living reef on the
west coast of North America. As such, it is a special place worthy of
protection.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico deserves credit for recognizing this. But the local hotel
owners, their captains and crews, and the dive community, deserve as
much credit for helping to make the marine park flourish instead of
founder, as one up the gulf in Loreto seems to be doing.</TE>
<TE>   Those on the fishing boats and dive boats are the watchdogs and
caretakers.</TE>
<TE>   "I've personally pulled up nets and turned them in to
authorities," Ireland said. "I've done it before and will do it
again."</TE>
<TE>   Somewhat surprisingly, local sportfishing leaders, although they
squawked initially, have accepted the idea of a no-take zone in their
midst. Some even believe it has proved beneficial to the surrounding
fishery.</TE>
<TE>   Now they are among the driving forces behind a mounting push to
ban gillnets, as was the case 10 years ago in California, when a
drive organized largely by sportfishermen led to an initiative that
ultimately led to the banning of gillnets in coastal and island
waters.</TE>
<TE>   This kind of conservation ethic, not something for which Mexico
has been known, is particularly evident in the East Cape, a region
spanning about 50 miles from Los Frailies at Cabo Pulmo's southern
edge to El Cardonal, just north of Los Barriles.</TE>
<TE>   Last spring, in response to a public outcry over the deaths of
three whales, whose net-mangled bodies had washed ashore, Mexico's
department of fisheries outlawed gillnets in East Cape waters.</TE>
<TE>   "Now the whole area is kind of like a marine park, and whoever
tries to do something illegal is in deep [trouble]," said Bobby Van
Wormer Jr., secretary of tourism for the state of Baja California Sur. "If
any citizens witness any poaching, all they have to do is find a couple of
policemen with pistols and they'll stop the boat doing the damage and get
an inspector from Cabo [San Lucas] or La Paz and they'll confiscate the
boat."</TE>
<TE>   That's easy for Van Wormer to say. His family owns three of the
most popular East Cape hotels, among them Palmas de Cortez in Los
Barriles, and it wields considerable influence. As a tourism
official, Van Wormer says his ultimate goal is to have gillnets
banned statewide.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, he points to the turquoise sea and says the ban is
paying dividends, particularly in nearshore waters, where prized
catch-and-release species such as roosterfish and amberjacks are now
prowling without invisible walls of death standing in their way.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the best roosterfish fishing we have ever had going on
right now," Van Wormer boasted. "Our annual roosterfish tournament
[two weeks ago at Hotel Punta Colorada] was the best in 37 years.
They caught and released 182 roosters in three days, and one guy
accounted for 23 in one day."</TE>
<TE>   Now that's something to crow about.</TE>
<TE>   News and Notes</TE>
<TE>   * Baja beat: Dustin Lohrman of the Cabo San Lucas dive company
Underwater Diversions (www.divecabo.com) on Wednesday said his
clients were wearing 6.5-millimeter wetsuits, which is unheard of at
Land's End at this time of year. "The water has dropped to 60 degrees
just off the beach," Lohrman explained. That's about 20 degrees
cooler than normal and it has virtually shut off nearshore fishing.
The bizarre phenomenon has also affected East Cape waters. A much
warmer band of water exists offshore and it is slowly moving
shoreward.</TE>
<TE>   * Southland bite: While albacore anglers out of San Diego continue
to bag limits of 12- to 25-pound fish, there is good fishing closer
to home. Of note is the arrival of small yellowtail, also called
firecrackers, in southern Santa Monica Bay, just in time for the
weekend. "They're small, mostly six-pound fish mixed in with the
barracuda, but they're making things a little more exciting," said
Jeff Jessop, captain of the Redondo Special out of Redondo
Sportfishing.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, sand bass remain the prime target off Huntington Flats
and Oceanside, while more schools of barracuda are off Dana Point.</TE>
<TE>   * Catch of the week: This week's winner, hands down, is Patrick
Friedman of Torrance, who bagged a 38-pound bluefin during a six-day
voyage aboard the Polaris Supreme. It wasn't the biggest fish, but
then neither was Friedman the biggest angler. He is only 7 and has
bragging rights over big brother Philip, 11, who reeled in a 37-pound
albacore.</TE>
<TE>   * Paddleboarding: The Hennessey's United States Paddleboard
Championships are scheduled July 13 beginning at 7 a.m. at Hermosa
Beach Pier. The race, open to anyone 18 or older with a paddleboard
and the entry fee of $45, covers 14 miles from the pier to R-10 buoy
off the Palos Verdes Peninsula and back. Several other events, among
them a luau and raffle, are planned. Details: (310) 316-5652.</TE>
<TE>   * Hunter's ed: The Department of Fish and Game has announced a
free hunter-education course on July 14 at 7 a.m. at its office in
Chino Hills. Such courses, which last about 10 hours, are required
before purchasing a hunting license. Details: (909) 597-9823.</TE>
<TE>   * Shooting sports: The annual Youth Outdoor Safari Day, a free
event sponsored by the Los Angeles and Orange County chapters of
Safari Club International, is scheduled July 20 at Mike Raahauge's
Shooting Sports Complex in Norco. Among featured attractions are a
BB-gun shooting gallery, nature walks, kayaking and decoy painting.
Details: (909) 735-7981.</TE>
<TE>   * Media: South Coast Sportfishing magazine has been sold
to Newport Beach publisher Drew Lawler. Former owner and publisher
Harvey Hunnicutt will remain as editor.</TE>

<HD>Restart in Closing Laps Paves Way for Gaunt's Perris Win</HD>

<DL>PERRIS, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Torrance's Rickie Gaunt took advantage of a late-lap crash to steal
the 30-lap Sprint Car Racing Assn. feature race in front of a
capacity crowd of 7,000 at the Perris Auto Speedway's seventh annual
Fourth of July show.</LD>
<LD>   "I was trying to stay on that thing as much as possible, it was
bucking like a bronco out there," Gaunt said on the victory stand.
"This thing was running so fast, I thought it would have to be
chained up."</LD>
<LD>   Gaunt, who had started the race in the 17th position, got by the
leader, Richard Griffin, on Turn 3 and held off Garden Grove's Tony
Jones and rookie Damion Gardner for the victory.</LD>
<TE>   Griffin was in third place on Lap 26 when the top two drivers,
Cory Kruseman and Rip Williams, spun each other on Turn 1, bringing
out a yellow flag and allowing Griffin to take the lead. However, on
the restart, Gaunt slid under Griffin on Turn 3 and pulled away.</TE>
<TE>   At the start of the race, Torrance's Mike Kirby held an early
lead, but soon was caught by Kruseman on Lap 5. Kruseman looked
uncatchable, despite a red-flag stop on Lap 17 that reset the field.
But Williams, the all-time feature winner at Perris, caught him on
Lap 26.</TE>

<HD>Stalker of Serena Williams Arrested Outside Wimbledon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lisa Dillman</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>WIMBLEDON, England</DL>
<LD>For the second time in less than three months, an overzealous fan of
Serena Williams has been detained by law enforcement authorities.
Albrecht Stromeyer, 34, of Frankfurt, Germany, was arrested outside
the All England Club on Wednesday and appeared at Wimbledon
Magistrates Court on Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   He was charged with breaching the peace and criminal damage and
was released after posting bond, not contesting the charges. His
attempts this year to insinuate himself into the life of Serena
Williams have forced the family to increase her personal security.
After he was detained at the Italian Open and deported by authorities
in May, a bodyguard soon appeared at her side.</LD>
<LD>   The bodyguard was stationed near the court when Williams played
her matches in Paris and even accompanied her in interview sessions
at the French Open. Here, police officers on the grounds at Wimbledon
have been given pictures of the alleged stalker, and one policeman
said in an interview that the man was spotted three times.</LD>
<TE>   Stromeyer was taken into custody when he was outside the grounds
on Wednesday, riding a bicycle. Stromeyer was said to have crashed
his bicycle into a security camera, according to an officer and a
report in the Daily Express.</TE>
<TE>   In court, prosecutor Martin Fox said, "Apparently, Mr. Stromeyer
has a fixation for tennis player Serena Williams." He added that the
man said of Williams, "I don't hate her. I love her. I will never
hurt her."</TE>
<TE>   Oracene Williams, the player's mother, said: "I hope if he needs
help, he gets it."</TE>
<TE>   Said Serena Williams: "I don't really pay any attention to
anything like that. I don't see how it could affect my game, him
being arrested. I'm a strong person. I try not to let things like
that affect me."</TE>
<TE>   Venus Williams was asked about the arrest and release of
Stromeyer, and what her father, Richard, would do if he "got a hold
of that guy."</TE>
<TE>   "Probably take him to lunch," Venus said.</TE>

<TE>   Record vs. Monarchs--1-0.</TE>
<TE>   Update--The Sparks have had four days to contemplate the loss to
Houston, their first regular-season home defeat in Staples Center
after 28 consecutive wins. The Sparks find their Western Conference
lead over the red-hot Comets, who have won eight in a row, has shrunk
to percentage points. Sacramento, on the other hand, is in a six-game
losing streak and can't escape the Western basement without the
injured Yolanda Griffith, Edna Campbell and Ticha Penicheiro.
Sunday's loss in Detroit has also left the Monarchs 0-8 on the road.
Penicheiro, the league's assist leader who suffered a sprained right
shoulder on June 20, is the closest to returning. Spark center Lisa
Leslie figures to be motivated after enduring one of her worst
professional games (seven points, one rebound) on Sunday.</TE>

<HD>Friends Make Kaze's Last Call</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Irv Kaze called at least once a week. Even though he also sent a fax,
he always wanted to make sure we knew who his guests would be on his
KRLA (870) radio talk show, "Irv Kaze on Sports." And he always had
time to chat.</LD>
<LD>   There was no such call this week.</LD>
<LD>   But there was a fax in the mailbox Monday morning, sent Friday at
4:23 p.m. It noted that the guests on his show coming up in eight
days would be Jerry Buss and rookie NASCAR race driver Jimmie
Johnson.</LD>
<TE>   The fax, for some reason, was even more jolting than the call from
the office late Saturday night. The fax struck a nerve and brought
some tears.</TE>
<TE>   Kaze, 75, suffered a heart attack at a Glendale restaurant not
long after doing last weekend's show. He was pronounced dead at
Glendale Memorial Hospital later that night.</TE>
<TE>   Kaze had been doing his show since April 1992 and six times was
named best radio talk show host by the Southern California Sports
Broadcasters.</TE>
<TE>   There will still be a show in Kaze's 6-7 p.m. time slot Saturday
on KRLA. And you won't want to miss it, whether you knew Kaze or not.
Keith Olbermann, KRLA operations manager Larry Marino and Kaze's
35-year-old son, Benjie,  a coordinating producer for Fox Sports Net,
will host a one-hour tribute.</TE>
<TE>   Olbermann, operating from New York, did most of the work, taping
interviews with an impressive list of guests, one that would have
made Kaze proud.</TE>
<TE>   The early list included John Wooden, Al Davis, Bob Costas, Tom
Lasorda, Ross Porter, Rich Marotta, Times Sports Editor Bill Dwyre,
Angel announcer Rory Markas and Tim Mead, the Angel vice president of
communications. More might be added.</TE>
<TE>   There might be so many guests that there will be a Part II the
following Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   And Marino said KRLA is planning to run a "best of Irv Kaze"
series at least through the end of the month.</TE>
<TE>   Kaze, who grew up in the New York area, was the Angels' first PR
director and went on to executive positions with a number of teams.
At one time he was the commissioner of the Continental Basketball
Assn.</TE>
<TE>   He worked for, among others, Davis and George Steinbrenner.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe even more impressive than working for both is not being
fired by either. "Irv was a good person who always made you feel
good," Wooden said on the phone from his home in Encino. "He made
everyone around him feel at ease."</TE>
<TE>   Wooden said he talked to Kaze only last Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "He called me to remind me we would once again be doing a special
for my birthday this year," said Wooden, who will turn 92 Oct. 14.</TE>
<TE>   Of Kaze, Davis said, "He was the ultimate professional.... He
loved his work, his family, his religion, and he loved people. And he
did it with a passion and admirable qualities that made him an
inspiration to all. He was my friend, and I don't know anyone who
didn't like Irv Kaze. I will miss him."</TE>
<TE>   NBC reporter Jim Gray, who was on the same flight as Kaze
returning from this year's Super Bowl, recalled asking Kaze why he
still traveled so much and went to so many events.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me, 'I love sports and I love media people,' " Gray said.</TE>
<TE>   Kaze's widow, Barbara, and Benjie are planning a public service
for the first week in August. The family has requested that in lieu
of flowers, donations be sent to the Irv Kaze Memorial Sanctuary
Fund, Ohev Shalom Synagogue, 525 S. Fairfax Ave., Los Angeles 90036.
Or to the Jewish Home for the Aging, 7150 Tampa Ave., Reseda 91335.</TE>
<TE>   At a private service Monday, Benjie may have summed up his father
best. He called him "a true gentleman."</TE>
<TE>   All-Star Tidbits</TE>
<TE>   Joe Buck and Tim McCarver will be Fox's game announcers for
Tuesday's baseball All-Star game.... Jeanne Zelasko and Kevin Kennedy
will serve as pre- and postgame hosts.... Pregame coverage starts at
5 p.m....Fox, which has won Emmy awards for sound, will use more than
60 microphones for the game. There will be microphones on both
managers and some players. Fox is also planning to use a Catcher Cam.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's Home Run Derby will be on ESPN at 5 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Local Emmys</TE>
<TE>   At last weekend's Los Angeles Area Emmy Awards, Chick Hearn won
the Governors Award, Channel 4's Fred Roggin won two Emmys, including
one for his excellent work during the Lakers' championship run, and
Fox Sports Net won a record five Emmys. Fox Sports Net 2 won for its
Dodger telecasts, Laker and Angel director Doug Freeman won an Emmy,
"Inside Cal-Hi Sports" won its fourth Emmy and the "Southern
California Sports Report" won its first. Jonathan Lababit won for
writing.</TE>
<TE>   NASCAR News</TE>
<TE>   Fox finishes up its part of the NASCAR season Saturday with the
Pepsi 400 at 4 p.m. at Daytona, although much of the crew will
continue on with Speed Channel and cable coverage.</TE>
<TE>   With Fox's first year of NASCAR coverage in 2001 came a ratings
surge of 16% (5.8 from 5.0) and that 5.8 average held steady this
year.</TE>
<TE>   The return to Daytona this weekend brings back some vivid memories
of Dale Earnhardt's death there at the end of the 2001 Daytona 500
for many members of the Fox crew.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I will be able to walk into that booth and look
back down at that fourth turn and not have some thoughts about what
happened," Darrell Waltrip said. "That was one of the most emotional
and chilling days in my whole life."</TE>
<TE>   Waltrip got choked up just talking about it on a conference call
this week.</TE>
<TE>   Wimbledon Woes</TE>
<TE>   NBC already had been plagued by upsets and rain delays at
Wimbledon. Then came Thursday's two big news events in Southern
California, and Channel 4 pushed back its Wimbledon coverage from
noon to 6:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Tennis fans planning to spend the afternoon watching Venus and
Serena Williams along with the men's quarterfinals probably weren't
too pleased, but what was Channel 4 to do? The station covered the
breaking news of the shootings at LAX and the small-plane crash in
San Dimas.</TE>
<TE>   "Originally we planned to cover the shooting at LAX and then pick
up Wimbledon coverage," said Chris Myers, Channel 4's assistant news
director. "But due to chaos at LAX and the tragedy at Bonelli Park,
we felt we had to stay on the air with the breaking news. There's
also safety issues to consider."</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   At least NBC is on a hot streak with golf. This weekend the
network has the U.S. Women's Open, which got a boost when Tiger Woods
withdrew from the Western Open, which is on ABC.... NBC's coverage of
Don Pooley's thrilling playoff victory over Tom Watson in the U.S.
Senior Open Sunday earned a 2.5 national rating, the highest for the
event since Hale Irwin's victory in 1998 earned a 3.1.... ABC angered
soccer fans Sunday when it cut away from the World Cup championship
game as soon as it ended, missing the postgame celebration. A
spokesman said the network had an obligation to get to regular
programming.... Last Sunday's Dodger-Angel game was not televised
because it started at 5 p.m. and contractually couldn't compete
against ESPN's baseball telecast. ESPN televised the New York Mets
and Yankees at 5 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   In Closing</TE>
<TE>   Robert Wuhl, the star of HBO's "Arli$$," was at Minneapolis'
Metrodome recently to film scenes for an upcoming episode. According
to the St. Paul Pioneer Press, he asked several Twins where he</TE>
<TE>   could find third baseman Corey Koskie.</TE>
<TE>   Was he seeking out Koskie for an upcoming role on the show?</TE>
<TE>   "No," Wuhl said. "I've got him on my rotisserie team, and I wanted
to know why he wasn't stealing."</TE>

<HD>Hewitt Tries Tough Way</HD>
<DH>Wimbledon men: Australian wastes chance to sweep, but ends
up sweating out five-set victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WIMBLEDON, England</DL>
<LD>So, what's 1 hour and 52 minutes between the first and last match
point, anyway?</LD>
<LD>   For Australia's top-seeded Lleyton Hewitt, it must have felt like
an eternity. His Wimbledon aspirations were slipping away against, of
all people, 18th-seeded Sjeng Schalken of the Netherlands. Hewitt
should have been in the comfort of the dressing room after having
four match points at 6-5 in the third set.</LD>
<LD>   "It turned into a dogfight," Hewitt said.</LD>
<TE>   Schalken started to break down Hewitt's forehand and connected
often with his sublime one-handed backhand, winning the third-set
tiebreaker, taking the fourth set and fighting off break points at
will. Twice, in the fifth set he broke Hewitt to edge ahead. Twice,
Hewitt responded by breaking back in the next game.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it's a self-created crisis or genuine on-court battle,
Hewitt thrives on these situations. He fought off a break point in
the 11th game of the fifth set and won it with his fifth and final
match point when Schalken hit a forehand wide. Hewitt won the 3-hour
51-minute quarterfinal against Schalken, 6-2, 6-2, 6-7 (5), 1-6, 7-5,
and hit 20 aces.</TE>
<TE>   Waiting for him in today's semifinals is fourth-seeded Tim Henman
of Great Britain. Henman beat the unheralded and No. 90-ranked Andre
Sa of Brazil, 6-3, 5-7, 6-4, 6-3, making a relatively simple
assignment more difficult than necessary.</TE>
<TE>   If anything should bring Hewitt's spirit back, it is Henman. For
him, it is the ultimate us-against-them scenario, just the way he
likes it. One feisty Aussie vs. the hope of a nation. Besides, he has
never lost to Henman in five matches.</TE>
<TE>   "I have the feeling if I start pumping fists or if the crowd gets
really against Lleyton, he will get better," Schalken said. "If you
try to make him angry, or if you're against him, then he will go even
more for every shot."</TE>
<TE>   Two newcomers playing in their first Grand Slam semifinal are in
the other match--Xavier Malisse of Belgium and David Nalbandian of
Argentina. Malisse defeated Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands, 6-1,
4-6, 6-2, 3-6, 9-7, as Krajicek's lack of match play in the last 20
months became evident. Krajicek's body slowly wore down after too
many five-set matches.</TE>
<TE>   "Somehow I've pulled out matches in the past that I was struggling
physically," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Krajicek's serve kept him alive often, but it finally gave way in
the 15th game of the fifth set, when he double-faulted on break
point, netting his second serve. Malisse said he was able to serve it
out by pretending it was the first game of the fifth set.</TE>
<TE>   "I was expecting to lose second or third round," he said. "Every
round now after that I win is a bonus. I'll be the same tomorrow.
Today was the same."</TE>
<TE>   In the other quarterfinal, Nalbandian defeated Nicolas Lapentti of
Ecuador, 6-4, 6-4, 4-6, 4-6, 6-4, and will try to become the first
player to reach a Wimbledon final in his debut. He is only the second
man in the Open era, which started in 1968, to reach the semifinals
in his debut, joining John McEnroe, who did it in 1977.</TE>
<TE>   This is Nalbandian's first grass-court event on the tour, but he
did get to the semifinals as a junior at Wimbledon in 1999. He was
defaulted from that semifinal for arriving late.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'm going to sleep here," Nalbandian said, joking.</TE>
<TE>   McEnroe, too, was once defaulted for a doubles match at the U.S.
Open when he arrived late. Nalbandian was asked if he had anything
else in common with McEnroe.</TE>
<TE>   "No," he said. "I think John is a great, great player. I think I
have a long way to be like him."</TE>
<TE>   Inclement weather earlier in the week created a backlog in the
schedule, and four men's quarterfinal matches and the women's
semifinals were played Thursday. Lapentti was upset at being
relegated to Court 2, calling it stunning and disappointing.</TE>
