<HD>'Cuban' puts human flaws before politics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Philip Brandes</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Putting aside the clash of ideologies played out in headline
propaganda, Cuban American writer-actor Carlos Lacamara's "Becoming
Cuban" at the Hudson Guild Theatre illuminates, with a keen insider's
eye, some of the complexities and contradictions of life under the
present-day Castro regime. In the process, Lacamara and director Bert
Rosario achieve something rare and notable: an insightful,
informative new play whose broad political and social commentary
never overwhelms the involving personal drama at its core.</LD>
<LD>   Recognizing that the embargoed island is an enigma to most of us,
Lacamara skillfully plays that unfamiliarity to great theatrical
advantage by showing Cuba through the eyes of a perky, naive American
heiress named Michelle (Erin Fisk), a crusading international
volunteer and would-be journalist. Laughably maladept as a field
laborer, Michelle falls under the patronage and romantic spell of
Raul (Lacamara), a suave, pragmatic party official who, despite his
sincere affection for her, does not hesitate to exploit, betray and
sacrifice her to further his agenda of shaping the transition to a
post-Castro society. Although some of each character's motives emerge
through stagy monologues rather than natural interaction, the
distractions are short-lived.</LD>
<TE>   In a remarkably complex performance, Lacamara's ostensible villain
Raul remains sympathetic, in part because of his longing to create a
better world. Equally riveting is actor Mark Adair-Rios, supplying a
worthy antagonist of equal moral ambiguity as Ariel, a cynical doctor
who guides Michelle through the horrifically impoverished and
brutally repressed underbelly of Raul's great society. But Ariel's
halo is also tarnished, by a selfish desperation that is all too
understandable. Lofty principles, Michelle must learn, are a luxury
no one in Cuba can afford.</TE>
<TE>   Although Michelle's role in the plot requires her to remain a
clueless simp through most of it, Fisk finds a compelling tragic
rationale for the girl's blindness in her need for approval from her
father (or father figures, including "Papa" Fidel). Among a seamless
supporting cast, standouts are Jossie Thacker's chillingly effective
Orwellian interrogator, and Patrick Rowe as Ariel's comic and
touching gay friend, who wants to contract AIDS so he can join his
infected lover in a quarantine camp.</TE>
<TE>   The play ultimately takes a stand on the Cuba question, but only
after showing the human flaws on both sides. The real secret to
"Becoming Cuban," Lacamara teaches us, is to see clearly.</TE>

<HD>Networks vow not to call U.S. races early</HD>
<DH>Trying to avoid a repeat of the 2000 election, cable and
broadcast news divisions say that they'll wait until the polls close
in each state on Tuesday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Calvo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Determined to avoid a rerun of election night 2000, when they called
the presidential election based on premature -- and incorrect --
projections in Florida, chastened television newscasters will refrain
from projecting winners until each poll in that state has closed.</LD>
<LD>   The new, more conservative election coverage policy will be used
by ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, CNN, MSNBC, CNBC and BET. It is expected to
push the results of several cliffhanger races into the wee hours on
Tuesday. Fox News has made arrangements for its coverage to last
until midnight if necessary.</LD>
<LD>   "We're not going to be sneaky about this, saying an overwhelming
number of men and woman have voted for candidate X," said Bill
Wheatley, vice president of NBC News.</LD>
<TE>   "We'll do exit polls about who they voted for and what issues were
on their mind," he added. "We might say that opinion was evenly
divided on certain issues, but we wouldn't do anything that would
indicate who was winning."</TE>
<TE>   CNN is not relying solely on Voter News Service, the consortium of
news agencies that, until the 2000 election, served as the main
source of voter data and analysis.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to VNS, the cable news network is dispatching hundreds
of workers to precincts in 10 closely monitored races around the
country to report the results as they are announced.</TE>
<TE>   Election night executive producer David Bohrman said CNN RealVote
means "there's not going to be a wink-and-a-nod way for us to call a
race while the polls are open."</TE>
<TE>   CBS executives are aiming to buff up the network's credibility and
accuracy by stationing analysts in the studio, within earshot of the
anchor.</TE>
<TE>   "If there are any disputes about winners, they'll be in closer
contact and be able to hear each other a little better," said Al
Ortiz, executive producer of special events for CBS News.</TE>
<TE>   The election comes during the crucial ratings sweeps period, which
means that instead of blocking out prime-time periods for continuous
coverage, the broadcast networks will gingerly provide updates
throughout Tuesday evening, with an hourlong special at 10 or 11
p.m., when they would ordinarily air the nightly news.</TE>
<TE>   Cable news networks, however, such as MSNBC, CNN and Fox News,
have dedicated the evening to election coverage and analysis.</TE>
<TE>   And BET will air a special edition of its nightly news at 11 p.m.,
"Balance of Power ... Weighing the African-American Impact."</TE>
<TE>   Almost every executive producer of election night coverage said
the public deserves more transparency in calling races. As a result
of the premature results announced in 2000, many voters didn't bother
heading to polls that were still open.</TE>
<TE>   "The 2000 election taught a lot of lessons to a lot of people in
politics and the media," Bohrman said.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, we can take advantage of those hard lessons and do a
better job."</TE>

<HD>Missing the connection and more in 'Love'</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Manohla Dargis</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his take on Arthur Schnitzler's well-trodden play "Reigen,"
writer-director Peter Mattei traces a connection through a miscellany
of New Yorkers, beginning with a prostitute (Vera Farmiga) who
services a contractor (Domenick Lombardozzi) on a waterfront as
barren as the characters' interior landscapes.</LD>
<LD>   From there, the contractor moves on to the restless wife (Jill
Hennessy) of a sexually ambiguous man (Malcolm Gets), who finds
comfort in the embrace of a painter (Steve Buscemi), who, in turn,
longs for an imperious gallery worker (Rosario Dawson). And so it
goes as one character leads to another in an overly familiar
cavalcade of alienation, despair and dreary grappling.</LD>
<LD>   Despite its rich inspiration -- the basis of films by Max Ophuls
and Roger Vadim, among others, as well as David Hare's play "The Blue
Room" -- "Love in the Time of Money" is an enervating bit of
business. Best known in its French translation, "La Ronde,"
Schnitzler's play involves men and women whose erotic encounters
reflect their circumscribed milieu. Although the title suggests that
Mattei has something to say about sex in the modern world some 100
years later (much in the way the 1992 feature "Chain of Desire" used
the play to consider love in the time of AIDS), the evidence
indicates he has nothing new to add.</LD>
<TE>   Sluggishly paced and shot in the sort of grubby digital video that
renders even the dewiest skin tone liverwurst gray, the film comes
across as little more than a series of acting workshop exercises
wrapped in a tissue of cliche. The actors who fare best, notably
Adrian Grenier as a lover cut adrift, along with the eccentrically
paired Dawson and Buscemi, are pleasant enough company yet even they
can't alleviate the tedium of a work that lacks both a purpose and a
strong pulse.</TE>
<TE>   -- Manohla Dargis</TE>
<TE>   "Love in the Time of Money": Rated R, for a disturbing violent
image, strong sexual content and language. In general release.
Running time: 1 hour, 28 minutes.</TE>

<LD>The Steve Oedekerk-John A. Davis "Santa vs. the Snowman 3-D" is as
bright and shiny as a Christmas tree ornament, and among other
treats, it creates the illusion of snowflakes falling right into the
viewer's lap.</LD>
<LD>   But as a slick, hard-edged product targeting the holiday kiddie
trade, it reminds us that the cartoon remains the realm of pain-free
violence -- and all manner of sly subversiveness, in this instance
starting with having Jonathan Winters voice Santa. If ever there was
a man who could strike a pure note of false bonhomie, it's Winters.</LD>
<LD>   The lonely Snowman, lured by the lights of Santa's Village,
manages to break in, thanks to the laxity of the bored, inept guards,
one of whom remarks to another that since he gets all the ice he
wants, why should he buy the igloo? (It's safe to say that one will
sail over the heads of small fry.) Overcome by jealousy of a Santa so
beloved and so laden with goodies he can't have, the Snowman triggers
the Christmas That Almost Wasn't.</LD>
<TE>   It's hardly giving anything away that Santa and the spirit of
Christmas prevail and all is forgiven. Or is it? Santa invites the
Snowman to have a jolly snowball fight in which Santa advises that
the Snowman will learn what a good snowball really is. St. Nick's not
kidding: One of his snowballs puts out the Snowman's eye, which
results in a hearty ho-ho-ho from Santa.</TE>
<TE>   The Imax 3D-animation medium, with its razor-sharp, breathtaking,
large-scale, deep-perspective images and all manner of fantastic
effects, is dazzling in its possibilities, but the holiday message of
the 37-minute "Santa vs. the Snowman" leaves a lot to be desired.</TE>
<TE>   -- Kevin Thomas</TE>
<TE>   "Santa vs. the Snowman 3-D": Unrated. Times guidelines: Amid
fantasy razzle-dazzle, children may not comprehend the film's darker

<HD>Adrift amid marriage, murder</HD>
<DH>'Weight of Water' struggles to stay afloat with dueling
themes, poorly cast characters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Manohla Dargis</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Director Kathryn Bigelow has always seemed an uneasy fit with the
American movie industry. Part of this discomfort is the chilliness of
her touch, the almost aggressive lack of emotional heat we expect in
our movies. Then there's the fact that the film business is not
disposed to women directors who don't work for easy laughs. There is
nothing frivolous or ingratiating about Bigelow's finest films or her
most seductive characters, all of whom -- the cowboy vampires of
"Near Dark," a guardian angel named Mace in "Strange Days" -- share
with the director an unwavering purposefulness. Even when they're
coaxing laughter from their nightmares, these are characters who take
themselves very seriously.</LD>
<TE>   Bigelow's last film, the submarine thriller "K-19: The
Widowmaker," released in July, is the second of two recent features
she's directed about characters confined to close quarters while
aboard a ship, which could be a metaphor but is likely just chance.
The earlier feature, a drama based on the Anita Shreve novel "The
Weight of Water," is only now receiving a U.S. release, more than two
years after its premiere at the Toronto Film Festival. Awkwardly
framed by two separate narrative strands, the film combines a 19th
century true-crime mystery with the unraveling of a contemporary
marriage, an uncharacteristic choice of material for a genre director
who favors bold strokes and has a talent for setting bodies in
violent motion.</TE>
<TE>   Photographer Jean Janes (Catherine McCormack), her Pulitzer
Prize-winning poet husband (Sean Penn), her brother-in-law (Josh
Lucas) and his new girlfriend (Elizabeth Hurley) sail to the Isles of
Shoals off the Maine coast to research a century-old murder. In 1873,
a Norwegian immigrant, Maren Hontvedt (Sarah Polley), had been the
sole witness to the frenzied slaying of her older sister (the late
Katrin Cartlidge) and sister-in-law (Vinessa Shaw). Joylessly married
to a fisherman (Ulrich Thomsen) who applies the same grim
determination to his trade as he does to fulfilling his conjugal
duties, Maren has endured years of near-solitude when her sister
arrives from Norway. Sometime later, the household swells to include
a Prussian boarder (Ciaran Hinds), Maren's brother (Anders W.
Berthelsen) and his new bride.</TE>
<TE>   Shreve embroiders the historical record with fabricated evidence
in the novel, restlessly moving between the past and the present
until they blur together.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Prussian was hanged for the crime, Shreve is less
concerned with who swung the ax than why. For her, the great mystery
of the murders is the island's otherworldly women, in particular
Maren, a creature whose psychological opacity makes her the sort of
blank slate upon which authors are so fond of scribbling their ideas.
For her part, Bigelow has said she was drawn to the book because her
mother comes from Norwegian stock, but a more persuasive explanation
may have been the appeal of exploring the darker side of female
desire, a shadowy area only glanced on in her previous films.</TE>
<TE>   In her telling of this complicated story, Bigelow handles the
flashback sequences adroitly, even though she never manages to
surmount the intrinsic dreariness of their sub-Bergman despair. Yet
if the past quivers to tepid life, there's simply no saving the
present-day drama, which, despite the attractive presence of
McCormack and Lucas, is overwhelmed by Penn and Hurley's dueling
histrionics.</TE>
<TE>   Scowling his way forward and aft, Penn's swaggering macho genius
is as dated as his Elvis pompadour and only slightly less silly than
Hurley's strenuous vamping, which finds her alternately melting ice
cubes over her overheated body and lustily slurping on lobster legs.</TE>
<TE>   If Penn and Hurley are too loud for the story's subtleties, it's
because Bigelow's penchant for action over introspection doesn't make
sense for a drama hinged on such unreliable, emotionally repressed
narrators. Part of the problem is that Alice Arlen and Christopher
Kyle's screenplay is so faithful to Shreve's novel that it fails to
transcend the book's obscure point of view and the falsity of its
parallel narrative.</TE>
<TE>   "The Weight of Water" depends on a seamless integration of Jean
and Maren's stories for the larger narrative to work -- but even with
Bigelow's fluid editing, the strands never convincingly plait
together. No matter how deep her hurt, Jean and her insecurities make
for an impoverished counterpoint to the tragedy of a woman imprisoned
by history as well as by madness, an imbalance underscored with each
cut from all the dank Nordic repression to the gaseous New England
whining.</TE>
<TE>   Bigelow has always had a difficult time keeping a handle on her
characters' passions, especially when it comes to the sort of quieter
emotions that fall with tears rather than with blood. Her characters
often seem designed to express themselves through their fists, and
that may be one reason why she's at her most comfortable in
action-oriented genres. (They're also easier to get made.)</TE>
<TE>   One of the surplus pleasures of her work is how it consistently
defies expectations about the stories a female director is supposed
to tell. The thing is, all that time spent in male company may have
ill prepared her for characters who don't necessarily behave the way
men are supposed to.</TE>
<TE>   There's nothing fainthearted about the way Bigelow attacks the
screen (her background is as an Abstract Expressionist painter). As a
director, she knows how to get out of the house, but she can be
impatient when it comes to humdrum reality. That may account for her
interest in Shreve's novel, with its epic tragedies, and it may help
to explain the misguided casting of Penn and Hurley, each of whom
comes equipped with an oversized personality.</TE>
<TE>   But for "The Weight of Water" to stay afloat, everyone and
everything would have to be scaled to human size. The characters
would have to face their demons without the crutch of violence, and
they would have to trade in some of the director's unyielding
determination for a more flexible sense of how to survive the here
and now. In other words, they would have to live in the world, not
just fight it.</TE>

<HD>Writer navigates boy's imagination in 'Horse'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daryl H. Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although barely into his teens, the central character in "The Visible
Horse" has life all figured out. Of course, at his age, that means
he's cracked the code to being cool. Pulling himself away from a
skateboarding maneuver he's trying to perfect, he spells out an
amusingly complex formula that involves popularity (10%), fashion and
hygiene (10%), and attitude (80%). Example: " 'Simpsons' shirts are
fashion, but you gotta wear a clean one every two days -- that's
hygiene."</LD>
<LD>   As Scott (Eddie Karr) chatters through the first minutes of this
Appian Way production, he begins to reveal the deeper workings of his
mind when he uses such phrases as: "If my dad was here...." While
Scott's mother (Wendy Phillips) is wrangling him into bed, the reason
for Dad's absence is finally spoken: He was killed in a car accident.</LD>
<LD>   It's a wrenching topic, yet playwright Mary Lathrop keeps the mood
surprisingly buoyant. Entering a boy's overactive imagination, she
charts a world where monsters hide under beds, objects possess
magical powers and feelings are equated with the guts that show
through the clear-plastic skin of an anatomical model of a horse.</LD>
<TE>   Under the nurturing care of Lisa James (the insightful director
behind such productions as "Palladium Is Moving" and "The Water
Children"), the story achieves a delicate balance between truth and
theatricality.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips comes across as a totally awesome mom who knows when to
try to tease a smile out of her son, when to speak to him as an
adult.</TE>
<TE>   The weight of this story, though, rests on 15-year-old Karr's
slender but remarkably strong shoulders. He is charmingly coltish in
his direct addresses to the audience, and there's not a false moment
in his dialogue scenes with Phillips. At a recent performance, his
voice cracked into its boyish upper register while he was squealing
at Phillips to stop hugging and kissing him. Adolescent bravado
melted away just long enough to provide a glimpse of the child still
lurking behind it.</TE>

<HD>China's gift to Jews fleeing Hitler: safe haven</HD>
<DH>'Shanghai Ghetto' documents refugee life in the exotic,
decadent city that provided an unexpected port of last resort for
20,000 desperate people.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Desowitz</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the lesser known stories of World War II that only recently
has gained wider recognition is how Shanghai became a haven for Jews
fleeing persecution in Nazi Germany in the late 1930s. As the
fascinating documentary "Shanghai Ghetto" explains, the city was an
open port where no visa was required, in part because the occupying
Japanese simply didn't want the responsibility.</LD>
<LD>   Shanghai was China's commercial center -- exotic, decadent,
affluent but also riddled with poverty. Russian Jews had fled their
Communist country a decade earlier and had no problem thriving amid
the Chinese culture, just as British Jews had done a century earlier.
As it turns out, German Jews, totaling 20,000, had no problem
co-existing either, experiencing little or no anti-Semitism.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike their Russian counterparts, however, these hungry and
penniless refugees, with few or no skills to help them survive, were
squeezed in 1943 into the poorest and most populated area of
Shanghai, the Hongkew district, as a result of German pressure on the
Japanese to segregate them. Yet despite their hardship, they worked
together with the impoverished Chinese. Many friendships were formed.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sneaking into the ghetto</TE>
<TE>   For Dana Janklowicz-Mann, "Shanghai Ghetto," which opened last
Friday, became the perfect opportunity to explore her roots, because
her father, Henry Janklowicz, was just a child when he left Berlin in
'39 with his mother to settle in Shanghai for the next eight years.
After listening to numerous stories around the dinner table -- her
father as a child was beaten daily by Russian and Japanese youths --
Mann and her husband and filmmaking partner, Amir Mann, both
Israelis, decided to make a documentary about the Shanghai experience
with their savings. It took five years of research, interviews,
filming and editing -- including sneaking into what remains of the
Shanghai ghetto two years ago with the elder Janklowicz -- but they
completed their odyssey. Actor Martin Landau was so moved when he saw
the film that he agreed to narrate.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, the most interesting thing we learned was that even
though the German refugees and Chinese, who were worse off than the
Jews, were both oppressed and came from completely different
cultures, they got along and helped each other under these dire
conditions," Janklowicz-Mann says.</TE>
<TE>   Her partner had a different revelation. Amid the squalor and
difficulties, the German refugees were able to re-create a cultural
life similar to what they had in Berlin with poetry, theater, cafes,
nightclubs and religious schools.</TE>
<TE>   "People were living on a couple of cents a day," Mann says. "A
historian told us, for instance, that there were several different
newspapers in different languages that people would read and give to
one another until the pages were torn."</TE>
<TE>   The filmmakers interviewed five refugees on film, including
Janklowicz, who now lives in Israel. "It was the shock of a lifetime"
landing in Shanghai, he says in the documentary. "I actually remember
feeling very, very afraid. I didn't know where I was. It was a whole
different world." Yet Janklowicz has fond memories too, like of the
grocer who knocked on their door several times a month with food.</TE>
<TE>   Each refugee has something distinctive to offer. Alfred Kohn
recalls the joy of participating in a boxing league; Betty
Grebenschikoff describes the scholastic achievements and friendships
in a private school run by the British; Evelyn Pike Rubin recounts
her frustration in not being able to get her brother out of Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Laura Margolis, an official for the Jewish Joint
Distribution Committee, which financially supported the refugees out
of New York until the United States went to war with Japan, relates
how she pleaded with the Japanese to let her raise money for the
refugees so they wouldn't starve. Because the Japanese were worried
about rioting, they agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Two original refugees, an elderly couple that is 80 years old,
are still being financially assisted" by the committee,
Janklowicz-Mann says. "Nobody else knows this but the accountant."</TE>
<TE>   For Janklowicz-Mann, "Shanghai Ghetto" crucially represents the
story of the mothers, including her grandmother. "What was amazing to
me as we were doing this project was how amazing the mothers of all
these children that we interviewed were. So resilient and savvy. I
guess the will to survive was so strong that they were willing to do
anything to save their children.</TE>
<TE>   "My grandmother was remarkable and way ahead of her time. When she
wanted to leave Germany, she tried to persuade her family to go and
they tried to persuade her to stay. I don't know what it was, but she
knew it was time to get out and save herself and her son. She and my
grandfather were already divorced, so she was on her own."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'He's still mourning'</TE>
<TE>   And what was returning to Shanghai like for her father, a guarded
man who becomes more emotional each time he sees the film? "It
brought back a lot of memories, both painful and good,"
Janklowicz-Mann says. "I think in a way he's still mourning my
grandmother even though she died 20 years ago. When he went back to
that room where he had lived for eight years, he was overwhelmed. It
was amazing that it was still there and that it hadn't changed."</TE>
<TE>   But Janklowicz-Mann doesn't think the ghetto will stand much
longer. Shanghai is in the midst of a tremendous construction boom.</TE>
<TE>   Movie industry veteran Mike Medavoy, chairman of Phoenix Pictures,
who was born in Shanghai after his parents fled Russia, has returned
three times to Shanghai. "Every time I go there, I'm amazed at how
much it's grown....It's Manhattan."</TE>
<TE>   Medavoy's father started out fixing cars for an auto company, then
ran IT&amp;T's transportation division. "They lived a pretty good life
before leaving in '47, and then we moved to Santiago, Chile," Medavoy
says. The producer has become so intrigued with the refugee
experience in Shanghai that he has attempted without success to make
a movie about it with Miramax.</TE>
<TE>   Medavoy saw "Shanghai Ghetto" and was impressed. "It gets you
really emotionally involved. What an amazing place. It's an open port
so anybody can go there. And nobody needed to know who you were or
what you did. It's that place of last resort, and that's what the
Jews did to survive and start again."</TE>

<HD>Coming of age gets a worldly and wise treatment in 'Food of
Love'</HD>
<DH>The story of a first romance broadens to consider the
workings of human destiny.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With "Food of Love," renowned Catalan writer-director Ventura Pons
makes an impressive English-language debut in adapting esteemed
novelist David Leavitt's "The Page Turner" to the screen. This
subtle, sophisticated drama unfolds with a classic
pebble-tossed-in-the-still-pond effect: It opens like a well-shaped
vignette of first love only to broaden its scope to consider the
intricate workings of human destiny, illuminated by multifaceted
portrayals from its accomplished cast and set against the vibrant
backgrounds of Barcelona and Manhattan.</LD>
<LD>   It's a story Henry James might have told, had he dared, and it
proceeds from a much-cherished James theme: the fate of innocents
abroad. In this case they are a mother and son, Pamela Porterfield
(Juliet Stevenson) and 18-year-old Paul (Kevin Bishop). An aspiring
concert pianist, Paul was thrilled to be selected as page turner for
his hero and role model, the world-famous Richard Kennington (Paul
Rhys), when Kennington performed in San Francisco, Paul's hometown.</LD>
<TE>   Some months later, Paul and Richard cross paths in Barcelona,
where the pianist has just given a concert and intends to take a week
off before returning home to Manhattan. Pamela has gone ahead with
what had been intended as a family vacation, even though her marriage
has unexpectedly broken up. High-strung and possessive, she begins to
relax and regain her equilibrium with the advent of Richard, who
takes mother and son to dinner every evening and encourages her
shopping excursions and self-pampering. Meanwhile, Paul and Richard
are supposedly off sightseeing but end up in Richard's hotel suite,
in each other's arms.</TE>
<TE>   Richard has accomplished the seduction of the virginal but willing
Paul with considerate expertise -- and no false promises. Paul is a
well-mannered and intelligent boy-next-door type. Approaching 40,
Richard is not conventionally handsome but attractive, especially for
his lack of pretense and considerable polish. When Richard realizes
he is responding to Paul's love, he retreats but assures him that
they will be able to see each other once Paul commences his studies
at Juilliard.</TE>
<TE>   What might well have been extended into the entire film, however,
proves but a succinct prologue. Looming are Paul's discovery of what
it takes to pursue an artistic career, of more romance and ultimately
of mother and son, who hold surprises for each other and themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The actors, especially Stevenson, give multifaceted portrayals.
Allan Corduner's Mansourian, Kennington's powerful agent and longtime
lover, is a worldly older man who has no scruples about protecting
his own interests. If Mansourian is ultimately the liar in this tale,
Geraldine McEwan's Novotna, Paul's piano teacher, is its admirably
unsparing and blunt truth-teller. An elegant work, "Food of Love" is
as consistently engaging as it is revealing.</TE>

<LD>Celebrities are always magnetic, celebrities in a jam flat-out
irresistible.</LD>
<LD>   In other words, what a pity Winona Ryder's trial isn't televised.
What a great event for America it will be if Robert Blake's is.</LD>
<LD>   One day we want show-biz celebrities' autographs, the next
fistfuls of their flesh. We adore seeing them blow like Mount Etna,
then shrink from the paparazzi's white-hot glare as Dracula does from
daylight.</LD>
<TE>   Especially those with a Hollywood sheen, whether Hugh Grant
pleading no contest in 1995 to a charge of lewd contact with a hooker
to famous-for-being-famous Zsa Zsa Gabor, who instead of fleeing
camera crews outside the courtroom in 1989 embraced them before being
found guilty of slapping a Beverly Hills cop.</TE>
<TE>   The seedier a celebrity's troubles -- think accused shoplifter
Ryder and alleged murderer Blake -- the better.</TE>
<TE>   A former Saks Fifth Avenue security employee has claimed in court
that Ryder told her she was researching a pair of movie roles after
allegedly swiping more than $5,500 in unpaid designer goods from the
Beverly Hills store where, this week's testimony shows, you can max
out your credit card in three minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder denies committing theft. If she actually said that about the
movie roles, though, she's either dumb as a log or loopy as a loon.</TE>
<TE>   What role is Blake researching? He has yet to be tried after being
charged with the May 4 shooting of his wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, in a
case that's a cheap TV movie begging to be made.</TE>
<TE>   And a trial demanding to be televised.</TE>
<TE>   California is one of 37 states allowing cameras in criminal
courtrooms, with trial judges having the final say. Since O.J.
Simpson's controversially televised criminal trial, fewer judges have
said yes, confusing the boisterous media frenzy outside with what
went on inside the courtroom of Judge Lance Ito, who was pilloried
hilariously by Jay Leno's Dancing Itos.</TE>
<TE>   Blake is already dancing. So don't complain that TV cameras would
turn his trial into a circus.</TE>
<TE>   What would you expect in any case, something solemn like a wake?
With a trapezer like Blake in the box -- stopped by Los Angeles
County Sheriff Lee Baca this week from spilling his guts in jail to
Diane Sawyer on ABC -- this trial was ordered up by Ringling Bros.</TE>
<TE>   TV or not, clowns, kazoos and cotton candy are already in the
wings, courtroom floors being saw-dusted, Blake fitted for his Great
Zambini tights. Add to that the shady resume of his wife, whom he
denies murdering, and you have a spectacle that invites devouring by
the public.</TE>
<TE>   It will be ... exquisite.</TE>
<TE>   But what to do in the meantime? With no celebrity trial on TV this
week, I turned to "Celebrity Justice," a 2-month-old syndicated
series that tracks the legal problems of entertainment VIPs. It's
available on KCAL at 4:30 p.m. weekdays when most viewers here are
lapping up "Dr. Phil" on KNBC. Their loss.</TE>
<TE>   As wiggy as "Dr. Phil" is, "Celebrity Justice" is a howl not to be
missed. How often is there a legal show designed for an audience that
doesn't know Perry Mason from Perry Como? This one makes "Court TV"
look like the Yale Law Review. When I saw that commercial for
personal injury lawyer Larry H. Parker ("Fighting for you is my
job!"), I knew I was home.</TE>
<TE>   Based in Los Angeles, "Celebrity Justice" was created by Harvey
Levin, and is even funnier than he was during his years as a local
news reporter here before he began interviewing people on the street
for "People's Court."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, "Celebrity Justice" has local news crayoned all over it
while applying breathless team coverage to celebrities with
go-getters including anchor Holly Herbert, who spent a year glossing
up at KABC here, revved-up reporter Pat LaLama, who spent a year
about everywhere in L.A., and former KCAL anchor-reporter Jane
Velez-Mitchell. What a difference a job makes, for the formerly sober
Velez-Mitchell now projects great urgency, as if jabbed by an
electric prod.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's lead "lowdown": Winona.</TE>
<TE>   Reporter Ross McLaughlin had the "evidence" inside the courtroom,
bolstered by an artist's sketch of a pair of scissors Ryder allegedly
used to cut sensor tags from merchandise, and another of her when
"her jaw literally dropped" in response to testimony against her.</TE>
<TE>   But swiftly now on to LaLama, who had the Winona wardrobe dish,
because "how she looks and what she wears could be part of a cagey
legal strategy." Get out.</TE>
<TE>   Mentioned later also was Blake's search for a cagey new attorney
after Harlan Braun's decision to resign because of his client's
"emotional need to speak out" about the case against Braun's advice.</TE>
<TE>   But quick now to New York where reporter Carlos Dias had caught up
on the pavement with actor Matthew Modine who, "Celebrity Justice"
had learned, was in a jury pool for a murder trial. Oh, the irony.
"He was in 'Married to the Mob,' " Herbert noted, "and now he's
fighting crime in real life."</TE>
<TE>   Well, not quite, Herbert revealed after the taped interview, for
it turned out that Modine wasn't chosen for the murder trial after
all. Bummer. But he could be called "in another case," she chirped.
And viewers could count on "Celebrity Justice" being there to deliver
the "lowdown."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, "Celebrity Justice" had also learned that actor Paul
Sorvino and his daughter Amanda had moved their dog out of their
Manhattan penthouse after neighbors complained of barking. Then
suddenly -- had the half-hour really zoomed by this speedily? -- it
was time for "There Oughta Be a Law," a show-ending feature with
teed-off male soap actors getting a load off of their shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   "There oughta be a law," said one, "against my wife being in a bad
mood."</TE>
<TE>   What's not to love about a show where law and luminaries mingle
daily, one that reminds you of a lawyer with a shiny suit? Depending
on the outcomes of their cases, I can see Ryder and Blake
co-anchoring it someday.</TE>

<HD>Teddy Edwards, strong in spirit</HD>
<DH>The saxophonist, who's been battling cancer and other
ailments, brings his ensemble to Spazio Saturday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Heckman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If someone ever decides to write a "Jazz Profiles in Courage,"
saxophonist Teddy Edwards should rank high on the list of possible
candidates.</LD>
<LD>   Battling cancer and associated ailments for the last eight years,
he has nonetheless continued to expand upon a productive career
reaching back to the mid-'40s.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday night at Spazio in Sherman Oaks, Edwards, 78, will
lead his 17-piece Brass String Ensemble in a program of his
compositions and arrangements. He will do so despite the fact that he
has not been at the top of his form physically in recent months.</LD>
<TE>   "I haven't been doing too well lately," he says. "I got food
poisoning the first part of the year and lost over 30 pounds. And
I've been having trouble getting my weight back up again, so I don't
have much strength. But I'll be there Saturday night."</TE>
<TE>   The Brass String Ensemble has been one of Edwards' favorite
projects since he began writing for large ensembles in the '70s.
Prior to that time, he was best known for a number of considerably
different musical accomplishments.</TE>
<TE>   In 1946, on a recording with trumpeter Howard McGhee's ensemble
titled "Up in Dodo's Room," he offered what is generally acknowledged
to be the first recorded tenor saxophone solo in the bebop idiom.</TE>
<TE>   His million-selling tune, "Blues in Teddy's Flat," was released in
1947, and later in the decade he became one of the original
Lighthouse All-Stars.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards' vital presence in the Southland jazz scene has continued
ever since. Looking across the panorama of activities of the past
four or five decades, his name seems to be everywhere, from the
Hollywood Bowl to the Monterey Jazz Festival, from Disneyland to the
rotating cycle of area jazz clubs.</TE>
<TE>   In 1976, while recovering from an operation, Edwards'
always-curious mind led him in a new direction, beyond the
small-group music he had favored.</TE>
<TE>   "I had all this time on my hands," he recalls, "so I told myself I
should write something to show people that I wasn't just lying around
wasting my time."</TE>
<TE>   Taking a look at the various pieces of manuscript score paper
lying around his room, he focused on one that was laid out for full
orchestra -- winds, strings, percussion, etc.</TE>
<TE>   "I sat there and thought about it for a few minutes," Edwards
says, "and I finally thought, 'OK, I'll just write for everything
that's laid out here on this manuscript paper.' "</TE>
<TE>   And thus, from such a randomly spontaneous beginning, were born
the compositions that eventually surfaced as the Brass String
Ensemble.</TE>
<TE>   Since that genesis, Edwards has written, as he says, "much more
than we've ever had the chance to play." What has been presented has
surfaced in numerous settings, in the Southland, around the U.S., in
Europe, and on a mid-'90s recording.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the physical problems Edwards has experienced over the
last decade, he has produced -- in addition to his writing for the
Brass String Ensemble -- a remarkable range of other creative work.</TE>
<TE>   He reports that a musical he has been chipping away at is close to
completion. And a novel, "Paris Nights," he notes, "is just about
ready for publication. It'll be out on Vantage Press, and we're going
to include in the book the song I wrote that was the inspiration for
the story."</TE>
<TE>   Far from viewing his story as particularly courageous, Edwards
tries to take on each new day as it comes.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line, man," he says, "is that I'm fighting a bout with
cancer. But a lot of people fight a lot of battles, and I've got
mine. After eight years, you can get pretty tired. But we're working
on it. I've got several doctors and lots of friends, and I'm slowly
getting stronger.</TE>
<TE>   "And the good thing," Edwards says, "is that, with a little help
from a few pain pills, I can still get out there and play, and play
strong. And that's what I'll be doing on Saturday night in the middle
of all those brass and strings."</TE>

<TE>   Jazz in Print</TE>
<TE>   The jazz bookshelf keeps expanding: biographies, review
collections, personal perspectives and philosophical overviews, all
seeking to find the words to describe and explain an art that is,
almost by definition, nonverbal and nonspecific. Here are some recent
arrivals:</TE>
<TE>   "Drummin' Men -- The Heartbeat of Jazz: The Bebop Years," by Burk
Korall ($35, Oxford University Press). Korall follows up his first
book, "Drummin' Men -- The Heartbeat of Jazz: The Swing Era," with an
examination of the striking changes in drumming that have taken place
since the arrival of bebop in the '40s. In the process, he ranges
from such seminal figures as Jo Jones, Max Roach and Kenny Clarke to
the lesser-known Denzil Best, Tiny Kahn and J. C. Heard.</TE>
<TE>   "A Love Supreme: The Story of John Coltrane's Signature Album," by
Ashley Kahn ($27.95, Viking Press). Kahn is building a publishing
career by detailing the circumstances surrounding the creation of
classic jazz recordings. "A Love Supreme" follows "Kind of Blue," his
earlier take on the classic Miles Davis session of the late '50s,
with a similarly thorough overview -- with numerous photos -- of a
vital episode in the history of jazz recording.</TE>
<TE>   "Jazz Modernism: From Ellington and Armstrong to Matisse and
Joyce," by Alfred Appel Jr. ($35, Alfred A. Knopf). "Jazz Modernism"
attempts to establish similes and connections between jazz and 20th
century art. Styles and methods in both forms are occasionally
squeezed to fit into Appel's thesis, but more often than not his
insights offer intriguing illumination, enhanced by the book's
fascinating plethora of jazz photographs and art reproductions.</TE>
<TE>   "Faith in Time: The Life of Jimmy Scott," by David Ritz ($25, Da
Capo Press). Ritz has written insightful books about Marvin Gaye,
Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles and others. In "Faith in Time," he digs
into the odd, star-crossed life of Scott, whose high, androgynous
voice and ineffable way with tempo have made him an authentic jazz
treasure.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Riffs</TE>
<TE>   Catalina Bar &amp; Grill, the Southland's longest-running major jazz
room, will be moving to a new Hollywood location early next year.
Stay tuned for details.... The National Endowment for the Arts' 2002
American Jazz Fellowships have been awarded to drummer Elvin Jones
(who opens a six-night run at the Jazz Bakery on Tuesday),
saxophonist Jimmy Heath and singer Abbey Lincoln. The awards include
a grant of $20,000.... Pianist Marian McPartland makes a rare
Southland appearance Nov. 11-12 at the Jazz Bakery in an anticipatory
celebration of major upcoming anniversaries: her 85th birthday on
March 20, 2003; the 25th anniversary of the NPR radio show "Marian
McPartland's Piano Jazz," and her 30th year as a Concord Records
recording artist.</TE>

<HD>'Tully' a quietly impressive slice of small-town life</HD>
<DH>With its unhurried sensibility and sure sense of place, the
story of a father and sons builds intensity without resorting to
indie-film cliches.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth Turan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"I don't like thinking of people as types," says one of the
characters in "Tully," director and co-writer Hilary Birmingham's
impressive debut film. "I think it's lazy. I believe people can
surprise you."</LD>
<LD>   "Tully" does just that. Its passion for character, its respect for
the lives of the people it puts on screen, and its quiet, measured
pace make it something of an anomaly in the independent world. It's a
film that does quite nicely without either flashy nihilism or hip-hop
angst.</LD>
<LD>   "Tully's" deliberate speed goes hand in hand with its unmistakable
sense of place, its attraction to the rhythms of farm life and the
unhurried sensibility of its small-town Nebraska setting.</LD>
<TE>   But don't mistake "Tully's" quietness for lack of ambition or
nerve. Convincingly acted across the board, it's a film with a lot on
its mind, a story whose crises slowly gain in intensity, gathering
like threatening storm clouds on an initially clear horizon.</TE>
<TE>   "Tully's" screenplay, adapted by Matt Drake and the director from
an O. Henry Prize-winning short story by Tom McNeal, deals with young
people who arrive all unsuspecting at a crossroads in their lives,
who are searching for their place in the order of things while having
to come to terms with the past and what the past has made of them.</TE>
<TE>   Just like its characters, "Tully" has had a tough time of it in
the world. Originally sold at the Toronto Film Festival in 2000, the
film has had to weather the collapse of two companies that tried to
release it, and has changed its title from "The Truth About Tully"
when Jonathan Demme's "The Truth About Charlie" materialized at
roughly the same moment. But, if anything, the passage of time has
made this film seem a scarcer and more valuable commodity.</TE>
<TE>   There are two Tullys in this film, but the one who's center stage
is Tully Coates Jr. Recently out of school and supposed to be helping
his father with the family farm, Tully (seductively played by Anson
Mount) is more interested in enjoying the company of women. A lot of
women.</TE>
<TE>   With his classic good looks and Joe Namath smirk, Tully, much to
the chagrin of his sensitive younger brother, Earl (Glenn
Fitzgerald), is very much the rural Lothario. He even hooks up with
local femme fatale April Reece (a dead-on Catherine Kellner), an
exotic dancer with a strong possessive streak.</TE>
<TE>   But although Tully has the smile of someone who thinks he's got it
all, the reverse is true. Not that Tully's a bad guy (his continual
womanizing notwithstanding), but he is more of a naif than he wants
to admit. And he has no understanding of the nature of relationships,
something that, given his upbringing, is not a surprise.</TE>
<TE>   Both boys have been raised by their hard-nosed father, Tully
Coates Sr. (a powerful Bob Burrus), since the day 15 years ago when
he told them their mother was dead. The senior Tully looks as if he
hasn't laughed since that day, and, destroyed by the weight of his
cares, he has an abrasive, rubbed-raw relationship with his frivolous
older son.</TE>
<TE>   Bringing additional and unexpected tensions to this world are a
pair of new situations, one financial, the other emotional. Tully Sr.
gets a letter saying a lien has been placed on his farm, with a
devastating foreclosure the likely result. He has no idea why the
lien is there, and the eventual resolution of that mystery involves
the unearthing of disturbing family secrets.</TE>
<TE>   More human, and more involving, is the tentative relationship that
starts to form between the younger Tully and the only woman in town
who seems to be oblivious to his allure, and who in fact says things
like "I don't get it. What the big attraction is is beyond me."</TE>
<TE>   That would be smart, redheaded Ella Smalley (Julianne Nicholson in
a charming role), a friend of brother Earl's who's training to be a
veterinarian and who has the most levelheaded attitude of anyone in
the picture.</TE>
<TE>   Slowly, warily, because each is definitely not the other's type,
Tully and Ella start to spend more time together. He tells her, "I'm
not as dangerous as I look," and she teases him with an arch "What's
it like to drive women crazy?" But it's a mark of the film's
sophistication that it's not clear whether her attitude masks a
genuine interest or if Tully's reflexive pursuit of her is the sign
of something more lasting.</TE>
<TE>   Although this is director Birmingham's first feature (her
background includes a stint as director of development for
documentary director Barbara Kopple), she has a very sure sense of
what she wants out of her cast and the ability to put it on screen.
"Tully" may go against the grain of hipness, but that proves to be
very much of a blessing.</TE>

<LD>Turner Classic Movies isn't the only place to see westerns this
month. Two classics, "High Noon" and "Rio Grande," were recently
released on DVD in special collectors' editions, and several restored
Gene Autry films have been released on video.</LD>
<LD>   Although Artisan had released the 1950 John Wayne-John Ford
classic "Rio Grande" and the 1952 Gary Cooper-Fred Zinnemann
Oscar-winner "High Noon" on DVD before, these editions ($20 each )
contain more extras and commentary.</LD>
<LD>   In the case of "Rio Grande," the gripping action-adventure set
against the battles between the U.S. Cavalry and the Apaches includes
a beautiful digitally remastered picture and restored audio; and a
lovely new documentary, "Along the Rio Grande With Maureen O'Hara,"
that features the delightful reminisces of co-star O'Hara, and Andrew
McLaglen, the director son of Victor McLaglen, a "Rio Grande" costar
and a popular member of director Ford's stock company of players.</LD>
<TE>   O'Hara also supplies the scene-specific commentary for the movie,
and she's marvelous as she talks about the genesis of "Rio Grande"
and how much she loved working with the Duke -- it was their first of
six films together -- and Ford.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD of "High Noon" is unique because the offspring of the
stars and creative talent provide the commentary -- Oscar-winner
Cooper's daughter Maria Cooper-Janis; screenwriter and producer Carl
Foreman's son Jonathan; director Zinnemann's son Tim; and John
Ritter, the son of Tex Ritter, who sang the Academy Award-winning
theme song, "High Noon (Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darlin')." Each one
gives a personal and heartfelt glimpse into his or her father's
participation in this classic. The disc also features a lovely
digitally remastered picture and restored audio, trailers, a radio
broadcast with Tex Ritter, a chapter stop for the song and a new
"Behind High Noon" documentary hosted by Cooper-Janis.</TE>
<TE>   The late Singing Cowboy Autry has been in the news a lot this week
with his beloved Anaheim Angels winning the World Series. For those
who want to check out some of his classic B western musicals, the
Autry Museum of Western Heritage and Gene Autry Entertainment
recently released six of his films on video ($13 each, $70 for the
set). Each film is uncut and fully restored: "The Big Show," "Home in
Wyomin,' " "Mexicali Rose," "Ridin' on a Rainbow," "Sierra Sue" and
"Western Jamboree." The movies were produced between 1936 and 1941,
with "The Big Show" from 1936 featuring Leonard Slye, who later
became better known as Roy Rogers. The 1941 film "Ridin' on a
Rainbow" features Autry singing his Oscar-nominated tune, "Be Honest
With Me." Smiley Burnett plays his faithful comic sidekick, Frog
Millhouse. The videos are available at the Autry Museum and at
www.autry-museum.org.</TE>

<DH>Turner Classic Movies corrals a herd of western films in a
monthlong tribute to slow-talking but quick-drawing heroes.</DH>

<LD>Don't tell the folks at Turner Classic Movies that the western is
dead. The all-movie channel has lassoed the most comprehensive
collection of movie westerns ever made for its "The Every Great
Western (Except 'Shane') Film Festival" that begins Saturday with an
all-day tribute to John Wayne.</LD>
<LD>   About that series title, TCM vice president of program production
Tom Brown says the cable outlet decided to be upfront. Although there
are 167 sagebrush sagas in the festival, it wasn't able to get the
rights to the 1953 classic, "Shane." "Why don't we just admit it," he
says.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, not every film in the festival is great. There are a
few prairie dogs, including the tepid Anthony Quinn Western, "The
Guns for San Sebastian," and the Rat Pack comedy, "4 for Texas." But
those are the exceptions. The festival includes such seminal films as
John Ford's "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" (Saturday); John
Sturges' "Bad Day at Black Rock," Anthony Mann's "The Naked Spur" and
"The Man From Laramie" (all on Tuesday); Richard Brooks' "The
Professionals," Sturges' "The Magnificent Seven" and Sam Peckinpah's
"The Wild Bunch" (all on Thursday); and Sergio Leone's "A Fistful of
Dollars, ""For a Few Dollars More," "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"
and "Once Upon a Time in the West" (Nov. 19).</LD>
<TE>   The festival features action thrillers, musicals, dramas and
comedies. "The festival demonstrates the amazing breadth of the
genre," says Rick Jewell, associate dean of USC's School of
Cinema-Television. "Even though typically the films only cover 40
years of American history, the different approaches to the genre are
just spectacular and it's very well-reflected in this series."</TE>
<TE>   Though the western genre hasn't had a major hit since Clint
Eastwood's Oscar-winner "Unforgiven" a decade ago, "oaters" have
consistently performed well on television and on video and DVD.
"Anytime we show westerns, it is always among our best received
films," Brown says.</TE>
<TE>   The festival actually kicks off at 4 p.m. today with the new
documentary, "John Wayne Made Me Cry: Our Western Heroes," which
features Billy Bob Thornton, Dwight Yoakam and Luke Perry waxing
poetic about their favorite western heroes: Wayne, Gary Cooper, Jimmy
Stewart and Clint Eastwood. It's Thornton who admits that the Duke
made him cry in a scene in 1949's Ford epic, "She Wore a Yellow
Ribbon."</TE>
<TE>   Cowboy poet Baxter Black, a regular commentator on NPR's "Morning
Edition," anchors the documentary with humor and his insights into
the Wild West.</TE>
<TE>   Black says part of the reason why young generations don't have the
passion for westerns that baby boomers and seniors have is that "they
are so tuned to cartoons and the video image of something that to see
a real person riding on a horse is sort of alien to them. Our
children are much more sophisticated and the whole deal behind the
old cowboy movies is that there is a good guy and a bad guy and you
know the difference and there is a code that guides the hero's
behavior and he always wins in the end."</TE>
<TE>   Jewell says it is very difficult to make westerns today because
the premiere directors of the genre such as Ford, Leone, Howard Hawks
and Peckinpah have all died. "So now, if somebody wants to make a
western, he or she has to practically start from scratch. In the old
days, they had these companies of everybody from extras to stunt men
who were used to doing these pictures and knew how to pull them off.
Now that core group of people who did them are gone."</TE>
<TE>   The genre first captured moviegoer's hearts in 1903 with Edwin S.
Porter's "The Great Train Robbery," which airs at 3 a.m. Thursday. It
was the American myth, says Jewell, that fueled the genre. "It's the
myth that we generated ourselves -- our own kind of democratic
populist ideas. I think that, more than anything else, made it so
popular for so long. Young people could look at this kind of
wonderful mythology that developed around the rugged landscape, the
taming of nature, the civilizing of the West and they could get into
it. It had action, it had romance and it had a beautiful energy."</TE>
<TE>   But by the 1960s, cynicism entered westerns. Good guys weren't
that good. The Indians no longer were the bad guys. "There were
certain things we assumed that we didn't buy into any more," Jewell
says. "It was assumed that we did the right thing in sort of rumbling
through the West and taking care of the Native Americans along the
way. It was kind of assumed that it was OK to use violent means in
this wild and wooly kind of country.... We are sensitive to that and
all of these things kind of eroded the myth of the Western to the
point where it just didn't have the same kind of meaning anymore."If
anything can restore meaning, it just could be a collection of the
genre's greats (aside from "Shane").</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "John Wayne Made Me Cry: Our Western Heroes" can be seen at 4 p.m.
today on TCM; "The Every Great Western (Except Shane) Film Festival"
begins at 3 a.m. Saturday with "Haunted Gold" starring John Wayne.
The series continues every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday through the
end of November.</TE>

<DH>In 'Frida,' 'Bowling for Columbine' and other current
independent movies, animation is being inserted to help tell the
story and evoke emotion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Mallory</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Astrange thing happens in "Frida," Julie Taymor's new film about
painter Frida Kahlo, when she has a nightmare after a near-death
experience. It also occurs in the middle of "Bowling for Columbine,"
Michael Moore's documentary salvo against America's gun culture. It
happens as well in this fall's black comedy "Just a Kiss" whenever a
character on screen steps into dangerous territory. Likewise for the
coming-of-age chronicle "The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys," released
earlier this year, when the lead teen character retreats into the
private world of his mind.</LD>
<LD>   What happens? Each of these live-action films shifts into
animation. Unlike previous combinations of live-action and animation
in studio movies, from Walt Disney's silent "Alice" shorts to Warner
Bros.' "Space Jam," many of today's independent filmmakers are using
the medium in startlingly different ways.</LD>
<LD>   The 1998 German film "Run Lola Run" employed animated segues
between real and subjective time, and the 2001 French hit "Amelie"
whimsically used computer animation to make paintings and a bedroom
lamp come to life. But the current media-mixing phenomenon appears to
have hit in the U.S. with 2001's "Hedwig and the Angry Inch," the
film adaptation of a stage musical about the difficult life of a
transgender East German rock singer.</LD>
<TE>   For that film, writer-director-star John Cameron Mitchell used
animation the way he employed projected slides of artwork in the
stage version, particularly to underscore the key song, "The Origin
of Love."</TE>
<TE>   "With the rock energy, we didn't want any images or beats of the
song to be lost, so we had the drawings," he says. "When we did the
film, there was still a problem of getting the central metaphor,
underlining it and illuminating it, and it seemed natural to me to
extrapolate the drawings into animation."</TE>
<TE>   After viewing the work of several independent animators, Mitchell
brought in Emily Hubley, the daughter of animation legends John and
Faith Hubley. Working directly on paper instead of transferring to
cels, Hubley and a small team of artists used different visual
styles, including a yin-yang image as the visual metaphor of a life
split in two. But Hubley and her team were careful to make sure the
artwork looked as though it had been created by Hansel, the boy who
became Hedwig.</TE>
<TE>   "That was getting the idea across that these were images and ideas
that Hansel had had as a young boy, and as the life story unfolds,
Hedwig has held onto those images," Hubley says.</TE>
<TE>   "The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys" also employs animated
sequences to reveal the inner thoughts of a young boy, this one a
14-year-old Catholic school student named Francis, a fledgling
comic-book artist. Originally, the adaptation of Chris Fuhrman's
novel contained no cartoon segments, and director Peter Care
considered using dream sequences to reflect Francis' interior life.
When subsequent script drafts gave more weight to the character's
passion for cartooning, animation seemed an obvious choice.</TE>
<TE>   Acclaimed comic-book artist and animator Todd McFarlane, the
creator of "Spawn," was hired to create the animated segments
featuring ersatz superhero characters.</TE>
<TE>   "The drawings needed to be a little crude, the staging and acting
a little clunky, and all of it a little unrefined," McFarlane says.
"If you make it too flawless, my perspective was that a 14-year-old
wouldn't think that clearly."</TE>
<TE>   The period between the approval of the storyboards and the
delivery of the footage from the overseas studio providing the actual
animation was, for Care, nerve-racking. "It was the hardest thing in
the world to sit and wait for the most crucial 10 minutes of your
movie in terms of budget and also the emotional weight of the film to
come back," he says.</TE>
<TE>   While the animation for "Altar Boys" is traditional TV action
show-style tooning, the graphics seen in "Just a Kiss" were created
through a digital process dubbed "rotomation," though its developer,
Michael Ventresco of New York-based digital shop Red Scare Inc. had
nothing to do with the name. "I hate the name rotomation," Ventresco
declares, blaming Greenstreet Films, which produced the picture, for
the moniker. "It's just animation. It's moving graphics with, in some
cases, reference to the real world."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike its namesake "rotoscoping," a process in which live action
is traced frame by frame, rotomation involves putting the live-action
images into a computer and animating over the shape outlines. "The
top level was [a] hard ink line and that would be a combination of
drawing and digital-edge detection," he says. "We ran the same
process for shadows, tones and highlights."</TE>
<TE>   "Just a Kiss" director Fisher Stevens believes the animation was
the key to making the movie work. "I was struggling over how to tell
the story and let people know it's OK to laugh, because it is a black
comedy," he says. "I used [animation] whenever there was a warning
sign that one of the characters was going to do something that they
shouldn't necessarily do," Stevens explains.</TE>
<TE>   Working within a budget of only $1 million, Stevens was forced to
shoot on digi-beta instead of film. Because the shots that would be
animated required extra fill light to make certain the shapes and
form edges were separated clearly enough in the digitally shot image
for the animators, the director had to sit down with the script and
determine where each bit of animation would go.</TE>
<TE>   "Just a Kiss" was shot in the summer of 2000, and also took a long
time to reach the screen, though Stevens maintains that the animation
process was only partially responsible for the delays. Making the
digi-beta footage look more "filmic," he says, was also a factor.</TE>
<TE>   For "Frida" director Julie Taymor (who previously used graphic
enhancement in her 1999 Shakespearean adaptation "Titus") employed a
variety of animation techniques, the most startling of which was a
stop-motion depiction of painter Frida Kahlo's near-death nightmare
in which she is treated by a grotesque, skeletal hospital staff. "It
is the first sequence in the movie that tells you this is not going
to be a normal biopic," says Taymor.</TE>
<TE>   This sequence was created by the London-based, American-born twins
Stephen and Timothy Quay, known professionally as the Brothers Quay.
"I have loved their animation for years," Taymor says, "and I wanted
to do [Frida's] nightmare as a Day of the Dead sequence where the
doctors were all skeletons and the beds were skeletal. It came from
something that Frida had said, that when she was in the hospital:
'Death danced all around her.' "</TE>
<TE>   After providing the Quays with Dia de los Muertos materials from
Mexico and photos from the hospital set on which she was shooting,
Taymor gave the animators free reign, asking only that the result be
"mysterious and not too concrete, something that would remain
slightly awash in your imagination and in shadow."</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Michael Moore opted to use a three-minute animated
sequence in "Bowling for Columbine" depicting the history of violence
and fear in America as a way of making reality more palatable for
audiences. "Animation gives you the freedom to say the things that
need to be said," Moore says. "This particular section of my film,
'The Brief History of the United States,' has the potential to be a
very bitter pill for many viewers to swallow in terms of my take on
how we got to where we're at, and animation is the big spoonful of
sugar that helps the medicine go down."</TE>
<TE>   Moore says that working with New York independent animator Harold
Moss on the sequence, which was created using Flash animation for
"just a few thousand dollars," inspired him to write a full-length
animated feature with political cartoonist Tom Tomorrow.</TE>
<TE>   While the $12-million budgets for "Altar Boys" and "Frida" were
multiples of the costs of "Hedwig," "Just a Kiss" or "Columbine,"
they are still firmly within the low-budget realm. And although
digital animation has become standard in mainstream Hollywood films,
either for settings, backgrounds, special effects, stunts or crowd
scenes, it is clearly the low-budget independent films that are
putting their limited dollars toward taking such stylistic risks.</TE>
<TE>   "Other cinematic forms, like musicals, have percolated down to the
indies," explains Mitchell. "Animation is just one of those wonderful
tools for telling a story, and people who are maybe thinking outside
the box are using the old-fashioned styles. I wouldn't be surprised
if you see silent film again."</TE>

<HD>Gotcha -- fooling the eye and centuries of art lovers</HD>
<DH>The National Gallery exhibition 'Deceptions and Illusions'
delves into the history of trompe l'oeil painting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stanley Meisler</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Earl A. Powell III, director of the National Gallery of
Art, toured the latest show in his museum 10 days before its opening.</LD>
<LD>   Workers were still adding the final touches as he made his way
through the exhibition. In the last room, as he took in the
paintings, he noticed, out of the corner of his eye, a young woman
with long blond hair, jeans and running shoes admiring a work by
Belgian surrealist Rene Magritte.</LD>
<LD>   "Have you met the courier from Cincinnati?" called out Mark
Leithauser, the gallery's director of design. Powell, an outgoing man
known to his staff and friends as Rusty, turned to greet the young
woman. As he did so, Leithauser burst into laughter. Powell had been
hoodwinked. The young woman was "Portrait of Kim," an incredibly
lifelike sculpture created by American artist Duane Hanson in 1996.</LD>
<TE>   Hoodwinking the customer -- even the museum director -- is the
main point of the exhibition, "Deceptions and Illusions: Five
Centuries of Trompe l'Oeil Painting," which is on view at its sole
venue, the National Gallery, until March 2. Trompe l'oeil is a French
expression that means "deceive the eye," and it is used to describe a
genre of painting in which the artist tries to fool the spectator
into thinking that the depicted object not only looks real but is
real. For this show, the National Gallery has added several
sculptures like those of Hanson that try to do the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition mixes art history with a little bit of P.T. Barnum
and Harry Houdini. Even when you know what you're seeing is meant to
deceive, you still get fooled.</TE>
<TE>   Organized by guest curator Sybille Ebert-Schifferer, the
exhibition makes clear that the sharpest practitioners of such
deception were a group of 19th century American painters led by
William M. Harnett. Ebert-Schifferer, who is director of the
Bibliotheca Hertziana at the Max Planck Institute for Art History in
Rome, had been astounded by these artists when she attended an
exhibition of American art 20 years ago. That eventually led to her
scholarly interest in trompe l'oeil and the invitation by the
National Gallery to mount this show in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Although trompe l'oeil didn't get its French name until 1800,
illusion and deception have long been a tradition in painting. Roman
historian Pliny the Elder wrote that classical Greek artist Zeuxis
painted a bunch of grapes so well in the 5th century BC that birds
swooped down on the canvas and tried to eat the fruit. Another
painter, Parrhasios, then showed Zeuxis his own canvas, seemingly
covered by a lace curtain. When Zeuxis tried to pull off the curtain
to see the painting, he discovered to his embarrassment that the
curtain itself was the painting.</TE>
<TE>   These paintings have long been lost in antiquity, but Pliny's
story has inspired artists since the Italian Renaissance to try their
hand at deceptive grapes and curtains. "Ghost Clock," a contemporary
sculpture by American Wendell Castle, fooled most people at the show.
It looks like a 7-foot-high grandfather clock partially wrapped in a
white sheet, but, in fact, the entire sculpture, including the sheet,
is carved mahogany.</TE>
<TE>   Another kind of crowd deceiver is Louis-Leopold Boilly's painting
"A Collection of Drawings." He coined the term trompe l'oeil, and his
contribution here looks like a pile of prints and drawings packed
beneath broken glass. On opening day, gallery goers continually
pointed out the damage to each other and some even argued that it was
real.</TE>
<TE>   In the 13th century, according to legend, Italian artist Giotto
enjoyed painting little flies on his canvas and then watching his
master, Cimabue, try to shoo them off. This story inspired later
Italian artists to do likewise. In the exhibition's 16th century
portrait of "Cardinal Bandinello Sauli and Three Companions,"
Sebastiano del Piombo tries his hand at the same deception. Over the
years, even National Geographic and several scholarly journals have
tried to improve their reproductions of the painting by air-brushing
out what they assumed was an interloping insect.</TE>
<TE>   There are many good "fooled you" stories here. Harnett's work was
so realistic that U.S. Treasury agents once seized his painting of a
$5 note because they thought he had counterfeited the bill and then
glued it onto the canvas. His "After the Hunt," painted in 1884, hung
in a saloon on Broadway in New York for many years while drunkards
and out-of-towners wagered whether the hat, horn, rifle, rabbit and
birds were real or paint.</TE>
<TE>   In my own favorite in the show, Harnett's contemporary, Jefferson
David Chalfant, painted a 4-cent stamp alongside a real 4-cent stamp
in the early 1890s and then added what looks like a real newspaper
clipping that reads, "Mr. Chalfant pasted a real stamp beside his
painting and asks, 'Which is which?' " I couldn't tell.</TE>
<TE>   Trompe l'oeil has long been derided by the art establishment. "If
the excellency of a painter consisted only in this kind of
imitation," 18th century British portrait painter Joshua Reynolds
said, "painting must lose its rank." John Ruskin, a 19th century
British critic, deplored its limitations: "We can paint a cat or a
fiddle, so that they look as if we could take them up but we cannot
imitate the ocean, or the Alps."</TE>
<TE>   Still, there are enough works by painters such as 17th century
Spaniard Bartolome Esteban Murillo and the 20th century Magritte to
make it clear that even the finest artists have employed trompe
l'oeil. Pablo Picasso, whose work is included in the exhibition,
turned the genre on its head by creating collages in which papers
were pasted on canvas to make them look as if they were painted.</TE>
<TE>   But Ebert-Schifferer believes that the quality of trompe l'oeil
has been underestimated. She maintains that the genre's power comes
from a tension between reality and illusion that is "a visual
reflection of scientific and philosophical uncertainties."</TE>
<TE>   Standing in front of the artworks, amid the smiles, guffaws and
oh-my-goshes, the critical debate hardly matters. Whether or not
they're great works of art, the paintings and sculptures in the show
are all great fun.</TE>

<KH>SPRING 2003 / L.A. FASHION WEEK</KH>
<HD>Local designers play David to N.Y.'s Goliath</HD>

<LD>Every six months, L.A. fashion week rolls around and so do the
questions. Why don't New York's top magazine editors march their
Manolos out here to see the latest designer offerings? Why won't
Gisele grace our runways with her signature Clydesdale clip-clop?
(She does live here.) And why, oh why, can't we have a catty front
row?</LD>
<LD>   But maybe the better question is, why would L.A. want to compete
with Seventh Avenue and the capitals of Europe?</LD>
<LD>   "Anyone who thinks we are trying to go up against Goliath New York
is kidding themselves," said Rose Apodaca-Jones, West Coast bureau
chief of apparel trade bible Women's Wear Daily. "I see L.A. becoming
more of a secondary market like London. Just as editors, stylists and
buyers turn to London for edgy talent, they've already started
turning to L.A."</LD>
<TE>   The runway shows here draw interest not because they feature
designers who are known but because they feature designers who are
largely unknown, which anyone involved in fashion will tell you is
the lifeblood of the business. "It's an opportunity for designers who
may be established names among Fred Segal-goers but that buyers
nationally don't know," said Karen Mamont, executive director of
marketing for the former California Mart, now called California
Market Center, which houses many of L.A.'s apparel showrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Just as London's fashion week has done over the years, L.A.'s
fashion week -- a twice-annual showcase for new designers in venues
across the city -- can function as a kind of laboratory of funky
street fashion and youthful trends.</TE>
<TE>   "The purpose is to give young designers a place to show their work
importantly ... in a safe zone without the pressure of New York,"
said Lisa Love, West Coast editor of Vogue.</TE>
<TE>   Today through Tuesday, at such venues as a Frank Lloyd Wright
house and a Hollywood rooftop parking lot, more than 60 local
designers are scheduled to show spring collections. You've never
heard of most of them.</TE>
<TE>   Seven designers from CLAD, (the Coalition of L.A. Designers), a
kind of nonprofit support group for up-and-comers, will take over the
Farmers and Merchant Bank Building in downtown L.A., and Jennifer
Nicholson (Jack's daughter) will present her collection at a Venice
art studio. Gen-Art, a New York nonprofit that has hosted shows here
since 1998, has nabbed the Mayan Theatre for its "Fresh Faces" group
show, including the runway debut of Kate O'Connor, whose painterly
knit ponchos have been a hit among the Fred Segal set since last
year. And David Cardona, Jared Gold, Petro Zillia, Eduardo Lucero,
Alicia Lawhon and Freddie Rojas, all L.A. fashion week vets familiar
to the cognoscenti, are showing at different venues around the city.
(See www.fashionweekla.com for a complete list.)</TE>
<TE>   Vogue's high priestess Anna Wintour and Allure's Linda Wells won't
be in town, but there will be local editors and writers from those
magazines as well as Glamour, In Style, W and Vanity Fair. And,
although the fashion directors of department stores don't make the
trek to L.A., they do send minions to scour the showrooms of the
former California Mart and to attend some runway shows. Expected are
buyers from Barneys New York, Henri Bendel and Saks Fifth Avenue in
New York; Harvey Nichols and Selfridges &amp; Co. in London; Le Bon
Marche in Paris. L.A. stores Fred Segal, Beige, Blonde, Curve and
Diavolina will also be represented.</TE>
<TE>   "We look to L.A. for something new and different," said Saks
market director Colleen Sherin. "It's the West Coast laboratory for
American designers."</TE>
<TE>   But one of the most hotly anticipated events isn't even a fashion
show. After several seasons as an unstructured, loosely coordinated
event, L.A. fashion week may soon have an umbrella organizer.
Tonight, fashion event production company 7th on Sixth, which
produces New York's Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week, is hosting a party to
announce its intent to organize next season's fashion week here. They
plan to hold it under a tent in the parking lot of downtown L.A.'s
Standard hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of the reason we are coming is to give a little sense of
order," said Fern Mallis, director of 7th on Sixth, which has had its
fair share of criticism for its management of New York fashion week
there. Although 7th on Sixth has been down this road before,
promising to produce shows this season only to pull out, the fashion
community seems receptive to the latest plans.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an opportunity for 7th on Sixth to grow," said Ilse
Metchek, executive director of the California Fashion Assn., an
L.A.-based group that serves as an industry voice. "We are hopping.
Things are going on here and our new designers are in vogue. The
designers in New York are same old same old."</TE>
<TE>   Darren Gold, president of CLAD and co-designer of Mhope, agrees.
"It's positive that we are hitting the radar and that maybe we are
going to step up and take our place in world fashion."</TE>
<TE>   The corporate sponsorship money 7th on Sixth could bring would
increase the production value of L.A.'s amateurish shows and give
them a central location. And even a little press here is more than
most designers would get during New York fashion week, with its
overcrowded schedule and mega-names.</TE>
<TE>   The L.A. market will always be known for moderately priced,
trend-driven clothing -- track suits from Juicy Couture, low-slung
jeans from Seven, board shorts from Quiksilver -- which doesn't
particularly lend itself to slick, high-priced fashion shows. But in
a town that is the birthplace of so many lifestyle trends, there is
also a place for designer runways. "A fashion week is needed here to
complete the cultural cycle," said Vogue's Love, adding, "Why not
have an industry that's more than just jeans and T-shirts?"</TE>
<TE>   The fashion world is seeking new talent, especially now that the
economy has put a damper on retail sales. "It's a time that new ideas
are needed," said Sharon Ryan, who heads the career development
center at L.A.'s Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising.
"People are looking for something to spur business and get consumers
excited."</TE>
<TE>   Saks Fifth Avenue has joined Henri Bendel in hosting "open see"
auditions for undiscovered designers twice a year here and in New
York. L.A. fashion week is a similar opportunity. Even if the runway
shows here don't lead to immediate store orders, they can be a
springboard, as London's are, to New York, Milan and the real fashion
Goliath, Paris.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important to go out and support these people, to give them
your feedback," said Shauna Stein, co-owner of the local boutique On
Beverly Boulevard. "Some of the L.A. designers need to broaden their
strokes a little bit. But if no one is giving them feedback, how do
you expect them to develop?"</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Chicago Botanic Garden has purchased one of the world's premier
collections of rare botanical books and journals.</LD>
<LD>   The 30-year-old museum park in Glencoe, Ill., bought 2,219 books
and 2,000 horticultural journals from the financially strapped
Horticultural Society in Boston. Both institutions declined to
disclose the sale price, but letters filed with the Massachusetts
attorney general's office in July put it at about $3 million.</LD>
<LD>   Library and rare book experts say the purchase establishes the
suburban Chicago institution as a major academic research center.
"Books like this just don't turn up on the market anymore," said
Peter Forstas, a Chicago rare book dealer who appraised the
Massachusetts collection before the sale.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>He didn't win the best actor prize for which he'd been nominated, but
the late Richard Harris was honored nonetheless at the fifth annual
British Independent Film Awards.</LD>
<LD>   The award for his lifetime contribution to the cinema was accepted
in London on Wednesday night by Harris' three sons: Damian, Jared and
Jamie. Harris, whose credits ranged from "This Sporting Life" and "A
Man Called Horse" to the first two "Harry Potter" movies, died last
Friday at a London hospital, where he had been receiving treatment
for Hodgkin's disease.</LD>
<LD>   A posthumous tribute also was paid to former Beatle George
Harrison, who died last year at 58, for his work as an independent
movie producer.</LD>
<TE>   Harris, 72 when he died, had been nominated for a best actor prize
for "My Kingdom" but lost to James Nesbitt, who won for "Bloody
Sunday." Ken Loach's "Sweet Sixteen" was named best British
independent film, while the movie's young star, Martin Compston, was
named best newcomer. Samantha Morton was named best actress for her
role in "Morvern Callar."</TE>

<HD>Nederlander to manage Grove</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Operation of the Grove Theater of Anaheim will be taken over by the
Nederlander Organization under an agreement with the theater's new
owner, the city of Anaheim.</LD>
<LD>   The city bought the 1,700-capacity theater, which occupies part of
the Edison International Field parking lot, in September for $6.7
million from Philadelphia-based SMG.</LD>
<LD>   SMG had owned and operated it for the past two years. Anaheim
takes ownership on Monday.</LD>
<TE>   No major changes are planned, including the name, at least
initially, says Nederlander general manager Mike Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia said Nederlander will continue to use the Grove as SMG had
for some private and corporate functions, "but we are a concert
promotion company and we do plan to put concerts in there."</TE>
<TE>   Under SMG, the Grove has given only minimal competition to the
nearby House of Blues in Anaheim, but the presence of the more
aggressive Nederlander group, which also books concerts at the
adjacent Arrowhead Pond, is expected to raise the Grove's profile on
the Orange County concert scene.</TE>

<LD>   Martinez, who was to join original judges Simon Cowell, Paula
Abdul and Randy Jackson for the Fox talent-search show's second

<LD>   It became "too uncomfortable for me to tell someone else to give
up on their dream, especially when I realized that many of them have
supported my musical career," Martinez said in a statement.</LD>

<HD>Marsalis' dynamic statement</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Howard Reich</AU>
<BD>Chicago Tribune</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Wynton Marsalis' epic suite "All Rise" (****, Sony) had its
world premiere in New York, in 1999, the sprawling work proved
somewhat episodic, its cast of symphonic musicians, jazz
instrumentalists and gospel choir only sporadically functioning in
tandem. But the new CD recording by Marsalis' Lincoln Center Jazz
Orchestra, Esa-Pekka Salonen's Los Angeles Philharmonic and fully
three choral groups (including the Northridge Singers of Cal State
Northridge) reveals "All Rise" for the masterpiece it is.</LD>
<LD>   In many ways, it stands as Marsalis' most brilliant large
composition to date. Certainly it addresses a broader array of
musical languages than the trumpeter-composer's great "Blood on the
Fields -- which won a Pulitzer Prize in 1997 -- and takes on even
more ambitious subject matter than his jazz-meets-gospel instrumental
suite "In This House, On This Morning."</LD>
<LD>   The miracle of "All Rise" -- a quasi-religious work that
contemplates the nature of faith and redemption -- is that its 12
stylistically free-ranging movements cohere as a single, dynamic
statement.</LD>
<TE>   After a stunning, Stravinsky-influenced opening movement, the work
explores everything from all-American hoedown music (in the "Wild
Strumming of Fiddle" movement) to Argentine tango (in the orchestral
tour de force "El Gran Baile de la Reina") to gospel-tinged choral
exhortations (in the work's grand finale).</TE>
<TE>   Conductor Salonen finds continuity among these divergent musical
elements, in a work that reaffirms Marsalis' position as one of the
most accomplished composers working today, genre notwithstanding.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chano Dominguez in two worlds</TE>
<TE>   Various artists have dabbled in merging flamenco and jazz, but few
have done so with half the eloquence and authenticity of pianist
Chano Dominguez, who leads a band of bona fide virtuosos on "Hecho a
mano" (****, Sunnyside). (The title translates to "handmade.")</TE>
<TE>   To hear Dominguez's rhythmically volatile jazz pianism accompanied
by a band steeped in flamenco tradition is to behold an artistic
breakthrough. Whether Dominguez is performing works of his own or
standards by Bill Evans and Thelonious Monk, his music sounds natural
and persuasive, as if flamenco rhythms and jazz improvisational
techniques were born for each other.</TE>
<TE>   Surely this recording succeeds because of Dominguez's mastery of
both worlds. The fiery dance motifs that guitarist Tomatito (also
known as Jose Fernandez Torres) articulates on "Retaila," for
instance, are answered by rhythmically explosive, unpredictable jazz
improvisations from Dominguez. Similarly, the exotic scales and lush
chords that Dominguez plays on a fandango called "Pinar hondo" become
fodder for guitarist Nono Garcia, the two musicians riffing in a jazz
style but within a flamenco context.</TE>
<TE>   Backed by keenly sensitive percussionists, Dominguez has produced
not only a glorious merger of music of Iberia and the Americas, but
also one of the most original albums of the year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fearless, ferocious 'Freedom Suite'</TE>
<TE>   The David S. Ware Quartet's combustive re-imagining of Sonny
Rollins' classic "Freedom Suite" veers further from the original than
Branford Marsalis' practically neo-classic version of the work
earlier this year (on "Footsteps of Our Fathers"). For sheer ferocity
of expression, fearlessness of conception and brilliance of delivery,
the Ware version (*** 1/2, AUM Fidelity) is hard to beat, the tenor
saxophonist using Rollins' themes as springboards for thunderous
saxophone rhetoric.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, Ware's tenor orations often push into an abstract region
that some listeners might call free jazz, yet his solos are so
magnificent in their sweep, so propulsive in rhythmic drive and so
linear in melodic development that they prove impossible to resist.
With the formidable Matthew Shipp adding his all-over-the-keyboard
virtuosity to a work originally recorded without piano, it's clear
that this band has reconceived the original from top to bottom.</TE>
<TE>   Guillermo E. Brown's impressionistic drums and William Parker's
tonally resplendent bass help this quartet to sound much larger and
mightier than the sum of its parts. In the end, this "Freedom Suite"
is so broad in scope and vast in expressive range that it stands as a
fitting response to Rollins' masterwork.</TE>

<HD>British launch effort to keep Raphael work</HD>
<DH>London's National Gallery will try to match Getty's
estimated $50-million offer for 'Madonna of the Pinks.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christopher Reynolds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>London's National Gallery, beset by tight finances, is nevertheless
launching a campaign to match the J. Paul Getty Museum's offer of an
estimated $50 million for a Raphael painting owned by the Duke of
Northumberland.</LD>
<LD>   The 16th century work, "Madonna of the Pinks," is one of several
by Raphael on display in the museum, where it has been on loan for
about a decade. Authorities say it is apparently the last undisputed
Raphael painting still in private ownership -- thus, its sale is
probably the last chance any museum will have to acquire such an
important work by the Italian Renaissance artist, who died in 1520.
Getty officials confirmed Wednesday that they had a purchase
agreement with the Duke of Northumberland's estate, providing the
British government allows the work to leave the country.</LD>
<LD>   Although Getty officials declined to discuss price, sources close
to the deal put it at about $50 million, and National Gallery
officials have named that amount as their fund-raising target. A
gallery spokeswoman said the institution in recent days asked the
British Heritage Lottery Fund for a grant of 20 million British
pounds, about $31.4 million.</LD>
<TE>   "We hope to raise the rest from private sources," the spokeswoman
said. Losing the painting, she added, "would be a great loss to this
nation. The picture has been here for 150 years."</TE>
<TE>   Under British law, export of an artwork can be blocked if a
government panel decides it has vital artistic or historical
significance, and if a buyer within the U.K. can match the proposed
sale price. Officials at the Getty and the National Gallery said the
timetable for decisions on the Raphael has not yet been set, but in
the past, the settling of such export-license cases has typically
taken several months.</TE>
<TE>   The National Gallery spokeswoman acknowledged that the odds
against the institution holding onto the Raphael are steep. Although
the nation's Heritage Lottery Fund has been used in the past for art
purchases, the government's National Gallery funding has been
curtailed of late. In mid-October, the British Department for
Culture, Media and Sport announced that its "baseline annual grant"
to the National Gallery would remain flat from 2001-02 through
2003-04, at about $30 million.</TE>
<TE>   The gallery's director, Charles Saumarez Smith, complained
publicly about the funding, and said it meant that the gallery this
year would have no money set aside for acquisitions. That, he said,
is a first in 50 years and a notable decline from the roughly $5
million made available in 1997. Apart from the possibility of a
lottery-fund grant, the museum spokeswoman said Thursday, "we can't
rely on government sources at all."</TE>

<HD>A two-disc set for the Spider-fans</HD>
<DH>Offering commentaries, factoids and other extras, the
'Spider-Man' DVD spins an appealing web for lovers of the blockbuster
movie.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since its theatrical release in May, "Spider-Man" has earned more
than $700 million worldwide, and with its $400-million domestic
gross, the action-fantasy starring Tobey Maguire as Spidey is on
track to become the third highest-grossing movie of all time in its
first release.</LD>
<LD>   So is the DVD of the box-office hit based on the popular Marvel
Comics superhero a similar blockbuster? Well, not exactly. It's
perfectly enjoyable, and it weaves a spell of fun for its legion of
fans, but it just misses soaring into the stratosphere.</LD>
<LD>   The two-disc set of "Spider-Man" (Columbia TriStar, $29), which
hits stores today, is available in both widescreen and full screen.
The first disc includes a fun factoid track called "Weaving the Web,"
which offers pop-up production notes and historical facts, and
commentary with director Sam Raimi, co-producer Grant Curtis,
producer Laura Ziskin and star Kirsten Dunst. Notably missing from
the track are Maguire and Willem Dafoe, who plays Spidey's nemesis,
the Green Goblin.</LD>
<TE>   The Raimi and Curtis portion of the commentary was recorded
separately from the Ziskin and Dunst commentary, so the end result is
a bit discombobulated, but each group offers insights into the film's
production.</TE>
<TE>   A secondary commentary track, which gets a bit too technical at
times, includes special effects designer John Dykstra and members of
the visual effects crew. There is also a kicky track called
"Branching Web-i-sodes," which offers a lengthy interview with the
film's spider wrangler.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the first disc are the obligatory trailers, TV spots,
filmographies and music videos. The DVD-ROM allows viewers to read
the comic book while watching the movie and even to record their own
commentary track.</TE>
<TE>   The second disc includes a passable HBO "Making of" documentary, a
lightweight "Spider-Mania" special from E! Entertainment Special, a
profile of director Raimi -- pointing out, among other things, that
he always wears suits and ties on the set -- an informative profile
of composer Danny Elfman, disappointing screen tests with Maguire,
J.K. Simmons and the computer-generated image (CGI) of Spider-Man,
costume and makeup tests, a lackluster gag and outtakes reel and a
conceptual art and production designer gallery. The best feature on
the second disc is the historical documentary "Spider-Man -- The
Mythology of the 21st Century," which features interviews with
Spidey's colorful co-creator Stan Lee and several of the artists who
have drawn the comic books.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD-ROM offers three Marvel.com comics, including "Peter
Parker: Return of the Goblin."</TE>
<TE>   The VHS version ($25) features a music video, and a special
collector's-edition gift-set DVD ($40) also includes the "Stan Lee's
Mutants, Monsters &amp; Marvels" DVD; a reprint of "Amazing Fantasy #15,"
which introduced Spider-Man; a limited-edition lithograph by
Spider-Man artists John Romita Sr. and John Romita Jr.; and a film
cel from the movie, selected by Raimi, with his comments.</TE>
<TE>   In conjunction with the release of the feature, Buena Vista Home
Video has unfurled "Spider-Man: The Return of the Green Goblin" ($15
for VHS, $20 for DVD), which features four animated episodes from the
animated 1990s TV series in which Spidey goes up against the Green
Goblin and the Hobgoblin. The modest but enjoyable DVD also features
introductions to each episode by Lee, an interview with Lee, an
episode from the classic 1967 ABC animated series "The Terrible
Triumph of Dr. Octopus" and an interactive game with Spidey's evil
nemeses.</TE>

<HD>'Santa Clause 2' not much of a gift</HD>
<DH>The sequel, again starring Tim Allen, starts promisingly
but quickly becomes ponderous and loses its energy as it packs on too
much extra plot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When "The Santa Clause," starring Tim Allen as a divorced, workaholic
toy company marketing whiz who suddenly has the mantle of St. Nick
thrust upon him, was released in November 1994, it deservedly became
a popular Christmas movie -- a sweet-and-sour fantasy that connected
with the frequently splintered families of the hard-driving '90s.</LD>
<LD>   It's understandable that Disney would be eager to make a sequel,
and while the studio can hardly be accused of rushing to capitalize
on the first, it nevertheless went into production with a mishmash of
a script with five writers, working from a story by three more
writers, including the original film's Steve Rudnick and Leo
Benvenuti. The result is a ponderous disappointment that puts Allen
to an unjustly severe test.</LD>
<TE>   Just 28 days before Christmas, Santa discovers that his contract
-- who knew he had a contract? --requires that he come up with a Mrs.
Claus or lose his job. This is a premise with potential, with Santa
having to keep his toy workshop at the North Pole going full blast
while resuming his identity as Scott Calvin and returning home to his
picture-postcard community to find and win a wife in record time. As
it happens he must return home anyway to straighten out his troubled
son, Charlie (Eric Lloyd), who has run afoul of his severe middle
school principal (Elizabeth Mitchell), who has lost the spirit of
Christmas, which naturally means she will wind up the leading
candidate to become the First Lady of the North Pole.</TE>
<TE>   This surely sounds more than enough plot for a movie, but possibly
somebody in a power position became worried that a holiday picture
centering on a romance might not have enough kiddie appeal.
Consequently, Santa's chief elves, Curtis (Spencer Breslin) and
Bernard (David Krumholtz), pop Santa in a Rube Goldberg/Jules
Verne-like replicating device that produces a plasticized Santa as a
stand-in while he's away but who swiftly proves to be a tyrant who
cranks out an army of giant wooden soldiers to enforce his will and
ultimately threatens to destroy Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   It would have been much wiser --and logical --to leave the
operation of the workshop in the experienced hands of Bernard and
Curtis. All these developments and challenges facing Santa weigh down
the plot so heavily that they drain all the film of its energy and
needlessly strain credibility (even a fantasy needs some
credibility), leaving director Michael Lembeck to keep things moving
as best he can. Under the circumstances the usual crowd-pleaser
special effects and fantasy characters and elements don't count for
much.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Burrough's vast Toy Workshop and Elf Village at the North
Pole is the film's strongest asset. The workshop is a dazzling and
accurate display of the Art Nouveau style in sinuous full flower, a
worthy homage to such architects as Hector Guimard, who designed
those turn of the last century Paris Metro entrances, as familiar a
City of Lights image as the Eiffel Tower. (The Reindeer's Stable, in
turn, is an homage to Barcelona's Antonio Gaudi with its exuberant
tiled-paved, bizarrely shaped architectural elements.)</TE>
<TE>   Considering the abrupt changes Mitchell's uptight principal is
required to undergo, the actress manages to pull together an
appealing and even credible characterization. Allen has essentially
been asked to hold together the film's two basically disparate
stories, and there are moments when he succeeds through sheer dint of
his regular-guy charisma. What the filmmakers may have done by
conflating two plots in "The Santa Clause 2" is inadvertently
guarantee that there will be no "Santa Clause 3."</TE>

<HD>In the cradle of magical realism</HD>
<DH>In his autobiography, Gabriel Garcia Marquez says he was
shaped by this quirky town.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. Christian Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ARACATACA, Colombia</DL>
<LD>Many years later, when he sat down to face his computer screen,
Gabriel Garcia Marquez would write about that distant afternoon when
his mother insisted that he accompany her to sell his childhood home
here.</LD>
<LD>   At that time, in 1950, Aracataca was a forgotten village, built
along the bank of a river of clear water that ran along a bed of
polished stones, white and enormous like prehistoric eggs--or so
Garcia Marquez recalled.</LD>
<LD>   "Now, with more than 75 years measured out, I know it was the most
important decision of many in my career as a writer," he writes in
his just released autobiography. "That is to say, the most important
decision in my life."</LD>
<TE>   Garcia Marquez, now the Nobel Prize-winning eminence grise of
Latin American literature, has just published the first of what he
hopes will be a three-volume autobiography titled "Vivir Para
Contarla" or "Living to Tell It." Now available only in Spanish,
Random House has the rights to publish an English translation in the
future. The work is a dreamy account reaching from childhood to the
publication of his first novel, "Leaf Storm," published in 1955.</TE>
<TE>   More than anything, the book is a portrait of a man coming to
terms with his artistry, a self-examination by the former journalist
of the who, what, where, when, why and how of his life. But it is
also a love letter to his past, a fond recollection of the place
where he first gathered the material for his most famous novels,
sweeping and startlingly original works such as "One Hundred Years of
Solitude" and "Love in the Time of Cholera" that have ever since
defined Latin America literature.</TE>
<TE>   "He has said that he owes everything to the fact of having been
born in [Aracataca] and having been raised until 10 or 11 in the home
of his grandparents," said Dasso Saldivar, Garcia Marquez's earlier
biographer. "With complete certainty, I can say that if he had been
born and raised in another place, he would not be the great writer he
is today."</TE>
<TE>   It is the influence of this quirky little village on the man, and
in turn, his influence on the town, that is one of the primary
building blocks of his work.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia Marquez's grandparents helped found Aracataca, a tiny town
wedged between the snow-capped Sierra de Santa Marta mountain range
and a vast marsh known simply as "The Great Swamp." They arrived
after his grandfather killed another man in a duel over family honor,
a story that found its way into "One Hundred Years of Solitude."</TE>
<TE>   His grandfather, Col. Nicolas Ricardo Marquez, fought in one of
Colombia's bloodiest civil wars, known as the War of a Thousand Days.
One of the famous generals in that war, Gen. Rafael Uribe -- a
distant relative of current President Alvaro Uribe -- often visited
the Garcia Marquez home.</TE>
<TE>   The town's economy was, and is today, based on the banana. When
Garcia Marquez was a boy, the entire area was controlled by United
Fruit Co., predecessor to Chiquita Brands International. The
company's iron-fisted dominion led to a protest by banana workers in
1928 that ended in a massacre, with government forces shooting
unarmed civilians. That story too played a prominent role in "One
Hundred Years of Solitude," as well as the autobiography.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, a tour of the town reveals just how closely Garcia
Marquez's novels are intertwined with this place. Macondo, the
fictional town in his novels, is in many ways Aracataca reborn,
molded into a universal symbol where love and hate, vengeance and
jealousy, humor and ridicule play out against a gaudy canvas.</TE>
<TE>   If there is anything that "Living to Tell It" reveals, it is that
Garcia Marquez is an author grounded in place. He signals as much
early in his autobiography, as he tells his mother he has become so
inspired during their visit to his hometown that he will defy his
father by dropping out of school to become an author.</TE>
<TE>   "Tell him I love him very much and that, thanks to him, I am going
to be a writer," he tells her. "Nothing else but a writer."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the voyage, Garcia Marquez writes, he continually read
"Light in August"--a book by William Faulkner, who set many of his
novels in the fictional Yoknapatawpha County, based on Lafayette
County in Mississippi where Faulkner was raised.</TE>
<TE>   The similarities between Macondo and Aracataca are unmistakable.
There are the railroad tracks that run through both towns. The almond
trees and banana groves. The butterflies fluttering everywhere. The
sleepy town square, baking in the heat. And then there is the
surrealism. Even today, Aracataca has a strange and secret feel, like
a beach with a hidden riptide beneath the waves. It is a place that
seems almost lurid with idiosyncrasy.</TE>
<TE>   There is, for instance, Luis Agamez, a toothless, 48-year-old
painter who wanders the town's dirt streets carrying two of his
massive oil paintings. One features the magical Aracataca River. The
other, Garcia Marquez.</TE>
<TE>   "I have painted more than 200 pictures of him," Agamez says,
offering to sell one for $70. "He's my idol. He's the god that
inspires me, apart from the God that inspires all Christians."</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the mayor, Efrain Antonio Garcia, who at first
glance appears a deadly serious bureaucrat. He has fired all but 18
of the city's 543 employees and contractors in a desperate effort to
reduce the city's deficit. Then he recounts his idea to boost
tourism: He hopes to paint every house in town a different color with
paint donated from a nearby factory.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea is to make Aracataca a more attractive place," he says.
"We want to see if we can improve our services to make it an
enjoyable place to stay."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, there is Eduardo Vanegas, a 36-year-old municipal worker.
As he tours through town on his motor scooter, a train bearing heaps
of black coal from Alabama-based Drummond Coal Co. rushes through
town, clack, clack, clack--a metronome far too rapid for the town's
somnolence.</TE>
<TE>   "Does anyone ever get hit by the train?" a visitor asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh sure," Vanegas says, "I was hit three times."</TE>
<TE>   And so the story comes out, how the 8-year-old Vanegas was fishing
on the train bridge one day when the train came into view. He froze,
too terrified to move. He threw himself down on the tracks as the
train rushed over, then raised his head to see what was happening.
The train smashed into the back of his head, sending his forehead
crashing into the sharp edge of the crosstie beneath him. His
brother, fishing nearby, called to him, so he raised his head again
to answer, only to be smashed down again.</TE>
<TE>   Buzzing through town on the motorcycle, deftly dodging stray pigs,
dogs and cows, he lifts his hair to proudly reveal the scars he
carries from the day. He is known even now around town as the "Train
Survivor."</TE>
<TE>   "There were 14 cars," he said, "and I was in the hospital for 14
days. Even Garcia Marquez couldn't make that up."</TE>
<TE>   The concordance between Garcia Marquez's fictional world and his
real one extends even to his childhood home, which the family sold
when it moved off Colombia's Caribbean coast.</TE>
<TE>   Before he won the Nobel Prize in 1982, the government had been
wary of Garcia Marquez's leftist leanings, accusing him of financing
one of this nation's numerous guerrilla groups. But after the award,
they welcomed the prodigal son with open arms, buying his home and
declaring it a museum and national landmark.</TE>
<TE>   But like the colonel in one of Garcia Marquez's stories who waits
for a pension check that never arrives, the museum has sadly rotted
over the years, its funding diverted by government corruption or
indifference. Paint peels off the walls. The smell of mildew fills
the air. The walls seem to sag inward. In back, an auditorium that
was supposed to host cultural affairs sits empty, with no budget to
buy chairs.</TE>
<TE>   Colombia "deserves better than this," says Edgar Perez, the
sad-faced museum director.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the tumbling-down museum, there is little else in town
linked directly to the author. And even as the publication of his
autobiography has sparked in Colombia an unrestrained, almost
delirious celebration of Gabo, as the author is affectionately known,
almost nobody here remembers Garcia Marquez, who moved away when he
was around 8.</TE>
<TE>   There is one relative left, 66-year-old Nicholas Arias, a first
cousin. He met Garcia Marquez only once, when the writer came to town
to sponsor a festival of vallenato, Colombia's accordion-laced brand
of country music.</TE>
<TE>   "When I think of him, I feel proud," said Arias, his eyes shining
out from his face, tanned yet smooth like a worn baseball glove.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a Colombian. A native of this town. And my cousin."</TE>
<TE>   Others have a more mixed reaction.</TE>
<TE>   Vanegas, the train survivor, remembers as a young boy the last
time Garcia Marquez came to visit, after he received the Nobel Prize
in '82. There was a grand presentation in the town square. To prepare
for it, Vanegas and the other children went around capturing
butterflies in big nets, to release as Garcia Marquez made his
speech. Butterflies are found throughout Garcia Marquez's work.</TE>
<TE>   Vanegas says he was inspired by seeing the Nobel Prize winner from
his town. But then Garcia Marquez vanished. "He never came again," he
says. "He hasn't even come back to say hello." Then he grins, and
roars off on his scooter.</TE>
<TE>   But if Vanegas has any lasting anger toward Garcia Marquez, he is
one of only a handful of Colombians to harbor any ill feeling toward
him. Garcia Marquez is perhaps the single most revered person in
Colombia today.</TE>
<TE>   "If you had to define it with only one word, I would say that what
Colombians feel for Garcia Marquez is simply love," says Juan
Gossain, the director of one of Colombia's largest radio networks and
an old Garcia Marquez friend. "Garcia Marquez has demonstrated to the
world that we are not so brutish, so stupid, that we are able to
produce a writer like him, that it's not all violence and coke, that
we are able to produce art."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the Gabomania surrounding the book provides a temporary
relief in a country weary of violence. Colombia's 40-year-old
internal war leaves some 4,000 people dead each year, most of them
civilians. It is a terrible, nearly incomprehensible mesh of drug
violence, territorial control and strife over economic and social
justice.</TE>
<TE>   Local newspapers have devoted countless articles praising his
name. One magazine published an entire issue--including an article
bylined by Fidel Castro, a Garcia Marquez friend and fan--as a paean
to the writer.</TE>
<TE>   A recent editorial in El Tiempo, the country's largest newspaper,
was even more emphatic: "The personal story of Garcia Marquez is an
allegory of the story of Colombia, spattered with violence, magic,
solidarity, austerity, horror, creativity, humor and fantasy," it
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Living to Tell It" sold more than 300,000 copies in Spain in its
first 10 days, and more than 160,000 in Colombia. It is already
undergoing second printings in Peru and Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   The autobiography, begun in the mid-1990s, was completed in a
flurry of concentration after Garcia Marquez was diagnosed with a
rare form of lymphatic cancer in 1999. The cancer is now in
remission, though Garcia Marquez still journeys from his home in
Mexico every three months for check-ups in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   His son, Rodrigo Garcia, lives in L.A., a writer and director
whose credits include the HBO series "Six Feet Under" and the movie
"Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her."</TE>
<TE>   Friends of Garcia Marquez deny that the book originated from a
sense of mortality, despite his sickness and his beloved mother's
death earlier this year. But they differ as to why, exactly, he chose
to write it.</TE>
<TE>   Some say he wanted to provide a guide to his novels, a
self-exegesis to the many works written in a literary style known as
magical realism, which features a realistic narrative interlaced with
the fantastic: sudden shifts in time, the appearance of ghosts and
other improbable events. Others say he wanted to provide a guide to
other writers, a case study of one writer's journey of discovery.</TE>
<TE>   And yet others think he wanted simply to leave his own record of
his life.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia Marquez himself isn't talking. He has granted few
interviews of late, preferring, friends say, to let his work speak
for him. "He wants each person to imagine what they want to imagine
in this work," says journalist Maria Elvira Samper, a close friend in
Bogota. "His autobiography is simply another novel."</TE>

<HD>'I Spy': Mission implausible</HD>
<DH>The latest '60s-era TV show to hit the big screen puts its
stock in the mismatched-partner formula.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth Turan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The new wanna-be espionage comedy starring Eddie Murphy and Owen
Wilson raises so many questions, maybe it should have been called
"Why Spy" instead of "I Spy."</LD>
<LD>   Why, for instance, lift the concept from one of the most
sophisticated TV shows of the 1960s if all you're going to bring to
it is the sitcom sensibility (courtesy of director Betty Thomas) that
previously characterized "Dr. Dolittle" and "Private Parts."</LD>
<LD>   Why take the trouble and expense to stage unconvincing stunts and
half-hearted explosions when the only reason people are going to want
to see the film in the first place is to watch two guys being funny.</LD>
<TE>   And speaking of funny, why take two of today's most gifted comic
actors and give them a script so disposable that not even four
credited writers (two of whom have the adventurous trio of "Charlie's
Angels 2," "Bad Boys 2" and "I Dream of Jeannie" in their future) can
find it in themselves to breathe life into its exhausted corpse.</TE>
<TE>   These are, obviously, not difficult questions. The parties
involved understand there is money to be made by peddling a weak
product to a presold audience that is too beaten down by repeated
exposure to mediocrity to offer much resistance.</TE>
<TE>   The sad thing about this entire equation is that Murphy and Wilson
are undeniably funny actors, and when things click between them, as
they do at least once in "I Spy," actual laughter results. Most of
the time, however, the most impressive acting they do is pretend
there is a real movie here for them to star in. There is not.</TE>
<TE>   The original TV series featured Bill Cosby and Robert Culp as
globe-trotting secret agents who only pretended to be a professional
tennis player and his trainer. Both men were nominated for Emmys all
three years the show was on the air, with Cosby the perennial winner.</TE>
<TE>   The idea this time around starts with Wilson as bumbling secret
agent Alex Scott, fated always to be No. 2 behind the legendary
Carlos (Gary Cole) and forever longing to spend quality surveillance
time with the seductive Rachel Wright (Famke Janssen).</TE>
<TE>   Murphy, meanwhile, plays middleweight boxing champion Kelly
Robinson, the self-confident owner of the world's largest SUV, who
has the amusing habit of referring to himself in the third person, as
in "Kelly Robinson has spoken. It's a dead issue. Let it go."</TE>
<TE>   Espionage is not high on Robinson's to-do list, but then comes a
phone call from the president (a dead-on voice imitation of George
Bush) asking him to cooperate with Scott for the good of the country.</TE>
<TE>   It seems a stealth aircraft called the Switchblade has been
pilfered and is about to be sold by generic Euro-trash villain Arnold
Gundars (Malcolm McDowell), who just happens to be a big boxing fan
and thus sure to let Robinson into his inner sanctum in central
Budapest.</TE>
<TE>   While hilarity definitely does not ensue, Wilson and Murphy do
have nicely complementary comic styles, with the former's Jimmy
Stewart sheepishness melding well with the latter's high-energy
riffing. But the hackneyed idea of having these two initially get on
each other's nerves is a particularly dismal way to get things
started.</TE>
<TE>   "I Spy" is funnier when the two stars get along, especially in the
film's most amusing scene, when Robinson uses spy technology to coach
Scott through a chorus of Marvin Gaye's "Sexual Healing" as he tries
to seduce the lovely Ms. Wright.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, however, "I Spy," with more dead spots than a Jerry Lewis
telethon, is content to mark time.</TE>
<TE>   That gives us, and perhaps the cast as well, the opportunity to
reflect on how satisfying this film could have been if anyone had
thought it worth their while to provide real material for the talent
to work with.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'I Spy'</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13 for action violence, some sexual content and
language.</TE>

<KH>AROUND THE DIAL</KH>
<HD>From a new Culver City studio, NPR is boosting its West
Coast presence</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Carney</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>National Public Radio's Washington headquarters, though only a decade
old, are already a seven-story maze of offices and studios, with
narrow pathways blocked by stacks of books and files, reels of old
programs and archaic tape-editing machines. So the new
state-of-the-art West Coast production studios -- scheduled to open
Saturday -- exemplify the network's desire to break free of its D.C.
base and stretch out, both physically and philosophically.</LD>
<LD>   The new facility in Culver City, with its expansive ceilings,
funky suede furniture, exposed ducts and honey-colored beams, looks
every inch the cushy dot-com office it once was, and from there the
network plans to explore stories and trends outside the Northeast
corridor.</LD>
<LD>   "The purpose is to give us true national reach," Kevin Klose,
NPR's president and chief executive, said while visiting the new
offices. "What is happening in this state today is what will be
happening in America tomorrow" -- particularly in areas such as
health care, education, demographic changes and other social issues.</LD>
<TE>   In addition to expanding their news-gathering abilities, network
executives want to tap into different cultural outlets than their
usual Washington and New York sources, to hear youths, Latinos,
Asians and others underrepresented on the network.</TE>
<TE>   "By having a much larger presence here, it means the content is
going to be fresher. It gives us the ability to connect and present
ideas to the nation" via NPR's 700 stations, Klose said. The West
encompasses "very specific parts of America which we think are
fascinating, which have storied pasts. If we can be more in contact
with those, it will give us a diversity of voices that's only good
for us."</TE>
<TE>   The network's eight-person Los Angeles bureau is moving from its
office off Wilshire Boulevard to the new quarters, and expanding to
25 to 30 reporters, producers and other staff within a year, Klose
said. The year-old "Tavis Smiley Show" will be produced from the new
facility, NPR's largest outside Washington, and a midday arts and
culture program is being planned.</TE>
<TE>   "L.A is probably the most diverse city on the planet," said
Smiley, whose namesake interview and news program was the network's
first to originate from Southern California. "Now, with NPR West,
people are going to hear more of that Western essence on NPR. I'm
really looking forward to hearing, 'from NPR in Los Angeles' on other
shows."</TE>
<TE>   The network's upstart rival, Minnesota Public Radio, already has a
Southland presence, devoted to "the production and broadcast of
local, West Coast and Pacific Rim news and information programming."
MPR's parent took over management of Pasadena City College's KPCC-FM
(89.3) in 2000 and established the nonprofit distributor, Southern
California Public Radio. Along with the deal came a new $3.5-million
production facility in downtown L.A., home to KPCC's newsroom and the
business newsmagazine "Marketplace."</TE>
<TE>   But in spite of reports to the contrary, NPR West isn't simply the
latest troop advance in a turf war, according to Bill Davis,
president of Southern California Public Radio. Instead, it will boost
all of the area's public radio stations -- including his own KPCC,
KCRW-FM (89.9), KKJZ-FM (88.1) and KUSC-FM (91.5) -- by increasing
the number of programs originating from L.A. and creating a "critical
mass" of public-radio reporters and producers here.</TE>
<TE>   "What this is going to do for NPR as a national journalistic
entity is going to be significant. And it's going to make Los Angeles
a much more significant public-radio town than it's been heretofore,"
he said. "If they [NPR] look at it as kind of a colony, they'll miss
an opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really happy that this is happening," he added, noting that
KPCC airs more NPR programs than any other public station in the
Southland. "Any kind of competition we might have is pretty small
potatoes compared to the common interest we all have."</TE>
<TE>   The expansion was deemed so vital by NPR executives that they
pushed ahead with it in spite of economic troubles that forced them
to lay off dozens of workers over the past year, including the
familiar voice of reporter Daniel Zwerdling. The move, however, upset
some staffers, who have questioned management priorities.</TE>
<TE>   "In a down economy," Klose said, "you can't keep the staff as
fully as you would before. It's very painful. I'm not minimizing it.
The people who are engaged with content and substance at NPR, I think
they're very excited we're going to make this move. This ultimately
is going to strengthen NPR."</TE>
<TE>   At one time a woodworking factory, the outwardly modest,
25,100-square-foot building on Jefferson Boulevard belonged to the
family of TV bandleader Lawrence Welk. The polka king used it to
store sets and costumes. Most recently, an online video production
company rented the space before going under.</TE>
<TE>   "The beauty of the facility was the infrastructure," with a setup
that already included offices and studios left over from the previous
tenants, said Bud Aiello, NPR's director of engineering technology.
But the studios still needed millions' worth of computer and audio
equipment, vibration dampers and extensive soundproofing.</TE>
<TE>   Charitable foundations and other donors contributed half the $13
million needed to buy and upgrade the property. The facility will be
up and running for election night on Tuesday, with NPR hosts Neal
Conan and Scott Simon there, accompanying colleagues in the network's
Washington headquarters, reporting on races nationwide. Then the week
of Nov. 11, Conan will broadcast his regular call-in program, "Talk
of the Nation," from the Culver City studios. Airing weekdays on KPCC
from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., the show will examine why California issues
get national traction, focus on the foundering Pacific Northwest
economy and look at the proliferation of ethnic media.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an opportunity for us to educate ourselves, and hopefully
our listeners, about important things going on not just in
California, but in the Western time zone, if you will," Conan said.
"It can't do anything but expose us to more influences and more kinds
of people. You can only decide, in some respects, to put on what
you're familiar with. You can get insular when you're in Washington."</TE>
<TE>   Conan also cited a reason that has persuaded millions before him
to come to Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "It's 40 degrees and raining here," he said from his office in
Washington. "A couple weeks of 75 and sunny sound good."</TE>

<HD>Buying into a trend</HD>
<DH>In the latest form of 'retail theater,' appliance customers
who come to visit are making themselves right at home.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Grandma and Grandpa are chatting over coffee at the kitchen table,
Dad's comparing prices in newspaper ads, Mom's loading the washing
machine and the kids are watching cartoons. A typical Saturday at
home? No. These people aren't related. They don't even know one
another. And although they're all under one roof, they're not in a
house, but in a new kind of appliance store.</LD>
<LD>   At the Maytag Store in Costa Mesa, which opened its doors last
weekend, dishwashers are spraying dirty plates, refrigerators are
keeping cream chilled for the brewing coffee, and ovens built into
fine oak cabinets are turning out chocolate chip cookies, bread and
pizza. It's the latest in -- and most elaborate example of -- "retail
theater," a concept first staged by active wear and electronics
retailers that host in-store shows, kids' play areas and after-hours
parties. The idea is to keep the audience captive.</LD>
<LD>   Mike and Pat Holritz are here to find a stackable washer/dryer
"that's whisper-quiet and doesn't go 'bump, bump, bump,' " says Pat.
But they've spent their first half-hour sitting at a table for two in
the kitchen, eating pastries off blue china and talking about the
floral centerpiece.</LD>
<TE>   "The girl at the door ushered us right over here and we haven't
moved," says Pat, who has been married to Mike for 45 years. "I'm
admiring the decorations around us, which look like what I would do
at home and not staged like in House Beautiful magazine, and Mike,
who was an engineer, likes the geometric way those pasta noodles are
arranged."</TE>
<TE>   As for the appliances, well, there's plenty of time to check those
out, which the couple intends to do ... this time. "We do a great
deal of research before we go to the store, but some things you just
don't think about until you're actually using it," says Pat.</TE>
<TE>   The last appliance they bought was a microwave, and, like most
people, they stood back and watched the salesperson demonstrate how
it worked. "She pushed a button to open it, which it did beautifully,
and we brought it home," says Pat. "But when we used it for the first
time, we realized that since it didn't have a handle, we had to slam
the door to shut it. Mike goes to bed earlier than I do, and if I
want to heat a cup of tea, there's no way for me to close the door
quietly. I wish I had tried it first."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dirty dishes welcome</TE>
<TE>   Some appliance dealers have working kitchens and offer cooking
classes during special promotions, but Maytag has taken customer
interaction to the next level. Much like a Consumer Reports research
laboratory, the competitions' dishwashers are plugged in next to
Maytag's, and shoppers are encouraged to bring in dirty plates to
test the machines. In TV spots and fliers announcing the opening of
the Costa Mesa store, people were invited to "Bake cookies. Clean
your dishes. Take our washers for a spin .... Stop in and test-drive
your new appliance today!"</TE>
<TE>   And they're invited to linger. Spice racks, cookbooks and giveaway
recipe cards in the kitchen add a homey feeling. Video monitors
present a wouldn't-it-be-nice way of getting the laundry and cooking
done, and the bathroom, delicately lighted by an antique tea lamp,
has butterscotch-colored Venetian plastered walls created by a crew
working on the mansions along Newport coast.</TE>
<TE>   "All that's missing are the foot massagers," says Laura Garrett,
who owns the store -- the first in Southern California -- with her
husband, Tom Gill.</TE>
<TE>   There's a retail benefit to creating this comfort zone: At the 14
other Maytag Stores that have opened across the U.S. in the last two
years, shoppers are staying twice as long as in other appliance
departments.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Raising the comfort level</TE>
<TE>   Brian Hicks, who owns four traditional appliance shops and
launched the first Maytag Store in the state 10 months ago in
Rocklin, northeast of Sacramento, says customers act differently in
the new showroom.</TE>
<TE>   "You see in their eyes that they are at ease when they're here,"
he says. "Shoppers probably go to three or four stores before they
decide, and they're hearing different things at each place and they
wonder who to believe. But if they try things out, bring in a
sleeping bag, as some of our customers do, to see how it can get
clean, they see we've got nothing to hide and there's a big sigh of
relief."</TE>
<TE>   Across the 5,000-square-foot showroom floor is a cluster of
clothes washers, which the Holritzes will see eventually, after first
exploring the free-standing double ovens ("I'm not much of a cook,
but I wish I had a house that had this," says Pat as she pulls out
one of the racks) and the new "wide by side" refrigerators, which can
fit a 21-inch deli tray in the fridge and a 14-inch pizza box in the
freezer. "The first appliance we bought was in 1961, a Frigidaire
refrigerator for our first house," reminisces Mike. "It was still
working when we gave it away 25 years later."</TE>
<TE>   Most people keep washing machines longer than cars, refrigerators
outlast many marriages, and ovens stay put well after the kids have
moved on, says Jill Notini of the Assn. of Home Appliance
Manufacturers, based in Washington, D.C. "These are products that
last a long time, and if you think about how much time people spend
in homes and kitchens, they're central to a family, and people want
appliances that fit their life," she says.</TE>
<TE>   At one of the washing machines, a woman is stuffing a king-size
comforter into the front-loading tub. Store owner Gill is by her
side, saying that the machine is designed to handle queen-size
bedding, but "hey, if you can get it in there, we'll wash it for
you."</TE>
<TE>   Pat walks slowly by, shaking her head. "I heard you could bring
your things here to test the appliances, but I was raised in the days
where you didn't air your dirty laundry." Mike smiles at her joke.
They've been in the store an hour and are inching toward the
stackable washer/dryers.</TE>
<TE>   "Unlike the big-box stores such as Home Depot or Best Buy, where
things can get overwhelming, specialty retailers like the Maytag
Store want to create an ambience where people feel more comfortable
and are not intimidated by the wizardry," says Janice Costa, editor
of Kitchen and Bath Design News, a national magazine for interior
designers and architects. "They can make a convection oven, but no
one knows how to cook in it. So they say, 'Here, taste this,' and
nervous consumers can appreciate the benefits. The pleasant scents,
the activity, people hanging around, the dishes in the sink -- it's
like walking into someone's kitchen."</TE>
<TE>   Flying into the store, Bryan Bayer doesn't have time for coffee
and chitchat. A "full-time father" with a wife who works long hours
heading a construction company and two young daughters at home, he
makes a beeline for the Atlantis washer. "I've been checking
newspaper ads for prices on that model, and this is the best," he
says. Within minutes, he's made delivery arrangements and is out the
door.</TE>
<TE>   Almost two hours after they arrived, the Holritzes -- holding an
autographed photo of the Maytag Repairman ("We'll hang it in the
laundry room," says Pat) -- have found the washer/dryer they came
for. "The only thing we didn't get," says Pat, "was a hug."</TE>

<HD>Children crying in the night</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Al Martinez</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The boy can't sleep. He lies awake at night huddled against the
shadows that move across the ceiling of his quiet bedroom. When he
does finally drift off, the bad dreams come and he wakes up, crying.
Sometimes he lies there, coping with his fear. Other times he runs to
the room of his parents and snuggles with them until morning.</LD>
<LD>   It isn't the spooks of a child's imagination that terrify the
8-year-old. Not the friendly ghosts that walked the streets on
Halloween night, giggling under hooded sheets and behind ghoulish
masks. It's reality that troubles his sleep and haunts his daily
life.</LD>
<LD>   His father recalls that it began with the kidnappings that seemed
to dominate the news for so long. Little boys and little girls
snatched off the streets, some never to be seen again, others
murdered and tossed into the darkness. The boy wanted to know why
anyone would want to kill kids who hadn't done anything to hurt them.
He wanted to know if there were bad men in his neighborhood too.</LD>
<TE>   The terrorist attacks in New York, Pennsylvania and outside
Washington, D.C., had heightened the boy's fears, and the question he
asked, the "why" that continues to resonate across the land, could
never adequately be answered. The reasons are too unreasonable, the
explanations unexplainable.</TE>
<TE>   Images of buildings collapsing and people falling like dolls to
their deaths were bad enough. The kids didn't also need the specter
of a sniper stalking through their dreams. But once more, terror
dominated the news, this time by gunfire from the shadows. Worse, a
note left by the killer warned, "Your children are not safe anywhere
at any time." Again the boy asked why, and again his parents couldn't
answer.</TE>
<TE>   I know this kid. He's smart and sensitive. He listens and observes
and absorbs all the traumas that are a part of our world and, in the
definitive sense, part of his neighborhood. He asks "Are there more
of them?" when he hears of a sniper killing people for no reason
other than killing.</TE>
<TE>   I said to him one day that theirs was a kind of madness that
affects only a few among the many. Their presence, I said, was rare.
But then he hears about nations arming for war, about nations killing
each other in the Middle East, about nations stockpiling weapons that
are capable of greater horrors than we have ever known. And because
he's a smart and sensitive boy, he knows that the scary things
haven't gone away.</TE>
<TE>   His parents do the best they can to shield him, for a little while
at least, from the almost surreal terrors that abound. They don't
watch the news when he is up and about. They try not to discuss their
own fears when our government warns that more terrorist attacks may
be imminent and that war with Iraq may be near.</TE>
<TE>   But kids pick up bits here and there. You can't keep the whispers
low enough to shut them out. They listen. They talk among themselves.
And they cry in the night.</TE>
<TE>   "Our children don't deserve this," a Maryland policeman said,
talking about the sniper's note. No. They don't.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pandora's box</TE>
<TE>   This boy is every little boy and girl growing up in a climate of
dread. It's a sense that something's out there, something's coming.
And they know, as a child knows, that it will strike from the shadows
on their very own ceilings.</TE>
<TE>   One doesn't need a psychologist or a cultural anthropologist to
speculate on how deep the fear goes and how long it will remain with
our kids. Some may be able to shrug it off, but the sensitive ones
will carry it with them into adulthood. We learn sometimes too late
that kids don't always outgrow their fears the way they outgrow their
shoes.</TE>
<TE>   My generation began with the good guys versus the bad guys, the
clarity of positions leaving no doubt about the nobility of our
crusades. But then the lines began to blur, and we lost sight of who
the good guys were. And the bad guys aren't just "over there"
anymore, but among us and around us and down the alleys of our
nightmares.</TE>
<TE>   This month's National Geographic tells in precise terms what the
children sense. The world's a scary place. By highlighting the
weaponry that lies in what it calls "Pandora's box," the magazine
explains in graphic form where the nuclear weapons are or will be,
where the chemical weapons are or will be, and where the biological
weapons are or will be. They're everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   How perceptive of this boy and the kids of his generation to cry
in the night. How sad that fear blows through their dreams like a
dragon's breath, hot and foul-smelling.</TE>
<TE>   The little goblins that walk the streets of Halloween don't even
begin to hint at how afraid we all ought to be. But deep in their
troubled hearts, the children know.</TE>

<LD>Truth is stranger than fiction -- we know that already. When the
truth is frightening, it's also more insidious than its imaginary
counterpart because its ramifications and consequences must be
reckoned with. In Marco Brambilla's chilling video installation at
Christopher Grimes Gallery, we face both truth and fiction and are
left to speculate on the horrific prospect of their intersection.</LD>
<LD>   "Half-life" is a three-channel video piece shown on three walls of
the darkened gallery. On the back wall, we see a split-screen grid of
faces of young men (and one young woman). They stare listlessly
ahead, their eyes glassy, their faces devoid of emotion. On the two
side walls, we see what their attention is fixed on: fast-paced
scenes of violence from a popular Internet game.</LD>
<LD>   Radical contrasts between the two realms register instantly. The
game consists of short segments in which characters stalk and shoot
enemies in various environments: along train tracks, inside a jumbo
jet, around industrial loading docks. Men in combat fatigues, police
uniforms and generic, dark-hooded terrorist gear hunt down and blast
the life out of one another. Guns emit cartoon star blasts; bodies
spurt lava-like gobs of blood.</LD>
<TE>   Risk, danger and speed are the operative principles here. These
games put players on the brink and keep them there. In truth, the
players are sitting in suburban cyber cafes, at long banks of
computers, on which Brambilla has mounted cameras to record their
faces. He also provides, on another screen in the gallery's reception
area, an elevated, surveillance-type view of the anonymous, sedentary
playing environment. Its sterile uniformity couldn't clash more with
the extreme angles, saturated colors and rough, raw settings of the
game.</TE>
<TE>   Just how do these violent fantasies mesh with reality?
Sociologists differ in their opinions, and Brambilla himself, an
Italian-born filmmaker living in L.A., doesn't peddle a simple
conclusion. The immediate, visceral impact of his installation,
though, triggers a reflexive response against such destruction-based
entertainment. Snipers loose on the streets and airwaves filled with
reductive, with-us-or-against-us war rhetoric make this game imagery
feel uncannily, disarmingly familiar, as if truth and fiction have
merged beyond distinction.</TE>
<TE>   In another single-channel video, Brambilla has staged a
reenactment of a stabbing that occurred outside an Orange County
cyber cafe a few years ago. In an effort to sensitize us to the
desensitizing effects of repetition, he plays this condensed drama of
death over and over again in a continuous loop. The image, a copy of
a crime that was, presumably, a copy of a game, is mesmerizing and
traumatizing, powerful and, ideally, empowering.</TE>

<TE>   Cups runneth over with wit, beauty</TE>
<TE>   "Variety Show," the title of Ron Nagle's exhibition at Frank Lloyd
Gallery, suggests that amusement's in store, and Nagle delivers
generously. He's a consummate craftsman with a worldly sense of
history and humor. His aren't pretentious in-jokes that reassure
cognoscenti of their privileged status in the art world, but
accessible witticisms, oddities and quirks that draw on popular
culture and artistic precedent. They elicit smiles and chuckles, but
also respect.</TE>
<TE>   Nagle has been making cups and other small clay objects for 40
years. The work has had attitude from the start, and these recent
sculptures are as irreverent as they are weirdly beautiful. Of the
three groups of work here, the Thin Fins provoke the most delicious
shock. A cross between comic ballet and lunar landscape, the format
evolved from the basic cup but is now flagrantly functionless. Each
of the sculptures sets an extruded shape, which curls or angles back
in on itself, in front of a rectangular or curved panel. Strange,
enchanting little objects, they have a curdled texture and come in an
extraterrestrial spectrum of airbrush-perfect candy colors.</TE>
<TE>   The Snuff Bottles resemble stylized female silhouettes from an
earlier era. Statuesque little forms, they have heart-shaped,
curvaceous upper bodies, pinched waists and long skirts with sinuous,
drippy hemlines. These porcelain and overglaze pieces bear colors
that hark back to traditional domestic comforts, like creamy tomato
soup ("Miss Bisque") and hot chocolate ("Swiss Mystic").</TE>
<TE>   Nagle's Smoove Wares take off from sturdy cups, slick cars, the
reductive elegance of Brancusi and who knows what else. Their chief
thrill comes through pungent combinations of color: neon orange with
grape; sea green and wine; gunmetal gray and hot tangerine.</TE>
<TE>   Nagle is also a master of the mixed metaphor. His work pulls
seductively, persuasively, simultaneously in multiple directions. How
else could he manage, in the Thin Fins work, to make something that
looks as if it came from the litter box also muster grace? And in the
Snuff Bottles, to so seamlessly merge a phallic neck with feminine
shoulders? Nagle's work is subversive in the most glorious, expansive
sense of the word.</TE>

<TE>   Primal emotions evoked in black</TE>
<TE>   Black is predominant in Enrique Martinez Celaya's deeply affecting
new paintings at Griffin Contemporary. It's neither the black of
night nor of despair, but a darkness both vacant and deep. It
suggests a primary condition, a state of unknowing.</TE>
<TE>   Into this rich absence, Martinez Celaya introduces, one by one,
figures and trees, children and light, as if building a world from
scratch. In "Gabriela I," a baby hovers over an adult with upraised
arms. Is he letting go of her for a playful, buoyant toss, or is he
opening his arms to receive her, a gift delivered into his humble
care?</TE>
<TE>   "Rosemilk" pairs a faintly delineated human torso in cruciform
pose, with arms outstretched, and a more fleshed-out rendering of a
tree branch. The two forms overlap, resonating with each other like
poetic kin.</TE>
<TE>   In "Gabriela's Laughter," an outlined figure half-stands,
half-sits beneath a cascade of light. Laughter and light become a
single affirming force -- radiant, brilliant, necessary for life and
growth.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez Celaya paints the black grounds of these large canvases
with emulsified tar, then uses oil and varnishes to build up surfaces
as primal as the emotions evoked through the images on them.
Furrowed, scraped, dripping, they are dynamic areas of the
compositions, not static backdrops. They embody a sense of perpetual
change, which, along with the notion of the self as continually
becoming, permeates Martinez Celaya's work, here and in previous
shows.</TE>
<TE>   The figures in his work have no specific identities -- their eyes
are almost always closed, their postures slightly hunched, their
gender usually vaguely male. They have no detailed features, and
their one consistent quality is that of inwardness. They seem to be
quietly focused on fundamentals: love, loss, mercy, transcendence.
The gentle stillness in these works, the grace of their questioning,
draws our focus to the very same places.</TE>

<TE>   A rainbow of Los Angeles images</TE>
<TE>   The sublime beauty of a rainbow may not be the first thing that
comes to mind when you think of Los Angeles, but Patrick Wilson has
brought the divine symbol and the urban landscape together with some
panache. The highlight of his show at Susanne Vielmetter is a grid of
25 paintings, collectively named after the city.</TE>
<TE>   Each square-foot canvas gleams a different color, and together --
reading from top left to bottom right, or simply from top row to
bottom -- they describe the color spectrum. Wilson paints in alkyd,
acrylic and oil, adding layer upon translucent layer to produce an
utterly smooth, luminous surface. Light appears to reside within each
square.</TE>
<TE>   Small images of buildings (some of them recognizable), utility
poles and dumpsters rest mutely beneath the veils of color. They
ground the canvases in the particularities of L.A., while Wilson's
color and technique evoke a more abstract, placeless realm.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson follows a similar approach in a dozen panoramic canvases (1
foot high and 6 feet wide) that hang on the wall atop another, like
modular, Minimalist sculptures. Here, too, he paints landscape
fragments -- as well as an extensive skyline -- as small notations
within luminous, abstract fields.</TE>
<TE>   In this sequence, however, he trades luxurious color for a subtle
range of off-whites, whose crimson and sapphire foundations peek
through around the edges. Each panel is named after a month of the
year, and as we follow the calendar down the wall, the eggshell and
ivory adopt, in the late summer months, a warm, smoggy cast.</TE>
<TE>   In both groups of paintings, Wilson sporadically adds little
opaque squares or lines along the canvases' bottom edges. They yank
the mind out of its light-and-space reverie into a more cerebral mode
of geometric purity and order. All of the work in this engaging show,
including a group of graphite and spray-paint drawings, benefits from
that kind of oscillation between dispassionate description and
passionate abstraction.</TE>

<LD>Before launching "Star Wars Trilogy in 30 Minutes," an announcer
concludes the usual admonishments about cell phones and photographs
with a caution to "keep your hands and feet inside the vehicle at all
times."</LD>
<LD>   She isn't joking. This U.S. premiere of adapter-director Patrick
T. Gorman's bargain-basement truncation of George Lucas' tripartite
sci-fi epic negotiates the Coronet Theatre's upstairs space at warp
speed, packing the wallop of a whiffle-bat light saber. A smash at
the 1999 Edinburgh Festival, "Star Wars" recalls every junior high
assembly ever encountered. Office chairs with Christmas-lighted legs
serve as battling spacecraft, robot R2D2 is a plastic trash can, ad
infinitum.</LD>
<LD>   The ensemble is a high-octane machine, walking the tightrope
between representation and sendup in a manner recalling the glory
days of Second City, if not the earlier, funny episodes of "Saturday
Night Live."</LD>
<TE>   As Luke Skywalker, James Snyder decimates Mark Hamill's chipper
attack. Mark Kelly's Han Solo and Maia Peters' Princess Leia carry
deadpan echoes of Mike Myers and Janeane Garofalo.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Walker Mullin switches from Darth Vader to Chewbacca on the
dime left over from the show's budget. Steve Josephson is hilarious
as both fey C-3PO and incomprehensible Yoda. Jason Major's Emperor
and Michael Cornacchia's Jabba the Hutt defy description, and their
coevals are all rib-tickling.</TE>
<TE>   There is no substance here beyond the one-joke premise. But that
joke stretches to galactic levels, recommending "Star Wars" to fans
and detractors alike. May the Farce be with you.</TE>
<TE>   -- David C. Nichols</TE>

<TE>   A bleak look at a literary figure's life</TE>
<TE>   At the beginning of "Dear Charlotte," about the early life of
Charlotte Bronte, the stage fills with people absorbed in books that
are lighted from within. It's an artful depiction of writing's
ability to illuminate all who come into contact with it.</TE>
<TE>   Joy Gregory's play demonstrates how Bronte had to find her light
before she could share it with others. Having pushed beyond personal
hardship, poor self-image and Victorian-era sexism, she is poised, in
this show at the Powerhouse Theatre, to revolutionize English
romantic literature and become a role model.</TE>
<TE>   Gregory is a founding member of Chicago's Lookingglass Theatre
Company, which nurtured artful productions of "The Arabian Nights"
and "Metamorphoses." Like those works, "Dear Charlotte," directed by
Tracy Hudak, uses vivid visuals to help tell its story.</TE>
<TE>   Yet for all of its artistry and despite its inspirational message,
"Dear Charlotte" is bleak and depressing.</TE>
<TE>   On a stage shrouded in black except for the colorful book spines
lining two towering shelves, Bronte (a prim but resolute Kim Weild)
endures the deaths of her mother and three of her five siblings. She
is taught that women are to silently bear their burdens while
carrying out duties to others. And she is led to believe that the
best she can expect, because of her limited means, is to become a
governess (shades of "Jane Eyre").</TE>
<TE>   More happily, she and her siblings (Amber Skalski, Tina Van
Berckelaer and Brian Stanton) begin to write stories, symbolized by a
joyous cascade of pages from the rafters above the stage. Later, an
instructor in Brussels (Robert Patrick Brink) recognizes and
encourages Charlotte and sister Emily's literary gifts, which sets
them feverishly scrawling words across every surface they can find.</TE>
<TE>   All the while, Charlotte is forever composing letters -- records
of her thoughts, really -- in her mind, hence the play's title.</TE>

<TE>   'Frost and Fire' on a misguided path</TE>
<TE>   If your entire life lasted only eight days, it's unlikely you'd
spend any portion of it at "Frost and Fire," the dance-theater piece
based on a Ray Bradbury short story at the Ivar Theatre. As adapted
and directed by Zina Bethune, featuring Bethune Theatredanse and
California Youth Theatre, the premise of an eight-day lifespan
consumed with avoiding sun and snow may be intriguing on the page,
but this misguided telling arrives stillborn.</TE>
<TE>   Amid a stage cluttered with Shanan W. Brown and Andrea Finn's
glittering Styrofoam boulders and desiccated fishing nets, Michael
Masucci's ambient videos, and dry ice, the dozen-plus dancers barely
have room to pirouette.</TE>
<TE>   It's the year 5002, but everyone is inexplicably garbed in
uncomely, Flintstonian-era costumes, while Zeljko Marasovich's
tedious score hammers like a migraine. Murray Phillips and Bethune's
by-the-numbers choreography has the dancers spending as much time
reciting Bradbury's words and screaming at one another (a good versus
evil thing) as they do leaping and rolling around the floor. The
nearly 20 scenes have the large cast, including many children,
foraging in caves, searching for math formulas and burying the dead.</TE>
<TE>   The saving grace? A studly Trevor Brackney, who partners Raquel
Baldwin with ease. As he stalks the stage with feral intensity, his
every move is powered with a sure-footedness this production sorely
lacks. Even as children's theater, it's less than Mickey Mouse.</TE>

<TE>   Choosing theater as a religion</TE>
<TE>   Two indelible moments typify the considerable humor and impact of
"The Big Voice: God or Merman?," Steve Schalchlin and Jim Brochu's
autobiographical musical at the Zephyr Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   The first occurs mid-Act 1, which charts a passage through the
channels of religion and musical theater from the opening number,
"Why?," onward.</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas Baptist Schalchlin grows up pulled between the ministry
and songwriting; Brooklyn Catholic Brochu between the priesthood and
theater queendom. This leads to the first touchstone, when Brochu's
family friend Mr. Zimmerman takes him to see "Gypsy," starring
daughter Ethel. The subsequent reverent epiphany -- "It was like
church, but with energy!" -- is priceless.</TE>
<TE>   The other signpost arrives early in Act 2. Having ended Act 1
waxing romantic in the lovely ballad "Near You," Schalchlin casually
changes direction.</TE>
<TE>   His fathomless eyes belying his smiling voice, Schalchlin
announces, "I had it," conveying an entire universe in a single
syllable.</TE>
<TE>   Under Anthony Barnao's elegant direction, the attunement of these
life partners is effortless, with Brochu an acerbic hambone and
Schalchlin an affecting morph of Keith Carradine and Mr. Rogers.</TE>
<TE>   Their Harold Rome-meets-Windham Hill score has redundancies,
indicating a need for pruning. Some overkill blurs the mesh of quips
and honesty, and referring to their hit "The Last Session" without
providing an excerpt for unexposed audiences seems counterproductive.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the lingering afterglow suggests that the biggest
voice in question belongs to neither God nor Merman, but to both
performers and their witty, inspiring confessional.</TE>
<TE>   -- D.C.N.</TE>
<TE>   "The Big Voice: God or Merman?," Zephyr Theatre, 7456 Melrose
Ave., L.A. Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends Nov. 17. $20.

<TE>   'Cinema' picks up where action ends</TE>
<TE>   An art form advances only through experimentation, which is why
it's good to have a company like City Garage on the scene. An
insatiable curiosity drives this Santa Monica company, resulting in
productions that sometimes set imaginations afire ("MedeaText"),
others times baffle ("The Girl in the Flammable Skirt") and almost
always challenge and provoke.</TE>
<TE>   Its newest presentation, "Cinema Stories: Ceremonies of
Unendurable Bondage," falls, alas, into the baffling category. Like
other of the company's recent projects, however, it seeks new ways of
fusing live action and projected images, a fascinating field of
inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   The show is built from seven short stories by Charles A. Duncombe
Jr., with the texts divided up to be spoken (there is little actual
dialogue) by actors executing stylized movements in front of video
projections. Duncombe, City Garage's managing director, states in a
program note that the stories share common themes of love and loss.
But this viewer didn't pick up on those topics so much as a pervasive
sense of the "unendurable bondage" mentioned in the subtitle, whether
to a person, a place or a social code.</TE>
<TE>   Among the surreal visions staged by artistic director Frederique
Michel: A business-suited man (Laurence Coven) falls in love with a
naked goddess (Kathryn Sheer) while, in the background, waves surge
onto a palm-framed shore. A woman (Cynthia Mance) loses her voice to
a fluttering in her throat, then coughs up a blue butterfly that
transforms, on the screen, into a creature that is part butterfly,
part man. A Magritte-like bowler-hatted gentleman (Mathew Gifford) is
alarmed to find the world transformed into the stifling cityscape
envisioned in Fritz Lang's "Metropolis." A leather-clad party girl
(Maia Brewton) hits the open road as God's traveling companion, with
the black ribbon of highway unspooling behind her. A weeping woman
(Mance) is rebuked by a gallery of brutal men, including a masked one
who participates silently from the screen.</TE>

<TE>   An undermined, updated Medea</TE>
<TE>   Whatever impassioned arguments against gay persecution might fuel
Cherrie Moraga's "The Hungry Woman: A Mexican Medea" at the
Celebration Theatre, this new play does its cause little good by
misappropriating the classic Greek myth.</TE>
<TE>   A curious narrative mutation plunks Medea (Lina Gallegos) into a
near-futuristic Tex-Mex internment camp for homosexuals and other
outcasts from the post-revolutionary nation of Aztlan (the history is
summarized over a bingo game to get us economically up to speed). In
and around the fun at the local lesbian bar, an eerie shamanistic
chorus, eclectically clad in ritualistic war paint and
sadomasochistic accessories, writhes and intones portentous (OK,
pretentious) warnings. We're not in Corinth anymore, Toto.</TE>
<TE>   Re-settings can be opportunities for creative invention, but
always at the risk that the updates will suffer in comparison with
the source. That is sadly the case here. In the original story, Medea
was a woman as much sinned against as sinning -- the innocent,
castoff victim of a callous, unfaithful husband who traded up for a
landed princess.</TE>
<TE>   Here, the cause of Medea's banishment is her lesbian affair with
Luna (Adelina Anthony, who also directs); Luna, in turn, feels
threatened by the men in Medea's life. Instead of Medea's being the
victim of a triangle, she's at the center of one, which undermines
her moral high ground.</TE>
<TE>   This Medea's outraged husband, Jason (dour Melody Butiu), isn't
willing to accommodate her infidelity (the insensitive brute). He is,
however, willing to take her back on a monogamous footing; perhaps
it's a strategy of manipulation, and his disdain for homosexuality is
bigoted, but the reconciliation offer seems genuine. In that light,
his intention to take a new Apache bride becomes less a betrayal than
a way of moving on from a failed relationship.</TE>
<TE>   Jason isn't even allowed back onstage for the denouement, Medea's
somewhat unconventional approach to childrearing. In place of the
original's slaughtered babes, Medea's 13-year-old son, Chacmool
(Ramon Granados Jr.), is no innocent; he's a borderline gangbanger
desperately in need of a father. In fact, it's the boy's stated
desire to live with Jason that drives the clingy Medea to slip him
some poison.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony's staging includes some striking video-enhanced visual
flourishes, and a steamy love scene with Luna establishes Gallegos'
Medea as a very hungry woman indeed. But this indulgent, muddled and
overlong howl of a play stretches the moral fabric of Euripides'
tragedy past the breaking point.</TE>

<HD>'The Year There Was No Halloween'</HD>
<DH>The story so far: Jake is trying to figure out what
happened to Halloween.</DH>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I ran back to my house! What had happened to my favorite holiday,
Halloween? I stopped in our frontyard, calling loudly for my mom.
Casey was barking!</LD>
<LD>   "Jake, Jake, what's wrong?!" I heard my mom's voice way off in the
distance.</LD>
<LD>   Then I opened my eyes. It took a minute before I realized where I
was.</LD>
<TE>   "Mom, there is a Halloween, isn't there?" I shouted.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, of course there is," she said happily, "and it is tonight.
You must have had a bad dream. Casey has been barking for you to wake
up."</TE>
<TE>   So then, I really did go down to breakfast. I told my mom and dad
everything about my dream.</TE>
<TE>   "You wouldn't believe me that there was a Halloween and such a
thing as trick-or-treating, and neither would Timmy," I said. "I kept
looking and looking for some proof and there wasn't any. It was
awful!"</TE>
<TE>   On the way to school, I told Timmy about my dream and how I was
afraid I'd never get to celebrate Halloween again: "No Snickers, no
Hershey bars, no candy corn, no jelly beans, no suckers, no
anything!" I said.</TE>
<TE>   "Wow!" Timmy said, "I'm sure glad it was only a dream! Now all we
have to do is go home after school, have dinner and wait for it to
get dark so we can get on our costumes and go trick-or-treating."</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," I said, "and I can see your costume -- I hope it's as
scary as you say! Then, when we are done, we can go back to my house
and dump all our candy out on the floor and see how much good stuff
we got!"</TE>
<TE>   "By the way. What are you going to be?" asked Timmy.</TE>
<TE>   "A vampire," I said. "A very happy vampire!"</TE>

<HD>'Wildfire 7' burns through its action-packed plot too
quickly</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carolyn Patricia Scott</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the opposite end of the spectrum from the real-time suspense of
Fox's high-concept thriller "24" is tonight's TV movie "Wildfire 7:
The Inferno" (8 p.m, Pax). It plays out in cinematic shorthand,
jumping from scene to scene with such haste that the viewer is left
like its firefighting heroine -- in a smoky haze.</LD>
<LD>   Tracey Gold ("Growing Pains") plays Nell Swanson, a convicted
murderer who trains in prison as a California Department of
Corrections firefighter and is paroled into a forestry firefighting
unit.</LD>
<LD>   Then, in the blink of an eye and 100 or so off-camera fires later,
she's tapped to head a team of veteran smoke jumpers.</LD>
<TE>   The team includes a resentful ex-New York City firefighter, an
experienced Native American firefighter and none other than the same
abusive officer (Alexander Walters) who trained Swanson when she was
initially furloughed to the prison unit.</TE>
<TE>   A battle of egos between the pair ensues; meantime, the rest of
the crew isn't too thrilled with Swanson either.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to assert control over the group, the rookie
commander harangues her employees, shouts orders and yanks the group
back to square one: boot camp training, including everything from
calisthenics to a 20-mile double-time march in full gear.</TE>
<TE>   When the team is called on to fight its first big forest fire,
there is dissension and confusion. But Swanson marshals on, arguing
and spouting rules, regulations and the "ways of the forest" along
the way.</TE>
<TE>   If "Wildfire" has a redeeming quality, it is its not-so-subtle
promise of a happy ending. But even that loses its edge when the
conclusion is telegraphed in the rush through plot points and
underscored in every one of Swanson's dour speeches.</TE>

<HD>Slack embrace in 'Hollywood Arms'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Linda Winer</AU>
<BD>Newsday</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>If talent credits were drama, "Hollywood Arms" would run forever.
Just look at the program for Carol Burnett's memory play, which
opened at the Cort Theatre last night after a reportedly promising
start at Chicago's Goodman Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   First there is the pedigreed authenticity of the project, based on
the early chunk of the multitalented Burnett's 1986 memories and
coauthored by her daughter Carrie Hamilton, who at age 38 died of
cancer, just four months before the Chicago premiere. The play is
directed and co-produced by no less an alchemist than Harold Prince.
What's more, Broadway favorite Linda Lavin plays the crotchety,
possessive, quirky old grandmother, called Nanny, and is never far
from high-density, center-stage, off-center theatrics.</LD>
<LD>   Alas, all the king's horses -- or at least all the Prince
resources -- are unable to find the elastic to pull together this
slack, elongated and overpopulated evening of show-biz family
reminiscence. We never doubt that Burnett's early years in a cheap
Hollywood rooming house were filled with eccentric, troubled, selfish
and caring people with enough personal demons to shape a lifetime of
stories. But there is a difference between telling a good story and
writing a good play. And for all the dauntingly meticulous detail in
this mostly autobiographical work, it remains a labor of love with
too much of the labor showing.</LD>
<TE>   Burnett's harrowing recollections are strangely flat -- jarred by
the occasional now-I'm-going-to-tell-you-a-joke device, a farcical
cops-and-bookie scene that might have been dragged in from an
old-fashioned Broadway comedy or mama-daughter jealousies that play
more than a little like a low-rent "Gypsy."</TE>
<TE>   The program identifies the time span from 1941 to 1951, but the
second act introduces a snotty seventh-grade daughter -- the entirely
winning Emily Graham-Handley -- who was a mere unexpected baby before
intermission. The neighbor's precocious little boy (Nicolas King)
does a lot of major showing off in the first half but isn't even
mentioned in the second act, and his mother -- the snappy Leslie
Hendrix -- is expected to wear the same Mexican peasant blouse
through the years.</TE>
<TE>   If we seem to be digressing from the main conflict, you've got the
picture. Lots of trees, fuzzy forest. Things begin in standard
memory-play mode. Older Helen (Burnett chose not to call her Carol)
introduces us to the Hollywood sign that hovers over Walt Spangler's
dreamlike, functional rooming house set. But her next sentence pulls
us to her earlier memory, before Young Helen (Sara Niemietz) and
Nanny left Texas to join Helen's mother, Louise, as she pursues her
"pipe dream" of writing celebrity interviews.</TE>
<TE>   Lavin walks with the widespread stance that actresses assume when
pretending to be old. Lavin's Nanny is busy enough, thank you, what
with her making snorty faces, cracking flatulence jokes in her buzzy,
twangy voice, having psychogenic "spells" and popping phenobarbital,
the era's female drug of choice.</TE>
<TE>   Michele Pawk makes us care a lot about Louise, a vibrant woman
with ambitions that exceeded her life's options, and Frank Wood is
poignant as ever as her first husband, Helen's sweet loser of a
father, who abandoned them for the bottle and the TB sanitarium.</TE>
<TE>   The star turn comes, finally, when Donna Lynne Champlin, as the
sturdy, sensible Older Helen, shows the family how she stepped out of
her usherette job and entertained the movie audience when the
projector broke by playing all the roles in the film. It is a
stirring moment, but it comes late in the evening. Before Helen gets
to New York and success, her mother warns, "The world isn't kind to
people like us. They hate originals."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, but that is not the problem here.</TE>

<HD>Earnings Rise for Aetna on Higher Fees, Cost Cuts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Aetna Inc. reported a third-quarter profit Thursday as the
second-largest U.S. health insurer raised premiums and held down
medical costs.</LD>
<LD>   Net income was $98.8 million, or 64 cents a share, compared with a
loss of $54.4 million, or 38 cents, a year earlier, the company said.
Revenue fell 22% to $4.83 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Aetna cut medical costs by dropping millions of members it
considered too costly to insure and raised premiums 20% for others.</LD>
<TE>   Chief Executive John Rowe, who announced 6,000 job cuts in
December and wants to slash 2,700 more during the next year, wants to
shave $300 million from operating costs this year to return the
company to profitability after two years of losses.</TE>
<TE>   Rowe said during a conference call that the company expects to cut
more than $100 million in operating costs next year.</TE>
<TE>   Third-quarter profit would have been 73 cents a share without a
gain from the settlement of a customer contract and from medical
claims being lower than Aetna anticipated in prior quarters,
spokesman Fred Laberge said. On that basis, analysts surveyed by
Thomson First Call expected a profit of 70 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of the Hartford, Conn.-based company Thursday fell 66 cents
to $40.30 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The company had almost 14 million members when the quarter ended,
down almost 500,000 from the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Aetna expects to lose more members in the first quarter of 2003
because of premium increases, then begin to add customers as it
competes with rivals such as UnitedHealth Group Inc. and Cigna Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Aetna raised its 2002 profit forecast Thursday to $2.57 to $2.62 a
share, from the $2.20 to $2.25 range it predicted Oct. 9. The company
lost $1.95 a share last year.</TE>

<HD>Injunction Issued Against Madster</HD>
<DH>Movie and record firms get a look at problems they'll face
closing file-sharing networks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge has ordered the Madster file-sharing network to stop
its users from making unauthorized copies of music and movies, but
the network's creator said he can't stop infringements or control
what users do.</LD>
<LD>   The major record companies and movie studios hailed the
preliminary injunction issued Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Marvin
E. Aspen in Chicago against John A. Deep and two Madster-related
companies that he operates.</LD>
<LD>   The injunction requires Madster -- originally known as Aimster --
to cut off users' access to copyrighted songs and films, even if it
means shutting down the network.</LD>
<TE>   But Deep said Tuesday that he couldn't do that because the network
operates by itself, relying only on its users' computers and the
public Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "The Madster software is out there and I can't take it back," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   To try to comply with the injunction, Deep said he would release a
new program, dubbed "FairPlay," that users of Madster and other
file-sharing networks could install to identify copyrighted files and
restrict their use.</TE>
<TE>   Madster will rely on copyright owners and users to take the steps
necessary to protect files, at least initially, Deep said.</TE>
<TE>   His actions give the movie and music industries a preview of the
problems they may encounter as they try to shut down other
file-sharing services that sprang up in the wake of Napster Inc., the
pioneering song-swapping network in Redwood City, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   File-sharing systems enable users to find and copy data from each
other's computers through the Internet. Unlike Napster, which is
insolvent and reorganizing, most file-sharing companies claim that
their networks are self-sustaining and cannot be controlled.</TE>
<TE>   Deep, who also has filed for bankruptcy protection, said the
FairPlay software lets users indicate whether a song or movie is
copyrighted and, if so, whether it's freely available for copying,
unavailable or available for pay from another site. Once a file has
been restricted, users who download it will be able to play only a
10-second sample unless they obtain an electronic key to decrypt it,
Deep said.</TE>
<TE>   Exactly how the system will work isn't clear even to Deep. For
example, nothing prevents people who aren't copyright owners from
declaring that a file is copyrighted and then setting the rules for
its use. Nor is there any way to stop users from sharing the keys to
copyrighted files.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe people are honest and they do the right thing when they
have the choice," Deep said.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Oppenheim, senior vice president of business and legal
affairs with the Recording Industry Assn. of America, said if Deep
didn't act to stop the infringements, "he'll be in contempt of
court."</TE>
<TE>   He added that evidence collected by the RIAA indicates that Deep
can control the Madster network and, if necessary, shut it down.</TE>
<TE>   The injunction was written by lawyers for the record and movie
industries, and Aspen adopted it in its entirety after Madster failed
to propose an alternative. In addition to requiring Madster to halt
any of the plaintiffs' files from being infringed, it also requires
Deep and his two companies to patrol the network for violations and
submit a complete list every month of all the songs made available or
searched for on the network.</TE>
<TE>   Deep said he had no idea how he would be able to supply such a
list. "I don't have any way to do that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The RIAA plans to do its own monitoring, Oppenheim said, to see if
any infringing works remain available on Madster.</TE>

<HD>Warning by Albertsons Triggers Sector Sell-Off</HD>
<DH>Growth of Wal-Mart is causing concern among traditional
supermarket chains, whose shares are losing ground.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of Albertsons Inc. tumbled to a two-year low Thursday as the
grocery chain's reduced profit outlook unnerved investors and fueled
concern that the growing dominance of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. would
cause traditional grocers even more woes.</LD>
<LD>   The gloomy outlook wiped out more than $2 billion in Albertsons
market capitalization and sent shares of rivals Kroger Co. to close
off almost 4% and Safeway Inc. to fall 7%. The earnings warning
prompted one Wall Street analyst to tell investors to sell
Albertson's stock.</LD>
<LD>   Albertsons, which ranks second behind Kroger in an increasingly
competitive supermarket grocery sector, said it expects its
third-quarter profit to be 5% to 10% below current estimates because
of a steeper-than-expected drop in sales. It also cut its
expectations for the full year.</LD>
<TE>   Boise, Idaho-based Albertsons fell $5.11 to $22.31 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Besides an uncertain economy, which is spawning job cuts and has
stunted consumer sentiment, the traditional grocery chains also are
reeling from Wal-Mart's push to use lower-priced food to attract
customers.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, is now the dominant player
in the $680-billion U.S. grocery industry, and analysts fear that
business for conventional grocers like Albertsons only will worsen.</TE>
<TE>   The discounter said this month that it would open as many as 210
of its food-selling "supercenters" next year, heaping even more woe
on grocers.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch analyst Mark Husson recommended a "sell" on
Albertsons shares Thursday, while Andrew Wolf, an analyst at BB&amp;T
Capital Markets, cut his rating on Cincinnati-based Kroger to "hold"
from "buy."</TE>
<TE>   Husson said slumping sales may have caught Albertsons by surprise
as the retailer had thought its business would continue to reap
benefits from a recent restructuring, which included closing more
than 100 stores and trimming payroll.</TE>
<TE>   "In our view, Albertsons can no longer afford to sit back and must
initiate heavy gross margin investments beginning in the fourth
quarter," Husson said.</TE>
<TE>   Wolf said the U.S. supermarket industry has become "the most
war-like we have seen in the past 10 years," and there was no
"defensive case for recommending investing in [any] of the big three
supermarket chains at this time."</TE>
<TE>   Albertsons forecast third-quarter earnings in the range of 47
cents to 49 cents a share, compared with its previous guidance of 52
cents.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts polled by Thomson First Call had expected Albertsons to
report a third-quarter profit 50 cents to 55 cents a share, with a
mean at 52 cents. A year ago, the company reported a third-quarter
profit of 44 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Chairman and Chief Executive Larry Johnston said Albertsons did
not expect "this tough environment to improve in the near term. As we
move forward we are going to be very strategic on how we invest in a
combination of promotions and price [cuts]."</TE>
<TE>   He said he also would speed up the launch of customer loyalty
cards which reward shoppers with discounts while giving the company
insights into shoppers' buying habits. The other focus would be on
cost cutting, Albertsons said.</TE>
<TE>   Full-year profit was forecast by First Call analysts to range from
$2.08 to $2.34, with a mean at $2.28. In the prior year Albertsons
reported a profit of $1.95.</TE>

<HD>Flap May Delay AT&amp;T Cable Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edmund Sanders</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Government approval for the pending merger of AT&amp;T
Corp.'s cable business and Comcast Corp. has been caught up in a flap
over whether the Federal Communications Commission should review a
contract between AT&amp;T and AOL Time Warner Inc. that spells out the
terms under which AOL can offer high-speed Internet service on AT&amp;T
Comcast wires.</LD>
<LD>   Brian Roberts, chief executive of Comcast, visited the FCC this
week and told FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell and other commissioners
that the confidential contract is irrelevant to the proposed merger.</LD>
<LD>   But consumer groups and Atlanta-based EarthLink Inc., a rival
Internet service provider, are eager to see the terms of the
contract, which reportedly heavily favor AT&amp;T Comcast.</LD>
<TE>   The groups say the contract could offer proof of AT&amp;T Comcast's
potential market power. If AT&amp;T Comcast is able to extract such
attractive terms from a media company as large as AOL Time Warner, it
would be able to exert undue influence on countless smaller players,
according to Media Access Project, one of the watchdog groups asking
the FCC to review the contract.</TE>
<TE>   If the FCC refuses, merger opponents are hinting that they may ask
an appellate court in Washington to compel the agency to look at the
terms. An FCC spokeswoman said the agency has not decided whether to
review the contract.</TE>
<TE>   FCC commissioners are still expected to approve the AT&amp;T-Comcast
cable deal shortly, sources said. The Justice Department also is
expected to approve the deal.</TE>
<TE>   But the latest maneuvering may delay action beyond the FCC's
self-imposed deadline of Nov. 5.</TE>

<HD>Paint Maker to Settle Lawsuit Over Sealants</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Santa Ana paint company agreed to pay $107.5 million to settle a
class-action suit over faulty wood sealants that left mildew damage
on fences, decks and houses.</LD>
<LD>   Behr Process Corp., a unit of Masco Corp., made no admission of
liability or wrongdoing in the proposed settlement. "Unfortunately,
litigation is just part of doing business these days," said Samuel
Cypert, vice president of Masco, which is based in Taylor, Mich.</LD>
<LD>   Consumers who purchased Super Liquid Rawhide or Natural Seal Plus
wood sealants after Jan. 1, 1991, may be qualified to share in the
settlement if they suffered mildew damage. Those who applied the
sealants but did not have damage may be eligible for discounts on
other Behr products.</LD>
<TE>   Consumers have until Feb. 7 to accept, object or opt out of the
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   A March 6 hearing in San Joaquin County Superior Court is
scheduled to determine lawyers' fees and give final approval to the
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Behr has stopped making the two sealants targeted in the suit.</TE>

<HD>Temping, but Not by Choice</HD>
<DH>Number of state's 'involuntary' part-time workers is
growing</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Marla Dickerson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's unemployment rate has dropped in recent months, but
that's little comfort to Melina Donalson.</LD>
<LD>   The Mount Washington fashion designer has been looking for steady
work since February. Unable to land a full-time position, she has
taken a string of temporary assignments to make ends meet -- one of a
growing number of Californians in the same predicament.</LD>
<LD>   The number of state residents classified as "involuntary"
part-timers, meaning they are working fewer than 35 hours a week
because they can't find full-time employment, has jumped 30% to
648,000 workers since the beginning of last year. That's nearly 4% of
those employed.</LD>
<TE>   Nationally, the increase is slightly steeper, up one-third over
the same period to 4.2 million workers.</TE>
<TE>   It's a sign of the times in a sluggish economy as companies keep a
tight rein on labor costs, analysts say. It's also one of several
indicators showing that California's employment climate is drearier
than a falling jobless rate would suggest. Although the state's
unemployment rate dropped to 6.3% in September, down from its
post-recession peak of 6.5% this summer, economists say that's due
mainly to seasonal factors and a rise in discouraged job seekers.
They are no longer counted in the jobless tally because they've
stopped looking for work.</TE>
<TE>   Among the other signals pointing to the underlying weakness in the
job market:</TE>
<TE>   * California has lost more than 50,000 payroll jobs over the last
year, and job creation is at a virtual standstill.</TE>
<TE>   * The state's unemployed are remaining jobless longer.</TE>
<TE>   * The manufacturing sector has shed jobs in 19 of the last 20
months, while factory hands are working fewer hours than they did a
year ago.</TE>
<TE>   * Unemployment among California's teenagers has soared to 18.2%,
and joblessness among nonwhites recently hit a six-year high of 8.5%.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say California's economy, like that of the nation,
appears to be inching forward in a slow-motion recovery. The nation's
gross domestic product expanded at a 3.1% annual rate in the third
quarter, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. But that growth
has yet to trickle down to job seekers such as Donalson.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm surprised at how hard it has been" to find a full-time job,
said the 33-year-old, who has sent out dozens of resumes with no
success. "Employers are being really careful now."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the reason California's labor market appears so daunting
to job hunters today is that it stands in such stark contrast to the
economic boom. As recently as 2000, California employers created a
record number of jobs, boosting their payrolls by nearly half a
million workers.</TE>
<TE>   The tech crash, a manufacturing recession and fallout from the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks brought the party to an abrupt halt.
California employers, which added an average of 40,500 jobs a month
in 2000, slashed an average of 2,200 jobs a month in 2001 -- and
they're still chopping.</TE>
<TE>   The state has 53,600 fewer nonfarm payroll jobs than it did a year
ago, and job growth is at a standstill, according to the state
Employment Development Department. The jobless rate has risen from a
pre-recession low of 4.7% in early 2001.</TE>
<TE>   That's downright tame compared with the early 1990s, when the
collapse of aerospace and housing sucked nearly half a million jobs
from the California economy and sent the state's unemployment rate
soaring to 9.7%. And unlike that period, California has performed
slightly better than the U.S. over the last year, shedding 0.4% of
its payroll jobs, compared with 0.7% nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   But the problem for labor markets in California and the nation
this time around, experts say, is that there is little driving the
economy forward. Unlike previous downturns that were caused when
consumers sat on their wallets, last year's recession was the result
of businesses that stopped purchasing computers and other equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Capital spending has shown few signs of recovering soon, thus the
continued slump in California's high-tech and factory sectors. The
Bay Area has lost 78,100, or 2.2%, of its payroll jobs over the last
year, wiping out modest gains posted in the San Joaquin Valley and
Southern California. The state's manufacturing employment base, the
largest in the nation, has shrunk by nearly 8% since September 2000.
Factory hours and overtime are down significantly over the same
period.</TE>
<TE>   California's government sector has added large numbers of jobs in
recent years, mainly in education, but analysts say budget woes will
hamstring that growth.</TE>
<TE>   That leaves industries such as housing and retail to pick up the
slack. But because those sectors held up fairly well during the
downturn thanks to strong consumer spending, analysts say there's no
big rebound in the offing to significantly boost employment from
here. In fact, concern now among economists is that consumers may run
out of gas. A survey released this week by the Conference Board
showed consumer confidence plunged to its lowest level in nine years
on war jitters and worries about a stagnant job market.</TE>
<TE>   "People have to have a paycheck coming in to feel all right," said
Los Angeles economist Donald H. Straszheim. "You can't run a strong,
vibrant economy without job growth. The problem is that so far this
year we haven't seen any."</TE>
<TE>   For employers, it's a buyers' market. Mara Klug, regional vice
president of Adecco, one of the nation's largest temporary staffing
firms, said her company's L.A.-area offices have been swamped with
applications.</TE>
<TE>   "Employers are being really picky because they can be," she said.
"We're seeing talented people who have been unemployed for a while."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, jobless Californians are searching longer for work than
they have in years. Those needing 27 weeks or longer to find
employment has hit a four-year high of 17.9% in September, compared
with 11.7% a year ago, according to the Employment Development
Department.</TE>
<TE>   Others who have managed to find work, such as Donalson, are
settling for part-time jobs. She left a full-time job with a
children's clothing maker two years ago, hoping to make herself more
marketable through training in computer-aided design. But she has yet
to reap the rewards.</TE>
<TE>   Donalson signed on with 24 Seven Inc., an employment agency that
specializes in placing fashion industry workers. That has resulted in
a string of part-time, temporary jobs with no benefits and wages well
below the $35,000 a year she was making at her old job.</TE>
<TE>   Tammy Chatkin, senior vice president of 24 Seven, said apparel
companies, like other employers in a sluggish economy, are looking to
keep a lid on labor costs. Temporary help gives them the flexibility
to ramp their payrolls up and down with the order flow.</TE>
<TE>   "Employers are smart," she said. "They are being cautious."</TE>
<TE>   The good news for workers, Chatkin said, is that temporary jobs
often function as on-the-job tryouts that can lead to full-time
positions. Economists have been keeping a close eye on the personnel
supply sector, considered a bellwether of hiring. That sector is down
12,500 jobs compared with a year ago in California. But it is slowly
creeping back, having added 5,400 jobs since the first of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles resident Lia Monroy recently interviewed for a
full-time customer service position at an educational services
company where she has been temping since last April.</TE>
<TE>   "They are looking at their budget to see if they can add some new
positions next year," Monroy said. "I'm hoping to fill one of them."</TE>

<HD>Capstone Turbine Loss Narrows by 14%</HD>
<DH>The generator firm posts revenue of $3.9million, but is
unable to provide a quarterly outlook.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Hirsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cost cutting helped Capstone Turbine Corp. narrow its losses by
nearly 14% in the third quarter but the company said Thursday that
market conditions are so bleak that it has suspended offering
forecasts for the fourth quarter and beyond.</LD>
<LD>   Chatsworth-based Capstone, which makes small turbine-driven power
generators, said it has been hurt by a dramatic downturn in business
investment and capital spending as well as a decline in energy
prices, which has diminished the attractiveness of its
refrigerator-sized machines.</LD>
<LD>   "The uncertain market conditions, the lengthy sales cycle for our
microturbines, and our limited visibility to orders prevent us from
being able to accurately project near-term sales levels," said Ake
Almgren, Capstone's president and chief executive, who announced his
retirement this week. The company has begun a search for a new CEO.
Board member Eliot Protsch has assumed chairman duties.</LD>
<TE>   Additionally, companies are nervous about adopting a new
technology such as Capstone's microturbines, creating sales
difficulties, Almgren said during a conference call Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Capstone posted a net loss of $10.8 million, or 14 cents per
share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30. That compared with a net
loss of $12.5 million, or 16 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue
rose 18% to $3.9 million from $3.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Capstone made its announcement at the end of a trading day that
saw its shares fall 7% to close at 95 cents on Nasdaq. Capstone
traded at nearly $100 a share two years ago, when investors believed
that high electricity prices and the California energy crisis would
fuel demand for its generators.</TE>
<TE>   The company burned through $10.8 million in cash in the third
quarter, but that was down significantly from the $18.7 million used
in the same period a year earlier. Capstone has $144 million in cash
and no long-term debt, except for leases.</TE>
<TE>   Capstone also disclosed more details about an agreement announced
this week with industrial giant United Technologies Corp. United
Technologies purchased 4.9% of Capstone's stock, or 3.9 million
shares, for $1 a share, Almgren said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The two companies have signed a 10-year agreement to incorporate
Capstone's generators into the line of power products the Hartford,
Conn.-based United Technologies markets to operators of commercial
buildings. The contract should "provide a significant backbone to our
sales and distribution channels," Almgren said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say Capstone will probably gain customer credibility
through its partnership with United Technologies, a well-regarded
industrial concern.</TE>

<HD>Chevron Reports a Net Loss</HD>
<DH>Write-down involving stake in Dynegy, other charges put oil
firm in the red by $904 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Rivera Brooks</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ChevronTexaco Corp. on Thursday wrote off most of its investment in
troubled Dynegy Inc., resulting in a $904-million net loss for the
third quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Like other oil companies, San Francisco-based ChevronTexaco was
hit by lower earnings in fuel refining and retailing because the slow
economy damped sales and pricing during the quarter.</LD>
<LD>   The loss, which amounts to 85 cents a share, contrasts with net
income of $1.27 billion, or $1.19, in the third quarter last year.
Revenue rose to $25.5 billion from $25.4 billion.</LD>
<TE>   Wall Street found the results disappointing, pushing down
ChevronTexaco's stock price $3.77, or 5%, to $67.63 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The company said operating earnings for the July-September quarter
fell to $1.2 billion, or $1.17 a share, from $1.7 billion, or $1.61,
in the period last year.</TE>
<TE>   Operating earnings do not include the write-down of
ChevronTexaco's 26.5% stake in Dynegy Inc. and other charges, which
totaled $2.1 billion in the latest quarter. Analysts surveyed by
Thomson First Call had expected average per-share earnings of $1.30.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch/Shell Group reported
lower earnings Thursday. Industry leader Exxon Mobil of Irving,
Texas, said net income fell 17% to $2.6 billion, or 39 cents a share;
Royal Dutch/Shell Group, based in London and Amsterdam, also reported
a 17% drop in net income to $2.2 billion after accounting for special
items.</TE>
<TE>   But ChevronTexaco has its particular headaches, analysts said,
pointing to the company's investment in Houston-based Dynegy and
continuing problems combining the operations of Chevron and Texaco
since they merged in 2001. Dynegy reported a $1.8-billion
third-quarter loss Wednesday, primarily due to charges from the
deteriorating energy-trading business, which Dynegy is exiting.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the net loss, ChevronTexaco Chief Executive David J.
O'Reilly said "our employees have made tremendous strides in
integrating the separate companies in this first year after the
merger."</TE>
<TE>   ChevronTexaco drills for oil and natural gas around the world,
refines oil into fuel and sells gasoline at 21,000 service stations
worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts say ChevronTexaco is stronger than third-quarter
results appear to indicate, adding that many of the problems were
one-time events that should not affect future profitability.</TE>
<TE>   ChevronTexaco's stake in Dynegy was once worth $2.7 billion, but
ChevronTexaco wrote down the value to $2 billion in the second
quarter and further slashed the value on its books in the third
quarter to $412 million.</TE>
<TE>   ChevronTexaco's third-quarter charges included its share of
Dynegy's third-quarter loss and a portion of the $566-million loss on
the sale of Dynegy's Northern Natural Gas pipeline. The company also
reported $485 million in asset impairments, reflecting a lower value
of certain assets than previously reported on the oil company's
books.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some warts," said Tyler Dann, an oil analyst with Banc
of America Securities. "I get the sense that there are a number of
issues related to cleanup of Texaco."</TE>
<TE>   ChevronTexaco said oil and natural gas production fell during the
quarter because of production quotas by the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries and disruptions in the Gulf of Mexico
and elsewhere, leaving earnings in that segment unchanged at $1.3
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Earnings in the refining, marketing and transportation segment
fell to $92 million from $589 million. Chemicals operations posted a
$138-million loss, compared with a $158-million loss in the period
last year.</TE>

<LD>Don't waste time watching CNN's news crawl trying to spot a merger
between the network and ABC News.</LD>
<LD>   At least for now.</LD>
<LD>   A flurry of rumors Thursday had the two organizations on the verge
of a deal, apparently based on a CNN camera crew filming outside
ABC's New York headquarters, or an ABC news crew at CNN's building,
or both.</LD>
<TE>   One rumor even had Ted Turner unveiling it tonight to CNN news
anchor Aaron Brown on the network Turner first put on the air 22
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   But Brown's producers said no guests were planned yet for
"NewsNight With Aaron Brown," and Turner, AOL Time Warner Inc.'s vice
chairman, was not scheduled to appear.</TE>
<TE>   Talks between ABC parent Walt Disney Co. and CNN parent AOL Time
Warner have been ongoing, with the potential cost savings of $200
million a year appealing to both sides.</TE>
<TE>   But CNN and ABC News officials denied Thursday that a deal is
near.</TE>
<TE>   One internal e-mail from a high-ranking Turner Broadcasting System
official suggested any deal was weeks, if not months, away.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Disney Chairman Michael Eisner, appearing on CNN's "Lou
Dobbs Moneyline," endorsed a merger. But Eisner added that
negotiations were complicated, with such details as operating control
and financial splits yet to be worked out.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it makes great sense," Eisner said. "That doesn't mean
it's necessarily, absolutely going to happen."</TE>

<HD>Edison to Oppose Corona's Takeover</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Karen Robinson-Jacobs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Southern California Edison Co. vowed Thursday to go to court to block
plans by Corona to seize the utility's power lines and transmission
facilities and said the city can expect to rack up tens of millions
of dollars in legal bills if it pursues the takeover.</LD>
<LD>   Corona officials formally announced plans Thursday to consider
taking over the poles, wires and two substations Edison now uses to
deliver energy to its 37,000 customers in the Riverside County city
of 130,000. Initial studies value the property at $70 million to $130
million, Corona Mayor Darrell Talbert said.</LD>
<LD>   Talbert said the announcement was the first step in a process to
create a municipal utility. He said the city would release a detailed
feasibility study Tuesday and could present an offer to Edison as
early as December.</LD>
<TE>   Promising savings and a more stable energy environment, Talbert
said initial studies show that "the day we take over ... we can
deliver power to our residents and businesses at least a 15% savings
over the current Edison rates." The savings, he said, would come
largely from the city's lower overhead and tax-exempt status.</TE>
<TE>   But Charley Wilson, a spokesman for SoCal Edison, questioned
whether the city could provide power more cheaply, noting that Edison
-- the state's second-largest utility -- has more pricing power in
purchasing electricity.</TE>
<TE>   "Historically, over the past 50 years, these have not been good
ideas, once all the analysis is out on the table," Wilson said. "Most
of the time these things don't pencil out."</TE>
<TE>   Wilson also said the company would force the matter into court
rather than sell.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not looking to entertain offers for sale," he said. "So
they should build into their economic model the time and expense of
going through an eminent-domain proceeding," which he said would cost
"in the tens of millions of dollars."</TE>
<TE>   Craig Moyer, an attorney with Manatt, Phelps &amp; Phillips, which is
advising the city, said Corona has the right to seize Edison's
facilities under the city's power of eminent domain if it can
convince a judge that the takeover is in the public interest.</TE>
<TE>   City officials say a municipal utility can better serve the needs
of businesses such as Golden Cheese Co., which has been in a
protracted fight with Edison to get more energy for its 34-acre
factory.</TE>
<TE>   "This plant has been operating for two years, during peak periods,
using diesel generators," said Shawn Kaddoura, vice president of the
company, one of the largest employers in Corona. "They will be able
to get us the deficiency of power that we need."</TE>

<HD>Del Monte Posts Profit on Convenience Foods</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Del Monte Foods Co., the largest U.S. produce canner and distributor,
Thursday reported a quarterly profit on lower costs and stronger
demand for convenience foods such as single-serve fruit cups, up from
a year-ago loss.</LD>
<LD>   Earnings in its first quarter ended Sept. 30 were $400,000, or 1
cent a share, compared with a loss of $5.3 million, or 10 cents, a
year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   The company's revenue rose 5% to $284.7 million, primarily because
of higher shipments, strength in its vegetable business and increased
retail fruit sales. San Francisco-based Del Monte said convenience
products and premium lines such as fruit in glass containers were
helping to drive growth.</LD>
<TE>   The company agreed in June to buy several North American brands
from ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co., including Star-Kist tuna and
Kibbles 'n Bits pet food. On Thursday, it reaffirmed expectations for
the deal to close later this year or in early 2003.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to higher sales, Del Monte's earnings were boosted by
lower unit costs, a reduction in interest expense and lower losses
related to the fair market value of interest rate swaps, the company
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The numbers came in pretty much as we were looking for," said
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. analyst Leonard Teitelbaum. Merrill's outlook for
the stock is on hold until the Heinz deal closes.</TE>
<TE>   Under the terms of the transaction, Del Monte is buying the Heinz
assets by issuing 157 million new Del Monte shares to Heinz
shareholders, who will get 0.45% of a Del Monte share for every Heinz
share they own. Heinz shareholders will control 74.5% of the new Del
Monte company, with current Del Monte holders owning the remainder.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Del Monte fell 23 cents, or 2.8%, to $8.02 in New York
Stock Exchange trading. The stock has fallen 30% since the Heinz deal
was announced June 13.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Sues to Block DirecTV Merger</HD>
<DH>Justice Dept. and states worry about high prices. EchoStar,
Hughes might fight over breakup fee.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edmund Sanders</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- EchoStar Communication Corp.'s yearlong bid to take
over satellite rival DirecTV appeared all but over Thursday as state
and federal antitrust officials -- unimpressed by some last-minute
concessions -- sued to block the merger.</LD>
<LD>   The decision is likely to set off a series of intense legal
maneuvers by the two satellite-TV rivals over $600 million in breakup
fees tied to the failed merger.</LD>
<LD>   The Justice Department and attorneys general for California and 22
other states determined that a combination of the nation's two
satellite-TV providers would lead to higher prices, poorer service
and reduced incentive for innovation. Three weeks ago, the Federal
Communications Commission rejected the deal on similar grounds.</LD>
<TE>   Though EchoStar and DirecTV's parent, Hughes Electronics Corp.,
have the legal right to press their case in court, the unusual
one-two punch by the government makes it highly unlikely that the
companies can salvage the $18-billion deal, analysts say. In most
cases, merger partners give up after the Justice Department files
suit.</TE>
<TE>   "We continue to believe passionately that the merger of EchoStar
and Hughes is the best chance to stop rising cable prices and to
bring enhanced services to all Americans, especially those consumers
living in rural America," EchoStar Chief Executive Charlie Ergen said
in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   "We are obviously disappointed that at this time we have not been
able to convince regulatory officials to share our vision."</TE>
<TE>   A statement from Hughes said the company would consult with
EchoStar before determining its next move. Privately, DirecTV sources
say they have no desire to fight the government in court but are
obligated to go along with EchoStar until their merger agreement
formally expires Jan. 21.</TE>
<TE>   DirecTV Chief Executive Eddy Hartenstein said last month that he
did not expect the agreement to be extended.</TE>
<TE>   At Hughes' headquarters in El Segundo, many of the 1,200
employees, who feared a merger would result in large-scale layoffs,
breathed a sigh of relief, sources said. Hughes is a unit of General
Motors Corp.</TE>
<TE>   With the collapse of the deal, analysts predict, EchoStar and
DirecTV will return to being aggressive rivals, and they may well sue
each other over the $600-million breakup fee that EchoStar has
pledged to pay Hughes if the merger is not completed by the Jan. 21
deadline.</TE>
<TE>   The contract also calls for EchoStar to purchase Hughes' stake in
satellite operator PanAmSat Corp. for $2.7 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The hefty breakup fee was insisted on by GM because it was
concerned that the deal might run into antitrust problems.</TE>
<TE>   The demise of the merger also opens the door again for Rupert
Murdoch's News Corp. to renew its bid for DirecTV. Murdoch tried to
buy DirecTV last year but was foiled by EchoStar.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, the merger of the nation's only two large-scale
satellite-TV companies was always viewed as a longshot. The combined
entity would have had 18 million customers.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say Ergen underestimated the antitrust issues and
overestimated his own ability to charm regulators into giving him
what he wanted.</TE>
<TE>   Many in the industry also have speculated that EchoStar never
seriously believed it could pull off a merger, but pressed ahead to
keep DirecTV in limbo for nearly a year and out of the hands of
Murdoch.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers Union, which surprised many by lobbying in support of
the merger, expressed disappointment that regulators did not try
harder to modify the deal. The watchdog group, which typically
opposes big media combinations, hoped that a combined
EchoStar-DirecTV would create stronger competition for local cable
operators, potentially lowering cable rates.</TE>
<TE>   "As much as there were problems with the merger, the bigger
problem is the fact that cable rates keep going up," said Gene
Kimmelman, co-director of Consumers Union in Washington. "If the Bush
administration refuses to do surgery on the merger, then what is the
administration going to do to restrict the cable industry's
monopolistic practices?"</TE>
<TE>   But Jay Nixon, the Missouri attorney general who led the states'
opposition, said the proposed merger would have created an illegal
pay-television monopoly in many rural areas that cannot receive cable
services.</TE>
<TE>   State and federal regulators said they were unimpressed by
EchoStar's last-ditch offer to transfer a chunk of its satellite
frequencies to New York-based Cablevision Systems Corp., which is
preparing to start its own satellite television service.</TE>
<TE>   Nixon dismissed the idea as "inventing your own competition just
as you cross the finish line in the race."</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar's shares rose 57 cents on Thursday to close at $20.39 on
Nasdaq, and Hughes' shares climbed 8 cents to $9.85 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Jump in GDP Comes With Warning</HD>
<DH>Other reports on jobless claims, employment costs and
manufacturing output point to a weakening economy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Glenn Somerville</AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- U.S. economic growth spurted ahead in the third
quarter, powered by brisk consumer spending, the government said
Thursday. But analysts warned that slowing sales of cars and other
goods have already sapped much of the momentum.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, three other reports Thursday pointed to a weakening
economy, boosting the odds of another interest-rate cut when Federal
Reserve policymakers meet Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   In the government's first estimate of third-quarter growth, the
Commerce Department said gross domestic product, which measures the
total value of goods and services produced within U.S. borders,
advanced at a 3.1% annual rate in the three months from July to
September. That was a rebound from the anemic 1.3% pace of the second
quarter.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts said the report, while showing the economy still was
growing, highlighted the uneven pace of recovery from last year's
recession and left a clear path for further Fed rate cuts -- even
with the central bank's benchmark short-term rate already at a
40-year low of 1.75%.</TE>
<TE>   The government's report acknowledged that much of the
third-quarter advance came from brisk spending on new cars and
trucks, as automakers offered a variety of incentives, including free
financing, to lure buyers to showrooms.</TE>
<TE>   The report showed consumer spending overall grew at a 4.2% annual
rate in the quarter, up from a 1.8% rate in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   But car sales slowed in October and may be harder to revive in
coming months, some experts warned.</TE>
<TE>   "The economy is losing steam," economist Sung Won Sohn of Wells
Fargo Bank in Minneapolis said. "The zero-percent financing is like
antibiotics; the market needs a stronger and bigger fix to maintain
the current level of sales."</TE>
<TE>   Commerce Secretary Don Evans said that a number of influences were
depressing consumers' spirits, from anger over corporate accounting
scandals to worry about the effect of possible war with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Separately Thursday, a Labor Department report showed initial
claims for unemployment benefits jumped by 16,000 to 410,000 in the
week ended Oct. 26, indicating a weakening job market.</TE>
<TE>   In a third report, the Labor Department said its employment cost
index -- measuring what employers pay in wages, salaries and benefits
-- rose at a 0.8% rate during the third quarter, slowing from 1% in
the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a report on Chicago-area manufacturing showed that
activity contracted for a second consecutive month in October, and at
a faster pace than expected.</TE>
<TE>   There were some signs in the GDP report that suggested businesses
might be starting to modestly raise investment spending -- something
economists say is vital to keep some economic momentum going.</TE>
<TE>   Nonresidential private investment -- spending on factories and
equipment -- edged ahead for the first time in two years. Within that
category, spending on equipment and software increased for a second
straight quarter during July-September, rising at its fastest pace
since 2000's second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   But a survey issued Thursday by the National Assn. for Business
Economics said the 108 businesses it polled did not expect to boost
hiring in coming months, and many were cutting their spending plans.</TE>
<TE>   NABE's president, Tim O'Neill, said it was not an entirely bleak
view of the future but it indicated caution: "There is a somewhat
more pessimistic view about where the economy is going in the
near-term, but there's no sense of panic."</TE>

<HD>Ex-Enron CFO Fastow Indicted on 78 Counts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Enron Corp. Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow was
indicted Thursday on 78 federal counts alleging he masterminded
schemes to artificially inflate the energy company's profit and skim
millions of dollars at shareholders' expense.</LD>
<LD>   The indictment, returned by a grand jury in Houston, is
essentially a formal restatement of a criminal complaint filed Oct.
2.</LD>
<LD>   But the indictment is notable for the sheer number of charges,
which include multiple counts of fraud, money laundering and
conspiracy. One count of obstruction of justice was not included in
the original complaint. If convicted, Fastow faces hundreds of years
in jail and millions of dollars in fines.</LD>
<TE>   Fastow, 40, is free on $5-million bond and faces a Nov. 6
arraignment on the charges. He is the most prominent Enron executive
to be charged in the federal probe.</TE>
<TE>   "These charges are full of sound and fury, but the truth about
Enron has yet to be told," Fastow's attorney, John W. Keker, said.
"When that truth is told, to a jury of 12 honest Americans, Andy
Fastow will be set free."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Atty. Gen. Larry Thompson, head of the Bush
administration's corporate fraud task force, said federal officials
"will use every appropriate measure to recover the ill-gotten gains
of these corporate schemers."</TE>
<TE>   The indictment alleged Fastow and others created schemes to
defraud Enron and its shareholders through transactions with
off-the-books partnerships that made the company look more profitable
than it was.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors also allege Fastow gained an estimated $30 million
from kickbacks funneled through Michael J. Kopper, his former aide,
and investors or family members. Investigators say Fastow also
siphoned off income from the partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors are expected to pressure Fastow to learn what he might
say about the actions of his colleagues, including former Enron
Chairman Kenneth L. Lay and former Chief Executive Jeffrey K.
Skilling.</TE>

<HD>Gemstar Will Restate Results</HD>
<DH>It replaces auditor KPMG after dispute over accounting of
licensing fees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Leeds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gemstar-TV Guide International Inc. on Wednesday disclosed that it
had fired auditing firm KPMG and now expects to restate more than two
years' worth of financial results.</LD>
<LD>   Pasadena-based Gemstar, run largely by its biggest shareholder,
News Corp., said it fired the accounting firm after a dispute about
Gemstar's plan to re-classify a transaction it had initially deemed
"non-monetary."</LD>
<LD>   Gemstar, the leading provider of electronic TV-program guides,
said it hired auditing firm Ernst &amp; Young to "expedite" a review of
its financial results. Gemstar said its restatement will change how
the company accounts for $113 million in licensing fees that the firm
now is unlikely to collect after losing a patent dispute involving
Scientific-Atlanta Inc.</LD>
<TE>   Gemstar had a licensing deal with Scientific-Atlanta that expired
in 1999. After it ended, Gemstar accused the manufacturer of TV
set-top boxes of violating its patents. Gemstar expected to continue
collecting licensing fees and accounted for the money as revenue on
its books. But Gemstar then lost the patent dispute.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it decided to revisit its handling of that
revenue after consulting with Ernst &amp; Young. Gemstar said it
anticipates the restatement would affect financial results from July
1999 through March 2002.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Gemstar said it would "re-classify" $2.7 million in
advertising revenue that had arisen from transactions between sectors
of the company.</TE>
<TE>   Gemstar said it decided to replace KPMG after a consultation with
the Securities and Exchange Commission to resolve the accounting
disagreement. KPMG said it was "not surprised" by the move but
planned to detail its disagreement in an SEC filing.</TE>
<TE>   Gemstar was a Wall Street highflier just two years ago, but its
value has plummeted, suffering from questionable accounting practices
and court rulings that undermined its patents.</TE>
<TE>   Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. has been forced to take write-downs of
about $6 billion since March to deal with Gemstar's decline. News
Corp. recently seized control of the firm, forcing out Gemstar
founder Henry Yuen.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Gemstar remained unchanged Wednesday, at $3.61 on
Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Guess Tells of Cost-Cutting Moves as Sales Slow</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Abigail Goldman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Guess Inc. said Thursday that a tough retail environment is prompting
the company to cut jobs and close some underperforming stores this
year in hopes of stemming a projected full-year loss.</LD>
<LD>   The news came as the Los Angeles-based maker of jeans and other
casual clothes posted a quarterly profit in line with the company's
revised expectations.</LD>
<LD>   Guess had said earlier this month that slower-than-anticipated
September sales would mean lower quarterly earnings.</LD>
<TE>   For the quarter ended Sept. 28, Guess reported net income of $3.4
million, or 8 cents a share, up from $1.3 million, or 3 cents a
share, for the same period last year.</TE>
<TE>   Those numbers include a one-time gain this year of $2.6 million
after taxes from a legal settlement and last year's charge of $2.6
million after taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Sales during the quarter dipped 8.5% to $157.8 million, down from
$172.4 million during the same period last year.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no question that the economic environment, particularly
in retail, continues to be uncertain and consumer confidence has been
shaken by a series of developments, including job losses, budget
deficits and stock market volatility," Guess President Carlos
Alberini told investors in a mid-morning conference call.</TE>
<TE>   Guess shares rose 30 cents to $4.58 Thursday on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   October sales in stores open at least a year probably will be down
slightly, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Same-store sales, which exclude new and closed stores, will be
released by most major retail chain stores next week.</TE>
<TE>   For the year, Guess executives projected a loss of 2 cents to 5
cents a share excluding charges, with revenue down by a high
single-digit percentage.</TE>
<TE>   For the fourth quarter, which includes the holiday shopping
period, the company projected earnings of 10 cents to 13 cents a
share.</TE>
<TE>   Guess would not say how many stores it plans to close, but during
the conference call Alberini said it would be "less than a handful."</TE>
<TE>   The company, which operates 242 stores in North America, also will
close some corporate facilities and will cut an undisclosed number of
jobs, mostly from the corporate and administrative ranks, the company
said.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Guess said it remains on track to open 12 to 15 stores
next year.</TE>
<TE>   This year's cost-cutting measures will mean a fourth-quarter
charge of $6 million to $8 million after taxes, or 15 cents to 18
cents a share, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Starting next year, Guess expects those efforts to generate about
$7 million in savings.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Senior law enforcement officials assured technology executives
Thursday that government will increasingly work to keep secret the
names of companies that become victims to major hacking crimes, along
with any sensitive corporate disclosures that could prove
embarrassing.</LD>
<LD>   The effort, described at a cybercrime conference in northern
Virginia, is designed to encourage businesses to report such attacks
and build public confidence in Internet security. Officials promised
to use legal mechanisms, such as protective orders and sealed court
filings, to shield corporate hacking victims from bad publicity.</LD>
<LD>   "It's important for us to realize that you have certain concerns
as victim companies that we have to acknowledge," FBI Director Robert
S. Mueller III said. He promised, for example, that FBI agents called
to investigate hacking crimes will arrive at offices discretely
without wearing official jackets with FBI emblazoned on them.</LD>
<TE>   "The mere calling of us in an investigation can have an adverse
impact on the image of your company," said Mueller, who has made
cybercrime an FBI priority.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange for this protection, Mueller said, companies should
more frequently admit to the FBI when they are victims of hacking.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not enabling us to do the job," Mueller said.</TE>
<TE>   Government efforts to tighten Internet security and investigate
online attacks have long been hampered by reluctance from companies
to admit they were victims, even in cases where executives quietly
paid thousands of dollars in extortion to hackers. Companies say they
fear loss of trust by customers and shareholders, costs associated
with a formal investigation and increased scrutiny by regulators.</TE>
<TE>   New efforts to protect the identities of hacking victims also
contrast markedly with traditional hacker culture, which frequently
blames companies and organizations that are targets of online attacks
for failing to secure their networks adequately.</TE>
<TE>   "There may very well be ways that law enforcement can get a
criminal sanction imposed but not have all the names of the companies
made public," said Marty Stansell-Gamm, chief of the Justice
Department's computer crime section.</TE>
<TE>   But she cautioned: "That's not something that law enforcement can
guarantee."</TE>

<HD>Vivendi in Deal to Sell Houghton</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Corie Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vivendi Universal announced Thursday that it has agreed to sell its
U.S. publishing division, Houghton Mifflin Co., to a group of equity
investors led by Blackstone Group for $1.7 billion in cash and
assumed debt.</LD>
<LD>   The deal is part of an effort to slash the Paris-based company's
$19 billion in debt so it can focus on developing its core Los
Angeles-headquartered entertainment assets: Universal Studios,
Universal Theme Parks and Universal Music Group.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, Blackstone is talking with Vivendi about increasing
the New York buyout firm's stake in Universal's theme parks. The
company currently owns 50% of Universal's two Orlando, Fla., theme
parks. Universal also operates parks in the Universal City, Spain and
Japan.</LD>
<TE>   Vivendi's financial problems are the result of former Chief
Executive Jean-Marie Messier's three-year spending spree to transform
the venerable French water and sewer company into an international
media powerhouse. French prosecutors have opened an investigation
into shareholder allegations of financial wrongdoing by Messier, who
has denied any improprieties.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi bought Boston-based Houghton last year for $2.2 billion.
Although the sale price values the publishing company well below what
Vivendi paid for it, Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. analyst Michael
Nathanson said, "Anytime Vivendi can sell an asset, it is a good deal
for them."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Blackstone confirmed that the company is in an
investment consortium with Thomas H. Lee Partners, Apax Partners and
Bain Capital to buy Houghton.</TE>
<TE>   Dismissing speculation that Blackstone intends to sell Houghton's
educational publishing unit separately from the division that
publishes J.R.R. Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings" and the "Curious
George" series of children's books, the spokesman said, "When we make
investments, it is for the long term."</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi fell 27 cents to $12.12 on the New York Stock Exchange. It
has lost about 80% of its market value this year.</TE>

<HD>ICANN Ends Board Elections</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The group that oversees Internet addresses finalized changes Thursday
that end direct elections to its board of directors -- a move critics
say could make the group indifferent to ordinary users and hurt
innovation.</LD>
<LD>   The steps are part of an organizational overhaul meant to improve
the efficiency of the nonprofit Internet Corp. for Assigned Names and
Numbers, which is based in Marina del Rey.</LD>
<LD>   The changes were approved by a 15-3 vote on the final day of a
conference on Internet addresses this week in Shanghai.</LD>
<TE>   "This will make ICANN a much more efficient and effective
organization that will get things done better and faster and be more
plugged in to the community than we are now," Chief Executive Stuart
Lynn told reporters after a board meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Lynn and others said the group's former method of electing five of
the 18 board members bogged ICANN down in debates that held up its
main work -- making decisions that affect everything from how Web
sites are named to how e-mail is sent.</TE>
<TE>   The board had approved the framework of the reorganization
earlier, and this week's meeting was largely about filling in the
details, including approving the new bylaws.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new system, the board is to be picked by a nominating
committee and a trio of affiliated organizations representing groups
of address holders. The changes are to take effect at an ICANN
conference in Amsterdam in December.</TE>
<TE>   Critics said the revisions were aimed at getting rid of dissenting
board members who say the group is out of touch with Internet users.</TE>
<TE>   "ICANN ... is not allowing public participation," said Karl
Auerbach, a California consultant who is one of the five elected
board members. He voted against the changes.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very much becoming a body that follows the interests of big
business," Auerbach added. He said the group had become an aggressive
protector of corporate copyrights on the Internet and was becoming
irrelevant to ordinary users.</TE>
<TE>   ICANN has authority over domain names -- the suffixes such as
".com" and ".org" at the end of Internet addresses -- through a 1998
agreement with the U.S. government.</TE>
<TE>   The board also approved a plan that could require regional
registries to pay the world body more for each address that they
register. The money will help fund ICANN efforts to coordinate and
fight hacker attacks.</TE>

<HD>October a Winning Month for Wall Street</HD>
<DH>Still, stock prices have a long way to go to wipe out the
year's losses. Expectations are high for a Fed rate cut.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street on Thursday locked in its first winning month since
spring and the Dow Jones industrials' second-best October on record.
But the market struggled late in the session, hurt by a plunge in
health-care stocks triggered by fraud allegations.</LD>
<LD>   Stocks still managed to finish mostly higher, despite more data
suggesting the economy is losing momentum. Those reports drove
Treasury bond yields sharply lower again.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow closed with a loss of 30.38 points, or 0.4%, at 8,397.03,
while the Nasdaq composite inched up 3.02 points, or 0.2%, to
1,329.75.</LD>
<TE>   Winners topped losers by 18 to 14 on the New York Stock Exchange
and by 17 to 16 on Nasdaq, in active trading.</TE>
<TE>   For the month, the Dow rose 10.6%, second only to the 13.8% gain
of January 1987. The Nasdaq rose 13.5% in October while the Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 advanced 8.7%.</TE>
<TE>   The last time Wall Street's main gauges posted monthly gains was
March.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks hit five-year lows early in October, then rocketed amid
better-than-expected corporate earnings reports.</TE>
<TE>   "What is important to remember is that October has frequently been
a bear market killer," said Alan Ackerman, executive vice president
at Fahnestock &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Since World War II, a number of major market declines have ended
in October, including the bear market of 1990 that was triggered by
imminent war between the United States and Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Still, stock prices have a long way to go to wipe out the year's
losses. The Dow has a year-to-date loss of 16.2%, while Nasdaq is
down 31.8% and the S&amp;P is off 22.9%.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's economic reports showed a rise in jobless-benefit
claims and a decline in Chicago-area manufacturing activity.</TE>
<TE>   The government today will report on October employment trends. A
weak report could further boost expectations that the Federal Reserve
will cut short-term interest rates when policymakers meet on
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Ed McKelvey, senior U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs Group, said
the Fed may cut half a point from its key short-term rate, now at
1.75%.</TE>
<TE>   Investors and traders in the Treasury bond market appeared to
place new bets that the Fed will indeed cut rates.</TE>
<TE>   The yield on the two-year T-note fell to 1.67% from 1.74%
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   That has returned the rate to the generational low it hit Oct. 9,
before market yields rebounded in mid-October.</TE>
<TE>   The yield on the 10-year T-note fell to 3.90% from 3.96%
Wednesday. It now is the lowest since Oct. 14.</TE>
<TE>   Among Thursday's market highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Health-care stocks were dragged lower late in the day after
federal agents raided a Tenet Healthcare hospital in Redding, Calif.,
after allegations of fraudulent billing by two doctors.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet shares plummeted $10.22 to $28.75. Also falling were HCA,
down $3.99 to $43.49, and Health Management Associates, down $1.14 to
$19.12.</TE>
<TE>   * Among major HMOs, WellPoint Health dropped $3.32 to $75.21 and
UnitedHealth sank $4.38 to $90.95. But PacifiCare surged $5.14 to
$29.56 in the wake of its strong earnings report Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   * Amgen fell $1.48 to $46.56. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. said government
regulators set reimbursement rates for the company's Aranesp drug
that are too low to encourage hospitals to use the anemia treatment.</TE>
<TE>   * Many retail stocks remained under pressure on worries about
consumer spending. Sears fell $1.02 to $26.26 and Home Depot eased 59
cents to $28.88.</TE>
<TE>   But El Segundo-based Big 5 Sporting Goods jumped $1.09 to $11.81
after reporting a 60% jump in third-quarter operating earnings per
share, excluding one-time charges.</TE>
<TE>   * Albertson's slumped $5.11 to $22.31 after the second-largest
U.S. supermarket chain reduced its fiscal third-quarter profit
forecast, citing weak sales. The news clipped other grocery chains,
including Safeway, down $1.75 to $23.10, and Kroger, off 61 cents to
$14.80.</TE>

<HD>Martha Stewart Living's 3rd-Quarter Profit Plunges</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. said Thursday its third-quarter
profit plunged and warned of a fourth-quarter shortfall as it
struggles to hang on to readers and advertisers amid the
insider-trading scandal embroiling its namesake founder.</LD>
<LD>   Martha Stewart Living, whose businesses range from magazines and
television to retail products sold at Kmart Corp. stores, canceled
its lucrative annual holiday TV special, citing the uncertainty
surrounding Chief Executive Martha Stewart, and announced the launch
of its first magazine that won't bear her name in the title.</LD>
<LD>   Stewart, who sold stock in troubled drug maker ImClone Systems
Inc. a day before U.S. regulators issued a devastating ruling against
its cancer drug Erbitux, is facing potential civil charges from the
Securities and Exchange Commission and a criminal investigation by
the U.S. Justice Department.</LD>
<TE>   In a possible sign that consumers are shying away from Stewart's
homemaking advice, circulation is down at the flagship Martha Stewart
Living magazine. Ratings also are down for Stewart's syndicated
television show, partly because of the investigations, the firm said.</TE>
<TE>   "Future advertising trends remain dependent on the investigations'
outcome," said President and Chief Operating Officer Sharon Patrick
in a conference call with analysts. "Clearly, our business is feeling
some degree of pressure."</TE>
<TE>   Martha Stewart Living, which had taken steps to de-emphasize its
founder even before news of the stock scandal hit, said the new
magazine will be called "Everyday Food" and subtitled "From the
Kitchen of Martha Stewart Living."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of the company, which have lost more than half their value
since news of Stewart's stock sale surfaced in June, closed down
$1.26, or 14.9%, at $7.20 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Martha Stewart Living's third-quarter net income fell 42% to $2.8
million, or 6 cents per share, compared with $4.8 million, or 10
cents, a year earlier. The results were in line with analyst
estimates, according to research firm Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Publishing and merchandising operations helped offset weakness in
the television and Internet segments in the third quarter. Total
revenue rose 4% to $70.9 million from $68 million.</TE>
<TE>   The company said profit in the fourth quarter, when retailers and
merchandisers typically post their strongest performance because of
holiday sales, would total 3 cents per share, well below the average
Wall Street estimate of 10 cents per share, according to First Call.</TE>
<TE>   The company also said it would take a $3-million charge related to
the investigation of Stewart.</TE>

<HD>$300-Million Medical Office Complex Planned in West L.A.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Roger Vincent</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the largest medical office complexes in California, a
$300-million campus that eventually may include a surgical hospital,
is being planned in West Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The project by Stonebridge Holdings Inc., near the northwest
corner of Bundy Drive and Olympic Boulevard, comes as health-care
properties are one of the few strong performers in the commercial
real estate industry.</LD>
<LD>   Westside Medical Park, as the project is being called, would
consist of four six-story medical office buildings totaling 750,000
square feet and two parking structures.</LD>
<TE>   They would surround a six-acre, $6-million Japanese-style garden
that would be open to the public.</TE>
<TE>   An environmental impact review of the project is underway.
Teledyne Technologies Inc. occupies part of the site. Its lease
expires in 2007.</TE>
<TE>   Stonebridge hopes to receive city approvals by next September,
said Michael R. Lombardi, president of the Los Angeles company that
develops and manages medical office buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Although most of Southern California's commercial real estate
market is mired in a slump, the expanding medical industry --
including the growth of outpatient surgery centers -- has pushed the
vacancy rate for medical office space across the region to about 5%,
roughly one-third of the rate for office space, brokers and property
owners say.</TE>
<TE>   In Beverly Hills, home to one of the nation's most prestigious
clusters of medical office buildings, medical office landlords are
getting some of the highest monthly office rents in Southern
California -- nearly $4 a square foot.</TE>
<TE>   Rents at the proposed Westside Medical Park would be between $4.25
and $4.50 a square foot, Lombardi said.</TE>
<TE>   If Stonebridge officials decide to add the hospital, it would push
the projected completion date from January 2007 to mid 2008, Lombardi
said.</TE>
<TE>   The project, which will be built in three phases, is a joint
venture with Menlo Park-based insurer Argonaut Group Inc., which has
owned the property since the early 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   It is being designed by Los Angeles architecture firm AC Martin
Partners.</TE>

<HD>Judge Is Expected to Toughen Microsoft Antitrust Settlement</HD>
<DH>In today's ruling, legal experts predict federal deal will
include some of dissenting states' fixes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Joseph Menn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge will rule today on whether to approve, reject or
modify Microsoft Corp.'s landmark antitrust settlement with the
Justice Department, a turning point for the most important monopoly
case in a generation.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington will make
her ruling after the U.S. stock markets close, probably in both the
federal government's lawsuit and in the parallel case brought by
California, Iowa and seven other states that believe the proposed
federal settlement is weak.</LD>
<LD>   Many legal experts predicted Thursday that Kollar-Kotelly would
try to incorporate some of the states' requested remedies in the
federal deal, making the year-old settlement at least a little
tougher on the world's most valuable company.</LD>
<TE>   They cited the long time that Kollar-Kotelly has been working on
the ruling and her request at the trial's end that the states rank
their proposals by importance.</TE>
<TE>   "If all she was going to do was rubber-stamp the [federal] Tunney
Act settlement, she wouldn't have taken five months," said Robert H.
Lande, a law professor at the University of Baltimore. "She's trying
to work out a better remedy."</TE>
<TE>   If the judge applies only modest changes -- or none at all -- to
the settlement, the 4-year-old case might come to an end. If she
comes down hard on Microsoft, the company is certain to appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft declined to comment Thursday. In an earlier interview,
Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith promised an appeal if the
company has to give up much of its proprietary software, split the
Windows operating system into pieces, or if the details of the ruling
are unworkable.</TE>
<TE>   "It's basically simple economics that says it doesn't make sense
to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to develop software if you
have to give away the results," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft, the Justice Department and the nine states reached
their agreement ahead of a trial to determine how Microsoft should be
punished for illegally using its Windows monopoly to crush threats
from Netscape Communications Corp.'s Web browser and Sun Microsystems
Inc.'s Java programming language, and how the company should be
restrained from abusing its power in the future.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, a federal appeals court threw out a proposed breakup of
Microsoft while affirming it broke the law.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft already has implemented some aspects of the proposed
settlement. It disclosed more information about how Windows interacts
with other Microsoft programs so that competing software makers can
improve their products. Microsoft also changed its pricing policy,
setting uniform licensing fees for the 20 biggest computer firms and
promised not to retaliate if they use non-Microsoft functions on
Windows-based computers.</TE>
<TE>   Gateway Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Dell Computer Corp. have
since begun including the WordPerfect word-processing program made by
Corel Corp. instead of Microsoft's Word on some less-expensive
machines.</TE>
<TE>   But the effect on Microsoft has been slight. Microsoft reaped
record revenue of $7.75 billion in the third quarter and more than
doubled its profit.</TE>
<TE>   The dissenting states want to go further in many areas, forcing
Microsoft to disclose more internal mechanisms and do so earlier in
the manufacturing process, which they told Kollar-Kotelly was their
top priority.</TE>
<TE>   They also want to force Microsoft to offer a less-expensive,
stripped-down version of Windows that computer makers could modify;
to release the code for Internet Explorer, denying Microsoft the
fruits of its harm to Netscape, since purchased by AOL Time Warner
Inc.; and to license versions of its Office software for use on other
operating systems such as Linux.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft also faces lawsuits by shareholders, AOL and Sun and an
antitrust inquiry by the European Union, which is expected to issue a
preliminary ruling soon.</TE>

<HD>Medicare Cutting Pay for Amgen's Aranesp</HD>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amgen Inc. will get a "significantly" smaller reimbursement next year
for its Aranesp anemia drug for some patients on Medicare under new
rules announced by the U.S. health insurance program.</LD>
<LD>   The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services now will pay
hospitals less for Medicare patients receiving Aranesp in outpatient
settings.</LD>
<LD>   About 10% of Aranesp's revenue comes from U.S. hospital outpatient
reimbursements, the company said.</LD>
<TE>   The reduced rates represent about $63 million to $76 million of
estimated 2003 Aranesp sales, said Jennifer Chao, an analyst with RBC
Capital Markets.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Thousand Oaks-based Amgen fell $1.48, or 3.1%, to $46.56
on Nasdaq.</TE>

cuts on top of 30,000 announced a week after the Sept. 11 attacks,

<LD>The California Supreme Court sent a former smoker's suit against
Philip Morris Cos. Inc. back to the appellate level for review.</LD>
<LD>   The move comes months after the court handed the tobacco industry
a partial victory in a verdict that gave cigarette makers some
protection from smoker lawsuits.</LD>
<LD>   The case going back to the appellate court was brought by Patricia
Henley, who has inoperable lung cancer. She was awarded $1.5 million
in compensatory and $50 million in punitive damages, but the punitive
damage award was later lowered to $25 million.</LD>

<HD>Food Irradiation Firm's Sales Slow to Take Off</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>

<LD>Tainted deli meat. Contaminated hamburger. Bacteria-laden cantaloupe.</LD>
<LD>   Consumers might have thought the onslaught of deadly food scares
this past year would have sparked sales for SureBeam Corp., the
nation's largest irradiation company. But as investors know, the
company has been caught in a difficult waiting game -- and the losses
are piling up.</LD>
<LD>   The trouble for SureBeam is that it's depending on the federal
government to approve wider use of its germ-zapping equipment by food
processors beyond hamburger and on retailers to embrace the
controversial technology. And while it was waiting, its third-quarter
business stalled.</LD>
<TE>   The San Diego-based company said Thursday that its loss widened in
the three-month period ended Sept. 30 to $11 million, or 16 cents a
share, from $7.7 million, or 14 cents, a year earlier. Revenue
plunged more than 50% to $7 million from $14.5 million. The loss was
in line with analysts' estimates.</TE>
<TE>   "We had thought initially that" SureBeam's irradiation technology
would be more widely accepted "much sooner," said Leonard Teitelbaum
of Merrill Lynch Global Securities.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he and other analysts say they expect the company to become
profitable soon.</TE>
<TE>   In October, the U.S. Department of Agriculture approved use of
irradiation on imported produce, and the company said it is
finalizing negotiations to sell its equipment to a number of foreign
fruit producers and countries, which could help generate some $40
million in annual revenue.</TE>
<TE>   "The issuance of this rule is the first step in building an
international business," said Larry Oberkfell, SureBeam's president
and chief executive. "We are going to work hard to move SureBeam's
business forward."</TE>
<TE>   SureBeam also is expected to get a huge boost in the next few
years if the Food and Drug Administration approves irradiation for
use on a whole host of processed, precooked foods such as cold cuts
and hot dogs. In addition, the USDA said recently that irradiation
could be an option for participants in the federal school lunch
program to use on meat.</TE>
<TE>   However, the prospect of so much irradiated food coming to market
has some microbiologists and consumer groups up in arms. Public
Citizen intends to petition the government to block wider use of
irradiation.</TE>
<TE>   Although the federal government considers the technology safe,
some microbiologists say there hasn't been enough independent
research done to determine whether the chemical byproducts created
during the irradiation process are harmful.</TE>
<TE>   "It creates a false sense of security that [all the germs are]
dead," said Mansour Samadpour, a microbiologist and assistant
professor at the University of Washington. That, he said, may have
consumers thinking they can eat rare meat or be lax in how they
handle it.</TE>
<TE>   Irradiation kills pathogens, pests and food-spoilage
microorganisms by exposing them to controlled levels of ionizing
radiation, such as gamma rays, electrons or X-rays. The radiation
passes through packaging, blasting germs and pests. It also delays
mold and other spoilage, extending the food's shelf life.</TE>
<TE>   Though some Northeast supermarket chains have started to sell
irradiated ground beef, it is not yet available in much of the
country, including California.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts say it won't be long before many people in Southern
California have access to irradiated food. SureBeam recently clinched
a deal with an Imperial Valley slaughterhouse to test meat at
SureBeam's Vernon plant.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't really care about their revenues or earnings this
quarter," said Stephen Levenson of Gerard Klauer Mattison. "What's
important is they are signing up customers and supermarkets are
rolling the product out. Consumers are asking for it, rather than
having it forced down their throats."</TE>
<TE>   SureBeam stock fell 49 cents to close at $4.35 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Tenet's Stock Hammered on News of Probe</HD>
<DH>Two doctors are under investigation over possible billing
irregularities and unneeded procedures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Lee and Ronald D. White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal authorities are investigating whether two doctors at a Tenet
Healthcare Corp. hospital in Northern California performed numerous
unnecessary heart procedures on Medicare patients since late 1998.</LD>
<LD>   In an affidavit made public Thursday, FBI Agent Michael Skeen said
the two doctors, who practice at Redding Medical Center, performed an
unusually heavy volume of heart catheterizations and other coronary
procedures, of which as many as half -- based on the opinions of
other doctors -- may have been unnecessary.</LD>
<LD>   The affidavit said 167 of the patients later died, but did not
attribute their deaths to the two doctors.</LD>
<TE>   The 57-page document stated that Dr. Chae Hyun Moon and Dr. Fidel
Realyvasquez Jr. billed Medicare for millions of dollars. Authorities
said the investigation involves possible health-care fraud and making
false billings. No charges have been filed against either man.
Neither doctor could be reached for comment, but Realyvasquez's
attorney said the case is simply a disagreement between doctors and
insurers over what constitutes proper medical care.</TE>
<TE>   News of the investigation, which included a Wednesday raid at the
238-bed hospital, was another setback for Tenet, the nation's
second-largest hospital company.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet had been a star on Wall Street since early 2000, but since
Monday, when an analyst questioned the hospital chain's Medicare
reimbursements, its stock has been under severe duress. Thursday's
disclosure of the raid and investigation created a full-blown crisis
of confidence with investors.</TE>
<TE>   After falling about 20% in the prior three days, Tenet shares lost
an additional 26% on Thursday, down $10.22 to $28.75, and it
triggered a broader sell-off on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   Before the afternoon ended, trading in Tenet was halted
momentarily and the company, at the behest of New York Stock Exchange
officials, issued a second news release, which denied rumors
spreading on the trading floor that federal agents had raided Tenet's
corporate headquarters in Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the last thing the company needed," said Sheryl Skolnick,
a managing director at Fulcrum Global Partners in New York, which
provides research on health-care companies to investors. "It's so
sad, I can't tell you."</TE>
<TE>   Tenet executives, saying they learned Thursday of the Redding
hospital probe, stressed that decisions on medical procedures are
those of the attending physicians and that Tenet would conduct its
own probe of the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an investigation of doctors, not the hospital or Tenet,"
said Harry Anderson, a Tenet spokesman. He said the company had no
prior indication that there was anything out of the ordinary
occurring at Redding Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   In the FBI affidavit, another cardiologist at the hospital that he
took his suspicions about the two doctors to the hospital's chief
executive and chief financial officer last spring.</TE>
<TE>   The affidavit said the cardiologist believed that both hospital
administrators were aware of what was going on and looked the other
way "because Moon and Realyvasquez produce tremendous revenue for the
hospital."</TE>
<TE>   Redding Medical Center, which Tenet has owned for more than 30
years, is one of the its more-profitable hospitals. It generated a
net profit margin of 38% -- and pretax net income of $94 million --
in the year ended June 30, according to unaudited reports filed with
the state.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI affidavit stated that the two doctors derived enormous
income compared with other physicians, noting that Realyvasquez
ranked as the top Medicare biller in a list of 50 physicians of a
similar specialty in the Northern California region.</TE>
<TE>   Moon was ranked No. 2 among doctors of a similar specialty.</TE>
<TE>   Realyvasquez is alleged to have billed Medicare Part B nearly $3.6
million, for which he was paid $767,600, between July 1, 2001, and
June 30, 2002. Moon billed more than $3.9 million and was paid $1.6
million during the same period.</TE>
<TE>   In one instance cited in the affidavit, a woman evaluated by a
cardiologist in August was found to be in "relatively good health and
not suffering from any coronary artery disease."</TE>
<TE>   She went to Moon for a second opinion, and she received a heart
catheterization that same day, according to the affidavit. Moon
further told the mother that she needed immediate bypass surgery,
which she subsequently received at Redding Medical Center, the
affidavit stated.</TE>
<TE>   Realyvasquez's attorney, Malcolm Segal, said his client has done
nothing illegal or wrong. He said it wasn't unusual that some doctors
may find problems in patients that other doctors don't, depending on
what tests were performed.</TE>
<TE>   "Our view of the circumstances is that the doctor has long taken
the position that his patients are entitled to the best diagnostic
tools available in order to obtain a favorable outcome," Segal said.
"He has enormous respect in the medical community, and while
insurance carriers may want to take the position that the tests could
be performed less expensively, the doctor wants to make sure that his
patients obtain the best result."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson, the Tenet spokesman, said "more and more doctors are
being aggressive about treating the beginnings of heart problems," in
large part because of new technologies.</TE>
<TE>   He said Tenet would hire outside cardiologists to examine records
of procedures performed by the two doctors to decide whether they
were medically unjustified.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet, which operates 113 acute-care hospitals nationwide,
including 40 in California, has openly pursued a strategy of treating
sicker patients and increasing the volume of high-acuity specialties,
such as cancer and cardiology.</TE>
<TE>   The company has said that has been a big reason for its strong
earnings growth; Tenet's earnings have surged more than 25% in each
of the last eight quarters.</TE>

<HD>Spitzer Issues Warning to Wall Street Firms</HD>
<DH>The N.Y. attorney general advises the brokerages to join
his reform efforts or expect more investigations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer on Thursday issued a warning to
Wall Street: Join his efforts to reform the industry and end
conflicts of interest in stock research or get used to being
investigated.</LD>
<LD>   Addressing lawyers for the 10 largest brokerage firms in a meeting
to settle industry probes, Spitzer said he was prepared to "dig
through e-mails for the next five years" to uncover more evidence
against the companies, people familiar with the meeting said. Spitzer
made the remark after each side complained that the other leaked
details about the talks.</LD>
<LD>   Regulators and the securities firms, which met at the New York
Stock Exchange, are working to reach an agreement to end
investigations that have pummeled brokerage firms' shares and their
images this year.</LD>
<TE>   To settle allegations that they deceived investors with misleading
stock recommendations, securities firms are ready to pay as much as
$1 billion to subsidize non-investment banking firms that produce
market research.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney general and Securities and Exchange Commission
enforcement chief Stephen Cutler last week gave major brokerages a
five-page proposal aimed at settling the dispute.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides are holding talks to come to terms on issues in that
proposal that remain unresolved. These include whether the firms will
be required to pay fines to states and restitution to investors as
well as how much contact analysts can have with bankers, sources
said.</TE>
<TE>   The firms have agreed in principle with the regulators' plan to
subsidize independent research and insulate research departments from
banking pressures.</TE>
<TE>   The firms have told regulators that any settlement should resolve
all issues at once and include fines and restitution. Cutler said
Thursday that he would provide the firms with more information about
possible fines next week, sources said.</TE>

<HD>Ernst &amp; Young Auditors Could Face SEC Charges</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three auditors who worked for Ernst &amp; Young may be charged by the
Securities and Exchange Commission for their role in an alleged
accounting fraud that cost Cendant Corp. $3.2 billion, people
familiar with the case said.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC's enforcement staff has notified the men that it plans to
recommend that the commission file charges against the three, who
audited books at CUC International Corp., the people said. CUC merged
with HFS Inc. in 1997 to form Cendant.</LD>
<LD>   Ernst &amp; Young and Cendant aren't targets of the investigation, the
people said.</LD>
<TE>   Cendant has never fully recovered from a one-day $14-billion drop
in its market value after Chief Executive Henry Silverman disclosed
the fraud in April 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a message that the auditors have to understand, and they
and their attorneys have to be more committed to reaching a
settlement," said Duke University law professor James Cox.</TE>
<TE>   The agency sent the men Wells notices, which give each a chance to
persuade SEC officials not to file the charges. The SEC may seek to
fine the three auditors or bar them from auditing public companies
after it files charges.</TE>
<TE>   Several Ernst &amp; Young auditors also face a criminal investigation
over the CUC audits, and at least one has testified to a grand jury
in Newark, N.J., the people said. They declined to say whether the
three who got the Wells notices -- Marc Rabinowitz, Ken Wilchfort and
Simon Wood -- are targets of the criminal probe.</TE>
<TE>   Wilchfort's and Wood's lawyers declined to comment. Rabinowitz's
attorney, Gerald Krovatin, didn't return calls seeking comment.
Wilchfort and Rabinowitz are partners at the world's fourth-largest
accounting firm. Wood has left the New York-based firm.</TE>
<TE>   Cendant's former chairman, Walter Forbes, and ex-vice chairman, E.
Kirk Shelton, face a criminal trial on charges of inflating earnings
at CUC for a decade to boost share price and fund acquisitions. Three
former CUC executives have pleaded guilty and are cooperating with
prosecutors in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Cendant claims Wilchfort, Rabinowitz and Wood worked closely with
the CUC executives who pleaded guilty and that Rabinowitz vouched for
the accuracy of CUC's books in several meetings with HFS executives
before the merger.</TE>
<TE>   Cendant has sued Ernst &amp; Young, alleging in its complaint that
"rather than exposing the fraud, E&amp;Y chose to facilitate it and reap
millions of dollars in audit fees."</TE>

<HD>Electric Scooter Maker Zap Bids on Ford Unit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John O'Dell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Zap, a small Bay Area manufacturer of electric bicycles and scooters
that only recently emerged from bankruptcy reorganization, said
Thursday that it has offered Ford Motor Co. $10 million in cash,
stock and warrants for its La Jolla-based Think electric vehicle
division.</LD>
<LD>   Ford paid $23 million for Think three years ago and has invested
more than $100 million in the company, but pulled the plug on the
unit earlier this summer, citing poor demand.</LD>
<LD>   Think, originally part of Norway's Pivco Industries, makes
electric bicycles, golf-cart style neighborhood vehicles and the
plastic-bodied two-seat Think City, which is certified as a
highway-legal passenger car capable of a top speed of 60 mph and a
maximum range, at much-reduced speeds, of 60 miles between charges.</LD>
<TE>   Though Ford and General Motors Corp. have abandoned the
battery-powered electric car market, DaimlerChrysler continues to
operate a subsidiary, GEM, that sells battery-powered neighborhood
electric vehicles that are legal on city streets posted for 35 mph or
less.</TE>
<TE>   Zap has never been in the car business, but Chairman Gary Starr
said Thursday that the 8-year-old company's "sole business is
electric vehicles, and we can focus on them while they were just a
sideline for the major auto companies."</TE>
<TE>   Though Ford and GM have leased electric vehicles to a small number
of consumers, they have not offered them for sale.</TE>
<TE>   "People who rented the Think City tell us they want to buy it, and
people who rented the EV-1 from GM wanted to buy it," Starr said. "We
think there is a market for these cars."</TE>
<TE>   Starr said Zap, with 30 employees and $5 million in sales last
year, is working on "a technology that can make the Think cars a lot
more cost effective." He declined to comment further, citing a
confidentiality agreement with Ford.</TE>
<TE>   Ford environmental affairs spokeswoman Carolyn Brown said she
could not comment on Zap or its offer. But Ford said in August that
it would try to sell Think, or work with the Norwegian government --
where the Think City is built -- to keep the company viable. Think
has two facilities outside Oslo and employs about 150 people. It has
fewer than 100 employees at its headquarters in La Jolla.</TE>
<TE>   Zap's shares were up 5 cents to $1.50 Thursday in over-the-counter
trading.</TE>

<LD>Nobody should be surprised by the "abrupt" end of the 20-month
alliance between Israel's Labor Party and the Likud government of
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.</LD>
<LD>   This sort of thing has happened before in Israeli politics. This
time, though, there is a difference: The national unity government is
collapsing not over the peace process but over West Bank settlements.</LD>
<LD>   The end began when Labor ministers, led by Defense Minister
Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, resigned Wednesday evening. Technically, the
resignations take effect 48 hours after they were submitted.</LD>
<TE>   With his coalition considerably narrowed, Sharon could begin
feeling pressure from smaller, right-wing parties for additional
settlement funding. Yet a sharp shift rightward could alienate swing
centrist voters in 2003 Israeli general elections.</TE>
<TE>   Another constraint involves Sharon's relationship with President
Bush.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli leader has promised the White House that Israel will
avoid any unnecessary actions on the Palestinian or Iraqi fronts that
could complicate a possible U.S. attack against Iraq, just as he
earlier promised not to harm Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Ben-Eliezer and more dovish challengers for his top Labor Party
leadership post saw their party's participation in the Sharon
government as sanctioning both Israel's settlement activity in the
West Bank and the cutting of social programs at a time of economic
downturn.</TE>
<TE>   The doves are not convinced that they can beat Sharon in next
year's elections, but they believe that a Likud government forced to
function alone will eventually lose public support, even if it wins
in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   To insulate himself from various pressures, Sharon knows that he
must keep left-of-center Israelis and the U.S. inside the political
tent.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, Arafat once accomplished this purpose for Sharon. By
not halting violence and rejecting then-President Clinton's peace
initiative, Arafat led to Sharon's February 2001 election landslide,
serving as the glue keeping the disparate factions of the government
together, bringing the U.S. and Israel closer than ever and moving
Israeli opinion to the right.</TE>
<TE>   For the Palestinians, this self-defeating approach has been
disastrous, as Arafat aide Mohammed Dahlan admitted recently in the
London-based Arabic daily Al Hayat: "We should have turned into a
popular [or nonlethal] intifada and stopped the armed activity, but
we didn't because we don't have the courage as a leadership to so."</TE>
<TE>   After a controversy erupted, Dahlan denied making the statement.</TE>
<TE>   As for Sharon, the current dissolution could still yield dividends
for him. He clearly wants the hawkish Ben-Eliezer to win as Labor
leader in that party's Nov. 19 primary, believing that Ben-Eliezer is
the key to bringing Labor back into the unity government after the
next general election. Sharon also is counting on Arafat's continued
leadership to seal his own reelection as prime minister.</TE>
<TE>   Both Sharon and Ben-Eliezer view the settlement issue as pivotal
in ensuring their political survival and enabling them to stave off
insurgency bids from within their own parties.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon views fealty to settlements as enabling him to woo away or
to neutralize the Likud right-wing ideological core. These party
faithful have been swayed by former Premier Benjamin Netanyahu's
charge that Sharon should be tougher against Palestinian terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Labor's focus on settlements transcends the peace issue and
reflects demographics. Jews now make up a mere 53% majority of Israel
plus the West Bank and Gaza areas, despite the influx of close to 1
million Jews from the former Soviet Union and subsidies to encourage
growth among the ultra-Orthodox movement, whose adherents tend to
have more children. By the end of the decade, demographers such as
Hebrew University's Sergio DellaPergola predict, Jews will be a
minority, jeopardizing Israel's raison d'etre as both a Jewish and
democratic state.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, settlements and demography matter in the long term. But in
the short term, lack of Palestinian Authority action in halting
suicide bombs is likely to lead Israelis rightward.</TE>
<TE>   Labor's best chance for a victory in the 2003 general elections is
if the Palestinians oust Arafat and the idea of peace can be viewed
again as a real hope, not a mirage.</TE>

<HD>Treat Iraq, N. Korea the Same: Nonmilitary Means Can Work</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stansfield Turner</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In responding to North Korea's confession of nuclear perfidy, we are
missing the bigger picture.</LD>
<LD>   The issue is not whether North Korea or Iraq is the greater threat
to us today. It is that we have every reason to believe both
countries are striving to acquire nuclear weapons. Both should be
stopped cold, not just for what they might do with such weapons but
for the precedent it would set for other would-be proliferators.</LD>
<LD>   Back in 1990, the United Nations Security Council agreed that it
was important to denuclearize Iraq. It forced a highly intrusive
inspection-and-destruction regime on the Iraqis, an unprecedented
interference with a sovereign nation, in the name of preventing
nuclear proliferation. That regime, unfortunately, was allowed to
lapse in 1998.</LD>
<TE>   Why is it any less important today? Should not the Security
Council be even more concerned, in light of North Korea's admitted
effort to acquire nuclear weapons? Or is the world community going to
give up on preventing the spread of nuclear weaponry?</TE>
<TE>   If the Security Council or some other group does not reinstate the
inspection/destruction regime in Iraq and begin one in North Korea, a
moment of opportunity may pass.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than debate whether we should deal with Iraq through war
and North Korea through diplomacy, we should insist on the same
treatment for both.</TE>
<TE>   That would be an even more coercive approach than the 1970 Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty, the 1990 sanctions on Iraq or the 1994
agreements with North Korea. It could include economic sanctions,
such as those now in effect with Iraq; diplomatic isolation,
including suspension from the U.N.; physical isolation, including
flight bans; and financial isolation, including denial of access to
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.</TE>
<TE>   This would be an ambitious undertaking. The United States would
have to sell it to the Security Council, NATO or some other enforcing
grouping.</TE>
<TE>   That would not be easy, but there are reasons to be hopeful. One
is that applying the same rules to both nations would lessen the
sting for nations that support one or the other. Another is that
there would be a long-range objective, limiting the numbers of
nuclear powers to those existing today, with which few nations could
take issue.</TE>
<TE>   In short, we must look past Iraqi and North Korean programs for
weapons of mass destruction to a broader purpose. The hour is getting
late, but if the world community sets an objective of preventing
further nuclear proliferation, there is at least a chance it could
work.</TE>
<TE>   The United States should not pass up such an opportunity in a rush
to settle scores with Saddam Hussein, stop him from supporting
terrorists or some other objective.</TE>
<TE>   A world of many nuclear powers could easily be a world that
experiences the use of nuclear weapons. Is that the world we want to
leave to our children and grandchildren?</TE>

<HD>It's a New Day, and Brazil Wants a New Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Weisbrot</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last Sunday's election in Brazil should send a message to
Washington's economists and policymakers that their prescriptions for
economic progress are no longer viable. But these people are slow
learners.</LD>
<LD>   The conventional wisdom among economists is that Brazil faces a
grave danger: that the Workers' Party government of the victorious
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva might deviate from the orthodox economic
policies of the past, causing a financial and economic disaster.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the financial news reporting in the near future will
center on whether Lula can gain the trust of the financial markets by
convincing them that he will continue the economic policies of his
predecessor.</LD>
<TE>   But this stands the world on its head. It is the current set of
economic policies that have directly caused Brazil's current
problems.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last eight years of the administration of Fernando
Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's public debt swelled from 29% to more than
62% of gross domestic product. This is mostly because of very high
interest rates: The average after-inflation rate of interest on the
public debt has been more than 16% annually. This rate of debt
accumulation is not sustainable; either interest rates will have to
come down or the government will have to renegotiate its debt.</TE>
<TE>   But the economists of the International Monetary Fund, who came
through in September with a $30-billion loan package, have not
offered assistance for either strategy. Instead, they have used this
loan to try to lock Brazil into the same high-interest-rate,
budget-austerity, low-growth policies of the past. The short-term
rate set by Brazil's Central Bank is 21%, one of the highest in the
world.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine if our own Federal Reserve set interest rates that high
instead of the current 1.75%; nobody would be able to afford a home
mortgage loan.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil used to have one of the fastest-growing economies in the
world: From 1960 to 1980, its income per person grew by 141%. Since
1980 it has hardly grown at all. Over the last eight years, income
per person has grown about a modest 1.3% annually, and the economy
has accumulated a high level of foreign debt in addition to the
public debt buildup. The $100 billion in privatizations over the last
eight years have not seemed to help Brazil with its debt or with
economic growth.</TE>
<TE>   What is true for the Brazilian economy also is true for the Latin
American region as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   It is one thing for a regional economy to undergo a cyclical
downturn; it is quite rare, in modern economic history, for the
average person to be no better off -- and, given changes in Latin
America's distribution of income and wealth, probably worse off --
than he was two decades earlier.</TE>
<TE>   One would think that a prolonged economic failure of this
magnitude might cause its architects to reconsider their policy
prescriptions. There could be a healthy debate about what has gone
wrong and what policies need to be changed. Yet there has been very
little of that within the IMF, which is the leader among policymaking
institutions, or within the economics profession.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, the great fear among economists, echoed on Wall Street and
in most of the media, is that Brazil and Latin America will abandon
the "free-market" policies adopted over the last 20 years, including
the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas.</TE>
<TE>   In 1932, during the Great Depression, the American electorate
overrode the business community and the economics profession by
choosing Franklin D. Roosevelt as president. The Brazilians now have
demanded a New Deal for their own country of 175 million people.
Other countries are likely to follow.</TE>
<TE>   The IMF and the U.S. government should step back and not interfere
rather than try to defend the economic orthodoxy that has put Brazil
into its two-decade-long slump.</TE>

<HD>We Have a Failure to Communicate</HD>
<DH>In emergencies, police and firefighters need to get on the
same frequency.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jack Weiss</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Beltway sniper shootings not only disrupted civilian life around
the nation's capital last month, they stretched public safety
communications to the breaking point. Police from different counties,
states and agencies struggled to speak with one another because their
communications systems were often incompatible.</LD>
<LD>   Flash back to Sept. 11, 2001. New York Police Department
helicopter pilots circling the World Trade Center reported their
assessment that the towers' collapse was probably imminent, unaware
that the firefighters in the buildings could not hear what they were
saying.</LD>
<LD>   As former Sens. Gary Hart and Warren Rudman wrote in their recent
Council on Foreign Relations report on holes in emergency
preparedness, "in virtually every major city and county in the United
States, no inter-operable communications system exists to support
police, fire department, and county, state, regional and federal
response personnel during a major emergency."</LD>
<TE>   That includes Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The digital radios carried by Los Angeles Police Department
officers and the analog radios used by local firefighters cannot
communicate with each other. Although the Fire Department has
purchased some digital radios for use during an emergency, police and
fire commanders directing emergency response have to play an
elaborate game of "telephone" to relay radio transmissions.</TE>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department can link with the LAPD but is likewise
unable to communicate directly with firefighters.</TE>
<TE>   It shouldn't take a mass killer, a terrorist attack or a
catastrophic earthquake to bring about a remedy for L.A.'s
communications gap. Some problems, like 911 overload, are already
urgent.</TE>
<TE>   During the Washington sniper attacks, thousands of citizen calls
to 911 overwhelmed emergency circuits. A Maryland 17-year-old died
after an asthma attack Oct. 14 after what family members described as
repeated unsuccessful efforts to get through to 911.</TE>
<TE>   Many callers -- reportedly including the suspects themselves --
were frustrated by the ad hoc tip lines established to collect
information from the public.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles already has a 911 system stretched beyond the max,
often by nonemergency calls. Attempts to get tips and nonemergency
complaints sent to other numbers have foundered for lack of publicity
and coordination. The threat of terrorism makes it imperative to
route routine callers off emergency circuits.</TE>
<TE>   The long-anticipated 311 nonemergency system is scheduled to begin
service before the end of the year, and no delays should be
tolerated.</TE>
<TE>   The city's new 911 call center also is to begin handling calls in
the coming weeks. This long-awaited facility has computer-operated
phones and a customized dispatch system that will improve emergency
communications.</TE>
<TE>   The city also is preparing to build a new $120-million facility to
house the Emergency Operations Center approved in March 2002 as part
of Proposition Q. The center should be designed not to accommodate
the current, incompatible communications systems of the Police
Department and Fire Department but rather to be the hub of a new
integrated emergency communications network.</TE>
<TE>   That's the future, however. Some problems can be cured here and
now.</TE>
<TE>   The technology to link firefighters and police officers in real
time already exists. "Interconnector" systems provide instantaneous
patching among as many as 24 different radio systems.</TE>
<TE>   Politicians talk a good game about protecting firefighters and
police officers, but they use budget concerns to delay technology
that can save lives. It will take unprecedented cooperation between
the city and the county to fund systems and link departments that
have historically failed to cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   We've heard the warnings from 9/11 and the sniper case. There's no
excuse for ignoring any part of the problem.</TE>

most lopsided Electoral College defeat of any presidential candidate.
The most lopsided outcome occurred in 1936, when President Franklin
D. Roosevelt defeated Republican Alfred M. Landon, 523 to 8. In the
1984 presidential contest, President Reagan defeated Mondale, 525 to
13.</LD>

<LD>Mark Nathanson -- George Skelton's Capitol Journal column Thursday in
the California section contained a typographical error that changed
the meaning of a quote. It should have read that the U.S. attorney
explained to a judge that convicted felon Mark L. Nathanson described
conduct about Gov. Gray Davis "which was not illegal," rather than
"not legal," as the story erroneously said.</LD>

<LD>Intrigue and controversy continue to roil the waters of the 180-mile
Klamath River, which rises in southern Oregon but courses mainly
through Northern California before flowing into the ocean south of
Crescent City.</LD>
<LD>   When more than 33,000 salmon died while migrating upstream to
spawn in September, federal scientists said the fish succumbed to
disease, but they weren't sure of the cause. Now it's becoming
evident that some state experts were correct in thinking the fish got
sick because farmers diverted too much water to irrigate more than
200,000 acres of crops along the California-Oregon border.</LD>
<LD>   This week, a federal biologist invoked the Whistleblower
Protection Act after accusing the Bush administration of ignoring his
findings and pressuring his chiefs to agree to lower water flows for
fish so that the farmers would get their full allocation of water
this year. The biologist, Michael Kelly of the National Marine
Fisheries Service, helped write an opinion calling for more water to
protect fish listed under the Endangered Species Act. Even at that
level, a state official protested, "Those flows are just far too
low."</LD>
<TE>   But the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which delivers water to the
farmers, insisted the crops get their full allotment. They did and
the salmon died.</TE>
<TE>   Here's the problem: There isn't enough water in the river to meet
all needs. In the mid-1990s, a federal solicitor held that endangered
species had first priority, downstream Indian tribes came next and
then the irrigators. The Bush administration has reversed that order,
despite the century-old treaty rights of Native Americans who need
both water and salmon.</TE>
<TE>   There is a way to make more water available. Environmental groups
sued Secretary of the Interior Gale A. Norton on Wednesday to require
her to phase out the leasing to farmers of 20,000 acres within the
Lower Klamath and Tule Lake national wildlife refuges. The Wilderness
Society and others argued in U.S. District Court in Sacramento that
diversions to grow grain and row crops had turned large areas of
wetlands into "barren, cracked, dried mud."</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service concluded, logically
enough, that farming was not compatible with the purposes of refuges.
The Bush administration reversed that decision too.</TE>
<TE>   The region is the largest wintering ground for bald eagles in the
lower 48 states. Millions of migrating waterfowl also stop there, but
their numbers have declined dramatically since water diversions
damaged wetlands.</TE>
<TE>   With a phaseout of the refuge leases, farmers still could irrigate
their other 180,000 or so acres, the salmon would get more water and
the refuges would revive to serve again as a vital link in the birds'
age-old natural migration cycle. No one should have to go to court to
get that result.</TE>

<LD>At the opulent Getty Center in Brentwood the other day, two women
paused by Dorothea Lange's luminous 1938 photograph of unemployed men
lined up to register for unemployment benefits. Lange had taken her
shot from above, catching the sunlight that fell on the troubled
shoulders and worn-out shoes of men destitute after years of too
little work and too little to eat.</LD>
<LD>   "Looks just like now," one of the women commented. "Yeah," said
her companion, "they're going to have to do something about it soon."</LD>
<LD>   For Dorothea Lange, photography was a means to bring about social
change, her camera as piercing as any political tract. Lange's images
for the Resettlement Administration, including her iconic photograph
of a migrant mother surrounded by her three disheveled children,
connected the insulated affluent to the millions who went hungry and
had nowhere to live during the Depression. The Getty's new show,
running through Feb. 9, demonstrates Lange's power behind the lens
and her enormous range.</LD>
<TE>   The exhibit is paired with a smaller collection of equally vivid
images from the California migrant camps of the 1930s taken by Horace
Bristol. A photojournalist, Bristol drew his inspiration from Lange's
work.</TE>
<TE>   Most Americans know Lange for the photographs she took while
traveling the nation during the 1930s, shooting pea pickers, cotton
pickers and the others who packed up jalopies and headed west, away
from failed Dust Bowl farms, only to find more hardship.</TE>
<TE>   But during the 1940s and '50s, Lange traveled the world -- often
on assignment for Life magazine -- recording ordinary moments in
locales as disparate as Utah, Pakistan, Indonesia and her home in
Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   For Lange, photography was as much about art as politics. You see
the despair on the faces, but also the light: shadows playing on the
lined countenance of a Hopi man, sunlight floating through the
dresses of Mormon women leaving church.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, though, Lange's photos and Bristol's are about the
nobility of daily life -- of hard work, feeding the children and
keeping the family together -- even when home is a rain-soaked tent
in a farm workers camp.</TE>

<LD>Even those who want to keep Los Angeles whole give the San Fernando
Valley secession movement credit for spurring reforms at City Hall.
Some who oppose secession have even toyed with the idea of voting for
it Tuesday, believing that would "send a message" to keep reform
alive without actually putting Los Angeles at risk.</LD>
<LD>   Don't count on it. Although polls show both the Valley and
Hollywood secession measures failing citywide, it's never a good idea
to take the outcome of an election for granted. There's a better way
to send that message, and a better message to send: Let's settle this
question and move on.</LD>
<LD>   Moving on does not mean abandoning the reforms sparked by the
threat of secession. They would be impossible to stop in any case,
given the momentum already underway with 55 neighborhood councils up
and running from San Pedro to Pacoima.</LD>
<TE>   Voters established these grass-roots advisory bodies to give
ordinary Angelenos a say in which streets need repairing and what
programs should be offered at the park down the block. The idea was
to foster community and counter the alienation fueling the
long-simmering Valley breakaway movement. Sadly, secession leaders
have dismissed these changes without even giving them a chance, which
insults the hundreds of people who have rolled up their sleeves to
organize their neighborhoods. That's politics: It's harder to sell a
breakup if the city is starting to work better.</TE>
<TE>   In the same vein, secession leaders admit that the city is busy
filling potholes and trimming trees but dismiss all that hard work as
a ruse to defeat secession. Talk about spin. Valley votes tipped last
year's mayoral election to James K. Hahn, who promised to improve
services. Imagine what his critics would be saying had he not lived
up to that promise. Enough already with this divisive hyperbole.</TE>
<TE>   City leaders can do much more to make this city work. City
Councilman Tom LaBonge, with the mayor's support, already is working
on ways to localize services by moving city workers into regional
city halls in the seven planning districts. City Councilwoman Wendy
Greuel and state Assemblyman Bob Hertzberg plan to push their ideas
for a borough system.</TE>
<TE>   The best way to promote positive change in Los Angeles is to move
on and vote no on Measures F and H.</TE>

<LD>Voting on Nov. 5 should include reading the preamble for each issue
instead of relying on TV prompts such as "for the children" or
"clean, safe water" or "safe neighborhoods" -- which are selling
phrases that may not be truthful. Where bonds are concerned, you
really should read the preamble if you own one square inch of real
property in California. As a competent adult, you probably already
have an opinion about how money is spent for schools and roads and in
other areas for which property owners are taxed. See and hear the TV
spots for and against these measures, but read the preamble on each
one before you spend your vote.</LD>

<TE>   Would you vote for $100 billion in bonds to support our state's
bloated bureaucracy? I don't think so. That's exactly why Gov. Gray
Davis and other politicians never put this to a vote. Instead, they
only let us vote on things everyone does want, like better schools,
emergency services, clean water, more police.</TE>
<TE>   Don't let them play this game. I urge you to vote against all of
the bond and tax-increase measures. Force the politicians to find the
money in their bloated $100-billion budget by cutting unnecessary
bureaucracy and selling off state properties.</TE>

<HD>Proposition 50 Would Protect Public Health</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Throughout history, diseases spread through water have been a leading
cause of death and illness. Indeed, the purification of our water
supply is one of the greatest public health achievements of the 20th
century. But even today we're still discovering new threats to public
health in our water. That's why Proposition 50 is so important. It
invests in our local water districts, providing them with grants to
upgrade equipment that can prevent contamination at the source. Today
we can eliminate or dramatically reduce levels of dangerous chemicals
like chromium, the gasoline additive MTBE and arsenic.</LD>
<LD>   After Sept. 11 we have well-founded new fears about our water
supply. Proposition 50 also increases security and safety at critical
sites across California, protecting our water supply from a terrorist
attack or a natural disaster. Safe drinking water is only one of the
benefits of Proposition 50. It will also help reduce water pollution,
clean up beach pollution and ensure a stable, reliable and secure
water supply for California.</LD>
<LD>   When the safety of our water supply is at stake, it is a concern
to each and every one of us. That's why a broad coalition of health,
business, labor and environmental groups are joining forces to
support Proposition 50.</LD>

<LD>Re "Fe Fi Ho Hum," Commentary, Oct. 28: It's true that many of the
German nursery rhymes and children's books are gruesome. However,
having grown up in Germany with most of these stories, such as
"Struwwelpeter," behind me, I don't think I am much the worse for it.
I never did suck my thumb (as far as I know) and my children did not,
either.</LD>
<LD>   I feel that your commentary should have given credit to the person
involved in Heinrich Hoffmann's story. The 19th century poem begins,
" 'Konrad!' sprach die Frau Mama," a mantra I heard throughout my
childhood, having been blessed with the same name. The name in German
-- and in the rhyme -- is spelled with a K.</LD>
<LD>   The complete poem can be found on the Internet both in German and
English, translated by Robert Godwin-Jones of Virginia Commonwealth
University.</LD>

<HD>A Decade of Inaction Precedes 'Rush to War'</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "War Hero McGovern Still Stands for the Courage to Fight for
Peace," Commentary, Oct. 29: Robert Scheer, to no one's surprise,
joins the legion of liberal commentators who decry our so-called
"thoughtless ... rush to war with Iraq."</LD>
<LD>   If anything is thoughtless it is the mindless repetition of that
hackneyed phrase. Iraq has been defying the expressed will of the
world community and thumbing its nose at the U.S. for over a decade.
The president has decided that enough is already way too much and
uses a show of impatience (can liberals not recognize an obvious
tactical maneuver?) to pressure the United Nations into finally
taking action. Despite his so-called unseemly haste, he allows the
French to talk him into giving Saddam Hussein yet another chance.</LD>
<LD>   Where is the thoughtless rush in all this? Anyone who has been
paying attention has seen this coming for years. Indeed, it should
have happened on President Clinton's watch. If a decade and more is a
rush to Scheer and his ilk, what would they consider thoughtful
deliberation -- a century and more?</LD>
<TE>   Paul Morgan Fredrix</TE>
<TE>   West Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I am thankful for Scheer's commentary on George McGovern. There is
a limit to the propaganda put out by people willing to carry water
for the Republicans (regardless of how polluted that water is); that
limit was attained and exceeded when Richard Nixon was running
against McGovern. In the usual Republican tactic of painting the
opponent black, McGovern was depicted as the ultimate peacenik and
communist collaborator who would have the U.S. run out of Vietnam in
a disgusting, confused, cowardly manner -- you know, the way Nixon
eventually did. Perhaps McGovern, who had seen war "up close and
personal" on his 35 missions against Germany in a B-24, just thought
we should give peace a chance.</TE>

<LD>On the Oct. 29 front page you say that the state spent its way into a
budget crisis, blaming Gov. Gray Davis. Have you not heard of the
business downturn that has wrecked state budgets all across the
nation? How about Enron? Is there any doubt that this crooked energy
giant and its crime partners engineered a crisis that will take
California two or three decades to pay for? Why is The Times so
ever-ready to lay the blame on the governor's doorstep?</LD>
<LD>   At every opportunity you badmouth Davis. Is it that he beat the
Republicans at their own fund-raising game? I believe Davis did a
great job of keeping the lights on after the manufactured energy
crisis was tossed in his lap.</LD>
<LD>   Tom Freeman</LD>
<TE>   Pinon Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So, the voters and nonvoters of California are aghast at the time
Davis spends on fund-raising and the amount of money he has
collected. Fund-raising is a necessary evil of running for office. If
we want to put a stop to it there are two choices: federal or state
funding of election campaigns (like that will ever happen), or how
about limiting the governor to one six-year term? Then he wouldn't
need to worry about reelection and could concentrate on the job he
had been elected to. Bring me a petition and I'll be the first to
sign it.</TE>

<TE>   I am voting for Bill Simon on Nov. 5 because he is a good man. He
inherited money and could have lived a hedonistic life -- making more
money, buying fancy cars, living easy. Instead, Simon has devoted a
good portion of his life to children and families in desperate
situations: runaway children, abused spouses, poor families,
out-of-work fathers, drug addicts. I have seen Simon give his money
and, remarkably, his time, to wonderful causes like Covenant House.
How rare is it for someone of wealth to devote, in addition to the
millions of dollars, hundreds of hours teaching or playing basketball
with teenagers? That's compassion. Simon has it, and Davis just
pretends. The state could use a man like Simon.</TE>

<LD>"Growing Peril to Diplomats" (editorial, Oct. 30) emphasizes the
danger to U.S. diplomats abroad and suggests that while "America
cannot develop its policies based on whether they please others," it
needs to do more to protect its diplomats. This useless bit of advice
says that while we are sending our emissaries to walk through the
fire, we should be outfitting them with better fire retardants
instead of trying to put out the fire.</LD>
<LD>   We absolutely do need to develop policies that please others. It
is this arrogant American attitude of ignoring others' interests that
has shaped our foreign policy and invited so much hatred from the
world. It has created a world of peril for American citizens
traveling abroad, as was recently illustrated in Bali. Our children
will be restricted to viewing pictures of exotic foreign lands
instead of experiencing them if we continue on this most destructive
path of throwing our ignorant, gluttonous weight on top of angrier,
leaner nations. Anyone wish to visit Egypt?</LD>

<LD>Thank you for honoring actress Beulah Quo (obituary, Oct. 25). A
fellow teacher who taught with my mother in the 1930s at Ginling
Girls College in Nanking, China, "Aunty" Beulah was not only a
tireless advocate of Asian Americans and their contributions to the
entertainment industry for over half a century, she was an elegant
and gracious woman who just happened to be a trailblazer in her field
and an outstanding role model to so many of us. While The Times
listed many of her achievements, just last month Beulah was
recognized by the Chinese Historical Society of America as one of its
eight women of honor at its Half of Heaven gala dinner. This
beautiful woman, both inside and out, will be terribly missed in the
Chinese and Chinese American communities nationwide.</LD>

<LD>Even though your Oct. 26 news brief, "Parents Angered by Lesbian's
Talk at School," regarding Diversity Day at Goleta Valley Junior High
School, was small, the issue it raised is not. Californians live in
one of the most diverse communities in the world. In her wisdom, the
principal decided to teach the students about many different kinds of
people they encounter each day. I was horrified that she buckled
under pressure from a conservative group of parents and agreed to
send a letter of apology to parents for failing to notify them of one
particular speaker. The fact that the speaker was a lesbian does not
excuse this type of behavior.</LD>

<HD>Robert Horn III, 59; Professor Wrote of Coping With ALS</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patricia Ward Biederman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert C. Horn III, a professor emeritus of political science at Cal
State Northridge who chronicled his long battle with Lou Gehrig's
disease, died of pneumonia Tuesday at Northridge Hospital Medical
Center. He was 59.</LD>
<LD>   An expert on the former Soviet Union, Horn taught political
science at Cal State Northridge from 1969 until his illness forced
him to retire in 1991.</LD>
<LD>   Known as a dedicated teacher, he had published a book on
Soviet-Indian relations, established the university's Model United
Nations program and won the campus' Distinguished Professor Award
before he learned, in 1988, that he had amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis, or ALS, a progressive neuromuscular disease that causes
paralysis and death.</LD>
<TE>   Baseball great Lou Gehrig died of the disease in 1941, two years
after his diagnosis.</TE>
<TE>   After Horn's diagnosis, he continued to teach and to coach girls
soccer at Chatsworth High School. He had been instrumental in getting
girls soccer adopted in the Los Angeles Unified School District, his
family said.</TE>
<TE>   When Horn retired from teaching after ALS left him unable to
breathe on his own, he joked: "My major consolation is that the
Soviet Union retired at the same time I did."</TE>
<TE>   No longer able to swallow or smile, Horn wrote a book about his
ALS in 1996 titled "How Will They Know if I'm Dead? Transcending
Disability and Terminal Illness."</TE>
<TE>   In a 1996 opinion piece in The Times, he explained why he had
chosen life:</TE>
<TE>   "After five years of being tethered to a ventilator, 'eating' via
a tube in my stomach, 'talking' with my eyebrows and operating the
computer with my foot, did I make the right choice? You bet! What I
have left is more valuable than what I have lost. The things I can do
are more important than those that I can't.... I can think, reason
and analyze, remember, read, write, learn and communicate. I can
love, feel happiness and sadness, be enthusiastic, get angry, feel
joy. I can believe, hope and have faith."</TE>
<TE>   Passionate about the right of the disabled and the dying to
choose, Horn published a book in 2001, with the help of friend
Gretchen Keeler, titled "Who's Right? Whose Right?: Seeking Answers
and Dignity in the Debate Over the Right to Die."</TE>
<TE>   Friends marveled at how, despite his illness, Horn retained his
sense of humor and his interest in political science. He continued to
write scholarly articles as well as pieces on world affairs for his
church bulletin.</TE>
<TE>   Friend and retired Cal State Northridge journalism professor
DeWayne Johnson said of Horn: "Stephen Hawking has the same illness,
and his mind remains sharp. Bob's mind remained sharp as well....
There was never a hint of his ailment in his writing."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Pennsylvania, Horn received a bachelor's degree in
political science in 1964 from Wittenberg University in Springfield,
Ohio, and a doctorate in law and diplomacy in 1969 from the Fletcher
School of Law and Diplomacy in Medford, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   A resident of Winnetka, Horn is survived by his wife, Judy; three
children, Jeff, Chris and Laura; two grandchildren; his mother,
Dottie Horn; and a brother and a sister.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service will be held at 3 p.m. Monday at Northridge
United Methodist Church, 9650 Reseda Blvd.</TE>

<HD>Nathan Juran, 95; Art Director, Filmmaker</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dennis McLellan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nathan "Jerry" Juran, who won an Academy Award for art direction on
John Ford's "How Green Was My Valley" and later tapped his strong
visual sense as a director of science fiction and fantasy films in
the 1950s and '60s, has died. He was 95.</LD>
<LD>   Juran, who is best known as a director of the 1958
adventure-fantasy film "The 7th Voyage of Sinbad," died of natural
causes Oct. 23 at his home in Palos Verdes Estates.</LD>
<LD>   As an art director, Juran's more than two dozen credits include
Robert Rossen's "Body and Soul," starring John Garfield; Edmund
Goulding's "The Razor's Edge," starring Tyrone Power; and Anthony
Mann's "Winchester '73," starring James Stewart.</LD>
<TE>   But his crowning achievement was "How Green Was My Valley," the
1941 best-picture Oscar winner about the decline of a Welsh coal
mining village, for which he shared the Academy Award for black and
white art direction with 20th Century Fox art department head Richard
Day.</TE>
<TE>   When the Welsh choir that the studio had brought to Hollywood to
appear in the film first glimpsed the 19th century Welsh mining
village that had been built at the Fox ranch in the Malibu hills,
co-star Maureen O'Hara told The Times this week, they were impressed
with its authenticity.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought they were going to kiss the ground any minute, they
were so thrilled," O'Hara said. "The set was absolutely stunning; it
was magnificent. It was just so wonderful because everything was
built out there. We never went to Wales. On top of one of the hills
was the church, and there was a street with all the houses, and on
top of the next hill was the top of the mine shaft."</TE>
<TE>   As for Ford's reaction to the sprawling set that Juran had
created, O'Hara said, "He thought it was wonderful. And he didn't
praise anything very often."</TE>
<TE>   Turning to directing in 1952, Juran is best remembered by fantasy
and science fiction fans as the director of not only "The 7th Voyage
of Sinbad," but "20 Million Miles to Earth" and "First Men in the
Moon," which all featured the work of special-effects wizard Ray
Harryhausen.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Mitchell, a film historian and film editor who knew the
director, said Juran, a trained architect, had an unusually strong
visual sense that complemented that of Harryhausen.</TE>
<TE>   "Nathan had a stronger visual background than a lot of directors,
and you can see that even in his non-Harryhausen films," Mitchell
said.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike many directors in the '50s, Mitchell said, Juran didn't
look down on the science fiction and fantasy film genre. And although
Juran was primarily a director of B movies, Mitchell said, "He was
able to pull off good stuff with no money and no time.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a major hallmark of Nathan's work, which is best
exemplified by two films he made that at the time he was too
embarrassed to put his name on" -- "The Brain From Planet Arous" and
"The Attack of the 50-Foot Woman," which he directed as Nathan Hertz.</TE>
<TE>   The films were screened at an American Cinematheque tribute to
Juran in Hollywood two years ago, Mitchell said, "and the audience
came to laugh at them. But once they realized the conditions they
were made under, they realized that these were actually triumphs of
creativity over time and budget."</TE>
<TE>   Juran's work as a director influenced a number of younger
filmmakers, including directors John Landis and Joe Dante. "He was
much more influential than he knew," Landis told The Times, recalling
his own decision to become a movie director after seeing "The 7th
Voyage of Sinbad" in Westwood Village when he was 8.</TE>
<TE>   Landis said Juran was remarkable not only for his collaborations
with Harryhausen, "all of which are really quality pictures," but for
his own work. "He was the consummate, no-nonsense craftsman," Landis
said. "What I admire most about him is his complete lack of
pretension. He approached it as a job of work."</TE>
<TE>   As Juran said in a rare interview for the science fiction fan
magazine Starlog in 1989:</TE>
<TE>   "I approached the picture business as a business. I always did
pictures for the money, and for the creative challenges. I wasn't a
born director. I was just a technician who could transfer the script
from the page to the stage and could get it shot on schedule and on
budget. I never became caught up in the 'romance' of the movies."</TE>
<TE>   Like "a lot of Hollywood work horses," Landis said, Juran went
into TV in the '50s and '60s, directing episodes of "My Friend
Flicka" and "Daniel Boone" -- as well as producer Irwin Allen's
science fiction series "The Time Tunnel," "Lost in Space," "Land of
the Giants" and "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea."</TE>
<TE>   The son of a shoemaker, Juran was born in an Austrian mountain
village in 1907. When he was 6, he and his family moved to America
and settled in Minneapolis, where they lived in the back of his
father's shoe shop.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating from high school, Juran attended the University
of Minnesota School of Architecture and earned a bachelor's degree in
engineering while continuing to work odd jobs. He won a summer
scholarship to study architecture at L'Ecole des Beaux Arts in
Fountainbleu, France. After working as a designer for a New York
architectural firm, he got a scholarship to the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, where he earned a master's degree in
architecture.</TE>
<TE>   With employment opportunities limited because of the Depression,
Juran moved to Los Angeles, where he landed a job as a draftsman in
the art department at RKO. After going to work at 20th Century Fox,
he made his auspicious leap from draftsman to art director on "How
Green Was My Valley."</TE>
<TE>   Juran enlisted in the Navy during World War II and was assigned to
the Field Photographic Unit of the Office of Strategic Services. He
was later assigned to the Royal Air Force Intelligence Center in
England.</TE>
<TE>   Juran made his directorial debut on "The Black Castle," a 1952
gothic melodrama starring Boris Karloff and Lon Chaney Jr. He also
directed future husband and wife Ronald Reagan and Nancy Davis in
their only screen pairing, "Hellcats of the Navy," in 1957.</TE>
<TE>   Juran is survived by his wife, Catherine; a son, Warren of Simi
Valley; a brother, Joseph of Rye, N.Y.; a sister, Minerva Goldberg of
Georgetown, Va.; and several grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial open house will be held at the Juran home Nov. 16.

<HD>Kam Fong Chun, 84; Played Role of Detective in 'Hawaii
Five-O'</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kam Fong Chun, 84, an actor best known for his portrayal of police
Det. Chin Ho Kelly on the television series "Hawaii Five-O," died
Oct. 18 in Hawaii after a long battle with lung cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Born Kam Ton Chun, he grew up in Honolulu, where his first teacher
misunderstood his name and made him write Kam Fong Chun. He later
made it his legal name.</LD>
<LD>   He overcame many adversities in his early life, including his
parents' divorce, which cast the family into poverty.</LD>
<TE>   He lost his first wife and two young children in the Japanese
attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, when two American bombers collided
and crashed into his house.</TE>
<TE>   He tried to kill himself, but his mother talked him out of it. He
joined the Honolulu Police Department and was an officer for 16 years
before quitting the force in 1959.</TE>
<TE>   He was selling real estate in the late 1960s when a colleague made
an appointment for him to audition for a role in "Hawaii Five-O," a
police drama that was to be shot entirely on location in Hawaii. Chun
played the part for 10 seasons before he tired of it and was written
out by having his character killed in the final episode of the
1977-78 season.</TE>
<TE>   The show, which starred Jack Lord as Det. Steve McGarrett, ran for
12 seasons on CBS, ending in April 1980, and was the longest
continuously running police show in the history of television.</TE>

<HD>At Rape Center, Technology Is State-of-the-Art</HD>
<DH>Advanced equipment is used to put together evidence for
police. Victims also get free medical treatment, counseling and legal
aid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anna Gorman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nurse practitioners at the Rape Treatment Center in Santa Monica take
digital photographs of victims' injuries and analyze slides with a
high-definition microscope. They use state-of-the art technology to
examine sexual assault victims and then present comprehensive rape
kits to police investigators.</LD>
<LD>   Unusual for its advanced forensic capabilities, the nonprofit
facility serves more than 1,000 victims a year, offering free medical
treatment, professional counseling and legal assistance. The clinic
is within Santa Monica-UCLA Medical Center, but treats rape victims
exclusively and is in a separate part of the hospital from the
emergency room. Rape center staff members also advocate for
legislation, testify in criminal cases and train police in the
preservation of time-sensitive evidence.</LD>
<LD>   The clinic's work has become even more important since the LAPD
recently revealed that detectives had mistakenly destroyed evidence
in 1,000 unsolved rape cases. Biological evidence gathered from
victims is compared to DNA profiles on police computer databases and
can be key in solving cases.</LD>
<TE>   Center director Gail Abarbanel said the detailed rape kits her
staff collects increase the possibility of rapists being found -- if
those kits are tested by police.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first time there has been a real breakthrough" in the
collection of rape evidence, she said. "That's why it's criminal not
to be able to use what we've collected."</TE>
<TE>   In most cities, rape victims go to hospital emergency rooms, where
they are treated after patients with life-threatening injuries or
illnesses. During that wait, evidence deteriorates and the chance of
catching attackers decreases, Abarbanel said.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Officer Rashad Sharif, who has taken more than 10 rape
victims to the center, said handling such cases used to be a
nightmare, because it involved spending endless hours at an emergency
room. But at the clinic, he said, the victims are attended to right
away.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that everything is going to be top-notch with the way
evidence is collected and packaged," he said. "They are very careful
with it. They know the procedures as well [as] or better than some
officers."</TE>
<TE>   The Rape Treatment Center started treating victims in 1974 and
opened its new facility in 1999 with funding from film producer Verna
Harrah. The center is open 24 hours a day, staffed with one counselor
and one nurse practitioner at all times. A doctor is also on call.</TE>
<TE>   Abarbanel said she believes that victims are more willing to seek
medical help and report their attacks to police if they are made a
priority and cared for with respect. "How victims are treated
initially has a huge impact on their willingness to participate in or
not participate in the criminal justice system," she said. "This is a
very supportive environment for them."</TE>
<TE>   Anna, an actress who was raped in Canoga Park three years ago,
said she believes that her healing began as soon as she arrived at
the center. "They treated me like a queen," said Anna, who did not
want her last name used. "I felt like I was a human being and not
just a victim."</TE>
<TE>   She said she was walking through a parking lot in May 1999 when a
man pointed a gun at her and forced her into her car. He drove her
around and stopped in an empty lot, where he raped her in the back
seat, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Several minutes later, the attacker jumped out of the car and ran
off. Shaking, Anna put her clothes back on and started the car.</TE>
<TE>   When she got to her Westside home, she called police, who
recommended that she go to the clinic because of its reputation. Anna
remembers sitting down with a counselor in a cozy room with a couch,
pillows and tissues on the coffee table</TE>
<TE>   "I can't tell you how significant even that was," she said. "It
was a soft place to rest. It's like being a little kid on an airplane
and the stewardess hands you a teddy bear because you are traveling
alone."</TE>
<TE>   She explained what happened during the attack and then was led
into the medical room, where she said the staff members acted
sensitively as they examined her. Throughout the process, she said,
they told her what to expect and frequently checked to make sure she
was OK.</TE>
<TE>   "When you feel like you are being well taken care of and your
evidence is being treated with the best technology, it is also a way
of someone taking what happened to you seriously," Anna said.</TE>
<TE>   She also attended individual and group counseling through the
center and continues to meet with the other three women in her group.
Her rapist was never caught.</TE>
<TE>   "That's always hard," she said. "It helps that I have some sense
of personal resolution, but it's never quite the same as resolving it
in reality."</TE>
<TE>   That's where the scientific equipment at the center comes into
play, Abarbanel said. Staff members can never guarantee that a case
will be solved, but they can ensure that evidence is collected
thoroughly. Then they place the case in the hands of the criminal
justice system.</TE>
<TE>   In the clinic, nurse practitioners use a lamp that illuminates
semen on the skin with ultraviolet light and a video colposcope that
magnifies injuries to 16 times their normal size. They also use a
forensic microscope that makes sperm on a slide appear bright yellow
against a blue background.</TE>
<TE>   But the digital photographs may be the most valuable technological
tool because they show extreme detail of lacerations or bruises.</TE>
<TE>   Before the cameras became available, injuries were simply marked
on a piece of paper on a body diagram.</TE>
<TE>   "The forensic ability we have to observe, document and preserve
evidence is really specialized for our setting," said Amie Tishler,
who coordinates the nurse practitioners at the center.</TE>
<TE>   In cases in which victims are reluctant to report the rapes to
authorities, the center still collects the evidence and stores it in
freezers in case they change their minds.</TE>
<TE>   Abarbanel said her center is doing everything possible to make
sure that no more kits are destroyed and that the evidence they send
is analyzed in a timely way.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a simple public safety issue," she said. "Women are being
raped because these kits are not being opened."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>BALTIMORE AT ATLANTA</LD>
<LD>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   The line: Atlanta by 7 1/2</LD>
<TE>   Quick slant: Michael Vick -- you can't stop him, you can only hope
to fine him.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Vick is one of the best things to happen to pro football in
recent years, certainly the best thing to happen to Atlanta Falcon
football. When the NFL should be celebrating the closest thing it has
ever had to Michael Jordan, it instead bogs itself down in petty,
over-officious minutiae: After leading the Falcons to a thrilling,
37-35 victory over the Saints last week, Vick was fined $5,000 for
wearing his white socks too low and $2,500 for tossing a football to
a fan after a touchdown. Such is the lot of being a marked man. This
stuff never happens to Raven quarterbacks.</TE>

<TE>   NEW ENGLAND AT BUFFALO</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Buffalo by 2 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Repeat after me: Never trade a franchise quarterback
within your division.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: How many of you thought New England's trading of Drew
Bledsoe to Buffalo would come back to bite the Patriots this season?
OK, hands down. You too, Tom Brady. Brady hasn't been bad; he's on
pace to throw for 4,000 yards and 30 touchdowns. But he hasn't been
good enough to win a game in his last four tries.</TE>
<TE>   Bledsoe, meanwhile, has been the league's first-half MVP while
leading the Bills to a 5-3 start.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't have to be this way. New England could have traded
Bledsoe to Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Ex-Patriot Leads Dumb Patriots By 2 1/2 Games

<TE>   PHILADELPHIA AT CHICAGO</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 11</TE>
<TE>   The line: Philadelphia by 6 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: With fog lifted, we can see: Bears are really bad.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Much pregame angst in Chicago over this one, to the tune of:
Why can't we get a quarterback like Donovan McNabb? The Bears are 2-5
with the worst pitching rotation in Chicago: Jim Miller (backup
forced into a starter's role), Chris Chandler (backup forced to play
when Miller developed tendinitis; went 0-2 against Lions and Vikings)
and Henry Burris (played last five minutes against Vikings; finished
with a passer rating of 6.9). McNabb, meanwhile, had his second
100-yard rushing game of the season against the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Hope for Bears: If They Keep Losing, Maybe
They Can Draft Leftwich"</TE>

<TE>   PITTSBURGH AT CLEVELAND</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Pittsburgh by 3</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Last chance for Browns.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: It appears the Steelers scrapped Kordell Stewart just in
time. With Tommy Maddox dinking teams into submission, the Steelers
have won their last three -- and if the Browns can't stop them here,
they should keep on rolling through a schedule that has Atlanta,
Tennessee, Cincinnati, Jacksonville, Houston and Carolina neatly
lined up for them. Cleveland is back at .500 after Tim Couch rallied
the Browns from a 21-3 deficit against the Jets last week. That's
right, it's the 4-3 Steelers vs. the 4-4 Browns. In the AFC North,
that's as good as it gets.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Browns Rally Again; Cowher: 'Just a Speed Bump
in the Road' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DALLAS AT DETROIT</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Detroit by 3</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Emmitt has the record that should have been Barry's.
But Detroit isn't bitter.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: How many yards would Barry Sanders have had if he hadn't
decided to take his record run and go home before the 1999 season?
New NFL career rushing leader Emmitt Smith says he thought Sanders
was capable of "not only getting the record but blowing it away and
setting it in the 20,000-yard area." Sunday, Smith brings his record
to Ford Field, flaunting it for all of Detroit to see. When asked if
he thought Detroit would be OK with it, Smith told the Detroit Free
Press, "They have no choice but to be OK with it. People in Detroit
love me too. There are Cowboys fans everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Lions' Victory Not Much of a Consolation
Prize"</TE>

<TE>   CINCINNATI AT HOUSTON</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Houston by 3</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Yes, Houston by 3.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: So it has come to this for the never-say-rock-bottom Bengals
-- they are three-point underdogs to an expansion team. In his latest
desperate attempt to rally his lost causes, Bengal Coach Dick LeBeau
began the week by predicting victory over the seven-game-old Texans.
Fired up, Bengal receiver Chad Johnson went a step further and
guaranteed a victory. Uh-oh. By midweek, LeBeau had taken another
look at his quarterback depth chart, prompting something of a
backtrack: "You would probably be surprised to hear this, but I
predict a victory for us every week." Long story short: Same old same
old.</TE>

Bengal Coach in 2003"</TE>

<TE>   TENNESSEE AT INDIANAPOLIS</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Indianapolis by 3</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Just when you thought it was safe to forget the
Titans.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: No one's out of the race in the AFC (Gone) South. Not the
expansion Texans, who could pull to within a game of first place. Not
the Titans, who were 1-4 and recently talking about a coaching
change. Since then, the Colts have dropped road games at Pittsburgh
and Washington, with Tennessee getting back-to-back 100-yard
performances from Eddie George in wins over Jacksonville and
Cincinnati. A Titan win in Indianapolis would leave the Titans and
Colts tied at 4-4 -- one of them a serious threat to win the division
title at 8-8.</TE>

<TE>   MINNESOTA AT TAMPA BAY</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Tampa Bay by 7</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Jon Gruden? Excitable boy, they all said.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: One week after Arizona's 9-6 overtime win over Dallas set
football back 40 years, Tampa Bay's 12-9 triumph over Carolina
knocked it back another decade. Still, Buccaneer Coach Gruden was
pumped after watching Martin Gramatica save his offense with four
field goals, two longer than 50 yards. Gruden described Gramatica as
"a weapon. He's Barry Bonds. I say it every day. Put the ball down,
protect him and he's going to hit three-run homers." To prove his
point, Gruden tried tossing a few game balls Gramatica's way. You
guessed it. Four wide ones.</TE>

<TE>   NEW YORK JETS AT SAN DIEGO</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 2</TE>
<TE>   The line: San Diego by 7 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Mutiny in the Meadowlands.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: It's all happiness and joy in San Diego, where the Chargers
are doing great things after borrowing the St. Louis-Baltimore-New
England playbook and mounting the NFL's latest, obligatory
worst-to-first campaign. Not so in New Jersey, where the Jets blew a
21-3 lead to Cleveland last week, leaving Coach Herman Edwards to
angrily lash out at media allegations that his 2-5 team has quit.
"You don't quit in sports," Edwards said. "You retire. You don't get
to quit. It's not an option ... When you lose, people start assuming
they quit. Retirement? Yes. Quitting? No."</TE>

<TE>   ST. LOUIS AT ARIZONA</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: St. Louis by 3</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Why Anaheim has a World Series champion but no NFL
team.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: It all began in 1988, when the Cardinals moved to Arizona,
leaving St. Louis without a football team and desperate enough to do
anything to get another, including rolling out the red carpet for
Georgia Frontiere in 1995. So while Orange County fans wring the
stale champagne out of their rally monkeys, they might amuse
themselves by watching their old Rams, sounding very familiar at 2-5,
trying to climb back within one game of the Cardinals in the NFC West
standings. It's Marc Bulger vs. Jake Plummer.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Rams Rally to Win; Michael Eisner on Hand to

<TE>   SAN FRANCISCO AT OAKLAND</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 11</TE>
<TE>   The line: Oakland by 3</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Jerry Rice re-assesses his big career move.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: In 1 1/2 seasons since moving across the Bay, former 49er
Jerry Rice has turned 40 and, frankly, is starting to resemble a
grouchy old man. Last week, after fumbling to set up Kansas City's
winning score, Rice complained he wasn't getting the ball enough.
This prompted an exasperated Raider quarterback Rich Gannon to tell
reporters, "I threw it 55 times today. I think everyone got their
chances.." Meanwhile, the 49ers put Jeff Garcia in the shotgun
against Arizona and Terrell Owens got his 132 yards. Guess who's not
complaining ?</TE>

<TE>   WASHINGTON AT SEATTLE</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Seattle by 2 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Shameless in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: With good soldier Trent Dilfer having taken one too many for
the team -- he's sidelined for the season with a torn Achilles' --
Seahawk Coach Mike Holmgren has decided to share a foxhole with Jeff
George, who was signed this week. Better strategies are out there,
though Holmgren swears it's only to provide "backup sup- port" for
Matt Hasselbeck. The Redskins have been down that road, which is why
Marty Schot- tenheimer is now in San Diego and three quarterbacks not
named George now play for Wash- ington.</TE>

<TE>   MIAMI AT GREEN BAY</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Monday, 6 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 7</TE>
<TE>   The line: Green Bay by 4 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: How Favre is he willing to go to save the streak?</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Green Bay's Brett Favre has started 164 games in a row at
quarterback, an NFL record. He also has a sprained knee that forced
him out of the Packers' Oct. 13 game. With the Packers holding a
four-game lead in the NFC North, some have called for Favre to give
the streak a rest and focus on the big picture -- a possible Super
Bowl for Green Bay. Favre, however, sees the bright Monday night
lights and can't stay away. His streak is different from Cal
Ripken's; Favre has yet to play a game to pad the streak at his
team's expense. On the other hand, Miami starts Ray Lucas.</TE>

<HD>Matsui Not Headed to Dodgers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The best player in Japan, Yomiuri Giant star center fielder Hideki
Matsui, appears headed for the U.S. next season, but don't get your
hopes up, Dodger fans.</LD>
<LD>   Matsui, who declared himself a free agent Thursday, is expected to
sign with the New York Yankees, and the Dodgers, despite their heavy
presence, influence and success in the Pacific Rim, aren't expected
to bid on the 28-year-old slugger.</LD>
<LD>   "We've followed Matsui for more than two years now because of his
pending free agency, and all our scouts believe he's a talented
player who will have success in the major leagues," Dodger General
Manager Dan Evans said.</LD>
<TE>   "But we believe he's a corner outfielder, and with [left fielder]
Brian Jordan and [right fielder] Shawn Green under contract, we don't
anticipate pursuing [Matsui]. At this time, he doesn't fulfill one of
our needs for 2003."</TE>
<TE>   Matsui batted .334 with 50 home runs and 107 runs batted in to
lead the Giants to the Japan Series championship. He came up short in
his bid for the Triple Crown, finishing second in the Central League
in batting and first in homers and RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   Though baseballs are known to carry well in the Tokyo Dome, where
Yomiuri plays its home games, most scouts believe Matsui, who is
nicknamed "Godzilla" and has 332 homers and 889 RBIs in his 10-year
career, has legitimate big league power and will be an impact player
in the major leagues.</TE>
<TE>   Matsui, who throws right-handed and bats left-handed, is expected
to command a multiyear contract in the $8-million-a-year range, a
price the Yankees seem willing to pay, but one the Dodgers, with some
$95 million already committed to 12 players for 2003, can't afford.
Teams cannot discuss financial terms with Matsui until Nov. 12.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Among the players the Dodgers plan to target early in the
free-agent period is veteran reliever Mike Remlinger, a 36-year-old
left-hander who went 7-3 with a 1.99 earned-run average in 73 games
for the Atlanta Braves last season.</TE>
<TE>   Remlinger, who also can spot start, struck out 69 and walked 28 in
68 innings last season, making $2 million in the final year of a
three-year, $5-million contract. Adding Remlinger wouldn't preclude
the Dodgers from re-signing 45-year-old reliever Jesse Orosco, who is
more of a left-handed specialist.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have hired Rene Francisco, 34, from the Braves to
become their director of international scouting, replacing Jeff
Schugel, who will remain as a special assistant to the general
manager and will focus on major league scouting.</TE>
<TE>   Francisco spent 10 years with the Braves, most recently working as
their Latin American coordinator, and was the scout who signed Dodger
pitcher Odalis Perez and Atlanta shortstop Rafael Furcal. The Dodgers
did not retain major league scout Claude Osteen, the former Dodger
pitching coach.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers are close to an agreement with the Kintetsu Buffaloes
to send pitcher Kevin Beirne, who went 2-0 with a 3.41 ERA in 12 big
league appearances last season, to Japan for $500,000. Beirne is
considered a longshot to make the Dodgers next spring.... Derrick
Hall, the Dodgers' senior vice president of communications, was
inducted into Arizona State University's Walter Cronkite School of
Journalism and Mass Communication Alumni Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Senior Vice President and General Manager Brian Sabean agreed in
principle to a multiyear contract to remain with the San Francisco
Giants.... The Chicago Cubs declined their $8.5-million option on
Fred McGriff, making the first baseman eligible for free agency....
The St. Louis Cardinals declined a $6-million option on Andy Benes'
contract, and the right-hander filed for free agency. Also filing for
free agency were Chicago White Sox slugger Frank Thomas and Angel
reserve Alex Ochoa.</TE>

market has crashed. A sampling: "Welcome to the Rotten Apple, where:</LD>

against the Angels.</LD>
<LD>   * "The Mets fired Bobby Valentine but not GM Steve Phillips, who
built The Worst Team Money Can Buy II.</LD>
<TE>   * "The Giants are boring impostors destined for mediocrity. Or
worse. If they can't get into the end zone, they won't win another
game, and Jim Fassel, who was hired to fix the offense, won't
survive."</TE>

to grow for the event after the event is over?</TE>

club invited local farmers to come in and cut the rough away, which
they did, bailing it to be used as feed for their animals.</TE>

better than some of the world's best golfers."</TE>

<TE>   Hot and bothered: Tonya Harding is upset about a new product on
the shelves of some Oregon stores that uses the name and unauthorized
likeness of the disgraced figure skater.</TE>
<TE>   Tonya Hot Sauce features an unflattering caricature of Harding
outside a dumpy trailer, cigarette in mouth, ice skates in one hand,
a hubcap in the other.</TE>
<TE>   "Not for the weak-kneed," reads the label. "Guaranteed to assault
your taste buds. It's a lead-pipe cinch you'll love it."</TE>
<TE>   "I read the papers and think up ideas for a product," said John
Farmer, whose company PDX Hot Lix makes the sauce. "Tonya just keeps
on giving."</TE>
<TE>   Harding doesn't think it's funny and neither does her lawyer. Made

<HD>Pick Six Fraud Is Uncovered</HD>
<DH>Off-track betting executive says man with winning ticket
from Breeders' Cup conspired with employee from tote company.
Employee is fired.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Christine</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a betting scandal that is bound to riddle the confidence of
horseplayers everywhere, a tote company in Delaware fired an employee
Thursday, after which a New York off-track betting executive said
that the dismissed worker conspired with a Baltimore man to engineer
more than $3 million in winnings via the pick-six bet on Breeders'
Cup day last Saturday at Arlington Park.</LD>
<LD>   For racing, a game that has taken a back seat to other sports and
other gambling options, Thursday's developments, following a
weeklong, interstate investigation, were the kind of public-relations
smear that will be difficult to overcome. All of racing's innovative
marketing efforts -- off-track betting, betting by phone and the
Internet, betting from home, getting rich quickly with a single bet
-- have been sabotaged. Caught in the mess is the Breeders' Cup, an
annual series of nationally televised, internationally appealing
races that have been successful since they were introduced in 1984.</LD>
<TE>   It was at last Saturday's Breeders' Cup, in suburban Chicago,
where a barrage of longshot winners resulted in only six winning
ticket combinations in the pick six, a wager that requires a bettor
to select the first-place finishers in six consecutive races. It
turned out that all six winning combinations were purchased on one
ticket costing $1,152 by a 29-year-old man identified as Derrick
Davis, a self-employed computer repairman. On Thursday, Davis was
linked with an unidentified software engineer who works in Newark,
Del., where Autotote Corp., the national leader in processing horse
racing bets, has its hub.</TE>
<TE>   The winning pick six combinations may have been punched into the
system after the first four races were run. The combinations included
the winners of those races, plus all of the horses in the remaining
two races. That betting pattern was what triggered a multi-agency
investigation that included the Breeders' Cup, the National
Thoroughbred Racing Assn., the New York State Racing and Wagering
Board and the Catskill Off-Track Betting Corp. in New York. The
tickets were bought with a newly opened telephone account that Davis
reportedly had with Catskill.</TE>
<TE>   "The tickets were created by a rogue working for the tote
company," said Donald Groth, president of Catskill OTB. "If you said
that the guy with the tote company and [Davis] worked together on
this, that would be a very good assumption. It is also safe to say
that the winning tickets, as they stood last Saturday, will never be
cashed."</TE>
<TE>   Lorne Weil, chairman and chief executive officer of Scientific
Games, Autotote's parent company, said that an internal investigation
led to the dismissal of the Autotote employee. The employee, Weil
said, knew the password that would have enabled him to enter the data
system and alter an existing ticket after the first four races were
run.</TE>
<TE>   Weil said the name of the employee and evidence from the
investigation have been turned over to New York's racing board and
the New York State Police. While no one was saying so, the filing of
criminal charges would seem inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, an elusive figure all week, couldn't be reached Thursday.
In an interview that he gave the New York Post on Wednesday, Davis
tried to explain the rationale behind the horses he bet and said he
was innocent. "They're dragging my name through the mud and saying
that I tapped into the computer system," Davis said. "Man, I just
picked a few horses and got lucky."</TE>
<TE>   Davis bet only one horse in each of the first four races, then
added all eight starters in the Breeders' Cup Turf and all 12 horses
in the Classic. The Classic was won by Volponi, at 43-1 the longest
shot in the race. Volponi's win eliminated all pick-six players
except Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Betting every horse in a field is not uncommon for serious
pick-six players, but "singling" -- betting only one horse -- in
races that were won by 26-1 shot Domedriver and 12-1 Starine sent off
alarms. In particular, Davis was betting against Rock Of Gibraltar,
the 4-5 favorite in the Breeders' Cup Mile. Breaking slowly, Rock Of
Gibraltar was in last place early, before a desperate stretch rally
left him three-quarters of a length short of Domedriver at the wire.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the part of the ticket that caught everybody's
attention," said Chris Scherf, executive vice president of the
Thoroughbred Racing Assns. "How could you bet that race without
having Rock Of Gibraltar on your ticket?"</TE>
<TE>   Once the investigation was launched, payoffs on the pick six were
frozen. Each of Davis' six winning combinations would have been worth
$428,392. To bring his total payoffs to more than $3 million, Davis
was also holding 108 of the 186 consolation payoffs (for five
winners) that were worth $4,606.20 apiece.</TE>
<TE>   Donald Groth, the Catskill executive, said that payoffs would have
to be refigured for the holders of the 78 remaining consolation
payoffs. By one estimate, the return on those consolation tickets
will increase almost tenfold, to about $44,000.</TE>
<TE>   "The integrity of the system wasn't compromised," Groth said.
"It's the integrity of someone with access to the system that was.
We've got to improve on that. We've got to do better."</TE>
<TE>   Weil was hard-pressed to muster a positive spin. "The good news --
if there is any in this situation -- is that our detection system
worked," he said.</TE>

<HD>Claims Filed Over Injury</HD>
<DH>Parents of Gabrielino High player, who has been in a coma
since Oct. 4, allege improper helmet inflation, insufficient medical
attention.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Bresnahan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The family of a San Gabriel Gabrielino High football player who has
been in a coma since sustaining a head injury during a game Oct. 4
has filed claims against two school districts, alleging Andrew
Castillo was injured because his helmet was improperly inflated and
that there was insufficient medical attention provided at the game.</LD>
<LD>   Castillo, a 16-year-old junior, complained of blurred vision,
dizziness and a headache during a timeout in the fourth quarter of a
nonleague game against Burbank at Burbank Burroughs High. He was sent
to the sideline by a coach, collapsed within minutes and has not
regained consciousness.</LD>
<LD>   Teammates said Castillo, who suffered bleeding in the brain, had
complained earlier in the game that he didn't have enough air in his
helmet and that he had headaches. Gabrielino Coach Vince Lopez said
the team usually has an air pump on the sideline during games, but it
could not be located that night.</LD>
<TE>   Castillo's family filed government tort claims, which preclude a
lawsuit brought against government institutions, with San Gabriel
Unified School District and Burbank Unified School District. The
family did not set a monetary value to the claims.</TE>
<TE>   The districts' boards have 45 days to accept or reject the claims.
If the claims are rejected -- a typical outcome -- "the litigation
starts," said Dana McCune, a Los Angeles-based lawyer representing
the San Gabriel school district.</TE>
<TE>   The California Interscholastic Federation, the sanctioning body
for the state's high schools, leaves medical preparedness at
regular-season games under the auspices of the schools and their
districts.</TE>
<TE>   In the playoffs, the CIF mandates licensed physicians along the
sidelines.</TE>
<TE>   "Paramedics were supposed to be there, but they had left to take a
call," said Gary A. Dordick, a Beverly Hills-based attorney hired by
Castillo's parents, Joe Castillo and Maria Garcia. "In this case, the
problem is the complete lack of any medical attention during the
game.... It doesn't appear they had anyone there looking out for the
kids."</TE>
<TE>   The claims also state that Castillo, who started at fullback and
linebacker, suffered a serious blow earlier in the game but was not
taken out despite complaining of headaches. Lopez said coaches
decided at halftime to use Castillo only on defense. Lopez also said
Castillo did not make the primary hit on any of the tackles that
directly preceded him leaving the game.</TE>
<TE>   "There is at least one significant impact where he's airborne
[earlier in the game]," Dordick said. "He was complaining of head
pain and dizziness throughout the majority of the game, from the
second quarter on. When you have players who are showing obvious
signs of a head injury, you should have medical personnel check them
before they go back into the game."</TE>
<TE>   The San Gabriel school district has begun an investigation into
Castillo's injury that has included interviews with players and
coaches.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation will range from "the equipment, including but
not limited to the helmet, to technique, to preexisting health
issues," McCune said.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo's parents do not know of any preexisting medical
conditions that may have contributed to the player's injuries,
Dordick said.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo was taken from the field to Providence Holy Cross Medical
Center in Mission Hills, where he has undergone two surgeries to
remove blood clots in his brain and another surgery to remove a clot
in his leg. His condition was recently upgraded from critical to
serious.</TE>

<KH>LAKERS VS. CLIPPERS Tonight at Staples Center 7:30, Channel 9</KH>
<HD>Struggling Teams Test Their Zero Tolerance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After consecutive wearying late-night flights, two dreadful
basketball games, two sprained ankles and the odd swipe at Bill
Walton, the Lakers reported Thursday morning to El Segundo, worrying
first about Kobe Bryant's right ankle and second about their first
week of basketball.</LD>
<LD>   The rap music bounded through their gym at 11:30, followed by the
sounds of basketballs and sneakers, Bryant's among them, and then
Coach Phil Jackson's voice.</LD>
<LD>   The dreary basketball will be fixed, presumably, the moment
Shaquille O'Neal retakes the floor for good, and he raised spirits
Thursday by participating in a light scrimmage. Bryant's ankle might
not be so easily cured, though he did practice and the Lakers were
reasonably sure he'd play tonight against the Clippers at Staples
Center.</LD>
<TE>   Not far from El Segundo, at L.A. Southwest College, the Clippers
mulled 27 minutes and no points from Elton Brand the previous night,
along with various other opening-night mysteries. Coach Alvin Gentry
and a dozen or so players, all with a loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers
to bear, and the Lakers ahead, practiced long and hard, sweating out
the Zydrunas Ilgauskas shot that had beaten them the night before.</TE>
<TE>   So begins basketball season in Los Angeles, the 0-2 Lakers being
the only thing standing between last place and the 0-1 Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   And although no one expected a seamless early season from the
Lakers, playing without the NBA's most ferocious player, neither did
anyone figure on 0-2 looking like this. A defending champion hadn't
opened the season 0-2 since the Seattle SuperSonics 23 years ago, and
hasn't opened 0-3 since 1969, when the Boston Celtics started 0-4.</TE>
<TE>   And although no one expected perfection from the Clippers after a
summer that left Michael Olowokandi and Brand without contract
extensions, neither did they assume a home loss to the Cavaliers with
1,000 empty seats at Staples Center. What exactly happened to "Love
it Live?"</TE>
<TE>   "It's a loss," Gentry said. "It's a home loss. It's a long way
from being the end of the world."</TE>
<TE>   It's at least 81 games from there.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers summoned similar perspective, a simple task, given that
their newest championship rings haven't even come back from the
appraiser yet.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, we lost two games," Bryant said. "It isn't that
tragic.... It definitely hurts, but we have to keep our minds on the
big picture."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant has assumed the brunt of the Lakers' scoring, averaging 26
points.</TE>
<TE>   As usual, and particularly when O'Neal isn't on the floor, he has
played in the gray area between shooting because they need him to and
shooting because he feels he must. Either way, no one finds it
unreasonable. When he shot 29 times against the Spurs, Bryant
admitted 29 were too many, and Jackson coolly surmised that Bryant
did what he'd felt he must. It speaks to Jackson's trust in him, a
relatively new development.</TE>
<TE>   Slava Medvedenko is the only Laker other than Bryant to have
scored in double figures in both games, and he had six of his 15 in
the fourth quarter of Wednesday's blowout in Portland. Derek Fisher
has shot three for 17, Devean George is five for 16, and Robert Horry
is seven for 19, all at a time when the Lakers could have used the
extra offense from their veterans.</TE>
<TE>   In two games, the Lakers have committed 37 turnovers, been
outrebounded, 98-89, have scored 21 or fewer points in five of eight
quarters, and have shot 47 free throws to their opponents' 76.</TE>
<TE>   So they cling to Bryant, which probably is why they folded in his
brief absence against the Trail Blazers, upon finding themselves
suddenly without him or O'Neal. It was not a complete surprise, given
that players new to the Lakers -- Soumaila Samake, Tracy Murray,
Jannero Pargo and Kareem Rush -- have accounted for nearly 100
minutes, of a possible 480, and O'Neal has accounted for none.</TE>
<TE>   "Actually, we're playing better than I thought we might play,"
Jackson said. "We're competing. Guys are playing hard. If we shot
anything like we feel a good team should, we'd be 1-1. That's ifs. We
have to do that now on the court."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal could be only a few games from returning, perhaps a week
away. A difficult early schedule persists, however, with Portland on
Sunday and an early trip East, through Cleveland, Boston and
Washington, after tonight's game. The Lakers haven't been 0-3 since
1978.</TE>
<TE>   But no one's thinking about that.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just trying to get ready, basically, for basketball,"
Jackson said.</TE>

<HD>Winner With Andre</HD>
<DH>In Miller, Clippers feel they have point guard to take them
to next level -- the playoffs</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Andre Miller is not shy; he's guarded. He is not aloof; he's polite.
He's not fiery; he's cool. He's not a talker; he's a doer. He's not a
shooter; he's a passer. He owns an expensive SUV; he drives his
mother's late-model Honda.</LD>
<LD>   Now that's old school.</LD>
<LD>   Or as Marko Jaric, a Yugoslav who played the last four seasons in
Italy, said of his new Clipper teammate, "Andre is an unselfish
player. He is unusual for an American point guard. He's a very smart
guy. Very unselfish. Very clever. He doesn't care if he scores 30
points or two points."</LD>
<TE>   Miller, 26, made his Clipper debut Wednesday against the Cleveland
Cavaliers, his former team, scoring 15 points and adding 14 assists.
It was a homecoming eight years in the waiting. Tonight, he faces the
Lakers, the three-time NBA champions, the team he admired most while
growing up in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm home," he said. "For the first time in eight years, I'm on
the home team at home. I'm looking forward to it."</TE>
<TE>   His task is not simple.</TE>
<TE>   Miller is used to facing difficult (impossible?) challenges.
Turning the Clippers into a cohesive unit capable of winning, say, 50
games is only the latest one.</TE>
<TE>   He grew up in Watts, a 10-minute drive from the Clippers' practice
facility at Los Angeles Southwest College. He graduated from Verbum
Dei High after leading the school to a 29-3 record and a Southern
Section championship as a senior in 1993-94. He went to Utah, but had
to sit out one season because he did not qualify under NCAA academic
guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   Like a lot of Southern Californians, Miller grew up watching Magic
Johnson and the "Showtime" Lakers. He had other sports idols too. He
also played football in high school, earning league most valuable
player honors as a quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   Basketball was Miller's ticket to college, although few could have
predicted greatness for him.</TE>
<TE>   "He was overweight when he came to the University of Utah," said
Ute Coach Rick Majerus, who knows a thing or two about overweight.
"He was pudgy bordering on fat."</TE>
<TE>   It didn't take long, though, for Miller to win over Majerus.</TE>
<TE>   "He's an old-time player," Majerus said. "He's the kind of guy who
likes to play on the playground. He goes looking for a game. Usually,
Southern California kids have to have an open gym. They won't play
unless they have multicolored uniforms and referees. He just likes to
play.</TE>
<TE>   "He defines himself as a basketball player. He loves ball. He
would go find games. On off days, I had to tell him, 'Andre, if I
wanted you to work out, I would work you out myself.' He has a
special quality. He played cards. He played golf. I took the guys
horseback riding, bowling. He tried all that stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Between Majerus and Andrea Robinson, Miller's mother, the young
man had a support system that ensured his success at Utah. Robinson
was Miller's biggest fan, rarely missing a game -- home or away. She
once traveled to Dallas by bus from Los Angeles to see the Utes play
in two NCAA tournament games.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked a buddy of mine who had a private plane to take her back
to L.A.," Majerus said. "We asked the NCAA if we could do it if she
paid a fare. The NCAA said no. I remember she walked right off the
bus and went right to work Monday morning."</TE>
<TE>   Miller graduated with a degree in sociology in 1998. The Cavaliers
selected him eighth overall in the 1999 draft. Robinson made the
L.A.-to-Cleveland trip by bus at least once.</TE>
<TE>   During an interview last week, Miller was uncomfortable speaking
about his relationships with Majerus and his mother. He twisted in
his chair, intently watching while teammates lingered after practice
to work on their jump shots. He asked that a reporter not contact his
mother.</TE>
<TE>   "She's got some issues right now," Miller said. "Maybe give it two
weeks, OK?"</TE>
<TE>   You see, Albert Robinson, Miller's stepfather, has cancer and the
prognosis isn't good. Miller, who lost an older brother to an illness
several years ago, doesn't wish to speak about his stepfather's
condition.</TE>
<TE>   "He can be guarded," Majerus said. "He can be tough to get to
know. I love the guy. I love him for the person he is. He's good to
his mom and his stepfather. He's more Stockton than Malone. He
doesn't find the camera. He's never going to be on the NBA
all-interview team. That coach is fortunate to have him. He'll make
[Elton] Brand and those guys better players."</TE>
<TE>   It's already happened, according to Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't do him justice with all the things they said about
him," Gentry said of Miller. "He's a much better leader than we
thought he would be. He's quiet off the floor. He talks on the floor.
Guys like him very seldom fail. He leads by example. He's got an SUV,
but he never drives it. He says it's too fast for him. Material
things mean very little to him. Being a great, great player drives
him the most, I think."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers sought an upgrade at point guard after Jeff McInnis
had helped them to a 39-43 record and the brink of a playoff spot
last season with a street-wise attitude that often grated on the
nerves of teammates and the coaching staff.</TE>
<TE>   Clipper brass decided the team needed a different point man, one
with less flash and more substance, less talk and more action. They
wanted a team player like Miller to take them to the playoffs for the
first time since 1996-97.</TE>
<TE>   It's why the Clippers gave up Darius Miles, 20, a frequent flier
with what appears to be unlimited potential, to get an earth-bound
Miller from the Cavaliers on July 30. Several hoop know-it-alls
proclaimed the trade a bad one for the Clippers, wailing that Miles
may soon rocket through the stratosphere as the NBA's latest,
greatest.</TE>
<TE>   These Clippers, long on potential but short on results, couldn't
be happier with Miller running what still figures to be one of the
league's best rim-rattling dunk shows.</TE>
<TE>   Only now, when they need a play, when they need an important
basket or a well-timed assist, they can put the ball in Miller's
hands and watch him work his magic.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't magic to Miller. It's just ball.</TE>
<TE>   "I've watched a lot of basketball, a lot of team basketball,"
Miller said. "I'm not going to say unselfish play has been forgotten,
but society wants to see a person who can put the ball in the basket
a lot. It's hard to really understand basketball. It looks simple,
just putting the ball in the hoop. But there's also the Xs and O's
part of it."</TE>
<TE>   Last season, his third with the Cavaliers, Miller led the NBA with
an average of 10.9 assists. He also averaged 16.5 points, 4.7
rebounds and 37.3 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   McInnis averaged 14.6 points for the Clippers last season, but
only 6.2 assists. It was that lopsided ratio that got the Clippers
thinking they could do better, particularly since McInnis would be an
unrestricted free agent. There also was the matter of McInnis'
personality clash with Gentry and many of his teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, maybe Alvin can get in a word or two during timeouts," one
team official whispered on the day the Clippers announced they had
completed the deal for Miller. McInnis then signed with the Portland
Trail Blazers.</TE>
<TE>   "A coach has to trust his point guard," said Dennis Johnson, a
Clipper assistant and a former guard with the Boston Celtic teams
that badgered and occasionally bested the Lakers throughout the
1980s. "A team gets a lot of confidence if the coach is confident
with his point guard. He runs everything. If Alvin doesn't have to
call all the plays, we'll have more of a free-flowing offense. We've
got guys who can really run. If he can get two more assists a
game.... "</TE>
<TE>   Johnson trailed off with a low whistle.</TE>
<TE>   Mo McHone, another of Gentry's assistants, quickly added of
Miller, "He adds such a calmness."</TE>
<TE>   Eric Piatkowski, a shooting guard who has spent all nine of his
pro seasons with the Clippers, picked up on that theme.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing bothers him," he said of Miller. "I want the ball in his
hands. I'll do what I do. Other guys aren't going to wonder [in
crunch time] what's going to happen. Because of the point guard
situation, I'm twice as good a player as I was last year."</TE>
<TE>   Added power forward Brand, "Make sure you run the floor because
he'll find you. He's definitely subdued. It's definitely different
from last year. I don't want to knock Jeff because his fire got us
over the hump sometimes last year. Andre is not real vocal, but he
leads by example. If you're open, the ball will find you.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great for everybody."</TE>

<LD>Put up enough money and they will come.</LD>
<LD>   When Perris Auto Speedway and Temecula Valley Pipe and Supply
announced a record $100,000 purse for the Budweiser Oval Nationals,
part of the Non-Wing Sprint Car championships, entries began pouring
in from nearly every sprint car driver of note in the country. The
entry reads like a Who's Who of sprint car racing.</LD>
<LD>   The 100-lap race, a marathon for the dirt-throwing, 1,250 pound
sprinters that put out an eye-popping 830 horsepower from
410-cubic-inch aluminum engines, is scheduled for Saturday night on
the half-mile clay oval. Tonight there will be qualifying and a
20-lap main event. Saturday night's winner will collect $30,000.</LD>
<TE>   Tracy Hines, newly crowned U.S. Auto Club sprint car champion, and
J.J. Yeley, USAC Silver Crown champion, head a group of invaders who
will challenge Sprint Car Racing Assn. drivers, whose home track is
Perris.</TE>
<TE>   "There's something about Perris that makes it a little harder to
figure out than most tracks," said Richard "the Gas Man" Griffin, who
recently clinched his fourth SCRA championship and is the Non-Wing
Sprint Car series leader. "I think that may give the guys who run
there all year an advantage."</TE>
<TE>   Griffin has won seven races this season, but only one at Perris.</TE>
<TE>   "For some reason, Perris doesn't favor us," he said. "We do better
at other tracks, but this being 100 laps, it's going to be different
for everyone. Because 100-lap races are very rare, tires will become
an issue in the last 50 miles, especially when the track gets drier.
Sprint cars just aren't used to running that long."</TE>
<TE>   Most races are 40 to 50 laps. The Oval Nationals will consist of
two 50-lap segments with a 20-minute halftime, when crews can make
changes to their cars.</TE>
<TE>   Hines, from Greenfield, Ind., will be driving Andy Morales'
legendary Tamale Wagon in hopes of adding to his collection of
victories, which includes the 2000 Silver Crown title.</TE>
<TE>   Yeley, although he competed mostly in the Midwest, is familiar
with the Perris track. He won the SCRA's opening race there last
February. The Phoenix driver won seven USAC sprint car races this
year, among them the season finale at Terre Haute, Ind., and fell
only 13 points short of repeating his 2001 championship.</TE>
<TE>   Bud Kaeding, the Northern California champion from Campbell, is
defending Oval Nationals champion. He won last year after dueling
with his father, Brent, who finished third behind his son and 2000
Oval Nationals winner Tony Jones of Garden Grove. The younger Kaeding
was injured last May at Terre Haute, but came back to win a two-day
competition at Lakeside Speedway in Kansas City.</TE>
<TE>   Two other contenders with ties to Perris are Cory Kruseman, the
2001 SCRA champion from Ventura, and Jay Drake, former USAC Western
States midget champion from Val Verde. Kruseman won two races earlier
in the year at Perris before passing his IRL driver's test and
driving his first IRL race at Texas Motor Speeday. Drake, who won his
first SCRA race at Perris in 1998, suffered a broken left arm and two
broken collarbones in a midget racing accident a year ago. He came
back this year to win the 4-Crown Nationals sprint race at Eldora
Speedway in Rossburg, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   The Oval Nationals will be the next-to-last round of Ron Shuman's
non-wing series. The final race will be Nov. 9 at Manzanita Speedway
in Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Naylor, celebrating 25 years as promoter of Ventura Raceway,
will be grand marshal for the Perris event. Ventura ended its season
last week.</TE>
<TE>   Da Matta No. 1</TE>
<TE>   Tradition in motor sports is for a champion to have No. 1 on his
car the following year. Cristiano da Matta has broken with tradition.
The pint-sized Brazilian driver, who clinched the CART championship
several races ago, has exchanged his No. 6 on the Newman-Haas
Lola-Toyota for No. 1 in the remaining races this year, including
Sunday's Toyota 500 at California Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   "All of the times I have won championships before, I have moved up
to another series the next year so I never actually got to run No. 1
on my car," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Does that mean Da Matta is moving up to Formula One next year with
Toyota? Probably.</TE>
<TE>   One thing CART backers can count on, he will not be defecting to
the rival Indy Racing League.</TE>
<TE>   "I would go back to Brazil and race bicycles rather than racing
IRL," he said. "An all oval racing series is not for me."</TE>
<TE>   Remembering Roy</TE>
<TE>   It has been 14 years since Riverside International Raceway closed
and 19 since Roy Hord was its vice president and general manager, but
those of us who were around for his 18 years at Riverside will never
forget the way he kept the track alive.</TE>
<TE>   Les Richter was the front man, making the speeches and directing
operations, but it was Hord, in the background, who attended to the
day-to-day grind. Without him, Riverside would never have attained
its reputation as one of the world's most prestigious road-racing
courses.</TE>
<TE>   A former professional football player, Hord died last week at 67
and friends will gather today at Calvary Presbyterian Hospital in
Riverside to remember one of the truly fine men of motor racing.</TE>
<TE>   Last Laps</TE>
<TE>   National and former world speedway motorcycle champion Billy
Hamill will ride in Costa Mesa Raceway's season-ending Fall Classic
on the tiny Orange County Fairgrounds oval Saturday night. Hamill
recently won both the AMA Nationals at Auburn, Calif., and the U.S.
Nationals at Costa Mesa. Also on the program will be high-flying
freestyle MX jumpers.</TE>
<TE>   Among the entries in the SCORE Baja 1000 on Nov. 22-23 are Winston
Cup driver Robby Gordon, a former winner; CART champ car driver Jimmy
Vasser, Craftsman Truck driver Brendan Gaughan, and former Indy car
drivers Mike and Robbie Groff. The 1,017-mile race begins in Ensenada
and ends in La Paz.</TE>
<TE>   To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the National Hot Rod Assn.,
the Peterson Automotive Museum will host "The Golden Years of Drag
Racing" exhibit Saturday night with a special salute to Wally Parks,
the NHRA's founder. The tribute will include an exhibition of famous
cars, appearances by legendary drivers and a film of drag racing
highlights. Admission, which includes a buffet dinner and parking, is
$65. Details: Susan Garcia at (323) 964-6359.</TE>
<TE>   Danny Ongais, the Flyin' Hawaiian who won the 1979 Rolex 24 at
Daytona with Ted Field and Hurley Haywood, will drive in the
three-hour Grand American Finale at Daytona on Nov. 10.... Stanton
Barrett, second generation stunt man and stock car driver, will drive
Jack Roush's No. 60 Busch Grand National car next year, replacing
Greg Biffle, who is moving up to Winston Cup.</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath of Nolan White's death while chasing the world
land-speed record for piston engine vehicles, it was overlooked that
White's longtime competitor, Al Teague, set an FIA record for Class A
blown dragsters of 405.976 mph during the same speed runs at Utah's
Bonneville Salt Flats. It was White's record that he broke. Teague
also holds the AA blown record of 409.986.</TE>
<TE>   John Lingenfelter, whose Chevrolet Cavalier went out of control
and crashed during last Sunday's Mazda NHRA Sport Compact World
Finals at Pomona, remains hospitalized after undergoing surgery at
Pomona Valley Hospital. "John is still sedated, but he's moving all
of his limbs, he's opened his eyes, and he's ready to wake up as soon
as he comes out of sedation," said the team's Brent Malone.</TE>

<HD>Eligibility Standards Are Raised</HD>
<DH>NCAA approves measure that affects current high school
seniors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Terry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first wave of academic and eligibility reforms sought by college
and university presidents was approved Thursday by the NCAA Division
I Board of Directors at a meeting in Indianapolis.</LD>
<LD>   The proposals take effect Aug. 1, 2003 and will apply to current
high school seniors.</LD>
<LD>   For initial freshman eligibility, the number of required core
courses needed to enter college was raised from 13 to 14. (Raising
the core class total to 16 will be considered after further study). A
2.0 grade-point average in those core courses will continue to be
required. And the sliding-scale relationship between standardized
test scores and core-course GPA will be extended by eliminating the
minimum test score currently in place.</LD>
<TE>   "It's all about graduation rates," said Rich Herczog, UCLA's
compliance director. "There have been lots of studies to determine
the profile of who succeeds as student-athletes. An additional core
course means a great deal. Core courses coming out of high school are
the best predictor of success in college."</TE>
<TE>   For continuing eligibility, the minimum percentage of degree
requirements for student-athletes to remain eligible was increased.
At present student athletes must complete 25% of their degree work
after two years, 50% after three years, and 75% after four years.
Under the new legislation those numbers are 40%, 60% and 80%.</TE>
<TE>   "If you continue to meet it, you will graduate," said Robert
Hemenway, board chairman and chancellor of the University of Kansas.
"If you don't fit the model, you won't be participating in college
sports."</TE>
<TE>   Also, a student athlete must complete at least 24 hours of
academic credit as he or she enters the second year of enrollment.</TE>
<TE>   The NCAA Management Council had sought to give the NCAA punitive
powers for athletic departments whose athletes were not meeting the
standards of progression. Among those powers are the ability to take
away scholarships, or ban teams from television or postseason
appearances.</TE>
<TE>   "That issue lacks definition," said David Berst, NCAA Division I
chief of staff. "We're probably staring at another year of
negotiations before it is ready for a vote."</TE>
<TE>   Even though NCAA presidents have sought reforms for years, this
was the first academic reform package brought before the board since
it became the NCAA's ruling body on legislation after the
restructuring of institution's voting process in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   An NCAA executive committee, chaired by University of Oregon
President Dave Frohnmayer, spent two years developing the package. It
was presented to the Management Council on Oct. 21, which made some
minor changes before bringing it to the board of directors for
Thursday's vote.</TE>
<TE>   "The only question is going to be over cutting the SAT scores,"
said Tom Hansen, the Pacific 10 Conference commissioner.</TE>

<HD>Hit Costs $50,000 for Eagles' Dawkins</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Philadelphia Eagle All-Pro safety Brian Dawkins was fined $50,000
Thursday for a hit that ended the season for New York Giant receiver
Ike Hilliard.</LD>
<LD>   The play came in the third quarter of Philadelphia's 17-3 victory
Monday night. After a pass went over Hilliard's head, Dawkins leveled
him with a hit to the chest, separating the receiver's shoulder.</LD>
<LD>   The league has re-emphasized its policy this week against
helmet-to-helmet and other dangerous hits. On Wednesday, Dallas
safety Darren Woodson was fined $75,000 for a hit on Seattle's
Darrell Jackson last Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   Dawkins insists his hit was clean.</TE>
<TE>   "I know my intent on that play," Dawkins said. "It was a
split-second thing. It's real hard to just make yourself stop in the
middle of a full-out sprint. I'm not a dirty player by no sense of
the imagination. It's one of those things that happened."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Willie Jackson signed with the Washington Redskins, giving Coach
Steve Spurrier another ex-Florida receiver.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson was waived Monday by Atlanta after he complained he wasn't
getting the ball enough. Jackson was the Falcons' third-leading
receiver with 18 catches for 199 yards.</TE>
<TE>   To make room for Jackson, the Redskins released Kevin Lockett.
Lockett took a pay cut to stay with the team this season and started
two games, but he had not played since a costly fumble at Green Bay
two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   The Redskins were interested in Jackson during the off-season when
he was a free agent, but he signed a three-year, $3.5 million
contract with the Falcons. Jackson set career highs with 81
receptions for 1,046 yards last year with the Saints.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee Titan running back Eddie George practiced Thursday and
had no swelling in his left knee and ankle, even though the Titans
officially listed him as questionable for Sunday's game with
Indianapolis. Team medical personnel said George had a mild ligament
sprain.... New York Giant Coach Jim Fassel will call the plays
Sunday, taking over the job from offensive coordinator Sean Payton.
The change was made because the Giants (3-4) have scored seven
offensive touchdowns in seven games.... Chicago Bear quarterback Jim
Miller, who hasn't started the past two weeks because of a sore
shoulder and elbow, practiced for a second straight day and Coach
Dick Jauron said he anticipated Miller would start Sunday....
Pittsburgh Steeler wide receiver Plaxico Burress was fined $5,000 by
the NFL for an on-field tantrum caused when the Ravens' James Trapp
yanked off his helmet Sunday. The fine was automatic because Burress
was ejected following a fight.</TE>

<HD>Cities Making Final Pitches</HD>
<DH>USOC officials will decide Saturday if New York or San
Francisco will be U.S. candidate for 2012 Olympics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alan Abrahamson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last Friday, in one of those only-in-New York moments, at the corner
of 60th Street and Lexington Avenue in Manhattan, the NYU dance team
pranced and cheered as Bloomingdale's unveiled a corner window
dedicated to the proposition that New York ought to stage the 2012
Olympic Games.</LD>
<LD>   Across the country the next day, boosters of San Francisco's bid
to play host to the 2012 Games unfurled a giant U.S. flag at halftime
of San Jose State's homecoming game. Up in the city itself,
meanwhile, San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown delivered an Olympic pep
talk and a would-be Olympic boxer talked about making the Games.
Across the bay, at Jack London Square in Oakland, two rowers from the
2000 U.S. team in Sydney put on a show.</LD>
<LD>   Saturday, the kitsch comes to an abrupt end for either New York or
San Francisco. The U.S. Olympic Committee will choose one to become
the sole U.S. candidate for 2012. The winner is expected to compete
against Moscow and perhaps Toronto and Paris, as well as candidates
from Germany, Spain and elsewhere.</LD>
<TE>   The two finalists were left after Los Angeles and five other
cities were eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   New York, the U.S. front-runner, has never staged the Olympic
Games. It has the 13th-largest economy in the world, and of the top
15, according to bid documents, only New York, India and Brazil have
never been selected to play host to the Games. A San Francisco
Olympics would be the fourth in California. Los Angeles staged the
1932 and 1984 Summer Games, and Squaw Valley the 1960 Winter Games.</TE>
<TE>   Either city will face stiff odds when the International Olympic
Committee votes, and a number of Olympic observers say U.S. chances
probably will be better in 2016 than 2012. The USOC, heavily reliant
on a domestic Games to boost revenue, wants the Games back in this
country as soon as possible, and 2012 is the first possibility.</TE>
<TE>   The USOC, however, will have picked its 2012 candidate before the
IOC's selection next year of the site of the 2010 Winter Games.
Vancouver and Salzburg, Austria, are the primary contenders. A
Vancouver victory would significantly complicate U.S. chances in
2012, since the IOC prefers to move the Games around various
continents.</TE>
<TE>   Recent history also is working against U.S. chances for 2012. The
Games have been staged in this nation four times since 1980, most
recently in Salt Lake City last February.</TE>
<TE>   The IOC will award the 2012 Games in 2005. At issue Saturday at
the USOC's meeting in Colorado Springs, Colo., are dramatically
different ideas of how to run an Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco's bid, for instance, calls for events all around the
Bay Area. New York has a compact plan, with virtually all venues in
the city.</TE>
<TE>   A visitor with a hotel room near Union Square in San Francisco
would have to go to Berkeley to see beach volleyball, or to Palo Alto
to see swimming or track and field -- or, for that matter, the
opening and closing ceremonies, at Stanford Stadium. The equestrian
venue would be near Monterey, rowing near Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco's bid does not call for much new construction, since
80% of its venues are in place. New York's bid calls for significant
building, in particular, construction of the Olympic village near the
United Nations and a stadium on Manhattan's West Side.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco would also need to build the Olympic village, at
Moffett Field, according to the bid. It's not clear, however, that
the former Naval air base is available. If a village can't be put
there, precisely where the housing would go, and whether the land
would suddenly command a premium, remain uncertain -- perhaps threats
to San Francisco's depiction of its bid as financially low risk.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco's overall strategy is premised on a number of hedge
bets.</TE>
<TE>   Bid leaders have heavily promoted the San Francisco 2012 venture
as in line with repeated calls from IOC President Jacques Rogge to
downsize the Games. But there's no evidence that the IOC equates low
construction costs with a winning bid.</TE>
<TE>   To the contrary, capital costs in Athens, site of the 2004 Games,
are projected at $4 billion; in Beijing, host of the 2008 Games,
infrastructure investment is expected to total $30 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about downsizing during a conference call this week, Rogge
did not say construction costs needed to be slashed. He said, "We
want venues to be in tune with what a city needs after the Games."</TE>
<TE>   Another major component in the San Francisco plan involves a
projected $400 million surplus. Of that, $140 million would be given
to the 28 U.S. national governing bodies, $5 million to each.</TE>
<TE>   Why that might appeal to the USOC is evident. Not clear is how
such a plan would help internationally. The U.S. team is already
dominant at the Summer Games. Asked why the IOC would want to support
a plan to enhance prospects for the American team, Anne Cribbs, the
head of the San Francisco bid, said, "That's a good point."</TE>
<TE>   She paused, then said, "The quick answer is, and this is probably
not the right answer, we have to focus on becoming the U.S. candidate
city."</TE>
<TE>   Long-term, according to USOC leaders, the focus has to be on which
city can win internationally.</TE>
<TE>   Several insiders said that although San Francisco is beautiful,
beauty isn't everything and New York would appear to have an
advantage.</TE>
<TE>   They cited high-level connections in corporate, financial,
governmental, diplomatic and Olympic circles as well as perhaps the
most important factor of all -- the "story" of New York, a city built
and sustained by immigrants, and the show of communal values and
capabilities so readily on display since the Sept. 11, 2001,
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   A city's story is critical. Athens won the 2004 Games on the lure
of a return to the home of the ancient Games and core Olympic values.
Beijing won the 2008 Summer Olympics on the potential of bringing
those values to one of every five people on earth -- the population
of China.</TE>
<TE>   Rogge suggested this week that New York would not benefit from
post-9/11 sympathy.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Doctoroff, New York's deputy mayor and the bid chief, said,
"We always say we don't want any sympathy for 9/11. What we also say
is that the world now sees, certainly the rest of America now sees,
New York in a very different light, post-9/11. The values and traits
New York exhibited -- courage, teamwork, resiliency, the ability to
pick oneself up, patriotism -- those are exactly the Olympic values."</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to the USOC board, former New York mayor Rudolph
Giuliani put it this way:</TE>
<TE>   "The question is not just which city has the best chance of
bringing the Olympic Games back to the United States. Perhaps the
more important questions are which city symbolizes the world's hopes
and dreams? Which city has proven that it can meet and beat whatever
challenges it faces? Which city will benefit more from the
opportunity to rebuild better than it was before? Which city will
best be able to welcome the world with open arms?</TE>
<TE>   "Finally, which city will not only highlight the deeper meaning of
the Olympics, but also hand the 2012 Games into history as an
enduring symbol of the best of humanity united, working side by side,
as one."</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani is expected to speak Saturday. So are the current mayor,
Michael Bloomberg, and others who will underscore New York's star
power. Even some representing San Francisco have said the Northern
California bid is an underdog.</TE>
<TE>   Cribbs, however, said she remained "quietly confident." An Olympic
swimmer at the 1960 Games in Rome, Cribbs said, "You swim your own
race."</TE>

<HD>Sportfishing Owners Plan to Fight Back</HD>

<AU>PETE THOMAS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like baseball, sportfishing is a national pastime. It gets in your
blood. But if we don't get people involved it'll literally become a
pastime -- as in past tense.</LD>
<LD>   These are the words of Greg Watson, 25, captain of the Sea Angler,
a half-day boat that runs from San Pedro's 22nd Street Landing, one
of the oldest and most popular sportfishing ports on the coast.</LD>
<LD>   Watson rose through the ranks much as baseball players do, and as
most skippers do.</LD>
<TE>   He spent his childhood summers and weekends working as a
"pinhead," doing menial chores for no money, simply to be on the
water as part of the crew -- and do some fishing if time permitted.</TE>
<TE>   When he was old enough, he became a deckhand, working hands-on
with customers -- and getting paid for it.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, he obtained his captain's license. He was in charge of
his own vessel and on top of the world.</TE>
<TE>   But now Watson believes that his world is crumbling under the
weight of mounting restrictions and unreasonable closures. Government
agencies, environmental groups and politicians, citing a fishery in
peril and armed with "the best available science" he neither
understands nor agrees with, are threatening his livelihood.</TE>
<TE>   Ask any captain in any California port and you'll get the same
general response.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Strunk, 33, owner of the 65-foot vessel Pierpoint out of
Pierpoint Landing in Long Beach, has spent the last several months
building a new and larger boat designed "to give the fishermen a
really nice platform to fish from."</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, he questions his investment. "When I first
started building my boat people said I was out of my mind," he says.
"I just laughed at them, but now I'm beginning to realize that there
was something to what they said."</TE>
<TE>   Watson and Strunk are among dozens of party-boat skippers and
perhaps hundreds of private boaters expected to take part in a
massive on-the-water protest Sunday against what they consider overly
extreme measures designed to protect several species of rockfish and
other bottom fishes, notably bocaccio, deemed overfished by state and
federal agencies.</TE>
<TE>   For the fishermen, reality checks have been rolling in like waves
during the last couple of years. They have come, despite vehement
protests, in the form of seasonal closures and restrictions on depth
in which they can fish.</TE>
<TE>   And last week came perhaps the biggest reality check to date. The
California Fish and Game Commission, at its meeting in Santa Barbara,
announced that fishing will be permanently banned in 175 square miles
of ocean surrounding the Channel Islands. The news, though not
entirely unexpected, tipped the recreational fishing community on its
side and spilled out all sorts of raw emotions.</TE>
<TE>   "This is only the tip of the iceberg," said Norris Tapp, co-owner
of Davey's Locker in Newport Beach, referring to other no-fishing
zones and conservation areas being considered by Fish and Game
officials. "Something has got to be done to stop the madness."</TE>
<TE>   The madness, if it can be called that, was not confined to the
meeting halls. Fishermen this week might as well have called for the
head of Gov. Gray Davis and his appointees on the commission, whom
they accuse of catering to environmental interests purely to further
their own careers.</TE>
<TE>   Radio chatter between captains -- those who have been maintaining
all along that the studies are flawed; that there are more bocaccio
now, in Southern California anyway, than there have been in years --
turned from bitter to downright angry.</TE>
<TE>   Having lost faith in state and national groups lobbying on their
behalf, they became compelled to do something dramatic to bring
attention to their cause -- and do it before next week's election.</TE>
<TE>   They organized a massive blockade of container ships coming into
L.A. and Long Beach harbors -- the same ports affected by the recent
labor dispute that brought shipping to a halt. It was a scary
proposition, but one supported not only by several captains and crew
members, but some of their bosses.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Oefinger, owner of Marina del Rey Sportfishing, was not
behind the plan. But neither did he argue against it. In a letter
issued to owners of boats running from his port, he said, "The
landing expects that any boat with a regularly scheduled run on
Blockade Day will be on line for their run. Any boat not on line that
day should feel free to participate if they so desire. If one does
participate, I'll caution you to keep in mind the consequences of
violating the 'rules of the road' and also the possible violation of
any oath that you may have taken when you received your license."</TE>
<TE>   The blockade was to have taken place Thursday. "But fortunately,
cooler heads prevailed," Oefinger said.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the captains and landing operators scheduled Sunday's
demonstration, from noon to 3 p.m. at Reservation Point near the
entrance of L.A. Harbor, aboard party boats from Ventura to San
Diego. The public is invited to board the boats, space permitting, at
their home ports beforehand or at 22nd Street Landing, which is
headquarters for the event.</TE>
<TE>   "All we're after is to make a statement," Watson said, "to let the
general public know that this is an issue and to think about it for
the future, for the future of the young kids of tomorrow, who might
have no place to fish, and for the future of our business."</TE>
<TE>   News and Notes</TE>
<TE>   * Rockfish closure: Saturday marks the beginning of a rockfish and
lingcod fishery closure in all waters south of Cape Mendocino. It's a
two-month closure but 2003 regulations, which go into effect Jan. 1,
will lengthen it through next June. However, fishermen will be able
to target sculpin inside of 20 fathoms in January and February.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, the sheephead fishery on Saturday will close for the
remainder of the year because sportfishing quotas, when tallied, will
probably have been met. If the catches fall below the allowable
harvest levels, that fishery could be reopened.</TE>
<TE>   * No long-lines allowed: There was some good news for
sportfishermen this week. The Pacific Fishery Management Council on
Tuesday unanimously approved a management plan for highly migratory
species that prohibits the use of the controversial fishing gear
inside the 200-mile exclusive economic zone, and prohibits the sale
of striped marlin. Commercial fishermen had been seeking permission
to use the highly efficient and indiscriminate gear off the West
Coast inside the EEZ to target mostly swordfish and tuna.
Sportfishermen have been among those fighting to keep the long-liners
out. The plan still must be approved by the National Marine Fisheries
Service.</TE>
<TE>   * Ducks in season: Waterfowl hunting in Southern California opens
Saturday and prospects -- for opening weekend, anyway -- are better
than expected considering that populations are down significantly
because of prolonged drought conditions in the breeding areas. "We've
already got between 4,000 and 5,000 ducks in the area so I'm pretty
excited about the opener, although I won't make any predictions
beyond that," said Jim Chakarun, manager of Imperial Wildlife Area
near Niland, Calif. The IWA Wister Unit's 120 blinds are sold out for
opening weekend but hunters can earn spots in a lottery taking place
Friday night from 7-10. Details: (760) 359-0577.</TE>
<TE>   Other popular spots for opening weekend are the IWA's Finney-Ramer
Unit; San Diego City Lakes, Salton Sea and San Jacinto Wildlife Area
and nearby Lake Perris in Riverside County.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the lower numbers, the season has been shortened and
will run through Jan. 26. Additionally, limits have been reduced or
cut to zero for some species. Pintails, for example, may only be shot
from Nov. 28-Jan. 26 and only one pintail may be included in an
overall five-bird daily limit. Hunters can review regulations at
www.dfg.ca.gov.</TE>
<TE>   Winding Up</TE>
<TE>   You've heard the expression: Fishing was so good they were jumping
into the boat.</TE>
<TE>   Well, fishing was that good for Scott and Patsy Spiro, and sons
Jonathan and Nicholas. While on a recent trip aboard the Gavoita V
off Cabo San Lucas, Patsy Spiro hooked a blue marlin that came in
without a fight. However, just as it was being released it leaped
into the boat, sending the passengers and crew scurrying for cover,
and thrashed so violently that it ripped one of the fighting chairs
loose and flipped it overboard.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the billfish died and was brought to the scale,
where it weighed 265 pounds. The anglers, who had stopped at Land's
End during a cruise, caught their ship and continued first to
Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo, where they caught a sailfish; then to Mazatlan,
where they landed several dorado.</TE>

<KH>Q &amp; A WITH BILL WALSH</KH>
<HD>49ers' Architect Admits Having Second Thoughts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jim Gray</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As coach of the San Francisco 49ers, Bill Walsh won three Super Bowl
titles before stepping down in January 1989. Walsh, considered one of
the greatest offensive minds in the game, returned to coaching at
Stanford from 1992-94.</LD>
<LD>   Walsh, who turns 71 this month, served as vice president and
general manager of the 49ers from 1999-2001 and is now a consultant
for the team.</LD>
<LD>   Question: How much do you miss coaching?</LD>
<TE>   Answer: I miss coaching quite a bit. I'm just not ready to go six
months without a day off. When I returned to Stanford we did OK the
first year. We had a really great team. But people expected too much.
When you've won and been very successful and you do return, they
expect miracles and sometimes those don't occur. George Seifert's a
good example.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do you regret that you stepped away the first time?</TE>
<TE>   A: I think so. If I had some time off, I'm sure I could have
remained for two or three more years, and I think we would have won
some Super Bowls. I just had total burnout. I guess you'd call it a
meltdown, by handling all these different jobs. I was the president,
general manager and head coach, and it finally caught up to me. If I
could have taken three months off, I could have made it. But you
can't do that, there aren't any sabbaticals in sports.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Just as a coach, would you be interested in coming back?</TE>
<TE>   A: Well, it's almost a fantasy at this point, because that's not
going to happen. I think I was at my best on the sidelines during a
game and managing a game. But the game has changed; it's evolved.
It's different.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You say a fantasy. Do you mean it's a fantasy because you don't
think any team would hire you?</TE>
<TE>   A: I don't know that. But it would have to be an elderly owner, I
guess, that could appreciate me.</TE>
<TE>   Q: As you said, you were president, general manager and head
coach. With the NFL the way it is now, should coaches serve as both
coach and general manager?</TE>
<TE>   A: It takes a unique person to do both. Mike Holmgren is and so is
Mike Shanahan. Personnel and coaching can effectively be done by one
person, but rarely is there an outstanding coach who is an
outstanding personnel man.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Why?</TE>
<TE>   A: I don't know. Some of the best coaches made some of the poorest
personnel decisions and the poorest acquisitions that basically
brought them down.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Is being stubborn about the players you pick a big part of it?</TE>
<TE>   A: Yes. You end up staying with the wrong person because you want
to give him every chance. You don't want him to fail, because if he
does, so have you. You end up waiting too long, and then it finally
costs you.</TE>
<TE>   Q: In your job as a consultant for the 49ers, how much input do
you have, and how involved are you on a day-to-day basis?</TE>
<TE>   A: I have input and I'm involved. Every two weeks, I'll bring a
series of expertly diagramed plays to Steve Mariucci. Occasionally,
you'll see one on the field. But probably the most impact I have is
with the players. I have an excellent relationship with them. I'm
pretty strong with them, and driven, and they accept it. Because I
have a great relationship with Steve, it's working out well. I just
get great satisfaction from the feeling that I'm appreciated and
well-received.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What was it that you saw in Jeff Garcia that others didn't,
because you were one of his biggest supporters early on?</TE>
<TE>   A: When he was at San Jose State, we played against him when I was
coaching at Stanford. He looked so much like Joe Montana. He's not as
aesthetic or artistic in appearance, but he has the spontaneity, the
instincts, the mobility and is a great competitor and performer. So
that's what I saw. I can't understand it, but a lot of people didn't
see it. Some of the people I trust and believe in the most would take
my recommendation to their personnel people and they would just say,
"Not a chance. Walsh has gone soft."</TE>
<TE>   Q: You mention Joe Montana. What current NFL quarterback, if any,
looks the most like Montana to you?</TE>
<TE>   A: Tom Brady appears much like Joe. He plays with the same style
and composure. He's not quite as athletic, because Joe could avoid
people and run a little better. But he's very, very close.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How would you handle the antics and behavior of today's
players, such as Randy Moss, and in a much different way Terrell
Owens?</TE>
<TE>   A: Well so much of it in my era was peer pressure from the other
players. We took on some guys who had sort of questioned or troubled
pasts, and they just melded right in with the other players because
they could see that it's not acceptable to behave like that here. If
you wanted to be a part of the team, and everybody did, you were
responsive to your teammates. Now, I would have to establish an
environment with some mores and set parameters. You would have to
live within those boundaries or you would have to play somewhere
else. The 49ers have brought in some people that everyone would
question and somehow they made it. A team that has always done it and
been very successful is the Raiders. But no matter how great the
player is, be it Randy or Terrell, they would have to live within the
parameters.</TE>

<LD>South Africa, long considered a strong candidate to stage the World
Cup in 2010, Thursday became the first country to officially announce
that it will bid to host the quadrennial world championship in eight
years' time.</LD>
<LD>   "The bid is going ahead," Danny Jordaan, the bid's chief executive
officer, said in Johannesburg after the South African Football Assn.
formally endorsed the plan. "For us now, it's all systems go, but I
think it's going to be a tough bid."</LD>
<LD>   FIFA, the governing body of the sport, has limited the bidding to
African countries and told those that wish to bid to indicate their
intention by Dec. 31. Libya and Morocco have expressed interest, as
have Nigeria and Egypt.</LD>

<TE>   Argentine Fans Riot</TE>
<TE>   Hooligans associated with the Argentine club Gimnasia-La Plata
twice attacked a bus carrying the players and coaches of Bolivian
league leader Bolivar, pelting the vehicle with stones, breaking its

<TE>   The incidents occurred while the bus was traveling from Buenos
Aires to La Plata, where Bolivar was to play a Copa Sudamericana
quarterfinal game Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   "We're OK, thank God," said Fernandez, who was sidelined after a
piece of glass become lodged in his eye. "There were two attacks, one
on the motorway and one at the entrance to the stadium. It was
madness. I thought they were going to get on and kill us."</TE>
<TE>   The game was delayed but eventually was played, with Gimnasia-La
Plata winning, 2-0, but losing the two-game series, 4-3, and being
eliminated.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Days after the hot-house environment of the U.S. Open, Lindsay
Davenport -- an Angel fan before the bandwagon became overcrowded --
was planning to go to a game. Jon Leach, her boyfriend, looked
alarmed. Nothing against the Angels ... really.</LD>
<LD>   "He said, 'No, you're not,' " Davenport said. "I was like, 'We're
supposed to go.' Then he was just totally panicked. I said, 'What's
going on?' "</LD>
<LD>   Oh, only a marriage proposal. Yes, she skipped the game. And yes,
she said yes.</LD>
<TE>   Davenport retold the story at a press gathering Thursday for next
week's Home Depot WTA Championships at Staples Center. She laughed
and said of the missed Angel game: "I really wanted to go."</TE>
<TE>   It has been an eventful year for Davenport. She had major knee
surgery in January, returned to the tour in July and lost in four
finals. At the U.S. Open, she went out in the semifinals to eventual
champion Serena Williams. She still achieved one of her primary goals
of 2002 -- qualifying for the 16-player singles field at the WTA
Championships, which start Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I still think I'm a little ways off from where I'd like to be, or
where I can be or where I think I was," Davenport said.</TE>
<TE>   When the season-ending tournament moved to Los Angeles from
Munich, Germany, Davenport was one of the biggest boosters. But she
didn't want to be watching from the sideline during a major event a
mere car ride away from her Laguna Beach home.</TE>
<TE>   To land a spot, she played three straight weeks in Europe,

<HD>Deal Keeps DirecTV Beaming</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>DirecTV is in the middle of an ownership mess but it appears that the
company will retain exclusive rights to "NFL Sunday Ticket."</LD>
<LD>   Two sources told The Times that, barring unforeseen roadblocks,
there will be an announcement in the next couple of weeks on a new
exclusive deal with DirecTV.</LD>
<LD>   It will probably run through the 2005 season, after which the
NFL's contracts with ABC, CBS, Fox and ESPN expire.</LD>
<TE>   DirecTV's current exclusive "NFL Sunday Ticket" deal expires after
this season.</TE>
<TE>   There has been speculation that the pay package could be headed
for digital cable exclusively, or some combination of satellite and
digital cable. But it appears that's not going to happen.</TE>
<TE>   Denver Bronco owner Pat Bowlen, the chairman of the NFL's
television committee who was in New York for NFL owners' meetings
this week, declined to comment regarding re-upping with DirecTV.</TE>
<TE>   But it's known he has been advocating some changes -- in
particular an a la carte aspect to the package. He told the Rocky
Mountain News in late September that fans of particular teams should
be able to buy season passes for their team's games.</TE>
<TE>   "You shouldn't have to buy the whole package," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "NFL Sunday Ticket," which has been around since 1995, allows
subscribers to watch every NFL game. The cost of the season package
is $179 for existing subscribers. It's believed there are now about
1.5 million subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   DirecTV is being sold but the Federal Communications Commission
three weeks ago blocked a $16-billion merger between EchoStar, which
owns the Dish Network, and DirecTV. An effort is being made to get
the FCC to reverse that decision.</TE>
<TE>   "Sunday Ticket" has been one of DirecTV's main weapons in its
battle with cable television for subscribers. Maintaining the package
is important to the company, no matter who owns it.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, it was announced this week that the Dish Network, still
a DirecTV competitor, has begun offering the "NBA League Pass"
package. It's also available on DirecTV and most digital cable
systems through In Demand.</TE>
<TE>   Super Station</TE>
<TE>   Another major development in sports broadcasting -- at least in
Southern California -- is happening in radio. It appears likely that
within the next few weeks, Clear Channel radio stations KXTA (1150)
and San Diego-based XTRA (690) will combine into one "super station."</TE>
<TE>   The same programming will be carried by both stations, although
what that will be remains to be determined. It's a safe bet it will
include Jim Rome in the mornings and Lee Hamilton in afternoon drive
time.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA and the Clippers will be part of the programming too. But
what will happen to XTRA's San Diego State rights is not known. The
combined programming figures to be geared more to the larger Los
Angeles audience.</TE>
<TE>   Once the stations are combined, programming will be heard loud and
clear everywhere in the broadcast radius. Now, KXTA's signal is weak
in southern Orange County and XTRA's signal is weak in some areas of
the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Best of Both Worlds</TE>
<TE>   Pat Haden was 11 in 1964 when his father took him to see Notre
Dame play USC at the Coliseum. The Irish, 2-7 the year before, were
8-0 under first-year coach Ara Parshegian and on the verge of a
national championship. But the Trojans, trailing, 17-0, at halftime,
won the game, 20-17, on a touchdown pass from Craig Fertig to Rod
Sherman.</TE>
<TE>   "Being raised as a good Catholic, I was a Notre Dame fan," Haden
said Thursday. "It broke my heart. I was destroyed."</TE>
<TE>   These days, Haden is in his fifth season as NBC's Notre Dame
commentator. He's also a USC alumnus and recent inductee into the USC
Athletic Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, he'll be working Notre Dame's home game against Boston
College for NBC. Since regular partner Tom Hammond is recovering from
heart surgery, Dan Hicks will be handling the play-by-play.</TE>
<TE>   After Boston College, the Irish play Navy and Rutgers. So they
very well might be undefeated and on the verge of a national
championship under first-year Coach Tyrone Willingham when they come
to the Coliseum to play USC Nov. 30.</TE>
<TE>   That game will be televised by ABC, so Haden will be there as a
spectator.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just glad that it appears the game will mean something, that
USC-Notre Dame has regained its national prominence," Haden said. "Of
course as an alum, I want USC to win the game. As a broadcaster, I
don't root for Notre Dame. I don't root for anyone. But it's a lot
more fun doing the games when the team is 8-0."</TE>
<TE>   Clipper Deal Dead</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers, who make their debut on Channel 5 Sunday, were
unable to make a deal with Fox Sports Net 2 and negotiations were
called off Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Roeser, the Clippers' executive vice president, said,
"Perhaps we can work out something for next season, but for this
season our broadcast package will consist of 25 games on Channel 5.
We've talked about all kinds of deals and nothing seems to work for
both sides."</TE>
<TE>   Roeser said Fox Sports Net 2 offered 25% less than it paid last
season.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Simpson, Fox Sports Net's general manager, said, "Of course
we would have liked to have gotten a deal done. But in light of the
new NBA television deal and how it affects local rights holders,
local rights aren't worth what they once were.</TE>
<TE>   "The value they were after and the value we perceived they were
worth weren't close. It came down to two major issues -- term and
price."</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   In a Times story this week about the NBA's new television
contract, under which most regular-season games will be on cable
television, it was noted that 37% of the L.A. market does not have
cable. NBA Commissioner David Stern pointed out that when you factor
in satellite homes in the L.A. market, 24% don't get cable channels.
Also, first- and second-round Laker playoff games on ESPN can also be
televised by local carriers Channel 9 or Fox Sports Net. Of course,
first the 0-2 Lakers have to make the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Recommended viewing: Emmitt Smith is featured in a one-hour NFL
Films special today at 5 p.m. on ESPN2, and Jerry Rice is the topic
on another excellent edition of "Beyond the Glory" on Fox Sports Net
Sunday at 8 p.m. ... "Shell's Wonderful World of Golf" makes its
debut on its new home, the Golf Channel, Thursday at 5 and 8 p.m.
Phil Mickelson and David Toms square off in the first two-hour show.</TE>
<TE>   Radio Notes</TE>
<TE>   Former USC announcer Larry Kahn's Sports USA Radio network, which
has been delivering college broadcasts each Saturday to about 100
stations, begins an NFL schedule Sunday with St. Louis at Arizona.
Kahn and former Seattle Seahawk quarterback Dave Krieg call the
games, which will carried by KLSX-FM (97.1) in Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   Steven Cohen and Nick Gerber's weekly two-hour "World Soccer
Weekly," carried locally by KMPC (1540) Sundays at 7 a.m., becomes
the first show of its kind to be nationally syndicated in the U.S.
this weekend. Beginning Sunday, it will be carried by 75 stations in
68 markets through a distribution deal with Sports Byline USA.</TE>
<TE>   In Closing</TE>
<TE>   The 42.1 and 61 share for Sunday's Game 7 of the Angels' World
Series triumph was the highest baseball rating in Los Angeles since
the fifth and final game of the 1988 World Series between the Dodgers
and Oakland A's got a 45.5/66.</TE>

<LD>Bruin defensive end Dave Ball has sacks in six consecutive games and
ranks second in the Pacific 10 Conference with seven. It's a marked
improvement for the junior, who had only one sack last season.</LD>
<LD>   "I decided I needed to become more consistent, so that's what I've
strived for," he said. "I'm using my moves more effectively."</LD>
<LD>   Ball's sack last season came against Washington. He's looking to
have another big game against the Huskies, who average 46 passes a
game and have thrown the ball as many as 65 times this season.</LD>
<TE>   Last week against Arizona State, Washington quarterback Cody
Pickett was sacked eight times. Sun Devil defensive end Terrell Suggs
had 4 1/2 sacks.</TE>
<TE>   "We know they are going to throw and that makes it easier to get
in there and pass rush," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kirby Joseph, a freshman who is redshirting, probably will shift
from linebacker to defensive end in the spring in an effort to bring
more speed to the position.</TE>
<TE>   Ball and his twin, Mat, will return along with Asi Faoa and David
Tautofi at end, but all four will be seniors.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Speculation that Bruin defensive tackle Matt Kocher left the team
last week because he was unhappy with playing time is untrue, his
father said. Kocher was a walk-on whose brother, Ken, was a standout
lineman last season.</TE>
<TE>   "Matt is called to the ministry, he's had a real deal for worship
since he was little and he's preached in front of hundreds of
people," Randy Kocher said.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a little frustrated because he thought he earned a shot at
being the backup. But the main reason he left was that he sees a need
in his life to focus more on the ministry."</TE>
<TE>   Kocher, a third-year sophomore, had a sack against San Diego State
but did not play again. He is still enrolled at UCLA and plans to
earn his degree.</TE>
<TE>   He and Ken -- who was cut by the Green Bay Packers -- attended the
UCLA game against Stanford on Saturday and the family continues to
support the program.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach Toledo has been a good guy to us, he's been
straightforward, he's a class act and we are advocates of his," Randy
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to express complete support for the program and Coach
Toledo."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Safety Jibril Raymo (shoulder), receiver Ryan Smith (ankle) and
linebacker Tim Warfield (concussion) will not travel to Washington.
The loss of Raymo leaves only three safeties -- starters Ben Emanuel
and Jarrad Page and reserve Kevin Brant.... New sod will be laid over
the weekend at Spaulding Field.... The UCLA-Arizona game in Tucson on
Nov. 9 will begin at 6 p.m. PST and be televised on Fox Sports Net 2.</TE>

<LD>BOSTON COLLEGE (4-3)</LD>
<LD>   at No. 4 NOTRE DAME (8-0)</LD>
<LD>   Kickoff: 11:30 a.m.</LD>
<TE>   TV: Channel 4.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Notre Dame by 10.</TE>
<TE>   Boston College update: The Eagles face a Fighting Irish defense
that is giving up only 13.5 points a game.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame update: Fresh off a 34-24 "upset" of Florida State,
Tyrone Willingham's Irish might pass defending champion Miami for No.
2 in the bowl championship series rankings with a victory over the
Eagles.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: It's all about echoes of 1993. A week after the Irish
upset No. 1 Florida State that year, Boston College ended Notre
Dame's national championship hopes, upsetting the Irish with a field
goal as time expired.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Notre Dame. Uptight Willingham doesn't strike you as the
kind of coach to let his team get overconfident in this situation.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 16 ARIZONA STATE (7-2)</TE>
<TE>   At No. 8 WASHINGTON STATE (7-1)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 12:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 7.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Washington State by 7 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State update: OK, Andrew Walter, are you for real?
Victories over Oregon and Washington say the sophomore quarterback
can hold his own in a gun-slinging contest with Jason Gesser. Terrell
Suggs' 17 1/2 sacks leave him only 1 1/2 shy of the Pacific 10
Conference record.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State update: Gesser, with the school record for total
offense in hand, can break Jack Thompson's career passing mark if he
surpasses 228 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: It's the clash of the last unbeaten teams in Pac-10
play, giving the winner the clearest path to the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Washington State. Betting against Gesser doesn't seem
like a good move.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 5 GEORGIA (8-0) VS.</TE>
<TE>   FLORIDA (5-3) AT JACKSONVILLE, FLA.</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 4:45 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: ESPN</TE>
<TE>   Line: Georgia by 2.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia update:  Coach Mark Richt continues to go with a
two-quarterback system, using David Greene and D.J. Shockley. Last
week against Kentucky, the two combined for six touchdown passes -- a
Georgia record.</TE>
<TE>   Florida update: The thrice-beaten Gators haven't been underdogs in
this game since 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Georgia tries to stay undefeated and lurking in the
background of the national championship picture. Florida makes a bid
to get back in the national rankings.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Georgia. With running back Musa Smith and offensive
tackle Jon Stinchcomb expected to return from injury, the nod goes to
the 'Dawgs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 13 COLORADO (6-2)</TE>
<TE>   at No. 2 OKLAHOMA (7-0)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 12:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: ESPN GamePlan.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Oklahoma by 12.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado update:  Colorado has scored at least 31 points -- once
as many as 53 -- the last five games. Chris Brown leads the nation in
rushing with 163 yards a game.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma update: How do you like this stat? The Sooners are 10-1
against top-10 teams under Bob Stoops. But Colorado isn't quite in
the top 10 -- and surprisingly, Oklahoma hasn't beaten Colorado since
1988. The nine-game winless streak is Oklahoma's longest against any
team.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Oklahoma, No. 2 in the polls and No. 1 in the BCS
rankings, tries to avoid a misstep in one its more dangerous
remaining games.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Oklahoma. We still remember USC's 40-3 victory over
Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 7 TEXAS (7-1)</TE>
<TE>   at NEBRASKA (6-3)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 4 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Fox Sports Net.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Texas by 3 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Texas update: The Longhorns' 1998 victory at Nebraska's Memorial
Stadium might be considered the biggest victory Mack Brown has had at
Texas. Brown is the only visiting coach to win there since 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska update: The Cornhuskers pulled out a road victory at
Texas A&amp;M last week. Nebraska's 26-game home winning streak is
longest in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: It's only a question of which coach the scorn will be
heaped on, Brown or Frank Solich. The loser loses a lot in this one.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Nebraska. Yes, it would be an upset, but the line is
only 3 1/2 points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   GEORGIA TECH (5-3)</TE>
<TE>   at NORTH CAROLINA STATE (9-0)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 12:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: ESPN GamePlan.</TE>
<TE>   Line: North Carolina State by 10.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia Tech update:  The Yellow Jackets have to key on the
Wolfpack's running game, not only quarterback Philip Rivers</TE>
<TE>   North Carolina State update: A 10th win would set a school record
for the Wolfpack. Get past this one, and it has only Maryland and
Virginia before a potentially gargantuan regular-season finale
against Florida State.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Will the Wolfpack football team be left wishing it had
an NCAA tournament to pull off the kind of miracle its basketball
team did in 1983?</TE>
<TE>   The pick: North Carolina State. The so-called frauds might run the
table, creating some BCS controversy.</TE>

<HD>Kicker's Return Lifts Rams</HD>
<DH>Babcock grabs fumble and scores as No. 24 Colorado State
defeats Air Force, 31-12.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>AIR FORCE ACADEMY, Colo.</DL>
<LD>Colorado State coaches asked Jeff Babcock to send the second-half
kickoff through the end zone.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm glad I didn't," Babcock said.</LD>
<LD>   Air Force's Bryan Blew took Babcock's kick at the goal line and
returned it to the 29, where he fumbled.</LD>
<TE>   Babcock scooped up the ball and returned it for a rare touchdown
by a kicker as No. 24 Colorado State defeated Air Force, 31-12,
Thursday night. It was the third loss in a row for the Falcons (6-3,
3-2 Mountain West).</TE>
<TE>   Cecil Sapp ran for 132 yards and two touchdowns as the Rams (8-2,
4-0) won their fourth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Babcock's touchdown -- the first by a Colorado State kicker since
1961 -- gave the Rams a 28-12 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "Scoring a touchdown was the greatest," Babcock said. "The only
thing that could have been better would have been kicking a
game-winning field goal.</TE>
<TE>   "I reached the end zone and turned, expecting to see the refs
whistling the play dead and saying someone was down. I was sure
something was going to happen. I didn't think that could come true."</TE>
<TE>   Colorado State quarterback Bradlee Van Pelt said the Rams'
sideline erupted when Babcock scored -- with laughter.</TE>
<TE>   "I think our whole sideline laughed," Van Pelt said. "I never saw
a kicker run and score before. I don't know who teaches them."</TE>
<TE>   Falcon Coach Fisher DeBerry said he felt good about his team's
chances at halftime. Then came Babcock's score.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know of a worse way in the world to start the second
half," he said.</TE>

<HD>Hatfield Apologizes for Anti-Gay Remarks</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rice Coach Ken Hatfield has apologized for remarks attributed to him
saying that he might consider removing a gay player from the team,
comments that angered student groups and prompted a meeting with the
school president.</LD>
<LD>   In a story about gay athletes in the Nov. 1 issue of The Chronicle
for Higher Education titled "The Loneliest Athlete," Hatfield asserts
homosexuality conflicts with his religious beliefs.</LD>
<LD>   The article says that while Hatfield "would not necessarily kick a
player off the team for being gay, he probably would think hard about
it."</LD>
<TE>   Hatfield said the article never directly quoted him saying that,
and that he was trying to convey he wasn't sure how he would deal
with such a situation because he has never been through it.</TE>
<TE>   The Chronicle for Higher Education, a newspaper for college
administrators and faculty members, stands behind its story.</TE>

<TE>   Fresno State Athletic Director Scott Johnson issued an apology to
the University of Hawaii because of a screwdriver thrown by a fan
during the Warriors' victory last Friday at Bulldog Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   After an investigation, which included a discussion with Hawaii
Coach June Jones, Johnson said, "We believe that a screwdriver was
thrown by one of our fans at the University of Hawaii team bench."</TE>
<TE>   Jones said he was nearly struck in the head by the tool late in
the game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Washington State Coach Mike Price characterized a fight between
linebacker Ira Davis and cornerback Jason David as "an isolated event
between two players" involving a misunderstanding over "a third
party," and refused to say who that person was.</TE>
<TE>   Davis was suspended indefinitely and David could be out eight
weeks because of a broken cheekbone.</TE>
<TE>   A reporter from the Spokane Spokesman-Review witnessed the fight.
According to the paper, David was facing his locker when Davis threw
a punch that caught David on the cheekbone.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State freshman running back Maurice Clarett said he is
getting hate e-mail from fans after his statement that he might
challenge the NFL rule that prevents underclassmen from making
themselves eligible for the draft.</TE>
<TE>   "I still get e-mails that say, 'I hate you ... this, that and the
other thing," Clarett said. "There's hate mail in my locker. That's
the main thing -- like you're not loyal, you're not a Buckeye. But I
can't control what other people think, write or say about me. So I
don't really care about it too much."</TE>
<TE>   Clarett, who left last week's game against Penn State after

<HD>Kariya Wears Different Hat</HD>
<DH>He scores three goals, has an assist and is called for
three penalties in the Ducks' 4-1 victory over Bruins in Boston.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Paul Kariya may have already eliminated himself from consideration
for the Lady Byng Trophy.</LD>
<LD>   Those six penalty minutes Thursday night -- two for
unsportsmanlike conduct -- were hardly the stuff of gentlemanly play.
But the trade-off for Kariya is well worth it.</LD>
<LD>   His hat trick and assist pushed the Mighty Ducks to a 4-1 victory
over the Boston Bruins in front of an announced 9,491 at the
FleetCenter. The victory ended a potentially disastrous trip on a
positive note.</LD>
<TE>   "Paul has been good all year," Coach Mike Babcock said. "But we
needed a breakthrough, superstar-type performance, where you grab the
team and say, 'Hey, we're getting a win tonight,' and that's what he
did.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to get to be a good team that people don't just
Iaugh at," Babcock added.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks chuckled all the way back to Anaheim after ending
Boston's eight-game unbeaten streak. The Ducks have a 3-5-3 record
and can make their case as a playoff contender -- which Babcock did,
and for which he had Kariya to thank.</TE>
<TE>   "He knew how urgent this game was for us," Babcock said. "This was
urgent time for us. If urgent can be on the 11th game of year, this
was for us. We're trying stay in [the race]. With two points tonight,
suddenly we're back in that group again that might be in that
picture."</TE>
<TE>   "Urgent" was the key word there.</TE>
<TE>   There was a sense of that early, as Duck goalie Jean-Sebastien
Giguere needed to survive difficult situations. The Bruins were on
the power play 10 of the first 30 minutes. Giguere, who stopped 26 of
27 shots, denied them each time.</TE>
<TE>   Then Kariya went to work.</TE>
<TE>   His eighth hat trick began when he scored on a gritty play in
front of the net. He followed that with a highlights-at-11
back-hander. His third was a gift from grateful teammates, who set
him up while the Ducks had a five-on-three advantage with three
seconds to play.</TE>
<TE>   "It is always nice to get a hat trick," Kariya said. "I have a lot
of friends in Boston so it was nice to play well. We have had some
ups and downs on this road trip, so it was nice to finish it off with
a win."</TE>
<TE>   "Nice" being the key word there.</TE>
<TE>   Nice wasn't quite the word to describe Kariya during the game.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, he was still a bit miffed about his unsportsmanlike
conduct penalty, which was added onto his hooking penalty in the
first period.</TE>
<TE>   That led to an ungentlemanlytype comment, which may ding his Byng
chances.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought [the hooking call] was a bad call and I told him so,"
Kariya said. "I said something that I have said a million times and
have never been called for unsportsmanlike conduct."</TE>
<TE>   And the lesson he learned sitting the penalty box?</TE>
<TE>   "It is cold in there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kariya heated up after that and spent the remainder of the game
torturing former Duck goalie Steve Shields.</TE>
<TE>   He scored on a power play, chipping in the puck from a scrum in
front of the net for a 1-0 lead midway through the second period.</TE>
<TE>   Then with the score tied, 1-1, Shields lazily tried to sweep the
puck behind the net, seemingly unconcerned that Kariya was on his
heels. Shields fell down. Kariya swung from behind the net, passed on
shooting, and centered to Matt Cullen for an empty-net goal.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a goal-scorer's goal," Cullen said, laughing. "That was
one of the easiest ones I'll ever get."</TE>
<TE>   Kariya made a difficult one look easy late in the period. He
slipped behind the Bruin defense and took a flip pass from Steve
Rucchin. Kariya confused Shields with backhand and forehand fakes
before back-handing the puck into the net.</TE>

<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>The Mighty Ducks finally got the type of performance they were
expecting from goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere.</LD>
<LD>   Giguere, who has wobbled at times recently, had his best game of
the season Thursday, stopping 26 of 27 shots in the Ducks' 4-1
victory over the Boston Bruins. He needed to be especially sharp with
the Bruins on the power play 10 of the first 30 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a team that shoots the puck a lot," Giguere, who had a
3.09 goals-against average before Thursday, said of Boston. "I knew I
had to be ready for that first period. Tonight was a positive thing
for me. I have to keep rolling.</LD>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, I can think on this game until midnight and then
start worrying about the next one."</TE>
<TE>   Giguere's best save came with the game scoreless, when he managed
to slide across the crease to deny Marty McInnis on a first-period
power play.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Chris O'Sullivan, who had an assist Thursday, was sent
to minor league Cincinnati, and defenseman Pavel Trnka will be
activated.</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Fredrik Olausson, a healthy scratch the last two games,
will probably return to the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks also sent left wing Mike Brown to Cincinnati for a
conditioning assignment. He will play two games and rejoin the Ducks
Sunday.</TE>

<TE>   The 67th edition of the East L.A. Classic tonight is expected to
draw 20,000 or more to the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   But the annual football game between Roosevelt and Garfield will
have additional meaning in the Eastern League standings.</TE>
<TE>   The winner will take sole possession of first place with two weeks
remaining in the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   Roosevelt leads the series, 35-24-7, including a 35-22 victory
last year.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes it more exciting," Roosevelt Coach Jose Casagran said.
"This is the first time since I've been here that this game has
league title implications."</TE>
<TE>   Roosevelt (6-1, 2-0) is led by running backs Zach Owens and
USC-bound Jody Adewale, each of whom has had a 300-yard rushing game
this season.</TE>
<TE>   Led by all-purpose player Manuel Torres and linebacker Seferino
Diaz, Garfield (4-3, 2-0) has been a surprise and put itself in title
contention by defeating Bell, 9-6, in overtime and Jordan, 20-18,
last week.</TE>
<TE>   In the Bell victory, Torres -- who is also a running back --
kicked three field goals to account for the Bulldogs' scoring.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is really excited about this year's team," Garfield
Coach Lorenzo Hernandez said.</TE>
<TE>   "They've been in a couple of tight games and they've fallen behind
a couple of times but they have come back. It shows that we have a
lot of heart."</TE>

<TE>   Senior Johnny Zendejas of Camarillo will run his first
cross-country race in seven weeks today when he competes in the
Ventura County championships at Lake Casitas near Ojai.</TE>
<TE>   Zendejas was expected to be one of the top runners in Ventura
County this season but was diagnosed with mononucleosis shortly after
finishing fifth in a season-opening meet Sept. 12.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure how he'll do," Camarillo Coach Coach Mike Smith
said. "But I'm sure he'll help us. He's a talented kid."</TE>
<TE>   That talent was obvious in the 2000 Southern Section Division I
finals, where Zendejas placed eighth with a 15-minute 21-second
clocking over Mount San Antonio College's 2.91-mile course. He
finished 22nd in the section championships last year after being
slowed by an injury early in the season.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Garrett Augustine's heart sank when his 35-yard field-goal attempt
left his foot Thursday night. When he looked up to check the ball's
trajectory, he didn't feel much better.</LD>
<LD>   But the ball knuckled nose-first through the uprights as time
expired, giving Orange Lutheran a 24-21 victory over Anaheim Katella
in an Empire League game at Brea Olinda High.</LD>
<LD>   "It looked like [the field goal] was shot out of cannon, didn't
it?" said Orange Lutheran Coach Jim Kunau.</LD>
<TE>   The Lancers (6-2, 3-0), the only unbeaten team in league, appeared
to be headed for a tie after Katella quarterback Tony Savala scored
on a one-yard sneak with 33 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   But after Orange Lutheran began its final possession near
midfield, Casey Whieldon threw a screen pass to Brendan Circle, and
he ran 40 yards to the Katella 18-yard line with 18 seconds left.
After a touchdown run was called back on the next play because of a
holding penalty, Whieldon took a knee with five seconds remaining to
set up Augustine's kick.</TE>
<TE>   The Lancers, ranked No. 4 in Division VI, appeared in position to
win when Brent Concolino scored on a 10-yard run for a 21-14 lead
with 3:17 to play. But Savala connected on consecutive passes of 23
and 29 yards to put the No. 5 Knights (7-1, 2-1) at the Lancer 18.
Five plays later, he tied the score on his one-yard run.</TE>
<TE>   Katella drove inside the 20 three times in the first half but
settled for field goals of 34 and 35 yards by Kevin Stout.</TE>
<TE>   Both teams had costly turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   Katella's Mike Vega, who rushed for 189 yards in 27 carries,
fumbled at his own 15 in the first quarter, setting up the Lancers'
first touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Whieldon had an errant pitchout early in the second half recovered
by the Knights at the Katella 14. The Knights then marched down the
field to tie the game, 14-14, on Savala's one-yard run and ensuing
two-point conversion pass to Brandon Barnes.</TE>
<TE>   -- Dan Arritt</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim Esperanza 42, Huntington Beach 0 -- The Aztecs (7-1, 2-1),
ranked No. 10 in the Southland by The Times, rebounded from
Saturday's Sunset League loss to No. 4 Los Alamitos and routed the
fast-fading Oilers (3-5, 0-3) by scoring six consecutive times after
the opening drive.</TE>
<TE>   Esperanza held the Southland's leading rusher, Patrick Harrigan of
Huntington Beach, who averages 7.5 yards a carry, to 53 yards in 14
carries, including a two-yard loss late in the game on one of two
successful goal-line stands.</TE>
<TE>   It was a sloppy effort for Huntington Beach. The Oilers had three
turnovers, two fumbles and an interception, the latter stopping a
potential scoring drive. They also muffed two kickoffs that led to
poor field position and a bad snap on a punt attempt deep in their
own territory that led to an Aztec touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach also let Dustin Snider escape an apparent tackle
on a short pass play, and he turned it into a 34-yard touchdown for
Esperanza's first score.</TE>

<LD>The rumors started soon after standout running back Durrell Moss
completed his junior football season at Orange High.</LD>
<LD>   He was supposed to transfer.</LD>
<LD>   His team had finished 2-8 and 0-10 the last two seasons. Through
spring and summer, people still believed that Moss wouldn't stay at a
losing program for fear it might jeopardize his college chances. But
they didn't know Moss.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a bunch of lies over and over," Moss said. "It's not about
who I play for. It's friendship and family. You bond with your
teammates. You can't just leave them. I wouldn't do that."</TE>
<TE>   Moss rushed for 1,782 yards as a junior and has come back to gain
991 yards this season for the improving Panthers, who are 4-3 overall
and 2-1 in the Golden West League. They still have to play two of the
top three teams in league.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, he accepted a scholarship to Washington, proving
that college coaches don't care about a team's record.</TE>
<TE>   There's an erroneous assumption made by many parents that teenage
athletes are unlikely to receive a college scholarship by playing for
a losing program. Far more important is what a high school coach does
to alert recruiters about a potential prospect.</TE>
<TE>   Second-year Orange Coach Greg Gibson made sure college coaches
were aware of Moss. He put together a highlight tape, grade
transcript and biography and sent them off to schools. Coaches came
in last spring to watch the 6-foot-1, 190-pounder and saw for
themselves his 4.4 40-yard speed.</TE>
<TE>   "People get all caught up in what high school they're from,"
Gibson said. "Coach [Rick] Neuheisel [of Washington] said they could
care less. They want to see how good players are by the tape and come
and watch them live. They offered a scholarship based on what they
saw."</TE>
<TE>   While some players have been known to change addresses just to
have the chance to play on a championship team, Moss thought the more
worthy challenge would be to stay and help his team succeed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fun to win, but I have fun playing," he said. "A win comes
with hard work. Going somewhere else, I don't feel that's very
athlete-like. I stayed to try to make things better and they're
working out."</TE>
<TE>   Moss said the team has complete trust in Gibson to turn around the
Orange program.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone on the team knows where we would be without him," Moss
said. "He's a great coach. He tells us what to do and we do it. He
doesn't have to yell or boss us around. He has the effect where
people want to listen to him.</TE>
<TE>   "He went out of his way to help me, and he didn't have to do it. I
wouldn't have a scholarship to Washington without him."</TE>
<TE>   Moss has rushed for more than 100 yards in all seven Orange games
this season. His best performance was 231 yards against Costa Mesa.
He's averaging 8.5 yards per carry.</TE>
<TE>   He could be a running back, receiver, defensive back or kick
returner in college. He doesn't care. He'll leave it up to the
coaches to determine his best position.</TE>
<TE>   The Washington coaches will soon learn they're gaining more than a
football player. They have discovered a 17-year-old who already
possesses the values to succeed in many phases of life.</TE>
<TE>   "You make your own decisions," Moss said. "People choose to
transfer. I didn't. It's like a job. Why would you quit every other
year? Are you going to do a different job because you like that
better?</TE>
<TE>   "I just feel if you've been in a program, you should stick with
it. A person with a good work ethic who really cares about people
around them will stick with it to make everyone else better."</TE>

<LD>Jack Carava, who is on his way to the Oak Tree training title, will
send out Snoopy Cat in today's third race, which begins a pick six
with a carryover of $81,917, and Sunday In Moscow in the sixth.</LD>
<LD>   Those who bet an all-Carava late pick three Wednesday cashed
thanks to victories by Glitteringmischief, who was winning her fourth
in a row at 4-5, and 6-1 shots Cease Span and Concussion.</LD>
<LD>   Snoopy Cat, the 7-2 second choice on the morning line, is
shortening up and moving to the grass in the third, a $50,000 claimer
for 3-year-olds down Santa Anita's hillside layout. He has a grass
win and should be a late threat under jockey Corey Nakatani.</LD>
<TE>   Three races later, Sunday In Moscow is the 5-2 favorite against
nine other 3-year-olds in the seven-furlong race for $25,000
claimers. He's seeking his first win since being claimed by the barn
for $32,000 on July 29 at Del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The fifth is an interesting 6 1/2-furlong turf
race for 2-year-old maidens and marks the return of Hall of Fame
jockey Julie Krone, who will be riding Justly Royal. The Royal
Academy filly is 8-1 on the morning line.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Warren Stute. The ageless trainer has won with five of
his first 15 starters at Oak Tree.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: John Campo Jr. The New York-based trainer is two for
115 in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Last Tango, the entry of
Revillew Slew-Lunar Surprise and She Rocks in the first, singling
Total Limit in the second and Lou's Expectation, Snoopy Cat and
Saphir Indien in the third.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 3/66. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $20.80/$373. Total money bet: $406.</TE>

<HD>IOC Is Not Renewing Marketing Agreement</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alan Abrahamson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a striking sign of the political machinations marking the
behind-the-scenes action of the organization, the International
Olympic Committee has given notice to its successful marketing
company, Meridian Management, that it does not intend to renew their
deal when the current one is up, at the end of 2004.</LD>
<LD>   The IOC, in a letter signed by President Jacques Rogge, gave
notice about three weeks ago to Meridian, which has offices in
Atlanta and near IOC headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland.</LD>
<LD>   Meridian, created to take over Olympic marketing in 1996 from the
Swiss firm ISL -- which last year declared bankruptcy -- has overseen
tremendous growth in the IOC's first-tier sponsorship program, which
goes by the name TOP.</LD>
<TE>   Seven TOP sponsors -- all big-name corporations such as Coca-Cola
and Samsung -- have already renewed their deals, worth about $65
million for four years, for the period 2005-2008. By comparison, the
U.S. Olympic Committee has signed no new deals for that period.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Meridian's success, the IOC, in the midst of restructuring
and a series of internal audits, has been signaling that it intends
to take as much direct control as possible over its essential
franchise -- the Games.</TE>
<TE>   Against that backdrop, several key IOC managers have been
jockeying for position and influence with Rogge, who took over as
president last year: Thierry Sprunger, the finance manager; Gilbert
Felli, who oversees the sports programs; and marketing director
Michael Payne.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, for instance, the IOC has announced plans to
form its own Olympic broadcast management service. Ending the
Meridian deal would enable the IOC to take its marketing matters
in-house as of 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Payne could not be reached Thursday for comment.</TE>

<HD>Wrist Injury Keeps Deadmarsh Sidelined</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>-- Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Adam Deadmarsh skated with the Kings during practice Thursday
morning, hoping for a sign that he'd be able to play that night
against the Chicago Blackhawks, but his injured right wrist wouldn't
allow it.</LD>
<LD>   "I just went out to see how it would go," a downbeat Deadmarsh
said afterward, his damaged wrist wrapped in tape. "It was sore. I
couldn't really shoot a puck or even make a pass without quite a bit
of pain."</LD>
<LD>   He suffered the injury during Sunday's 5-1 loss to the Columbus
Blue Jackets. "In the middle of the ice," he said, "I ran into a guy
and jammed it." He aggravated it in Tuesday's 4-0 victory over the
Atlanta Thrashers "just pushing with a guy in front of the net," he
said. He played less than eight minutes.</LD>
<TE>   X-rays revealed broken bones, Coach Andy Murray said, but it could
not be determined if the fractures were new or from an older injury.
Deadmarsh is scheduled for an MRI exam today in Los Angeles, Murray
said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, believing a suspension was warranted, were disappointed
that Thrasher defenseman Andy Sutton was not disciplined by the NHL
for the knee-on-knee hit Tuesday that resulted in an injury that is
expected to sideline King center Jason Allison for eight to 12 weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a little surprised," General Manager Dave Taylor said. "The
league's explanation to me was that, in their opinion, there was no
intent to hit Jason with the knee."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bob Miller, the Kings' television play-by-play announcer, will
attend his mother-in-law's funeral Saturday in Elkhorn, Wis., and
will be replaced by Bill Macdonald on the Fox Sports Net telecast of
that night's game against the Nashville Predators at Staples Center.
Viola Loomer died Wednesday. She was 88.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, in his 30th season with the Kings, has not missed a
broadcast since Oct. 26, 1990, when he attended son Kevin's college
graduation.</TE>

<HD>O'Neal Takes Big Step in Recovery</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown and Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal took a significant step in his recovery from toe
surgery Thursday, when he participated for about five minutes in a
light scrimmage at the Laker practice facility in El Segundo.</LD>
<LD>   Afterward, Coach Phil Jackson said the club was not ready to
establish a day for O'Neal's return, but that he is beginning to
consider life with O'Neal again.</LD>
<LD>   "Anything's possible at this point," Jackson said.</LD>
<TE>   Assuming no setbacks and clearance by his physicians, O'Neal would
increase his practice load through next week and then target a return
date.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers play five games in the next eight days, then have three
days off before a home game against Atlanta on Nov. 12.</TE>
<TE>   Uncomfortable with the Lakers' 0-2 start, O'Neal had asked Jackson
if he should consider hastening his rehabilitation schedule. Jackson
told him that the team's record "can't be a motivator."</TE>
<TE>   Asked how O'Neal looked on the floor, Jackson said, "Big. He's
big."</TE>
<TE>   Five minutes at a light jog wasn't much, but it was as close as
the Lakers had been to whole since Game 4 of the NBA Finals, and
O'Neal was drenched in sweat by the time reporters were allowed into
the gym.</TE>
<TE>   "Spiritually, it lifts the team up a little bit," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant, who sprained his right ankle Wednesday night in
Portland, and Devean George, who sprained his left ankle in the same
quarter, practiced as well, as did Mark Madsen, on the injured list
recovering from a strained hamstring.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a little sore, but I wanted to practice anyway," Bryant
said. "I wanted to send my teammates a message that even if you're
hurt, you have to practice."</TE>
<TE>   George has two sore ankles and stayed with Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't let people think he's tougher than me," George said.</TE>
<TE>   Both are expected to play against the Clippers tonight.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal must be on the injured list at least three more games, and
probably will be longer, but Bryant appreciated his presence anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt good to pass to somebody under the basket who can do
something with it," Bryant said, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Upon further review, Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry was still steamed
about his team's inability to beat the Cleveland Cavaliers to loose
balls during Wednesday's loss to open the season.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry said the Clippers must win the "hustle plays" in order to
be the team so many people believe they can be this season.</TE>
<TE>   He expects the Clippers to be at their best -- mentally at least
-- against the Lakers tonight. They won't be at full strength until
small forward Lamar Odom has recovered from a sprained right ankle.
Odom is expected to be out for at least the next month and perhaps
longer.</TE>
<TE>   "I told our guys today, 'If I have to ask you to play hard, if I
have to talk about effort in this game, then you're in the wrong
sport,' " Gentry told reporters after Thursday's practice. "It
doesn't matter who's out there. It still says 'Lakers' on the jerseys
and they'll still the three-time NBA champs."</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   Lakers vs. Clippers</TE>
<TE>   7:30, Channel 9</TE>
<TE>   Site -- Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Radio -- KLAC (570), KXTA (1150), KIRN 670 (Farsi), KWKW 1330
(Spanish).</TE>
<TE>   Records -- Lakers 0-2, Clippers 0-1.</TE>
<TE>   Season series (2001-02) -- Lakers, 3-1.</TE>
<TE>   Update -- Laker forward Rick Fox will be serving the third game of
his six-game suspension for fighting with Sacramento's Doug Christie
in an exhibition last week. The Clippers are as fit as they're going
to be for the moment. Elton Brand was ineffective in his first game
since undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery Sept. 26, failing to score
in 27 minutes in the loss to the Cavaliers. Gentry is still tinkering
with his rotation and could start Eric Piatkowski instead of Quentin
Richardson at shooting guard. Piatkowski is better as a starter and
Richardson has been superb as a sixth man.</TE>

<HD>Dykstra's Care Might Have Been Covered</HD>
<DH>The comatose La Verne quarterback probably had access to
insurance. Yet those close to him say he reported headaches to staff
but went untreated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lance Pugmire</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If, as the father and girlfriend of comatose Rollie Dykstra have
said, the injured University of La Verne quarterback was having
constant headaches before he suffered a brain injury Oct. 19 in a
game against Redlands, there was insurance in effect that would have
allowed for treatment, according to sources familiar with medical
coverage available to NCAA Division III athletes.</LD>
<LD>   Roland Dykstra Sr. and Jennifer Ross maintain that the senior
quarterback complained to them of severe headaches and have accused
La Verne athletic officials of having denied him medical treatment.</LD>
<LD>   The senior Dykstra said he has retained attorney Martin Cervantes
of Ontario to investigate the matter.</LD>
<TE>   The dispute hinges on two questions:</TE>
<TE>   * Did La Verne trainer Jim May tell Dykstra it would be best to
monitor the headaches at the college because of possible high
expenses involved in medical treatment for a head injury?</TE>
<TE>   Ross said that's what Dykstra told her.</TE>
<TE>   "That would be a profoundly stupid thing [for a trainer] to say,"
said an NCAA official.</TE>
<TE>   * Or did Dykstra, who had nailed down the starting quarterback's
job only two games earlier, downplay his condition to coaches and
trainers so he could keep his starting role and play in the game
against his hometown college, Redlands?</TE>
<TE>   "We have independent witnesses, outside of the family, who've said
Rollie made it clear to the trainers that he was having problems and
no one offered him any help," Cervantes said. "There was a breakdown.
It will take a little bit to sort this out."</TE>
<TE>   How treatment could have been denied is puzzling to those in
Division III. Athletes typically have three or more layers of
insurance, said Charles Katsiaficas, athletic director at
Pomona-Pitzer, a Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic
Conference rival of La Verne's.</TE>
<TE>   A La Verne official confirmed that tuition for full-time students,
which costs $19,500, includes a student accident and sickness
insurance plan underwritten by Guarantee Trust Life Insurance Co. of
Glenview, Ill. Dykstra is a full-time student.</TE>
<TE>   Among other benefits, the policy provides as much as $750 for a
hospital X-ray examination and is intended to complement coverage
most students have through parents' policies, a La Verne official
said.</TE>
<TE>   Because of his age, Dykstra, 24, had no coverage through his
parents, Ross said.</TE>
<TE>   A university spokeswoman said, however, that La Verne athletes are
also covered by liability insurance purchased by the university to
pay for injuries suffered in training or competition.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from three SCIAC universities said policies vary from
school to school, but noted that there had been substantial increases
in insurance premiums this year as a result of 9/11. Kirk Jones,
Pomona-Pitzer's head trainer, said athletes at his university were
responsible for paying a one-time-only deductible of $500 on claims.
Jones added that if an athlete were experiencing financial hardship,
the university would pay the deductible.</TE>
<TE>   La Verne officials, sensitive to potential litigation in the
Dykstra case, refused to confirm many details about their
university's athletic insurance, although three sources in the
athletic department said athletes were not responsible for paying
deductibles.</TE>
<TE>   Ross said that Dykstra had received free medical treatment for a
sprained foot earlier in the season.</TE>
<TE>   "To my knowledge, he didn't pay anything," she said. "[La Verne]
covered it."</TE>
<TE>   Doctors treating Dykstra at Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center
have not said whether he'd suffered second-impact syndrome -- serious
head trauma after a previous head injury -- or if he had endured a
previous concussion before being knocked out of the game against
Redlands.</TE>
<TE>   Dykstra remains in serious condition, on a respirator.</TE>
<TE>   His injury probably will require La Verne to call upon the NCAA's
catastrophic-injury insurance program, which covers claims of $50,000
or more.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA spokesman Wallace Renfro said the policy costs $9 million a
year and is paid for from all revenues, which include membership dues
from Division III universities.</TE>
<TE>   "The NCAA does not require institutions to carry insurance for
their athletes in practice and competition, but most do, and our
management council will probably soon propose that institutions look
to go beyond that -- to workouts, official or not," Renfro said.</TE>
<TE>   What haunts Ross and the Division III athletic officials is the
thought that Dykstra's tragedy, and the medical expenses, might have
been avoided.</TE>
<TE>   "Rollie said he told [La Verne trainers] about his headaches, and
I believed him," Ross said. "I have no idea what was said, but he
told me they were aware. He told me his head was bothering him even
when he threw the ball [in practices], and in the days before the
game he seemed listless and tired. I noticed it. I would have thought
they'd notice it."</TE>
<TE>   La Verne Coach Don Morel has said Dykstra told him he was
experiencing a minor headache Oct. 7, two days after the team's 30-6
loss at Cal Lutheran. Morel said that because of other injuries, he
ordered non-contact drills through a bye week until the Oct. 19
Redlands game.</TE>
<TE>   Cervantes said he is gathering evidence from La Verne and the NCAA
and described his case as "the first phase of litigation."</TE>
<TE>   He is also investigating the use of emergency personnel at La
Verne and possible equipment failure, particularly with Dykstra's
helmet.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot here that does not look right," Cervantes said.
"It's a question of confirming it, and seeing how Rollie improves in
the next months."</TE>
<TE>   A source familiar with La Verne's athletic department said
university trainers have a concussion-prevention program, and a
trainer at a SCIAC school said treatment of concussions was handled
routinely. Trainers customarily adhere to concussion guidelines of
the American Academy of Neurology, and typically send symptomatic
players to team physicians to arrange neurological exams or CT scans.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't imagine the trainer would let [Dykstra] play [if he'd
known of a concussion]," said a SCIAC athletic official who requested
anonymity. "It's not like the players are going pro, that they really
need the game to prove themselves, or that it's a big game like they
have at UCLA or Michigan. The rules are pretty simple: If he's
symptomatic, he doesn't play."</TE>

<HD>Massachusetts Becomes First to Banish Metal Bats</HD>
<DH>Beginning in the spring of 2003, aluminum will no longer be
used in the state's high school games.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Mehren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Massachusetts on Thursday became the first state to ban aluminum
baseball bats in high school competition, beginning with the spring
2003 postseason tournament.</LD>
<LD>   Following prolonged discussion, the baseball committee of the
Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Committee voted, 9-6, to ban
the metal bats and recommended that wooden bats be used at all levels
of play beginning in 2004. The committee's recommendation will be
discussed at a Dec. 3 meeting of the full state association, which
could vote on it at that time or decide to vote on it next year.</LD>
<LD>   The vote was prompted by concern over injuries caused by line
drives that can fly off metal bats at 100 mph or more.</LD>
<TE>   Beginning in the mid-1970s, aluminum and alloy bats grew in
popularity, driven by cost-effectiveness -- they do not split on
contact -- and by delivering greater power than wooden bats.</TE>
<TE>   Manufacturers say that no studies have shown the aluminum bats to
be more dangerous than wooden ones. Jim Darby, vice president of
Easton Sports in Van Nuys, said before Thursday's vote that the
safety question surrounding metal baseball bats "has been answered"
in numerous tests.</TE>
<TE>   Regulations in recent years have limited the size of the barrel of
aluminum bats to 2 5/8 inches as well as the length-to-weight ratio,
which cannot exceed three (a 33-inch-long bat must weigh at least 30
ounces). Tests have shown these restrictions limit a batted ball's
speed to 97 mph, the same exit speed for a major league wooden bat.</TE>
<TE>   However, a study by the National Institute for Sports Science and
Safety in Providence, R.I., concluded that in some cases, balls
travel faster off metal bats. Rick Greenwald, the institute's vice
president, said the studies did not show the metal bats produce more
injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Roby, director of the Center for the Study of Sport and
Society at Boston's Northeastern University, expressed concern that
the cost of regularly replacing cracked wooden bats could jeopardize
the sport in less affluent areas.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope it doesn't end up impacting peoples' opportunity to
provide equipment," Roby said. "But at the other end of the argument,
there certainly is the safety factor. If it's only one child a year
who is injured, that's too many."</TE>
<TE>   Baseball Coach Manny Alvarado of Granada Hills Kennedy High was on
the national committee that studied aluminum bat safety and made
recommendations for the restrictions put in place in 2001. He
believes that aluminum bats are safe and that it would be difficult
for schools to provide wooden bats.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's a safety issue there," Alvarado said. "When
we first started studying [aluminum bats], the manufacturers were on
the verge of producing bats that were too powerful, but we stopped
that [with the 2001 regulations]."</TE>

<HD>Jordan Shakes Rust, Celtics in Big Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Never before in their 56-year history have the Boston Celtics been
beaten so badly.</LD>
<LD>   And who was on the other end of the 45-point loss? Michael Jordan,
who suddenly doesn't look so old after all.</LD>
<LD>   Shaking off a rusty performance that made him look all of his 39
years the night before, Jordan scored 21 points in 21 minutes and
ignited a rout with a four-point flourish at the end of the first
half as the Wizards beat the Celtics, 114-69, Thursday night at
Washington.</LD>
<TE>   "In terms of what we all envisioned, in putting this team
together, tonight it worked perfectly," said Jordan. "I'd like to
have about 55 more like this."</TE>
<TE>   Boston's previous worst regular-season loss was 44 points, 128-84
at Portland on Jan. 4, 1977. It was the third-largest margin of
victory in Wizard history.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan scored only eight points and missed a dunk in the second
half of Wednesday's season-opening loss at Toronto. He had more
points than that in the second half against the Celtics. For the
game, he was eight for 15 from the field and five for five from the
free-throw line and had four rebounds and five assists.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Stackhouse had 22 points and 10 assists for Washington.
Kwame Brown, a disappointment as the No. 1 overall pick in the draft
last season, had four blocked shots in the first quarter and finished
with 20 points, six rebounds and a career-high six blocks.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento 100, Portland 72 -- Peja Stojakovic scored 26 points
and Bobby Jackson had 20 points and 10 rebounds as the Kings overcame
the absence of three starters to win at Sacramento. The Kings played
without Chris Webber, Mike Bibby and Doug Christie -- three starters
from last season's Pacific Division championship team. Webber was
held out after he had strained lower abdominal muscles at the team's
shoot-around. Christie finished his two-game suspension for a
preseason fight with the Lakers' Rick Fox and Bibby is sidelined by a
foot injury.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 105, Utah 98 -- Glenn Robinson scored 30 points and Jason
Terry had 21 points and a career-high 13 assists as the Hawks won
their home opener. Shareef Abdur-Rahim, who missed the opener because
of a sore back, scored 10 of Atlanta's points in a 15-6 run at the
start of the third quarter that broke the game open.</TE>

<LD>The Atlanta Hawks put reserve center Nazr Mohammed on the injured
list because of a stress fracture in his right foot and signed
free-agent forward Amal McCaskill on Thursday. Mohammed is expected
to be out four to six weeks.</LD>
<LD>   McCaskill was waived earlier this week by Portland. He averaged
3.8 points and 2.6 rebounds in five exhibition games with the Trail
Blazers.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   The Indiana Pacers signed forwards Ron Artest and Jonathan Bender
to contract extensions, just beating the NBA's Thursday night
deadline. Artest's deal is for six years and $42 million, according
to his agent. Pacer president Donnie Walsh said the extensions were
multiyear deals but didn't give any details. Without the extensions,
Artest and Bender would have become restricted free agents after this
season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Orlando Magic forward Horace Grant could be out until December
because his left knee has not healed from arthroscopic surgery he had
almost seven weeks ago. Grant said he would sit out as long as it
takes to fully recover, which he said could take from 10 days to a
month.... The Golden State Warriors signed forward-center Guy Rucker.
Rucker, 6 feet 11, was cut by the Lakers Monday.</TE>

<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Life without Jason Allison began uneasily Thursday night for the
Kings, who tried to win with one goal and almost pulled it off.</LD>
<LD>   The Chicago Blackhawks, however, took advantage of two late King
penalties, scored the tying goal with 35 seconds to play in the third
period, the winner 94 seconds into overtime and sent the Kings home
from a five-game trip with an improbable 2-1 loss.</LD>
<LD>   King Coach Andy Murray stared out onto the ice at the United
Center for nearly a minute afterward, unwilling for a moment to
accept his fate.</LD>
<TE>   "You want your players to be rewarded because they battled so
hard," he said. "It would have been nice to see them walk out of here
with a 1-0 win."</TE>
<TE>   It almost happened.</TE>
<TE>   But with Allison, their scoring leader, presumably watching at
home in Manhattan Beach, his injured right knee on ice, and Adam
Deadmarsh also sidelined because of a right wrist injury, King
defenseman Chris McAlpine gave his former teammates a chance.</TE>
<TE>   McAlpine, who signed with the Kings in July after two seasons with
the Blackhawks, was whistled for holding winger Mark Bell at 17:22 of
the third period.</TE>
<TE>   "He was swiping at the puck and I was just jamming his stick,"
said McAlpine, who had barely stepped out of the penalty box and back
onto the ice when Tyler Arnason scored after a scramble in front of
the net, tying the score at 19:25.</TE>
<TE>   Only 28 seconds into overtime, King defenseman Andreas Lilja was
sent off for hooking Arnason, leading to the game-winning power-play
goal by Phil Housley, whose shot from the slot glanced off goaltender
Felix Potvin's glove.</TE>
<TE>   Potvin, screened on the plays, saw neither shot coming at him.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a good trip," he said of the Kings' 2-1-1-1 journey, "but
it's disappointing to lose a game like this. Any time you lose a lead
with [35] seconds left and you lose in OT, especially to a team in
your conference, it's disappointing."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, Murray had insisted earlier, can survive and even
thrive without Allison, as they did for long stretches last season
without Mathieu Schneider and Ziggy Palffy, and as they have this
season without Aaron Miller.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to really be careful that we don't let this Jason Allison
thing take on a life of its own," the coach said. "This happens all
the time. Players get hurt all the time. He's not here. Let's not
worry about it. Let's move on....</TE>
<TE>   "We'll hang in there every game and try to find a way to get our
points. We're trying not to make too big a deal out of it. He's hurt.
He's gone. We'll talk to him when he gets back. That's just the way
it is."</TE>
<TE>   In Allison's absence, Murray shuffled his forward lines. Bryan
Smolinski skated on the top line between Erik Rasmussen and rookie
Alexander Frolov, Eric Belanger on the second unit between Jaroslav
Bednar and Palffy, who was back in the lineup after sitting out six
of the previous seven games because of a strained groin.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, however, managed only a power-play goal by defenseman
Jaroslav Modry, whose shot from the left faceoff circle slipped
between the pads of goaltender Jocelyn Thibault at 7:07 of the second
period with Alex Zhamnov in the penalty box for hooking Palffy.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't quite enough.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is, those guys are out of the lineup and we don't
think too much about it," Schneider said, referring to Allison and
Deadmarsh. "We're trying to win with what we've got. I thought the
guys did a real good job tonight of playing the system. We had some
good chances, but we didn't capitalize.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a tough way to lose a game. It's disappointing. We were
fortunate we got the point out of it, but we've got to learn from it
as well."</TE>

<HD>Zholtok's Overtime Goal Gives Wild Another Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sergei Zholtok scored his second goal with 9.1 seconds left in
overtime to give the Minnesota Wild a 2-1 victory over the San Jose
Sharks at St. Paul, Minn.</LD>
<LD>   Wes Walz's cross-checking penalty with 1:03 left in regulation
gave the slumping Sharks a power play for nearly the first minute of
overtime, but the Wild killed it.</LD>
<LD>   Minnesota (8-1-2) -- which leads the NHL with 18 points after
finishing last in the Northwest Division last season -- was headed
for its third tie with less than 10 seconds remaining, but Zholtok
caught up with a loose puck and sent it past San Jose goalie Evgeni
Nabokov.</LD>
<TE>   Colorado 5, Vancouver 1 -- Joe Sakic scored twice, including one
only 32 seconds into the game, to help the Avalanche win at
Vancouver, British Columbia. Dan Hinote, Adam Foote and Rob Blake
also scored for the Avalanche, which won for the second time in six
games, but has points in all but one game this season. Patrick Roy
stopped 23 shots.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 3, Toronto 3 -- Reserve goalie Pasi Nurminen had 32 saves
as the winless Thrashers avoided their 10th consecutive loss, getting
the tie at Toronto. Patrik Stefan scored the tying goal at 15:26 of
the third period for Thrashers, who are in a 19-game winless streak
dating to March 23.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 6, Phoenix 2 -- Michal Handzus and Kim Johnsson
scored 2:05 apart in the second period, helping the Flyers come back
from a 2-1 deficit to win at Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Calgary 3, Buffalo 0 -- Roman Turek made 30 saves and Jarome
Iginla had a goal and an assist to lead the Flames to their first
home win in six games this season at Calgary, Alberta.</TE>

<KH>PACIFIC 10 CHRIS DUFRESNE</KH>
<HD>For Once, Pullman Is the Place to Be</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like most of you, I've had Washington State-Arizona State circled on
my Pacific 10 pocket calendar for, what, hours?</LD>
<LD>   Never in your wildest dreams could one imagine in August that
Saturday's game in Pullman, Wash., would mean so much for both
schools and maybe for USC.</LD>
<LD>   Washington State we knew about because us media types are deft at
switching stories so long as we eventually look good in print.</LD>
<TE>   Last year, Washington State was picked to finish last and ended up
10-2. The only thing the scribes got right was the Cougars playing
home games in Pullman.</TE>
<TE>   This year, naturally, the media tabbed Washington State to win the
conference, but fumbled on Arizona State, an allegedly going-nowhere
program led by a second-year coach with a name, Dirk Koetter, that
sounded so phony it could have served as a pseudonym for any B-actor
in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Updated media poll-taking scoreboard: Wrong on Washington State
last year, wrong this time on Arizona State, picked to finish ninth.</TE>
<TE>   As it worked out, this weekend's game pits the Pac-10's lone
unbeaten schools in a matchup so huge ABC's Keith Jackson would have
come out of retirement to broadcast it, if he hadn't already done so.</TE>
<TE>   Do not adjust your television sets or those Pac-10 standings,
Washington State is 4-0 in conference and 7-1 overall while Arizona
State is 4-0 and 7-2.</TE>
<TE>   This week, in Pullman, fans waited in line for hours to snag
remaining seats in cozy, 37,600-seat Martin Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "This town is just jumping," Coach Mike Price said. "ABC's here,
Keith Jackson's here, we're rocking."</TE>
<TE>   Of the two teams, Arizona State is toughest to get a read on. The
Sun Devils opened with a thud at Nebraska, rebounded to win four in a
row, including a 41-point victory over Stanford, then lost at home to
North Carolina (2-6 overall and a 31-0 loser to Wake Forest last
week).</TE>
<TE>   The Tar Heel defeat nearly sent Koetter to the not-so-funny farm.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be honest with you," he said, "I was the one going in the
wrong direction because I was in the tank longer after that loss than
probably any loss we've suffered in a long time. I felt horrible
after the North Carolina game. I think the players are the ones that
got me out of the tank more than me getting them out."</TE>
<TE>   Since, Arizona State has ripped off victories against Oregon,
Oregon State and Washington and has a chance Saturday to get one step
closer to the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, down south, enjoying the peace of an off week, USC
Coach Pete Carroll and his players will be rooting vociferously for
Arizona State.</TE>
<TE>   Some have suggested temporarily changing the name of that famous
statue in the campus quad to Tommy Tempe.</TE>
<TE>   And while it's a little early to get into all the possibilities,
we here at Scenario Central can offer at least one.</TE>
<TE>   If Arizona State defeats Washington State, and USC beats Arizona
State on Nov. 16, and the schools end up in a three-way tie for the
conference lead at 7-1, and USC defeats Notre Dame on Nov. 30, USC
goes to the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   How simple is that?</TE>
<TE>   The Pac-10 champion is determined by a points system if the issue
can't be settled by a head-to-head tiebreaker. A team gets four
points for a conference win, three points for a nonconference win
against a Division I-A opponent and two points for a nonconference
victory against a Division I-AA team.</TE>
<TE>   If you tally the points in our mock draft, USC gets 37 while
Washington State and Arizona State end up tied at 36 because both
played Division I-AA opponents.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State wins the tiebreaker with Washington State because,
in this scenario, it beat the Cougars. That would leave USC and
Arizona State, with the Trojans getting the nod for having won the
head-to-head.</TE>
<TE>   A USC loss to Notre Dame, however, knocks the Trojans out of
Pasadena and puts Arizona State in.</TE>
<TE>   Stay tuned for more tiebreaker bamboozlers.</TE>
<TE>   Pac Bits</TE>
<TE>   More fun with scenarios: Do you think a USC vs. Notre Dame rematch
in the Rose Bowl would draw any interest? It is one of several
possibilities still in play. Say USC wins the Pac-10 title in the
scenario we proposed, highlighted by a season-ending victory against
11-0 Notre Dame. If a 13-0 Ohio State ends up No. 1 or No. 2 in the
bowl championship series rankings, the Buckeyes have to play in the
Fiesta Bowl, leaving the Rose Bowl with the option of filling the Big
Ten's slot with any BCS-eligible at-large school.</TE>
<TE>   If USC wins out but loses the Pac-10 title to Washington State,
the Trojans are going to be a rock-solid candidate for one of two
at-large BCS berths. Still, you'd have to rate USC's chances as
longshot for the usual geopolitical reasons.</TE>
<TE>   First, Notre Dame probably would secure one of the two at-large
spots, leaving several possible candidates to grapple for the other
berth: one-loss Miami, Virginia Tech, Texas, Ohio State or maybe
Georgia. Second, with the Fiesta Bowl hosting this year's national
title game, USC could go only to Sugar or Orange bowls, which haven't
traditionally courted Pac-10 teams.</TE>
<TE>   It was tough enough two years ago for the Pac-10 to get Oregon
State placed in the West-Coast friendly Fiesta Bowl, Pac-10
Commissioner Tom Hansen threatening withdrawal from the BCS if the
Fiesta didn't take the Beavers. USC packs a much more powerful
national punch, and there are scenarios in which the Sugar or Orange
would be forced to take the 10-2 Trojans, but don't hold your breath.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State defensive end Terrell Suggs leads the nation with
17.5 sacks and has a good chance to eclipse the Pac-10 record of 19.</TE>

<HD>Sandhu Leads the Hard Way</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>QUEBEC CITY, Canada</DL>
<LD>While figure skating experiments with new judging and scoring
systems, Emanuel Sandhu earned the lead in the Skate Canada men's
competition Thursday the old-fashioned way: by performing a difficult
and dynamic program that brought the crowd at the Colisee Pepsi to
its feet.</LD>
<LD>   The 21-year-old Canadian landed a fine quadruple toe loop-triple
toe loop combination jump in his short program, the first phase of
the men's event. Under the interim judging system in use this season,
10 judges are chosen at random and a computer randomly selects seven
marks to determine each part of the score. A range of marks is
displayed without correlating them to judges; Sandhu's marks for
required elements ranged from 5.3 to 5.8 and for presentation from
5.6 to 5.9.</LD>
<LD>   The system has been criticized for giving judges anonymity, but
Sandhu didn't mind. "That was never my concern," he said. "I'm happy
I skated well. This is another step up for me."</LD>
<TE>   Takeshi Honda of Japan was second, followed by Stanick Jeannette
of France. Derrick Delmore and Ryan Bradley of the U.S. were seventh
and eighth, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Although the competition's luster was dimmed when Olympic gold
medalists Sarah Hughes and Alexei Yagudin and bronze medalist Tim
Goebel withdrew because of injuries, it's noteworthy as a testing
ground for a proposed cumulative scoring system. As proposed, 14
judges give skaters points based on predetermined values of elements,
but only seven judges' marks will count. That panel won't determine
the winners here, but the system will be evaluated later.</TE>
<TE>   Tatiana Totmianina and Maxim Marinin of Russia, fourth at the
Olympics and second at the world championships, lead the pairs event,
ahead of Qing Pang and Jian Tong of China and Anabelle Langlois and
Patrice Archetto of Canada.</TE>
<TE>   In ice dancing, Elena Grushina and Ruslan Goncharov of Ukraine
were the leaders after the compulsory dance.</TE>

<LD>Brookside Golf Course in Pasadena would normally be a nice spot for
weekend duffers who want to get in a round or two.</LD>
<LD>   They'll be pushed aside Saturday by an invasion of collegiate
cross country runners and their followers. Brookside, just north of
the Rose Bowl, is the site of the Pacific 10 Conference
championships.</LD>
<LD>   National power Stanford is expected to defend its men's and
women's conference titles. But UCLA, hosting the event for the first
time, may push the Cardinal on the women's side with a talented team.</LD>
<TE>   Junior Lena Nilsson could contend for individual honors. Last
month, she ran a school-record 6,000-meter time of 20 minutes 28.2
seconds to finish eighth in the NCAA Preview Meet at Terre Haute,
Ind.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at the women's side, you have Stanford's girls in
Lauren Fleshman, Alicia Craig, Malindi Moore and Sara Bei and then
Lena Nilsson, who clearly showed she could run right with them," UCLA
Coach Eric Peterson said. "On the right day, any one of those kids
can win the meet."</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins will also rely on sophomore Alejandra Barrientos and
freshman Jenna Timinsky. With those runners and talented freshmen
Allison Hall and Sarah West, UCLA ispositioned as a potential top-10
team.</TE>

<TE>   The top-ranked USC women's volleyball team will put its undefeated
record on the line Saturday night when the Trojans (18-0, 11-0) host
sixth-ranked and defending national champion Stanford in a Pac-10
match.</TE>
<TE>   It is a rematch of the Trojans' thrilling five-game victory Oct. 4
at Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   That night, USC rallied from a 14-9 deficit in the fifth game to
end the Cardinal's 26-match home winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford (19-3, 7-2) has a 42-14-1 advantage in the all-time
series, but USC has won four of the last five meetings.</TE>

<TE>   Pepperdine achieved a first in the 10-year history of its women's
soccer program with its first consensus top-10 national ranking after
defeating Santa Clara and San Diego last weekend.</TE>
<TE>   The Waves, ranked eighth in both the Soccer Buzz and National
Soccer Coaches Assn. of America polls and ninth by Soccer America,
became the first West Coast Conference team to defeat powerful
Portland and Santa Clara in the same season.</TE>
<TE>   Ali Pavoni (nine goals, four assists), Jenna Fodor (eight goals,
six assists) and Lacey Ubaldi (seven goals, eight assists) are tied
for second in the conference in scoring with 22 points, leading the
Waves to a program-best 14-1-2 record.</TE>

<LD>With a free weekend facing idle USC, Coach Pete Carroll used the
recent problems of another Pacific 10 Conference team to warn his
players about staying out of trouble until they return to practice
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "We saw a lot of problems at Washington State, just in a flash,"
Carroll said after the Trojans' final practice of the week Thursday.
"And it can happen to you."</LD>
<LD>   Washington State, which plays host to Arizona State Saturday in a
battle for first place in the Pac-10, lost two defensive starters
this week after a locker-room fight sidelined cornerback Jason David
with a broken cheekbone and led to the indefinite suspension of
linebacker Ira Davis.</LD>
<TE>   "I did use it as an example," Carroll said. "They lost two guys
with one punch."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said he's hopeful his players will show good judgment
during their three days off. USC's next game is Nov. 9 at Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope all the time we spend together and the things that we do
and the way that we think as a team will help us make good
decisions," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC wrapped up practice Thursday with an intrasquad scrimmage that
Carroll dubbed the Halloween Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Appropriately enough, it got off to a frightening start when
offensive guard Chris Doyle was injured on the first play. Doyle, a
freshman expected to redshirt this season, limped off the field and
was treated on the sideline for what Carroll described as a sprained
left knee.</TE>
<TE>   Things went smoother during the rest of the scrimmage, which
featured reserves and players expected to redshirt.</TE>
<TE>   Among the most impressive was linebacker Frostee Rucker, who is
sitting out the season after transferring from Colorado State. The
6-foot-4, 240-pound Rucker made two tackles for losses and batted
away a pass that he nearly intercepted.</TE>
<TE>   "It was good to be able to get some reps," Rucker said. "It's been
hard just being on the scout team for the second year in a row. It's
not the life for me. I don't like that."</TE>
<TE>   Rucker, a former standout at Tustin High, redshirted last season
as a freshman at Colorado State. He left the school after pleading
guilty to a misdemeanor harassment charge.</TE>
<TE>   Though Rucker said he enjoys being at USC, he doesn't like
watching games.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very frustrating, especially when I watch the TV and see my
friends back in Colorado playing," he said. "Pretty soon it's going
to be my turn. I've just got to wait patiently."</TE>
<TE>   Another player waiting his turn is freshman offensive tackle Kyle
Williams, who is expected to redshirt. He said the scrimmage was a
chance to "hit some people and have some fun." The 6-6, 280-pound
Williams was an All-American at Dallas Highland Park High.</TE>

<HD>Boy's Life Support Ordered Removed</HD>
<DH>Judge stays ruling so Anaheim infant's father, who is
facing abuse charge, can file appeal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stuart Pfeifer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County judge on Thursday ordered doctors to shut down
life-support machines that are keeping a gravely injured Anaheim
infant alive, a decision that could ultimately lead to a murder
charge against the boy's father.</LD>
<LD>   The parents of Christopher Ibarra have fought over the boy's fate
for the last 10 months. His mother, Tamara Sepulveda, asked the judge
to allow her 14-month-old son, who suffered severe brain injuries
last year, to die.</LD>
<LD>   His father, Moises Ibarra, who is awaiting trial for allegedly
causing the boy's injuries, wanted his son to remain on life support.</LD>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Richard Behn announced his decision in a
hushed Orange courtroom about six miles from a Tustin hospital where
Christopher lay motionless under fluorescent lights, machines pumping
food and oxygen into his tiny, swollen body.</TE>
<TE>   The judge based his ruling on testimony from doctors who said they
hold no hope for recovery. They said the boy is so fragile that his
hips have become displaced and chores as simple as changing his
diaper have broken his bones.</TE>
<TE>   "All the life-sustaining treatment is doing is keeping this shell
of what used to be Christopher alive," the judge said.</TE>
<TE>   Acknowledging the weighty legal issues behind the decision, the
judge suspended his order to allow Moises Ibarra to file an appeal.
If the child lives that long, the case will probably end up before
the state Supreme Court and, perhaps, the U.S. Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Not just Christopher's fate hinges on the outcome of the court
battle. Prosecutors have said that if Christopher dies, they almost
certainly will pursue a murder charge against his father.</TE>
<TE>   Moises Ibarra, 24, was arrested Dec. 20 and charged with felony
child abuse for allegedly slamming his son's head into his crib,
causing the brain injury.</TE>
<TE>   Ibarra's attorney said he was disappointed by the judge's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Ibarra loves his son and was hoping one day he might
recover," said Assistant Public Defender David Dworakowski, noting
his client has denied hurting the baby. "He's devastated by the
court's ruling."</TE>
<TE>   Sepulveda told reporters outside the courthouse that she hopes the
judge's ruling will one day allow her son "to go to heaven."</TE>
<TE>   "He's not there. He's not the same child he was before," said
Sepulveda, who wore a "Prevent Child Abuse" pin on her lapel. "I'm
not angry. I'm just hurt. I'm miserable this whole thing happened."</TE>
<TE>   Behn ordered doctors to remove a ventilator that helps the boy
breathe but said he wants them to continue providing food, water and
pain medication. At last week's hearing, one doctor testified that he
would consider it cruel to cut off food, leaving the child to starve
to death.</TE>
<TE>   The doctors also testified that Christopher lies motionless most
of the day.</TE>
<TE>   The only response he gives to pain or light is an increased heart
rate, sweating and tightening of his muscles. They could not predict
how long the boy could survive without a ventilator but said he has
breathed on his own for several minutes at a time.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys say it could take at least three months before the issue
is resolved on appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers and legal experts praised the judge for staying his order
until higher courts have a chance to review the case.</TE>
<TE>   "This is like an execution. All Behn is saying is, 'This is
uncharted territory. What if the Court of Appeal disagrees with me
and by the time they intervene the baby's dead?' " said Richard
Schwartzberg, an Orange County lawyer who specializes in appeals
cases. "This is a life we're talking about. That makes perfect
sense."</TE>
<TE>   Sepulveda's lawyer said she expects the decision to be upheld.</TE>
<TE>   "The judge really backed up the decision he made," said attorney
Donna Chirco. "I don't see why a different court would overturn him."</TE>
<TE>   Moises Ibarra, held at Orange County Jail, is scheduled to stand
trial on felony child abuse charge in January. Even if he is
convicted of child abuse and sentenced to prison, prosecutors could
step in months or years later and charge him with murder if the boy
dies, attorneys said.</TE>
<TE>   Dworakowski said his client will be acquitted at trial and pointed
out that the facts of the case are far from clear.</TE>
<TE>   At a hearing this year, Sepulveda--who has a learning
disability--said she caused her son's injuries. She later said she
misunderstood the question.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about those statements at a later hearing, the mother
invoked her 5th Amendment protections from self-incrimination.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot more to this story than has been published in the
press ....My client looks forward to his trial," Dworakowski said.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Billboard Fees Are Blocked</HD>
<DH>A federal judge rules they violate free-speech rights. The
city could lose about $3 million a year in revenue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Rosenzweig</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citing free speech guarantees, a federal judge has blocked the city
of Los Angeles from collecting more than $3 million in annual fees
from owners of outdoor billboards.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson said in a 17-page ruling
made public Thursday that two billboard ordinances enacted earlier
this year violate the 1st Amendment.</LD>
<LD>   The ordinances, he said, favor commercial over noncommercial signs
and regulate noncommercial signs based on their content, a clear
violation of the U.S. Constitution.</LD>
<TE>   He also said the ordinances are unconstitutionally vague and would
cause serious harm to those affected.</TE>
<TE>   "The only hardship the city will suffer is lost revenue, which can
be recouped if the ordinances are ultimately found to be
constitutional," wrote Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   "We're disappointed in the judge's ruling," said Cecilia Estolano,
a special assistant to City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo. "This ordinance
is an important tool to enforce our billboard regulations. We think
we have a very strong case for appeal to the 9th Circuit [Court of
Appeals]."</TE>
<TE>   Three media conglomerates, Clear Channel Outdoor Inc., Viacom
Outdoor Inc. and National Advertising Co., had sought the preliminary
injunction against the ordinances, which were set to take effect
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Kendall, who represented the three billboard companies,
said his clients were gratified by the judge's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   At issue was a $314-per-sign fee the city imposed for annual
inspections of about 10,000 billboards throughout Los Angeles. Viacom
and Clear Channel control about 40% of those signs, which carry
commercial and noncommercial messages. Wilson said that a sign with a
noncommercial message is more likely to be subject to a fee because
of the nature of the message.</TE>
<TE>   "For example," he wrote, "a restaurant can erect a sign related to
the restaurant 'Eat at Joe's Cafe' but will be subject to the ... fee
if the restaurant decides to erect a noncommercial sign, such as
'Save the Whales' or 'Say No to Drugs.' "</TE>
<TE>   The judge also expressed puzzlement over the purpose of the
ordinances, which the city building code says are supposed to protect
the city's aesthetics and ensure public safety.</TE>
<TE>   Imposing a fee on certain sign structures based on their content
will do nothing to achieve either goal, Wilson said.</TE>
<TE>   He also cited an admission by the city's chief enforcer that Los
Angeles has about 60,000 illegal signs on the premises of businesses
that are not regulated by the ordinances.</TE>
<TE>   "The ordinances are not the most direct approach to solving the
city's problems," Wilson said. "The ordinances do not prohibit signs,
but rather impose a fee on certain signs and not on others."</TE>
<TE>   If anything, he said, on-premise billboards should be targeted for
regulation since they comprise 97.5% of all outdoor signs.</TE>
<TE>   In total, there are about 400,000 unregulated on-premise signs in
the city, officials said, and about 10,000 billboards and
non-commercial signs regulated by the ordinances.</TE>

<HD>NFL Owner Gives Pringle $49,000</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean O. Pasco</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The owner of the San Diego Chargers has donated $49,000 to help elect
former Assembly Speaker Curt Pringle as mayor of Anaheim.</LD>
<LD>   The contribution is the largest in the hotly contested, four-way
mayoral race.</LD>
<LD>   A.G. "Alex" Spanos gave the money to the Lincoln Club of Orange
County, the county's wealthiest Republican fund-raising group. The
Lincoln Club is distributing mail and paying for phone calls
supporting Pringle and critical of candidate Steve Staveley, a
Democrat and La Habra's former police chief.</LD>
<TE>   The Lincoln Club kicked in $45,000 toward the effort. Fieldstead &amp;
Co., owned by Irvine businessman Howard Ahmanson, added $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   Spanos met Pringle when Pringle served in Sacramento, said
attorney Michael Capaldi, who heads the Lincoln Club. "Curt is a
Republican hero up and down the state. A lot of folks are interested"
in helping him.</TE>
<TE>   Spanos, one of the state's largest developers, didn't return a
call to his Stockton office.</TE>
<TE>   Contributions such as Spanos' will become more common as term
limits attract retiring state lawmakers to local offices, longtime
campaign reformer Shirley Grindle said.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim Councilwoman Lucille Kring, a Republican also running for
the nonpartisan seat, said the name of the Lincoln Club effort --
Anaheim Citizens for Law Enforcement -- is misleading because she has
the endorsement of the city's police and fire unions.</TE>
<TE>   "Ninety percent of [Pringle's] money and endorsements are from out
of the city," she said. "It's a real telling tale."</TE>
<TE>   Democratic activist Wylie Aitken said one Lincoln Club mailer
accused Staveley of being a "tax-and-spend liberal" for supporting a
school bond measure passed by 67% of Anaheim voters.</TE>

<HD>Probe of Trustees Is Sought</HD>
<DH>Oxnard attorney wants D.A.'s office to check whether open
meetings law was violated by college district board in Westin
settlement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Amanda Covarrubias</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Oxnard attorney is asking the district attorney's office to look
into possible violations of the state open meetings law by community
college trustees in their contract settlement with former Chancellor
Philip Westin.</LD>
<LD>   Attorney Kevin Ready says in a letter sent this week to Ventura
County Dist. Atty. Michael Bradbury that the board of trustees may
have broken the law by failing to notify the public in September that
it had reached a settlement agreement with Westin, who was forced
from office over his spending habits.</LD>
<LD>   "Seeing what came out in the last week or two about the
settlement, it didn't seem right to me," Ready said Thursday. "Open
government is meant to let the people know what's going on. We have
an election where this is an issue, and people don't know about it
until a month later."</LD>
<TE>   Special Assistant Dist. Atty. Tom Harris said Thursday he will
review the letter when he receives it. The complaint would be the
second against the Ventura County Community College District board
over alleged violations of the open meetings law, or Brown Act,
Harris said.</TE>
<TE>   The first was in a lawsuit filed in July on behalf of county
taxpayers. That action contended trustees broke the law May 28 when
they approved Westin's original contract, which raised his salary
16%, to $203,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit claimed the board failed to properly notify the public
that a discussion would be taking place that day regarding a raise
for Westin. The D.A.'s office has not taken any action on that
complaint.</TE>
<TE>   Ready states in his letter that Westin and board President Norman
Nagel signed the settlement agreement Sept. 26, but trustees did not
announce the deal until last week, despite repeated requests from the
public and news media for information.</TE>
<TE>   "If indeed it was signed Sept. 26, as the document says, and the
public or the media asks for a copy of it, they have to give it to
you," Ready said.</TE>

<HD>2 Call Teen's Arrest Fitting</HD>
<DH>An Inglewood officer's lawyer says a D.A. investigator and
a police trainer state officer's use of force was fitting and seeks
dismissal of case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Berry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An investigator for the Los Angeles County district attorney's office
has said a police officer did not use excessive force in the
videotaped arrest of a handcuffed Inglewood teenager, contradicting a
key element of the criminal indictment against him, a defense
attorney said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Defense lawyer John Barnett cited the opinions of the
investigator, who is a former Inglewood police training officer, and
those of a current use-of-force instructor at the department in
asking Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge William Hollingsworth
to dismiss the indictment.</LD>
<LD>   Barnett argued that the charges should be dismissed because the
grand jury would not have indicted Inglewood Police Officer Jeremy
Morse if the investigator and the Inglewood instructor had testified
to the panel.</LD>
<TE>   In interviews with the district attorney's office, both officers
-- Senior Dist. Atty. Investigator David Ishibashi and Inglewood
Officer G.D. Sanford -- said Morse used justifiable force when he
picked 16-year-old Donovan Jackson up off the ground, then apparently
slammed him on to the trunk of a sheriff's deputy's vehicle, Barnett
said.</TE>
<TE>   Sanford, according to the transcript of an interview obtained by
The Times, also said the force was acceptable because Jackson
intentionally went limp, which he described as "active resistance."</TE>
<TE>   That contention offers the first insight into how the defense
plans to explain a crucial portion of Morse's use of force in the
July incident.</TE>
<TE>   The videotape, shot by a bystander, was broadcast repeatedly
across the country, prompting nationwide protests of police brutality
and drawing the attention of U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft.</TE>
<TE>   Both Sanford and Ishibashi said Morse's action would not have been
justifiable if Jackson were unconscious or near unconscious, as
prosecutors contend, according to Sandi Gibbons, spokeswoman for the
district attorney's office. She said neither men have qualified in a
courtroom as use-of-force experts.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors interviewed the training officers after the
indictments, as they were preparing the case against Morse. Gibbons
said prosecutors decided to interview them because of their
experience as police trainers.</TE>
<TE>   Morse, 24, was indicted in August on a charge of assault under
color of law, and his partner, Bijan Darvish, 25, is accused of
filing a false police report after the incident.</TE>
<TE>   The incident happened July 6, after police began questioning
Jackson's father at a gas station. Videotapes, recorded by a man
across the street and the gas station's security cameras, show
several officers struggling with Jackson for several minutes until
they handcuffed him, at which time his resistance appears to cease.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, the camera shows Morse picking Donovan up, carrying
him to the patrol vehicle and apparently throwing him down on the
trunk. He then punches him in the face. Morse has said Jackson had
grabbed his testicles and he had to hit Jackson to make him let go.</TE>
<TE>   Few details about Ishibashi's statements to prosecutors were
available Thursday. Barnett said he has had "only a very general"
conversation with Ishibashi, but that the investigator confirmed that
he told the district attorney's office that he thought the use of
force was justifiable.</TE>
<TE>   Ishibashi did not return phone calls from The Times on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Gibbons said she did not know Ishibashi's opinion on whether Morse
was justified in punching Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Sanford, the Inglewood use-of-force instructor, said the punch and
Morse's method of placing him at the car were justified.</TE>
<TE>   In a transcript of his interview with prosecutors, Sanford said
Jackson appeared to be conscious when Morse picked him up and took
him to the car.</TE>
<TE>   He said that Jackson's resistance before being handcuffed "sets
up" Morse's subsequent actions. Sanford said Jackson, by going limp,
continued "active resistance" after he was handcuffed, thus
justifying the way Morse forcefully put him on the car.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Jackson's dead weight forced Morse to pick him up high
so he could put him up high enough on the car to keep the youth from
sliding off the sloping surface of the trunk.</TE>
<TE>   Although Sanford said Morse placed Jackson on the trunk
forcefully, he said he would not describe the action as "slamming"
the youth down.</TE>
<TE>   He also said the video backs Morse's contention that Jackson
grabbed the officer's testicles. Although Sanford conceded that
Jackson's hands are out of the video camera's viewfinder, the tape
does show Morse reaching down toward his groin area just before he
throws the punch.</TE>
<TE>   The hearing on that motion to dismiss and others was postponed
until Nov. 25.</TE>

<HD>Channeling Patriotism Into the Voting Booth</HD>
<DH>Lear hopes 'secular revival' tour featuring historic
document will raise turnout at polls.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anne-Marie O'Connor</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the 1970s Norman Lear reinvented prime-time television, bringing
debate on feminism, race and the Vietnam War into the living rooms of
families as quintessentially American as Archie Bunker and his pinko
son-in-law, "Meathead."</LD>
<LD>   Today Lear wants to reinvent patriotism -- or at least reframe it.
As Americans prepare to vote and the Bush administration rattles its
saber at Iraq, Lear is sending his own personal copy of the
Declaration of Independence around Middle America.</LD>
<LD>   "This will be a red, white and blue revival, like a religious
revival," Lear said in an interview in a living room dominated by
pre-Columbian figurines, a wall-sized Rauschenberg and a sweeping
vista of the Santa Monica Mountains.</LD>
<TE>   "This will be a secular revival of America," he said, "and they
will rush out of the tent to register to vote. That's the goal of the
whole effort."</TE>
<TE>   Appropriating traditional Americana to send subversive messages is
an old Lear shtick. But at 80, this Hollywood doge in a white porkpie
hat may have outdone himself when he paid $8 million for a copy of
"the nation's birth certificate."</TE>
<TE>   The sepia-tinged document, one of 25 known to exist, is touring
cities such as Danville, Ky., and Oxford, Miss., in a Postal Service
truck that roars into town sounding sirens and trailing American
flags. Upon arrival, the exhibit is set up in a museum or library,
state capitol or other space.</TE>
<TE>   The road show has a corporate sponsor -- Home Depot -- and
Hollywood production values. There are the requisite taped celebrity
readings by Morgan Freeman, Michael Douglas, Whoopi Goldberg and
Kevin Spacey -- filmed by Conrad Hall, the cinematographer on
"American Beauty." There is "America the Beautiful," recorded by 50
country singers -- including Lyle Lovett, Amy Grant and Kenny Rogers
-- in Nashville.</TE>
<TE>   There are T-shirts, classroom materials, a Reese Witherspoon video
sermon on the importance of voting. The document lies in a
bulletproof glass case that rests on a gleaming 5-foot-high aluminum
scroll. "Kids practically climb on it," Lear said gleefully.</TE>
<TE>   He's recruiting rappers and gospel singers and "scouting the
country for multiethnic poets" for an eventual live show aimed at
young adults, who often don't bother to vote.</TE>
<TE>   Flea Market Find</TE>
<TE>   Lear's copy of the declaration was one of 200 printed in
Philadelphia on July 4, 1776. It turned up on the back of a painting
picked up at a flea market in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, 3,400 people -- many of them schoolchildren -- lined
up in Louisville, Ky,. to see it.</TE>
<TE>   The Southern tour began Sept. 11 in Charleston, S.C. The exhibit
has stopped at smaller Southern towns such as Camden, S.C., and
Beaufort, N.C. It will make its way down to New Orleans and work its
way up to Kansas City, Mo., by March. The road show won't end until
November 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The goal, Lear said, is that the morning after election day in
November 2004, "we hope the country will wake up to learn [that] 1%,
2% -- some percent -- more Americans voted."</TE>
<TE>   Lear also wants to remind Americans that dissent is
constitutionally enshrined -- and, to Lear, as much a duty as a
right. He is concerned that the war on terrorism has America headed
for a confrontation with Iraq with insufficient debate, in part
because opponents of the idea fear appearing unpatriotic.</TE>
<TE>   "My response is two words: What debate?" he said. "I don't have a
cut-and-dried answer about what we should do. But I've had a slide
rule my whole life, and in this case my slide rule tells me I need to
hear a serious debate. That's what America's all about."</TE>
<TE>   Opening forums for discourse was what Lear's 1970s television
belle epoque was all about. There was his early show on a black
family, "The Jeffersons"; his sitcom "Maude," about an uppity
liberated woman; his campy send-up of American housewifery in "Mary
Hartman, Mary Hartman."</TE>
<TE>   And of course, there was "All in the Family," where the changes
roiling U.S. society played out in a family in which the bigotry of
its patriarch, Archie Bunker, was portrayed not as an aberration but
as a cultural trait as American as apple pie.</TE>
<TE>   "People always say, 'Did it change anything?' " Lear said. "I
can't say. But when people turned the shows off, conversation
ensued."</TE>
<TE>   But that was years ago, before the ocean-view mansion, the 24-car
garage, the tennis courts. F. Scott Fitzgerald once said there were
no second acts in American lives, but Lear -- who is father of a
14-year-old and 8-year-old twins -- seems to have had at least three
or four.</TE>
<TE>   In 1980, during the rise of the religious right, Lear co-founded
an advocacy group -- People for the American Way -- that is a sort of
liberal answer to the John Birch Society.</TE>
<TE>   Lear said he was disturbed by televangelists such as Pat
Robertson, by "the mixture of politics and religion, and the
conviction that God is on your side in social and political matters."</TE>
<TE>   "We would challenge [Robertson] on the fairness doctrine so the
stations had to give us equal time. That made him furious," Lear
recalled. "He wrote me once that I should stop, because my arms were
too short to box with God.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to take back the flag and the Bible. It does not belong
exclusively to the religious right," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The group cut a television commercial of a fictional hard-hat
lamenting the commingling of religion and politics, complaining:
"That's not the American way."</TE>
<TE>   The group's slyly jingoistic name borrowed from a lexicon
associated with more conservative groups. Lear smiles.</TE>
<TE>   "We were not unaware of that," he says. "We once did a two-hour
special called 'I Love Liberty.' "</TE>
<TE>   Lear first demonstrated his regard for individual liberty the
old-fashioned way in World War II, as an Army Air Forces radio man in
a bomber, flying 52 combat missions over Nazi Germany.</TE>
<TE>   He's proud of his war record, and of the vintage pictures of
himself as a rakishly handsome, grinning young aviator -- a
personification of the kind of American symbols he likes to co-opt.</TE>
<TE>   A Moving Moment</TE>
<TE>   He first saw the Declaration of Independence online, offered for
sale by Sotheby's in 2000. He says it brought tears to his eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "The minute I saw it, I thought, 'That is the people's document,'
" he said. "That has got to travel to the people."</TE>
<TE>   The Lear Foundation and the Pew Charitable Trust provided the seed
money for the traveling exhibit. Former Presidents Carter and Ford
became honorary co-chairmen, and Nancy Reagan and Lady Bird Johnson
joined the board.</TE>
<TE>   The document arrived at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in
Simi Valley in September 2001 for a four-month stay.</TE>
<TE>   Lear acknowledges that if the Declaration of Independence
demonstrates founding American principles, it also documents some
founding flaws. For one thing, a number of the men who signed it were
slave owners.</TE>
<TE>   But that's the point, Lear says: Democracy is a collective work in
progress.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a country that's built on a promise," he said. "We need to
realize that promise. We've made good on some of them. Things are
better for African Americans, women and others. Hopefully, we will
make good on all of it. But we've got a long way to go."</TE>

<LD>The cardinal can soft-sell it, spin it, call it whatever he and his
publicists care to call it.</LD>
<LD>   But when your top five officers say "See ya," we don't need an
interpreter. There's trouble in the house.</LD>
<LD>   Not one, not two, not three, not four, but FIVE executives -- the
brain trust and administrative leadership of the Archdiocese of Los
Angeles -- are walking out the door.</LD>
<TE>   A vote of no-confidence in Cardinal Roger M. Mahony?</TE>
<TE>   Of course not, the cardinal's men would have us believe.</TE>
<TE>   A protest against un-Christian cuts in several ministries that
serve the poor, even as Mahony luxuriates in his brand new
$189-million Rog Mahal?</TE>
<TE>   No way, we're told.</TE>
<TE>   It's a mere reorganization, says the cardinal's news release. The
whole thing was set in motion by the planned sabbatical of Msgr.
Terrance  Fleming.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe so. And trust me, I want to believe this, for Mahony's sake.
With the continuing sex-abuse scandal -- the Ventura County D.A.
charged Thursday that Mahony is stonewalling an open investigation --
he's already had a tough enough year without a revolution or a
mutiny, or whatever this sudden turn might be.</TE>
<TE>   But if President Bush's entire Cabinet walked out on him, and Bush
claimed it had nothing to do with his leadership, would you smile
agreeably and nod like an idiot?</TE>
<TE>   "The staff I talked to suggested it's a protest, but they're being
good soldiers and not saying anything," one priest said of the sudden
resignation by the Gang of Five. "I don't believe the press release.
I think there is distress with the way things have been handled, and
they just wanted out."</TE>
<TE>   It wouldn't be a total surprise. Not one month ago, diocesan
priests confronted Mahony over his "paternalistic" and "unilateral"
style, saying it was ridiculous for him to argue that budget cuts and
layoffs had nothing to do with the opening of the new downtown
cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   One priest, with as many as a dozen brothers at his side, read the
following statement to the cardinal:</TE>
<TE>   "It strains the credibility we have with our people when we
dedicate a $189-million cathedral -- rejoicing that it is fully
funded -- and, one week later, declare that 60 lay and religious
employees must be let go because we have not planned wisely enough to
raise the $4 million needed to fund their ministries to prisoners,
ethnic minorities, gay and lesbian outreach and religious education
to children."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Mahony anticipates revenues from the sassy new diocesan wine
label to pay for a reinstatement of the ministries that got axed.
"Cathedral of Our Lady of Angels" chardonnay and cabernet are
available in the new gift shop, which Mahony has touted during Mass
in the new cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese has now effectively cut "every program Jesus would
have kept," one priest said Thursday. "The mood is awful," he added
before sharing a colleague's observation about the sudden abandonment
by Mahony's top five officers:</TE>
<TE>   "It's a sinking ship."</TE>
<TE>   Two of the Gang of Five released statements Thursday. One said his
resignation was not a protest move, but was born of a desire to let a
new team take over. The other said he wanted to return to parish
ministry. A third of the five is ill.</TE>
<TE>   But insiders say the truth, as usual, is a little more
complicated. I'm told it wasn't the budget cuts that riled members of
the cardinal's inner circle, but Mahony's imperious manner. Some may
have felt they were fall guys who were left out of the
decision-making but forced to do the cardinal's dirty work.</TE>
<TE>   If so, there's a lovely irony there. One lesson from the sex-abuse
scandal and the years-long cover-up was the need for a more open,
democratic and accountable church. Mahony paid lip service to that
notion when it was briefly in vogue. And yet, here he is, in crisis
again, partly over complaints that he runs a totalitarian regime.</TE>
<TE>   In a move that matches his slickest work to date, the news release
from the archdiocese does more than deny that Mahony's top officers
walked out over the budget cuts. It implies that they were the
Scrooges responsible for them, and that Mahony was left the thankless
task of rubber-stamping their heartless deeds.</TE>
<TE>   Enough with the finger-pointing, which isn't very Christian.
Regardless of who's at fault, there's a way for Mahony to square this
with the Man Upstairs.</TE>
<TE>   What is there, roughly $30 million worth of art and adornment in
the new cathedral?</TE>
<TE>   So the cardinal throws a yard sale. He's got plenty of tchotchkes
to choose from and, with the proceeds, he could rehire some of those
missionaries he canned and return them to the Lord's service.</TE>
<TE>   Who in God's Kingdom is going to miss two or three chandeliers?</TE>

<HD>X-Rated Topic in Breakup Debate</HD>
<DH>The adult entertainment industry is big business in the
Valley, but neither secessionists nor their opponents care to talk
about how it figures in.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kristina Sauerwein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The San Fernando Valley's pornography industry has no official stand
on the secession question facing voters Tuesday. And the truth is,
neither side in the secession debate is looking for the endorsement
of the adult entertainment business, even if it is one of the biggest
dollar-generators in the Valley.</LD>
<LD>   But actors, producers, directors and health-care providers for the
billion-dollar industry have seized on the secession campaign as an
opportunity to demand more recognition -- and support -- from local
government.</LD>
<LD>   Some say they believe their industry will fare better under an
independent Valley city, despite perceptions that a breakaway city
would be more conservative than Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   "We are the Valley," said Shayla Laveaux, 32, an adult performer
and producer who runs Shayla Productions with her cinematographer
husband. They live in West Hills with two dogs. "The Valley depends
on what we do."</TE>
<TE>   Laveaux said she has been studying her sample ballot, and
secession looks like a way to get more respect for the industry.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Lyon, executive director of the Chatsworth-based Free Speech
Coalition, which represents porn companies, agrees.</TE>
<TE>   "We would become more important to the swing of things," he said.
"We might have a greater voice with elected officials."</TE>
<TE>   Lyon is scheduled today to address the Valley Industry and
Commerce Assn.'s annual conference in Woodland Hills. VICA, a Valley
cityhood backer, will look at porn's increasing impact on the local
economy.</TE>
<TE>   Many workers for X-rated companies want city business-tax
incentives for the industry and funding for a health clinic.</TE>
<TE>   "Seceding may generate better return on our tax dollars," said
Daniel Metcalf, a spokesman for Wicked Pictures in Canoga Park, one
of the industry's biggest production companies.</TE>
<TE>   According to the industry's estimates, porn employs 9,000 people
in the Valley and generates $30 million a year in state sales taxes.
The Valley produces more than 80% of the nation's porn and 90% of its
sex toys.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp. lumps in porn
with the mainstream entertainment industry, which employs about
227,700 workers in the area and generated more than $30 billion in
gross revenues last year. Jack Kyser, the group's director of
economic research, said the adult industry's contribution to the
sector, while not specifically broken out, is substantial.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people may turn up their noses, but, anecdotally, it
generates significant revenues for the local economy," said Kyser,
who will speak at today's VICA conference.</TE>
<TE>   Moral issues aside, Valley secession leader Richard Katz said
elected officials would be remiss to ignore the porn industry.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is that it is a huge industry, and while the rest of
[mainstream] production is fleeing Southern California, the adult
entertainment industry is staying here," he said. "It puts a lot of
people to work."</TE>
<TE>   No one can -- or wants to -- say exactly how secession might
affect the porn industry, or the economies of a new Valley city and
the remaining Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's never come up," said Kam Kuwata, anti-secession strategist
for Mayor James K. Hahn. "In all honesty, I've done zero research....
I think I'll stay away from it."</TE>
<TE>   Valley secessionists also shied away from the topic.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no opinion," said Richard Close, chairman of the leading
Valley breakaway group. "I don't know of any pluses or minuses."</TE>
<TE>   Adult entertainers said such responses are typical.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll take our money and watch our products," said Sharon
Mitchell, 44, an ex-porn star who runs a Sherman Oaks health clinic
specializing in the "special needs of a sex worker." "But will they
[help fund efforts to prevent] chlamydia and gonorrhea? No."</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Mitchell sat in the clinic's lobby, near a bowl of
condoms and a squawking parrot that amused patients. The Valley
Village resident bemoaned the "cold" reception she received at L.A.
City Hall while seeking funding for the nonprofit clinic she
co-founded in 1998 after an outbreak of the AIDS virus among porn
stars.</TE>
<TE>   Demand for services is so great, Mitchell said, that a second
clinic will open next month in the West Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't want to be associated as being pro-pornography," said
Mitchell, who is leaning toward voting for secession next week.</TE>
<TE>   For the clinic, she said, "the issue isn't one of morality, it's
public health. People in the industry have sex with [nonindustry]
people in the Valley. They have affairs with husbands and wives. A
separate Valley might be more open to helping us."</TE>
<TE>   But Mel Wilson, a Valley mayoral candidate, said he has little
sympathy for the adult entertainment industry.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't support pornography," he said. "It's not a good influence
on young people."</TE>
<TE>   However, as long as it's legal, he said, porn workers have free
speech and the right to prosper.</TE>
<TE>   "But I don't see myself getting involved," he said.</TE>

<HD>Prognosis Doesn't Look Good for Acclaimed Rancho Rehab
Center</HD>
<DH>Some patients have nowhere else to go, but the county says
it can't afford to keep it open.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lisa Richardson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Raul Lopez is stoic while Dr. Irene Gilgoff taps his lung for fluid.
The needle is barely out of his chest when she gently explains her
expectation that he will go to college.</LD>
<LD>   "I know you're very interested in finishing your education," she
says, smiling. The 18-year-old looks at her and manages a nod. It
still hurts just to breathe.</LD>
<LD>   Just a month before, he was brought to Rancho Los Amigos National
Rehabilitation Center after being shot in his Crenshaw neighborhood.
Now he is paralyzed below the waist. He is not yet well enough for
physical rehabilitation. But after 22 years at Rancho, Gilgoff, who
is head of pediatrics, can pretty much tell who will thrive and who
will not.</LD>
<TE>   She isn't worried about Lopez; he has inner strength. She is far
more worried about the fate of the hospital itself, and where
patients like Lopez will go if it closes.</TE>
<TE>   The county Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to shut down the
Downey facility after 114 years of operation, citing a looming budget
deficit. The decision, though not final, has drawn protests from
rehabilitation experts around the county -- and the country -- who
see Rancho as one of the best in the business.</TE>
<TE>   Deciding to close Rancho, supervisors said, had been painful. But
the health-care deficit, projected to reach $500 million to $750
million in three years, threatens the county's entire hospital and
clinic system, and could drag the county into bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   "The pressure we feel is not just about this one closure," said
Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky. "The pressure we feel is if the entire
system goes into meltdown."</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Health Services determined that Rancho could not
sustain itself. Its closing, the department predicts, will save the
county as much as $70 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   The county health department director, Thomas Garthwaite, agrees
that Rancho takes on "difficult patients and [does] miraculous
things." The issue is how best to serve the greatest number of
patients with dwindling funds.</TE>
<TE>   Rancho offers an uncommon constellation of specialized services --
from spinal-cord and neurological care to vocational training. But
nearly a third of its patients are indigent.</TE>
<TE>   The county estimates it would have to pay $15 million to $30
million a year just to cover uninsured patients.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to ask, is that the best use of that money?" Garthwaite
said. "Shouldn't that $15 million go to more emergency room visits,
more outpatient services, more immunizations for children? There are
no good choices here."</TE>
<TE>   A Costly Commitment</TE>
<TE>   Just caring for a gunshot victim like Lopez, who arrived with no
insurance, costs about $200,000 the first year and about five times
that over a lifetime. Medi-Cal does not cover all of these costs. And
Rancho makes a lifetime commitment to treating its patients -- about
9,500 people a year, most of them outpatients.</TE>
<TE>   The payoff is illustrated on Gilgoff's office wall, in a photo
collage of the young patients she calls "her kids." They beam back at
her in caps and gowns and prom tuxedos.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a sad chapter -- all those who benefited from Rancho will
have to either do without or seek care elsewhere," said Fernando
Torres-Gil, the director of the UCLA Center for Policy Research on
Aging. "On a larger picture, it's just another nail in the coffin for
the collapse of our overall health-care system."</TE>
<TE>   Torres-Gil has more than an academic appreciation for Rancho. He's
been both a researcher and a patient there.</TE>
<TE>   He's being treated for post-polio syndrome, a progressive
weakening of muscles that strikes polio survivors anywhere from 10 to
40 years after their bouts with the disease. If Rancho closes,
Torres-Gil said, he and about 100 others who need similar care will
have to travel to the Bay Area or even to Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason Rancho is so crucial is that so many of the experts in
polio have passed away," he said. "Rancho Los Amigos is one of the
very few places attempting to educate a new generation of doctors,
nurses and therapists about treating these millions of polio patients
who are now getting old."</TE>
<TE>   Trauma experts -- especially orthopedic surgeons -- around the
country echoed his concerns. Rancho, said Dr. Daniel Lammerste,
president of the American Spinal Injury Assn., helps teach the
country how to treat the complications of spinal cord injuries.</TE>
<TE>   For many rehabilitation experts, Rancho Los Amigos' significance
should be considered in historic terms, not just practical ones. The
field of rehabilitation has its roots there, and the center's
influence has been felt in ways large and small.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital advances now taken for granted, such as identification
wrist tags, came from Rancho. Major innovations such as "the halo,"
which is used to support the head and neck of a patient with a spinal
cord injury, were invented there. Rancho was the first to use
plastics for prosthetic limbs instead of wood.</TE>
<TE>   Rancho became a leader in rehabilitation because of the polio
epidemics of the 1940s and '50s. Enormous black and white photos from
that time line its corridors. The grainy images show children and
adults encased in tank-like iron lungs, their heads sticking out,
while the machines help them breathe.</TE>
<TE>   In 1953, nursing director Clara Miller suggested adapting
rehabilitation concepts used with polio survivors to patients with
other muscular disabilities.</TE>
<TE>   The influx of patients with nowhere else to turn allowed Rancho's
staff to develop unusual areas of expertise. Spinal cord injuries,
for example, are rare. About 40 people out of 1 million annually have
injuries that result in paraplegia or quadriplegia.</TE>
<TE>   Clinicians at Rancho have learned, not only about the intricacies
of such injuries, but also of their emotional toll.</TE>
<TE>   'We All Need Hope'</TE>
<TE>   After about a week of stoicism, Lopez had his first breakdown in
front of Gilgoff. He tried to sit up and move from the bed to a
wheelchair -- something critical to his future independence -- and
could not. The pain in his spine was crushing.</TE>
<TE>   "Inside I'm saying to myself, 'They shot me in the back! They shot
me in the back! Why'd they have to shoot me there, anywhere but
there,' and then I realize I'm saying it all out loud and everyone
can hear me," he recounted later.</TE>
<TE>   He tries to push down fear, pain and grief with cold vigilance
during the day. But at night, the shooting returns in his dreams.</TE>
<TE>   The afternoon he was shot, a car pulled up beside him and a man
asked what neighborhood he was from. "I told him, "Nowhere, man.' But
he thought I was a Crip and shot me anyway," said Lopez, who added
that he is not a member of any gang.</TE>
<TE>   After his first few days at Rancho, he pushed for a firm answer:
"I said, 'Tell me straight, am I ever going to walk again?' They
didn't want to tell me, but finally they said no," Lopez says, then
pauses. "I can take it, though. I mean, I'm sad about it, but you
know ... what's done is done."</TE>
<TE>   As his spine stabilizes, Lopez will be surrounded by a team of
specialists -- occupational and recreational therapists,
psychologists, social workers who consult the nurses, psychiatrists
and other doctors -- to create a rehabilitation strategy. The plan
will emphasize all that he can do, not what he cannot.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't ever take away any real hope," Gilgoff says. "We all
need hope."</TE>
<TE>   Orthopedic surgeon Robert Waters could be making a fortune in
sports medicine operating, say, on Shaquille O'Neal's right big toe.
But he has never considered leaving.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no other place that I can do this," Waters said,
referring to the combination of specialized research and surgery that
can alter the lives of disabled patients.</TE>
<TE>   "I never, ever wake up and wonder why I came to work or why I went
to medical school."</TE>
<TE>   Waters is Rancho's medical director and heads the spinal cord
injury program, one of 16 "model" programs designated by the federal
government nationwide. He is widely regarded as a major influence in
the field.</TE>
<TE>   "What he does is not run-of-the-mill orthopedics," said Dr. Rod
Adkins, a research colleague at Rancho. "When you move the tendon of
one muscle that is functioning to an unfunctioning muscle so it works
both of them, well, that's pretty sophisticated stuff."</TE>
<TE>   A bald, ruddy-faced man, Waters describes himself as demanding at
work and "fairly driven."</TE>
<TE>   Colleagues say he is supremely able and businesslike -- keenly
interested in his work, with little time for personal chitchat.</TE>
<TE>   By the most refined and delicate procedures, Waters and his team
sometimes restore movement where it was thought to have been
permanently lost. For a medical school student paralyzed in a car
accident, surgery returned use of his wrist, allowing him to use a
microscope and become a pathologist.</TE>
<TE>   Many years ago, Waters' surgeries gave Sharon Riggs, now 53, the
ability to walk for the first time. Before a series of operations on
her ankles, she had spent 17 years on her back, being wheeled from
place to place on a gurney.</TE>
<TE>   "I even went to school on a gurney," she said. "People were so
mean to me, so mean. They'd make fun of me and ask why I had to be
there anyway. Why couldn't I just stay home."</TE>
<TE>   Though her treatment is long over, Rancho is the place she loves
most in the world. Riggs arrives at 6:30 a.m. every day to volunteer
her time, usually stopping in twice a day to see Waters and run
errands for him. He shows her a side his colleagues rarely see.</TE>
<TE>   "Dr. Waters?" she says, her face lighting up, "He's a beautiful
person. He is so patient. He just always has time to listen, whenever
you want to talk."</TE>
<TE>   Uncertain Prognosis</TE>
<TE>   A final decision on the hospital's future is expected in January.
Some Rancho supporters take heart because supervisors threatened to
privatize Rancho in the mid-1990s, then backed off when an audit
showed the savings would be minimal.</TE>
<TE>   But Mario and Maria Saucedo of Whittier are worried about the
hospital's prospects. Their 3-year-old son, David, is recovering from
a severe head injury, sustained when he fell out of the bleachers at
a football game Sept. 7. He is among 50 head-trauma patients treated
at Rancho each year.</TE>
<TE>   For two weeks he was in a coma, and the Saucedos could hardly
recognize him. When he first awoke, he could hardly recognize them
either. One parent stays with him at all times, sleeping beside his
crib at night.</TE>
<TE>   He is far better now, though his movements are impaired on his
right side and his vision remains distorted. He has started to play.</TE>
<TE>   "Without Rancho being a part of the county, I would have had to
take my child home from the hospital the way he was, right after he
came out of the coma," his mother said. "We don't have private
insurance."</TE>
<TE>   The Saucedos imagine they are like a lot of families: They never
thought much about hospitals and trauma and rehabilitation before
their son's fall.</TE>
<TE>   "But if I could talk to the county supervisors, I would tell them
they're deciding the difference between whether my son would have a
full recovery and normal life," she says and pauses, "or not."</TE>
<TE>   Before voting to close Rancho earlier this week, Yaroslavsky told
listeners that the board must consider what is best for the entire
county, not just one hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "When you gut $800 million out of a system, it isn't going to be
pretty."</TE>

<HD>Richman Running in 2 Races at Once</HD>
<DH>Assembly incumbent is challenged by Paula Calderon and Karl
Lembke for 38th District seat while also vying for Valley mayoral
job.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Massie Ritsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Keith Richman could win two political offices Tuesday, but he can
keep only one -- either his state Assembly seat or the mayoral job in
a newly independent San Fernando Valley.</LD>
<LD>   It might be an easy choice; if voters shoot down Valley secession,
the Republican physician could be a mayor without a city.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm looking forward to whatever the voters decide, but we'll be
very pleased and honored to represent my community either in
Sacramento as a member of the Legislature or as mayor of the San
Fernando Valley," Richman said.</LD>
<TE>   Richman has already served two years in the Assembly. His
district, the 38th, straddles Ventura and Los Angeles counties.</TE>
<TE>   Redrawn in 2001, it includes Simi Valley, Santa Clarita, portions
of the northwest and northeast San Fernando Valley, and the northwest
edge of Glendale.</TE>
<TE>   The district was drawn to be a secure seat for Republicans. The
party cannot claim a clear majority, but about 45% of the district's
229,000 registered voters belong to the GOP. About 36% are Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Challenging Richman are Democrat Paula Calderon, a health care
manager from Saugus, and water quality inspector Karl Lembke, a
Libertarian who lives in Tujunga.</TE>
<TE>   Richman describes himself as a "moderate, mainstream" Republican,
selected by the California Journal and his colleagues in July as the
Assembly's "rookie of the year" for his cooperative nature and
ambitious legislation.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature's only physician, Richman has worked to extend
health coverage to the uninsured, and he co-authored a constitutional
amendment to devote a set percentage of state funds to improving
roads, water systems and other components of California's
infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   He got that measure on the 2004 ballot in exchange for his vote to
end the state's 60-day budget deadlock in September.</TE>
<TE>   This week, Richman held a news conference at Olive View-UCLA
Medical Center in Sylmar to call for a special session of the
Legislature to deal with the health care crisis in Los Angeles County
and statewide.</TE>
<TE>   Calderon happens to work at Olive View in admissions. Los Angeles
County supervisors are considering turning the full-service hospital
into an outpatient center. That, she said, would be disastrous.</TE>
<TE>   If elected, Calderon said, she would like to get more children
enrolled in California's health insurance program, find ways to make
prescription drugs cheaper for seniors and increase teacher salaries.</TE>
<TE>   "We're losing a lot of the good teachers because the money is not
there," she said. "Who is going to work around the clock for very
little pay when there are other opportunities?"</TE>
<TE>   When Calderon's home was in the 36th Assembly District, she
challenged Assemblyman George Runner (R-Lancaster) in 1998 and 2000
-- and lost badly. Against Richman, she said, she won't spend more
than a few thousand dollars on her campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Richman reports raising about $268,000 for his reelection, much of
it from medical and insurance interests.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it's an uphill battle," Calderon said, "and it's just a
matter of putting my name out and giving people a choice."</TE>
<TE>   "Uphill battle" is the same characterization Richman offered for
Valley secession, which trailed in a recent Times poll. If the Valley
does become a city and he is elected mayor -- the same poll showed
him leading -- Richman says he will quit the Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   Calderon concedes that Richman has done "a good job" since being
elected in 2000. But she questions why he wants to be the Valley's
mayor more than he wants to return to Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why, when he has a good job right now, he's looking
for something that might not happen," she said. "I know he wants to
give people a voice, but so do I."</TE>
<TE>   The Libertarian candidate, Lembke, said politicians need to
remember that "the citizens are really the employers, government's
the employees."</TE>
<TE>   Lembke works for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and
campaigns when he can find the time.</TE>
<TE>   "I do have some notions of what I would like to fix in the event
that I would get elected," he said, "but I'm not betting the farm on
getting there."</TE>
<TE>   Lembke is active in a Los Angeles society of science fiction and
fantasy enthusiasts.</TE>

<LD>   It might be an easy choice; if voters shoot down the Valley
secession bid, the Republican physician could be a mayor without a
city.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm looking forward to whatever the voters decide, but we'll be
very pleased and honored to represent my community either in
Sacramento as a member of the Legislature or as mayor of the San
Fernando Valley," Richman said.</LD>
<TE>   Richman has already served two years in the Assembly. His
district, the 38th, straddles Ventura and Los Angeles counties.</TE>
<TE>   Redrawn in 2001, it includes Simi Valley, Santa Clarita, portions
of the northwest and northeast San Fernando Valley, and the northwest
edge of Glendale.</TE>
<TE>   The district was drawn as a secure seat for Republicans. The party
cannot claim a clear majority, but about 45% of the district's
229,000 registered voters belong to the GOP. About 36% are Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Challenging Richman are Democrat Paula Calderon, a health-care
manager from Saugus, and water-quality inspector Karl Lembke, a
Libertarian who lives in Tujunga.</TE>
<TE>   Richman, who describes himself as a "moderate, mainstream"
Republican, was selected by the California Journal and his colleagues
in July as the Assembly's "rookie of the year" for his cooperative
nature and ambitious legislation.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature's only physician, Richman has worked to extend
health coverage to the uninsured, and he co-wrote a constitutional
amendment to devote a set percentage of state funds to improving
roads, water systems and other components of California's
infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   He got that measure on the 2004 ballot in exchange for his vote to
end the state's 60-day budget deadlock in September.</TE>
<TE>   This week, Richman held a news conference at Olive View-UCLA
Medical Center in Sylmar to call for a special session of the
Legislature to deal with the health-care crisis in Los Angeles County
and statewide.</TE>
<TE>   Calderon happens to work at Olive View in admissions. Los Angeles
County supervisors are considering turning the full-service hospital
into an outpatient center. That, she said, would be disastrous.</TE>
<TE>   If elected, Calderon said, she would like to get more children
enrolled in California's health-insurance program, find ways to make
prescription drugs cheaper for seniors and increase teachers'
salaries.</TE>
<TE>   "We're losing a lot of the good teachers because the money is not
there," she said. "Who is going to work around the clock for very
little pay when there are other opportunities?"</TE>
<TE>   When Calderon's home was in the 36th Assembly District, she
challenged Assemblyman George Runner (R-Lancaster) in 1998 and 2000
-- and lost badly. Against Richman, she said, she won't spend more
than a few thousand dollars on her campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Richman reports raising about $268,000 for his reelection bid,
much of it from medical and insurance interests.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it's an uphill battle," Calderon said, "and it's just a
matter of putting my name out and giving people a choice."</TE>
<TE>   "Uphill battle" is the same characterization Richman offered for
Valley secession, which trailed in a recent Times poll. If the Valley
does become a city and he is elected mayor -- the same poll showed
him leading -- Richman says he will quit the Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   Calderon concedes Richman has done "a good job" since being
elected in 2000. But she questions why he wants to be the Valley's
mayor more than he wants to return to Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why, when he has a good job right now, he's looking
for something that might not happen," she said. "I know he wants to
give people a voice, but so do I."</TE>
<TE>   The Libertarian candidate, Lembke, said politicians need to
remember "the citizens are really the employers, government's the
employees."</TE>
<TE>   Lembke works for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and
campaigns when he can find the time.</TE>
<TE>   "I do have some notions of what I would like to fix in the event
that I would get elected," he said, "but I'm not betting the farm on
getting there."</TE>
<TE>   Lembke is active in a Los Angeles society of science fiction and
fantasy enthusiasts and maintains a Web site on Wicca, a religion of
witches. He describes the Tujunga foothills, where he lives, as "a
thriving pagan community."</TE>

<HD>Diocese Denies 5 Quit Because of Cuts</HD>
<DH>Two priests offer explanations, but some priests and
employees are skeptical.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Larry B. Stammer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles denied Thursday that
the resignations of its five highest-ranking executives had been
related to cuts in the church budget, but through a spokesman it said
none of the five was available to answer questions about their
departure.</LD>
<LD>   Through press spokesman Tod Tamberg, two of the five issued
written statements. Msgr. Richard Loomis, director of the Secretariat
for Administrative Services, said he wanted to return to parish
ministry. Thomas Chabolla, director of the Secretariat for Pastoral
and Community Services, said he decided to step down to allow an
incoming vicar general -- the second-highest-ranking executive after
Cardinal Roger M. Mahony -- to name his own senior management team.
One of the five whose resignations became public Wednesday is the
current vicar general, Msgr. Terrance Fleming.</LD>
<LD>   In his statement, Chabolla said, "It is important for me to
clarify that my departure from the archdiocese is not in protest of
the cuts, as has been reported."</LD>
<TE>   On Wednesday, a veteran priest said Chabolla had told the priest
that he thought he had not been consulted before the cuts were made.</TE>
<TE>   The priest reiterated that account Thursday. He said Chabolla had
offered his resignation as the budget crisis unfolded, but that
Mahony had persuaded him to remain through the year. Chabolla's
statement did not address that issue.</TE>
<TE>   In his statement, Loomis defended the budget cuts as "necessary,
logical and, within the context of the current financial situation,
as compassionate as possible."</TE>
<TE>   Tamberg insisted Thursday that, although Mahony ultimately
approved the controversial budget cuts, all five officials had been
intimately involved in conceiving and executing them. The cuts
included the elimination of seven headquarters ministries,
retrenchment in others and the layoffs of at least 60 workers in
archdiocese headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   "They met for several weeks behind closed doors -- sometimes a
couple of times a day -- making these decisions on what needed to be
cut or downsized. It was agonizing for them. They were heavily
involved. They weren't out of the loop," Tamberg said of the five
members of the archdiocesan secretariat. "They were the loop."</TE>
<TE>   The statements drew skeptical responses from other priests and
archdiocesan employees.</TE>
<TE>   Those who resigned "were the ones left with the burden of telling
people your department is gone. I was one of them," said Laurie W.
Oester, who has resigned as the archdiocese's director of campus
ministry. "I know, because I've talked to my own secretariat
director. It was devastating to them."</TE>

<TE>   Outreach Programs Cut</TE>
<TE>   Chabolla's office oversaw many of the ministries that were
eliminated or cut, including outreach to ethnic groups, people with
disabilities and lesbian and gay Catholics. It also governed
ecumenical and inter-religious affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony ordered the cuts in the archdiocese budget this fall after
the archdiocesan financial council refused to approve the budget
until a $4.3-million deficit had been closed. The archdiocese said
Thursday that Mahony and the finance council had left it up to the
executives to decide how to make the cuts.</TE>
<TE>   The five ranking executives jointly announced their decisions to
quit in an e-mail to archdiocesan employees Wednesday.</TE>

must struggle to get voters to understand what it does.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- The first question State Board of Equalization
candidates typically get from voters doesn't have a simple answer.</LD>
<LD>   "What they ask me, No. 1, is, 'What is the Board of Equalization?'
" said Tom Y. Santos, a Democratic candidate who has been shaking
hands at fairs and community forums from Red Bluff to Ventura as he
seeks a seat on the tax-collecting panel.</LD>
<LD>   Each member of the board represents more than 8 million people, a
constituency 10 times the size of the typical state senator's.</LD>
<TE>   But even the candidates call the office "unsexy," "unglamorous"
and "invisible." It's tough to debate the issues of the day when they
involve uniformity of property tax assessment and valuation of
possessory interest.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately there are no debate opportunities. There are no
meet-the-public opportunities," said Kenneth A. Weissman, Libertarian
candidate in the district that includes Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "As a candidate for what's perceived as a minor office, there's
nothing favorable I can do to generate publicity. I'm not willing to
streak naked through downtown Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   One million California businesses pay taxes or fees to the Board
of Equalization. The agency, with 4,000 employees, administers
sales-and-use taxes and fees or taxes on fuel, liquor, cigarettes and
other goods. It also serves as a sort of appeals court for people
disputing franchise and personal income taxes. Last year the agency
collected 34% of the money that runs state government.</TE>
<TE>   The board is made up of four elected members and the California
controller, who is elected statewide. Republicans have not held a
majority on the board since 1958, but could gain three votes this
year if Tom McClintock, the Republican candidate for controller,
defeats Democrat Steve Westly in what has been a close race.</TE>
<TE>   Created 123 years ago to make property tax collection consistent
from county to county, the board's $131,250-a-year positions have
been sought lately by politicians ousted from the Legislature by term
limits.</TE>
<TE>   Democrat Carole Migden, looking for work after six years in the
Assembly, will become California's first openly gay constitutional
officer if she wins Tuesday's election. She is running against
Republican Mark S. Bendick and Libertarian Elizabeth C. Brierly in
the heavily Democratic 1st District, which stretches along the
northern and central coast.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Republican Bill Leonard, with 24 years in the
Legislature, seeks the Board of Equalization seat for the vast 2nd
District. He and Migden stand to benefit from districts drawn to
their advantage by colleagues in the Legislature last year. The 2nd
District includes a narrow finger stretching east from Los Angeles
County to Leonard's San Bernardino house.</TE>
<TE>   Two current board members are seeking reelection. John Chiang, a
Democrat serving the Democratic-leaning 4th District centered in Los
Angeles, has distinguished himself by sponsoring tax law workshops
for businesses, nonprofits and churches, as well as seminars on
college financing and retirement.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to do something that impacts people's daily lives," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Republican Claude Parrish wants another four-year term in the
Republican-leaning 3rd District, which includes San Bernardino,
Riverside, Imperial and San Diego counties.</TE>
<TE>   He prides himself on having "ripped out the phone maze" in his
district so that taxpayers reach a real person when they call. He
plans to open an eighth office in his district, in Long Beach, so
people don't have to drive so far to pay their tax bills.</TE>
<TE>   Board of Equalization candidates usually don't bother with
television advertising. Instead, campaigning for this down-ballot
race usually involves yard signs, billboards and pamphlets published
by endorsement groups.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some candidates have raised hundreds of thousands of
dollars, much of it from big corporations that stand to gain or lose
millions through the panel's decisions.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, the Legislature imposed tougher conflict-of-interest
rules on the Board of Equalization than apply to the lawmakers
themselves. Board members must recuse themselves or return donations
before voting on issues that affect companies that have given them
$250 or more in the previous year. The rule explains why many
companies donate $249 to the candidates.</TE>
<TE>   But many big businesses dodge the restriction completely. They
donate to the Taxpayers Political Action Committee, which then
funnels thousands of dollars to board candidates.</TE>
<TE>   TaxPAC donors are predominantly utility, pipeline, phone and
railroad companies whose property is assessed by the board.</TE>
<TE>   They include Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric,
Pacific Telesis Group, AT&amp;T Wireless Services and Union Pacific
Railroad.</TE>
<TE>   In the last two years, TaxPAC in turn has contributed $45,000 to
Parrish, $35,000 to Leonard, $15,000 to Chiang and $50,000 to Westly.</TE>
<TE>   "They are a very clever way of getting around the restrictions on
conflict-of-interest voting by the Board of Equalization," said Lenny
Goldberg, director of the California Tax Reform Assn. "It's a pretty
sleazy deal."</TE>
<TE>   Native American tribes have also donated heavily -- $78,000 this
year -- to Leonard. Late last year, the board ruled that Indian
tribes no longer are required to collect state and local sales taxes
on meals, beverages and other food sold on reservations. Board
hearings are underway to consider extending that exemption to other
goods.</TE>
<TE>   Most tribes, pointing to their status as sovereign entities, have
refused to collect state and local sales taxes. Leonard said he
supports the board's recent action.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a question of tax enforcement that the board has to
consider," he said. "Whether it's worth the expense of auditors to
try to go after that, assuming they could get by the sovereignty
issues."</TE>
<TE>   Santos, Leonard's Democratic challenger, has raised $15,000,
compared with Leonard's $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that I am not beholden to the big corporations," said
Santos, a Sacramento tax consultant.</TE>
<TE>   "Our differences are very clear. He's a right-wing conservative.
He will impose his conservative ideology on the decisions he makes on
the board."</TE>
<TE>   In the board's 3rd District, Parrish faces two challengers:
Democrat Mary Christian-Heising, once employed in public relations,
and Libertarian J.R. "Nobody" Graham of San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Chiang, a former Internal Revenue Service tax law specialist,
faces Republican candidate Glen R. Forsch and Weissman, the
Libertarian.</TE>
<TE>   Forsch has stuck to a simple platform in his campaign: an annual
sales tax holiday lasting one or two days.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to do something in California to give regular people more
money to spend," said the Burbank businessman.</TE>

<HD>Council Delay Puts Nominee on Ethics Panel</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Rabbi Uri D. Herscher, the president of the Skirball
Cultural Center, has been placed on the city's Ethics Commission by
default, although he has not completed all the paperwork required for
the position, officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Herscher, who has yet to finish filling out his economic
disclosure forms, was inadvertently granted a five-year term on the
volunteer commission after the City Council delayed acting on his
nomination earlier this month. Council members did not realize at the
time that Herscher -- who had been nominated by City Atty. Rocky
Delgadillo -- would automatically be confirmed as a commissioner
unless they voted against his appointment by Oct. 18.</LD>
<LD>   "Although the council was entirely correct in not wanting to act
on the nomination without being able to judge whether a conflict
situation might arise, unfortunately, the [City] Charter provides
that, if the council does not disapprove a commission nomination
within 45 days after it is submitted, the nominee is automatically
confirmed," Delgadillo wrote to lawmakers.</LD>
<TE>   Herscher said in an interview Thursday that traveling and
procrastination had delayed his work on the forms.</TE>
<TE>   Council members -- who were expected to easily confirm Herscher,
once his background report was completed -- said they were not
concerned about the default appointment.</TE>

<HD>Safeguarding Fillmore's Charm Key for Hopefuls</HD>
<DH>Four council candidates, vying for two open seats, have
different ideas on what it will take to preserve the city's
small-town atmosphere.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Fred Alvarez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With its historic downtown and turn-of-the-century train depot,
locals are fond of calling Fillmore the last, best small town in
Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   But the four candidates vying for two seats in Tuesday's City
Council election have drastically different ideas on what it will
take to preserve the city's charm.</LD>
<LD>   Nick Dalton, 47, and Paul Harding, 55, want to put the brakes on
large-scale development, saying the city needs to instead focus on
pumping life into its downtown, developing the tourist trade and
sustaining the surrounding agricultural industry.</LD>
<TE>   Ken Smedley, 57, and Ernest Villegas, 51, embrace a "smart growth"
philosophy, saying Fillmore needs to shore up its economic base and
generate tax revenue by providing more middle-income and high-end
housing and developing a strategy to lure industry and good jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The two incumbents, Linda Brewster and Don Gunderson, are not
seeking reelection.</TE>
<TE>   Development has been a crucial issue in the bucolic farm town
because of the planned 21,600-home Newhall Ranch project east of the
city, just across the Los Angeles County line.</TE>
<TE>   The candidates agree this is a critical election, one sure to
shape the future of the Santa Clara Valley city for years.</TE>
<TE>   "This town is going to decide whether it wants to continue
building tract homes or whether it's going to stop and concentrate on
saving this last, little great town for our kids and future
generations," said Dalton, a house renovator who moved to Fillmore
three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Dalton said he's upset with the pace of development, noting city
leaders in the last year have approved construction of hundreds of
houses. That included last month's approval of the 750-unit Heritage
Valley Park project, the largest development in Fillmore history.</TE>
<TE>   Dalton said he would focus on developing the city's tourism
industry as a way of generating tax dollars and pumping life into the
downtown area along Central Avenue. He also would like to see more
money budgeted for parks and redevelopment in the downtown core.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a wonderful valley," Dalton said. "And it's going to become
more and more valuable as a tourist destination in years to come if
we can just preserve it."</TE>
<TE>   Harding got his start in public life after becoming concerned over
development in one of the region's last predominantly agricultural
valleys.</TE>
<TE>   He was a leader of the slow-growth group that fought to place an
anti-sprawl measure on the city ballot. Those efforts resulted last
year in a city law that shields hundreds of acres of farmland and
open space from urban development.</TE>
<TE>   "We need a council that is willing to resist the temptation to
build beyond those boundaries, to resist sprawl and to work toward
preserving agriculture," said Harding, a painting contractor and
10-year resident.</TE>
<TE>   Harding said he also wants to develop the tourist trade and
reinvigorate downtown. He said he wants to strengthen Fillmore's
Hollywood connection, noting the city already is a choice spot for
movie-makers seeking to recreate a small-town feel.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a visionary trying to create a better and bigger Fillmore
for people coming from somewhere else," Harding said. "My concern is
the improvement of the community for the people currently living in
the community."</TE>
<TE>   Smedley, a city planning commissioner and co-owner of a
water-conditioning company, said he wants to concentrate on lifting
the city economically through creation of high-end housing and
offering opportunities for business expansion.</TE>
<TE>   Smedley, an eight-year resident, disagrees with those who
characterize recent development approvals as sprawl.</TE>
<TE>   He cites enactment of the city's anti-sprawl measure and ongoing
efforts to turn a decades-old greenbelt agreement into law as proof
that Fillmore is growing carefully.</TE>
<TE>   "My worthy opponents don't have a clue about what the appropriate
and proper definition of sprawl is," he said.</TE>
<TE>   While continuing to manage growth, Smedley said boosting the
city's sagging economy is the only way to provide parks, recreation
programs and other services essential to maintaining Fillmore's
small-town feel.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't do this," Smedley said, "this community will become
the place in Ventura County where you go when you can't go anyplace
else."</TE>
<TE>   Villegas said he also supports development of high-end housing to
shore up the city's economic base.</TE>
<TE>   But Villegas, a 27-year resident and regional manager for Southern
California Edison, said it's also important to ensure that housing is
available for residents of all incomes.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to make sure that we have growth that makes sense for our
particular community," said Villegas, a former city planning
commissioner and parks and recreation commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   Villegas said City Council members during the next four years will
have to deal with a wealth of issues, from redevelopment and business
development to protecting the city's greenbelt and planning for a new
sewage treatment plant to meet state standards.</TE>
<TE>   Villegas said he believes his experience in local government gives
him an advantage over the competition. "We are losing two experienced
council people," he said. "The issue in my eyes is who can best
provide the experience and leadership needed to address the range of
issues facing our community."</TE>

<HD>Open Space Becomes a Litmus Test</HD>
<DH>Fullerton candidates' position on the pace of development
of West Coyote Hills is expected to make the difference in voter
support.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Vivian LeTran</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Preservation of Fullerton's last large swath of open space -- 510
acres of wild, natural habitat called West Coyote Hills -- has
emerged as a hot topic this election season, with some residents
questioning whether more development will overwhelm the city.</LD>
<LD>   Although West Coyote Hills appears nowhere on Tuesday's city
ballot, the names of nine council candidates do, and the five-member
council is expected to decide on plans for the property sometime next
year, city officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Six candidates are competing to fill out the remaining two years
of Councilman Chris Norby's term. Norby won election to the Orange
County Board of Supervisors in March. Candidates in the special
election for Norby's seat are Angela Chen Lindstrom, Kerry H. Knapp,
Vance D. Blaisdell, Shawn Nelson, Chuck Munson and Ralph G. Baker Jr.</LD>
<TE>   Candidates for two full-term council positions are incumbents Don
Bankhead and Jan M. Flory, and contender Leland Wilson. The top two
vote getters will serve four-year terms.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents say they will vote for candidates based on their
stance on development of West Coyote Hills, an expanse of coastal
sage that is home to endangered gnatcatchers. The area is slated for
development by property owner Pacific Coast Homes, a subsidiary of
Chevron.</TE>
<TE>   "We're building too much too fast in the last couple of years,"
said Suzette Montgomery, 40, who hikes and bikes the nature trails
along the former oil fields with her children.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the recreational trails used by county residents run along
homeowners' backyards or near road traffic, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's ridiculous to ship our kids out to Huntington Beach to the
nature center there when we have this scenic space in our city's own
backyard that can be used as a educational resource with its own
nature center," Montgomery said.</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely will choose candidates based on their stand on the
issue."</TE>
<TE>   Early plans still under negotiation include limited-density
developments of about 760 homes, an elementary school and some
commercial shopping. Construction would take place around pockets of
gnatcatcher habitat. In addition, Pacific Coast may provide an
endowment to build, maintain and operate a nature center on the site.</TE>
<TE>   A few candidates say the land should not be developed at all.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a rural character of Fullerton that comes from natural,
open spaces, not urban parks," said Lindstrom, 36. "Community
residents are trying to save their neighborhoods, and the city has
not conducted an open dialogue with the public on this issue yet."</TE>
<TE>   Blaisdell, who also is running for the Norby seat, vowed to
preserve the area too.</TE>
<TE>   "Fullerton is now experiencing a development boom. I've personally
enjoyed visiting the new stores and viewing the model homes, but I've
also noticed the hills disappearing," said Blaisdell, 55. "I will
fight to save Coyote Hills."</TE>
<TE>   Other candidates say they are concerned about the West Coyote
Hills issue but don't explicitly address the issue on their campaign
statements.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a sense of urgency with this land because it's the last
biggest one, and it's set off people's alarm that the open spaces
might be threatened," said Nelson, 35, who would support some
low-density housing developments. "But we have to respect Chevron's
proposals for some housing developments."</TE>
<TE>   The hilly terrain in question is in the city's northwest end,
bordered by Euclid Street and Rosecrans Avenue, and surrounded by
older housing developments.</TE>
<TE>   Oil was pumped from the hillsides for about 70 years until
drilling operations were shut down in the mid-1990s. Today, West
Coyote Hills offers a remarkable, 360-degree vista of Huntington
Beach, Los Angeles and Santa Catalina Island from its highest point.
The property is valued at about $300 million, city officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Bankhead, Fullerton's current mayor who is running for reelection,
said that no formal plans have been presented to the city yet and
that no decisions can be made on the property until U.S. Fish and
Wildlife officials approve an environmental impact report early next
year.</TE>
<TE>   Bankhead said he would prefer the entire land remain open space
but would consider a compromise with developers because the cost to
buy the land outright is too high.</TE>
<TE>   "I can work with it either way," said Bankhead, 70. "We need to
work toward leaving the whole area as a natural habitat, but the city
has no way to find the kind of money it takes to purchase the
property."</TE>
<TE>   Bankhead said failing that, he would support some low-density
housing.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's in the city's best interest to keep as much open space
as possible," he said.</TE>

<HD>Defendant's 2nd Murder Trial Begins</HD>
<DH>Former Ojai resident is charged with killing a Ventura
market clerk during a 2001 robbery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Fred Alvarez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A second trial for murder defendant Richard Geise began Thursday the
same way his first trial ended, with a defense attorney blaming a
dead man for the fatal shooting last year of a Ventura market clerk.</LD>
<LD>   But to prove it this time, defense attorney Robert Schwartz told
jurors he will call the dead man's father to the stand to back up the
assertion.</LD>
<LD>   Geise, 32, a former Ojai resident, is one of two men accused of
killing Alejandro Alvarez and wounding two of his co-workers during a
robbery of Ventura's Central Market in April 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Gunfire erupted after two men wearing gas masks stormed the store,
demanded money and began shooting before employees could comply.</TE>
<TE>   Police linked the crime to Geise and his cousin, Alfonso Delgado,
after seizing weapons and ammunition similar to those used in the
shooting from a Ventura hotel room where Geise was living.</TE>
<TE>   Delgado, 25, was killed in May 2001 by a Ventura police SWAT team
marksman after a five-hour standoff outside the home of Delgado's
grandmother.</TE>
<TE>   Geise has maintained that Sam Patterson, a Delgado friend who has
since died from a drug overdose, was the second shooter.</TE>
<TE>   Schwartz, who was appointed to represent Geise after a mistrial
was declared earlier this year, told jurors that claim will be
supported by two witnesses, including Patterson's father, Walter.</TE>
<TE>   "About a week before the robbery, Sam looked up and said, 'Dad,
your son is going away to prison for the rest of his life for
murder,' " Schwartz said in recounting a conversation his
investigator had with the elder Patterson.</TE>
<TE>   When Walter Patterson asked his son if he was referring to the
Central Market shooting, Sam Patterson turned white, as if in shock,
Schwartz said.</TE>
<TE>   "Why would he say this unless it were true?" Schwartz said of
Walter Patterson's pending testimony. "The people cannot and will not
prove Mr. Geise is guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt for one simple
reason: It wasn't Mr. Geise."</TE>
<TE>   Geise is charged with one count of murder, two counts of attempted
murder and several other charges stemming from the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   A mistrial was declared during Geise's first trial after his
attorney at the time, Willard Wiksell, said he had been given new
evidence that made it impossible for him to continue. Geise has since
also been charged with suborning perjury for allegedly asking a
witness to lie during the first trial.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Don Glynn told jurors in his opening
statement Thursday that a firearms expert will testify that a shell
casing found at the market matched a .40-caliber gun found in Geise's
hotel room.</TE>
<TE>   The expert will further testify, Glynn said, that the casing, as
well as ammunition seized at the hotel, all bore the same
manufacturer's stamp.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony got underway Thursday as the prosecution called its
first witnesses.</TE>

<HD>Shotgun Blast Kills Intruder as He Terrorizes Former Wife,
In-Laws</HD>
<DH>Eric Kiefer broke into the Laguna Hills home where he was
wed 10 years ago. He also tried to force his daughter to drink a
caustic liquid.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The former husband had shown up at the door so many times before that
the family bought a pistol. And finally a shotgun.</LD>
<LD>   Early Thursday morning, just days after his latest arrest for
domestic violence, Eric Christopher Kiefer, 35, was shot to death
when he broke into the Laguna Hills home where his former wife lives,
tried to force his daughter to drink an unidentified substance and
attacked his in-laws with a homemade hatchet.</LD>
<LD>   "They were worried for their lives. They were worried every
night," said Cindy Gillim, a neighbor. "I don't blame him for
shooting, because it wasn't going to end."</LD>
<TE>   Police said Dana Kiefer's father fired two shots from a pistol at
his former son-in-law, missing both times.</TE>
<TE>   Dana Kiefer's boyfriend then grabbed a shotgun and shot Kiefer
once in the neck, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Kiefer, identified as an unemployed Lake Forest resident, was
pronounced dead at the home in the 25000 block of Champlain Road, the
same residence where he and Dana Kiefer had exchanged wedding vows in
a backyard ceremony 10 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they had been called to the home at least 10 times in
the last two years, citing Kiefer for offenses such as trespassing,
disturbing the peace and being under the influence of
methamphetamine.</TE>
<TE>   About 1 a.m. Thursday, police said, Kiefer forced his way into the
home, woke up his 10-year-old daughter and tried to force her to
drink what police described as a caustic liquid.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, my God! Oh, my God!" Dana Kiefer screamed to police during
the attack, according to a recording of her 911 call. "Hurry, get
over here! He's here again! He's getting my daughter!"</TE>
<TE>   The girl's grandparents, Charles and Barbara Howlett, 66 and 63,
came to the child's assistance, but Kiefer attacked the couple with a
homemade hatchet, said Jim Amormino, spokesman for the Orange County
Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Kiefer also attacked his ex-wife's boyfriend, Mathew
Dyer, 30, when he tried to wrest the hatchet from him.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the grandfather grabbed a .38-caliber handgun and
fired twice in Kiefer's direction, both shots missing. Dyer then ran
into a bedroom, got the shotgun and fired twice, hitting Kiefer once
in the neck.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a vicious attack," Amormino said. "They had a right to
defend themselves. If they didn't, it could've been more tragic."</TE>
<TE>   Dyer and the grandparents were treated for cuts at Saddleback
Memorial Medical Center in Laguna Hills and released. The girl was
uninjured and did not swallow any of the unidentified liquid.</TE>
<TE>   According to a restraining order granted Oct. 16 -- five days
after Kiefer showed up intoxicated at the Laguna Hills home and
assaulted his former wife and her boyfriend -- Kiefer was under court
order to stay away from his ex-wife, his daughter, his in-laws and
the boyfriend.</TE>
<TE>   Kiefer refused to attend the Oct. 16 hearing, and Superior Court
Judge Barbara Tam Nomoto Schumann set a Nov. 4 mediation session.
Dana Kiefer asked the court to force her former husband to attend a
"certified batterer's program."</TE>
<TE>   The court order lists many physical abuses. In one instance,
Kiefer broke into the residence and assaulted Dyer, the boyfriend.</TE>
<TE>   In another, Kiefer cut his former wife's leg.</TE>
<TE>   Last weekend, police said, Kiefer pushed his way into the home on
Sunday night and slugged his former wife. Kiefer was arrested for
domestic violence and violating the restraining order, Amormino said.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, police said, Kiefer posted $25,000 bail and was
released from Orange County Jail.</TE>
<TE>   One neighbor offered a contrasting view of Kiefer, recalling how
he would pull into the Laguna Hills neighborhood in his Porsche and
wait patiently for the chance to see his daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "He loved her," the neighbor said. "He always said good things
about his daughter. He was a nice guy. I'm still in awe."</TE>
<TE>   The Kiefers had moved to San Antonio after marrying. They were
divorced in 1998. Dana Kiefer, 30, returned to Orange County in 2000
so she could be near her parents, and bought a Dana Point dance
studio. She recently sold the studio but continued dance instruction
in San Juan Capistrano, friends said.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors said the grandparents were so terrified by Kiefer that
Charles Howlett, a career Marine, recently bought the shotgun.</TE>
<TE>   Gillim, the neighbor, said Howlett was worried for his family.
"[He] had it under his bed for protection if Eric comes to attack
them."</TE>

<HD>Chinatown After-School Program Fills Void for Many At-Risk
Kids</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Julie Tamaki</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The dozens of children who converge on Castelar Street Elementary
School in Chinatown every afternoon make it hard to tell that classes
have recessed for the day. What draws these middle-school students,
many of them the children of Chinese immigrants, is an after-school
program designed to keep vulnerable kids from joining gangs and to
help them overcome cultural and language barriers.</LD>
<LD>   Participants receive help with their homework, play basketball,
visit museums and take field trips to local colleges, staying busy
until their parents get home from work.</LD>
<LD>   "For many of these kids, there's really nobody to watch over them
or keep track of what they're doing," said Victor Szeto, who leads
the program.</LD>
<TE>   Wilson To, a seventh-grader at a San Fernando Valley middle
school, has been attending the Castelar program for two years. He
said he values the friends he has made and sheepishly acknowledges
that the program forces him to make homework a higher priority than
he would if he were at home.</TE>
<TE>   "At home, I would watch television, eat, hang out and then do my
homework," To said. "Here, it's homework first."</TE>
<TE>   Szeto and the program assistants also help by acting as
interpreters. Many of the children, who spend most of their day
learning and speaking in English, don't know enough Chinese to
communicate well with their parents, Szeto said. And many parents,
whose days may be spent in the company of other Chinese speakers,
don't speak enough English to talk meaningfully with their children.</TE>
<TE>   "The generational gap is particularly big in these homes," Szeto
said.</TE>
<TE>   The program has a waiting list; there's not enough space for more
than the two dozen or so youngsters who show up each day.</TE>
<TE>   The Castelar program is run by the Chinatown Service Center, which
was established in the 1970s and is a recipient of a grant from the
Los Angeles Times Holiday Campaign. Last year, the holiday appeal
raised $653,000, which was given to 56 charities serving Los Angeles,
Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties.</TE>
<TE>   The agencies provide services to disadvantaged children and youth,
including food, clothing and shelter, early childhood literacy
programs, services for developmentally delayed and disabled children,
and programs to prevent drug abuse, violence and teenage pregnancy.</TE>
<TE>   The Chinatown Service Center, which runs a range of programs, used
the money it received last year from the Holiday Campaign to train
teenagers to teach their peers about pregnancy prevention and safe
sex.</TE>

<HD>Republican Ex-Rival Supports Garamendi</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean O. Pasco</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Republican rival of Democrat John Garamendi took the unusual
step Thursday of endorsing him for insurance commissioner.</LD>
<LD>   Wes Bannister of Huntington Beach was the GOP nominee for the post
in 1990, running again in 1994 and this year. He lost this year's
primary race to Republican Gary Mendoza.</LD>
<LD>   As the state's insurance commissioner from 1990 to 1994, Garamendi
is better-equipped to handle an approaching crisis in insurance
coverage for worker's compensation, health care and homeowners'
policies, Bannister said.</LD>
<TE>   "There may be some individuals in the party that come unglued"
because of the endorsement. "But we need right now someone who will
be proactive on all of the problems we're having" in the state's
$90-billion-a-year industry.</TE>
<TE>   Mendoza is a lawyer who was former Los Angeles Mayor Richard
Riordan's deputy for economic development. He also was a commissioner
of corporations in the administration of Republican Gov. Pete Wilson.</TE>

<HD>West Covina Kidnapping Victim Shows Up at Hospital</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Cara Mia DiMassa</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A West Covina woman who was kidnapped at gunpoint from her home
earlier this week walked into a Sun Valley hospital Thursday evening
after her daughter and another woman were arrested for alleged
obstruction of justice in the case, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said they were still interviewing Angelina Bejarano,
60, and did not yet know how she got free or what her condition was.</LD>
<LD>   Police were seeking Miguel Escalera, 29, of Sun Valley and a
second man, both considered armed and dangerous.</LD>
<TE>   Bejarano was abducted Tuesday night when two men knocked on her
door and then hustled her into an SUV. Her daughter, Evelyn Callu,
31, told police she ran after them and was grabbed by one man but
broke free.</TE>
<TE>   But Callu had several cellular phone conversations with the
alleged abductors before the kidnapping and did not tell police, West
Covina police spokesman Rudy Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   Police say they believe the case may be connected to narcotics.</TE>
<TE>   "We think the family living in the home is related to someone who
is involved," Lopez said. "They might have targeted this family to
make a point."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said they reached that conclusion because there was
no ransom demand.</TE>
<TE>   Police also arrested Escalera's girlfriend, Melissa Rodriguez, 27,
on suspicion of obstruction of justice. Rodriguez owns a Mitsubishi
Montero that police believe may have been the getaway vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Escalera is described as 5-foot-7, 250 pounds, with letters
tattooed on his chest. The other suspect is said to be in his 20s,
about 5-foot-9 and 160 pounds.</TE>

<HD>Laguna Mayor Is Indicted on Conflict Charge</HD>
<DH>The felony allegation stems from a city real estate deal in
which he represented the sellers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christine Hanley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Laguna Beach Mayor Wayne Baglin has been indicted on a felony
conflict-of-interest charge for allegedly working as a real estate
broker on behalf of the sellers of two properties the city bought
last year.</LD>
<LD>   Baglin was informed of the indictment Thursday, a day after
several top city officials testified before a grand jury convened by
the Orange County district attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors would not comment on the case.</LD>
<TE>   Baglin's attorney, meanwhile, said the charge is baseless.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Baglin did nothing wrong whatsoever," said attorney Michael
Molfetta of Newport Beach. "We're not going to admit any wrongdoing.
So the case is either going to be dismissed or go to trial. Either
way, I like my chances."</TE>
<TE>   Molfetta said his client will plead innocent at a Nov. 15
arraignment and will be cleared of the charges.</TE>
<TE>   The case dates to January 2001, when the City Council, in search
of land for a senior center, voted to buy a pair of adjacent parcels
on 3rd Street through eminent domain.</TE>
<TE>   The property was owned by Edgar and Dorothy Hatfield, clients and
friends of Baglin.</TE>
<TE>   Though Baglin recused himself from the city's vote on the land and
disclosed his relationship with the sellers, he represented the
couple during negotiations with the city. He received a $54,000
commission. At the time, Baglin was a councilman.</TE>
<TE>   Some activists in Laguna Beach have argued that Baglin should not
have relinquished his role as a councilman in favor of his clients.
The higher the price he was able to negotiate in the deal, they said,
the higher the cost for taxpayers, and the higher his commission.</TE>
<TE>   Under the state's government code, elected officials are
prohibited from having a financial interest in any contract made by
them in their official capacity, or by any entity of which they are
members.</TE>
<TE>   The charge is a felony, punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 or
imprisonment. Those found guilty can also be banned permanently from
holding office in California.</TE>
<TE>   Molfetta said the indictment was disappointing but not surprising
given how frequently grand juries return indictments sought by
prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   "Orange County Grand Jury would indict me for being a Chippendale
dancer, and clearly I am not," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He maintained that Baglin was always upfront about his role as a
real estate agent, and argued that either the laws are being twisted
or the allegations are politically motivated.</TE>
<TE>   Asked to elaborate, he said that there "was a lot of acrimony"
among council members.</TE>
<TE>   Baglin, a Republican, was first elected to the council in 1978 and
lost his seat in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   He was reelected in 2000 and is in the middle of a four-year term.</TE>
<TE>   The felony conflict-of-interest case is the first against an
Orange County politician since Dave Garofalo, former Huntington Beach
mayor and city councilman, was prosecuted for repeatedly voting on
city matters involving companies that bought advertising from his
publishing business.</TE>

<HD>Man, 21, to Stand Trial in Slaying</HD>
<DH>The El Rio resident is accused of shooting a teen in
alleged attempt to steal a car stereo.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Fred Alvarez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge Thursday ordered an El Rio man to stand trial in the fatal
shooting of a Rio Mesa High School football player nearly three years
ago.</LD>
<LD>   Following a preliminary hearing, Marcus Moralez, 21, was held to
answer charges of murder, perjury and gang and weapons violations
stemming from the December 1999 shooting of Frank Miramontez, 17, who
was sitting in his car near his home.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Roland Purnell made the ruling after another
man, Jorge Navarro, testified that he was in the car with both
Moralez and Miramontez when the fatal shots were fired.</LD>
<TE>   Navarro, who last week refused to testify without his lawyer
present, did not directly implicate Moralez. But he said he was
sitting in the passenger seat, alongside Miramontez, when the shots
rang out.</TE>
<TE>   Moralez and another passenger were riding in the back seat,
Navarro said.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember looking at him--he was saying he was hurt," Navarro
said of Miramontez. "I jumped out of the car. When I jumped out of
the car is when I heard some more shots."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege that Moralez shot Miramontez six times in an
attempt to steal a car stereo. An expert testified last week that the
shots were fired at close range and likely came from the right rear
passenger seat, where Moralez was sitting.</TE>
<TE>   During cross examination, defense attorney Willard Wiksell
suggested that it could have been the other back seat passenger, and
not Moralez, who fired the shots.</TE>

<HD>This Design for a California Quarter Really Is All That
It's Cracked Up to Be</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HARVEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a public call went out for coin designs for California's new
quarter, Larry Orcutt of Reseda came up with a couple of daring
concepts. One would be "based on our state's fame for its
earthquakes," he said. "The quarter would be minted in two pieces,
broken along a fault line." The other would dramatize the tension
between Southern and Northern California (evident during the Angels'
triumph over the swooning Giants in the World Series).</LD>
<LD>   Either design, Orcutt pointed out, would bring "a literal sense to
the term 'two bits.' "</LD>
<LD>   Wake up, Malibu! Roberta Lemon noticed that a spa warning in
Malibu seemed to imply that part of the citizenry is, shall we say,
disengaged (see accompanying).</LD>
<TE>   Speaking of unconscious: John Fenn came upon the work of a sign
maker who could use some spelling advice from the local schoolkids
(see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Fetch, Gray! Good boy! Gil Chesterton, editor of a newsletter for
First Presbyterian Church of North Hollywood, wrote about a
congregant who ran into Gov. Gray Davis in the 1970s when the latter
was working with L.A. Mayor Tom Bradley. The churchgoer, Joe
Gallagher, said he asked Davis to help find his missing Great Dane,
Gemini. Davis dispatched searchers who found it.</TE>
<TE>   "I am grateful to Gray," Gallagher said, "and probably will vote
for him for governor -- certainly for dogcatcher."</TE>
<TE>   Who says anchoring TV news doesn't involve heavy lifting? I
mentioned the boo-boo at Fox TV after the World Series when the
camera panned from Edison Field to the station too early, catching
one anchor at her desk looking into a personal mirror and arranging
her hair.</TE>
<TE>   By coincidence, ex-KCBS anchor Hosea Sanders recalled a colorful
Channel 2 snafu to the media Web site ronfineman.com this week --
regrettably, one that viewers did not see.</TE>
<TE>   It involved KCBS' switch in 1986 to a "News Wheel" format, which
consisted of 20-minute theme segments ("Family," etc.) along with
headlines offered up a few times each hour. The "News Wheel" was "not
only a format name but also an actual rotating set," said Sanders
(now based in Chicago). And one night the "set got stuck during one
spin, forcing a couple of us anchor-types to get up and PUSH it into
position during a commercial."</TE>
<TE>   The "News Wheel," touted by the station as "the next generation"
of local news, was roasted by the critics. It stopped rotating for
good, on orders of management, a few weeks later.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: In the names-that-fit-the-job category, Lila Mankofsky
of Northridge saw an ad placed by a Porter Ranch physical therapist
named David Feeley.</TE>

<LD>I'm not going nuts. Not this cookie.</LD>
<LD>   Everyone knows the medical insurance industry can be frustrating.</LD>
<LD>   So when I belatedly came to recognize the cabal of forces lined up
against me -- a prestigious hospital, an insurance company and a
collection agency -- I was cool as a cucumber.</LD>
<TE>   The wickedness started innocently enough.</TE>
<TE>   I'd gone to my doctor in March for persistent shoulder pain. He
sent me downstairs for X-rays. Two weeks later another doctor gave me
a cortisone shot that eliminated the pain. I now recognize it as a
ploy to soften me up.</TE>
<TE>   The initial foray, if memory serves, came in May. The hospital
billed me for the $207.25 in laboratory expenses. I phoned, and a
nice woman said the bill probably crossed in the mail with the
insurance company's payment. She told me to ignore the bill.</TE>
<TE>   In hindsight, a very clever stratagem on her part.</TE>
<TE>   Some weeks later, a second bill arrived. Unaware it represented
Phase II of the plan to destroy me, I threw it away.</TE>
<TE>   By late summer, the full-scale assault was underway. The hospital
sent another notice, this time stating that if the bill weren't paid,
it would notify a collection agency.</TE>
<TE>   With a cool head, I phoned the insurance company. A nice woman
said all was well. I asked if she'd pass that on to the hospital, and
she said she would.</TE>
<TE>   Not long after, I got a letter from a collection agency saying the
hospital had directed it to begin proceedings against me if my debt
wasn't paid.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time during the summer-long campaign, I realized the
array of forces against me. While a lesser man would crumble, I
launched a full-scale counteroffensive.</TE>
<TE>   I arranged a conference call between the insurance company and the
hospital, during which the insurance company told the hospital that
it would handle the bill.</TE>
<TE>   I then asked the hospital representative if she would inform the
collection agency that I was in the clear. She said she would.</TE>
<TE>   Within another week or so, a second letter arrived from the
collection agency. It said it was on the verge of taking action
against me.</TE>
<TE>   I admit it -- I sobbed uncontrollably for an hour straight before
regrouping. The next day, I fired another double-barreled salvo,
forcing the collection people and the hospital rep to speak to each
other. In the face of this withering assault, the agency backed down.</TE>
<TE>   Far from done, I forced both hospital and agency to send me
letters verifying that they had talked and were calling off the dogs.</TE>
<TE>   I was exhausted. It had taken me months of intermittent anger,
frustration and bedtime anxiety to bring the Axis of Exasperation to
its knees.</TE>
<TE>   I thought it was over.</TE>
<TE>   But these people are good. They are very good.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, the hospital wrote: "The above-mentioned
account was billed to your insurance. However, we have not received
payment. The hospital would appreciate any assistance you may be able
to lend in resolving this matter."</TE>
<TE>   Simultaneously, the Axis opened a new front: In recent days,
solicitors offering to "consolidate my debts" have left messages on
my home phone.</TE>
<TE>   A coincidence? I think not!</TE>
<TE>   I again phoned both insurance company and hospital. As always, the
agents were polite. "Someone dropped the ball," the insurance company
representative said. "They are going to pay the claim," the hospital
representative said.</TE>
<TE>   They probably think they've got me. That I'm about to lose my
mind.</TE>
<TE>   Deluded? Paranoid? Don't make me laugh. I've never been sharper.</TE>

<LD>The San Fernando Valley's pornography industry has no official stand
on the secession question facing voters Tuesday. And the truth is,
neither side in the secession debate is looking for the endorsement
of the adult entertainment business, even if it is one of the biggest
dollar-generators in the Valley.</LD>
<LD>   But actors, producers, directors and health-care providers for the
billion-dollar industry have seized on the secession campaign as an
opportunity to demand more recognition -- and support -- from local
government.</LD>
<LD>   Some say they believe their industry will fare better under an
independent Valley city, despite perceptions that a breakaway city
would be more conservative than Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   "We are the Valley," said Shayla Laveaux, 32, an adult performer
and producer who runs Shayla Productions with her cinematographer
husband. They live in West Hills with two dogs. "The Valley depends
on what we do."</TE>
<TE>   Laveaux said she has been studying her sample ballot, and
secession looks like a way to get more respect for the industry.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Lyon, executive director of the Chatsworth-based Free Speech
Coalition, which represents porn companies, agrees.</TE>
<TE>   "We would become more important to the swing of things," he said.
"We might have a greater voice with elected officials."</TE>
<TE>   Lyon is scheduled today to address the Valley Industry and
Commerce Assn.'s annual conference in Woodland Hills. VICA, a Valley
cityhood backer, will look at porn's increasing impact on the local
economy.</TE>
<TE>   Many workers for X-rated companies want city business-tax
incentives for the industry and funding for a health clinic.</TE>
<TE>   "Seceding may generate better return on our tax dollars," said
Daniel Metcalf, a spokesman for Wicked Pictures in Canoga Park, one
of the industry's biggest production companies.</TE>
<TE>   According to the industry's estimates, porn employs 9,000 people
in the Valley, and generates $30 million a year in state sales taxes.
The Valley produces more than 80% of the nation's porn and 90% of its
sex-related toys.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp. lumps in porn
with the mainstream entertainment industry, which employs about
227,700 workers in the area and generated more than $30 billion in
gross revenues last year. Jack Kyser, the group's director of
economic research, said the adult industry's contribution to the
sector, while not specifically broken out, is substantial.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people may turn up their noses, but, anecdotally, it
generates significant revenues for the local economy," said Kyser,
who will speak at today's VICA conference.</TE>
<TE>   Moral issues aside, Valley secession leader Richard Katz said
elected officials would be remiss to ignore the porn industry.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is that it is a huge industry, and while the rest of
[mainstream] production is fleeing Southern California, the adult
entertainment industry is staying here," he said. "It puts a lot of
people to work."</TE>
<TE>   No one can -- or wants to -- say exactly how secession might
affect the porn industry, or the economies of a new Valley and the
remaining L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "It's never come up," said Kam Kuwata, anti-secession strategist
for Mayor James K. Hahn. "In all honesty, I've done zero research....
I think I'll stay away from it."</TE>
<TE>   Valley secessionists also shied away from the topic.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no opinion," said Richard Close, chairman of the leading
Valley breakaway group. "I don't know of any pluses or minuses."</TE>
<TE>   Adult entertainers said such responses are typical.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll take our money and watch our products," said Sharon
Mitchell, 44, an ex-porn star who runs a Sherman Oaks health clinic
specializing in the "special needs of a sex worker."</TE>
<TE>   "But will they [help fund efforts to prevent] chlamydia and
gonorrhea? No."</TE>

<LD>Santa Rosa Valley homemaker Socorro Caro, convicted of murdering
three of her sons in 1999, has been ordered to pay her ex-husband $45
million in a civil lawsuit.</LD>
<LD>   The judgment against Caro, who is awaiting execution in state
prison, was issued last week by Ventura County Superior Court Judge
Henry Walsh. Physician Xavier Caro had sued his wife, alleging
wrongful death.</LD>
<LD>   "The evidence was irrefutable," said Keith Sipprelle, Xavier
Caro's attorney. "She committed the murders and Dr. Caro was severely
damaged as a result."</LD>
<TE>   Acting on a motion for summary judgment, to which Socorro Caro did
not respond, Walsh awarded Xavier Caro $15 million for each child.</TE>
<TE>   Although divorced, the couple's marital assets are still being
divided in court. Though Socorro Caro may have been entitled to half
of the assets, she could be left with nothing.</TE>

<LD>   James Robertson, 56, of Thousand Oaks faces up to a year in county
jail when he is sentenced Dec. 9. He is free on bail.</LD>
<LD>   Robertson was originally charged with 20 misdemeanor counts, which
included one count for each printed picture of child porn that
authorities found in his home. He pleaded guilty to two of those
counts.</LD>
<TE>   The maximum penalty for a conviction on all 20 counts also would
have been a year in jail, county prosecutors said.</TE>

<LD>In the first of what are expected to be many departures from the top
levels of the Los Angeles Police Department, Assistant Chief David
Gascon announced Thursday that he is leaving the force after 31
years.</LD>
<LD>   Best known as the face of the department during the murder
investigation of O.J. Simpson, Gascon appeared before a gathering of
several dozen department officials, including new Chief William J.
Bratton.</LD>
<LD>   "He has served this organization honorably," Bratton said. "He has
seen the best of times, the worst of times. He has helped to position
the department to move beyond the worst of times."</LD>
<TE>   Gascon's announcement comes days after Bratton dressed down top
commanders at a staff meeting, insisting on absolute loyalty to his
vision for the LAPD, including top-to-bottom reform and open exchange
of information with the public and media.</TE>
<TE>   Gascon, 53, was one of three assistant chiefs who served under
former Chief Bernard C. Parks and was widely expected to be replaced
if he stayed in the LAPD. Bratton told top brass this week that he
planned to make a historic number of promotions because of many
anticipated retirements.</TE>
<TE>   Gascon said he intends to continue teaching part time at UCLA,
work with nonprofit agencies and develop entertainment-related
projects.</TE>

<HD>Wife in Poison Case Testifies</HD>
<DH>Accused of killing her husband, former toxicologist Kristin
Rossum tells of ballet lessons and her drug addiction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Beth Silver</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Kristin Rossum, the former toxicologist accused of staging her
husband's death to look like a suicide, took the witness stand in her
own defense Thursday, often sobbing before a packed courtroom.</LD>
<LD>   The 26-year-old told of a happy childhood growing up with her two
younger brothers and her parents, both college professors. She
recounted her high school days, becoming addicted to methamphetamine,
a suicide attempt, and the first time she met her future husband,
Greg de Villers.</LD>
<LD>   Rossum testified for an hour. She is scheduled to continue at 9
a.m. today.</LD>
<TE>   She has yet to discuss an affair she had with her boss, Michael
Robertson, or her husband's death. And prosecutors have yet to
cross-examine her.</TE>
<TE>   Although it is somewhat unusual for a defendant to testify in her
own murder trial, Rossum has occupied the witness box before. She
testified in cases she handled as an assistant in the San Diego
County medical examiner's office.</TE>
<TE>   It is from that office that prosecutors allege she stole drugs to
satisfy her drug habit and to kill her husband.</TE>
<TE>   De Villers, who was 26, died Nov. 6, 2000, at their La Jolla
apartment with rose petals strewn across his body and a photo from
their wedding propped up by his head.</TE>
<TE>   Rossum's voice was calm while talking of her love for science and
ballet, and shaky when her testimony turned to her former drug
addiction and the disappointment it brought to her parents.</TE>
<TE>   De Villers died of poisoning from fentanyl, a painkiller said to
be 100 times more potent than morphine.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors argue that Rossum killed De Villers because she feared
her husband would tell her employers she had a history of drug abuse
and that he would expose an affair she was having with her boss at
the medical examiner's office.</TE>
<TE>   But Rossum's attorneys contend that De Villers ingested the
fentanyl because he was despondent. Rossum had told him that she
planned to leave him.</TE>
<TE>   Though the drugs that killed De Villers could have come from the
lab where Rossum worked, her attorneys say prosecutors can't prove
who administered them.</TE>

<HD>Thousand Oaks' Decision on Land Upheld by Judge</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Superior Court judge ruled Thursday that Thousand Oaks did not
violate its open space protection law in February when it gave
permission for three estate homes to be erected on a site once
proposed for a private equestrian center.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling came in a suit filed by City Council hopeful Michael
Farris, a former planning commissioner. Farris' lawsuit maintained
that a 1996 ordinance required a vote of the people before any
building could occur on the 8.7-acre parcel.</LD>
<LD>   But Judge Kent M. Kellegrew sided with Thousand Oaks officials,
who said the site was always designated as "low density" residential.
Kellegrew's ruling further stated that the city did not violate state
planning or zoning laws, that it properly complied with state
environmental regulations and that it did not need to seek voter
approval to develop the property.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought all along that this wasn't based on any logical
arguments," said City Atty. Mark G. Sellers. "It was politically
motivated."</TE>
<TE>   In exchange for building the homes, landowner Operating Engineers
Pension Trust promises to give the city $2.5 million to help pay for
an equestrian facility at nearby Rancho Potrero.</TE>

<HD>Prosecution Rests Against Ryder; Judge Rebukes Defense
Attorney</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The district attorney's office rested its shoplifting case against
actress Winona Ryder on Thursday after defense attorney Mark Geragos
attacked the motives of a key prosecution witness who testified that
Ryder had walked out of Saks Fifth Avenue with more than $5,500 worth
of unpaid merchandise.</LD>
<LD>   Geragos accused the former security guard of fabricating
statements, embellishing her testimony and selling the story of
Ryder's December shopping trip. The accusations, which guard Colleen
Rainey denied, drew strong rebukes from Superior Court Judge Elden S.
Fox, who threatened to hold Geragos in contempt and warned him to
watch his behavior.</LD>
<LD>   In all, the prosecution called six witnesses during four days of
testimony, concluding with a Beverly Hills police detective who
testified that he had heard Ryder say she was trying to get into the
character of a kleptomaniac for a film role. The officer was the
third witness to mention Ryder's giving such an explanation for her
behavior. Geragos and Ryder's publicist have suggested that the
witnesses twisted a conversation Ryder had about possible projects.</LD>
<TE>   Geragos plans to present his case beginning today and the jury
could start deliberations early next week. Ryder, 31, accused of
stealing more than $5,500 in designer merchandise on Dec. 12, is
charged with felony grand theft, burglary and vandalism and could
face three years in state prison if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Rainey testified Wednesday that she had peered through slats in a
dressing room door and seen the actress tending to a bleeding finger
and using scissors to cut sensor tags from merchandise. Under
questioning from Geragos, she acknowledged Thursday that she had not
included that observation in written statements dated Dec. 12 and 13.
Rainey said she didn't have any explanation for the omissions, except
that she was trying to be brief.</TE>
<TE>   Rainey also said she had not actually seen Ryder cut her finger,
prompting Geragos to accuse her of making up the story.</TE>
<TE>   Geragos also questioned Rainey about her ability to see through
the slats at just the precise angle necessary to see Ryder cutting
tags. Rainey testified that she had not told a nearby sales associate
what she had seen.</TE>
<TE>   Rainey told jurors that she and her husband, who writes
screenplays, started a writing and business services company two
weeks after charges were filed against Ryder and that they had
received deposits totaling $50,000 over the next several months. Her
husband bought a new Ford Expedition after the business was started,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Geragos asked whether Rainey had sold her story and profited from
Ryder's case, but she insisted that her husband had received the
money from his work as a financial consultant. She said she has never
given interviews to tabloid newspapers or entertainment shows.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Geragos asked her to look at financial documents
very carefully. "I don't want you to commit any further act of
perjury," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor quickly objected and Fox then warned Geragos that
he would be held in contempt if he made such statements again. Fox
reprimanded Geragos a second time after Geragos asked Beverly Hills
Det. Mark Parker why he was lying.</TE>
<TE>   The detective, a 20-year veteran, testified that when he got to
Saks, Ryder appeared calm and was smiling. But as Parker read
Rainey's written report, he said, Ryder became nervous and asked what
would happen. Parker testified that he then asked Ryder if she had
any weapons and she responded that she had scissors. Under
cross-examination, Parker said he couldn't remember whether Ryder had
given him the scissors or whether Rainey had reached into Ryder's
pocket to retrieve them.</TE>
<TE>   Saks security guard Ernest Amaya testified Thursday that when he
approached Ryder, who was carrying bags of merchandise outside the
store, the actress apologized and said she thought her assistant had
paid. A 90-minute surveillance tape screened earlier this week for
jurors showed no assistant with Ryder inside Saks.</TE>
<TE>   Amaya also said Ryder had been cooperative and pleasant. When
asked if she had any more Saks merchandise, Ryder lifted her shirt
slightly and said no, Amaya testified. Geragos had accused guards in
his opening statement of having lifted Ryder's shirt in the detention
room.</TE>
<TE>   Fox also ruled after a brief hearing Thursday that Ryder's right
to a fair trial outweighed the public's right of access to certain
motions and transcripts in the case. The hearing was held at the
direction of a state appellate court, which determined this week that
Fox had erred in denying access to the media without making adequate
legal findings.</TE>
<TE>   "The pervasive nature of the media coverage creates a substantial
probability that the interests of the accused in a fair trial will be
prejudiced if the records are disclosed," Fox read from his ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Fox called the case unique and said he would not release
transcripts of closed proceedings about Ryder's alleged prior acts
during the trial. He said he would review and release transcripts of
hearings on two other motions, dealing with the search for the
scissors and statements Ryder allegedly made.</TE>
<TE>   The judge also declined to release completed jury questionnaires
until the trial is over</TE>
<TE>   Al Wickers, an attorney representing The Times, said that he does
not believe Fox properly applied the law and that there is no
evidence to support his ruling that secrecy is required. Wickers said
The Times, which filed legal action in appellate court with the
Associated Press and the Los Angeles Daily Journal, is considering a
further challenge.</TE>

<HD>Last-Minute Blitzes Planned as Secession Decision Nears</HD>
<DH>Backers and foes of Valley and Hollywood cityhood schedule
a flurry of activities aimed at getting voters to the polls on
Tuesday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Both sides in the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood secession
campaigns geared up their get-out-the-vote drives Thursday, with
breakup opponents ready to deploy several hundred union members to
walk precincts, and supporters of the cityhood proposals calling on
smaller numbers of volunteers to knock on doors.</LD>
<LD>   Leaders of the campaigns said the secession measures will produce
a strong turnout by Los Angeles voters Tuesday, more so than the
governor's race.</LD>
<LD>   "People realize this is an important issue," said Valley
Independence Committee Co-chairman Carlos Ferreyra. "They realize
this could change Los Angeles forever. I've talked to people who have
not voted in the last few years who plan to vote this time."</LD>
<TE>   Ferreyra estimated the turnout could be as high as 63% in Los
Angeles, and even higher in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   California Secretary of State Bill Jones forecast a 58% turnout
statewide. He did not offer a prediction for Los Angeles but said the
secession battle is expected to edge up the numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "It figured prominently in our analysis because of the very large
population base involved," Jones said. "Very seldom have we seen an
issue affecting so many people."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy City Clerk Frank Martinez predicted that if the statewide
turnout is 58%, the Los Angeles turnout would be slightly higher.</TE>
<TE>   In the last gubernatorial general election, in 1998, 52.8% of Los
Angeles' registered voters cast ballots. The statewide turnout was
57.6%.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Valley secessionists sent about 150 volunteers into
the field to urge voters to go to the polls. They hope to have 600 to
1,000 people walking neighborhoods over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood secession campaign began an automated telephone
effort Thursday that will reach 30,000 Hollywood voters and 100,000
in other parts of the city, according to chairman Gene La Pietra.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday afternoon, Hollywood secessionists will hold a rally
to encourage women to vote, and about 250 volunteers will be out in
neighborhoods supporting Hollywood cityhood, La Pietra said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm absolutely confident," he said.</TE>
<TE>   County Federation of Labor chief Miguel Contreras said he will
have 1,500 union members canvassing precincts to drum up votes
against secession.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn, who is leading the anti-secession campaign,
lined up a string of public events for the home stretch. Today he is
scheduled to meet in the Valley with Police Chief William Bratton.
Earlier in the day, Hahn will join Councilman Dennis Zine at a City
Hall news conference in calling for a legal challenge of an
environmental study that could advance the Ahmanson Ranch
development.</TE>
<TE>   Fighting the 3,050-home project is considered a vote-getter in the
Valley because large numbers of residents have tried to stop it.</TE>
<TE>   And Hahn has promoted Bratton's recent hiring as the answer to
demands for improved policing in the secession areas.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn is also scheduled to have lunch with Bratton and clergy from
throughout the Valley at Valley Beth Shalom in Encino at the same
time the mayor was to have delivered a "State of the Valley" speech
to the Valley Industry and Commerce Assn., which has endorsed
secession. Hahn backed out of the VICA engagement.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday morning, the mayor will attend a labor rally in the
city of San Fernando, after which union members will fan out into
Valley neighborhoods. Hahn plans to walk precincts in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "We are running around a lot, stopping by a lot of the phone banks
and other operations that are out there in our final days," Hahn
said. "We are making a big push."</TE>
<TE>   He predicted a healthy turnout Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very important issue for Los Angeles, the future of the
city," he said. "I think that will help bring more people out to
vote."</TE>
<TE>   However, Larry Levine of the anti-secession group One L.A., said
some turnout predictions may be overly optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   As of Thursday, 486,000 people in Los Angeles County had requested
absentee ballots, down from 501,000 for the same period in 1998,
Levine noted.</TE>
<TE>   He also said the failure of the Valley secession campaign to meet
its goals for fund-raising and volunteers may blunt turnout in the
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern
California, which opposes secession, sent a letter to City Atty.
Rocky Delgadillo voicing concern that secessionists were not given
the same access as their opponents at an Oct. 5 public event at the
Convention Center.</TE>

<TE>   Observers disagreed about which side would get a boost from a

<TE>   Because secession is considered by some a conservative proposal,
and conservative voters tend to go to the polls disproportionately,
the breakup measures could "benefit slightly" from a low turnout,
said Fernando Guerra, head of the Center for the Study of Los Angeles
at Loyola Marymount University. But he also said a turnout of 60%-65%
in Los Angeles would not surprise him.</TE>
<TE>   Republican political strategist Allan Hoffenblum said secession
supporters are more passionate than opponents, so they might turn out
in greater numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "I would think a higher turnout would help us keep the city
together," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The voters who are going to come out for secession would come out
anyway, whether it's high turnout or low turnout. A greater turnout
would have more people who are sympathetic to the idea of keeping the
city together."</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern
California, which opposes secession, sent a letter to City Atty.
Rocky Delgadillo voicing concern that secessionists were not given
the same access as their opponents at an Oct. 5 public event held at
the Convention Center.</TE>
<TE>   At the event, a gathering of neighborhood council activists,
anti-secessionists distributed literature from a table near the
entrance, while secession supporters wanting to hand out fliers were
told to leave.</TE>
<TE>   The letter asked Delgadillo to respond by Nov. 4 with information
on how the city will prevent such an incident from recurring.</TE>

<HD>Distinct Philosophies Define Rivals for Secretary of State</HD>
<DH>Although voter turnout is important to both candidates,
their backgrounds divide their approaches along party lines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Reiterman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Both major candidates for secretary of state want to increase voter
turnout, wipe out voting fraud and modernize the way Californians
cast ballots. But there the similarities end.</LD>
<LD>   Assemblyman Kevin Shelley, son of a former San Francisco mayor, is
an admittedly intense liberal Democrat with a reputation for ramming
bills through the legislative process and rough treatment of his
staff.</LD>
<LD>   Keith Olberg, who has a doctorate in constitutional law, is a
former assemblyman from Southern California who has lifelong
Republican credentials and is working for a controversial charter
school.</LD>
<TE>   "We frequently squared off on policy issues," Olberg recalls of
his days in the Assembly with Shelley. Now they are squared off in a
tight race for a job that both say is the first line of defense of
the right to vote.</TE>
<TE>   The importance of the secretary of state's job was elevated
dramatically after the Florida balloting fiasco in the last
presidential election. And history has demonstrated that the post can
be a political steppingstone.</TE>
<TE>   With their power bases at opposite ends of the state, neither
Olberg nor Shelley enjoys a high profile outside his area. But
Shelley has relied heavily on traditional Democratic support, such as
organized labor and trial lawyers, to gain the upper hand in
fund-raising. He reported $1.2 million in cash on hand as of Oct. 19.
Olberg reported about half as much in his coffers as the contest
heads toward Tuesday's vote.</TE>
<TE>   Olberg, 42, is a Chicago native who says he groomed himself for
public service by studying political science, including his doctoral
work at Claremont Graduate University.</TE>
<TE>   His early career cemented his pro-business GOP credentials. In the
1980s, he worked in the Reagan and Bush administrations. In the early
1990s, he served as director of governmental affairs for the Building
Industry Assn. Then he won a seat in the California Assembly in 1994
and served the maximum six years, representing the high desert and
eastern Sierra Nevada regions of Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   One of Olberg's successful bills required high school students to
specifically study the Constitution, the Bill of Rights and other
pieces of the national heritage during civics and U.S. government
classes. Another bill created a bipartisan commission to examine
issues posed by campaign activity on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   He also sponsored a bill that would have lifted state caps on the
number of state-funded charter schools.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving the Legislature in 2000, Olberg worked for the
California Charter Academy, a Victorville-based charter school that
with three other schools operates programs in 51 locations that
annually receive several million dollars in state funding.</TE>
<TE>   Olberg described himself in his campaign biography as "founding
and managing director" of Valley Preparatory School, a new public
charter school based on "the classical model of education."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Olberg said he is being paid $120,000 a year to
develop the college prep school, but it is not built, a site has not
been selected, and the number of students has not been decided. "I'm
putting together a model of what the school should look like,
including graduation requirements," he said.</TE>
<TE>   State education officials have requested a state controller's
audit of the Victorville-based academy, the largest charter group,
because they have received complaints from parents, teachers and
others. Eileen Cubansky of the state Department of Education said the
complaints involve everything from student recruitment methods and
curriculum to school finances and teacher compensation.</TE>
<TE>   Olberg said he is confident that an audit will show no wrongdoing.
"Any audit ... would prove they lived by the law and have gone well
above it in terms of accountability," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Shelley, 46, a graduate of UC's Hastings Law School, is steeped in
San Francisco's Democratic establishment. His father was Mayor Jack
Shelley. The candidate worked on the staff of the late Rep. Phil
Burton before serving on the county Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Shelley was elected to the Assembly in 1996. As Assembly majority
leader since 1998, he has increasingly has zeroed in on the secretary
of state's job. He sat on the panel dealing with elections issues. He
wrote the law allowing Californians to register for permanent
vote-by-mail status and Proposition 41, a $200-million bond issue
approved by voters in March to help counties modernize voting
equipment. He also wrote a corporate disclosure law recently signed
by the governor.</TE>
<TE>   While Shelley has touted his legislative record, Olberg has
questioned whether he has the temperament to manage a state office
with more than 500 employees. In 1998, then-Assembly Speaker Antonio
Villaraigosa sent an aide to help run Shelley's office after staffers
complained that he was verbally abusive. Records show that the aide
worked for a year as Shelley's chief of staff, and that about 100
employees have passed through Shelley's office, most before 2001. The
present staff is 19.</TE>
<TE>   Shelley said that his staff turnover "probably" is high, but that
his office is productive. "I am a very tough boss," he said. "There
was no problem, except my style. It was how demanding I was and the
aggressiveness of the demand."</TE>
<TE>   He said he likes to think that getting married and becoming a
father a year ago have "taken a little edge off my demanding style."</TE>
<TE>   Olberg also has criticized Shelley for accepting $10,000 in
contributions from Elections Systems and Software, a Nebraska company
vying for the business of counties that will receive Proposition 41
funds.</TE>
<TE>   In turn, Shelley has hammered Olberg for a bill he introduced in
1998 and later dropped. A committee analysis said it would have
subjected some women who undergo abortions to murder charges. Both
candidates say they want to increase voter outreach, especially to
young people, to boost turnout. But they part company on Proposition
52, which would allow voters to register on election day.</TE>
<TE>   Shelley said the measure would increase voter participation and
penalties for voter fraud. Olberg said he fears same-day registration
would result in abuses that would undercut the integrity of the
election process.</TE>
<TE>   They are up against several minor-party candidates:</TE>
<TE>   * Ed Noonan of the American Independent Party is a Marysville
Internet provider whose concerns center on gathering petition
signatures.</TE>
<TE>   * Gail Lightfoot, the Libertarian candidate and a retired nurse
from Pismo Beach, expects to win 4% of the vote on her name alone,
which some wrongly think is Native American.</TE>
<TE>   * Valli Sharpe-Geisler of the Reform Party, a technical
coordinator for a San Jose public school district, said she opposes
pure electronic voting systems.</TE>
<TE>   * Larry Shoup of the Green Party, an Oakland land-use consultant,
said his cause is reducing money's role in politics.</TE>
<TE>   * The Natural Law Party's Louise Marie Allison, a teacher in
Claremont, said she wants to "create a peace-keeping task force ...
to prevent terrorism/violence."</TE>

<HD>Ventura County Seeks Clergy Sex Case Files</HD>
<DH>Retiring D.A. wants Cardinal Mahony to provide documents on
at least 15 incidents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilson and Richard Winton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury is demanding that
Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of the Los Angeles Archdiocese surrender
documents related to at least 15 clergy sex-abuse cases in the last
three decades.</LD>
<LD>   In a strongly worded letter, Bradbury told Mahony that despite
promises to assist law enforcement, the nation's largest archdiocese
"remains an obstacle, protecting priests while endangering future
victims."</LD>
<LD>   "We believe you have evidence of criminal sexual abuse that you
are refusing to provide to law enforcement," Bradbury wrote in a
letter delivered Wednesday. "It is time that the safety of children
be put ahead of the fear of scandal."</LD>
<TE>   At least three former Ventura County priests are suspected of
molesting at least 15 children beginning in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Although the letter does not identify the priests, authorities
have previously confirmed that Carl Sutphin, Michael Wempe and
Fidencio Silva are under investigation for allegedly molesting at
least a dozen boys during the 1970s and 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Bradbury, who retires today, released his letter Thursday in hopes
of stepping up public pressure on the church to turn over evidence
prosecutors want before deciding whether to file criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, investigators want documentation of victims' reports
of sex abuse, names of witnesses who were present when the suspected
priests were confronted and reports by the priests' therapists.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors in Ventura and Los Angeles counties contend the
information is not subject to legal privacy protections.</TE>
<TE>   J. Michael Hennigan, attorney for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles,
which includes both counties, said the church has cooperated with law
enforcement, but cannot provide some of the requested information.</TE>
<TE>   "We have turned over the names of priests and critical information
about every known incident in Ventura County," Hennigan said.</TE>
<TE>   But under state law, the church is not free to hand over employee
records, he said. In Los Angeles County, prosecutors and the
archdiocese have relied on a retired judge to determine what can be
turned over.</TE>
<TE>   "We can follow that procedure in Ventura County," Hennigan
suggested.</TE>
<TE>   Since June, the Los Angeles County Grand Jury has issued subpoenas
for at least 17 priests' files. The archdiocese agreed to release
them, but the priests' attorney has blocked the release, pending a
ruling from an appellate court.</TE>
<TE>   "We are pursuing every available means to obtaining documents we
believe to be admissible evidence in these cases," Los Angeles County
Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley said.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County prosecutors say they are trying to get the
documents without wasting time in court.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael K. Frawley said prosecutors have
already spent six months building cases against the priests. And they
do not want to rely solely on victims' statements, particularly when
the alleged acts occurred decades ago, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Frawley said the archdiocese is sitting on strong corroborating
evidence and prosectors see no reason why it should not be turned
over.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that they haven't done this is just outrageous," he
said. "We know when accusations come in against priests, the priests
are confronted and in some cases the priests make admissions. That is
significant evidence of criminal conduct."</TE>
<TE>   Frawley declined to comment on whether his office would call
Mahony before a grand jury if the documents are not provided.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year Cooley threatened Mahony with a grand jury
investigation unless the archdiocese turned over similar documents.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Los Angeles prosecutors have filed criminal charges
against three former priests. Michael Stephen Baker, the retired
Father G. Neville Rucker and Carlos Rene Rodriguez face multiple
allegations of child molestation.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley said this week that "additional prosecutions of priests for
child sexual abuse will be forthcoming."</TE>
<TE>   According to Los Angeles law enforcement agencies, about 70
current and former priests are under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement sources also say considerable evidence exists
against the three former Ventura County priests.</TE>
<TE>   Two men have sued the archdiocese alleging Sutphin, a 70-year-old
retired priest, abused them during the 1970s on an overnight trip to
Saticoy, near Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said he required Sutphin to undergo psychological
counseling when he learned of the abuse allegations in the 1990s, and
then forced him to retire early this year. Sutphin formerly worked as
a chaplain at St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   Wempe, 62, is under investigation by Los Angeles County and
Ventura County law enforcement agencies for allegedly molesting three
boys between 1976 and 1985 while serving at St. Jude Church in
Westlake Village.</TE>
<TE>   Wempe has been sued by three boys, including a former altar boy
who alleges the retired priest molested him between 1975 and 1977.</TE>
<TE>   Silva, 54, who is living in Mexico, is being investigated for
allegedly sexually abusing eight boys from 1979 to 1985 at Our Lady
of Guadalupe Church in Oxnard. The men, including two who are now
police officers, sued Silva and the archdiocese in May, alleging
battery, negligent supervision and sexual abuse.</TE>

<HD>Unemployment Claims Rise Sharply in Valley This Year</HD>
<DH>A new report says the number of those seeking benefits
reached an eight-year high. Economists blame recession's effects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Karima A. Haynes</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New claims for unemployment insurance in the San Fernando Valley hit
an eight-year high between 2001 and 2002, suggesting a slow economic
rebound from the national recession and the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks, according to a Cal State Northridge report being issued
today.</LD>
<LD>   Unemployment insurance claims in just the first two quarters of
2002 were 39% higher than for all of 2001, researchers said.</LD>
<LD>   By comparison, the number of unemployed workers who sought
benefits rose 25% between 2000 and 2001.</LD>
<TE>   The spike in unemployment insurance claims does not necessarily
mean the Valley is still in the grip of recession, researchers said,
because unemployment rates tend to lag behind other economic
indicators.</TE>
<TE>   Economic forecasters predict that the number of unemployment
insurance claims will begin to drop as normal seasonal employment
patterns take hold and the region continues to build on a 2% increase
in job growth that it posted last year.</TE>
<TE>   "The unemployment numbers are at very high levels, and smart
economic development policies that promote job growth would help
address the current high unemployment numbers," said Daniel Blake,
director of CSUN's San Fernando Valley Economic Research Center,
which conducted the study.</TE>
<TE>   The report also shows that there is a severe housing crunch in the
Valley as demand continues to outstrip supply, resulting in rapidly
rising home prices and rents, researchers said.</TE>
<TE>   The median price for resale homes in the Valley hit $320,000 in
June, compared to a median price -- meaning one half the prices are
higher and one half lower -- of $279,000 for all of Los Angeles
County, according to the report. The region's average price of homes
and condominiums was $355,000 in June 2002 compared to $295,000 in
June 2001, a 20% increase.</TE>
<TE>   Apartment vacancy rates, currently averaging 2.8% in the second
half of 2002, have continued to decline since the 1994 Northridge
earthquake and the recession of the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   The amount of available industrial space in the region rose
throughout 2001 and into the first quarter of 2002, reaching a 5.5%
vacancy rate before falling back to 5% in the second quarter of 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Office vacancy rates currently are up 13% after falling to 9% in
2000.</TE>
<TE>   The report, which is to be presented at today's 14th annual
business forecast conference of the Valley Industry &amp; Commerce Assn.,
also illustrates the impact of the entertainment industry on the
region, which shed some 8,800 jobs last year.</TE>
<TE>   The entertainment sector accounts for slightly more than 105,000,
or 16%, of private-sector jobs in the vast region that researchers
examined, which includes the Valley, the community of Hidden Hills
and the cities of Burbank, Glendale, Calabasas and San Fernando.</TE>
<TE>   "We anticipate that the decline in 2002 will be followed by a
recovery in 2003 that will be driven by the movie industry and
technology sector," said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los
Angeles Economic Development Corp., who is expected to present his
forecast at the conference.</TE>
<TE>   The region will benefit economically from increased defense
spending as the nation continues its war on terrorism, Kyser said.</TE>
<TE>   "As these terrorist groups shift shape and try to get their hands
on the latest technology, we will need to stay ahead of them," he
said. "Although most of the large aerospace manufacturing has gone,
we are still strong in research and development and that will be
driving what goes on in the years ahead."</TE>
<TE>   Also, he said, the outcome of the secession question will be a
major factor in the economy as the focus is likely to intensify on
issues including education, housing, infrastructure and water, among
others.</TE>

<HD>13th District Candidates Just Want a Little Respect</HD>
<DH></DH>

<LD>Some of Los Angeles' most-affluent communities are in the 13th
district of the proposed San Fernando Valley city council, an area
that includes Sherman Oaks, Encino and Tarzana. Its homeowner groups
are among the city's most powerful, and are eagerly courted by
politicians.</LD>
<LD>   Yet, according to the seven candidates for the 13th district seat,
feelings of neglect by City Hall run high.</LD>
<LD>   The council hopefuls say that the area is over-taxed and
under-served by Los Angeles government, and that secession would
bring lower taxes and better services. The winner will take office
only if the Valley cityhood measure wins Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   Frank Joseph Cordon, 76, a Tarzana resident who is the retired
chief executive officer of Heritage Insurance Group, said he is
running because of his "disgust with everything that's transpiring in
City Hall," such as the recent Belmont school controversy. Cordon
said that, if secession succeeds and if he is elected, he would focus
first on "developing a budget we can live with, reducing taxes and
establishing town hall meetings to get feedback from the community."</TE>
<TE>   Virginia S. Depew, 82, a real estate broker and former elementary
school teacher, said she is a candidate because "downtown has no idea
how to run a government efficiently." Depew, of Sherman Oaks, favors
lowering real estate and sales taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "With local control and honest, responsive government, the Valley
can evolve into a model city with a school system rivaling the best
in the country," she said.</TE>
<TE>   J. Richard Leyner, 65, a commercial real estate broker who also
lives in Sherman Oaks, wants to create a "business-friendly,
neighborhood-responsive government." He would phase out the gross
receipts tax on businesses and "empower neighborhood councils with
the authority to make decisions."</TE>
<TE>   Marvin D. Rowen, 71, a retired Superior Court judge who now works
for a mediation and arbitration firm, lives in Tarzana. Rowen said
that a smaller city government would lead to "better police and fire
departments, decent mass public transit, libraries, museums and
social services."</TE>
<TE>   Rowen said his mediation skills would be valuable in a new
government: "I'm a problem-solver, rather than a problem-maker," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth Scalir, 32, a Sherman Oaks marketing researcher, is
emphasizing his liberal beliefs. "I want people to know you can be
for a Valley city and still be liberal and progressive," he said.
Scalir said he favors "strong rent control and a higher minimum
wage."</TE>
<TE>   Scalir also said crime-fighting strategies should include measures
such as expanded after-school programs. "I don't want to just throw
people in jail," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence A. Schapiro, 41, is co-president of 9 Yards
Entertainment, a television and movie production company. The Encino
resident is unique among the district's council candidates in that he
is neutral on secession. "I do not campaign on it," he said. "I did
not attend the rallies."</TE>
<TE>   Schapiro, who has lived in Encino since elementary school, said
his many years living in the district set him apart. "I'm afraid some
activists who have lived in the district for 5 or 10 years are
interested in the Valley becoming its own city because they see it as
an opportunity to get a city council position," Schapiro said.</TE>
<TE>   "If we do become our own city, I want to make sure there is a
candidate who loves our district as much as I do."</TE>
<TE>   Candidate Sam Saifi did not return phone calls requesting an
interview.</TE>

<HD>Fatal Shooting of Rap Pioneer in Studio Jolts Fans and
Peers</HD>
<DH>Authorities unsure of the motive for killing Jam Master Jay
of the group Run-DMC.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Geoff Boucher and Paul Lieberman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A day after rap pioneer Jam Master Jay of Run-DMC was gunned down in
a New York studio, the hip-hop community was in pained shock on
Thursday after its latest episode of violence claimed someone whose
career had been far removed from the so-called thug life.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike the gangster ethos embraced by many of today's top rap
acts, the rhymes of the trio Run-DMC in hits such as "My Adidas,"
"Rock Box" and "It's Tricky" were party music with street style and
blended hip-hop with rock bombast. As members of the Queens, N.Y.,
group aged, their topics drifted more and more to the inspirational
and the positive.</LD>
<LD>   That made the slaying of the 37-year-old DJ, whose real name was
Jason Mizell, especially jolting for fans and peers alike, even as
police said Thursday evening that the motive for the shooting was
still uncertain.</LD>
<TE>   "For nearly 20 years, Run-DMC has been the closest thing to gospel
artists that the contemporary music community has had," music mogul
Russell Simmons said in a statement Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "They talked about God and their higher selves, the importance of
staying away from drugs, and generally inspirational and uplifting
subject matter. They represented everything good and positive about
hip-hop."</TE>
<TE>   New York Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said the victim was
killed by a single shot to the head at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday,
reportedly while playing a video game with Uriel Rincon, 25, who was
shot once in the leg. Rincon, who was treated at a hospital and
released, was one of five witnesses questioned by detectives, who
were trying to reconcile differences in their accounts.</TE>
<TE>   "Questioning is ongoing," Kelly said. "There were conflicting
reports whether there were one or two invaders, shooters."</TE>
<TE>   Police also disclosed that as a precaution, they advised another
Queens rap artist, 50 Cent, to skip a scheduled show at a Times
Square club. 50 Cent, whose birth name is Curtis Jackson, had been a
friend of Jay and had been wounded in a shooting two years ago in
Queens. He also had been involved in a number of public scuffles with
other rappers, including Queens rap star Ja Rule.</TE>
<TE>   50 Cent has been a somewhat controversial figure in music industry
circles after a 1999 song in which he named rap celebrities and
boasted jokingly that he would victimize them in stickup robberies.
50 Cent was signed last summer to the record label run by rap
superstars Eminem and Dr. Dre.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, top rap stars were offering words of grief and
testimonies to the potency of the Run-DMC songbook. The more famous
two-thirds of Run-DMC are Joseph Simmons (he's the brother of Russell
Simmons, whose music empire found an early star in Run-DMC) and DMC,
whose real name is Darryl McDaniels. The group released the album
"Crown Royal" last year after an eight-year hiatus.</TE>
<TE>   The group built the bridge between hip-hop's home in the New York
club scene to its future on the nation's pop charts with thoughtful
lyrics often delivered with the spare, powerful punch of rock music
samples. Their recasting of "Walk This Way" in a collaboration with
Aerosmith was a watershed moment for rap's rise. Run-DMC was also the
first rap act to score a platinum album and to crack the Top 10 of
the U.S. album charts with its "Raising Hell" in 1986. Another rap
icon, Chuck D of Public Enemy, has often called Run-DMC the "Beatles
of rap."</TE>
<TE>   If Run-DMC's albums extended the reach of hip-hop, Jay's
contribution was as a legitimizing influence for the genre's
turntable heroes: The scratches and sonic shapes he crafted to back
the group's intelligent lyrics helped defend the idea that vinyl
could become an instrument of performance.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a great loss. Jam Master Jay was a pioneer, he led the
way for a whole new genre of talent," rapper and music executive Sean
"P. Diddy" Combs said in a statement. "Not only was he a great
artist, but he was a great man who will be deeply missed."</TE>
<TE>   He was also hailed Thursday by fans outside the scene of the
shooting who left candles, flowers and Adidas sneakers, a reference
to the group's hit. Memorial posters on a chain-link fence included
one saying, "Jay's Music Will Live On."</TE>
<TE>   One of the victim's three children, Jason Jr., told reporters at
the scene that the crime is confusing. "There's no reason," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, at leading hip-hop radio stations in Los Angeles and
New York, disc jockeys played Run-DMC's music all day amid tributes
to Jay. A popular selection was the 1984 Run-DMC song "Jam Master
Jay" with the lyrics: "And we got the master of a disco scratch /
There's not a break that he can't catch / Jam Master Jay that is his
name / And all wild DJs he will tame."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

prison after serving a three-year sentence, prison officials said.
Biscet, a doctor turned human rights activist, was let out of a
high-security prison in the eastern province of Holguin, prison
guards said. At a press conference before an international summit in
Havana three years ago, Biscet displayed a Cuban flag upside down to
criticize the lack of freedom in Cuba.</LD>

<LD>Two welders admitted accidentally starting an inferno in Ho Chi Minh
City that killed at least 61 people, police said. Phan Viet Thanh,
19, and Nguyen Phu Tin, 32, surrendered, and police were still
investigating whether a third welder was in hiding or had died in the
blaze.</LD>
<LD>   Thanh said the flame from a welding torch accidentally set fire to
plastic decoration sheets on the ceiling of a disco in the six-story
Saigon International Trade Center on Tuesday, an officer reported.
The welder told police that they tried to put out the fire and then
fled.</LD>

<HD>Russia Says Turkey, Qatar Aid Rebels</HD>
<DH>Officials, alleging the nations harbor Chechen fugitives,
also release recordings said to link Moscow hostage-takers with
separatist leader.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Daniszewski</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>MOSCOW -- Russia charged Thursday that Turkey and Qatar are giving
sanctuary to Chechen rebels, as officials released taped excerpts
that they said linked militants who took over a Moscow theater to
ousted Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov.</LD>
<LD>   Pressing a diplomatic offensive to brand Chechen separatists as
terrorists worldwide in the wake of the Oct. 23-26 theater takeover
that led to at least 119 deaths among the hostages, Russia already
has persuaded Denmark to detain a former Chechen deputy prime
minister close to Maskhadov on allegations of terrorist activity.</LD>
<LD>   Until recently, Maskhadov was the most likely negotiating partner
for Russia in any talks to end the three-year war in the separatist
Russian republic. President Vladimir V. Putin has virtually ruled out
negotiations.</LD>
<TE>   Putin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky used a news conference
Thursday to put the spotlight not only on Maskhadov but also on
Qatar, which he said is sheltering another top Chechen figure,
Zelimkhan Yanderbiyev, and on Turkey, which he said is allowing
Chechen rebel groups to openly raise funds.</TE>
<TE>   According to an excerpt of a taped phone conversation played at
the news conference, the leader of the hostage-takers, Movsar
Barayev, spoke to Yanderbiyev in Qatar. In the conversation, Barayev
said that "Aslan" knew about the plans to seize the theater. Only
three brief excerpts were played, however, and there was no way to
verify the government's interpretations, including that Barayev was
referring to Maskhadov.</TE>
<TE>   The Chechen detained Wednesday in Copenhagen, Ahmed Zakayev, was
in Denmark to attend a congress on Chechnya that had infuriated the
Kremlin. The Danish government agreed to hold him on an Interpol
warrant as Russia initiated a formal extradition request Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Interviewed by The Times last week before his arrest, Zakayev
denied any link to the hostage-takers: "Neither President Maskhadov
nor any of our official representatives are in any way connected," he
said at the time. Rather, he blamed Russian policy in Chechnya:
"Every day of war, every day of punitive measures leaves dozens of
lone avengers who cannot be controlled by Maskhadov or anyone else."</TE>
<TE>   At the news conference Thursday, an expert for the Federal
Security Service presented details of the bombs found in the theater,
which he said were powerful enough to have brought down the entire
building and to have killed all of the more than 750 hostages.</TE>
<TE>   Col. Vladimir Yeryomin said hostage-takers had explosives
equivalent to 250 pounds of TNT, including two large devices
containing an artillery shell within a metal container packed with
ball bearings; 25 devices of about 5 pounds each; and more than 100
grenades. If exploded, there would have been "absolute destruction,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   His evidence seemed aimed at bolstering Russia's position that it
had no choice but to storm the theater after first pumping in an
opiate-based anesthetic aerosol, fentanyl, that knocked out most of
the Chechen militants and the hostages.</TE>
<TE>   Although officials admit that the drug caused the deaths of 117 of
the 119 hostages killed, Moscow Mayor Yuri M. Luzhkov disputed a
suggestion that emergency personnel were not informed about the drug
in time or prepared to deal with its effects.</TE>
<TE>   "The physicians knew what to do," he insisted.</TE>
<TE>   One hundred eighty-four of the former hostages remained
hospitalized Thursday, eight in serious condition, health officials
said.</TE>

<HD>Iraq Counting On Trusted Troops, Party Loyalists</HD>
<DH>Regime says its people are ready to defend the nation, but
U.S. attack could alter dynamics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Slackman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>   If the United States attacks Iraq's capital, Abdel Hussein
knows what to do: Find and neutralize saboteurs who might slip into
Baghdad to plant bombs or spy for the enemy.</LD>
<LD>   Hussein, 52, is not in the army. He is a member of the ruling Arab
Baath Socialist Party, which has evolved into a state security
organization and one of Saddam Hussein's pillars of power.</LD>
<LD>   "They want to topple the regime. We are going to fight," said
Hussein, a 35-year member of the party. "It is not just a matter of
technology and missiles. It will be man to man."</LD>
<TE>   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is taking the threat from the
United States very seriously, and while he is waging an aggressive
diplomatic effort to try to prevent an invasion, he is also getting
his people ready for battle. Despite the president's confident
rhetoric about winning a war, a fundamental question hangs over the
regime: Whom can it really count on to fight?</TE>
<TE>   Without a doubt it can rely on citizens such as Abdel Hussein, who
would lose his privileged social status and financial benefits if the
regime falls -- and would risk retribution from angry Iraqis.</TE>
<TE>   And it can count on loyalist groups such as the Saddam Fedayeen, a
black-uniformed militia with many thousands of volunteers trained to
fight and operate antiaircraft artillery.</TE>
<TE>   But what about everyone else?</TE>
<TE>   As the Bush administration builds toward a possible armed
confrontation with Iraq, that is one of the principal questions on
the minds of military planners on both sides.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi regime says that every single one of 11.5 million
eligible voters cast ballots last month in support of the president.
It also says that every single family has a weapon and will use it to
defend the country.</TE>
<TE>   Yet many people here privately acknowledge that the regime faces a
threat not only from abroad but also from within.</TE>
<TE>   Like Washington, Baghdad is wondering whether the Shiite Muslims
who make up a majority of the population in a country ruled by Sunni
Muslims will rise up in rebellion.</TE>
<TE>   Will the army -- a poorly funded, poorly armed group of conscripts
-- fight, or will its soldiers flee?</TE>
<TE>   Will the general population, fatigued after more than two decades
of repressive rule, wars and U.N. sanctions, pick up weapons or stay
home and lock the doors?</TE>
<TE>   Most analysts and observers here agree that the regime is, at the
moment, fully in command of the nation's streets and that most people
would not greet U.S. invaders as liberators. But they say an invasion
could alter the equation -- either for or against the regime.</TE>
<TE>   If Americans lay siege to Baghdad and cripple the already frail
infrastructure, for example, people could rally around the
leadership. But if the public senses the regime is finished, many
people may well refuse to fight; such a perception could also
encourage anti-Saddam Hussein elements to rise up.</TE>
<TE>   After the 1991 Persian Gulf War, for instance, the Kurds in the
north and Shiites in the south led fierce uprisings that were
eventually crushed by forces loyal to Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "If the water pumps are hit, it can create a bad situation," said
Wamidh Nadhmi, a political science professor at Baghdad University.
Then "if Americans topple the regime, they might face a popular
uprising."</TE>
<TE>   In a society controlled by overlapping security agencies and the
fear that comes from arbitrary arrest and execution, there is no way
to accurately gauge public sentiment. Everyone here uses the overly
dramatic language of their president, insisting, for example, that
they will spill every last bit of blood in defense of their country.</TE>
<TE>   But there are signs that the regime does not fully believe its own
rhetoric.</TE>
<TE>   The authorities are concerned enough about losing control of the
street that they recently deployed soldiers and secret police to
disperse small crowds of men and women who gathered outside
government offices to ask for information about loved ones who have
disappeared in the prison system.</TE>
<TE>   The small, unprecedented demonstrations followed an effort by the
president to shore up the people's loyalty with dramatic gestures
such as doubling monthly food rations and granting a universal prison
amnesty.</TE>
<TE>   In this environment, the regime is turning to its most trusted
institutions to help maintain control.</TE>
<TE>   The army, with an estimated 300,000 to 400,000 troops, is not
expected to hold up well in the event of a war, with many of its
members either lying low or flat out refusing to fight, diplomats and
outside analysts say. In the 1991 war, Iraqi soldiers surrendered by
the thousands.</TE>
<TE>   More crucial to the regime is the Republican Guard and the Special
Republican Guard, two groupings with nearly 100,000 troops between
them. They are well trained, well funded and well armed. They are
preparing to help defend crucial areas, especially Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   After Iraq was forced out of Kuwait in the Gulf War, the
Republican Guard put down the Shiite and Kurdish rebellions. It did
so violently and, when it came to shooting unarmed civilians, without
hesitation.</TE>
<TE>   But central to maintaining order is the Baath Party. Its members
have already been armed with assault weapons, antiaircraft artillery
and small explosives, and they have been building up their numbers in
cities south of Baghdad, such as Basra and Karbala, sites of the
rebellions after the Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   Party members have detailed plans in the event of an attack. If
their headquarters are hit, for example, they have already identified
backup locations.</TE>
<TE>   They have also prepared safe houses with various supplies.</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1947 in Syria, the party was initially based on a
pan-Arab socialist ideology. But Iraq's version became the eyes and
ears of the regime, with an ideology that is at best ill defined.</TE>
<TE>   Although the regime says there are more than 1 million Baath Party
supporters, the number of full-fledged members is estimated to be
much fewer, about 30,000.</TE>
<TE>   From the beginning, the party was organized around the concept of
small groups working in each neighborhood, on each block, reporting
up in a pyramidal command structure that culminated with the
president.</TE>
<TE>   The structure created a perfect network for
controlling communities, street by street, with an army of informants
and a culture that rewarded spying on one's neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   After the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, with the military depleted, the
regime pushed the party into a security role, according to political
analysts here. That might help explain why the party and its members
became the focus of violent mobs after Iraq was forced out of Kuwait.</TE>
<TE>   When disgruntled Shiites from the armed forces led a rebellion
against Baghdad in the south, they took revenge for suppression under
the Baath Party.</TE>
<TE>   Rebels killed dozens of senior officials, including top party
members. Some were hanged. Others had their throats slit and bodies
burned. Homes of party members were ransacked.</TE>
<TE>   These are memories that Abdel Hussein no doubt carries with
him. He works with the Baath Party in Saddam City, the sprawling
ghetto just outside Baghdad that is home to a largely Shiite
population.</TE>
<TE>   As many as 2 million impoverished Shiites live in Saddam City, and
if there is a neighborhood in the Baghdad area that could explode, it
is that one.</TE>
<TE>   Every neighborhood in Iraq has a party headquarters, and the one
in Saddam City is more like a military fortress -- sitting behind a
wall with armed soldiers standing guard -- than a political office.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein says he has been assigned an area of about 160,000
citizens to keep tabs on.</TE>
<TE>   He strolls like a mob boss through the food market, where blankets
of flies cover the animal entrails tossed among the rows of fruit and
vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   Every party member, he says, has been assigned to a platoon with a
military mission. Some have antiaircraft weapons, which are stationed
all over the country, in neighborhoods, near orchards, along
roadsides.</TE>
<TE>   Some are assigned to try to shoot paratroopers out of the sky.
Some are supposed to provide food and supplies to the citizens. And
others are assigned to control the citizens in the event that they
rebel.</TE>
<TE>   "We are highly organized," Hussein said. "We can prevent them from
stepping on the soil of our country."</TE>
<TE>   One local observer says the Baathists are well trained and that,
with memories of the Gulf War aftermath when the dissenters rebelled,
the public can expect a very strong defense by the party.</TE>
<TE>   Working alone, and with the Saddam Fedayeen, the party will impose
a curfew in all major cities and, if necessary, will not hesitate to
open fire on unarmed civilians to restore order, observers here say.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Fedayeen have received about two months of military
training that includes swimming in sewage, jumping from helicopters
and crowd-control techniques.</TE>
<TE>   They are organized into divisions and will be dispersed throughout
Baghdad if there is a war.</TE>
<TE>   There are other groups the government can rely on as well, from
the tribes, which the regime has worked hard to win over by giving
them weapons and money, to special security forces, run by Saddam
Hussein's younger son, Qusai.</TE>
<TE>   Talk of Hussein going into exile is dismissed even by those who
whisper that they wish it would happen.</TE>
<TE>   "When he will be caught, he will be dead," a European diplomat
said. "I don't imagine this man leaving the country to live abroad.
With a gun in his hand, I think he will die in Iraq."</TE>

<HD>Muscovites Bid Farewell to a Bright Talent</HD>
<DH>Alexander Karpov survived the torment of Chechen rebels,
only to die of gas used in rescue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Dixon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>MOSCOW -- Alexander Karpov faced death twice in the last days before
he died, one of the hostages held by Chechen rebels at a Moscow
theater.</LD>
<LD>   Twice during the siege, Chechen gunmen led Karpov, 31, into a
corridor for execution. A gun was put to his back. He was told he
would be killed and he heard the gun fire.</LD>
<LD>   Both times, the gunman shot into the air, near his head.</LD>
<TE>   Karpov survived that cruelty, only to die of the sleeping gas used
in the rescue operation. Officials admit that 117 of the 119 hostages
who died were killed by the gas.</TE>
<TE>   Karpov had planned to take a large group of friends to see the
popular show "Nord-Ost" at the theater. But when he went to the
ticket booth, there weren't enough tickets for everyone.</TE>
<TE>   He later called his friends to say he had bought the last two
tickets for the Oct. 23 performance and apologized that he couldn't
take them along.</TE>
<TE>   He took only his wife, Svetlana, 29. She survived, and buried him
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds filed past his open coffin, piling the casket so high
with flowers that most of the blooms had to be taken away.</TE>
<TE>   Karpov, who had volunteered to act as a translator for the Chechen
terrorists, bore the brunt of their anger and frustration.</TE>
<TE>   His first ordeal during the siege came as the terrorists divided
the audience of more than 750 into men and women. Karpov and his wife
had to part.</TE>
<TE>   He reached for her and waved in a gesture of love, which angered
some of the terrorists, who perhaps mistook it for a signal.</TE>
<TE>   He was immediately taken out and subjected to his first
"execution."</TE>
<TE>   Karpov, who spoke excellent English, acted as a translator for the
Chechens when they spoke to foreign hostages and when they made
certain calls, possibly to foreign diplomats.</TE>
<TE>   His wife told family members she believed that the second faked
execution was an attempt to frighten him because of information he
had gained through the calls.</TE>
<TE>   After the initial separation, she was able to sit with him again.
She was with him when the gas flowed into the auditorium, just before
Russian commandos stormed the theater.</TE>
<TE>   When Svetlana Karpov smelled the gas, she tore her T-shirt in two
and covered her mouth and face, giving him the other half.</TE>
<TE>   But he refused it.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to have a clear head to the end," he told her. It was a
decision that may have cost him his life.</TE>
<TE>   The gas snuffed out an extraordinary talent. Karpov had translated
the musical "Chicago" into Russian. He had a Celtic band and wrote
songs and poems. He so loved Irish music that he recorded a CD, "Road
to Dublin," and called himself O'Karpov.</TE>
<TE>   "Author, singer, writer of humorous stories, poet, bard,
translator," began the testimonial placard posted at his funeral.</TE>
<TE>   A Celtic ensemble played Irish dirges at the ceremony as Karpov's
widow sat near his coffin, heaving with sobs.</TE>
<TE>   Oleg Gorodetsky, a friend, described Karpov as "a brilliantly
talented person. He could speak in verse. He was a master at
inventing tongue twisters and rhymes. He was one of the people who
could actually invent jokes."</TE>
<TE>   At 5 a.m. Friday during the siege, Karpov called Gorodetsky and
asked him to organize a rally to end the Chechen war.</TE>
<TE>   "He said: 'We're alive. We're sitting on a mine. Get people out to
a rally,' " Gorodetsky said.</TE>
<TE>   At about the same time, Karpov called his mother to make the same
request.</TE>
<TE>   "He rang at 5 in the morning," said his father, Sergei. "At that
point, he was at gunpoint. They made him say all the things about
rallies. The fighters told him to organize the rallies.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the only time he called."</TE>
<TE>   Igor Bely, 31, a musician who played music with Karpov, said his
friend was always the heart and soul of the party.</TE>
<TE>   "He loved life. He had the unique talent of seeing the bright
side, even in the most ugly and disgusting things," he said. "He
could infect other people with that feeling too."</TE>
<TE>   After the siege ended, authorities provided so little information
that relatives had to comb dozens of hospitals and morgues to find
their loved ones.</TE>
<TE>   Bely helped coordinate about 200 friends in a search of hospitals
and, later, morgues. Bely used his Web site to keep friends and loved
ones updated.</TE>
<TE>   Grigory Maltsev, 43, found Karpov's body in a morgue Sunday
afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "When I saw him lying there, I thought, 'It's not him.' I just
didn't want to believe this hard fact that I had found him and he was
dead," Maltsev said.</TE>
<TE>   Russian pop star Philip Kirkorov, who is starring in "Chicago,"
arrived in a gold stretch Mercedes limousine to pay tribute to Karpov
at his funeral. As he walked into the room where the coffin lay, a
woman shouted at him to remove his hat.</TE>
<TE>   As dusk fell in Nikolo-Arkhangelskoye cemetery on the outskirts of
Moscow, white petals were scattered on the ground like early snow.
The only sound was the weeping of Svetlana.</TE>
<TE>   "I blame the terrorists and the war in Chechnya," said Sergei
Karpov.</TE>
<TE>   It was dark by the time Karpov was buried. A circle of spades dug
deep into the loamy soil, which rained upon his coffin.</TE>
<TE>   The moment recalled another funeral for a young man named Sultan
Zalayev, eight years ago, in Chechnya, in the opening days of the
1994-96 Chechen war. In 1996 the Russians withdrew; in 1999 they
invaded again.</TE>
<TE>   Zalayev, 24, was one of the first casualties of that war. A
similar ring of spades bit into the soft soil to bury him.</TE>
<TE>   One of the mourners said that a forest of gravestones would grow
in Chechnya because of the war. But he warned that a forest of
gravestones would grow in Russia too.</TE>

<HD>Sharon Picks Hard-Line Defense Chief</HD>
<DH>Choice of Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz may signal a move to the far
right by the Israeli government.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Prime Minister Ariel Sharon on Thursday picked as his new defense
minister a former army chief of staff who takes an even harder line
toward the Palestinians than does the Israeli leader.</LD>
<LD>   Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, whose selection as defense chief is expected
to be officially announced next week, caused a stir last spring when
he was caught on an open TV microphone urging Sharon to expel
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat.</LD>
<LD>   As chief of staff, Mofaz presided over Israel's seizing of West
Bank cities and towns in response to a string of suicide bombings and
other attacks launched from the Palestinian territories by militant
groups.</LD>
<TE>   As Sharon moved Thursday to replace ministers from the
left-leaning Labor Party who abandoned his governing coalition a day
earlier, a thunderous explosion rocked a crowded neighborhood in Gaza
City, killing at least three members of the military wing of the
militant group Hamas, one of them a senior figure in the
organization.</TE>
<TE>   Six people were reported wounded, four of them civilians and the
other two members of Hamas. The blast was apparently a "work
accident" -- the term used by both sides to describe explosives going
off prematurely while being assembled or transported.</TE>
<TE>   The choice of Mofaz as defense minister could be an early signal
of what analysts have predicted will be a pronounced move to the
right by Sharon's government in the absence of Labor's moderating
influence.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon is expected to turn to far-right and religious parties,
most of which oppose any peace overtures toward the Palestinians, to
regain a majority in the 120-seat Knesset, or parliament.</TE>
<TE>   Mofaz, whose term as chief of staff ended in July, is so unpopular
among Palestinians that his effigy is sometimes burned at rallies in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, along with that of Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli newspapers reported Thursday that Mofaz had cut short a
trip to London because a lawyer representing a group of Palestinians
has filed a complaint against him in Britain, accusing him of war
crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Israel has consistently defended its tactics during the more than
2-year-old Palestinian uprising, saying measures such as
assassinations of militant leaders and large-scale army incursions
into Palestinian cities are the only way to halt terrorist attacks on
Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians expressed misgivings Thursday about the selection of
Mofaz, saying it would lead to an intensification of violence.
Arafat, interviewed on the Qatar-based satellite channel Al Jazeera,
denounced Mofaz and his successor as chief of staff, Moshe Yaalon,
together with the prime minister.</TE>
<TE>   "Mofaz on one side, Yaalon on the other and Sharon above them --
what do you imagine will happen in the region?" Arafat asked.</TE>
<TE>   Mofaz has said publicly that he considers Arafat an architect of
terror. In urging the expulsion of the Palestinian leader during
fierce fighting by the two sides last spring, he advocated a course
rejected by other senior Israeli officials as too extreme and too
politically difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "We should kick him out," Mofaz told Sharon in April as the two
waited for a television interview to begin, unaware that the
microphone was live.</TE>
<TE>   "I know, I know," Sharon replied. Mofaz pressed him: "This is a
chance we won't get again."</TE>
<TE>   The appointment, along with Sharon's other Cabinet nominees, will
require the approval of the governing coalition and the Knesset.
Those votes are expected next week.</TE>
<TE>   Weakened by the departure of Labor, the prime minister will have
to start fending off parliamentary challenges almost immediately. The
left-leaning Meretz Party said it would press a no-confidence motion
Monday, although the move was given little chance of succeeding. It
also said it would challenge Mofaz's appointment.</TE>
<TE>   The collapse of Sharon's broad-based alliance with the Labor Party
reinvigorated debate about politics Israeli style, in which
short-lived governing coalitions are the norm.</TE>
<TE>   Former Prime Minister Ehud Barak, whose coalition managed to stay
afloat for less than two years, suggested that it might be time to
rethink the country's system of government.</TE>
<TE>   "We are witnessing a gradual deterioration of the patterns of
political behavior in this country," he told Israel Radio.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason for this is that on every issue that is crucial to the
nation, special-interest groups have the power to create pinpointed
pressure and bring the government down.... I think this ability to
topple governments easily works against our long-term interests."</TE>
<TE>   Among the four Cabinet posts vacated by Labor is the foreign
minister's job, which was held by Shimon Peres.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday evening, Israel's Channel Two quoted sources in
Sharon's conservative Likud Party as saying that one of the
candidates under consideration for the job is former Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, Sharon's longtime rival.</TE>
<TE>   Bringing Netanyahu into the government would help neutralize him
as a potential leadership challenger.</TE>

<HD>Russians Now Fault N. Korea on Nuclear Talk</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>In a sharp change of course, Russia on Thursday accused North Korea
of being insufficiently forthcoming about its alleged nuclear weapons
program, the Interfax news agency reported.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. said last month that North Korean officials admitted
having a nuclear weapons program. A U.S. official then went to Russia
to present Moscow with evidence of the alleged uranium-enrichment
effort.</LD>
<LD>   Moscow reacted with caution, saying it would like to independently
check the information before drawing any conclusions.</LD>
<TE>   Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Losyukov said that
Moscow had received an explanation from the North Koreans but that it
was insufficient, Interfax reported.</TE>
<TE>   "There is some ambiguity in the statements by North Korean
representatives," Losyukov was quoted as saying. "In our view, such
ambiguity is very dangerous because it leads to mutual suspicions."</TE>

<HD>Suicide Attacks Are 'War Crimes'</HD>
<DH>U.S.-based rights group says Palestinians who order and
send bombers should face justice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilkinson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>A leading human rights organization charged today that Palestinians
who order and dispatch suicide bombers, including senior leaders, are
guilty of war crimes and should be brought to justice.</LD>
<LD>   In a comprehensive, 170-page report, the New York-based Human
Rights Watch also says that Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat bears "significant political responsibility" for the "repeated
deliberate killing" of Israeli civilians in the last two years of
blood-soaked conflict.</LD>
<LD>   "The scale and systematic nature of these attacks in 2001 and 2002
meet the definition of a crime against humanity," the report states.
"When these suicide bombings take place in the context of violence
that amounts to armed conflict, they are also war crimes."</LD>
<TE>   The report is a departure from most human rights investigations
into Israeli-Palestinian violence that focus on the Israeli army,
including the killing of civilians, demolition of houses and other
forms of collective punishment.</TE>
<TE>   Israel is a member state of the United Nations and signatory to a
number of international conventions and as such can be held
accountable for its army's actions.</TE>
<TE>   Human Rights Watch asserts that although Arafat's Palestinian
Authority is not a state, it has aspirations to become one, has made
international commitments and therefore cannot evade similar
responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the scathing report says, Arafat and the Palestinian
leadership have failed to prevent suicide bombings, refused to arrest
terrorists and declined to defuse the radicalized political and
social climate that encourages attacks targeting Israeli civilians.</TE>
<TE>   Blaming Israel's harsh occupation of Palestinian territory, the
leadership has, to the contrary, allowed justification for the
attacks to flourish, the report charges.</TE>
<TE>   The report focuses on the history and activities of four factions
that have claimed responsibility for 52 suicide bombings since
January 2001 in which an estimated 250 civilians have been killed and
an additional 2,000 people injured.</TE>
<TE>   In all, about 2,200 people have been killed, about three-quarters
of them Palestinians, since the intifada, or uprising, erupted 25
months ago.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the factions cited by Human Rights Watch -- the militant
Islamic movement Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the secular
but radical Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine -- have an
adversarial relationship with Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   But the fourth, the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, professes loyalty to
the aging leader while operating with a great deal of local
discretion, the report says.</TE>
<TE>   Hamas founder Sheik Ahmed Yassin is among the senior leaders who
could be investigated on war crimes charges, said the report's
author, Joe Stork, director in Washington of Human Rights Watch's
Middle East and North Africa division.</TE>
<TE>   Hamas and Islamic Jihad defend and celebrate the use of suicide
bombers, boast of the method's efficacy and make no distinction
between Israeli civilians and combatants, according to the report --
all of which supports an allegation of crimes against humanity.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat, however, has little command responsibility over the
bombings carried out by the Al Aqsa brigade, the report concludes,
and consequently does not bear criminal liability. Yet he is
responsible nevertheless, Stork charged.</TE>
<TE>   "The greatest failure of President Arafat and the PA [Palestinian
Authority] leadership -- a failure for which they must bear heavy
responsibility -- is their unwillingness to deploy the criminal
justice system decisively to stop the suicide bombings, particularly
in 2001, when the PA was most capable of doing so," the report said.</TE>
<TE>   "The lack of command responsibility in no way diminishes Arafat's
and the PA's significant political responsibility for the repeated
deliberate killing of civilians."</TE>
<TE>   There was no immediate comment from Palestinian Authority
officials.</TE>

<HD>Quake Kills 20 Children in Italy</HD>
<DH>Others remain trapped after the roof of a village school
collapses. Two women die in their homes in the magnitude 5.4 temblor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Holley and Maria De Cristofaro</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>ROME</DL>
<LD>ROME -- An earthquake knocked down the roof of a school in southern
Italy on Thursday, killing at least 20 children and trapping dozens
of others during a party to celebrate Halloween.</LD>
<LD>   Two women also were killed in their homes in San Giuliano di
Puglia, a medieval village of 1,195, about 50 miles northeast of
Naples. The magnitude 5.4 quake struck at 11:33 a.m. The epicenter
was reported to be in the nearby city of Campobasso.</LD>
<LD>   About 50 people were initially trapped when part of the roof over
the nursery and elementary school collapsed, authorities said.
Rescuers said after nightfall that they could talk with two groups of
buried children, who had ducked under benches for protection.</LD>
<TE>   Some of them were later rescued, including six dust-covered
children pulled out under floodlights and quickly sent to hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   Onlookers applauded and called out, "Giovanni! Giovanni!" when one
little boy was brought out on a stretcher.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as he came out he called me 'Papi' like he always does,"
Giovanni's father told state television, which didn't further
identify the man. "I immediately saw he was in good condition. He
told me there are many other children still alive, a little shocked
but still alive, so the hope is still there that they can save more.
I thank God for this gift he has given me."</TE>
<TE>   Halloween has recently become popular in Italy, and some of the
frightened relatives at the school had painted faces for the
festivities. Children in costume also stood watching.</TE>
<TE>   "We had organized those celebrations to exorcise the fear of the
spirits. Instead, this morning, the terror came from the earth," one
of the injured teachers, Luigina Vaccaro, said after being
hospitalized. "There were indescribable moments when it seemed as
though the earth met the sky."</TE>
<TE>   The school, built in 1953, was near the village's historic center.
Children up to the age of 14 attended the party, according to reports
from the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Many homes in the area were also reported damaged, with collapsed
roofs, cracked walls or large chunks of plaster torn from ceilings.
Stones from walls fell onto sidewalks and cars. At least 3,000 people
in the region had to be evacuated.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi went to the scene to monitor
rescue efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the day and the night, workers scrambled over the
rubble of the school, moving boulder-size slabs of broken concrete to
search for survivors. Parents screamed out the names of their
children from behind police lines. Some firefighters and residents
dug through the rubble with their bare hands.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the buried responded weakly to shouts from rescuers. About
40 people, including at least seven children, were admitted to the
nearby Larino hospital, according to health service official Vincenzo
D'Angelo.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people are in a heavy state of shock, and the majority have
only light injuries, mostly on their legs and arms," he said. "Only
four or five people have some serious injuries like broken legs and
arms or a concussion."</TE>
<TE>   An unidentified mother, her daughter still trapped, told Italian
state television that there had been a predawn foreshock.</TE>
<TE>   After the main earthquake struck, she started to rush to the
school, the woman said. "On my way ... I ran into our local priest,
Don Ulisse, who asked what had happened," she said. "I told him about
the children in the school and he said that he had told the town hall
this morning not to send the children to school because of the
temblor we felt this morning around 3 o'clock. Why did they send them
to school?"</TE>
<TE>   A woman with a medical drip in her arm being carried out of the
school was also shown on Italian television. She started to cry when
another woman embraced her. Other images showed a man carrying a
child in his arms, and many women and old men crying.</TE>
<TE>   A boy about 12 years old said: "They just pulled out my sister
from the rubble. I think she is OK."</TE>
<TE>   "Today was my free day," said a middle-aged teacher. "It's just by
chance that I am not underneath there."</TE>
<TE>   The shaking was felt across central and southern Italy and even in
high-rise apartments in Croatia, across the Adriatic Sea. It was the
strongest earthquake to hit Italy since 1997, when a magnitude 5.6
quake killed 11 people in north-central areas. In 1980, nearly 2,600
people died and 30,000 were left homeless when a magnitude 6.8
earthquake hit southern Italy.</TE>
<TE>   The active Sicilian volcano, Mt. Etna, which began erupting again
Sunday, was the site of a magnitude 3.7 earthquake Thursday, with no
immediate reports of damage. The two quakes appeared to be unrelated,
seismologists said.</TE>
<TE>   "The two epicenters are very far away from each other, and the
nature of the quakes are different," said Alessandro Amato of the
National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology in Rome. "The Etna
quake is caused by its volcanic activity, the magma underneath the
volcano, which is certainly not the case with the Campobasso quake."</TE>

<HD>Soldiers Sought in S. African Blasts</HD>
<DH>White police officers are also suspected in the nation's
worst bombing spree since apartheid.</DH>

<DL>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa</DL>
<LD>South Africa is hunting for white right-wing soldiers and police
after the most serious bombing spree since racist apartheid rule
ended in 1994, the defense minister said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Nine bombs exploded Wednesday in the sprawling black township of
Soweto near Johannesburg, killing a woman and raising fears that
white extremists are at work. A 10th explosion near Pretoria wounded
two others.</LD>
<LD>   Defense Minister Mosiuoa Lekota said a minority of right-wing
white Afrikaners in the armed forces and police could be part of a
plot to plunge South Africa into a race war.</LD>
<TE>   "They are a racially oriented group. They want to achieve a race
war," Lekota said.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly does not represent the majority of Afrikaners ... ,"
he added, "but a residue within the South African National Defense
Force and the South African Police Service."</TE>
<TE>   Members of President Thabo Mbeki's black-led government and
opposition figures said the bombers aimed to upset a fragile racial
balance and bring back the violent past.</TE>
<TE>   "It's people who are enemies of this country, who don't like the
level of tranquillity, the peace that we have achieved together,
black and white, after a difficult history," Justice Minister Penuell
Maduna said on SABC state radio.</TE>
<TE>   "There is indeed an organization, with cars and transport and
money."</TE>
<TE>   Nobody has been arrested or claimed responsibility for the
bombings, the worst since a blitz by white right-wingers ahead of
all-race elections in 1994 that swept black anti-apartheid leader
Nelson Mandela to power.</TE>

<HD>Stalled Dreams in Turkey's Southeast</HD>
<DH>Many Kurds in the region earned a living hauling goods to
Iraq and bringing back diesel. A ban on such deals has brought
economic hardships.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeffrey Fleishman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NUSAYBIN, Turkey</DL>
<LD>Above a stream, past chickens and geese and a muddy cow, sits a poor
man's failed dream.</LD>
<LD>   The truck shone once. But now the 20-ton Ford rusts on the
roadside with a flat tire, a busted headlight and a faded pair of
leopard skin seat covers. Its owner, Ramazan Kaplan, sits near the
truck, clearing his throat and waiting to unfold the story of his
life's biggest gamble.</LD>
<LD>   Kaplan spends his time these days mostly talking; his wife grinds
meal and stares for hours across the fields. Kaplan keeps his
second-most prized possession close to him: a silver tobacco case. He
pulls it from his pocket, wanting to call attention to it, but not
wanting to appear so. When the young village men come, he rolls them
all a cigarette.</LD>
<TE>   They've heard his words many times, but even repeated tales are
welcome diversions on the vast plains skirting the Iraqi border. He
is still trying to figure out how he got tangled in and then crushed
by the complicated -- he would say sinister -- events of geopolitics.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone was making money," he said. "We all thought this was our
chance.</TE>
<TE>   "I sold the house of my sons to buy this truck," Kaplan said. "I
paid $5,000 for it. It was everything we had. This truck was going to
make our lives better. Things are worse. I owe taxes, but if the tax
man ever comes, he can have the truck. It ruined us."</TE>
<TE>   His is one of tens of thousands of trucks abandoned or sold for
scrap in southeastern Turkey. Such losses have devastated the economy
for the region's majority population of 13 million Kurds. Throughout
the late 1990s, legions of trucks hauled food and clothes into Iraq
and returned with diesel bought from Turkey's nemesis, the Iraqi
Kurds, who collected hundreds of millions of dollars in marked-up
prices and truck taxes.</TE>
<TE>   The Turks tolerated this because one Iraqi Kurd leader, Massoud
Barzani, quietly helped the Turkish military in its campaign against
Turkey's own Kurdish rebels in the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK.</TE>
<TE>   A 15-year war between Turkey and the separatists claimed an
estimated 37,000 lives and displaced 500,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, however, Barzani lost his cachet with Turkey when PKK
leader Abdullah Ocalan was arrested and the rebels called a
cease-fire.</TE>
<TE>   Fearful that a continued oil trade would give Iraq's 3.5 million
Kurds the resources to form an independent state and destabilize the
region, Turkey curtailed the diesel deals, officially stopping them
Sept. 1.</TE>
<TE>   The government of Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit announced that the
smuggling was costing the Turkish economy millions of dollars a
month. Turkey now ships in only crude oil supplied by Saddam
Hussein's regime under the United Nations "oil-for-food" program.</TE>
<TE>   The squeeze on cross-border traffic forced 90% of southeastern
Turkey's 51,000 registered trucks off the fabled Silk Road. Most are
not equipped to haul crude oil. Their departure costs the southeast's
economy about $60 million a month. More than 100,000 jobs
disappeared, and Kurds again turned bitter against the Turkish
government, which has stifled freedom of expression and other rights
for its largest minority.</TE>
<TE>   "The Turks just want to keep us hungry," said Kaplan, the
patriarch in a family of 15. "They never want to see a Kurd get
ahead. They want to break us down so much that if they'd come and ask
for our wives, we'd turn them over."</TE>
<TE>   This landscape is haunted by truck graveyards.</TE>
<TE>   Rusted metal and chipped paint spoil the vista of brown mountains
tapering into cotton and wheat fields. Broken chassis are silhouetted
in the dusk as old men gather their goats and women, laden with
vegetable sacks and toddlers, trundle past the minarets and
bullet-pocked houses of a tormented land. The Muslim call to prayer
warbles through scavenged truck cabs; wild dogs sleep on hoods.</TE>
<TE>   The restaurants, and then the gas stations, closed.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no trucks anymore," said Mehmet Sirin, a lonely
attendant with weeds growing around his gas pumps. "Business is down
80%. Some drivers are picking cotton, others have gone to west Turkey
to look for work. I'm bored."</TE>
<TE>   "You have to figure," said Bedrettin Karaboga, president of the
Southeast Industrialists and Businessmen's Assn., "that each truck
had a family of seven or eight relying on it. That means hundreds of
thousands of people are suffering. I had to cut my employees from 850
to 300. It's tiring to live like this. We are like Africa."</TE>
<TE>   The truck stop near Nezirhan is still open.</TE>
<TE>   No one inside is happy, though. Faces weathered, hands knotted and
nicked, the truckers hunch over kebabs and bean soup, comparing miles
with profits and getting depressed. Before the border restrictions,
truckers would drop off a load of onions or flour in Iraq and return
with a load of diesel that was bought just across the border. Most
drivers cleared $200 for a 15-day trip, a small fortune in a region
that pays its cotton pickers $2.50 for a 12-hour shift.</TE>
<TE>   The few truckers equipped to haul crude oil say their profits have
fallen to $35 for a 1,250-mile round trip stretching from the Iraqi
border to the Mediterranean Sea.</TE>
<TE>   "Three partners and I sold our sheep and goats and our land to buy
this truck," said Ahmet Dilek, brushing dust off his greasy sweater.
"We thought we'd make good money. But we're all surviving on the
fieldworkers and goat herders in our families. I've been on the road
five months. I don't have enough money to return home with."</TE>
<TE>   "How can you go home with no money in your pocket?" said his
buddy, Zeki Perisan. "I have eight children. One of them is a
shepherd, another works construction in Istanbul. He sends money
home."</TE>
<TE>   Someone asks about the talk of another war in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is one, we're finished," Perisan said.</TE>
<TE>   "True," Dilek said.</TE>
<TE>   "Turkey doesn't want Kurds here to make a profit," said Ahmet
Cetin, who had been eavesdropping on the conversation. "They think
the money we make we give to the PKK rebels.</TE>
<TE>   "They think we're all potential terrorists. I sold my village land
and bought a truck. I paid $4,000 for it, and the other day a guy
comes up to me and says, 'I'll give you $500 for it so I can crush it
for scrap metal.' "</TE>
<TE>   Delik and Perisan decided that it was time to leave.</TE>
<TE>   They climbed into their cabs, their trucks creeping across the
gravel parking lot to the highway.</TE>
<TE>   They drove past the home of Barzan Orgel, where four trucks with
dead engines and unpaid tax bills in the glove boxes sat at the edge
of a cotton field. Orgel is used to political intrigue at the Iraqi
border. He and his three brothers were doing fine in the 1980s. Then
the 1991 Persian Gulf War sealed the border and knocked them out of
the trucking business. They sold two trucks for scrap.</TE>
<TE>   Orgel figures that's what will happen to the four in his yard.</TE>
<TE>   "We're used to struggle," he said. "We survived, and we'll survive
again. If the border opens back up, I'll go buy some more trucks.
What else can we do?"</TE>

<HD>U.N. Haggling Over Iraq All but Ended, U.S. Says</HD>
<DH>Officials express confidence that Security Council will
pass the American version of a resolution on action against Baghdad.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maggie Farley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>UNITED NATIONS -- Preparing for the endgame on how to confront Iraq,
the U.S. claimed Thursday that it has won two key swing votes on the
Security Council -- Ireland and Mauritius -- giving it the necessary
majority to pass its resolution.</LD>
<LD>   "We're done," a U.S. official said. "We are confident that we have
a majority, and we are looking to end the diplomatic process next
week."</LD>
<LD>   U.S. officials say they will present a new resolution next week
incorporating council members' suggestions and that they hope to have
a vote by the week after next at the latest. But they made clear that
the U.S. will reserve the right to take unilateral action against
Iraq even without fresh Security Council approval.</LD>
<TE>   "Our bottom line has not changed," State Department spokesman
Richard Boucher said Thursday. "We think it's time to resolve these
differences and it's time to pass a resolution."</TE>
<TE>   The announcement is meant to put further pressure on France, the
United States' most vocal challenger in the council on the Iraq
issue.</TE>
<TE>   France so far has enjoyed the support of most of the council's 15
members for its two-stage plan on disarming Iraq, which proposes that
the council pass a resolution strengthening the weapons inspections
regime but requiring that it would have to meet again to decide on
action if Iraq is found to be in "material breach" of U.N.
resolutions.</TE>
<TE>   This week, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and his French and
Russian counterparts have been in constant contact, sending phrases
from the resolution back and forth to try and reach a compromise.
France and Russia have tentatively agreed to include the words
"material breach" as long as the phrase does not explicitly authorize
automatic use of force. They insist on further wording that
guarantees that the Security Council, not the U.S. alone, decides if
an attack is warranted.</TE>
<TE>   But although the two sides are only a few words away from
agreement, they are still a world apart, observers say.</TE>
<TE>   "The difference is knowing whether the gun you are pointing is
loaded or not," a council diplomat said. "When the difference is war
and peace, you want to know if there is a hidden trigger."</TE>
<TE>   In weeks of negotiations, both sides say they have made many
concessions. The first text the U.S. floated was so tough, many
diplomats said it was "designed to fail." The latest U.S. version has
dropped demands for the use of "all necessary means" against Iraq,
among other concessions. The French, in turn, have given up their
demand for a second resolution authorizing the use of force against
Iraq, settling instead for a less formal Security Council decision.</TE>
<TE>   The latest U.S. concessions appear to be close enough for Irish
diplomats, although they wouldn't say for sure whether they have
signed on to the U.S. side after weeks of waiting.</TE>
<TE>   "There's only a phrase or two separating each side -- although
small words involve big issues," said Ireland's deputy ambassador,
Gerard Corr. Ireland has said it wanted the U.S. to return to the
Security Council for approval before taking military action. "The
text as it now looks substantially addresses our concerns."</TE>
<TE>   The ambassador from Mauritius, Jagdish Koonjul, has been playing
it cool at the council, publicly remaining undecided and elevating
attention to his tiny nation as a sought-after swing vote.</TE>
<TE>   But at home, his diplomatic equivocation made headlines after the
Mauritian Council of Ministers decided to definitively back the U.S.
position. A foreign aid agreement with the U.S. stipulates that
Mauritius does not "engage in activities that undermine the United
States national security or foreign policy interests."</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. official said Washington counts Mauritius squarely in its
camp. "They've come fully aboard," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For a resolution to pass, it needs nine votes from the full
council and no vetoes from the five permanent members -- the U.S.,
Britain, China, France and Russia. The latest U.S. count includes
Britain, Norway, Bulgaria, Cameroon, Colombia, Ireland, Mauritius and
probably Singapore and Guinea on its side, and leaves France, China,
Russia, and Syria firmly on the other side. Mexico says it remains in
the middle, although the U.S. has said it is confident of winning its
vote.</TE>
<TE>   France and Russia are no longer hinting at using a veto to block
the U.S. resolution. But if they can sway enough of the council
members to abstain from a vote, it would send a clear signal of
council division.</TE>

<HD>No Thaw in German-U.S. Ties</HD>
<DH>Top official says his nation has not decided whether to
allow use of its bases for war on Iraq.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Richter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Chilled by a frigid reception from the Bush
administration during a visit here, German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer said Thursday that his nation hasn't decided yet whether U.S.
forces will be allowed to use bases in Germany if the United States
launches a war against Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   It would be almost unthinkable for such an important NATO ally to
deny the United States access to bases that have played a key role in
U.S. military action in the Middle East over the past decades. But
Fischer's comments underscored how little progress has been made
toward repairing relations ruptured after German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder made statements during his reelection campaign opposing a
war with Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   In a breakfast with reporters, Fischer stressed his hopes for an
improvement in relations. But when asked about use of the U.S. bases,
he noted that Germany has said it would "play no role" in military
action, adding that the question is at this point a "theoretical one"
that must be "discussed and decided when we reach the situation."</LD>
<TE>   Fischer's visit, the first by a high-level official since German
elections in September, was expected to be a fence-mending session.
But although Secretary of State Colin L. Powell was supportive after
the two men met Wednesday, the White House delivered a highly public
rebuff by refusing Fischer's request for a meeting with top-level
presidential aides.</TE>
<TE>   And as Fischer left Thursday, administration officials said they
wanted to send a message that the United States will not sit still if
foreign leaders seek to build political support by turning to the
kind of anti-Americanism that they believe Schroeder displayed during
the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   If the administration doesn't resist when "the biggest boy in
Europe runs against America, there will be a snowball of
anti-Americanism that will gain speed and size as it rolls down the
hill," one State Department official said.</TE>
<TE>   The official accused Fischer of conducting a publicity blitz
during his visit here aimed at showing that Schroeder's campaign
statements were based on principle and "concealing the personal
nastiness of the [election] campaign." The official added that
President Bush remains angry and may decline to meet with Schroeder
during a NATO meeting in Prague, the Czech capital, this month.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder's successful reelection campaign got a boost from his
declaration that Germany should not take part in a war against Iraq,
a war he considers unnecessary. But his comments enraged the Bush
administration, especially after reports emerged that Schroeder's
former justice minister, Herta Daeubler-Gmelin, had told a crowd that
Bush was like Hitler in trying to distract his public from economic
problems with a foreign war. She subsequently denied making that
statement.</TE>
<TE>   In response, Bush refused to make the usual congratulatory phone
call to Schroeder when he was reelected. German officials have not
softened their insistence that they will play no part in a war
against Iraq. Fischer, before leaving Berlin, told reporters that the
trip to Washington was "no pilgrimage of repentance."</TE>
<TE>   Of the 123,000 U.S. troops in the European theater, 71,400 are
stationed in Germany. U.S. forces fly troops and equipment in and out
of the Middle East through Germany and send troops wounded overseas
to hospitals there. Many analysts believe that if an attack on Iraq
does take place, the United States will ferry thousands of Army
troops stationed in Germany to the region, just as it did during the
Persian Gulf War more than a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department official said he doubts that, in the end, the
Germans would withhold use of the bases.</TE>
<TE>   While they have a tradition of declining to comment on military
action, "when the time comes, they fall in line" with other nations,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Several analysts said that because Schroeder campaigned against
joining a U.S.-led war, Fischer couldn't say that the Germans would
allow use of the bases without damaging the government's credibility.</TE>
<TE>   And if Bush receives United Nations support for a campaign against
Iraq, Germany would be unlikely to forbid use of the bases, they
said.</TE>
<TE>   If the U.N. Security Council approves such a military move,
Germany will be under tremendous pressure from the U.N., NATO and the
European Union to join in some collective action. Germany will become
a member of the Security Council in January, which will increase
pressure for it to join in U.N. action.</TE>
<TE>   But if the United States does not win U.N. support for a war and
instead mounts a unilateral campaign against Baghdad, there may be
tremendous pressure within Germany not to grant permission to use
bases, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's the U.S. against the world, the government would have a
hard time allowing that," said Daniel S. Hamilton, a former State
Department official who is director of the Center for Transatlantic
Relations at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced
International Studies in Washington. At the same time, he said he
thought that unilateral action was "not a realistic option" for the
United States, and therefore that the chances were small that the
Germans would refuse use of the bases.</TE>
<TE>   Ivo H. Daalder, a National Security Council official in the
Clinton administration, said he believes Bush administration
officials have gone too far in freezing out Germany.</TE>
<TE>   "The time for childish games is over," said Daalder, now a
Brookings Institution scholar. "If they're worried about a snowball
of anti-Americanism, they better be careful they don't create one
themselves."</TE>

<HD>Doubts Grow on Bush's Resolve for Business Reform</HD>
<DH>Reported secrecy by SEC Chairman Pitt about his choice to
lead an accounting board is the latest in a series of missteps.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter G. Gosselin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The administration's latest misstep in handling America's corporate
crisis has convinced many people on both sides of the political
divide that President Bush does not take the business scandals of the
last year all that seriously.</LD>
<LD>   Revelations that Bush's Securities and Exchange Commission
chairman, Harvey L. Pitt, failed to disclose crucial information
about his top nominee for a new accounting oversight board -- even to
fellow commissioners -- is the latest in a series of fumbles,
misstatements and false starts by the administration on the corporate
scandal issue.</LD>
<LD>   Since the start of the year, the president and key aides have
suggested there is a danger of going too far in curbing accounting
gimmicks and excessive corporate compensation, and they appear to
have embraced legislative and regulatory changes only after new
disclosures of malfeasance have forced their hand.</LD>
<TE>   "The administration has not stepped up to the plate," said William
A. Niskanen, chairman of the libertarian Cato Institute in
Washington. "They've never made it clear what they themselves
wanted."</TE>
<TE>   "The president doesn't seem to see the seriousness of the problems
that almost every business leader of both parties sees," said Jay
Lorsch, a corporate-governance expert at Harvard Business School.</TE>
<TE>   Neither the president nor Republican candidates are likely to pay
a political price for the problem in next week's congressional
elections. Polls show that only a tiny fraction of voters rank
corporate reform as a big issue.</TE>
<TE>   But at least one Washington veteran said the scandals and the
administration's uncertain handling of them could spell trouble for
Bush in the next few years.</TE>
<TE>   "This issue has the potential to become a much bigger political
headache for Republicans in general and this administration in
particular," said Norman J. Ornstein of the generally conservative
American Enterprise Institute in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   More immediately, the administration's fumble in creating the
accounting board threatens to tarnish Washington's most high-profile
attempt to restore investor confidence and bolster financial markets
by imposing stiff rules on corporate auditors, directors and
executives.</TE>
<TE>   The board was created by Congress in July to police accountants
after revelations they had blessed financial statements that wildly
inflated the profits of companies such as Enron Corp., WorldCom Inc.,
Global Crossing Ltd. and Tyco International Ltd. It is one of the
mainstays of the only major piece of legislation to emerge from the
debacle.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt has been embroiled in almost continuous controversy since
arriving in Washington. As a lawyer, he represented accounting
industry lobbyists and top accounting firms such as Arthur Andersen,
which was implicated in the Enron debacle, and has been accused of
giving his former clients special access to him as SEC chairman.</TE>
<TE>   The latest blowup occurred Thursday, when it was revealed that
Pitt's choice to lead the new accounting board, former FBI and CIA
Director William H. Webster, told the SEC chairman he had recently
headed the audit committee of a company accused of defrauding
investors. Webster also reportedly said that as audit committee
chairman, he had agreed to the removal of the firm's auditors after
the auditors said they uncovered serious accounting problems.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt, whose raison d'etre as SEC chairman is to ensure full
disclosure by publicly held companies, failed to disclose to fellow
SEC commissioners what Webster had told him before the panel voted 3
to 2 on Oct. 25 to approve Webster's appointment.</TE>
<TE>   The new blowup comes atop an earlier one that Pitt sparked when he
appeared to endorse former retirement fund manager John H. Biggs for
the accounting board's chairmanship, then -- apparently under
accounting industry and White House pressure -- backed away from the
tough-minded Biggs in favor of Webster.</TE>
<TE>   A White House spokeswoman, Clare Buchan, asserted Thursday that
Bush has been at the forefront of corporate reform efforts. But the
president's position on key reform issues has been cloudy and
uncertain at critical moments.</TE>
<TE>   He spent much of the year, for example, suggesting he wanted some
of the most stringent elements of the reform bill advanced by Sen.
Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) removed or toned down. As late as a July 9
speech on Wall Street, he refused to back the bill, and only did so
after telecom giant WorldCom filed for bankruptcy protection later
that month.</TE>
<TE>   Bush unleashed a torrent of populist rhetoric during his Wall
Street speech and called for a doubling of maximum sentences for
corporate misdeeds.</TE>
<TE>   But he had taken much of the sting out of his remarks in an
interview the day before, when, asked about his own conduct as an
executive of Harken Energy Corp. in the early 1990s, he said, "In the
corporate world, sometimes things aren't exactly black and white."</TE>
<TE>   Hedging like this could prove politically dangerous for an
administration with more than its share of former executives and
lawyers from several of the most controversial companies.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Pitt, there is Vice President Dick Cheney, who faces a
lawsuit alleging that he and Halliburton Co. defrauded investors
through aggressive accounting when Cheney was chief executive of the
Texas oil services and construction firm.</TE>
<TE>   There is Army Secretary Thomas E. White, who as vice chairman of
Enron Energy Services was at the center of California's power crisis
in 2000-01. And there is Bush economic advisor Lawrence B. Lindsey,
who was an advisor to Enron before joining the administration.</TE>
<TE>   "Up to this point, the corporate scandals have been the
administration's Achilles' heel," Harvard's Lorsch said. "They just
don't get it."</TE>

<HD>Caught in a Jobless Free Fall</HD>
<DH>The U.S. economy is recovering, but job growth is not. Even
highly skilled workers wonder if there's life after unemployment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter G. Gosselin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>When his position at a mid-size bank was eliminated during the
economic doldrums of the early 1990s, Richard Coss Jr. reacted by
striking out on his own as a consultant.</LD>
<LD>   Even with a knack for numbers and a Duke University MBA, it still
took him more than a year to land a regular job with Pittsburgh
banking giant PNC Financial Services Group Inc. He ultimately was
named an $80,000-a-year vice president.</LD>
<LD>   But no sooner did the economy slip back into recession early last
year than Coss was out again. And this time, the consulting has been
harder to come by. Eighteen months after he was laid off, Coss, his
wife, Janet, and their three children get by on $450 a week in
unemployment from Pennsylvania and gifts from his retired parents.</LD>
<TE>   "Sometimes I get down on my knees and pray because I don't know
where this is going," said the 48-year-old Coss.</TE>
<TE>   Through technological breakthroughs, seamless global connections
and advances in management techniques, the American economy seems to
have gotten away from the boom-bust business cycles of old.
Recessions are shorter and expansions longer.</TE>
<TE>   But these positive developments, a growing number of economists
believe, have come with a troubling cost: lengthier, more
debilitating spells of unemployment for many of those who do lose
their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be that people entered and left the labor force fairly
easily," said University of Chicago economist Robert H. Topel. Now,
he said, in a remark about low-skilled workers that seems equally
applicable to many higher-skilled ones, "leaving the labor force is
like death: You go and you never come back again."</TE>
<TE>   When the trend emerged in the early 1990s, it quickly was dubbed
the "jobless recovery" and subjected to intense scrutiny. Did
employers' reluctance to add to their payrolls mean that they no
longer were willing to provide the amount -- and quality -- of work
they once did? Did the brutal demands of global competition spell an
end to good jobs at good pay in America?</TE>
<TE>   Then along came the boom of the late 1990s -- with its spiraling
stock prices and tumbling unemployment rates -- and all worry of a
jobless recovery seemed to vanish.</TE>
<TE>   But the problem did not go away. As the economy moved through its
latest recession and now finds itself in a weak recovery, many of the
patterns of the early '90s are reasserting themselves, distinguishing
the two recent periods from every other recession and recovery of the
last half-century.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not your parents' business cycle," said Goldman, Sachs &amp;
Co. economist Ed McKelvey. "The economy is on a very different path
than a generation ago."</TE>
<TE>   Just ask Coss' father, Richard Sr., a retired union machinist who
had been forced to go part time when work slowed down but never
suffered a layoff in his nearly four-decade career. Watching his son
go through a long bout of unemployment has been hard on the elder
Coss.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really know what's going on in the working world as far
as jobs go," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It's no wonder. Until the last decade, American employers leaped
at the chance to rehire the minute a recession was over. Government
statistics from the late 1940s through the late 1980s show that in
the first year of a recovery, U.S. payrolls typically grew by a
quarter of a percentage point -- in today's terms, more than 300,000
jobs -- a month.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, companies greeted the end of the early-1990s
recession by cutting, rather than adding, several hundred thousand
workers in the first year. Since January, when the most recent
recession is thought to have ended and the economy began growing
again, payrolls have slipped by 17,000.</TE>
<TE>   In addition -- and perhaps least noticed of the recent changes --
the average length of time that people who lose their jobs are out of
work has been creeping steadily upward.</TE>
<TE>   For much of the post-World War II era, average time out as
measured at the peak of expansions was eight weeks, according to
Labor Department statistics. But by the start of the early-1990s
recession, it had reached 12 weeks, and it never fell below that
level even during the most fevered moments of the subsequent boom.</TE>
<TE>   During the 2001 recession, the figure hovered around 13.5 weeks.
And in September, eight months after the presumed end of the
recession, it stood at 17.8 weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts have suggested that the increase is the product of
changed behavior by certain subsets of the work force. Women, for
instance, tended to give up trying to find jobs when they were laid
off; as a result, they weren't included in calculations of the
average length of unemployment spells. Now that they are full-fledged
participants in the labor market, they keep looking when they lose
jobs, and so they push the average up.</TE>
<TE>   But beyond such specific patterns lies a fundamental shift in the
nature of work and unemployment: Pushed by competition and freed from
the restraints that a strong union movement used to impose, companies
are much more likely than they were a generation ago to respond to
economic trouble by eliminating jobs permanently.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, American workers, who once could be confident that a
layoff meant little more than an interlude between jobs, can no
longer be so sure. That is especially true for unskilled blue-collar
workers but increasingly true for college-educated managers.</TE>
<TE>   "If you lose your job today, you're likely to be out longer than
in past decades," said Robert G. Valletta, a senior economist with
the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco who has studied the issue.
"If you are a white-collar, managerial worker, the increase is likely
to be particularly pronounced."</TE>
<TE>   The growing length of unemployment suggests a different -- and
decidedly darker -- picture of the economy from the conventional one.
In the conventional view, the overall economy has demonstrated its
remarkable resilience by continuing to expand despite terror attacks
and a stock market slump. The unemployment rate, now at 5.6%, remains
relatively low. (The government's jobless report for October is
scheduled to be issued today.)But some are beginning to doubt whether
analysts are zeroing in on the right factors.</TE>
<TE>   "We have spent a great deal of time focused on how low the
unemployment rate got and stayed, without focusing on how long those
who are unemployed are out," said former Bureau of Labor Statistics
Commissioner Katharine G. Abraham. In doing so, she believes, "we may
have overstated the strength of the U.S. economy."</TE>
<TE>   In and of itself, lower unemployment has widely been considered
one of the great accomplishments of the economy in recent years. But
the ever-lengthening duration of unemployment poses a dicey problem
for working people, scrambling the odds that they face in trying to
achieve some measure of financial security and affluence.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're in effect doing is offering people a devil's deal,"
explained MIT economist Paul Osterman. "We're saying, 'We'll reduce
the chance of your becoming unemployed, but if you're one of the
unlucky ones who loses their job, then the consequences will be very
serious.' "</TE>
<TE>   In that wager, Richard Coss Jr. has definitely come up short.</TE>
<TE>   The only person more surprised than Coss is his father. The
difference in the two men's work lives is a measure of the chasm that
divides the old business cycle from the new -- the old social
contract between employer and employed from the current one.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess it must be pretty hard right now," said 72-year-old
Richard Sr.</TE>
<TE>   The father went to work out of high school as a grinder at Landis
Machine Co. in Waynesboro, Pa. He made only two moves in his career.
One was to join his parents and a brother in buying a Laundromat to
run as a side business. The other was to leave Landis for better pay
at the Mack Truck plant.</TE>
<TE>   He worked at Mack for 26 years on the same grinders he had
operated at Landis. There were slack periods but -- thanks to the
power of the United Auto Workers -- no layoffs. In his top year, he
made about $40,000.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't have a big life," said his wife, Iolene, a school
secretary. "But I can't remember where we were ever really hard up."</TE>
<TE>   The younger Coss was the eldest of the couple's three sons. He was
good in math, interested in the Civil War and fascinated by politics.
As a grade-schooler in Maryland, he would "know the governor of
California," his mother marveled.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, the parents did not know much about their son's
ambitions. But they knew one thing: He and his brothers were going to
college. The father's explanation comes straight from the playbook
for the American dream: "I hoped they'd get better-paying jobs and
live a better life than I had."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, higher education has delivered on half the promise for
the younger Coss and his generation of white-collar workers:
Government statistics show that they make on average 125% more than
their high-school-educated parents and contemporaries.</TE>
<TE>   But the calculus has gotten considerably more complicated when it
comes to the question of better, more secure lives.</TE>
<TE>   In Coss' case, the combination of an MBA and the choice of a
career in banking appears to have delivered the very opposite of
security; it has thrown him into virtually every financial maelstrom
of the last two decades.</TE>
<TE>   His first job out of Duke was with Pittsburgh-based Mellon
Financial Corp. But he was laid off in 1987 when the bank suffered
losses in the Texas oil-patch fiasco. He helped start a consulting
business for Bryn Mawr Trust Co. in 1990. But he was forced out two
years later when the bank eliminated that business in coping with
real estate loan losses during the early-1990s recession.</TE>
<TE>   In his eight years at PNC, Coss rose to become the "product
profitability" director of the bank's business loan unit, responsible
for deciding which services were moneymakers and which were losers.
But his job was cut in March of last year, the month the latest
recession began, when the bank launched a new -- and thus far
disastrous -- strategy of forsaking traditional lending in favor of
fee services such as back-office processing, which tanked with the
economy.</TE>
<TE>   "Timing is everything in this life, and PNC couldn't have gotten
it worse," said Gerard Cassidy, a bank analyst with RBC Capital
Markets.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, when Mack Truck ran into trouble in the late 1980s,
Coss' father took early retirement with union-provided pension and
health benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly hasn't been what I expected," the younger Coss said
of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Nor has it been for much of the rest of white-collar America. In
the early 1990s, and even more strikingly over the last two years,
college-educated professionals and managers -- who once were
essentially immune to economic dislocation -- have borne much of the
brunt of the downturn.</TE>
<TE>   Since the start of the year, the number of unemployed unskilled
blue-collar workers has fallen by 181,000, or 10%, while the number
of unemployed white-collar managers and professionals has risen by
129,000, or 10%.</TE>
<TE>   Some commentators contend that the comparatively even distribution
of job losses among income and education groups in the last two
recessions represents a sort of democratization of economic pain and
therefore is beneficial. But it also means that what has long been
considered the most powerful method for wage earners at all levels to
improve their economic lot -- getting a better education -- is no
longer a sure thing.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question that more education mean higher earnings,"
said Jared Bernstein, an economist with the Economic Policy
Institute, a generally liberal Washington think tank. "But what the
last two business cycles show is that white-collar, college-educated
workers are vulnerable to unemployment, and protracted spells of
unemployment, in ways they once weren't.</TE>
<TE>   "Their education no longer inoculates them from trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Like many white-collar workers, Coss left PNC with six months of
severance pay and a fistful of job leads. But he has since discovered
that he is surprisingly vulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   As the severance money has run out, he has been forced to depend
on an unemployment compensation system designed for a bygone
industrial age and factory workers such as his father. Though the
system is intended to replace about half a jobless worker's wages, in
his case it is replacing only a fifth. Though it was set up to handle
short stints of joblessness, his time out of work is proving anything
but.</TE>
<TE>   As most of his leads for permanent employment dry up, Coss has
been forced to rely on lucrative but temporary consulting gigs. He
made $25,000 in 10 weeks with his old employer Mellon last fall. But
such assignments are sporadic at best.</TE>
<TE>   Coss said the prospect of more such work is a key reason he hasn't
taken a job at Wal-Mart or behind the counter of a local dry cleaner.
Still, when further assignments have fallen through, he has had to
dig into savings and rely on gifts. The elder Cosses recently gave
the family a 1991 Chevrolet sedan to help extend the life of its two
cars.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Coss' unemployment -- and his decision not to take a
low-level job -- is causing quiet consternation on the part of his
parents.</TE>
<TE>   His mother worries for her son.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a good person. He's an intelligent person," Iolene Coss
said. "He needs something to show his intelligence and that he's a
good provider, and to keep up his self-esteem."</TE>
<TE>   His father edges toward criticism. "If I'd have gotten laid off,"
he said, "I don't think I could have stood being out the way he has.
I'd have gone out and gotten something."</TE>
<TE>   Yet the elder Coss acknowledges that he has never said as much to
his son or even spoken much about the younger Coss' predicament of
being well-educated and out of work for so long. "What do you say?"
the father asks. " 'Well, did you get anything?' "</TE>
<TE>   The answer, as he very well knows, is: Not yet.</TE>

<HD>Heat Builds for SEC Chief</HD>
<DH>Harvey Pitt faces new demands that he quit after reportedly
failing to disclose potentially damaging information about a key
appointee.</DH>

<LD>Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt faced a
new torrent of calls for his resignation Thursday after reports that
he did not disclose potentially inflammatory information about the
man he picked to head the nation's new accounting-oversight board.</LD>
<LD>   William H. Webster, chosen last week to head the panel, chaired
the audit committee of a financially troubled company that last year
fired its outside accounting firm and has been sued by shareholders
for fraud.</LD>
<LD>   Webster told Pitt about the troubles at U.S. Technologies Inc. in
advance of the commission's decision Oct. 25 to appoint Webster, the
New York Times reported Thursday. But Pitt didn't inform other
commission members before the contentious 3-2 vote, and the White
House said it also wasn't told.</LD>
<TE>   The revelations immediately sparked a firestorm of outrage among
Democratic legislators, many of whom have been critical of Pitt since
he was appointed the top securities cop a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   At least one Senate Republican also said the Webster affair
"raises questions" about Pitt's conduct.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt has repeatedly found himself embroiled in controversy over
his behavior and his ties to the securities and accounting
industries, which he served as a lawyer in private practice before
President Bush tapped him to lead the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC responded to the latest controversy Thursday by asking its
inspector general to review the process by which Webster was
selected.</TE>
<TE>   An SEC spokesperson said that Pitt made the call, but that all
five commissioners wanted the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), who spearheaded the law creating
the new accounting-oversight board, asked the General Accounting
Office to launch a separate investigation.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is whether Pitt, as the head of the agency that demands
full disclosure from U.S. companies, intentionally withheld critical
information from the other commissioners.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Pitt is not behaving in a trustworthy manner that will bring
credibility back to the market and restore investor confidence," said
House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.). "I again urge
President Bush to ask Harvey Pitt to step aside from his post today."</TE>
<TE>   A Pitt spokesperson said the staff of the SEC's accounting
division reviewed Webster's tenure on U.S. Technologies' audit
committee but found that he had done nothing wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Webster, 78, is a former federal judge who directed the FBI from
1978 to 1987 and the CIA from 1987 to 1991.</TE>
<TE>   "The staff, in reviewing his service on the audit committee,
identified nothing of concern so there was nothing to pass on," the
Pitt spokesperson said.</TE>
<TE>   Webster, who was named to the U.S. Technologies board in April
2000, did not return phone calls Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Technologies is a small Washington-based firm with stakes in
a number of Internet-related companies. The company, which says it
also operates industrial facilities in prisons, has recorded little
in revenue and has racked up millions of dollars in losses, including
a $1.8-million deficit in the first quarter of this year.</TE>
<TE>   Its stock trades for less than 1 cent a share.</TE>
<TE>   The firm and its chief executive, C. Gregory Earls, face lawsuits
from investors who said they were defrauded. A complaint filed
against Earls in Superior Court in Washington accuses him of using
investors' funds for his own purposes, according to Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Thursday, Earls defended the company, saying there
was "no impropriety or wrongdoing" and that the lawsuits were without
merit. He refused to discuss details of the allegations in the
lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Earls defended Webster's role on the audit committee, saying
"Judge Webster did a very good job for us. He was diligent. He was
hands-on."</TE>
<TE>   The audit committee, under Webster, fired BDO Seidman as U.S.
Technologies' accountants in August 2001. A month earlier, the
auditors had raised issues about the company's internal financial
controls.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to the SEC last year, BDO Seidman said it told the
company's audit committee of what the accountants considered "a
material weakness in internal control ... including lack of an
experienced chief financial officer, deficiencies in recording
material transactions timely, and in the organization and retention
of financial documents and accounting records."</TE>
<TE>   Earls said BDO Seidman was replaced because it took too long to
audit the firm's books and because U.S. Technologies could no longer
afford its fee.</TE>
<TE>   A BDO Seidman spokesman refused to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The Webster episode marks the latest in a series of political
missteps and controversial actions by Pitt.</TE>
<TE>   A former securities lawyer who once represented the accounting
profession and its top firms, Pitt caused an uproar this year when he
held private meetings with accounting executives. That raised
concerns that he was giving preferential treatment to former clients
as they were coming under scrutiny in a wave of accounting scandals.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, Pitt endured withering criticism for his handling
of nominations to the accounting board.</TE>
<TE>   The creation of the five-member panel was the centerpiece of a
landmark accounting-reform bill signed by Bush in July. The board is
charged with annually reviewing large audit firms and disciplining
accountants for wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Lax oversight of accountants was blamed as a central factor behind
the downfall of companies including Enron Corp. and WorldCom Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC was bitterly divided on Webster's selection, with the
three Republican members, including Pitt, backing him while the two
Democrats favored John H. Biggs, a New York pension-fund executive
known as an aggressive reformer.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt initially offered the chairmanship to Biggs, sources said,
but reversed course when the accounting industry and some
congressional Republicans wanted a more moderate choice.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear what effect the revelations would have on Webster's
planned stewardship of the board, which by law must be in operation
by the end of April. The White House said it continued to back
Webster.</TE>
<TE>   But some experts said Webster's affiliation with U.S. Technologies
raised concerns about his judgment.</TE>
<TE>   To lead the accounting panel, Webster must spot financial warning
signs, an ability he did not exhibit at U.S. Technologies, critics
said. "If this new board is going to have any credibility with the
public, William Webster cannot be its chairman," said Lynn Turner, a
former SEC chief accountant.</TE>
<TE>   The disclosure, coming just five days before the midterm elections
to decide control of Congress, gave Democrats fresh ammunition in
their efforts to force Pitt's ouster. But it remained to be seen
whether the latest crisis will prove politically fatal to him.</TE>
<TE>   The White House repeated its backing of the SEC chairman.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, of course we support him [Pitt]," White House spokesman
Scott McClellan told reporters as Bush traveled to South Bend, Ind.,
for a campaign event. But McClellan added: "We don't know the facts."</TE>
<TE>   And at least one Republican on the key Senate Banking Committee,
Sen. Mike Enzi from Wyoming, said he was troubled by the belated
disclosure about Webster's previous corporate service.</TE>
<TE>   "I have supported and will continue to support full disclosure
when it comes to appointments of any kind," Enzi, the only senator
who is an accountant by training, said in a prepared statement.</TE>
<TE>   "This lack of transparency raises questions in my mind that should
be addressed by the White House."</TE>
<TE>   Sarbanes, who sponsored the accounting reform bill as chairman of
the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, said he was
"deeply concerned that this process has gotten so markedly off
track."</TE>
<TE>   But Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, the Senate Banking Committee's top
Republican, defended Pitt.</TE>
<TE>   "We have had the most relentless partisan attack on Pitt," Gramm
said, "I guess because the Democrats are desperate to try to make
corporate malfeasance a campaign issue in Tuesday's elections."</TE>
<TE>   He said Webster's service on the board of U.S. Technologies was a
matter of public record that Pitt couldn't have hidden if he had
tried.</TE>

<HD>Occidental Trustees Told Gift Tied to L.A. School Board Bid</HD>
<DH>But Eli Broad aide says timing of $10-million offer and his
push of campus president to run against David Tokofsky was a
coincidence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Y. Hong and Solomon Moore</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles billionaire Eli Broad offered to donate $10 million to
Occidental College while seeking to persuade the school's president
to run against L.A. school board trustee David Tokofsky, The Times
has learned.</LD>
<LD>   College President Theodore R. Mitchell confirmed in an interview
late Thursday that he had been in discussions over the past week with
Broad and former L.A. Mayor Richard Riordan about seeking the seat on
the seven-member board of the Los Angeles Unified School District but
decided against running in the spring election.</LD>
<LD>   Mitchell told college trustees Wednesday that Broad would give the
money to the Eagle Rock institution if he would declare his
candidacy, according to participants in that discussion.</LD>
<TE>   Mitchell asked trustees for their approval to remain campus
president if he won the seat, said the participants who requested not
to be identified, but trustees disapproved of the idea.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell said he would not divulge what he discussed with the
Occidental trustees. The former UCLA vice chancellor and Getty Trust
executive said he had talked with Broad about helping to finance an
education leadership institute at Occidental, but added that it was
unrelated to his potential candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   Broad's spokeswoman, Melissa Bonney Ratcliff, said that Broad had
been considering a gift to Occidental at the same time he was
encouraging Mitchell to run for Tokofsky's seat but that the timing
was coincidental and was not linked to Mitchell's candidacy. Ratcliff
said Broad was not available for comment Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell said he was impatient with the pace of reform in L.A.
Unified, the nation's second-largest school district. But after
talking with several people about Tokofsky's re-election chances and
about his own odds, Mitchell said, he decided not to run.</TE>
<TE>   "What I discovered was that David has broad and deep community
support," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell, a former education advisor to Riordan, told about a
dozen college trustees in a special meeting on the issue how Broad
and Riordan asked him to run and how Broad offered the college the
donation, according to sources at the gathering. Mitchell, in New
York, spoke to the trustees, who assembled at the college, by speaker
phone.</TE>
<TE>   When asking the board for permission to run, Mitchell told the
trustees he was not initially interested but was persuaded to run by
Broad's offer to donate $10 million to the 1,600-student liberal arts
college, according to sources who attended. The donation would have
been used to fund a leadership institute for public school principals
and vice principals, said participants, and was to be given over five
years, in $2 million increments.</TE>
<TE>   Several board members told Mitchell, who became president in 1999,
not to accept the request to run for the board, and by the end of the
meeting Mitchell agreed, participants said.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, a close friend of Broad, denied that he asked Mitchell to
join the school board race but said that he would have been an
enthusiastic backer. "I wasn't the one that went to him or was
involved in any decision," the former mayor said. "It did not come
from me, but when he made a decision to look at it, I thought it was
a good idea."</TE>
<TE>   At one point in the interview Thursday with The Times, Riordan
said he had "an idea about who asked [Mitchell], but I don't want to
reveal any confidences."</TE>
<TE>   For several years Riordan has sought to influence the composition
of the school board. With financial help from Broad, he backed four
successful candidates -- including Tokofsky -- in the 1999 board
elections. But Tokofsky, the only incumbent on the mayor's slate, was
not Riordan's first choice. Riordan initially recruited a candidate
to oppose the incumbent, but endorsed Tokofsky after that person
dropped out.</TE>
<TE>   Even without Tokofsky fully aboard, the Riordan-backed candidates
changed the course of the district, leading to the dismissal of
then-Supt. Ruben Zacarias and the decision, now being reconsidered,
to scrap the Belmont Learning Complex over environmental problems.</TE>
<TE>   Tokofsky called the courting of Mitchell "another Byzantine turn
in the treacherous school district." The board member said
Assemblyman Marco Firebaugh (D-Los Angeles) told him Wednesday that
Mitchell had been considering a run for his seat. Tokofsky then
called Mitchell, who was in New York on a business trip.</TE>
<TE>   "Ted, what's going on here?" Tokofsky recalled asking. He said
Mitchell acknowledged that he had planned a run for the seat, but
said he changed his mind. Tokofsky also said Mitchell apologized.</TE>
<TE>   The board member said he was concerned about Broad possibly
influencing the upcoming election. "I've seen enough races to know
that a million here and a million there can make for a rough board
race," Tokofsky said, "and your record can't always find its way
through that much money."</TE>
<TE>   He said he confronted Broad on Thursday at the California Club.
Broad told him that he had nothing to worry about because Mitchell
had decided not to run, Tokofsky said, and that they would talk at
another time.</TE>
<TE>   Ratcliff, Broad's spokeswoman, said Thursday that Broad and
Mitchell are longtime friends who talk frequently.</TE>
<TE>   She said the discussions about the leadership institute were
preliminary and were not linked to Mitchell's possible candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   Ratcliff said she did not know details of how Broad approached
Mitchell. She also said she did not know if Broad was looking for
other candidates for the board or if he would make any donation to
Occidental.</TE>
<TE>   . During his 1999 reelection campaign, the independent-minded
Tokofsky received only a small share of the more than $2 million that
Riordan's political committee, the Coalition for Kids, raised from
wealthy donors, including Broad. Although Riordan never openly
renounced his support for Tokofsky, others on the Riordan team were
often exasperated with the trustee's maverick streak.</TE>
<TE>   "He certainly doesn't call me before he makes any votes," Riordan
said Thursday, adding that he will continue to look for school board
candidates to back.</TE>
<TE>   The Riordan revolution sputtered in 2001 when two of the three
candidates supported by the lame-duck mayor lost in the primary.
Tokofsky's majority-Latino district stretches from the northeast San
Fernando Valley to Boyle Heights.</TE>
<TE>   He was previously a social studies teacher at Marshall High School
and led its Academic Decathlon team to a national victory. Tokofsky,
who is Jewish, has battled some Latino politicians who asserted that
the district should be represented by a Latino.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell said the Latino majority in the district also influenced
his decision not to run. "It is a heavily Latino district, and it's
unclear whether it's appropriate or even viable for an Anglo to
represent the 5th District, and that is something David is struggling
with," said Mitchell.</TE>
<TE>   He added that, unlike Tokofsky, he is not a fluent Spanish
speaker. "I can read Cervantes in Spanish," he said, "but I'd be lost
in a bar."</TE>

<HD>Davis, Simon Hustle Votes 5 Days Ahead of Election</HD>
<DH>Candidates try to drum up support amid prospects for a
record low turnout on Tuesday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Matea Gold and Gregg Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With a spare five days to go, the focus of the governor's race turned
Thursday to the gritty work of getting out the vote, as the campaigns
of Gray Davis and Bill Simon Jr. launched their final push to propel
supporters to the polls.</LD>
<LD>   The governor dropped by Democratic field offices in Compton and
Long Beach, where he urged people to turn out Tuesday, and even
called a few voters himself.</LD>
<LD>   Republican Simon campaigned in Santa Monica with former
congressman and GOP veteran Jack Kemp and then moved on to his
Pacific Palisades headquarters, where he and his wife tried to whip
up enthusiasm among campaign volunteers.</LD>
<TE>   While the candidates were supplying the rhetoric, the manpower was
being deployed by a host of organizations, both allied and separate
from the campaigns, all working to benefit the governor's race and a
variety of other contests and issues that voters will decide on
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The traditional pushing and prodding of voters in the final hours
before election day -- known as GOTV, for get out the vote -- is
taking on even greater importance this year, with turnout expected to
sink to near-record lows.</TE>
<TE>   Although a Times poll published Tuesday showed Davis with a solid
lead over Simon, backers of both candidates say the lack of
enthusiasm for either man could keep voters at home and change the
dynamics of the election.</TE>
<TE>   "There is still a chance the race could be close, if people don't
see the value of turning out," said Art Pulaski, head of the
California Labor Federation, which directs one of the largest GOTV
efforts in the state.</TE>
<TE>   David Roth, who is directing the Simon campaign in Solano County,
added: "This whole election will be about turnout."</TE>
<TE>   California voters can expect to be barraged with GOTV appeals
right up until election day. More than a million Republicans will be
getting taped phone messages from President Bush. An even greater
number of Democrats will get recorded calls from former President
Clinton. Thousands of glossy campaign mailers are flooding into
mailboxes.</TE>
<TE>   And on Tuesday, many residents will receive a knock on the door
and an offer of a ride to their polling place.</TE>
<TE>   Davis told supporters Thursday in Long Beach that "polls don't
vote; people vote."</TE>
<TE>   The governor asked the crowd of 150 -- most of them union members
and students -- gathered in the campaign field office to volunteer a
few hours of their time before election day, offering in exchange to
pose for a photo with them.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone says no one is going to vote, and we have to prove them
wrong," the governor said.</TE>
<TE>   Up the coast, Simon and his wife, Cindy, visited his campaign
office in Pacific Palisades. "What we need to be sure to do from this
moment on, really, all of us here ... is get out the vote," Cindy
Simon told two dozen supporters and friends.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be such a close election," she said. "I mean, it's
going to be this close. It's like Indiana basketball -- right down to
the wire."</TE>
<TE>   Faced with an electorate uninspired by the two men at the top of
the major party tickets, GOTV organizers have been forced to come up
with other reasons for voters to turn out. Democrats warn supporters
of the potential return of a Republican governor, like Davis'
predecessor Pete Wilson, and cite Florida's tight 2000 election,
which decided the presidential race. Republicans, meanwhile, appeal
to frustration with the current governor.</TE>
<TE>   Bolstered by labor union support, Democrats have traditionally
enjoyed an advantage in getting out the vote in California. The
United Farm Workers is targeting 125,000 families with occasional or
newly registered voters in three heavily Latino areas: the Coachella
Valley, Salinas and the southern San Joaquin Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning this weekend, the UFW -- ostensibly nonpartisan,
although the union has strong Democratic Party ties -- will commit
1,300 activists working 12-hour shifts to motivate registered voters
to cast their ballots, said union spokesman Marc Grosman.</TE>
<TE>   The California Labor Federation -- which represents about 2
million people -- is using traditional tactics such as phone banks
and precinct-walking to reach voters. But the federation has also
emphasized what it calls work-site programs, in which shop stewards
talk to union members during breaks about where the candidates stand
on issues such as overtime pay and paid family leave.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people are starting to believe that Simon has shot
himself in the foot enough times that there's not an urgency to the
moment," the federation's Pulaski said. " ... We have to remind
people what elections are about."</TE>
<TE>   The state Democratic Party has its own coordinated $5-million GOTV
effort for its slate, and the Davis campaign is spending an
additional $4 million on mailers and phone banks. The thrust of their
attention is voters who don't usually go to the polls.</TE>
<TE>   "In a low-turnout situation, it's going to be the performance of
these occasional voters that counts," said Larry Grisolano, Davis'
campaign director.</TE>
<TE>   In East Los Angeles -- at one of 22 Democrat-coordinated campaign
offices around the state -- field organizers have made those voters
their highest priority. Precincts with few regular voters are marked
in red on a wall map to indicate their importance. Those voters were
contacted in September and have been contacted again many times
since. The message: Democrats are better on health care and
education.</TE>
<TE>   "If someone says, 'We're not excited about Davis,' we say, 'Well,
Bill Simon is not going to be where you are on those issues,' " said
field director Celine Cordero, 26. Behind her, a red sign declared:
"Every Vote Counts -- Florida Never Again."</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday night, she and several other young field organizers
directed high school students working the phones, lobbying voters in
Spanish and English.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not going to be any excuse not to vote," said organizer
Cameron Calderon, 19.</TE>
<TE>   While Democrats are using techniques refined by years of GOTV
campaigns, Republicans -- who historically have relied more on
advertising than fieldwork -- are now trying to match those efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be a lie to say they haven't beaten us on the ground in
the past, but we've identified that fact and we're working on it,"
said Nathan Fletcher, political director for the California
Republican Party.</TE>
<TE>   "We've contributed significant resources, and we're getting
better," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans won't reveal how much they're spending, but Fletcher
said that, for the first time, the party began planning its GOTV
efforts for a race a year and a half before the election.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican National Committee sent a team to California after
the 2000 presidential election to give the state party intensive
training in getting out the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the party has set up a statewide infrastructure with
phone banks and precinct walkers in almost every county, Fletcher
said.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP also launched an aggressive absentee ballot campaign and
is trying to contact likely voters nine times before election day.</TE>
<TE>   "It's putting the emphasis back on the personal connection,"
Fletcher said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the GOP ground troops is Marisa Olguin, whose battlefield
this week was the neat stucco homes along La Forge Street in
Whittier.</TE>
<TE>   Olguin ducked under Halloween decorations as she made her pitch to

<TE>   "It's our only hope," said the 32-year-old, who is volunteering 10
hours a week in an effort to reach GOP voters in a heavily Democratic
district.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Olguin knocked on doors until the afternoon light
was almost gone.</TE>
<TE>   The former public relations executive didn't have much trouble
finding people enthusiastic about voting for the local Republican
candidate for Assembly, Whittier Mayor Dave Butler.</TE>
<TE>   But when they were asked about the gubernatorial hopeful, their
commitment faded.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you support Bill Simon?" Olguin inquired of Jenny Ellis, 34,
as Ellis' young daughters peered out through the front door. "Um,
yeah," Ellis replied. "I guess."</TE>
<TE>   Down the block, Olguin got another answer she didn't want to hear.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm about ready to vote for the Green Party on that one," said
Linda Self, 56. "I don't like what I'm hearing about the Republican
candidate, and I definitely don't like the Democrat. So I'm not sure
what I'm going to do there."</TE>
<TE>   "So you don't know who you're voting for?" Olguin asked.</TE>
<TE>   "No," Self replied. "I may not vote for governor."</TE>

<HD>Davis Fund-Raiser Is a Last Hurrah</HD>
<DH>He holds his final event before tough limits kick in. The
governor's four- year take: $68 million.</DH>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- On the 1,392nd day, he rested.</LD>
<LD>   This week, Gov. Gray Davis held his final fund-raiser before
Tuesday's election and before much tougher contribution limits take
effect.</LD>
<LD>   The tally: $68 million since he was sworn in on Jan. 4, 1999. The
sum, a record for a governor, exceeded Davis' expectation that he
would raise $50 million in his first term.</LD>
<TE>   The final fund-raiser, on Monday, featured former President
Clinton and was held at Raleigh Studios in Hollywood. It was the last
event at which Davis can raise money in unlimited sums. After
election day, Davis will face restrictions of $20,000 per donor in a
given election, imposed by voters two years ago as part of
Proposition 34. Davis will face stricter limits if he runs for a
federal office, such as U.S. Senate or president.</TE>
<TE>   "My fund-raising needs for the next four years will be only a
fraction of what they were during this campaign," Davis said Thursday
at a rally in Long Beach, where he repeated that he has no plans to
run for another office in the next four years.</TE>
<TE>   A recap of the Democratic incumbent's fund-raising shows that his
biggest source of money has been organized labor, amounting to more
than 22% of the total. Labor unions have given Davis $15.25 million
since he took office.</TE>
<TE>   Most major donors have a stake in legislation and regulatory
action taken by the state. Individuals and entities involved in real
estate, development and construction, including firms that receive
state contracts, donated $6.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   Companies and individuals in the finance industry, including
investors, venture capitalists, banks and others, gave $5.36 million.
The entertainment industry, ranging from studios and music firms to
individual entertainers and cable television companies, donated $5.34
million.</TE>
<TE>   Law firms and people listing their occupation as attorney
contributed $4.1 million to Davis, while the health-care industry,
including physicians, health-insurance companies and other health
professionals donated $3.9 million. The pharmaceutical industry
donated $916,000.</TE>
<TE>   Davis received six-figure donations from at least 142 donors, and
$1 million or more from at least four unions and one individual.</TE>
<TE>   The United Assn., which represents plumbers, appears to be Davis'
largest single source of campaign money.</TE>
<TE>   Campaign finance statements and interviews show the union has
donated about $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   The California Correctional Peace Officers Assn., which represents
state prison guards, has given Davis $1.46 million.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' largest individual donor has been A. Jerrold Perenchio,
chairman of Univision, the Spanish-language television network.
Perenchio, a Malibu resident and major landowner who also gives
heavily to Republicans, has donated $1.02 million to Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Other major individual donors include producer Stephen L. Bing, at
$650,000; horse-racing enthusiast David Shimmon, at $550,000; and
entertainment mogul Haim Saban, along with family members and
companies he has controlled, at $518,000. Saban is a Davis appointee
to the prestigious University of California Board of Regents.</TE>

<HD>New Syphilis Cases Rise for First Time in 11 Years</HD>
<DH>California is among hardest-hit states, with gay and
bisexual men being most affected. Increase is a setback for goal of
eliminating the disease by 2005.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Charles Ornstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The number of new syphilis cases rose in 2001 for the first time in
11 years, with large increases among gay men outpacing continued
declines among blacks and Southerners, federal health officials said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   California was among the hardest-hit states last year, with 547
early-stage syphilis cases, an increase of nearly 68% from 2000. The
vast majority of those infections were among gay and bisexual men,
most of whom also were HIV-positive, according to data from the
California Department of Health Services.</LD>
<LD>   Nationwide, the overall increase, albeit slight, represents a
setback for a four-year-old effort to eliminate syphilis by 2005.
Until last year, the goal of having fewer than 1,000 new cases
annually appeared to be on track, health experts said, but now the
effort seems to be faltering.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 6,103
new infectious syphilis cases nationwide in 2001, up 2.1% from the
previous year. The number of cases among men increased 17.3%, while
the number of female infections dropped 19.6%.</TE>
<TE>   In announcing the 2001 syphilis numbers Thursday, CDC officials
said they continue to make progress among the major populations
affected by syphilis in the last few decades.</TE>
<TE>   The number of cases among African Americans declined 9.9% and
cases in the South dropped 8%. But cases among white males jumped
63%, and the number of infected Latino men increased 50%.</TE>
<TE>   Although syphilis is treatable with antibiotics, its sores greatly
facilitate the spread of HIV. Public health experts fear that the
same unsafe sex practices that foster the spread of syphilis place
people at risk for acquiring HIV.</TE>
<TE>   The most cases nationally, 379, were reported in Wayne County,
Mich., which includes Detroit. Federal and state health officials
have criticized the city for relaxing its prevention efforts after a
decline in cases during the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Despite aggressive prevention campaigns, many gay and bisexual men
don't appear to be practicing safer sex. During the first nine months
of this year, Los Angeles has logged more cases than in all of 2001.
San Francisco has already more than doubled its 2001 count.</TE>
<TE>   "Awareness [of syphilis] is tremendous," said Dr. Jeffrey
Klausner, director of sexually transmitted disease control in San
Francisco. "But we don't have any evidence yet that there's been a
change in sexual behavior in terms of unsafe sex practices."</TE>
<TE>   In a precedent-setting move, San Francisco health officials
recently began offering syphilis patients doses of the antibiotic
Azithromycin to give to their sexual partners and friends who
practice unsafe sex. Since July, though, only 10 patients have taken
antibiotics to give to others -- a small percentage of those seeking
care.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County health officials said sexually transmitted
disease prevention is one of the few areas that received more county
funding this year despite a severe budget crisis. Even so, public
health authorities say they can't control the outbreak until gay and
bisexual men change their behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "In public health, we have to always look at what more we can do,"
said Dr. Jonathan Fielding, the county's director of public health.
"But this cannot be solved entirely without those who are at risk
realizing that they bear some responsibility as well."</TE>
<TE>   There are some causes for optimism. Groups that provide syphilis
testing have seen a rise in demand for their services. The Los
Angeles Gay &amp; Lesbian Center performed 1,798 syphilis blood tests in
the first half of 2002, compared with 1,381 in the first half of
2001, a 30% increase.</TE>
<TE>   The center is now encouraging people seeking HIV tests to also be
screened for sexually transmitted diseases, said Joshua Bobrowsky,
the center's deputy director of health policy.</TE>
<TE>   "The behaviors are the same and the prevention efforts are the
same, but all too often the efforts to address" HIV and other
sexually transmitted diseases are "uncoordinated, and there's hardly
been any new money provided," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The outbreak among gay and bisexual men, experts say, can be
traced to a rise in anonymous sex-seeking activities in bathhouses,
sex clubs and through Internet chat rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Health experts say the CDC's attempt to address the new situation
is far more complicated than its efforts to eliminate the
disproportionate rate of infection among blacks. That effort had
widespread support. By contrast, political pressure from
conservatives in the Bush administration has stymied some efforts to
talk openly about sex and condom use among gay men, some advocates
say.</TE>
<TE>   "I think CDC is constrained about what they can do because of the
political issues in dealing with gay men," said Dr. Jonathan
Zenilman, an STD expert and infectious disease professor at Johns
Hopkins University School of Medicine. "The way to deal with this is
to be ... open and frank about what the risks are and what you need
to do to protect yourself."</TE>
<TE>   CDC officials defended their efforts, but they said they have not
received increased funding from Congress in recent years for
prevention of sexually transmitted diseases. The agency sent teams to
several large cities last year to help coordinate their responses to
the outbreaks.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Ronald O. Valdiserri, a top STD official at CDC, said he
believes the 2005 goal for syphilis elimination is still within
reach. Eighty percent of U.S. counties didn't report a single case of
early-stage syphilis in 2001. And half of the cases are concentrated
in 20 counties and an independent city, allowing the CDC to focus its
resources.</TE>

<HD>Judge Blocks Oil and Gas Exploration in Southern Utah</HD>
<DH>Environmentalists say search would harm area. The ruling
could affect Bush's energy initiatives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Interior Department from
permitting oil exploration on thousands of acres of public wilderness
on the eastern boundary of Utah's Arches National Park, a setback for
the Bush administration's drive to expand oil and gas exploration in
southern Utah and throughout the Rocky Mountain region.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling Wednesday in Washington by U.S. District Judge James
Robertson temporarily halted plans by WesternGeco, a major seismic
exploration company, to search for oil and gas in the Dome Plateau
region, a 23,000-acre expanse of wilderness popular with hikers and
mountain bikers and home to the black-footed ferret, Mexican spotted
owl and other endangered species.</LD>
<LD>   Robertson agreed with environmental groups that brought the suit
that the use of huge seismic "thumper trucks" to search for
underground oil and gas reserves would irreparably harm the fragile
soils, plants and animals as well as the area's visual beauty. But
while giving the groups more time to argue that the exploration
permits were granted in violation of federal environmental law, the
judge warned that "the plaintiffs' ultimate success on the merits
appears questionable."</LD>
<TE>   The administration is mulling dozens of proposals to drill on
public lands in Wyoming, Montana, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah in
the wake of the Senate decision this year to reject President Bush's
plan for drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The
outcome of legal challenges in Utah and elsewhere could have a
profound impact on the administration's energy initiatives.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no doubt it's an uphill battle any time you challenge a
federal agency," said Stephen Bloch, a lawyer for the Southern Utah
Wilderness Alliance, a plaintiff in the suit. "But I think once we
have an opportunity to present our case fully on the merits, I think
we will be successful -- and a favorable decision could have very
serious but positive ramifications for us in these other cases."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. James Hansen (R-Utah), chairman of the House Resources
Committee and an administration ally, called the court ruling
"discouraging but not surprising."</TE>
<TE>   "These environmental extremists are opposed to virtually all
energy development," Hansen said.</TE>
<TE>   Interior Department spokesman John Wright said: "Out of precaution
the court has granted the preliminary injunction in favor of the
plaintiffs. We don't believe that the plaintiffs can make their
case."</TE>
<TE>   Southern Utah, with its vast stretches of scenic red rock canyons
and fragile wilderness areas, has become the central battleground in
the controversy over the administration's energy policies.</TE>
<TE>   Since Bush took office, at least nine seismic oil and gas
exploration projects have been started or completed in southern Utah,
environmentalists say, a marked increase in activity from previous
years.</TE>
<TE>   A Jan. 4 memorandum from the Bureau of Land Management to its
field offices said the administration "has assigned a high priority
to oil and gas exploration and production in this country," and
spelled out dozens of ways to expedite permit applications for energy
exploration in Utah. "Utah needs to ensure that existing staff
understand that when an oil and gas lease parcel or when [a permit
application] comes in the door, that this work is their No. 1
priority," the memorandum said.</TE>
<TE>   For more than a decade, Congress has considered legislation to
designate more than 9 million acres of southern Utah as wilderness
areas off limits to development. Although the bill has almost 170
House co-sponsors, Utah lawmakers and western property interests and
industry have kept it bottled up.</TE>

<LD>Former Newark Mayor Kenneth A. Gibson admitted avoiding about $78,000
in income tax under a plea bargain that let him avoid a retrial on
accusations of business fraud.</LD>
<LD>   Seventeen other charges were dismissed, and Gibson was immediately
sentenced to three years' probation on the single remaining felony
charge.</LD>
<LD>   Gibson, 70, a licensed engineer, was accused of cheating the
Irvington school district while managing a school construction
project five years after leaving office. He was mayor of Newark from

<HD>Bush Begins Blitz for GOP Votes</HD>
<DH>The president aims to turn the tide in closest races. He
will stump in 15 states by Tuesday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edwin Chen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ABERDEEN, S.D.</DL>
<LD>Calling on voters to elect a Republican Congress that will enact his
agenda, President Bush began a final campaign sprint Thursday that
will take him to 17 cities in 15 states by next week's midterm
elections.</LD>
<LD>   Bush issued that plea at three spirited political rallies, here
and then in South Bend, Ind., and Charleston, W.Va. -- areas with
some of the hardest-fought and closest races in Tuesday's elections.</LD>
<LD>   Addressing a well-bundled crowd in the Northern State University
gymnasium on a frigid South Dakota morning, the president touted the
candidacy of GOP Rep. John R. Thune, who is running neck and neck
against incumbent Democratic Sen. Tim Johnson.</LD>
<TE>   This particular campaign has acquired something of a personal
tone. South Dakota is the home of Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle,
the Democrats' chief voice in Washington and Johnson's mentor.
Aberdeen also is Daschle's hometown, and Bush is the first president
to visit this city in 66 years.</TE>
<TE>   The president considers this race so important, in fact, that he
is returning to the state on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, the party in the White House loses seats in the
midterm elections, but Bush is hoping that his strong popularity
ratings will extend to congressional candidates. Republicans
currently control the House, while Democrats have a narrow edge in
the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   As is his wont when addressing partisan rallies, Bush did not
directly attack the Democrats' candidate; but his remarks on Thune's
behalf contained a dose of implied criticism of Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   With the prospect of a conflict in Iraq, plus the ongoing war on
terrorism, military preparedness has become a key issue in this
increasingly acrimonious campaign. Thune has attacked Johnson for
opposing the missile defense system that Bush favors.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson has replied by noting that his son serves in the military;
he also co-sponsored the Senate resolution authorizing Bush to take
military action against Iraq if President Saddam Hussein does not get
rid of any weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   In his remarks Thursday, Bush hailed Thune as "a man who is
committed to our military -- and not just at election time." The
president also called him "an independent fellow who ... can work
with both Democrats and Republicans."</TE>
<TE>   Among his many grievances with the Democrat-controlled Senate,
Bush cited its refusal to confirm many of his judicial nominations.</TE>
<TE>   "I need a senator with whom I can work to make sure that we stop
playing petty partisan politics with the judicial nominations I've
sent up; to make sure people's records aren't distorted; and to make
sure we have a bench that is full of judges who aren't there to write
the law, they're there to strictly interpret the United States
Constitution," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly every poll has shown the South Dakota race to be within the
margin of error, and it is expected to go down to the wire on
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also praised the GOP candidacies of Gov. William Janklow, a
personal friend running for Thune's House seat, and state Senate
Majority Leader Mike Rounds, who is seeking to replace Janklow as
governor.</TE>
<TE>   In urging a strong GOP get-out-the-vote effort, Bush hopes for the
election of Republicans who will "help him implement his agenda,"
said Scott McClellan, deputy White House press secretary.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also has taped a get-out-the-vote message for the Republican
National Committee, which is being distributed around the country,
McClellan said.</TE>
<TE>   At each stop Thursday, Bush urged all citizens to vote, but he
also added, with a smile, that he had a few "suggestions" for them
"inside the voting booth."</TE>
<TE>   In South Dakota, a heavily Republican state, Democrats have been
especially aggressive in registering and mobilizing voters to get
them to the polls.</TE>
<TE>   But their efforts to register Native Americans have been marred by
allegations of irregularities on or near Indian reservations --
possibly involving deceased or nonexistent people. That has drawn the
attention of the FBI and the state attorney general's office.</TE>
<TE>   So far, statewide voter registration drives have upped the number
of registered voters by about 24,000 -- an increase of more than 5%,
according to state election officials.</TE>
<TE>   In South Bend, Bush praised Chris Chocola, a businessman running
against former Rep. Jill Long Thompson, a Democrat, to succeed
retiring Rep. Tim Roemer, also a Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   Before ending more than 14 hours on the campaign trail, Bush
addressed a rally in Charleston, where first-term GOP Rep. Shelley
Moore Capito is facing a serious challenge from businessman Jim
Humphreys in the country's most expensive House race.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Bush will campaign in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and
Kentucky. Saturday he goes to Tennessee and Georgia, and then he will
spend the night in Tampa, Fla. On Sunday, he will campaign with his
brother, Gov. Jeb Bush, before going to Illinois, Minnesota, South
Dakota and Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   And on Monday, the president will campaign in Missouri, Arkansas
and Texas.</TE>
<TE>   He plans to spend that night at his ranch near Crawford, Texas,
then vote the next morning before returning to Washington.</TE>

<HD>Judge OKs Delay on Cheney Papers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A federal judge said Thursday he would give the Bush administration
an extra three weeks before it must produce documents -- or identify
which papers should remain confidential -- from Vice President Dick
Cheney's energy task force.</LD>
<LD>   The documents are being sought in connection with a lawsuit
seeking information on what outside groups influenced the task force
as it prepared an energy policy report in early 2001.</LD>
<LD>   The Justice Department revealed in documents filed with the court
this week that the White House had reviewed only two of 12 boxes of
task force documents, although it had been ordered last August to
produce the documents by Tuesday, or list those that it believes
should be withheld on constitutional grounds.</LD>
<TE>   At a hearing Thursday, U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan said
that since the administration -- despite the delays -- appears to
have shown some "good faith compliance," he was willing to extend the
deadline. He did not set a specific date.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Sullivan made clear he is all but certain to
reject a government request to put the case on hold, pending a formal
appeal of his order to produce the papers.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan repeatedly told government lawyers at the hearing
Thursday that he was not inclined to go along with such a request.</TE>
<TE>   The judge is expected to make a formal decision on the request for
a stay, as well as announce a new deadline for the documents, at
another hearing scheduled for today.</TE>
<TE>   In a three-page court filing this week, the administration said it
had sorted through 10,000 e-mails to find several thousand messages
about the Cheney task force. It said it had 12 boxes of documents
pertaining to the group, but only two of the boxes had been examined
to determine what items could be made public.</TE>
<TE>   The case involves a consolidation of two lawsuits, one filed by
Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group, and another by the
Sierra Club, an environmental advocacy group.</TE>

<HD>GOP May Lose Its Edge in States</HD>
<DH>Democrats are on track to end the Republicans' eight-year
dominance in governors' offices, a shift that would alter local and
presidential politics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nick Anderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- For the last eight years, Republicans have held the
governor's office in more than half of the 50 states. Democrats are
poised to erase that edge next week -- a shift that would reverberate
across the country in both local and presidential politics.</LD>
<LD>   At minimum, Democrats are expected to approach parity with the
GOP, winning enough of the 36 gubernatorial contests on Tuesday to
command the top office in two dozen states. The Democrats also could
gain a clear majority.</LD>
<LD>   Republicans now govern 27 states, Democrats 21 and independents
two. But perhaps more significant than the raw numbers is the size of
the states each party governs.</LD>
<TE>   Not only is Democrat Gray Davis favored to win reelection as
governor of California, but several other large states now led by
Republican governors are tilting toward a Democratic takeover --
including Illinois, Michigan and Pennsylvania, all considered pivotal
in presidential contests.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got some heavy-hitter states" poised to turn over, said
John Kohut, an analyst for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.
"The implications for 2004 are clear. Democrats have gained some
ground."</TE>
<TE>   In all, 10 of the 15 most populous states are expected to have
Democratic governors next year. That's a conservative projection.
Among the other five:</TE>
<TE>   * Florida, where Republican Gov. Jeb Bush is in a tight race for
reelection against Democrat Bill McBride;</TE>
<TE>   * Massachusetts, where Democrat Shannon O'Brien and Republican
Mitt Romney are in a dead heat for an open seat; and</TE>
<TE>   * Texas, where GOP Gov. Rick Perry, elevated when George W. Bush
became president, faces a tough challenge from Democrat Tony Sanchez,
who is spending tens of millions of dollars of his own fortune.</TE>
<TE>   Only in New York and Ohio, among the major states, are Republicans
apparently assured of holding on to the governorship.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on its strength, the Democratic gubernatorial surge
could produce another milestone. Among the party's nominees are nine
women, all running competitively. If four win, then at least six
governors next year would be women -- a record.</TE>
<TE>   The lone Republican female nominee, Linda Lingle in Hawaii, also
is running a strong campaign. Currently, there are five female
governors.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans face potential losses in large part because they have
more seats to defend Tuesday -- 23 of the 36. Many of their
warhorses, such as Gov. John Engler of Michigan, were forced out by
term limits. Democrat Jennifer Granholm, one of this year's most
prominent candidates, is favored to succeed him.</TE>
<TE>   Other vulnerable Republican incumbents and candidates are laboring
in the long shadow of GOP predecessors.</TE>
<TE>   Republican Gov. Scott McCallum of Wisconsin, for instance, is
seeking to win on his own a post once held by Tommy G. Thompson, now
a Bush administration Cabinet secretary; and Republican nominee Mike
Fisher in Pennsylvania is seeking the post vacated last year by White
House advisor Tom Ridge. Democrats James Doyle in Wisconsin and
Edward G. Rendell in Pennsylvania are giving both men all they can
handle.</TE>
<TE>   One Republican in Illinois suffers from bad timing. State Atty.
Gen. Jim Ryan is trailing in a bid to succeed a scandal-tarnished GOP
incumbent governor also named Ryan. Democrat Rod R. Blagojevich, a
three-term U.S. House member, is the front-runner.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats have relatively few vulnerable incumbents. Two are Govs.
Donald Siegelman of Alabama and Jim Hodges of South Carolina, running
against Republicans Bob Riley and Mark Sanford, respectively. Gov.
Tom Vilsack of Iowa is also in a tight race against Republican Doug
Gross.</TE>
<TE>   Although critical in each of the three dozen states where
elections are being held, the gubernatorial campaigns as a whole have
attracted less national attention than the battle for Congress. That
was also true in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   In that year, Republicans won control of the House and the Senate
for the first time in 40 years. But they also broke a long-standing
Democratic stranglehold on power at the state level, capturing a
majority of the governorships for the first time in a
quarter-century.</TE>
<TE>   Republican dominance in state government during the late 1990s
played a critical role in policy and politics. In policy, GOP
governors had a major hand in reshaping welfare programs and deciding
whether to cut taxes or raise spending -- or do both -- as states
enjoyed record surpluses.</TE>
<TE>   A Help to Bush</TE>
<TE>   In politics, Republican governors helped elect one of their own as
president in 2000. First, they helped Bush, who was first elected
Texas governor in 1994, capture the GOP nomination. Then they
deployed their fund-raising and grass-roots networks to help him win
a razor-thin victory in the general election.</TE>
<TE>   Now three of those governors hold Cabinet rank in the Bush
administration: Christie Whitman of New Jersey, head of the
Environmental Protection Agency; Thompson, secretary of Health and
Human Services; and Ridge, director of homeland security. The
attorney general, John Ashcroft of Missouri, is also a former
governor.</TE>
<TE>   If they gain governorships on Tuesday, Democrats would be able to
use the positions to their own advantage, cultivating potential
Cabinet members and presidential candidates. Since 1976, every
president but one -- George H. W. Bush -- has served as a governor.</TE>
<TE>   At the very least, the growing ranks of Democratic governors would
pose troubles for President Bush's reelection.</TE>
<TE>   As state chief executives, Democrats also would be able to carry
out their own vision of government in a way that their counterparts
in Congress -- checked by presidential power -- cannot.</TE>
<TE>   "Governors do have the ability to set public policy for their
states," said Earl Black, a political scientist at Rice University.</TE>
<TE>   A case in point is California's Davis, who has signed legislation
in recent months to promote stem-cell research, require paid family
leave and tighten emission standards for motor vehicles -- a sharp
contrast to Bush's record.</TE>
<TE>   In 2003, the nation's governors will face enormous challenges,
topped by record budget deficits that must be erased with spending
cuts or tax increases.</TE>
<TE>   Tough Job Ahead</TE>
<TE>   "Who leads in a state -- at a time when we've devolved a lot of
responsibility to the states and at a time when we've gone from
surplus to deficit -- is extremely important," said Kathleen Hall
Jamieson, professor of communication at the University of
Pennsylvania. "Governors are going to have an incredibly difficult
task in the next four years."</TE>
<TE>   Many of them, of course, already have it tough. Analysts say the
budget squeeze this year at the state level has given Democratic
gubernatorial hopefuls an opening.</TE>
<TE>   "Nationwide, there are more vulnerable Republicans and more
Republicans holding governorships," said Burdett A. Loomis, a
political scientist at the University of Kansas. "And you're
operating in uniformly awful economic times. The question is, can
[Democrats] grasp it? Can they take the opportunity?"</TE>

<HD>Mondale Gets Back on the Campaign Trail</HD>
<DH>Former vice president invokes the legacy of the late Paul
Wellstone. He also has to introduce himself to a new generation of
voters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Simon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>On his first full day running to reclaim the Senate seat he last held
26 years ago, former Vice President Walter F. Mondale opened the
morning by doing something unusual in this most unusual campaign --
delivering the weather report.</LD>
<LD>   "Clear and 19 degrees at Gunther's grocery store in Elmore," he
said at his first stop, a Minneapolis radio station.</LD>
<LD>   He also visited with the late Sen. Paul Wellstone's campaign staff
and his two sons and appeared on a college campus, where most
students would have been toddlers in 1984, the last time he was on an
election ballot. He wrapped up the day by shaking hands with office
workers and shoppers near the statue of another Minnesota icon, the
hat-tossing television character Mary Richards from "The Mary Tyler
Moore Show," which was set here.</LD>
<TE>   Mondale's first day on the stump was far less rigorous than that
of the Republican candidate, former St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman, who
spent the day on a five-city tour. Still, Mondale captured the
spotlight. He sounded at times like a history professor, talking
about his ill-fated 1984 presidential campaign and referring to
Presidents Nixon and Carter. And he sprinkled his comments with
references to Wellstone, whom he described as a dear friend and whose
causes he pledged to pursue passionately.</TE>
<TE>   Though his public appearances were limited, Mondale's first TV ad
began airing across Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   "I know our state ... and I know the Senate," Mondale says in the
ad. "I'll continue Paul's fight for people."</TE>
<TE>   Separately, the United Steel Workers and Service Employees
International Union, with 40,000 members in the state, began running
a radio ad saying, "There really isn't a better person than Walter
Mondale to pick up Paul's banner."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans were contemplating running an ad in the next few days
assailing Mondale's record during his years as Jimmy Carter's vice
president. The ad pictures Mondale and Carter along with words such
as inflation, gas lines and defense cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Mondale was officially chosen by Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party
delegates Wednesday to replace Wellstone in the Senate race, one of a
handful expected to determine the chamber's balance of power.
Wellstone, along with his wife, daughter, three aides and two pilots,
died last Friday in the crash of a small plane in northern Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman, who was handpicked by President Bush to run for the
Senate, hopes to get a big push for his campaign with visits today by
Vice President Dick Cheney, Saturday by First Lady Laura Bush and
Sunday by the president. The most recent statewide poll showed
Mondale with an 8-point lead.</TE>
<TE>   As Mondale hit the campaign trail, the Minnesota Supreme Court
ordered that new absentee ballots be sent out to any voters who
request them.</TE>
<TE>   Election officials had ruled that any absentee ballots cast for
Wellstone would not be counted, a policy that Democratic officials
asserted would give an unfair advantage to Coleman. Democratic
officials had wanted the court to order new absentee ballots to be
sent out to voters, whether or not they requested one.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Erlandson, chairman of the state Democratic-Farmer-Labor
Party, said, "This ruling signifies that all Minnesotans have the
right to vote, and their vote will count."</TE>
<TE>   Mondale appeared comfortable back on the stump, though he said it
was a "strange moment" out of a Shakespearean play for him to lose a
friend and find himself on the ballot, with only five days to
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "This is tough on you and it's tough on me," he told students at
Macalester College. "This was not my idea. My idea was to elect Paul
Wellstone back to the United States Senate. But I think somebody had
to carry Paul's torch."</TE>
<TE>   Mondale, long a critic of the corrupting influence of big campaign
contributions, seemed relieved about one thing: "I'm not going to
make one phone call for money."</TE>
<TE>   Democratic officials say Wellstone's campaign funds cannot be
transferred to Mondale, but the state and national parties have about
$500,000 available for campaign advertising on his behalf.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign released a letter from Mondale's physician, Dr. Paul
Phillips, declaring the 74-year-old candidate, who walks two miles a
day, "in excellent health," even though he suffered a blood clot in
February that left him with partial vision in his right eye. Mondale
received a warm welcome at Macalester, which he attended, though some
students said they had to call their parents to find out more about
him.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Swaney, 18, a freshman from Oakland, who is registered
to vote in Minnesota, said that her parents phoned to tell her: "When
you were born, Mondale was running for president. But now you have a
chance to vote for him."</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Seburg, 19, a sophomore, said that Mondale seems above
partisan politics: "He's very much regarded like a state hero."</TE>
<TE>   With a Wellstone campaign button on his lapel, Mondale said he
would have voted as Wellstone did in opposing a resolution, approved
by the Senate, authorizing a unilateral U.S. attack against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   But Mondale emphasized his own strengths. "I've been there," he
said of the chamber where he served from 1964 to 1976 and over which
he presided as vice president from 1977 to 1981.</TE>
<TE>   Although Mondale shares many of Wellstone's liberal views, the
former vice president has become a bit more moderate over the years.</TE>
<TE>   "In some sense, the aging Mondale has become a New Democrat," said
Dan Hofrenning, chairman of the political science department at St.
Olaf College.</TE>
<TE>   "Like Bill Clinton, the quintessential New Democrat, he supports
free trade. Wellstone opposed free trade and was in some sense more
of an old Democrat than Mondale."</TE>
<TE>   But in other ways, Mondale follows in Wellstone's footsteps.
Mondale speaks about "giving voice to the voiceless and taking care
of the less fortunate. These are the high notes of Wellstone's
legacy," Hofrenning said.</TE>
<TE>   Mondale said that he would debate Coleman, though no details were
announced. He said he plans to travel around the state -- in a bus,
rather than a small plane, according to an aide. He also said, if
elected, he would serve a full six-year term.</TE>
<TE>   Mondale also recalled that he apologized to Nancy Reagan during
his ill-fated 1984 presidential campaign for raising the issue of
President Reagan's age, when Reagan was then a year younger than
Mondale is today.</TE>
<TE>   "Reagan had the famous line, 'If you don't criticize my age, I
won't criticize your youth and inexperience,' " Mondale said.</TE>
<TE>   And he sought to put to rest a controversy over Wellstone's
memorial service, which took on the aura of a political rally. Noting
that Democratic officials already had apologized, Mondale said: "Let
us remember that this unbelievable event heard from speakers who were
talking about loved ones and their family who lost their lives. They
were not censored in what they had to say. And some of them, maybe,
went a little bit over the line."</TE>
<TE>   He also extended an olive branch to Republicans, saying he was
pleased that a number of GOP senators had attended the service.</TE>
<TE>   "I loved the feeling of being there together as Americans ... to
grieve a great leader," he said.</TE>

<HD>Issue in North Carolina Race: It's the Economy</HD>
<DH>Republican Elizabeth Dole and Democrat Erskine Bowles are
focusing on jobs as the closely watched Senate contest tightens.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ken Ellingwood</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEWTON, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Evidence of the anxieties roiling this country town was as near as
the headline announcing another factory shutdown, spelling 97 more
layoffs in a region where the mood this week seemed as leaden as the
chill autumn sky.</LD>
<LD>   News of plans to close the Alcatel plant, which manufactures
fiber-optic wire in nearby Claremont, delivered another belly blow to
Catawba County, which during the last two years has endured a series
of cutbacks in furniture, textiles and fiber optics. The string of
reductions -- due to recession, corporate restructuring and foreign
imports -- has cost the county more than 4,000 jobs.</LD>
<LD>   Those sagging economic fortunes have made for an electorate that
is particularly fretful about jobs as Republican Elizabeth Hanford
Dole and Democrat Erskine Bowles square off in a ferocious and
closely watched U.S. Senate race. The campaign to fill the seat being
vacated by Republican Sen. Jesse Helms, who will retire after 30
years, has tightened in recent days, with Dole's lead in single
digits. The jobs issue may prove decisive.</LD>
<TE>   Job creation topped the list of campaign issues among registered
North Carolina voters polled by Elon University in a survey released
last week. Ninety percent of respondents deemed job creation
"important" or "very important" in making their choice for senator.</TE>
<TE>   "Jobs is No. 1," declared a Newton worker, who said his hours at a
fiber-optic company were halved this year. The man, who declined to
give his name for fear of upsetting his employer, said the cutbacks
have forced him to supplement his $13-an-hour wage as an on-again,
off-again forklift driver with unemployment checks. "If you can bring
jobs, that's what everybody wants," he said. "Bring the jobs back,
instead of layoffs."</TE>
<TE>   That reality isn't lost on either of the Senate candidates, who
have clobbered each other in television commercials and campaign
speeches over who is to blame for the mess and who can best address a
downturn aggravated by global trade, shifting tastes and broad
economic changes that may doom lunch-bucket jobs in industries
ranging from textile to tobacco.</TE>
<TE>   Shutdowns and layoffs meant pink slips for 64,000 state residents
last year. So along with the usual jousting over Social Security,
school vouchers and prescription drug benefits for seniors, the
Senate campaign has centered on jobs and trade policy to a remarkable
degree.</TE>
<TE>   "This state in particular is going through a pretty painful
economic transition. This recession has taken a really severe toll on
the state. It has hastened the collapse of the low-wage, low-skill,
small-town industries," said Ferrel Guillory, director of the Program
in Southern Politics, Media and Public Life at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill. "At the root here -- what this race is
really about -- is which candidate can tap into and become the
vehicle for helping the state cope with this really important
transition."</TE>
<TE>   Dole, 66, the former U.S. Labor secretary and onetime presidential
candidate, had barely stepped off her campaign bus for a stop in
Newton this week when she turned to the economic themes dominating
the stretch drive.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of people hurting all across the state. A lot of
people have lost their jobs," she told a gathering of about 40
supporters Wednesday morning in the old Catawba County courthouse
downtown, 45 miles northwest of Charlotte. "There's a lot of hurt and
pain."</TE>
<TE>   The candidate touted her "Dole plan," which favors job creation
through tax relief, more federal aid to community colleges and added
protections for North Carolina's textile industry through the use of
"tracers" -- high-tech markings embedded in fabrics to distinguish
home-grown products from smuggled imports.</TE>
<TE>   Sounding a familiar theme, Dole blamed the administration of
President Clinton, whom Bowles served as White House chief of staff,
for failing to adequately block illegal imports. "When I hear Erskine
Bowles, my opponent, say we must vigorously enforce trade laws, all I
can say is, Erskine, you had your chance," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Dole, who has come under fire from Bowles for her support of
expanding the president's authority to negotiate trade agreements,
said the United States needs unfettered access to foreign
marketplaces. She vowed never to endorse a treaty that would hurt
North Carolina workers.</TE>
<TE>   Dole, wearing a violet suit, worked the carpeted aisle of the
courtroom in the manner of a talk-show host. She drew a chuckle from
the audience, mostly seniors, when she mocked what she called "the
Bowles plan," holding up a blank sheet of paper. "His plan is about
attacking my plan," Dole said.</TE>
<TE>   The main topic was jobs and trade that afternoon also, as Bowles,
a 57-year-old former banker, greeted workers changing shifts at a
textile factory in Kannapolis, 25 miles northeast of Charlotte. "I'm
Erskine Bowles. Hope you'll vote for me -- keep these jobs here," he
said, offering his hand and an occasional clasp of the shoulder. A
dozen or so supporters, members of a textile workers union, held
campaign placards and handed out fliers to the brisk parade of
workers, who make towels, sheets and pillowcases for Fieldcrest
Cannon.</TE>
<TE>   On this afternoon, the bespectacled Bowles, who has spent $4.1
million of his own money on the race, was buttoned down in a blue
oxford shirt and cuffed slacks. As he shook hands, his campaign
touted a new Mason-Dixon poll indicating that Dole's once-huge lead
had shrunk to 6 percentage points, the narrowest margin yet. A
separate poll conducted on behalf of the Bowles campaign showed a
3-point margin, within the margin of error, making the race a dead
heat.</TE>
<TE>   "The momentum's on our side. The issues are on our side and, most
of all, I think the people are," Bowles declared.</TE>
<TE>   He dismissed Dole's claim that the Clinton administration had
failed to police against product-dumping by foreign countries as
"revisionist history." Bowles once helped lead the fight for the
North American Free Trade Agreement, but he now opposes so-called
"fast-track" negotiating authority for presidents until there is
better enforcement of existing pacts. He said the Bush administration
has failed in two years to stop unsanctioned goods from crossing the
border.</TE>
<TE>   Voters trying to make sense of the race have had to endure a
dizzying wave of thousands of political commercials on behalf of the
two candidates, many of them negative. Squabbling over redistricting
delayed the Democratic primary from May until late September, so the
advertising frenzy has been compressed into just six weeks. Two
debates provided little spontaneity, offering voters scant help.</TE>
<TE>   Political analysts said the blitz of attack ads was to be
expected, especially in a state where Helms long ago had made an art
form of negative advertising. For one thing, Bowles had to counter
Dole's towering advantage in name recognition, a familiarity born of
her 2000 presidential bid, her husband, former Sen. Bob Dole, and her
roles as Labor secretary and head of the American Red Cross, said Ted
Arrington, who heads the political science department at the
University of North Carolina in Charlotte.</TE>
<TE>   Those roles provided Dole with a generally positive image apart
from her stands on thorny political issues, Arrington said.</TE>
<TE>   Bowles, despite having served as White House chief of staff in
1997 and 1998, wasn't well known in his home state, where Clinton is
a liability. But as Dole's more controversial stands have been aired
and Bowles's exposure has grown, the race has predictably tightened.
Close Senate races are the norm in North Carolina, where registered
Democrats outnumber Republicans but independents -- many of them
white, right-leaning, blue-collar "Jessecrats" -- now account for 1
in 6 voters. "They're in play," Arrington said.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the results of the Senate race, deep economic changes
afoot in places such as Catawba County are not expected to stop.
Residents are getting used to the idea that the old mainstays may be
fading to history.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care who they put into office. I don't see an overnight
answer," said Ray Callahan, minding the counter at Callahan's Cafe in
downtown Newton. "Furniture and textiles are never coming back. We
need something else."</TE>

<HD>McCall's Uphill Fight for N.Y. Governor Falters</HD>
<DH>Democrat's campaign is going nowhere, polls show. He's
short on money and is up against a skillful foe in Pataki.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John J. Goldman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>NEW YORK -- H. Carl McCall, the Democratic candidate for governor,
stands outside Pennsylvania Station as darkness approaches, trying to
shake hands with a crush of commuters who largely ignore him as they
race for trains.</LD>
<LD>   "Nice to see you. Thank you very much," McCall manages to tell
those pausing for a handshake. Often, he barely gets the words out
before the person has disappeared.</LD>
<LD>   The rush past McCall is an apt metaphor for a campaign perceived
as so moribund that pollsters and political advisors already have
begun post-mortems.</LD>
<TE>   In the Empire State, where there are 2 million more Democrats than
Republicans, McCall trails two-term Gov. George Pataki by as much as
20 points in some polls.</TE>
<TE>   Outspent massively and just about out of money, he faces an
incumbent who has skillfully used the power of the governor's office
to co-opt traditional Democratic themes and constituencies.</TE>
<TE>   "People generally think Pataki has done a good job and most people
think the state is headed in the right direction and those are two
things that work well for incumbents," said Lee M. Miringoff,
director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. "The competition
hasn't been able to lay a glove on him."</TE>
<TE>   Just one statistic from the latest Marist poll shows the uphill
fight faced by McCall, the state's comptroller, who is seeking to
become New York's first African American governor: Regardless of whom
voters support, 83% of those interviewed said they believed Pataki
would be reelected.</TE>
<TE>   The governor's race could become the most expensive
non-presidential contest in the nation's history.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the candidates have spent more than $118 million, with Tom
Golisano, a billionaire businessman running on the Independence Party
line, laying out more than $54 million -- mostly his own money.
Pataki has spent more than $39 million; McCall, more than $14
million.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Cuomo, the former secretary of Housing and Urban
Development in the Clinton administration, spent more than $11
million before dropping out of the Democratic primary, ensuring
McCall would be the standard-bearer.</TE>
<TE>   "Andrew's timing kind of devalued getting the nomination," said
David Garth, a veteran campaign consultant.</TE>
<TE>   The result: McCall entered the general election lacking necessary
momentum for fund-raising.</TE>
<TE>   Just when polls showed the race narrowing, it was revealed that
McCall had written letters on the comptroller's stationery to
companies in which the state held stock asking for jobs for family
members. The revelation damaged his campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The 67-year-old McCall -- who courted voters with themes of
improving education and the economy, providing quality health care
and affordable housing -- found the governor had seized those issues
long before the election and had used them effectively to woo
traditional Democratic support.</TE>
<TE>   Symbolic of Pataki's success was the endorsement of Local 1199 of
the Service Employees International Union, representing 208,000
health-care workers. For the first time in 40 years, the union backed
a Republican after legislation favorable to the union won the
governor's approval.</TE>
<TE>   "Pataki deftly moved to the center of the political spectrum and
is generally seen as a moderate by voters, and that's where most of
the voters are," Miringoff said.</TE>
<TE>   Polls show that Pataki, 57, has made inroads into traditionally
Democratic New York City, cut his losses upstate, where Golisano
remains his chief challenger, and is running strongly in New York
City's suburbs.</TE>
<TE>   Poll numbers also show Golisano has not harmed Pataki as much as
McCall's strategists hoped he would. The Independence Party candidate
draws as much support from McCall as from the governor.</TE>

New York mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani backed Democrat Mario M. Cuomo in
the gubernatorial election.</TE>
<TE>   After winning, Pataki was so angry he refused to talk to Giuliani
for weeks. For a time, the mayor was a GOP pariah. These days, he is
a highly popular figure in the Republican Party, and his endorsement

<HD>Copilot's Actions at Heart of Hearings in Flight 587 Crash</HD>
<DH>Airbus says aggressive use of rudder caused disaster.
Airline says it wasn't warned of flaws.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar and Eric Malnic</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>He was described as a pilot who had "hands of silk" and "did
everything by the book."</LD>
<LD>   Even a fellow pilot who offered a rare criticism of Sten Molin's
airmanship called him a "perfectionist." Yet despite his skills,
federal air safety investigators are trying to discern whether Molin
could have made a tragic mistake that caused the tail to rip off
American Airlines Flight 587.</LD>
<LD>   Copilot Molin, who was at the controls of the Airbus A300, is the
man in the middle of this week's National Transportation Safety Board
hearings on the crash. The Nov. 12 accident killed all 260 aboard and
five people on the ground in a New York neighborhood.</LD>
<TE>   Molin's actions have become the focal point of an acrimonious
battle between Airbus and American, which has brought courtroom-like
tension to the accident hearings. The two companies could share tens
of millions of dollars in monetary liability over the causes of the
crash.</TE>
<TE>   While not directly pointing fingers, Airbus witnesses insisted
there was nothing mechanically wrong with the plane. They suggested
the tail fin failed because of Molin's overly aggressive use of the
plane's rudder to handle turbulence from the wake of a larger plane.
Molin had been criticized for overusing the rudder once before and
apparently had responded by changing his technique.</TE>
<TE>   American contends that Airbus did not adequately inform its
airline customers of the tail fin's vulnerability to abrupt,
back-and-forth rudder movements. Tensions between the two companies
spilled over Thursday in a discussion of a tangential issue: whether
they fully cooperated in addressing safety concerns from a turbulence
incident in the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   By all accounts, Molin, 34 and the son of an airline pilot, was
gifted and careful. But if he ultimately is blamed for the Flight 587
crash, his use of the rudder last November could become a textbook
example of what not to do.</TE>
<TE>   "It was clear to me from the first day that they would take a shot
at my son," said Stanley Molin, who gave his son, then a teenager,
his first flying lessons in a small plane. "I'm aware that he was the
pilot at the controls and that statistically [most] accidents are
attributed to pilot error. But we still don't know that [these]
pilots did that."</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Sam Mayer, who flies for American Airlines out of the New
York area, said the younger Molin was known as a meticulous
professional with an upbeat attitude and a broad range of interests
and friends.</TE>
<TE>   Molin was a gourmet cook and a computer whiz since his teens who
also loved centuries-old pursuits such as sailing.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't fit the mold of your crusty old pilot," Mayer said. "He
was a lot more erudite than that."</TE>
<TE>   Molin was hired by American Airlines in 1991 after working for
smaller carriers. The voluminous accident case file is full of
details about Molin's habits. He was an early riser and a nonsmoker.
At 5 feet 11, he weighed a trim 165 pounds. Highly allergic to cats,
he took nothing stronger than Claritin for relief.</TE>
<TE>   As a youth in Greenwich, Conn., Molin volunteered for a program
that provided rides for teens who may have been drinking. As an
adult, he rarely drank alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   Molin was not married and had no children, but he remained in
close touch with Diane Mascia, an American flight attendant he had
dated for three years until 1997. Mascia spoke to Molin by phone the
night before his last flight. She told investigators that he was in
good spirits and looking forward to flying the next morning with
Capt. Edward States, a family man and one of Molin's favorite pilots.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier that Sunday, Molin had helped a friend cover her sailboat
for the winter. In the evening, he invited two friends to his house
for dinner. Mascia said he probably went to bed before 11 p.m.,
because he liked to get a good night's sleep before flying. His
father found Molin's alarm clock set for 5:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The one question mark in Molin's professional background was
revealed by Capt. John Lavelle, a senior Boeing 737 pilot for
American. In an interview last summer with the NTSB, Lavelle reported
that five years ago, he criticized Molin for overly aggressive use of
the rudder during a takeoff.</TE>
<TE>   The rudder is a movable panel on the rear edge of a plane's
vertical tail fin. Operated by a system of pedals, its main use is to
keep a plane flying straight when landing or taking off in a
crosswind, or if an engine fails. Airline pilots make very little use
of the rudder in normal flight.</TE>
<TE>   NTSB investigators said in a report that Lavelle told them Molin
had "excellent flying abilities [but] one strange tendency: to be
very aggressive on the rudder pedals."</TE>
<TE>   Lavelle said he had seen evidence of this on one occasion in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The Boeing 727 they were flying encountered turbulence during a
takeoff, and Molin "stroked the rudder pedals 'one-two-three, about
that fast,' " according to the NTSB report. The effect was to create
sharp, uncomfortable sideways forces on the airplane.</TE>
<TE>   When he challenged Molin, Lavelle said the copilot explained that
he was following training guidance provided by American under an
advanced maneuvering program for pilots. The program itself had been
criticized by industry and government officials for advocating too
much reliance on the rudder. American revised it well before the
Flight 587 crash.</TE>
<TE>   Lavelle said that on two later flights, Molin changed his approach
to wake turbulence. He used the rudder less and relied more on other
controls. However, Molin "was still very quick" with the rudder, the
report stated. On Flight 587, a series of sharp rudder movements
stressed the plane's vertical tail fin beyond its design limits and
caused it to fail.</TE>
<TE>   The back-and-forth actions occurred in just 7.5 seconds. The final
movement generated stresses that exceeded the tail's design limits by
90%, according to Airbus.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators have not confirmed the motions were caused by Molin,
but no mechanical malfunction has been identified that would explain
them.</TE>
<TE>   One theory is that Molin may have thought he overreacted the first
time he moved the rudder to the right. He then went harder in the
opposite direction to correct it but only made matters worse. Airbus
representatives testified that the first rudder move did not generate
stresses above what the tail was designed for. On the second one, the
limit was reached, only to be exceeded on the fourth and fifth.
That's when the tail broke.</TE>
<TE>   The possibility that a pilot can break a plane's tail has come as
a shock to the industry. Pilots traditionally are trained to make
full use of any control at normal flying speeds without harming the
aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   The cockpit voice recorder showed that States did not question or
object to Molin's actions in the few seconds they had to try to save
Flight 587.</TE>
<TE>   The new understanding about tail fins' vulnerability has spurred a
debate about strengthening federal safety standards for them. "How do
we allow the certification of a plane that can be destroyed by the
simple application of the controls?" said NTSB board member John
Goglia.</TE>
<TE>   Federal investigators are also trying to determine whether the
sensitivity of the A300 rudder controls may have been a factor in the
crash.</TE>
<TE>   Mayer, Molin's colleague, said pilots received no warning that
aggressive rudder use could have catastrophic results at normal
speeds.</TE>
<TE>   "All aircraft accidents are learning experiences," Mayer said.
"That's how this business works. You unfortunately learn from the
blood of others. My own opinion is let's not make the pilot a
scapegoat for doing what he was trained to do."</TE>

<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Health officials at the Grand Canyon say they're figuring out ways to
prevent outbreaks of a flu-like virus that affected dozens of hikers
and rafters this summer.</LD>
<LD>   A report released this week reveals that water from a sewage
treatment plant at Glen Canyon Dam has tested positive for the
Norwalk disease. The virus was also found downstream in the Lees
Ferry area.</LD>
<LD>   National Park Service scientists say they will test further to
determine whether there are other sources of the virus along the
Colorado River.</LD>
<TE>   Chuck Higgins, a regional public health specialist with the park
service, says researchers are certain the virus is spreading through
river water. "It's very important because the main angles we try to
use to prevent any illness are the cycles of the illness, and once we
know that, we can break the cycles," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Health officials advise river runners to take extra precautions to
purify water. The Bureau of Reclamation is examining how the Glen
Canyon plant treats wastewater before it's discharged into the
Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Since May, more than 130 Grand Canyon hikers and rafters have come
down with the disease, which causes vomiting and diarrhea and lasts a
day or two.</TE>
<TE>   Still, a Grand Canyon rafting spokesman said the outbreaks have
never posed a threat to the local industry, which serves thousands of
customers each summer. "It's not fun to be sick, but in terms of the
industry, it wasn't that widespread," said Mark Grisham, executive
director of the Grand Canyon River Outfitters Assn. The local
river-running season usually runs from April until mid-October.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the industry will soon learn more about disease
prevention. Higgins is set to address about 200 guides at the annual
meeting of the Grand Canyon River Guides association this weekend in
Flagstaff.</TE>
<TE>   The close person-to-person contact of rafting trips makes it easy
for the disease to spread. Water-filtration and food-handling methods
can be tightened to reduce the spread of germs, Higgins said.</TE>
<TE>   Higgins also discussed his findings with the Bureau of
Reclamation, which operates Glen Canyon Dam. Bureau spokesman Barry
Wirth says the agency wants to see more data on possible virus
sources before making any major changes.</TE>
<TE>   "Our commitment is to participate with the park service and
everyone else involved to do the study work and take a look at how we
may alter our practices in the plant to reduce ... Norwalk," Wirth
said. "Right now, our plant meets all the standards for sewage
plants, but what we are hearing is that Norwalk may take more."</TE>
<TE>   Wirth said the plant at the northeastern end of the canyon uses
ultraviolet light to treat sewage. The facility handles a relatively
small amount of wastewater, mostly from bathrooms on the dam and its
power plant, Wirth said.</TE>
<TE>   Higgins said further research may reveal that Norwalk requires
treatment more advanced than what is called for by current standards.
And that could have national implications.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be surviving standard sewage-treatment processes,"
Higgins said. "If so, that would have larger implications that the
[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and [the Environmental
Protection Agency] would have interest in."</TE>

<DL>NASHVILLE</DL>
<LD>Agents with a terrorism task force raided the homes of at least two
Iraqi immigrants Thursday, and authorities said other searches were
being conducted in the city.</LD>
<LD>   No immediate arrests were made, but FBI, Customs and IRS agents
spent about three hours at the home of Fadhil Abbas Al-Sahaf, 34.
They were seen leaving with boxes, plastic bags, papers, envelopes,
FedEx packages and videotapes. A travel trailer in the backyard also
was searched.</LD>
<LD>   Agents also searched an apartment less than two miles away rented
by Mahdi Al-Tamimi, his wife and young son. Bank documents, IRS forms
and other papers were removed.</LD>
<TE>   Douglas Riggin, an FBI agent in charge of the task force, said the
moves were not connected to "any terrorist act which might pose a
threat to the city."</TE>
<TE>   As for whether they were related to terrorist threats elsewhere,
he said: "The task force investigated it. Draw your own conclusions."</TE>
<TE>   Al-Sahaf said he was not sure why the house was searched, but "I
think it is because I sent money to my family."</TE>
<TE>   He said he is an Iraqi native who moved to the U.S. in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   He said that he had not been questioned by any agency and that he
was not home when agents came because he was undergoing knee surgery.
His wife was home, but Al-Sahaf said she doesn't speak much English.</TE>
<TE>   Riggin would not say where the other searches took place.</TE>

<HD>Military Used Deadly Gas in 1967 Tests</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The U.S. military in 1967 conducted tests using the deadly sarin
nerve agent in a Hawaiian rain forest as part of a Cold War series of
chemical and biological experiments on land and sea, the Pentagon
said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Military units involved in the Hawaii test, dubbed "Red Oak, Phase
1," were not identified, and there was no indication of harm to
troops or civilians from explosions to determine the effectiveness of
artillery shells using sarin in the jungle.</LD>
<LD>   But the Defense Department, releasing five new reports on tests
conducted in the 1960s and '70s, urged any troops involved who might
have suffered ill effects to contact the Pentagon.</LD>
<TE>   The Red Oak tests in April and May 1967 were conducted in both the
Upper Waiakea Forest Reserve on Hawaii and near Fort Sherman in the
Panama Canal Zone. The Panama phase used only a simulated nerve
agent, not sarin.</TE>
<TE>   Sarin is a volatile, deadly nerve agent that can be inhaled or
absorbed through the eyes and skin. A sufficient dose will, within
minutes, cause difficult breathing, a runny nose, confusion and
dimming vision, then coma and death. Very little information is
available on the long-term effects of low-level exposure to sarin.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon on Thursday also released details on four other tests
-- three in the Panama Canal Zone and a fourth in an unspecified
jungle environment -- but said none used deadly chemical or
biological agents.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the riot-control agent tear gas, however, some of
the tests used normally occurring bacteria that more recent
information has indicated can cause acute infections.</TE>
<TE>   More than 5,500 members of the U.S. armed forces were involved,
including 5,000 who took part in ship-board experiments in the
Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   More than 50 veterans have filed claims related to symptoms they
associate with exposure to the tests, according to the Department of
Veterans Affairs.</TE>

<HD>Published Papers of Discredited Scientist Withdrawn</HD>
<DH>He's found to have falsified data, leading coauthors to
push for Science retractions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In the largest block retraction ever published in the journal
Science, eight papers by J. Hendrik Schon, the discredited
researcher, are being withdrawn at the request of his coauthors.</LD>
<LD>   Schon, 32, was a science superstar at Lucent Technologies' Bell
Labs. He published more than 80 papers in top journals, such as
Science and Nature, and was sought out by other researchers because
of his reputation for spectacular results with difficult problems in
material sciences and electronics.</LD>
<LD>   But when his work was questioned by other scientists last spring,
an outside investigating committee appointed by Bell Labs concluded
that Schon had fabricated information or altered experimental results
in at least 16 projects from 1998 to 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Schon, the committee found, "did this intentionally or recklessly
and without the knowledge of any of his co-authors."</TE>
<TE>   At least eight of Schon's research reports were published in
Science and coauthors on the studies announced in this week's issue
of the journal that they were retracting all of the papers.</TE>
<TE>   "As a result of the committee's findings, we feel obligated to the
scientific community to issue a retraction of the ... articles," the
coauthors announced.</TE>
<TE>   The articles dealt with exotic electronic experiments involving
such things as organic molecular semiconductors, lasers and high
temperature superconductivity.</TE>
<TE>   Robert C. Haddon, a professor of chemistry and chemical and
environmental engineering at UC Riverside, said he agreed to become a
coauthor on one paper after Schon claimed success in a
superconductivity experiment that Haddon originated.</TE>
<TE>   "There was an experiment I tried myself in 1996 and I couldn't get
it to work," said Haddon. "I heard about Hendrik's devices that
seemed to work better so I suggested the experiment to him. Six weeks
later, he sent me an e-mail and said he got it to work."</TE>
<TE>   After Schon sent him data that seemed to show success in the
experiment, "I agreed to be a coauthor," said Haddon.</TE>
<TE>   But after the committee investigation showed Schon's data was
suspect, Haddon said he had no choice but to retract the paper.</TE>
<TE>   "This data [in the paper] cannot be trusted," said Haddon. "While
some of it may be correct, one can't be sure."</TE>
<TE>   Haddon said that when researchers combine their studies to produce
a single paper, each scientist depends upon the honesty of work
contributed by the other coauthors.</TE>
<TE>   That, Haddon said, is the way science is supposed to work.</TE>
<TE>   As the result of the questioned work, Bell Labs announced last
month that it was withdrawing six patent applications that had been
based on Schon's research. Schon has made no public comment on the
matter.</TE>
<TE>   Bill O'Shea, president of Bell Labs, said in a statement that the
Schon investigation uncovered the first case of scientific misconduct
in the 77-year history of the famed research organization.</TE>
<TE>   The lab, which until 1996 was part of AT&amp;T, has generated more
than 28,000 patents in communications and electronics and was the
research home of six Nobel Prize winners in physics.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The government will begin rating child safety seats so parents know
which models are easiest to properly install and use.</LD>
<LD>   Ratings made available next year will grade seats on five factors:
whether the seat requires assembly; clarity of the labels attached to
the seat; clarity of written instructions; ease of installation; and
ease of correctly securing a child into the seat.</LD>
<LD>   The information will be available at www.nhtsa.dot.gov -- the Web
site of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration -- and in
a brochure people can request from the agency.</LD>
<TE>   The agency also said Thursday that it will begin a pilot program
to evaluate how well different vehicles and car seats protect
children in a crash.</TE>
<TE>   The agency says 80% of car seats are incorrectly installed,
leading to the deaths of 68 children and injuries to 874 others each
year.</TE>

<HD>Sniper Suspects Linked to Fatal Shooting of Louisiana Woman</HD>
<DH>Warrant issued after weapon used in the Washington area is
tied to Baton Rouge case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ralph Vartabedian</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The fatal shooting of a store manager in Louisiana was linked
Thursday by police to a weapon allegedly used by John Allen Muhammad
and Lee Boyd Malvo in a string of sniper attacks in the Washington
area.</LD>
<LD>   Baton Rouge authorities issued an arrest warrant for Muhammad and
Malvo in the death of Hong Im Ballenger, the manager of a beauty
supply store who was shot while closing up on the evening of Sept.
23.</LD>
<LD>   Police said Ballenger, a mother of three, was robbed in the
shooting, although they did not indicate how much money was taken.
Ballenger's husband later said in interviews that she would have been
carrying as much as $1,500 in store receipts as she closed up for the
day.</LD>
<TE>   Witnesses filed a description of a small, black male that matched
Malvo, said Police Chief Pat Englade. Witnesses said the man fled the
scene and disappeared into a park.</TE>
<TE>   Englade said Baton Rouge police have not ruled out "the
possibility that other individuals may be involved or that the
individuals currently in custody may have committed other criminal
acts."</TE>
<TE>   Ballenger's slaying is the 12th that authorities have linked to
Muhammad and Malvo in four states and the District of Columbia since
September. The pair allegedly wounded an additional four individuals.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft said Thursday that the federal
investigation "continues to span into new jurisdictions across the
country" and that federal agents will "follow leads in an effort to
determine the full extent of criminal activity."</TE>
<TE>   Ballistic tests linked the Bushmaster rifle used in the
Washington-area attacks to the Baton Rouge shooting, Englade said.
Police there are continuing to investigate whether other shootings or
crimes in the area might be linked to Muhammad and Malvo.</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad, who grew up in the Baton Rouge area and still has
relatives there, visited the area last summer, authorities have said.</TE>
<TE>   Only two days before the Baton Rouge shooting, the pair allegedly
shot and killed a liquor store clerk and wounded another in
Montgomery, Ala.</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery police said Thursday that those shootings now have been
linked with ballistic evidence to the Washington cases. And police
are raising the possibility that a third individual may have been
involved in that attack, although they do not appear to have any
evidence as yet.</TE>
<TE>   The Washington-area sniper attacks began Oct. 2 with a shot taken
through the window of a store that did not strike anybody. Muhammad
purchased the 1990 Chevrolet Caprice allegedly used in the killing
spree in Newark, N.J., on Sept. 10.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Thursday, prosecutors in Prince George's County, Md.,
charged Muhammad and Malvo with attempted murder and conspiracy to
commit murder in the shooting of a 13-year-old boy as he entered a
middle school in Bowie. The boy, who has not been identified, remains
in the hospital.</TE>

<HD>Sniper Attacks Reveal New Vulnerability</HD>
<DH>The shootings provided a powerful lesson to international
terrorist groups, experts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ralph Vartabedian</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- The sniper shootings around Washington in the last
month were unsophisticated, low budget and left the public paralyzed
with fear, all of which provided a powerful lesson to international
terrorist organizations, according to law-enforcement officials and
terrorism experts.</LD>
<LD>   Although the shootings did not fit the typical high-profile attack
on a big target, they were equally effective in creating mass fear
and having a large-scale effect on the public, thereby demonstrating
a new vulnerability in U.S. society, experts say.</LD>
<LD>   This concern is one of the reasons why the federal government is
moving so forcefully in filing charges against John Allen Muhammad
and Lee Boyd Malvo, who by all appearances are not international
terrorists but rather accused murderers who do not normally merit
federal prosecution.</LD>
<TE>   A Justice Department official said the federal charges filed
against Muhammad and Malvo this week send a clear message that
federal law-enforcement officials regard their methods as a serious
threat to public safety and that they will receive the close
attention of top officials.</TE>
<TE>   "It is something we have been aware of since 9/11, that the
problem is not just a big attack from a car bomb or a suicide
mission, but it could be, God forbid, a sniper," the official said.
"There is federal interest in this case on those grounds."</TE>
<TE>   In commenting on the case this week, Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft used
strong terms to condemn the attacks, calling them "atrocities" and
saying that the death penalty should be available in trying the
murders. In his brief remarks, Ashcroft repeatedly cited the need for
additional investigation and analysis, indicating that an
understanding of the crime was far from complete.</TE>
<TE>   FBI officials acknowledge that they have been preparing for
terrorist snipers, although they have no direct evidence that any
international organization is gearing up for such an attack.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, it is a possibility," said one FBI official. "If you
look at Al Qaeda's training manuals, there is mention of sniper
training at their camps. But I am not aware of any evidence that
there is an effort to insert snipers into the U.S. to do what this
guy [Muhammad] did."</TE>
<TE>   Exactly what federal, state or local officials could do to counter
a well-organized and sophisticated sniper or group of snipers is
unclear. Muhammad and Malvo allegedly killed 10 and wounded three
others in Washington-area attacks in less than three weeks, leaving
police stumped until they received an extortion note with some clues.</TE>
<TE>   The suicide missions on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center
led to logical and fairly prompt changes to cockpit doors aboard
jetliners and security inside airports to prevent further
occurrences. But random sniper shootings could be more difficult to
prevent, federal officials acknowledge.</TE>
<TE>   "What do you do from an infrastructure point to prevent this, put
up a camera on every street corner?" the FBI official asked.</TE>
<TE>   "We are scratching our heads," admitted the Justice Department
official.</TE>
<TE>   Terrorism experts say sniper attacks have raised the stakes for
the public and the police. Laurie Levenson, a former federal
prosecutor who now teaches at Loyola Law School, said the sniper
attack created widespread terror and left police looking powerless.</TE>
<TE>   "It did have the same grip on the nation that a wider-scale attack
has, and terrorists see that it works -- that it does create terror,"
she said. "It was so random, and the authorities seemed so powerless,
which is what feeds terrorism. Now that we know what Muhammad was, we
should be even more alarmed, because he was not particularly
well-prepared or organized."</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad was scrutinized by police at least 10 times while
apparently living in his 12-year-old Chevrolet Caprice with Malvo, an
undocumented 17-year-old from Jamaica.</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad had been the subject of a prior restraining order --
investigated in the kidnapping of his children in Washington state --
and often seemed to arouse suspicion.</TE>
<TE>   The shootings further blur the distinction between routine crime
and terrorism, just as the July 4 shootings at Los Angeles
International Airport by Hesham Mohamed Hadayet broadened the
definition of terrorism, said Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at
the Rand Corp. think tank in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   "Terrorists watch our society and attempt to find vulnerabilities
and pressure points," Hoffman said.</TE>
<TE>   "They derived an enormously important lesson about terrorizing
millions of Americans. Clearly, it has to be the operating assumption
that we have a new vulnerability."</TE>
<TE>   It became clear from the outset of the shootings that federal,
state and local law-enforcement authorities were not treating this as
a routine crime spree, but rather as a significant public safety risk
that required a massive response.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
assigned more than 1,000 agents to the case. State and local
authorities committed two to three times that number. And the pace of
the investigation continues to be rapid, with the pair accused
Thursday in a Baton Rouge, La., slaying.</TE>
<TE>   Even though it was not considered a case of international
terrorism, the difficulty of solving the crimes bore many
similarities to traditional anti-terrorism, Hoffman said.</TE>
<TE>   The Sept. 11, 2001, attacks disclosed serious breakdowns in
communications within the large community of law enforcement,
immigration, airport security and intelligence agencies.</TE>
<TE>   In the sniper shootings, the early inability of police to crack
the case reflected the same type of problems with communication and
coordination, not necessarily a lack of clues.</TE>
<TE>   Ballistic evidence from Alabama, Washington state, Virginia and
Maryland did not come together. Valid witness reports were filed
away. Police repeatedly stopped Muhammad, but the stops were never
assembled to show a pattern.</TE>
<TE>   "The information was all there; the problem was bringing it
together," Hoffman said.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Benjamin, author of a new book on terrorism and an expert at
the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said authorities
should be worried about copycat attacks, just as such fears surfaced
after the Sept. 11 acts.</TE>
<TE>   But Benjamin said he believes terrorists will remain focused on
"mass casualty attacks" that enable them to claim credit and promote
their cause, rather than frequent smaller-scale strikes.</TE>

<HD>After Last Year's Drought, Snow's a Welcome Sight at Ski
Resort</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>What a difference a year makes: The Wolf Creek Ski Resort opened
Thursday with a 50-inch base on top.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, as a record drought took hold, Wolf Creek opened Nov.
22 with 4 inches of snow on top. It usually gets the deepest snowfall
of all Colorado resorts.</LD>
<LD>   Although it doesn't mean the drought is over, or even subsiding
yet, the precipitation recorded at several Colorado major river
basins was near or above the 30-year average.</LD>
<TE>   "We are excited because we are opening a week before we are
scheduled," said Melissa Arnold, spokeswoman for the resort.</TE>
<TE>   Wolf Creek has already received 73 inches of snow, compared with
238 last year. Its average is 465 inches.</TE>
<TE>   The National Oceanic and Atmosphere Administration has forecast
that El Nino could mean more snowfall than usual in southern Colorado
and other Southwestern areas. The effects of the phenomenon decline
farther north.</TE>

<HD>For Whales' Sake, Judge Halts Sonar</HD>
<DH>Navy's worldwide use of powerful new system is banned until
military and environmentalists agree on where it's not likely to hurt
animals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth R. Weiss</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge Thursday prohibited the U.S. Navy from combing the
world's oceans with a powerful new sonar, ruling that the booming
sounds meant to detect enemy submarines could cause irreparable harm
to whales.</LD>
<LD>   The temporary injunction bans a type of low-frequency sonar that
has not been conclusively linked to marine mammal mortality.</LD>
<LD>   Although the ruling could allow the Navy to resume using the sonar
in some places, U.S. Magistrate Elizabeth D. LaPorte imposed a
worldwide ban until Navy brass and environmental experts can agree on
a list of spots where sailors can deploy the sonar without harming
marine life.</LD>
<TE>   In her 58-page opinion, the judge, who is based in San Francisco,
agreed with the Navy that even a temporary peacetime ban on the
low-frequency sonar system could hamper military preparedness.</TE>
<TE>   She gave the Navy and environmental groups that filed the lawsuit
until Nov. 7 to report back to her with an interim solution.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy and federal marine fisheries officials declined immediate
comment.</TE>
<TE>   But environmental groups were elated by the preliminary
injunction. They had sued to overturn a Bush administration decision
in July that gave the Navy permission to "harass" or injure whales in
training missions using the sonar designed to search for super-quiet
diesel submarines.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no justification for giving the Navy a blank check to
operate this sonar in 75% of the world's oceans," said Joel Reynolds,
an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council. If allowed to
continue, he said, the sonar system would have "threatened marine
life on a staggering and unprecedented geographic scale."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's ruling is the latest legal victory for environmental
groups trying to rein in powerful sonar and other loud sounds that
science is increasingly linking to deaths and injuries of marine
mammals.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration is pushing to exempt military activities
from a variety of environmental constraints. In September, a federal
judge rejected arguments that sonar use in the deep ocean was exempt
from the National Environmental Policy Act.</TE>
<TE>   In early 2000, 16 beaked whales beached themselves in the Bahamas
in a mass stranding that the Navy and other authorities have linked
to bursts of midfrequency sonar. A similar mass die-off of whales
occurred in September in the Canary Islands, following naval
operations by warships from the United States and nearly a dozen NATO
allies.</TE>
<TE>   "From a scientific point of view, there is very little question
that, given the right set of circumstances, active sonar can kill
marine life," said Naomi Rose, a marine mammal scientist with the
U.S. Humane Society.</TE>
<TE>   Yet military officials point out that naval operations in the
Bahamas and Canary Islands were not using the new surveillance towed
array sonar system banned Thursday. That system broadcasts
low-frequency sonic waves through 18 speakers dangled behind a ship
on cables hundreds of feet long.</TE>
<TE>   Such active sonar emits 215-decibel bursts of low-frequency waves
that can "light up" enemy submarines with acoustics, much the way a
floodlight can light up an intruder in a darkened backyard. These
intense waves travel 300 miles through the ocean before dissipating,
and so are much more effective at spotting submarines than passive
listening devices.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists argue that the frequency of the sonic waves
matters less than their intensity, and that the low-frequency system
spreads intensely loud sound farther than any other sonar.</TE>
<TE>   The National Marine Fisheries Service decided in July that the
sonar would have "negligible impact" on any marine species so long as
it operated at least 12 miles from shore and was immediately shut
down if sailors spotted any whales.</TE>
<TE>   In permitting the sonar, the National Marine Fisheries Service
granted the Navy an exemption from the Marine Mammal Protection Act
to harass or injure up to 12% of any species of whales, dolphins or
other marine mammals.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists quickly sued, alleging that the federal
government violated a number of federal laws designed to protect
whales and endangered species.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday, Judge LaPorte wrote that environmentalists were likely
to win their lawsuit. She found persuasive the environmentalist
argument that the fishery service's permission to harass up to 12% of
marine mammals exceeds the "small numbers" allowed for harassment,
injury or death under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.</TE>
<TE>   The environmental groups were likely to prevail on their claim
that the federal government failed to consider reasonable
alternatives to a worldwide sonar deployment, she wrote. Federal
officials also failed to set off-limits places in the ocean where
marine mammals and endangered species are known to be particularly
abundant, her ruling said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is undisputed that marine mammals, many of whom depend on
sensitive hearing for essential activities like finding food and
mates and avoiding predators, and some of whom are endangered
species, will at a minimum be harassed by the extremely loud and far
traveling [low-frequency] sonar," LaPorte wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The judge said she intends to modify her injunction to balance the
public interest in "the survival and flourishing of marine mammals
and endangered species," with "ensuring military preparedness and
safety of those serving in the military from attacks by hostile
submarines."</TE>
<TE>   To achieve that balance, she ordered the Navy to meet with
environmentalists and work out specific places acceptable to both
sides.</TE>
<TE>   A modified injunction, she wrote, "should be carefully tailored to
reduce the risk to marine mammals and endangered species by
restricting the sonar's use in additional areas that are particularly
rich in marine life, while still allowing the Navy to use this
technology for testing and training in a variety of oceanic
conditions."</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit focuses only on peacetime training and testing of the
sonar, the judge noted. Neither the injunction, nor any final ruling,
will interfere with the Navy's use of low-frequency active sonar in
times of war or "declared heightened threat."</TE>
<TE>   Reynolds, the Natural Resources Defense Council attorney, said
environmentalists will be happy to help locate places away from whale
feeding, breeding and migration corridors. The lawsuit was joined by
the Humane Society, the League for Coastal Protection, the Cetacean
Society International and Jean-Michel Cousteau's Ocean Futures
Society.</TE>
<TE>   The National Marine Fisheries Service, which was sued along with
the Navy, declined to comment. "This is between the Navy and the
groups that filed the lawsuit," said Connie Barclay, an agency
spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Cmdr. Pauline Storum said the Navy will have nothing to say
until its attorneys have analyzed the ruling. "We are still reviewing
the decision," she said.</TE>
