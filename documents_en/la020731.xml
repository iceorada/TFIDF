<LD>Though Pomona's farmers market has grown smaller in recent years, it
still lures shoppers who bypass newer competitors for the appeal of
an old-style market. You'll find the basics here, fresh fruits and
vegetables at reasonable prices--not the flood of crafts booths and
prepared-food stands at so many other places.</LD>
<LD>   As an added bonus, the market has a spacious, open layout and
convenient parking. A Claremont shopper said she drives to Pomona for
better prices from the market's growers, many of whom run small farms
or even pack up what's thriving in their gardens.</LD>
<LD>   Tony Kang carted in tubs of cherry tomatoes and yellow tomatoes
from his Chino backyard to sell Saturday at his first farmers market.
He also had grooved, warty Chinese cucumbers, which are crunchy and
have a rich, earthy flavor.</LD>
<TE>   A small but interesting stand is the one from Cal Poly Pomona,
which has thin-skinned Japanese cucumbers, zucchini, tomatoes and
green beans. They're grown by the college's students on the campus
farm in town.</TE>
<TE>   Hot peppers, now approaching peak season, are popular with the
market's largely Latino customers, and Miguel Cervantes of Santa Ana
has five kinds, including serrano, jalapeno and pasilla, as well as
plump red, yellow and green bell peppers.</TE>
<TE>   The Laganza Farm of Aguanga provides an upscale touch with its
small but intriguing display of organic heirloom and specialty
vegetables. Customers marvel at the 2-foot-long, striped, curled
Armenian cucumbers (aka snake melons) with a mild, slightly citric
taste. The stand also has sweet Zephyr squash, a distinctive green
and yellow hybrid of crookneck, delicata and acorn squashes.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Eakin of Riverside, whose father was one of the market's
first vendors when it began in the early 1980s, carries superbly
sweet and juicy Valencia oranges.</TE>
<TE>   From Hinkley, near Barstow, Angelo and Adelina Filandrianos bring
Sangria watermelons, cantaloupes and Canary melons, along with sweet
Flame grapes, much smaller than commercial specimens. That's because
they haven't been sprayed with the standard plant-growth regulator to
increase size.</TE>
<TE>   For the best stone fruit in the market, try the lusciously ripe
and peachy Early Elbertas grown in Lancaster by Robert Wayman, a
Baptist minister, and his wife, Doris.</TE>

<HD>After the Deluge? If It's Oregon, Pinot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID SHAW</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was Benjamin Franklin who said that rain, "which descends from the
Heavens upon our vineyards [is] ... a constant proof that God loves
us and loves to see us happy."</LD>
<LD>   If Franklin was right--and how can you doubt a man who tied a key
to a kite string, flew the kite in a thunderstorm and lived to talk
about it--Oregon must truly be God's country, and Oregonians must be
truly happy folks. Oregon has one of the country's heaviest annual
rainfalls and--partially as a result--produces some of the country's
finest wines.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, rain is the protagonist, both the hero and--lurking in the
background, ever-present--the potential villain in a new, 30-minute
television documentary, "Life in Vine: A Year in the Vineyards." The
film, which will be shown on KCET at 10:30 Monday night, takes
viewers through a full Oregon winemaking season. It begins with the
pruning of the vines in the cold, especially wet winter of 1998-1999
and takes you through the bud breaks and flowering of spring, the
veraison of summer when grapes gradually change from green to red
and--finally, blissfully, ecstatically--the annual miracle of the
fall harvest.</LD>
<TE>   Pinot Noir is the wine for which Oregon is best-known, and "Life
in Vine" shifts easily back and forth among the vineyard workers and
winemakers of half a dozen of the state's Pinot wineries, including
Eyrie Vineyard, whose pioneering proprietor, David Lett, planted the
first Pinot vines in the Willamette Valley more than 30 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The film was written, produced, directed, edited and narrated by
Matt Giraud, a columnist for Fortune and Willamette Week and a
commentator on National Public Radio's "All Things Considered."
Giraud was also the principal cameraman on the film, and his loving
tribute to the Oregon vineyards is lushly photographed amid rolling
green hillsides, fog-shrouded slopes, brooding skies and breathtaking
sunsets.</TE>
<TE>   His simple, lyrical introduction to the world of winemaking is
particularly engaging when the winemakers themselves appear on
screen, talking about their passions and frustrations--and their
conviction that nature itself is the ultimate winemaker, that "Try as
we might, we probably have very little influence" on what ultimately
shows up in the bottle, as one of them says, a bit wistfully.</TE>
<TE>   "Life in Vine" opens with falling rain and an ominous lament: In
1999, winter and springtime wine left the vines two weeks behind
schedule by the end of April. Things didn't get much better in May,
June or July, and given the likelihood of heavy rain in October in
Oregon, "Growers' hopes for a good harvest seemed to be slipping
away," as Giraud says when the rains return in August.</TE>
<TE>   Rain stopped in September, but then winemakers had a new
worry--would the weather stay dry and warm long enough for the sugar
in the grapes to rise and the acid to fall so the grapes would
properly ripen? And would the winemakers themselves have the patience
to wait for that ripening, knowing that they risked both an attack by
birds and the destructive October rains?</TE>
<TE>   The winemakers got lucky. Storm after storm dissipated at sea.
Temperatures were still hovering in the 80s on Oct. 20. Birds did
only minimal damage.</TE>
<TE>   "This is as good as it gets in Oregon weather," one winemaker says
with an obvious sense of both relief and triumph.</TE>
<TE>   Against all odds, the 1999 harvest proved to be outstanding. Both
Robert Parker and the Wine Spectator gave '99 Oregon Pinots 92 points
on their 100-point scales. "Brilliantly flavored, focused wines," the
Spectator said.</TE>
<TE>   How did it happen?</TE>
<TE>   Who knows?</TE>
<TE>   "You have to get into the realm of metaphysics ultimately when you
deal with grapes," says one winemaker in the film. "There are a lot
of things that can't be explained."</TE>
<TE>   So where is Ben Franklin when we really need him?</TE>

<LD>When you get your hands on good peaches or strawberries, it's great
to be able to make a fruit crisp, one of those comfort desserts
everyone enjoys. But you don't have to start a crisp from scratch if
you use this trick: Keep a crisp topping in the freezer.</LD>
<LD>   This topping recipe can be used immediately, stored up to two days
in the refrigerator or frozen for a month. Just be sure to wrap it
airtight in double plastic bags. It's not necessary to thaw the
topping before using. If the topping freezes into a mass, massage the
bag to crumble it.</LD>
<LD>   Here, I've combined two fruits in each crisp recipe, though other
combinations are possible. These take advantage of summer, when
peaches, blueberries and strawberries are readily available. Rhubarb,
though often thought of as a springtime crop, can be found at farmers
markets and grocery stores into fall.</LD>
<TE>   As a thickener, I prefer quick-cooking tapioca to flour or
cornstarch. It thickens the juices without clouding them or
thickening them too much. The juices are always clear, slightly runny
and not at all "pasty."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brown Sugar Crisp Topping</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 10 minutes</TE>
<TE>   1 cup flour</TE>
<TE>   2/3 cup dark brown sugar, packed</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon cinnamon</TE>
<TE>   1/8 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened, cut into 4 pieces</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup pecans</TE>
<TE>   Place the flour, sugar, cinnamon and salt in the bowl of a food
processor. Process quickly to mix, about 2 seconds. Scatter the
butter and pecans over the flour. Pulse the processor on and off
until the mixture is crumbly but not massing together, about 20 to 30
seconds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Strawberry and Rhubarb Crisp</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 30 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour, 50
minutes, plus 1 hour cooling</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 pounds rhubarb, cut into 1/3-inch thick slices (about 5
cups)</TE>
<TE>   2 1/2 pints strawberries, hulled, cut in half or quarters if large
(about 4 1/2 cups)</TE>
<TE>   1 1/4 cups sugar</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon quick-cooking tapioca</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons orange juice</TE>
<TE>   Grated zest from 1 orange</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons vanilla extract</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon ground allspice</TE>
<TE>   Brown Sugar Crisp Topping</TE>
<TE>   Vanilla ice cream, for serving</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Set aside a 13x9-inch baking dish.</TE>
<TE>   Place the rhubarb, strawberries, sugar, tapioca, juice, zest,
vanilla and allspice in the baking dish. Use your hands to toss until
well mixed. Let it rest 20 to 30 minutes, stirring once midway. Be
sure the fruit is evenly spread in the dish. Sprinkle the topping
evenly over the fruit. Place the pan on a large baking sheet or a
large sheet of heavy-duty foil to catch any bubbling juices.</TE>
<TE>   Bake until the top is browned and the juices are bubbling, 65 to
70 minutes. Let cool at least 1 hour before serving. (Alternately,
cool completely. The crisp can be refrigerated overnight, covered
airtight. To serve, let come to room temperature, uncovered. Reheat,
uncovered, in a 350-degree oven until warm, about 12 minutes.) Serve
warm with small scoop of ice cream.</TE>

<TE>   To easily peel peaches, dip them in boiling water to loosen the
skins or use a swivel-bladed vegetable peeler.</TE>
<TE>   9 large firm ripe peaches, (about 4 pounds), peeled, halved and
pitted</TE>
<TE>   2 pints blueberries (4 cups)</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup plus 2 teaspoons sugar (less if fruit is sweet)</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon quick-cooking tapioca</TE>

<TE>   Harvey's Sauce</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 15 minutes, plus 2 weeks
standing</TE>
<TE>   Harvey's is somewhat like Worcestershire but sharper, hotter and
more garlicky. This is Eliza Leslie's 1851 recipe. Some earlier
versions use walnut ketchup in place of Leslie's imported "Indian
soy." Jars of mushroom base can be found in the soup aisle of
well-stocked supermarkets.</TE>
<TE>   6 anchovies</TE>
<TE>   2 cups vinegar</TE>
<TE>   2 heads garlic, broken into cloves</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons soy sauce</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons mushroom base dissolved in 2 tablespoons water</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon cayenne pepper</TE>
<TE>   4 drops red food coloring, optional</TE>
<TE>   Place the anchovies, vinegar and garlic in a blender and blend
until the anchovies are more or less dissolved. Add the soy sauce,
mushroom base mixture, cayenne and food coloring and process until
smooth. Place in a jar. Cover tightly. Let the ingredients infuse for
2 weeks, shaking once a day, then strain and store in a tightly
sealed container.</TE>

<TE>   General Sauce</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 6 hours, 15
minutes</TE>
<TE>   A mild, elegant flavoring for melted butter. Eliza Leslie's recipe
calls for a few somewhat rare ingredients: lemon thyme, peach leaf
(easily replaced by almond extract) and long pepper, which is
available at Ethiopian markets; black pepper can substitute for it.
California Madeira works perfectly well in this sauce.</TE>
<TE>   6 shallots, minced</TE>
<TE>   1 clove garlic, minced</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon almond extract</TE>
<TE>   2 sprigs fresh thyme</TE>
<TE>   2 sprigs fresh basil</TE>
<TE>   Grated zest of 1/4 orange</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon cloves, crushed</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon mace, crushed</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup salt</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup red wine</TE>
<TE>   Juice of 2 lemons</TE>
<TE>   2 cups Madeira</TE>
<TE>   Place the shallots, garlic, almond extract, thyme, basil, zest,
cloves, mace, pepper, salt, wine, lemon juice and Madeira in a slow
cooker. Cook at low setting 6 hours. (Or, pour the sauce into an
ovenproof dish with a tight-fitting lid. Place in a 200-degree oven
for 6 hours.) Strain the sauce, discarding the solids. Store the
sauce in a tightly sealed container.</TE>

<LD>No matter what seasoning formula you like--a Mediterranean
garlic-lemon-olive oil combo with herbs, a teriyaki-style blend of
soy sauce, sake and sugar or an Indian curry-ginger-garlic spice
paste--the scent and flavor chicken gains from grilling makes it a
worldwide favorite.</LD>
<LD>   Chicken isn't tough to barbecue, but these tips produce a better
bird. For juicier meat, leave the skin on to shield the meat from the
searing heat. Brush oily marinades off the chicken and put a drip pan
on the coals underneath whole chickens to catch juices and prevent
flare-ups. Check the chicken frequently; it can scorch quickly. If
its skin starts to char before it's done, lower the heat or move the
chicken to a cooler spot. Barbecue sauces containing sugar, syrup,
fruit juice, tomato or ketchup will burn; brush the sauce on for the
last few minutes.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends cooking whole
chickens and dark meat pieces to 180 degrees and breasts to 170
degrees. Digital thermometers are sensitive even if they enter only a
half-inch of food, but common instant-read dial thermometers need 2
inches; for small pieces of chicken, insert the thermometer sideways.</LD>
<TE>   Seasoned in the Eastern Mediterranean style, this chicken is great
with a chopped salad of tomatoes, cucumbers and green onions and with
rice pilaf topped with toasted pine nuts. You might like to grill
corn, thick onion slices, eggplant wedges, sweet peppers and
firm-ripe tomatoes too; make an extra batch of the marinating mixture
for brushing on the vegetables. They'll be any barbecued chicken's
ideal companions.</TE>

Cookbook," (Warner, 1992).</TE>
<TE>   The time given here is for assorted chicken pieces. Breasts take
about 20 minutes, thighs and drumsticks about 30 to 35 minutes and a
whole chicken about 45 to 60 minutes, but times vary widely.</TE>
<TE>   For outdoor barbecuing I often opt for chicken on the bone, as
it's moister and more flavorful. When I'm in a rush, I cook boneless
chicken on a stove-top grill with the same seasonings.</TE>

<TE>   Grilled Chicken With Coriander and Cumin</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 10 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 45 minutes</TE>
<TE>   2 1/2 to 3 pounds chicken thighs, drumsticks or breast pieces with
skin and bones, or 1 (3 1/2-pound) chicken, giblets removed</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons olive oil</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons minced onion</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons ground coriander</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons ground cumin</TE>
<TE>   1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   Lemon wedges, optional, for serving</TE>
<TE>   Mint sprigs, optional, for garnish</TE>
<TE>   Pat the chicken dry and put it on a plate. Combine the olive oil,
onion, coriander, cumin, cayenne and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a small
bowl. Rub the mixture evenly on all sides of the chicken, and inside
a whole chicken. Let the chicken stand at room temperature to
marinate briefly while you heat the grill; or cover the chicken and
marinate it in the refrigerator for 2 to 4 hours.</TE>
<TE>   If using a charcoal grill, heat the coals until they're covered
with gray ash and have only a hint of red; then move them to the edge
of the grill. Preheat a gas grill for indirect heat according to the
manufacturer's instructions, then reduce the heat to medium (350 to
375 degrees). For a whole chicken, put a drip pan in the grill's
center so it will catch the bird's juices. If the grill grate is
adjustable, set it 6 inches above the coals.</TE>
<TE>   Brush off the excess marinade and bits of onion clinging to the
chicken. Discard any remaining marinade. Sprinkle the chicken with
salt and pepper and set it on the grill. Cover and grill, turning the
chicken over halfway through its estimated cooking time. Check for
doneness: Whole chickens and dark meat pieces should measure 180
degrees at the thigh's thickest part and breast pieces should be 170
degrees. Or, with a thin skewer, pierce the thigh's thickest part
near the bone; the juices running out should be clear, not reddish,
and the meat should no longer be pink, but off-white. Breast meat
should be off-white at its thickest part. To keep the chicken as
succulent as possible, remove it immediately from the grill to a
clean platter</TE>
<TE>   Serve the chicken pieces with lemon wedges and mint sprigs. Let a
whole chicken stand for 10 minutes before carving.</TE>

<LD>It's hard to beat fresh figs served with Camembert, Brie or goat
cheese; the sweetness of the figs marries so well with the creaminess
and saltiness of the cheese. But the calories of this summer pleasure
can be more than you want to think about. That's what inspired this
lighter alternative, one that makes a good appetizer on a warm
evening.</LD>
<LD>   For this simple crostini, puree low-fat cottage cheese until light
and smooth, resulting in an almost fluffy texture. Combined with
minced fresh herbs, the cheese is delicious spread on grilled bread
and topped with a grilled fig half.</LD>
<LD>   I like to cut the figs in half rather than slicing them; the
larger pieces are easier to handle on the grill. The figs will grill
quickly; keep an eye on them. When they become tender and begin to
collapse, promptly remove them from the grill.</LD>

<LD>Fresh tomatoes are so incredible right now, who wants to cook them?</LD>
<LD>   In this easy pasta dish, chunks of red, ripe tomatoes are combined
with fresh basil leaves, olive oil, garlic and diced fresh
mozzarella, then tossed with hot penne. This quick sauce easily beats
one that would simmer for a long time, heating up the kitchen. Only
the pasta needs cooking; start out with the hottest tap water so that
when heated, it quickly comes to a boil.</LD>
<LD>   Because the sauce is a bit garlicky, balance out the meal with a
baguette and a salad tossed with a parsley vinaigrette.</LD>

we're always interested in how somebody else does. I like the style

<HD>A Mystery Begins in the Backyard ...</HD>
<DH>Barbecue sauce, ketchup, steak sauce--where do they come
from?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Firing up my barbecue a few months back, I started wondering about
sauces. Not the respectable French sauces that food writers deal with
all the time--and that nobody ever makes in the backyard, it occurred
to me as I sucked thoughtfully on a beer--but the bottles of steak
and barbecue sauce I had lined up at the ready. Where'd they come
from? What's their story?</LD>
<LD>   French chefs, who base their cooking on cream or reduced meat
juice, have no use for these "violent Anglo-Saxon sauces." The rap
against them is that they make everything taste the same. But come
on, I thought, nobody complains that truffles make everything taste
the same. If you want a particular flavor, that's what you want.
Sometimes it's sauce espagnole, sometimes it's got to be
Worcestershire.</LD>
<LD>   In any case, who uses the same sauce on everything? Who puts
ketchup on ribs and T-bone? That's what barbecue sauce and steak
sauce are for. And the number of barbecue sauces is beyond counting.
In fact, concocting barbecue sauces is one of our most vigorous
culinary activities, right up there with chili-making.</LD>
<TE>   It turns out that bottled sauces have a long, and colorful history
stretching back more than 300 years. The story begins in 17th century
England, when English home cooks were using either melted butter or
plain gravy for all their sauce needs. Over in France, Louis XIV's
chefs had just created an impressive new haute cuisine emphasizing
huge quantities of meat. Many French sauces were now based on an
expensive ham concentrate called coulis.</TE>
<TE>   On returning from exile in 1660, Charles II introduced the latest
French dishes to the English court, but English home cooks refused to
go along with what they called "French extravagance." This might
sound like simple, unimaginative penny-pinching, and probably it was,
at least to start with. But as England grew more prosperous and able
to afford the elaborate French style, English home cooks stubbornly
kept putting gravy or butter on everything, varying them by adding
wine, mushrooms, anchovies, pickles and the like.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the East India Co. was making England a major player in
the Far East. English voyagers found the people of China and
Southeast Asia using their own liquid seasonings, fish sauce and soy
sauce. Like two favorite English sauce additives, mushrooms and
anchovies, both Asian sauces were based on a protein-rich ingredient,
giving them umami, the "tastiness" quality that the Japanese find in
mushrooms, soy products and dried fish.</TE>
<TE>   The English were enthusiastic right from the start. "Suoy is the
choicest of all Sawces," gushed John Ovington in "A Voyage to Suratt
in 1689."</TE>
<TE>   There was already a craze for Indian ingredients in Ovington's
day. Indian mango pickles were so fashionable (and expensive) that
English cooks were making thrifty imitations out of peaches, melons
or cucumbers. In 1699, one writer gave a recipe for a "mango" that
was merely pickled green walnuts: "a more agreeable Mango," John
Evelyn wrote, "than what is brought us from abroad; which you may use
[as a flavoring] in any Sauce, and is of it self a rich Condiment."</TE>
<TE>   Once the English started importing ketchup and soy sauce, they
naturally started imitating them too. But they were a little vague
about what these sauces were, and none of their 18th century
"ketchups" or "soys" tastes much like the real thing to us.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, it's hard to say what they thought the difference was
between soy and ketchup. In their defense, there was also confusion
in the Far East. In Malaysia, where the English first encountered it,
kecap originally meant a Southeast Asian fish sauce like the Thai nam
pla or the Vietnamese nuoc mam, but today kecap means soy sauce
there.</TE>
<TE>   You might expect English cooks to make their ketchup from
anchovies, which have the same salted-fish flavor as nam pla. They
did make some anchovy ketchup, but from the start their favorite
ketchup was extracted from salted mushrooms. Probably they were
really trying to duplicate soy sauce--by mixing chopped mushrooms
with salt and leaving them overnight, they made sure the juices would
oxidize and turn brown. The second most popular kind, pickled walnut
"ketchup" (pretty close to what John Evelyn had been calling a mango
in 1699), had an even darker and more soy-like color.</TE>
<TE>   The basic ketchup idea was the brine from pickling something,
flavored with various spices, usually including cloves and mace.
These imitation ketchups were handy not only for the home cook, but
for the traveler who faced boring food in small-town inns, to say
nothing of tedious ship's rations on long ocean trips. They spread
quickly throughout the English-speaking world and even beyond. By the
19th century, Russian housewives were making their own "mushroom soy"
(soya iz shampinyonov).</TE>
<TE>   Doctoring the Sauce</TE>
<TE>   Once you had a couple of ketchups on hand, you could make all
sorts of compound sauces by doctoring them with wine, vinegar, herbs
and spices. (If you left the ketchups out and just mixed wine with
herbs and spices, you had what was called traveling sauce, because it
kept so well on journeys.) The result was an explosion of bottled
sauces, much like today's profusion of barbecue sauces. "By the
mid-nineteenth century," wrote the English food writer Elizabeth
David, "hundreds of British families must have had their own--or what
they thought was their own--formula for some such sauce."</TE>
<TE>   Sauces of this sort were made commercially starting in the 1760s.
One of the first big sellers was Harvey's Sauce, a mixture of wine,
anchovies and both mushroom and walnut ketchups. It had been created
by a London innkeeper named Peter Harvey, whose sister, Elizabeth
Lazenby, sold her own sauce, Lazenby's Anchovy Essence. Eventually
there were hundreds of sauces on the market, the most durable being
Worcestershire (1838), which mixes anchovies with tamarind, vinegar
and some real, Chinese-type soy sauce.</TE>
<TE>   "The usual way of eating these sauces," explained Eliza Leslie in
her "Directions for Cookery" (1837), "is to pour a little on your
plate, and mix it with the melted butter. They give flavour to fish
that would otherwise be insipid, and are in general use at genteel
tables.... They are in great variety, and may be purchased of the
grocers that sell oil, pickles, anchovies, &amp;c."</TE>
<TE>   They were brought to the table in cruets or special little bottles
called casters. The cult of bottled sauces is behind a lot of
puzzling Victorian antiques: the silver-plated stands that held sauce
cruets, the picnic baskets fitted with bottle-sized compartments, the
silver labels engraved with the words "Harvey's" or "Quin's" or
"Tapp's," which were hung around the necks of cut-glass sauce
flagons.</TE>
<TE>   The next fateful step in sauce evolution was the invention of
tomato ketchup, some time before 1800. It answered a pressing
question: What do you do with your tomato crop? Even today's
half-ripe supermarket tomatoes are notoriously perishable, and
something really had to be done when the kitchen garden was
overflowing with ripe tomatoes. The solution was to boil down tomato
juice with salt and spices, and bottle the concentrated result with
vinegar as a preservative. Not surprisingly, it quickly became the
favorite ketchup in this country, though mushroom ketchup remained
common until around 1900.</TE>
<TE>   This original tomato ketchup was not sweetened, and it wasn't
meant to be used by itself. You added it to butter or gravy in the
usual way, creating a spicy instant tomato sauce. As Andrew F. Smith
tells in "Pure Ketchup: A History of America's National Condiment,"
it wasn't until 1876 that sugar became a regular ingredient in tomato
ketchup. Eventually, as we know, Americans started using ketchup by
itself with no idea of doctoring gravy or melted butter.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of tomato ketchup soon reached England, and there is an
English recipe dating from 1816. It includes anchovies for a more
traditional ketchup flavor. When some Americans tried to market
tomato ketchup in England in 1837, they were told they'd have to call
it tomato chutney, possibly because English customers would expect to
taste anchovies in it.</TE>
<TE>   At any rate, anchovy-less tomato ketchup established itself in
England during the 1840s. And then came an unexpected consequence. To
compete with tomato ketchup, English sauce manufacturers devised what
we now call steak sauces and what the English call brown sauces. They
contain the sort of flavorings that went into the older
ketchups--vinegar, garlic, onions, sweet spices, cayenne, sometimes
even anchovies--plus tomatoes and typically a fruit such as raisins
or dates.</TE>
<TE>   Could This Be the Source?</TE>
<TE>   So there's the twisted family tree of steak sauce, winding its way
back to the 18th-century English attempt to duplicate Asian sauces.
But there may be another line of descent as well.</TE>
<TE>   Harvey's Sauce was essential for a popular 18th and 19th century
dish called deviled bones, which was made by coating leftover beef or
chicken bones with devil sauce and roasting them brown, making
something enjoyable to gnaw. There were several kinds of devil sauce,
including brown devil (a paste of butter, flour, mustard, chutney and
Harvey's) and white devil (cream, mustard, mushroom ketchup and
Harvey's). Eventually, Worcestershire sauce replaced Harvey's in
devil sauces.</TE>
<TE>   Now, what if tomato ketchup invaded the devil sauce recipe, the
way it invaded traditional English ketchups to give birth to steak
sauce? That could be the source, or one of the sources, of American
barbecue sauce.</TE>
<TE>   Think about it. Like devil sauce, a lot of old-time barbecue
sauces contain mustard. Even today, a lot of barbecue sauces have
Worcestershire in them. The later development of barbecue sauce would
reflect our raging national sweet tooth and taste for hot peppers.</TE>
<TE>   So welcome to the reunion, soy sauce, fish sauce, Worcestershire
sauce, tomato ketchup, A-1 sauce--and probably you, too,
Memphis-style barbecue sauce. You're all part of the same family,
apparently. One thing's clear, at any rate: None of you is French.</TE>

<LD>OLD-WORLD KETCHUPS</LD>
<LD>   In the 18th century, the English began making a variety of sauces
called ketchups. They usually began with the brine from pickling
something, flavored with various spices, usually including cloves and
mace.</LD>
<LD>   Mushroom ketchup: made by salting a tubful of sliced mushrooms,
letting them sit for a day or so, squeezing out their juice and
boiling it down with spices. For an idea of its flavor, dilute 4
teaspoons bottled mushroom stock base with a cup of water and boil it
awhile with cloves, mace and pepper.</LD>
<TE>   Walnut ketchup: the blackish juice of pickled walnuts, which are
made by steeping soft young walnuts with spices, salt and vinegar for
a couple of weeks. Walnut ketchup is still made in England and tastes
a bit like Worcestershire sauce.</TE>
<TE>   Anchovy ketchup: anchovies steeped with wine, vinegar, shallots
and spices.</TE>
<TE>   Oyster ketchup: the juice of fresh oysters, boiled, mixed with a
preservative (vinegar, wine or brandy) and bottled. The result is
something like bottled clam juice, but sharp and salty and flavored
with sweet spices.</TE>
<TE>   NEW-WORLD KETCHUPS</TE>
<TE>   American cooks devised many ketchups on their own. In the late
19th century, there was a fad for boiling all sorts of fruits with
vinegar, sugar and spices to make "ketchups" that were more like
sweet pickles or relishes than the older ketchups.</TE>
<TE>   Tomato ketchup: The modern ketchup and, by the 1850s, already the
favorite American ketchup. Tomatoes are boiled until thick, then
flavored with salt, vinegar and spices (often cayenne and mustard as
well as the usual cloves and mace). Originally, it was not a sweet
sauce for use by itself but a tart, salty tomato essence for
flavoring gravy or butter.</TE>
<TE>   Lemon ketchup, also called lemon pickle: lemon juice and vinegar
infused with sweet spices and horseradish, for use on fish.</TE>
<TE>   Cucumber ketchup: grated cucumbers (sometimes mixed with grated
onions) pickled in vinegar.</TE>

<HD>A Colossal Catch</HD>
<DH>This big, sweet shrimp from Santa Barbara is a chef's
dream. And its peak season is now.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J. MICHAEL KENNEDY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They are huge, these Santa Barbara spot prawns. And they are coddled
all the way to the table.</LD>
<LD>   They are caught in traps at depths up to 1,600 feet, carefully
brought aboard small shrimp boats and kept alive for the trip to
shore, which can be as much as 100 miles away. They are shipped from
the docks in trucks with large tanks of aerated seawater kept at an
icy 38 degrees to replicate the ocean depths as closely as possible.
Then they are cooked at high-end restaurants or eaten as sushi called
amaebi. Such is the popularity of this trendy delicacy that summer
menus throughout Southern California are featuring this prawn.</LD>
<LD>   Spot prawns are caught from February to November, but the majority
of the harvest comes right about now. Even in the best of times,
though, the catch is erratic--weather in the fishing grounds can be
treacherous. Sometimes entire weeks can go by with seas too rough for
the small boats.</LD>
<TE>   What is it about spot prawns that make them worth the trouble?
It's not just the size, though with a "shrimp" as long as 10 inches,
that is certainly distinctive. The real selling point of spot prawns
is their firm texture and sweet, almost nutty flavor. In many ways,
these are closer to lobster than to the soft, pallid farm-raised
shrimp we're so used to today.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great shrimp, and you can do anything with it," says
Michael Cimarusti, head chef at the Water Grill, one of Los Angeles'
top seafood restaurants. "They're incredibly sweet."</TE>
<TE>   Echoes Charles Fredericks, the head chef at Bouchon in Santa
Barbara: "In my opinion, it's one of the superior crustacean products
available anywhere in the world. Chefs always look for ingredients,
and this is one ingredient that makes a chef look good."</TE>
<TE>   Although most shrimp today are raised in vast farms as far away as
Southeast Asia and South America, then shipped to this country in
great frozen blocks, spot prawns are incredibly perishable and should
be purchased, as Fredericks puts it, "alive and kicking." Within
hours of dying, they become mushy, tasteless and virtually worthless
unless they've been handled just right.</TE>
<TE>   "They're a lot like lobsters, so they're not going to last three
or four days," says Blake Wheeler, a wholesale buyer for American
Fish and Seafood Co. "You want to move them quick."</TE>
<TE>   Alaska to San Diego</TE>
<TE>   The major California fishery for the spot prawn is off Monterey
and around Southern California's Channel Islands (despite its Santa
Barbara nickname, the prawn is found from the Bering Sea to San
Diego).</TE>
<TE>   There is no clear definition of what is a prawn and what is a
shrimp. In general, big shrimps are called prawns. Spot prawns, which
are so-called because they have four distinctive white spots on their
abdomens, come from the genus Pandalus, which tend to be wildly
colored--a close cousin is the coonstripe shrimp from the northern
Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   Though some are caught in trawl nets, most experts agree that the
best spot prawns are those caught in traps, usually oblong
contraptions with conical entrances at either end. The traps, baited
with everything from cat food to fish carcasses, are hooked to a long
nylon line and lowered to depths ranging from 400 to 1,600 feet.</TE>
<TE>   Shrimpers mark their lines with distinctive buoys and haul them up
every several days. The catch is then dumped into tanks of chilled
salt water for the long trip back to port. One fisherman,
Ventura-based Jeff Hepp, says he sometimes fishes more than 100 miles
offshore for the spot prawn.</TE>
<TE>   But that is only the beginning of the process that eventually puts
the prawn on a dinner plate. Next in the chain is the likes of Steve
Moore of Oxnard, who trucks the prawns to wholesalers and selected
restaurants around Los Angeles. Moore says he prefers the trapped
variety because they are in better shape and tend to be larger,
usually about six to the pound.</TE>
<TE>   "The ones in the traps are of better quality because they don't
get so beat up," says Moore, who also owns two restaurants called the
Fresh Catch, in Oxnard and Newbury Park.</TE>
<TE>   The spot prawn looks more like a lobster than a garden-variety
shrimp. Spot prawns start off as males, but become females after
three years. They mate once as a male and at least once as a female.
Their average lifespan in waters off California is six years. At the
end of the spawning season in January, there is a noticeable drop-off
in females because that is when they usually die.</TE>
<TE>   A Comfy 38 Degrees</TE>
<TE>   Once caught, Moore says the spot prawns are weighed at the dock
before he loads them into one of three 200-gallon tanks installed in
his truck. The saltwater is cooled to 38 degrees in an effort to
replicate spot prawn habitat and keep the catch alive longer. The
water itself is aerated using a soaker hose.</TE>
<TE>   If they aren't bound for a tank, they have to be beheaded quickly
before an enzyme begins to seep into the rest of the body, turning
the flesh mushy and discoloring it.</TE>
<TE>   Because of their erratic availability and because they require
such careful handling, spot prawns are only rarely found at retail,
even at seafood specialty stores. But they can be found from time to
time at some seafood markets such as Fish King in Glendale, or
ordered live through high-end food stores such as Bristol Farms. They
can also be found at seafood vendors at some Southern California
farmers markets.</TE>
<TE>   Spot prawns can be fixed in a variety of ways. Mostly commonly,
they are simply split down the length and sauteed or grilled to take
the greatest advantage of their impressive size. The tail is the best
part. The head (which makes up as much as one-third of the length)
does contain a lot of flavorful fat, though it is hard to get to.
Sometimes you'll get spots that still have their roe. Though this is
colorful, it doesn't have much flavor.</TE>
<TE>   Cimarusti takes advantage of their appearance by serving split,
grilled prawns with a light stew of favas and ginger. Another time he
served them with a delicate salad of steamed fingerling potatoes
bound with a lobster nage.</TE>
<TE>   Because they are available only occasionally, Fredericks says he
never puts spot prawns on his menu, but makes them a house specialty
when shrimpers call and say they're coming in with a load of spots.
One recent dish featured wontons with a filling of chopped spot
prawns. Though this may seem like a waste of a beautiful body, using
them this way gets the most flavor from the smallest amount of an
expensive ingredient. In sushi, amaebi, or sweet prawns, are shelled
and the tails are eaten raw. Sometimes the heads are served
separately, either deep fried in tempura batter or in a miso broth.</TE>
<TE>   Trapping for spot prawns can have its down side. Moore says that
on occasion, territorial conflicts arise between the trappers and the
trawlers, or draggers.</TE>
<TE>   "The draggers will get in there and destroy a string or two," he
says. "It usually happens when the dragger isn't a local."</TE>
<TE>   Or consider the case of John Gooth, an Oceanside shrimper who had
to set out early last week to pull in his traps and move them. The
reason was somewhat unusual: as part of naval exercises out of San
Diego, minesweepers were operating in the area.</TE>
<TE>   "If I didn't get them out, the minesweeper would have cut my
lines," he says.</TE>

<TE>   Grilled Spot Prawns With Peas and Ginger</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour, 10
minutes</TE>
<TE>   This recipe comes from Michael Cimarusti at Water Grill in
downtown Los Angeles. He likes to use tiny fava beans, but says peas
may be substituted. We tested this recipe with peas and found that
not only were they delicious, but not having to shell and peel the
fava beans saved time. If you do use favas, look for them at
well-supplied farmers markets and specialty stores. Fleur de sel, a
sea salt, is sold at specialty markets and well-stocked supermarkets.</TE>
<TE>   2 1/2 pounds spot prawns (about 12) or other large prawns</TE>
<TE>   12 thick asparagus spears, tough ends removed, peeled</TE>
<TE>   1 tomato</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon butter</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon grated ginger root</TE>
<TE>   1 cup peas or small fava beans</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons finely chopped chives</TE>
<TE>   Juice of 1 lemon</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon fresh tarragon leaves</TE>
<TE>   Fleur de sel, for garnish</TE>
<TE>   Heat the grill to high. Line a baking sheet with paper towels and
set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Fill a stockpot or large, deep pot with water and bring to a
rolling boil over high heat. Add the prawns head-first to the pot all
at once and cover. Cook 30 seconds. Drain the prawns in a colander
and rinse with cold water. Place the prawns on the baking sheet and
pat dry with paper towels.</TE>
<TE>   Cut the asparagus into 3-inch pieces. Blanch 30 seconds, then
plunge into a bowl of ice water. Drain and set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Blanch the tomato 30 seconds, then plunge into ice water. Remove
the tomato, cut out the core and peel. Cut the tomato into quarters,
seed and dice. Set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Place the prawns in a large bowl. Add 1 tablespoon of the olive
oil and salt and pepper to taste. Place the prawns on the grill,
cover, and cook until the shells are slightly charred, 2 to 3
minutes. Turn them over and cook 2 to 3 minutes more, depending on
the size. To check for doneness, remove a prawn from the grill and
cut into the tail portion. The meat should be opaque and cooked
through in the center. Remove the prawns from the grill and set
aside.</TE>
<TE>   Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the butter and
melt; do not sizzle or brown. Add the ginger and cook until fragrant,
30 seconds. Add the asparagus and peas and warm gently, 1 minute.
Increase the heat to medium and add the tomato. Cook, stirring
gently, until the tomato breaks down slightly, 3 to 4 minutes. This
will thicken the pan juices. Season with salt and pepper to taste and
add the chives. Set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Cut the prawns in half down the middle with a sharp knife and
devein if necessary. Divide the prawns among 4 large warmed plates
and spoon the asparagus mixture over and around them. Squeeze lemon
juice over the prawns, drizzle liberally with the remaining 2
tablespoons of extra-virgin olive-oil, and sprinkle with the tarragon
and a little fleur de sel.</TE>

<TE>   'Spot Stickers' With Dipping Sauce and</TE>
<TE>   Green Onion Salad</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 55 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour, 10
minutes</TE>
<TE>   These pot stickers made with spot prawns are from chef Charles
Fredericks of Bouchon in Santa Barbara. Serve them as appetizers.
Mirin can be found in the Asian aisle of well-stocked supermarkets.
Dumpling wrappers can be found at Asian markets and with the ethnic
ingredients in the refrigerated aisle of well-stocked supermarkets.</TE>
<TE>   POT STICKERS</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 pounds spot prawns (about 7 or 8) or other large prawns</TE>
<TE>   10 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons vegetable oil, divided</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup minced red bell pepper</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons minced garlic (about 5 cloves)</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons minced ginger root</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons minced green onions, white parts only</TE>
<TE>   48 round dumpling wrappers</TE>
<TE>   Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil over high heat.
Plunge the prawns head-first into the pot, cover and cook 30 seconds.
Drain the prawns in a colander; rinse with cold water until cool.
Twist off the heads, peel and devein.</TE>
<TE>   Heat 2 teaspoons of the oil in a large skillet over medium-low
heat. Add the bell pepper and cook until slightly softened, 2
minutes. Transfer to a bowl and set aside. Increase the heat to
medium-high, add 2 tablespoons of the oil to the skillet and cook the
garlic, ginger and green onions until fragrant and tender, stirring,
1 minute. Do not brown. Add the prawns and cook 30 seconds on each
side.</TE>
<TE>   Add the prawns to the bowl with the bell pepper and toss. When
cool enough to handle, cut the prawns into quarters.</TE>
<TE>   If using a dumpling press, lay a dumpling wrapper on the press and
place a piece of prawn and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper mixture in the
center. Lightly moisten the edges of the wrapper with water and close
the press to make a pot sticker. Remove and set on a large tray.
Repeat, filling the remaining wrappers with the shrimp and pepper
mixture. Cover the pot stickers with a damp paper towel as you work
so they don't dry out. (If you don't have a dumpling press, lay each
wrapper on a work surface, place a piece of prawn and 1/4 teaspoon of
the pepper mixture in the center. Lightly moisten the edges of the
wrapper with water and fold over, pressing to seal. Pinch the edges
with your fingers to pleat.)</TE>
<TE>   Heat a large skillet over high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of oil and
swirl to cover the bottom of the pan. When the oil is hot, add 12 pot
stickers and brown each side 30 seconds. Add 1/2 cup of water, cover
and steam until all the liquid is evaporated, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove
and keep warm. Repeat with the remaining pot stickers, each time
adding 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet to brown, and 1/2 cup of
water to steam.</TE>

<LD>Cooking and handling Santa Barbara spot prawns can be daunting, not
just because of their great size, but because it's essential to
purchase them alive. They're best prepared as soon as possible,
certainly the day of purchase.</LD>
<LD>   When you buy them, the prawns should be packed for travel--covered
in crushed ice and sealed in a plastic bag works well. Once home, if
you're not cooking them immediately, place the prawns on a rack set
over a large pan and cover them with ice. Don't store them in water;
it will dilute their natural salty flavor, and as salt water
creatures, they won't survive.</LD>
<LD>   No matter how you plan to cook them, we found that plunging them
head-first into a large pot of boiling water for 30 seconds kills
them without much effort. Be sure to cover the pot as soon as you add
the shrimp, then drain them in a colander and rinse with cold water
until they're cool enough to handle.</LD>
<TE>   For the Spot Sticker recipe, immediately twist off the heads after
cooling and peel and devein as you would for shrimp.</TE>
<TE>   For the grilled prawn recipe, trim the prawns' long antennas
before tossing them with the oil and seasonings. It may not be
necessary to devein them, but after grilling, check for black veins
as you cut them in half, and remove any with a sharp knife.</TE>
<TE>   Here are some sources for spot prawns:</TE>
<TE>   * Fish King, 722 N. Glendale Ave., Glendale, (818) 244-2161.
$15.95 a pound. Call first for availability. The market keeps a list

<LD>DEAR SOS: Some friends of mine have a bumper crop of zucchini. Can
you reprint your recipe for zucchini relish?</LD>
<LD>   JIM GOODENOUGH</LD>
<LD>   Canoga Park</LD>
<TE>   DEAR JIM: This recipe of Marion Cunningham's ran in 1997. It
called for the vegetables to be ground, but we think chopping them
makes for a prettier relish.</TE>
<TE>   We tested this recipe several times, and each time got a slightly
different yield. Your yield may vary depending on the kind of
equipment you use and how small you chop the zucchini.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Send requests to Culinary SOS, Food Section, Los Angeles Times,
202 W. 1st St., Los Angeles, CA 90012 or e-mail to: cindy.dorn@
latimes.com. Please include your last name and city of residence for
publication. Include restaurant address when requesting recipes from
restaurants.</TE>

<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 1 hour, plus 8 hours
standing * Vegetarian</TE>
<TE>   10 cups chopped zucchini (about 6 zucchini)</TE>
<TE>   4 cups chopped onions</TE>
<TE>   2 cups chopped celery</TE>
<TE>   2 large red bell peppers, chopped</TE>
<TE>   5 tablespoons salt</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon cornstarch</TE>
<TE>   2 1/2 cups vinegar, divided</TE>
<TE>   6 cups sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon nutmeg</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon turmeric</TE>
<TE>   1/2 tablespoon pepper</TE>
<TE>   2 jalapenos, seeded and finely chopped</TE>
<TE>   6 cloves garlic, finely chopped</TE>
<TE>   Combine the zucchini, onions, celery and peppers in a large glass
mixing bowl. Cover with cold water and stir in the salt. Let stand at
room temperature overnight. Drain and rinse 4 times in cold water.</TE>
<TE>   Dissolve the cornstarch in 1/2 cup of vinegar and add to the
vegetables along with the remaining 2 cups of vinegar, the sugar,
nutmeg, turmeric, pepper, jalapenos and garlic.</TE>
<TE>   Place the mixture in a large pot, partially cover and simmer 15
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil and sterilize the
jars and lids, about 5 minutes. Turn off the heat, but leave the jars
and lids in the hot water until you're ready to use them.</TE>
<TE>   Fill the jars with the mixture to within 1/2 inch of the top,
being careful to keep the jar rim clean. Cover each jar with the flat
part of the lid and tighten the ring around it.</TE>
<TE>   Place the jars in a large pot of boiling water and process 10
minutes (you may have to do this in batches). Remove the jars from
the water and set them on dish towels in a cool place. After 30
minutes, press firmly on each lid. If the lid remains down, the seal
is good. If the center of the lid springs back up, process in boiling
water again.</TE>

fillings available are red bean, red bean and chestnut, white bean

<HD>Baking From Scratch Is a Snap (Almost)</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA HANSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Baking a cake from scratch is scary. You can tell this from
supermarket aisles lined with cake mixes, and the scant likelihood of
ever running into a homemade cake at an office party or potluck
dinner.</LD>
<LD>   Cookbook author Susan G. Purdy understands the fear. "Everyone
loves a home to smell as if there were a cake in the oven, but no one
wants to put it there," she acknowledges in "The Perfect Cake"
(Broadway Books; $19.95).</LD>
<LD>   A teacher and author of several books on baking, Purdy attempts to
make the process so clear that even a beginner will be successful.
It's a matter of chemistry and techniques that can be learned, she
insists, not magic or guesswork. Maybe so. Still, there are variables
that can affect the outcome, like stirring too much or not enough, a
slight difference in pans or an oven that performs differently from
the one in which the recipe was tested.</LD>
<TE>   To eliminate these stumbling blocks, Purdy devotes many pages to
technique, ingredients and equipment. However, impatient readers will
probably skip to the recipes. These are written with plenty of
detail, as if Purdy were working alongside. The format is
unusual--pan sizes, pan preparation, baking time and yield are listed
in the margin, not in the recipe. This arrangement makes it possible
to grasp the essentials at a glance.</TE>
<TE>   Recipes start with the "foolproof" 1-2-3-4 cake, followed by the
two-egg white cake, which has to be easy. Purdy made it at the age of
7. Each includes so many variations that the beginner who masters
both will have a repertoire of 13 cakes, more than most would ever
bake in a lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   But this book isn't just for novices. It goes on to more intricate
recipes for experienced bakers, such as the southern Lane Cake, with
its complex filling of fruits, nuts and coconut; the Christmas log
cake buche de Noel; a Grand Marnier genoise; a chestnut mousse cake
and an eight-layer chocolate cake.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the intent is to get people baking who would not otherwise
do so. If layer cakes with frosting are too intimidating, Purdy
offers cakes baked in square or loaf pans, upside-down cakes and
pudding cakes, which separate into cake and soft pudding as they
bake. Her banana-chocolate chip cake is very satisfactory. The
two-egg white cake baked up a little dry, but met the
easy-to-put-together claim. But one person's quick is not always
another's; "quick chopped apple cake" was not very quick. It took a
long time to cut enough apples into  1/4-inch pieces to fill 3 cups.</TE>
<TE>   Although exhaustive in content, the book is far from intimidating,
because Purdy's approach is to encourage new bakers rather than talk
down to them. She can even make baking sound like fun.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Imagine being handed a priceless treasure and told to leap across a
pit full of rattlesnakes in a stadium packed with enemies who hope
you fall in.</LD>
<LD>   That's how Bob Cabral felt in 1998 when he took over winemaking
duties at Williams Selyem, one of California's original and most
successful cult wineries. The treasure was the reputation of a winery
that is not only considered one of the New World's finest Pinot Noir
houses, but is also fiercely cherished by its many fans.</LD>
<LD>   "Everybody hoped I would fail," he says. "I knew the press would
be brutal, but they were more brutal than I'd imagined. I didn't know
there was such a sense of ownership with this brand. The media, the
customers, even other winemakers, were all just waiting for me to
blow it."</LD>
<TE>   During the two years between the '98 harvest and the first
releases of those wines in 2000, Cabral and Williams Selyem's new
owner, New York businessman John Dyson, were the object of relentless
second-guessing and negative innuendo. Being roundly hated for being
the new guys was just the beginning.</TE>
<TE>   First, there were rumors that the winery was going to start
pumping out huge quantities of mediocre wine. Wine critic Robert M.
Parker Jr. speculated the winery "could just try to make a lot of
money living off the good name for a few years." A New York Times
article noted gloomily, "If Williams Selyem stumbles, plenty of able
competitors are waiting to lure its customers."</TE>
<TE>   But the winery's co-founder and original winemaker, Burt Williams,
who had chosen Cabral as his successor, counseled patience. "Burt
told me not to worry about it," Cabral says. "He said when they taste
your first vintage, they'll shut up. Let the wines do the speaking
and bite your tongue."</TE>
<TE>   Four years after the sale, Cabral's wines are speaking clearly in
the Williams Selyem voice. Although his inaugural 1998 vintage was a
tough one in California, Cabral's wines were well received by critics
and consumers. So were the '99s. And the 2000s and '01s I tasted at
the winery last week were impressive.</TE>
<TE>   By all accounts, the Williams Selyem wines are as good as ever
with Cabral in the winemaker's boots.</TE>
<TE>   Two Guys and a Garage</TE>
<TE>   When wine fanatics toy with the idea of putting their life savings
into starting a winery, they're imagining Williams Selyem. It was
founded as Hacienda del Rio in the early 1980s by two longtime
friends: Williams, a printer, and Ed Selyem, a grocery store manager.
When the previously established Hacienda Winery threatened litigation
over the name in 1985, they changed to Williams Selyem.</TE>
<TE>   The first wines were made in Williams' garage, then in rented
space before the move to the current Russian River Valley facility in
1986. They didn't go in to the vineyard business, preferring to make
small lots of wine from outstanding sites such as the nearby Rochioli
and Allen vineyards. The flagship wine came from Rochioli's West
Block, some of the oldest Pinot Noir vines in western Sonoma County.
There were several other vineyard-designated Pinots, and a chewy,
intensely peppery Zinfandel from the old Martinelli family vineyard
known as Jackass Hill.</TE>
<TE>   When the partners decided to retire in 1997, they seriously
considered closing the winery doors for good rather than pass their
reputation to unknown hands. At the same time, the scent of money was
in the air. There were plenty of interested buyers ranging from large
corporations to wealthy individuals such as retired football star Joe
Montana.</TE>
<TE>   The suitor who eventually persuaded them to sell, Dyson, was a
longtime Williams Selyem mailing list customer who owns wine estates
in New York (Millbrook Estate) and Tuscany, Italy, (Villa Pillo), and
vineyards on California's Central Coast and in the Russian River
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "They had two conditions for a buyer," Dyson recalls. "They said
you had to own a winery already, and you had to be on their mailing
list."</TE>
<TE>   They quickly struck a $9.5-million deal. Then Dyson met with
Cabral, a relatively unknown winemaker in his late 30s. A Fresno
State enology graduate who began his career making bulk wine in the
San Joaquin Valley before moving on to stints at DeLoach, Kunde and
Alderbrook, Cabral was struggling to reconcile his training as a
production winemaker with his passion for distinctive, terroir-driven
wines.</TE>
<TE>   Cabral told Dyson that he had a condition too: He wouldn't take
the job unless he got a bigger allocation of Williams Selyem wine.</TE>
<TE>   "But the main thing we ended up talking about at our first meeting
was soil science," Dyson says. "I thought that was a good sign."</TE>
<TE>   Cabral had just taken over as winemaker at Hartford Court, another
highly regarded Russian River Valley Pinot house. But with little
hesitation, he finished making the '97 Hartford Court wines and moved
across the valley to one of the most intensely coveted jobs in
California wine.</TE>
<TE>   Williams Selyem was a true artisan winery from the start. Williams
and Selyem handcrafted the wines.</TE>
<TE>   They fermented the grapes in small, stainless steel tanks
purchased from a dairy, using naturally occurring yeast rather than
commercial inoculants. When they did begin inoculating in the
mid-1980s, it was only with a cleaned-up version of an indigenous
strain from Jackass Hill isolated by Vinquiry, a commercial
laboratory in Healdsburg, Calif., (and now available to winemakers as
the Williams Selyem strain).</TE>
<TE>   The French Touch</TE>
<TE>   They punched the caps down by hand, Burgundy-style, gravity-fed
the wines to French oak barrels for aging, and bottled them without
filtration to avoid stripping out flavor and complexity.</TE>
<TE>   Cabral insists he hasn't deviated from Williams' winemaking
methods. "I've never worked so hard in my life not to change
something," he says, although when pressed, he admits, "I do a little
more lab work than Burt did. One of the first things I did was buy a
microscope."</TE>
<TE>   Production has increased, but only by about 2,000 cases so far
(from 8,000 to 10,000) of small, vineyard-designated bottlings. The
wines sell for $22 to $70 a bottle, which is essentially a wholesale
price, because buyers are dealing directly with the winery. Of
course, those same wines can instantly be resold for as much as three
to five times that price.</TE>
<TE>   Cabral says that eventually production will be 15,000 cases,
mostly in the Russian River Valley and Sonoma County appellations,
but also with several new vineyard designates. He's particularly
excited about a new Central Coast bottling from Dyson's vineyard in
Hollister, not far from Calera, the Pinot Noir specialist. The 40,000
cases of plonk feared by skeptics haven't materialized, and Cabral
says they won't.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the immediate growth is in the reintroduction of Zinfandel
and Chardonnay. They had been phased out when the winery began
focusing almost exclusively on Pinot Noir, but Cabral and Dyson are
adding them back to the mix.</TE>
<TE>   A New Way With Zin</TE>
<TE>   Some of the new Zins stood out in my tasting last week. The '00
Feeney Vineyard (78 cases) is remarkably thick and intense, yet clear
on the palate and finely structured. The same combination of lush and
firm shows in two small bottlings from the Forchini Vineyard, South
Knoll (from sandy soil) and North Flats (more clay).</TE>
<TE>   Of the six single-vineyard '00 Chardonnays (200 to 300 cases
each), the high-toned intensity of the Allen Vineyard and the
lemon-drop succulence of the coastal Hawk Hill Vineyard were
especially outstanding.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the Williams Selyem cult worships Pinot Noir above all.
The source of the fabled West Block bottling was lost with the sale
(Tom Rochioli now produces a stunning Pinot from his own grapes), but
there are plenty of other single-vineyard bottlings to adore. I found
a fascinating comparison in the '00 Allen and the '00 Rochioli River
Block Pinots. Everything about them is the same except for the age
and location of the vines. Allen was planted in 1969 (by Joe
Rochioli, who manages the vineyard) and River Block was propagated
from the Allen vines in the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   So the plant material, vineyard management and winemaking are the
same. Yet the wines are subtly but distinctly different.</TE>
<TE>   The deep sandy loam and riverine gravel of River Block yields a
big, regally proportioned Pinot with deep flavor that moves through
the palate like ... well, a river.</TE>
<TE>   The shallower clay soil on the marginally higher Allen site gives
a more spicy, rose-inflected perfume, and fruit that seems a little
more vibrant while still maintaining a majestic length and breadth.</TE>
<TE>   All in all, Williams Selyem Winery's stature as a cherished
institution does not appear threatened. Coveted spots on the Williams
Selyem mailing list are being handed down like family heirlooms to a
new generation of wine fans. Since the first list was started in the
mid-1980s it has grown to some 15,000 customers (with another 1,200
on a waiting list) who are prepared to buy whatever the winery
offers, at virtually any price.</TE>
<TE>   Dyson's place on the list is in the mid-700s. And customer No. 576
is Cabral.</TE>

<LD>Folding, filling and sealing dumplings by hand can take a long time.
That's why we used a dumpling press for the Spot Stickers recipe--it
made our work easy.</LD>
<LD>   A dumpling press is a hard-plastic gadget that looks a bit like a
set of false teeth with handles. Cookware stores sell them for about
$5.</LD>
<LD>   To use one, you open the press flat, lay a dumpling wrapper on it,
place the filling in the center and lightly moisten the edges of the
wrapper with water (use a brush or your finger). Then close and press
to seal but not too tight--you don't want the filling to run out or
the dumpling to be squashed. Open the press and lift out your
perfectly pleated dumpling. You'll be able to make quite a few in a
short time.</LD>
<TE>   And this is a gadget with more than one use: It can also turn out
ravioli, empanadas and small pastries.</TE>

<HD>Wine of the Week</HD>
<DH>2001 Chateau Grande Cassagne Costieres de Nimes Rose, Rhone
Valley, France.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rose doesn't get as much respect as it should. Serious wine drinkers
tend to dismiss it as not worthy of their attention, thanks to the
specter of white Zinfandel. But when it's made well, rose can be
delightful. Dry and well-chilled, it is ideal for the hot days of
summer.</LD>
<LD>   This one, from a small estate in the village of St. Gilles in the
Rhone Valley, is the color of strawberries. Despite its sweet pretty
nose, the wine is very dry. Full-bodied for a rose, this is a real
wine with a lovely, slightly bitter finish similar to a great
aperitif. Serve it chilled--before a meal, or with shrimp, Nicoise
salad, grilled fish or chicken.</LD>
<LD>   About $9. Widely available at fine wine shops and retailers.</LD>

<HD>The Plant Healer</HD>
<DH>Allegra Woods takes in unwanted or neglected flora and
breathes life into the castoffs with tender loving care. It's a
calling she came to by chance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN DARDICK</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some people find stray cats or dogs at their doorstep. Allegra Woods
finds plants. Sickly succulents, hydrangeas without hope, falling
ferns. Plants left in the quiet of the night by neighbors cleaning
up, moving on; in the light of day by relatives and friends who know
that if anyone can give a sad plant a lift, it is Woods.</LD>
<LD>   The plants bring to life an outdoor corridor at the French
Normandy-style garden apartments where Woods lives in the
Mid-Wilshire area of Los Angeles. On stands and tables, in clay,
ceramic and plastic pots, the plants line a walkway between the
garage and the eight-unit property she and husband Doug manage for
her parents. The dozens of flowering and foliage plants came to her
as castoffs. Her application of water, fertilizer and consistent care
turned them into thriving--and in some cases dramatic--pictures of
health.</LD>
<LD>   One plant dominates the container garden--a spectacular Cereus
peruvianus spreading 20 feet from its 15-gallon tub. This is one of
Woods' favorites, because of the tree-like form and large white
flowers that unfurl at night.</LD>
<TE>   Also in her garden are hydrangeas with fat, vivid blue flower
clusters, cymbidium orchids, one with 12 flower spikes, an assortment
of geraniums, azaleas, miniature roses, spider plants, succulents and
ferns. A statue of a benevolent Kuan Yin, the Chinese goddess of
mercy, occupies a place of honor and several pieces of colorful
pottery and folk art are interspersed among the pots. A mirror behind
an orchid reflects the flowers and makes the space seem larger than
its 10-by-20 feet.</TE>
<TE>   Unplanned Hobby</TE>
<TE>   Woods never planned to rescue plants. Her first save occurred
several years ago, on behalf of her sister, Victoria Yust, who asked
her to nurse a sickly palm struggling to survive as an indoor plant.
Woods agreed and with watering and fertilizing, the palm thrived.</TE>
<TE>   Next came a cymbidium orchid (the same plant that rewarded her
with 12 bloom stalks this year), followed by numerous miniature
roses, hydrangeas and other plants discarded by their owners when the
flowers faded and plants drooped.</TE>
<TE>   "I like all plants, but I'm especially interested in ones with
odd-looking shapes," Woods said, pointing out a Snake Plant
(Sansevieria trifasciata) that had been abandoned when a tenant moved
away.</TE>
<TE>   "As tenants learned about my taking in plants, some would leave
their plants at my door when they moved out," she says. Recently, she
discovered a bromeliad left behind when its flower was past its
prime.</TE>
<TE>   Although Woods, 33, comes from a family of garden enthusiasts, she
didn't join them until she was in her late teens. Her mother grows
roses and orchids and her grandmother also was renowned for her green
thumb.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it goes back further than three generations because
everyone in my mother's family is a superb gardener," Woods says.</TE>
<TE>   Woods wasn't especially interested in plants while growing up.
While her mother tended her large garden, Woods preferred her studies
and reading. The turning point came in 1988 when her parents, Larry
and Clara Yust of Los Angeles, went to Europe and left her in charge
of their rose garden, with its hundreds of hybrid tea, floribunda and
grandiflora roses.</TE>
<TE>   It was an especially hot summer, she recalls, and she had to get
up early in the morning to water them with a hose because her mother
didn't use automatic sprinklers. She watered them faithfully and
implored them: "Please don't die before my mother returns."</TE>
<TE>   They didn't die and in the process, she discovered that she liked
taking care of plants.</TE>
<TE>   Doses of Water and Fertilizer</TE>
<TE>   "Gardening pulls me outdoors," she said. Her work producing the
annual L.A. Blue Book Society Register of Southern California keeps
her indoors at her computer or telephone most of the time. She looks
forward to the time she spends with the plants. Woods says she hasn't
any special secrets other than giving her plants regular doses of
water and fertilizer and says people wouldn't fail plants if they'd
do the same. "Some people have the best of hearts when they bring
plants into their homes but then they don't extend themselves and
take care of them," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Woods' collection continues to grow. Recently, a woman rented an
apartment in the building complex and received three plants as
housewarming gifts. She observed Woods tending the patio plants and
felt her house presents would do better under her care. Woods agreed
to adopt them.</TE>
<TE>   So, wondering just where you can drop off your wilting plants?
Sorry, Woods doesn't give out her address. She loves doing what she
does but doesn't want to be inundated.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, there is another option open to owners of bedraggled
plants everywhere: Give them a second chance yourself.</TE>

<AU>Chris Erskine</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No one ever claimed biology was particularly pretty, especially when
your mom and dad are involved.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm going to have a baby," their mother announces.</LD>
<LD>   One kid cries. Another nearly passes out from shock and disgust.
Generally, everyone takes it quite well.</LD>
<TE>   "Hey Mom," the boy asks every morning, "how do you like your
eggs?"</TE>
<TE>   "Unfertilized," she grumbles, a joke the kids repeat to everyone
who walks in the door. Believe me, walk in the door, you'll hear that
joke.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey Dad, how does Mom like her eggs?"</TE>
<TE>   "Over easy?"</TE>
<TE>   "Unfertilized!" they scold.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll try to remember that," I say.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the issue of contraception has come up, and you know your
life has turned upside-down when your teenage kids are slipping you
hints about such things and chastising you for your lack of
self-control.</TE>
<TE>   With unusual glee, our lovely and patient older daughter lectures
us about what an unplanned pregnancy can do to someone's life.
Evidently, having a child is a huge, lifelong responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you sure you're ready for this?" our college-age daughter
asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Somehow, we'll make it work," I assure her.</TE>
<TE>   "We're young," her mother notes, "but we love each other."</TE>
<TE>   "Well, sometimes that's not enough," our daughter says.</TE>
<TE>   And sometimes it is. It got us through our first three children,
who are turning out pretty well despite a chronic shortage of funds
and a surplus of those parenting books their mother keeps buying.
Somehow, they survived all that. Now they'll probably survive this.</TE>
<TE>   "Grandma, can I come live with you?" the older daughter pleads
over the phone.</TE>
<TE>   "Me too!" yells the little girl.</TE>
<TE>   First, they were forced to endure the house renovation, which has
lasted longer than the Civil War and shows no sign of ever ending.</TE>
<TE>   Now there's this new baby on the way. Talk about war. Talk about
sacrifice. Clothes. Food. Proms. Tuition. The kids can somehow sense
the new set of demands that will be placed upon the family.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not changing any diapers," the boy says.</TE>
<TE>   "Me either," says his little sister.</TE>
<TE>   "Me either," I lie.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the biological details of it all continue to baffle
them. Just how does something like this happen to parents in their
40s?</TE>
<TE>   At 40, the number of eggs drops. They are good eggs, mostly, just
fewer of them. This, according to experts and dads everywhere,
reduces the chances of conception.</TE>
<TE>   Among married couples, it can also lead to a certain recklessness.
It can lead to surprise. How do you like your eggs? Well, you know.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the rarity of husband-wife romance itself, what with
kids sleeping with the parents, as many children do these days.</TE>
<TE>   You know how it goes. During a house renovation, you lose a
bedroom, some kid is in bed with you. Even when you're not
renovating, someone is having a nightmare and tiptoeing around the
bedroom like a cat burglar.</TE>
<TE>   "Mom?"</TE>
<TE>   "Huh?</TE>
<TE>   "Nightmare," someone says, which can put a crimp in the marital
relations department, if you know what I mean.</TE>
<TE>   So how does something like this happen?</TE>
<TE>   "Did you go on a cruise?" our friend Mary Ann asks. "Usually, it
happens on a cruise."</TE>
<TE>   No, not a cruise. Rarely left the house, though in hindsight that
was probably a mistake. In my experience, most accidents happen in
the home.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going with an Immaculate Conception," I explain to my friend
Paul.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what you said last time," Paul says.</TE>
<TE>   I favor the Immaculate Conception explanation, since it hints that
God is somehow involved and it would free me of original sin. Any
time you can unload sin, original or not, sign me up.</TE>
<TE>   "Actually, I think it was the night of Taylor's slumber party," my
wife explains.</TE>
<TE>   "So if Taylor doesn't have a slumber party, none of this happens?"
I ask.</TE>
<TE>   "That's right, slugger," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Can life be more capricious? Can the turning points be more
unpredictable?</TE>
<TE>   Can humor, faith, persistence, wisdom and family see you through?
Not likely. But what else are you going to do?</TE>
<TE>   "It's a boy," predicts my buddy Irv.</TE>
<TE>   "It is?" I say.</TE>
<TE>   "If I'm wrong, it'll be the first time."</TE>
<TE>   If you ask him, Irv will also predict the due date and describe
what you had for dinner the night the baby was conceived. It's a
gift, possibly. Or a form of dementia.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm never wrong," he says. "Just ask Metzker."</TE>
<TE>   Like I have the time. Ask my buddy Metzker something, and you'd
better carve out a week. Love the guy. But he requires a lot of
patience.</TE>
<TE>   "Just ask him," says Irv.</TE>
<TE>   OK, someday I'll ask him. In the meantime, I'll sit here wondering
how I'll pay for these new additions to the family--the house and the
kid.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, I've been wondering about such things for nearly 20
years now. There are finger-sized channels in my forehead from all
the rubbing and worrying, worrying and rubbing. It's one of the
components of aging, I suppose. But things usually work out. Somehow
we manage.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>At a quarter past dawn, the sky is just about the same color as the
street, a sort of black-backed silver and so in your car you feel not
so much that you're driving but that you're passing through, a cloud,
maybe, or a planet made of clouds. Passing through another dimension,
right out of Madeleine L'Engle, in which instead of driving you're
sailing across the floor, like a manta ray or a page of newspaper
unhitched by the wind. Telephone poles move past, dark as trees after
rain, and lines of stoplights chant their colors to empty streets
like monks at evensong.</LD>
<LD>   In the held-breath cool of a summer morning, things are newly
still. Signs and electric wires, plastic bags along the curb, women
waiting for the bus seem caught in the moment just before or after
movement, like a screen door or a spill of light in an Edward Hopper
painting.</LD>
<LD>   At a quarter past dawn, you're pretty sure you're alone on the
road and then you realize you're not. Headlights lift up the trailing
tail of darkness as they race toward you, swoosh past and it's
amazing how many cars are on the street, even more on the freeway at
this hour. Everyone's moving loose and a little erratic, because
there seems to be so much room and that's pretty weird.</LD>
<TE>   Who are all these people and where on earth are they going? You
can tell the ones who've been driving all night because their faces
are the most relaxed; they're feeling better than they have in a
while. That long, long hour before the sky finally gives a little is
always the hardest, when the world has reduced itself to the 10-foot
sweep of your headlights. Then the sun pries the night from the
horizon, and the spine straightens a bit, and hope uncurls like a
runner-bean seedling.</TE>
<TE>   At a quarter past dawn, things are so quiet you can hear the
murmur of traffic reports and talk radio in cars as they pass. Even
trucks that will later vibrate the sidewalk with bass, lowriders that
will shout the expletives of rap move quietly, whispering themselves
awake, passing through the odd world of an L.A. morning without a
ripple.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the store windows and house windows are flat and
dark--businesses are closed and folks still asleep--but some glow.
From here and then there comes the hot and salty smell of meat
cooking or the funk of strong coffee just ground. They are exciting
smells, tantalizing and foreign--early-morning breakfast in a booth
with worn-thin silver and the coffee cups white as hard-boiled eggs
is inevitably the marker of adventure or flight. Just thinking about
it makes either seem possible, almost real.</TE>
<TE>   At a quarter past dawn, alone on a road, suspended, it's hard
sometimes to remember why you're here. Where you came from. Where
exactly you're going. The car seems to know and that's a good thing
because even the most familiar thoroughfare seems off, like a room
lighted by a lamp kicked down a couple of watts or a wall on which
the pictures have been rearranged. Just a little bit.</TE>
<TE>   Turning down well-known streets, you expect to see the strangest
things: The apartment you shared with your girlfriends that summer in
Ocean City. The Missouri house that belonged to a young man you loved
so much your heart practiced breaking every time you saw him. A green
hill you climbed with your father and your baby son in another
country altogether.</TE>
<TE>   At a quarter past dawn, it's sometimes hard to know who you are.
Lifted from the warm bath of sleep and propelled into action, your
mind blinks between dream and waking. Which is real? You are moving
through space and time, through memory and thought. With any luck at
all, it's your thought, your memories. But it's hard to tell,
driving, at a quarter past dawn.</TE>

<LD>Shakespeare's World</LD>
<LD>   "Oh Romeo, Romeo. Wherefore art thou, Romeo?" You have probably
heard these lines, uttered by Juliet to her beloved Romeo. But did
you know that Juliet is not actually looking for Romeo? In
Shakespeare's world, "wherefore" meant "why." Juliet is really asking
why Romeo has to be her enemy.</LD>
<LD>   In William Shakespeare's time, people in England spoke Elizabethan
English, named after Elizabeth the First, queen of England.
Shakespeare wrote all of his plays in this style.</LD>
<TE>   Now, you may think Shakespeare's plays are hard to follow and full
of words you've never seen or heard. But his plays cover themes like
love and hate, loyalty and dishonor, and war and peace--things that
are still being written about today. That's why the Idyllwild Arts
Summer Program is offering "Shakespeare's World," where you can
rehearse and perform a shorter version of one of Shakespeare's plays
in the great outdoors. You can also watch videotaped performances,
read an actual play, be taken to a live performance at the Old Globe
Theater in San Diego and learn about Elizabethan mask-making and
sonnet writing (a form of poetry). The program begins this Sunday and
continues through Aug. 17.</TE>
<TE>   The Idyllwild Art Summer Program offers many other arts classes
for children as well as adults. For more information, call (909)

<HD>Keepin' It Real and Out of Court</HD>
<DH>Writing* Would-be memoirists learn of the challenges of
bringing truth-based material to the page or stage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNELL GEORGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In our more expansive states, we tell ourselves that our
memories--and all the associations they trigger--are merely a
personal perspective, the stuff of stories that are ours to tell. But
most will concede that recollection lies somewhere in the gray
territory between fact and fiction. And when a writer's pen points
too close to home, and a story spills some shared secret--or shades
an event more darkly than others recall it--the aggrieved might reach
for a stronger description of what memory's wrought: Slander. Libel.
Tattletales.</LD>
<LD>   At a moment when many seem to be contemplating the gamble of
mining secrets to make art (and/or money while they're at it), the
Beverly Hills Bar Assn. Barristers Committee for the Arts just a few
nights ago hosted a lively panel: "The Curse of the Red Kimono: Legal
Issues for Memoir and One-Person-Show Writers," a nuts-and-bolts
legal overview of the legal trapdoors of memoir and the challenges of
bringing truth-based stories to the page or stage.</LD>
<TE>   "This is not legal advice," attorney and event organizer Joel
Zighelboim stressed to a packed crowd of men and women (and
children!) who snatched up every last folding chair in the naked,
art-stripped main gallery at Track 16 in Bergamot Station. "We wanted
to provide a public service for the arts community who may not have
access to the law, but again, this is not legal advice. Talk to a
lawyer in a confidential situation. This is purely informational. OK.
Disclaimer stops here," he joked.</TE>
<TE>   For all the furious notebook scribbling, though, what was imparted
may as well have been law--chapter and verse. One had to wonder what
manner of secrets lay at home hidden in journals or password-locked
on a computer hard drive. "They put an ad in Backstage West,"
explained a woman saving the last precious seat for a friend. "And
Theater L.A....." piped in another.</TE>
<TE>   A show of hands revealed that many of those assembled were
playwrights, actors, memoirists. People with stories to tell. Or axes
to grind.</TE>
<TE>   In a culture that still feeds happily on the tawdriest of tabloids
and roustabout reality TV, truth isn't just elastic, it's a conceit.
Now, on screen, flashy Robert Evans resurrects himself by spinning
his notion of the truth in "The Kid Stays in the Picture": "There are
three sides to every story: Yours, mine and the truth. No one is
lying. Memories shared serve differently."</TE>
<TE>   In the literary world, the very girding of the late W.G. Sebald's
award-winning "Austerlitz" is being contested by a woman, Susi
Bechhofer, whose journey toward self-identity after the Holocaust
("Rosa's Child," co-written with Jeremy Josephs and published by IB
Tauris &amp; Co. in 1996) became one of the models for his book. "I felt
once more that my identity had been usurped," she wrote in June in
the Sunday Times of London. "I have no wish to detract from the
masterpiece [he] has written. I just think 'Rosa's Child' should be
allowed to take a bow."</TE>
<TE>   Once a work debuts, it becomes all too clear that one person's
"total recall" is another's "inflation" or "pure invention." Flaps
erupt. Friendships falter. Family members are excised from wills.</TE>
<TE>   To help artists navigate the sensitivities, Zighelboim invited a
range of speakers: memoirist Hope Edelman ("Motherless Daughters,"
Perseus Books, 1994), playwright Nancy Balbirer ( "I Slept With Jack
Kerouac"), literary agent Betsy Amster, entertainment lawyer Gordon
Firemark, and Frier McCollister, who produces the radio commentaries
of writer Sandra Tsing Loh ("A Year in Van Nuys," Crown, 2001).</TE>
<TE>   The event's title, Zighelboim explained, was plucked from a 1931
California Appeals Court case--Melvin v. Reid--that involved a female
prostitute who was charged with murder. She was tried and acquitted
in 1918. Seven years later the film "The Red Kimona" (a.k.a. Kimono)
was made, using her name and details from her life and the case. She
sued the filmmakers and won. The court, Zighelboim says, "found that
she had a right to live in seclusion after that. She had a right to
protect that privacy. That case became one of the landmark cases for
privacy in California."</TE>
<TE>   Zighelboim and Firemark broke down the basics: What is libel? What
is slander? What's a publication? What is defamation? What is highly
offensive? Who is a reasonable person? What or who is considered
newsworthy? What is actionable? Then they guided the gathering
through the marshiness of what is public and what is private: "Does
the Constitution mention a right to privacy?" queried Zighelboim.
"That's a trick question. The U.S. doesn't. California does." It was
up to the writers and agents to explore what happens when the process
of reanimating the past on the page--for the world to see--comes
bundled with something more than catharsis. As Firemark had
suggested, it isn't always legal wranglings that vex storytellers but
subtler issues--ethical choices and living with them.</TE>
<TE>   Edelman, the memoirist, has become a bit of an expert navigating
touchy territory. "Most of my writing is about my mother and
grandmother. And I'm lucky that they are dead," she explained in a
tone more pragmatic than pointed. "It is my understanding that dead
people can't be libeled." But those who are living have expressed
their unease and displeasure. She suffered silences from aunts who
disputed her version and strained relations with her father, who
worried about being under such a public microscope.</TE>
<TE>   She often talks about this in the creative nonfiction classes she
has taught at Antioch University L.A. "The No. 1 question I get from
students writing memoirs is: Should I change the name? My answer is:
If you're worried. Go ahead. That's easy to do without compromising
the story. But you have to be careful sometimes when you start
changing too many details, it moves memoir closer to fiction."</TE>
<TE>   Playwright Balbirer is in the midst of just this dilemma. In "I
Slept With Jack Kerouac," her one-woman play, one character she
portrays, "Aunt Betsy" is based on her real Aunt Betsy, who "had a
fairly profound weight problem," Balbirer explained. While the play
enjoyed good West Coast reviews, Aunt Betsy was flattered to be the
muse and model, a character that was warmly received in the press.
But now that the play is poised for a run on the East Coast, closer
to her home, Betsy has gone from honored to horrified. "She's afraid
that people would put two and two together," Balbirer explained.
Betsy made suggestions--notes. "How about Bitsy? Bootsy?" Ultimately,
she pulled her trump card. "She told me it was illegal."</TE>
<TE>   At first, Balbirer felt hurt. Then she was shocked. "I wrote it
with a great amount of affection," she said. "But now she is so
shamed." And there are other complications. "I'm not just the writer
but the actor. A lot of people are under the misconception that to be
a good actor means you have to be a really good liar. But in fact
that is completely wrong. To be a really good actor you have to be
exceptionally good at telling the truth under imaginary
circumstances."</TE>
<TE>   Which is why she feels torn. "I sort of birthed this character....
I don't want to hurt [Betsy], but I don't want to perpetuate this
dysfunction," the impulse to control, the secret keeping. " ... So
I'm not sure how I'm going to handle it."</TE>
<TE>   On the other end of the spectrum, Sandra Tsing Loh, to hear
McCollister relate it, is blessed with a family with thick skin. Her
spiky portraits, often played for humor, about her father's temper,
insensitivity and cheapness (his briefcase, she says, is made out of
a Frosted Flakes box), have not only not offended him but made him a
star in his own right. "Her father has become a cult celebrity. He
shows up in his Chinese regalia and signs autographs himself."</TE>
<TE>   Since most publishers know that people aren't generally as casual
about such matters as Loh's father, Amster, the agent, says that each
house has its own way of dealing with what might come up after a
public revelation--and particular ways of circumventing problems.
Some authors draw up releases for friends and family to sign. Some
houses may ask for notes. However, recalled Amster, the lawyers she's
dealt with "were careful but not capricious .... I don't have any
horror stories to tell."</TE>
<TE>   While McCollister's advice to Balbirer would be to follow her best
instincts as an artist, Firemark cautioned that publishers are indeed
getting more and more gun-shy. And, he acknowledged, "There is a
psychological toll on you as an artist. On the work. No matter which
way you choose."</TE>
<TE>   That can be addressed, Edelman suggests, with honesty, and by
thinking about what's really motivating the telling of a story. "I
see students who come in and they are writing from a place of anger,
not distance. And it's important to portray characters as balanced
individuals." Perspective, she noted, often comes with time.</TE>
<TE>   Truth can be factual and emotional. And while memoir is an
interpretation of an event, it also provides a well of rich
narrative, conflict and psychological motivation. It is also
therapeutic. But remember, Edelman offered with a seen-it-all pause,
"People who have been wronged often end up in memoir classes."</TE>
<TE>   The moving pens took that down, too.</TE>

<DL>MANZANAR, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Frank Hays, superintendent of Manzanar National Historic Site, walks
carefully among sage and fallen leaves, near an area where Japanese
American orphans were confined during World War II. He stops and
reaches for something on the ground. "A marble," he says.</LD>
<LD>   He hands it to Alisa Lynch, his colleague with the National Park
Service, who holds it in her palm. It is dull and chipped, warm from
the sun. She studies it briefly then returns it to the ground, where
stories live, and covers it with sand.</LD>
<LD>   The orphans, some as young as 6 months old, were among 11,000
people held at the Manzanar Relocation Center, located in the high
desert 212 miles northeast of Los Angeles. In all, there were 10 such
camps, confining about 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry living on
the West Coast.</LD>
<TE>   Little remains of Manzanar. Like the concrete foundations, ceramic
chips and rusted nails scattered throughout, the marble is a small
part of a story that is not simply told.</TE>
<TE>   "There's some controversy within the Japanese American community
over what the camp really was all about," says Lynch, chief of
interpretation at the site. "For some people, it was the most
devastating experience of their lives. A hundred and forty-three
people died here. In some camps, there were suicides. Then there were
people who learned their professions here, who met their mates here.
There were 541 babies born here."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the controversy addresses terminology. Was Manzanar an
"internment camp," "relocation center," "concentration camp?" Were
those who were forced to live there "internees" or "prisoners"?</TE>
<TE>   For a year and a half, the National Park Service has been
gathering information, creating focus groups and conducting meetings
around the state to determine how the story should be presented in
exhibits at the camp's new interpretation center. (The center, along
with administrative offices, will be housed in the old high school
auditorium, which is being restored. The $5-million project is
scheduled for completion next year.) On Saturday, Lynch will travel
to Los Angeles to gather the opinions and impressions of the project
from area Japanese Americans with ties to Manzanar.</TE>
<TE>   Planners want to take into account the tremendous social,
religious and political diversity among those interned. They were
Buddhist, Catholic and Protestants; issei, nisei and sansei (first,
second and third generations in America) of varying political beliefs
and alliances.</TE>
<TE>   They were as diverse as Manzanar itself. Located in the Owens
Valley, the site is part of Inyo County, which includes most of Death
Valley National Park as well as 14,495-foot Mt. Whitney in the Sierra
Nevada range. The seasonal range of temperatures can be more than 110
degrees.</TE>
<TE>   In other ways, too, Manzanar is a place of contrast. National Park
Service exhibits will describe how the area was inhabited by members
of the Owens Valley Paiute dates back centuries. In the 1800s,
ranches were homesteaded, and on July 11, 1863, about 1,000 Paiute
were herded almost 200 miles to Sebastian Indian Reservation near
Fort Tejon in response to confrontations with white settlers.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1900s, the area was subdivided and the town of
Manzanar was founded. An orchard community developed until the city
of Los Angeles bought the land for water rights. The federal
government leased the property from the city during the war to build
the camp.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to the government guns pointed at the Paiute, marching
them away, the government guns of World War II were pointed at those
of Japanese descent, forcing them to stay.</TE>
<TE>   In a matter of months after the camps were mandated by executive
order on Feb. 19, 1942, Manzanar became the most populated community
between Los Angeles and Reno.</TE>
<TE>   There were eight guard towers surrounding 36 residential blocks,
each with 14 barracks as well as communal facilities. The camps were
intended to be as self-sufficient as possible, so, in time, there
were churches and schools, a 250-bed hospital, bank, catalog store
and a newspaper known as the Manzanar Free Press. Internees built
parks and gardens, an outdoor theater and recreational facilities
including a nine-hole golf course. There were chicken and hog
operations, a garment factory, and a food-processing unit that
produced shoyu (soy sauce), bean sprouts and tofu.</TE>
<TE>   In its first year of operation 700 tons of vegetables were
harvested from the farming operation.</TE>
<TE>   Manzanar evolved quickly during its three years. Wallboard and
linoleum were installed in barracks. Security became less stringent.
What remained constant was the fact that most of the internees were
American-born citizens, and those who weren't were subject to laws
prohibiting naturalization.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, survivors were issued redress checks for $20,000 and
received an apology signed by President George Bush. The country's
response to injustice, reparations, says Lynch, are at the heart of
her work at the site. "Part of it was paying redress. Part of it was
the apology, and now part of it is to say that on top of those
things, we're going to preserve this place and we're going to make
sure we tell the story of what happened here."</TE>
<TE>   But it may not be one story at all, she says. Perhaps Manzanar is
a place of many stories. In addition to a documentary, photographs, a
chronology of events and glossary, the exhibits are expected to
reflect personal accounts of some of those interned and, perhaps, at
least one who refused to go: Hideo Murata of Pismo Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Murata was a United States World War I veteran who, rather than be
interned, committed suicide. The book "Years of Infamy," by Michi
Weglyn (Morrow Quill Paperbacks, 1976) describes how he was found
dead clutching an honorary citizenship certificate in one hand.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the story of the late Ralph Lazo, of Mexican and
Irish descent. When he discovered, at age 16, that buddies from his
Bunker Hill neighborhood were being sent to Manzanar, he went with
them. Lazo later served in the Army and received a Bronze Star.</TE>
<TE>   Blue-star banners were displayed on barracks of those with family
members in the military. Gold-star banners were given to the families
of those who died. The Munemoris had one of each.</TE>
<TE>   Sadao Munemori of the famed 442nd Combat Team was awarded the
Medal of Honor for his heroic acts in Italy. Munemori sacrificed his
life by throwing himself on an enemy grenade, saving the lives of two
comrades; and, as he fought, his family was confined at Manzanar.</TE>
<TE>   48-Hour Notice</TE>
<TE>   Each person who entered Manzanar has a story to tell, and many of
those stories will be written on name tags given to visitors to
describe how individual lives were affected during the war.</TE>
<TE>   Wilbur Sato's story begins a couple months after Pearl Harbor was
bombed, when at age 12 he was escorted from the principal's office to
his locker to gather his possessions and then out of the school he
was attending on Terminal Island.</TE>
<TE>   Those of Japanese ancestry were given 48 hours to leave the
island, he says, so his family rented a house owned by friends in
Boyle Heights, and he began attending a different school. It seemed
as if they were going to stay, he says. They hung pictures on the
wall, but then Executive Order 9066, establishing the camps, was
signed into law by President Roosevelt.</TE>
<TE>   The period before their departure for Manzanar seems a blur, he
says. They were packing their possessions for storage and preparing
to leave. His parents were "enthusiastic" about going, he says, as it
enabled them to demonstrate their loyalty to the United States. His
mother was a volunteer in the Women's Auxiliary Army Corps. Sato
arrived at Manzanar in early April wearing his Sunday best.</TE>
<TE>   On April 26, his 13th birthday, his mother surprised him. Despite
all that weighed on her before leaving home, he says, she had
remembered to buy him a gift. Sato collected stamps, and his mother
had taken time to buy new ones to add to his collection.</TE>
<TE>   From that moment, the collection he once loved has served only as
a reminder of Manzanar. "I could never stand to look at the stamps
after that," he says. "I still have them somewhere, but I can't look
at them."</TE>
<TE>   His memories of being rounded up and imprisoned fill him with a
sense of loss, he says. "You lose your sense of identity. You're made
to feel that you're not American anymore."</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many stories," says William Michael, director of
library and museum services for Inyo County and also a member of the
advisory commission charged with helping decide what the exhibits
should reflect.</TE>
<TE>   "The history of prejudice against Asians in this country has to be
a part of this story, the laws that did not allow Japanese to
naturalize and become citizens or own land. That has to be told to
give the context of how easy it was to take 120,000 people and put
them into camps."</TE>
<TE>   A Sense of Sadness</TE>
<TE>   Sue Kunitomi Embrey was 19 years old in 1942, when her family
traveled by train then bus from Los Angeles to Manzanar, arriving in
darkness. Her brother had volunteered to help set up the camp and was
there to greet them. He had prepared their bedding, so they did not
have to stand in line and stuff their canvas mattresses with hay that
first night.</TE>
<TE>   "We were lucky," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Embrey chaired the Manzanar Historical Site Advisory Commission
and is co-founder/chairperson of the Manzanar Committee, which
sponsors an annual pilgrimage to the camp.</TE>
<TE>   Whenever she returns, she says, it is with a sense of sadness.
Sometimes it's as if she has traveled back through time, and voices
are just beyond her reach. She can almost hear music and
shouting--confusion--and, from the shade of an apple tree bearing
sweet fruit, the hushed sobs of her mother.</TE>
<TE>   Although it is a place of long ago, Manzanar still lives inside of
her. She remembers how she and her friend each night after dinner
would walk around the inside of the five-strand barbed-wired fence
surrounding the camp, talking about freedom and dreams and all the
things teenagers talk about. And she remembers her mother telling her
years later how, for weeks after they arrived at Manzanar, she would
go to the apple orchard, where she could be alone, and cry.</TE>
<TE>   A Record, a Responsibility</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit likely will include photographs taken by the late Toyo
Miyatake, who had a studio in Little Tokyo before the war. When he
and his family were held, he sneaked a camera lens and film holder
into Manzanar.</TE>
<TE>   Archie Miyatake, his oldest son, was 17 at the time. He remembers
awakening after his first night in the camp, looking down at his bed
and seeing the outline of his head in a layer of sand that blew in
during the night through cracks in the floor.</TE>
<TE>   He was outside one day when his father, a friend of master
photographer Edward Weston, called him inside.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me to sit down, and I was wondering what I had done
wrong," Archie Miyatake says. "He said, 'As a photographer, I have a
responsibility. I have to record what's going on in camp so this type
of thing will never happen again.' "</TE>
<TE>   A carpenter built a wooden box for the camera, a friend in auto
maintenance connected the lens to a piece of pipe, and soon
Miyatake's father was documenting life inside the camp.</TE>
<TE>   He eventually received permission to take pictures--as long as a
Caucasian person was there to release the shutter. Over time, he was
allowed to push the button himself, as long as he was accompanied by
a Caucasian person. Then, finally, camp officials allowed him to work
alone.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, the Miyatakes returned to Los Angeles and opened
their doors to many former internees who had nowhere to stay.
Eventually Archie Miyatake took over his father's studio and moved it
to San Gabriel. His two sons also are photographers.</TE>
<TE>   When he thinks back to his time spent at Manzanar, Archie Miyatake
thinks about the injustice, the feelings of longing as he stood
inside the fence watching cars drive to and from a small, nearby town
called Independence.</TE>
<TE>   But it was also at Manzanar, at a dance, that he met his future
wife. Life did not stop, he says, and most people tried to make the
most of it. He was drawn to the mountains that cast long shadows late
in the day, and when darkness came, he sometimes escaped to them and
waited for daylight to search for trout in deep pools and for lost
feelings of peace and freedom.</TE>
<TE>   Memories of Children</TE>
<TE>   All but a few of the approximately 800 structures at Manzanar were
removed after the war. Remaining, in addition to the auditorium, are
two sentry posts in front and in back, a cemetery monument where
visitors leave everything from flowers and paper cranes to articles
of clothing and, on one occasion, a tape of the Grateful Dead.</TE>
<TE>   A mess hall moved to the Bishop airport after the war will be
returned as part of a demonstration block. Plans call for recreating
a guard tower and refurbishing some gardens so visitors will have an
understanding of what it was like.</TE>
<TE>   But beyond the exhibits and what remains, some stories will remain
buried in the ground. Tamotsu Isozaki, 76, of Monterrey Park lived in
the Manzanar orphanage known as Children's Village, home to about 100
children.</TE>
<TE>   They came from Alaska, Washington Oregon and California, most of
them from orphanages or foster homes; and although they attended
school with the other children at Manzanar, they lived in their own
barracks, one for girls and one for boys, and had their own mess
hall.</TE>
<TE>   He remembers how a volunteer, Sohei Hohri, who had just graduated
from Manzanar High School, would tell them stories from memory that
would continue for weeks, among them Homer's "The Odyssey" and Victor
Hugo's "Les Miserables."</TE>
<TE>   They would listen carefully, says Isozaki, and just when the story
reached an exciting crescendo, Hohri, now 77 and retired after 31
years as curator at a private maritime museum in New York, would end
the episode, causing them to wait another day for the story to
resume. In such manner, time--and war--passed.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it was because of their youth, or maybe it had to do with
being orphans. Uncertainty was not new to them, he says, and they
were blessed with an ability to be easily distracted in a way that
most adults were not.</TE>
<TE>   Isozaki remembers that they played basketball and baseball, and a
game called Prisoner of War, where if you left your home base, you
were subject to imprisonment by the opposing team. And sometimes he
could forget what was happening in his life and in the world by
simply sitting upon the ground, drawing a circle in the sand and
grasping a shiny marble in his hand.</TE>
<TE>   Preliminary plans for the Manzanar interpretation center exhibits
will be available for review and comment 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday
at the Japanese American National Museum, 369 E. 1st St., Little
Tokyo in downtown L.A. They also will be displayed 6-8 p.m. Tuesday
at the American Legion Hall in Independence, near Manzanar.</TE>

<BD>TIME STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Sanford is an authentic hero of American letters. His more than
20 books, though still too infrequently appreciated, are among its
treasures.</LD>
<LD>   More remarkable yet, the Santa Barbara-based writer, who is now in
his 99th year, still is adding to a body of work whose formal bravura
and lyric prose are nearly without parallel in contemporary
literature.</LD>
<LD>   His latest book, "A Palace of Silver," will be published in March
by Capra Press. Like so much of his later work, it defies generic
boundaries. It is at once a memoir and a meditation on his 50 years
of marriage to screenwriter Marguerite Roberts, who died a decade
ago.</LD>
<TE>   Its title is drawn from a verse in the Song of Solomon: "We will
build upon her a palace of silver." The Sanfords' marriage, in fact,
was a kind of palace built upon what might have been the ruins of
careers cut short by the Hollywood blacklist.</TE>
<TE>   Sanford was already a Communist Party member when he and his
friend Nathanael West arrived in Hollywood in the 1930s. Sanford also
was a critically acclaimed novelist, whose first book--"A Man Without
Shoes"--had been published in 1933 with a blurb from Carl Sandburg.</TE>
<TE>   In Hollywood, Sanford met and married Roberts, then one of the
industry's most successful contract screenwriters. She became the
emotional, aesthetic and financial supporter of his work.</TE>
<TE>   Partly out of solidarity, partly to smooth their social life
together, Roberts became a Communist, too. Neither adhered very
closely to the party line.</TE>
<TE>   When Sanford's now classic anti-racist novel, "The People From
Heaven"--recently reissued by the University of Illinois Press as
part of its series, "The Radical Novel Reconsidered"--was published
in 1943, William Carlos Williams and Orson Welles praised it; the
party denounced it as "antisocial."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the couple were subpoenaed to appear before the House
Un-American Activities Committee.</TE>
<TE>   They refused to name names. She lost her job and was blacklisted.
Both their passports were seized, foreclosing the possibility of work
abroad. It would be 10 years before she worked again. That fraught
interregnum--its mutual support, its separate suffering and Sanford's
torment over the calamity into which he had drawn her--is the central
room in "A Palace of Silver."</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the stuff I've written in the past 15 years is about my
wife," Sanford said this week. "She is more than my muse; she is my
subject. Those were tremendously difficult times for my wife.</TE>
<TE>   "She was at the height of her career as a screenwriter at Metro.
Then along came the committee. We were Communists. The informants
told the truth about that, at least," he said. "We were called and
refused to name names. The studio terminated her contract that day.</TE>
<TE>   "She joined the party for me," Sanford said, "and, unfortunately,
I didn't make any attempt to stop her. She wasn't a revolutionary.
She was a nice, liberal lady, who believed in decency and reform. It
cost her dearly and my punishment was second only to hers. She
suffered greatly and spoke not one word of recrimination to me in
those 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   "She used to say, 'Don't blame yourself, Johnny,' and she meant
it. But that didn't spare me from the feelings I've set down in that
book."</TE>
<TE>   Aesthetic and political radicalism notwithstanding, there is a
sturdy, old-fashioned virtue at the heart of Sanford's project: It is
sincerity--a sincerity so serious and complete that it stands as a
kind of reproach to the current vogue for confessional memoirs.</TE>
<TE>   That was one of the qualities that attracted Capra's new owner,
bookseller Robert Bason. He offered Sanford the revived press' first
contract after purchasing Capra from the family of its late founder,
Noel Young, in November. "A Palace of Silver" is one of the first
three books Capra will bring out in March.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is an absolutely wonderful work," said Richard Barre,
Capra's associate publisher. "John is so rare and open. It's as if
his marriage was a room in which he lived. Parts of it were untidy,
parts were pretty spiffed up, but he welcomes you into it all. It's
as if he's saying, 'Here's who I am and welcome to it.' The amazing
thing is that there is nothing self-serving in any of it. He takes
his work immensely seriously, but not himself."</TE>
<TE>   Capra, Barre said, also is looking forward to publishing the book
on which Sanford even now is at work. "John is a world unto himself,"
he said. "He just keeps writing and writing. It doesn't matter what
time of the day or night you talk to him, he's working. From what
he's told me, this new book is about three people he used to know and
the blacklist," Barre said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm writing about it at this very moment," Sanford said. Though
his eyes are failing, the new book--like all his others--is being
written on a battered old Royal typewriter.</TE>
<TE>   "Nowadays," he chuckled, "I'm a bit of an old Royal, myself."</TE>
<TE>   Work in Progress</TE>
<TE>   Debora Silverman, who holds the President's Chair in Modern
European History, Art and Culture at UCLA, is the author of numerous
works of art history, most recently, "Van Gogh and Gauguin: The
Search for Sacred Art":</TE>
<TE>   "Actually, I am starting a new project on the Belgian avant-garde
in the 1880s and 1890s. I am interested in the way it mixed urban
change, socialist politics and Symbolism as an artistic movement.</TE>
<TE>   "In the rest of Europe, Symbolism was aesthetic, mystical and
anti-modern, rejecting politics. But in the Belgian case, artists
were not in flight from politics, but deeply engaged. My thesis is
that Belgium in the 1880s was like France in the 1830s, a time when
the arts there were completely politicized by Romanticism--a movement
that, in the rest of Europe, was associated with the rejection of
politics.</TE>
<TE>   "In Belgium during the 1880s and '90s, all the radical artists
were socialists struggling for universal suffrage. Everyone in the
entire bourgeois elite became radicalized, creating a complex mix of
art, politics and social change. It's very rich stuff. What you had
was an urban elite trying to carve out a new national Belgian
identity and politics through art and culture. The result was a
unique hothouse of cultural innovation."</TE>

<LD>These are the opening paragraphs of John Sanford's forthcoming book,
"A Palace of Silver":</LD>
<LD>   Near one end of the Santa Barbara beach rises a hill called
Bellosgarda, and spreading over its grounds is a cemetery. From the
grounds, no part of the city can be seen; the view is of mountains
inland and the Channel seaward, an expanse of some twenty miles to a
chain of islands lying lavender along the horizon. Here and there, a
cypress casts a filigree of shadow on the grass, and down in the
hollows live oaks grow. Headstones are few, the new custom being a
tablet of metal or marble set flush with the sward, and rows of these
curve with the fluted contour of the hill. Roadways wind through the
reserve and lay out irregular divisions, one of which runs along a
cliff rearing from the water's edge. This land's-end place seems to
be bounded only by sea and sky, and what sound can be heard there is
the wind, the surf, and, if rain has fallen, the shrill of
shore-birds come to probe the softened earth.</LD>
<LD>   In one of the rows close to the cliff-face, a bronze plaque
carries this inscription:</LD>
<TE>   MARGUERITE</TE>
<TE>   A. SANFORD</TE>
<TE>   1905-1989</TE>
<TE>   JOHN SANFORD</TE>
<TE>   1904-</TE>
<TE>   Ten years have passed since it was embedded in her grave, and its
components of copper, tin, and zinc have begun to give it a dapple of
brown and green. In days to come, this will deepen almost to the
color of the turf, and by then you too will be under the memorial,
and it will be others, if others ever come here, who remark on the
patina and read the mottled names. Ten years have passed.</TE>

<LD>Old Crabby came to stand beside Jason. "So," she scolded, "you'd
rather play the piano than work."</LD>
<LD>   Jason dipped the cloth in the creamy wax and kept polishing. He
didn't dare stop for fear she would fire him.</LD>
<LD>   "No, ma'am. I mean, I never played a piano before. I sure like the
way it sounds."</LD>
<TE>   Old Crabby sat down on the piano bench and patted the place beside
her.</TE>
<TE>   "Leave off the polishing for a moment," she said. "Would you like
to know how the sound is made?"</TE>
<TE>   Jason could hardly breathe. "Yes, please," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The keys are actually levers that are attached to little felt
hammers," she explained. "When you press a key, the hammer strikes a
steel wire. That's what makes the sound. The sound is high or low
depending on the length and thickness of the wire and how tightly
it's strung. Understand?"</TE>
<TE>   "I think so," said Jason.</TE>
<TE>   He reached out a finger and touched a key. He grinned.</TE>
<TE>   Her face crinkled in what might have been a smile. "Maybe you'd
like to learn to play 'Chopsticks.' It only takes two fingers."</TE>
<TE>   Jason was soon belting out "Chopsticks." "Sure wish Pete were
here," he yelled above the noise. "I'm actually playing the piano!"</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, you are," agreed Old Crabby. "But let's try a scale. Play
with your fingertips. Keep your hands high. Don't let your wrists
drag."</TE>
<TE>   He did the best he could, and when he finished, she looked him
straight in the eye. "I have a proposition for you: If you come here
every day to help me around the house for two hours, you can pay for
the window, and I'll also give you piano lessons. How about it?"</TE>
<TE>   "Cool, Mrs. Crabb," said Jason. "Just let me practice 'Chopsticks'
a couple more times so I won't forget."</TE>
<TE>   He couldn't wait to show Pete how he could play the piano.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday: Jason starts piano lessons.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Louise Downer agrees with the Scottish historian and essayist
Thomas Carlyle, who said more than 100 years ago, "Music is well said

<DH>Still a practical car, the 2003 Accord also aims for those
who seek performance</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The guy in the brand-new Mercedes C-Class kept pulling up, then
dropping back, obviously eyeballing the car we were driving down the
Ventura Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   Finally he pulled up alongside, flashed a big grin and gave us a
hearty thumbs up.</LD>
<LD>   "Wow," my driving partner said. "It's not often you get a thumbs
up from a Mercedes driver when you're in a Honda."</LD>
<TE>   Wow, indeed.</TE>
<TE>   We were in the all-new 2003 Honda Accord, successor to what has
been the best-selling mid-size family car for nine of the last 10
years.</TE>
<TE>   Honda Motor Co. executives have promised all year that the new
Accord would represent the most radical model change ever for the
company. And though the words "radical" and "Honda" rarely go
together when it comes to styling, they weren't lying.</TE>
<TE>   The new Accord, which hits showrooms in September, is at once
sleeker and more muscular than its predecessor. It replaces a body
designed five years ago, when flat surfaces and hard edges were in
vogue, with all-new sheet metal that flows.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't sensuous--although the coupe version gets close--but it
is the best body ever on a mainstream Honda, and it puts to shame the
new Toyota Camry and Ford's positively geriatric Taurus, the other
perennial contenders in the family car segment.</TE>
<TE>   Honda didn't stop outside.</TE>
<TE>   The new Accord comes with two new engine choices, a 160-horsepower
inline-4 or a 240-horsepower V-6; three new transmission choices;
anti-lock brakes standard at all trim levels; an improved suspension
and steering setup; and a new interior that features more headroom
and legroom and redesigned front bucket seats that put the Accord at
the top of the class among Asian brands for comfort and support.</TE>
<TE>   In short, Honda's designers, engineers and product planners took
an already good model and made it better.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, the only potential problem I found during a day with the
cars in the mountains between Agoura Hills and Malibu was a somewhat
flimsy-feeling release mechanism on the capacious center storage bin
that might not last as long as the car does.</TE>
<TE>   Neat touches included water bottle holders in the sedan door
panels; flat passenger compartment and trunk floors in all models
(carpet underlayment fills the dips and hollows and has the
additional benefit of muffling road noise); and sufficient headroom
so that even in models with sunroofs, taller people can sit in the
front seats without planting chins on chests.</TE>
<TE>   Honda paid a lot of attention to wind noise, redesigning the side
mirrors and windshield pillars and increasing the slope of the
windshield to minimize air turbulence around side windows.</TE>
<TE>   The company also tightened its already impressive tolerances of
gaps between body panels, eliminating them altogether where fender
panels meet bumpers.</TE>
<TE>   The Accord's new instrument panel features a technology previously
seen only on luxury brands: The instruments are dark when the car is
empty and not in use, gradually growing brighter as doors open, the
key is turned and the engine ignited. Honda says it "welcomes" the
driver and other occupants by lighting up in sequence with their
preparations to get in and go.</TE>
<TE>   There's even an oversize sunglass holder, an acknowledgment that a
lot of people wear sporty goggle-type sunglasses that don't fit the
standard skinny Ray-Ban slots.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the more you pay, the better it is: The 2.3-liter,
four-cylinder models with five-speed automatic transmission are
adequate machines, and most Accord loyalists will love them
unreservedly. But they won't keep up with a similarly priced and
equipped Nissan Altima, with its heftier 2.5-liter, 180-horsepower
four-banger with 181 pound-feet of torque.</TE>
<TE>   Honda's five-speed manual helps a little, though, allowing the
driver to manage the Accord's 161 pound-feet of torque with more
precision than the automatic permits.</TE>
<TE>   And when pushed on curvy roads, the four-cylinder Accords tend to
be a little light in the stern, the rear trying to lift even after
the shocks and springs have reached their limits.</TE>
<TE>   The base level DX, which will be priced about $15,000 but which
Honda doesn't expect to be more than a blip on its sales charts,
doesn't have a rear sway bar.</TE>
<TE>   Honda engineers say they think the reason the V-6 models do what
the four-cylinder versions won't--sit tight and don't try to bounce
out of the curves when pressed to their limits--is the improved grip
and stance from their bigger tires.</TE>
<TE>   The four-cylinder DX and LX models come with 15-inch rubber, which
ratchets up to P205/60R16 on EX and all V-6 models except one.</TE>
<TE>   That one is the V-6 coupe with six-speed manual transmission, a
car that Honda calls the "ultimate Accord." It runs P215/50R17
rubber, and the smooth, short-throw six-speed coupled with the new
240-horsepower 3.0-liter engine makes it easy to smoke those tires at
will in first and second gear.</TE>
<TE>   Honda's V-6 is rated at 212 pound-feet of torque, which peaks at
5,000 rpm on an engine redlined at 6,700 rpm.</TE>
<TE>   The result is a machine that will let you commit multiple felonies
on the freeway if you don't watch the speedometer, that will climb
the steepest grades with ease and that does it all while inducing in
the driver an ear-to-ear grin.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Honda won't be bringing the V-6 six-speed coupe to
market in the U.S. until early next year, after the Sept. 9 launch of
the sedans and Sept. 13 launch of the other coupes.</TE>
<TE>   The goal in redoing Accord this time--it is the seventh generation
of a car introduced to the U.S. in 1976 as a three-door
hatchback--was to keep the Accord loyalist while bringing back the
passionate customer who falls for a car because of its looks and
performance.</TE>
<TE>   "We had the passionate customer 20 years ago," said Charlie Baker,
chief engineer for the '03 Accord. "Now we see them over at
Volkswagen, in the Passat."</TE>
<TE>   Accord has instead become the preferred car of those who shop for
safety, reliability, practicality and even environmental
friendliness.</TE>
<TE>   The '03 model, Baker and team hope, will attract from both sides
of the spectrum.</TE>
<TE>   But it is interesting to listen as they describe their baby. The
comparisons are most often to the Passat, sometimes to the redesigned
Altima--which is cutting a swath through the enthusiast buyer
camp--rarely to the Camry and never to the Taurus, which once led the
mid-size pack but now typically finishes in third place, because of
rental and corporate fleet sales as much as regular retail demand.</TE>
<TE>   The new Accord, Baker said, "is dedicated to the passionate
customer."</TE>
<TE>   Still, practicality will sell more Accords than passion, and the
Accord, in sedan or coupe, will remain a favorite with female
buyers--expected to account for 56% of the mix.</TE>
<TE>   Pricing in the four-cylinder family runs from $15,000 to $24,000,
while V-6 models will run from $22,000 to $26,000 (specific pricing
has not yet been announced).</TE>
<TE>   Honda expects new Accord buyers to be a little younger and a
little wealthier than in years past, with the typical sedan buyer
logging in at 46 and married with a $74,000 annual household income,
the typical coupe customer at 39, single and bringing in $69,000 a
year.</TE>
<TE>   Final words: Whether the motive is performance or reliability,
Honda Accord buyers won't be disappointed with the '03 models. If an
Accord wasn't already on your list of mid-size possibilities, it
should be added.</TE>

<HD>Spots in Many Off-Road Treks This Summer Still Are
Available</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Off-roaders who've opted to stay at home in this year of economic and
geopolitical uncertainty have created opportunities for those whose
late-planning habits often leave them locked out of popular events.</LD>
<LD>   Jack Raudy, chief executive of the California Assn. of Four Wheel
Drive Clubs, said many off-road programs, which usually are
completely booked by the time summer starts, still have openings.</LD>
<LD>   "I guess people are watching their money" in a year that has
turned the dot-com, energy trading and telecommunications booms to
busts for many, Raudy said.</LD>
<TE>   Among those with openings are several of the trips--some for
experienced rock crawlers, others for families with unmodified sport
utility vehicles--held during the association's annual Sierra Trek.
It is being held Aug. 8-11 at Meadow Lake, north of Truckee, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Reed, registration chairman for the events, is taking
registrations for a pair of one-day runs Aug. 10 on the challenging
Fordyce Creek Trail.</TE>
<TE>   One trip is for short-wheel-base vehicles such as Jeep Wranglers,
the other for four-wheel-drive vehicles with long wheel bases, such
as the Ford Expedition.</TE>
<TE>   There also are openings, Reed said, on two trips designed for
sport utility vehicles and their owners.</TE>
<TE>   The first SUV trip is scheduled for Aug. 8 and will take
participants to historic sites and places of interest near Lake
Tahoe.</TE>
<TE>   The second SUV tour, on Aug. 10, will include stops at gold rush
mining camps. SUVs must be four-wheel-drive vehicles with low range.</TE>
<TE>   Sierra Trek, the largest all-volunteer four-wheel-drive event in
the country, is expected to draw 1,500 participants. In addition to
the various four-wheel-drive trips, the Meadow Lake base camp plays
host to trade shows and family and children's events and provides
evening entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   The cost for the short- or long-wheel-base runs is $95 for adults
and $30 for children ages 7 to 12, with children younger than 7
admitted free. The cost includes all meals.</TE>
<TE>   The fee for either SUV trip is $105 for adults and $30 for
children ages 7 to 12, meals included.</TE>
<TE>   A specially discounted four-day program that includes both SUV
trips also is available.</TE>
<TE>   For more information on the Sierra Trek or to register for any of
the trips, call Reed at (925) 447-3142 or e-mail sierratrek@attbi.
.com.</TE>
<TE>   For information about other four-wheel-drive programs, the
association, reachable by phone at (800) 494-3866, lists member
clubs' events calendars on the Internet at

<HD>For a Growing Luxury Market, a New, Grand Touring Bentley</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>The newest addition to the Bentley lineup is a powerful four-seater
sports car that the luxury auto maker hopes will radically change the
brand's global image.</LD>
<LD>   The Bentley Grand Touring coupe, or the GT coupe as it is being
called for now, is scheduled to come to market in Europe next year
and arrive in North America in November 2003.</LD>
<LD>   With a 6-liter, 12-cylinder engine pumping out more than 500
horsepower, it will reach speeds of 180 mph and be the most powerful
Bentley ever.</LD>
<TE>   The GT coupe will be the first Bentley to bow after Rolls-Royce
splits off from the company Jan. 1 to become part of BMW of Germany.
The newly named Bentley Motors Inc. will remain under the ownership
of BMW rival Volkswagen.</TE>
<TE>   "People in the past might have confused a Bentley with a
Rolls-Royce, but once the GT coupe comes out on the market, people
will see Bentley in its own right as a pure performance car," said
John Crawford of Rolls-Royce &amp; Bentley Motor Cars Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "Rolls-Royce is a car you're driven in," Crawford said. "Bentley
is a car you drive."</TE>
<TE>   Bentley, Rolls-Royce, DaimlerChrysler and Bugatti all are
preparing to introduce super-expensive, super-luxury cars for which
they say there is a growing market around the world.</TE>
<TE>   "Even with our current product, there are around 7 million people
in our target group who have the financial means to be able to afford
one of our cars," said Adrian Hallmark, Bentley's board member for
marketing.</TE>
<TE>   The GT coupe is expected to be priced at $140,000 to $150,000.</TE>

<HD>Hesitation May Be Due to Wet Computer</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: My 1998 Nissan Altima hesitates and sometimes is difficult
to start. I have an independent mechanic who looked over the car. On
the day he checked it, the problem was not occurring. He said he
performed a complete fuel and ignition system check. I'm baffled and
not sure what I should do.</LD>
<LD>   --S.K.</LD>
<LD>   Answer: A drivability problem like what you describe can be caused
by many things, both in the electrical system and in the fuel system.
Your car's on-board diagnostic system should be recording error codes
that could help in figuring out what's going wrong.</LD>
<TE>   One possibility that Nissan has identified involves water that can
leak into the car's main electronic control module. The company has
issued a technical service bulletin, reported by automotive publisher
Alldata, warning of a problem similar to what you describe.</TE>
<TE>   The problem begins with debris blowing into the car's ventilation
ducts and contaminating the air-conditioning evaporator equipment
under the dashboard. The evaporator is what produces cold air, and it
also generates a substantial amount of condensation, just as any air
conditioner does.</TE>
<TE>   The system has a drip pan and a drain tube to remove the water and
dump it under the car. That's why you often see water puddles under a
parked vehicle after its air conditioner has been running.</TE>
<TE>   The service bulletin warns that debris can plug the drain tube and
allow water to spill onto the electronic control module, which is the
engine's central computer for controlling many functions. Wet
computers are really bad news.</TE>
<TE>   Such blocked tubes normally spill out quite a bit of water, so if
a blocked drain tube is your problem, you'll probably find that your
carpeting also is wet.</TE>
<TE>   Nissan advises mechanics to clean out the debris and dry off the
carpeting. A new module also may be needed.</TE>
<TE>   Shifting Problem Could Be Sign of Dirty Fluid</TE>
<TE>   Q: My 1998 Volvo S70 seems to be shifting harshly, more so than in
the past. It has 62,000 miles on it. I don't know if the transmission
is failing or what, but my regular mechanic said he didn't think it
was anything serious. Can you please advise?</TE>
<TE>   --G.S.</TE>
<TE>   A: The problem could be as simple as dirty automatic transmission
fluid, which can cause hard shifting, particularly when the
transmission locks up in certain gears.</TE>
<TE>   The fluid is supposed to be red or reddish brown. If it is pink or
cloudy, that probably means it has become contaminated with engine
coolant. If that's the case, then the job will get more expensive.</TE>
<TE>   Engine coolant typically leaks into the transmission fluid at the
radiator, which provides cooling for both the transmission fluid and
the engine coolant. Volvo advises replacing the radiator, the
transmission oil cooler and the connecting hoses.</TE>
<TE>   The job also requires that the transmission be flushed numerous
times to purge any residual engine coolant. The cost is going to be
shocking. The radiator retails for about $550, though the part is
available at discount for a few hundred dollars less. There is a
substantial amount of labor, so hold on to your wallet.</TE>
<TE>   Puzzling Over Pair of Unmatched Tires</TE>
<TE>   Q: After recently purchasing two tires for my Nissan Pathfinder, I
discovered that their circumference differs by 1.5 inches. How could
this happen, and is it a problem?</TE>
<TE>   --W.T.</TE>
<TE>   A: The situation is unusual, though it also seems unusual for a
person to check the circumference of tires. I admire the attention to
detail.</TE>
<TE>   Assuming the tires are the same model and brand and have the same
air pressure, it appears a manufacturing defect was involved.</TE>
<TE>   The difference in circumference is enough to raise safety concerns
regarding braking, traction and transmission wear. You could try to
fiddle with the air pressure to obtain a uniform circumference, but
that is fraught with safety issues also. I suggest you return the
tires to the dealer and ask for a different brand under a warranty
replacement.</TE>

<HD>Impersonating an Officer Could Be Costly in Los Angeles</HD>
<DH>Television* Unlike in the days of 'Dragnet,' two new shows
may be charged licensing fees to use the LAPD name.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANA CALVO and RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a break with tradition, City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo has asked the
networks that will air two new L.A.-based police TV shows to pay
licensing fees or risk legal action, saying the city in the past has
"basically been lazy about its intellectual property" rights under
trademark law.</LD>
<LD>   Representatives from CBS and NBC say that although the fictional
characters in the new prime-time shows are clearly Los Angeles Police
Department officers, they will not flash the real badge or logo and
therefore don't have to pay to license the rights to those symbols.
Both networks have already sold commercial airtime to advertisers for
the shows, so a legal glitch with either series could have serious
financial implications. Representatives of the attorney's office have
declined to say what kind of action it might take or what it is
asking for.</LD>
<LD>   And while the networks rely on municipal cooperation for shooting
permits, neither wants to be obligated to answer to the department
for their depictions of officers. "We really want to be able to shoot
in L.A., but this makes it difficult," said Mark Graboff, executive
vice president of West Coast for NBC, which will air "Boomtown" in
the fall, "and this kind of behavior will drive shows out of L.A."</LD>
<TE>   The LAPD finds itself a long way from old series like "Adam 12"
and "Dragnet," which were virtual public relations machines for the
department.</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo characterized the discussions with NBC as having an
"adversarial manner," when compared with those with producers for
CBS' new drama "Robbery, Homicide Division," which was created by
director Michael Mann. "Boomtown" is produced by NBC Studios and
DreamWorks.</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo's request comes amid renewed sensitivity at the LAPD to
its national reputation in the wake of the Rampart Division's
corruption scandal. Although it did not involve the LAPD, last
month's beating of a handcuffed teenager by an Inglewood police
officer stirred memories of the beating of Rodney G. King by LAPD
officers whose initial acquittal in that case sparked the 1992 riots.
FX's "The Shield" was originally called "Rampart," but the producers
changed the title at the LAPD's request.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to find that reasonable place between creativity
and representation of the LAPD in such a way that it does not damage
our image and reputation," said Los Angeles Police Cmdr. Gary
Brennan.</TE>
<TE>   Police dramas in New York, like ABC's "NYPD Blue," have not had to
deal with City Hall about licensing or trademarks, according to Bill
Clark, a former New York detective for 25 years who is a writer and a
technical advisor on the long-running drama.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing they've asked us is that we don't designate a real
precinct number as our number," Clark said "We use 15, and there is
no 15th Precinct."</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD applied in 1999 for the trademark of the badge and logo,
according to the LAPD, at about the same time its private but
quasi-official sister organization that operates some facilities at
the Police Academy, the Los Angeles Police Revolver and Athletic
Club, applied for a trademark in connection with the sales of
athletic wear and uniforms that denote LAPD.</TE>

<HD>'Early' Stumps CBS-- Again</HD>
<DH>Television* As potential hosts try out to replace Bryant
Gumbel, questions of format dog the process.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Vintage bands Chicago and Foreigner have played; Harry Smith and
Deborah Norville have been anchoring. Viewers of CBS' "The Early
Show" might understandably be feeling they are in a time warp this
summer.</LD>
<LD>   It's been two months since co-host Bryant Gumbel left "The Early
Show," and what at first seemed likely to be a quick process to find
his replacement has now bogged down in what appears to be one of CBS
News' every-few-years exercises in attempting to put together a
durable morning program that can challenge NBC's top-rated "Today"
show and second-place rival ABC's "Good Morning America."</LD>
<LD>   Gumbel and co-host Jane Clayson had anchored the show's most
recent iteration since 1999, making it more competitive, particularly
among younger viewers, but still failing to lift the program from a
distant third.</LD>
<TE>   After Meredith Vieira balked at leaving ABC's "The View" for CBS,
the network began rotating possible new hosts through the anchor
chair, including Tom Bergeron of "Hollywood Squares," Josh Binswanger
of the History Channel and CBS White House correspondent John
Roberts. More recently, however, the chair has been occupied by
Norville, the host of "Inside Edition" who is best known for her year
anchoring NBC's "Today"--in 1990. Smith, who now is host of A&amp;E's
"Biography," is filling in this week, returning to a job he held from
1987 until he and then co-host Paula Zahn were dismissed in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   CBS executives insist there is a lot of activity taking place
behind the scenes, even if it appears that the process has stalled.
One contender, Russ Mitchell, anchor of the show's Saturday edition,
just got additional duties as a "CBS Sunday Morning" correspondent,
taking him out of the running for the weekday job. Lyne Pitts, who
had been the show's executive producer before taking an extended
medical leave this spring, will return Tuesday, reporting to senior
executive producer Michael Bass.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, executives say, making the right decision is much more
important than making a quick one.</TE>
<TE>   Still, each month--or even each year--that CBS fails to come up
with a winning combination leaves it more vulnerable to the
competition. In the last year, Fox News Channel's "Fox &amp; Friends,"
with an irreverent, occasionally nasty format akin to radio's
"morning zoo," has more than doubled its audience, attracting about
723,000 viewers on average each morning in July. CNN has had more
modest success starting a more traditional morning program; "American
Morning With Paula Zahn" averaged about 441,000 viewers in July. CBS'
program drew 2.32 million viewers on average for the first three
weeks of July, up slightly from last summer.</TE>
<TE>   Another casualty of the drawn-out process could be Clayson, who
has been left in limbo while CBS debates the show's future.</TE>
<TE>   She has adapted adroitly through the summer to co-hosts as
markedly different as Roberts and the bubbly Norville, and executives
were pleased with her grilling of contributor Martha Stewart on the
domestic diva's controversial stock sale. But Clayson's contract is
up in early September, and CBS' delay in renewing it has set off
rounds of undermining whispers, some of which have made it into
print, only to be categorically denied by CBS.</TE>
<TE>   If she were to follow Gumbel out the door, CBS would end up with
changes in both the host roles, which some executives think goes
against morning viewers' desire for continuity and familiarity.</TE>
<TE>   A CBS News spokeswoman said executives aren't going to discuss
their strategy publicly. The process itself appears to have taken on
a chicken-and-egg quality, as executives grapple with whether to
settle on a new format and then find hosts to fit, or find the
personalities and then shape the show around them, as CBS did with
Gumbel, tailoring the show to his strong newsmaker interview skills.
It's complicated by the relatively limited number of candidates
available.</TE>
<TE>   Senior executive producer Bass, who started at the beginning of
the summer and previously worked at NBC's "Today," has adjusted the
format, adding a couch and more unstructured time for the anchors to
chat informally, something that Clayson and Gumbel never seemed
comfortable doing.</TE>
<TE>   Executives have debated adding even more time for informal
chatter, along the lines of ABC's popular morning gabfest "The View."
They've talked about having two female hosts, instead of a standard
male-female combination. And people familiar with the situation say
the success of "Fox &amp; Friends" hasn't escaped anyone's notice,
proving that a departure from the tried-and-true could succeed.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, whatever CBS comes up with--and no decision is
expected imminently--is likely to include more traditional elements
of newsmaker interviews, entertainment and, of course, weather.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, turning to familiar faces such as Smith and Norville
this summer has proven to be a successful strategy in one key sense:
It has helped stave off the precipitous ratings decline that often
follows a host's departure, making the rebuilding task even harder.</TE>

<HD>Ouster of Bertelsmann's CEO Bodes Ill for Napster</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The odds of dormant song-swapping service Napster reemerging as an
authorized distributor of music diminished substantially with the
departure of Bertelsmann Chief Executive Thomas Middelhoff, though no
decisions have been made, people at both companies said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Middelhoff led two investments in the Redwood City-based Internet
firm for a combined $85 million and agreed to buy Napster's assets
for $8 million more through a bankruptcy auction scheduled for late
August. That sale has yet to be completed, and Napster is more
vulnerable than other divisions of Bertelsmann because it hasn't been
integrated, the people said.</LD>
<LD>   No other Bertelsmann executives had the same level of enthusiasm
for the project as Middelhoff, who once declared that a legitimized
Napster could be as big as America Online.</LD>
<TE>   Napster pioneered efficient peer-to-peer sharing of recordings
stored on tens of millions of personal computers. Most of the
recordings were pirated, and Napster was losing a copyright lawsuit
brought by the major record labels when a federal judge ordered it to
stay shut.</TE>
<TE>   Napster then developed an unreleased system including provisions
for protecting music rights. It still lacks the major-label content
that Bertelsmann could provide. Earlier, Bertelsmann's directors had
expressed concern about the expense of a proposed settlement with the
labels, later abandoned as Middelhoff began negotiating to bring
Napster into the Bertelsmann fold.</TE>
<TE>   Napster's remaining skeleton crew, which includes founder Shawn
Fanning, has yet to hear anything about Bertelsmann's intentions,
employees said.</TE>
<TE>   "They are having lots of meetings," one said. "We have no
indication of anything."</TE>
<TE>   Bertelsmann is contractually obligated to make its bid for Napster
but not to operate it. Napster allies are trying to find other
potential bidders by the Aug. 21 deadline in case the media company
backs away from Middelhoff's plan.</TE>
<TE>   The employees took some comfort in reports that Middelhoff's
emphasis on the Internet didn't provoke his ouster. Instead, he
battled with the German publishing giant's controlling family over
how much of the firm they should maintain in a planned initial public
offering.</TE>
<TE>   In his first public comments since his dismissal Sunday,
Middelhoff told German television that the company could keep its
"strong cultural ties" to its base in Gutersloh and remain
three-quarters controlled by the family. An existing plan to let a
minority shareholder sell as much as 25% of Bertelsmann's shares in
2005--which would make it Europe's largest listed media
company--would not dilute the family's control.</TE>
<TE>   But Middelhoff said he had a more ambitious vision, implying a
greater public stake.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if today the stock market climate is bad, the management
must have the flexibility to develop this company further with a
stock listing in the medium and long term," Middelhoff said.
"Otherwise, a big firm like Bertelsmann can hardly stay competitive
internationally in the size class where it currently finds itself."</TE>
<TE>   Bertelsmann officials declined to comment. A member of the
controlling Mohn family told a newspaper that new CEO Gunter Thielen,
who is known as a cost cutter, shouldn't be written off as an
"old-economy" executive just because he comes from the company's
printing division, Arvato.</TE>
<TE>   "Thielen is being underestimated," Christoph Mohn, who heads
Internet portal Lycos Europe, told the Tagesspiegel daily. "He has
built a highly modern and very profitable service branch from the
traditional printing business."</TE>
<TE>   Arvato reflects the company's origins as a printer of religious
books, but Bertelsmann also owns e-commerce firm Pixelpark. Other
holdings include No. 1 book publisher Random House, music firm BMG
Entertainment and European television and magazines.</TE>
<TE>   Thielen has begun a review of Bertelsmann's assets and will meet
with the company's board Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Middelhoff said he would take a long vacation in France to
consider whether his career would continue outside Germany, "possibly
on another continent."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Jon Healey contributed to this report and
Associated Press was used in compiling it.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>EarthLink Inc. posted a $40-million loss for the second quarter as
subscriber growth for high-speed Internet access was canceled out by
a nearly 7% loss in dial-up customers. The net loss, equal to 27
cents a share, was better than a year-earlier loss of $98.7 million,
or 75 cents a share.</LD>
<LD>   Excluding amortization and depreciation costs, the company lost
$10.8 million, or 7 cents a share, 2 cents better than the forecast
of analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call. That compares with an
operational loss of $35.1 million, or 27 cents, in the same quarter
of 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Revenue at the Atlanta-based Internet service provider rose 10% to
$335.5 million.</LD>
<TE>   EarthLink said it expects a full-year loss of 15 cents to 22 cents
a share on revenue of $1.4 billion. Its shares rose 2 cents, to
$4.75, on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Motorola CEO Defends Timing of Stock Sale</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Motorola Inc. Chief Executive Christopher Galvin said he had
"absolutely no knowledge" that the company's operating chief was
about to quit when he sold 40,000 shares last week, a day before the
resignation announcement sent the stock plummeting.</LD>
<LD>   Defending his stock transaction at a meeting with analysts, Galvin
called the timing of the sale regrettable because it coincided with
Edward Breen's departure.</LD>
<LD>   Breen, who also was Motorola's president, was credited with
helping to craft a modest turnaround at the long-slumping cell phone
and semiconductor maker.</LD>
<TE>   The announcement late Thursday afternoon that he was leaving
caused the company's volatile stock--which already had fallen $1.28,
to $12.18, that day--to tumble an additional 10% to $10.90 Friday on
the New York Stock Exchange. Motorola shares fell 11 cents, to
$11.98, on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I had absolutely no knowledge of Ed's intentions or events,"
Galvin said at the start of the company's annual meeting with
financial analysts outside Chicago.</TE>

<HD>MTV Shows Are Built Not to Last</HD>

<LD>When MTV renewed its rock-star-as-sitcom-dad hit "The Osbournes," the
family's laundry list of conditions included rights to syndicate
episodes to TV stations beginning in 2004. To which Ozzy himself
might say, "Are you out of your [mumbled, inaudible] minds?"</LD>
<LD>   Even before Sharon Osbourne's disclosed bout with cancer cast
doubt over the show's future--can family high jinks coexist with
chemotherapy, or will the focus, through the wonders of editing, need
to shift toward the kids?--the novelty of "The Osbournes" seemed
unlikely to sustain interest beyond a second season or inspire anyone
to watch two years from now. Moreover, given the way MTV approaches
its business, nor was it meant to.</LD>
<LD>   That the show looks destined for a fast flameout is no big sweat
to the MTV brain trust, which has seen other youth-oriented phenomena
follow a meteoric trajectory, from "Beavis and Butt-head" to
"Jackass" to a series that MTV executive Brian Graden helped develop,
Comedy Central's "South Park."</LD>
<TE>   "They burn bright, they burn fast," mused MTV President Van
Toffler.</TE>
<TE>   More notable than "The Osbournes' " long-term prospects, in fact,
is how MTV's accelerated cycle has begun permeating network
television, where sequels to Fox's "Temptation Island" and ABC's "The
Mole" quickly cratered and the second "Celebrity Boxing" special had
the instant feel of been there, done that.</TE>
<TE>   This pattern represents a serious detour for the major networks,
once accustomed to finding hits and then hanging on until the young
adults watching them were eligible for Social Security. As it is,
"NYPD Blue" and "Frasier" are preparing for their 10th seasons, "ER"
and "Friends" their ninth, "The Simpsons" will kick off Year 14, and
"Law &amp; Order" is readying for lucky No. 13, having started a little
family of spinoffs.</TE>
<TE>   MTV, by contrast, has operated on a different calendar timed to
the short attention spans of its teenage audience. Granted, "The Real
World" has endured more than a decade, but that show changes casts
and locations with each edition. Otherwise, MTV chews up and spits
out material--a channel perfectly suited to the demands of a media
world that often feels like a 33 record (remember those, kids?)
playing at 78 speed.</TE>
<TE>   It's not a mind-set that leaves much time for dwelling on success.
" 'The Osbournes,' which may have two more years, does not occupy any
of our conversations," said Graden, president of entertainment for
MTV and VH1, who appropriately talks very fast in perfect, complete
sentences. "It's done, it's over, the show will be made, but all of
our conversations are about the future."</TE>
<TE>   The major networks are torn in this regard. They realize the value
of long-running franchises but covet cheaper, quick-hit fare to tap
into a younger audience. And because these cheesy shows generally
have the kind of shelf life associated with other dairy products, no
one at NBC is worrying about what to do for the "Fear Factor" 10th
anniversary show, just as "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" and
"Weakest Link" shone brightly for a time before migrating to the
lower-stakes world of early-evening syndication.</TE>
<TE>   Broadcasters, as a result, can trip up by too closely following
MTV, which caters to a hyperkinetic audience that rapidly grows up
and out of its demographic. "When you're 18, what you were listening
to when you were 16 is uncool," Graden said. "That's part of it."</TE>
<TE>   Considering that HBO is widely viewed as television's best
programming job--in that the channel defines success on its terms
without being enslaved by ratings--MTV officials describe theirs as
the most relentless, albeit with certain advantages over those who
might try to mimic them.</TE>
<TE>   As a cable channel, MTV escapes the sort of scrutiny devoted to
the big networks, so its misfires sometimes fly under the media's
radar. In addition, the frenetic pace actually appears to be a boon
when it comes to attracting talent, since MTV offers marquee (or
sometimes just unusual) names an opportunity to indulge in
risk-taking fare without needing to replicate the experience
indefinitely. P. Diddy can thus connect with potential CD buyers by
letting MTV shoot "Making the Band" around him, just as singer Brandy
opened up for a recent monthlong series documenting the birth of her
child.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like they've got to commit five years of their lives to
MTV," Toffler said.</TE>
<TE>   Part of this live-for-today philosophy stems from a desire to keep
costs low, but it simultaneously spares MTV from the specter of
ratings freefall that major networks face by losing a franchise like
"Friends," "Everybody Loves Raymond" or "Millionaire."</TE>
<TE>   "We strive sort of mercilessly never to be defined by one show,"
Graden said. "Right now the press is writing about 'The Osbournes,'
but that's only because old people are watching it. To our audience,
we have 15 shows doing the same demographic rating within [the age
group of] 12 to 24.... So even though the lifespan is pretty short,
we try to make sure the volume is pretty deep."</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that we fall back on is the environment and the culture
of the music," Toffler added. "If anything, that's what defines us.
Not 'Jackass' or 'Beavis and Butt-head.' "</TE>
<TE>   MTV executives are understandably a bit full of themselves these
days--"The Osbournes" having become the kind of series breakthrough,
in terms of ratings and media attention, that doubtless seemed
unimaginable when the channel was best-known for running Whitesnake
videos.</TE>
<TE>   Still, MTV's influence has been undeniable, planting seeds other
networks have rushed to harvest--with "Jackass" helping beget "Fear
Factor," just as "The Real World" begat "Big Brother," and "The
Osbournes" begat E!'s upcoming "The Anna Nicole Show" and a host of
anticipated wannabes.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like Van and I should get a royalty," Graden quipped.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge for MTV remains staying ahead of the curve, hoping
that by the time the next clone arrives, its lab will have concocted
some new potion to briefly mesmerize the youth audience.</TE>
<TE>   "Let other people imitate us," Toffler said. "We're on to the next
thing."</TE>
<TE>   As for "old people" awaiting new episodes of "The Osbournes"--that
is, anyone over 35--enjoy the show while it lasts, because by the
time you can hoist a thumb to hitch a ride on MTV's next cultural
phenom, the odds are pretty good it will have already passed you by.</TE>

<HD>Boston Bank to Buy Family Savings</HD>
<DH>Mergers: Deal believed to be worth $12 million would create
nation's largest black-owned financial institution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a deal that would create the nation's largest black-owned bank,
Family Savings Bank in South Los Angeles is being acquired by Boston
Bank of Commerce, the fast-growing institution that last year
purchased Founders National Bank, another African American-owned bank
in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Executives at the privately held banks described the
transaction--which is expected to be announced today--as an important
step toward the Boston bank's goal of establishing in black
neighborhoods a nationwide network of banks with the access to
capital, depth of management and technology found at larger banks.</LD>
<LD>   As the industry has consolidated into larger institutions, the
country's four dozen black-owned banks have tended to remain small
and focused on their communities--"doggedly provincial," as Family
Savings Chairman Clyde Oden put it.</LD>
<TE>   But Boston Bank of Commerce Chairman Kevin Cohee said Tuesday that
minority banks must strike broader partnerships "in order to obtain
economies of scale as well as to help people in our communities
achieve their aspirations."</TE>
<TE>   "You've had a bunch of small banks trying to fulfill the needs of
their communities, but it was very, very hard without scale," Cohee
said.</TE>
<TE>   The deal culminates a contentious auction, triggered when Family
Savings' majority shareholder, WattsHealth Systems, developed
financial difficulties and was forced to put the four-branch thrift
up for sale early this year.</TE>
<TE>   With several bids on the table, Family Savings' directors agreed
in March to sell the thrift to FBOP Corp., a large, white-owned
banking company in Illinois that has been expanding aggressively in
California. FBOP promised to allow Family Savings' management
considerable autonomy. But community leaders protested that black
ownership should be preserved, and Family Savings' board backed out
of that deal and accepted a higher offer from the Boston bank.</TE>
<TE>   "This purchase is a giant step for our community," said Rep.
Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), a member of the House Committee on
Financial Services and one of the chief opponents of FBOP taking over
Family Savings.</TE>
<TE>   Cohee, who previously told Black Enterprise magazine his company's
offer was "in the eight digits," said Tuesday that the parties had
agreed not to discuss terms of the deal.</TE>
<TE>   People familiar with the transaction, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Boston Bank of Commerce had agreed to pay $12 million
for Family Savings, topping an $11-million offer by FBOP, which was
paid a $600,000 breakup fee when its deal fell through.</TE>
<TE>   An FBOP representative said the Illinois bank "wishes the combined
company every success."</TE>
<TE>   Family Savings' board will stay on, providing its knowledge of Los
Angeles to the new owners, Oden said. He said the bank would continue
efforts to cater to Latino customers by having Spanish-speaking
employees in each branch.</TE>
<TE>   The Boston Bank of Commerce's owners include wealthy African
American businesspeople in Boston as well as NBA star turned
entrepreneur Earvin "Magic" Johnson, singer Janet Jackson and Jheryl
Busby, a former president of Motown Records. Busby had been chairman
of Founders National Bank, now known as Founders Bank of Commerce;
Johnson and Jackson were investors in Founders National Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Cohee described Johnson's endeavors to bring movie theaters,
Starbucks Corp. coffee shops and TGI Friday's restaurants to the
inner city as a model for what he hopes his bank can achieve.</TE>
<TE>   At the behest of federal banking regulators, the Boston bank also
took over the black-owned Peoples Bank of Commerce in Miami. Family
Savings has $208 million in assets, which would bring the total under
Boston Bank of Commerce control to $468 million if the deal goes
through.</TE>
<TE>   That would make it slightly larger than Carver Bancorp, the parent
of Carver Federal Savings Bank in Harlem, N.Y., which is the largest
black-owned bank or thrift with $439 million in assets.</TE>
<TE>   Citizens Bancshares Corp. in Atlanta has announced an expansion
plan similar to the Boston bank's. It recently agreed to buy the
Alabama thrift CFS Bancshares, creating an institution with about
$300 million in assets, which would be the third-largest black-owned
bank in the country.</TE>
<TE>   A large amount of problem loans at Founders has somewhat depleted
capital at Boston Bank of Commerce, and Cohee said the investors may
have to put more money into the institution to win regulator approval
of the deal.</TE>
<TE>   "We've all committed to do whatever is necessary to be
successful," Cohee said.</TE>

<HD>Hilton Posts Earnings Drop, Matching Estimates</HD>
<DH>Hospitality: The hotel chain lowers its outlook for the
rest of the year. Its results are better than those of its major
rivals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hilton Hotels Corp. on Tuesday reported lower second-quarter
earnings, in line with Wall Street expectations, as the industry's
post-Sept. 11 rebound stalled and sluggish demand from business
travelers hurt room rates.</LD>
<LD>   The results were better than those of many of Hilton's peers, but
the company lowered its outlook for the rest of the year, bringing it
more in line with the rest of the struggling hotel industry.</LD>
<LD>   The Beverly Hills-based company, whose brands include Hampton Inn,
Homewood Suites and Embassy Suites, said net income in the second
quarter fell 12% to $76 million, or 20 cents a share. Revenue fell 5%
to $1.04 billion and revenue per available room declined 6.1%.</LD>
<TE>   Several metropolitan markets showed strong or improving occupancy
levels, but the San Francisco-San Jose market--still reeling from the
meltdown of the technology sector--continued to show weakness.</TE>
<TE>   The performance was better than that of Hilton's biggest rivals,
Marriott International Inc. and Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide
Inc., analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in fact seeing the gradual improvement we expected early
this year, and things are getting better," Hilton Chief Executive
Stephen Bollenbach said in a conference call. "Unfortunately, the
improvement is not as fast as we originally anticipated."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts praised the company for controlling expenses and keeping
margins up even as room revenue declined.</TE>
<TE>   "The results were OK given the environment we're in," said J.
Cogan, a senior research analyst with Banc of America Securities in
San Francisco. "They are managing the business well."</TE>
<TE>   Hilton said it now expects third-quarter earnings of about 10
cents a share and full-year 2002 earnings in the low-to-mid-50-cents
range, with revenue flat in the third quarter and down 2% to 4% for
the year.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts polled by Thomson First Call on average had forecast 17
cents and 62 cents, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Hilton shares closed up 13 cents at $11.53 on the Big Board.</TE>
<TE>   * Providian Financial Corp., issuer of MasterCard and Visa credit
cards, reported profit that beat Wall Street expectations and said it
will close three more offices, firing 1,300 employees.</TE>
<TE>   Providian closed its Sacramento facility, which employs 300
people, effective immediately, and said it will shutter offices in
Fairfield, Calif., and Salt Lake City, which together employ 1,000
people, by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   The company said in May that it would fire 2,600 workers, or about
26% of its work force, by the end of the year as part of an effort to
recover from crippling loan losses.</TE>
<TE>   Providian's net income fell 34% to $153.9 million, or 53 cents a
share, including several one-time items, but drew praise from
analysts as an indication that the company's turnaround plan is
progressing more quickly than anticipated. The company said it took a
charge of about $37.9 million in the quarter as a result of the
office closures.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding that charge and the effect of a loan sale, Providian
said it earned 9 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts on average were expecting a loss of 1 cent.</TE>
<TE>   Providian shares rose as high as $5 in extended trading on the
news, after closing at $3.75, up 11 cents, on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   * Fluor Corp. said profit rose 26% to $43 million, or 54 cents a
share, beating analysts' average estimate of 50 cents. The Aliso
Viejo-based engineering, construction and consulting firm said
revenue grew 14% to $2.5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   * Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc. reported a second-quarter net loss of
$21.2 million, or 39 cents a share, compared with a loss of $23.4
million, or 58 cents, a year ago. The Carlsbad-based biotechnology
company's revenue climbed 164% to $20.1 million as it attracted
several new partners and technology licensees.</TE>
<TE>   * IHOP Corp. said second-quarter net income fell 9% to $9.3
million, or 44 cents a share, on a 2.5% rise in revenue to $84.9
million.</TE>
<TE>   * National R.V. Holdings Inc. reported a second-quarter net loss
of $1.4 million, or 14 cents a share, compared with net income of
$100,000, or 1 cent, a year ago. The Perris, Calif.-based maker of
motor homes and travel trailers said sales rose 8% to $87.5 million.</TE>

<HD>ChevronTexaco's Profit Plunges 81%</HD>
<DH>Earnings: Oil giant is hammered by losses on its investment
in energy trader Dynegy. Lower prices and sluggish demand also
diminished income.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ChevronTexaco Corp. reported Tuesday that second-quarter net income
fell 81% because of lower oil and gasoline prices as well as the San
Francisco oil giant's soured investment in Dynegy Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Net income fell to $407 million, or 39 cents a share, compared
with the combined $2.11 billion, or $1.99 a share, that Chevron and
Texaco earned in the same quarter last year. Second-quarter revenue
fell 13% to $25.2 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Chevron and Texaco completed their merger in October, and although
costs from the deal contributed to the earnings decline, the company
said it is on track to attain pretax savings targets of $2.2 billion
by early next year.</LD>
<TE>   Excluding special charges and merger expenses, ChevronTexaco's
operating earnings were $1.23 billion, or $1.16 a share, compared
with $2.14 billion, or $2.01 a share.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel good about the post-merger integration of all of our
businesses and I'm very optimistic about the outlook for the
company," ChevronTexaco Chief Executive Dave O'Reilly told analysts
during a conference call.</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy separately reported a second-quarter loss of $328 million,
or 92 cents a share, and predicted it will break even for the rest of
the year. In the second quarter of last year, Dynegy earned $146
million, or 43 cents a share. Revenue fell 8% to $9.9 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The Houston-based energy trader and marketer has seen its credit
rating slashed to "junk" but was able to sell its biggest pipeline,
Northern Natural Gas Co., for $928 million in cash.</TE>
<TE>   On the New York Stock Exchange, ChevronTexaco's shares fell $1.38
to $73. Shares of Dynegy rose 54 cents to $1.74.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest hit to ChevronTexaco's earnings came from $631 million
in special charges related to Dynegy, in which ChevronTexaco owns
nearly 27% of the common stock. Of those charges, $531 million was a
write-down of the value of ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy's
common and preferred stock to its fair market value as of June 30,
and an additional $100 million represented ChevronTexaco's share of
Dynegy's losses.</TE>
<TE>   Some had expected ChevronTexaco, the second-largest U.S. oil
company, to completely write off its investment in Dynegy. Instead,
O'Reilly said his company is encouraged by Dynegy's recent efforts to
raise cash and restore investor confidence "and to be a viable player
as the sector continues to go through transition."</TE>
<TE>   O'Reilly acknowledged that a $1.5-billion investment into Dynegy
in November as the company tried to buy failing Enron Corp.--a merger
that disintegrated when the depths to Enron's troubles became
apparent--"has not worked out well to date."</TE>
<TE>   "We did not foresee the collapse of the entire sector. Had we
known late last year what we know now, we certainly would not have
moved forward with that additional investment," O'Reilly said.
ChevronTexaco received preferred stock for its money.</TE>
<TE>   ChevronTexaco's 6-year-old investment in Dynegy, which markets the
company's significant natural gas production in the United States,
had been "a net positive" until late last year, O'Reilly said. "Going
forward, despite the uncertainty, we still see a need for the
functions that this sector provides" in energy trading and marketing,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts said the Dynegy drama has been a drain on
ChevronTexaco management, which played a behind-the-scenes role in
ousting Dynegy's chairman and chief executive, Chuck Watson, in May.
Glenn Tilton, ChevronTexaco's vice chairman, is serving as acting
chairman of Dynegy, which is being probed by the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the Justice Department over company finances
and trading practices.</TE>
<TE>   Like others in the oil patch, ChevronTexaco has felt the effects
of lower oil prices and sluggish demand for gasoline. The company's
earnings from exploration and production dropped 27% to $1.25 billion
while earnings from refining, marketing and transportation plunged
85% to $104 million.</TE>
<TE>   Another major oil company, BP, which owns the Arco chain, said
Tuesday that second-quarter net income fell 26% to $2.04 billion, or
9 cents a share. Excluding one-time items, BP would have earnings of
$2.18 billion. Revenue slipped 9.5% to $44.1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   In other energy earnings Tuesday:</TE>
<TE>   * Mirant Corp. reported a second-quarter net loss of $151 million,
or 38 cents, compared with a profit of $124 million, or 36 cents, a
year ago.</TE>
<TE>   The company also said an accounting review had found errors in its
2001 financial statements, including an $85-million overstatement of
a gas inventory asset, a $100-million overstatement of an accounts
payable liability and a potential $68-million overstatement of an
accounts receivable asset.</TE>
<TE>   * Valero Energy Corp.,said second-quarter profit plunged 96% to
fall to $11.3 million, or 10 cents a share, because of declining
demand for diesel fuel and heating oil and rising expenses.</TE>
<TE>   The oil refiner's sales rose 46% to $6.55 billion, reflecting its
purchase of rival Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corp.</TE>
<TE>   * El Paso Energy Partners, a publicly traded partnership
controlled by El Paso Corp., said second-quarter earnings more than
doubled to $28.7 million, or 33 cents a unit, from $11.8 million, or
4 cents, a year ago, with the addition of natural-gas pipelines in
Texas and New Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue almost tripled to $120.5 million from $45 million.</TE>

<HD>Jury Awards $5.3 Million for Credit Report Errors</HD>
<DH>Courts: The verdict against Trans Union is the largest ever
for violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Oregon woman who fought for six years to clear erroneous items
from her credit report was awarded $5.3 million Monday by a federal
jury in Oregon.</LD>
<LD>   The verdict against Chicago-based credit reporting firm Trans
Union was the largest amount ever awarded for violations of the Fair
Credit Reporting Act, which requires credit reporting companies to
keep accurate records and promptly correct mistakes, consumer
attorneys said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "This amount, awarded to one plaintiff, eclipses everything we've
seen before," said Andy Henderson, a Los Angeles attorney who has
litigated several such suits. "But it's a continuation of a trend
that has been going on since 1996.</LD>
<TE>   "We have seen increasingly large awards against credit reporting
agencies--and rightly so. The credit reporting industry has been
acting in conscious disregard of the law for years."</TE>
<TE>   Trans Union is expected to appeal the verdict, but a company
spokesman did not return calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   The case was filed two years ago in U.S. District Court in
Portland by Judy Thomas, a Klamath Falls real estate broker who
discovered that her clean credit history had been marred by the
credit problems of another woman with a similar first name and Social
Security number.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas had first attempted to clear the inaccurate items in 1996
by contacting Trans Union, said her attorney, Mike Baxter of
Portland. Baxter said Trans Union had mixed Thomas' credit history
with that of a woman who lived one state away and whose Social
Security number was just one digit off from Thomas'.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas didn't discover that the inaccuracies were still on her
credit report--and showed her credit had gotten even worse--until
three years later, when she was in the process of buying a home.
Turned down for a mortgage, Thomas learned that her credit report
included an "a.k.a." or "also known as" listing, indicating to
potential lenders that she and the other woman were the same person.</TE>
<TE>   According to Baxter, when renewed efforts to get Trans Union to
fix the problem were unsuccessful, Thomas contacted the other woman,
and persuaded her to write a letter to the credit agency stating that
she was not Thomas. The "also known as" remained on Thomas' credit
report until only a few months ago, Baxter said, thwarting Thomas'
efforts to clear her report of credits problems.</TE>
<TE>   "She has not had a clean credit report in six years," said Baxter,
who asked the jury for both compensatory and punitive damages. "We
are hoping that this case will make it clear that credit reporting
agencies have to follow the law."</TE>
<TE>   The Fair Credit Reporting Act spells out a procedure for consumers
to dispute erroneous items on their credit report--a document used by
lenders and insurers to set rates and determine whether to issue new
loans and insurance policies. Trans Union is one of three major
credit reporting companies that compile such data. The other two are
Atlanta-based Equifax and Costa Mesa-based Experian.</TE>
<TE>   The Fair Credit Reporting Act also requires that credit reporting
companies investigate disputes and correct or delete the incorrect
items within 30 days.</TE>
<TE>   Credit reporting firms typically investigate consumer complaints
by sending a form letter to the creditor that reported the disputed
item, asking to verify its accuracy. If the creditor does not verify
the item within 30 days, the item is dropped. If it's reinstated
later, the credit reporting company is supposed to notify the
consumer.</TE>
<TE>   However, Thomas contended in her lawsuit that the procedures Trans
Union used to investigate and correct her report only worsened the
problem. The agency never wiped out the erroneous "also known as"
listing, Baxter said, so its computer-generated form letters gave
creditors the impression that Thomas and the other woman were one and
the same. The result was that Thomas' report was never cleared.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas eventually got her mortgage by contacting the creditors
directly, providing the correct information about her name, address,
Social Security number and stating she wasn't using any other names
or any other addresses.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a perfect example of what happens to hundreds of thousands
of consumers," attorney Henderson said. "It's a reflection of the
fact that credit reporting systems often don't have the proper
mechanisms in place to correct a problem even after it's been
identified and proven to be inaccurate by the consumer."</TE>

<HD>Shaken Confidence, Sluggish Sales in July</HD>
<DH>Economy: Index says consumers are more pessimistic. Chain
stores report modest gains.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Consumer confidence in July fell to its lowest rate in five months
and retail sales are tracking only slightly better, according to
reports released Tuesday, but economists say the broader picture
might not be as bad as it looks.</LD>
<LD>   The Conference Board reported a nine-point decline from June to
July in its consumer confidence index, the fastest rate since the
days after Sept. 11, as corporate scandals and plummeting stock
values shook Americans' faith in an economic recovery.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, sales in retail chain stores open at least a
year are showing only modest gains for July, according to ShopperTrak
RCT's National Retail Sales Estimate, when compared with the same
period a year ago.</LD>
<TE>   Chain-store sales from the first three weeks of the month point to
a 3% July gain for stores open at least a year, said Michael Niemira,
retail economist for the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in New York and a
consultant on the report. Final numbers for July same-store retail
sales are due next week.</TE>
<TE>   Retail giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc. seemed to offer proof of a
sluggish July. The Bentonville, Ark.-based seller said Monday that
sales for July probably will be at the low end of their plan, which
is unusual for the company and contrary to its forecasts earlier in
the month.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the course of July, what you saw is some softening in both
the confidence and the sales data," Niemira said. "The question for
the broader economy is, has confidence fallen to the point where you
become concerned that the consumer will start to retrench? I think
not quite yet."</TE>
<TE>   Based on interviews with 5,000 consumers, the private Conference
Board survey also shows a more pessimistic outlook for the next six
months.</TE>
<TE>   The number of respondents who expected business conditions to
deteriorate rose from 7.1% to 9.2%. Those who anticipated improvement
fell from 23.7% to 20.9%, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   And consumers who rated current business conditions as bad rose to
22.1% from 19.5% a month earlier. Those who rated conditions as good,
however, also rose slightly to 20.1% from 19.9%. Respondents who said
jobs were hard to get rose to 24% in July from 23.2% a month earlier.
The number of people who said jobs were plentiful fell to 18.8% in
July, down from 20.1% in June.</TE>
<TE>   Conference Board Economist Ken Goldstein said that despite the
drop, consumer confidence is relatively strong--and well ahead of the
numbers from September.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tumble, but it doesn't mean the bottom fell out of
consumer confidence," Goldstein said. "My strong guess is that after
this sudden drop, we'll probably see some bounce back in August.
Don't look for consumers to go on a splurge, but don't look at them
to put their hands in their pockets and leave them there."</TE>

<HD>Merrill Lynch Grilled in Senate</HD>
<DH>Panel accuses brokerage of helping Enron hide its debt</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A Senate panel investigating corporate misdeeds took aim at the
nation's biggest brokerage firm Tuesday, questioning top executives
of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. about whether they helped Enron Corp.
camouflage its financial trouble.</LD>
<LD>   Senators accused Merrill Lynch of misleading investors by striking
financial arrangements with Enron that helped the failed energy
trader hide its massive debt from investors. They also questioned why
Merrill changed analysts after one issued a report unfavorable to
Enron.</LD>
<LD>   "Making money by assisting a company like Enron to engage in
misleading accounting or by discouraging analysts to provide honest
ratings ... rewards the wrong companies for the wrong reasons and
produces the situation we are in today with a crisis of investor
confidence," said Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), chairman of the
permanent subcommittee on investigations.</LD>
<TE>   "In the end, the prospect of more lucrative business from Enron
trumped those at Merrill who urged caution," said subcommittee member
Susan Collins, a Maine Republican.</TE>
<TE>   The dressing-down of Merrill Lynch came after the panel summoned
three current and former executives of the investment firm to testify
about what role it may have played in the collapse of Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Furst, a former Merrill Lynch managing director, and
Schuyler Tilney, a managing director on administrative leave, both
invoked their 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination. Both
cited the Justice Department's continuing investigation.</TE>
<TE>   A third Merrill Lynch executive, Senior Vice President G. Kelly
Martin, defended the company, saying that "our limited dealings with
Enron were appropriate and proper based on what we knew at the time."</TE>
<TE>   But subcommittee Chairman Levin characterized Martin's claims as
"simply unbelievable." He added that the panel would consider
legislation to curb future abuses and vowed to pass the
subcommittee's findings to the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's hearing focused largely on Enron's 1999 bid to get
Merrill Lynch to invest $7 million in several barges in Nigeria that
were used to generate electricity. The deal helped Enron complete a
major sale so that the energy company could record a $12-million gain
on the transaction and meet its earnings target for the year.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange, senators say, Enron gave Merrill Lynch a guarantee
that it would arrange the resale of the brokerage firm's interest in
the barges and pay the investment firm a 15% profit by June 30, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   At issue was whether Merrill Lynch engaged in the complex deal
knowing that Enron would claim the transaction as a sale to improve
its earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch assumed no operational control over the barge
company and did not pay any of the administrative costs associated
with running the barges, according to subcommittee documents. The
panel also produced an internal Merrill Lynch report that described
the barge deal as "most unusual."</TE>
<TE>   "Merrill Lynch assisted Enron in cooking its books by pretending
to purchase an existing Enron asset when it was really engaged in a
loan," Levin said, adding that Merrill did this partly to gain future
banking business from Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch had previously agreed in June to pay New York state
$100 million in penalties and reform its research practices after an
investigation by state Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer. Justice Department
officials are probing Merrill Lynch's relationship with Enron and
took the unusual step of sitting in on Tuesday's hearings. They
declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the barge deal, panel members also asked Martin why
a Merrill Lynch investment analyst was removed after issuing a
cautionary investment rating on Enron. They also scrutinized
Merrill's decision to participate in an Enron loan syndication
arranged by J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. bankers and questioned Merrill's
role in raising funds for LJM2, an off-the-books partnership headed
by Andrew S. Fastow, then Enron's chief financial officer.</TE>
<TE>   Martin, who acknowledged that Merrill Lynch's decision to
participate in the barge deal was fueled by a desire to forge a
closer relationship with Enron, said he assumed all deals were vetted
by Merrill Lynch executives.</TE>
<TE>   But he acknowledged that, in hindsight, some of the transactions
seemed ill-advised.</TE>
<TE>   "Had we known at the time what we know today," Martin said, "we
would not have conducted business with Enron."</TE>

<HD>Fund Outflows a Slowing Trend</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stock mutual fund redemptions appear to be slowing after two months
of heavy selling, as the market shows signs of stabilizing, fund
companies say.</LD>
<LD>   Equity fund investors still may end up redeeming more in July than
the net $18.1 billion they withdrew in June. Estimates from some data
trackers indicate July redemptions may top the record $30 billion
that was pulled out in September.</LD>
<LD>   But fund companies say the trend has changed since stocks began to
resurge July 24. On Tuesday, most major market indexes rose modestly,
adding to Monday's big gains.</LD>
<TE>   "It's making my life a lot easier," said Steve Colton, manager of
the Phoenix-Oakhurst Growth &amp; Income Fund in Scotts Valley, Calif.
Before July 24, Colton said, he was selling small portions of each of
his portfolio holdings on an almost daily basis to meet investor
redemptions.</TE>
<TE>   But over the last five days outflows have slowed to 10% to 20% of
their previous pace--allowing Colton, in turn, to halt stock sales,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The shift shows how more mutual fund investors in recent years
have become performance-followers--that is, they sell when stocks are
falling, and buy more when prices are rising. That means fund
managers could face another wave of redemptions if stocks head down
again, analysts warn.</TE>
<TE>   Official fund cash flow data for July won't be reported by the
industry until late August, but AMG Data Services of Arcata, Calif.,
estimates that a net $31 billion was redeemed from stock funds
through July 24. The net redemption figure is the amount that
investors took out of the funds in excess of new purchases.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the magnitude, July is certain to show a second straight
month of net outflows, after eight months of inflows. Until last
summer, stock funds overall had recorded net monthly inflows almost
consistently since 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even with June's outflow, stock funds took in a net $54
billion in the year's first half, outpacing the $49-billion cash
inflow in the first half of 2001, according to the Investment Company
Institute, the industry's main trade group.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say that reflects how many investors continue buying
funds through 401(k) retirement plans or other regular savings
programs, even though they may shy away from "discretionary
purchases" of funds in rough markets.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, recent cash outflows have been small relative to the
size of the fund industry. June's net withdrawals were 0.5% of the
$3.1 trillion in total stock fund assets.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, any fund redemptions can deepen market declines
because many funds keep little free cash on hand. On average, stock
funds had 4.6% of assets in cash as of June 30.</TE>
<TE>   Colton is among many managers whose mandate is to stay "fully
invested" in shares, which generally means holding less than 2% of
assets in cash. Funds that are fully invested may fare best when the
market rallies, but they also have less of a cushion if stocks
fall--or if redemptions surge.</TE>
<TE>   Like Colton, many large fund companies say they've gotten a
reprieve from investor redemptions since the market's July 24
turnaround, when the Dow Jones industrial average soared 488 points.
In the last five sessions the Dow is up 12.7%.</TE>
<TE>   At Boston-based Fidelity Investments, July outflows "could be
slightly more" than those in June, when a net $2.9 billion came out
of stock funds, said spokesman Vin Loporchio. But, he said, "There
has been more interest in equities in the past few days since we've
seen a shift in the market."</TE>
<TE>   At Vanguard Group in Valley Forge, Pa., about $3.5 billion has
come out of equity funds this month, said spokesman Brian Mattes. But
Mattes, who worked Vanguard's phone lines for two hours Monday, said,
"The tone has changed. I didn't get a single exchange or redemption
request this time, but I did get a lot of purchase orders."</TE>
<TE>   At San Francisco-based Charles Schwab Corp., a net $3.2 billion
came out of the firm's stock fund supermarket this month through
Monday, compared with $1 billion in June, said spokesman Lance Berg.
But he said that after weeks of heavy redemptions, "the last few days
have been more mixed."</TE>
<TE>   Fund cash flows demonstrate how the investing maxim "buy low, sell
high" is easier said than done, fund managers say.</TE>
<TE>   Said Colton: "People just want a little bit of confidence that
we've hit a bottom in the market. My friends, relatives and
acquaintances say they want to see it go up, and then they will buy
more."</TE>

<HD>Late Offer Heats Up Global Crossing Bidding</HD>
<DH>Telecom: A group led by David Walsh, a former president of
the fallen company, could draw on Bank One for financing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A late offer from a group led by a former top Global Crossing Ltd.
executive has turned the bidding process for the assets of the
telecommunications company into a heated competition, delaying an
auction winner for perhaps a week.</LD>
<LD>   The group--headed by David Walsh, who left last fall as Global's
president and chief operating officer--is making a run for the vast
fiber-optic network Global built. The group is expected to have the
deep pockets of Bank One Corp. and its venture arm, One Equity
Partners, behind it.</LD>
<LD>   The Walsh group "bolted out of the blue" this month to become a
serious contender for the assets of the firm as it seeks to
reorganize under Chapter 11, said a source familiar with the bidding
process.</LD>
<TE>   Walsh has been at Global's Madison, N.J., headquarters during the
last few weeks assessing its financial condition and prospects, the
source said.</TE>
<TE>   Walsh did not return a telephone call to his office.</TE>
<TE>   Bidding on Global's assets, delayed from last week to today, now
will be delayed further, possibly until an Aug. 7 hearing in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, a Global spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   Walsh is chairman of Moneyline Telerate, a worldwide provider of
real-time information and transaction services to the capital
markets. Moneyline is backed by One Equity Partners, and Walsh is a
longtime friend of Bank One's chairman and chief executive, James
Dimon, the source said.</TE>
<TE>   Moneyline also fits in with Global's once-ambitious plans to serve
the financial industry. Its prize contract was a $300-million deal
with the Swift interbank network, a consortium of 7,000 banks and
financial institutions in 196 countries that need a fast, secure
network to help process $6 trillion in transactions daily.</TE>
<TE>   Walsh, who is familiar with the company, is known on Wall Street
and in financial circles and is building a portfolio of networking
firms. He left Global after an apparent dispute with its chief
executive, John Legere, who has since been credited with keeping the
company together so it could be sold. But some believe the two can
still work together.</TE>
<TE>   Until Walsh came in, Global's network connecting more than 200
cities in 27 countries had seemed a good bet to go to Los Angeles
buyout specialists Tom and Alec Gores. The Gores brothers were
believed to be the only serious bidders for the entire company,
though a handful of others have bids on both big and small chunks of
Global.</TE>
<TE>   "It's down to real arm-wrestling now," said the source, who asked
not to be identified. "There are very intense discussions going on
now."</TE>
<TE>   The primary effort, people familiar with the talks said, is to
arrange a package that would give Global's bondholders and bankers
enough money upfront, enough equity to make them meaningful partners
and enough cash left over to put into operating the company and
keeping it viable, thus increasing the value of their new stock.</TE>
<TE>   Added to that balancing act are decisions that bidders have to
make on Global's value and the returns they can get on their
investment, especially considering the growing amount of assets on
the market from failed and failing telecoms.</TE>
<TE>   Industry analysts including Vik Grover at Kaufman Bros. in New
York believe the company would be better off with its previously
stated plan to obtain new financing and emerge from bankruptcy
proceedings free of old debt as a stand-alone firm.</TE>

<HD>IBM Offers to Acquire Pricewaterhouse Unit</HD>
<DH>Technology: The $3.5-billion deal for PwC Consulting would
allow Big Blue to expand the scope of its services beyond that of its
rivals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM and P.J. HUFFSTUTTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a bid to dominate the lucrative technology service business, IBM
Corp. announced Tuesday plans to buy the consulting arm of
PricewaterhouseCoopers for $3.5 billion in cash and stock.</LD>
<LD>   PwC Consulting would join IBM's Global Services unit, which has
surpassed Big Blue's storied computer hardware division as its most
lucrative venture.</LD>
<LD>   The acquisition also would cement IBM's position as the world's
largest technology services company, with annual revenue of $40
billion. By comparison, its next-largest competitor, Electronic Data
Systems Corp., posted $21.5 billion in sales last year.</LD>
<TE>   Although most corporations have little need for new hardware,
demand has mushroomed for experts who understand Web sites, software
integration, data storage and servers, the computers that run heavy
applications. Buying the Pricewaterhouse unit also gives the company
management consultants, broadening its services beyond those of most
competitors.</TE>
<TE>   The deal is expected to close by the end of September, pending
approval from federal regulators.</TE>
<TE>   IBM Chief Executive Samuel Palmisano said in a statement that the
company offered to pay $2.7 billion in cash, $400 million in stock
and a $400-million convertible note. The deal would reduce the
Armonk, N.Y.-based firm's earnings by almost 30 cents below the $1.40
a share that most Wall Street analysts had expected the computer
maker to earn in its fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Although a tough economy has cut into IBM's services growth, sales
continued to grow from $33 billion in 2001 to an estimated $35
billion this year, said John Connolly, general manager of IBM's
Strategy Group in Cambridge, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   "IBM is not insulated from any of the market conditions, and the
market has not been as robust as in previous years," Connolly said.
"But there is still a significant amount of spending, and our goal is
to capture as much of that spending as we can."</TE>
<TE>   The offer comes amid a major transformation within the accounting
world in the wake of Arthur Andersen's conviction of obstruction of
justice. PricewaterhouseCoopers and rival auditors are separating
their consulting units to eliminate perceived conflicts of interest
after the collapse of Enron Corp. Investors and lawmakers allege that
Arthur Andersen was lax in overseeing Enron's books because Andersen
didn't want to jeopardize its consulting fees.</TE>
<TE>   PricewaterhouseCoopers had planned to shed PwC Consulting through
an initial public offering, with hopes of raising as much as $9
billion. But the stock market plummeted, and the value of a PwC IPO
followed.</TE>
<TE>   "The market is what the market is," said Doug Elix, head of IBM's
Global Services group. "This is a good price for a great deal with
many synergies."</TE>
<TE>   The auditing arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers is IBM's auditor.</TE>
<TE>   If the deal goes through, IBM would add the estimated $4.9 billion
in revenue that PwC Consulting is expected to draw for its fiscal
2002, IBM's Connolly said.</TE>
<TE>   Both groups boast a lineup of major clients. PwC, which is
privately held, handles services for Raytheon Co. and Toyota Motor
Corp. IBM's client list includes Walt Disney Co. and Gillette Co.
Still, IBM will have its work cut out for it, trying to meld
PricewaterhouseCoopers' 30,000 workers with its own services staff of
150,000, cautioned analysts, who also predicted that IBM would slim
down the newly combined staff. Company executives said such plans
have not yet been made.</TE>
<TE>   "The history for most of these mergers has been abysmal," said Rob
Enderle, analyst with research firm Giga Information Group. "There's
no assurance that the merger will succeed."</TE>
<TE>   IBM wasn't the only tech company hungry to pick up PwC
Consulting's business. Hewlett-Packard Co., the largest U.S. computer
company after IBM, made an $18-billion bid in 2000 to buy the
management-consulting arm.</TE>
<TE>   HP Chief Executive Carly Fiorina insisted the deal would
drastically increase HP's profit growth by offering more services to
potential buyers of computer systems. The deal fell through after
major shareholders fought against it and HP's stock price dropped,
prompting the company to abandon the plans. HP this year again
considered buying PwC but demurred.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the last couple of months, HP has had the opportunity to buy
PwC and chose not to," said Rebeca Robboy, a spokeswoman for the Palo
Alto company.</TE>
<TE>   Robboy said Hewlett-Packard balked at the difficulty of
integrating PwC with its own consulting and services business. HP,
the third-largest technology services provider, annually pulls in $15
billion in revenue from its services unit, which employs 65,000.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the initial talks in 2000, HP investors were
concerned that a merger would result in an exodus of talent stemming
from a potential culture clash. They feared that a hot job market
allowed consultants to easily locate other employment.</TE>
<TE>   Now, though, workers have less flexibility, a factor that will
work in IBM's favor.</TE>
<TE>   "The economy's changed a lot," Enderle said. "People are looking
for any port in a storm. So IBM looks pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   IBM shares rose 61 cents to $71.79 during regular trading on the
New York Stock Exchange. They slipped to $70.55 in after-hours
trading once the deal was announced.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Hold Up Under Pressure</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Dow drops 31 points as Nasdaq gains. S&amp;P 500
winning streak enters third day.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A bout of profit taking and a larger-than-expected decline in
consumer confidence pressured stocks Tuesday, but the market still
managed to hang on to most of Monday's big rally.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said that although investors are still wary that stocks
will fall again, they were reassured by news that President Bush had
signed into law legislation that toughens penalties for corporate
fraud.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 31.85 points, or
0.4%, at 8,680.03. Over the previous four sessions, the Dow had
regained 1,009 of the 2,650 points lost in more than two months of
selling.</LD>
<TE>   Broader stock indicators closed modestly higher. The
high-tech-focused Nasdaq composite index advanced 8.94 points, or
0.7%, to 1,344.19, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index rose 3.82
points, or 0.4%, to 902.78. It was the S&amp;P 500's first close above
900 in nearly two weeks and marked the benchmark index's first
three-day winning streak since March.</TE>
<TE>   Winners edged losers by about 9 to 8 on both the Nasdaq and New
York Stock Exchange. Trading was active but well below the levels of
last week.</TE>
<TE>   The mixed finish followed a session in which stocks alternated
between gains and losses--the Dow at one point was off more than 170
points--as investors tried to figure out where the market will go
next.</TE>
<TE>   Hopes are growing that the market hit bottom last week, but
analysts hesitated to say a turnaround had begun. They noted that
numerous rallies have fizzled during the last two years, and that
could still happen to this one. Indeed, stocks tended to succumb to
selling whenever they made a moderate advance Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "The market is taking a pause today," said Tom Galvin, chief
investment officer at Credit Suisse First Boston. "We're still at a
very early stage of trying to define and solidify a market bottom,
and it's too early to say we're recovering."</TE>
<TE>   A weaker-than-expected reading in the Conference Board's consumer
confidence index contributed to the selling. The figure is closely
watched because consumer spending is viewed as crucial if an economic
recovery is to continue. However, some analysts noted that the report
measured consumer sentiment during this month's fierce market
decline, and may not reflect optimism generated by Wall Street's
recent gains.</TE>
<TE>   Investors were cheered by Bush's signing of legislation--prompted
by accounting and ethics scandals at companies including Enron and
WorldCom--that strengthens penalties for corporate wrongdoing.
Merrill Lynch rose 25 cents to $36.50 after the brokerage denied to
Congress that it knowingly helped Enron distort its financial
problems.</TE>
<TE>   In other trading, longer-term Treasury yields inched up, while the
dollar slipped against the euro and firmed against the Japanese yen.
Oil and gold both rose.</TE>
<TE>   Among the day's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Amgen climbed $1.47 to $45.49 as biotechnology shares attracted
buyers. Chiron gained $1.69 to $33.74 while MedImmune rallied $2.15
to $29.59. The Nasdaq biotech index jumped 4%.</TE>
<TE>   * Power company shares rallied on relief that energy trader
Dynegy's largest shareholder, ChevronTexaco, didn't bail out of its
investment as some had feared and on Mirant's reassurances that it is
continuing to increase cash reserves. Dynegy soared 54 cents, or 45%,
to $1.74. Mirant jumped $1.02, or almost 35%, to $3.96. The S&amp;P
utilities index bounded 7.9%.</TE>
<TE>   * In the tech sector, Qlogic gained $1.52 to $41.95, Juniper
Networks rose 78 cents to $8.48 and AOL Time Warner rose 82 cents to
$12.40. AOL and AT&amp;T, which added 26 cents to $10, said they
postponed plans for a stock offering of Time Warner Entertainment, a
joint venture that controls HBO and Warner Bros.</TE>
<TE>   * Some industrial issues stumbled. Dupont fell $1.90 to $42.05,
PPG Industries sank $3.26 to $56.21 and Nucor lost $3.44 to $55.</TE>
<TE>   * Retailers struggled amid reports of sluggish July sales. Sears
fell $1.49 to $48.26 while Gap dropped 45 cents to $12.80.</TE>
<TE>   * Foreign markets were mixed. Japan's Nikkei index rose 3.5%. In
Europe, where markets rallied along with Wall Street on Monday,
Germany's DAX index advanced 0.5% and Britain's FTSE-100 and France's
CAC-40 both lost 0.5%.</TE>
<TE>   * In Brazil, the real fell 5.1% against the dollar to a record low
and government bond prices slid on fears the International Monetary
Fund won't help the country avoid default on $298 billion of debt.
However, Brazil's Bovespa stock index rose 1.1%.</TE>

<HD>Music Pirates Delivering Loot Via AOL Public Sites</HD>
<DH>Internet: The online service unwittingly is giving
purveyors of pilfered songs a free distribution system.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some online music pirates are delivering their musical loot with the
help of free services from America Online, a subsidiary of AOL Time
Warner Inc. and a sister company of one of the world's largest record
labels.</LD>
<LD>   Internet traffic records show that at least two sites offering
pirated music--21century-MP3.com and SimpleMP3s.com--are
surreptitiously using AOL computers and transmission services to
distribute many of the free songs they offer. Unless users of the
sites have special software to trace the source of their downloads,
they have no idea that the songs are coming from AOL.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the pirated song files are disguised as pictures and
stored at AOL's public photo sites. Others are repackaged and cached
on powerful computers that AOL, the world's largest provider of
Internet access, makes available as an electronic warehouse on the
Net.</LD>
<TE>   Record industry officials say AOL is just one of many companies
whose public offerings are hijacked by music pirates. Neither the
Recording Industry Assn. of America nor Warner Music Group, AOL's
corporate sibling, criticize AOL, which they say has been just as
responsive as any company that provides Web sites to the public.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the pirates' resourcefulness is reflected in their ability
to foist a major part of their costs onto companies such as AOL.
They've become a headache not just for copyright owners but also for
Internet-access providers and Web-site companies that unwittingly
store and transmit files on their behalf.</TE>
<TE>   The record companies have waged an escalating legal war against
online pirates, winning several key rulings in U.S. courts. The legal
environment in the United States is so unfavorable to companies
trying to build businesses around piracy that many entrepreneurs have
set up shop in other countries, said Matt Oppenheim, senior vice
president of business and legal affairs at the RIAA.</TE>
<TE>   But even those who aren't based in the U.S. take advantage of the
facilities here. To stretch the dollars they collect for inundating
users with advertising, they look for ways to slash costs by storing
songs on other people's computers and transmitting them from there.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Forest, an independent technology consultant and piracy
expert, said online pirates have been hijacking corporate computer
networks and Internet connections for years. "Let's say you've got 50
gigabytes [of music] to store--that's not that hard to find," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   21century-MP3 and Simple- MP3s, which provide access to several
dozen pirated CDs, have tapped into a few of the free Web services
that AOL offers the general public. AOL provides at least three areas
where people can store and share files, according to spokesman
Nicholas Graham: Web pages, message groups and FTP sites, which
essentially are electronic lockers on the Web.</TE>
<TE>   21century-MP3 obscures the nature of the booty stored on AOL by
repackaging it in a generic format for compressed files. SimpleMP3s
goes one step further, using a camouflaging program to hide the songs
behind pictures or graphics.</TE>
<TE>   For example, a Whitney Houston song was concealed behind a digital
picture of a mountain range, and a song by rock band Filter was
hidden behind an animated butterfly. These changes in format make the
songs more difficult to detect in an automated scan for illicit music
files, Forest said.</TE>
<TE>   Neither company could be reached for comment. According to the
registration records for their Web sites, 21century appears to be a
Portuguese company that uses an Ontario, Canada, company for some of
its Internet access, and SimpleMP3s appears to be based in British
Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   "We at AOL take copyright issues very seriously on the service,
and act to immediately and effectively remove pirated content when
we're made aware of it," Graham said. "We do everything we can to
ensure that content on the AOL service is appropriate and legal when
we're made aware of [problems] by members or copyright owners."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, AOL has taken down some of SimpleMP3s' material--for
example, copies of songs from Moby's most recent CD.</TE>
<TE>   What often happens, though, is that the pirates quickly set up new
sites on AOL to replace the ones knocked offline. Enforcement becomes
a cat-and-mouse game, with the Internet providing a vast playing
field.</TE>
<TE>   AOL limits the amount of material that can be stored on its free
services, Graham said, hoping to make the sites "inappropriate and
inhospitable to a lot of pirated content." But it still has to
provide enough space to let legitimate users do the things they want
to do, such as store family photos.</TE>
<TE>   When the RIAA discovers a pirate site, one of the first things it
typically does is contact the company's Internet provider and ask it
to stop the infringements. The provider usually complies, Oppenheim
said, adding that AOL has been no more of a source of piracy than any
other company offering public storage space on the Web.</TE>
<TE>   But the RIAA also wants such companies to police themselves rather
than simply wait for complaints to roll in.</TE>
<TE>   "If they've got a business based on hosting content, they have an
obligation to have some sense of what's going on, what they're making
their money off of," Oppenheim said. "They should have some sense of
what it is they're hosting."</TE>
<TE>   Graham of AOL responded, "We take all appropriate and lawful
action in terms of protecting our members' privacy and copyright
holders' [property]. It's a careful and practical balance."</TE>
<TE>   AOL tries to encourage its members to report copyright violations
as a primary tool for keeping the service honest, Graham said. "They
understand what illicit service is when they see it and they report
it to us."</TE>
<TE>   Forest said pirate businesses may have to move their inventory and
update their sites continually, "but if you're making your money in
advertising, yeah, it's worth it."</TE>

<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co. and Agilent Technologies Inc. agreed to pay $7
million to the U.S. to settle claims they sold the government
defective medical monitoring devices, lawyers for the plaintiff said.</LD>
<LD>   A suit filed by a former HP engineer had claimed the companies
sold products to the Defense Department and the Department of
Veterans Affairs knowing they failed too often. The government
intervened on behalf of the whistle-blower to pursue the lawsuit.</LD>
<LD>   The products included oxygen and anesthesia monitors.</LD>
<TE>   HP couldn't be reached for comment. Agilent confirmed the
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Palo Alto-based HP rose 88 cents to $13.86, and Agilent, also

<LD>Volkswagen's profit rose 24% in the second quarter as cost savings
outweighed a drop in sales. But Europe's biggest car maker lowered
its full-year forecast on worries about economic growth in the United
States and Europe.</LD>
<LD>   Net profit rose to 776 million euros from 624 million euros in the
year-earlier period, beating analysts' expectations. Volkswagen
shares rose 3% in Frankfurt.</LD>
<LD>   Pretax profit--the yardstick the company and many analysts
use--came in at 1.27 billion euros for the quarter. Analysts'
predictions had been around 1 billion or less.</LD>
<TE>   Still, Volkswagen cut its forecast for the entire year to roughly
4 billion euros in pretax profit, down from its earlier target of
matching last year's figure of 4.41 billion euros.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cardiovascular device maker Guidant Corp. agreed to buy privately
held Cook Group Inc. in deal valued at up to $3 billion in stock,
making good on a vow to stay in the race for drug-coated stents.</LD>
<LD>   The deal, which is subject to several legal and clinical hurdles,
would give Guidant access to Cook's drug-coated stent technology, an
experimental procedure in which tiny wire-mesh tubes coated with
drugs are implanted to keep arteries from clogging.</LD>
<LD>   The deal is especially important to Guidant, which earlier this
year halted its own in-house drug-coated stent program when the drug
compound it was testing proved ineffective.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of companies that announce a big stock acquisition usually
drop, but Guidant shares jumped 5%, or $1.72, to $36.70 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>W.R. Grace, Sealed Air Lose Asbestos Ruling</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>W.R. Grace &amp; Co. and Sealed Air Corp. lost a court ruling that might
make it easier for people alleging asbestos injuries to prove the
chemical maker fraudulently sold a food-packaging company to Sealed
Air in 1998.</LD>
<LD>   A lawsuit against the companies alleges that Grace transferred its
Cryovac division to Sealed Air in 1998 for $1.2 billion and stock in
a move to shield assets from plaintiffs seeking payment for
asbestos-related injuries.</LD>
<LD>   Attorneys for the plaintiffs say Grace sold Cryovac for less than
its actual value, leaving the company unable to pay the potential
damages it faced from future asbestos lawsuits.</LD>
<TE>   Grace has said the sale price was fair and that it didn't foresee
the subsequent flood of asbestos claims that prompted its bankruptcy
filing in April 2001.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. District Judge Alfred Wolin in Newark, N.J., said Grace
should have anticipated those claims when it sold Cryovac.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Sealed Air fell $15.77, or almost 42%, to $22. Grace
shares rose 43 cents to $2.94. Both trade on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Vanguard Airlines Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy amid a
liquidity crunch that forced the low-cost airline to shut down
operations and fire about 1,000 employees.</LD>
<LD>   The Kansas City-based based carrier said it continued to seek
funds in order to resume operations, but Chief Executive Scott
Dickson said the company's shutdown probably would be permanent.</LD>
<LD>   Vanguard's decision came after the Air Transportation
Stabilization Board rejected the airline's fourth request for a
government-backed loan guarantee and talks with a private lender
ended without success.</LD>
<TE>   Aviation officials and a skeleton staff of Vanguard employees
worked to help stranded passengers find flights on other airlines.</TE>
<TE>   Vanguard is the third small U.S. airline to lapse into bankruptcy
after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The company's shares fell 80%, or $1, to 25 cents in
over-the-counter trading.</TE>

<LD>Prosecutors are threatening former ImClone Systems Inc. Chief
Executive Samuel D. Waksal with an unusually lengthy jail sentence
amid a broad move by the government to crack down on corporate
wrongdoing.</LD>
<LD>   Federal prosecutors are demanding that Waksal agree to seven to 10
years in prison as part of a plea bargain, according to a person
familiar with the situation.</LD>
<LD>   Waksal, who was arrested in June and charged with six counts of
securities fraud, two counts of conspiracy and one count of perjury,
is trying to negotiate an agreement under which his father and a
daughter, who also are suspected of insider trading, would be
protected from jail.</LD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citigroup Inc. started a new service to compete with First Data
Corp.'s Western Union and rivals for the estimated $10 billion of
transfers from Mexicans working in the U.S. to their families back
home.</LD>
<LD>   The world's largest financial services company will let U.S.
customers set up transfer accounts that may be accessed by customers
at its Banamex branches in Mexico with a new card, the bank said.</LD>
<LD>   Citigroup plans to charge $7.95 each plus a $5 monthly maintenance
fee for transfers, compared with the $14.99 charged by Western Union,
the world's largest money transfer company.</LD>
<TE>   Competitors include Bank of America Corp., which has started
SafeSend, a service that makes funds available at 20,000 automated
teller machines in Mexico, and Grupo Financiero BBVA Bancomer,
Mexico's biggest bank, which last year reached an agreement with
Wells Fargo &amp; Co. to expand its own transfer service.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nursing home operator Beverly Enterprises Inc. said an increase in
reserves for patient-care lawsuits led to a second-quarter loss.</LD>
<LD>   The company also said a probe into possible government
overpayments to its Fresno-based home medical equipment business
unit, MK Medical, could hurt earnings.</LD>
<LD>   As expected after a July 19 forecast, Beverly reported a net loss
of $14 million, or 13 cents a share, including one-time items,
compared with year-ago earnings of $5.6 million, or 5 cents a share.
Revenue fell 7% to $634.7 million.</LD>
<TE>   Fort Smith, Ark.-based Beverly, which operates 462 nursing homes
and 29 assisted-living centers, also lowered its earnings forecast
for the rest of the year to 12 cents a share for the third quarter
and 13 cents a share for the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Beverly were unchanged at $3.01 on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Sprint Secures New $1.5-Billion Credit Line</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Shares of the phone company rise on the news. CFO
says firm has enough money to repay debts coming due.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sprint Corp. said Tuesday that it received commitments for $1.5
billion in new bank loans, sending shares of the third-biggest U.S.
long-distance telephone company up by 13%.</LD>
<LD>   Sprint has no plans to draw against the unsecured bank line, and
the company has enough money to repay $1.4 billion of debts coming
due in the next 18 months, said Chief Financial Officer Robert
Dellinger.</LD>
<LD>   The new loans "show they are not desperate," said John Maxwell, a
telecommunications analyst at Waddell &amp; Reed Financial, owner of 4.5
million Sprint shares as of March 31.</LD>
<TE>   The phone company received new commitments from its banks--led by
J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. and Citigroup Inc.--in the same month that
rival WorldCom Inc. filed for the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history
and amid concern that Qwest Communications International Inc. may
soon follow.</TE>
<TE>   Sprint has a $3-billion credit line that is due to expire in
August.</TE>
<TE>   The new line replaces a $2-billion loan commitment that runs out
in August 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The new line is good for the next year with an option to extend it
to 2004, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in the worst credit market for telecom ever; this is a
strong vote of confidence for Sprint in a difficult market,"
Dellinger said.</TE>
<TE>   Sprint Chief Executive William Esrey is cutting jobs and capital
expenses and trying to sell the company's Yellow Pages directory unit
to avoid having the company's credit ratings lowered to "junk."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of the Overland Park, Kan., company tumbled 22% Friday on
concern that Sprint may lack cash to fund operations after sales at
its main phone unit dropped for six straight quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Sprint had as much as $4 billion of commercial
paper outstanding.</TE>
<TE>   After its credit ratings were reduced, the company replaced its
commercial paper, or debt maturing in nine months or less, with
longer-term bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Sprint has $650 million in cash, a $500-million borrowing facility
backed by wireless customer accounts and $700 million in borrowings
associated with its directory publishing business, Dellinger said.</TE>

<HD>3 Telecom Execs Vow Woes Won't Disrupt Service</HD>
<DH>Testimony: Qwest, WorldCom and Global Crossing
representatives give assurances during a Senate panel hearing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Executives from three telecommunications firms under investigation
for faulty accounting told worried lawmakers Tuesday that their
firms' legal and financial troubles will not disrupt service or leave
customers stranded.</LD>
<LD>   The executives, representing WorldCom Inc., Qwest Communications
International Inc. and Global Crossing Ltd., gave the assurances
during a Senate Commerce Committee hearing that was focused on ways
to shore up the nation's telecommunications industry. Federal
Communications Commission Chairman Michael K. Powell also appeared to
offer a critique of the situation and to recommend possible remedies.</LD>
<LD>   Powell asked Congress to give the FCC the power to impose much
higher fines on companies that misbehave in the market as well as the
authority to force struggling Internet service providers to give
customers 30 days' notice before shutting down, just as phone
companies are forced to do.</LD>
<TE>   Angry senators, however, found it hard to stick to the subject
amid growing evidence that insiders at the troubled telecom firms
reaped millions of dollars in stock sales, compensation and loans
while their companies collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   Committee members took aim at Global Crossing Chairman Gary
Winnick, who pocketed more than $700 million by selling company
stock, as well as former Qwest Chief Executive Joseph Nacchio, former
Qwest Chairman Philip F. Anschutz and former WorldCom Chief Executive
Bernard J. Ebbers, among others.</TE>
<TE>   All the executives have profited handsomely from their tenures
despite their companies' poor performances. WorldCom, the nation's
No. 2 long-distance provider, recently admitted hiding $3.9 billion
in expenses and on July 21 filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S.
history.</TE>
<TE>   This week, Qwest said three years of accounting was flawed in ways
that inflated revenues and understated some expenses. Given the scope
and duration of the misstatements, people are questioning more than
$500 million of stock sales made by Nacchio, Anschutz and others
while the public got misleading financial data.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing, which filed for bankruptcy protection Jan. 28, is
under investigation for allegedly inflating revenue through sham
transactions with other carriers, including Qwest.</TE>
<TE>   "All three corporations are either in bankruptcy [proceedings] or,
in the case of Qwest, having to restate earnings to a tremendous
degree, and stocks have tanked. Shouldn't you ask for that money back
and distribute it maybe to the stockholders or to the employees who
have been laid off or the retirees whose pensions have been wiped
out?" asked Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.).</TE>
<TE>   Turning to Global Crossing CEO John Legere, McCain asked,
"Shouldn't Mr. Winnick be asked to give some of that $735 million
back that he cashed in?"</TE>
<TE>   Legere responded, "I believe legally, at this point in time, the
company has no rights to the money that Mr. Winnick took unless he is
seen to do something inappropriate." The broader question, he added,
"really is one associated with the pain that's been caused to so many
people.... I don't think that's a legal question. I think it's a
broader personal question that I can't answer. "</TE>
<TE>   Qwest President Afshin Mohebbi and WorldCom CEO John W. Sidgmore
skirted similar questions, noting that their firms will not take
action until internal and government investigations are complete. If
company executives are found to have broken the law, Mohebbi and
Sidgmore pledged to pursue legal action against the individuals.</TE>
<TE>   Given the growing uncertainty about their companies and the
industry, all three executives also stressed that their operations
are continuing without interruption, and that customers are not
getting degraded service.</TE>
<TE>   Despite facing $26 billion in debt and worries about its
stability, Mohebbi assured the committee that "Qwest expects to be
around for a long time, and that the critical telecommunications
services Qwest provides are not in jeopardy."</TE>

<HD>Toyota Had Highest Rise in Carbon Emissions in 1990s, Study
Says</HD>
<DH>Autos: Increase of 72% is largely attributable to car
maker's surge in volume and production of SUVs and pickup trucks,
environmental group reports.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Despite dominating the low-emission hybrid-electric market in the
U.S., Toyota Motor Corp. increased its carbon emissions more than any
other major auto maker in this country in the 1990s, according to an
environmental report released Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The report, by the New York-based group Environmental Defense,
said Toyota increased its carbon emissions by 72% from 1990 to 2000,
the most of any of the Big Six auto makers in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   That was due mainly to Toyota's surge in volume over that period
and its production of more and bigger SUVs and pickup trucks,
Environmental Defense said.</LD>
<TE>   Toyota's increase was not surprising, given the company's growth
in the U.S. since 1990, Toyota spokesman Sam Butto said.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes sense that our growth would be significant, because we
sell a lot more vehicles than in 1990, so naturally there's going to
be a rise in carbon emissions," Butto said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a senior Toyota executive told Bloomberg News that the
auto maker will add more high-mileage hybrid-electric models to its
vehicle lineup soon.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota, which already sells one hybrid in the U.S., the Prius,
will announce plans for more hybrid models in January at the North
American International Auto Show in Detroit, Jim Press, chief
operating officer for Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc., told Bloomberg
News.</TE>
<TE>   He did not identify the model or models that would be announced
but hinted that there would be at least one gas-guzzling sport
utility vehicle introduced.</TE>
<TE>   "An SUV is an ideal platform for the technology, since it would
really take advantage of the performance benefits and offer good fuel
economy," Press was quoted as saying.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota officials were unable to confirm Press' remarks Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   A Japanese business newspaper reported Friday that Toyota would
double the number of its hybrid vehicles to six and export a hybrid
version of the Lexus RX 300 to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota also will produce a hybrid minivan and a hybrid version of
its Crown sedan, similar to its top-selling Camry sedan in the U.S.,
the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said. It did not say whether Toyota would
export either to the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Hybrids mate a gasoline engine with an electric motor, providing
performance similar to that of conventional internal-combustion cars
but with considerably higher mileage and much lower emissions. The
Prius gets about 50 miles a gallon.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota's plan "looks fairly aggressive in launching a variety of
hybrid-electric vehicles," said Christopher Cedergren, an analyst
with the automotive forecasting firm Nextrend in Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   "There's increased pressure from legislation, either for fuel
economy or emissions standards to rise," Cedergren said.</TE>
<TE>   Last week Gov. Gray Davis signed into law a bill requiring auto
makers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions dramatically by the
2009 model year. Auto makers immediately responded that they would
file suit against the legislation in California courts, claiming the
law amounts to mandating fuel economy, something only the federal
government can do.</TE>
<TE>   General Motors Corp., the world's largest auto maker, remains the
largest producer of carbons, with a "carbon burden" of 6.7, meaning
6.7 million metric tons (3 billion pounds) of carbon dioxide emitted
per year, followed by Ford Motor Co. at 5.6 and DaimlerChrysler at
4.1. Toyota, Honda Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Co. round out the Big
Six.</TE>

<HD>T-Note Sale May Require Higher Yields</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters and Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>U.S. government borrowing is set to swell in the next few months, and
analysts are worried the binge is coming just as investors' appetite
for Treasury securities is waning.</LD>
<LD>   Faced with red ink for at least the next three years, the Treasury
today will outline plans to sell as much as $40 billion of five- and
10-year government notes next week.</LD>
<LD>   In recent months, investors ranging from pension funds to small
savers couldn't get enough of super-safe Treasuries while stock
prices fell to five-year lows. But now that many are rediscovering a
taste for equity risk, the government may have to pay higher yields
than planned to find investors who will take its new debt.</LD>
<TE>   On Tuesday the yield on five-year T-notes rose to 3.61% from 3.58%
on Monday and 3.39% on Friday. The 10-year T-note--a benchmark for
mortgage rates--rose to 4.59% from 4.55% on Monday and 4.38% on
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Shorter-term Treasury yields also have resurged in recent days.
The two-year T-note yield closed at 2.42% on Tuesday, up from a
generational low of 2.22% on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The Treasury said Monday that it expected to borrow $76 billion in
the current and final quarter of the government's fiscal year, which
ends in September. That's the largest quarterly borrowing need since
1996 and is up 38% from estimates made in late April, when the
government said it would need to borrow $55 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Federal tax revenues have trailed expectations, in large part
because of a drop in capital gains. Meanwhile, government spending
has jumped in the aftermath of the September terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The Office of Management and Budget has forecast a $165-billion
federal deficit for the current fiscal year, up more than 50% from
estimates in January. The office does not expect the government to
run a modest surplus until fiscal 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street is looking for much higher deficits between now and
2005. As market participants begin anticipating that the Federal
Reserve will raise its benchmark short-term interest rate by late
this year from the current 1.75%, analysts said the Treasury will
have a harder time selling short-term notes to finance the deficit
and will rely more on longer-term securities.</TE>
<TE>   A recovering stock market and stronger economic reports could
ensure that Treasury yields continue to rebound in the next few
months, many analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   But others warn that a U.S. military attack on Iraq, or another
major terrorist attack on U.S. soil, could send investors pouring
back into the Treasury market, pulling yields down again.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi Denies Rumors of Sale of Houghton Mifflin</HD>
<DH>Media: Though seen by some as an obvious asset to shed,
Chairman Fourtou says he doesn't plan to sell the publisher.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CORIE BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seeking to quell rumors that its American textbook publisher is for
sale, Vivendi Universal's new chairman, Jean-Rene Fourtou, sent an
e-mail message Tuesday assuring its publishing chairman that the
Boston-based Houghton Mifflin unit is not for sale.</LD>
<LD>   The news, shared with Houghton Mifflin employees via companywide
e-mail, was greeted with relief. However, Fourtou's second
declaration in as many weeks of what business units he doesn't plan
to sell has increased tensions across Vivendi's other American units,
where employees now are wondering when, or whether, they will receive
similar assurances.</LD>
<LD>   Privately, Fourtou has led American executives at Universal's
studio, theme park and music companies to believe Vivendi plans to
sell those divisions. Still, he has yet to detail his plans, sources
said.</LD>
<TE>   Last week, Fourtou issued a public statement that Vivendi does not
plan to reduce its stake in the company's water and sewer company,
Vivendi Environnement, below its current level of 40.8%.</TE>
<TE>   Since he took over the troubled utility and media company this
month, Fourtou has been clear that Vivendi must sell significant
assets to pare down the $19-billion debt former Vivendi Chairman
Jean-Marie Messier accumulated in the last few years buying American
media properties, including the $2.2-billion purchase last year of
Houghton Mifflin.</TE>
<TE>   Financial analysts and company insiders have speculated that
Houghton Mifflin, an acquisition that has baffled observers, was an
obvious unit to sell.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi's revenue is split evenly between its historic core
utility business and its media business. Vivendi Universal
Publishing, the world's third-largest publishing company, accounts
for a relatively small $4-billion portion of the $28 billion in
annual media revenue. Of that, Houghton Mifflin contributes $1
billion in annual revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Houghton Mifflin, a leading publisher of textbooks, also publishes
the American Heritage Dictionary, J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Lord of the
Rings" trilogy and the Curious George series of children's books.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi Universal declined to comment on Fourtou's message.
However, sources close to the company verified that Fourtou intended
to reassure Houghton Mifflian employees that their company would not
be sold.</TE>
<TE>   According to a copy of the e-mail sent to Vivendi Universal
Publishing Chairman Agnes Touraine, Fourtou wrote: "I just would like
to let you know that all the rumors concerning Houghton Mifflin,
again this morning, are totally unfounded. We are proud of this
Company and of all the integration successes. Houghton Mifflin is in
the [Vivendi Universal Publishing] perimeter and will remain part of
it. Please convey this message to the management."</TE>

<HD>Profits on Track to Show Gain</HD>
<DH>Earnings: On average, blue-chip results are up 0.8% from
the second quarter of 2001.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With nearly 80% of blue-chip companies reporting so far,
second-quarter earnings remain on track to show an overall
year-over-year gain--the first since the fourth quarter of 2000.</LD>
<LD>   But corporate warnings about disappointing third-quarter results
are running at an above-normal pace, which could become an obstacle
for the resurging stock market, analysts say.</LD>
<LD>   As of Tuesday morning, 395 companies in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500
index had reported their quarterly results. Of those, 62% beat
analysts' expectations, while 13% missed estimates and the rest were
on target, according to earnings tracker Thomson First Call in
Boston.</LD>
<TE>   On average, profits were up 0.8% from the second quarter of 2001,
ending the longest losing streak for blue-chip earnings--five
straight quarters of declines--since 1969-70, First Call said.</TE>
<TE>   Profits also are expected to rise in the current quarter: The
average S&amp;P 500 gain from a year earlier will be about 12%, analysts
now estimate. But companies themselves may not be so sure.</TE>
<TE>   In the second quarter, about 1.3 companies warned that profits
would miss Wall Street's forecasts for every firm that boasted it
would beat expectations. That was the lowest ratio First Call had
seen since it began tracking such data about seven years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the ratio is inching up again: So far in the third quarter,
about two companies have warned they'll miss for every one company
that says it will beat estimates.</TE>
<TE>   But some experts say companies are intentionally playing it safe,
given regulators' focus on honesty in corporate reporting of results.</TE>
<TE>   "Managements are bending over backward to be conservative, but the
economy is doing much better than the stock market would be
suggesting," said Kevin Bannon, chief investment officer at BNY Asset
Management. "Earnings will be pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   Investment Advisor</TE>
<TE>   Faces Court Order</TE>
<TE>   Securities regulators have won a court order to force a San Diego
investment advisor to honor subpoenas investigating his claims that
his contrarian investment style made clients "multimillionaires"
despite the long bear market, officials said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Gary Feess ruled Monday that Scott Fraser, who
runs an investment newsletter called "The Natural Contrarian," must
comply with subpoenas issued by the Securities and Exchange
Commission in May.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC has been investigating Fraser for possible violations of
federal securities laws and whether his claim to have made more than
1,000 of his subscribers into "multimillionaires" was true.</TE>
<TE>   Also being probed are his assertions that his stock picks in the
oil and gas sector increased by 1,805%, and that the vast majority of
his recommendations had more than doubled, the SEC said.</TE>
<TE>   After Fraser failed to respond to its administrative subpoenas,
the SEC went to court to seek an enforcement order. Failure to comply
with that federal court order could bring contempt charges, said Lisa
Gok, assistant regional director for the SEC in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   A call to "The Natural Contrarian" newsletter seeking comment was
not returned.</TE>
<TE>   Reuters</TE>
<TE>   Briefly</TE>
<TE>   Woodland Hills-based Panavision Inc. said Tuesday it won't fight
the New York Stock Exchange's decision to delist the shares. They
will trade over-the-counter beginning Monday.</TE>

<HD>Israelis Cancel U.S. Tour</HD>
<DH>Music* The Israel Philharmonic Orchestra's eight-city
engagement with Michael Feinstein is off, including a Bowl date. Slow
ticket sales are cited.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, famed for its commitment to
performing under adverse conditions, has scrubbed an August tour with
singer-pianist Michael Feinstein to eight U.S. cities, including an
Aug. 26 date at the Hollywood Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   Though early reports from Jerusalem attributed the cancellations
to the orchestra's inability to arrange security or insurance, the
orchestra's representatives in the U.S. denied that and said the move
had more to do with slow ticket sales. Suzanne Ponsot, executive
director of the American Friends of the Israel Philharmonic
Orchestra, said the move was forced by the withdrawal of four venues
controlled by SFX Entertainment, a subsidiary of the entertainment
conglomerate Clear Channel. SFX officials declined comment.</LD>
<LD>   Ponsot said she understood that the Clear Channel/SFX venues in
Cleveland, Chicago, Denver and San Francisco "felt they had a poor
response" in advance ticket sales.</LD>
<TE>   In planning for the August performance dates, Ponsot said, the
tour's producers had lined up a private security firm in addition to
the orchestra's in-house security and insurance specialists. Though
one prospective insurer had hesitated in talks with organizers,
Ponsot said, the producers did not expect any problems securing
necessary coverage, and SFX venues never cited insurance as an issue.</TE>
<TE>   "They pulled the plug," said the tour's co-producer, Allen
Sviridoff, speaking of the SFX venues. "One of the elements was slow
ticket sales." As for other reasons, he said, "you have to ask them
directly."</TE>
<TE>   Though Ponsot dismissed the idea that audiences might be
intimidated by the possibility of terrorists targeting the orchestra,
Sviridoff said he did believe a "fear factor" figured in the sluggish
ticket sales in several cities.</TE>
<TE>   At the Shoreline Amphitheater, a Silicon Valley venue booked by
Bill Graham Presents (a subsidiary of SFX Entertainment), publicity
manager Joan Rosenberg said of the performance: "It's just been
canceled. We're not giving a reason at this point."</TE>
<TE>   The orchestra last toured the U.S. in January, when it played to
full or nearly full houses in New York (including two nights in
Carnegie Hall) and Philadelphia. Ponsot said that visit was unmarred
by any worries about security or insurance. She noted that the
orchestra has made it a point of pride to maintain its schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-five years ago, in the early aftermath of the Six-Day War,
the orchestra's musicians took up positions on Jerusalem's Mt. Scopus
and played a concert with violinist Isaac Stern and conductor Leonard
Bernstein. Eleven years ago, when Iraq was lobbing scud missiles
toward Israel in the Gulf War, the orchestra's players sat down again
with Stern, this time under the baton of Zubin Mehta, to play a
concert with gas masks at hand.</TE>
<TE>   The orchestra is scheduled to return to the U.S. (without
Feinstein) for New York performances in January, and a December 2003
tour will include Los Angeles and New York and several other stops,
Ponsot said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the Hollywood Bowl dates, Feinstein and the
orchestra were to perform in Columbus, Ohio (Aug. 20); Cleveland
(Aug. 21); Chicago (Aug. 22); Detroit (Aug. 24); Denver (Aug. 25);
the Shoreline Amphitheater in Silicon Valley (Aug. 27); and Seattle
(Aug. 28).</TE>

<HD>A New Go-Round</HD>
<DH>The coming film 'Signs' is renewing interest in, and debate
over, crop circles. Most can be easily accounted for, but some seem
to defy explanation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT W. WELKOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In M. Night Shyamalan's new sci-fi thriller, "Signs," a Pennsylvania
farmer played by Mel Gibson awakens one morning to discover a
500-foot geometric pattern that has mysteriously appeared in his
cornfield overnight.</LD>
<LD>   Opening Friday, "Signs" marks the first time that a major
Hollywood studio--Disney's Touchstone Pictures--has delved into the
phenomena commonly known as "crop circles," those sprawling and
intricately designed geometric patterns that appear each summer in
the picturesque fields of southwest England and elsewhere.</LD>
<LD>   Long debunked by skeptics as the work of hoaxers, crop circles are
about to get another moment in the sun--compliments of "Signs." Media
interest in the phenomena is higher than it has been in years, with
an assortment of films, television programs, books, videos, magazine
covers and newspaper stories focused on the topic timed to the
release of Shyamalan's film.</LD>
<TE>   There are even plans by a Hartford, Conn., restaurant to sell
"Crop Circle Beer" on tap, brewed from malted barley harvested in the
same fields where many of the mysterious crop formations have
appeared since the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   As the film spawns renewed public curiosity in crop circles, it is
also stirring up a ruckus among passionate devotees of the subject,
true believers and skeptics alike.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything that sort of ignores the truly high strangeness [of the
formations] and the facts [surrounding them] and is basically working
off the back of a phenomenon to do a Friday night thriller is, in the
end, trivializing the phenomenon," said Linda Moulton Howe, author of
the book "Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles" and editor of an online
science and environmental news Web site called www.earthfiles.com.</TE>
<TE>   Others, who seek to debunk the phenomenon by using wooden planks
to create hoax formations, see the Disney film as another case of
Hollywood commercially exploiting the subject by infusing it with
paranormal claptrap instead of offering a more rational explanation
for why crop circles exist.</TE>
<TE>   "What we are doing is propagating our belief system," said London
artist John Lundberg, who with two artist friends, Rod Dickinson and
Wil Russell, claim to have been making crop formations in southwest
England for the past 11 years. "We don't want people to believe in
extraterrestrials."</TE>
<TE>   Shyamalan, whose 1999 ghost thriller "The Sixth Sense" received
six Academy Award nominations, including best picture and director,
tries to downplay any controversy his film might engender.</TE>
<TE>   "I think either side will be happy," he said. "In the course of
the movie, I try to give an explanation for what I think they are
that will probably add to one more possible meaning."</TE>
<TE>   Gibson plays a former minister who initially believes the crop
formation on his land is a prank; his disbelief parallels his loss of
faith in religion. But later, as strange occurrences frighten his
family, Gibson comes to believe that the formation has otherworldly
aspects.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what he believes is behind the crop formations, Shyamalan
chooses his words carefully.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of those funny, little, quirky oddities in the world,"
he said. "Most people think they are bogus, but if only one of them
is true, then you have something that is a real mystery."</TE>
<TE>   Those who follow crop circles say there are many theories advanced
for why the formations have appeared, from psychic powers to
satellite technology to unknown natural energies and, yes,
pranksters.</TE>
<TE>   They also say there are legitimate questions that beg more
scientific research before the formations are dismissed as hoaxes.
Why do the pictograms swirl clockwise and counterclockwise with the
stalks of grain bent, but never broken or kinked? Why have so many
people reported seeing strange "balls of light" hovering over the
fields just before the patterns appear? What are the crackling sounds
that have been associated with many crop circles?</TE>
<TE>   Media interest in crop circles had waned in recent years,
especially after two British men, Doug Bower and Dave Chorley,
claimed in a 1991 interview that they were responsible for making the
formations in England using planks and ropes.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with Disney's movie coming out, Colin Andrews, a leading crop
circle researcher and lecturer from Branford, Conn. who served as a
consultant on the film, said he has been inundated with requests for
interviews by news organizations and TV shows.</TE>
<TE>   "I just did a piece for Russian television this morning, and
yesterday we did the Discovery Channel," Andrews recently said,
adding that the Learning Channel, the History Channel and the ABC
newsmagazine "20/20" also have talked to him.</TE>
<TE>   Andrews does not dispute that many of the formations are the work
of humans. Indeed, of those circles he studied in 1999 and 2000,
Andrews estimated 80% were man-made.</TE>
<TE>   "That did leave 20% where there were no signs of people having
made tracks into these geometric [patterns]," Andrews said.
Meanwhile, a two-hour documentary titled "Crop Circles: Quest for
Truth," is scheduled to open Aug. 23 at the Nuart theater in West Los
Angeles. Filmed by William Gazecki, whose 1997 documentary "Waco: The
Rules of Engagement" shined a harsh spotlight on the FBI's siege of
the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, this new film, he said,
will seek to answer the skeptics. His film includes interviews of at
least two dozen eyewitnesses who give accounts of an invisible force
coming out of nowhere in otherwise calm conditions and spinning the
crops down within seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at the basic numbers, and then job it out like any
construction job," Gazecki said. "Look at how many man-hours it would
take, then what planning and execution it requires, and all with no
mistakes, no half-done ones, and the nights in England in summer are
only 4 1/2 or five hours long. It takes me five hours to draw one of
these things. How do they do it with ropes and planks in the dark?"</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, British director Marcus Thompson is shopping a
new independent film to distributors called "A Place to Stay." The
romantic drama was filmed in and around Wiltshire, England, and uses
crop circles as a key plot device. Although they first appeared as
crude circles in the 1970s, crop formations have grown more elaborate
each summer. Some patterns are as intricate as snowflakes. Others
resembled serpents or ziggurats. One formation discovered in July
1996, called the "Triple Julia Set," spiraled nearly 1,000 feet and
consisted of about 700 circles.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Carson, who owns a 2,200-acre farm in Wiltshire, said one
appeared in August on his farm that still defies easy explanation.
Called the "Galaxy Spiral Arm," it consisted of 409 circles and
spread over 11 acres of wheat in an area of his farm called Milk
Hill, about 15 miles from Stonehenge.</TE>
<TE>   "You couldn't really make it out from the ground," Carson
recalled, noting that whoever created the crop pattern managed the
feat in a few hours over undulating ground. It was also a drizzly
evening, he noted, when "clouds were sitting on top of the hill."</TE>
<TE>   The farmer noted that no one heard or saw anything that night. "I
would love to see them do that," Carson remarked.</TE>
<TE>   But hoaxers say the trick isn't that difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "All you need is a pencil, a compass and a ruler to design it on
paper," explained Matthew Williams of Bishop's Cannings, a village in
England's crop circle country, who was arrested in connection with
trespassing on a farmer's land last year while on his way to make a
crop circle.</TE>
<TE>   Californian Peter Sorensen, a videographer who claims to have made
about a dozen crop formations with a small team of friends over the
years, said they use a computer to create the elaborate patterns,
then head into the fields and use "stomping boards" to press down the
grain stalks.</TE>
<TE>   Hoaxers and believers alike claim to have seen strange sights
while standing out in the fields of Wiltshire at night.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Russell, president of Midwest Research in Aurora, Colo., who
travels to England each summer to conduct experiments on new crop
circles, said he and others have been in the fields at night when
"balls of light" appear.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know what they are," Russell said. "The best sighting I
ever had was hard to explain. The first thing I saw, it was on the
horizon. It was like a planet, but too bright to be a planet.
Suddenly, without warning, it accelerated and was moving with great
speed. It went straight above us. We saw it go bright and dim and
must have winked out in the clouds. We were all going, 'What was
that?' "</TE>

<HD>Taper Postpones 'Homebody/Kabul'</HD>
<DH>Theater* The planned season opener is put off for a year so
Tony Kushner can rework it. A substitute hasn't been set.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA FUNG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Homebody/Kabul," the new play about Afghanistan by Pulitzer
Prize-winning playwright Tony Kushner that was to open the 2002-03
season at the Mark Taper Forum, has been postponed for a year.</LD>
<LD>   "I wanted a breather and time to look at it again and make
decisions about a director and all sorts of other things--and this
September felt rushed," Kushner said.</LD>
<LD>   Taper artistic director Gordon Davidson said that the production,
to be directed by Frank Galati, will open the 2003-04 season,
following a run at Chicago's Steppenwolf Theatre.</LD>
<TE>   Davidson said he and the playwright mutually agreed to the delay
to allow Kushner to do additional work on the play, which had its
world premiere in December 2001 at the off-Broadway New York Theatre
Workshop. It has gone on to productions in Berkeley; Providence,
R.I.; and London.</TE>
<TE>   "Rather than simply say we scheduled it and have to do it, I said
we'll delay it if you're still willing to do the work," Davidson
said.</TE>
<TE>   When "Homebody" opened in New York last year within months of the
attacks on the World Trade Center, critics generally responded
positively, calling the play "eerily prescient" and "uncannily
topical" because of its discussion of the Taliban and U.S.
involvement in Afghanistan. Yet while the New York Times' Ben
Brantley called the work "a fusion of politics, poetry and boundless
empathy transformed through language into passionate, juicy theater,"
he also referred to the nearly four-hour production as "lumbering yet
compelling."</TE>
<TE>   Kushner won the Pulitzer Prize in 1993 for "Angels in America," a
two-part epic on the AIDS crisis, which had its world premiere at the
Taper in 1992-93. An HBO film version of that play, which will
feature Al Pacino, Meryl Streep and Emma Thompson, is in the works.
In addition, Kushner is collaborating with Jeanine Tesori and George
C. Wolfe on the musical "Caroline or Change," which will begin
workshops in October at New York's Public Theater.</TE>
<TE>   Among other projects, he is also working on a film for Paramount
and is collaborating with Maurice Sendak on an American version of
the children's opera "Brundibar," which will premiere in Chicago.
And, he says, he is working on "a contemporary play that addresses a
gay subject matter."</TE>
<TE>   Davidson said he has not selected a replacement for
"Homebody/Kabul," which was to open on Sept. 19. "I'm hot on the
trail of two other plays," he said, but he declined to name them.</TE>

<DH>The colorful history of the popular genre shines in an
academy exhibition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new exhibition at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
offers an illustrated history lesson about animation and a glimpse
inside the meticulous processes used to create an animated film.</LD>
<LD>   "Oscars in Animation," which opens Thursday at the Grand Lobby and
Fourth Floor Galleries at the academy, features rare and original
animation art spanning seven decades from 1932--when the first
Academy Award was presented in the category of animation--to the
present. The exhibition includes color cels, drawings, storyboards
and 3-D character models from such films as 1932's "Flowers and
Trees" (the first Technicolor short and the first to win the Oscar),
"Dumbo," "The Lion King," "Toy Story" and "Shrek."</LD>
<LD>   The exhibit showcases the work of such animators as Walt Disney,
Chuck Jones, Cordell Barker, George Pal and John Lasseter, along with
work by several generations of Disney animators.</LD>
<TE>   Mike Glad and the Glad Family Trust have donated the majority of
the material featured in the exhibition. Glad has been collecting
animation art since he was 7 and has kept the material in vaults at
his home.</TE>
<TE>   The material is in mint condition--even simple line drawings from
Disney short films "Flowers and Trees" and "Ferdinand the Bull"
(1938) look like they could have been drawn yesterday. The color cels
are as vibrant now as they were seven decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   Glad has collaborated with the academy on several animation
exhibitions, including one on puppets and another on the best of
Soviet animation.</TE>
<TE>   Perusing his vaults at home, he realized the extraordinary
material he had of work that had won or been nominated for Oscars.</TE>
<TE>   "It just became so apparent that the scope and depth of his
collection was so much greater than we were able to do justice to in
previous exhibits," says Robert Smolkin, manager of special events
and exhibitions for the academy.</TE>
<TE>   The only weakness in his collection is in the field of computer
animation. "There just isn't original art because it is all
computer-generated and there are no cels to collect," says Smolkin.
"There are some concept drawings, but his collection was lacking in
that area. So we did go directly to various production houses like
Pixar and DreamWorks."</TE>
<TE>   Pixar, DreamWorks and Aardman Animation ("Wallace &amp; Gromit") in
England have supplied early concept drawings and models from such
films as "Toy Story," "Shrek" and "A Close Shave."</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition shows how artists were given free reign in their
early concept drawings for an animated project. A beautiful early
color drawing from Disney's "Snow White," for example, looks as if it
stepped out of the pages of an illustrated Germanic fairy tale book.</TE>
<TE>   "You see how the artists' minds were working and you can imagine
the kind of discussion that was going on between Walt and his
animators as they conceived these ideas," says Smolkin.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition also illustrates how the color schemes changed in
Disney's animated films during the 1930s. The early Technicolor
cartoons such as "Flowers and Trees" and "The Three Little Pigs" used
bold colors. "By the later 1930s, the work became more subdued," says
Glad. "There was a tremendous styling change. Some of the early 'Snow
White' drawings are very bright and primary, but if you look at the
final product, it's toned down."</TE>
<TE>   In conjunction with the exhibition, the Academy Standards
Screening will present an evening of Oscar-winning animated shorts in
the Samuel Goldwyn Theater on Aug. 16. Among the cartoons to be
screened are Disney's "The Ugly Duckling," Chuck Jones' "The Dot and
the Line" and Nick Parks' "The Wrong Trousers."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Oscars in Animation" is on display at the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences, 8949 Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills,
through Oct. 6. The hours are 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Tuesdays-Fridays, and
noon to 6 p.m. on weekends. Admission to the exhibition is free.

<LD>   Dylan May Inaugurate Reconstructed Wiltern</LD>
<LD>   Bob Dylan is expected to be the inaugural headliner for the
remodeled Wiltern Theatre, playing a multiple-night engagement in
mid-October.</LD>
<TE>   The historic Art Deco facility at the corner of Wilshire Boulevard
and Western Avenue in Los Angeles has been closed since early June
for a reconfiguration. Seats on the main floor are being removed to
create an open, general-admission setting, but the seats in the
balcony will remain.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel Entertainment's Los Angeles concert promotion
division, which operates the Wiltern, would not confirm the plans,
but sources said that Dylan is being booked for as many as five
nights during the week of Oct. 14. A series of special shows the
following week is also being lined up, with Bryan Adams, Ani DiFranco
and N.E.R.D. each expected to headline a night.</TE>
<TE>   A Nov. 4 engagement by the Rolling Stones is the only show at the
reconstructed Wiltern that has been officially announced.</TE>

<TE>   'Frida' to Open Venice Film Festival</TE>
<TE>   "Frida," the long-awaited biography of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo,
will open the 59th Venice Film Festival, which runs Aug. 29-Sept. 8.
The film, directed by Julie Taymor, stars Salma Hayek and Antonio
Banderas.</TE>
<TE>   The festival consists of two competitions: Venezia 59, in which 21
films expected to have wide appeal will battle for a Golden Lion; and
Countercurrent, with 17 movies considered less mainstream vying for
best film.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to "Frida," another key film in the Venezia 59
competition is Sam Mendes' "Road to Perdition," starring Tom Hanks
and Paul Newman. Steven Soderbergh's "Full Frontal" will compete in
the Countercurrent section.</TE>
<TE>   TELEVISION</TE>
<TE>   Horowitz Sues Over Defunct PBS Series</TE>
<TE>   Two of Hollywood's leading Republicans--writer Lionel Chetwynd
(the 1995 TV movie "Kissinger and Nixon") and the Center for the
Study of Popular Culture President David Horowitz--have had a falling
out. Things came to a head in a lawsuit Horowitz filed July 19 in Los
Angeles Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is a company, Whidbey Island Films, that won funding for
a PBS series called "National Desk," running from 1997-2000. Horowitz
claims that he helped to create the company and participated in
fund-raising. But after then-PBS President Ervin S. Duggan delivered
an ultimatum to Chetwynd, he says, he was forced to resign. The
network executive was said to be miffed at Horowitz's criticism of
PBS.</TE>
<TE>   Horowitz maintains that he patched things up with PBS and that an
oral agreement permitted him to return once the dispute was resolved.</TE>
<TE>   The political commentator is seeking damages for what he charges
was fraud and breach of fiduciary duty. He contends that Chetwynd and
Norman Powell, Whidbey vice president, weren't leveling with him when
they said their company wasn't making any money from the production
of the shows for public TV.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Brifman, Chetwynd's lawyer, noted that Whidbey Island Films
was a nonprofit company and maintained that the case is without
merit. ."I'm confident that the allegations will prove to be
unfounded if and when the case gets in front of a jury," he said
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Rescue of Miners Draws an Audience</TE>
<TE>   The rescue of nine Pennsylvania miners drew audiences roughly six
times what cable news networks CNN and Fox News Channel would expect
on a sleepy weekend night.</TE>
<TE>   CNN averaged 2.3 million viewers between 8 p.m. and midnight
Saturday, when the miners were pulled up by jubilant rescue workers.
Normally, CNN's viewership is 319,000 at this time, according to
Nielsen Media Research.</TE>
<TE>   It was a similar story at Fox News Channel, whose average of 2.1
million viewers at that time was 580% higher than its average of
306,000.</TE>
<TE>   CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC collectively were watched by
roughly 5.2 million people between 10:30 and 11 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   MUSIC</TE>
<TE>   Most of 'Mostly Mozart' Halted by Strike</TE>
<TE>   "Mostly Mozart," the popular summer music festival presented at
Lincoln Center in New York City, canceled 17 concerts in the wake of
a Monday afternoon vote to strike by the Mostly Mozart Festival
Orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   Though agreement had been reached on issues such as wages,
pension, health benefits and work conditions, the stumbling block
proved to be a provision governing the non-renewal of tenured
musicians for artistic reasons.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Local 802--the New York City musicians union--said
that the final offer didn't give the group's players enough
protection against dismissal. The contract between the union and the
venue expired in February. Though Lincoln Center was willing to
implement the financial increase while discussions continued, the
orchestra's negotiating committee voted to strike instead.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Overcoming past resistance to selling its TV movies to
distributors, HBO will be releasing "Real Women Have Curves," winner
of the audience award at this year's Sundance Film Festival,
theatrically in October, in association with Newmarket Films.... John
Lee Hancock ("The Rookie") will be taking the reins of Disney's
historical epic, "The Alamo," Variety reports. Ron Howard, the
original director, is staying on as a producer.</TE>

<HD>Illusions of Water and Power</HD>
<DH>James Casebere built small models, flooded most with water,
lighted them exquisitely, then produced extraordinary photographs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEAH OLLMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Warnings, perhaps. Images gleaned from collective memory. Seductive
fictions.</LD>
<LD>   James Casebere's extraordinary new photographs at Grant Selwyn
Fine Arts ride their multiplicity with grace. They are gorgeous, but
at the same time, disquieting. They reference history, but with
tremendous sensual immediacy.</LD>
<LD>   "From the beginning," Casebere has said, "I had a tendency to
conflate personal and social history--or psychological and political
content."</LD>
<TE>   The beginning, in terms of Casebere's career, was more than 20
years ago, and the tendency he describes has coursed through work
that's grown increasingly complex and refined. The 10 new pictures
here are big (displayed at 4 feet by 5 feet) digital chromogenic
prints mounted on Plexiglas. Each depicts an interior of convincing
texture and human scale that is actually a small cardboard and
plaster model built by Casebere in his New York studio and
exquisitely lighted for each photograph. The illusionistic quality
alone is stunning (though intentionally not seamless). The body reads
these spaces as accessible, functional, congruent with its own scale.</TE>
<TE>   Several images position us at the end of a vaulted passageway,
monastic in its austerity. Windows and arched doorways set deep
within thick gray walls send raking light onto the dusty floor. The
emptiness of the space is profound, as if not just vacant but
abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the other photographs show rooms whose colored walls
(yellow, green) and crisp architectural trim relate to settings in
the Palace of Versailles and Jefferson's home, Monticello. They are
elegant spaces, spaces of authority and wealth. But Casebere has
flooded them, and the layer of water--which burns white or sends
spidery yellow veins flickering on the walls--pushes splendor into
the past tense. Power has passed from these places, their authority
rinsed by the primordial flood.</TE>
<TE>   Casebere twists together allegory and document into something
smooth, sophisticated, engrossing and tantalizingly elusive. The
narrative possibilities suggested by these sets are myriad, and the
power they command as images has to do with their very ambiguity.</TE>
<TE>   Casebere's own editorial restraint is, in part, what allows us to
venture in, to occupy the scenes, to intuit their power, and to waver
between feelings of solitude and isolation, in spaces that evoke both
sanctuary and cell.</TE>

<HD>Paul McCartney, Liz Taylor on Kennedy Center List</HD>

will also be honored in ceremonies. *</DH>

<LD>Conductor James Levine, musician Paul McCartney, actors James Earl
Jones and Elizabeth Taylor, and actress-dancer Chita Rivera will
receive the Kennedy Center Honors of 2002 for their lifetime
contributions to the performing arts, the center announced Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The 25th annual honorees will be celebrated Dec. 8 at a gala
performance at the Opera House at Washington, D.C.'s John F. Kennedy
Center for the Performing Arts. The gala will feature artists from
around the world, with the president and the first lady in
attendance. The honors will be bestowed the night before the gala at
a State Department dinner hosted by Secretary of State Colin Powell.</LD>
<LD>   Rivera, who appears on stage through Sept. 1 at downtown's Mark
Taper Forum in Federico Garcia Lorca's "The House of Bernarda Alba,"
said in a telephone interview Tuesday that she found out she would be
on the honoree list from her brother, who is her manager. "I thought
he was joking," she said with a laugh. "Dancers are so used to being
workhorses--it's all over those T-shirts: 'Shut up and dance.' You
are stopped dead in your tracks when something like this happens.
I've stood on that stage so many times, performing in honor of my
peers, with tears in my eyes, being so proud for them. It's
wonderful, knowing that this time I'll be standing there, next to the
president."</LD>
<TE>   Jones, who has attended several Kennedy Center Honors events as a
guest, joked that at 71 he is the "senior in this group" of honorees.
"I can't compare it to anything else. There's no gathering like it,
it is attended by every level of society and every level of
government," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great honor to be amongst such talented and prestigious
company," said Taylor through spokesman Warren Cowan. "I'm thrilled
and thank all who made this possible."</TE>
<TE>   The honors gala will be broadcast on CBS as a two-hour prime time
special in December, with date and time to be announced. George
Stevens Jr., who created the honors in 1978 with Nick Vanoff, will
produce and co-write the show for the 25th consecutive year. Don
Mischer will produce with Stevens.</TE>
<TE>   The honorees are selected by the Kennedy Center board of trustees
along with an artists committee and past honorees. Among those making
this year's recommendations: Edward Albee, Jason Alexander, Carol
Burnett, Johnny Cash, Terrence McNally, Brian Stokes Mitchell, Arturo
Sandoval, Stephen Sondheim and Robin Williams.</TE>

<HD>Summer Films: Midterm Report</HD>
<DH>It's been hit-or-miss, but compared with last year ('Pearl
Harbor,' 'Planet of the Apes'), we're thriving. Emily Mortimer in
'Lovely &amp; Amazing' is a highlight.</DH>

<LD>Somebody at the American Movie Classics channel must have a thing for
George Peppard. Lately, it seems as if every time I pass by AMC while
surfing toward "Baseball Tonight" or "SpongeBob SquarePants," there's
Peppard from some 1960s movie wearing that grim, blue-eyed visage
that some studio hack swore would make him as big as Steve McQueen.</LD>
<LD>   They're even showing "The Blue Max" from 1966. "The Blue Max"?
Even when I first saw it as a 14-year-old aerospace junkie, I was
bored stupid by everything in it except the dogfights and Ursula
Andress.</LD>
<LD>   Peppard eventually learned to loosen up, and by the late 1970s he
was no longer embarrassing. He was even funny--as anyone will admit
who has the honesty to confess to watching "The A-Team" for cheap
giggles. Maybe these multiple screenings of "The Blue Max" and "The
Carpetbaggers" (1964) are supposed to loosen us up for the
all-but-inevitable big-screen version of "The A-Team." No joke. It's
being planned as we speak. Makes you wonder why they're not putting
such Mr. T classics as "Rocky III" and "D.C. Cab" into the cable
rotation.</LD>
<TE>   So there's really no hope, right? Will all our movie summers from
now until the second Ice Age (and no, I do not mean the sequel to the
animated film) be recycled pop from the cultural junk heap? Is it
possible the public imagination will become so parched that last
year's ratings champ will become next year's summer blockbuster?</TE>
<TE>   With such grim prospects, it might even be possible to look back
on this movie summer as we do to 1977, the summer of "Annie Hall" and
"Star Wars." Now that we're in its midsection, Popcorn Summer 2002
seems a vast improvement when compared with the collection of
deflated balloons, such as "Pearl Harbor" and "Planet of the Apes,"
that littered the multiplexes a year ago. Still, there are some
qualifications here and there.</TE>
<TE>   "Spider-Man" was a rousing keynote to the season. "The Sum of All
Fears" served its time as a batty little conversation piece for a
week or two, but "The Bourne Identity" is by far the better spy
thriller. So far, the family films have been a balanced selection of
effervescent little surprises ("Lilo &amp; Stitch," "The Powerpuff Girls
Movie"), bland, but tasty eye candy ("Spirit: Stallion of the
Cimarron," "Stuart Little 2," "Like Mike") and passable
disappointments ("Hey Arnold! The Movie"). All of them made time go
faster than "Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones," no matter
how cool Yoda's sword fight was toward the end.</TE>
<TE>   Not far beneath the cheap laughs, latex and grinding metal in "Men
in Black II," there's the soothing sound of people endorsing their
checks. I really do hope, though, that the director, Barry
Sonnenfeld, hasn't signed off on his career. Same goes for Kathryn
Bigelow, despite the languor that eventually swamps "K-19: The
Widowmaker."</TE>
<TE>   Critics seem to have embraced "Minority Report" and "Road to
Perdition" as the season's best. Both of them look terrific enough to
draw you into their vastly different worlds. But while "Report" gives
encouraging signs of Steven Spielberg's deepening command of
science-fiction verisimilitude, it doesn't haunt your dreams the way
last year's undervalued (and, in retrospect, even
greater-than-one-first-believed) "A.I. Artificial Intelligence."</TE>
<TE>   As for "Perdition," absorbing visuals (courtesy of peerless
cinematographer Conrad L. Hall) and impressive staging can't quite
hide its conceptual weaknesses--which, given the Dickensian nature of
the graphic novel that inspired the movie, may have been unavoidable.
Tom Hanks and Paul Newman both look haunted and ravaged. But I
honestly can't tell if they deserve all this premature Oscar hype,
because the script gives neither of them anything interesting to say.</TE>
<TE>   And what, by the way, ever happened to waiting for Christmas to
flog for Oscars? Even Harrison Ford is being touted for academy
consideration for glowering with a Russian accent in "K-19"--at least
he was before that movie's dismal opening weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody asked me, but the one performance I've seen this summer
that should be a no-brainer come awards time is Emily Mortimer's
heartbreakingly insecure actress in Nicole Holofcener's "Lovely &amp;
Amazing," a "chick movie" with sharp teeth.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Mortimer, in bed with a loutish movie star (Dermot
Mulroney, who's also terrific), asks him to give an "honest"
assessment of her physical attributes. She stands naked in front of
him and us--as she gets exactly what she asks for.</TE>
<TE>   Looking at Mortimer's tense, avid face throughout this ordeal, you
can't tell whether she's happy or disappointed that her worst fears
haven't been confirmed by this survey. It's this kind of grace under
pressure that deserves a presidential citation for valor more than a
mere Academy Award.</TE>

<HD>Crime and Solving It Pays for Networks</HD>

<LD>Crime paid last week, as NBC's "Law &amp; Order" franchise buoyed that
network, while "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation"--the most-watched
show for the fourth time in six weeks--helped CBS post a narrow
victory, according to viewing estimates issued Tuesday by Nielsen
Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   For the most part, unscripted shows such as NBC's "Dog Eat Dog,"
Fox's "American Idol" and CBS' "Big Brother 3" (which hit a ratings
high last Wednesday) have served their purpose, helping stem the tide
of ratings erosion during the summer. Viewing of those three
networks, in fact, was virtually unchanged compared to the
corresponding period a year ago, though ABC is still struggling--down
nearly 30% last week versus 2001, with only "PrimeTime Thursday"
cracking the top 25.</LD>
<LD>   NBC's latest fill-in, "Meet My Folks," opened to promising tune-in
July 22 but dropped a third off that plateau with the second
installment. "Crime and Punishment"--the latest addition to the "Law
&amp; Order" family--also put up its highest rating since premiering in
June.</LD>
<TE>   Among cable offerings, "Sex and the City" again attracted stellar
tune-in by HBO's standards, with 6.6 million viewers Sunday, though
the audience dropped sharply for the programs that followed, "Arli$$"
and "The Wire." USA is also doing well with its dramas "Monk" and
"The Dead Zone."</TE>

<TE>   National Nielsen Viewership</TE>
<TE>   Here are the rankings for national prime-time network television
last week (July 22-28) as compiled by Nielsen Media Research. They
are based on the average number of people who watched a program from
start to finish. Nielsen estimates there are 269 million potential
viewers in the U.S. age 2 and older. Viewership is listed in
millions.</TE>

<HD>'Meet the Marks' Misses the Mark</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1947, a World War II veteran just out of the service came up with
an idea that he figured was a can't-miss proposition for a radio
show: Put regular folks into kooky situations, then capture their
reactions on a hidden tape recorder.</LD>
<LD>   But Allen Funt's problem with his "Candid Microphone" concept was
that the recording equipment of the day wasn't very portable, so he
had to get his "marks" into his office before the fun could begin.</LD>
<LD>   Funt would refine his idea into the "Candid Camera" TV show the
next year, creating a lucrative juggernaut that his son, Peter,
carries on to this day on the Pax network.</LD>
<TE>   Success spawns imitators, of course, and there have been countless
"Candid" clones through the years. But the latest, "Meet the Marks"
(tonight at 8:30 on Fox), has garnered only lackluster ratings since
debuting two weeks ago. Whereas the utter simplicity of "Candid
Camera's" execution was its charm, the Fox show's leering "More Is
More" philosophy may be a stumbling block.</TE>
<TE>   "Meet the Marks" takes sitcom situations using a faux family of
actors, the suburban Marks clan, and then plops unsuspecting people
into the middle of the proceedings. Like "Candid Microphone," the
action takes place in one location, an upscale house that was gutted
to allow for the placement of a dozen hidden cameras.</TE>
<TE>   In one segment (there are two per half-hour show), a rent-a-clown
arrives for what he believes will be a children's party, only to find
a bachelorette soiree waiting for a male stripper. And the ladies
aren't in the mood for any clowning around.</TE>
<TE>   Most episodes have the feel of a skit that overstays its welcome.
Somehow I don't think we'll still be talking about "Meet the Marks" a
half-century from now.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>The Afghan capital's chaotic traffic and a tip from foreign
intelligence foiled a suicide car bombing that would have been
"beyond comprehension," an Afghan intelligence official said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   In the Monday incident, the would-be bomber's vehicle collided
with another near the U.S. Embassy, intelligence official Amonullah
Barakzai said. The driver sped away and police cornered his Toyota
Corolla station wagon at a checkpoint, where they found it was packed
with half a ton of explosives, Barakzai said.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators said the main suspect was believed to be a foreigner
and an Al Qaeda member. "He was on a suicide mission," Barakzai said.
"It was beyond comprehension." An alleged Afghan accomplice was
arrested, but a second escaped, said Gen. Din Mohammed Jurat, chief
of the Interior Ministry police.</LD>
<TE>   The accident occurred near the fortress-like embassy, President
Hamid Karzai's offices and the headquarters of the international
security force that patrols the capital. Jurat said interrogation of
the suspects indicated that their preferred target was an Afghan
leader and that the peacekeepers' base was the next choice.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators determined that the car bomb mission originated in
or passed through the southeastern cities of Khowst and Gardez, Jurat
said.</TE>

<LD>   A military court convicted 16 members of the outlawed Muslim
Brotherhood on charges of conspiring against the government and
sentenced them to up to five years in prison.</LD>
<TE>   The convictions were derided by the defendants, mostly academics
and professionals, as a politically motivated attempt to reassure
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Amnesty International and the Egyptian Organization for Human
Rights also criticized the case, saying civilians should not be tried
in a military court and urging their immediate release. The verdicts
cannot be appealed; only President Hosni Mubarak can overturn them.</TE>

<HD>In Latin America, Abuse by Priests Hidden in Shadows</HD>
<DH>Culture: Reverence for the clergy, machismo and distrust of
judges make speaking out difficult.</DH>

<DL>APOPA, El Salvador</DL>
<LD>When Pope John Paul II spoke out on the church's pedophile priest
scandals for the first time this week, he did it on the eve of a trip
through a region that has scarcely been touched by them: Latin
America.</LD>
<LD>   Even as hundreds of priests and bishops from the U.S. to Poland
have been implicated in the abuse of children, only a handful of
cases have come to light in a population that accounts for about 30%
of the world's Roman Catholics.</LD>
<LD>   The church's power, the region's bankrupt judicial systems and a
culture that abhors homosexuality have combined to create enormous
barriers to claims of priestly abuse, experts say.</LD>
<TE>   Few doubt that such abuses occur in Latin America with the same
rare frequency as in other parts of the world. But here, they appear
to be easier to conceal.</TE>
<TE>   "Here, priests are sacred, almost godlike. They have total power.
No common person is going to take them to court," said Sergio Bran, a
sociologist at the University of Central America in El Salvador who
has long studied the Roman Catholic Church.</TE>
<TE>   At an outdoor Mass in Toronto on Sunday, the pope told hundreds of
thousands of followers that ''the harm done ... to the young and
vulnerable fills us all with a deep sense of sadness and shame.''</TE>
<TE>   Individual cases have been reported in Bolivia, Colombia and
Venezuela. Three priests in Chile have been sued in connection with
alleged pedophilia incidents. And former students have long accused a
papal ally in Mexico of repeated abuses. The Rev. Marcial Maciel,
founder of a conservative order known as the Legion of Christ, has
vehemently denied the accusations.</TE>
<TE>   Here in this booming suburb of factory workers and fast-food
chains, it took a most uncommon man to bring to light one of the few
known cases of pedophilia in Central America.</TE>
<TE>   William Hernandez, 31, the leader of a local gay rights group, is
a rarity in El Salvador: an openly bisexual man. His advocacy has
come at a cost to his safety--he is always accompanied in public by
police protection.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Hernandez formally accused a Catholic priest of
having abused him nearly 15 years ago. The Salvadoran church opened
an ecclesiastical trial against the priest, Luis Recinos, who has
reportedly moved to Rome. He has denied the charge.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez's story helps explain why so few pedophilia cases have
been made public in Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   Charismatic Priest</TE>
<TE>   Recinos took over the squat white church that overlooks the
central square in Apopa in 1988. He made it his mission to energize
the region, which had long been overlooked in the shadow of the
nearby capital, San Salvador. He built new churches in rural areas,
constructed a community hall and created teams of lay clergy to visit
the poor.</TE>
<TE>   Parishioners loved his forceful, charismatic style.</TE>
<TE>   "I have lived a long time in Apopa, and nobody has ever done what
he did. He wanted to make the church into a utopia for the people,"
said Luz Estrella Rodriguez, a city councilor who worked with
Recinos.</TE>
<TE>   Recinos made Hernandez, then 16, his personal assistant. And he
began to make sexual advances, Hernandez said.</TE>
<TE>   At first, there were just hugs and tender kisses, but then,
Hernandez said, Recinos demanded oral sex. The priest would beat him
when he refused.</TE>
<TE>   Although Hernandez was a young man, he said he didn't fight back.
Like many Catholic faithful in Latin America, the idea of challenging
a priest was unthinkable.</TE>
<TE>   "My religious background limited my ability to respond," he said.
"I was raised in a strictly Catholic home. I would never think of
raising my hand against a priest."</TE>
<TE>   It was also difficult to tell anyone about the alleged abuse.</TE>
<TE>   In Latin America's macho culture, the myth persists--especially in
the case of males who have been raped--that the victim of a sexual
attack is somehow to blame for the crime.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't see the boy as a victim, but as a coward, an
effeminate person," sociologist Bran said. "The macho culture is very
cruel. It doesn't recognize victimhood."</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez ran away in 1989, after a year of abuse, he said. But it
wasn't until two years ago that he decided to report Recinos, after a
friend told him that he, too, had been abused by Recinos as a
teenager.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez wasn't the only one complaining about Recinos.</TE>
<TE>   Before coming to Apopa, Recinos had been accused of molesting boys
at a previous parish. He was sent to Rome to study theology for a
year, then returned to El Salvador, where he began abusing Hernandez,
according to a church official investigating the case.</TE>
<TE>   Rumors of abuse surfaced again in 1998, and Recinos was sent to
Rome for a second time. He returned to yet another parish.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez said his complaint in 2000 seemed to have no effect.</TE>
<TE>   "I talked with the bishop. His only response was, 'When you leave,
shut the door.' I got up, I left, and I didn't shut the door,"
Hernandez said.</TE>
<TE>   This May, when the U.S. scandal was at its height, Hernandez
decided to complain again. This time, the church opened the formal
ecclesiastical tribunal against Recinos.</TE>
<TE>   Top church officials say the evidence they have collected points
to his guilt.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe this case has merit," said one top church official,
speaking on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Recinos couldn't be reached for comment. But the bishop who is
defending him in the tribunal said the priest has denied the charges
against him.</TE>
<TE>   "He asked me to pray for him and said, 'I hope you can help me,' "
Bishop Rafael Urrutia said.</TE>
<TE>   'I Have Recuperated'</TE>
<TE>   Church officials insisted that they had always taken the reports
of abuse seriously. But they said they were won over by Recinos'
declarations that he had reformed himself.</TE>
<TE>   The church "acted, because it separated him from his parish," said
Bishop Ricardo Urioste, who is in charge of the council investigating
Recinos. "He told us, 'I have recuperated,' and the church believed
him."</TE>
<TE>   Urioste also dismissed the idea that the church's power, or a
cultural bias against sexual victimhood, accounted for the lack of
cases in Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he suggested that there were simply fewer Latin American
priests disposed to attacking children.</TE>
<TE>   And, he insisted, the church in El Salvador is acting aggressively
to root out any deviant priests.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been very clear that anyone can approach the tribunal,"
Urioste said. "Everyone has a right to approach the church."</TE>
<TE>   But an influential Catholic cleric in San Salvador told The Times
that the church suspects at least three other priests in El Salvador
of having abused children. None of the men has been reported to civil
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Church leaders, he said, simply feel that such matters are best
handled internally.</TE>
<TE>   "The church still has not confronted this problem decisively. This
is something that everybody knows about but nobody talks about," said
the leader, who did not want to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   "They have not opened the doors on this problem, only let in a
little light through some windows," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The reluctance to approach civil authorities, however, is not
confined to the church. Unlike in the United States, where many of
the abuse incidents came to light through civil actions, few people
in Latin America trust the judicial system.</TE>
<TE>   There is no culture of civil litigation in the region, where
judges are often paid off, trials can take years and the system seems
tilted to favor the powerful.</TE>
<TE>   A final problem comes on the criminal side. Police investigations
often fail. Conviction rates are astoundingly low throughout Latin
America.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Melida Rivera, formerly a prosecutor, once tried to
investigate an accusation of abuse involving a U.S. priest who worked
at a children's home in western El Salvador.</TE>
<TE>   Although the victim has since retracted his accusation, Rivera
said she would have liked to conduct blood and semen tests to
determine whether the case had merit.</TE>
<TE>   The priest left El Salvador soon after the accusation surfaced in
2000, and Rivera couldn't issue a warrant for his arrest, nor demand
the tests, given the evidence she had.</TE>
<TE>   "The laws of our country," she said, "are simply too lax."</TE>

<HD>Rwanda, Congo Sign Peace Pact</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVAN MAHARAJ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PRETORIA, South Africa</DL>
<LD>Surrounded by Africa's top leaders, the presidents of Rwanda and
Congo signed a peace deal Tuesday to end one of the continent's most
brutal wars, a largely ignored conflict that has killed an estimated
2.5 million people in four years and involved the armies of seven
African nations.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a bright day for the African continent," declared an
ebullient South African President Thabo Mbeki, who brokered the deal.</LD>
<LD>   Mbeki and other African leaders were quick to trumpet the peace
agreement as the first sign that Africa was ready to end the
continent's legacy of bloodshed, poverty and bad government so that
it could attract billions of dollars in aid and corporate investment.</LD>
<TE>   Under the deal, the Congolese government agreed to round up,
disarm and return to Rwanda thousands of Hutu militiamen who helped
slaughter more than 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus during Rwanda's
1994 genocide. Rwanda will withdraw about 30,000 soldiers from
eastern Congo.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts called the deal a significant step toward ending the war
but warned that a 90-day deadline for the withdrawal of Rwandan
troops was too ambitious.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not logistically possible," said Henri Boshoff, a military
analyst with the Institute for Security Studies, a Pretoria-based
think tank. "Getting peacekeepers on the ground to monitor the
withdrawal is going to take at least 90 days."</TE>
<TE>   Mbeki, Congolese President Joseph Kabila and other African leaders
seemed unperturbed by the deadline. Instead, they said that Tuesday's
deal should be celebrated because it could clear the way for the
withdrawal of other armies, ending what has often been dubbed as
Africa's First World War.</TE>
<TE>   The war has been fought largely in the jungles of Central Africa,
and according to humanitarian aid groups, many of the victims have
died of disease and starvation.</TE>
<TE>   Fighting exploded four years ago when Rwanda and Uganda backed
rebels seeking to oust Kabila's father, then-President Laurent
Kabila. The two neighbors, which helped to install Laurent Kabila,
accused him of supporting rebels threatening their security.</TE>
<TE>   Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi supported various opposition groups in
eastern Congo while Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia dispatched thousands
of soldiers to back the government.</TE>
<TE>   Ending the Congo conflict has been a major goal of Mbeki, chairman
of the African Union, which this month replaced the weak Organization
of African Unity.</TE>
<TE>   At the union's launch in Durban, South Africa, Mbeki helped
persuade other African leaders to adopt an economic rescue plan that
commits member states to end their wars, promote democratic
governments and welcome private investors. States that don't comply
could be expelled.</TE>
<TE>   "In Africa, warlordism doesn't have a future," said Adama Gaye,
editor of London-based West Africa magazine. "Those who don't capture
the mood of change will be the losers."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said peace in Congo, the continent's third-largest
country, is key to stability in much of Africa because it shares
borders with nine nations. While foreign armies have been feasting on
Congo's vast deposits of gold, diamonds, copper and other minerals,
hundreds of thousands of refugees have fled to neighboring countries,
further straining their limited resources.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's deal could also enhance Mbeki's role as an African
peacemaker. That could help him as he urges Western governments to
increase their aid and investment in the continent, said Jakkie
Cilliers, who heads the Institute for Security Studies.</TE>
<TE>   Cilliers and other analysts say leaders of many African countries
have realized that they could reap sizable peace dividends if they
stop fighting. The World Bank, for example, has told Joseph Kabila
that it would lend his country $450 million if he agreed to a peace
deal.</TE>
<TE>   More money would flow if peace flourishes, and similar benefits
could be extended to other African nations embracing peace--hence
recent progress in peace talks in hot spots such as Angola, Burundi
and Sudan.</TE>
<TE>   In the continent's most widely followed peace talks, the Sudanese
government and the nation's main rebel group agreed this month to an
interim deal that could end a 19-year civil war in which 2 million
people have died, mainly from disease and starvation.</TE>
<TE>   The war that erupted in 1983 has pitted Sudan's Islamic government
in the Arabic-speaking north against rebels seeking more autonomy for
the largely animist and Christian south.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, speakers at the signing ceremony in Pretoria proudly
noted that many of the peace talks now underway on the continent were
African-led initiatives. However, they said the talks needed
international support to succeed.</TE>
<TE>   Rwandan President Paul Kagame called on the international
community to help his country and Congo implement the peace deal.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of these countries have historically been part of the
problem [so] they cannot escape the responsibility of being part of
the solution," Kagame said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the agreement, the United Nations mission in Congo, which
commands about 3,000 peacekeeping soldiers, would need 3,000 more to
monitor Rwanda's withdrawal.</TE>
<TE>   South Africa has pledged to contribute a battalion of 1,500
soldiers, according to Boshoff, but it is not clear who will provide
the rest.</TE>
<TE>   Pierre-Richard Prosper, the U.S. ambassador at large for war
crimes issues, made it clear that sending American peacekeepers was
not an option. Critics say the United States has shied away from
sending peacekeepers to Africa since 1993, when U.S. servicemen were
killed in Somalia. Prosper was speaking Tuesday in Kinshasa, the
Congolese capital, where he went to launch a U.S.-sponsored hunt for
Rwandans who helped plan the 1994 genocide.</TE>
<TE>   The peace deal and the departure of Rwandan soldiers could give
Kabila an opportunity to negotiate a power-sharing agreement with the
rebels, who control about one-third of the country. Kabila has
indicated that he is interested in forming a transitional government
before new elections are scheduled.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the success of the peace deal would depend on Kagame
and Kabila.</TE>
<TE>   Both men acknowledged Tuesday that the road to peace will be
difficult but said they were committed to taking the first step.</TE>
<TE>   "No more blood must run," Kabila said a few minutes before
exchanging firm handshakes with Kagame, "because Congo and Rwanda are
not at all interested in sacrificing the young people of the
countries on the battlefield."</TE>
<TE>   The Congolese people, Kabila said, want to "live in peace so
together they can face the challenges of illness, hunger and
poverty."</TE>
<TE>   "One conflict less for the continent means one further step to the
development the continent needs so much," he said.</TE>

<HD>Israel Calls Off Einstein Show in China</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>Israel has canceled an Albert Einstein exhibit in China after Chinese
officials demanded the removal of references to his being Jewish and
a supporter of creating a Jewish state, an Israeli spokesman said
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The incident adds to diplomatic strains that date back two years,
when Israel called off a deal to sell Beijing a sophisticated
airborne radar system. China has also criticized recent Israeli
attacks in Palestinian territories.</LD>
<LD>   The Einstein exhibit was to open in Beijing in late September and
travel to Shanghai, Guangzhou and other cities, according to the
Israeli Embassy in Beijing. It consists of 30 posters reproducing
photos, letters and documents about the physicist's life and work.</LD>
<TE>   "It was the Chinese Ministry of Culture's demand to omit or delete
parts of the exhibition that deal with the Jewish origins and
pro-Zionist attitude of Einstein and that he had been invited to be
the president of Israel," said Amir Sagie, an embassy spokesman.
"These three themes are very important to the biography of Einstein
and can't be changed."</TE>
<TE>   Zhang Ling, an official of the ministry's Foreign Cultural
Exchange Bureau, said it had no immediate comment.</TE>
<TE>   China has had diplomatic relations with Israel for a decade. Their
growing business ties include Israeli weapons sales to Beijing, but
China recently has been focused on building ties with Arab
governments.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli newspaper Yediot Aharonot said China was trying to
"de-Judaize Einstein." It said Beijing took the step "so as not to
spark Arab anger."</TE>
<TE>   Chinese-Israeli relations plunged in 2000 when Israel, under U.S.
pressure, canceled the sale to Beijing of a Phalcon radar system.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The United States is losing badly in the court of world opinion and
needs to revolutionize the way it communicates its policies and ideas
if it is to counter anti-Americanism and terrorism, says a report
released Tuesday by the Council on Foreign Relations.</LD>
<LD>   "There is little doubt that stereotypes of the United States as
arrogant, self-indulgent, hypocritical, inattentive, and unwilling or
unable to engage in cross-cultural dialogue are pervasive and deeply
rooted," concluded a high-powered panel of 35 business and media
leaders, scholars and former diplomats assembled by the nonprofit
foreign policy study group.</LD>
<LD>   The White House, which was briefed seven weeks earlier on the
contents, greeted the report with the announcement of a new Office of
Global Communications aimed at improving America's image abroad.</LD>
<TE>   President Bush believes "that America is such a force for good
around the world, yet we hear messages from other nations that they
don't see what the American people see in our country," White House
Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   The new office will be formed in the White House but will work
with the State Department's Office of Public Diplomacy, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   Its focus will go beyond the Middle East and Europe, where U.S.
policies on Israel and a perceived unilateral approach on foreign
policy have made America deeply unpopular, even among nations
considered the staunchest U.S. allies.</TE>
<TE>   Drawing on the model of the 24-hour communications "war room" the
United States used to brief world media during the military campaign
in Afghanistan, the new office will try to do a better job of
listening to public opinion in Asia, Latin America, Africa and
elsewhere and explaining U.S. policies, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The debate now developing in Washington is over whether the U.S.
can improve its image by being a better listener and communicator, or
whether America's policies and its position as the world's sole
superpower guarantee that it will remain unpopular no matter how well
it sells itself.</TE>
<TE>   The report by the council's Independent Task Force on Public
Diplomacy argues that "image problems" and foreign policy cannot be
separated during a war against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot always make others happy with our policy choices, nor
should we," the report says. "Part of our challenge is to better
explain why we do what we do, and then to accept that many will
differ. We may be able to offset some of the hostility, but not
eradicate it. This is part of being a great power. We should not
leave the impression that all differences are resolvable, or could be
if we would just be nicer or more empathetic."</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, former senior Bush advisor Karen Hughes
spearheaded the creation of the Coalition Information Centers,
24-hour press operations in Washington, London and Islamabad, the
Pakistani capital, staffed by veterans of American political
campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Officials are eager to make that assertive posture a permanent
part of U.S. diplomacy. Sources said Tucker Eskew, a former Bush
campaign aide who worked in the Coalition Information Centers, was
the leading candidate to head the new Office of Global
Communications.</TE>
<TE>   One of the goals of the new office is to overhaul State Department
policies that require officials in far-flung embassies to clear
speeches and statements with Washington in advance. The process can
take days.</TE>
<TE>   The American political establishment is well aware that "any
criticism that goes unanswered is considered true," said Sam
Stratman, spokesman for Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.).</TE>
<TE>   The House has already approved a bill by Hyde and Rep. Tom Lantos
(D-San Mateo) to spend an additional $255 million over two years to
reform the State Department's public diplomacy efforts, start
satellite TV broadcasting to the Middle East and beef up foreign
exchange programs.</TE>
<TE>   "The poisonous image of the U.S. that is deliberately propagated
around the world is more than a mere irritation," Hyde said in a
statement. "It has a direct and negative impact on American
interests."</TE>
<TE>   The task force report outlines the dimensions of America's public
relations problem, citing polls in the Middle East showing widespread
opposition to the war in Afghanistan, positive views of Osama bin
Laden and doubt that Arabs carried out the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. spends just $5 million a year on global public opinion
research--compared with the $10 million spent on polling by the
political campaign of New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, said task
force member David E. Morey, founder of DMG Inc., a corporate
strategy group. U.S. corporations spend $6 billion a year in overseas
research and $222 billion on foreign advertising, whereas the entire
U.S. budget for public diplomacy is $1 billion, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In Saudi Arabia, 50% of the population is under age 20, Morey
said. That's the target group for terrorist recruiting, but those
Saudi youth exposed to the Internet and global satellite TV are more
favorably inclined toward the U.S., he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't understand that young Muslim mind, we are betraying a
strategic interest of the U.S.," Morey said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet some task force members dissented from the notion that
image-making should be given equal priority with policymaking.</TE>
<TE>   "Equating America's standing with popularity, however obliquely,
makes me flinch," wrote China expert Bette Bao Lord.</TE>
<TE>   The consensus report recommends reforms that include making sure
that U.S. policymakers anticipate likely foreign reaction to their
moves; spotlighting the core American values that have resonance
elsewhere; and enlisting as messengers credible private citizens,
including Arab Americans, Muslim victims of the Sept. 11 attacks, and
Muslim and Arab business and scientific leaders, sports figures and
celebrities.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can get Muhammad Ali, we should," said Peter G. Peterson,
chairman of investment firm Blackstone Group.</TE>

<HD>Congress Calling for Clarity on Iraq</HD>
<DH>Policy: Senate hearing comes after months of leaks on how
the U.S. aims to oust Hussein. The conflicting scenarios have drawn
criticism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The war will involve 250,000 troops, or it could be just 70,000. They
might attack Iraq from three sides, or they could largely finish the
job with an assault on Baghdad.</LD>
<LD>   Since President Bush announced months ago a determined but
still-unformed plan to topple Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, such
diverse and contradictory reports have been filling an information
vacuum and shaping public discussion.</LD>
<LD>   Foreign policy experts say it is unprecedented for the U.S.
government to air such vague and open-ended plans for war, and they
predict that the leaks will remain central to the public discussion
until the administration decides how to deal with Hussein and begins
to talk more openly about it.</LD>
<TE>   Now Congress, which has been largely on the sidelines, is looking
for answers too.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee opens hearings to
raise such questions as the rationale and risks of a war, and how
long the United States would need to remain as a steward for Iraq
afterward. Committee Chairman Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), who
has been pushing the administration to better "define its objectives"
in Iraq, said Tuesday that he knew of no place "where there has been
... a thorough discussion of all these issues."</TE>
<TE>   Another influential senator cautioned that it was precisely this
kind of national debate that was missing as the United States began
to deepen its involvement in Vietnam decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   Questions about the administration's plans for Iraq have been
increasingly urgent since Bush began signaling his determination to
force a "regime change" in Iraq in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Although he has insisted that he has approved no war plan, he has
laid the groundwork for military action in several speeches. He has
said the United States would be justified in "preempting" dangerous
regimes that threaten it with chemical, biological and nuclear
weapons. Bush has also approved covert action against Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Polls have repeatedly indicated that Congress and the public
support a new war on Iraq, at least as a general proposition. And in
Washington political circles, many people are convinced that Bush is
fully committed to a war, next year if not sooner.</TE>
<TE>   Yet as the months have passed, the administration has remained
internally divided. Some officials want to move faster than others,
or use more ground forces, or rely more heavily on Iraqi opposition
groups.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials have denounced insiders who are secretly
releasing information to influence policy, and have called on the FBI
to try to track them down.</TE>
<TE>   "It's become a leak-driven debate," said Derek Chollet, a State
Department official in the Clinton administration. "Every one that
comes out kicks up new dust."</TE>
<TE>   As the debate has continued, officials have insisted that there is
nothing more they can say about their plans, because none have been
made final.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know if the United States [will] exercise a military
option with respect to Iraq," Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld
told reporters Tuesday. He insisted that the administration has
several possible approaches to removing Hussein, including
"diplomatic, economic and military" means.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Rumsfeld seemed to reiterate the
administration's desire for more aggressive action by insisting that
Iraq is unlikely to agree to the kind of United Nations inspections
that would uncover weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. allies are calling on the U.N. to exhaust efforts at weapons
inspections before any military action would be undertaken. Rumsfeld
was suggesting that would be a waste of time.</TE>
<TE>   "It's difficult to comprehend--even to begin to think--that they
would accept such [an inspection] regime," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Another U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
recently that he believed the leaked war-planning documents that have
appeared in news reports have come from middle- or upper-middle-level
officials, some of whom were in remote government planning offices.
But he said none of the proposals had gotten so far as to receive a
vote from top-level officials.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the varying numbers of U.S. troops and attack
strategies championed by different camps in the Pentagon, State
Department and intelligence communities, the leaks have reflected
policy disagreements within the administration on even whether
attacking Hussein is preferable to trying to contain him.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers and experts have increasingly urged that these issues be
discussed in public.</TE>
<TE>   Lee Hamilton, former chairman of the House International Relations
Committee, said that "given the magnitude and the importance of the
task of trying to change the Iraqi leadership, there's been
remarkably little debate on it."</TE>
<TE>   That sentiment is increasingly shared by lawmakers of both
parties, some of whom have been actively urging the administration to
be more forthcoming on its intentions.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Charles Hagel (R-Neb.) has urged a national debate on the
issue, noting that there was no such debate about Vietnam in the
early 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say there are risks for the administration if Americans
don't fully understand what would be involved in a military campaign,
especially one that risked widespread use of chemical or biological
weapons against U.S. troops.</TE>
<TE>   If Americans discover that a war against Iraq is bloodier or more
expensive than they expected, or requires a longer U.S. presence in
Iraq, there could be a public backlash, the experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Experts note, too, that the months of leaks will only make it
harder for the administration to decide what to do, and then to sell
the policy it has chosen to Americans and allied countries.</TE>
<TE>   "Foreign policy by leak is never a good idea: You can't control
the message, and your policy looks like it's in disarray," said
Chollet, the former State Department official.</TE>
<TE>   He predicted that it will be increasingly difficult for the
administration to remain silent on its intentions as lawmakers and
others in Washington debate the issues.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the administration is going to be forced to say more," he
said. "Otherwise they're going to be letting others shape the
debate."</TE>

<HD>Suicide Blast Injures 5; Brothers Slain in Palestinian
Village</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J. MICHAEL KENNEDY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>A 17-year-old suicide bomber evaded tight Israeli security and came
within a few blocks of Jerusalem's crowded downtown business district
Tuesday before blowing himself up and injuring five people standing
near a falafel stand.</LD>
<LD>   Adding to Israelis' uncertainty, two brothers who lived in a
Jewish settlement near the West Bank city of Nablus were gunned down
while doing business in a nearby Palestinian village. The head of
Israel's security service also testified that an estimated 60 attacks
are being planned by Palestinian militants against the Jewish state.</LD>
<LD>   Taken together, the day's events were sure to add to the angst
among Israelis, who have grown both wary and weary of Palestinian
attacks, particularly suicide bombings.</LD>
<TE>   Tuesday's bombing was the first such attack since July 17, when
two suicide bombers blew themselves up in Tel Aviv, killing five
people. That attack came nearly a month after 19 people riding a
packed commuter bus were killed in Jerusalem. The June 18 incident
caused the Israeli army to reoccupy seven of the eight major
Palestinian cities, turning residents into virtual prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   The latest bombing also served notice that the intense security
network in Jerusalem remains far from foolproof. The bomber, who
lived in the Palestinian village of Beit Jala just a few miles away,
might have continued walking downtown were it not for the fact that
he passed the Yemenite Falafel Center on busy Haneviim Street. The
stand is a popular spot for police officers taking a break. One
policeman, Sgt. Ofir Yona, said he made eye contact with the bomber,
identified as Majed Atta, as he was walking past the stand.</TE>
<TE>   "He definitely spotted us," Yona said. "Definitely."</TE>
<TE>   The bomb detonated almost immediately, and there was some
speculation by police that it might have gone off prematurely. Five
people near the stand, located on the edge of an ultra-Orthodox
neighborhood, were injured.</TE>
<TE>   Yona said the bomber did nothing to cause suspicion, was dressed
neatly and did not seem nervous. Police said Atta was a member of the
Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a militia affiliated with the Fatah movement
of Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli brothers were shot and killed while selling diesel
fuel to a cement factory in a Palestinian village. According to
witnesses, Shlomo Odesar, 60, and his brother Mordechai, 52, were
ambushed by hooded gunmen. The attack occurred so quickly that the
brothers, who were armed with a semiautomatic weapon, did not have
time to respond.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers were engaged in business in the Palestinian village
despite the deep animosity between residents of Tappuah, the
settlement where they lived, and their Palestinian neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, a couple living in Itamar, another Jewish settlement in
the West Bank, were slightly wounded by a Palestinian who broke into
their home and stabbed them. The intruder was killed by security
forces.</TE>
<TE>   The events of the last several days have led to more accusations
that Arafat is unable to control his people.</TE>
<TE>   The testimony of General Security Service director Avi Dichter
only added to the sense of gloom. Testifying before Ramon's
committee, Dichter warned of an impending wave of bombing attacks. He
said the internal security agency was aware of an estimated 60 bomb
plots, not counting 12 that were foiled last week.</TE>

<HD>Pope Names Central American Saint</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GUATEMALA CITY</DL>
<LD>Pope John Paul II canonized Central America's first saint, a 17th
century Spanish missionary, in an outdoor ceremony Tuesday witnessed
by half a million faithful, capping a visit to help heal Guatemala's
rifts and stem losses to a powerful evangelical Protestant movement.</LD>
<LD>   Visibly struggling against fatigue, arthritis and the effects of
Parkinson's disease, the pontiff canonized Pedro de San Jose Betancur
in a three-hour ceremony conducted on an altar built on an abandoned
racetrack and bedecked with thousands of white roses.</LD>
<LD>   "I do it convinced of the relevance of his example, a man who
crossed the Atlantic to help the poor, the indigenous people of
America, his only baggage his faith in God," the pope said in a
homily that was often slurred or inaudible. The new saint, known here
as Hermano Pedro, or Brother Pedro, is the 463rd the pope has named
since his papacy began in 1978.</LD>
<TE>   John Paul arrived in Mexico City late Tuesday, the last stop on an
11-day North American tour, to add another name to the list of
saints: Juan Diego, a Mexican Indian to whom, according to legend,
the Virgin of Guadalupe appeared in 1531.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican President Vicente Fox and 32 children in traditional
clothing, one from each of the nation's states, greeted the pope at
the airport. Thousands of Mexicans pointed flashlights into the sky
to welcome John Paul's plane as it approached the capital, and
hundreds of thousands lined his 25-mile motorcade route.</TE>
<TE>   The ceremony in Guatemala City, framed by a powder-blue sky and
volcanoes swathed in clouds, was intentionally conducted on a massive
scale.</TE>
<TE>   Protestantism has made deep inroads in Guatemala over the last
several decades, broadcasting on 100 radio and two television
stations and employing legions of missionaries--including many from
evangelical churches in California. As much as 30% of Guatemala's
population has been converted, the highest percentage of
non-Catholics in Latin America, according to Harvard University
professor Rachel McCleary.</TE>
<TE>   The other subtext of the pope's visit was lingering antagonism
between the church and the Guatemalan government. The 1998 killing of
Bishop Juan Jose Gerardi after the release of a study he led on human
rights abuses is still considered by many Catholics to be unsolved
despite the convictions of a priest, a former presidential bodyguard,
a retired army officer and his son. Many Guatemalans believe that
those who planned the attack have not been brought to justice.</TE>
<TE>   Underscoring the tensions, Archbishop Rodolfo Quezada Toruno
invoked Gerardi's name during his remarks welcoming the pope,
describing the bishop as a martyr whose example should not be
forgotten.</TE>
<TE>   Although a 1996 peace accord ended 35 years of guerrilla warfare
in Guatemala, the number of human rights abuses in the nation is
rising again, according to University of Illinois professor Bruce
Calder. The Catholic clergy is receiving an increasing number of
threats both for mediating current conflicts and for its effort to
catalog past abuses.</TE>
<TE>   But social and political upheaval were far from the minds of many
of those who came to Tuesday's ceremony, an event attended by
President Alfonso Portillo as well as heads of Central American
nations El Salvador, Panama, Nicaragua and Honduras.</TE>
<TE>   Portillo announced that, in response to a request from the pope,
he was temporarily halting executions and that he would submit a bill
to Guatemala's Congress to abolish the death penalty. A similar
request by the pope during his first visit to Guatemala, in 1983, was
ignored by then-dictator Efrain Rios Montt.</TE>
<TE>   The pope's feeble state on this, his third visit to Guatemala, did
not lessen the fervor of pilgrims.</TE>
<TE>   "The pope is near to God, and he transmitted that to us, to the
hearts of everyone in Guatemala City," Isabel Bolanos, a Guatemala
City housewife, said as she left the outdoor Mass. "We will have lots
of blessings now because of his visit."</TE>
<TE>   Brother Pedro was a Franciscan monk who came to Guatemala from his
native Canary Islands in Spain. He dedicated his life to serving the
infirm, the poor and the abandoned. Unlike Juan Diego, whose
existence many scholars doubt, historical and archival evidence
remains of the new saint.</TE>
<TE>   Parts of the colonial capital city of Antigua, where Brother Pedro
lived and died, are testimony to his works. The hospital and hospice
compound he founded for the sick and abandoned is going strong three
centuries later. It has 800 patients, the most recent a 7-month-old
foundling left Sunday on the hospice chapel's doorstep.</TE>
<TE>   Harvard's McCleary said Protestant evangelicals have seized the
initiative in Guatemala. Some indigenous communities, which make up
half of Guatemala's population, became disillusioned with the
Catholic Church during the civil war because it was silent or
ineffective in stopping the violence, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "The pope is trying to regain Catholics by bestowing sainthood on
local people," McCleary said. John Paul's three-day visit to Mexico,
where Protestant faiths are also gaining ground among Indians and
other Catholics, has the same aim. Today he is to make Juan Diego the
Americas' first indigenous saint, and Thursday he will beatify two
Catholic Indian martyrs of 1700, placing them a step from sainthood.</TE>
<TE>   The pope, visibly weary after his flight, used a hydraulic lift to
descend from the plane and was wheeled on a platform to greet 3,000
well-wishers packed into an airport hangar. They threw confetti and
sang songs celebrating his four previous visits to the overwhelmingly
Catholic country.</TE>
<TE>   In a brief arrival speech, John Paul urged Mexicans to remain true
to Catholicism and repeated the slogan of his previous pilgrimages
here: "Mexico ever faithful."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Richard Boudreaux in Mexico City contributed to
this report.</TE>

<HD>Powell Meets With N. Korea Official at Asian Summit</HD>
<DH>Security: The encounter comes after ASEAN OKs terms of
anti-terrorism pact with U.S. The bloc also agrees to mutually fight
'global threat.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei</DL>
<LD>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell held a 15-minute "informal chat"
with North Korean Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun today at the
beginning of a regional Asian summit in Brunei--the highest-level
contact to date between North Korea and the Bush administration.</LD>
<LD>   In his State of the Union address this year, President Bush
labeled North Korea one of three members of an "axis of evil" and
still regularly lambastes the isolationist regime of Kim Jong Il.</LD>
<LD>   But in a statement announcing the brief talks, State Department
spokesman Richard Boucher said Powell had noted various statements by
North Korea over the last week regretting a deadly naval battle with
South Korea and announcing that it was ready for renewed talks with
Washington. North Korea, the world's most rigidly Marxist regime,
even suggested Tuesday that it would introduce market mechanisms in
its economy.</LD>
<TE>   Powell "reaffirmed the president's policy," which stipulated that
future formal discussions should deal with the production and sales
of North Korea's weapons of mass destruction, the status of the
"agreed framework" to curb the Pyongyang regime's nuclear weapons,
and withdrawal of conventional forces from along the border with
South Korea, Boucher said.</TE>
<TE>   The agreed framework was negotiated in 1994 and provides to North
Korea, with help from Japan and South Korea, two well-regulated
light-water nuclear reactors for energy. But the program has faced
multiple problems and is several years behind schedule.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting in this tiny oil-rich sultanate in a corner of Borneo
was a delicately orchestrated "spontaneous" encounter at a lounge
outside the hall where the plenary session of the Assn. of Southeast
Asian Nations Regional Forum was taking place, according to U.S.
officials.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, as the North Korean foreign minister entered a
breakfast meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, Paek
had said he was "always ready" to meet with Powell. "If they propose
first, I will meet them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of hours later, at 9:25 a.m., Powell entered the
delegates lounge and requested that the North Korean minister be
informed that he was there. Paek arrived shortly and they shook
hands, the officials said. Then they sat down at a table and talked.</TE>
<TE>   The last contact was in October 2000, when then-Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright became the highest-level U.S. official to visit
Pyongyang since the Korean War half a century ago. The Clinton
administration was close to negotiating an end to the production and
sale of North Korea's ballistic missiles, but a deal was never
concluded because of differences over verification and monitoring.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration opted not to pick up on the initiative and
instead said it would not talk with the "rogue" regime unless the
issue of conventional forces deployed along the border with South
Korea were included on the agenda--a subject North Korea has balked
at discussing.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials traveling with Powell said today that any follow-up
meetings with Paek or future travel to North Korea would be evaluated
on the basis of statements made by the North.</TE>
<TE>   Powell scored another breakthrough Tuesday in his effort to beef
up counter-terrorism cooperation in Southeast Asia, a region that has
become known as the "second front" in the war on terrorism. Under
U.S. coaxing, the 10 ASEAN nations agreed to the terms of two new
pacts to deal with the growing problems of Islamic extremism and
other militant movements.</TE>
<TE>   In Brunei, Powell will also hold talks with ASEAN members and sign
one of the two agreements, to share intelligence, freeze funds linked
to extremist groups and tighten porous borders.</TE>
<TE>   The pact reflects the Bush administration's growing involvement in
the region, where Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Singapore
have all identified suspects linked to the Al Qaeda terrorist
network.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens have been arrested since Sept. 11. Some active plots to
attack Western targets have been uncovered.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement coincides with new U.S. plans to provide additional
military and counter-terrorism training for Indonesia and the
Philippines, which are dealing with insurgencies by Muslim
extremists. After Brunei, Powell is to visit those nations.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration is eager to end a congressional ban on new
military aid to Indonesia aimed at forcing the country to account for
serious rights abuses.</TE>
<TE>   "We have some ideas and some initiatives that we will present to
them that I think will help them in their efforts in the campaign
against terrorism," Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   In the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, earlier Tuesday, Powell
held talks with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and other officials
about the possibility of Malaysia's becoming the headquarters for
regional counter-terrorism training.</TE>
<TE>   The heightened U.S. role has not been welcomed by all in the
region. The pact with ASEAN had been heatedly debated at the group's
annual summit, which ended here Tuesday. Indonesia and Vietnam
expressed concern about U.S. intentions in the region, including the
potential for major new American troop deployments.</TE>
<TE>   Powell hailed Tuesday's agreement as "a good pact." At a stop in
Singapore, he also pledged that U.S. troops would go only where
invited and deploy in a way sensitive to local history, culture,
tradition and political systems.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the way we go about these missions--try not to be
heavy-handed, try to go to help," he said at a joint news conference
with Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S.-ASEAN agreement, scheduled to be signed Thursday, calls
for creation of "a framework for cooperation to prevent, disrupt and
combat international terrorism" through the exchange of information
and intelligence. It is expected to lead to increased U.S. technical
aid and financial assistance to ASEAN nations.</TE>
<TE>   The 10 members of ASEAN--Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos,
Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam--also agreed to a new counter-terrorism pact among
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "We recognized that terrorism is a global threat and that the
disturbing acts of terrorism and transnational crimes, which continue
to threaten world peace and stability, must be tackled by the
international community," a joint ASEAN statement said.</TE>

<HD>Companies Seen as Aiding Illegal Tobacco Business</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>Illegal sales and smuggling of a powerfully addictive narcotic earn
billions for criminal syndicates, corrupt police and customs
agencies, and claim thousands of lives every year.</LD>
<LD>   In a new campaign to combat this trade, the United Nations and the
U.S. government convened a conference of law enforcement experts from
around the world this week, from New York City's police commissioner
to a former Colombian Cabinet minister who is an expert on the
lucrative contraband market.</LD>
<LD>   The drug is not cocaine or heroin, but tobacco--a far bigger
business.</LD>
<TE>   The world's biggest tobacco companies are witting accomplices in
the illicit trade, producing and distributing huge quantities of
cigarettes destined for the global black market, conference speakers
charged.</TE>
<TE>   About a quarter of the cigarettes exported around the world are
ultimately sold to consumers outside the legal and fiscal control of
any government, depriving national treasuries of more than $20
billion yearly in lost tax revenue, according to U.N. and World Bank
estimates. In the United States, the Treasury estimates, cigarette
smuggling costs the federal and state governments $1.4 billion in
lost revenue every year.</TE>
<TE>   The illegal proceeds from this business help finance international
arms rings and prostitution rackets--and, increasingly, armed
insurgents and terrorist organizations, according to police and
prosecutors from the 145 countries participating in the U.N.
conference. And drug gangs sometimes launder cash from cocaine and
heroin sales by buying black market cigarettes, according to Latin
American and East European experts.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a great deal of money to be made in cigarette
smuggling," said Raymond W. Kelly, New York City's police
commissioner and a former chief of the U.S. Customs Service.</TE>
<TE>   And in a world of increasingly freer trade, Kelly added,
"international boundaries do not provide the safeguards against
smuggling that they may have in the past, and organized crime is
poised to take advantage of the eagerness of nations to break down
the barriers that separate us.</TE>
<TE>   "Smuggled cigarettes typically lack health warning labels and are
often sold to children in contravention of national laws," according
to the World Health Organization, one of the conference's sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   "Tobacco smuggling undermines national pricing policies, deprives
governments of revenues used to combat smoking, permits tobacco
companies to subvert and undermine international cooperation in
tobacco control and, above all, undermines legal restrictions and
health regulations such as those that deal with health warnings and
sales to minors," said Derek Yach, executive director of WHO's
noncommunicable diseases division.</TE>
<TE>   The world's leading tobacco companies produce cigarettes for what
is known in the industry as the DNP market: the "duty not paid"
business that includes thousands of legitimate customs-free shops at
airports and border posts around the world. But most of the
cigarettes exported free of duty from the United States and other big
tobacco-producing countries end up smuggled across international
borders, law enforcement and economic analysts at the conference
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Container-loads of billions of cigarettes just disappear from
official view and end up in the black market," said Joy de Beyer, the
World Bank's top expert on tobacco trade.</TE>
<TE>   The motivation for tobacco companies to encourage this clandestine
trade, De Beyer and other speakers asserted, is to expand their
markets into countries where cigarette imports are banned or
prohibitively taxed.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are banned, one way of getting your brand known at an
early stage is to smuggle it in," De Beyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of major tobacco companies, who were invited to
attend the conference, dispute the assertion that they knowingly
supply the contraband trade. An international organization of
duty-free airport shops also took issue with the accusation,
contending that shipments of untaxed cigarettes are carefully
documented by suppliers, retailers and monitoring governments.</TE>
<TE>   Most conference delegates vigorously dispute those claims,
however. Among them are officials from the European Union and
Colombia, which have jointly filed a lawsuit in U.S. courts against
Philip Morris, accusing the tobacco giant of coordinating the
smuggling of American-made cigarettes through Europe and northern
South America.</TE>
<TE>   Bradley Buckles, director of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms, noted Tuesday that a subsidiary of another "major U.S.
tobacco company"--RJ Reynolds, though he didn't name the firm--was
convicted on charges stemming from its knowing participation in
cigarette smuggling to Canada.</TE>
<TE>   The three-day meeting is the first international conference
devoted to the illicit tobacco trade. Organized jointly by WHO and
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, it is intended to lay
the groundwork for the anti-smuggling provisions of a proposed treaty
regulating the global tobacco trade.</TE>

<HD>On Their Own and Uninsured</HD>
<DH>Health: Individuals find coverage is harder to get, while
rising costs put a strain on policyholders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON LEE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At a time when the soft economy has forced many more people to buy
health insurance on their own, insurers are imposing steep premium
increases on individual policyholders and are making it harder for
new applicants to qualify for coverage, according to insurance
brokers and consumers.</LD>
<LD>   The number of uninsured nationally is rising, by an estimated 2
million in the last two years, and the rising premiums are putting
increasing financial strain on consumers.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, California's so-called high-risk pool, the
publicly funded insurance of last resort, has come under sharp budget
cuts and has a waiting list of eight to 18 months for new enrollees,
so many people who desperately need medical insurance have nowhere to
turn. Applications to the high-risk pool have increased 40% in the
last 12 months.</LD>
<TE>   "Never has it been as difficult to get qualified as now," said
Jeff Miles, who has been selling individual health insurance for more
than two decades and is president-elect of the California Assn. of
Health Underwriters. "If they have virtually anything wrong with
their health, seemingly minor things, that will prevent them from
getting approval," said Miles, whose business is in Marina del Rey.</TE>
<TE>   Jackie Lee, a single mom who recently was laid off from a
networking company in Silicon Valley, was denied by two insurers. She
said she had not yet received an explanation from Health Net. But
Blue Cross, after examining her health history, cited the following
reasons in a letter: She had received treatment for back pain and
medication for allergies (Zyrtec) and high cholesterol (Lescol).</TE>
<TE>   "I was pretty shocked when they rejected me," said Lee, 39.
"Everybody takes allergy medicine. And the cholesterol, it's like a
preventative thing," she said, adding that her lower-back pain also
is manageable.</TE>
<TE>   For privacy reasons, Blue Cross won't comment about specific
cases. But officials said they have not made substantial changes in
underwriting individual policies in recent years. Some other major
carriers said the same thing. But none of them would release denial
rates or specific underwriting guidelines, citing competitive
concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Many brokers and agents, however, interview customers and screen
applications before submitting them, a practice known as field
underwriting. And what they see are some clear patterns: Insurers now
will not write policies if an individual has taken certain expensive
prescription drugs, has more than one chronic condition--even if mild
and controllable--or shows signs of needing mental health services.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question they've toughened up," said David Fear, a
senior manager at the Rancho Cordova office of California Insurance
Marketing Services, which works with thousands of agents throughout
the state. "They're cherry- picking whom they want."</TE>
<TE>   About 16 million Americans are covered by individual insurance,
many of them self-employed, independent contractors and part-time
workers. The federal government says about 39 million people were
without health insurance in 2000, and insurance policy experts
estimate that the number rose last year to 41 million.</TE>
<TE>   Many of them would love to have individual policies. But the costs
and difficulty of getting coverage hold them back.</TE>
<TE>   To help people buy health insurance, the Bush administration and
the U.S. Senate have offered proposals for health insurance tax
credits, from $1,000 for individuals to as much as $3,000 for
families.</TE>
<TE>   That still would not be nearly enough for many people, especially
sicker and older individuals, according to research by the Center for
Studying Health System Change, a nonpartisan policy group in
Washington. Nationally, the center said, individual health premiums
will average $214 a month this year.</TE>
<TE>   In many states, including California, individual health insurance
premiums are not regulated. Insurers in the past adjusted rates once
a year, based on where policyholders live and their age group,
usually in five-year age bands.</TE>
<TE>   But recently, rates have risen more frequently, and the combined
increases, for older people in particular, have been huge.</TE>
<TE>   Gail Prodor, a 61-year-old widow in San Diego, has seen her
carrier, Blue Shield of California, raise her rates six times since
April 2000. The latest was a 19% increase that boosted her monthly
premium to $582--about double what it was two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   To cope, Prodor has cut back on expenses. But that's still not
enough, she said, so she is looking for a part-time job. Prodor
described her health as good. She has four years to go before she can
qualify for Medicare.</TE>
<TE>   "All I keep thinking is: When is it going to stop? Can I afford
this?" she said of her health premiums. "But I can't go without
insurance."</TE>
<TE>   Blue Shield said the overall average increase in April for
individuals was less than 10%. But it was the second increase in nine
months, and some policyholders, such as Prodor, also got midyear
premium adjustments when they hit a certain age.</TE>
<TE>   "We're doing our best, but we have escalating costs," said Lisa
Rubino, a senior vice president in charge of Blue Shield's individual
market.</TE>
<TE>   As to the frequency of rate increases, Rubino said Blue Shield was
following competitors. Blue Cross of California raised premiums in
February and has another rate increase coming in August. Health Net
too is in a twice-a-year mode. Among major carriers in this market,
only Kaiser Permanente has stuck to an annual increase.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is to price products as low as we can and make sure
premiums cover anticipated risks going forward," said Alan Katz, Blue
Cross of California's head of sales for individual and small-group
policies.</TE>
<TE>   Katz said the overall average increase in August was in the low
double digits, on top of a 5% to 10% boost in February. Blue Cross'
parent company, WellPoint Health Networks, last week reported a 71%
increase in profit. In a letter prepared for consumers questioning
their premium increases, WellPoint said its overall earnings have
grown because of strong membership gains across all products.</TE>
<TE>   Interviews and company filings show that total enrollment of
individual policyholders in California has shown little, if any,
growth in the last couple of years.</TE>
<TE>   "If I need insurance today, there's a good possibility that I
can't get it. And if I can get it, I might not be able to afford it,"
said Deborah Chollet, a senior fellow at Mathematica Policy Research
in Washington, who has written extensively in this area.</TE>
<TE>   Insurance executives say there are plenty of affordable individual
coverage options, including low-cost plans with deductibles as high
as $7,500. They point out that rates are going up for everybody, not
just individual policyholders, reflecting spiraling costs for
hospital services and prescription drugs.</TE>
<TE>   About two-thirds of Americans obtain health insurance through
their employers, and their out-of-pocket costs are going up too. But
employers still pick up much of the tab. Employees and dependents in
group policies also are typically guaranteed coverage by law,
regardless of their health status. Large employers use their size and
clout to get better rates. And many states, including California,
regulate premiums that health insurers can charge small employers.</TE>
<TE>   Few individual policyholders enjoy those benefits or protections.
Regulators in California do not review and approve premiums for this
market or the underwriting practices.</TE>
<TE>   When the economy was strong and hiring brisk, that didn't matter
as much. Many more people were getting coverage through employers or
could afford private insurance. That's not so anymore. In the last 12
months, the number of unemployed in California has jumped by more
than 200,000. Moreover, surging health-care costs have prompted some
small employers to drop health benefits for employees or dependents.</TE>
<TE>   Some states have pushed through new regulations, including a
requirement in Colorado that insurers accept self-employed people
regardless of preexisting conditions.</TE>
<TE>   But lawmakers and regulators in many other states, worried about
an exodus of insurance carriers, generally have been reluctant to
compel insurers to provide better access and prices for consumers in
this market, said Steven B. Larsen, insurance commissioner for
Maryland, which does regulate premiums for individual policies.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a little skeptical of the argument that everybody's going to
pack up and leave," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts by California lawmakers in recent years to pass broad
reform of individual health insurance have failed. A bill by
Assemblywoman Helen Thomson (D-Davis), AB 1401, would offer more
limited help to those denied by insurers, including extending COBRA
benefits, which continue employer-based coverage for departing
workers, to 36 months from 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   For insurance companies, writing individual health policies is
more risky than most other lines of business. Administration and
marketing costs are higher, in part because many individuals cancel
after just a short time. Insurers also must prevent so-called adverse
selection, in which healthy individuals drop out and leave behind a
rising pool of sick people.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say that given the inherent risks heightened by the
turbulent health-care market today, it's not surprising that issuers
would be more aggressive about pricing and underwriting. But even
experienced brokers have been alarmed by the extent of the premium
hikes and cherry-picking.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Au, a former Blue Cross employee who has been an independent
agent for two decades in the San Gabriel Valley, says she is
struggling to explain the rate hikes to her customers.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people are buying higher and higher deductible plans or
dropping out altogether," she said. "I don't see the light in the
tunnel."</TE>
<TE>   Melissa Hernandez, 34, bought insurance from Blue Cross in
mid-January after she was laid off last year from a graphics design
firm in Burbank. But just seven months later, she got her first
renewal--a 23% jump in premium, to $160 a month.</TE>
<TE>   "Initially it doesn't seem like a lot," she said. "But I'm really
concerned because I was unemployed for six months.... Every little
bit counts."</TE>

<HD>Chokehold by Inglewood Officer Hospitalized Earlier Suspect</HD>
<DH>Police: The man was in intensive care for three days after
recent encounter with Jeremy Morse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two weeks before slamming a handcuffed teen onto the hood of a police
cruiser, Inglewood Police Officer Jeremy J. Morse was directly
involved in a violent, near-deadly altercation--hitting a 32-year-old
man with a baton and then helping apply a chokehold that knocked him
out.</LD>
<LD>   Morse's participation in the beating of Neilson Williams, which
has received far less notice than the minutely scrutinized Donovan
Jackson arrest of July 6, is detailed in a police report obtained by
The Times and in interviews with Williams and a witness who claims to
have seen much of what happened.</LD>
<LD>   Medical records show that Williams spent three days in intensive
care after the June 23 encounter. He suffered severe respiratory
injuries, apparently caused by the chokehold.</LD>
<TE>   In the police report, Morse says the use of force was justified
because Williams was drunk and resisted handcuffing. "We felt in fear
for our safety and believed he was preparing himself to physically
attack us," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, whose family filed a complaint with the Police
Department as he lay in the hospital, denies the accusations. He was
not arrested, although police now say they have issued a warrant on
charges of resisting officers and battery.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Williams filed a $75-million claim against the city of
Inglewood, accusing Morse of abuse. Inglewood officials have refused
to comment and have officially sealed the incident report, citing
ongoing investigations by their internal affairs wing and the
district attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Morse's lawyer characterizes Williams' legal claim as a "nothing
case" spurred by opportunism. The officer himself has been advised
not to talk. Williams, who initially spoke freely to a reporter for
this story, has also stopped talking on the advice of his legal team.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the Jackson case, in which a video recording led
prosecutors to charge Morse with assault and another officer with
fabricating his incident report, all that exists in the Williams
beating are disparate narratives: one told in Morse's report, another
by Williams, still another by what may be the only witness not
involved in the altercation, a teenager who corroborates parts of
Williams' story.</TE>
<TE>   What is known for certain is that Williams, who had been drinking,
encountered Morse and another police officer after he left a barbecue
at Inglewood's Ashwood Park late in the evening on June 23. A short
time later, he was in the hospital, legally intoxicated, bruised,
bloody and fighting to live. "I thought he was going to die," said a
medical worker at the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Since spending three days in intensive care at Centinela Hospital
in Inglewood, Williams, who stands near 6 feet 4 and weights about
250 pounds, has spent most of his days shuttling between his mother's
Inglewood home and doctors' and psychologists' offices.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As Williams recalled that day, he spoke of a bright, lazy Sunday
afternoon. He and a group of about 20 spent most of the day at
Ashwood Park, a small pie-slice stretch of grass and pavement that
bumps up against the San Diego Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Ashwood is usually filled with a mix of Latino and black families
and kids. Gang members, Bloods mostly, go there on
occasion--drinking, talking big, shooting hoops and sometimes smoking
marijuana. In this tough, working-class neighborhood they are merely
part of the fabric, not necessarily welcomed, not particularly
shunned.</TE>
<TE>   Williams and his group, a mix of teens and adults, spent most of
the day grilling chicken, ribs and steaks, he said. Hip-hop blared
from boomboxes, some people played dominoes, some dashed up and down
the basketball court.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, who grew up in the neighborhood, was dressed in black
khakis and a white shirt, and though he disputed the notion that he
was drunk, he admitted that he nursed a few beers through the
afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   By around 10:30 p.m. the party was over. Williams said he and
another man whose name he does not know began cleaning up trash, then
left the park shortly thereafter. They walked through a small entry
to the park, near two tennis courts.</TE>
<TE>   Williams was pleased with how the day had gone. He'd had a chance
to impart some of his hard-earned street knowledge to a crew of young
kids.</TE>
<TE>   Known in Inglewood by his street name "Be Upon," Williams is a
onetime street tough who says he turned his life around as a teenager
in the late 1980s after a series of run-ins with police that included
a drug-possession conviction.</TE>
<TE>   Morse said in the report that he recognized Williams as a gang
member. There are no indications in court records that Williams has
had any legal trouble in the last 12 years.</TE>
<TE>   Those who know him say that over the last decade, Williams has
become a much-respected force in the neighborhood by working to stop
gang violence, organizing turkey giveaways for Thanksgiving, fighting
to keep kids in school and helping produce the music of home-grown
rap artists.</TE>
<TE>   Williams is known as a "peacemaker," a man who can ease tension
between Crips and Bloods and Latinos and blacks, said Bo Taylor, one
of the authors of the landmark gang truces that sprang up in Los
Angeles after the 1992 riots.</TE>
<TE>   Civil rights attorney Constance Rice said she has been in meetings
with Williams and gang members who were trying to sort out
differences and live peacefully.</TE>
<TE>   "His thing is, he's trying to turn around young minds," Rice said.
She said Williams is known to be part of a small, eclectic group of
people working to reduce urban violence--a mixture of Bloods, Crips
and other gang members assisted by the likes of football great Jim
Brown, actor Harry Belafonte and others.</TE>
<TE>   Rice and Taylor each speculated that police that night mistook
Williams for an active gang member, since he hangs out among gangs
for his work.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Morse, in his police report, indicated there was no mistake.
Police were clear about what they came upon as they arrived at
Ashwood Park that evening responding to a call for backup. A suspect,
"a known Queen Street Blood," had run away from two other officers at
the park. Morse said that people were seen running, and that he and
his partner, Michael Concha, tried to block one of the park's
entrances.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, Morse wrote, Williams approached the officers,
belligerent and smelling of alcohol. When officers told him to turn
around and put his hands behind his back, Morse wrote, Williams
refused and cursed.</TE>
<TE>   Williams was sweating and had a blank stare and clenched fists,
Morse wrote. The officers now had backup, since a sergeant had
arrived, and they moved to subdue Williams.</TE>
<TE>   "Due to Williams' massive size, noncompliant behavior, his unknown
level of intoxication and the fact that he was becoming more
aggressive as time went by," Morse reported, "we felt in fear for our
safety and believed he was preparing himself to physically attack
us."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Williams described the start of the confrontation quite
differently. As he and the other man made their way onto the sidewalk
after cleaning the park, Williams said, a squad car approached, two
officers inside.</TE>
<TE>   The officers were calm, asked for identification, frisked the two
men, then let them go, Williams said. The man Williams was with
walked away and did not return. Williams said there was nobody else
on the street, just him and the two officers.</TE>
<TE>   But as he got into his car, parked nearby, and tried to drive
away, at least two more patrol cars sped down Ash Avenue and
screeched to a halt in front of him, Williams said. These officers
had a much different attitude. "Right off the top, they were angry,"
he said. "It was like they were dealing with someone who had just
robbed a bank or something."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Morse wrote that he and his partner tried to handcuff Williams,
but that Williams resisted, elbowed Concha, then turned toward Morse.</TE>
<TE>   "Officer Concha immediately attempted to place a carotid restraint
on Williams to overcome his resistance," Morse reported.</TE>
<TE>   What ensued, Morse said, was a scramble: Williams fighting,
Concha's arms wrapped around his neck, Concha, a small man compared
with Williams, dangling in the air.</TE>
<TE>   Morse joined the fray. "I felt in fear for Officer Concha's
safety," he wrote, "and I used my duty PR-24 aluminum baton to strike
Williams two times on the backside of his left leg in an attempt to
discontinue Williams' resistance."</TE>
<TE>   In Morse's retelling, all three men were soon on the ground.
Concha and Morse worked together to apply pressure to Williams' neck.
Morse wrote: "I placed pressure on officer Concha's right forearm to,
in turn, place pressure on Williams' left carotid artery. After about
10 seconds of pressure from my assistance, Williams appeared to be
unconscious."</TE>
<TE>   The fighting didn't end there. With the officers trying to
handcuff him, Williams stirred once more, resisting and pulling his
arm away from the sergeant who now assisted the two officers, Morse
wrote. Concha wrapped an arm around Williams' neck once again and
Williams passed out a second time.</TE>
<TE>   "We were able to place handcuffs on Williams without further
incident," Morse wrote.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Other than the fact that he lost consciousness, Williams' account
continues to differ markedly from Morse's.</TE>
<TE>   According to Williams, he found himself surrounded by squad cars
and officers were shouting, telling him to get out of his car with
his hands up. He said he did not recall what became of the two
officers with whom he originally talked.</TE>
<TE>   Williams said he complied, slowly raising his arms as he stepped
out of his car. As he stood, Williams said, one officer pushed him in
the back, causing him to fall hard onto the hood of the police car.
Williams straightened up and began pleading for calm, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Seemingly out of nowhere, Williams said, an officer smacked him in
the upper left arm. Williams said he asked, "What the hell did you do
that for?"</TE>
<TE>   The officers weren't happy with his response, Williams said. They
countered by telling him to get his hands up. Then one officer pulled
out a gun, stood about five feet away, and leveled the barrel at
Williams' face.</TE>
<TE>   "I said to myself, 'Look, I'm not about to go through no
"Mississippi Burning" thing,' " Williams recalled. "So I asked them
to put me in the car. So they don't have to hit me no more."</TE>
<TE>   Williams said he was handcuffed by two officers, which he claims
calmed him. The officers would feel more in control. I'm gonna be
fine, Williams told himself; the officers will soon figure out I'm no
threat. But "suddenly," he said, "somebody jumps on my back. There's
a guy on my back and I start getting beat."</TE>
<TE>   What Williams said he remembered after that were sparse details:
losing awareness, falling to the concrete, panic, a fight for air.
Then his memories begin fading.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It would have been just before Williams remembers falling to the
ground that Guillermo Beltran, an 18-year-old who lives in a house
just next to where the altercation happened, walked out his front
door, alerted by screeching police cars.</TE>
<TE>   Beltran said he was about 15 feet away from Williams and the
police, peeking from behind a red cinderblock wall. Beltran said he
first saw Williams with his hands up, with officers milling around.
Then, after Beltran went into his house for a moment to tell his
sister what was going on, he returned to find Williams' hands down at
his sides. He said he could not tell if Williams was in handcuffs.</TE>
<TE>   Beltran and Williams' stories differ in some ways. For instance,
Beltran said Williams was turned toward the park as officers
approached. Williams said he was facing away from the park. Beltran
said Williams drove his beat-up burgundy Chrysler Fifth Avenue about
20 feet before police stopped him. Williams said he could not get his
car started.</TE>
<TE>   On the matter of police treatment, though, their stories are
similar.</TE>
<TE>   "The big guy was just standing there, he seemed to be doing what
they said," said Beltran, who said he knows Williams only by
reputation. "Out of nowhere, the officers started swinging."</TE>
<TE>   Beltran said that as one officer held Williams from behind in a
chokehold, others began striking him, using their batons to hit him
in the upper body and legs. Beltran made a motion like a man chopping
a tree as he attempted to describe what happened.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, Beltran said, was pleading for them to stop, yelling: "I
can't breathe, I can't breathe."</TE>
<TE>   Beltran said that as Williams was being choked he appeared to go
limp, then toppled in a clump. Beltran said officers continued to hit
and kick Williams when he was on the ground. "I was seeing fists just
flying," he said. "It was about 30 seconds, all of that hitting."</TE>
<TE>   With Williams lying unconscious, officers stood about his body in
a relaxed mood, as if they were socializing, said Beltran and his
17-year-old sister, Cintia, who by that time also was watching. From
the kitchen doorway, Cintia said, she saw an officer kick at
Williams' legs.</TE>
<TE>   At about 11:27 p.m., Los Angeles County paramedics were called to
the scene by police, according to Fire Department records. They
arrived at 11:32 p.m. Racing Williams to the hospital, the medics
helped keep their patient breathing by placing an oxygen tube down
his throat, Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   Medical records show that Williams arrived at the hospital
suffering from "severe respiratory distress," unable to breathe
properly because his airways were swollen. His brain had been starved
of oxygen, he was bruised and puffy and his forehead bore a thick,
wide cut.</TE>
<TE>   When asked to compare Williams' condition with other patients
hospitalized after altercations with police, Dr. William Hong, one of
the physicians who treated him, said, "probably the worst I've seen."</TE>
<TE>   A medical worker who saw Williams carted into the hospital,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said Williams was in terrible
shape. "I thought he was going to die," said the medic. "It wasn't a
pretty sight. They told us he had been fighting with police."</TE>
<TE>   Hospital reports reviewed by The Times back up Morse's contention
that Williams had been drinking heavily. A medical report showed
Williams' blood alcohol was about 0.19%, more than twice the legal
limit.</TE>
<TE>   It would take three days for Williams to get out of the hospital,
a period in which his family filed a complaint against police,
organized a protest and began to pray that someone beyond their small
circle would care.</TE>
<TE>   The case was hardly noticed in Inglewood. It got no play in the
media. Then came July 6, and a video showing officer Morse's
treatment of a handcuffed teen.</TE>

<HD>The Great 'White' Influx</HD>
<DH>Regardless of color, two-thirds of immigrants choose that
designation on census replies. For some, it's synonymous with
America.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE and ROBIN FIELDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Zarmina Khalili says she never considered herself white until she
moved to the United States 15 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Race was a nonissue in her native Afghanistan, she said. There,
the basic distinctions were tribal, between Tajiks and Pashtuns.
Khalili knew where she stood: She was a Tajik.</LD>
<LD>   In America, it wasn't so clear. The census forms that came in the
mail asked Khalili, 42, a Canoga Park homemaker, to place herself in
one of six racial categories. She picked "white." Though she is
fair-skinned, it wasn't entirely a matter of color, she said.</LD>
<TE>   She regarded white as synonymous with American, with belonging,
with fitting in.</TE>
<TE>   In identifying herself that way, Khalili joined a growing number
of newcomers who are stretching traditional U.S. racial definitions
and--counterintuitive as it might seem--making white among the most
diverse of demographic categories.</TE>
<TE>   The 2000 Census counted 28 million foreign-born residents.
Two-thirds identified themselves as white. In 1990, half of the
foreign-born population checked "white."</TE>
<TE>   Another sign of change: In 1990, immigrants made up 5% of all
white Americans. By 2000, the foreign-born accounted for 9% of the
white population.</TE>
<TE>   Latinos, the nation's largest immigrant group, are driving those
numbers. Almost half checked the "white" box in Census 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "What white traditionally meant--the WASP, the blond hair, the
California drawl, the Hells Angels motorcycle riders--is being
overlaid with new images of white Russians and Armenians ...
Iranians, North Africans and Latinos," said USC demographer Dowell
Myers. "White is the most polyglot category, and it's morphing."</TE>
<TE>   Recent newcomers are expanding the meaning of "white" much as
Southern and Eastern European immigrants did a century ago, when many
Americans still viewed the word as signifying Anglo-Saxon heritage.</TE>
<TE>   The latest arrivals are also upsetting conventional wisdom, which
held that the percentage of white Americans would inevitably dwindle
over time. About 75% of the U.S. populace defines itself today as
wholly or partly white. Many demographers expect the same will be
true in 50 years, despite continued immigration from Latin America,
Asia and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been this idea that demography is destiny and that
America is going to be a nonwhite nation," said Peter Skerry, author
of "Mexican Americans: The Ambivalent Minority" and a fellow at the
Brookings Institution in Washington. "It ain't necessarily so."</TE>
<TE>   Why do so many recent immigrants choose a white identity?</TE>
<TE>   White Means Inclusion</TE>
<TE>   For earlier generations, the value of doing so was clear. They
were coming to a place where nonwhites suffered systematic
discrimination. Even today, many immigrants say they equate whiteness
with opportunity and inclusion.</TE>
<TE>   But a growing number, influenced heavily by Latino culture, say
they see race as fluid and whiteness as an unbounded territory they
can enter and exit at will.</TE>
<TE>   Yareli Arizmendi, a Mexican American actress, said she used to be
typecast as "the gangbanger's mother" or "the excitable Cuban woman."
So she stopped specifying her ethnicity at auditions. Recently, she
landed the part of a Jewish lawyer on an episode of the television
series "NYPD Blue." No one guessed her roots until she mentioned them
to a hairstylist on the set.</TE>
<TE>   "I am a Latino," said the actress, who lives in Hollywood. "But I
am white too, and I don't want to be pegged as 'the other.' "</TE>
<TE>   In Mexico, where Arizmendi was born and raised, "we never asked:
'What are you? What percentage Negroid? What percentage mongoloid?
Are you Latin American or Mayan or Aztec or European or Moorish?' "
she recalled. "Because a lot of us are all of these things."</TE>
<TE>   Other mixed-race people are embracing a similar sort of racial
flexibility, choosing white as their primary race. A 1995 federal
schools survey found that 17% of the children with an African
American parent and a white parent chose white as their primary
ethnicity. Among children with one Asian American parent and one
white parent, half considered white their primary race.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, people of mixed race were almost uniformly counted as
minorities, not as whites.</TE>
<TE>   Even siblings with identical racial backgrounds sometimes make
different choices based on personal experience. David Chau, 22, a
student at the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence, has a
Jewish mother and a Chinese American father. He considers himself
white. "White fits me best, I guess," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His older sister, Jen, sees herself as a minority: Jewish and
Asian. "I honestly don't know what white means," she said. "I don't
know what a white experience is."</TE>
<TE>   Debate about racial categories and their meaning revives each
decade when the U.S. Census Bureau asks American households about
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Changing Categories</TE>
<TE>   In the first national headcount, in 1790, government enumerators
placed people in four slots: free white males, free white females,
slaves, and "others," a category that included free Native Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Today, people fill out the survey themselves, choosing from six
options for race: white; black or African American; American Indian
or Native Alaskan; Asian; Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander;
and "other." In 2000, for the first time, respondents could check
more than one category.</TE>
<TE>   The census allows Latinos the most room for layered
self-definition. Since 1980, the survey has treated Hispanic
ethnicity apart from race, asking about it in a separate question and
indicating that Latinos can be of any race. The Hispanic category is
meant for people who trace their origins to a Spanish-speaking
nation.</TE>
<TE>   The choices Americans make about their racial identities have
far-reaching consequences. More than 60 federal agencies use census
data to distribute government funds. State legislatures use the
numbers in redrawing congressional districts. The Justice Department
consults the census in looking for patterns of racial discrimination.
Businesses base crucial decisions on the data, ranging from where to
open stores to how to market soft drinks.</TE>
<TE>   In doing so, they give bedrock permanence to racial identities
that may be ephemeral or subjective</TE>
<TE>   People who pick Hispanic as their ethnicity and white as their
race often are communicating that they feel "functionally white,"
said Ian Haney Lopez, a UC Berkeley law professor.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Latinos living in affluent, suburban parts of the Los
Angeles area tended to call themselves white in Census 2000. By
contrast, 50% or more of Latinos living in several of the region's
urban barrios picked "other" as their race.</TE>
<TE>   The sensation of being white waxes and wanes, and not just for
Latinos. Shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, FBI agents
came to the home of Khalili, the Afghan immigrant, to ask questions.
Her 15-year-old daughter was harassed at school.</TE>
<TE>   "Until Sept. 11, I just felt like this was my own country,"
Khalili said. "Now it's different. I feel like a minority."</TE>
<TE>   That same uneasy feeling might have shivered through an Irishman
in the 1850s or a Slav passing through Ellis Island in the 1920s.</TE>
<TE>   Go back far enough in U.S. history and many Americans who see
themselves as white could have been considered minorities at one
time. To Benjamin Franklin, for example, "white" referred only to
those of Anglo-Saxon descent.</TE>
<TE>   "Spaniards, Italians, French, Russians and Swedes are generally of
what we call a swarthy complexion; as are the Germans also, the
Saxons only excepted, who with the English, make the principal body
of white people on the face of the Earth," Franklin wrote in a 1751
essay, "Observations Concerning the Increase of Mankind and the
Peopling of Countries, Etc."</TE>
<TE>   Like Franklin, early U.S. laws regulating marriage, property
rights, citizenship, voting and other facets of life viewed whiteness
as a hereditary attribute. But the laws employed varying, often
conflicting, standards for determining who had it. Someone could be
deemed white for purposes of citizenship, but nonwhite under marriage
laws--and thus barred from marrying a white.</TE>
<TE>   Between the Civil War and World War II, Japanese, Arab, Afghan,
Armenian, Indian and other immigrants sued in U.S. courts, trying to
prove themselves white and therefore eligible to enter the country,
hold jobs or become citizens.</TE>
<TE>   National Identity</TE>
<TE>   Courts gave contradictory rulings. In 1910, an immigrant from
India named Dolla was pale enough to convince one court that he was
white. Ten years later, the Supreme Court ruled that another Indian
immigrant was not.</TE>
<TE>   The unprecedented wave of immigration at the turn of the 20th
century made the racial identity of newcomers a more contentious
issue than ever, as traditionalists declared the national identity
under siege.</TE>
<TE>   A 1911 congressional commission sought to quiet the controversy by
cataloging the identities of the immigrant flood. It issued a
"Dictionary of Races or People" that put Slavs, Poles, Italians,
Russians and others in 45 nonwhite racial subgroups. This prompted
intense opposition from immigrants, especially Jews, who were placed
in a "Hebrew" category.</TE>
<TE>   Many immigrants feared ostracism if the dictionary's distinctions
became policy or law. Ultimately, the government discarded the
categories. People with diverse origins came to be seen, and to see
themselves, as white.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican Americans became part of a similar debate as the United
States expanded west in the 19th century, absorbing sizable Latino
populations. After the end of the Mexican-American War in 1848,
census enumerators counted people with Spanish surnames as white.
That practice continued until 1930, when a separate "Mexican" racial
category was created. Mexican Americans successfully lobbied to have
the designation dropped in 1940. Once again, enumerators classified
virtually everyone with Spanish surnames as white.</TE>
<TE>   The discrimination visited on African Americans gave immigrants a
powerful incentive to be identified as whites.</TE>
<TE>   "They were coming into a society where slavery was synonymous with
skin pigmentation," said Joel Perlmann, a senior scholar at the
Jerome Levy Economics Institute at Bard College in New York. "It had
nothing to do with preserving their own culture."</TE>
<TE>   In the expansion of whiteness, African Americans have remained
conspicuously apart. They are the group least likely to intermarry
with other races and most likely to live in segregated communities
and attend segregated schools, according to census and other research
data.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone else has taken their positions in relation to that
duality," said Noel Ignatiev, a history instructor at the
Massachusetts College of Art and author of "How the Irish Became
White." "Everyone can assimilate into white America, except 'homie.'
"</TE>
<TE>   But some scholars say African Americans' historical exclusion
spurred them to a powerful political and cultural unity. The
solidarity they achieved during the civil rights movement of the
1960s is being emulated today by Latinos, said Todd Boyd, a USC pop
culture professor and the author of "Am I Black Enough For You?"</TE>
<TE>   "We took those crumbs and transformed it into a distinctive
culture," he said. Even African Americans who could "pass" as white
because of their appearance or cultural background choose not to,
Boyd said. "Now there's no reason to shy away from it--it's ours."</TE>
<TE>   Latinos have adopted a similar strategy, but with a twist, said
Arturo Vargas, executive director of the National Assn. of Latino
Elected and Appointed Officials.</TE>
<TE>   "To the extent that being white means being American, we are
white," Vargas said. "But at the same time, we don't have to deny
being Latino as much as before because we've had a significant civil
rights movement, and politically we're still one bloc."</TE>
<TE>   The question "Are you white?" puzzles many second- and
third-generation Americans. Many say they simply don't think about
it.</TE>
<TE>   "Whites live in a society that was created for them, that caters
to them, where they are the norm. They fit," said Matthew Kelley,
publisher of Mavin, a multiracial affairs journal in Seattle. "So to
a lot of people being white is almost indefinable. It's just this
kind of comfort that you don't recognize unless it goes away. It's
like describing air."</TE>
<TE>   Disturbing Definition</TE>
<TE>   When whites try to define whiteness, they often find the
experience uncomfortable, even disturbing.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, being proud that you're white is like some kind of Nazi
thing," said Tom Radu, 43, a general contractor from Monrovia. Radu
is of Swedish and Romanian ancestry and is married to a Mexican
American woman. He describes their 19-year-old son as a "whitesican."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Stewart, 49, who works with Radu, remembered an odd
conservation with his father about race.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him: 'You're half-white and half-Sicilian,' " recalled
Stewart. "Like a half-hour later, he came up to me and said with all
seriousness: 'I'm pretty sure Sicilians are considered white.' It
mattered so much to him that he was thinking about it all that time."</TE>
<TE>   Some whites yearn for a more distinct identity, in effect seeking
to go back to a time before their families joined the mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   "For many white Americans, white is not enough--there is no
unifying white experience," said Diena Simmons, producer of a
23-episode PBS documentary titled "Ancestors." "They want to say they
are Jewish, or Polish, or Ukrainian or something like that."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation opened a
Web site listing the names of 22 million immigrants who arrived in
the Port of New York between 1892 and 1924. The site
(www.ellisisland.org) logged 1 billion hits in its first month.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Nafius, a San Diego computer executive, was one of the teeming
masses at Ellis Island's virtual port. Within minutes, he found his
Irish great-grandmother's passenger record showing that she sailed to
New York from Liverpool on a ship called the Oceanic.</TE>
<TE>   "Growing up in the San Fernando Valley, white meant suburban,
being connected from mall to shining mall. That whole white-bread
kind of thing," Nafius said. "But I always wished I could have a real
ethnicity. I'm looking for a tribe to join. Don't I get a tribe?"</TE>

<HD>Democrats Zing Bush on Market-Scandal Response</HD>
<DH>Politics: Presidential hopeful Sen. Edwards decries lack of
corporate 'values.' Rep. Gephardt says he doesn't hear 'any new
ideas' for reform.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Democratic leaders said Tuesday they were winning the battle of ideas
with Republicans, accusing President Bush of failing to respond to a
wave of corporate scandals and investor uncertainty.</LD>
<LD>   "George W. Bush seems to know that things aren't working, so he
talks about it and talks about it and talks about it, but he doesn't
do anything about it," House Democratic leader Rep. Richard A.
Gephardt of Missouri told a gathering of centrist Democrats.</LD>
<LD>   "We can read this president's lips, but we don't hear any new
ideas and we don't see any real action," said Gephardt, the last of
five potential 2004 presidential hopefuls to speak at the Democratic
Leadership Council's annual meeting.</LD>
<TE>   Democrats claimed credit for the new law sponsored by Maryland
Democratic Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes that Bush signed Tuesday. They said
Republicans supported the law, which cracks down on accounting fraud
and makes it harder for company executives to deceive investors, only
under public pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "They felt the heat and saw the light," Gephardt said.</TE>
<TE>   North Carolina Sen. John Edwards, who spoke earlier in the day,
called for a new dedication to values, saying the greatest tragedy of
recent stock and corporate collapses was "the drop in corporate
values that led to the collapse."</TE>
<TE>   "We want an economy and a society that lives up to our values,"
said Edwards, who called for a corporate "right-to-know" rule that
would require companies to tell workers the pay of their chief
executives and justify the size of their compensation packages.</TE>
<TE>   "I know President Bush likes to steal our ideas--but Mr.
President, if you're not going to use this word 'responsibility,' we
want it back," he said.</TE>

<HD>Drug-Cost Riddle Unsolved in Senate</HD>
<DH>Politics: Congress' effort to cover prescriptions under
Medicare appears doomed in today's vote as heavy lobbying fails to
win over lawmakers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Congressional efforts to create a prescription drug benefit under
Medicare appeared headed toward collapse in the Senate on Tuesday, as
Democrats faltered in a last-ditch drive to build support for a
compromise.</LD>
<LD>   The alternative measure, which would target drug coverage for the
poor and those facing high drug costs, is scheduled for a Senate vote
today.</LD>
<LD>   Major senior citizens groups, including AARP, are lobbying hard
for the proposal. But proponents concede they are unlikely to have
the votes to pass it.</LD>
<TE>   If the compromise fails, it will significantly diminish chances
that Congress this year will pass legislation to provide drug
benefits through Medicare, an idea that politicians of both parties
have discussed and promised for years.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with the prospect that Congress will come up empty-handed,
lawmakers spent much of Tuesday maneuvering to blame their political
opponents for the failure.</TE>
<TE>   "If [Republicans] oppose us on the compromise, we'll know who
supports ... drug coverage and who doesn't," said Senate Majority
Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.).</TE>
<TE>   But Republicans accused Democrats of staging the debate not to
produce a law but to frame a political issue for this fall's
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "The way this was set up was almost designed for failure," said
Sen. Don Nickles (R-Okla.). "They're a little more interested in
playing politics than they are in serious legislating."</TE>
<TE>   At the least, the Senate is expected today to approve a more
modest effort to help people cope with soaring drug costs: a bill to
make it easier to get cheaper generic drugs to market. Lawmakers had
hoped to approve a Medicare drug benefit as an amendment to that
measure.</TE>
<TE>   In other action on the generic drug bill, the Senate voted down an
amendment that would have slapped new limits on medical malpractice
lawsuit awards, a big setback to President Bush's plan to overhaul
the medical liability system.</TE>
<TE>   The end of the debate on expanding Medicare to cover prescription
drugs came into view, ironically, on the 37th anniversary of the
establishment of the landmark health insurance program for the
elderly. The law's gap in coverage of prescription drugs has become
increasingly glaring over the years, with the development of costly
medications to treat chronic diseases.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is a priority for elderly voters, who are a key
political constituency. Members of both parties have campaigned for
years for the benefit, although Republicans and Democrats take very
different approaches.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP-led House already has passed a bill to provide
prescription drug coverage for the elderly but to provide the
benefits through private-insurance mechanisms. Democrats in both the
House and Senate favor a more costly program, which would be
government-administered through Medicare.</TE>
<TE>   When the leading alternatives came to a vote in the Senate last
week--a $370-billion GOP bill similar to the House's and a
$594-billion Democratic bill--neither garnered enough votes to pass.
Under Senate rules, 60 votes are needed to pass any prescription drug
bill that costs more than the $300 billion allotted in the
congressional budget.</TE>
<TE>   That stalemate sent members of both parties scrambling to see if
some middle ground could be found. Most Democrats and a handful of
Republicans rallied around a $390-billion alternative targeting
benefits to the poor and people facing catastrophic costs.</TE>
<TE>   Sponsored by Sens. Bob Graham (D-Fla.) and Gordon Smith (R-Ore.),
the plan would provide complete drug coverage only for Medicare
beneficiaries with annual incomes that do not exceed 200% of the
poverty line ($23,880 a year for couples).</TE>
<TE>   More-affluent Medicare beneficiaries would qualify for full drug
coverage only after their annual out-of-pocket drug expenses exceeded
$3,300. Those who don't fall under the low-income or "catastrophic"
coverage would get relief through a discount card, which could save
them 20% or more on prescription drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents said it is a good first step that would steer limited
resources toward those who need help with prescription costs the
most. But Republican critics said it is too much money for too little
coverage; they argued that their defeated private-sector plan could
provide universal coverage for comparable costs.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, who is facing a tough fight for reelection this year,
pleaded with fellow Republicans to support the compromise in a speech
Tuesday to the party's weekly closed-door caucus.</TE>
<TE>   Lobbyists for the elderly weighed in to drum up support, with the
president of the powerful AARP enlisted to call members.</TE>
<TE>   But by day's end, only one other Republican besides Smith publicly
embraced the compromise: Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who is also in
a competitive fight for reelection this year.</TE>
<TE>   Smith continued to hold out hope of gaining more support, but his
spokesman and other allies acknowledged it will be a battle. "It's
obviously going to be tough," said Chris Matthews, Smith's press
secretary.</TE>
<TE>   The amendment limiting medical malpractice awards was introduced
by Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to follow up a proposal Bush made
last week in North Carolina. He echoed Bush's argument that imposing
limits on jury awards would deter frivolous lawsuits and save tens of
billions of dollars in health-care costs.</TE>
<TE>   The amendment would have limited punitive damages in medical
malpractice cases to twice the amount awarded in compensatory
damages. It also would cap attorneys' fees in such cases to 33% of
the first $150,000 of an award and 25% of the award on all amounts
over $150,000.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats, consumer groups and trial lawyers say the limits would
make it harder for patients to hold medical professionals
accountable.</TE>

<HD>Mid-Atlantic States Wilt Amid Prolonged Heat</HD>
<DH>Weather: Temperatures near 100 worsen drought conditions.
Stifling humidity adds to misery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RALEIGH, N.C.</DL>
<LD>A week after the federal government declared much of drought-plagued
North Carolina a disaster area, much of the mid-Atlantic region coped
Tuesday with another day of sizzling heat and dripping humidity,
leaving some residents here wondering whether the four-year dry spell
would ever end.</LD>
<LD>   Temperatures hovered around 100 degrees and the heat index--a
combination of heat and humidity that determines how hot it
feels--reached 110. Weather officials offered sweat-drenched
residents a piece of advice: "Goodness gracious, stay in the
air-conditioning," meteorologist Mike Moneypenny told the Durham
Herald-Sun.</LD>
<LD>   On his tobacco farm in Bailey, 30 minutes east of here, Pender
Sharp headed out in the fields in his red pickup truck, carrying a
cooler loaded with ice, water and soft drinks. "You've got to get the
water to the fieldworkers twice a day in weather like this," he said.
"Otherwise, they'd fry."</LD>
<TE>   In Wilson, down Highway 264, nearly 50 kids showed up for the
first day of high school football practice. They spent as much time
gulping water as they did doing sprints. "I couldn't even tell you
how many water breaks we took," coach Randy Raper said.</TE>
<TE>   The heat stretched down the Atlantic seaboard, causing some power
outages but few complaints in North Carolina as power plants were
overloaded by too many air conditioners turned up full blast. For
native Carolinians, breathless heat and dreams of retreating to the
cool of the mountains is how summers are lived, day in and day out.</TE>
<TE>   Although what newspapers referred to a "cool spell" was predicted
later in the week, with temperatures dropping into the low 90s, the
dry, hot weather offered no foreseeable relief from North Carolina's
long drought--reminiscent of other multiyear droughts the state went
through in the 1920s, '50s and '80s.</TE>
<TE>   Last week's federal disaster declaration allows farmers to seek
relief from the drought that has dried up lakes and parched crops.</TE>
<TE>   "We're headed for a crop disaster this year" because of the
drought, said Peter Daniel, assistant to the president of the North
Carolina Farm Bureau. The state is agriculturally diverse, with
bountiful yields of tobacco, sweet potatoes, melons, cucumbers,
cotton and soybeans.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the drought, some farmers have had to import hay for
their cows from states as far away as Indiana, doubling their freight
costs. Snakes in larger than usual numbers have been seen in the open
as they crawl out of woodpiles and other cool shelters in search of
food and water. Many communities have imposed water restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Mike Easley has asked towns in drought-stricken areas to cut
water consumption by 20%, and Charlotte has imposed voluntary
restrictions: no filling swimming pools, no watering sidewalks, no
washing cars by hand, no glasses of water in restaurants unless
customers specifically ask for one.</TE>
<TE>   The town of Statesville last week issued its first-ever citations
to water violators, fining three businesses $100 each for ignoring
earlier warnings. Officials said the water supplies Statesville gets
from the South Yadkin River could dry up by October.</TE>
<TE>   Some areas of North Carolina are 5 feet below normal rainfall
since 1988. The Charlotte Observer reported that Charlotte, the
state's largest city, is 6 inches below normal this year and 45
inches below normal since 1988.</TE>

<HD>Navy's New Hornet Carries a Bigger Sting Than Predecessor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ABOARD THE CARRIER ABRAHAM LINCOLN, off Southern California--On the
flight deck above, the Navy's newest warplane, the F/A-18E Super
Hornet, is landing with the thunderous thump that befits its 34,000
pounds.</LD>
<LD>   Below decks, in the ready room of squadron VFA115, Cmdr. Jeff
Penfield explains what the Super Hornet will take to the fight
compared to other U.S. aircraft: "More lethality."</LD>
<LD>   Bigger, heavier and more expensive than the original Hornets that
joined the fleet in the early 1980s, the Super Hornets are built to
carry more bombs and more missiles and have what aviators call
"longer legs."</LD>
<TE>   With larger fuel tanks, the Super Hornet can fly farther without
refueling than the earlier version and can "loiter" longer over
targets waiting for bombing assignments to be coordinated. Super
Hornets also can act as refueling tankers, a first for a strike
fighter aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   After a decade of research and development, and after overcoming
aeronautic problems and political opposition, the Super Hornet
finally is deemed ready for combat, the Navy's first new fighter
design in nearly two decades.</TE>
<TE>   As the Lincoln and its battle group head toward an uncertain
mission in the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea, the 12 Super Hornets in
Penfield's squadron, which is based at the Naval Air Station at
Lemoore, Calif., are the first to be deployed to a war zone.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people are looking at us, wondering if we'll fall on our
faces," said Cmdr. Dale Horan, the squadron's executive officer. "The
airplane has proven itself. Now it's up to us to show what we're
capable of."</TE>
<TE>   The Super Hornet could be considered the aviation equivalent of
the sports-utility vehicle: a large, pricey conveyance that gives
away some speed and maneuverability in exchange for enhanced mission
capabilities and greater protection in case of a mishap.</TE>
<TE>   Boosters say it has the dogfighting ability of the F-14 Tomcat,
greater bombing punch than the early Hornet, the midair refueling
capability of the S-3 Viking and, with some tweaking, the electronic
warfare function of the AE-6B Prowler.</TE>
<TE>   Still, critics are concerned that the single-seat Super Hornet
design may leave pilots "overtasked" by the complexities of handling
the new and sophisticated systems, particularly during the high
stress of combat. (A two-person version of the Super Hornet, the
F/A-18F, is being tested by other squadrons.)</TE>
<TE>   "They say it takes 1.8 persons to fly a Super Hornet, but there's
only one of us in the plane," said Lt. Rob Kihm aboard the Lincoln.
"The goal is to be on top of everything when you're in the cockpit."</TE>
<TE>   Navy brass believe the Super Hornet is the combat workhorse of the
future, at least until the Joint Strike Fighter being built for the
Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps is delivered late this decade or
early in the next.</TE>
<TE>   Vice Adm. John Nathman, commander of Naval Air Force, Pacific
Fleet, said the Super Hornet brings "quantum improvements" in range,
payload and the ability to "strike targets deep in-country," like
those in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   With the increasing difficulty of convincing foreign countries to
allow the U.S. to base planes on their soil, the longer-range Super
Hornet will be able to reach targets from a carrier, Nathman said.</TE>
<TE>   Innovation does not come cheaply. At $57 million each, the Super
Hornet is nearly double the cost of the earlier version. (The Marine
Corps, which flies the Hornet, decided that the Super Hornet was too
expensive.)</TE>
<TE>   Boeing Co. has a contract to build 222 Super Hornets for the Navy
at its St. Louis plant, with the possibility of 300 more, although
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld is considering trimming the
order as a cost-cutting measure.</TE>
<TE>   The main subcontractor, Northrop Grumman Corp., has 1,500
employees at its El Segundo plant working on Super Hornets. Raytheon
Co. in El Segundo has 200 workers providing the radar and targeting
technology.</TE>
<TE>   The goal is for the Super Hornet to replace the aging Tomcats and
Hornets.</TE>
<TE>   The new plane's increased size--taller, longer, wider and 8,000
pounds heavier than the "heritage" Hornets--has earned it the
nickname Rhino. It does not have the top-end speed of the Hornet, not
to mention the super-fast Tomcat, the Tom Cruise plane from the movie
"Top Gun."</TE>
<TE>   "I miss that [the Tomcat speed], I'll be honest with you," said
Horan, a former F-14 pilot. "But tactics are such I should never get
in that situation where I need that extra speed."</TE>
<TE>   Any drop-off in speed, Super Hornet pilots say, is more than
compensated by other improvements in the plane.</TE>
<TE>   "A short guy with a gun beats a big guy with a knife," said Cmdr.
Brian Gawne. "The ability to point your nose and shoot in the Super
Hornet is unmatched."</TE>

<HD>Bishops' Panel Meets Amid Dissent</HD>
<DH>Scandal: Critics charge the church leaders' new sex abuse
policy lacks toughness in practice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHELLE MUNN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A panel set up by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops to address
allegations of sexual abuse of minors by priests held its first
meeting Tuesday and was immediately accused of failing to make its
policies as tough in practice as they are on paper.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests
alleged that cases in the archdioceses of Louisville, Ky.; Chicago
and Milwaukee, Wis., and the dioceses of Richmond, Va.; Tulsa, Okla.;
Kalamazoo, Mich.; Lexington, Ky.; Albany, N.Y.; and San Diego
indicated lax enforcement of the new policies, set June 14 by U.S.
bishops meeting in Dallas.</LD>
<LD>   "Some of the violations since Dallas are obvious and immediate,"
said SNAP executive director David Clohessy, who, along with three
other members of the victims' group, met with the church panelists
Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   After their first meeting, members of the National Review
Board--13 prominent Catholics who will advise the bishops' conference
on reports of molestation--sidestepped specifics of the allegations,
but said they would request information from all 194 dioceses on
every sexual abuse case and review the information when they meet
again Sept. 16.</TE>
<TE>   Elements of Policy</TE>
<TE>   Under the new policy, bishops in each diocese must report
allegations of sexual abuse of young people by priests to civil
authorities. Those accused are to be removed from public ministry,
away from places where they could be in contact with minors, as soon
as the allegations are deemed to be credible.</TE>
<TE>   But the victims' organization says that in the nine cases it
cites, the alleged perpetrators in five dioceses or archdioceses were
left in the ministry even after the policy change was announced,
while church officials in the other four fought to keep court cases
secret or, as in the San Diego case, deceived parishioners about the
amount of money spent on settlements.</TE>
<TE>   "If they are going to rely on the reports of the bishops, then we
question that," said Barbara Blaine, the president of SNAP. "We hope
they are going to go to other sources."</TE>
<TE>   The problem of pedophilia in the Catholic church was documented
long ago; in 1982, for example, the bishops' conference briefed two
dioceses on the civil liability risks involved with child molestation
cases. But institutional change comes slowly, and despite the new
policy for priests, only the Vatican can defrock a priest or depose a
bishop.</TE>
<TE>   "The bishop is the head of the local church. Other bishops can no
more sanction him than a governor of a state [can] sanction other
governors," said the Most Rev. Wilton D. Gregory, bishop of the
Diocese of Belleville, Ill., and president of the bishops'
conference.</TE>
<TE>   "But there's nothing to prevent a conference of bishops to call
for the resignation of a bishop. We've seen the destruction of
confidence in the leadership over the last several months. No bishop
wants to add his name to that list."</TE>
<TE>   In what became a refrain at a news conference after the review
board concluded its meeting, Frank Keating, governor of Oklahoma and
the board chair, promised to make Catholic schools and sites safe.</TE>
<TE>   "People are afraid to put their children in a Catholic school. We
want to excise the criminals and the predators and those evil
individuals who have soiled their vows," Keating said. "We intend to
shout to the highest heavens and identify them."</TE>
<TE>   Many Disappointed</TE>
<TE>   Some clergy and many parishioners were disappointed that the new
policy did not summarily remove accused molesters from the
priesthood.</TE>
<TE>   But they expressed hope that the review panel would quickly take
up its responsibilities. These include producing an annual report on
the church's management of pedophile priests and commissioning
studies on the causes of the current crisis and how far it extends
into the Catholic community, with statistics on victims and
perpetrators.</TE>
<TE>   But some victims' advocates and practicing psychologists expressed
doubts that the makeup of the new board--named just last week--would
offer succor to the victims.</TE>
<TE>   Board member Nicholas P. Cafardi, a legal counsel to the Diocese
of Pittsburgh for 13 years, is too closely aligned to the church,
victims' advocates say.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Bland, a psychologist and former priest who has worked for
more than 10 years with victims of clerical sexual abuse as a
clinical counselor at the Center for Psychological Services in Oak
Lawn, Ill., is the only panelist who is a victim of priest
molestation, but he works part-time for the Archdiocese of Chicago
and has ties that are too close to the church, say SNAP officials.</TE>
<TE>   Another member, psychiatrist Paul R. McHugh, has testified on
behalf of accused sexual abusers and is a critic of "recovered
memory" therapy, which has triggered many of the accusations against
priests nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Gartner, a psychoanalyst who has written extensively on
the sexual abuse of adolescents, questioned McHugh's inclusion on the
board.</TE>
<TE>   "To have the only neutral health professional be someone who is
skeptical of victims' stories sends the wrong message to victims, and
the wrong message to the rest of us," Gartner said.</TE>
<TE>   More than 250 of the nation's 46,000 priests have been suspended
so far this year.</TE>
<TE>   In California, more than 60 priests are being investigated for
alleged sexual abuse, and Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of the Los Angeles
Archdiocese has apologized for transferring--and not
suspending--miscreant priests.</TE>

<HD>Bush Signs Strict Business Reform Law</HD>
<DH>Finance: He emphasizes the greater punishments wrongdoers
face. It may take up to six months for the SEC to prepare rules on
independent audits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON and LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush signed far-reaching accounting reform legislation into
law Tuesday as corporate executives, auditors, lawyers and Wall
Street analysts braced for a significant change in the way they do
business.</LD>
<LD>   At the White House's carefully orchestrated signing ceremony, Bush
stressed the punitive aspects of the most far-reaching business
reforms since the Depression--measures that appeared all but dead
just a few months ago.</LD>
<LD>   "No more easy money for corporate criminals, just hard time," Bush
said.</LD>
<TE>   But while the prospect of tough prison sentences for white-collar
criminals has captured the spotlight, experts say the law's most
sweeping changes concern corporate governance.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers, for instance, now will have increased responsibility to
inform corporate boards of directors of misdeeds. And the boards'
audit committees must operate independently of management.</TE>
<TE>   Like much of the law, the audit committee requirements will be
spelled out in detail by the Securities and Exchange Commission in
regulations that could take three to six months to complete. But the
requirements are so substantial that some companies already are
scouting for qualified audit committee members.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the things that have to be done, people need to start
immediately to comply," said John Harkins, a partner in the
Philadelphia law firm of Harkins Cunningham who specializes in
corporate litigation and governance. "Companies can't wait until the
last minute."</TE>
<TE>   Finding qualified financial experts, such as public accountants,
auditors or controllers, will be hard enough. But finding people
willing to devote the time necessary to meet the new duties could
also be a challenge, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Audit committee members are going to have to work a lot harder.
There are a lot of obligations, and to spend the amount of time that
needs to be spent to do what has to be done means you are going to
have to look long and hard on whether you want to be on that
committee," Harkins said.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, as the reform bill worked its way through
Congress, Bush and lawmakers rallied behind it as a way to restore
investor confidence that had been badly shaken by a spate of business
scandals. But the financial markets sent a mixed signal Tuesday as
the measure became law.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average lost about 32 points, while the
Nasdaq and Standard &amp; Poor's indexes registered slight gains.
Analysts welcomed the results as a sign that the market may be
stabilizing.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the new law fulfills its promise of restoring integrity to
financial markets will depend heavily on the SEC, which has been
strongly criticized by some for not moving aggressively enough to
root out corporate misdeeds.</TE>
<TE>   The bill's congressional sponsors promised to keep an eye on the
agency. "We'll be watching very closely," Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes
(D-Md.), the bill's chief architect, said after attending the signing
ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   Investor groups said they also will be monitoring the bill's
implementation.</TE>
<TE>   "This new law has the potential to dramatically improve the
quality and independence of the audits of public companies and, in so
doing, to increase the reliability of corporate disclosures," said
Barbara Roper, director of investor protection for the Consumer
Federation of America. "But it will only live up to that potential if
everyone does their part, starting with [SEC Chairman] Harvey Pitt
and the SEC."</TE>
<TE>   The law gives the SEC 90 days to appoint the five members of a
new, independent board that will oversee the accounting industry.
Reform advocates have touted this board as essential to more
effectively policing the accounting industry and preventing the type
of accounting abuses that have surfaced in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt said Tuesday that the SEC will "do our utmost to meet all
timetables."</TE>
<TE>   The bill establishes tougher criminal penalties for white-collar
crimes, including quadrupling, to 20 years, the maximum prison
sentence for mail and wire fraud. It also establishes a new crime of
securities fraud, punishable by up to 25 years in jail.</TE>
<TE>   However, experts predicted that the law's longer sentences for
corporate crimes would have little, if any, effect on the behavior of
officers, directors and consultants who are inclined to cross the
line. Also, it is unclear how many more cases federal investigators
and prosecutors will be able to take to trial, even with added
resources.</TE>
<TE>   "Another $100 million is like throwing nickels at the system,"
said Henry Pontell, a criminology professor at UC Irvine. "The real
question is does the system have the capacity to push cases to that
final stage? That's always been the Achilles' heel of the criminal
justice system when it comes to processing white-collar crime cases.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at the SEC budget compared to what they spend on
drugs, it's a small fraction, and the amount of work that's required
to do these kinds of cases is preposterous."</TE>
<TE>   The law is expected to hit small firms harder than big ones.</TE>
<TE>   "From a smaller, emerging-growth company perspective, it will
probably make it more difficult to attract qualified board
directors," said Mark Heesen, president of the National Venture
Capital Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "With the greater exposure to liability for directors that's in
this bill, you could see some people who are already squeamish about
sitting on boards saying, 'Is it really worth it?' "</TE>
<TE>   As a result, he said, small companies may have to spend more time
and resources recruiting directors, and they may have to settle for
less-qualified directors.</TE>
<TE>   Small companies already were reeling from increases in insurance
premiums for director and officer coverage in the wake of recent
accounting scandals, Heesen said. The increased liability the law
places on officers and directors is likely to push such costs even
higher, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But he noted that the national focus on corporate governance
already had spurred many boards to pay closer attention to the
companies they supervise.</TE>
<TE>   "The law has had a very positive impact in that, even before it
was signed, the idea that Congress was out there debating these
issues made it clear that things had to change," Heesen said.</TE>
<TE>   "Audit committees, compensation committees had to change what they
had been doing. From our angle, that's not a bad thing."</TE>
<TE>   Regulatory-wary Republicans, including Bush, initially had
resisted some of the law's key measures, which were sparked by the
financial collapse late last year of Enron Corp. But the revelations
in late June of accounting irregularities by WorldCom Inc. roiled the
markets, rekindled interest in corporate reform and ultimately
created virtually unanimous support in Congress for a tough measure.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday, Bush urged the Democratic-led Senate to take additional
action and pass a pension reform measure similar to the one approved
by the Republican-controlled House earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   Senate leaders plan to take up the measure in September. It would
give employees new rights to sell company stock and diversify
investments in their 401(k) retirement accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats also made it clear that they will keep up the pressure
on the corporate reform issue. Rep. John J. LaFalce of New York, the
top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, said he hopes
Bush, "while a late convert to the effort of producing substantial
and meaningful reform," supports a hefty budget increase for the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   Political analysts differed on whether the new law will help Bush
and other Republicans blunt Democratic criticism that they were not
aggressive enough on corporate corruption.</TE>
<TE>   At the bill-signing, "Bush looked like the proud father of
corporate reform," said Larry Sabato, a political science professor
at the University of Virginia. But, he added, "it's not enough with
the November election looming. Bush needs a stream of favorable
developments and headlines about CEO crooks being arrested, the
economy improving and the market recovering."</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Basham, senior fellow for the libertarian Cato Institute,
said Bush now has "sufficient cover" to remain optimistic about the
midterm elections and his own reelection chances in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   And a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll released Tuesday suggested that
Democrats have only a slight edge over the GOP on the issue of
corporate responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   After Bush signed the bill, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney led a
rally of union members near the New York Stock Exchange, denouncing
"corporate pirates" and vowing to push for pension reforms and other
bills to protect workers and investors.</TE>
<TE>   "The sad truth is that American consumers can shop with more
assurance of quality and safety at their corner grocery store than
American investors can shop for equities in our stock market,"
Sweeney told the crowd.</TE>

<HD>Drug Trade Funding Terror Groups' Actions, U.S. Says</HD>
<DH>Crime: Federal data offer 'shocking' insight into links
between two threats, Ashcroft says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The United States has determined that about one-third of foreign
terrorist organizations are trafficking in narcotics on a large
scale, providing authorities with "shocking" insight into how two of
the nation's most serious threats are connected, U.S. Atty. Gen. John
Ashcroft said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "Law enforcement has been aware for some time of significant
linkages between terrorism and drug trafficking. But we have not had
the tools to quantify the drugs-terrorism nexus until now," Ashcroft
said in a speech before the annual conference of the Organized Crime
and Drug Enforcement Task Force.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this year, Ashcroft said, he asked federal law enforcement
agencies to draw up such a list, quantifying all the major
trafficking groups responsible for the U.S. drug supply.</LD>
<TE>   "Following extraordinary collaboration and information-sharing
between agencies, this list has been developed, and what it reveals
is shocking," Ashcroft said. "Nearly one third of the organizations
on the State Department's list of foreign terrorist organizations
appear also on our list of targeted U.S. drug suppliers."</TE>
<TE>   Cross-matching the lists is providing authorities with substantial
leads in their ongoing global war on terrorism, Ashcroft noted, as
well as helping to combat the growing problem of traffickers
responsible for selling cocaine, heroin and other drugs worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft's remarks came as U.S. authorities, working with state
and local officials and their counterparts in Mexico, announced that
they had arrested more than 2,120 fugitives along the Southwestern
border in recent months, as part of the largest nonterrorism dragnet
in recent memory.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft did not elaborate on which terrorist groups are suspected
of being involved in drug-trafficking. Justice Department officials
would not comment on what organizations are on the drug trafficking
list, except to say that Al Qaeda was one of them.</TE>
<TE>   "They are definitely using the drug trade to finance their
operations, but it is not the major source of funding," one Justice
Department official said of Al Qaeda, which U.S. officials have said
was responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and the
Pentagon. "They get more money from donations and trading in gold and
other precious metals. It's a serious problem, but it's hard to say
this is where we should be putting all our resources."</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, the Justice Department official said, Al Qaeda and
the Taliban regime that protected it made millions of dollars from
the heroin trade in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Chertoff, assistant attorney general for the Justice
Department's criminal division, echoed Ashcroft's concerns in his own
remarks at the daylong conference of law enforcement officials from
around the nation.</TE>
<TE>   "Drug traffickers have a symbiotic relationship with terrorists,"
Chertoff said.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft said drug traffickers began engaging in terrorist
activity as their organizations grew in scope and sophistication.
Conversely, terrorists have expanded into drug trafficking to pay for
travel and expenses of operatives and weapons, according to Justice
Department officials.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department, in consultation with the attorney general
and the secretary of the Treasury, has designated 28 groups as
foreign terrorist organizations. Those groups include Al Qaeda,
Hamas, Hezbollah and other Islamic groups, as well as militant
organizations in Spain, Sri Lanka, Colombia, Peru, Israel and
Northern Ireland.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have long been concerned about the connections between
terrorism and drug trafficking.</TE>
<TE>   In South America, for instance, paramilitary organizations
suspected of engaging in both terrorism and drug trafficking include
the left-wing FARC, or Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, and
the right-wing United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia.</TE>
<TE>   Also at the conference, authorities announced that many of the
fugitives rounded up by teams led by U.S. marshals were "major
narcotics criminals" whose operations were responsible for a
significant portion of the drugs flowing across the Southwestern
border.</TE>
<TE>   They included the brother of celebrity murder victim Bonny Lee
Bakley, an allegedly dirty Drug Enforcement Administration agent who
had fled to Mexico, and an accused operative of a murderous Mexican
drug cartel who drove to visit relatives in San Diego.</TE>

<HD>Torricelli Is 'Severely Admonished'</HD>
<DH>Politics: The Democratic senator apologizes but doesn't
admit taking gifts from a donor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Senate Select Committee on Ethics "severely admonished" Sen.
Robert Torricelli (D-N.J.) on Tuesday, citing his "poor judgment" and
failure to heed the rules in accepting expensive gifts from a major
campaign contributor.</LD>
<LD>   Torricelli, a first-term senator locked in a tight November
reelection battle, immediately accepted the judgment of his peers. On
the floor of the Senate late Tuesday, the 50-year-old lawmaker
offered a sweeping apology to his constituents and fellow senators.</LD>
<LD>   "During recent weeks I have spent long nights tormented by the
question of how I could have allowed such lapses of judgment to
compromise all that I have fought to build," said Torricelli, in an
uncharacteristically soft-spoken delivery. "It might take a lifetime
to answer that question to my own satisfaction."</LD>
<TE>   The stern three-page letter issued by the committee Tuesday night
came less than a week after the House of Representatives expelled
Rep. James A. Traficant Jr. (D-Ohio) for serious ethics
violations--making him only the second member of the House to be
thrown out since shortly after the Civil War.</TE>
<TE>   Whereas Traficant was convicted of federal corruption charges in
April, a three-year Justice Department probe of Torricelli ended in
January without an indictment. The U.S. attorney's office in New York
City concluded that there was "not a reasonable possibility the
government could prevail at trial" and turned the matter over to the
ethics committee.</TE>
<TE>   Torricelli's fate has generated interest in part because of the
Senate's close division along party lines, with control of the
chamber potentially resting on the changeover of a single seat in the
November elections.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the committee's three Democrats and three Republicans
heard from only one witness, Torricelli. The committee also reviewed
thousands of pages gathered during the criminal probe into
Torricelli's relationship with David Chang, a former friend and
booster serving 18 months in prison for making illegal contributions
to Torricelli's 1996 Senate campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Chang has alleged that he gave Torricelli cash and gifts to gain
his assistance in business dealings. The ethics committee letter
noted, however, that the Justice Department officials and a federal
judge had concluded that Chang "could not be trusted."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the members cited instances in which Torricelli's
actions "evidenced poor judgment, displayed a lack of regard for
Senate Rules and resulted in a violation of the Senate Gifts rules"
as well as public disclosure obligations.</TE>
<TE>   "After evaluating the extensive body of evidence before it and
your testimony, the Committee is troubled by incongruities,
inconsistencies and conflicts, particularly actions taken by you
which were or could have been of potential benefit to Mr. Chang,"
said the letter, signed by Sens. Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii), Blanche
Lambert Lincoln (D-Ark.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Pat Roberts (R-Kan.),
Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) and George Voinovich (R-Ohio.).</TE>
<TE>   The admonishment is one of several forms of punishment, short of
censure or expulsion, that the committee is allowed to issue without
a vote by the full Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Torricelli said to his colleagues that, although "it has always
been my contention that at no time did I accept any gifts or violate
any Senate rules, the committee has concluded otherwise."</TE>
<TE>   And he said he intended to comply "immediately" with the
committee's demand that he pay fair-market value for items Chang gave
to him, his sister and other friends. They included a big-screen
television, a CD player and earrings.</TE>
<TE>   He apologized to "the people of New Jersey" for having "placed the
seat of the United States Senate they have allowed me to occupy ...
in this position."</TE>
<TE>   But he also defended his record in office.</TE>
<TE>   "The question that I want every person in New Jersey to have
answered today is that all during this ordeal, I never stopped
fighting for the things that I believed, I never compromised in the
struggle to make the lives of the people I love better," said
Torricelli, one of the Democratic Party's most effective
fund-raisers.</TE>
<TE>   In New Jersey, the campaign office of Torricelli's Republican
challenger, businessman Douglas Forrester, issued a sharp rebuke,
calling on the senator to release his sworn testimony to the ethics
committee and other statements he made during the criminal probe.</TE>

<HD>Traficant Gets 8 Years Behind Bars</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CLEVELAND</DL>
<LD>Expelled from Congress a week ago, an unrepentant James A. Traficant
Jr. on Tuesday was sentenced to eight years behind bars for
corruption and made it clear he intends to run for reelection from
his prison cell--and expects to win.</LD>
<LD>   The 61-year-old former House member was led to jail in handcuffs
after the judge refused to let him remain free on bail while he
appeals his conviction on charges of taking bribes and kickbacks.</LD>
<LD>   "Quite frankly, I expect to be reelected," the pugnacious former
congressman told U.S. District Judge Lesley Wells after she imposed
the sentence.</LD>
<TE>   The judge gave Traficant a longer sentence than the minimum 7 1/4
years prosecutors had requested, saying he had undermined respect for
the government and lied to distract attention from the charges
against him.</TE>
<TE>   The judge also fined him $150,000 on top of the $96,000 the jury
required him to forfeit in ill-gotten gains. "To protect a junkyard
full of deceit and corruption and greed, you fought like a junkyard
dog," Wells said, borrowing Traficant's own words.</TE>
<TE>   Defiant throughout his trial and ethics hearings in Congress,
Traficant filed earlier this year to run for a 10th term in November
as an independent, despite the threat of imprisonment and expulsion.</TE>
<TE>   Traficant said Tuesday that he plans to run for reelection from
prison, and he asked the judge to select a prison in Ohio to make
sure he is still eligible to run in the state.</TE>

<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court Tuesday refused to stop Denver media magnate
Dean Singleton from taking control of Utah's biggest newspaper, the
132,000 circulation Salt Lake Tribune.</LD>
<LD>   In a two-paragraph ruling, the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals
said the Salt Lake Tribune Publishing Co., controlled by the
McCarthey family of Utah, did not show it was entitled to an
injunction to stop Singleton. The McCarthey family and management at
the newspaper said they had an option to buy it by July 31.</LD>
<LD>   "After careful consideration of the arguments therein, in light of
applicable legal authority, we conclude the plaintiff has not
demonstrated its entitlement to injunctive relief," the appeals court
judges said.</LD>
<TE>   Denver-based MediaNews, a privately owned chain headed by
Singleton, bought the Utah publication in early 2001 from AT&amp;T Corp.,
but the McCarthey family and the newspaper's management sued.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's decision will allow Singleton to take control of the
newspaper on Thursday. The McCarthey family and management had said
the newspaper would lose its independence if taken over by Singleton.</TE>
<TE>   The McCartheys and Tribune managers claimed Singleton had become a
front for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</TE>

futile attempt to rescue pilot whales that stranded themselves on
beaches in Cape Cod, Mass. All of the 45 whales that beached
themselves Tuesday either died of natural causes or were euthanized.
The cape historically has been a site for mass strandings, marine
experts said.</CP>

<HD>McLemore Puts Squeeze on Tigers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At 37, Mark McLemore still loves getting the hit that ends a game.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm a competitor, I want it to be on me and I want to be the one
to get the winning hit," McLemore said after delivering the winning
run with a squeeze bunt in the 10th inning at Seattle that lifted the
Mariners over the Detroit Tigers, 5-4, Tuesday afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   "It doesn't always work out that way, but that doesn't mean that I
don't want it," McLemore said.</LD>
<TE>   With the score tied, 4-4, Edgar Martinez led off the 10th with a
double against Jeff Farnsworth (2-3), and Desi Relaford pinch-ran.</TE>
<TE>   John Olerud was intentionally walked, Charles Gipson sacrificed
and Mike Cameron was intentionally walked, loading the bases.</TE>
<TE>   Pinch-hitting for Ben Davis, McLemore bunted on a 2-and-1 pitch,
with Relaford beating Farnsworth's throw to catcher Brandon Inge.
McLemore was credited with a single.</TE>
<TE>   McLemore said he got to the major leagues with the Angels in 1986
because of his ability to bunt.</TE>
<TE>   "I came up with the Angels way back when Gene Mauch was the
manager, and everybody remembers Gene Mauch and what kind of baseball
he played," he said. "So if you couldn't bunt, you weren't going to
play for him."</TE>
<TE>   Manager Lou Piniella used a squeeze by Charles Gipson to score
Luis Ugueto at Texas on July 18, breaking a ninth-inning tie in a 5-3
victory.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a play I don't like," Piniella said. "I've said that many
times. But McLemore's the right guy in a situation like that and he
laid down a perfect bunt."</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Manager Luis Pujols said he thought the Mariners might try
the squeeze, but with a 2-and-1 count, he couldn't risk a pitchout.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have the right man at the plate and the right guy at
third and you have the count, there is nothing you can do," Pujols
said. "Just hope he fouls off the pitch."</TE>
<TE>   Seattle's Ichiro Suzuki ended an 0-for-16 hitless streak, his
longest this season, with an infield single in the seventh. Last
year, he went hitless in 18 at-bats in July.</TE>
<TE>   Suzuki went one for five and his batting average slipped to .351,
a loss of 14 points since Friday night. He is four points behind
Kansas City's Mike Sweeney, the league leader.</TE>
<TE>   New York 9, Texas 6--Bernie Williams and Jason Giambi each hit
two-run homers, helping David Wells overcome a rocky start at
Arlington, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   It was the Yankees' 10th victory in 13 games.</TE>
<TE>   Raul Mondesi and Alfonso Soriano also homered for the Yankees, who
hit four home runs or more for the eighth time. Texas hit three,
including Alex Rodriguez's major-league leading 35th.</TE>
<TE>   Wells (12-5) won his fifth consecutive decision, giving up four
runs and seven hits in seven innings.</TE>
<TE>   Ramiro Mendoza got the final out for his second save.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 10, Baltimore 3--Jared Sandberg hit his first career
grand slam during a six-run first inning at St. Petersburg, Fla., and
Joe Kennedy (6-8) struck out seven in tying Kansas City's Paul Byrd
for the American League lead with his fifth complete game.</TE>
<TE>   Aubrey Huff homered twice for Tampa Bay, which has won six of 10.</TE>
<TE>   John Stephens, the 17th Australian to play in the major leagues,
gave up nine runs and 10 hits--including three homers--in three
innings in his major league debut.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 3, Minnesota 0--Mark Buehrle (14-7) gave up five hits at
Minneapolis for his third career shutout and second consecutive
victory over the Twins.</TE>
<TE>   Magglio Ordonez hit a three-run homer against Kyle Lohse (10-6),
who gave up six hits in 6 2/3 innings. It was Lohse's first loss in
five career decisions against the White Sox.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago's Frank Thomas walked twice to give him 1,250 for his
career, passing Ty Cobb for the 37th spot.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 13, Kansas City 4--Vernon Wells hit a bases-clearing
triple in a five-run fifth inning at Kansas City, Mo., and tied a
career-high with four runs batted in to help the Blue Jays end a
four-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando Hudson, recalled July 24 from triple-A Syracuse, had his
first three-hit game and scored two runs for the Blue Jays, who had
17 hits.</TE>
<TE>   Pete Walker (4-2) got his first victory as a starter in six starts
since June 8, giving up three runs and seven hits in five innings.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 5, Oakland 4--Ricky Gutierrez drove in two runs at
Oakland and Ryan Drese won for only the second time in eight starts.</TE>
<TE>   Drese (9-8), who grew up in Oakland and attended California, gave
up one run and eight hits in 5 1/3 innings. He walked two and struck
out three.</TE>

<HD>Dying to Be Heard</HD>
<DH>A decade later, Lyle Alzado's family is frustrated that
the message of steroid abuse isn't getting through</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LANCE PUGMIRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In May, Justin Alzado became credentialed by the National Athletic
Trainers Assn., and has been hired as a personal trainer at a health
club near his home in Roswell, Ga. He preaches a natural route to
physical fitness and discourages use of legal, over-the-counter
supplements such as creatine and ephedrine.</LD>
<LD>   He is so committed to his message that MTV used him for an
upcoming episode of the reality show "Flipped." In it, Alzado, 20,
meets a Southern California junior college football player who says
he is considering using steroids.</LD>
<LD>   "I explain to him why he shouldn't," Justin said in a recent
interview. "I tell him my dad died because of that."</LD>
<TE>   Justin is the only child of Lyle Alzado, the star NFL defensive
end who attributed excessive steroid use to the brain cancer that
killed him.</TE>
<TE>   More than 10 years after Lyle Alzado's pleas to end steroid use in
sports were muted by his death, family members said they are
frustrated but not surprised that the message has been diminished by
time and dismissed by several athletes.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand the goal of some of these guys; that athletes are
ambitious people," Justin said. "At the same time, I'm disappointed
my dad's words are going unheard. He made a strong effort to warn
others of the risks of steroids and, hopefully, they'll see the big
picture in the end."</TE>
<TE>   Lyle Alzado, who played for the Denver Broncos, Cleveland Browns
and Los Angeles Raiders from 1971-85, died at 43 on May 14, 1992. He
insisted that almost 20 years of steroid use was the major
contributing factor.</TE>
<TE>   "When you eat right and drink right and you don't stay out late at
night and you get sick, in my case, it was from steroids," Alzado
told The Times in a January 1992 interview. "I made a big mistake,
and I [am] trying to tell the kids of America to stay away from it
because I believe wholeheartedly that it has given me cancer. I would
hate for anyone else to go through this pain."</TE>
<TE>   The NFL has conducted random steroid testing since 1990. But the
use of steroids and other illegal performance enhancing substances
has become an increasing concern in sports that do not test, such as
Major League Baseball. In a recent admission of steroid use by former
National League most valuable player Ken Caminiti, he estimated use
in the sport to be at least 50%.</TE>
<TE>   "I actually think Lyle would say he understands completely why
steroids continue to be out there," said Cindy Alzado, Justin's
mother and the second of Lyle's four wives. "He was proof that when
you have a passion, nothing will keep you from it. It took dying for
him to understand how bad that logic was."</TE>
<TE>   Alzado admitted using steroids throughout his professional career.</TE>
<TE>   He was an intimidating, 6-foot-3, 255-pound defender, an NFL
defensive lineman of the year in 1977 who led Denver's famed "Orange
Crush" defense to a Super Bowl appearance. He once fought Muhammad
Ali in a boxing exhibition. He was an All-Pro in 1978 as a Bronco and
1979 as a Brown and was the NFL's 1982 comeback player of the year
with the Raiders.</TE>
<TE>   The bearded Alzado's aggressive style and colorful personality
made him one of Raider owner Al Davis' favorite players. In one game,
Alzado ripped the helmet off New York Jet offensive tackle Chris Ward
and flung it downfield. The NFL responded by instituting a rule that
outlawed helmet throwing.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody loved that game more than Lyle," Cindy Alzado said. "He
truly was a warrior."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, she said that she believes the steroid abuse caused Lyle to
resort to rages, including episodes when he would hit her. She said
the domestic abuse prompted her to summon Manhattan Beach police to
their home at least five times during their brief 1984-85 marriage.
She said Lyle was never arrested.</TE>
<TE>   "He was always Mr. Calm by the time they got to the house," Cindy
said. "It always ended the same way, with him signing autographs for
[the officers]."</TE>
<TE>   Lyle and Cindy met in the 1960s while attending Lawrence High in
Cedarhurst, N.Y. After Lyle divorced a woman he met at Yankton
College in South Dakota, he reunited with Cindy in New York and they
lived together from 1981-85.</TE>
<TE>   "When we wanted to have a child, I was concerned his steroid habit
would affect the baby, so Lyle quit for several months, but as soon
as Justin was born [in 1982], he was back on them," Cindy said.</TE>
<TE>   Cindy said Lyle was never declared impotent, an occasional side
effect of steroid use, but she said his sperm count was diagnosed as
low.</TE>
<TE>   She said he followed a disciplined pattern of steroid intake,
using three times a week while frequenting Gold's Gym in Venice.</TE>
<TE>   One of the Alzados' numerous arguments was in Gold's parking lot.
Cindy said she tried to run over Lyle in her car.</TE>
<TE>   "He asked me more than once, 'Why am I such a success in my
professional life and such a failure in my personal life?' " Cindy
said. "I told him it was the steroids, but he couldn't let them go
because he couldn't let go of football."</TE>
<TE>   Among her numerous attempts to encourage Lyle to quit using, Cindy
once read him a Sports Illustrated article depicting the admission of
steroid use by former NFL offensive lineman Steve Courson. When
Courson discussed his relationship problems, Cindy said she told
Lyle, "This is proof. This is us."</TE>
<TE>   In 1984, after Alzado and the Raiders had won the Super Bowl by
dominating the defending champion Washington Redskins, 38-9, Cindy
said Lyle's steroid use advanced from pill popping to injections.
Saying she believed Lyle's age was the reason behind his change in
usage, Cindy called Raider team doctor Robert Huizenga and told him
the steroids were altering Lyle's personality, robbing her of "the
Lyle I knew and loved."</TE>
<TE>   "Lyle and I used to have incredibly horrible arguments," said
Huizenga, who served as Raider doctor from 1983-1991. "I was telling
him the steroids were markedly affecting his cholesterol level and
liver function and he would respond, 'Leave me alone. I can't play in
the NFL without this stuff.' "</TE>
<TE>   Former Raider teammate Mike Haynes recalls watching an artist on
the sideline of a Raider game work on a portrait of Alzado sitting on
his helmet. The artist's sketch detailed a large lump below the right
side of his hip, the spot where Alzado would inject the steroids.
Haynes said he wondered to himself: How many times would you have to
inject to make a lump that big? Cindy said Lyle told her that Raider
teammates chided him about "that baseball in his back pocket."</TE>
<TE>   "In training camp, my room was next to his and there were many
times I could hear him just screaming at whoever he was talking to on
the phone," Haynes said. "I'd see him 15 minutes later and he'd be
acting like nothing was bothering him at all.</TE>
<TE>   "In one game, he did something to somebody and an official said,
'Alzado, I saw you, and if you do it again, I'll toss you.' Lyle
says, 'You don't have the [guts] to toss me.' He was really angry, so
I tried to calm him down so he wouldn't get kicked out. He looked at
me with these bloodshot eyes and just shoved my arm off of him. He
was just such a gentle, kind, giving guy otherwise. You'd see this
other side of him, though, and wonder, 'Where did this come from?' "</TE>
<TE>   Alzado retired after the 1985 season. Cindy filed for divorce in
January 1985. She said she moved into a Manhattan Beach apartment for
three months, but after repeated visits by Alzado she took Justin
back to Cedarhurst.</TE>
<TE>   "Lyle and I were both volatile. It was just crazy between us,"
Cindy said. "He would be very jealous, very insecure and very
irrational about us. It was a rough decision, but I had no choice but
to get away. I blame our divorce on the steroids."</TE>
<TE>   Justin has few vivid memories of his father--trips to the mall for
toys, having fun at the beach.</TE>
<TE>   Cindy, who received $2,500 in monthly child support and alimony
payments from Lyle, clearly remembers a 1988 trip to visit Lyle in
California with Justin. After a stop at a yogurt shop near Alzado's
West Hollywood restaurant, Lyle collapsed and suffered a cut on his
nose that required 17 stitches to close.</TE>
<TE>   Huizenga said he requested Alzado submit to an MRI exam of the
brain, but Alzado, who admitted to using human growth hormone during
a failed comeback attempt in 1988, declined.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me he didn't need one because one of those idiot
bodybuilders he knew had told him he collapsed because his neck
muscles were so built up that it must have cut off the circulation,"
Cindy said. "Lyle believed it. But I've always regretted that we
didn't get him in there for that MRI, because I'm sure that was the
first sign of that tumor."</TE>
<TE>   Huizenga said Alzado acknowledged using steroids even after his
playing days were finished.</TE>
<TE>   "He was an example of one of the big problems in steroids that
isn't discussed as often as it should be: how difficult it is to come
off of," Huizenga said. "Someone would tell Lyle he didn't look as
big as he used to on TV, and boom, he was right back on it. There are
severe psychological pulls with steroids, serious hormonal
withdrawals for those who try to stop."</TE>
<TE>   When Alzado received the brain cancer diagnosis in April 1991,
Huizenga said he accompanied Alzado to his home and was shown a
massive shopping bag of drugs. Alzado declared himself through with
them.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me he wanted to champion a cause, that he was certain
steroids had done this to him, and he wanted to let the world know
what he had done, at the expense of his career luster," Huizenga
said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Cindy Alzado: "It was the hardest thing he did in his life,
standing up there and looking so weak, because he was so proud of his
physicalness. Justin has told me he's more proud of his dad coming
forward on this than by any of his awards."</TE>
<TE>   Justin has grown to 6-2, 240 pounds. He did play one season of
high school football, spending his sophomore year wearing No.
77--Lyle's number--as a starting defensive end for Roswell High's
junior varsity team.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a blast, but I think there were a lot of people expecting
me to be as good as my dad," Justin said.</TE>
<TE>   He returned to his favorite sport, basketball, and averaged 18
points a game as a senior.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids told Justin when he was growing up how lucky he is that his
dad's a celebrity," Cindy said.</TE>
<TE>   Justin responded, "I'm not lucky. My dad's dead."</TE>

<HD>Martinez Still the Real Deal</HD>
<DH>Angels: Red Sox get a lift from their ace, who throws eight
shutout innings, and acquisition of Floyd.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No glaring weaknesses, the Angels say. No need to upgrade, to make a
significant deal by this afternoon's trading deadline. This team can
make the playoffs as is.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe they can. That will be determined over the next two months.</LD>
<LD>   But the Angels endured two discouraging hours Tuesday night in
front of 32,812 at Edison Field. On the field, they got stomped, with
Pedro Martinez personally pushing them out of first place in the
American League West. Martinez pitched eight shutout innings,
striking out nine, as Boston Red Sox beat the Angels, 6-0, and
dropped the home team one game behind the Seattle Mariners.</LD>
<TE>   During the game, the Red Sox and Oakland Athletics got better, and
the competition for a playoff berth got rougher. The Red Sox, one
game behind the Angels in the AL wild-card race, acquired slugger
Cliff Floyd. The A's, four games behind the Angels in the AL West,
acquired left-handed reliever Ricardo Rincon.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels did nothing off the field and did next to nothing on
the field, playing perhaps their worst defensive game of the season
on a night Martinez (14-2) dominated them at bat. The Angels had more
errors (three) than hits (two).</TE>
<TE>   While the Red Sox celebrated the arrival of Floyd, the Angels
awaited the dawn, and the deadline. In the Boston clubhouse, Martinez
called Floyd "a great addition" and Manager Grady Little said, "We're
glad to have him."</TE>
<TE>   Said Martinez of Floyd, who played for the 1997 World Series
champion Florida Marlins: "He's got his ring. Hopefully, he'll help
us get ours."</TE>
<TE>   Little was so happy that he could joke about where Floyd would
play for the Red Sox. "First, we'll have to see if he makes the
team," Little said.</TE>
<TE>   In the Angel clubhouse, Manager Mike Scioscia said he would
welcome some help but was almost defiant that the Angels could win if
they did not make a trade.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not intimidated by anything or any moves other clubs make,"
Scioscia said. "These guys are championship-caliber."</TE>
<TE>   Ramon Ortiz, who pitched a two-hitter in his only previous meeting
against his idol and Dominican countryman, did not fare nearly as
well this time.</TE>
<TE>   The early innings offered the hint of something special, as Ortiz
struck out two batters in the first, two more in the second and
another in the third.</TE>
<TE>   In the fourth inning, he gave up a home run to Jason Varitek, on a
high fastball. In the fifth and sixth innings, his defense betrayed
him.</TE>
<TE>   After Brian Daubach walked to start the fifth, Tony Clark hit a
ground ball to shortstop David Eckstein, a ready-made double-play
ball. But the ball clanked off Eckstein's glove for an error, so both
runners were safe and there were none out instead of two.</TE>
<TE>   "If I don't make that mistake, I don't think the other ones
happen," Eckstein said. "I think that was the key to the game."</TE>
<TE>   Rey Sanchez then grounded to third baseman Scott Spiezio, another
double-play ball. Spiezio, playing in place of Troy Glaus, threw to
second baseman Adam Kennedy for the first out, but first baseman Brad
Fullmer failed to backhand Kennedy's relay for another error.
Daubach, who had been holding at third, scored, and then the Red Sox
piled on.</TE>
<TE>   Johnny Damon doubled--3-0, Boston. Trot Nixon doubled--4-0,
Boston. Nomar Garciaparra doubled--5-0, Boston.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have to try to get six outs in one inning, that's going to
be tough for any pitcher," Scioscia said. "We should have been out of
that inning with no runs allowed."</TE>
<TE>   After Ortiz fought his way out of the fifth inning, his defense
faltered again in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Shea Hillenbrand popped up in foul ground near home, but catcher
Jose Molina dropped the ball for the Angels' third error. On the next
pitch, Hillenbrand homered.</TE>
<TE>   In his last seven starts, Ortiz has lost three and won one. After
pitching consecutive games without giving up a home run for the first
time this season, he gave up two Tuesday and has given up 30 this
year, most in the majors.</TE>

<HD>Stoneman's Not Desperate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sure, the Angels match up well this morning with the Seattle Mariners
and Oakland Athletics. But, with the Mariners and A's pursuing trades
before today's 1 p.m. deadline, the Angels might not match up so well
this afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels remain interested in acquiring a relief pitcher and/or
reserve outfielder, but General Manager Bill Stoneman insists the
Angels will be just fine if he cannot make a deal today, even if
Seattle's Pat Gillick and Oakland's Billy Beane can.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not too concerned," Stoneman said. "I can't control what
another club does. You can't operate with paranoia."</LD>
<TE>   Stoneman said that his trade options had "narrowed a bit" Tuesday
but said there were "still some possibilities." The A's Tuesday
acquired left-handed reliever Ricardo Rincon, a player in whom the
Angels had some interest.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have restricted their chances to make a trade because
of their refusal to surrender their top prospects and reluctance to
acquire a high-salaried player. At this point, they're looking for
the best player available in a modest deal, not looking to fill a
particular need.</TE>
<TE>   "It's obvious you'd like to add depth to the bullpen and add depth
on the offensive side," Manager Mike Scioscia said. "As far as
targeting one area, it depends what players you're talking about....
You'd like to get depth in a couple of areas, but that might not be
possible."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels pushed hard to acquire reliever Paul Shuey before he
was traded to the Dodgers on Sunday, and a baseball source said the
Angels recently discussed trading left-hander Scott Schoeneweis to a
National League club for a veteran left-handed reliever. But an
executive with another NL club, one willing to trade the veteran
reliever and extra outfielder that the Angels say they want, said
Tuesday he believed the Angels would stand pat.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have discussed promoting triple-A Salt Lake outfielder
Robb Quinlan, who leads the Pacific Coast League with a .345 batting
average and 89 runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   While the Angels' recent bullpen excellence has not dissuaded
Stoneman from searching for relief help, closer Troy Percival is
confident in the abilities of his bullpen mates.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how much better we can get down there," he said.
"The guys have done the jobs they're asked to do. I don't think we
have to strengthen that area.</TE>
<TE>   "We might be able to pick up a quality bench player or something,
but I'm pretty happy with the team we've got and the way we're
competing. It's a credit to what Bill did in the off-season."</TE>

<HD>Floyd Is Traded to Boston by Montreal</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cliff Floyd was traded for the second time in three weeks, with the
Montreal Expos sending the power-hitting outfielder to the Boston Red
Sox on Tuesday night for minor league pitchers Seung Jun Song and Sun
Woo Kim.</LD>
<LD>   Floyd, an All-Star last season, is eligible to become a free agent
at the end of the season. He is being paid $6.5 million this season.</LD>
<LD>   Floyd homered Tuesday night for the Expos, who acquired him from
Florida after the All-Star break.</LD>
<TE>   As part of the deal, Montreal also gets a player to be named.</TE>
<TE>   Floyd spent his first four seasons at Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Left-hander Ricardo Rincon was acquired by the Oakland Athletics
from the Cleveland Indians before the teams played Tuesday night at
Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   The Indians received minor league infielder Marshall McDougall in
the deal.</TE>
<TE>   The A's designated reliever Mike Magnante for assignment. He was
0-2 with a 5.97 earned-run average in 32 games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Negotiators for the baseball owners and players spent four hours
discussing revenue sharing and other bargaining issues without
reaching a resolution on any.</TE>
<TE>   On the key issue of revenue sharing, union lawyer Gene Orza said
that "in some respects, the conversation was productive. We got a
little closer, but there are still significant hurdles we have to
find a way to get through."</TE>
<TE>   It is believed that the union's executive board will hold a
conference call next week to discuss a strike date if there is no
bargaining agreement.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York Yankee right-hander Roger Clemens will test his injured
groin in another rehabilitation start, either Thursday at double-A
Norwich or Friday at Class-A Tampa.</TE>
<TE>   Yankee closer Mariano Rivera threw 30 times from 50 feet off flat
ground at Tampa, Fla., as he continues his recovery from a mild right
shoulder strain.</TE>
<TE>   Rivera is eligible to come off the 15-day disabled list in a week</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore Oriole right-hander Pat Hentgen, sidelined since
undergoing elbow replacement surgery last August, threw six innings
in a simulated game at the team's minor league complex at Sarasota,
Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Oriole Manager Mike Hargrove said Hentgen could make a minor
league rehab start in early August, and might join the team
afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore outfielder Jeff Conine, out since June 15 because of a
right hamstring strain, is taking batting practice and has started
running on a treadmill. The next step will be Conine doing running
drills in the field.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ted Williams' oldest daughter, who is fighting her half-siblings
over their father's body, said she will never waver from her belief
that the baseball star wanted to be cremated and not frozen.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to change my mind," Bobby-Jo Williams Ferrell told
Associated Press. "There's no way to reach a compromise. I want his
will to be followed."</TE>
<TE>   Ferrell and her half-siblings, John Henry Williams and Claudia
Williams, are battling in court over the final disposition of their
father, who was frozen at a Scottsdale, Ariz., cryogenics lab shortly
after his death July 5.</TE>
<TE>   Ted Williams' 1996 will says his body should be cremated and the
ashes scattered off the Florida coast, but Ferrell's half-siblings
say he signed a pact with them in November 2000, agreeing to be
cryogenically preserved so they could "be together" after they died.</TE>

<LD>With the help of a bigger strike zone, pitchers have regained control
of Major League Baseball, writes Thomas Boswell of the Washington
Post:</LD>
<LD>   "If Barry Bonds, with his 73 home runs, was the symbol of 2001,
then Curt Schilling with his 18-3 record is the symbol for 2002.</LD>
<LD>   "Here's one eye-catching statistic that captures the whole trend.
In 2000, only one starting pitcher in the American League had an
earned-run average under 3.70 [Boston's Pedro Martinez]. As of
Tuesday, there were 15 starters in the AL and 37 in both leagues in
that category.</LD>
<TE>   "This transformation has been enormous, as dramatic in its way as
the flood of home runs that preceded it. But baseball has had so many
other problems, controversies and distractions that the game itself
has been overlooked."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: How many work stoppages has Major League Baseball had
since 1972?</TE>
<TE>   Dead rivalry: Brian Schmitz of the Orlando Sentinel says the
Florida-Florida State football rivalry won't be the same after a
certain coach moved to the NFL:</TE>
<TE>   "It just won't have the same kick [or cheap shot, perhaps] without
the Gators' head jalapeno, Steve Spurrier. Unless, of course,
Spurrier joins Ted Williams on ice and comes back to needle Bobby
Bowden, who will still be coaching at age 135."</TE>
<TE>   Mob connection: James Gandolfini, who plays New Jersey mob boss
Tony Soprano on the HBO series "The Sopranos," has made his second
commercial for the struggling Rutgers football program.</TE>
<TE>   In the ad, Gandolfini, a 1983 Rutgers graduate, assures three
college pals they will have great seats for home games.</TE>
<TE>   "Close, real close," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Shooting gallery: John McClain of the Houston Chronicle, joining
others in calling Ryan Leaf the biggest bust in NFL history:</TE>
<TE>   "Leaf threw 14 touchdown passes, or [six] more than former running
back Walter Payton. Peyton Manning has thrown 111. And just imagine:
Leaf and Manning each got $11-million signing bonuses [in 1998]."</TE>
<TE>   Weighty issue: The Dallas Cowboys have 19 players on their
training-camp roster who weigh at least 300 pounds, including the
entire projected starting offensive line of tackles Solomon Page (6
feet 5, 325 pounds) and Flozell Adams (6-7, 357), guards Larry Allen
(6-3, 335) and Kelvin Garmon (6-2, 350) and rookie center Andre
Gurode (6-4, 326).</TE>
<TE>   Waiting in the wings are backup tackles Aaron Gibson (6-6, 410)
and Char-ron Dorsey (6-6, 388).</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1990, Nolan Ryan, 43, won his 300th
game as the Texas Rangers defeated the Milwaukee Brewers, 11-3.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Eight. That's more than the NFL, NBA and NHL
combined.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Chris Weinke longs for the day when his age won't be
an issue.</TE>
<TE>   But that's difficult today, considering the Carolina Panther
quarterback is turning 30 only a year after being an NFL rookie and
two years after winning the Heisman Trophy.</TE>
<TE>   "Age is just a number, it's just something in your mind," said
Weinke, who played pro baseball before attending Florida State. "They
say when you turn 30 is when you start to feel your age, but I feel
pretty good."</TE>

<HD>Clippers Say They Can't Pass It Up</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Trading Miles isn't easy, but Baylor
describes point guard Miller as 'the precise player we need.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Clippers finally got the man atop their most-wanted list Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Now, they expect point guard Andre Miller, the NBA's leader in
assists last season, to lead the former league joke into the playoffs
for the first time since 1996-97 and keep the team competitive for
years to come.</LD>
<LD>   "In Andre Miller, we are getting the precise player we need to
take our team to the next level," Clipper General Manager Elgin
Baylor said. "That made this decision easier to make."</LD>
<TE>   The Cleveland Cavaliers also seemed satisfied with a four-player
trade with the Clippers, which ended weeks of talks between the
teams. The Cavaliers hope Darius Miles fills seats at Gund Arena next
season, drumming up excitement for a moribund franchise with his
high-flying moves to the hoop.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the announcement was only a formality.</TE>
<TE>   Newspapers and radio and television stations in Los Angeles and
Cleveland had been reporting since Monday afternoon that the Clippers
would be sending Miles and backup forward Harold Jamison to the
Cavaliers for Miller and guard Bryant Stith.</TE>
<TE>   The Cavaliers held a formal news conference Tuesday afternoon in
Cleveland, with General Manager Jim Paxson saying, "Darius Miles was
the player we wanted in this deal. Sometimes you have to make bold
moves to get better in the future."</TE>
<TE>   Miles, who turns 21 in October, was in Vancouver, Canada, filming
a movie and was not immediately available for comment. Miles will
provide the rebuilding Cavaliers with a marquee player, which was
seen as a critical element in any deal for Miller.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, 26, was en route from Northern California on Tuesday and
is to be introduced to reporters at a news conference today at
Staples Center. Miller is a Los Angeles native who graduated from
Verbum Dei High.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff McInnis helped guide the Clippers to 31- and 39-victory
seasons in his two-year tenure at the point. But he often clashed
with teammates and Coach Alvin Gentry, particularly in the second
half of 2001-02. McInnis is an unrestricted free agent and will not
be re-signed by the Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   "Andre is a great player and a quiet leader," Gentry said in a
prepared statement. "He is very durable and with [his] style of play,
he will be able to push the basketball and distribute the ball to a
lot of very athletic players on our team."</TE>
<TE>   Miller averaged a league-leading 10.9 assists last season, passing
off to a cast of unproven and untested players. Miller also averaged
16.5 points, more than all the Clippers except power forward Elton
Brand, who averaged 18.2.</TE>
<TE>   With the Clippers, Miller will have an assortment of talented
young players to pass to, starting with Brand, a first-time All-Star
last season.</TE>
<TE>   Miller will join veteran shooting guard Eric Piatkowski in the
backcourt. He also will be paired a great deal with Quentin
Richardson, one of the best sixth men in the league last season.</TE>
<TE>   Up front, Miller will find Brand, center Michael Olowokandi and
small forward Lamar Odom, who is trying to rebound from a season
shortened by an eight-game drug suspension and season-ending ankle
and wrist injuries.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers sent the Cavaliers a potential superstar in Miles,
but the move was worth the gamble, according to Baylor.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always difficult to trade a very exciting and popular player
with potential such as Darius," he said. "The one thing that made
this [trade] both easier and exciting is that you are getting a
proven player in return who has established himself as one of the top
five point guards in the NBA."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers and Cavaliers almost struck a deal on draft night,
June 26, but talks broke down. The Clippers were said to be uneasy
about trading Miles or Odom, two of the cornerstones of their new and
improved team.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers also attempted to lure the New Orleans Hornets into
trade talks for point guard Baron Davis, a former standout at UCLA.
But the Hornets were not interested and on Tuesday announced they
were giving Davis a contract extension worth more than $80 million.</TE>
<TE>   Miller also is eligible for an extension like the one Davis
received. It was one of the reasons the budget-conscious Cavaliers
decided to trade Miller and revamp their roster during the
off-season.</TE>
<TE>   It's believed the Clippers and Miller's agent will put off
negotiations on a new deal until after the 2002-03 season is
completed. Brand, Odom and Corey Maggette also are eligible for
extensions this summer.</TE>

<TE>   Andre Miller, the NBA leader in assists last season, is considered
by many--including the Clippers--as the best pure point guard in the
league. A statistical look at Clipper point guards since the 1996-97

<HD>Ishii Quickly Out of Control</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: Reds knock out starter in the third inning on the
way to 12-4 victory. Giants catch L.A. in wild-card race.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CINCINNATI</DL>
<LD>The Dodgers still believe they are the team that was one of the major
leagues' biggest surprises in the first half, not the current
stumbling bunch trying to figure out how to get it back together.</LD>
<LD>   They didn't find any answers Tuesday night in a 12-4 blowout loss
to the Cincinnati Reds at Cinergy Field that prolonged their
post-All-Star game malaise. Starter Kazuhisa Ishii (12-7) was the
biggest of the Dodgers' many problems in the opener of a three-game
series before 23,804, struggling even more than usual with his
command and quickly taking his club out of the game.</LD>
<LD>   "The walks, the behind-in-the-count situations, it just
continually rolled over and rolled over," Manager Jim Tracy said.
"You look up, and they've got eight runs on the board in the first 2
2/3 innings of the game. The tone had been set, and it wasn't a good
one.</LD>
<TE>   "From that point on, it's a matter of getting through the
ballgame. We had some good at-bats, but it's something that really
kind of gets overlooked. By the time you start to get to that point,
you're already down 10-0."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii, the Dodgers' second most consistent pitcher recently behind
Hideo Nomo, lasted only 2 2/3 innings in his worst performance of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   He walked six and gave up two home runs among five hits and a
season-high eight earned runs.</TE>
<TE>   Leading, 3-0, after two innings, the Reds broke the game open in
the third with five runs--two scoring on catcher Paul Lo Duca's
passed ball and error. Cincinnati raced to a 10-0 lead in the fourth
after chasing Ishii, whose earned-run average ballooned from 3.36 to
3.87, and the Dodgers were well on their way to dropping to 3-4 on a
season-high 13-game, 15-day trip.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers (59-47) remained five games behind the first-place
Arizona Diamondbacks in the National League West, and fell into a tie
with the San Francisco Giants atop the NL wild-card standings.</TE>
<TE>   With a 5-13 record since the All-Star break, the Dodgers keep
hoping for things to turn but acknowledge action is overdue.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're going through something like we have as a team, and
struggled like we have in the second half, you have to say that it's
going to turn around," second baseman Mark Grudzielanek said. "You
have to keep thinking, 'Yeah, today is the day, and let's get it
going right here.' We believe that we can, but you just don't want to
wait for one thing to turn it around.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to start playing solid baseball overall and start
winning games. We haven't had a lot go right for us, in a lot of
areas, since the All-Star break. It's something we have to overcome,
and have to do it fairly quickly. It's getting to that point, no
question about it."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Shuey also had problems in his Dodger debut. Shuey, acquired
Sunday from the Cleveland Indians, gave up two hits and a run in the
eighth. Closer Eric Gagne relieved Shuey with two out after he walked
two to load the bases, and Jason La Rue struck out to end the Reds'
fun.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati, still in the wild-card hunt at 55-50, had 10 hits and
four home runs, including the 22nd by first baseman Adam Dunn.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like it was the first day of school," Shuey said. "I got
met in the parking lot and got hit by the bully."</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati starter Ryan Dempster (6-11) had some shaky moments as
the Dodgers scored three runs in the fifth to keep the crowd
interested for a bit longer, but the Reds gave him a big enough
comfort zone to overcome his problems. The former Florida Marlin ace,
acquired July 11, gave up nine hits and four runs in seven innings,
and the Dodgers were never really in the game.</TE>
<TE>   "He couldn't get in any kind of rhythm, and he didn't throw many
effective pitches," pitching coach Jim Colborn said of Ishii. "It's
not uncommon to watch him walk the first guy, but he put himself in
trouble every inning. He was really never a factor."</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Brown May Be Back Soon, but Not Dreifort</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jason Reid</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>CINCINNATI</DL>
<LD>The Dodgers received mixed news Tuesday about pitchers Kevin Brown
and Darren Dreifort, learning that Brown appears to be on the verge
of being activated but that Dreifort might be done for the season
after undergoing exploratory arthroscopic surgery on his right knee.</LD>
<LD>   The fast-healing Brown has exceeded expectations in recovering
from June 11 surgery for a herniated disk in his lower back,
prompting the Dodgers to schedule him to pitch Saturday for triple-A
Las Vegas against Memphis at Las Vegas. Manager Jim Tracy said the
right-hander is expected to make "in the neighborhood of 50 pitches,"
and General Manager Dan Evans said Brown would "definitely make a
subsequent rehab outing" regardless of his performance against
Memphis.</LD>
<LD>   Tracy and Evans were reluctant to discuss the club's plans for
Brown beyond the scheduled rehabilitation starts, declining to
speculate on a target date for his return to the 25-man roster.
However, they did not rule out Brown rejoining the club if things go
well.</LD>
<TE>   "He's making great strides," Tracy said. "His bullpen [session]
today, once again, was very good. His bullpen on Sunday was special.
You can't help but be encouraged by the things you're hearing about
this guy."</TE>
<TE>   The news on Dreifort was not encouraging.</TE>
<TE>   Dreifort, coming off reconstructive elbow surgery for the second
time in six years, underwent surgery for the third time on his right
knee, for minor cartilage damage, after results of an MRI exam were
inconclusive. Team physicians Frank Jobe and Ralph Gambardella
performed the procedure at the Kerlan-Jobe Clinic in Culver City.</TE>
<TE>   The nine-year veteran--in the second year of a five-year,
$55-million contract--sat out the 1995 season after having elbow
surgery for the first time, and surgery limited him to 16 starts last
season.</TE>
<TE>   Although Dreifort, 30, could resume throwing in about 10 days, it
is doubtful he would have enough time to rehabilitate from knee
surgery, complete his elbow rehabilitation and rejoin the club this
season.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's put it this way: I remain optimistic, but I'm not overly
optimistic," Tracy said. "I can't see where there is enough time left
on the calendar.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be an extreme push, and I don't think there's anyone in
the organization that's interested in pursuing that avenue. That's
just not something we want to do, but we just have to wait and see."</TE>
<TE>   Brown threw 90 pitches in three 30-pitch bullpen sessions Tuesday
at Dodger Stadium, and is expected to throw again Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "I want his teammates to know that, God forbid anything unforeseen
happening, he's going to be back," Tracy said. "I want the players to
have that big boost, because they deserve that big boost."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers acquired utility infielder Tyler Houston in part to
push underachieving third baseman Adrian Beltre.</TE>
<TE>   Although Beltre is only 23, other clubs believe he might be traded
in the off-season because the Dodgers' patience is running thin.</TE>
<TE>   Beltre, batting .247, is still an everyday player heading into the
stretch run, but Tracy said he doesn't have much rope left.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have any more time to sit around and observe three
horrific days in a row," he said. "We don't have any more time for
that, we're beyond that barrier, and that is on the record."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Evans has been busy heading into today's 1 p.m. PDT non-waiver
trading deadline, getting Houston from the Milwaukee Brewers and
setup man Paul Shuey from the Cleveland Indians, and continues to be
"in listening mode."</TE>
<TE>   "We met our objectives with [Houston and Shuey]," he said, "and I
don't see anything else being imminent at this point."</TE>
<TE>   But even if Evans does not complete another deal before this
deadline, he could still bolster the roster in time for the playoffs
with players who clear waivers.</TE>
<TE>   Players traded before Aug. 31 are eligible for postseason play
with their new clubs.</TE>
<TE>   "We would have to be overwhelmed to make another move right now,"
Evans said. "But [today] isn't the deadline to improve our club."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pitcher Odalis Perez, who received permission from the Dodgers to
travel home to the Dominican Republic to tend to a family matter,
rejoined the club in Cincinnati.</TE>

<HD>Augusta Gets Longer, Bighorn Ratings Smaller</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>They have fired up the bulldozers again at Augusta National.</LD>
<LD>   It's nothing like last year's extensive remodeling project, when
seven par-four holes and nine holes in all were altered to add nearly
300 yards, but Augusta is undergoing another course change.</LD>
<LD>   Work is continuing this week on the 435-yard par-four fifth hole,
which will wind up being lengthened about 20 yards when the tees are
moved back.</LD>
<TE>   But that's not all. The bunker complex on the left side is being
moved about 80 yards closer to the green and both the bunkers and the
fairway are being shifted slightly to the right to create even more
of a dogleg.</TE>
<TE>   For the players who stay left, it'll take a drive of 315 yards to
carry the bunkers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The overnight Nielsen rating for Monday's "Battle at Bighorn" on
ABC was 5.3, down for the second consecutive year.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus defeated Sergio Garcia and Lee
Trevino, 3 and 2, in a prime-time match-play event. The match
produced a 9 share, the lowest in the four-year history of the show.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's overnight rating for Woods-Annika Sorenstam and David
Duval-Karrie Webb was 5.9 and a 10 share, although it measured
slightly higher in the final national Nielsen rating, at 6.1 and an
11 share.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, when Woods lost to Garcia, the national rating was 7.6
and a 13 share.</TE>
<TE>   The first prime-time event, when Woods defeated Duval in 1999 at
Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks, drew a 6.9 rating and a 12
share.</TE>
<TE>   The overnight ratings measure the 53 largest television markets,
covering about 65% of the U.S.</TE>

<LD>A consumer's guide to the best and worst of sports media and
merchandise. Ground rules: If it can be read, heard, observed,

<LD>   What: SlamBall</LD>
<LD>   When: Saturdays at 8 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   TV: TNN</TE>
<TE>   This is not what Dr. James Naismith had in mind.</TE>
<TE>   The inventor of basketball did not dress his players in pads and
instruct them to body-check one another into boards surrounding the
court. He did not live long enough to see the 360-degree dunk.</TE>
<TE>   Surely he never imagined SlamBall.</TE>
<TE>   In this new version of the sport--part hoops, part
X-Games--trampolines are built into the floor under each basket so
offensive players can launch themselves twisting and spinning above
the rim. On defense, a man called the "stopper" is allowed to
goaltend and/or smack his opponent out of the way, anything to
prevent a dunk.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really a hybrid," Mike Tollin said. "It looks like
hockey.... It's like football.... There are some gymnastics."</TE>
<TE>   Tollin and his partner, Brian Robbins, both avid sports fans, are
the producers of the HBO series "Arliss" and the baseball movie
"Hardball," as well as more conventional entertainment such as the WB
Network's "Smallville." In this case, they have developed an idea
brought to them by a former office intern, Mason Gordon.</TE>
<TE>   "He comes in with this diagram on a napkin," Tollin said.
"Trampolines, basketball, full contact. We laughed."</TE>
<TE>   Gordon persisted and the resulting made-for-television tournament
will air Saturday nights on TNN. Former Philadelphia 76er president
Pat Croce has signed on as an advisor and there are plans for a
full-fledged league as well as SlamBall venues in parks nationwide.
Tollin knows that purists might cringe.</TE>
<TE>   "We want those people who are scratching their heads," he said.
"It's important for us to prove we're a real sport."</TE>

<LD>If recent history holds up, trainer Bob Baffert will win today's
$125,000 Graduation Stakes, an ungraded sprint restricted to
2-year-olds bred in California.</LD>
<LD>   Icecoldbeeratreds, a son of In Excess owned and bred by Mike
Pegram, will try to follow the footsteps of Arabian Light and
Officer, who won for Baffert in 2000 and 2001, respectively. Officer,
by the way, also went on to become the trainer's sixth consecutive
winner in the Del Mar Futurity.</LD>
<LD>   Out of the Crafty Prospector mare Guilded Times,
Icecoldbeeratreds, named for an establishment across the street from
Del Mar, hasn't run since winning his debut on April 27 at Hollywood
Park.</LD>
<TE>   The 11-10 favorite that day, he cruised to a three-length victory
in 52 1/5 seconds for the 4 1/2 furlongs. Expression, who finished
four lengths behind him, was a next-out winner, beating, among
others, eventual Hollywood Juvenile winner Crowned Dancer. Expression
is also in the Graduation field and will be running for the first
time since his victory on May 8.</TE>
<TE>   On the strength of his 11-length maiden victory on June 30 in
Inglewood, Jury Box is the favorite on Jeff Tufts' morning line.
Recently purchased by Clint and Susan Atkins, the In Excess colt
remains in the care of trainer Wayne Lukas. After losing his first
three starts at 7-10, 7-5 and 2-1, Jury Box added Lasix in his last
and rolled home in 1:03 2/5 for the 5 1/2 furlongs, which is also the
distance of the Graduation. Lukas will be seeking his first victory
in the race since Rally Run scored in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Tizbud, Tiznow's brother, will make his first
start around two turns in today's third, the first leg of the pick
six. The 3-year-old was third in his six-furlong debut and
Brownstone, the runner-up in that contest, easily won Monday's first.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Jerry Bailey. So, what else is new? He won 15 races
during the first six days of Saratoga, including stakes victories
over the weekend with Tates Creek, You and Dancethruthedawn.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Dr. Litin. A $2.5-million purchase in 2000, the son of
Broad Brush out of the 1988 Kentucky Derby winner Winning Colors has
been a bust in two career starts. He has finished fourth and sixth
and will try again in today's third at Del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A trifecta keying Noble Masterpiece in the
fifth with Pickled Bay, Sterling Wisdom and Groom On The Run in the
two hole and all in the third spot.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 1/10. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $3.40/$70.60. Total money bet: $104.</TE>

<HD>Davis Stays a Hornet With $84-Million Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Point guard Baron Davis is staying with the Hornets after all,
finally signing a contract extension with the team that moved to New
Orleans this off-season.</LD>
<LD>   Bob Bass, Hornet executive vice president, said Tuesday the
contract adds six years to the one year left on Davis' previous deal.</LD>
<LD>   The team, which recently moved from Charlotte, reportedly had
offered Davis an $84-million package. While not confirming the
compensation details, Bass said Davis would earn an annual salary
equal to about 25% of the NBA team salary cap. The cap is $40.271
million for the 2002-03 season and is adjusted annually.</LD>
<TE>   The Hornets first made the offer to Davis on July 1, but for more
than three weeks he remained undecided. He was rumored in possible
trades to the Clippers and New York Knicks. However, Bass remained
firm that he had no intention of trading Davis.</TE>
<TE>   At Tuesday's news conference, Davis said he decided to stay with
the Hornets because he did not want to start over again on a new
team.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not greedy, I'm not selfish, I just wanted to make the right
decision. This was the biggest decision I've had to make in my life,"
he said. "It's been a long, tough process."</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who averaged 18.1 points, 8.5 assists and 4.3 rebounds last
season, is the first player in the Hornets' 14-year history that they
have offered a maximum money contract extension.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dallas Mavericks re-signed forward-center Raef LaFrentz to a
seven-year, $67-million contract, making sure they keep the player
with the outside touch that they acquired at the trade deadline last
season.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the place to be," LaFrentz, 26, said. "This is the team
of the future. Last year we fell short of our long-term goal. But
we're young and going to have a large window. I feel good to be a
part of it."</TE>
<TE>   In 27 regular-season games with Dallas, the 6-foot-11, 265-pound
LaFrentz averaged 10.8 points, down from 14.9 in 51 games with the
Denver Nuggets. His rebound average of 7.4 was the same with both
teams.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Free-agent center Keon Clark was cited for marijuana possession in
Danville, Ill., and must appear in court next month.</TE>
<TE>   Clark, 27, was ticketed at 10:50 p.m. on Sunday for having about a
gram of marijuana in his car, city attorney David Wesner said. Clark,
formerly of the Toronto Raptors, was not arrested.</TE>
<TE>   He will appear in Danville Municipal Court on Aug. 22, and if
found guilty, Clark could be fined between $250 and $1,500.</TE>
<TE>   Wesner said Clark was cited about two years ago for a similar
offense.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal has worked out a deal of nearly $100
million to buy housing intended for thousands of lower-income
Colorado residents.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal is a general partner with American Housing Preservation
Corp. of Portland, Maine, to buy 21 communities from Greenwood
Village, Colo.-based Urban Inc., an investor and developer of
affordable housing.</TE>
<TE>   The communities are in Denver, Pueblo, Buena Vista, Fort Lupton
and Canon City.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal and his uncle and business manager Mike Parris began
investing in real estate about four years ago in New Jersey, where
O'Neal lived in the projects before his father joined the Army.</TE>
<TE>   "We started buying homes out of foreclosure and paying $10,000 or
$12,000 for them, fixing them up, and maybe selling them for $25,000
or $35,000," O'Neal said.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be easy for me to develop a housing community around a
golf course or buy strip malls, but that's not how I want my book to
go."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Center DeSagana Diop, the Cleveland Cavaliers' first-round draft
pick last year, had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee. He is
expected to be ready for training camp.</TE>

night in the first round of the Toronto Masters Series.</LD>

timely delivery. Sampras finished with 23 aces.</LD>

the NFL because of alleged juror misconduct during last year's trial
in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Richard Hubbell, who presided over that

<TE>   Kansas City offensive lineman John Tait was led off the field at
River Falls, Wis., after being cut during a fight with rookie
defensive end Eddie Freeman.... Chief tight end Tony Gonzalez had a
phone conversation with team President Carl Peterson but remains a
no-show at training camp. The impasse started over money, but has
escalated into Peterson's demand that Gonzalez give up his pursuit of
a career in basketball.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego General Manager John Butler said he'll continue to run
the Chargers while battling lung cancer.... New York Jet quarterback
Vinny Testaverde banged his right thumb on a teammate's helmet and

<HD>Lofton Makes a Powerful Impression</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kenny Lofton used his power instead of his speed to impress his new
team.</LD>
<LD>   Lofton homered in his first at-bat with San Francisco and Kirk
Rueter pitched six strong innings to lead the Giants over the
Phillies, 10-3, Tuesday night at Philadelphia.</LD>
<LD>   Lofton, acquired Sunday from the Chicago White Sox for two minor
leaguers, hit the second pitch of the game from rookie Brett Myers
(1-1) over the left-center-field wall for his 24th career leadoff
homer.</LD>
<TE>   The six-time All-Star tripled in the sixth inning. He finished two
for four with two runs scored.</TE>
<TE>   "It was nice to get my first hit out of the way. I thought it
would hit the wall, but it kept carrying," Lofton said of his homer.
"It was fun, it was exciting, I'm glad I did my part."</TE>
<TE>   Rueter (9-6) gave up two runs and seven hits to win his second
consecutive start after eight winless outings.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants, who tied the Dodgers for the National League wild-card
lead, played without injured left fielder Barry Bonds for the 10th
consecutive game. Bonds, sidelined by a hamstring injury, took
batting practice but isn't expected to play in the series.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got some sock," Giant Manager Dusty Baker said of Lofton.
"We needed to get going against a guy we've never seen."</TE>
<TE>   Rueter improved to 6-2 on the road. He's 3-4 at Pacific Bell Park.</TE>
<TE>   "I do the same stuff at home," Rueter said, unable to explain his
road success.</TE>
<TE>   Placido Polanco, acquired in the five-player trade that sent Scott
Rolen to St. Louis on Monday, was one for four in his Phillie debut.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 5, Florida 0--Andy Benes won for the first time in
nearly a year, Edgar Renteria homered twice and Scott Rolen hit a
run-scoring triple in his Cardinal debut at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Benes (1-3), still battling arthritis in his right knee, gave up
four hits in a season-high 6 1/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Renteria hit solo home runs against Michael Tejera (6-4) in the
fifth and seventh innings for the third multihomer game of his
career.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 5, Arizona 4--Vladimir Guerrero homered against
Byung-Hyun Kim (4-2) in the 10th inning at Montreal and the Expos
ended the Diamondbacks' season-high seven-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   After the Expos gave up an unearned run with two out in the eighth
to blow a 4-3 lead, Guerrero hit his 27th homer to win it.</TE>
<TE>   Cliff Floyd homered for Montreal just before being traded to
Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 4, Colorado 1--Kris Benson (4-5) gave up three hits
over eight innings at Pittsburgh and the Pirates extended the
Rockies' winless streak to seven games.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Young's bases-loaded walk forced in the go-ahead run, and
Adam Hyzdu had a two-run double in a three-run eighth inning.</TE>
<TE>   The Pirates ended a six-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Benson, who returned in May from an 18-month layoff for
reconstructive elbow surgery, hadn't pitched longer than seven
innings since his return.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 16, New York 3--Geoff Blum drove in five runs with four
hits at New York and the Astros tied a season high with 20 hits.</TE>
<TE>   Blum hit a home run, a triple and two singles. His four hits and
five runs batted in tied career highs.</TE>
<TE>   Houston's Brad Ausmus tied a career high with four hits, including
a homer.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 3, Milwaukee 2--Damian Moss gave up two hits over seven
innings at Atlanta, and Gary Sheffield doubled in two runs in a
three-run sixth that helped the Braves end the Brewers' four-game
winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Moss (7-4) has won three in a row, giving up only one earned run
in his last 20 innings. He did not give up a hit after Jose Hernandez
led off the second with a solo home run.</TE>
<TE>   John Smoltz earned his 39th save, matching the Atlanta record set
in 1996 by Mark Wohlers. It was his 25th consecutive save, a club
record.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 6, Chicago 5--Tom Lampkin tied the score with a
seventh-inning home run and singled in the go-ahead run in the eighth
at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Bubba Trammell homered for the Padres, who overcame Sammy Sosa's
32nd homer and ended a four-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Holtz (2-1) pitched two innings, and Trevor Hoffman got three
outs for his 25th save in 26 chances, sending the Cubs to their sixth
loss in seven games.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Prior, a San Diego native and an All-American at USC, faced
his hometown team for the first time and struck out 10. The rookie
left after Brian Buchanan's line drive hit his right leg in the
seventh inning.</TE>

<LD>Adam Virs and Geoff Brack of Ventura and Brett Simpson and Andy
Hobson of Huntington Beach each won sixth-round heats in chest- to
head-high wave conditions Tuesday at the Philips U.S. Open of Surfing
in Huntington Beach.</LD>
<LD>   Virs, 23, had the best ride of the day and matched the highest
wave score of the event, earning a 9.17 from judges after a
two-second tube ride to advance to Thursday's round of 128. Former
U.S. surfing champion Dino Andino, 33, of San Clemente was eliminated
when Josh Montgomery of Carlsbad scored a 6.43 with seconds remaining
to take the heat's final qualifying spot. Travis Mellem of San
Clemente also failed to advance by one position, but later
transferred to the junior division.</LD>
<LD>   Pat Gadauskas and Benji Severson of San Clemente, Brandon Tipton
of Huntington Beach and Carl Holm of Morro Bay each won his
fifth-round heat and will compete today in the second half of the

<HD>Edison Is Wrong Place to Look for Angel Fans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I had a choice Tuesday night: Either go to an Angel-Red Sox game in
Edison Field, or a Spark-Sol contest in Staples Center. For most
people that wouldn't be a very tough decision because no one goes to
Angel games.</LD>
<LD>   But I was curious to know why the Angels have remained competitive
at this late date, so I passed on the thrills and chills of the WNBA,
and unless our e-mail system breaks down, I'll probably live to
regret it.</LD>
<LD>   I was surprised to find people sitting in the ballpark when I
arrived. At one point the fans got so loud I had to look up from my
plate of chocolate chip cookies to see which Angel had hit a homer,
only to catch Boston's Jason Varitek circling the bases.</LD>
<TE>   I could see Dodger fans getting tired of waiting for one of their
guys to hit a homer and start rooting for the other team, but I was
under the impression the Angels were doing well. Yet Edison Field
sounded more like Fenway Park. I guess that's why there was a crowd
here for the game--the Red Sox were pitching Pedro Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   Take away Red Sox fans, Dodger followers who wanted to dream of
superstars lost, and those who came just to see the Rally Monkey, and
I really don't know if there were any Angel fans in attendance.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I KEPT waiting for a halftime score on the Edison Field scoreboard
for the Spark-Sol game, but it never came. It was nerve-racking.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ON MY last visit to Edison Field, the Dodgers were playing the
Angels in front of a bunch of Dodger fans, and before the game
Manager Jim Tracy chastised reporters for misjudging his team and not
giving him and the front office credit for assembling such a
powerhouse. I took that speech to heart, of course, and followed the
Blue all the way to San Diego and San Francisco until the choking
dogs were put down.</TE>
<TE>   In fact I did some arithmetic, and since Tracy's "I told you so"
rant, the Dodgers have compiled a 9-18 record. I don't recall
anything Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said that day. In fact I'm not
sure he has ever said anything memorable.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, however, are 18-9 since Tracy popped off, and they're
still hanging with the Mariners, proving a manager should probably
just shut up.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I ASKED Tim Mead, the Angels' PR whiz, and you have to be a whiz
to get anyone to pay attention to this team, for a Sparks' update.
The Sol had the lead--I was afraid there might be a Sparks' letdown
if I didn't show up.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE ANGELS were losing, 5-0, in the fifth, just the way I was told
the comeback kids like it. Reporters asked Scioscia before the game
about the comeback Angels, but I don't recall a thing he said.</TE>
<TE>   It's 6-0 now in favor of the Red Sox, and unless that was some
woman wearing a fur hat on her head, I swore I saw the Rally Monkey
leaving the park before the start of the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   We both probably had the same thing in mind--getting home in time
to catch the Sparks' highlights ... Oh my gosh, the office just
called to tell me Lisa Leslie dunked. I sure hope they came back to
win.</TE>
<TE>   I missed WNBA history--that will teach me to go to an Angel game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE WAY new Dodger reliever Paul Shuey got hit, it might be time
to bring back Terry Mulholland--already 1-0 for Cleveland. The
Dodgers needed Eric Gagne to come in with the bases loaded to get the
last out, and preserve a 12-4 loss.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   BROADCASTER LARRY King left a message on my answering machine to
say I made a mistake in Tuesday's column, pointing out that if Ryan
Leaf had won a $1 trifecta wager at Del Mar for $546.40, he would
have been required to sign an IRS statement because it exceeded $300.
He said a winner is required to sign if the payoff is 300 times the
wager. I had incorrectly reported Leaf would have to sign with a
payoff of more than $600, and had referred to him as a big loser.</TE>
<TE>   I would like to thank Larry King for pointing out that I'm the
real loser--never winning a $1 bet that required an IRS signature.
Larry, how about calling some time with a tip on a winning horse?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE TV ratings for the Battle at Bighorn were lower than last
year, which makes me believe viewers still thought Annika Sorenstam
and Karrie Webb were going to be playing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TROY GLAUS was on the bench for Tuesday's big game.</TE>
<TE>   "He took batting practice and hit with great rhythm for about 25
minutes," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   If he was hitting with great rhythm, I asked, why not play him?
Scioscia said that was a good question, but failed to come up with a
good answer, saying he wanted to rest Glaus--presumably from the
strain of taking 25 minutes of batting practice.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Brianne Evans:</TE>
<TE>   "I hope your wife and any female children you have (provided you
didn't kill or abort them after finding out they were female)
continue to try and give you some sort of balance in your
misogynistic life. Your comments about the Bighorn golf tournament of
last year, and the poor play of Sorenstam and Webb failed to mention
the equally, if not more horrific play of Tiger Woods and David
Duval. Watching Annika shoot a 59 is exciting. Watching Juli Inkster
come from two shots behind Annika to win the U.S. Women's Open is
amazing golf. But someone like yourself, a sexist chauvinist pig,
could never appreciate that because you just think women should be
pregnant and making you a big fat meal in the kitchen."</TE>
<TE>   I'm more thoughtful than you'd think: I take the wife out to
dinner all the time--that way she doesn't have to wash the dishes.</TE>

<HD>Best Listed as Stable After Liver Transplant</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>George Best, one of international soccer's most illustrious players
and notorious playboys, was listed in stable condition at a London
hospital Tuesday night after undergoing a 10-hour liver-transplant
operation.</LD>
<LD>   The former Manchester United and Northern Ireland star, who was
Europe's player of the year in 1968, was in the intensive care ward
of Cromwell Hospital.</LD>
<LD>   "The operation has proceeded satisfactorily and, after some
initial worries, his condition has substantially improved," a
hospital spokesman said of the 56-year-old Best.</LD>
<TE>   Alcohol abuse had seriously damaged Best's health, and he was
warned in March 2000, after collapsing because of severe liver
damage, that one more drink could kill him.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, he was given stomach implants intended to make him
nauseated if he consumed any alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   Best, now a television soccer analyst, spent 10 years with
Manchester United after joining the club at 16, straight off the
streets of his native Belfast, Northern Ireland.</TE>
<TE>   His off-the-field exploits made him daily fodder for the English
tabloids, which readily dubbed him "the fifth Beatle."</TE>
<TE>   Brazil to Host Paraguay</TE>
<TE>   Brazil's first match as the new world champion will be against
Paraguay in Fortaleza, Brazil, on Aug. 21, the Brazilian soccer
federation (CBF) announced.</TE>
<TE>   The CBF added that Coach Luiz Felipe Scolari will be in charge of
the team, even though Scolari has yet to decide whether to remain its
coach.</TE>
<TE>   Athens 2004 First Look</TE>
<TE>   Glenn "Mooch" Myernick, assistant coach on the U.S. World Cup
team, will coach the U.S. under-23 national team on a four-game tour
of England starting Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Myernick selected 20 players. The U.S. will play the reserve sides
of four professional teams: Bolton Wanderers on Thursday,

<HD>A Grand Slam at Staples</HD>
<DH>Basketball: Leslie is first woman to dunk in pro game, but
moment 'messed up' as Sparks lose to Miami, 82-73.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a piece of history, swathed in frustration.</LD>
<LD>   It was a moment so long awaited, it seemed it couldn't live up to
the anticipation, but it did.</LD>
<LD>   Lisa Leslie became the first woman to dunk in a professional game
Tuesday, slamming home a one-handed jam off a fastbreak late in the
first half.</LD>
<TE>   That it was her only basket of the half in the Sparks' sloppy
82-73 loss to the Miami Sol was a sore spot.</TE>
<TE>   But the highlight will long outlive the loss, even if it trimmed
the Sparks' lead over Houston in the Western Conference race to one
game.</TE>
<TE>   "I told the ladies they really messed up history," Coach Michael
Cooper said.</TE>
<TE>   Women have dunked in college games and all-star contests, in
practices and warmups, but until Leslie took Latasha Byears' outlet
pass off a rebound, took a couple of dribbles and slammed it home, no
woman had ever dunked in a professional game, though Leslie and
others had tried.</TE>
<TE>   (The first woman to dunk in a college game was 6-foot-7 Georgeann
Wells of West Virginia, in 1984. Wells did it twice. Few have
followed. Charlotte Smith of North Carolina--a 6-foot leaper--had a
one-handed dunk in 1994, and 6-5 Michelle Snow dunked three times
during her career at Tennessee).</TE>
<TE>   The professional honors go to Leslie.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just such a blessing. My life has been almost like a
storybook," Leslie said. "I don't know what to say other than
finally, I got the dunk, and I'm the first to do it. All the hoopla
about it, everybody else will be second.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been so much pressure and talk about it around the
All-Star game, and finally the situation came, I don't even know
how," Leslie said. "I just turned around and I was free and I said,
'Oh my God, I'm going to go for it.' "</TE>
<TE>   The crowd of 13,141 at Staples Center understood the moment,
launching into a raucous celebration that was still going when the
timeout that followed her dunk with 4:44 remaining was over.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie's teammates were as much a part of it as the fans.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone's been holding their breath for a while," DeLisha Milton
said. "We were just anticipating the moment when it was going to
happen. When it finally did, it was spectacular. She didn't let us
down one bit.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a clean dunk. They can't say anything about it. They can't
say, 'Oh, she threw it in, or it slipped out of her hand.' No, she
put it down, plain and simple.</TE>
<TE>   "Give her all the credit--and all the endorsement deals. I'm her
new agent."</TE>
<TE>   Leslie laughed, but it meant something to her too that the dunk
came in the heat of a hotly contested game, with guard Betty Lennox
on her heels--and room to spare above the rim.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a good dunk," Leslie said. "It was hard enough. I thought
it was valid--a nice dunk. I was just really excited. Unfortunately
we lost the game."</TE>
<TE>   Leslie scored 11 points in the second half to finish with 13, but
the Sparks (20-5) couldn't make it all the way back. Mwadi Mabika led
the Sparks with 17 points.</TE>
<TE>   Sheri Sam scored 18 for Miami, and Lennox added 17 in a game the
Sol (12-14) led by as many as 19 points.</TE>
<TE>   Ann Meyers Drysdale, the pioneering women's player who worked the
game as a broadcaster, appreciated the moment.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a kid eating candy, who gets too much and gets a
toothache. That's the NBA," Meyers Drysdale said of the dunk. "But
when you don't get enough, how exciting was that?</TE>
<TE>   "You'll see more, but it's not going to be commonplace. You'll see
a lot more try, though."</TE>
<TE>   Including Leslie.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel really good about it," she said. "If the opportunity comes
again, I'll do it again."</TE>

<HD>Nothing Ugly About Her Win</HD>
<DH>Commentary: Kournikova, dressed for success, has no trouble
eliminating Stevenson in the first round, 6-0, 6-1.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL DWYRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CARLSBAD</DL>
<LD>A sellout crowd of 6,500, approximately 87.2% of it male, watched
Anna Kournikova dismantle Alexandra Stevenson in a first-round match
of the Acura Classic tennis tournament Tuesday night, 6-0, 6-1, in 47
minutes.</LD>
<LD>   "It probably took her longer to get dressed," wisecracked one
sportswriter, a female no less.</LD>
<LD>   And so it goes in the world of Anna, the Russian rave who appears
on magazine covers more often than President Bush and whose
endorsement earnings make her tennis winnings look like chump change.</LD>
<TE>   Just because she hasn't won a tournament in her first 112 tries
and hasn't advanced as far as the semifinals of a Grand Slam event
since 1997, the cynical press continues to stalk her with negativity.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the kind of result she had against Stevenson, ranked 24
notches above her at No. 30, the skeptics with the keyboards give her
no slack, going for the cheap lines that deal with looks and sex
appeal, rather than serves and volleys. It is the shallow, uninformed
types, some of whom write Page 2 columns for major metro sports
sections and who wouldn't know a foot fault from a foot fetish, who
relish the opportunity to make light of Kournikova's tennis skills
while tossing out sexist one-liners.</TE>
<TE>   Those are the types who would, when writing about Kournikova's win
here, focus on such things as her cute teal-and-white outfit, with
matching teal visor. Or the long blond braided ponytail that bounced
gracefully through the air as she glided gracefully from side to side
along the baseline. Or the bare midriff and tiny teal skirt that came
into play once the warmup outfit came off and the match began.</TE>
<TE>   It is those kinds of details that always seemed to be stressed,
along with the signs held up in the stands by groups of panting males
that say: "Marry Me, Anna." Nor will these types of writers fail to
report the plaintiff cries that emanate from groups of males in the
upper deck as Kournikova waves to leave the court after matches,
cries of "We love you, Anna."</TE>
<TE>   Those who would prolong the negativity would babble on about long
legs and blue eyes and things that have absolutely no bearing on how
well a first serve kicks or a topspin forehand bites. No, with these
people, there is no sense for the societal significance of
Kournikova's tennis, no sense for the international appeal of her
cross-court backhand.</TE>
<TE>   She spoke afterward of a recent injury to her stomach muscle, and
that brought sexist comments in the press room about the
impossibility of anything attached to her being the least bit in need
of repair.</TE>
<TE>   So, what is needed is some straight reporting. Such as:</TE>
<TE>   Kournikova got her first serve in an incredible 91% of the time.
Stevenson, a big server playing in front of a hometown crowd, never
held serve, mostly because Kournikova returned so well.</TE>
<TE>   Kournikova had 16 winners and forced Stevenson into 21 errors.</TE>
<TE>   Kournikova won 53 points, Stevenson 30.</TE>
<TE>   The only game Kournikova lost was in the second set, 37 minutes
into the match, on her own serve at 3-0. "It was my fault. I made
four errors," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Kournikova had nine break-point chances and converted seven. She
approached the net 13 times and won the point on nine of those.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Kournikova said she played "almost perfect." Stevenson
said her "pride was hurt."</TE>
<TE>   In the late match, veteran Conchita Martinez beat Elena
Likhoutseva in three sets, 6-2, 6-7 (2), 6-2.</TE>
<TE>   About that, the cynical press would trot out another cheap line.
It would say that the attendance for that match was 352,
approximately 4.2% of it male.</TE>

<HD>Harkleroad, 17, Is Given a Lesson</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL DWYRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CARLSBAD</DL>
<LD>Jennifer Capriati and several thousand fans at the Acura Classic got
a look at the possible future of American women's tennis Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Granted, it wasn't a long look. Young Ashley Harkleroad, 17, was
dispatched by the veteran Capriati, seeded second in this event and
ranked No. 3 in the world, in a 53-minute instructional session, 6-0,
6-3.</LD>
<LD>   Harkleroad grew up in the South, lives in Miami and turned pro two
years and about $60,000 in prize money ago. Tournament organizers
obviously thought she would have an appeal, and she repaid the
wild-card entry they gave her, despite her low ranking of No. 228, by
posting a first-round upset Monday over Italian veteran Rita Grande.</LD>
<TE>   For Capriati, of course, Harkleroad was just so much cannon
fodder, and even Harkleroad's 3-1, 40-15 lead in the second set was
dismissed afterward by Capriati as a temporary lapse in
concentration.</TE>
<TE>   But the similarity in the two players' games, minus the veteran
savvy on big points that Harkleroad has yet to acquire, was striking.
Harkleroad banged from the baseline with great pace, moved with
smooth quickness and created nice angles off her two-handed backhand.
A 17-year-old Capriati did that too, only much better, even back
then.</TE>
<TE>   Harkleroad may never get to Capriati's level, which has brought
her to the No. 1 ranking in the world several times and three Grand
Slam event titles. But she certainly got a look Tuesday at what it
takes.</TE>
<TE>   "She started out hitting so hard, hitting winners from all over
the court," Harkleroad said. "I practiced with her a couple of times
at Saddlebrook [in Florida], but she missed a lot more in practice
than she did today."</TE>
<TE>   Harkleroad said she didn't feel as if she choked when she got her
second-set lead.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't play bad points there," she said. "She just brought her
game up a level, which is what you do when you are her."</TE>
<TE>   In the match, Capriati had 30 winners, Harkleroad five.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Capriati was part of an emotional ceremony on center court after
her match.</TE>
<TE>   Tournament officials here, having given recovering cancer patient
Corina Morariu a wild-card entry into this event for a doubles match
Monday that marked her first tour appearance in 14 months, created
the inaugural Acura Classic Comeback Award and presented it to
Morariu.</TE>
<TE>   Making the presentation, along with tournament director Jane
Stratton, was Capriati, who held up a sign after her 2001 French Open
win that wished Morariu a return to good health.</TE>
<TE>   Capriati, who was off the tour for parts of five years in the
mid-1990s after struggling with behavior problems and getting in
trouble for shoplifting and drugs, told Morariu that this award was
coming "from one comeback person to another."</TE>
<TE>   Capriati also said, "What you've done is far more difficult than
what I did."</TE>
<TE>   Morariu, saying she was responding by "speaking through my tears,"
said that she remained overwhelmed by the support she has received
from both fellow players and the fans.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Three of the top players in the tournament will finally take to
the courts today, with top-seeded Venus Williams in the night match
and No. 3 Lindsay Davenport and No. 5 Kim Clijsters playing in day
sessions.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   An attendance of about 400 is expected here Thursday night for the
annual Silver Lining Ranch dinner, a fund-raiser for Andrea Jaeger's
children's cancer charity program. Last year's Acura-backed event
raised $205,000.</TE>

<HD>Stuff of Legends Is More Than Stuffed Shirts</HD>
<DH>Where are the leaders to fulfill the promise of California?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I believe in myths, or I want to--the myths of our nation and, in
particular, the dauntless sagas of the West. It seems to me that a
culture without legends, without ballads to sing to itself, without a
dash of romance packed away in its attic, is impoverished in the
worst of ways.</LD>
<LD>   No doubt that's why I was drawn to California. I cut my
journalistic teeth here. This is the place where you either
appreciate the fantastic or you wear rubber boots because California
is knee-deep in it. So it has always seemed to me.</LD>
<LD>   Just plunge into the latest installment in Kevin Starr's vivid
history of California, "Embattled Dreams." It covers the decade from
1940 to 1950, when modern California was forged out of the sheet
metal and sweat of wartime.</LD>
<TE>   California's state librarian and a scholar at large, Starr has the
touch of a novelist, and he renders history as a story, not as a
theory. His California is populated by zoot-suiters, cinema
celebrities, women on the factory line, black Americans biting into
the ripening fruits of progress, Okies making good and the transiting
legions of fighting men who promise themselves a fresh start in the
sunshine, if only they live long enough. Plus various Red-baiters,
reactionaries, a ghostly murderer and a towering political leader
named Gov. Earl Warren.</TE>
<TE>   "Embattled Dreams" is on my mind because the past is our best
gauge to measure the present. Where are we in relation to where we
aim to go? Just how are the legends faring now?</TE>
<TE>   Comparing then to today, it seems fair to generalize and say that
the pathways to personal riches, to contentment, even to
enlightenment, remain wide open, if no less capricious. You can still
strike gold here in the strangest of places, whether you want to be a
Hollywood star, a surf bum or a cheese maker. In other words, the
myth, at least as sized to the individual, is alive and kicking.</TE>
<TE>   But not so our collective legends, the dreams and responsibilities
we hold jointly: the "good life" we share beyond our front step. What
puzzles me about today's California, the thing I find most
insufferable, is that progress usually means the opposite of
progressive. To borrow from another Western writer, Irving Stone,
where are the men and women to match our mountains?</TE>
<TE>   Every time I merge onto a freeway to find myself at a standstill,
every time I think of our seashore foaming with effluvia, I realize
how far we must go to reach the summit of our challenges. Yet those
who claim leadership risk hardly an upward glance. The mayor of our
largest city, the boy-with-his-father's-name, is not only uninspired
but proud of it. Our governor is an unctuous adding machine stuck at
50%-plus-1--the election margin he needs to keep office. The
candidate challenging him in the November election is a fingerling
caught in an outgoing tide, a man who mistook his inherited wealth
and corporate contacts for natural ability. Grass-roots activists,
meanwhile, borrow from the Balkans and seek to break Los Angeles into
rival enclaves.</TE>
<TE>   Look at just one challenge, transportation. Southern Californians
waste an average of 3 1/2 workweeks each year in traffic, more than
many of them receive in vacation. In Sacramento, they'll tell you
they have a transportation plan for us. Yes, and with it, the experts
say, we must expect our congestion, already the worst in the nation,
to get more frightful. Meanwhile, the state is balancing its budget
on cigarette futures and we feel lucky if the lights stay on all
summer.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps you say that leaders merely reflect the era in which they
live. By that thinking, we have only ourselves to blame for this
malaise. Which is true, at least in part. The contempt we have for
our politicians (see example above) is matched by their determination
to manipulate us and pander to us, a slow death spiral.</TE>
<TE>   Income disparity continues to thin out and weaken the center of
our society, making consensus ever more elusive. How can you rally
people behind high-quality schools, for instance, when the upper
strata of citizens already have them?</TE>
<TE>   Yet I sense a yearning among Californians. I'm not the only one
who wants to believe in destiny. I don't know a single person who is
content to allow a future Kevin Starr to describe this as the era
when we gave up on our dreams.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Needs to Get Its House in Order to Help Shelter All
Its People</HD>
<DH>Too many families cannot afford decent homes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS M. MENINO</AU>
<BD>Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino is president of the U.S.
Conference of Mayors.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As housing costs continue to rise far faster than incomes, the need
to address the nation's affordable-housing crisis is no longer a
topic of conversation just in Silicon Valley or the Big Apple or
inside the Beltway. Housing has become a major economic concern and
deserves the attention of our national leaders.</LD>
<LD>   Everyone has a role to play in recognizing and acting to alleviate
this crisis. The poor, the homeless and low-income working families
continue to struggle to find decent affordable housing. What is new
is the effect of the housing crisis on the nation's middle-income
families.</LD>
<LD>   * The number of middle-income families spending more than half of
their income on housing increased by 74% between 1997 and 1999. More
than 14 million Americans are now forced to spend more than half of
their income on housing.</LD>
<TE>   * In no state today does a full-time minimum-wage job enable most
families to pay fair market rent for a moderate two-bedroom
apartment. Congress would have to double today's minimum wage in
order to enable families leaving the welfare rolls to afford a
two-bedroom apartment.</TE>
<TE>   * Janitors are able to afford rent on a one-bedroom apartment in
only six of the 60 largest housing markets in the country. Retail
salespeople are able to afford rent in only three of these markets.</TE>
<TE>   * Teachers and police officers cannot afford to buy a
median-priced home in most major housing markets.</TE>
<TE>   * According to a recent poll, 41% of Americans believe that the
lack of affordable homes is a very big or fairly big problem,
slightly more than the 39% who express similar concerns about
health-care costs.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever your monthly rent or mortgage might be, the bottom line
is that housing costs are rising much faster than incomes, leaving
less money for general consumer spending and savings--both essential
ingredients for an overall healthy economy.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the U.S. has no federal housing policy, and it doesn't
appear that we will any time soon. Congress and the administration
have failed to enact any significant measures to address this crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Housing Secretary Mel Martinez recently told the nation's mayors
that "housing issues are predominantly local issues" and that the
"solution to meeting the nation's affordable-housing needs will not
come out of Washington."</TE>
<TE>   No one can deny the important role that local governments,
businesses and nonprofits must play in meeting the housing crisis.
Yet it is equally essential for the federal government to address
this problem. Drastic housing budget cuts in the 1980s were followed
by small budget increases in the 1990s, spurred in part by the rising
cost of government-funded housing vouchers. Few resources were
devoted to producing new housing.</TE>
<TE>   For two decades now, the federal government has walked away from
its obligation to preserve the housing we have and build the housing
we need. As our mothers taught us, ignoring a problem will not make
it go away.</TE>
<TE>   America's mayors are united in recognizing that there is an
affordable-housing crisis and in demanding action. Working together,
we have proposed a number of steps, including:</TE>
<TE>   * creating a national homeownership tax credit to make buying a
home more affordable;</TE>
<TE>   * establishing a national affordable-housing trust fund to provide
a steady stream of revenue to deal with critical housing needs, as
Los Angeles and more than 200 other cities do;</TE>
<TE>   * promoting expanded housing assistance by employers in the form
of down payment help, low-interest loans and home-buyer education.</TE>
<TE>   These proposals alone may not solve our affordable-housing crisis,
but they will help. And, equally important, they reflect the mayors'
belief that affordable housing is a national priority.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Troops Must Not Be Palace Guards</HD>
<DH>Acting as Karzai's shield could hurt our interests.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES V. PENA</AU>
<BD>Charles V. Pena is the senior defense policy analyst at
the Cato Institute. Web site: www.cato.org.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld did not know of any
specific threats against Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai, the
United States is nonetheless providing American soldiers for his
security. According to Rumsfeld, this arrangement is supposed to be
"short-term," but he didn't know "whether it's weeks or months or
several months."</LD>
<LD>   Given the state of affairs in Afghanistan, it's not unrealistic to
suppose that "several months" could turn into years.</LD>
<LD>   The whole point of installing the Karzai government was to create
a stable, representative, multiethnic government to replace the
oppressive Taliban regime. Yet the current situation in Afghanistan
can hardly be described as stable.</LD>
<TE>   In February, Air Transportation and Tourism Minister Abdul Rahman
was assassinated at the Kabul airport. Defense Minister Mohammed
Qassim Fahim survived an apparent assassination attempt in April. And
Vice President Haji Adbul Qadir was assassinated early this month.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, the immediate reaction was to demand more U.S.
involvement in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Charles Hagel (R-Neb.) believes that "we are going to have to
take a look at ... more American involvement." According to Sen. Bob
Graham (D-Fla.), "We're going to have to be more active in some of
the security aspects."</TE>
<TE>   But more involvement--especially involvement that is a step toward
nation-building--is exactly the wrong thing for the U.S. to do. And
using U.S. military forces as bodyguards for Karzai is a step in the
wrong direction.</TE>
<TE>   There is already considerable friction over the U.S. military
presence in Afghanistan, especially after the U.S. air attacks on
several Pashtun villages this month. Ethnic Pashtuns, who make up
nearly half the population, are showing signs of losing faith in
Karzai--particularly his ability to protect the political interests
and physical safety of his own ethnic group. Indeed, bringing in
outsiders for protection has generally been an indication of an
Afghan leader's unpopularity.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, U.S. troops acting as Karzai's palace guard smacks of
propping him up and reinforces perceptions that he is a U.S. puppet.
This is a recipe for a disaster like the fall of the shah of Iran in
1979, not a prescription for a stable government.</TE>
<TE>   More important, the national security of the United States does
not require a stable, democratic, multiethnic, representative
government in Afghanistan. Even if Afghanistan reverted to its
traditional form of governance--a decentralized system with a nominal
national government but with most power held by regional
leaders--U.S. security interests demand only that whatever government
is in power not provide haven and support for Al Qaeda terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   If U.S. troops become a security force for Karzai and traditional
rivalries between ethnic factions continue, the U.S. is likely to be
drawn into Afghanistan's internal power struggles (exactly what
Washington seeks to avoid by not committing troops to the
international peacekeeping effort), thus creating incentives and
targets for terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, it is impossible to keep an intervening party's
actions from altering the power calculations of all the rival
factions. Invariably, the outside party will do something that is
seen as benefiting one side's interests at the expense of all
others'. And the outside party then becomes a target for violence.</TE>
<TE>   It will be a big mistake for the U.S.--originally seen as the
liberator of Afghanistan from oppressive Taliban rule--if the Afghan
people come to view the U.S. military presence as an invading and
occupying military force. The U.S. military has better things to do
than guard Karzai. Osama bin Laden is still at large. Al Qaeda and
the Taliban have fled to neighboring Pakistan. If American blood is
to be spilled, it should be against the perpetrators of the Sept. 11
attacks, not in taking a bullet for a foreign president.</TE>

<HD>Still Hope for a Drug Benefit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every member of Congress knows that adjourning without passing a
prescription drug benefit for the elderly will lead to a campaign
dirt-fest and waves of voter recrimination over who killed drug
reform. On Tuesday, it looked as if a last-gasp effort in the Senate
would be voted down. But the vote was delayed overnight, and today
could bring some changes of heart.</LD>
<LD>   Two good measures are still alive: One, by Sens. Bob Graham
(D-Fla.) and Gordon Smith (R-Ore.), would add a prescription drug
benefit to Medicare. The other, by Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and
Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), would prevent producers of brand-name
drugs from using legal chicanery to delay generic-drug competition.</LD>
<LD>   The need for McCain and Schumer's bill, S 812, was abundantly
clear Tuesday when the Federal Trade Commission released a report
concluding that brand-name drug makers often smother competition by
paying generic companies to keep their products off the market or
filing bogus patent extensions.</LD>
<TE>   Graham, Smith and Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) are
trying to attract the 60 votes the measure needs to pass. Therein
lies plenty of room for last-minute mischief.</TE>
<TE>   The Graham-Smith measure is a sensible compromise between
Republican and Democratic plans. It would provide complete drug
coverage for some low-income people--for example, couples on Medicare
with annual incomes under $23,880--but only "catastrophic" coverage
for more affluent beneficiaries whose out-of-pocket drug costs
exceeded $3,300. For the seriously ill, that's not hard to reach. A
new pill to ease lung cancer symptoms, for instance, is predicted to
cost $2,000 a month for a daily dose.</TE>
<TE>   The danger is that Daschle, Graham and Smith will agree to GOP
demands that managed-care companies be allowed more "freedom." That
could let drug companies join with HMOs so their drugs would be
discounted, while other companies' wouldn't. The senators should not
need to watch "John Q" to recognize that letting HMOs control access
to treatments without federal oversight is a bad idea.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Graham-Smith bill would allow managed-care plans to
deliver the new benefit, it would require Medicare to decide certain
basics, such as which drugs would be covered. Medicare has done a
generally good job of deciding what inpatient treatments are
cost-effective. The same principles should guide an outpatient
prescription drug benefit.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle may not get the votes needed to pass the drug benefit.
Both political parties already are taking out radio ads for this
fall's election blaming each other for failure of drug benefit
legislation. But it's still possible to hope. And if lawmakers indeed
pass a bill, then perhaps Congress can also find the courage to
modify the tax cut bill to cover the new benefit. In a choice between
Mom's pills and a tax benefit mostly for the wealthy, guess what wins
the hearts of voters.</TE>

<HD>The Honesty Option</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now that President Bush has signed a tough measure to reform
accounting practices and make outright corporate fraud easier to
detect and punish, on to subtler but still necessary stuff. To
reassure investors both big and small that what they see is what they
get, the distortions caused by overuse of stock options must be
eliminated. The stock exchanges are starting to do it, as are a few
companies.</LD>
<LD>   Stock options, when properly focused, can put management and
workers in tune with shareholders' wishes by sharing some of the
wealth created when the stock price rises. High-tech companies with
limited cash use options to attract and keep employees; big companies
use them as incentives for executives and workers facing tough
economic swings and increased competition.</LD>
<LD>   But options also generate abuses when executives twist quarterly
profit figures to drive up the stock price and thus the value of
their options, which are usually an offer to sell them shares at a
set price after a certain date.</LD>
<TE>   The New York Stock Exchange is heading toward adoption Thursday of
a requirement that member companies submit stock option plans to
shareholder votes. It's an important step because executive pay
packages too often are designed by corporate boards that take their
marching orders from the very executives who stand to benefit.</TE>
<TE>   The stock exchange also wants member companies to provide
shareholders with clearer explanations about the possible costs
associated with stock option programs. But one step beyond these
measures is needed.</TE>
<TE>   The NYSE should demand that companies treat stock option plans as
expenses. That would give shareholders another reason to believe that
they're getting honest corporate earnings statements, because option
packages can have a considerable effect on profit. Merrill Lynch has
reported that earnings at the nation's 500 largest publicly traded
companies would have dropped by 21% during 2001 had options been
counted as expenses.</TE>
<TE>   TIAA-CREF, which manages more than $274 billion in assets for
school and university employees, is one of the nation's biggest
institutional investors. It recently urged top executives at 1,754
publicly traded companies to begin voluntarily expensing options.
Those investors who went along with bloated option plans when rising
stock prices buoyed their own shares should start insisting that
plans reward executives for sustained excellence.</TE>
<TE>   Forward-thinking companies already are acting on the steady
nagging of respected mega-investor Warren Buffett. Coca-Cola Co. and
Washington Post Co., two that count Buffett as an investor, have
taken the lead. More companies should join in--or risk more
regulation.</TE>

<HD>Ease Parole Line, Gov. Davis</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis has little to gain and much to lose by paroling
murderers. The political risk is obvious: He would look insensitive
to victims' families. If the parolee later hurt someone, Davis would
become a target for political rivals, as 1988 presidential candidate
Michael S. Dukakis did when he was hammered by Al Gore and, later,
the elder George Bush over the Willie Horton release.</LD>
<LD>   All that Davis stands to gain by paroling a truly deserving
convict is a measure of integrity and courage.</LD>
<LD>   In the case of David Ramos, a model prisoner convicted of driving
his brother-in-law to a murder scene, society too stands to gain if
the governor reverses his decision to keep this man behind bars. And
releasing Ramos may motivate inmates wondering about the merits of
good behavior in prison.</LD>
<TE>   In 1988, angered by the release of a murderer and rapist named
William Archie Fan, then-Gov. George Deukmejian pushed for
Proposition 89, a measure allowing governors to reject parole board
decisions. Voters gave it to him and future governors.</TE>
<TE>   No doubt parole boards have been conned by teary-eyed sociopaths
who swear they've gone straight. And fed-up voters obviously meant to
give new power to the governor with Proposition 89; there's something
to be said for the state's chief executive having the discretion to
override the occasional poor decision by a parole board. What is
wrong is for a governor to be so frightened of backlash that he
refuses to exercise judgment.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, as calculating a politician as the state has seen, has
rejected 108 out of 110 cases before him. That's a harsher record
than that of predecessor Pete Wilson, who, no softie on crime,
allowed 25 convicted murderers to go free after the passage of
Proposition 89.</TE>
<TE>   As staff writer Jennifer Warren reported Monday in The Times,
Ramos had no criminal record, was attending night school and had just
enlisted in the Army at age 19 when the crime was committed. He did
not wield a weapon. The person who hired the gunman did not implicate
Ramos, and a witness testified that Ramos was not present when the
crime was plotted. The public defender admits having put up a poor
defense in court.</TE>
<TE>   Ramos has taken full responsibility for his actions. His 21-year
prison record is nearly perfect. He was credited with heroism for
rescuing a supervisor who fell into an excavation hole. He earned a
college degree and won honors for teaching more than 1,000 fellow
prisoners to read.</TE>
<TE>   Davis should ask the parole board to rehear Ramos' case, and then
the governor should follow the panel's recommendation for release.
Unless rehabilitation is recognized, what is the use in seeking
redemption?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Opossum Killings Test Limits of Cruelty Cases" (July 29) did not
educate enough about how harmless to humans opossums are and why they
are desirable to have around our yards and homes. They are nocturnal,
so coming across one in the dark is scary. They hiss and show their
teeth when they are frightened, but they don't bite humans. Indeed,
if humans get too close, they freeze and appear to be dead, i.e.,
"play possum."</LD>
<LD>   This actually is an involuntary, shock-like state. I decided not
to bother with traps or any efforts to remove them from hanging
around my yard in the middle of Los Angeles when I learned that they
dine on insects, cockroaches, snails, mice, rats and occasionally
snakes. So opossums are welcome to hold midnight picnics in my yard
to control these pests and allow me to avoid using pesticides and
insecticides that may be much more dangerous to human health.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The photograph says it all. Tragic cruelty. Torturous suffering of
a little opossum shot full of arrows that bravely kept on walking
until it was beaten to death. For shame! Such vile evil must not be
tolerated.</TE>
<TE>   Katrelya Angus</TE>
<TE>   Sierra Madre</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Webster's dictionary defines "discretion" as the ability to make
responsible decisions. Obviously The Times was not using discretion
when publishing the sickening picture of the opossum wounded by
crossbow arrows. A well-written article with explicit details could
have achieved the same impact without the gruesome photo, the likes
of which belong on the rack next to the supermarket tabloids.</TE>

<TE>   Anyone who has confronted an opossum in his or her yard, house or
whatever can confirm that they are unpleasant, even frightening,
pests. I have three dogs and consider myself an "animal lover," but
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and the Humane Society
are really over the top. Do they plan to begin filing charges against
people who use mousetraps? Insecticides? Will they come after me if I
try to kill the crows that destroy my garden?</TE>
<TE>   What if someone ate the opossum? Would it be OK to kill it then?
Or will they push for saving the cows, pigs, etc.?</TE>

<HD>Calabasas Oak's Survival Is Threatened by Cutting</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>So, The Times finally printed a correction (July 28) stating that
"Tree Boards Cut No Slack" (July 22) omitted to mention that the tree
the Schargs cut wasn't even on their property. It was on mine.</LD>
<LD>   They didn't "trim a few branches." Because of their actions the
tree's survival is now threatened.</LD>
<LD>   In an extreme hillside area like this, these trees serve a crucial
function. Their root systems help to keep the hillside stable. If
this tree does die as a result of the Schargs' actions, the
ramifications are enormous. This large old oak tree is on the hill
above my house. There is a safety issue, with potential problems for
my property and those below us.</LD>
<TE>   I feel that The Times was in search of a suitable "victim" for its
story about tree boards punishing citizens. It chose the wrong case
as an example. I don't know which is currently in worse shape--my
butchered tree or your journalistic integrity.</TE>

<LD>Re "CEO Assets Now a Debit for Cheney," July 29: How the editors
could choose to put such an empty analysis of the so-called Cheney
financial scandal on the front page can only be ascribed to political
bias. Not only is there no new news in the entire piece, there is not
a single shred of evidence of any wrongdoing on Vice President Dick
Cheney's part. It is a loose collage of innuendo and suppositions
strung together like some kind of bogus lawsuit. This is journalism?
To treat this as a news story when it is clearly an opinionated
hatchet job is contemptible.</LD>

<TE>   In a time when corporate corruption and the deregulation that
permitted it are foremost in the public's mind, how can The Times run
a story about President Bush's Florida recount fund-raising
windfall--replete with [payments made for] corporate jets from Enron
and Halliburton--on Page A24 ("Bush Files Records for Recount Bid:
$13.8 Million," July 28)? And how can a paper of record explain an
A21 placement of a story about the awarding of a government contract
to a company once run by the second-highest officeholder in the land
("Firm Linked to Cheney Gets Contract for Cuba Jail Cells," July 27)?
It's no wonder 42% of the public thinks Bush favors ordinary
Americans ("Big Business Loses Its Protector," Opinion, July 28).
They're not getting the full story.</TE>
<TE>   Bush did not come out of the blue. He was the son of a president
and a public figure in his own right. The facts have always been
there, and the Fourth Estate failed miserably in vetting and
revealing him for the brother-in-arms of a business vanguard bent on
fleecing us that he was and remains.</TE>

<TE>   I'm not so sure I see eye to eye with William Schneider in "Big
Business Losses Its Protector" (the GOP). If my memory is correct,
those who were engaged in accounting misdeeds were getting away with
it during the Clinton years. Only after Bush took office did these
people start getting caught.</TE>

something funny. Like the stock market. The books are phony. The
brokerages are phony. The accountants are phony. The consultants are
phony. The investment houses are phony. The banks are phony. To
protect us from all this, we have a "proud to be a C student" in the
White House surrounded by cronies of the phonies and a Congress
that's bought and paid for. Put them all in a cocktail shaker, mix
them up and it's the biggest joke since Piltdown Man.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Our White-Collar Terrorists," letters, July 27: Aren't you the
least bit embarrassed by allowing your letters to the editor section
to become a leftist envy and self-pity party? Although the corporate
scandals are one possible reason for sagging investor confidence,
corporate executives--even the corrupt ones--did not directly "steal"
anyone's retirement savings.</TE>
<TE>   Did any of your leftist-ideologue letter writers find it immoral,
or even impractical, when the run-up in stock prices drove their
retirement account balances far beyond money actually earned plus
reasonable interest? Of course not. But now that their gains--not
money earned through work--are being eroded by falling stock prices,
they are back to calling for the overthrow of capitalism, as if they
did not know that stocks could go down as well as up when they made
their 401(k) selections.</TE>

<HD>Iraq War Plans Put the Cart Before the Horse</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ehud Sprinzak and Robert J. Lieber ("Oust Saddam First, Then Pursue
Peace," Opinion, July 28) are, in their own words, "180-degrees
wrong" when they ask us to believe that a U.S. attack on Iraq is
somehow necessary to make Israel "feel more secure in making the
necessary concessions for a viable peace with the Palestinians." This
is twisted logic, putting the cart before the horse.</LD>
<LD>   How does suppressing Palestinian national aspirations with a
brutal occupation have anything to do with a threat from Iraq? It
certainly does not make Israel safer from Iraqi threats. The opposite
approach, ending the occupation and making peace with the
Palestinians, would take away one of the excuses Saddam Hussein uses
to rally support in the Arab states.</LD>
<LD>   Furthermore, if Sprinzak and Lieber really want to identify
"post-Oslo rejectionists," all they have to do is look at Ariel
Sharon. The authors would do well to clean their own house before
pushing the U.S. to clean Iraq's.</LD>
<TE>   A.S. Nassar</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sprinzak and Lieber are right when they speak of the need to
remove Hussein from power. He is everything they say he is, and more.
But if we're going to do so, we ought to follow the Constitution and
ask Congress for a formal declaration of war against Iraq, laying out
our reasons for the war with clear definitions of victory and a plan
for the Iraqi people once we're done.</TE>
<TE>   I have no doubt that the U.S. Congress would approve such moves
wholeheartedly, as would most of the people in the U.S., as would
most of the world. But we're not going to see that sort of thing from
this administration, and when (not if) we just go in on President
Bush's word alone, it will only make things worse.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Vecchio</TE>
<TE>   Alpharetta, Ga.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On July 28 The Times ran two articles advocating national
campaigns to develop domestic backing to forcibly remove Hussein.
Sprinzak and Lieber concede that such an action is "not without
risk." Derek Chollet (Commentary) suggests we need to be braced for
the costs of such a conflict, "including possible U.S. casualties."
Chollet is certain that Congress "will support the president."</TE>
<TE>   The time has come to preemptively tell the administration and its
Fourth Estate apologists that we do not want to sacrifice the lives
of thousands of sons, husbands, brothers and friends unless presented
with overwhelming justification. Hussein may be a despot. He may have
ravaged Iraq. He may be a destabilizing force in the Middle East. But
no satisfactory argument has been made for a unilateral U.S. military
offensive that will require sacrificing thousands of American lives.
Vietnam is a searing, wrenching monument to the folly of sending
American soldiers to die in foreign countries without a clear and
present danger to our national security. If there is merit to the
arguments of Sprinzak, Lieber and Chollet, they must begin by making
an unequivocal case for Hussein's threat to U.S. interests--a case
not yet made.</TE>

<LD>Gov. Gray Davis says his educational programs have helped provide
opportunities for "every deserving child" (July 29). What? Are there
"undeserving" children?</LD>
<LD>   Given his utter lack of focus on his top three
priorities--education, education and education--it would seem that he
thinks so. While affluent school districts continue to do an adequate
job of educating kids, poor schools essentially continue to be
holding tanks for children to whom little is given and even less is
expected. Davis has done nothing to change this.</LD>

the GOP is just as content with him as it would be with any

<HD>Bikers Warned to Follow Dress Code at Fair</HD>
<DH>Ventura County: Officials say new ban on gang attire will
be enforced after deadly Nevada shootout between Hells Angels and the
Mongols.</DH>

<LD>Concerned about violence erupting at the Ventura County Fair, police
say members of the rival Hells Angels and Mongols motorcycle clubs
will be turned away if they attempt to enter the fairgrounds wearing
gang attire.</LD>
<LD>   The fair board this month approved a tighter policy prohibiting
gang clothing, and identified 27 local groups as known criminal
street gangs. The list includes the Hells Angels and Mongols, whose
members were involved in a deadly shootout at a Nevada casino in
April.</LD>
<LD>   In the wake of that incident, fair organizers say the dress code
will help ensure that similar violence between those groups and other
groups does not occur during the 12-day fair that begins today at
Seaside Park in Ventura.</LD>
<TE>   "You have to look at what happened at Laughlin," Seaside Park
General Manager Roger Gibbs said. "You have Mongols living in
Camarillo and Hells Angels five blocks from here."</TE>
<TE>   But national Hells Angels leader George Christie Jr. said his
Ventura chapter has been unfairly singled out and may file a lawsuit
if members and their families are denied entry to the fair on the
basis of their attire.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the same pill they have been feeding the public in
Ventura for the past five years, and it is a placebo," Christie said.
"We are not a street gang. We do not conduct ourselves as a street
gang. And the court has not found that we are a street gang."</TE>
<TE>   Concerns about clashes with the Mongols are overblown, Christie
said, saying a rally earlier this month in Hollister drew 80,000
bikers without incident.</TE>
<TE>   "You know this is a knee-jerk reaction to what happened in
Laughlin," said attorney Kay Duffy, who was contacted by Christie
after the chapter head learned about the fair board's list of gangs.</TE>
<TE>   Duffy contends there is no evidence that the motorcycle club meets
the legal definition of a criminal street gang.</TE>
<TE>   She said a Ventura County judge refused to impose gang conditions
on Christie and his 25-year-old son when placing them on probation
three months ago in a drug sales case, concluding there was no
evidence that the Hells Angels were a street gang.</TE>
<TE>   Duffy says members of the Hells Angels should be treated no
differently than other club members who attend the fair. "4-H has
agriculture," she said. "We have motorcycles."</TE>
<TE>   But Ventura Police Department officials say 4-H members aren't
typically the focus of criminal investigations or violent
confrontations. "Our concern was that the recent activities between
the Hells Angels and [Mongols] is exactly the type of stuff that
could occur inside the fair," Lt. Ken Corney, a gang expert, said.</TE>
<TE>   Three men--two Mongols and one Hells Angel--died in the April
shootings at Harrah's Casino. While concerned over the potential for
such violence, Corney said the revisions to the fair's decade-old
dress code were prompted by a recent state appellate court decision,
and not the casino shootout.</TE>
<TE>   The court ruling stemmed from a Northern California case in which
a Hells Angels member sued over being denied entry to the Sonoma
County Fair after refusing to remove a vest emblazoned with the name
of his biker club. The appellate court found the dress code was so
vague as to be unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   The decision prompted Ventura County fair officials to revisit
their dress code.</TE>
<TE>   The policy specifically prohibits anyone wearing clothing, visible
tattoos or other attire bearing the name or insignia of a criminal
street gang from entering the Ventura County Fairgrounds. The policy
does not ban the wearing of specific colors or sports team logos,
unless the clothing has been altered to symbolize a gang.</TE>

injured in the melee and another Hells Angel was gunned down on the
highway leaving town.</TE>

<TE>   The appellate court found the dress code was so vague as to be
unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   The decision prompted Ventura County fair officials to reexamine
their dress code. The result was a formal two-page policy crafted by
the Ventura city attorney to conform to the Sonoma decision.</TE>
<TE>   The policy specifically prohibits anyone wearing clothing, visible
tattoos or other attire bearing the name or insignia of a criminal
street gang from entering the Ventura County Fairgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   The policy does not ban the wearing of specific colors or sports
team logos, unless the clothing has been altered to symbolize a gang.</TE>
<TE>   Police say the policy is not designed to keep people out of the
fair, but to prevent violence that could be sparked by gang attire.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, if you have a rival gang member who is wearing
clothing or a symbol that identifies their gang, that is seen by
another gang member in that culture as a challenge," Corney said.</TE>
<TE>   The fair policy relies on the legal definition of "criminal street
gang," or a group whose members engage in or who have engaged in a
pattern of criminal activity.</TE>
<TE>   Corney said the Hells Angels now fall under that listing based on
recent felony convictions, including two cases in which current or
former Hells Angels pleaded guilty to gang-related crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Corney said the dress code has been successful in reducing gang
violence at the fair, where security has always been a top priority.</TE>
<TE>   With daily attendance averaging between 20,000 and 30,000, the
fair boasts a population larger than some cities in the county, and
organizers have taken aggressive steps to keep the event safe.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the ban on gang attire, Ventura became the first
city in the state to obtain a permanent injunction barring 31
hard-core members of a west Ventura gang from attending the fair. The
injunction has been in place the last five years.</TE>
<TE>   This year, fair officials have pulled resources from nearly every
law enforcement agency in the county to keep the event problem-free.</TE>
<TE>   As many as 16 officers from the Ventura Police Department will
patrol the 62-acre fairgrounds daily. They will be assisted by
mounted Ventura County sheriff's deputies, probation officers and
hired security guards.</TE>
<TE>   Christie said he and other Hells Angels plan to attend the fair
wearing their familiar leather jackets and other club attire and hope
there will be no confrontations with police.</TE>
<TE>   "We have attended the fair as a club family outing for the past 25
years," Christie said. "We have never been refused and we've never
had a problem there either."</TE>
<TE>   As for a possible lawsuit, Christie said, "I hope it doesn't come
down to that. But we will protect ourselves and our rights
vigorously."</TE>

<HD>Audit Suggests Bows for Bowwows</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tucked into recommendations released Tuesday for Los Angeles' Animal
Services Department is an idea with a special bearing on a pet's
well-being. The city controller advises L.A.'s animal shelters to
"investigate the feasibility of developing special programs to
enhance the presentation of impounded animals."</LD>
<LD>   Among the suggestions for dogs and cats: sweaters, bows, collars
and bandannas.</LD>
<LD>   To see how other agencies run their shelters, auditors visited
Pasadena and a Los Angeles County shelter in Gardena. There, the
staffs told them, grooming and dressing up dogs, and the occasional
compliant cat, "successfully facilitated adoptions."</LD>
<TE>   The suggestions were part of a series of four reports on the
Department of Animal Services issued Tuesday by City Controller Laura
Chick, who periodically audits city departments in search of
inefficiencies. The reports were not an exhaustive review of an
agency that, Chick said, has historically lacked resources and strong
leadership. Auditors examined only adoption, licensing, spaying and
neutering of animals, and the process for hearings on problem pets.</TE>
<TE>   The review focused little on the care that animals receive at city
pounds and more on how the Department of Animal Services does
business. It did not address whether to designate pet owners
officially as animal "guardians," a proposal city officials are
examining.</TE>
<TE>   The audit credited new management for one recent improvement:
Adoptions are up, euthanization down. The 15,490 animals adopted in
the 2000-01 fiscal year represented 22% of those taken in. The year
before, 17% of animals were adopted, and in 1998-99 the figure was
16%. More than 40,000 animals were destroyed in fiscal year 2000-01;
the year before, the number was about 55,000, and in 1998-99, the
number was a little more than 50,000.</TE>
<TE>   Auditors also found that many dogs in Los Angeles are unlicensed
because of the department's lax enforcement, and that few animal
owners take advantage of discounts for spaying and neutering. And the
process for hearing complaints about dangerous animals and barking
dogs often takes far too long.</TE>
<TE>   The department's general manager, Jerry Greenwalt, said Tuesday
that he agrees with most of the controller's suggestions and that his
department will take appropriate action. But for a cash-strapped
agency that houses about 1,000 orphaned dogs, cats, birds, turtles,
horses and other animals every day, dressing them up for adoption, or
even bathing them, is not always feasible.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many greater needs," Greenwalt said, "than putting
neckerchiefs on dogs."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, he said, many of the dogs that animal control officers
bring in wouldn't take kindly to being gussied up. Pit bulls in bow
ties and Rottweilers in ribbons?</TE>
<TE>   "Good luck," Greenwalt said.</TE>
<TE>   But at Los Angeles County's shelters, staff members find that a
bath and a bandanna often make the difference between an animal's
quick adoption and days spent languishing in a kennel before being
euthanized.</TE>
<TE>   "Once they get groomed and once they get a bath, you see the
animal prancing around the cage," said Kaye Michelson, spokeswoman
for the county Department of Animal Care and Control.</TE>
<TE>   If an outfit and a shiny coat find an animal a good caretaker,
dress 'em up, said pet groomer Lynn Davis, owner of Four Your Paws
Only in Tarzana. "If you put two identical dogs side by side and you
put one with a scarf on or a cutesy bow, [potential owners are] going
to look for the one that has a dress-up," she said.</TE>
<TE>   It's how humans react to a pet that determines how the pet feels,
Davis said. She once put dainty bows on one of her clients, a macho
chow named Capone, to good effect. When Capone's owner cooed about
his new look, "he was so proud and he strutted," Davis said--until
the woman's teenage sons laughed at the dog and the animal ripped off
its ribbons.</TE>
<TE>   And, Davis said, "he's never had a bow on since."</TE>

<HD>Local Property Values Kept Rising in 2001</HD>
<DH>Assessment: L.A. County saw 6.2% hike despite Sept. 11
effects. It's no windfall, however.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI and STEPHANIE STASSEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Property values in Los Angeles County shot up by $39 billion last
year, a 6.2% hike that reflects the fourth straight year of strong
real estate markets, most recently fueled by low mortgage rates.</LD>
<LD>   The annual report from Los Angeles County's assessor provides a
trace of a silver lining in an otherwise glum budget season at the
county Hall of Administration. It translates into an extra $100
million in tax revenues for the cash-strapped county, which is facing
an $800-million health budget deficit and a number of other financial
challenges.</LD>
<LD>   The county budget office had already anticipated much of that
increased revenue, however, so the higher values do not represent a
windfall in the government's ongoing budget
deliberations--particularly its struggle to bail out the troubled
health-care system.</LD>
<TE>   The picture was similar across the region, with home values
continuing to soar and more funds trickling into local coffers. In
Orange County, for instance, real estate values increased by more
than 8%.</TE>
<TE>   Still, officials say that the rate of increase has not hit the
double-digit levels seen in the late 1980s and early 1990s, before
the last real estate crash. In 1990, for example, assessed values
shot up by 12%.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Assessor Rick Auerbach said that last year's
numbers are all the more remarkable because Sept. 11 interrupted the
housing market and caused businesses to refrain from making
improvements. Still, assessments rose nearly as much as in the
previous year, when they jumped by 6.8%. The assessed value of the
county's rolls has grown by more than 6% for four straight years.</TE>
<TE>   Auerbach attributed the rise to the tight Los Angeles housing
market and low interest rates that encouraged a record volume of
sales last year. Those factors, he said, "will drive this to
continue."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Auerbach said numbers for this year show that sales
continue at a record clip.</TE>
<TE>   The cities in the county that saw the greatest increase in
assessed value included affluent Santa Monica and Westlake Village.
But less-wealthy cities including Azusa, Palmdale and Monrovia also
joined the list. To real estate experts, that suggests that the real
estate market boom is spreading.</TE>
<TE>   The increased revenue that real estate sales are generating has
only marginal effect, however, on many local and state governments
that face record deficits and rely partly on property taxes to
balance their books.</TE>
<TE>   At the state level, for instance, increases in property tax
revenues will have virtually no immediate effect on the budget, which
remained blocked Tuesday by Republicans in the Assembly for the 30th
day.</TE>
<TE>   This is because estimated spending for the fiscal year starting
July 1 was submitted in the governor's proposed state budget in
January and adjusted to reflect changed conditions in May. Those
estimates already took the booming real estate market into account.
And even with those projections, the state faces a $23.4-billion
budget deficit.</TE>
<TE>   However, the next state budget, to be submitted Jan. 10 by the
governor, will reflect property tax revenues produced by this year's
valuations.</TE>
<TE>   In California, the constitutionally guaranteed financing of public
schools is a responsibility of the state and local governments. To
the extent that local property tax revenues increase, the state's
share of paying for schools is reduced. On the flip side, if local
funds are diminished, a greater burden of paying for education is
shifted to the state.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Hill, the Legislature's nonpartisan budget advisor, has
forecast a statewide 8% increase in local property valuations for the
newly started fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   Several counties are hitting that mark now.</TE>
<TE>   An 8% jump in assessed value in Ventura County kicked an extra $6
million into coffers there, helping close a $17-million shortfall.
Fast-growing San Bernardino and Riverside counties saw 8% and 11.45%
increases respectively, but the higher revenues have been largely
factored into those counties' budgets.</TE>
<TE>   "We're better off than we would have been, but because of the
state's situation, this doesn't solve our problems," said Riverside
County spokesman Ray Smith. "It means we're going to have to be very
careful about how we use the money, so we have enough money to
provide the services and programs that people need. It does help, but
the help is limited."</TE>
<TE>   The extra $7.6 million that San Bernardino County is receiving in
property tax dollars will help offset losses in sales tax revenue
caused by the economic downturn, said county spokesman David Wert.
"It will also give us some cushion to the cuts that the county is
expecting to receive from the state," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County's values rose 8.4%, but the tax-averse county reaps
only a small amount of that in property taxes: an extra $15 million
this year, which county budget planners expected.</TE>
<TE>   "This $15 million doesn't go very far," Orange County
Auditor-Controller David Sundstrom said.</TE>

<HD>Prison Guards' Pact Criticized by State Auditor</HD>
<DH>Labor: Report finds that the lucrative agreement's 37% pay
raise and perks will cost taxpayers more than $500 million a year.
Davis aides respond that the audit is misleading.</DH>

<AU>JENIFER WARREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The lucrative new labor pact Gov. Gray Davis signed with the state
prison guards union will cost California more than half a billion
dollars annually when it takes full effect, according to a critical
audit released Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The report by state auditor Elaine Howle also said the Department
of Corrections' failure to attract and retain employees leads to
massive spending on overtime, contributing to its frequent budget
deficits. In another finding, the audit confirmed that changes in the
guards' sick leave policy under the new agreement have produced a 20%
jump in sick days since the contract was ratified in December. That
further inflates overtime costs as guards are called in to cover for
ailing colleagues.</LD>
<LD>   The audit represents the first independent review of the labor
pact between the state and its correctional officers union, a
contract that has been attacked as a sweetheart deal by lawmakers.
Nearly 400 pages long, the contract grants the state's 20,000 prison
guards pay parity with the California Highway Patrol and five other
large law enforcement agencies. By 2006, guard salaries will increase
37%.</LD>
<TE>   Critics note that the guards, members of the California
Correctional Peace Officers Assn., are one of the governor's largest
campaign contributors. The union donated $251,000 to Davis in March,
two months after he signed the labor deal, and has donated to his
campaigns in years past.</TE>
<TE>   "This audit validates the extraordinary costs that the taxpayers
are going to incur because of this contract," said state Sen. Richard
Polanco (D-Los Angeles), who has sparred with the union in the past.
"I have concerns about the state being such a generous employer in
these hard economic times."</TE>
<TE>   But several members of the Davis administration, joining in a
conference call with reporters, defended the contract Tuesday and
called the 45-page audit misleading.</TE>
<TE>   While acknowledging that the audit provides an accurate summary of
problems besetting the Corrections Department, they said it fails to
identify ways in which the new labor pact will reduce overtime and
thereby ease the department's fiscal woes.</TE>
<TE>   Already, the increased pay, improved retirement benefits and other
enticements in the new contract are helping the department compete
for applicants with other law enforcement agencies, said Edward
Alameida, department director.</TE>
<TE>   The stepped-up recruiting, he said, should allow the department to
reach full staffing strength by 2004, rather than the more distant
date of 2009 that the audit forecasts. As rookies swell the guard
ranks, the department's most senior, highest-paid officers will leave
in greater numbers because of another perk in the contract--an
ability to retire at age 50 and receive as much as 90% of their
salary.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who replace those folks will be at the entry-level pay
scale, so you're saving money there," said Inspector General Steve
White, who reviewed the audit. "None of that was in the calculus
provided by the [auditor]."</TE>
<TE>   With 33 prisons and 157,000 inmates, the California penal system
is the nation's largest, with an annual budget of $4.8 billion.
Despite steady improvements in the salaries and benefits it offers,
the department has struggled to recruit guards and had an attrition
rate of about 6% in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   In the first half of the fiscal year that ended June 30, the
department spent more than $110 million on overtime, well over the
budgeted amount of $74 million, the audit says. Those costs are
exacerbated by a policy that allows the most highly paid officers to
work the most overtime, the audit says.</TE>
<TE>   Don Novey, outgoing president of the guards union, defended the
contract as a fair agreement for a group of workers he says "walk the
toughest beat in the state."</TE>

<HD>Norman Baker, 84; Longtime Composer for Disney</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Norman "Buddy" Baker, who composed scores for about 200 Disney films,
television shows and theme park attractions, ranging from music for
television's beloved "Davy Crockett" to the "It's a Small World" ride
at Disneyland, has died. He was 84.</LD>
<LD>   Baker died Friday of natural causes at his home in Sherman Oaks.</LD>
<LD>   Generations who probably never knew his name know and love his
music from "The Mickey Mouse Club," the original animated "Winnie the
Pooh" films, the animated feature "Fox and the Hound," the
international themes of Epcot at Disney World in Orlando, Fla. and
"Grim Grinning Ghosts" and other music from "The Haunted Mansion" at
Disneyland.</LD>
<TE>   Baker also composed the music for Disneyland's "Great Moments with
Mr. Lincoln" in honor of the president who spent much of his adult
life in Baker's childhood home of Springfield, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the composer, performer, conductor and arranger earned
the ASCAP Foundation Lifetime Achievement Award for his work on
nearly 50 movies and 140 television programs. That year, ASCAP and
New York University established the Buddy Baker Film Scoring Workshop
in his honor.</TE>
<TE>   Baker was nominated for an Academy Award for his score on the 1972
Disney film "Napoleon and Samantha," starring a young Jodie Foster
and Michael Douglas.</TE>
<TE>   The composer also earned four Southern California Motion Picture
Council awards and the National Film Advisory Board award. He also
was nominated for Grammys for his work on an album of songs from
television's "The Electric Company" in 1973 and for "America Sings"
featuring Burl Ives in 1974. Disney Studios, for which he composed
and served as musical director for 28 years, designated him a "Disney
legend."</TE>
<TE>   He was the director of USC's Scoring for Motion Pictures and
Television Program since 1987.</TE>
<TE>   As a child in Illinois, Baker learned to read music before words,
studied piano at age 4 and trumpet at 11 and formed his own band as a
teenager. He earned a doctorate in music at Southwest Baptist
University in Bolivar, Mo., and moved to Los Angeles in 1938.</TE>
<TE>   A big-band arranger and musician, Baker soon began working for
"The Bob Hope Show" on radio and, after World War II began, became
the show's musical director. He brought band leader Stan Kenton to
the program and arranged Kenton's first big hit, "And Her Tears
Flowed Like Wine." Baker also did work for the radio variety shows of
Jack Benny and Eddie Cantor.</TE>
<TE>   A gifted educator and mentor, Baker taught arranging and
orchestration at Los Angeles City College until 1954, when a former
student named George Bruns asked him to help with his heavy workload
at Walt Disney Studio. Baker began with music for the frontier
television series starring Fess Parker as Davy Crockett and remained
with Disney until his retirement in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   Roy E. Disney, vice chairman of Walt Disney Co., called Baker "a
terrific guy and a major contributor to the films, television shows
and theme park attractions."</TE>
<TE>   "I had the privilege of working with Buddy on scores for several
projects that I produced, and he always came through with something
original and appropriate," Disney said. "I remember one time I asked
him to create a 'funny' score for a comedy we were making, and he had
the orchestra in stitches while they were recording it. He was a
great person and an enormous talent."</TE>
<TE>   As musical director for "The Mickey Mouse Club," the quick-minded
Baker composed fresh music daily throughout its five-day-a-week,
four-year run.</TE>
<TE>   His first feature film score was for Disney's 1960 "Toby Tyler."
Among those that followed were "Rascal," "Run, Cougar, Run," "The
Monkey's Uncle," "The Gnome-Mobile" and "$1,000,000 Duck."</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1960s, Baker began concentrating on theme park
attractions, creating not only music for Disneyland and later Epcot
and Disney World, but also for "The Carousel of Progress" at the
1964-65 New York World's Fair. At Epcot, he personally arranged the
music for seven attractions, including "Impressions de France" and
for "The American Adventure" as well as supervising all music for the
park.</TE>
<TE>   Although he retired from Disney in 1983 and began teaching at USC
two years later, Baker frequently returned to the studio to add new
music for theme parks in Anaheim, Orlando and Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   A renowned conductor, composer and arranger, Baker conducted such
groups as the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic
Orchestra of London and the Graunke Symphony Orchestra of Munich, and
in such venues as the Hollywood Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Baker is survived by his wife of 26 years, Charlotte; a daughter
from a previous marriage, Catherine "CiCi" Baker of Lake Tahoe, Nev.;
a sister, Noreene Doss of Springfield, Ill.; a stepson, Scott Keene;
two grandchildren; and a great-grandchild.</TE>
<TE>   The funeral will be private. A celebration of Baker's life will be
scheduled.</TE>
<TE>   The family has asked that, instead of flowers, memorial donations
be made to USC's Flora Thornton School of Music for the Scoring for
Motion Pictures and Television Program.</TE>

<HD>Teen Denies Provoking Police Jabs</HD>
<DH>Courts: In grand jury transcript, Donovan Jackson says he
obeyed all orders. But peace officers granted immunity say he
resisted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN and STEVE BERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Teenager Donovan Jackson told grand jurors that he did not provoke
the scuffle that occurred moments before an Inglewood police officer
slammed him into the trunk of a patrol car and then punched him in
the jaw July 6.</LD>
<LD>   Jackson said he was pummeled and choked into unconsciousness by
officers and does not remember the beating that was captured on an
amateur videotape that spurred a national uproar, according to the
testimony he gave to the Los Angeles County Grand Jury earlier this
month.</LD>
<LD>   The statements of Jackson, who has not commented publicly, are
contained in a 450-page transcript of the grand jury proceedings that
was unsealed late Tuesday by Superior Court Judge David Wesley after
an oral motion by the district attorney's office.</LD>
<TE>   The transcript also shows that two Inglewood police officers and
two sheriff's deputies were given immunity by prosecutors to testify
before the grand jury after they initially refused to answer
questions.</TE>
<TE>   None of the four said they saw Inglewood Officer Jeremy Morse
throw a handcuffed Jackson onto the patrol car. But the two immunized
Inglewood officers, after being shown the video shot from a motel
across the street, said Morse's actions were not acceptable police
behavior.</TE>
<TE>   The transcript also reveals that at least some of the officers at
the scene were aware they were being taped as the incident unfolded.</TE>
<TE>   The grand jury, after six days of testimony, indicted Morse on a
charge of assault under the color of authority, and his partner,
Bijan Darvish, on a charge of filing a false police report. The two
officers, who did not testify before the grand jury, have pleaded not
guilty to the felony charges, which carry prison terms of up to three
years if they are convicted.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the law enforcement officers granted immunity, the
grand jury also heard testimony from witnesses including Jackson's
father, Coby Chavis, the amateur videographer Mitchell Crooks and
three county Fire Department employees who went to the scene of the
incident at an Inglewood gas station.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to assertions in police reports that he violently
resisted officers, Jackson, 16, testified that he obeyed every order
from the moment he first encountered one of two sheriff's deputies
who were questioning Chavis, 41, about an expired registration tag.
Jackson said he peacefully obeyed orders to submit to a pat-down
search and that he felt "violated," frightened and "a little bit"
angry because of the search.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said he also complied with a request to sit in the back of
the sheriff's patrol car. The violence, he testified, erupted when he
stood up upon seeing Morse and Darvish arrive. Jackson told grand
jurors he stood because he feared the officers would beat him. He
said a deputy then put his hand on Jackson's neck, at which time the
officers began hitting him, the youth said.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson described "four or five officers coming at me" and said
they hit him with four quick punches to the jaw, after which they put
him on the ground, where the beating continued. He said someone hit
him near his ear with a baton or a flashlight, a statement that he
repeated to a paramedic, according to the transcript.</TE>
<TE>   When one of the officers wrapped his arm around his neck and
squeezed until he could not breathe, Jackson said, he started kicking
and trying to get free until he passed out. The youth said he did not
regain consciousness until Morse was walking him to a patrol car
after the trunk-slamming incident. He said Morse made him sit in the
car and told him, "I'm going to break your nose." Another officer
said he was going to break Jackson's neck, the youth said.</TE>
<TE>   The boy said his injuries included a swollen face, a red eye, a
cut on his head and continuing headaches.</TE>
<TE>   The two Inglewood officers and the two sheriff's deputies granted
immunity each told a slightly different version of events, but there
was agreement that the teenager did not resist after he was
handcuffed on the ground at the end of the scuffle.</TE>
<TE>   Inglewood Officer Mariano Salcedo, an eight-year veteran of the
force, said that a deputy and two Inglewood officers were on top of
Jackson when he arrived and that he could see the youth moving his
feet.</TE>
<TE>   He said the officers repeatedly told Jackson to "stop resisting."
Salcedo said he got on top of Jackson's legs and later helped roll
him from his back to his stomach. He said Jackson stopped resisting
when the officers handcuffed him.</TE>
<TE>   Salcedo said he walked away to call into the police station and
never saw Morse slam Jackson onto the trunk of the car. "I heard a
thump, like something being placed on something," Salcedo said,
apparently referring to the moment seen on the videotape in which
Morse slammed Jackson onto the trunk.</TE>
<TE>   Moments later, Salcedo said, he heard Morse yell, "Let me go, let
me go," and "flinch back with his hips" just before he saw the
officer strike Jackson in the jaw. Morse has said Jackson grabbed him
in the groin area. Salcedo testified that he did not see Jackson grab
the officer.</TE>
<TE>   At one point after the videotaped punch, Salcedo said, he took
Morse's hand to restrain him. He said he grabbed the officer "to get
his attention.... I wanted to get in there and get the suspect,
de-escalate and get the suspect in the car."</TE>
<TE>   Salcedo said that shortly after he arrived during the scuffle, he
saw a man in a motel across the street filming the event. "I just
made an announcement to the officers, 'Watch your Ps and Qs,' Salcedo
said.</TE>
<TE>   Inglewood Officer Antoine Crook echoed much of his partner's
testimony, but said he struck Jackson's hand with a flashlight during
the scuffle after the youth refused to put his arms behind his back.</TE>
<TE>   The first law enforcement officers on the scene were Sheriff's
Deputies Carlos Lopez and Daniel Leon. Lopez testified that about 5
p.m., he and his partner, Leon, were driving east on Century
Boulevard when he looked into a gas station and decided to run a
license plate. After realizing that the registration was expired, the
deputies got out of their car. Lopez approached the passenger side
and Leon walked to the driver's side.</TE>
<TE>   When the passenger, Jackson, started to get into the car, Lopez
said, he asked him to wait. The deputy said that Jackson did not
listen but grabbed the door and tried to get in, and that he asked
the youth again to wait. At that point, Lopez said, "He just stopped
there and just started staring at me intently with an angered look
and breathing hard."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson refused to follow several more orders, Lopez said, so the
deputy grabbed the youth's arms and put the palms together. Lopez
said that when he tried to put the boy in his patrol car, Jackson
lunged and he forced him onto the ground. "I want to place handcuffs
on him the quickest way so as to prevent injury to myself, the
Inglewood officers and himself," Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   Once down on the ground, Lopez testified, Jackson was swinging his
arms and kicking. Officers Morse and Darvish tried to control him and
yelled, "Stop resisting," Lopez testified. The deputy said he
recalled seeing Darvish punch Jackson twice in the face. After
Jackson was handcuffed, the youth stopped resisting, according to the
transcript.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez wrote in a six-page report that Jackson scratched and fought
with the Inglewood police officers, requiring them to hit the
teenager in the face, but he acknowledged to the grand jury that he
had not seen the scratching directly.</TE>
<TE>   Leon testified that he did not see Morse hit Jackson or slam him
on the patrol car.</TE>

<HD>Stress Pushed Man to Kill Autistic Son, Self, Says Family</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAI TRAN and MIKE ANTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Delfin Bartolome was a hard-working family man, a father of three who
never buckled under the stress of raising a son with severe autism--a
27-year-old who still slept in his parents' bedroom.</LD>
<LD>   But the 55-year-old Laguna Niguel engineer was becoming
increasingly despondent about his job security. The stress of that
uncertainty, his family said, was something Bartolome couldn't
handle.</LD>
<LD>   Monday, Bartolome shot his son Dale to death outside Vocational
Visions A.R.T.S, a Mission Viejo school for the developmentally
disabled that he attended. Then Bartolome turned the gun on himself.</LD>
<TE>   Witnesses saw the two talking in the back seat of their minivan
about 3:30 p.m. Three hours later, a teacher noticed the van was
still there with its engine running. She looked inside and found
father and son dead.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say Bartolome shot Dale twice in the upper torso with
a .357-caliber handgun and shot himself once in the head.</TE>
<TE>   The violence left family members stunned and seeking answers as
they gathered in Bartolome's Laguna Niguel home Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We have always known Delfin to be a devoted husband and father,"
said Roger Mationg, 27, Bartolome's nephew. "Although we cannot
understand what was going on in his mind at the time, we imagine that
he believed his intentions were out of concern and love for his
family during what may have been a stressful time for him."</TE>
<TE>   Bartolome was described by those who knew him as a quiet man who
was devoted to his family and to providing for them.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday nights, he played poker with family and friends--and
always won. On weekends, he and wife, Alexis, 54, would go swing
dancing, taking Dale along for the ride across the floor. Each
Sunday, Bartolome made breakfast for his family before taking them
all to church.</TE>
<TE>   At Vocational Visions, a caseworker said the severity of Dale's
autism required one-on-one attention.</TE>
<TE>   By necessity, Dale was his family's focal point, someone who
required constant love and patience. That was something family
members say Delfin and Alexis Bartolome had plenty of.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time Del talked about him, he would have this big smile,"
said neighbor Mary Beth Molnar. "You know he loved his son and loved
to care for him."</TE>
<TE>   A native of the Philippines, Bartolome came to the United States
in 1971. He worked as an electrical engineer for Bechtel Corp. for 20
years, first in San Francisco and later in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   He went to work for Aliso Viejo-based Fluor Corp. in 2000. When
his project came to an end in mid-June, a company official said
Bartolome was given a "customary" leave of absence.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the first time he stayed home, and it was a big adjustment,"
said Priscilla Nishiyama, his sister-in-law. "It was difficult."</TE>
<TE>   Bartolome was called back to work on a new project July 19, but
only for a month, according to family members. He wasn't sure if he'd
have a job once the month was over, they said.</TE>
<TE>   The temporary nature of the job unnerved Bartolome, said family
members who reassured him.</TE>
<TE>   Monday, hours before he shot his son and himself, Bartolome went
to work.</TE>
<TE>   "He was fine," said a brother-in-law who works with him at Fluor.
"There was no indication this would happen."</TE>

<HD>Stress Pushed Man to Kill Son, Himself, Family Says</HD>
<DH>Tragedy: Job worries led to the death of a Laguna Niguel
engineer and an autistic student, they say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAI TRAN and MIKE ANTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Delfin Bartolome was a hard-working family man, a father of three who
never buckled under the stress of raising a son with severe autism--a
27-year-old who still slept in his parents' bedroom.</LD>
<LD>   But the 55-year-old Laguna Niguel engineer was becoming
increasingly despondent about his job security. The stress of that
uncertainty, his family said, was something Bartolome couldn't
handle.</LD>
<LD>   Monday, Bartolome shot his son Dale to death outside Vocational
Visions A.R.T.S, a Mission Viejo school for the developmentally
disabled that he attended. Then Bartolome turned the gun on himself.</LD>
<TE>   Witnesses saw the two talking in the back seat of their minivan
about 3:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Three hours later, a teacher noticed the van was still there with
its engine running. She looked inside and found father and son dead.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say Bartolome shot Dale twice in the upper torso with
a .357-caliber handgun and shot himself once in the head.</TE>
<TE>   The violence left family members stunned and seeking answers as
they gathered in Bartolome's Laguna Niguel home Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We have always known Delfin to be a devoted husband and father,"
said Roger Mationg, 27, Bartolome's nephew. "Although we cannot
understand what was going on in his mind at the time, we imagine that
he believed his intentions were out of concern and love for his
family during what may have been a stressful time for him."</TE>
<TE>   Bartolome was described by those who knew him as a quiet man who
was devoted to his family and to providing for them.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday nights, he played poker with family and friends--and
always won. On weekends, he and wife, Alexis, 54, would go swing
dancing, taking Dale along for the ride across the floor. Each
Sunday, Bartolome made breakfast for his family before taking them to
church.</TE>
<TE>   "Dad, he lived for us," said his son Don, 20. "He was hard to shop
for on Father's Day or Christmas because he didn't have any hobbies.
He cared for his family and didn't care about what others had."</TE>
<TE>   At Vocational Visions, a caseworker said the severity of Dale's
autism required one-on-one attention. Neighbors said he would
occasionally burst from his home, run screaming to the end of the
block, then turn and calmly walk back.</TE>
<TE>   By necessity, Dale was his family's focal point, someone who
required constant love and patience. That was something family
members say Delfin and Alexis Bartolome had plenty of.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time Del talked about him, he would have this big smile,"
said neighbor Mary Beth Molnar. "You know he loved his son and loved
to care for him."</TE>
<TE>   A native of the Philippines, Bartolome came to the United States
in 1971. He worked as an electrical engineer for Bechtel Corp. for 20
years, first in San Francisco and later in Orange County, where he
was transferred.</TE>
<TE>   He went to work for Aliso Viejo-based Fluor Corp. in 2000. When
his project came to an end in mid-June, a company official said
Bartolome was given a "customary" leave of absence.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the first time he stayed home, and it was a big adjustment,"
said Priscilla Nishiyama, his sister-in-law. "It was difficult."</TE>
<TE>   Bartolome was called back to work on a new project July 19, but
only for a month, according to family members. He wasn't sure if he'd
have a job once the month was over, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "He gladly and enthusiastically returned to work," company
spokeswoman Lori Serrato said.</TE>
<TE>   The temporary nature of the job unnerved Bartolome, said family
members who tried to reassure him.</TE>
<TE>   "He had great skills, and we told him they usually extend the
projects," said a brother-in-law who worked with him at Fluor and
declined to give his name. Monday, hours before he shot his son and
himself, Bartolome went to work.</TE>
<TE>   "He was fine," said his brother-in-law. "There was no indication
this would happen."</TE>
<TE>   Bartolome talked of retiring in four years. He planned to buy his
two younger sons each a duplex near family in Rancho Santa Margarita.
Then he planned to return to the Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted to take Alexis and Dale back and build a house for
them," said Juan Mationg, Bartolome's brother-in-law. "He was always
thinking about their future."</TE>

<HD>College District Seeks Bonds, Another Might</HD>
<DH>Education: Rancho Santiago trustees have approved a funding
measure; Coast trustees vote on one tonight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Encouraged by recent successes elsewhere in the state, a central
Orange County community college district will ask voters to approve a
bond measure for upgrading campuses and acquiring land. A second
district was expected to follow suit tonight.</LD>
<LD>   Rancho Santiago Community College district trustees voted
unanimously Monday night to ask constituents to vote on a
$337-million bond issue in November. Coast Community College District
trustees will consider seeking $370 million.</LD>
<LD>   "We're literally bursting at the seams as we have a combination of
new growth in east Orange County and a significant number of people
realizing that community colleges are a great bargain for their
children," John Hanna, president of Rancho Santiago's board of
trustees, said Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   California voters two years ago lowered the threshold for passage
of bond measures to 55%. Previously, two-thirds of a school
district's voters needed to endorse the plan.</TE>
<TE>   From 1980 to 2000, slightly more than half of school bond measures
won passage.</TE>
<TE>   In March, voters passed bond issues in 13 of 14 community college
districts around the state. Among them was North Orange County
Community College District, which includes Cypress and Fullerton
colleges.</TE>
<TE>   Both Rancho Santiago and Coast plan to use the bonds to construct
new buildings, renovate old ones and rewire buildings, making it
easier to hook up new technology, district officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Rancho Santiago officials said the money also would fund planned
expansion of the district's two campuses, Santa Ana and Santiago
Canyon colleges.</TE>
<TE>   Coast Community College District includes Orange Coast, Golden
West and Coastline community colleges in west Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   If the measures are endorsed by voters on Nov. 5, property owners
would pay about $25 per $100,000 of assessed value.</TE>
<TE>   The two districts are facing problems similar to those of
community colleges across California--a marked increase in students,
an aging infrastructure and too little funding from the state for
capital improvements.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the decade, the state's community colleges are
expected to enroll an additional 525,000 students.</TE>
<TE>   They need $13.8 billion for renovation and new facilities, said
Frederick E. Harris, director of college finance and facilities
planning for the state community college chancellor's office.</TE>
<TE>   The November ballot measure will be the first Rancho Santiago has
taken to voters since the district was created in 1971.</TE>
<TE>   Hanna said a district poll of 604 potential voters in May found
that 61% would support the measure.</TE>
<TE>   If Coast trustees agree to seek a bond measure, it will be the
first time the district has sought such public funding since the
1960s.</TE>

<DH>School psychologists study a new way to gain insight into
students' learning problems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NERISSA PACIO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An odd mixture of smells--formaldehyde, cookies and coffee--filled
the air as Phillip DeFina held up a gray, fist-sized lump in front of
his class.</LD>
<LD>   "Our arousal states emanate from the pons and the brain stem," the
school psychologist said, motioning his students to examine similar
lumps--sheep's brains--in the metal trays in front of them.</LD>
<LD>   The students poked at the rubbery masses with intense curiosity,
some carefully peeling away the outer, cellophane-like membranes with
forceps.</LD>
<TE>   "We're not just dissecting a brain here," DeFina said. "We're
learning the function of the brain to determine the cause of
behavioral issues."</TE>
<TE>   In hopes of probing the mysteries of the mind, about 30 school
psychologists from Los Angeles and Orange counties have left their
campuses and the students they counsel to become students themselves.</TE>
<TE>   At the Los Angeles County Office of Education headquarters in
Downey, the psychologists recently attended a two-week introductory
class for a yearlong course in neuropsychology: the science of
linking the brain's structure and function to behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the psychologists said the post-graduate training, which
began July 8, would help them place disabled children with traumatic
brain injuries, autism and other learning disabilities on the correct
special education plans.</TE>
<TE>   School psychologists often use IQ and achievement tests to
determine disabilities, but it is difficult to define the exact
nature of a child's learning problem, DeFina said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a shotgun approach that takes a long time," he said.
"Neuropsychologists use a more finely tuned approach by determining
the emotional and behavioral blueprint of a child."</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Zuckerman Goldstein, a school psychologist in South Pasadena
Unified School District, said she had enrolled in the program to gain
a deeper understanding of what she had learned as a psychologist.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trained to find out what is wrong" with a child, she said.
"But neuropsychologists can explain more about why a certain part of
the brain affects that particular function. It's a step deeper."</TE>
<TE>   While updating the psychologists on the latest neuroscience
breakthroughs, the program also teaches them about brain chemistry
and environmental stress.</TE>
<TE>   "With the proper training, we could use what we know to diagnose
kids, perhaps avoiding incidents of school violence like Columbine,"
said Sandy Elson, a school psychologist who works for Los Angeles
County.</TE>
<TE>   The training is intended to help not only the child, but also the
classroom teachers, who will "have more information related to a
child's strengths and weaknesses," said Dan Miller, chairman of the
psychology and philosophy department at Texas Women's University in
Denton, which is sponsoring the program.</TE>
<TE>   For example, with a psychologist's help, the teacher might learn
whether a child works better with visual cues than with numbers. A
child may register the spelling of a word by looking at the
arrangement of letters on paper, but not comprehend it aurally. A
teacher could then use flashcards to teach that student.</TE>
<TE>   In such a case, it might not be wise to judge a student's
intelligence solely on the results of an IQ test, said Miller, who
founded the program.</TE>
<TE>   After showing the class a video in which a scientist dissected a
human brain, DeFina hit the pause button. "What you learn here will
help you guys be the bridge between teachers, educators and the
medical doctors who are writing all the prescriptions for these
kids," he said.</TE>
<TE>   School psychologists and neuropsychologists use many of the same
assessment measures, such as statistical models, classroom behavior
observation and academic tests. Both use oral question-and-answer
sessions, written exams and physical tasks to measure, for example,
motor skills.</TE>
<TE>   While neuropsychologists don't use medical technology, such as CAT
scans, they do have a few more tools than psychologists. They run
other noninvasive exams for such brain functions as memory, abstract
reasoning and attention. Those might lead to diagnoses and treatment
plans different from those psychologists would devise, Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   Neuropsychologists began training school psychologists in the
1990s after a federal initiative helped biomedical research in this
area, DeFina said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, a federal law identified traumatic brain injury as a
"handicapping condition" to be accommodated in the schools. At the
same time, shrinking private practices, combined with the rise of
health maintenance organizations, have made it more difficult for
children with such disabilities to receive medical services, Miller
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have children who suffered brain injuries ... and they show up
on the doorstep of schools saying, 'Here I am, educate me,' " Miller
said. "The psychologists aren't prepared to deal with them."</TE>
<TE>   To enroll in the neuropsychology program, students must be
licensed school psychologists with at least three years of on-the-job
experience. They pay $3,000 apiece for the course. Some school
districts pay the tuition. Districts do not necessarily increase
salaries with this certification.</TE>
<TE>   After the two-week summer session, the class participates in
online discussions and quizzes. It is to meet every Saturday during
the school year. The course is to conclude with a weeklong session at
the end of the year; the psychologists must pass a three-hour
multiple-choice exam to receive certificates from Texas Women's
University.</TE>
<TE>   There are about 1,000 school psychologists in Los Angeles County,
300 in Orange County and more than 4,000 statewide. DeFina hopes to
train enough so that there will be at least one certified
psychologist in every district. Miller plans to expand the program to
other U.S. cities.</TE>
<TE>   Many school psychologists in the program think it will improve
their services to the combined 124,000 students with learning
disabilities in Los Angeles and Orange counties.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Springer, a full-time psychologist in the Inglewood
Unified School District, said parents are interested in learning more
than that their children are not functioning well in school.</TE>
<TE>   "They want to know the cause," she said. "But they also want a way
to prevent it, so that their child can move on to being treated."</TE>

<HD>Councilman Put Dental Work on Compton's Tab</HD>
<DH>Probe: D.A.'s office is investigating Amen Rahh's $1,200
charge, later repaid, on a city credit card. Other bills are also
scrutinized.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TED ROHRLICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Service with a smile took on new meaning as a public benefit in
Compton when a city councilman got his teeth fixed at taxpayer
expense.</LD>
<LD>   Councilman Amen Rahh charged $1,200 worth of what he described as
emergency dental work in July 2000 to his city credit card, issued to
him for use in conducting city business.</LD>
<LD>   Rahh said he repaid the city, but only after a year had passed and
a new city manager questioned the charge. A previous city manager or
his deputy had OKd it, Rahh said.</LD>
<TE>   Rahh is under investigation by the Los Angeles County district
attorney's office for possible criminal misuse of his city credit
card. No charges have been filed. In addition to the dental bills,
city records show that the card was used to pay the air fare and
expenses for his wife and three of his children on a September 2000
trip to Washington, D.C. In an interview, Rahh said he has repaid the
city $1,440 for the family's air fare.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's investigation is part of a broader look at
allegations of misuse of taxpayer money that have bedeviled the city
of 90,000, according to sources familiar with the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Rahh said he never intended to cheat taxpayers. He dismissed the
investigation as politically motivated and aimed at supporting
Compton Mayor Eric Perrodin, a deputy district attorney who last year
defeated the longtime mayor, Omar Bradley. Rahh is a Bradley ally.</TE>
<TE>   Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office,
said the investigation began before Perrodin's election.</TE>
<TE>   Rahh declined to describe details of his dental emergency, saying
it was personal. He justified billing taxpayers for it by saying that
he was on city business, en route to Inglewood, when the emergency
arose. Rahh said he was going to meet international businessmen,
whose names he can no longer recall, but who were thinking of opening
a facility in Compton.</TE>
<TE>   Rahh said he called either Compton City Manager John Johnson or
Assistant City Manager Lawrence Adams, and one of them agreed that
the charge was justified. Rahh said he drove to his regular dentist
in Inglewood, who did the work. Neither Johnson nor Adams responded
to repeated requests for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Compton's written policy on credit cards is that they are to be
used "exclusively for travel and [making] meeting reservations
related to city business."</TE>
<TE>   Rahh, 54, who teaches black studies at Cal State Long Beach and
Compton City College, said his "intent was to go by the policy,"
which also says credit card holders "will be held personally liable
for any unauthorized charges."</TE>
<TE>   Rahh said he took that to mean civilly liable. To that end, Rahh
said, he has long maintained a special account at the city
controller's office, which deducts at his direction $100 to $200 per
month from his city salary in case questions arise about his credit
card use. Controller's office officials would not comment.</TE>
<TE>   Rahh said that a year after his dental emergency, a new city
manager, Howard Caldwell, questioned the propriety of the charge and
Rahh then paid the city back. He produced photocopies of money orders
and a copy of a receipt from the city controller's office. City
Controller Marilyn Horne and her staff declined to speak with a
reporter.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, Caldwell replaced Johnson as city manager when
control of city government briefly shifted to a faction loyal to
Perrodin and away from former Mayor Bradley.</TE>
<TE>   Caldwell said he told Rahh he was discontinuing Johnson's practice
of approving city payment of credit card charges without seeing a
description of the charges.</TE>
<TE>   According to Caldwell, the two discussed the charges and when Rahh
mentioned the dental charge, Caldwell said it struck him as
illegitimate. Caldwell suggested Rahh repay the money and Rahh said
he would.</TE>
<TE>   Both said their conversation occurred about six weeks before the
district attorney's office served search warrants on City Hall and
the homes of Rahh, Bradley and Johnson, seeking financial records.</TE>
<TE>   In February, when control of the city government shifted back to
Bradley's supporters, Johnson was reinstated as city administrator.
He has refused to release public documents on the credit card
expenditures of Rahh and other council members, said City Clerk
Charles Davis.</TE>
<TE>   State law requires that such records be open for public view.</TE>
<TE>   City records obtained by The Times show that in addition to the
dental work, taxpayers picked up $7,000 in expenses when Rahh's wife
and three children accompanied him to Washington in September 2000.
The trip was timed for the annual conference of the Congressional
Black Caucus, a gathering of black elected officials.</TE>
<TE>   Rahh said he always intended to pay his family's expenses but some
inadvertently were charged to his city credit card by city officials
who arranged his travel.</TE>
<TE>   Records show the city paid $360 for Rahh's air fare and that four
$360 tickets for his wife and three children were charged to his city
credit card.</TE>
<TE>   Rahh produced photocopies of money orders, a check and a receipt
from the controller's office indicating that 11 months after the
trip, he repaid the city for his family's air fare.</TE>
<TE>   The documents did not indicate any repayment for his family's
hotel bill. The charge on Rahh's city credit card for accommodations
in Washington came to $2,683--$670 per night for four nights.</TE>
<TE>   Rahh also got a check from the city to pay his estimated rental
car bill in Washington. That covered about $87 per day for five days.</TE>
<TE>   But records show his city credit card was charged another $975 for
a Hertz bill, bringing his total rental car expenses for the trip to
$1,410, or $280 per day.</TE>
<TE>   Rahh said he had only one car and two hotel rooms and that he
believes his rental car and hotel charges may have been inflated,
perhaps by city staff members on the trip who were charging other
expenses to his card.</TE>

<HD>LAPD Blames Faulty Training in DNA Snafu</HD>
<DH>Police: Officials say evidence was destroyed in rape cases
because detectives didn't know about a change in the statute of
limitations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A day after disclosing that the Los Angeles Police Department
mistakenly destroyed biological evidence in 1,100 sexual assault
cases, LAPD officials blamed the problem on their failure to properly
train detectives on maintaining so-called rape kits.</LD>
<LD>   Acting Chief Martin Pomeroy told members of the Police Commission
that detectives ordered DNA evidence destroyed because they were
unaware that the statute of limitations for rape cases was lengthened
in 2001 from six years to 10.</LD>
<LD>   Lt. Horace Frank, an LAPD spokesman, said in an interview that the
department has reviewed its procedures in recent weeks to determine
what went wrong. He said a memo was issued to detectives when the
change took effect, but somehow the information was overlooked.</LD>
<TE>   "We've had a lot of new detectives who have inherited unsolved
cases," Frank said. "For some reason they were not made aware....
It's absolutely a training issue."</TE>
<TE>   Pomeroy said that the department has formed a task force to look
into the issue and that the forensics division has been ordered not
to destroy any evidence.</TE>
<TE>   He said the department has revamped its training to make sure
officers are informed of changes in state law.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe we're in a good position to stop the disposing of such
evidence," Pomeroy said.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD officials disclosed to council members Monday that a random
sampling of unsolved sexual assault cases dating to 1995 found that
detectives had ordered DNA evidence destroyed in 1,100 cases.</TE>
<TE>   The problem came to light in April, when the district attorney's
forensic science director complained that evidence in as many as
4,000 sexual assault cases in Los Angeles County might have been lost
or destroyed by law enforcement over the last six years.</TE>
<TE>   DNA, which is obtained from body fluids such as semen, blood and
saliva, is the basic identifying material in the human cell and is
responsible for transmitting a person's unique genetic patterns.
Foreign DNA collected from a victim in a rape kit is compared with a
DNA sample from a suspect to determine if the two match. In many
instances, the sample is all a prosecutor needs to make a case
against a suspect.</TE>
<TE>   Pomeroy said it is unclear whether any evidence was destroyed in
cases that were open or unsolved at the time. However, he said it was
possible.</TE>
<TE>   "We have looked into this," Pomeroy said. "Certainly, in some of
those cases we could have had evidence that could have made a
difference in the investigation."</TE>
<TE>   Police Commission President Rick Caruso said in an interview
Tuesday that "there is no excuse" for detectives destroying the
evidence.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't understand what the statute of limitations were,"
Caruso said. "They weren't trained properly. We have been assured
that there is a new training program in place and the same mistake
won't happen again.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unfortunate that it happened in the first place."</TE>
<TE>   City Councilman Jack Weiss said he will introduce a motion at
today's council meeting instructing the city attorney to work with
the LAPD inspector general to ensure that officers are schooled on
all law changes.</TE>
<TE>   "The law is constantly evolving," Weiss said. "There are new
statutes enacted all the time. We need to make sure that officers
stay on the cutting edge."</TE>
<TE>   Women's advocates also called for further scrutiny of department
practices.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that they threw out the kits is unbelievable," said
Karen Polmer, a Los Angeles sexual assault victim who helped lead the
charge for lengthening the statute of limitations in rape cases.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only does it impact thousands of women whose cases are
unsolved, it also affects the innocent people who may have been
convicted of crimes but now will not be able to prove their
innocence. It just makes me sick to my stomach."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Sheriff's officials, meanwhile, said they have
been auditing their own DNA procedures in recent months and hope to
have the results soon. So far, they have found that detectives have
properly maintained DNA samples, said Sgt. Dan Scott.</TE>

<HD>Julian F.S. Foster, 75, Professor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Julian Francis Sherwood Foster, who taught political science at Cal
State Fullerton for 31 years and became a well-known champion of
liberal and academic causes, was eulogized at a memorial service
Sunday, one day after what would have been his 76th birthday.</LD>
<LD>   Foster died early last week after suffering an apparent heart
attack and falling into the swimming pool at his Santa Ana home.</LD>
<LD>   "He was a very eloquent speaker who students thought was one of
the best teachers at the university," said Beatrice Foster, his wife
of 45 years. "He was humorous and kept his friendships for a very
long time. People cared about him because they knew he cared about
them."</LD>
<TE>   Born in London on July 27, 1926, Foster attended Oxford University
before immigrating to the United States in 1957. Six years later he
earned his doctorate from UCLA, the same year he accepted a teaching
position at Cal State Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   Three times chairman of the university's Academic Senate (1966-67,
1986-87 and 1987-88) as well as head of its political science
department from 1978-84, Foster quickly became active in issues
involving academic integrity and local politics. He successfully
pressed for an investigation into one department's plan to teach
profitable, though academically questionable, courses for another
university--a probe that eventually led to the demotion of two
professors and resignation of a dean.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1960s, he lobbied successfully for a controversial program
enabling students to evaluate their teachers, a process later used to
help determine which professors were promoted. And in the late 1980s,
he chaired a committee investigating turmoil in the university's
accounting department.</TE>
<TE>   Foster also became an outspoken advocate for civil rights and
opponent of the ultra right-wing John Birch Society, which he
parodied in a 1964 book called "None Dare Call It Reason."</TE>
<TE>   "He was out to show that calling Eisenhower and Shirley Temple
communists was a bit much," his widow recalled. "We used to get bomb
threats [regularly]."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, he wrote or edited several textbooks on politics and
student activism, and published a weekly political journal in
1965-66.</TE>
<TE>   Foster's teaching career was blemished in 1994 when an African
American student sued him for allegedly administering a spanking with
a ruler in exchange for permission to drop a course the student was
failing. The professor later apologized, characterizing the incident
as a nonracial "joke" that had gone too far. But he and the
university settled the lawsuit for $35,000 and Foster never taught
there again.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, his widow said, he retired to a life that included
working as a volunteer mediator and pursuing his twin loves of
racquetball and bridge. "He loved being among people," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife, Foster is survived by son Hugh Foster,
35, an Orange County photographer; and daughters Fiona Foster, 29, a
movie production coordinator in New Zealand, and Jennifer Foster, 27,
a student at Cal State Fullerton.</TE>

Hollywood freeways.</DH>

<LD>Transportation officials on Tuesday announced their top options to
alleviate congestion on the 101 Freeway: widening the roadway,
double-decking to create carpool lanes and erecting an elevated rail
line.</LD>
<LD>   Narrowed down from an earlier list of 12, one of the proposals--or
some combination of the three--will become the final strategy. That
decision could be made as early as December.</LD>
<LD>   "We have a good set of options going forward," said Laurie Newman,
senior deputy for state Sen. Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa Monica) and
chairwoman of the committee studying 40 miles of the freeway from
Thousand Oaks to downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Consisting of parts of the Ventura and Hollywood freeways, that
section of the 101 is one of the most congested corridors in
California. In the next few months, the 101 study committee--which
also includes representatives from the California Department of
Transportation, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Las
Virgenes-Malibu Council of Governments and the city and county of Los
Angeles--will seek more public feedback before reaching a decision.</TE>
<TE>   The solutions now under consideration are:</TE>
<TE>   * Widening the four-lane sections so that the entire corridor has
five lanes, plus an additional high-occupancy vehicle lane in each
direction. Estimated cost: $3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   * All of the above, plus installing a rail line down the middle.
The carpool lane and rail line could be elevated in some freeway
segments. Estimated cost: $5.7 billion to $11.8 billion, depending on
how much double-decking is required.</TE>
<TE>   * Building a second tier for carpoolers and buses only. Estimated
cost: $7.3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   All the options call for some widening of the corridor as well as
making improvements to nearby streets and to public transit.</TE>
<TE>   Officials declined to estimate how many homes and businesses would
be affected by the three plans or how long each option would take to
complete. They did say, if all goes well, groundbreaking could begin
within the decade.</TE>
<TE>   Before announcing the final three options, officials considered
such criteria as environmental impact, effectiveness in reducing
congestion, public opinion and cost.</TE>
<TE>   Plans to expand the 101 outward--and possibly skyward--are causing
an uproar among some who live near the corridor.</TE>
<TE>   "If an earthquake comes ... having a double-deck could destroy the
whole freeway," said Richard Close, president of the Sherman Oaks
Homeowners Assn. The group also opposes any widening that could bring
more traffic, noise and environmental problems into their
neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Gerald A. Silver, president of the Coalition of Freeway Residents,
said his group also strongly opposes any expansion. "It would
[destroy] hundreds of residences and businesses and thousands would
have to be relocated," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But transportation officials said they have received feedback from
more than 1,000 people in the last few months, many supporting some
expansion.</TE>
<TE>   By 2025, population along the corridor will grow by 25%, according
to projections by the Southern California Assn. of Governments, and
traffic is expected to grow accordingly.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, it takes about 80 minutes to drive from Thousand Oaks
to downtown Los Angeles during rush hour, said Tom Jenkins, vice
president of Parsons Brinckerhoff Quade &amp; Douglas Inc., a consulting
firm hired to perform the study. If nothing is done, by 2025, it
would take 99 minutes to make the trip, according to projections.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed strategies would reduce travel times by as much as 41
minutes for single drivers, 50 minutes for carpoolers and 44 minutes
for those using public transportation, Jenkins said.</TE>
<TE>   Public meetings on the options for the 101 will be held in
Calabasas, Encino and Hollywood in September. For information online,

<HD>Harry Gerstad, 93; Film Editor Won 2 Academy Awards</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Harry Gerstad, Academy Award-winning film editor for the 1949
prizefighting classic "Champion" starring Kirk Douglas and the 1952
Western epic "High Noon" starring Gary Cooper, has died. He was 93.</LD>
<LD>   Gerstad, whose Hollywood career spanned more than four decades,
died July 17 of natural causes in Palm Springs, where he had lived in
retirement since 1973.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to his Oscars, Gerstad shared with film editor Fred
Berger the American Cinema Editors Career Achievements Awards in
1997.</LD>
<TE>   Gerstad was also nominated for an ACE Eddie Award for the
television series "High Chaparral" in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   Gerstad, who moved to Hollywood with his father, a cameraman, in
1910, began his career in 1929, working for the Hal Roach Studios
laboratory, the Warner Bros. lab and Republic Pictures.</TE>
<TE>   He worked extensively with director Edward Dmytryk when he began
editing feature films in the late 1940s, and often attributed his
early success to Dmytryk. Among Gerstad's films with the director
were RKO's 1947 examination of bigotry, "Crossfire," starring Robert
Young and Robert Mitchum.</TE>
<TE>   Gerstad worked with another influential editor, Stanley Kramer, at
Columbia Pictures on such features as "Home of the Brave" in 1949;
"Cyrano de Bergerac" in 1950 and "Death of a Salesman" in 1951.</TE>
<TE>   He shared the "High Noon" editing Oscar with Elmo Williams.</TE>
<TE>   As television developed in the 1950s and 1960s, Gerstad moved
easily between the small and large screens, often in related
projects. One of those was the 1951-57 TV series "The Adventures of
Superman," starring George Reeves, and feature films made from the
television episodes.</TE>
<TE>   Gerstad also edited the early TV series "Highway Patrol," starring
Broderick Crawford, and "Ben Casey," starring Vince Edwards and Sam
Jaffe.</TE>
<TE>   Among the nearly 40 feature films Gerstad edited were "The Spiral
Staircase" in 1946, "Combat Squad" in 1953, "Five Gates to Hell" and
"Here Come the Jets" in 1959, "Walk on the Wild Side" in 1962,
"Batman" in 1966, "The Secret Life of an American Wife" in 1968, "Big
Jake" in 1971 and "Walking Tall" in 1973. His final feature editing
credit was for "Framed," released in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   From the mid-1960s until his retirement, Gerstad worked for Bing
Crosby Productions, Fox and John Wayne's Batjac Productions.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Jody. A celebration of his life will
be scheduled for November.</TE>

<HD>Shooter Was Ill, Jurors Told</HD>
<DH>Courts: Man on trial in deaths of three at an Anaheim
hospital had a breakdown and doesn't deserve death, attorney says.
Prosecution says attack was willful.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The lawyer for a man accused of killing three people during a
shooting rampage at an Anaheim hospital told jurors Monday that her
client fired the shots but is not a cold-blooded murderer.</LD>
<LD>   Dung D. Trinh was suffering a mental and physical breakdown at the
time of the shooting, his attorney said.</LD>
<LD>   The 46-year-old believed that officials at West Anaheim Medical
Center had neglected his ailing mother and hastened her death on the
morning of the Sept. 14, 1999, shooting, she said.</LD>
<TE>   During opening statements in Orange County Superior Court, Deputy
Public Defender Sharon Petrosino sought to convince jurors that Trinh
did not act out of evil intent and, consequently, does not deserve to
suffer the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Trinh's despair was heightened by the fact that the hospital could
not offer Vietnamese translators to his 72-year-old mother, Mot, the
defense lawyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Trinh's mother had died at another hospital the morning of the
shootings, but had her hip replaced at West Anaheim Medical Center
months earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Petrosino said it was then that the elderly woman's health began
to fail.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Trinh acted willfully and deliberately, loading
up on ammunition and packing two guns before security cameras taped
him walking through the hospital and firing at employees.</TE>
<TE>   "He waits for a target he wants to shoot," said Deputy Dist. Atty.
Bruce Moore.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not random. There's no argument, no dispute. He opens
with gunfire.... He shoots and he keeps on going."</TE>
<TE>   Trinh has been charged with three counts of murder, and with a
special-circumstance allegation of multiple murder in the deaths of
hospital maintenance director Ronald Robertson, 50; nurse's aide
Marlene Mustaffa, 60; and pharmacist Vincent Rosetti, 50.</TE>
<TE>   Two days after the shooting, Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony
Rackauckas announced that he planned to seek the death penalty
against Trinh--and would against anyone else who goes on a killing
rampage.</TE>
<TE>   The defense had sought to remove his office from the case,
alleging that Rackauckas had a conflict of interest because he had
visited his ill father at the same hospital two days before the
shooting.</TE>
<TE>   A judge, however, rejected that request.</TE>

<HD>Defense Contractor Is Accused of Illegal Political
Donations</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>The owner of a defense firm working on an advanced guided-missile
program was indicted Tuesday on 40 felony counts for allegedly
funneling more than $75,000 in illegal contributions to the campaigns
of four congressmen and a U.S. senator involved in awarding military
contracts.</LD>
<LD>   Parthasarathi Majumder, owner of Science and Applied Technology
Inc. of San Diego, allegedly arranged for employees and others to
make the contributions and then reimbursed them, in violation of
federal election law.</LD>
<LD>   Also, Majumder is accused of submitting phony bills to the Navy to
recoup the cost of contributions to Reps. Duncan Hunter (R-El Cajon),
Randall Cunningham (R-Escondido), John Murtha (R-Pennsylvania) and
Joe Scarborough (R-Florida), and U.S. Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.).</LD>
<TE>   The elected officials are not suspected of any wrongdoing,
according to prosecutors. The indictment also charges that Majumder
pressured employees to lie to investigators about their
contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Phillip Halpern said the case is meant to
enforce laws involving contribution limits and disclosures and also
ensure that the process of awarding government contracts is free of
favoritism.</TE>
<TE>   Majumder allegedly arranged the contributions in hopes of
influencing the officials to help him receive funding for research
and development of an improved anti-radiation guided missile that
would allow U.S. warplanes to track and destroy enemy radar, even
when it has been shut down and is not emitting signals.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1990, the firm, which has its headquarters here and its
production plant in Woodland Hills, has received $150 million from
the Department of Defense, according to an indictment handed down by
a federal grand jury.</TE>
<TE>   The missile has not yet been approved for mass production, and
Majumder, in a lawsuit filed last week against federal prosecutors,
accuses the government of trying to scuttle his invention before it
can be marketed.</TE>
<TE>   The 40 counts filed against Majumder carry a combined maximum of
98 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Cohan, Majumder's attorney, said that any violations of
campaign law were minimal and that he is astonished that the U.S.
attorney's office would jeopardize a military defense program.</TE>
<TE>   "If this program is in any way damaged, the citizens of this
country are the ones who are going to be injured," Cohan said. "Why
these prosecutors have sought to put a notch on their gun like this
is beyond me."</TE>
<TE>   As part of the investigation, federal officials allegedly found
that Majumder falsified his resume and that he does not have a
bachelor's degree in physics from Cambridge University and a
doctorate from the University of Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   Majumder, 50, of Poway pleaded innocent in federal court Tuesday
and posted $100,000 bail. The indictment was unsealed after plea
bargain talks collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   Majumder told employees that "the company's existence depended on
his ability to raise federal campaign contributions," according to
the indictment.</TE>
<TE>   Election law prohibits individual contributions of more than
$1,000 and the use of "straw" donors who are reimbursed. Inducing
others to make contributions and then paying them back is considered
campaign money laundering.</TE>
<TE>   The system being developed by Majumder's company would allow
fighter aircraft to destroy ground-to-air missile sites.</TE>

<HD>Irvine's Campaign Funds Law Is Unconstitutional</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge has declared unconstitutional an Irvine ordinance
passed in 1995 that barred independent groups from spending more than
$340 to campaign for or against a candidate.</LD>
<LD>   Irvine agreed Tuesday to stop enforcing its ordinance, which was
challenged in 1999 by the Lincoln Club of Orange County, according to
a settlement approved by U.S. District Judge Alicemarie H. Stotler.
Irvine also will pay the conservative political club $125,000 in
legal fees.</LD>
<LD>   The city's ordinance is similar to campaign restrictions in five
other Orange County cities and in the county. The Irvine law
prohibited two or more people from paying for political advertising
for or against a city candidate if any one of them had contributed
more than $340.</LD>
<TE>   The restriction affected organizations such as the Lincoln Club,
whose members pay annual dues of $2,000 and donate to federal, state
and local Republican candidates. Limiting spending on Irvine
candidates stifled free speech and free association, club president
Michael Capaldi said.</TE>
<TE>   "Quite simply, the ordinance meant that your neighbor and you
could not join forces to buy a fair-sized newspaper ad to express
your frustration with a candidate, no matter how legitimate your
grievance," he said. "... Irvine played fast and loose with its own
citizens' free-speech rights."</TE>
<TE>   The club became involved in city politics in 1990 when it spent
$25,000 on an independent campaign opposing then-Mayor Larry Agran.
Agran lost his seat but was elected to a second stint on the City
Council in 1998. He was elected mayor again in 2000 and faces
reelection in November.</TE>
<TE>   The Lincoln Club was formed in 1962 to promote Republican
candidates and conservative causes. A political action committee set
up by the club has donated to state and federal candidates, and
members are encouraged to give individually.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics have worried that the club's involvement in local
elections could inject party politics into local races that are
supposed to be nonpartisan.</TE>

<HD>Judge Tells of Police Forcing Her to Pavement</HD>
<DH>Courts: Black jurist from Virginia testifies in a
racial-profiling lawsuit against the LAPD over an incident that began
with a traffic stop.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An African American judge from Virginia who is suing the LAPD for
alleged racial profiling described in federal court Tuesday how
police ordered her out of a car at gunpoint, then forced her to lie
face down on the hot pavement while in handcuffs after a traffic stop
in Venice.</LD>
<LD>   "I was in shock," said Judge Alotha C. Willis, a former criminal
prosecutor who sits on the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court in
Portsmouth, Va.</LD>
<LD>   "It was bad enough to be forced to lay on the ground. It never
occurred to me that I would also be handcuffed," said the 43-year-old
jurist.</LD>
<TE>   Also subjected to so-called "felony prone" takedowns were Willis'
husband, Wayne Person, 50, a civilian contract manager for the Navy,
and a mutual friend, Sheryl Crayton, 52, assistant principal at a
Carson middle school, both of whom are also black.</TE>
<TE>   Person and Crayton are co-plaintiffs in the civil rights suit,
which seeks unspecified monetary damages against the officers
involved in the episode as well as top Los Angeles Police Department
officials.</TE>
<TE>   Pulled Over by Cruisers</TE>
<TE>   Crayton had just taken the visiting couple on a tour of Venice
Beach on July 3, 1999, and was driving them to a restaurant in Marina
del Rey for lunch when she was pulled over by two Los Angeles police
squad cars.</TE>
<TE>   At least nine officers and a police helicopter eventually took
part in the incident.</TE>
<TE>   Arresting officers testified that they had originally intended to
ticket Crayton for making an illegal turn onto Pacific Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   But they said they decided to execute a felony stop when a
computer check with the Department of Motor Vehicles indicated that
the license plate on Crayton's 1998 Volvo was registered to another
car.</TE>
<TE>   It later was discovered that the DMV had sent Crayton the wrong
set of plates.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the glitch was discovered, however, Willis, Person and
Crayton had been subjected to a humiliating and frightening
experience, they said. They contend that they were targeted because
they are black.</TE>
<TE>   Crayton, the first person ordered out of the car, said she looked
up and saw four police officers pointing shotguns at her.</TE>
<TE>   As they shouted at her to drop to the ground, she said, she raised
her hands and plaintively asked again and again, "What's wrong? What
did I do?" She said the only answer she got was, "Get down on the
ground."</TE>
<TE>   "I was scared, I was shocked, I just wanted to know what I did,"
she continued, wiping away tears as she recalled the incident.</TE>
<TE>   Crayton said she alternated between lying face down and trying to
sit on the dirty street, because the hot asphalt burned her skin. She
was wearing shorts and a sleeveless blouse at the time, she said. A
police report described her conduct as uncooperative.</TE>
<TE>   Frisked for Weapons</TE>
<TE>   The three plaintiffs estimated that they were on the ground about
five minutes before they were helped to their feet, still handcuffed,
and moved to a sidewalk, where they were frisked for weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Person testified that an officer who patted him down slammed his
testicles.</TE>
<TE>   At another point, he said, he tried to volunteer information but
was interrupted by a white officer who told him, "Shut up, boy. You
speak when you're spoken to. I'm the boss here." He said he took that
as a racial slur.</TE>
<TE>   However, Assistant City Atty. Don Vincent said during
cross-examination that Person did not cite the "boy" remark during an
interview by a police sergeant later that night when the plaintiff
registered a complaint about his treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Person said that after a while, another officer announced loudly
that "the DMV [messed] up." A few minutes later, officers removed
handcuffs from the trio and allowed them to leave.</TE>
<TE>   Before departing, Person testified, he turned to a white officer
and said, "You all have a problem out here. You can't stand to see
three black people driving in a decent car."</TE>
<TE>   Parks Also Testified</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the plaintiffs' attorney Stephen Yagman called former
LAPD Chief Bernard C. Parks to the stand to testify about the
department's policies regarding racial profiling.</TE>
<TE>   Parks said the officers' conduct in this case was "inappropriate"
if they ran the car's license plates only because the occupants were
people of color.</TE>
<TE>   Parks also testified that Willis' complaint prompted the
then-chief to order a review of procedures used during felony stops.
Parks said he concluded that no change in policy was required because
officers are trained to employ a range of options short of "proning
out" suspects.</TE>
<TE>   The case is being heard by a jury in the courtroom of U.S.
District Judge Christina A. Snyder.</TE>

<HD>Fire Destroys 5 Homes East of San Diego</HD>
<DH>Environment: Dozens of Julian-area residents are evacuated.
Sequoia blaze grows to 83,000 acres but is still far from ancient

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>A raging brush fire near the mountain community of Julian destroyed
five homes Tuesday and forced dozens of backwoods residents to
evacuate, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   More than 1,700 firefighters fought the blaze, which broke out
Monday afternoon and within 36 hours had burned more than 13,000
acres, much of it roadless forest with tall trees left dry and
brittle from drought.</LD>
<LD>   Although many businesses closed early and some residents left, the
fire did not appear to be threatening Julian.</LD>
<TE>   The 3,500-resident community is best known for its annual apple
festival and cozy bed-and-breakfast establishments.</TE>
<TE>   Rhonda Rapue obeyed an order by San Diego County sheriff's
deputies to evacuate. She herded her five children and one grandchild
into a van with two dogs, a cat and the family's important documents.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm worried about my kids, I'm worried about my husband, I'm
worried about Julian," she said of the town in the mountainous heart
of San Diego County. "This is a community where everybody knows
everybody."</TE>
<TE>   By nightfall Tuesday, the fire was considered only 10% contained.
Eight vehicles, three outbuildings and three recreational vehicles
were reported destroyed, in addition to the five homes.</TE>
<TE>   Only two injuries were reported, according to the California
Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.</TE>
<TE>   Officials believe that the fire may have been sparked when a
California National Guard helicopter--on a mission to find hidden
groves of marijuana plants--clipped a power line, sending sparks to
the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly looks that way," said National Guard Lt. Col. Terry
Knight. "If it is, the California National Guard will do everything
we can to make it right. We don't start fires; we support civil
authority."</TE>
<TE>   Five wolves at the California Wolf Center, a sanctuary for injured
or abandoned animals, died of smoke inhalation before the center
could be evacuated.</TE>
<TE>   Horses, dogs, cats, llamas, a cow and several parrots were rescued
by volunteers from the San Diego Humane Society facility in the area.
Several housing developments and two YMCA camps were evacuated.</TE>
<TE>   The fire broke out in the foothills of Volcan Mountain and spread
south and east as winds changed, forcing closure of California 78 and
79. The plume of dark smoke could be seen in downtown San Diego, 60
miles away.</TE>
<TE>   "We're gaining ground," said California forestry Capt. Ron
Serabia, who was coordinating nine air tankers and 11 helicopters.
"We have some of the best pilots in the world out there."</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in California, a giant blaze in Sequoia National Forest
grew to 83,000 acres Tuesday night and continued its eastward push
away from precious groves of ancient giant sequoias.</TE>
<TE>   "It's huge," said Laurel Sphar, information officer for the U.S.
Forest Service.</TE>
<TE>   That blaze, which started from a wayward campfire July 21, was
only 35% contained.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the 35,000--acre Sour Biscuit fire near California's
northern border is expected to merge Tuesday night with the massive,
145,000--acre Florence fire, which is burning in southwestern Oregon.
About 28,000 people may have to evacuate.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said that if the two blazes don't join on their own,
firefighters may try to connect them.</TE>
<TE>   "It'll be easier to manage," said Tom Valluzzi, spokesman for the
Forest Service in Oregon. Both fires started July 13.</TE>
<TE>   The Sour Biscuit fire is 30% contained, while the Florence fire is
only 2% contained.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Jessica Garrison and Associated Press
contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Latinos Finding New Home in Suburbs, Study Shows</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER Y. HONG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The rapid growth of the nation's Latino population is causing the
most change in suburbs far away from the traditional immigrant
gateways of Southern California, Texas, New York and Miami, a new
study of census data indicates.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles area continues to receive the largest number of
Latino immigrants in the country. But the growth rate of the Latino
population here now lags that of many other cities. In fact, the
growth rate for the region's Latino population was lower in the 1990s
than in the 1980s, according to the study.</LD>
<LD>   The study documents the way Latino immigration has followed a
pattern set by earlier immigrant groups: concentrating first in a
core of gateway cities, then spreading through the nation and moving
from cities to suburbs.</LD>
<TE>   At the same time, many Latino immigrants are moving directly into
burgeoning suburbs where plentiful jobs and housing lure migrants of
all backgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   In big cities with traditionally large Latino populations, Latino
immigrants accounted for 79% of the overall population rise.</TE>
<TE>   Because Latino immigrants drive much of big-city population
growth, the study reported that relatively slower Latino growth rates
"in no way means the Latino population will stabilize in those
cities."</TE>
<TE>   Rather, cities such as Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and Miami
will likely see "a continued influx of new arrivals, and a
simultaneous outflow of Latinos leaving in search of better jobs,
housing and quality of life in other destinations," the study says.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the Latinos leaving those cities are heading for suburbs.
Growth in suburban Latino populations is occurring in areas as
widespread as Little Rock, Ark., Raleigh, N.C., and Las Vegas,
according to the study released today in Washington by the Pew
Hispanic Center.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, 54% of Latinos now live in suburbs, deepening a trend
away from traditional urban centers that began in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   "Latino population growth had been thought of as a regional, urban
trend. Now we see it is national and suburban," said Roberto Suro,
director of the center and the study's primary author.</TE>
<TE>   Smaller metropolitan areas, many in the Southeast, saw the most
striking Latino growth.</TE>
<TE>   The Latino population in Raleigh, for example, multiplied nearly
12 times from 1980 to 2000. The Latino population grew roughly
tenfold during that period in Atlanta and the North Carolina cities
of Greensboro and Charlotte.</TE>
<TE>   "In the next 20 years, that's where the impact's going to be
felt," Suro said. "It's a dramatic change, and those places will be
coming to terms with a tremendous impact on things like schools and
housing."</TE>
<TE>   The changes are already affecting public life in the South, said
Jerry Gonzalez, a legislative policy analyst for the Mexican American
Legal Defense and Educational Fund in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that two Latinos are running unopposed this summer for
seats in the Georgia House of Representatives. Latino candidates also
are running for the state Senate and secretary of state, Gonzalez
said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Georgia began to include Hispanics and Asian Americans
when recording voter registration statistics by race.</TE>
<TE>   A conflict over Latino jury representation in Hall County, an
Atlanta suburb, may signal the kind of debates that may emerge along
with booming Latino populations.</TE>
<TE>   After finding that Latinos make up 17% of the county's adult
population but fewer than 3% of the jury pool, a judge ordered the
county's jury commissioners to try to increase the number of Latinos
on juries. The decision is being examined by the Georgia Supreme
Court.</TE>
<TE>   An important characteristic of the suburban areas dubbed "new
Latino destinations" in the Pew study is that the explosive Latino
growth in those areas was part of an overall jump in population. In
those areas, Latino newcomers comprised only a small portion of the
total number of new residents.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps partly because of that fact, there have been few conflicts
or overtly hostile acts against Latino immigrants in those areas.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez cited attempts by white supremacist groups to hold
anti-Latino rallies.</TE>
<TE>   "Outside-of-the-state groups try to hold them, but the local
communities ignore them," he said. "Communities overall are very
receptive. People know that metro Atlanta and Georgia would not have
seen its economic growth without immigrants."</TE>

<HD>Ex-Attorney Is Sentenced to 15 Months for Income Tax
Evasion</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former personal injury attorney has been sentenced to 15 months in
federal prison for income tax evasion.</LD>
<LD>   Derrick Anthony Hoo, 56, of Mission Hills, pleaded guilty to
failing to report $281,000 in income between 1993 and 1997.</LD>
<LD>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Alka Sagar said Hoo tried to conceal his
taxable income by paying his mortgage, car loan and other personal
expenses out of 13 client trust accounts he maintained at six banks.
He declared no taxable income in 1993, she said.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Margaret M. Morrow, in imposing the sentence
Monday, ordered Hoo to surrender to prison officials on Sept. 16.</TE>
<TE>   Hoo, who prosecutors said practiced law in Los Angeles and San
Francisco, has a previous felony conviction, was twice disciplined by
the State Bar of California in recent years and resigned from the bar
in 1999 with additional disciplinary charges pending.</TE>
<TE>   He is one of about 60 people convicted in federal court since 1997
as part of an ongoing Internal Revenue Service investigation into
income tax fraud by attorneys, doctors and others involved in filing
personal injury claims, Sagar said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Hoo pleaded no contest to two counts of forgery in L.A.
County Superior Court and was sentenced to five years of probation,
according to Jane Robison, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County
district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   A graduate of the UCLA School of Law, Hoo was admitted to the bar
in 1974. He was suspended from law practice for six months in 1995,
and then placed on three years of probation a year later.</TE>
<TE>   In that case, Hoo was disciplined by the bar for failing to
maintain adequate money in his client trust account to pay two
clients their share of a lawsuit settlement.</TE>

entry-level board, produced locally, sells for at least $100 more.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a raging debate," says Steve Pezman, publisher of the
Surfer's Journal.</TE>
<TE>   As there should be. Globalization has gone too far when a cheap
knockoff threatens the artisans and layabouts who carved their
initials in a chapter of American culture.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Richards, of Val Surf shops in the San Fernando Valley, says
it's tough to compete with "dollar-a-day labor." And surfboards are
the least of his worries. Richards says the big money is in surf
apparel and accessories, not boards, and Costco is already competing
there too.</TE>
<TE>   Some board makers and surf shop owners are gleefully sharing
stories of broken boards being lugged back to Costco for refunds.
"I've got two confirmed reports now from industry sources," Hollander
says.</TE>
<TE>   The obvious fear among independent board makers and retailers is
that Costco, advancing on coastal terrain like an insatiable,
big-footed beast out to rule the world, will crush a cottage industry
in which the art of board-making is handed down like a family secret.</TE>
<TE>   A board made overseas, by a nonsurfer, "has no soul in it," says
board maker Todd Roberts of ZJ Boarding House in Santa Monica. "It's
something we've kept in the family, and somebody sold us out."</TE>
<TE>   Some of those same passions have worked their way into the
controversy over another import--a molded board manufactured in
Thailand using a new technology. If a board is not made by hand in
Southern California, some of the high priests of surfing claim, it's
not worth having.</TE>
<TE>   But others, including Dave Hollander, who sent his crew on that
spying mission at Costco, have mixed feelings. If the discount chain
helps popularize the sport, Hollander says, everyone in the business
could benefit.</TE>
<TE>   The surfer who gets hooked on the sport with a Costco board, and
then wants to graduate to better boards and gear, is going to end up
at a bona fide surf shop, says Hollander, who owns several in L.A.
and Orange counties.</TE>
<TE>   "I know this is blasphemy, and I'm really putting my neck out
there because this is such a hot issue right now," Hollander says.
"But I'm really just being honest."</TE>
<TE>   Honest enough to also confess that he, too, thought about working
a deal to have cheap boards manufactured in Taiwan. Costco just beat
him to it.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't tell you how many people come into our Hermosa Beach shop
every Saturday and want to buy a good board they can learn on for
$250," Hollander says. "And do you know how many of those boards I
have? None."</TE>
<TE>   Costco, which could sell ice in Alaska, saw an opening and bored
in. They've got to be watched, Hollander says, because if they
attempt to devour the industry, they'll crush tradition and romance
in the process. But he's kicking himself for not beating them to the
entry-level market.</TE>
<TE>   So just how serious is Costco about surfing?</TE>
<TE>   Hard to say.</TE>
<TE>   "I imagine surfing will be just a seasonal item for them," says
Sean O'Brien of TransWorld SURF Business, a trade magazine.</TE>
<TE>   O'Brien says Costco sold surfboards last summer, too, for $199,
but they were inferior models that hadn't been special-ordered. This
time around, he says, Costco got serious and contracted with a
Taiwanese company that sells boards in Asia.</TE>
<TE>   I called Costco headquarters in Issaquah, Wash., and was told
there is no communications department.</TE>
<TE>   "The only one who talks to the press is the CEO," said a
receptionist who transferred me to Jim Sinegal's office, where a
secretary took my name and number.</TE>
<TE>   Well, does the Big Kahuna return calls, I wondered?</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes," she said.</TE>
<TE>   It was easier getting information out of the Kremlin, which
affirms my suspicion about Costco's true aim: one world, one store.</TE>

<HD>Jury Acquits Teen of Kidnapping Valley Boy, Deadlocks on
Murder</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Santa Barbara jury acquitted Graham Pressley of kidnapping Tuesday
but deadlocked on whether he participated in the fatal shooting of a
15-year-old West Hills boy in August 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Pressley, 19, of Goleta, is the third of five young men--most of
them childhood friends who met playing baseball in the west San
Fernando Valley--to stand trial in the abduction of Nicholas
Markowitz near his family's home and his shooting death two days
later in Santa Barbara County.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors will have to decide whether to retry Pressley on the
murder charge. The jury of seven men and five women voted 8 to 4 in
favor of acquittal on that count.</LD>
<TE>   "We went into it knowing that this was a very difficult case,"
said Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Ron Zonen.</TE>
<TE>   Since his arrest, Pressley has told authorities "that he feared
for his own life at all times" during the crime, said his attorney,
Deputy Public Defender Michael Ganschow.</TE>
<TE>   Markowitz was abducted near his home Aug. 6, 2000, and driven to
Santa Barbara, where he was killed two days later, authorities said.
His body was found nearly a week later by hikers.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege Pressley helped dig a shallow grave for
Markowitz near a campsite area called Lizard's Mouth and later that
night led the victim and others back to the area, where the killing
occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Zonen said he does not believe Pressley's version of events, but
to disprove that the defendant feared for his life "is very
difficult."</TE>
<TE>   Ganschow said he has already asked Santa Barbara County Superior
Court Judge William L. Gordon to dismiss the charges against his
client. Gordon set an Aug. 15 status hearing on the case.</TE>
<TE>   In November, another jury found that Ryan James Hoyt, 23, of West
Hills should be executed for shooting Markowitz nine times. Hoyt is
awaiting sentencing, as is Jesse Taylor Rugge, 22, of Santa Barbara,
who was convicted in May of kidnapping Markowitz for ransom but not
of killing him. Rugge faces life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth defendant, William Skidmore, 22, of Simi Valley, is
awaiting trial, and alleged ringleader Jesse James Hollywood, 22, of
West Hills has been charged with kidnapping and killing Markowitz,
but he has eluded authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say Hollywood orchestrated the abduction because
Markowitz's half brother, Benjamin, 24, owed him $1,200 for drugs.</TE>
<TE>   They say Hollywood later ordered Markowitz killed after learning
from his attorney the severe penalty for kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>   At his murder trial, Hoyt testified that he didn't shoot
Markowitz, contradicting a videotaped statement he made to police
shortly after his August 2000 arrest. In the taped interview, Hoyt
told detectives, "The only thing I did was kill him."</TE>
<TE>   Rugge testified at his trial that Hoyt forced him and Pressley to
go the campsite and that neither wanted Markowitz to be killed.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Searchers on Tuesday rescued an off-road enthusiast lost since
Saturday in the Angeles National Forest.</LD>
<LD>   A sheriff's helicopter crew spotted Tom Hines, 40, about noon on
Tuesday wandering near a mountain ridge several miles north of
Castaic, according to Lt. Scott Young of the Santa Clarita sheriff's
station.</LD>
<LD>   Hines, who was in good condition, was reunited with his wife at
the sheriff's station, Young said.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities said Hines, a Castaic resident, left in his pickup on
Saturday and headed to the forest for some off-road driving.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday morning, Hines' wife told authorities her husband had
called her on his cell phone to report he was lost in the forest
without water, Lt. Steve Dolan said.</TE>
<TE>   More than 25 rescue workers, including search teams from Malibu,
Monrovia and Crescenta Valley, helped with the search, Young said.</TE>

<HD>Files on 8 Priests Are Demanded</HD>
<DH>Grand jury: Archdiocese says it will comply with third set
of subpoenas in sexual abuse inquiry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutors have turned to the grand jury for a third time to issue
new subpoenas to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles,
demanding personnel records of priests under investigation for
alleged sexual abuse of minors.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities served eight subpoenas Monday, archdiocesan officials
confirmed. The new subpoenas raise the number of current or former
clerics whose files have been sought by the district attorney's
office to 17.</LD>
<LD>   The church will surrender the requested documents, said Michael
Hennigan, an attorney for the archdiocese, which covers Los Angeles,
Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.</LD>
<TE>   The latest subpoenas come as the number of the archdiocese's
current and former priests under investigation by law enforcement
stands at more than 70. Investigators estimate that there are more
than 120 alleged victims.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Police Department and Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department investigators said they believe that about 15 of their
cases can be prosecuted, based on the evidence they have so far.</TE>
<TE>   "That number wouldn't surprise me," Hennigan said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators face the task of overcoming a 10-year statute of
limitations on older cases. The statute does not apply to the most
serious sex crimes.</TE>
<TE>   "The key is whether enough happened and whether we can prove it,"
said Sgt. Dan Scott of the sheriff's Family Crimes Unit, which is
investigating 23 priests.</TE>
<TE>   Criminal charges may not be filed before early September, about
the same time as the planned opening of the Cathedral of Our Lady of
the Angels in downtown Los Angeles, law enforcement officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators and prosecutors said they need to review thousands
of pages of documents from the archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   "These cases are difficult. Some of the cases date back 30 or even
40 years," said Lt. Daniel Mulrenin, who oversees the LAPD's Sexually
Exploited Child Unit. "Once charges are filed, we expect many more
victims to come forward."</TE>
<TE>   The documents sought by prosecutors are tangled up in closed-door
court proceedings while a judge weighs objections by Donald Steier,
an attorney for some of the priests.</TE>
<TE>   When Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley first turned to the grand jury last
month for files on three priests, archdiocesan attorneys agreed to
hand over the documents. But Steier sought to block the transfer to
protect the priests' privacy. Some of the files, he said, included
medical records and statements to therapists.</TE>
<TE>   A court-appointed official, known as a special master, is
reviewing each page to decide whether its release to authorities
would violate the priests' rights, Steier said. The retired judge was
selected by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Dan Oki.</TE>
<TE>   "They have got another 20 in line, as I understand," Steier said
of the grand jury subpoenas. "I am not going to hold back. If the
government wants a document it is not entitled to receive, I am going
to object."</TE>
<TE>   Hennigan, the archdiocesan attorney, said the church has been
served with three sets of subpoenas and has complied with each
request.</TE>
<TE>   He said he received subpoenas June 12 for the records of three
priests. The archdiocese was served with subpoenas two weeks ago for
six more files and then the additional eight Monday. Hennigan said
the archdiocese has turned over personnel files, as well as so-called
C files, which contain sensitive allegations.</TE>
<TE>   The June 12 subpoenas named Michael Stephen Baker, a defrocked
priest, Father Michael Wempe and Father David Granadino. Cardinal
Roger M. Mahony transferred Baker to several parishes after the
priest told him in 1986 that he had molested young boys. Mahony later
approved a $1.3-million settlement with two men who had allegedly
been abused by Baker.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Mahony ordered the removal of seven accused
priests from the ministry, drawing the attention of police and
prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles police are examining allegations by more than 70
alleged victims involving about 40 living priests and as many as 10
dead clerics, Mulrenin said. The Sexually Exploited Child Unit, he
said, has increased the number of investigators assigned to the
inquiry from six to nine. Three other detectives may join the
investigation in coming weeks, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Archdiocesan officials say none of the accused priests is in
active ministry.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony, archbishop since 1985, adopted a zero-tolerance abuse
policy for priests earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   That policy is more strict than the one he adopted in 1992, which
set zero tolerance for new allegations of abuse but did not oust some
clerics with prior allegations who had received psychological
treatment, church officials said.</TE>

<LD>Orange County prosecutors filed charges Tuesday against two suspected
auto thieves who were shot and wounded by Tustin police last week
after authorities said the pair tried to hit investigators with their
car.</LD>
<LD>   Alberto Santiago, 42, of Santa Ana was accused of assault with a
deadly weapon against a police officer, auto theft, evading arrest
and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. He remains in custody
in lieu of $50,000 bail.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors also charged a 16-year-old Santa Ana boy with assault
with a deadly weapon against a police officer, conspiracy to commit
auto theft, evading arrest, driving without a license and reckless
driving. The youth will be prosecuted in Juvenile Court.</LD>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Heidi Winer alleges that on the evening of July
25, Santiago and the youth tried to run down several officers
investigating the theft of a 1984 Toyota Celica.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said police feared for their safety and opened fire.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted on all counts, Santiago and the 16-year-old could be
sentenced to more than six years in prison. Assault with a deadly
weapon on a police officer, evading arrest and auto theft are
felonies. The remaining charges are misdemeanors.</TE>

<LD>An engine failed on a Delta Air Lines Boeing 757 during takeoff from
John Wayne Airport on Tuesday, forcing the pilots to make an
emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport, authorities
said.</LD>
<LD>   Flight 1938 to Atlanta, carrying 159 passengers and a crew of
eight, landed safely about 9:03 a.m. No one was injured. The
airliner's scheduled departure from Orange County was 8:45 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   The twin-engine jetliner had just taken off when the pilot
reported that an engine had failed, said Los Angeles airport
spokesman Tom Winfrey. Anthony Black, a Delta official, said he was
unsure why the engine on the right wing stalled.</LD>
<TE>   The plane was diverted to LAX, 35 miles northwest of John Wayne,
and emergency equipment was deployed as a precaution, Winfrey said.</TE>

working together to buy a parcel to serve both their needs.</LD>
<LD>   Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified will get a middle school to help
relieve overcrowding, and the Orange County Water District will get a
percolation basin to add enough water for 20,000 households.</LD>
<LD>   "This presents a tremendous opportunity for a partnership with
benefits to both of our organizations," said Placentia-Yorba Linda
Unified Supt. Dennis Smith.</LD>
<TE>   Jerry A. King, president of the Orange County Water District
board, said the project "sets a standard that I hope all other public
agencies will follow."</TE>
<TE>   The two agencies began working together after discovering that
they were both looking at the same parcel in Placentia's La Jolla
area. Negotiators are finalizing an agreement to share the space.</TE>

<LD>A couple guys were waiting at a bus stop in Orange County, when one
of them muttered to the other:</LD>
<LD>   "What do they take us for, a bunch of saps?"</LD>
<LD>   "No kidding. I can't stand to be yanked around like this."</LD>
<TE>   "Can you believe the bill of goods they're selling? They must
think we're all fools. Or infants."</TE>
<TE>   "In the words of P.T. Barnum, there's a sucker born every minute."</TE>
<TE>   "I thought that was Thomas Jefferson."</TE>
<TE>   "No, Jefferson said all men are created equal. But don't get me
off-track."</TE>
<TE>   "Sorry, it's just that it's insulting to our intelligence--all
this talk about a Great Park."</TE>
<TE>   "Come on, now, Edison Field is a good ballpark, but not a great
one. If you're talking Fenway Park ... now that's a great park."</TE>
<TE>   "What's the matter with you? I'm talking about the old El Toro
Marine base being turned into a giant park, like Central Park in New
York. The city of Irvine says it's going to do it. Don't you read the
papers?"</TE>
<TE>   "Just the sports section. I hadn't heard anything about a Great
Park. I thought you were talking about the Angels. People with short
memories are saying they have a good enough team to go to the World
Series."</TE>
<TE>   "Why? Did the Yankees go on strike?"</TE>
<TE>   "No, but the Angels are pretty decent. They have the fourth-best
record in baseball. Surely you've heard about their good-luck charm,
the Rally Monkey."</TE>
<TE>   "Uh, sorry. News to me. But it sounds like you have plenty to be
excited about."</TE>
<TE>   "Tell me about excited. I was here in 1995 when they were
something like 10 games in front, and that was late August. They went
into the tank faster than Flipper at feeding time. I didn't come out
of that funk for months. I'm not buying it again."</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, pal, wake up. People love to sell you the dream. It's called
bait-and-switch. Oldest trick in the book. Take this Great Park
thing."</TE>
<TE>   "Sounds like a good idea. What's wrong with a park?"</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing, but this would be the Taj Mahal of parks. They ran it up
the flagpole as a way to kill off a new airport, and it worked. Now,
people are going to find out it'll never happen."</TE>
<TE>   "How do you know?"</TE>
<TE>   "Because that's the way things work around here. We talk big, but
nothing happens."</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, you're talking to an Angels fan. Don't get me started on
hopes and dreams. I remember Kent Bottenfield and Mo Vaughn. Besides,
I was there in '86 when we were one out away from the World Series."</TE>
<TE>   "Does the past always foretell the future?"</TE>
<TE>   "Do I look like Nostradamus? But, yes, certain things are
predictable, like the Angels breaking your heart. It's a law of
nature."</TE>
<TE>   "Exactly. Like people eventually deciding that houses and stores
would look better at El Toro than grass and duck ponds and museums?"</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know from duck ponds, but maybe you ought to think
positive. They could pull it off."</TE>
<TE>   "Look who's talking, Mr. Negative. This park is going to take a
commitment for years, not only of people but of money. Do you have
any idea how much it'll cost to clean up the toxic chemicals buried
out there?"</TE>
<TE>   "As much as three or four free agents, huh?"</TE>
<TE>   "More like 30 or 40."</TE>
<TE>   "So, you feel you've been had?"</TE>
<TE>   "Nope. I knew it was a trick. They lured us in to kill off the
airport, and now they're playing us for rubes."</TE>
<TE>   "I hear you, brother. The Angels are pulling the same stunt. I
guess you can fool the people all of the time. But you shouldn't give
up on the park. I'll even give you an idea for a way to sell it."</TE>
<TE>   "OK, I'll bite. What is it?"</TE>
<TE>   "Did I mention the Rally Monkey?"</TE>

<HD>New Centers to Serve Preschoolers and Families</HD>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thousand Oaks will launch an early childhood education program in
September aimed at children who might not otherwise have the
opportunity to attend preschool.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to four preschools, the Conejo Valley Neighborhood
Learning Center will open four family resource centers, which will
direct families to health and dental care, parenting classes and
other services, center Director Brenda Hunter said.</LD>
<LD>   The preschool programs and resource centers will be available to
all families but may prove especially valuable to low- and
moderate-income families and those with limited English skills,
officials said. Preschool enrollment will be offered on a
sliding-scale rate.</LD>
<TE>   The learning center was organized nine months ago by local
educators, Thousand Oaks officials and county Supervisor Frank
Schillo's office to develop a plan for spending a three-year,
$1.7-million grant awarded under the state tobacco tax program.</TE>
<TE>   That funding was generated by Proposition 10, the early childhood
education initiative approved by California voters in 1998. Grants of
varying amounts have been awarded to organizations representing 11
other areas in the county, said Jamie Cook-Tate, coordinator of the
First Five Ventura County Commission, which evaluates the grant
applications and distributes the money.</TE>
<TE>   Preschool programs also will be offered at neighborhood centers
serving Moorpark-Simi Valley, Oak Park, Oxnard, Ocean View,
Hueneme-South Oxnard, Rio, Ventura and Santa Clara Valley.</TE>
<TE>   In the Conejo Valley, the preschool and family resource sites will
open at the Conejo Creek Condominiums in Newbury Park, Manzanita
Elementary School in Newbury Park and Conejo and Park Oaks elementary
schools in Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   Parents attending a kickoff picnic Aug. 18 will be able to
register their children for the preschool programs. The picnic is
scheduled from 1 to 4 p.m. at Crowley House, 2522 Pleasant Way,
Thousand Oaks.</TE>

<HD>Planning Simmers in 'Hot Spot' for Species</HD>
<DH>Development: A proposal to balance environmentalists',
builders' concerns will be tested in Rancho Mission Viejo, where
14,000 homes may rise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is the last swath of privately owned open land in south Orange
County, branded by activists as one of 25 global "hot spots" critical
to maintaining a diverse array of plant and animal species. The
22,850-acre Rancho Mission Viejo also may be the last great hope for
a sweeping land-use experiment intended to balance endangered-species
preservation with landowner rights, say those hammering out a plan
for the land they hope will be used as a model statewide.</LD>
<LD>   The intent of Natural Communities Conservation Planning is to
prevent environmental conflicts like those over the northern spotted
owl in the Pacific Northwest.</LD>
<LD>   Under the voluntary program, landowners agree to spare large
tracts of their land so ecosystems can be saved. In exchange, state
and federal wildlife agencies agree to let the owners develop other
areas, even if they are homes to endangered species.</LD>
<TE>   But most environmentalists, planners and developers say the
program remains unproven 10 years after a pilot version was launched
in Southern California. And unless participants settle a dispute over
development of sensitive areas of Rancho Mission Viejo, the plan may
be seriously set back, the observers say.</TE>
<TE>   The program was launched in 1991 by then-Gov. Pete Wilson's
administration to save rapidly disappearing coastal sage scrub
ecosystems that are unique to Southern California and parts of
Mexico; these areas are full of rare native species like
gnatcatchers.</TE>
<TE>   With gnatcatchers living on as much as 350,000 acres of private
land in Southern California, the proposed listing of the bird as
endangered in the early 1990s threatened to tie up many private and
public projects indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   Only two large land-use plans have been created under the program.
One is on Irvine Co. property in central Orange County, where most of
the preserve land was set aside before the program existed. Another
is on property fragmented among several owners in western San Diego
County.</TE>
<TE>   A report last year by the California Research Bureau, a
nonpartisan state agency that prepares studies for elected officials,
faulted the program for lacking clear scientific standards. The
bureau found that wildlife agencies are also hamstrung by inadequate
funding, as well as by the absence of reliable data on the ecosystems
and species the program is meant to protect. A new law is designed to
remedy these gaps as planning expands statewide. "We think the jury
is still out" on the effectiveness of the program, said Kip Lipper,
chief of staff for state Sen. Byron Sher (D-Stanford), who ordered
the report. "It's still unclear if it protects the environment as
well as use of the Endangered Species Act in the traditional way," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Sher had argued for years against expanding the program outside
Southern California, saying that it tips the scale too far in favor
of development interests. Yet as part of the deal-making to get more
environmental assurances into the program, Sher wrote the law that
adds standards but also brings the plan to other parts of the state.</TE>
<TE>   State wildlife officials, on the other hand, worry that writing in
too many requirements could ultimately harm their ability to cut
deals that protect the environment. "Each jurisdiction has its own
set of circumstances and economic needs, and we need to work them
out," said Gail Presley, statewide regional conservation planner for
the Department of Fish and Game. The department is moving to create
new planning districts under the program in the Sierra Nevada
foothills, along the north coast, and in two dozen other
environmental battlegrounds.</TE>
<TE>   The O'Neill family, which owns Rancho Mission Viejo, signed onto
the program in the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Now the family wants to complete the build-out in one stroke. They
say they want to create a project that preserves habitat corridors
and a working cattle ranch on the land without going bankrupt in the
process.</TE>
<TE>   The ranch is a perfect testing ground for the planning process:
the land has a single owner, the century-old, family-owned ranch is
not fragmented by zoning, and it is smack in the path of growth.</TE>
<TE>   "This piece of land is a blank canvas where the departments can
show what the program will do and what it will not do," said Dan
Silver, coordinator of the Endangered Habitats League, a Los
Angeles-based environmental group.</TE>
<TE>   The Endangered Habitats League, Audubon California, the Natural
Resources Defense Council and other mainstream environmental groups
crucial to the Natural Communities Conservation Planning program's
survival say they will work to dismantle the ranch's plan if it
destroys too much habitat.</TE>
<TE>   Landowners say they are prepared to withdraw if the agencies
cannot come up with a plan that promises the Rancho Mission Viejo
company that there will be no backtracking once a deal is
reached--especially if species living in areas approved for
development are later added to the endangered-species list.</TE>
<TE>   Things have not gotten off to the most promising start at the
ranch.</TE>
<TE>   Rancho Mission Viejo company officials want to build 14,000 homes
on its more than 22,000 acres, a number environmentalists say would
be disastrous.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists are particularly determined to block building on
3,000 acres in a northern portion of the ranch that's full of
endangered gnatcatchers and adjoins an existing 1,182-acre preserve.
In Chiquita Canyon, cattle graze creek-side among citrus trees and
expanses of coastal sage scrub.</TE>
<TE>   Rancho Mission Viejo Vice President Richard Broming said the
company's proposal protects about three-quarters of the gnatcatchers
on the ranch, consistent with plans approved on other properties
where the birds live.</TE>
<TE>   And Broming says the branding of his company's property--and not
the property around it--as a global biological "hot spot" is
propaganda manufactured by environmentalists.</TE>
<TE>   But Chiquita Canyon is just one of the potential deal-breakers
that state and federal wildlife agencies must navigate in crafting a
plan. The agencies are scheduled to share their proposed development
alternatives for the ranch in the near future.</TE>
<TE>   "We will be able to tell from the partial reserve plans they
propose if this program even has a chance of making it in the rest of
the state," said Andrew Wetzler, a Natural Resources Defense Council
attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the Sierra Club say they are so far unimpressed
with the government's ability to broker land-use plans. They are
refusing to participate in the program anywhere in the state because
they feel it doesn't do enough to protect the environment.</TE>
<TE>   They want more standards, more assurances that species will not
disappear, and want to reserve their right to file lawsuits when
necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Their proposal for Rancho Mission Viejo? Scrape together enough
public and private money to buy the entire 22,850-acre property
outright.</TE>
<TE>   Other environmentalists say that's a great idea with one problem:
The money isn't available.</TE>
<TE>   Like it or not, they say, the Natural Communities Conservation
Planning process offers the best chance to keep fragile ecosystems
intact.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to stand by on principle while Rome burns," said
Pete DeSimone, director of sanctuaries and stewardship for Audubon
California. "This is the best deal we've got going. We have the
opportunity to do something precedent-setting."</TE>

<HD>Torrance Rapist Strikes Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA MURILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A man wanted for rape and kidnapping in Torrance has struck again.
This time, a 16-year-old girl on her way to work Monday afternoon was
attacked, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   She was the second woman in less than a month to be assaulted by
the man, who police say engages women in conversation to lure them to
his car and then brandishes a handgun.</LD>
<LD>   Two other women were able to run away from the rapist on July 4
and July 22. Torrance police warned that the man has targeted women
throughout the city.</LD>
<TE>   "The way it looks is that they're all random victims at random
locations," Lt. Patrick Shortall said. "I think the key is to be
aware of your surroundings and be on the lookout for suspicious
behavior."</TE>
<TE>   The incidents occurred in residential and commercial areas. Except
for the attempted kidnapping at 10 p.m. July 22, all of the attacks
took place in daylight hours. In the first three crimes, the man
carried a handgun, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The rapist gets the women close enough to his car to scare them
with his gun and then kidnaps them, Shortall said. The man does not
drive them very far, but police would not say if the women were raped
inside his vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   All of the victims, who range in age from their late teens to
early 30s, were walking alone when they were confronted. They do not
share any specific physical characteristics, police said. "It's not
like he's into redheads or blonds or a certain type," Shortall said.</TE>
<TE>   The assailant is described as African American, 23 to 40 years
old, with a stocky build, shaved head and light mustache. Two
vehicles have been used in the crimes--a compact silver car and a
white van.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information is asked to call the Torrance Police
Department at (310) 618-5586 or (310) 328-3456.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A mother's plea for a criminal investigation into the death of her
son--whose life ended while he was in the Los Angeles County foster
care system--Tuesday elicited a trembling and tearful apology from
county Supervisor Gloria Molina, who pledged to demand answers from
county officials about what happened.</LD>
<LD>   Hours later, Molina and her colleagues approved a $1-million
settlement in the lawsuit brought over the boy's death.</LD>
<LD>   Molina's remarks and the board action followed an emotional appeal
by the boy's mother.</LD>
<TE>   Debra Reid, 44, entered the hearing room grim-faced, flanked by
eight family members dressed in black. At her side was her son
Debvin, who was placed in foster care for 15 months in 1997. His
older brother, Jonathan, was taken away at the same time. The
children were taken from their mother after social workers concluded
that she was unstable and not tending properly to their medical
needs.</TE>
<TE>   But Jonathan died six weeks after being placed in foster care,
where social workers, by the county's admission, failed to inform
medical workers of his severe asthma. Reid has been fighting the
county in the courts ever since.</TE>
<TE>   "This is five years in coming," Reid began.</TE>
<TE>   Racked with sobs, Reid recalled how she begged social workers to
treat Jonathan's asthma. Social workers had dismissed Reid's account
of the severity of the child's asthma, county officials acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   "They said my child was healthy," Reid told the board. "Well, that
child now lies in an Inglewood cemetery."</TE>
<TE>   None of the social workers has been disciplined in the case,
county officials said. Reid begged supervisors to launch a criminal
investigation, alleging that social workers had falsified reports to
take the boy from her.</TE>
<TE>   "We have sought true justice and we have not received it until
someone sends this case for criminal investigation," Reid said. "All
we have received is a payoff, and we're not satisfied with a payoff.</TE>
<TE>   "Not one person from the county," Reid said, "has bothered to
apologize."</TE>
<TE>   Reid's appeal to the board is one of many that the supervisors
have heard involving the foster care system.</TE>
<TE>   Virtually every week, a parade of parents come before the
supervisors, pleading for help in getting their children out of that
system. Most weeks, they leave empty-handed, as supervisors insist
that they cannot involve themselves in matters that are before the
courts. The pleas often meet with indifference from county officials,
who typically talk among themselves as parents address the
supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday was different.</TE>
<TE>   As Reid spoke, the hearing room went silent. Aides and department
heads dabbed at tears. In an adjacent chamber where county
administrators eat snacks and drink coffee, all movement ceased.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke asked Reid whether she was
satisfied with the settlement. After conferring with her attorney,
Reid said she was, but reiterated her call for justice.</TE>
<TE>   Then Molina spoke, her voice trembling, her eyes watering.</TE>
<TE>   She recalled how supervisors routinely rebuff requests for help in
foster care cases, and how she had told a congresswoman pleading on
Reid's behalf that she had to trust the courts to do the right thing.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know that my apology to you will help you at all," Molina
said. "I can only say I apologize for not being more attentive."</TE>
<TE>   Promising to personally pursue the issue, Molina said, "We've got
to really take the gloves off on this thing, because this is a real
battle. If that department [the Department of Children and Family
Services] could not protect those children, then we should not be
empowering that department to carry out this work."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Mike Antonovich quickly added his apology. Supervisor
Zev Yaroslavsky said the whole board apologized for what happened to
Jonathan.</TE>
<TE>   After the meeting, Reid said Molina's apology "meant a lot. She
was sincere. That is the first sign of remorse I have seen in the
county."</TE>
<TE>   Reid said Tuesday's hearing and the conclusion of two civil cases
filed over Jonathan's death and Debvin's placement in foster care
were gratifying milestones in her family's quest for justice.</TE>
<TE>   The determination to press for further action on Jonathan's death
has occupied Reid and her family for years, she said Tuesday. At each
step of the way, nine family members have gathered to vote on
strategic decisions about how to pursue the case, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, the family has turned to one lawyer after
another--seven in all.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time a lawyer didn't believe in me or in this case we got
rid of them," Reid said. "Jonathan is still very much a part of this
family."</TE>

<LD>A 14-year-old Macdoel girl thought to have been kidnapped Friday by
her ex-boyfriend was found safe Monday afternoon at a Sacramento
motel, the Siskiyou County Sheriff's Department said.</LD>
<LD>   Sandra Luna was picked up by Sacramento police after she called
her mother to tell her where she was, sheriff's officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The girl allegedly was taken from her home by her ex-boyfriend,
Hector Rivera, 19. Family members told police that Rivera had become
possessive of the girl in the last few weeks. Officers have been
interviewing the girl to determine her well-being and the
circumstances in which she left home.</LD>
<TE>   Rivera is being held on two outstanding misdemeanor warrants from
Siskiyou County, and may face other charges, depending on the
circumstances of the girl's disappearance, authorities said.</TE>

<HD>Scenic Trail to Connect Capital Cities of 2 States</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>People may soon be able to hike, bike or ride horseback on a new
scenic trail connecting the capital cities of California and Nevada.</LD>
<LD>   Placer County officials are planning a trail that would cover
about 100 miles along the north fork of the American River,
stretching from the American River Parkway in Sacramento to Squaw
Valley in Lake Tahoe. From there, it would connect to the Tahoe Rim
Trail and then the Ash Canyon Trail, ending up in Carson City.</LD>
<LD>   The result is what officials plan to call the "Capital to Capital
Regional Trail System." The project would be carried out in three
phases and could take 10 years to complete. So far, only a portion of
the $2 million needed to complete the first phase, from Lake
Clementine in Auburn to Ponderosa Bridge in Colfax, has been
acquired. Planners hope to create a multipurpose trail that would
also include beaches for fishing, boating and other water recreation.</LD>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The endangered Western snowy plover is apparently making a comeback.</LD>
<LD>   Halfway through the shore bird's breeding season, state parks
officials said they are encouraged by signs that more plover chicks
may reach adulthood at the Oceano Dunes this year.</LD>
<LD>   Surveys conducted by ecologists at Oceano Dunes State Vehicular
Recreation Area show at least 50 plover chicks were hatched this year
and 20 have reached fledgling age--when they are capable of flying.</LD>
<TE>   Last season brought a high number of deaths among fledgling
plovers because of predators such as loggerhead shrikes, a species
known as the "butcher bird" for the way it impales its prey on its
beak. Last year, only two plover chicks reached the fledgling stage.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, shrikes easily killed off plover fledglings by perching
on fence posts of enclosures meant to protect the plover nests. This
year, the fencing has been modified according to recommendations by
experts at the Point Reyes National Bird Observatory and the
California Coastal Commission.</TE>

<HD>Hopefuls Start Run for Hollywood City Offices</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first prospective candidates for a Hollywood city council picked
up petitions Tuesday, after the Board of Supervisors formally placed
the secession measure for the region on the Nov. 5 ballot.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles County board's routine action Tuesday opened the
filing period for council candidates, but only five people have begun
the process of qualifying for the election. Secessionists said they
expect many more contenders for the five seats to emerge before the
Aug. 9 filing deadline.</LD>
<LD>   "There are many good candidates who have been waiting for today
and will now be able to file papers to run," said Ferris Wehbe, a
board member of the Hollywood Independence Committee. He said he
knows of 11 people seriously considering a run for council.</LD>
<TE>   The San Fernando Valley secession measure, which is on the same
ballot, has attracted 61 prospective candidates for mayor and 14
council seats. The most prominent declared candidate is Assemblyman
Keith Richman (R-Northridge), who said he intends to file papers to
run for Valley mayor.</TE>
<TE>   Only one Valley nominating petition had been turned in as of
Tuesday. The filing deadline for the Valley offices is also Aug. 9.</TE>
<TE>   Secession leaders hope a large number of candidates will help the
breakup campaigns deliver their message that smaller government is
better. They initially predicted a field of about 150 candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Flower shop owner Garry K. Sinanian is among those who picked up a
petition for the Hollywood council.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very unfortunate, but true, that for decades Hollywood has
been neglected," Sinanian said. "We have a tremendous amount of
potential."</TE>
<TE>   Studio prop maker Eric F. De Young, hotel manager Jeff M.
Zarrinnam, and David L. Lynch and Scott A. Wengel, whose occupations
were not available, also picked up petitions.</TE>
<TE>   Because the Local Agency Formation Commission, the state panel
charged with analyzing breakup proposals, determined that a Hollywood
city would be financially viable, the supervisors were required to
put the secession measure on the ballot. The board's vote was
unanimous and came without discussion.</TE>
<TE>   Soon afterward, Los Angeles City Councilmen Eric Garcetti and Tom
LaBonge, who represent parts of Hollywood, filed papers to create an
anti-secession committee, called I Love L.A. Several other City
Council members have launched similar committees, and Mayor James K.
Hahn is spearheading his own effort against secession.</TE>
<TE>   Valley secessionists, who asked not to be named, said they will
file a formal complaint alleging that Hahn and other Los Angeles
officials are illegally using city resources and time to campaign
against a breakup. The complaint would be lodged with the city Ethics
Commission and the state Fair Political Practices Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood secessionists filed such a complaint with the city
commission earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn and other city officials have denied that they are
campaigning at taxpayers' expense.</TE>

<HD>County Board Puts Measure to Fund Emergency Care on

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Over the protests of critics who said they were moving too quickly
and placing an unfair burden on businesses, the Los Angeles County
Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to put on the November ballot a
measure that would help fund the emergency health-care system with a
tax on developed properties.</LD>
<LD>   By a 3-2 vote, the board approved Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky's
motion to raise a projected $168 million a year for hospitals that
provide trauma and emergency care with a tax on developed properties
of 3 cents per square foot.</LD>
<LD>   The vote followed a debate in which the motion was cast by
supporters as courageous and by critics as irresponsible and
potentially damaging to the local economy.</LD>
<TE>   "We are faced with the potential collapse of the county's trauma
system," Yaroslavsky said as he introduced the motion. "This isn't
about the uninsured. This isn't about just the poor. This is about
every one of us."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Gloria Molina said that placing the measure on the
ballot would be "one of the boldest moves that this Board of
Supervisors has ever made." She acknowledged that a tax hike could be
unpopular with voters, who must give the proposed levy their
two-thirds approval for it to take effect.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just taking a chance that there are going to be voters out
there that understand and respect this issue," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But opponents complained that the levy was being rushed onto the
ballot and would remain in place indefinitely, since it does not
specify a period for which it would remain in place.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not quite sure that we have done enough to give [voters] a
fair analysis of this whole process," said Supervisor Don Knabe.
"There is no oversight committee, there is no finite period of time.
It's an escalator that could go on forever."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who with Knabe voted against the
proposal, added that the tax was unfair because it would not be borne
by all residents. The tax, he said, "is targeting a select group of
people--those who own property."</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of businesses also objected, saying that it would
substantially increase their costs.</TE>
<TE>   Victor Franco, who addressed the board on behalf of the 300-member
Central City Assn., said the association already pays more than
$300,000 a year in assessments, taxes and bond payments on its
20-story building in downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like adding insult to injury at this point," he said.</TE>
<TE>   According to a preliminary estimate by the county assessor's
office, the tax would raise $116 million from residential properties
and $52 million from commercial properties. Some earlier estimates
indicated that the tax could raise as much as $175 million, but those
were scaled down slightly in the final proposal submitted to the
board.</TE>
<TE>   The adjustments reflected slight changes in the kinds of property
that would be covered by the tax. Specifically, the tax, even if
approved by voters, would not apply to vacant lots, yards and parking
structures--reducing the overall square footage covered and shrinking
the revenue projection.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Yvonne Braithwaite Burke said she supported the measure
because it addresses an emergency. She introduced an amendment
allowing the board to rescind the tax should other money become
available for the county's ailing public health system.</TE>
<TE>   "This body at any time can put the pressure back on the
Legislature," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The board will consider next week an alternate measure by
Antonovich that would raise money from taxpayers willing to assist
the trauma and emergency care system with a voluntary $45 fee.</TE>

<HD>A Dry Summer for Teen Jobs</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ashley Nacole Webb of Oxnard wanted to spend her summer earning
money. Instead, the 17-year-old spent more than half her vacation
just looking for work.</LD>
<LD>   "It has been frustrating," said Ashley, who may have finally
landed a job at a Boys &amp; Girls Club that could start in two weeks.
"Summer is almost over."</LD>
<LD>   It's been a tough summer for job-seeking teenagers. Unemployment
in Ventura County is higher than it was at this time last year, and
directors of youth job programs said employers, still skeptical about
the country's economic recovery, are reluctant to hire more workers.</LD>
<TE>   In addition, a countywide program cut the number of youths it
places in subsidized jobs each year from 1,000 to less than 500.</TE>
<TE>   And for some teens, the work that is available--primarily
minimum-wage retail and fast-food jobs--isn't good enough. They would
rather go without a job than sell hamburgers.</TE>
<TE>   Ashley wasn't picky. Eager to get her first job to earn spending
money, the Oxnard High School senior started looking before vacation
started June 14, enlisting the help of the county's Workforce
Administration youth program.</TE>
<TE>   "I told them I could do anything," she said. "There was just
nothing."</TE>
<TE>   Hector Medina started his search in March. The 17-year-old walked
into supermarkets, fast-food restaurants and retail stores in hopes
of landing a job to help his family pay bills and give him some
spending money.</TE>
<TE>   Most employers told him they weren't hiring. Two gave him
interviews, but nothing came of them. Finally, three months ago, with
the help of Workforce Administration, he got a job washing dishes
weekend nights at Sandy's Steak &amp; Seafood in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   The experience has convinced Hector, a senior at Gateway Community
School in Camarillo, to stay in school and train to become a
paralegal.</TE>
<TE>   Low-income, high-risk students can get help from Summer Jobs Plus,
which is run by the county superintendent of schools office. The
program finds jobs, primarily in public agencies, and pays the teens
minimum wage of $6.75 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   But three years ago, federally mandated changes required that the
program provide help all year, rather than just during the summer. So
it now serves far fewer students, said Ruben Reyes, coordinator of
the Ventura-based program. While the program previously placed 1,000
kids in jobs each summer, it is only serving 435 now.</TE>
<TE>   To help teens turned away by Summer Jobs Plus, the county's
Workforce Administration staff started a program in June called
Summer Jobs for Youth and More, said Youth Services Manager Frank
Ramirez. Without the money to subsidize jobs, Ramirez has been
looking to the private sector.</TE>
<TE>   He has identified 150 jobs, but most of them are minimum-wage
fast-food and retail jobs. Better jobs go to older people with more
experience, he said.</TE>
<TE>   While Ramirez encourages his young clients to take the entry-level
positions so they can get experience that can help them land better
jobs, only 25 have accepted. Eighty others are holding out for
something better.</TE>
<TE>   "I think teens now are more selective," said Ramirez, adding that
some who get money from their parents don't feel desperate enough to
take the jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez and Ursula Barnacle, administrative manager with the
Conejo Youth Employment Service, a nonprofit agency that places about
half of its 1,500 applicants in jobs each year, said many teens now
are set on computer-related work. They've learned the skills at
school and want to put them to use.</TE>
<TE>   Juan Rios, who just graduated from Hueneme High School, got a job
putting together presentations using the Microsoft software
PowerPoint, and solving computer problems for Oxnard's City Corps
youth development program.</TE>
<TE>   But the 17-year-old wants to make more than minimum wage. He's
compiling a resume and searching want ads to find a computer
programming or repair job that pays at least $7.50 an hour. While
other teens are frustrated by the job market, Rios remains
optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel confident I can get something," he said.</TE>

<HD>Bid to Increase Mobile Homes' Rent Threatens Retiree Havens</HD>
<DH>Courts: Seniors say they can't afford 250% increases and
accuse firm of trying to void rent control. The firm says it is
protecting its investment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLY ANN CONNELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>LOS OSOS, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Bill Spurrier and Wilma Hembree have been neighbors for 25 years in a
San Luis Obispo County mobile home park with the requisite swimming
pool, the once-modern community center and rows of neat coaches.</LD>
<LD>   Cooler than San Luis Obispo and warmer than Morro Bay, the Sea
Oaks Mobile Home Community is between the two communities at the base
of the Irish Hills, where 70 degrees and sunny might be the standing
weather forecast.</LD>
<LD>   But Hembree, a legally blind 89-year-old widow, and Spurrier, a
77-year-old retired Long Beach firefighter, see storm clouds blowing
over their haven in the form of a fight about rent control that looms
over mobile home parks statewide.</LD>
<TE>   The two senior citizens and seven other tenants in the 125-space
park received notice this spring that the rent for their spaces would
increase about 250% to $1,100. The dispute began with technical
disagreements between the tenants and a Chicago-based corporation
over the terms of their leases. The company has used similar disputes
in other California communities as a starting point for challenging
the constitutionality of rent control.</TE>
<TE>   Many California communities maintain laws that limit rent
increases, even when mobile homes are sold. That has frustrated many
park owners, particularly because limits on apartment rents were
eliminated in 1999. Landlords of mobile home parks have responded by
increasing pressure to break through price restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   Senior citizens such as those at Sea Oaks say it is unfair to hit
them with large rent increases, which they say they can't afford on
fixed incomes. Many of the older tenants had planned to sell their
units one day at a profit, something they may find difficult if rents
go through the roof. That fear remains even though Hembree, at least,
received a reprieve when the landlord promised to keep her rent at
$295 a month.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't usually look this old," Spurrier said at a recent
gathering of senior citizens who are angry over the rent increases at
Sea Oaks. "I've aged 10 years in the last three months."</TE>
<TE>   But Manufactured Home Communities--a publicly held real estate
investment trust and the largest owner of mobile home parks in the
nation--said it is only trying to protect its investment at Sea Oaks
and other California parks.</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago-based company argues that rent control robs its
shareholders, many of whom are also of modest means, of the full
value of the properties. The company says that many individual mobile
home owners are wealthy speculators who sell relatively worthless
mobile homes for exorbitant prices, up to $500,000--playing on buyers
who will pay top dollar because they know their monthly payments will
be kept artificially low by rent control.</TE>
<TE>   The firm is in federal court in three separate cases challenging
the constitutionality of mobile home rent control in the cities of
San Luis Obispo, San Rafael and Santa Cruz. Both sides say it's
likely that the Sea Oaks park in Los Osos, an unincorporated area
under the San Luis Obispo County ordinance, will soon be added to the
list.</TE>
<TE>   The company "makes a federal case out of everything," said San
Luis Obispo attorney John Belsher, who represents area mobile home
owners.</TE>
<TE>   But David Bradford, the Chicago-based attorney handling the
company's federal cases, said there is good reason. "The reason they
are selling for that much is because they are selling rent control in
perpetuity," Bradford said. "The value of our land is being
transferred to the tenants."</TE>
<TE>   Fearing that landlords are increasingly finding ways around rent
control, scores of tenants have been lodging complaints with
California legislators and asking for a statewide law controlling the
rent on mobile homes. Experts say it's unlikely the Legislature will
intervene.</TE>
<TE>   The company's conflicts with its tenants often began with
technical issues involving the local rent control laws, but expanded
into tests of the underlying constitutionality of rent control
ordinances:</TE>
<TE>   * In Santa Cruz, residents of DeAnza Mobile Home Estates, an
exquisite park on a coastal bluff overlooking Natural Bridges State
Park, have been in litigation with the company for years over a
series of issues.</TE>
<TE>   The firm has increased rents to as high as $4,000 a month on a few
mobile homes after individual coach owners received sales prices of
up to $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Choi, a deputy city attorney for Santa Cruz, acknowledges
that some former owners violated a sales price cap in the city's rent
control law--complicating the defense of the ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   Although the company's attorneys reiterated that they are
protecting shareholder interests, Choi said the company is preying on
municipalities that find it difficult to afford to defend themselves.
Santa Cruz has spent $300,000 so far to defend its rent control
ordinance, she said. "They have unlimited financial resources," Choi
said. "The ultimate goal is to eliminate rent control."</TE>
<TE>   * In San Luis Obispo, the company has charged that the city's rent
control on mobile homes is unconstitutional. The dispute originated
when the company said one tenant had transferred tenancy to his
daughter, and it imposed a rent increase from $430 to $1,100 a month.
That case is pending in federal court in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   * In San Rafael, the company sued when the city moved to allow
decontrol of rents at vacated units and then backed off after a
public outcry from senior citizens. The company won a first round in
court in a dispute involving the Contempo Marin Mobile Home Park and
city officials are fighting to preserve their ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   Back at Sea Oaks, fear is spreading among residents.</TE>
<TE>   The tenants won a first round this month when the county rent
control board rejected the increases, which raised rents for some
tenants from about $300 a month to $1,100. The board hearing was
packed with 250 audience members, many of whom booed and hissed the
company's attorney.</TE>
<TE>   The company argued that rent increases were justified because the
county's rent control applies only to month-to-month tenancies and
the renters had signed yearly leases.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Rodriguez told the rent board that most of the value of
mobile home sales is due to the underlying land. He said that any
value between the low blue book value of a mobile home--sometimes
$20,000 for older double-wides--and the sale price rightly belongs to
the company.</TE>
<TE>   Spurrier lives with his wife in a double-wide. He had planned to
go on living in Sea Oaks indefinitely. But he said he cannot afford
to pay $1,100 a month.</TE>
<TE>   Hembree, who lives in a smaller single-wide, was hoping to sell
and move closer to the Braille Institute in Santa Barbara as she
tries to maintain her independence despite rapidly diminishing
eyesight.</TE>
<TE>   The company has recently reversed the rent increase it once
demanded from the woman, saying that she can keep her $295 monthly
rent for the next 30 years. Company attorney Bradford said the firm
tries to make such hardship exemptions.</TE>
<TE>   But she still protests that her plans to sell her mobile home will
be scotched because any buyer will offer less for the older home when
facing a large monthly rent increase to occupy a space in the park.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, it's worth almost nothing because nobody wants to pay that
kind of rent" said Hembree, who said she lives on $800 in Social
Security a month. "I really don't have any savings; it's all tied up
in my home."</TE>
<TE>   Company representatives said owners such as Hembree are the
exception and that many affluent residents are making large gains by
selling mobile homes.</TE>
<TE>   With cases pending all over the state, legal experts said it will
take a higher court decision, probably from the U.S. 9th Circuit
Court of Appeals, to settle the disputes.</TE>
<TE>   Cayetano Moreno, a soft-spoken owner of three small mobile home
parks in Los Osos and Morro Bay, favors capping the sale price that
individuals can receive for their mobile homes and keeping rent
control.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no problem with crucifying this large corporation," Moreno
said. "But we have to recognize they are not the only greedy ones. It
is greedy to sell these mobile homes for a huge sum. The result is
that there will be no affordable housing on the Central Coast."</TE>

<HD>Hospital Probed on Union</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The state attorney general's office is reviewing allegations that
Antelope Valley Hospital officials violated state law by dissuading
nurses from forming a union.</LD>
<LD>   At issue is whether the Antelope Valley Health Care District,
which operates the 350-bed hospital in Lancaster, violated a law that
forbids employers from using state tax dollars for antiunion
purposes. The California Nurses Assn. alleges that the district hired
consultants and lawyers to help fight unionization and purchased
antiunion fliers and other materials with state funds.</LD>
<LD>   The charges are being evaluated by the attorney general's civil
rights enforcement section, according to a letter that Chief
Assistant Atty. Gen. Richard Frank wrote to union representatives
last week.</LD>
<TE>   In May, a majority of the hospital's registered nurses voted in
favor of joining the union, CNA officials said.</TE>
<TE>   District officials have refused to recognize the union, arguing
that because the election did not use a secret ballot, the results
were invalid. The dispute is being reviewed by the state's Public
Employment Relations Board.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Hill, chairman of the health-care district, said the hospital
put state funds in an account that was not used for antiunion
activities, and added that he expects the attorney general will find
that the district did nothing wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "They will find these are frivolous claims," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The nurses said they have been pushing for a union amid concerns
that patient care is suffering because staffing has not kept pace
with the area's growing population.</TE>

<HD>Police Looking at an Oxnard Man in Killing</HD>
<DH>Crime: Investigators are focusing on an acquaintance of

industrial park.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five days after a Port Hueneme mother of two was shot to death in a
Ventura industrial park, homicide detectives have focused their
investigation on an Oxnard man who was an acquaintance of the woman,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Neither the name of the man nor the nature of his relationship
with the woman were disclosed Tuesday, but detectives have
interviewed his mother and others who may know him, Ventura Police
Lt. Doug Auldridge said.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators returned to the scene of the crime Tuesday to search
for additional clues.</LD>
<TE>   "This is someone we are looking at, but it doesn't mean it's him,"
Auldridge said. "We are going back to the area to canvass it and
check back with the local businesses and take statements."</TE>
<TE>   The body of Irene Imelda Mata, 22, was found just after 8:30 a.m.
Friday slumped in the front seat of a white 1991 Chevy Camaro in the
3000 block of Bunsen Avenue, near fields adjacent to the Ventura
Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   The car, which rear-ended an abandoned blue van after the
shooting, was registered to a Ventura woman, 41, who also was an
acquaintance of the man, Auldridge said. A firearm was found near the
scene.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses told officers that a man they saw fleeing the scene
appeared to be in his 20s, was about 6 feet tall and was wearing a
white shirt and brown pants.</TE>
<TE>   Several people told investigators that shortly after the shooting,
the man disappeared amid golfers teeing off at nearby Buenaventura
Golf Club.</TE>
<TE>   In an eight-hour search, police dogs and SWAT members scoured
neighborhoods and the Santa Clara riverbed, while a Ventura County
sheriff's helicopter buzzed overhead.</TE>
<TE>   For the last year, Mata had lived with her 3-year-old son and
2-year-old daughter in a small duplex in a working-class section of
Port Hueneme.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors said Mata sometimes left her two children unsupervised.</TE>
<TE>   "She left her kids alone a lot," said Lisa Marquardt, who lived
next door to Mata. "Her son would ask us where his mommy was. He
loved her so much."</TE>
<TE>   Mata was arrested June 1 and booked on suspicion of child abuse
after allegedly leaving her children unattended while she went to buy
them dinner, said Melanie Miles, the public defender who represented
her.</TE>
<TE>   The children have been in county-run foster homes since.</TE>
<TE>   Six days before her death, Mata appeared in court and was
scheduled to return for a status hearing in late August.</TE>
<TE>   Mata served time at the Branch Jail Honor Farm before posting
$55,000 bail earlier this month, court records show. In September,
she was arrested after getting into a fight with another woman.</TE>
<TE>   Miles said Mata was devastated when her two children were placed
in foster care, and vowed to get them back.</TE>
<TE>   "She seemed like a good mother who was trying to make ends meet
... She was no deadbeat mom," Miles said. "She had already signed up
for parenting classes when she was at the honor farm and she did it
on her own, which is unusual."</TE>
<TE>   Alejandro Arroyo, the father of Mata's daughter, said he was
shocked to learn about the shooting. The two had broken off their
four-year relationship a year ago, he said, but he had talked to her
as recently as Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't even know what to think about right now because I won't
believe it's real until I see her," said Arroyo, 24, of Oxnard. "I
just talked with her on the phone about what we needed to do to get
the kids back."</TE>

a mole on his left cheek. He also may have scratches on his face from
the July 23 incident.</LD>
<LD>   A 24-year-old woman told police she was walking in the 700 block

four-door Toyota Camry with tinted windows stepped out and began
following her.</LD>
<TE>   She said that the man grabbed her, forcing her into a parking lot,
and that she scratched him during the struggle.</TE>
<TE>   The man ran away when passersby entered the area. The driver sped
away.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who sees a man matching the description is asked to call
911. Anyone with other information about the case is asked to call
Det. Ken Klopman at 385-7759 or Det. Dave Klug at 385-7662.</TE>

will hold block parties. Officers from several units--including K-9
patrols, detectives and SWAT teams--will travel the party circuit to
meet with residents.</LD>

including Port Hueneme, where activities will be held from 5:30 to 8
p.m. in front of City Hall, 250 N. Ventura Road.</TE>
