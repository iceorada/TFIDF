<LD>At Dennis Hopper's birthday party Friday night, a woman approached
the evening's star, Esa-Pekka Salonen, who was smoking an
after-dinner cigar near the pool. "You're so young to be in charge of
an orchestra," she told 43-year-old Salonen, music director of the
Los Angeles Philharmonic. "Where are you from?" she continued, while
her tiny heels sank deeper into the wet grass.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the 150 or so guests at Hopper's Venice house, however,
gave Finnish-born Salonen (who has spent the last decade in L.A.)
plenty of reason to feel at home.</LD>
<LD>   Outside the bathroom, two women gave Salonen the right of way.
"You're the guest of honor," one of them exclaimed. "You should go
first."</LD>
<TE>   Afterward, Salonen grinned as he went off to fetch his wife a
glass of water at the bar. "That's it," he said of the courtesy.
"I've arrived."</TE>
<TE>   The day before at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Salonen had
conducted the American premiere of his new orchestral piece, "Foreign
Bodies," to critical acclaim. Hopper's party was thrown to celebrate
the musician's new work and the actor's 66th birthday.</TE>
<TE>   Guests came from all parts of the city.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the evening, during cocktails, Mike Medavoy, chairman
of Phoenix Pictures, talked about the political geography of his
turf: Hollywood. He seemed a little glum, saying he wanted to
organize a "content versus profit" panel discussion with members of
the media and entertainment industry. Arianna Huffington, standing
nearby, perked up. She leaned over. "What are you doing?" she
inquired, seemingly sensing an opportunity. "A panel discussion?"</TE>
<TE>   At the center of an upstairs room, the host held court, flanked by
artists Ed Moses and Robert Graham. Hopper, an avid collector of
modern art and an artist in his own right, was getting his share of
adulation. He will be honored Wednesday night at the MOCA gala
celebrating the opening of the Andy Warhol retrospective.</TE>
<TE>   Finishing their mojitos, guests sauntered downstairs to dine at
polka-dotted tables and gaze at Hopper's collection of contemporary
American art: paintings by David Salle, Warhol, Keith Haring.</TE>
<TE>   As he took his seat at one table, Frank Gehry tried to recall what
year he built the original half of Hopper's modern home. (Another
building was added later, linked by steel walkways and stairs.)</TE>
<TE>   "I can't remember, maybe 20 years ago," he said. "It's so long
ago." Gehry was abstaining from the Cuban-themed spread, served by
waiters in beige cooking jackets. "I can't eat tonight," he said,
clutching an energy bar and looking a little regretful. At another
table, Steve Martin got up for a second helping.</TE>
<TE>   After dinner, guests milled around outside or went exploring the
house. Daryl Hannah leaned against a doorjamb, smoking a cigarette.
In a corner of the rectangular garden, near the pool, Sean Penn stood
under a heat lamp, surrounded by women.</TE>
<TE>   Close to midnight, Caroline Graham who had helped organize the
party, sidled up to Hopper's wife Victoria Hopper (nee Duffy), asking
if the Cuban band could pep it up a little. "No," said the hostess,
an apparition in Galliano. "This is not a dance party."</TE>
<TE>   An Artful Pitch</TE>
<TE>   for a New Theater</TE>
<TE>   On a recent evening in Pacific Palisades, Dustin Hoffman stood in
one end of the garden of a private home, looking a little nervous. In
a few minutes, he and Amanda Peet were going to perform a one-act
play by David Ives for about three dozen people. First, though,
Hoffman had to give his pitch. He turned to the assembled guests and
cleared his throat.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just good for the Westside," he said of a planned new
theater at Santa Monica College, for which he was helping raise
funds. "It's good for the city."</TE>
<TE>   Then he and Peet gave an even better reason for building theaters:
resident actors, eager to take the stage.</TE>
<TE>   After the 15-minute show, opera buff and former Dist. Atty. Gil
Garcetti, who had been sitting in front of Tom Hayden, turned and saw
the former state senator. "You look great," Garcetti exclaimed,
across the row of chairs. (Both sported out-of-office tans.)</TE>
<TE>   After the short play, guests gathered in small groups on the lawn,
launching into their favorite subjects. Hayden talked politics,
architect Renzo Zecchetto talked design, and Peet and Hoffman were
joined by Ray Liotta for a discussion of theater versus movies. A new
theater will have to be accessible and affordable to compete, Hoffman
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to give the theater a youthful vitality," he said,
recalling a conversation with Arthur Miller when the actor did "Death
of a Salesman" in London some years ago. "Miller took me aside and
said, 'When I wrote this play, I didn't write it for these people. I
wrote it for people who couldn't afford [the theater.]' I always
remembered that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He then turned to dedicate his play notes to Peet. "How do you
spell colleague," he asked, joking. Peet blushed and responded, "I'm
going to have this framed straightaway."</TE>

<LD>LETTERS TO J.D. SALINGER</LD>
<LD>   Edited by Chris Kubica and Will Hochman</LD>
<LD>   University of Wisconsin Press</LD>
<TE>   250 Pages, $24.95</TE>
<TE>   "J.D. Salinger is about as likely to discuss his writing craft on
national television as he is to respond to any of the letters in this
book," admits Will Hochman in "Letters to J.D. Salinger," a book he
co-edited with Chris Kubica collecting epistolary thoughts composed
to Salinger by readers, fellow writers and scholars. The fact that no
response can be expected from the recluse author is a primary reason
for the book. Salinger's work has always stirred fiery emotion in his
readers and there's dammed-up frustration among his fans due to his
immutable silence of nearly four decades.</TE>
<TE>   In the half-century following publication of "The Catcher in the
Rye," a novel that celebrated antihero traits such as alienation and
disaffection, Holden Caulfield's creator remains an enigma.
Certainly, Salinger's work has stood the test of time. He's received
more critical attention than almost any other post-World War II
American writer, and his short stories featuring the Glass family as
well as "Catcher" continue to capture readers as each new generation
encounters them. My 13-year-old son is one of his most recent fans.
Yet Salinger refuses communication with those wishing to lionize him.
In choosing aloofness, Salinger has cemented the intrigue with which
we view him and heightened our desire to know him.</TE>
<TE>   The question of whether an author owes his audience anything after
the fact of publication is at the core of this book. Many letter
writers feel cheated by Salinger's silence, personally affronted by
his refusal to engage in public discourse. Others believe they've
received from Salinger all they could hope for and write simply to
express gratitude. Some ask craft questions; still others lay the
blame of their own writing at his feet. "Composing the pieces that
make up 'Nine Stories,' you probably had no inkling of the damage for
which you would be responsible, and my own stories are some of it,"
writes poet and fiction writer David Huddle, adding: "[S]hould you
run across a story of mine in some journal that makes its way to your
house, don't read it. It'll just irk you." "I imagine this book as a
sort of shadow (or readers') biography of Salinger," explains
co-editor Kubica. The letters are for us, Salinger's readers. In
fact, some of the letters only touch on Salinger, yet show how deeply
his words affect us. The novelist Melanie Rae Thon writes as much to
her deceased father as to Salinger: "My dear father. I am supposed to
write a letter to J.D. Salinger, and I am writing to you instead, but
I am thinking of a girl in one of his stories...." The poet and
fiction writer Adrian C. Louis tells Salinger flat out that "this
letter is not to you. And, it's not really to me either. It's to
Maurice Moyle, my high school English teacher in Yerington, Nevada
... the guy that made me love literature." In the entries we get a
sense of the impact the author's words have had on everyone from
prep-school kids to inner-city adults, those raised to love
literature and those who stumbled upon it via Salinger's words. This
is the reader-response school of literary theory in action, giving us
not an ivory-tower look at Salinger's place in the canon of American
literature, but a personalized exploration of what his works mean. As
a project, it's a fascinating demonstration of how powerful
literature can be. It also prompted me to dust off my old Salinger
volumes to relive the moment when I first discovered him.</TE>
<TE>   The final section of the book features a sampling of posts from
Kubica's Web site jdsalinger.com and is by far the least interesting.
Rife with bad writing, these postings are more reflective of how
poorly we communicate electronically and how free we feel to spew
venom when we're not writing hard-copy letters. The rest, though, is
worth a read.</TE>
<TE>   Katharine Weber, a novelist and Yale writing teacher, describes
receiving six advance copies of her first novel in 1995 and sending
one, with a touching inscription, to Salinger in thanks for his
inspiration. The package was returned, a month later, marked
"refused." "Ever since then, it has sat on a high shelf in my study,
a constant rebuke to me from you. How dare I send you my first novel
with its presumptuous inscription! Who did I think I was? Who did I
think you were?"</TE>
<TE>   Fiction writer Andy Selsberg counsels Salinger that he doesn't
have to read the letters. "You don't have to explain. We've got what
we need." Novelist Tom Robbins tells Salinger that by disappearing,
he made the right decision. "I've sometimes wished that I'd followed
your example, although I'd have missed meeting hundreds of wonderful
people," and novelist Jim Harrison offers this uplifting thought: "Tu
Fu, perhaps the greatest Chinese poet, published no books in his
lifetime but did quite well afterwards."</TE>

<HD>Attack on the Clunes</HD>
<DH>PBS' 'Frontier House' focused on the bad and ugly and left
out the good, the family insists</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>Poor, poor little rich boy Gordon Clune.</LD>
<LD>   Poor little starving Gordon Clune.</LD>
<LD>   --excerpt from a PBS Net forum about "Frontier House"</LD>
<TE>   The widely seen PBS reality series "Frontier House" captured the
many sides of Gordon Clune and his Malibu family. It caught their
whining side, complaining side, feuding side and cheating side.</TE>
<TE>   But there's one side the six-part series, which chronicled the
lives of three modern families as they struggled to live as 1883
Montana homesteaders, didn't catch: their good side. That part, or at
least most of it, said Clune, is somewhere on an editing-room floor.</TE>
<TE>   "If we were actors, we wouldn't have minded being edited so much,"
said Clune, who has shaved the beard he sported on TV but has
maintained the lean frontier physique that initially caused him so
much worry. "But we're just real people with real feelings and real
lives, and if it really didn't happen the way they portrayed it,
well, we're sensitive about that."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, based on the six hours televised, PBS audiences in
general have taken a powerful dislike to the Clunes, casting the
wealthy clan as the overprivileged Black Hats in an unfolding western
drama. Since the show aired earlier this month, viewers have blasted
the family on Web sites and in chat rooms and have delivered a
bountiful harvest of mean-spirited mail.</TE>
<TE>   "What the heck were the Clunes thinking when they decided to be on
the show?" wrote a viewer on the PBS Net forum about the series.
"Crying over makeup? Hopefully the sher'f will come and arrest them
in a later episode for general stupidity and whining."</TE>
<TE>   Still smarting from such reactions, Gordon and Adrienne Clune have
been reluctant to expose themselves to media scrutiny again,
particularly shielding their children, whom they want to return to
normal life as much as possible in the wake of national publicity.
Nevertheless, the couple recently agreed to talk about the pioneer
experiment and their homecoming to modern life over a late breakfast
at a coffee shop in their old La Canada neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Though they object to what they saw as their cartoonish portrayal,
the couple applaud the show overall, primarily for its ambitious
educational goal of depicting homesteading life. The Clunes were
among the three families who beat out some 5,000 applicants last year
to forgo the 21st century and all its comforts for five months of
19th century hardships. No electricity. No Domino's deliveries. No
toilet paper.</TE>
<TE>   The show's producers were looking for families that displayed a
certain hardiness of character, a passion for history and, perhaps
most important, a nonchalance about being videotaped day or night.
During a two-hour discussion, it became clear the Clunes didn't leave
any of those traits behind in their Montana cabin.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole time I was there, I was pure to being the 1883 guy,"
said Gordon, 41, president of a Los Angeles aerospace and defense
manufacturing firm. "But to me, there were 1883 laws that were
debatable; there were 2001 laws we had to live with, and then there
were production rules--and, as far as I was concerned, that was a
whole lotta laws and rules.</TE>
<TE>   "We all got major backbone out there," added Gordon. "I took the
[production] rules and crumpled them up, threw them on the floor and
said, 'That's what I think of your rules.' Then, our puppy dog
started chewing up the rules. Our whole family got defiant, and it
was fantastic."</TE>
<TE>   To some, such provocative statements might only confirm the series
accurately portrayed the Clunes. The same Clunes who secretly put box
springs in their bed. The same Clunes who once traded baked goods for
meat with the outside world. The same Clunes who "liberated" a couple
day's catch of fish--not caught on camera--from a lake outside the
homestead boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, the same Clunes who helped triple PBS' normal
ratings. Indeed, after the initial airing (PBS has since rerun the
program several times), it seemed that from the jogging paths to the
office water cooler, conversations frequently turned to the frontier
and the three families: the Boston newlyweds, the bickering
Tennesseans and the complaining Californians.</TE>
<TE>   One of the Clunes' main objections was the show's very un-1883
restrictions on gun use. "We were supposed to give a predator two
verbal warnings," said Gordon, who enrolled his family in gun-safety
classes before heading for the frontier. "'Excuse me, Mr. Coyote,
please don't eat my chicken. Excuse me, Mr. Coyote, please don't eat
my chicken.' Then, you were supposed to fire a warning shot.... If
that's what I had to do with the gun, then I told them I didn't want
it. I said I'd rather take my chances with an ax."</TE>
<TE>   Early on in the show when his children were hungry and he had lost
so much weight that he thought he was ill, Clune and some of the
other men took their videocams and used them to "hunt." They got
close enough to pose with a deer, Clune said, then took their video
quarry to the show's producers to prove they would have been able to
kill their own meat had the rules allowed it. They asked for a
comparable amount of meat, but their request was denied.</TE>
<TE>   Clune also proposed setting up targets with animal silhouettes.
Every two weeks, homesteaders would get one shot. If they hit it,
their diet would be augmented with meat. If not, tough luck. "Oh,
no," he recalled the show's producers saying. "It'd be too much like
a game show then."</TE>
<TE>   Causing almost as much stir as guns and trading for meat was
Adrienne's penchant for cosmetics. Few television reviews neglected
to ridicule the 40-year-old homemaker for a mini-crying jag over the
makeup ban for a group photo before the families set out.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course I knew I was going to have to live without makeup,"
recalled Adrienne, wearing a pink floral dress and a modest amount of
makeup for a presentation at a fund-raiser for Childrens Hospital of
Los Angeles later that morning. "But this was before we had left for
the frontier, and I thought I could wear it. I wouldn't have cared so
much if it was just us out there, but the fact you have a camera crew
and you know millions of people are going to be watching you
completely bare made a difference."</TE>
<TE>   But the frontier changed her. Her makeup habit has gone from heavy
everyday use to occasional, more subdued applications for public
outings. Most days, Adrienne now only puts on tinted sunscreen and
Chap Stick. "It was good for me to live without it," she said. "When
you get out there, it's such a low priority. You're thinking about
survival, and makeup just seems so ludicrous.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a distraction away from the real you," she said. "The inner
person. When you've stripped that away, it's the beauty within that's
important--the beauty of being content with yourself. I definitely
found that out there."</TE>
<TE>   "Contentment" is not a noun readily associated with the Clunes.
For many viewers, such words as "whiners" and "complainers" seem a
better fit. There was Gordon complaining about the more than 30
pounds he lost, leaving him looking like an Amish Bee Gee. There was
Adrienne complaining about missing her friends and romance. The
teenage girls--daughter Aine, 15, and niece Tracy, 15--complained
about milking cows, the cold and 1883 fashions. Son Justin, 11,
complained about the "endless" task of chopping wood. And even
9-year-old Conor complained that frontier life in general "sucks."</TE>
<TE>   But the show didn't make much of the few notable things the family
did not complain about: The horse accident in which Conor was thrown
from the wagon and Adrienne was nearly trampled. Though the horses
may have become unmanageable anyway, a lengthy photo session for the
producers featuring the wagon train certainly aggravated the animals,
according to the show's animal handlers.</TE>
<TE>   The whole family had diarrhea for several weeks. They slept on a
hardwood floor for three months--with mice. "No matter how many mice
the boys caught each night, there would always be three or four new
ones by nightfall. They'd run over your hair, your hands and your
feet," said Adrienne. (Gordon made rope beds that got them 14 inches
off the floor and solved the problem.)</TE>
<TE>   "[The producers] never wanted to show us as we were," said
Adrienne. "They were after television ratings."</TE>
<TE>   The show's executive producer, Beth Hoppe, said the series strove
to be both entertaining and educational, but every attempt was made
to show the families in a balanced light. For instance, when the
Clunes were caught cheating by trading for meat, the show gave
Gordon's side of the story, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Gordon was a strong character, and he had lots to say," said
Hoppe, who works at Thirteen/WNET in New York and also was the force
behind PBS' "1900 House," a similar experiment set in Victorian
England. "He had his argument for why he did what he did, and we
tried to portray that fairly. I think some people agreed with him."</TE>
<TE>   The Clunes believe an essential part of who they are is their
homesteading roots. Gordon lived on his grandparent's homestead (with
no running water) in Manitoba, Canada, until he was 5. Adrienne grew
up on a farm in Ireland where her family struggled to make ends meet.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought the series was going to be more of a historical
documentary," said Adrienne, a former history teacher. "I thought it
would be something history teachers could take to the classroom, but
I don't see how they could do that unless it was a psychology class."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, at times, the series had the backbiting, gossipy air of
"Survivor." The Clunes and the neighboring Glenn family of Tennessee
quickly took on a Hatfields-and-McCoys relationship--a dynamic the
show's narration underscored. The Clunes blame the show's producers
for inflaming the situation.</TE>
<TE>   "They would encourage certain things and run over to [Karen Glenn]
and say, 'Guess what they just said!' and tape her reaction," said
Adrienne. "In fairness to Karen, I don't think she would have been
half as bad if they weren't trying to stir up trouble between the two
families."</TE>
<TE>   Hoppe denies any such off-camera manipulations occurred. It's true
the production crew became friendly with all the families, but there
was no goading them, she said. "They all became a community out
there; there was talk among everyone at times," Hoppe said. "But the
production crew didn't fan the flames of conflict between Gordon and
Karen. You can see from Episode 1 there was instantly a lot of
tension there.</TE>
<TE>   "If one of them made an allegation on camera, then certainly our
director would give the other party an opportunity to respond, but
what we did not do as a production team was try to enhance this
conflict in any way. I'm very confident about that."</TE>
<TE>   Readjusting to the 21st century had its own challenges. The family
was not only returning to a new century, but also to a newly
constructed mansion in Malibu. The Clunes, who slept just feet away
from their children on the frontier, came back to a 7,000-square-foot
home filled with all the technological conveniences of modern life.</TE>
<TE>   "On the frontier, it was like a big slumber party," said Adrienne.
"It was very intimate sleeping in one big room. We talked and giggled
going to sleep every night. Of course, it's not very private. But
when we got back, we all had our separate bedrooms, and we missed the
closeness we had."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the shock of national media exposure, the Clunes said they
would do it all again. The family unity, work ethic and living life
as their forebears did was a wonderfully enriching experience, they
said. As a result, their children and their niece are all more
self-confident, self-reliant people.</TE>
<TE>   "Out there we had everything and we had nothing," said Gordon. "We
were at our poorest that anyone can imagine, and we were at our
richest.... It's easy to forget what's important, but out there it
was easy to see. If you've got your family, you've got everything."</TE>

<LD>* The families agreed to live as closely to the pioneer lifestyle of
the 1880s as possible. This included wearing period clothing and
preparing foods typical of the era and region using period equipment.</LD>
<LD>   * To maintain authenticity, outside communications were limited to
those consistent with the 1880s, meaning the postal service and
telegrams, and the occasional visit to the general store set up as
part of the experiment. Pleasure travel at the time was rare, as
transport was a complex and timely affair, but the families did have
some visitors. No extra supplies or accommodations were provided for
visitors. The families themselves were not supposed to travel beyond
their collective homesteads.</LD>
<LD>   * Each family was given a budget at the start of the project. Each
was also supplied provisions of wheat flour, coarsely cut oats,
cornmeal, dried beans, hard cheese, smoked bacon, lard, sugar,
molasses and honey.</LD>
<TE>   * Camera crews visited the homesteads, on average, three days a
week for four or five hours at a time. Also, each family was given a
video diary camera, which they used to record their feelings about
frontier life when production crews weren't present.</TE>
<TE>   * The families had the option to quit the project at any time.</TE>
<TE>   * Each household was supplied with a sealed emergency box. The
contents were emergency medical supplies, emergency communication
radio, fire extinguisher, bear repellent and emergency lighting.</TE>
<TE>   * The families were not paid to participate, though each received
a monthly stipend toward the mortgages back home. Producers would say
only that the amount was based on the national mortgage average.</TE>

<LD>"You never do anything around the house." If ever there was a
declaration designed to ruin a perfectly good Saturday afternoon nap,
that has to be it.</LD>
<LD>   And you know what? It's dead wrong--for the obvious reason.</LD>
<LD>   By taking a nap, I am doggedly confining myself to a small area,
thereby not messing up larger areas that would then require more
extensive cleaning.</LD>
<TE>   So when you are totaling up who does how much, in fairness, should
I not get credit for inactivity, it being, in essence, a form of
preventive housework?</TE>
<TE>   (I went to law school for nine straight days right after college.
I'm still recovering.)</TE>
<TE>   I've been reading this study done by the University of Michigan
about how much housework women do as opposed to men. The report
contains both good news and bad.</TE>
<TE>   On the one hand, it concludes, and I quote: "U.S. husbands are
doing more housework while wives are doing less."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, the study also points out that women still do
more housework than men--27 hours a week--while men are only getting
credit for 16 hours.</TE>
<TE>   The problem with these kinds of studies, of course, is that they
only deal in quantity, not quality.</TE>
<TE>   For example, it is estimated that 80% of the dirt that comes into
the home can be captured on mats or rugs situated at points of entry.</TE>
<TE>   So, if a man were to take charge of vacuuming these mats and rugs,
he would, in effect, be responsible for collecting 80% of the dirt
that enters the home.</TE>
<TE>   But how long would this take, a few minutes at most? Which is all
the housework time he would be credited with.</TE>
<TE>   Conversely, a woman who vacuumed the entire home would be credited
with hours of housework, even though she was only accounting for 20%
of the dirt.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, the male is being penalized for being efficient, while the
female is being rewarded for inefficiency.</TE>
<TE>   Another thing that is unfair when computing the division of
household labor is the question of just what constitutes housework.</TE>
<TE>   Isn't mowing the lawn the same as vacuuming the carpet?</TE>
<TE>   Isn't changing the oil the same as changing the child?</TE>
<TE>   Is wearing the same underwear for two or three days not the same
as doing laundry?</TE>
<TE>   What about those times during the middle of the night when a
suspicious noise downstairs must be checked? Should a man not be
fairly compensated for the time he spends worrying until his wife
returns?</TE>
<TE>   In summation, I say the only logical conclusion to be drawn here
is that the American male is not being afforded his due. But then,
what else is new?</TE>
<TE>   The defense rests.</TE>

<LD>Recycled Paper Craft</LD>
<LD>   The Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach recycles more than 40
tons of trash per year, including paper, glass, aluminum, plastic and
cardboard. Does your family recycle its trash? Here's a fun activity
that makes use of old newspapers and construction paper.</LD>
<LD>   Materials: Old newspaper; cup of water; blender; used construction
paper (brightly colored paper works best); large strainer; trash can;
cookie cutter with one closed side; cookie tin; some help from an
adult.</LD>
<TE>   Step 1: Tear a half a page of the newspaper into strips and place
the strips in the blender.</TE>
<TE>   Step 2: Add one cup of water.</TE>
<TE>   Step 3: Ask an adult to run the blender until all of the strips of
newspaper have a thick liquid-pulp consistency, then turn it off.</TE>
<TE>   Step 4: Tear the construction paper into strips.</TE>
<TE>   Step 5: Repeat Step 3 with the construction paper. The mixture
will take on the color of the paper. The more construction paper you
add, the brighter the color will be.</TE>
<TE>   Step 6: Hold the strainer over a trash can and ask an adult to
pour the paper mixture into it, letting the excess water drain out.</TE>
<TE>   Step 7: Pour the paper mixture from the strainer into the cookie
cutter, filling it to the rim.</TE>
<TE>   Step 8: With your fingers, press as much of the remaining water as
you can from the paper.</TE>
<TE>   Step 9: Carefully remove the mixture from the cookie cutter and
put the molded form on the cookie sheet to dry.</TE>
<TE>   Step 10: Give your craft as a gift, take it to school for
show-and-tell or decorate your room with it.</TE>
<TE>   Congratulations! You have made a 100% recycled craft. Remember,
any little bit helps in making a big difference for our environment.</TE>

dads.</LD>
<LD>   * I will give my dad a big kiss in the morning and be a good girl.
(Linsey)</LD>
<LD>   * My dad really likes plants. I will buy a plant for him and ask
him to pay me back. (Antonette)</LD>
<TE>   * I will make him an orange banana smoothie and peach teriyaki BBQ
chicken and take him to the movies. (Mark, 10)</TE>
<TE>   These ideas are from students at Westchester Lutheran School in
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   * If your father works in an office all day, give him something so
he can see you when you are not there. Make a collage of pictures of
you throughout the years. (Kirsten, 11)</TE>
<TE>   * I would like to get up early and make coffee and breakfast. Then
I would spend a whole bunch of time with him. I would play baseball,
video games. I would make him chocolate chip pancakes. (Brandon)</TE>
<TE>   * I will make breakfast for my dad. If I have any free time before
he wakes up, I will do some homework. (My dad likes it when I do my
homework.) My dad is a Lakers fan, and I will give him some Lakers'
items. After that, my dad and I will play a game of basketball.
During and after dinner there will probably be a basketball game on,
so I will not bother him. (Jessica, 11)</TE>

<HD>Their Words Are Their Bond</HD>
<DH>Arts* Fifth-graders and professional writers unite to
celebrate poetry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sam Stapleton may never see a poem as lovely as a Krispy Kreme
doughnut. But you can tell that he knows his quatrains. The proof was
there Sunday afternoon, when Sam's untitled poem about baseball was
read aloud at Westwood Charter School's 5th Grade Poetry Exchange
Festival, a cross-generational celebration of all things lyrical,
metrical and blank verse.</LD>
<LD>   A slightly built, dark-haired boy with a shy demeanor, Sam took a
pass on publicly reciting his poem, a kind of pre-pubescent "Casey at
the Bat" concerning a hapless outfielder's pursuit of a fly ball.
Instead, his words were given flight by poet Brendon Constantine, who
was sporting black jeans, green socks and several small loopy
earrings.</LD>
<LD>   "I asked him to read, but unfortunately there's a copyright
issue," Constantine joked before launching into these reverberant
lines: "But the ball is coming down, KABOOM!/The ball is now bouncing
on the ground/Now the pitcher runs off the pitcher's mound." When
Constantine finished, the children, teachers and parents scattered
around Room 8 broke into barrages of applause that went floating down
the second-floor corridor.</LD>
<TE>   Poetry readings and festivals can sometimes be deadly
affairs--hermetically sealed, insider gatherings where the
participants vastly outnumber the audience members and the language
feels as distant from everyday reality as Sanskrit. This one was
different. Inspired by the idea that art-making can be a vital
community endeavor spanning geographic, age and experiential
boundaries, the festival was designed to match each of the school's
125 fifth graders with an accomplished adult poet living and working
in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this spring, the students wrote letters and sent poems to
their assigned poets and asked the poets to reciprocate in kind. Word
of the event spread when poet Richard Beban posted an e-mail to some
of his friends and colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   Most poets wrote back promptly and sent poems of their own. About
75 of them showed up Sunday to take part in an afternoon of readings,
informal chatter and group verse-writing activities. A bake sale,
whose offerings included chocolate chip cookies and the inevitable
Krispy Kremes, helped fortify participants for the three-hour event.</TE>
<TE>   Artist Lorraine Bubar, the festival's prime mover, said that by
taking part in the afternoon, the adult poets were validating the
students as "fellow writers." "It's made [the students] realize that
there's these active poetry communities, these artist communities,
that want to reach out to them," said Bubar, one of whose daughters
is a Westwood fifth-grader.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Bubar helped organize a similar exchange between
students and visual artists, sponsored by the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art's education department. That event, involving several
hundred children, drew responses from such internationally renowned
artists as John Baldessari, Robert Irwin, Charles Ray and Alison
Saar. Their artworks, along with the students', were exhibited at
LACMA, where a reception was held allowing students and artists to
meet each other. The professionals' artwork was then sent to the
children to keep.</TE>
<TE>   Bubar said that the poetry exchange furthers the 10-year-old
charter school's emphasis on literature and the fine arts--programs
that often get short shrift in the cash-strapped Los Angeles Unified
School District. "LAUSD is just pushing literacy, basic skills. That
can be boring. This makes it alive," Bubar said. Diana Berz, the
school's curriculum coordinator, credits Bubar with tapping the
creative energies of the neighborhood school, where many parents take
a hands-on role in expanding their children's cultural horizons. "She
rallies us," Berz said.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, poetry was everywhere you looked along the school's
second floor: Pasted on cabinets and walls, jotted down in folders on
students' desks, scribbled on little slips of paper that got passed
from hand to hand. One sign on a playground wall invited passersby to
"Write a poem using as many of these words as you can"--"Banana,"
"Awesome," "Fear," "Dream," "Like." Even Keats might've blanched at
that assignment. There were few other rules about what could be in
the poems, other than an informal ban on such words as "orb."</TE>
<TE>   As students, parents and poets were trickling in, classroom
"hosts" asked everyone to contribute a line to a "group poem"
triggered by passing around a sprig of fresh rosemary (Grecian urns
being in short supply these days). In Room 8, poet Stephanie Hemphill
and student Brett Whalen began jotting down words, trying to hit on
the perfect alchemical combination. At the back of the room,
camcorders were silently turned on, the adults did their best to fit
themselves into chairs and desks designed for 10-year-olds, and for
several minutes the only break in the stillness was when a cell phone
went off, playing the opening bars of "Greensleeves."</TE>
<TE>   Poet Stuart Denenberg, an art dealer in his other life, took in
the busy scene. "In our culture, arts are kind of the neglected
stepchild. What's serious is what's making a buck, and the rest is
not serious," he said. "Art should be a wonderful incursion to the
ordinary, elevating the ordinary by virtue of its unordinariness."</TE>
<TE>   A few doors down the hall it was standing room only as poet Jack
Grapes, a stocky man in gray sweatpants and a blue polo shirt, acted
out his prose poem "The Tree With Three Hearts." The mixed-age crowd
giggled at Grapes' impersonation of two French Canadian lumberjacks,
got big-eyed as the words gained momentum, and gasped when Grapes
fell to the ground, face-first, imitating a fallen tree.</TE>
<TE>   Student Nahal Zarnighian later said she liked Grapes' performance
because "he expressed his feelings," as she herself did in her poem,
"A Door": "A door can open to a very magical place/ ...Joyful things
might be sent to the front of your door."</TE>
<TE>   Several adult poets said the door to becoming writers had opened
back when they were students. Jason A. White said he'd never thought
about becoming a poet until a teacher at San Pedro High School told
him he had a gift that mustn't be wasted. Today, he said, he writes
poetry "to better understand who I am."</TE>
<TE>   "You start writing about real adult things; it's not so much in
imagination and fantasy as when you're young," he added. "Sometimes
it's a lot of pain, and you have to deal with that."</TE>
<TE>   Pain was deeply woven into some students' poems. In "Beach," Adam
Estrin conjured up the image of "Waves crashing in the cold blue
waters/Like 100 meteors hitting the flat stone surface...Washing away
all my sad feelings." He'd been matched up with poet Carine Topal,
who was moved to respond with a poem, "After Receiving Adam's Poem,"
that incorporated pieces of the boy's verse: "Washing away/all my sad
feelings,/a white envelope/with a letter inside/Adam sends me
meteors/a beach, waves, flat stones." A number of other poets favored
this reciprocal approach. "Those are really the most charming," Bubar
said. "They really capture the spirit of the whole event."</TE>
<TE>   Feelings of gratitude flowed from all sides. Constantine, who
programs film screenings for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp;
Sciences, said that Sam's baseball poem had helped him get past a
creative dry spell. For his part, Sam allowed that it was "kind of
easier" to have Constantine read his poem than to read it himself,
"because he kind of acted it out too."</TE>
<TE>   Really, the afternoon went by too fast. By 3:45 the school was
emptying out, apart from some die-hards in Room 18. Could any of the
students imagine becoming poets for--don't laugh, now, all you
adults--a living? Ellen Moreh wasn't sure. Writing short stories was
fun, she said, but poetry was tougher. "I don't like any of my work,"
she said wincing. "My work's really weird."</TE>
<TE>   But in poetry, weird can be good. Horace Coleman remembered the
all-too-conventional poems he was forced to imbibe as a youngster,
from a schoolbook titled "Memory Gems." "It's a wonder I became a
poet after that," he said. Four o'clock had arrived, and the last
stragglers gathered up jackets, leftover Krispy Kremes and their
copies of specially printed spiral notebooks containing copies of all
poems submitted for the event. Look on their works, ye mighty, and
despair!</TE>
<TE>   "It's the antidote to television," said poet Tom M. Hall as he
gathered himself for the walk out to the parking lot. "Live
communication."</TE>

<HD>Rabbi Not the Retiring Type</HD>
<DH>Freehling's new calling: to lead human relations panel</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY ROURKE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At his retirement dinner in April, Rabbi Allen Freehling said he
would use his newfound free time to write four books based on his 30
years as leader of University Synagogue on the city's Westside. Now,
it looks as if those plans will have to wait. On Monday, Freehling,
70, was named executive director of the Human Relations Commission
for the city of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Formed in 1958 to help build positive race and human relations
among the city's increasingly diverse communities, the commission has
a legacy that dates back to 1943 when the "zoot suit" riots tore
through Los Angeles after white sailors attacked a group of Latinos.</LD>
<LD>   Freehling, who throughout his career has emphasized the
social-action side of his ministry, described his new job as one of
"community building," with youth programs at its heart. Los Angeles
Mayor James Hahn said Monday he chose Freehling in part because the
two have worked together on community projects for many years. "When
you are looking for someone to oversee human relations, you want
someone who really cares about people," Hahn said. "Allen Freehling
is very compassionate. Empathy is his middle name."</LD>
<TE>   Hahn said he wants the commission to represent all the city's
ethnic and economic groups and to become more high profile. "We need
to be sure we are including everyone. It will help the city work
better."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor pointed to Freehling's role as the founding chair, in
the 1980s, of the Los Angeles Commission on AIDS, but the rabbi's
more recent experiences helping mend fences between the city's Muslim
and Jewish communities will also serve him in his new job. He has led
an often tempestuous, L.A.-based Jewish-Muslim dialogue group since
it was formed in 1998, a time of increasing conflict in the Middle
East. Now, Freehling said, "I want every racial, ethnic and faith
group in the city to get involved in the work of human relations. I'd
like to help create an environment that fosters a greater sense of
the whole community. I'll start by determining which groups in the
city aren't communicating now, but should be."</TE>
<TE>   Freehling served as senior rabbi at University Synagogue since
1972. When he arrived there, membership was down to fewer than 250
and the temple was nearly bankrupt. With 900 families today,
University Synagogue is going strong, and the rabbi said he felt he
needed to focus full time on social activism, which has always been
his other calling. His first job on the staff of a synagogue, in the
mid-1950s, was as executive director of Temple Israel in Miami, where
he also hosted a Jewish-Christian dialogue and did consulting work
for the Chamber of Commerce Committee on International Relations.</TE>
<TE>   During the late '60s, when he served as an associate rabbi in
Toledo, Ohio, he was active in the NAACP and with the Lucas County
Board of Mental Health. He has also focused on AIDS activism since
the early days of the epidemic, founding an AIDS Interfaith Council
for Southern California in the mid-'80s, serving as chairman for the
Los Angeles County AIDS Services Committee in 1989 and as founding
chairman of an International Assn. of Physicians in AIDS Care in the
early '90s.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in his office at the University Synagogue, a cozy room
crowded with books, plaques, awards and mementos, Freehling spoke
about his belief in the interconnected-ness of religion and social
activism.</TE>
<TE>   "Early in my career," he said, "we were in a prophetic phase in
Judaism, which gets to the plight of other people. We were involved
in social action, open to the biblical prophets as teachers and role
models." His years as senior rabbi helped prepare him for his new
job. "Now that I'm no longer responsible as the spiritual leader of a
congregation, I can step onto a larger stage."</TE>
<TE>   To be an activist is to be a good Jew, Freehling said. "Social
justice is the great tradition of Reform Judaism." But lately, he
sees many Jews being drawn more to the spiritual aspects of the
religion. "For many years, Jews felt discomfort with what I call 'God
talk,'" he said. "Long years of social action opened the way for Jews
to explore the Jewish philosophers." Martin Buber is his inspiration.
The Vienna-born writer and teacher considered personal encounters
between people of different backgrounds as a way to spiritual growth.
Until his death in 1965, Buber was active in a Jewish-Christian
dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   Sounding like a cautious parent, Freehling said he worries about
keeping a balance between spirituality and social action. "What I
don't see in the search for spiritual fulfillment is the next step,
leading people on to action," he said. "The reason for the one is to
lead on to the other. Hopefully the pendulum will swing back to a
better balance."</TE>
<TE>   Photos on the walls outside Freehling's office show him with
President Clinton, as well as several former L.A. mayors. Most often
he is shown posing at a rally, walkathon or other sort of
city-improvement project.</TE>
<TE>   As conflicts in the Middle East have become increasingly volatile
over the past two years, despite Freehling's steadfast efforts as
moderator of the local Jewish-Muslim dialogue group, he has seen at
least a half-dozen of the 20 or so members quit in frustration.</TE>
<TE>   Freehling said he will serve as moderator as long as the group
wants him to. "In a dialogue, you can't bring your agenda and
expectations to the table," he said. "You have to be open to what
comes." His solution to the contentious atmosphere is to add new
members as often as possible. "We need to bring in new people
constantly," he said. "As some leave, we need others to come in who
understand that dialogue is not the same as debate."</TE>
<TE>   With no illusions about what it takes to change the world,
Freehling said, "some battles are ongoing." Among them is the AIDS
epidemic--the International Assn. of Physicians in AIDS Care, a group
that now has more than 10,000 doctors and researchers as members, is
about to open an office in Paris, making it easier to coordinate
projects in Europe. There are already offices in South Africa and its
base, Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Freehling was the only clergy member in the group.
"Allen looks at AIDS from a human rights perspective," said Jose
Zuniga, current president of the association. "Human rights means
supplying medicine and monitoring progress, but also dealing with the
stigma that underlies the disease."</TE>
<TE>   Freehling has wanted to put his full attention on human relations
and social issues for a long time. To be a rabbi, his way, is to be a
man of the world. "I can help people build coalitions," he said. "We
can all live with a sense of security and well-being and still be
mindful of the needs of others."</TE>

<HD>His Exam RATs Out Lack of Practical Skill</HD>
<DH>Valedictorians, the Real-World Aptitude Test could test
your grasp of life lessons to the third degree</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN LEVINE</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You aced the SAT and just won a full scholarship to your dream
school. Or you just finished college summa cum laude and clinched a
prestigious job with salary to match.</LD>
<LD>   Done and diploma-ed, you are a graduate about to confidently make
your way into the world.</LD>
<LD>   You are so deluded.</LD>
<TE>   Homer E. Moyer Jr. knows what you don't: that you probably are far
less prepared than you think. He's an abundantly credentialed
Washington, D.C., lawyer, but his workday title is secondary here.
More significantly, he's the father of four grown or nearly grown
children and author of "The RAT."</TE>
<TE>   In this season of pomp and circumstance, the RAT--the Real-World
Aptitude Test--could make you wonder if you're truly ready to leave
home.</TE>
<TE>   Scored on the same 200 to 800 scale as the SAT, that often dreaded
counterpart, Moyer's exam focuses on information that helps a person
maneuver through life skills and smarts that he characterizes as
things worth knowing, things it would be risky not to know, things to
give you an edge, and so on:</TE>
<TE>   For example, what is the best way to dry a wool sweater?</TE>
<TE>   Or, what has the highest concentration of alcohol--beer, grain
alcohol, whiskey or wine?</TE>
<TE>   Or, define the term compound interest and demonstrate how $100,
earning 10% interest annually, would grow.</TE>
<TE>   Or, sing (or recite) the first verse of "The Star-Spangled
Banner."</TE>
<TE>   In all, the battery of questions covers 30 diverse and challenging
subjects from domestic skills and electricity to gambling and the
fine arts. But Moyer does more than give his test takers the Qs (in
the form of multiple choice, true or false, fill-in-the-blank and
even performance-related exercises requiring props like an iron or an
egg). His 353-page paperback primer also provides the A's, in great
detail, with secondary sources and multiple Web sites to pique the
curious. As a bonus, it's suffused with humor.</TE>
<TE>   "From the perspective of the test taker," he writes in his
introduction, "The RAT is vastly superior and far friendlier [than
the SAT]. The RAT may be taken in the comfort of your own home; you
make take as long as you like to finish; and, if you like, you can
take it a second or third time without the answers having changed.</TE>
<TE>   "Most important, the answers are in the back. And whatever your
score, it will not be mailed in an official-looking envelope to
employers or colleges with whom you may soon be interviewing--or
colleagues who may have laughed at you in the past because you didn't
know how to change a tire."</TE>
<TE>   "The RAT," which landed on store shelves in time for spring
commencements, is not Moyer's first book. His downtown Washington
office contains previous titles such as "Export Controls" and
"Justice &amp; the Military," weighty works reflecting his background as
an international corporate attorney who has served as general counsel
of the Commerce Department and founded an American Bar Assn. project
on legal reform in former Communist countries. He started "The RAT"
nearly eight years ago as a lighthearted gift for his daughter
Bronwen, then a senior at Sidwell Friends School in Washington. As
graduation approached, Moyer and his wife pondered how well their
firstborn was going to fare away from the nest. The gift became a
project that took on a life of its own as family and friends
suggested fareas of inquiry. Chapters were dropped, chapters were
added--by then, Bronwen was halfway through college and Max, child
No. 2, was graduating from high school--and Moyer began testing the
work in progress on various audiences.</TE>
<TE>   Several more years and a few rejection letters later--by now, son
Eli was in college and Kaia Joye, the youngest, in high
school--Capital Books in Dulles, Va., agreed to publish "The RAT"
and, potentially, a series of real-world aptitude tests.</TE>
<TE>   "You could have a kitchen RAT, a new parents RAT, the travel RAT,"
Moyer says.</TE>
<TE>   For the moment, though, there is only one, selling for $19.95. At
Moyer's alma mater, Emory University in Atlanta, the alumni
association is considering using "The RAT" in a non-credit class
called "Life 101," which is popular with seniors and recent
graduates.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll either use it as a supplement or a text for the course,"
says Bob Pennington, vice president for alumni affairs and
development. Pennington, who counts an MBA and JD among his four
degrees, has taken the RAT himself. "And I'm not about to tell you
how I scored," he says. However, he claims to have done better than
Emory's president, William M. Chase, who confessed to bombing the
test in a note to Moyer.</TE>
<TE>   "The premise obviously is Renaissance-like, in that it's very
eclectic and deliberately so," Moyer says. "This is just another way
to do what so many people do--to get prepared, to get ahead, to
prepare for the bumps in the road, which we all have, and to make it
fun."</TE>
<TE>   His personal favorites are the questions on automobiles, cooking
and etiquette. "They seem to me to be among the most important
practically. You step out the front door and you're going to find you
need to know something about all of them," he says.</TE>
<TE>   He's discovered that young people are quite weak in the arts,
strong on computers and abysmally ignorant of the Bible.</TE>
<TE>   Lest young people try to turn the tables, he writes: "It is
important to remember--and of special interest to parents--that one
need not be able to pass the RAT to administer it. Its purpose, after
all, is to edify the young, not mortify their elders."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Consider it my epiphany, the moment I began wondering if we've gone a
little overboard in our effort to avoid academic mediocrity.</LD>
<LD>   I was at a forum for parents of prospective students at one of the
city's elite high schools--one that has dozens of applicants for
every space in ninth grade. The counselor described its curriculum
(demanding), its sports program (winning), its students' community
service (required), its reputation (stellar).</LD>
<LD>   "Any questions?" he asked, surveying the rapt crowd. One hand went
up; one brave parent who dared to ask what many of us must have been
wondering: About how much homework would a student have each night,
to fit in between water polo practice, writing poetry and reading at
the old folks' home?</LD>
<TE>   "About four hours," the counselor said, straight-faced. "Certainly
some nights there is more or less, but our ninth-graders spend, on
average, four hours on homework every night."</TE>
<TE>   Around me, parents nodded and murmured approvingly. I shook my
head and rose to leave.</TE>
<TE>   Are these people crazy, or is it me?</TE>
<TE>   Even kindergartners have homework these days. It was a revelation
to me 12 years ago, when my oldest child started school, that Los
Angeles Unified, like most school districts, required homework for
every child, every day.</TE>
<TE>   I didn't balk. It made sense. Homework, I understood, was not just
about building skills, but developing a work ethic, a study routine.
Parents' role, the teachers told us, was simply to arrange a place,
provide supplies and make sure our children set aside the time. Most
nights back then, homework was easy, fun even ... cutting out
pictures from magazines, making the letter "A" out of pinto beans.</TE>
<TE>   But too much of a good thing is still too much. And today, the
whining about homework comes not just from kids, but from
stressed-out parents resentful that growing homework loads have
family lives in a stranglehold.</TE>
<TE>   Although research shows that homework adds little value to
children's education in the primary grades, it's not uncommon for
students in some elementary schools to have two hours of homework a
day. The average 10-year-old spends almost four hours on homework
each week, an hour more than a decade ago. Half of all parents say
their efforts to get their kids to finish homework sometimes leads to
tantrums--by the kids, not the parents--and almost one-quarter admit
they sometimes resort to doing their kids' work.</TE>
<TE>   Now parental grumbling is beginning to make inroads. The giant New
York City school district dropped its required homework minimums two
years ago. Then the nearby Piscataway Township district in New Jersey
went a step further and became one of the first to put limits on the
amount of homework teachers can assign.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the battlefield moved close to home, as the
high-achieving Conejo Valley Unified District in Ventura County
replaced its homework mandates with a policy that calls for no more
than 10 minutes per grade level of homework each night, discourages
weekend assignments and prohibits teachers from using homework--or
lack of homework--to bring down a student's grade.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to focus on the idea that homework needs to add
value to what the kids are learning ... and should not be dependent
on Mom or Dad to be completed," said Richard Simpson, assistant
superintendent for instruction.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, that's easier said than done. What one kid can breeze
through in 15 minutes may take another 45. And some dawdlers may need
the push of a parent to complete an assignment, while others work
without complaint on their own. And teachers and parents tend to have
divergent views of how much homework is too much.</TE>
<TE>   The dialogue was fascinating as the Conejo Valley policy was
hammered out, Simpson said. "You had parents and teachers sitting at
the same table with totally different perspectives of what life is
like with homework. The teacher's saying, 'I gave a half-hour.' And
the parent says, 'That assignment took three hours.'"</TE>
<TE>   Polls show many teachers think parents shirk their responsibility
when it comes to homework. And parents fault teachers for sending
home assignments that require too much parental help or have not been
explained in class.</TE>
<TE>   Simpson suspects the new policy will be a hard sell to some
faculty members, who consider homework the oil that makes the engine
run.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be an education process all the way around," he
said. "It seems how you feel about homework depends largely on what
decade you grew up in and what your experience with your own children
has been."</TE>
<TE>   I realize that homework teaches kids valuable lessons that don't
get graded--time management, the meaning of sacrifice, the wisdom of
preparation and the folly of procrastination.</TE>
<TE>   And we shouldn't delude ourselves into thinking that less homework
will translate to more friendly, family games of Scrabble, trips to
the museum, visits to elderly relatives. The reality is our children
would probably opt to spend the extra time shooting baskets, talking
on the phone or watching TV.</TE>
<TE>   But maybe less homework would mean more kids would get to sleep at
a reasonable hour and fewer would trundle off to school bleary-eyed
in the morning. And I'd welcome the chance to pass one night without
having to order a child inside or force her to put away her book
because homework dictates that she finish a word search puzzle or
fashion a set of clothes for Colonial paper dolls.</TE>
<TE>   After all, what counts in the long run is not how many hours a kid
tallies at the kitchen table doing math worksheets or gluing sugar
cubes together.</TE>
<TE>   What matters is whether the child can do the work a class requires
and takes responsibility for being an equal partner in the learning
process.</TE>
<TE>   It's common sense, Simpson says: "If Johnny knows calculus, he's
mastered the concepts, what's the logic of lowering his grade because
he hasn't turned in all his homework assignments?"</TE>
<TE>   And I think back to another parent-teacher session, this one at my
daughter's middle school last fall.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't particularly care if they do their homework," announced
the math teacher, a battle-weary public school veteran. "I count it
because the district makes me." She ignored parents' raised eyebrows
and rolling eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "What matters to me is whether they can do the work.... If they
need to practice what we learn in class, it's up to them to do their
[homework] assignments. But homework's for their benefit, not mine.
It's what they do on the tests that counts toward their grade."</TE>

<LD>Coming home from school, Mark skimmed along on his skateboard, ready
to climb the steps of the jacaranda tree and look out over the
housetops. But as he came around the corner, he screeched to a halt.</LD>
<LD>   "Oh, no!" he yelled, not believing what he saw. Somebody had cut
the tree almost to the ground. Only the trunk and a few thick
branches were left. Who had done this ... and why?</LD>
<LD>   Dad came out of the front door.</LD>
<TE>   "What happened?" Mark wailed.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sorry," Dad said. "Mr. DiCosta came over after you left. He
was walking with a cane ..."</TE>
<TE>   "A cane?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah. He said he slipped on the blossoms when he went out to get
the morning paper and twisted his ankle. He was really upset and said
he didn't want any of those blossoms in his yard. They were a big
mess, he said, and raking them up was too much work."</TE>
<TE>   "But why did the tree have to be so chopped up?"</TE>
<TE>   "Here's what happened. I was late for work, so when Mr. DiCosta
said he'd call someone and take care of it, if I'd pay half the cost,
I said OK. I had no idea he'd go this far."</TE>
<TE>   "Did you talk to Mr. DiCosta about what happened?"</TE>
<TE>   "I tried, but he didn't answer the door. Anyway, it'll probably
grow back next year."</TE>
<TE>   "Probably?" thought Mark.</TE>
<TE>   In his room, Mark e-mailed Stacey: "The jacaranda tree started to
bloom today, but something awful has happened. The tree is almost
gone! Mr. DiCosta, the man who bought your house, had all the
branches cut off! He was mad because he slipped on the blossoms. The
steps are still there, but that's about it. He's so mean. I'm too
freaked out to write anymore. Mark."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday: Will the tree ever be the same?</TE>
<TE>   This is Marjorie Flathers' third jacaranda story for the Kids'
Reading Room. She too was shocked when a jacaranda tree near her home
was cut back severely, but she is enjoying the other beautiful
jacarandas in bloom and hopes you are too. This story will be on The
Times' Web site at www.latimes.com/kids.</TE>

<DH>Rosanna Arquette interviews some very prominent co-workers
for her film about gender politics in Hollywood</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RACHEL ABRAMOWITZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CANNES, France</DL>
<LD>"I feel seasick," says the featherweight Rosanna Arquette, staring
down at her appetizer, orange gazpacho with a dash of pesto served in
a shot glass. Although she flew her favorite chef from Los Angeles to
cook this, the tethered yacht sways ever so slightly on the
Mediterranean, and Arquette blanches.</LD>
<LD>   Why shouldn't she feel seasick? She hasn't slept in 48 hours, too
nervous before her film debuted at the Cannes Film Festival and too
revved up to sleep afterward.</LD>
<LD>   She's ensconced on this boat festooned with what looks like
product placements for such cheesy wares as the Original Hollywood
Celebrity Diet (looks like juice) and Slender Water (well, looks like
water). There's even a man in the corner cutting artfully placed
holes in T-shirts to "customize" them.</LD>
<TE>   They are incongruous accouterments to Arquette's directorial
debut--the earnestly searching documentary "Searching for Debra
Winger," her highly idiosyncratic journey to find why actress Winger,
star of such films as "Terms of Endearment" and "Urban Cowboy,"
bailed on Hollywood for six years to raise her children. (She
returned briefly at the last Cannes in her husband Arliss Howard's
directorial debut.)</TE>
<TE>   In the process, Arquette interviewed a dream roster of celebrity
actresses, including Jane Fonda, Holly Hunter, Meg Ryan, Vanessa
Redgrave and Gwyneth Paltrow, about how they balance life and work,
how they cope with the voracious demands of the fame machine and an
industry that jettisons its women as soon as the wrinkles appear.</TE>
<TE>   Although her perfectly flat stomach peeks out from above her white
hip-hugger jeans, and a frothy print blouse encases her upper frame,
Arquette freely admits that she's at an age, 42, when Hollywood
usually sends women out to pasture. According to the Screen Actors
Guild, fewer than 10% of screen roles go to women older than 40.
Arquette, who's best known for the '80s hit "Desperately Seeking
Susan," says the age question began to nag at her when she was...36.</TE>
<TE>   "That's when it really hit me. You go gosh, wow. And it seems to
be getting younger and younger, because now we have 19-year-olds on
the cover of magazines. The models are 14. It's getting younger and
younger and harder for women. I also gave birth at 35, so I was still
breast-feeding. That didn't help things in the work field either."</TE>
<TE>   Arquette calls the movie, which consumed the last 14 months of her
life and 170 hours of film, a "Rosanna Arquette experience," which
might start a few eyes rolling until she explains, "I never
approached the project as a director," or for that matter as an
actress. "I look at the footage sometimes, and I go, 'Oh, my God,
I'll never work again. I look so bad.' But I was always worried about
them. I was just thinking about these women I was trying to talk to."</TE>
<TE>   There are undoubtedly more professional interviewers, but the
film's roughhewn quality is part of its charm. Usually outfitted in
punky rock star garb, Arquette is a gushy, girlish fan. Her status as
a fellow celebrity clearly persuaded a lot of famous women to let
down their guard, and the result is a kind of celebrity slumber
party. It's all the issues women complain about to other women, and
it delivers on the fantasy that the rich and famous are really just
like you and me.</TE>
<TE>   What's interesting is that a number of the women are more
interesting in real life than they're allowed to appear on screen.
Though Whoopi Goldberg can be unctuous at the Oscars, here she's
hilarious and acerbic on everything from the difficulty of living
with a man ("Everyone who's living with you who's not you is a
problem") to her randy rage on how Hollywood desexualizes older
women.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan chafes about the vilification she's undergone in the tabloids
since she dumped her husband, Dennis Quaid, and consequently her
image as America's sweetheart. That wasn't the end of life but the
beginning. "I've been under a rock for a long time," says Ryan, now
the proud possessor of a pierced bellybutton. "It's ironic. I'm the
most empowered I ever felt, and if you read about me you'd feel so
sorry for me.... As a sexualized woman out in the world, you take so
many hits."</TE>
<TE>   The emotional star is Fonda, both because footage of her actually
talking is increasingly rare and because she's so direct: "On our
second date, Ted [Turner, now her ex-husband] made it real clear that
if it was going to work, that I would have to give up my career, and
I'm thinking, 'Boy, this guy's really crazy. I mean, he's only been
out with me once before.'</TE>
<TE>   "I've worked all my life and supported my families, but I decided
that I'd had a career and I'd won the awards and all that kind of
thing, but I'd never really had an intimate relationship. You have to
figure out what ultimately will you regret that you don't have. And I
wasn't going to regret 10 more movies or five more movies, I was
going to regret lack of intimacy."</TE>
<TE>   It sounds reasonable until later in the film, when Fonda describes
the high of performing the perfect part at the perfect moment, a
feeling better than sex, a moment close to transcendence.</TE>
<TE>   "The Jane stuff is actually very inspiring. The love of her art
and her craft--it's what she misses. The one thing she misses is the
best thing ever. That's what's so painful," says Arquette, who says
she spent a lot of the interview crying alongside Fonda. "It was an
amazing moment, but for the film I thought it would be a little
much."</TE>
<TE>   Arquette does ultimately find Winger, looking beautiful in her
suburban backyard, apparently unfazed by nearby train tracks and the
sounds of trains whizzing by. Winger encapsulates how Hollywood
treats women by an encounter she had with legendary producer Don
Simpson on the set of "An Officer and a Gentleman." She was 23, and
Simpson arrived at her hotel bearing a pill that he said would rid
her of water retention because he thought she looked bloated. Winger
didn't like how "show business just made me rough and hard."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Winger says, it took five years to wean herself off
the Hollywood limelight. "It took me that long to really believe that
I wasn't addicted and that my life would be good, because it's scary,
especially if you started early, if you were successful young."</TE>
<TE>   Arquette says the $600,000 film (financed by billionaire Internet
entrepreneurs Mark Cuban and Todd Wagner) is far more personal than
any of the more than 50 films and TV shows she appeared in. "It's the
most raw. It's really me. I never intended to be in it. I wanted
Carrie Fisher to do it, but people would say, 'No, this has to be
your journey.' And I was so afraid."</TE>
<TE>   She's also wary about the critical evaluations to come.
(She's still looking for a distributor.) Already this celebrity home movie
has its champions and its detractors. Referring to the Arquette clan
of actors, which includes her sister Patricia, brothers David and
Alexis and their late grandfather Cliff, Arquette says, "As a family,
all of us have this street kid...." She doesn't finish her sentence
but lifts her dukes and makes improbably tiny fists. "We're tough.
But when they go after you for something you put out there, it's hard
to have a thick skin."</TE>
<TE>   She pauses, realizing she's beginning to walk in
linguistic circles. "I actually hear myself contradicting myself. There's
part of me that's really tough," she says as if to remind herself, "and
part of me going, 'This is my work. I just wish you'd like it.'"</TE>

<LD>Twentieth Century Fox overestimated the three-day opening weekend
gross of "Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones" by $6 million,
but George Lucas' much-anticipated science-fiction saga still easily
captured the No. 1 spot at the box office.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of $86.2 million, which the media hyped all day Sunday,
the movie actually took in $80 million. That's the third-best
three-day opening in history behind Columbia Pictures' "Spider-Man"
and Warner Bros.' "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone." The film
also achieved the second-fastest sprint to the magical $100-million
mark--a mere four days. The film, which opened Thursday, has grossed
$110.2 million through Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, Universal's romantic comedy "About a Boy," starring
Hugh Grant, opened in fourth place with $8.6 million.</LD>

<HD>'CQ' Romances the '60s</HD>
<DH>Movies* Having made a name in music videos and commercials,
Roman Coppola turns to film with a project that reflects his
interests and goals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDRE CHAUTARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roman Coppola reclines in his chair in his cramped office at the
Directors Bureau, the flourishing commercial and music video
production company he co-founded with Mike Mills in 1996. He's
discussing "CQ," his feature directing debut, which he calls a "first
film about a first film" and "a big love letter to the cinema of the
'60's."</LD>
<LD>   "Largely it's meant to be a fun romp in that time and place and a
chance as a first-time filmmaker to try a lot of stuff. I got to do a
personal film, I got to do a car chase, I got to do a dramatic film,"
Coppola says. "And it is a little disjointed or crazy or whatever,
but I think it celebrates that too."</LD>
<LD>   "CQ," which opens Friday, follows Paul, a young American filmmaker
played by Jeremy Davies, in Paris in 1969 as he edits a campy sci-fi
spy flick titled "Dragonfly" by day and at night works on an intimate
black-and-white documentary of his home life with his increasingly
frustrated girlfriend, played by Elodie Bouchez ("The Dreamlife of
Angels").</LD>
<TE>   As Paul is drawn further into his work, reality and fantasy begin
to blur. Long infatuated with the films, music and look of late 1960s
Europe, Coppola suffuses "CQ" with nods to numerous films of the era,
from kitsch like "Barbarella" to the poetic masterpieces of Federico
Fellini and Jean-Luc Godard.</TE>
<TE>   "CQ" "reeks of Roman," says Jason Schwartzman, Coppola's cousin,
who plays a wunderkind director in the film. "He's always had a
million fascinations, and he's found some way to put at least 2% of
each of those fascinations in this film."</TE>
<TE>   The Directors Bureau is housed just off of Hollywood Boulevard in
an unmarked building, rumored to have once been Ed Wood's studio. A
couple of dogs noisily roam the workplace, their barks and the
adjoining office's phone conversations penetrating the thin walls.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing a gray sports jacket and a light blue shirt, Coppola, 37,
runs his hands through his hair and swivels in his seat as he ticks
off some of the many films "CQ" references: "Modesty Blaise," "The
10th Victim," "THX-1138," "Diva," "Girl on a Motorcycle," "Last Tango
in Paris," "Contempt."</TE>
<TE>   Son of filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola and brother of director
Sofia Coppola ("The Virgin Suicides"), Roman is a music video and
commercials director, perhaps best known for the award-winning music
video for Fatboy Slim's "Praise You," which featured Sofia's husband
and "Being John Malkovich" director Spike Jonze.</TE>
<TE>   Coppola has also directed videos for Moby, the Strokes, the
Presidents of the United States, Wyclef Jean and Green Day (the
Grammy-nominated "Walking Contradiction"). He has filmed eye-catching
commercials for a slew of companies, among them the Gap, Levi's, ESPN
and the Game Show Network.</TE>
<TE>   Coppola had been wanting to direct a feature but hadn't found a
project he felt would be distinctive. Because of his reputation and
family name, he knew the film "would be examined more closely, and I
wanted to really feel in my heart that it was something that only I
could do, whether it was good or bad," he says.</TE>
<TE>   He started with a title, "CQ"--Morse code for the phrase "seek
you," a call for contact--a metaphor for trying to connect. Coppola
was particularly inspired after watching the antic 1968 spy adventure
"Danger: Diabolik" and thought it would be interesting to set a film
in 1969 that imagined our present--at the time, the year 2000.</TE>
<TE>   More ideas came from hearing his father's stories of working for
Roger Corman in Europe in the 1960s, shooting extra footage to cut
into films Corman had bought. "He was a young guy who got involved in
this B-movie stuff, aspiring to do more personal type of work, but
happily doing genre stuff," Coppola says of his father.</TE>
<TE>   Coppola also found inspiration in what he calls "the sub-genre of
artist-reflecting-on-their-life movies," films like "8 1/2," "Day for
Night," "Stardust Memories" and "All That Jazz."</TE>
<TE>   One other essential influence on "CQ" was the 1968 conceptual art
film "David Holzman's Diary," a faux documentary account of a week in
the life of a film student, which is a model for "69/70," the cinema
verite film that "CQ's" Paul is making. L.M. Kit Carson, the actor
who played David Holzman, appears in dream sequences of "CQ" as a
dismissive film critic.</TE>
<TE>   "It dawned on me that maybe I could make a movie that somehow was
a fusion of those different types of movies I'm attracted to and
somehow do it all--to make some kind of arty commercial film or
commercial art film," Coppola says.</TE>
<TE>   Targeting More Than Cinephiles</TE>
<TE>   Despite "CQ's" film allusions, "I hope that it's appealing to not
just cinephiles," he says. "It's filled with references and quotes,
but it's meant to be taken as its own movie."</TE>
<TE>   In the lead role of Paul, which he concedes some will see as his
alter ego, Coppola cast Davies, whom he had first seen in "Spanking
the Monkey." For the part of Felix DeMarco, a fun-loving, unwittingly
arrogant hotshot director who is brought in to rework "Dragonfly,"
Coppola cast his cousin Schwartzman ("Rushmore").</TE>
<TE>   Several reviewers have noted a resemblance in Schwartzman's
character to William Friedkin during that era, but Coppola says it's
unintentional. "I'd be embarrassed if William Friedkin thought I was
poking fun at him personally, because it's not true," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Casting the part of Valentine, the actress who plays the sexy spy
Dragonfly, was more challenging. After Coppola auditioned scores of
women, several people separately but coincidentally suggested model
Angela Lindvall.</TE>
<TE>   He met with Lindvall at a hotel in New York, where she did a cold
reading on videotape. She initially turned down the part. "I've never
acted before and I thought maybe I'd ruin the film if I did it, so I
just decided no," she says. Coppola tracked her down at a photo shoot
in Spain and convinced her to go for it. "</TE>
<TE>   The eclectic cast also includes Gerard Depardieu as a
temperamental auteur, Giancarlo Giannini as a Dino De Laurentiis-type
producer, Dean Stockwell as Paul's father, John Phillip Law (of
"Diabolik" and "Barbarella") as Dragonfly's employer and Billy Zane
as an outer space revolutionary in the "Dragonfly" film.</TE>
<TE>   "CQ" was unveiled at Cannes last year, where it drew mixed reviews
and where the talk of the festival was Francis Ford Coppola's
re-edited "Apocalypse Now Redux"--admittedly, Roman Coppola says, "a
pretty hard act to follow."</TE>
<TE>   He's less stung by the reviews, which he expected, than worried
that they could dissuade audiences who might like the film.</TE>
<TE>   For his next film, Coppola is still kicking around ideas, but he
keeps himself busy at the Directors Bureau, where the mandate is "to
try to do things that are fresh and original and still work
commercially. To try to straddle that thing which again comes up in
my life and my movie," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Among Coppola's recent projects: music videos for the Strokes and
buzzed-about Australian band the Vines, and a commercial for the Gap
with Ashton Kutcher.</TE>
<TE>   With friends and colleagues like Jonze, Mills and Michel Gondry
("Human Nature") now working in features, Coppola believes there is a
burgeoning community of young talent, perhaps one that hearkens back
to the New Wave directors upon which "CQ" draws.</TE>
<TE>   Seeing his sister, who has a cameo in "CQ" as a producer's
mistress, make the well-received "The Virgin Suicides" inspired
Coppola to get moving on his own first film.</TE>
<TE>   "If you ask my friends, I'm kind of a slowpoke," he says. "My
friends say, 'When are you getting married? When are you having
kids?' I'm 37, so I guess I'm pretty mature, but at the same time I
feel like a kid."</TE>

<HD>Neo-Soul Singer Chooses Grooves Over Grind</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD CROMELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's fine if she's opinionated.... It's OK if she has kids (hey,
things happen).... It doesn't even matter that she won't always look
as good as she does now....</LD>
<LD>   That's the way it works with women in Musiq's world, a place where
a suitor can't wait to meet his girl's parents, and where a man
complains about a woman's refusal to make a commitment.</LD>
<LD>   You can see why someone who treats a woman as a whole, complicated
person would register with an audience weary of pop's superficial and
demeaning portrayals of the gender. That might be one big reason that
Musiq's new album, "Juslisen," entered the national sales chart at
No. 1 last week.</LD>
<TE>   Not that the singer-songwriter is selling sensitivity in a
plain-wrap package. Musiq (born Talib Johnson) is part of the
Philadelphia branch of the neo-soul renaissance (a delegation that
also includes Jill Scott and Bilal), and in the first of his two
shows Sunday at the House of Blues in West Hollywood, Musiq
emphasized grit and grooves over the sexual politics.</TE>
<TE>   The capacity audience didn't seem to mind--dancing, clapping,
singing along and waving their arms as Musiq and his 10-member band
mounted an aggressive attack, shifting the musical scenery from house
party to church.</TE>
<TE>   Marvin Gaye, Donny Hathaway and Stevie Wonder are the primary
touchstones of the style, and the sound Sunday was a catchy if
conservative homage to the big beats, tart chording and liquid
textures of that era.</TE>
<TE>   But Musiq could have kept the music on high heat and still served
his themes better. Two of the better new songs he played would have
been perfect launching pads for some expansive testifying, especially
now that he has injected a heavy dose of Al Green gospel into his
musical palette: "Halfcrazy," a perceptive anatomy of a friendship
that sours when it crosses the line into romance, and "Caught Up,"
about a girl who was once too young but now isn't.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to imagine the Rev. Green, for one, resisting the
opportunity to expound, but Musiq never delved, using his spoken
comments mainly to celebrate his popularity and express his gratitude
to his audience.</TE>
<TE>   Musiq (who dropped the surname Soulchild along the way) has been
moving toward stardom, but with the sudden impact of "Juslisen," he's
challenging to the big boys, i.e., D'Angelo and Maxwell. If he wants
to leave more of an impression in that company, he'll need to fire up
the presentation.</TE>
<TE>   His singing, mostly in a grainy middle range, is straightforward
and free of excessive ornamentation, fitting the let's-be-real nature
of his songs. But it also tends to get lost in the arrangements.
Despite the hipster's sunglasses and the suggestion of
self-mythologizing in his name, Musiq's image on stage is that of a
staunch, stand-up guy, and his performance lacked the sexual
electricity and sheer charisma his rivals can deploy.</TE>
<TE>   Second-billed Cee-Lo, whose solo debut, "Cee-Lo Green and His
Perfect Imperfections," is one of the most acclaimed rap albums so
far this year, looked like a mini-Shaq as he rapped and sang his way
through a mix of rock, country, swampy hip-hop and heavy funk.
Mock-stern and unfailingly playful, the rotund member of Atlanta's
Goodie Mob even referenced Boy George and Frankie Goes to Hollywood
during his infectiously rambunctious set.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Musiq, with Cee-Lo, plays tonight at the House of Blues Anaheim,
1530 S. Disneyland Drive, Anaheim, 8 p.m. $25. (714) 778-2583.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Just before George Lucas reissued his "Star Wars" movies to celebrate
the 20th anniversary of the original film's 1977 release, I flew up
to his Skywalker Ranch for a rare audience with the publicity-shy
filmmaker. It was a gloomy winter day, and I remember sitting in his
office, waiting for him to arrive, studying a painting that depicted,
in elaborate detail, the enmeshed gears inside a clock. For Lucas,
the painting represented the triumph of craftsmanship.</LD>
<LD>   "I guess that's what fascinates me," he said. "The way a 16th
century clockmaker would build a complicated clock. I'm a person who
makes things that are intricate. Whether you're a clockmaker or a
filmmaker, that's what you do--you create things that work."</LD>
<LD>   I thought of Lucas' painting after seeing his new "Star Wars"
prequel, "Episode II Attack of the Clones," which like its immediate
predecessor, "Episode I The Phantom Menace," is a bitter
disappointment for anyone with an abiding affection for Lucas'
original trilogy of futurist fantasies. Like the painting, Lucas' new
movies are packed with meticulous visual detail. But they are a
forlorn triumph of mechanics--they have no spirit or soul. Even
worse, they look like the work of a director who's used the miracle
of modern computer technology to wall himself off from the messy
unpredictability of the outside world.</LD>
<TE>   It's what happens when an artist works in creative isolation.
Success is often the worst thing that can happen to a filmmaker. The
brash self-confidence that artists use for emotional support often
mutates into an arrogance that cuts them off from their audience--and
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Millions of fans have already seen "Attack of the Clones," (it
grossed $110.2 million in its first four days) lining up, as the New
York Times' A. O. Scott put it, "out of habit and compulsion, like
weary Brezhnev-era Muscovites." But something has gone horribly
wrong. What has drained the new movies of their magic? Sad to say,
the fault lies not in the stars, but with their creator.</TE>
<TE>   Lucas should never have directed the movies himself. After
"Phantom Menace" arrived with a thud, the filmmaker's defenders said
he was simply rusty--he hadn't directed a movie since the original
"Star Wars." Things would be better next time. Well, they aren't.
Like its predecessor, "Clones" is missing what we crave from great
films--vibrant storytelling, narrative clarity, compelling drama and
good acting (with exemptions granted to Ewan McGregor and Christopher
Lee).</TE>
<TE>   For all its state-of-the-art technology, "Clones" has an air of
musty nostalgia; it lacks the emotional intensity of "The Lord of the
Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" or the playful verve of "Spider-
Man." Outside of a few inspiring action sequences and a
crowd-pleasing light-saber duel between Yoda and the evil Count
Dooku, the movie has no sense of pacing. It's slowed by endless plot
exposition, portentous foreshadowing and a series of hapless romantic
encounters between Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman.</TE>
<TE>   To be blunt, "Star Wars" doesn't need Lucas behind the camera any
more than the James Bond series needed original 007 director Terence
Young to survive. The second and third "Star Wars" films did just
fine in the hands of journeymen directors Irvin Kershner and Richard
Marquand. The new movies would've benefited from independent-minded
younger directors who might have challenged some of Lucas' cobwebby
creative impulses.</TE>
<TE>   Lucas' best work was made with strong collaborators: Lawrence
Kasdan, for example, wrote "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and was a
co-writer on "Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi."</TE>
<TE>   As he proved in the "Indiana Jones" movies (Lucas produced them
along with director Steven Spielberg) and in the development of
Industrial Light and Magic, the industry's top special-effects
company, Lucas' talents are probably better suited as a conceptual
thinker and producer than director. He's never liked directing
anyway. Harrison Ford said that when he was shooting "Star Wars," the
only direction Lucas gave him was, "OK, same thing, only better" and
"Faster, more intense."</TE>
<TE>   Editing was Lucas' first love. As his old friend film editor
Walter Murch once told me: "George only became a director so he could
have better material to edit."</TE>
<TE>   The 'Random Chaos' of Filmmaking</TE>
<TE>   Murch, a buddy from Lucas' film school days who probably
understands his psyche as well as anyone, is convinced that Lucas
turned his back on directing for more than two decades because he
abhorred what Murch calls the "random chaos" of filmmaking.</TE>
<TE>   "If you told George you'd invented a marvelous new machine where
you could attach a set of electrodes to your temple lobes and simply
think the film into the machine, and it would come out exactly the
way you imagined it in your head, he'd buy it and get rid of
everything else in an instant."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Lucas did the next best thing: He created ILM, which,
along with Lucas' pioneering efforts in digital video, has allowed
him to shift much of his energy to post-production, where he can deal
with computer animators instead of ornery actors or unpredictable
weather, thereby cutting down considerably on the level of random
chaos. The results have changed the shape of cinema.</TE>
<TE>   Most of this summer's big movies are packed with fantasy heroes
and special effects inspired in large part by the "Star Wars" and
"Indiana Jones" series, and 3-D computer animation has also been the
driving force in children's films like "Toy Story" and "Monsters,
Inc.," both creations of Pixar, a company started by Lucas that he
later sold to Steve Jobs.</TE>
<TE>   But the differences between the ways Lucas and Pixar pursue ideas
are striking. At Pixar, collaboration and self-criticism are an
integral part of the process. On several Pixar movies, including "Toy
Story 2," the company stopped the projects in mid-development,
throwing out huge chunks of story lines and fixing other elements
before forging ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Lucas works in seclusion. Whatever feedback he receives is from
friends and underlings, not peers. No one seems to deliver bad news.
He told reporters recently that problems with "Phantom Menace" were
"totally in the media [and] not based on fact.... I wouldn't change
anything about it."</TE>
<TE>   It's telling that Lucas appeared shocked that people took offense
to "Phantom Menace's" Jar Jar Binks, the bumbling animated character
who sounds like a Jamaican resort pool boy. Lucas dismissed the
charges of racial stereotyping as "ridiculous" and blamed them on
newspaper stories, saying none of his black friends had taken
offense.</TE>
<TE>   Presidents and corporate tycoons lose touch with reality just as
often as filmmakers. But it's especially painful to watch artists who
were once so plugged into the culture fall so out of touch. It's
happened to Woody Allen and Martin Scorsese, two cinema gods whose
recent movies have been woefully self-absorbed and emotionally
stunted.</TE>
<TE>   But no one is more isolated than Lucas. Set on 6,000 acres of
rolling hills in rural Marin County, his sprawling Skywalker Ranch is
like 19th century Japan--a wonderland cut off from the rest of the
world. It has its own inn, yoga studio, horse stables, vineyard and
fire department.</TE>
<TE>   Seeing the mock 19th century California winery buildings after
being waved through by a guard wearing a Skywalker Fire Brigade arm
patch, you feel as if you've stumbled onto the set of Lucas' version
of "The Truman Show." The buildings' designs are based on a Lucas
short story about an imaginary 19th century railroad tycoon building
his dream homestead.</TE>
<TE>   When Lucas and Spielberg were preparing "Raiders of the Lost Ark,"
they spent an afternoon in a Universal screening room, watching
episodes of "Don Winslow of the Navy," one of their beloved 1940s
adventure yarns. But their childhood memories had tricked them--the
serials were appallingly bad. Spielberg was so depressed he almost
quit the project. Lucas shook his head, saying, "Geez, these things
sure don't hold up after 25 years."</TE>
<TE>   I hate to be the one to tell you, George, but when people watch
"Attack of the Clones" 25 years from now, they're going to feel the
same way.</TE>

<LD>Within the Japanese American community, the exploits and bravery of
the 442nd Regimental Combat Team has achieved near-mythic status.</LD>
<LD>   Made up of Japanese Americans, the World War II Army unit stands
as the most decorated unit of its size in U.S. military history.
Documentaries have been made about the 442nd, and Hollywood even
produced a 1951 feature film on the unit, titled "Go for Broke."</LD>
<LD>   But unlike the well-publicized heroics of the men of the 442nd in
Europe, the actions of the Japanese American soldiers who served in
that war's Pacific campaign have gone relatively unnoticed.</LD>
<TE>   This is a primary reason why gayle yamada spent 20 months
producing, writing and directing "Uncommon Courage: Patriotism and
Civil Liberties." The 60-minute documentary airs tonight on KCET and
focuses on the contributions the Japanese American soldiers made to
their country in the Pacific theater.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of Japanese Americans don't even know about the nisei
[second generation Japanese American] soldiers in the Pacific
campaign," says yamada, a veteran Sacramento-based writer and
broadcast journalist, who says she began spelling her name lowercase
in high school. "She says that while making the film, "I would run
into people in the community who would tell me it was the first time
they had heard about these men. I was stunned."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the soldiers of the 442nd and the 100th Infantry Battalion
(another all-Japanese American unit that fought against the fascists
in Europe), those who saw action in the Pacific were predominantly
linguists who interrogated Japanese soldiers and translated
documents.</TE>
<TE>   They were part of a U.S. Army group called the Military
Intelligence Service, or MIS. While some found themselves on the
front lines, they didn't incur the enormous casualties that befell
the nisei soldiers who were in the thick of battle in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   But the experiences of the Japanese American solider in Europe and
the Pacific are similar from the standpoint that while they were both
serving their country in war, most of them had family members back
home living in American internment camps. After the United States and
Japan went to war in 1941, all people of Japanese ancestry living on
the West Coast were quickly dispatched to camps enclosed by barbed
wire and guarded by armed soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   Brothers Harry and Ken Acune were just 21 and 18, respectively,
when they volunteered for U.S. military service in 1942. At the time,
both were interned at a camp in Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   "Before the war, I didn't have the full freedoms that other
Americans had," recalls Harry Acune, a Gardena resident who is
featured in "Uncommon Courage." "For example, I wasn't allowed to
swim at the public swimming pool. But I still felt very free. When we
lost that freedom, I was in shock. It made me very angry. We could
have objected, and young people today feel like we should have. But
in my mind, actions speak louder than words. We felt that somebody
had to stand up and say we are Americans too. And when they gave us
an opportunity to prove that, we did and volunteered for military
service."</TE>
<TE>   "Uncommon Courage" documents how important Japanese American
soldiers were to winning the war in the Pacific against the Japanese.
People like the Acune brothers were invaluable because they possessed
fluent Japanese and English language skills. While both were born and
raised in the U.S., they spent three years during their teen years
living in Japan, where they learned how to read and write Japanese.</TE>
<TE>   Harry Acune helped save many American lives after parachuting
behind enemy lines in the Philippines, translating a note found on a
dead Japanese soldier that indicated there was a much larger Japanese
force in the area than first thought. The U.S. Army quickly changed
its strategy to a defensive posture.</TE>
<TE>   The documentary also reveals a few incidences of overt and subtle
racism that nisei soldiers faced in the American Army. A group of
Japanese American soldiers was once required to dress up as Japanese
soldiers so that other American soldiers could get an idea of what
the enemy looked like.</TE>
<TE>   Even though they were clad in U.S. military fatigues, Japanese
American soldiers were often closely accompanied by non-Asian
American escorts when they approached battle areas for fear they
would be mistaken for the enemy.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most fascinating aspects of "Uncommon Courage" are the
stories of Japanese American soldiers who had brothers fighting for
the Japanese military. The Acunes, who had been sent to the United
States to work and help support the family, had two brothers who were
drafted into the Japanese army who were living in Japan with their
father at the time.</TE>
<TE>   "Before the war ended, we were slated to go into the area where my
father and siblings lived in Japan," says Harry Acune. "It was a
dreadful thought for me. I knew the Japanese were going to [arm
civilians]. But if it came to pointing guns at each other, I wouldn't
have hesitated. I just hoped that if I ran across my brothers or
father that I wouldn't recognize them and that I would look at them
only as an enemy."</TE>
<TE>   For yamada, making "Uncommon Courage" was partly a personal
journey, since her father served in the Military Intelligence Service
and is featured in the documentary. "After making the film, I have a
better understanding of how my parents' generation fought for us and
how they passed their values on to us," she says. "It also made me
see that Japanese American history is important to Americans of all
ethnicities."</TE>

<CX>   Japanese American soldiers--An index item in Tuesday's Calendar
incorrectly stated that the PBS documentary "Uncommon Courage"
focuses on members of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team in the Pacific
theater in World War II. In fact, the 442nd's members fought in
Europe, and the film documents the exploits of Japanese American
soldiers who fought in the Pacific.</CX>

<LD>   'Survivor' Wins Hotly Contested Sunday Night</LD>
<LD>   CBS' "Survivor: Marquesas" emerged victorious from what was billed
as one of the most competitive nights in recent memory Sunday, going
up against the "X-Files" finale, "The Cosby Show" reunion and a
season-ending two-hour "The Practice."</LD>
<TE>   "Survivor's" fourth edition, which saw Portland, Ore., office
manager Vecepia Towery win the $1-million prize, averaged 25.4
million viewers from 8 to 10 p.m., according to preliminary Nielsen
estimates, compared to an audience of 13 million for "The X-Files."
Both "The Practice" and "The Cosby Show" ran from 9 to 11 p.m.,
averaging roughly 13 million and 18 million viewers, respectively,
with "Cosby" steadily building and beating "Survivor's" post-show
from Central Park in the final half-hour, after the winner was
revealed.</TE>
<TE>   All told, nearly 70 million people were watching the four major
networks from 9 to 10 p.m., when all four programs were competing.</TE>

<TE>   Bing Sues Kerkorian, Alleges Privacy Invasion</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood producer Steve Bing, who's fighting a paternity claim by
model-actress Elizabeth Hurley, has filed a $1-billion-plus invasion
of privacy and trespassing lawsuit against MGM studio mogul Kirk
Kerkorian.</TE>
<TE>   The Superior Court lawsuit claims the 84-year-old Kerkorian was
behind an effort to dig through Bing's trash for dental floss in an
effort to avoid child support payments by proving--through DNA
analysis--that Bing fathered the 4-year-old daughter of Kerkorian's
ex-wife.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the richest men in the world ... schemed to steal
someone's DNA from the garbage and to have that DNA tested without
consent in a disgusting effort to publicly smear and disparage his
ex-wife," said Bing, a former writer for the sitcom "Married ... With
Children" and producer of the 2000 remake of "Get Carter."</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Bonder Kerkorian, 37, has asked the court to award her
$320,000 a month to support daughter Kira. Kerkorian wants the amount
no higher than the $50,000 a month he's paying now.</TE>
<TE>   Kerkorian attorney Terry Christensen said Friday that DNA tests on
the dental floss proved with 99.993% certainty that Bing was Kira's
biological father. "Did we use a little self-help [in obtaining the
sample]? Sure. But it was discarded and it belonged to waste
management at that point," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bing said in his lawsuit that he "always agreed that if it turned
out that he was in fact the child's biological father, he would act
appropriately--just in a private fashion."</TE>
<TE>   THE ARTS</TE>
<TE>   Arts Education Boosts Academics, Study Shows</TE>
<TE>   Arts education, an endangered species in the nation's strapped
public school systems, has far-reaching benefits, a new study
concludes.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Arts Education Partnership--whose research was
coordinated by UCLA--students exposed to drama, music and dance find
that those courses also improve their performance in academic
subjects. Studying music improves math achievement, cognitive
development and boosts SAT verbal scores, while the visual arts
improve a child's reading and writing skills--especially among poor
students or those requiring remedial instruction.</TE>
<TE>   "Notions that the arts are frivolous add-ons to a serious
curriculum couldn't be further from the truth," said James Catterall,
a UCLA education professor who coordinated the study, the first to
compare the impact on other academic disciplines.</TE>
<TE>   Though President Bush has requested $11 million to support arts
education projects, teachers often complain that those are the
courses first cut in schools with budget deficits.</TE>
<TE>   The Arts Education Partnership is a coalition of more than 100
arts, education, governmental and philanthropic groups nationwide.</TE>

<TE>   'Poisoned Pellet' Discourages CD Piracy</TE>
<TE>   Copycats beware! Sony Music has planted a "poisoned pellet" of
software in the European version of Celine Dion's latest CD, "A New
Day Has Come."</TE>
<TE>   Those who attempt to make copies of the disc risk having the
optical drives of personal computers crash and, in some cases,
permanently freeze. Warnings that the discs don't play in computers
are on the CD case and on the discs themselves.</TE>
<TE>   In Europe, fans have found that they can't always eject the discs,
and Apple Computer has issued a warning on its Internet support site
offering tips on dealing with the situation.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Sony Music Entertainment told the New York Times
that the discs do no permanent damage to PCs and are part of a
continuing drive in the industry to discourage unauthorized copying.</TE>
<TE>   Though these discs have been distributed only in Europe, she
added, the first tests in the U.S. will begin shortly--starting with
promo discs sent to critics.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   "Thoroughly Modern Millie" was named best musical Sunday at the
47th Drama Desk Awards. "The Goat, or Who is Sylvia" and
"Metamorphosis" were co-winners of the best play honors.... The
influential '70s R&amp;B band Earth, Wind &amp; Fire will receive the ASCAP
Rhythm &amp; Soul Heritage Award at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on June 17.
The band is also being honored at the BET Awards on June 25.</TE>

<HD>One Century's Biting Social Satire Is Another's Sitcom</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>LA JOLLA--Before things get out of control, Cleante asks his
brother-in-law Orgon the question at the heart of the La Jolla
Playhouse's snappy and semi-naughty production of Moliere's
"Tartuffe": "How could you be such a goose?"</LD>
<LD>   Like the rest of us, Cleante (Jonathan Adams) cannot understand
why the wealthy and presumably wise Orgon (John Getz) can be so
bamboozled by that sneaky deceiver Tartuffe (Jefferson Mays).</LD>
<LD>   The answer is simple: Unless Orgon falls hook, line and
inheritance for Tartuffe's fraudulent piety, there is no play. It
does not pay to ask reality-based questions of this or any other
modern "Tartuffe."</LD>
<TE>   When the play hit Paris in 1664, it was a scandalous sendup of the
dimwitted upper classes and the hypocritical and licentious clergy.
But the intervening centuries have sapped nearly all of the zip from
the social satire, and targets that were once deliciously off limits
have become common punching bags.</TE>
<TE>   What remains of "Tartuffe"--particularly with the rhyming couplet
translation of poet Richard Wilbur--are the conventions and pacing of
a TV sitcom. Think of the better episodes of "Frasier," complete with
misunderstandings, randy longings, crisp dialogue and splenetic
verbal combat.</TE>
<TE>   To the credit of Tony Award-winning director Des McAnuff, he has
delivered a "Tartuffe" whipped to a comedic frenzy, light and
unchallenging perhaps, but a definite crowd-pleaser.</TE>
<TE>   Mays, as Tartuffe, is a slick, articulate, reptilian delight, with
an occasional mugging wink at the audience. Getz is both foolish and
likable as Orgon, who gets wised up to Tartuffe's chicanery only late
in the play. Adams as Cleante is suitably exasperated at Orgon and
serves as the voice of blustery and frustrated reason.</TE>
<TE>   But it is the women's roles that shine the brightest and bring
"Tartuffe" alive with one-liners about the ignorance and silliness of
men.</TE>
<TE>   Nadia Bowers as Orgon's daughter Mariane--distressed at her
father's insistence that she marry Tartuffe--is sexy and knowing, and
the hit of the show.</TE>
<TE>   Mariane's servant Dorine (Paget Brewster) is every uppity
underling who speaks the truth even if the boss does not want to hear
it. She explains why women stray from bored and boring husbands:
"Many a man with horns upon his brow made his wife what she is now."</TE>
<TE>   John Campion as the grande dame Madame Pernelle is a delight in
drag. And the farcical seduction scene between Tartuffe--stringy
hair, shabby clothes and all--and Orgon's wife, Elmire (played
wonderfully by Klea Scott), is a show-stopper.</TE>
<TE>   Other productions of "Tartuffe" have the con man as a tall,
well-dressed smoothie, making it easier to understand his hypnotic
appeal. But McAnuff wants nothing between the audience and the
rapid-fire gags, and the result is a funny, if not nuanced portrayal.</TE>
<TE>   Although this "Tartuffe" takes few chances, it does begin and end
with a bit of physicality that is shocking and, in the first
instance, quite eye-pleasing.</TE>
<TE>   There's also a gross-funny bit with Dorine and a novel way of
filling a wine glass. Hint: This is something they cannot do on
television.</TE>

<LD>Love, especially the mother-child variety, can lead people to do some
crazy things. How else to explain it when a woman can't find day care
for her two kids and feels the safest place for them is locked away
in her car's trunk? Or, as a less extreme example, when a grown-up
daughter henpecks her mother about her health so much that they wind
up fighting, with the daughter moving out of the house?</LD>
<LD>   This sort of love, and all its sometimes perverted, sometimes
funny permutations, is the crux of "Judging Amy," which ends its
third season tonight at 10 on CBS. In many ways, this episode
typifies the series, showcasing the acting talents of Amy Brenneman
as family court Judge Amy Gray and Tyne Daly as her mother, Maxine, a
feisty social worker. But tonight's story, written by executive
producer Barbara Hall, is sadly too typical for its own good.</LD>
<LD>   This is not for lack of plot twists: Maxine's old flame Jared
(Richard Crenna) reenters the scene, leading her to make two major
decisions. Amy's court services officer Bruce (Richard T. Jones) is
sentenced in his trial on an assault charge. And Amy faces a custody
fight from her ex, since she and her daughter have moved out of
Maxine's house and into a scummy apartment.</LD>
<TE>   Too many of these maneuvers are telegraphed, though, for them to
have much oomph, while the rest of the show follows the "Amy"
formula: Amy rules on the woman who treats her kids like luggage,
with the pangs of a "judge not, lest ye be judged" conscience; Maxine
bucks the system to solve an abuse case; and Bruce is impenetrably
dour (not entirely surprising, given that Jones sued series producer
20th Century Fox because he wanted to be allowed to leave the show;
he recently dropped the suit and reportedly will return next season).</TE>
<TE>   All these familiar elements can be fun, even comforting, but they
work against the basic premise of a finale that tries to establish
enough topsy-turviness in Amy's world to compel viewers to return
next season. Somehow, no matter how wrong things seem at the
cliffhanger ending, you know they will be righted in due course.</TE>

<HD>Economic Activity Declines in April</HD>
<DH>Report: Drop-off amplifies doubts about whether the
recovery can maintain its strong pace, analysts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. index of leading economic indicators fell during April, the
first drop in seven months, pointing to a moderating pace of
expansion.</LD>
<LD>   Lower stock prices, rising jobless claims and a dip in consumer
confidence contributed to the 0.4% decline in the Conference Board's
index, a gauge of the economy's likely performance over the next
three to six months. The index had risen 0.1% in March, and April's
decrease was twice what analysts had forecast.</LD>
<LD>   The index last fell in September, when terrorists attacked the
World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</LD>
<TE>   "The signal from the indicators is that the recovery is developing
quite slowly," said Ken Goldstein, a Conference Board economist. "The
recovery in the industrial core remains weak. The consumer sector has
seen income growth cut by employment cutbacks and moderating growth
in wages."</TE>
<TE>   Five of the 10 indicators the New York group uses to calculate the
index pushed it down. Besides a drop in consumer confidence and stock
prices, and increased jobless claims, the index was pulled down in
April by a narrower spread between the overnight bank lending rate
and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, and a drop in the money
supply.</TE>
<TE>   Rising building permits, longer vendor delivery times, which
suggest increased demand, and an increase in manufacturers' new
orders for nondefense capital goods limited the decline. There was no
change in the manufacturing workweek or new orders for consumer
goods.</TE>
<TE>   The Conference Board's index of coincident indicators, a gauge of
the current state of the economy, rose 0.2% in April after rising
0.1% in March. The index of lagging indicators fell 0.4% last month,
compared with a 0.9% decline the prior month.</TE>

<HD>To Combat AIDS, Help the Few to Save the Many</HD>
<DH>Targeting the promiscuous for care reduces the disease's

<LD>With Congress seriously considering a historic escalation in the
global battle against AIDS, nobody seems to want to talk about a
profound ethical dilemma: How should the money be spent?</LD>
<LD>   With a stunning 8,000 new HIV infections a day, doing something is
clearly a moral imperative. AIDS activists and public-health workers
advocate increasing the distribution of condoms to stop the disease's
spread and making drugs widely available to help the victims. And on
Capitol Hill, a coalition is forming around AIDS as a children's
issue, with politicians across the ideological spectrum supporting
the distribution of drugs that prevent mothers from passing AIDS to
their unborn children.</LD>
<LD>   Yet, in the campaign to eradicate the worst plague of the modern
era, all these approaches are common-sensical, compassionate--and
doomed. The insights of a burgeoning field of science--the theory of
networks--combined with hard lessons from the front lines suggest
that the best hope lies in helping the promiscuous few, not the
heart-rending many.</LD>
<TE>   Decades of epidemiological studies have assumed that viruses
spread on a social network in which individuals randomly interact
with each other. In the past few years, though, we have learned that
networks are far from random.</TE>
<TE>   My research group, studying the World Wide Web, discovered that it
has a peculiar, nonrandom structure: A few popular hubs, such as
Yahoo or Google, link many small Web pages together. In the broader
world, the same pattern repeats itself. A few key molecules in our
cell's complex chemical web interact with a staggering number of
other molecules to keep us alive.</TE>
<TE>   A handful of large corporations--the economic hubs that have
financial ties to thousands of other companies--dominate our economy.</TE>
<TE>   Hubs, it turns out, are what make networks so resilient.</TE>
<TE>   These discoveries have profound implications for understanding how
AIDS spreads and how to stop it.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, a team of Swedish and American scientists mapped a
network of sexual contacts, a kind of "sex web." They found the same
kind of hub structure seen in other networks; although most people
have one to 10 sexual partners during their lifetime, a few
individuals, such as Wilt Chamberlain, collect thousands.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Italian theorists have offered a shocking
prediction: In networks dominated by hubs, even a disease like
AIDS--which is not highly infectious--will persist and spread.</TE>
<TE>   Hubs play a key role in spreading a virus: They are likely to
become infected because of their many sexual contacts and, once
infected, are likely to spread it to many people.</TE>
<TE>   While the use of condoms may save the individual, they will never
eradicate the epidemic. Nor will drugs, if not given to all.</TE>
<TE>   Given limited resources, the unique role of the hubs suggests a
bold but cruel solution: When there is not enough money to help
everybody who needs it, we should primarily give it to the hubs.
Indeed, if we identify and help all the individuals who have many
potential sexual partners, the number of newly infected cases will
drastically decrease. The more hubs we target, the higher the chance
that the epidemic will die out.</TE>
<TE>   An effective AIDS policy requires more than money for drugs. We
need the resources to quickly identify the hubs, and then we must
have the mandate to single them out. Epidemiologists have long known
the important role that prostitutes play in spreading sexually
transmitted diseases. What the new science of networks is telling us
is that any AIDS policy that ignores them is destined to fail.</TE>
<TE>   Such a policy that targets individuals, of course, raises
important ethical questions. Should society "reward" promiscuity? But
with so many people dying every day, the real question is this: What
is the best way to save the most people?</TE>

<HD>In Maiming Israeli Bodies, Bombers Maim the Soul</HD>
<DH>Individual pain is a tool of terror.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS RENE BERES and MICHAEL L. MESSING</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What, exactly, does the Palestinian suicide bomber really seek? Above
all, he wants to transform Jewish pain into Arab power. In maiming
and burning Jewish men, women and children, this terrorist reasons
that pain, to be purposeful, must point convincingly toward the
victim's death but that even survivors must suffer terribly.</LD>
<LD>   In the fashion of the torturer, the Palestinian suicide bomber
takes what is usually private and incommunicable--the pain contained
within the boundaries of the sufferer's body--and exploits it to
affect the behavior of others.</LD>
<LD>   Consider the personal horror. During the routine rotation of a
radiologist in a busy city hospital, a broad variety of patient
problems is seen. But things are now very different in Israeli
hospitals.</LD>
<TE>   With the wave of suicide bombings, unique and hideous trauma has
become a regular part of the Israeli physician's daily practice.</TE>
<TE>   X-rays of suicide bombing victims often show hundreds of metallic
fragments, ranging in size from millimeters to whole nails,
grotesquely embedded in the victims' bodies--literally from head to
foot. Like so many others across history's killing fields, Arab
terrorists have transformed simple devices created for constructive
purposes--in this case, nails--into the deadliest of destructive
projectiles.</TE>
<TE>   Nails, screws, nuts and ball bearings are packed by the suicide
bombers into their explosive vests to maximize lethal effects and to
inflict unimaginable pain and suffering on innocent Jewish bodies.
These maliciously transformed objects are propelled with the force of
bullets, penetrating skin, flesh and bone with a furious indifference
to civilized human behavior.</TE>
<TE>   The nails fly head first, presenting themselves in a strangely
surreal yet orderly arrangement within the victims' bodies. Many are
embedded shallowly. Others burrow their way in more deeply and lodge
under the skin, where the examining physician can actually touch and
feel their alien presence. Some take hours of meticulous exploration
to remove. Still others violate the body deeper, perforating and
lacerating vital organs. CT scans of these victims' heads show blood,
air, metal and bone fragments displacing normal brain tissue.</TE>
<TE>   The "lucky" patient who survives the initial explosive insult may
often require extensive surgery to repair damaged organs. Others may
sustain fractures, burns, amputations, vascular injuries, paralysis,
blindness or brain damage. A collapsed lung or perforated
colon--ordinarily considered a major injury--is taken as a blessing
for such victims of terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Although some of the victims recover physically and return to a
"normal" life, many more require a lifetime of rehabilitation. Some
are impaired permanently.</TE>
<TE>   And all suffer serious psychological harm that needs to be
treated. Post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety
affect not only the victims of the attack but all of Israeli society.
Anecdotal reports have indicated a dramatic rise in the use of
prescription antidepressants and sedatives.</TE>
<TE>   How could it be otherwise, in a society living under constant
attack by those who cry out, "When the martyr dies a martyr's death,
he attains the height of bliss ... "?</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian "martyr's" unheroic weapon has now literally and
figuratively penetrated the hearts and souls as well as the bodies of
an entire nation.</TE>
<TE>   Too often, unfortunately, television and print media are unable or
unwilling to transmit the full human measure of such penetration to
viewers and readers.</TE>
<TE>   The result is that too few people around the world are able to
understand the true horror of the Palestinian suicide bomber. For
them, Israeli "wounded" are little more than an anesthetized
statistic, an abstract list of numbers that elicits barely a nodding
sigh of concern.</TE>
<TE>   For the Palestinian suicide bomber, violence and the sacred are
intertwined. This homicidal terrorist believes unreservedly that
there can be no greater glory for a Muslim than inflicting
measureless pain upon all Jewish bodies.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no Israeli civilians," says Adel Sadeq, chairman of the
Arab Psychiatric Assn. "They are all plunderers." There is no longer
any time for the civilized world to transform this murderously
indiscriminate belief. After all, even a secular Arab psychiatrist,
Sadeq, says openly and proudly that "the only real means of dealing
with Israel is those who blow themselves up."</TE>

<HD>Hiding Behind a Veil of Executive Privilege?</HD>
<DH>We're owed an explanation of what the White House knew
leading up to 9/11.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT SCHEER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A full-scale investigation is in order as to why this nation was so
poorly prepared to fend off an air piracy attack by a terrorist group
that had already killed many Americans and attempted air hijackings
and yet had total access to our flight schools.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, all clues so far point to a depressingly likely
conclusion: Until Sept. 11, the Bush administration was simply too
distracted and/or incompetent to maintain the American pressure on
Osama bin Laden begun in 1998 under President Clinton with the
missile attacks on reported Al Qaeda sites in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   As Newsweek reports this week, Clinton National Security Advisor
Samuel R. "Sandy" Berger was "totally preoccupied" with the prospect
of a domestic terror attack. He warned his replacement, Condoleezza
Rice: "You will be spending more time on this issue than on any
other."</LD>
<TE>   Problem was, she didn't. Despite many warnings like Berger's,
including the recently revealed Central Intelligence Agency briefings
last summer, the new administration treated the so-called war on
drugs as more important than terrorism, and on that basis even made
overtures to the Taliban leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Four days before the ominous CIA briefing on Aug. 6 that warned
President Bush of the possibility of Al Qaeda hijackings, Christina
B. Rocca, assistant secretary of State for South Asia, was sipping
tea in Islamabad with the Taliban's ambassador to Pakistan, Abdul
Salam Zaeef. She offered a mixed message that aptly characterized the
administration's confused priorities.</TE>
<TE>   Treating the Taliban and Al Qaeda as if they were distinct
entities, Rocca--in what now seems unbelievable naivete--asked the
Taliban to extradite Bin Laden. Afterward, Zaeef said, "We gave Rocca
our complete assurance that our soil will not be used against America
and that Afghan soil will not be used for any terrorist activity." He
called the meeting "very successful," adding, "The atmosphere was
very cordial."</TE>
<TE>   He had reason to be pleased. As Associated Press reported at the
time: "In recognition of the Taliban's elimination of opium [in
Afghanistan], the raw material used to make heroin, the Bush
administration is giving $1.5million to the United Nations Drug
Control Program to finance crop substitution, Rocca said."</TE>
<TE>   Poppies, not terrorists, had been eliminated in Afghanistan. Five
weeks later, terrorists smashed three planes into the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   While the State Department was playing footsie with the Taliban,
Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft's Justice Department also was downshifting
anti-terrorism efforts to transfer focus to violent crime and drugs,
reports Newsweek.</TE>
<TE>   At the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld blocked an
attempt to move $800million from his pet missile defense program into
counter-terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The administration simply was not focused on terrorism until it
was too late. There was a blizzard of warnings leading up to Sept. 11
that was ignored. It's a poor excuse for Rice to complain that the
CIA warning was "thin." Real-time coordination of intelligence
information on such a high-level problem is the responsibility of the
national security advisor.</TE>
<TE>   If Rice felt the dire CIA warning in August was incomplete, she
should have demanded that the FBI and other intelligence agencies
immediately brief her and the president on their full knowledge of
the situation. Nor did the administration inform the country of this
lapse in security until it leaked to the media eight months later.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, administration spokesmen have continuously misled the
public from the first days after the Sept. 11 tragedy with the claim
that the president had no advance warning.</TE>
<TE>   We do not yet know the full extent of those warnings, and Vice
President Dick Cheney is once again circling the wagons of executive
privilege around the essential data.</TE>
<TE>   The vice president insists that it would jeopardize national
security for Congress to have access to the August CIA briefing.</TE>
<TE>   This follows the dangerous pattern this administration has
consistently pursued of denying the public and its elected
representatives potentially embarrassing information, such as notes
from meetings with Enron officials before that company's spectacular
implosion.</TE>
<TE>   We already know enough about the intelligence failures before that
grim September morning to raise strong suspicions that executive
privilege is now being invoked to conceal enormous incompetence on
the part of the executive branch.</TE>
<TE>   It is painful, in light of the thousands of people slain in New
York, Washington and Pennsylvania as well as later in Afghanistan in
retaliation, to look back at how our security was so threatened. But
as horrifying as the facts may turn out to be, we as a nation have
long believed that it is the truth--full, complex and
unsanitized--that shall make us free. We should continue to act
accordingly.</TE>

<HD>Accent Is on Politics in Ooh-La-La Land</HD>
<DH>Simon's no Le Pen, but the governor's race could echo
French elections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL WHALEN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California has an appetite for France's high fashion and haute
cuisine. But its politics too? Mais oui.</LD>
<LD>   Unless there's a plot twist, our governor's race could repeat this
month's presidential vote in France. There, the lackluster choices
were an unpopular, scandal-plagued head of state and a conservative
upstart demonized as being out of touch with mainstream voters. Sound
familiar? April in Paris could be little different from November in
L.A.</LD>
<LD>   Not that we have the same flawed personalities here. Gov. Gray
Davis has his dubious ties to donors, but he's not in the same league
as French President Jacques Chirac, accused of taking kickbacks as
mayor of Paris and mocked on French television as "Super Liar," a
puppet figure with a briefcase stuffed with stolen bank notes.
Neither is Republican challenger Bill Simon Jr. in the same universe
as Jean-Marie Le Pen, the leader of France's ultraright National
Front. Simon is mild-mannered and speaks inclusively; Le Pen is a
xenophobe who called the Nazi Holocaust "a detail of history."</LD>
<TE>   What we do share with the French isn't leaders, it's leading
indicators. Like Chirac, Davis is not a popular leader. If he's
smart--and he is--he will notice that Chirac captured 82% of the
French vote by convincing folks that Le Pen was un homme horrible.</TE>
<TE>   What's stopping Davis from spending tens of millions of dollars in
attack ads this fall to do the same: tarring Simon as an extremist
too repugnant for Californians' tastes?</TE>
<TE>   Which raises this question: What is Simon doing to prevent what
seems so inevitable? We know he's not standing by idly. The candidate
is working the back roads of the Republican circuit. He shows up in
the middle of negative stories about the Davis administration like a
pop-up ad on an Internet site. But is that progress? Do Californians
who didn't vote for him in March know more about Bill Simon--his
persona, his policies and his passions--than they did before he
pulled off the upset in the Republican primary?</TE>
<TE>   France's presidential election lasted two weeks. Simon has the
luxury of 24 more weeks to avoid the wrong side of a landslide. But
first he has to develop a comfort zone with centrist Californians and
convince them he is not a far-right enfant terrible. That comfort
zone is the key to unseating the incumbent. It's foolish for
Republicans to assume that the Davis administration's incompetence
alone will vault Simon into office.</TE>
<TE>   Last Friday's appearance by the two candidates at the California
Society of Newspaper Editors showed why. Simon criticized Davis for
bringing a "pay to play" mentality to state government. Davis said
his opponent was the "kettle calling the pot black" in that a Simon
family firm had been fined and censured for making contributions in
exchange for political favors. And so it will go until November:
point, counterpoint and an ugly draw that succeeds only in turning
off voters.</TE>
<TE>   Simon faces a unique opportunity in the weeks and months ahead.
Davis is vulnerable, a rarity for incumbent California governors. As
a political novice, Simon can honestly market himself as a breath of
fresh air in Sacramento. Therein lies this election's paradox: so
much time until November, but so little time remaining for Simon to
start raising his profile and offering himself in a positive light
before he finds himself trapped on the defensive.</TE>
<TE>   And what happens if Simon doesn't establish his own persona and
lets Davis get away with the campaign equivalent of identity theft?
The concession speech will go something like this: "Lies have been
told about us, lies have been told about me, and I have been made
into a figure of caricature."</TE>
<TE>   Those were Le Pen's words on the night he lost. Deja vu, indeed.</TE>

<LD>It's true, the world has a surfeit of conflict, more than even a
Sunday newspaper can hold. Humans say they don't like conflict. Their
choice of movies, books, TV shows, sports, gossip and weapons and a
fair amount of interpersonal behavior would, however, indicate some
conflict over conflict. Fact is, newspaper sales and TV ratings tend
not to go up when bombs fail to fall, athletes aren't arrested,
public officials lead exemplary lives and happy, loyal celebrities
pursue placid careers, making timely mortgage payments. Face it, a
movie series called "Star Peace" would not be greenlighted.</LD>
<LD>   Some people feel so strongly about reducing conflict, they'll pop
anyone who disagrees. Still, our society's professed goal is to
reduce conflict. To that end, Tom and Ruth Ann Hornaday, who are
presumably happily married, have just written a $1-million check to
fund the Center for the Development of Peace and Well-Being
(CeDePWeB).</LD>
<LD>   That's a great California name. Can you too feel the good
vibrations? In fact, this center will be in California. In Berkeley,
as a matter of fact, where the United Nations chose not to locate.
The Hornadays graduated from Berkeley in the placid '60s. Peace,
brother. They've made a good deal of harmonious money developing
things in Arizona and would like to promote peace elsewhere.</LD>
<TE>   Those are good ideas. The Bay Area can always use some peace. And
a million bucks can buy a lot of academic well-being. The center will
draw on many disciplines to examine how conflicts are resolved or
avoided and how friendships develop across ethnic and racial
borders--in general, to research how families, peers and social
institutions develop peace and well-being. Do you hear guitars?</TE>
<TE>   It would be like, you know, a really cool thing to have less
conflict in the world. Unless, of course, you make munitions or arms
deals. But then you can found your own Center for Conflict
Instigation and Inflammation (CCII). Berkeley is as good a place as
any to start either one.</TE>
<TE>   We're feeling terribly centered about this new idea. But one
warning, sent out gently to brothers and sisters of good faith in the
interests of peace and well-being: You can bet your plowshares forged
from swords that some conflicted observers who aren't as mellow as
the Hornadays will be watching for faculty members to pursue their
individual versions of peace into vicious territorial conflicts over
at the new Center for the Development of Peace and Well-Being. Let
the humming begin.</TE>

<HD>Bush Is Out of Step on Cuba</HD>
<DH>The president's demands are backward-looking. The fastest
way to get rid of Castro's dictatorship is to ease restrictions on
travel and trade.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Miami audience Monday gave President Bush's fiery speech on Cuba
ovation after ovation. But television viewers could not help but
focus on the repetitive, gaping yawns of the children behind the
president's lecturn.</LD>
<LD>   There was symbolism in those young people's boredom. These days,
young Cubans ponder the easiest way to swap digitized Los Van Van
timba tracks with their American cousins. But Bush sounded like a
scratched 45, stuck replaying tired '60s mambo.</LD>
<LD>   In his speech to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the first
Cuban republic, the president said he would work with Congress to
ease the ban on trade and travel between the two countries--but only
after opposition parties in Cuba had "the freedom to organize,
assemble and speak, with equal access to all airwaves."</LD>
<TE>   Bush also demanded the release of all political prisoners and that
human rights organizations be allowed to visit Cuba to ensure free
parliamentary elections in 2003. If Richard Nixon had applied the
same criteria to China in 1972, after the U.S. first decided to
engage in Ping-Pong diplomacy with the communist regime, that nation
probably would have remained cloistered and far more impervious to
democratic change.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, the solid arguments of the 20 Democrats and 20
Republicans who constitute Congress' Cuba Working Group have failed
to show the president the pragmatic advantages of looking ahead
instead of back. Nor did his speech reflect the thrust of current
opinion. Sixty-three percent of Americans think people should be able
to travel freely to Cuba, according to a May 16 Fox News Poll. Human
Rights Watch contends that lifting the trade embargo now would help
to ease Castro's grip on Cubans. And even some of that nation's
leading dissidents, including Vladimiro Roca and Elizardo Sanchez,
who are struggling to wrestle new freedoms from Castro, fear that
Bush's continued support of trade sanctions could hurt their efforts
to force a democratic opening.</TE>
<TE>   That opening, of course, is already far bigger than Bush cares to
officially recognize. Despite supposedly tight limits, for instance,
Cuban Americans send more than $700 million back to the island each
year. And thousands of Americans already travel to the nation
annually, ignoring restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's speech did not go astray in blasting Castro as a
tyrant--which he is--but rather in painting him as the strongman he
was when he took power 43 years ago. In truth, his power is slipping,
and the fastest way to accelerate the erosion is to give Americans
free reign to travel to Cuba to freely sell Cubans their products and
ideas.</TE>

<LD>On Sunday, East Timor was a territory ruled by Portuguese colonists
for four centuries and Indonesia for nearly 25 years. On Monday, it
was an independent nation, one of the poorest in the world but also a
concrete example of the power of the United Nations to do good.</LD>
<LD>   The new president, Jose Alexandre Gusmao, won a landslide election
in April in balloting that was an important part of the
transformation of the eastern half of Timor island from centuries of
dependency to a free, democratic nation. Gusmao deserves credit for
reaching out to Indonesia to heal the wounds caused by brutal
Indonesian repression. He visited Jakarta to invite Indonesian
President Megawati Sukarnoputri to the independence celebrations, and
she accepted. Some members of the Indonesian Parliament pressured her
to boycott the ceremonies, contending that her presence would support
a territory the legislators insisted is still an integral part of
Indonesia. Megawati was right to spurn that advice. The thousands of
East Timorese gathered for the celebrations cheered her as Gusmao
clasped her hand.</LD>
<LD>   Even the economic picture is looking up a bit. Energy companies
have agreed to seek and develop oil and gas supplies in the Timor
Sea.</LD>
<TE>   Three years ago, Indonesian soldiers and their pawns in local
militias killed an estimated 1,000 people and burned hundreds of
homes after East Timorese voted for independence. Violence ended soon
after the arrival of U.N. peacekeepers; building a civil society has
taken longer. International experts helped develop a police force and
staffed government ministries, showing East Timorese how to handle
their own affairs.</TE>
<TE>   East Timor is not a template for Afghanistan, but it does offer
lessons in building a nation. Security is vital; armed enemies must
be routed and factionalism among the victors ended. Political
institutions must allow for economic development.</TE>
<TE>   It is also encouraging that Indonesia finally has begun trials of
army officers accused of human rights abuses in East Timor. The
trials have been delayed too long, and the chances of gaining
convictions in a land where the military has always played a major
role are questionable. The proceedings at least recognize demands for
accountability. East Timor convicted 10 former militia members for
their roles in the violence, but most remain at large in West Timor.
Gusmao has urged reconciliation rather than revenge and helped form a
South Africa-style commission on truth and reconciliation.</TE>
<TE>   Gusmao, who led guerrillas fighting for independence and was
jailed for seven years, will have much less power as president than
the country's prime minister. But his presence in government is an
important symbol of East Timor's ascent to independence.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Jo-Ann Mort's discomfiture over the ulterior motives behind the
Christian right's support for Israel (Opinion, May 19) is shared by
many Jews whose outlook can be considered liberal. Nevertheless,
while those of us on the Jewish left have felt free to criticize
Israel's settlement policies and second-class treatment of Israeli
Arabs--as have many Israeli Jews--one has to wonder why mainstream
Christians have largely kept silent in the face of repeated suicide
murders and the corruption, ineptitude and autocratic style of Yasser
Arafat's leadership.</LD>
<LD>   After all, the democratically elected Ariel Sharon and his Likud
Party would not be in power today had Arafat possessed the vision to
choose the path of peace, prosperity and political reform presented
to him in 2000 by President Clinton and Ehud Barak.</LD>

<TE>   An unholy alliance? No, a sick alliance on the part of any Jew who
joins it. A Christian right that expects all Jews to convert to
Christianity, or that supports the notion that all Jews must be in
Israel in order for Jesus to come again, represents profound, bizarre
anti-Semitism. The Anti-Defamation League's support of Ralph Reed is
disgraceful. Mort says the Christian Broadcasting Network's view of
Israel may make Jews "uncomfortable"? It should make them furious,
and they should reject the support of all such bigots.</TE>

<LD>"Cheney Says Bush Handled Hijack Warning Correctly," May 20: If a
doctor were presented with nonspecific information about the
treatment of one of his patients, after his assistants had decided it
was important enough to pass along to him, and then rode around his
ranch shooting rabbits and did not request more information or alert
his patient, and then the patient died, that doctor would be sued for
malpractice and personal negligence. If that doctor then decided to
alert all his patients to new nonspecific dangers, should that
absolve him of his first error? Are we to hold our president to any
lower standards?</LD>
<LD>   As Harry Truman said, "The buck stops here." President Bush's
defensiveness and Vice President Dick Cheney's threat toward the
Democrats sound like they would like to pass the buck.</LD>

<TE>   Predicting an imminent terrorist act closely resembles the
challenge of reliably predicting major earthquakes. A major
earthquake on the San Andreas Fault could easily produce 100 times
the number of casualties produced by the World Trade Center attack.
But given the enormous economic consequences, what level of certainty
is needed to justify the issuance of a public warning to evacuate
L.A.?</TE>
<TE>   We already know the disastrous economic impact of Sept. 11 on the
airline industry resulting from the grounding of all aircraft in the
immediate aftermath and the sharp drop-off in the number of air
passengers during the months that followed. Clearly, the level of
reliability and specificity of intelligence estimates relating to new
hijacking attempts would also have to be very high to justify
grounding the commercial air fleet or issuing a public warning to
avoid air travel.</TE>
<TE>   Terrorists already realize they can wreak more economic havoc on
this country by planting false intelligence leads than they can by
actually carrying out more terrorist acts. That makes the problem of
assessing intelligence information even more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Emory</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is absurd to think that Bush would not have done everything in
his power to avoid the Sept. 11 tragedy had the government been able
to "connect the dots" among the fragmented clues. Unfortunately, such
hypothetical action is not the test of leadership.</TE>
<TE>   During the 2000 campaign we were assured that intellect was not a
critical quality for a president. A good staff could always
compensate for a president who lacked intellectual curiosity.
However, it is at the very top of an organization where all the
diverse pieces of information come together. Although we cannot
recreate history, it seems plausible that a keener, more inquisitive
mind might have asked the questions that would have helped avoid
Sept. 11.</TE>

<HD>AP Courses Have Lost Some Meaning</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "When Testing Trumps Learning," by Deborah Stipek, Commentary, May
16: Advanced Placement courses no longer hold the meaning they were
intended to hold. As a senior at Cerritos High School, I have taken
four AP courses and five honors courses in my four years in high
school, and I must admit that the reason for taking so many rigorous
courses is to help myself gain admission into the college of my
choice.</LD>
<LD>   Three of my four AP courses were in European history, U.S. history
and U.S. government and politics, and I have no particular interest
in history or in politics. However, today, in order to gain admission
into an "exceptional" university, it is necessary to take these AP
courses. From my own experience, I took each course not to learn
something because I enjoy the subject, but to learn it and then pass
the AP exam, hoping to gain college credit.</LD>
<LD>   In the AP courses I have been in, the courses are structured for
the student to pass the tests; they're fairly time-consuming,
stressful and cause sleepless nights. Sometimes, it feels as if one
would learn more and have more fun in a regular college-prep class.
In some cases, even teachers are absorbed into the AP frenzy that
goes on; in order to have a high pass rate, some teachers suggest to
students not to even bother signing up for the exam.</LD>
<TE>   The AP system has been misused greatly, it has lost its original
purpose and, as we go into the future, more and more AP courses are
going to be available in numerous high schools. I believe that the
only way for AP courses to regain their true use is if universities
end the expectation of students taking AP courses. Once this ends, AP
classes will truly be devoted to helping students gain more knowledge
in the subject of their interest instead of helping students get into
college.</TE>
<TE>   Jane Lee</TE>
<TE>   Cerritos</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As a former AP U.S. history teacher, I have to agree with Stipek's
comments that AP courses are designed for one purpose--to help
students pass the test. Unfortunately, I have also found that my
students' purpose for taking AP U.S. history is to get the subject
"out of the way" in college, for more "important" subjects like
science and business.</TE>
<TE>   The disheartening results are evident throughout our society,
where the lack of appreciation and understanding of our past results
in an unclear vision of our future.</TE>

<LD>Re "Gee, Is There a Choice Between Profits and Patriotism?" by
Arianna Huffington, Commentary, May 15: We are made aware of the
massive corruption in other societies that robs the average citizen.
I see these "unpatriotic" American companies moving to offshore
islands to avoid paying their fair share of taxes as nothing more
than legalized corruption.</LD>
<LD>   Cheating us citizens of $70 billion in taxes is another example of
corporate welfare; at the same time, corporations receive government
contracts and pay no taxes on those profits. Corruption by any other
name smells as bad. Where is Congress, which should be closing this
loophole?</LD>

<HD>Tax Gas Guzzlers to Balance the Budget</HD>

<LD>Hooray for the governor in biting the bullet and coming up with a
truly responsible budget plan in an election year (May 15). Wouldn't
it be nice if, in addition to increased taxes on cigarettes, we'd
have increased taxes on gas guzzlers and increased taxes (via tolls)
for folks who do not carpool?</LD>
<LD>   We have an opportunity to decrease air pollution and our
dependence on foreign oil, our biggest national security threat, by
using the tax system to help change the state's big-car,
one-passenger driving culture.</LD>

<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis increases taxes on the poor and cuts programs for
the poor. Isn't this what the Democrats accuse Republicans of doing
every election? The Republicans will spend your Social Security! The
Republicans give the rich tax breaks! The Republicans don't care
about the homeless and poor!</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, this upcoming election will once again be
determined by the issue of abortion. Therefore Davis will win. So now
the poor and middle-income people of California will be taxed so much
that the thought of having children will be the best birth control,
and we won't need abortion anyway. It is a shame that both parties
have ignored the real problem that caused California's huge tax
deficit--illegal immigration.</TE>

<TE>   Being the savvy politician that he is, I am sure that the last
thing Davis wanted to do was issue a budget such as the one he
unveiled last week. However, Davis is a realist and he knows what
needs to be done, good or bad. The fact that he chose not to
camouflage it with smoke and mirrors, as many politicians would do,
is very admirable.</TE>
<TE>   All those who have accused him of being a smooth-talking liar may
now be quiet, along with those who blamed him for the energy crisis
and the high price of gas. Davis may not be perfect, but he is good
for California.</TE>

<TE>   Davis is raising taxes to deal with a $23.6-billion deficit just
five months after he said in his Jan. 8 State of the State address
that the deficit was $12 billion and that he wouldn't "advocate"
raising taxes to fix the problem. We can all rest easy knowing Davis
is in charge.</TE>

<LD>Re "Auto, Bike, Bus Race to the Office," May 17: It was with interest
that I read about the La Crescenta-to-downtown-L.A. race. Two years
ago, at age 55, I got my motorcycle license and have commuted to
downtown L.A. from Venice every day. I have two motorcycles, one new
and one used, both of which get better than 40 mpg, and my commute at
any time is less than 30 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   Plus, as any motorcyclist knows, riding a motorcycle is fun! I
have enough room in two saddlebags for two large grocery bags, dry
cleaning, etc.--for errand-running. Why is the motorcycle never
included as a viable form of transportation in any discussion about
alternatives to driving a car?</LD>

<LD>The city secession name-game fiasco is not unlike renaming your
mother "the Family Biological Incubator." It is safe to wager that it
does not matter what name is chosen upon secession, the area will
continue to be called "the Valley," just as Los Angeles is referred
to as "over the hill," not as L.A.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, it is probable that Los Angeles will find "Over the Hill"
a more apropos name when Valley revenue, despite the alimony, is no
longer flowing unabated into its coffers. The solution? KISS (Keep It
Simple, Secessionists). "The Valley" works just fine.</LD>

<HD>Andersen Attorney Foresaw SEC Probe</HD>
<DH>Courts: Notes indicate it was possible firm would be found
in violation of a settlement concerning botched audits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Arthur Andersen staff attorney Nancy Temple concluded in early
October that Enron Corp.'s collapse made it "highly probable" federal
regulators would investigate, raising the threat of severe penalties
for her firm, according to notes presented by federal prosecutors
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   As the trial entered its third week, prosecutors also showed a
videotape of an Oct. 10 employee meeting at the accounting firm's
Houston office in which partner Michael Odom said destroying
documents can prevent "embarrassing" records from falling into the
wrong hands if the firm is sued.</LD>
<LD>   "If it's destroyed in the course of normal policy, and litigation
is filed the next day, that's great," Odom said on the tape.</LD>
<TE>   Andersen is fighting a federal obstruction of justice charge for
destroying documents related to its audit work for Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors introduced notes taken by Temple during an Oct. 9
conference call among the firm's senior officials. In addition to
citing the likelihood of a Securities and Exchange Commission
inquiry, the notes indicate that Temple believed it was "possible"
that regulators might find Andersen in violation of a settlement it
had reached with the agency after botched audits of another client,
Waste Management Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The call took place three days before Temple sent an e-mail to a
partner in Andersen's Houston office asking his team to comply with
the firm's document retention policy, which required the destruction
of drafts, e-mail and other records deemed unnecessary.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors presented Temple's notes and reams of internal
correspondence showing rising anxiety inside the accounting firm as
revelations of Enron's related-party transactions exploded into
public view.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors unveiled the paper trail as part of a strategy to
persuade the jury that top executives were growing wary of regulatory
scrutiny and took an active role in planning the firm's response to
the Enron meltdown.</TE>
<TE>   Temple has invoked her right not to incriminate herself and
declined to testify in the case.</TE>
<TE>   The notes from the Oct. 9 call could be particularly damaging to
Andersen if jurors view them the way prosecutors do.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department team contends that Andersen shredded
Enron-related documents because the firm, stung by SEC sanctions
imposed in the wake of the Waste Management case, feared additional
penalties.</TE>
<TE>   But Andersen already has established the basis for a defense by
eliciting testimony designed to undermine the image of a firm
desperately shredding documents on orders from the top.</TE>
<TE>   David Duncan, formerly the lead partner handling Enron audits and
the prosecution's star witness, told jurors last week that he wasn't
thinking about the Waste Management settlement when he ordered
employees Oct. 23 to comply with the firm's document-retention
policy.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan also testified that, after attending the Oct. 10 videotaped
meeting with Odom, he didn't leave thinking he should destroy
Enron-related files.</TE>
<TE>   On the videotape, Odom indicates that the firm's policy allows for
the destruction of records until the firm is sued.</TE>
<TE>   Odom has not been called to testify, and it is not clear whether
he will be. An Andersen spokesman said it is routine for the firm to
record such presentations, which are shared with other offices and
sometimes retained for reference.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan said he had received an e-mail Oct. 12 from Odom, forwarded
from Temple, that asked his team to comply with the policy.
Prosecutors introduced records Monday showing that, about 20 minutes
after sending the e-mail to Odom, Temple created a record of a legal
claim arising from Enron's slide.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege that Temple's e-mail was intended as a coded
signal telling Andersen employees to start shredding Enron files. But
Duncan said he initially didn't act on the e-mail, and added that he
launched the office shredding effort only after listening in on an
analyst conference call 11 days later in which Enron came under heavy
criticism.</TE>
<TE>   Temple's notes have been one of the more controversial pieces of
evidence introduced by the government.</TE>
<TE>   Rusty Hardin, Andersen's attorney, had told U.S. District Judge
Melinda Harmon that she was committing a "reversible error" by
allowing prosecutors to discuss the notes and to pose questions about
them to another Andersen executive earlier in the trial.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Assistant U.S. Atty. Samuel Buell asked an FBI agent on
the witness stand to read Temple's handwriting, but made little
attempt to interpret the notes for the jury.</TE>
<TE>   The notes, which covered a series of conference calls among senior
Andersen executives mainly during October, describe the issues top
managers were grappling with as Enron's finances collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   In one set of notes from Oct. 1, Temple jotted: "What documents
should we keep? Historically keep everything."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Bauer, another Andersen executive who participated in some
of the calls, Monday invoked his right against self-incrimination.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>JNI Corp., which makes equipment for data and storage networks, said
it discovered it had overstated fourth-quarter sales by 4% and that
its board had fired Chief Executive Neal Waddington as a result.</LD>
<LD>   The news sent JNI shares down to as low as $4.70 in after-hours
trading. The shares had closed off 27 cents at $5.37 on Nasdaq before
the announcement.</LD>
<LD>   The San Diego-based company said its fourth-quarter revenue was
overstated by about $501,000 because of a single order, which was
recognized as revenue in violation of JNI's policy of not booking
sales in which the customer had been granted a right of return.</LD>
<TE>   Waddington granted that concession in a side agreement to the sale
that was not disclosed to financial personnel within the company or
auditors, JNI said.</TE>
<TE>   The company did not identify the customer involved in the
transaction.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of a review by the company's audit committee, JNI
restated its revenue for the fourth quarter to $13 million from the
initially reported $13.5 million, and restated its loss per share to
16 cents from the 15-cent loss reported earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it named John Stiska, a director and chairman of
venture lending fund Commercial Bridge Capital, as interim CEO.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Walt Disney Co.'s California theme parks will not offer any
discounted admissions this summer because attendance has been picking
up, a spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   During last year's summer travel season, Disney's then-newly
opened California Adventure offered big discounts at the height of
summer vacation to offset disappointing attendance in the park's
opening months.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, both California Adventure and Disneyland have offered
frequent discounts in a bid to attract budget-conscious and
travel-averse customers during the economic slowdown and post-Sept.
11 travel crisis.</LD>
<TE>   Disneyland and California Adventure are now offering Southern
California adults admission at the children's price, but that will
end June 19, said spokesman John McClintock.</TE>
<TE>   "There won't be any other promotions of that nature during the
summer months," he said.</TE>

<HD>Westwood Complex Meets Opposition</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Village activists are trying to scale down
proposed $100-million apartment and retail project.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRAD BERTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Plans for a $100-million apartment and retail complex in Westwood are
drawing fire as--once again--a savvy developer tries to push limits
on new construction while equally sophisticated neighborhood
activists battle to scale down his project.</LD>
<LD>   For decades, Westwood was a busy retail area and a hot spot for
movie premieres. But in the late 1980s, a spate of violence scared
off moviegoers and the recession reined in development. Now areas of
the village are showing solid signs of life after more than a decade
of relative sluggishness. Grocers, druggists and specialty markets
are opening in new and renovated buildings.</LD>
<LD>   Development in Westwood has long been a rough sport, unsuited for
the impatient or the undercapitalized. Large projects have been
delayed for years in legal and political struggles, and some
developers have been driven off without breaking ground. At least two
builders have given up on high-profile proposals for a site on
Glendon Avenue that a Beverly Hills developer is trying to improve.</LD>
<TE>   The 4.25-acre property between bustling Wilshire Boulevard and
Westwood Village's retail core is home to aging commercial buildings,
parking lots and Glendon Manor, an apartment building dating to the
early days of the village. Developer Casden Glendon, led by veteran
builder Alan Casden, proposes to build 350 luxury apartments atop
ground-floor stores and restaurants and a three-level subterranean
garage.</TE>
<TE>   Palazzo Westwood, as it would be known, would consist of two
five-story buildings flanking Glendon Avenue, south of Weyburn Avenue
and west of Tiverton Avenue. The street would be narrowed and the
sidewalk widened to accommodate outdoor cafes and make the block more
attractive to pedestrians.</TE>
<TE>   The project's potential effect on traffic--a common point of
conflict for new developments--isn't the key concern for neighborhood
groups that have contested previous plans for the site.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, the lines have been drawn over other issues that have
dogged past proposals--overall density of the development, height and
perhaps most notably, parking.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents say the project doesn't comply with the Westwood Village
Specific Plan and will exacerbate the village's shortage of parking
spaces--Palazzo's 1,450-stall garage public notwithstanding.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem isn't that Westwood doesn't have enough apartments,"
said veteran Westwood activist and business consultant Steve Sann.
"It's that there's not enough parking. Westwood merchants will tell
you they don't want to lose any on-street parking," added Sann, who
opposes Casden's plan to eliminate such parking for wider sidewalks.</TE>
<TE>   At least one merchant has a different opinion. Fernand Page, owner
of the 25-year-old Moustache Cafe on Glendon, said his business would
benefit from Palazzo's public parking--not to mention all those
prosperous apartment dwellers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very open to this plan," Page said. "I don't understand why
people would oppose something that will boost business here."</TE>
<TE>   Casden spokesman Howard Katz said Palazzo includes more parking
than is required under the specific plan, and that narrowing Glendon
Avenue to create exceptionally wide sidewalks with alfresco dining
will enhance Westwood's pedestrian atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   Responses to the Palazzo's draft environmental impact report
suggest that the city approval process will focus on parking and
other issues stemming from traditional conflicts between builders and
neighborhood groups.</TE>
<TE>   Developers generally want to maximize density--more developed
space earns more rental revenue and enhances the property's resale
value. Neighbors often want to restrict density to reduce the
potential effect of development on their quality of life.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Parking Debate Might Clarify City's Concept</TE>
<TE>   Debate over the parking requirements for Palazzo may help clarify
the city's position on a land-conserving design concept gaining favor
in many large cities: the mix of residential and commercial uses,
said Los Angeles planning consultant Larry Kosmont.</TE>
<TE>   While the city has in recent years adopted general guidelines that
encourage mixed-use development in some locations, the Westwood
Village Specific Plan doesn't define mixed-use as a distinct land-use
category.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a defining moment for the mixed-use concept here--not to
mention for Westwood Village," said Kosmont, whose firm provided
tax-analysis consulting for developer Ira Smedra, who failed to earn
support for a theater and retail complex at the Palazzo site.</TE>
<TE>   Casden Glendon is affiliated with Casden Properties of Beverly
Hills. In connection with its recent $822-million purchase of Casden
Properties' vast apartment portfolio, nationwide apartment
owner-manager Apartment Investment &amp; Management Co. of Denver has
agreed to help fund Palazzo's development and has an option to buy it
upon completion.</TE>
<TE>   The developers seek amendments to the Westwood Village specific
plan, a land-use planning tool. Among the requested changes is an
amendment to allow the builders to construct Palazzo as a single
development, rather than being subject to the specific plan's
block-by-block zoning designations.</TE>
<TE>   The specific plan puts the property's two parcels--on either side
of Glendon--under different land-use and density designations.</TE>
<TE>   But in comments filed with the city Planning Department about the
draft EIR, Westwood activists urge officials to make Casden stick to
the specific plan--a complex blueprint adopted by the city in 1989
after intense debate.</TE>
<TE>   Terry Tagnazian, a Westwood attorney, property and business owner
who helped establish a group called Save Westwood Village, offers
several objections to the Palazzo proposal:</TE>
<TE>   The project is substantially larger than would be allowed under a
strict interpretation of the specific plan. Its underground parking
doesn't come close to compensating for the loss of on-street and
surface-lot stalls. And unlike a hotel-centered proposal floated for
the site in the 1980s, the Palazzo would entail demolition of the
1920s-vintage Glendon Manor apartment building.</TE>
<TE>   The project's fate may not be decided for months. Westside City
Councilman Jack Weiss said he plans to evaluate responses to the
draft EIR before taking a position on the Casden Glendon proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Weiss, who campaigned against the previous retail and cinema plan
for the site proposed by developer Smedra, said the primary concern
of many nearby residents is to improve the property's "blighted
condition." The Palazzo would replace old and mostly unused
commercial, apartment and theater buildings.</TE>
<TE>   "People are open to a proposal that will not meaningfully affect
traffic," Weiss said, "[especially] something that will help beautify
Westwood."</TE>
<TE>   The Casden group wants to replace commercial space allowed by the
specific plan on Glendon with additional apartments in a Classical
Spanish Revival motif designed by Santa Monica architects Van Tilburg
Banvard &amp; Soderbergh.</TE>
<TE>   By Casden's calculations, the specific plan allows the property
owners to build 213 residential units and 230,000 square feet of
commercial space. The developer's proposal calls for half that amount
of retail space--all fronting Glendon--topped with 350 apartments.</TE>
<TE>   Some Westwood activists dispute Casden's density calculations and
take exception to other details and proposed amendments in the draft
EIR. Opponents have requested that the Planning Department "correct
and recirculate" the study.</TE>
<TE>   Katz characterized the opposition as "redundant and orchestrated"
and not representative of the broader community's impression of the
Palazzo proposal.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Height Limits an Issue for Activist Groups</TE>
<TE>   Activist Sann countered that the Save Westwood Village group is
not anti-development and includes active area real estate
professionals among its ranks.</TE>
<TE>   The specific plan, Sann said, includes hard-won compromises over
height limits, unit counts and other details. "So what's galling to
the community is to see Casden come in and treat the plan like it's
the floor [for density calculations]."</TE>
<TE>   Casden Glendon's Katz said the requested amendments are reasonable
and make the project more viable while retaining the specific plan's
"integrity and spirit."</TE>
<TE>   Neighborhood groups including Friends of Westwood say the proposed
buildings would rise more than 80 feet from street level--rather than
the 55 feet as calculated by Casden in the draft EIR.</TE>
<TE>   Katz said the Palazzo Westwood design includes architectural
detailing above the top-floor ceilings--which he said would be 55
feet above the street. "We'd have to remove that jewelry" if
measurements are taken from the highest point of the structure, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   That or just shorten the building by a floor or two, opponents
counter.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the matter of 42-unit Glendon Manor. Some local
activists want the developers to incorporate the nearly 75-year-old
apartment building--which holds state historic-landmark
eligibility--into the Palazzo project rather than demolish it.</TE>
<TE>   But Katz said activists took the Glendon Manor preservation cause
to Sacramento only after Los Angeles officials declined to provide
landmark status to what Katz called an "eyesore." The property would
require extensive renovation of structural elements and building
systems, and Casden has "no interest in saving it," Katz said.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps by the end of the year, City Council members will decide
whether Casden Glendon can build Palazzo in some form.</TE>
<TE>   That day can't some too soon for restaurateur Page. "If anyone on
the City Council refuses to support this project," he said, "then
they're not supporting business in Westwood Village."</TE>

<HD>Falling Workers' Comp Trend Ends</HD>
<DH>Labor: Study of figures for 2000 shows that the 13.9%
increase went entirely to pay higher health-care costs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California workers' compensation benefits rose 13.9% to $8.9 billion
in 2000, ending several years of declines relative to wages,
according to a study to be released today by a non-partisan think
tank.</LD>
<LD>   Total wages paid rose 13.5% in 2000, and the number of workers
covered by the state program rose 3.4%, according to the report by
the Washington-based National Academy of Social Insurance. As a
result, workers' compensation benefits for every $100 in wages held
steady at $1.49 in California.</LD>
<LD>   Nationally, benefits, which include cash payments and health-care
coverage, rose to $46.1billion, up from $43.1billion the year before.
For every $100 in wages, the national average benefit dipped slightly
from $1.04 to $1.03. That marked the eighth decline in the national
average in as many years, from a peak of $1.68 in 1992.</LD>
<TE>   The study's authors attributed the downward trend in relative
benefits to strong wage growth, a decline in reported accidents and
the imposition by many states of managed health care and other
reforms in workers' compensation systems in the early and mid-1990s.
But they suspect that increases in workers' comp benefits may soon
outpace total wages.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past couple of years, we have seen a reduction nationally
in cash benefits, but the medical benefits are starting to pick up,"
said John F. Burton, a labor studies professor at Rutgers University
and chairman of the National Academy of Social Insurance panel that
compiled the report.</TE>
<TE>   The 13.9% increase in California benefits reported by the study
for 2000 went entirely to pay higher medical costs, said Tom Rankin,
president of the California Labor Federation, AFL-CIO.</TE>
<TE>   "The claim frequency went down somewhat, but there were no dollar
cash benefit increases during those years," Rankin said.</TE>
<TE>   The academy has issued analyses of workers' compensation for five
years, pegging the payouts to wages in order to make more uniform
comparisons among the state-run systems. The report also found that
employer costs relative to wages declined slightly in 2000 on a
national basis.</TE>
<TE>   Allan Zaremberg, president of the California Chamber of Commerce,
said he believes employer costs are running ahead of wages now
because workers' compensation insurance premiums have gone up 77%
since 1998. He attributed the increases to rising medical costs and
the need for insurers to recoup losses they incurred during a
cost-cutting frenzy induced by the 1994 deregulation of the industry
in the state.</TE>

<HD>FERC Told by Edison of Market Rigging by Enron</HD>
<DH>Energy: Despite warning in August 2000, federal regulators
failed to take action against market manipulation tactics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Southern California Edison warned federal regulators in August 2000
about some of the trading ploys that Enron Corp. used to wring profit
from California, but regulators took little action for months.</LD>
<LD>   During the power-starved summer of 2000, the names Fat Boy,
Ricochet and Load Shift were known only on the trading floor of Enron
and possibly its power-trading rivals. But evidence of these
electricity-trading strategies was spotted by Edison's unusual
market-monitoring operation, which the Rosemead utility created to
protect itself when competitive electricity markets opened in
California in 1998.</LD>
<LD>   The written warning was delivered to investigators with the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as they began to probe problems
in California's electricity markets, where prices had first
skyrocketed the previous May.</LD>
<TE>   "The purpose was to help FERC know what to look for, where to look
and how to look for information," said Gary Stern, director of market
monitoring and head of Edison's three-person market analysis group.
"We knew we had serious problems in the market, and we wanted to take
this opportunity to get this investigation started out right."</TE>
<TE>   "We never tried to come up with clever names for the games we were
looking for," Stern said. "We were looking for relief."</TE>
<TE>   The previously secret memo was released Wednesday by Sen. Dianne
Feinstein (D-Calif.) during a Senate committee hearing on Enron and
its potential manipulation on Western energy markets. But Edison, a
unit of Edison International, had withheld comment on its analysis
until Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The memo discusses several ways energy traders or generators
intentionally created phantom congestion and then were paid to
relieve the congestion, sometimes by creating fictitious flows of
energy in the other direction. It also described other ways traders
and generators forced the California Independent System Operator to
pay as much as possible for electricity or related services in the
markets the Folsom nonprofit operates.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the memo describes how Enron once scheduled 2,800
megawatts of power on a transmission path despite knowing the line
could accommodate only 15 megawatts.</TE>
<TE>   "This likely results in increased day-ahead energy prices, and
increased congestion costs on the path where the game was played,"
the Edison memo said. "Day-ahead peak energy prices increased from
about $30 to about $45" per megawatt-hour.</TE>
<TE>   Stern presented the memo on Aug. 17, 2000, to FERC investigators
during a meeting in San Francisco that also was attended by
representatives of PG&amp;E Corp.'s Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and Sempra
Energy's San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, the state's two other
investor-owned utilities.</TE>
<TE>   SDG&amp;E earlier that month had filed a complaint with FERC because
its customers were being subjected to record bills and had been since
May of that year, when power prices first surged. Edison's and PG&amp;E's
customers were then shielded from wholesale electricity costs by a
rate cap, and the two utilities were accumulating huge power debts
they were unable to pass along to customers.</TE>
<TE>   FERC, a sort of national utility regulator and the final arbiter
of the fairness of electricity trading markets, has much greater
authority to investigate than a market participant such as Edison
does.</TE>
<TE>   But when FERC released its staff investigation Nov. 1, it said
there was the potential for market manipulation but cited neither
specific examples nor perpetrators. It followed with a series of
attempts to fix California's market problems but did not achieve
significant success until June 2001, when it instituted price caps on
most Western states and required generators to offer their wares to
the market.</TE>
<TE>   "We read the November report, and as we had feared they didn't
deal with a lot of the issues that we raised," Stern said. "They
didn't have a lot of time, and you could argue that some of these
things were very difficult to find."</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein last week condemned FERC, saying the memo was "further
corroboration through Southern California Edison that the Western
marketplace was being manipulated and gamed while it appeared the
federal agency responsible for overseeing the marketplace and
ensuring just and reasonable prices failed to respond."</TE>
<TE>   FERC Chairman Patrick H. Wood III responded that the agency was
continuing its investigations of Enron and others but that some of
the blame for its energy woes lies with California, which failed for
several years to build major power plants. A FERC spokeswoman on
Monday declined to comment further.</TE>

<DH>Not even 'The Eminem Show' is exempt from piracy</DH>

<LD>Despite extraordinary efforts to keep it under wraps, the eagerly
awaited new CD from platinum-selling rapper Eminem met the same fate
as every other recent release from a major artist: It went out for
free on the Internet long before fans could buy it in stores.</LD>
<LD>   "The Eminem Show" may still prove to be the year's biggest-selling
record, with well more than 1 million copies expected to be sold in
its first week alone. Yet its vulnerability to pirates demonstrates
vividly how ill-prepared the music industry is for a new digital era.</LD>
<LD>   Executives at Vivendi Universal, the global media conglomerate
that distributes Eminem's records, held an emergency meeting Monday
to discuss what further steps to take to safeguard sales. The company
already had taken the unusual step of moving up the release date of
"The Eminem Show" by more than a week, to today.</LD>
<TE>   One problem for Vivendi's Universal Music Group, and for every
other record company, is that their established techniques for
developing and promoting artists are threatened by the phenomenal
growth of networks that let consumers download music for free.</TE>
<TE>   Record companies typically incur millions of dollars in costs
setting up superstar releases like "The Eminem Show" at radio and
retail outlets. Labels execute lengthy global marketing campaigns
incorporating several music videos and radio singles staggered over a
two-year period with the aim of stimulating continued sales.</TE>
<TE>   Such industry-standard campaigns, built upon gradual exposure to
songs, are likely to become obsolete in a world where consumers can
sample every track before a recording is even put up for sale.</TE>
<TE>   "There are more than 3 billion downloads a month around the
world," said Interscope Group head Jimmy Iovine, whose Vivendi
Universal company released the new Eminem CD. "The problem the
industry is facing right now is a level of piracy never seen before,
whether its selling burned CDs in school or on the corner. This is
affecting not only the record labels and artists, but anyone who has
an interest in earning a living through music."</TE>
<TE>   Iovine said piracy of Eminem's new CD shines a light on a problem
that is damaging the careers of other lesser-known acts every day.</TE>
<TE>   Because "The Eminem Show" is so widely anticipated, many fans are
likely to purchase the CD even after they download it. Where piracy
really hurts, Iovine said, is that it is eroding the potential fan
base of new acts with one or two hits under their belt.</TE>
<TE>   Iovine and other executives say fans frequently download only the
best songs of a developing artist and skip buying the record. This
undercuts not only sales for the company, but the artist's ability to
record a second or third album.</TE>
<TE>   But piracy can damage blockbusters too. Even if "The Eminem Show"
sells more than a million CDs during its debut week, it is impossible
to determine how many sales will be lost immediately as a result of
digital pilfering--or even over the next year.</TE>
<TE>   Because the profits from top-selling albums subsidize the 85% or
more of the acts that don't break even, any drop in sales for the
likes of Eminem undermines the support for less heralded artists.</TE>
<TE>   "The Eminem Show" is expected to break the 1 million mark faster
than any record since last summer. Over the last year and a half, as
file-sharing services reached the mass market, only one record has
sold that many copies in its first week: 'N Sync's "Celebrity," which
was released in July.</TE>
<TE>   With Eminem's last record selling 8.7 million copies, his label,
Interscope took great pains to keep the songs from hitting the Net
before the CD was released. No copies of the CD were sent to
reviewers, who had to listen to the songs in Interscope's offices
instead of on their own stereos.</TE>
<TE>   Interscope flooded the file-sharing networks with bogus copies of
the songs that played the same short segments over and over. Only
after downloading would users realize they'd been had.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the new CD hit the Internet in its entirety almost a
month ago, and has been trickling down to the masses of file-sharing
consumers ever since. The bogus files are still plentiful on the Net,
but they're gradually giving way to the real thing. Meanwhile,
legitimate online services--including Universal's own
Pressplay--can't make the new Eminem songs available to paying
customers.</TE>
<TE>   The head of the Recording Industry Assn. of America's anti-piracy
efforts, Frank Creighton, argues that the piracy problem can be
minimized if the labels work closely with the RIAA and its
international counterparts, as Eminem's label has done. The RIAA has
seized more than 100,000 pirated discs over the last two weeks from
two dozen outlets, Creighton said, but less than 2,000 of them were
"The Eminem Show"--a much smaller percentage than is typical for a
major release.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the relentlessness of piracy has the major labels
contemplating more aggressive tactics, including releasing albums on
discs with electronic locks that deter digital copying. They've also
joined the Hollywood studios in lobbying for a federal law that would
require computer and consumer-electronics manufacturers to alter
their designs to combat piracy.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, executives at several labels are kicking around the
idea of suing some universities, companies and individuals that
operate computer servers that allow storage of stolen songs that can
be accessed by file-sharing services.</TE>
<TE>   Other interest groups, including representatives of a leading
file-sharing network and a tech-industry trade association, want to
tax an array of hardware, software and services to compensate
copyright holders for the rampant downloading. That approach "will be
a very seriously debated counterpoint for the whole Hollywood
agenda," predicted Philip S. Corwin, a lobbyist for one of the
file-sharing networks, Kazaa.</TE>
<TE>   Global music sales declined to $32 billion last year, a 16% drop
from the year before. While some in the music industry blame the
overall economy and a shortage of high-quality releases, many label
executives put the blame squarely on Internet piracy.</TE>
<TE>   The RIAA has been battling piracy for more than 30 years, with
most of that time spent on counterfeit products. Last year it seized
nearly 3 million counterfeit or pirated discs, a 66% increase over
the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   On the Net, unauthorized digital copies of songs and CDs spread
much faster and far more broadly than counterfeit discs. Although
Internet piracy has been around longer than the World Wide Web,
unauthorized copying has exploded in the last two years as more
consumers connected to the Net at high speed and easy-to-use
file-sharing services hit the market.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened with the Eminem release can have a real impact on a
company's ability to do business," said Sony Music Entertainment
Chairman Thomas D. Mottola. "In instances where music is released on
the Internet in unfinished form--which happened recently with [Sony
rock act] System of the Down--artistic expression and sales can both
be compromised.</TE>
<TE>   "So it's not just a matter of economics, it's also a matter of
protecting the creative process itself," Mottola added. "There is no
doubt that technology is going to have to be part of the industry's
response to piracy, but it's important to keep in mind that attitudes
toward piracy are just as big an issue."</TE>
<TE>   Champions of online music sharing often downplay the ethical and
legal ramifications of consumers building huge collections of music
without paying. Accusing music corporations of cheating artists and
gouging consumers to sustain profits, they say downloading songs is a
legal exercise of consumer rights that actually promotes sales.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer advocates argue that it's perfectly legal for consumers
to make digital copies of the CDs they buy and to record songs from
their collection on custom CDs for personal use. And stopping
consumers from making easy digital copies won't make much of a dent
in piracy because there are other ways to "rip" songs from a disc,
said Eric Garland, chief executive of BigChampagne, a company that
monitors file-sharing networks.</TE>
<TE>   "For most of us here on the ground, downloading the music is
simply an expression of demand, of raw consumer demand, of a desire
to hear it and have it," Garland said. "We create a demand like that
and we expect people to behave like good little consumers and wait
until the big day" of the official release.</TE>

<HD>2 May Miss Deadline for Global Crossing Bid</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Hutchison Whampoa, STT would forfeit their breakup
fee if they fail to acquire the fiber-optic operator.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The two companies that Global Crossing Ltd., the ailing fiber-optic
network operator, is relying on for a combined offer to rescue it
from creditors may miss a deadline today to formalize their offer.</LD>
<LD>   Creditors are pushing Hong Kong's Hutchison Whampoa and Singapore
Technologies Telemedia to increase the $750-million cash injection
they proposed as part of Global Crossing's filing for bankruptcy
protection in January, a source close to the process said.</LD>
<LD>   Representatives for the Asian companies could not be reached for
comment, but Global Crossing confirmed Monday that the deadline might
be missed.</LD>
<TE>   "I wouldn't be surprised if this were delayed slightly, but it
wouldn't have much of an impact," said Cynthia Artin, a spokeswoman
for Global Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   The offer still could be formalized at a later date, she said, but
by missing the deadline Hutchison Whampoa and STT would forfeit their
right to a breakup fee if they failed to eventually acquire Global
Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   Hutchison Whampoa and STT want 79% of the Bermuda-based telecom
firm. Creditors, who are owed billions, would receive the remaining
2% and $300 million from Hutchison Whampoa and STT.</TE>
<TE>   More than 60 potential bidders have expressed interest in
acquiring a piece or all of Global Crossing's 100,000-mile network
since the telecom filed Jan. 28 the fourth-largest bankruptcy case in
U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   But under bankruptcy law, they are not allowed to formalize a bid
until a 120-day exclusivity period expires, during which time Global
Crossing can formulate its own restructuring plan without worrying
about competing ones from outsiders.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the company asked a Bankruptcy Court judge to extend
the exclusivity period by 125 days. The judge is expected to rule on
the motion next month.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing made the request because of the complexity of the
bankruptcy, not because of problems with Hutchison Whampoa and STT's
proposed bid, Artin said.</TE>
<TE>   Some parties considering a bid after the exclusivity period said
any extension would be a bad idea.</TE>
<TE>   "We're concerned that if the exclusivity period is extended, with
[Global Crossing's] burn rate there will be no liquid assets left.
And that would shift negotiating power from the creditors to the
debtors," said Michael Pascazi, chief executive of Fiber Optek
Interconnect Corp., a private fiber-optic firm in Wappingers Falls,
N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Fiber Optek detailed a plan to offer Global Crossing
creditors $250 million in cash, $500 million in expected accounts
receivable payments, a 28% stake in the new firm, and an option to
increase that amount by 8% through convertible warrants.</TE>
<TE>   Although the plan offers creditors significantly less upfront cash
and equity than the Hutchison Whampoa and STT bid, creditors could
reap a much bigger return if a restructured Global Crossing is
moderately successful, Pascazi said.</TE>

<HD>Microsoft to Offer Net Game Service</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: The global network, Xbox Live, is seen as an
attempt to bolster lackluster sales of its video game console.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After lackluster launches of its Xbox video game console in Japan and
Europe, Microsoft Corp. on Monday unveiled plans to spend hundreds of
millions of dollars building a worldwide network that will let gamers
play over the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   The service, called Xbox Live, is widely seen as an attempt by
Microsoft to bolster the faltering Xbox, which has sold just 4
million units since its debut last fall. By comparison, market leader
Sony Corp. has sold more than 30 million PlayStation 2 consoles.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said Microsoft needs to make a splash at this week's
Electronic Entertainment Expo at the Los Angeles Convention Center if
it is to resurrect some of the early buzz surrounding Xbox. Although
the most powerful and versatile of the three major consoles, Xbox has
suffered a dearth of compelling games.</LD>
<TE>   Industry executives said it's a mistake for the company to focus
on technology that has little near-term revenue potential. But
analysts said the drive to go online is part of Microsoft's long-term
ambition to eventually own the gateway to living rooms and control
the standards that regulate the transfer of all forms of digital
entertainment, from games to music to movies.</TE>
<TE>   "On the [personal computer], nothing happens without Microsoft"
because the company's operating system runs more than 90% of all the
world's PCs, said Josh Bernoff, principal analyst with Forrester
Research in Cambridge, Mass. "But on devices such as cell phones,
set-top boxes and game consoles, there's no requirement that
Microsoft be involved. And Microsoft desperately wants to make sure
it has a role in these other devices, not just the PC."</TE>
<TE>   The Redmond, Wash., software giant said it will charge players an
introductory rate of $49.95 for a year's subscription when Xbox Live
goes online this fall. The fee will include a headset for voice chat
but will not cover the cost of high-speed, or broadband, Internet
access.</TE>
<TE>   "Xbox will be the only all-broadband-dedicated video game
service," said John O'Rourke, Microsoft's director of worldwide
marketing. Online capabilities would let gamers find opponents,
download new levels, weapons or characters, post high scores and play
in tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   With hundreds of millions of dollars invested in Xbox Live,
Microsoft is playing to win. The company is putting more staff on
building the project than it did to design the console itself. It's
placing hundreds of servers in Tokyo, London and Seattle to handle
online traffic. And it's spending millions making its own online
games for Xbox.</TE>
<TE>   The project, however, faces numerous hurdles. The Xbox, which has
a built-in ethernet adaptor, can support only high-speed connections.
Just one in 10 U.S. households had broadband at the end of 2001,
according to Forrester Research Inc., a technology research and
consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   And even if consumers have broadband, it's likely to be connected
to their PC rather than to devices in their living room. Once
connected, other pitfalls await, including hackers, viruses, delays
in transferring data and excessive download times for rich media.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft officials said the company is prepared for the
headaches.</TE>
<TE>   "We've built in military-grade security," O'Rourke said. "It's a
platform designed to manage those environmental factors."</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft will be competing with other console companies this
fall. Sony will release a dual dial-up and broadband modem for
PlayStation 2 in August. And Nintendo Co. last week said it will sell
two modems--one high-speed, the other dial-up--for its GameCube.</TE>
<TE>   Both Nintendo and Sony offer an "open system" in which game
publishers must provide their own servers and other online
infrastructure. Publishers of games for Xbox Live, by contrast, must
use Microsoft servers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's freedom versus control," said Luc Vanhal, president of
Vivendi Universal Games, a division of Vivendi Universal Publishing.
"We have 11 million active players on our online Web site. Do I
really want to hand those names over to someone else?"</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft unveiled its online plans two days before the start of
the Electronic Entertainment Expo, or E3, the industry's largest
trade show. With PlayStation 2 firmly in first place, Microsoft has a
great deal to prove at E3, industry watchers say.</TE>
<TE>   The company saw anemic sales in Japan this year, and the
introduction of the Xbox in Europe was marred by a price that was too
dear for most consumers. Microsoft quickly sliced its price from 479
euros ($440) to 299 euros ($275) and offered to send two free games
and a controller to those who purchased the console at the higher
price.</TE>
<TE>   Most say that the online strategy, though promising in the long
term, is too far off. Microsoft must instead focus on traditional
offline games to buttress its business.</TE>
<TE>   "It's Microsoft's E3 to prove," said Shawn C. Milne, analyst with
Soundview Technology Group in San Francisco. "Sony is firmly in the
leadership position. Nintendo remains in very good shape. Microsoft,
meanwhile, has to show that they have the software to deliver this
holiday."</TE>

<HD>FDA Approves New Use for Pfizer's Zoloft</HD>
<DH>Drugs: Agency OKs the widely prescribed antidepressant as
treatment for a severe premenstrual disorder.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pfizer Inc. became the latest drug company to broaden the uses for
one of its mature-patent medicines Monday when it received Food and
Drug Administration approval to market its anti-depression drug
Zoloft as a treatment for a severe form of premenstrual syndrome
known as PMDD.</LD>
<LD>   Pfizer's push to sell an antidepressant for premenstrual dysphoric
disorder follows a similar successful effort last year by Eli Lilly &amp;
Co., which markets a variation of the antidepressant Prozac under the
name Serafem.</LD>
<LD>   As their profits get squeezed by competition from lower-cost
generic drugs, the big pharmaceutical companies are seeking as many
FDA-sanctioned uses as possible for their most successful drugs,
whether or not they still have patent protection for them.</LD>
<TE>   But analysts say this tactic seldom produces more than a slight
boost in sales for the drugs, and critics say too many drugs are
being pushed for too many questionable uses.</TE>
<TE>   PMDD is characterized by intense emotional and physical symptoms
that occur during the time between ovulation and menstruation and is
supposed to be more severe than PMS. But the use of antidepressants
to treat PMDD and even the existence of PMDD itself are still harshly
debated in some corners.</TE>
<TE>   "The drug industry can be counted on to go too far," said David
Oaks, director of the Oregon-based Support Coalition International, a
mental health advocacy group that says recognizing PMDD as a serious
disorder wrongly "created a whole new category of the mentally ill
with one stroke of a pen."</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street analysts were not excited over Pfizer's news in
particular nor by secondary uses for drugs in general.</TE>
<TE>   "It will allow them to go back into doctors' offices and push a
new use for their drug," said Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. analyst Joseph
Riccardo. "But in the scheme of things, it doesn't amount to a whole
lot. This isn't going to drive a new market."</TE>
<TE>   Other analysts agreed, saying alternative uses will at best
provide a cushion for future lost sales to generics.</TE>
<TE>   Sales figures appear to bear that out. Lilly's fluoxetine
hydrochloride line, which includes Prozac, Prozac Weekly and Serafem,
was throttled by generic competition in the first quarter, when sales
plummeted 70% from $622.9million to $186.1million.</TE>
<TE>   Another example is GlaxoSmithKline's Wellbutrin, approved as an
antidepressant in 1996. The drug also inhibits the desire to smoke
cigarettes and is sold as Zyban. But Zyban sales were $78million in
2001, a relative pittance compared with Wellbutrin sales of
$905million that same year.</TE>
<TE>   Nick Vasilopoulos, national leader of the managed pharmacy group
for Mercer Human Resource Consulting, still sees attempts to find new
uses for a drug more palatable than efforts to simply extend patent
protections or to switch consumers over to a supposedly new
formulation of a drug that has patent protections.</TE>
<TE>   "To the extent that it provides an effective new treatment, it's
good," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Arriola, coordinator of the Drug Information Center at the UCLA
Medical Center, said, "By adding a new use, certain drugs will stand
out. They will be more likely to remain on a prescription drug
formulary than others that have only one use."</TE>
<TE>   But Arriola also sees another kind of pressure on the drug firms.
In years past, when the most successful drugs sold for about
one-third or less than the cost of today's blockbuster medications,
it was relatively easy to find quick replacements once patents
expired.</TE>
<TE>   "The stakes are much greater now," Arriola said. "These companies
are trying to get as much as they can out of these drugs."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Boland, a health-care expert, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "This usually starts a year before a drug goes off patent. Each
pharmaceutical company is attempting to leverage their investment as
much as possible by extending some kind of price protection. They are
playing by the rules because that is what the rule says they can do,"
Boland said. "If you are a shareholder in the company, that's
probably a good thing. If you're a consumer, it might not be."</TE>
<TE>   Pfizer shares closed at $36.43 on Monday on the New York Stock
Exchange, down 66 cents.</TE>

<HD>AT&amp;T Wireless May Face FCC Fine</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AT&amp;T Wireless Services Inc. may have to pay a $2.2-million penalty
for failing to install equipment needed to track locations of
customers' emergency calls.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Communications Commission proposed the fine because
the company missed an October deadline to upgrade part of its network
so police can find callers. AT&amp;T Wireless also didn't sell handsets
needed for the location system, the FCC said on its Internet site.</LD>
<LD>   The third-biggest U.S. mobile-phone company should have notified
the agency that it couldn't meet the requirements, the FCC said.
Verizon Wireless Inc. and other rivals also missed the installation
deadline because gear that tracks 911 calls wasn't sold by
manufacturers. Those carriers weren't penalized because they asked
the FCC for an extension before October.</LD>
<TE>   "We plan to vigorously contest this," AT&amp;T Wireless spokeswoman
Rochelle Cohen said. "We are as frustrated as anyone by these vendor
delays."</TE>
<TE>   The company has 30 days to pay the fine or tell the agency why the
penalty should be reduced or waived.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Redmond, Wash.-based AT&amp;T Wireless fell 42 cents, or
5.4%, to $7.43 on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have fallen
48% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Verizon Wireless, a venture of New York-based Verizon
Communications Inc. and Vodafone Group of Britain, is the largest
U.S. mobile-phone company. Cingular Wireless, a venture of BellSouth
Corp. and SBC Communications Inc., is the second biggest.</TE>

<HD>Biotech Shares Take a Hit on More Bad News</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: Investors react critically to reports from
an oncologists meeting on failed and delayed drugs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONI CLARKE</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The annual meeting of the nation's cancer specialists, one of the
largest and most closely watched medical gatherings of the year,
often gives biotechnology stocks a fillip. Not this year.</LD>
<LD>   More bad news from ImClone Systems Inc., whose drug Erbitux failed
in a mid-stage trial to halt or reverse the course of head and neck
cancer, sent its shares tumbling $2.29, or 17%, to $11.12 on Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Many other biotech stocks also slumped, renewing their sharp
declines of recent months, as news from the American Society of
Clinical Oncologists meeting here did little to inspire investors.</LD>
<TE>   The American Stock Exchange biotechnology stock index fell 2.1% to
411.39. It has tumbled 29% this year on concern that new drugs many
investors had expected to emerge from the decoding of the human
genome may take much longer to materialize than some scientists had
hoped. The biotech index's decline far exceeds the 13% loss this year
in the Nasdaq composite index.</TE>
<TE>   Biotech shares rocketed in 1999 and 2000 on surging optimism about
new treatments. But "the reality is it's much more difficult than
people thought," said Matt Stephani, a portfolio manager at the Idex
Great Companies of America Global Fund.</TE>
<TE>   More than a dozen drugs have failed clinical trials or been
delayed in the regulatory approval process since January. That wave
of bad news has some questioning whether the latest method of drug
discovery--marrying functional genomics with mass screening
techniques of drug candidates--is creating smoke but no fire.</TE>
<TE>   The mapping of the genome is creating hundreds of potential
disease targets against which to develop drugs. Often scientists see
that a gene has an interesting function, such as lowering blood
pressure, and throw compounds at it in the hope something will stick.
That's too random an approach, some experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a difference between knowing something has biological
significance and proving it has clinical significance," said Toni
Schuh, chief executive of Sequenom Inc., a company that makes tools
it says can help scientists pick the most promising targets.</TE>
<TE>   Others say that there's nothing wrong with the approach, but that
expectations have been irrationally inflated and that investors
should not expect to see a raft of new products for 10 to 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   "The time to develop drugs is much longer than Wall Street ever
expected," said Scott Morrison, national director of life sciences at
accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young.</TE>
<TE>   High-profile recent disappointments include Abgenix Inc.'s
decision last week to drop development of one of its two main drugs
after it failed to prove effective in treating the skin disorder
psoriasis.</TE>
<TE>   Also last week, Emisphere Technologies Inc. said its oral version
of the blood-thinning injectable drug heparin proved less effective
than an existing product.</TE>
<TE>   There was one bright spot Monday: Telik Inc. reported
better-than-expected results of a cancer drug trial on ovarian and
lung cancer patients. Its shares rose $1.14, or 10.2%, to $12.36.</TE>
<TE>   Some investors say that the decline in biotech stocks is overdone
and that promising firms have been tarred with the same brush as
duds.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly some of these companies didn't deserve to have been
valued as high as they were, but the pendulum has now swung so far
the other way it's preposterous," said Paul Abel, portfolio manager
at Kinetics Medical Fund.</TE>

<HD>Computer Associates Under SEC Probe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal authorities are trying to determine whether Computer
Associates International Inc. wrongly booked more than $500million in
sales in its 1998 and 1999 fiscal years as part of a plan to enrich
senior managers, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday.</LD>
<LD>   News of the investigation by the Justice Department and the
Securities and Exchange Commission sent the company's shares falling
2.1%, or 36 cents, to $17.20 in trading Monday on the New York Stock
Exchange.</LD>
<LD>   The company continues to believe it acted appropriately, said
spokeswoman Denise DesChenes. SEC spokesman John Nester declined to
comment.</LD>
<TE>   Increasing sales was a factor behind Computer Associates' rising
share price in the late 1990s, the Journal reported, citing sources
it didn't identify. In May 1998, the company's three top managers,
Chairman Charles Wang, Chief Executive Sanjay Kumar and head of
research Russell Artzt, received a stock award worth about $1 billion
because the shares reached a trigger price of $55.13, the report
said.</TE>
<TE>   Now investigators want to know whether the company overstated
sales for the period immediately preceding and following the stock
grants. Investigators are looking into the company's move in May 2000
to shave $1.76 billion, or more than 10%, from revenue reported in
the previous three fiscal years, the Journal said.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, on the advice of the company's auditor, Computer
Associates changed the way it classified expenses and revenue,
DesChenes said. KPMG replaced Ernst &amp; Young as the company's auditor
in June 1999. Ernst &amp; Young has been subpoenaed by the SEC. KPMG has
declined to comment on whether it has been subpoenaed.</TE>
<TE>   "This change in presentation had no impact on reported earnings,
earnings per share or cash flows," DesChenes said. "Additionally,
this had no material effect on CA's historical revenue growth trend
for the five-year period 1996-2000."</TE>
<TE>   The company shifted to a new method of booking sales in October
2000. The one used in 1998 involved selling multiyear software
licenses, booking the full amount, then renewing contracts before the
term of the initial contact expired, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. analyst
Peter Goldmacher has said. The system left overlapping revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Now the firm uses shorter contracts and books them each month,
pro-rating the total cost monthly.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Real estate investment trust AvalonBay Communities Inc. has broken
ground on its first apartment development in Southern California, a
233-unit project in Glendale.</LD>
<LD>   When completed in fall 2003, Avalon at Glendale Court will have a
value of more than $50 million, said Lawrence A. Scott, an AvalonBay
vice president. The 5.12-acre project on Central Avenue north of the
Ventura Freeway will be the city's first apartment complex built
since 1989, company executives said.</LD>
<LD>   In the last five years, the Alexandria, Va.-based company has
purchased and renovated 18 apartment complexes in Los Angeles, Orange
and San Diego counties. AvalonBay said it has a goal of building 700
to 1,000 apartments annually in the region.</LD>
<TE>   "Since opening Southern California operations in 1997, we have
been searching for the best possible location in which to build our
first new luxury community," Scott said.</TE>

<HD>Ernst &amp; Young Violated Auditor Rules, SEC Alleges</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Agency accuses firm of improper conduct in
entering a venture with PeopleSoft.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press and Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The accounting profession, already reeling from the Enron
Corp./Arthur Andersen scandal, suffered another hit Monday as federal
regulators alleged that Ernst &amp; Young violated rules designed to keep
accountants independent from the companies they audit.</LD>
<LD>   The Securities and Exchange Commission said Ernst &amp; Young
compromised the independence of its audits of PeopleSoft Inc. by
entering a business venture with the software company.</LD>
<LD>   The issue of auditor independence is among those at the heart of
the Enron affair, which has raised questions about Enron's longtime
accountant Arthur Andersen having done both auditing and lucrative
consulting work for the company.</LD>
<TE>   The SEC's action came as the Senate Banking Committee
postponed--in the face of heavy Republican and industry pressure--a
vote on legislation that would impose restrictions on accounting
firms' ability to do consulting work for their audit clients.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's action was the second time the SEC has brought an auditor
independence action against Ernst &amp; Young. The firm settled a 1995
action by agreeing to comply with independence guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   Ernst &amp; Young said it was "surprised and disappointed" by the
SEC's charges Monday and disputed the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Like embattled Andersen, Ernst &amp; Young is a Big Five accounting
firm. As Andersen has lost a stream of corporate clients and has sold
chunks of its business to rivals in recent weeks, Ernst &amp; Young has
absorbed many of Andersen's overseas operations as well as operations
in Virginia, Maryland and Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   In an administrative proceeding, the SEC said that Ernst &amp; Young
was auditing the books of PeopleSoft at the same time it was
developing and marketing a software product in tandem with the
company. Ernst &amp; Young engaged in the dual activities from 1993
through 2000, according to the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC said that the product, named EY/GEMS for PeopleSoft,
incorporated some components of PeopleSoft's proprietary source code
into software previously developed and marketed by Ernst &amp; Young's
tax department.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC alleged that Ernst &amp; Young tried to gain a competitive
advantage by putting the source code into its product and agreed to
pay PeopleSoft royalties of 15% to 30% from each sale of the product.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC ordered that a hearing be held on the case before an
administrative law judge within 60 days to determine whether
sanctions should be imposed on Ernst &amp; Young.</TE>
<TE>   "Our conduct was entirely appropriate and permissible under the
profession's rules," New York-based Ernst &amp; Young said in a
statement.</TE>
<TE>   The firm said its marketing arrangement with PeopleSoft didn't
affect the software company or its shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   The charges were approved by a single SEC member, Isaac Hunt,
because Chairman Harvey Pitt and Commissioner Cynthia Glassman
recused themselves, SEC spokeswoman Christi Harlan said.</TE>
<TE>   It's "highly unusual, if not unprecedented" for a single
commissioner to vote on an SEC case, former SEC general counsel Simon
Lorne said.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt, who has been criticized for meeting with former clients who
are under SEC investigation, represented Ernst &amp; Young while a lawyer
in private practice. Glassman worked at the firm as an economist.</TE>
<TE>   SEC Chief Accountant Robert Herdman, who was a senior partner at
Ernst &amp; Young, also recused himself from the investigation, Harlan
said.</TE>
<TE>   Ernst &amp; Young said it carefully considered its consultants'
actions before they were taken, concluding that such arrangements
were common and permitted under accounting rules.</TE>
<TE>   In a similar case, the SEC in January censured another Big Five
accounting firm, KPMG, for allegedly violating the auditor
independence rules. The agency said KPMG invested $25million in a
mutual fund at the same time it was auditing the fund's books. KPMG
invested the money in the AIM mutual fund in May 2000 and kept that
account open through year's end, according to the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   KPMG, which was not fined, agreed to the SEC's censure without
admitting to or denying the allegations. The firm also agreed to take
measures to prevent future violations.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC adopted the independence rules in November 2000 after a
bitter fight between the accounting industry and Arthur Levitt, then
SEC chairman. He and others worried that accountants in some cases
had become too cozy with the companies they audited, threatening the
integrity of financial reports and undermining investor confidence.</TE>
<TE>   The rules identified nine services as inconsistent with auditor
independence, including bookkeeping, financial systems design and
implementation, human resources and legal services.</TE>

<HD>Gilmour Rejoins Ford as Chief Financial Officer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DEARBORN, Mich.</DL>
<LD>In the latest appointment of a top-level executive to help turn the
company around from its $5.45-billion loss last year, Ford Motor Co.
on Monday announced that former Vice Chairman Allan Gilmour is
rejoining the company as chief financial officer.</LD>
<LD>   Gilmour, 67, retired from Ford in 1995 but has retained ties with
the auto maker and with Chief Executive William Clay Ford Jr. through
his work chairing Henry Ford Health Systems, a leading health-care
provider in Michigan.</LD>
<LD>   "Allan is one of the great assets of Ford Motor Co.," Ford told
reporters at company headquarters. "He is renowned for understanding
the business at all levels. He will have great credibility with all
our audiences."</LD>
<TE>   Gilmour replaces I. Martin Inglis, who was named group vice
president for business strategy, including the Hertz rental car
business owned by Ford, and mergers and acquisitions.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a positive development given Gilmour's extensive
experience at Ford," said auto industry analyst John Casesa of
Merrill Lynch. "Gilmour's appointment is clever in that it adds much
needed experience right now, and gives the company time to groom a
successor."</TE>
<TE>   Gilmour is one of a handful of openly gay senior executives in
corporate America and is known for speaking his mind about Ford's
business. He said Monday that the Ford Thunderbird, before its recent
makeover and relaunch, "looked bad from any angle."</TE>
<TE>   Gilmour owns a Ford-Chrysler dealership in St. Johnsbury, Vt.,
which he says he will continue to run.</TE>

<HD>2 Brokers Said to Be Discussing a Merger</HD>
<DH>Potential combination of CB Richard Ellis and Grubb &amp; Ellis
is part of continuing industry consolidation amid a slump in leasing,
sales.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two of the nation's largest commercial real estate brokerage firms,
Los Angeles-based CB Richard Ellis Services Inc. and Grubb &amp; Ellis
Co. of New York, reportedly are in merger negotiations as the
industry struggles to deal with a slump in commercial property
leasing and sales.</LD>
<LD>   Talk of a potential merger emerged last week after Grubb &amp; Ellis
announced that a group, headed by board member C. Michael Kojaian,
would inject $15.2million into the business in return for about a 20%
stake in the publicly traded company.</LD>
<LD>   In documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Grubb &amp; Ellis said "a change in control of the company" could
"reasonably" be expected as a result of the deal with Kojaian, a
Detroit-area real estate developer.</LD>
<TE>   The New York Post last week reported that a merger between CB
Richard Ellis--which was acquired last summer by a group led by San
Francisco-based Blum Capital Partners--was imminent.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday, a Grubb &amp; Ellis official confirmed the negotiations with
several senior brokers in Los Angeles, according to a Grubb &amp; Ellis
employee.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesmen for Grubb &amp; Ellis and CB Richard Ellis declined to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   On the New York Stock Exchange, Grubb &amp; Ellis shares rose 10 cents
to close at $4.</TE>
<TE>   The potential combination of the two companies is part of a
continuing industry consolidation. Brokers have come under greater
financial and competitive pressure in the last year as a slowdown in
commercial real estate transactions has eaten into revenues and
profits.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, for example, Los Angeles-based Cushman Realty folded
into New York-based Cushman &amp; Wakefield Inc., and CB Richard Ellis
cut its headquarters and administrative staff by 13%.</TE>
<TE>   Grubb &amp; Ellis has tried several times in recent years to merge
with other companies in an effort to stay competitive with
diversified industry giants such as CB Richard Ellis, Insignia/ESG
and Cushman &amp; Wakefield.</TE>
<TE>   During the company's recent fiscal third quarter, the company
reported a loss of $5.2 million before one-time charges.</TE>
<TE>   "Combining with Grubb &amp; Ellis is combining with a money-losing
company," said securities analyst Sheldon Grodsky. Any buyer would
have to be "willing to withstand losses for a while."</TE>

<HD>Lowe's Beats Forecasts With 54% Profit Jump</HD>
<DH>Retailing: Push into affluent areas helps home-improvement
chain's sales growth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lowe's Cos. said its fiscal first-quarter earnings jumped 54% and
profit this quarter will exceed forecasts, as the world's
second-largest home-improvement retailer reduces expenses and opens
stores.</LD>
<LD>   Net income in the period ended May 3 increased to $345.8million,
or 44 cents a share, from $225.3million, or 29 cents, a year ago,
Lowe's said. Sales rose 23% to $6.47billion.</LD>
<LD>   Lowe's said it controlled inventory and sold more appliances and
flooring, widening profit margins. Demand for lawn and garden
products also bolstered sales as the retailer opened 42 stores.</LD>
<TE>   Chief Executive Robert Tillman is challenging bigger rival Home
Depot Inc. by expanding in cities such as Boston, where the larger
populations have higher average incomes, investors said.</TE>
<TE>   "Lowe's is in a sweet spot because they continue to put stores in
more lucrative markets," said Tim Hathaway of Brown Investment
Advisory &amp; Trust Inc., which manages about $5billion in assets
including 417,729 Lowe's shares. "People are spending more money to
improve their homes."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Lowe's rose $2.04 to $46.80. The stock has climbed 37%
in the last year. Home Depot rose 41cents to $48.50. Both trade on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts had expected first-quarter profit of 36cents, according
to the average estimate of those surveyed by Thomson Financial/ First
Call. Lowe's forecast profit of 53cents to 54cents for the second
quarter, and $1.66 to $1.69 for the year. Analysts' estimates were
51cents and $1.58.</TE>
<TE>   The results "add to our conviction that we have a successful
model," Tillman said. "We are putting the right stores in the right
markets."</TE>
<TE>   Some investors said Lowe's may have a hard time increasing sales
in the second half, even with home sales forecast to rise, if the
Federal Reserve raises interest rates.</TE>
<TE>   Tillman said although he is cautious about the outlook for the
economy for the rest of the year, "this hasn't stopped our expansion
plans." The Wilkesboro, N.C.-based company plans to open 123 stores
this year, including 23 this quarter. More than half of Lowe's 785
stores are in metro markets with populations that exceed 500,000.</TE>
<TE>   La Habra and Antioch in California are among the communities that
will get new stores.</TE>
<TE>   Sales at stores open at least a year in the first quarter rose
7.5%. Lowe's said sales gained in most product categories.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Slump on New Attack Fears</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Disappointing news on economic activity also
contributes to worries. Losses are spread across a wide array of
sectors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks slumped Monday as jitters about possible new terrorist attacks
on the United States and a drop in a key gauge of economic activity
sent investors scampering out of a market that last week racked up
its biggest gain of the year.</LD>
<LD>   Stocks started off on a bad note after Vice President Dick Cheney
said Sunday that an attack on the nation was "almost certain" amid
signs that the Al Qaeda network may be planning another strike.</LD>
<LD>   "Clearly, Cheney's comments are scaring investors, especially
coming off of an 8% up week for Nasdaq," said Seth Tobias, a trader
and fund manager at Circle T Partners.</LD>
<TE>   A bigger-than-expected decline in the U.S. index of leading
economic indicators added to worries by hinting at a tepid economic
recovery.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average slid 123.58 points, or 1.2%, to
10,229.50. The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index was down 14.71
points, or 1.3%, at 1,091.88. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite
index was down 39.80 points, or 2.3%, at 1,701.59.</TE>
<TE>   Losers exceeded winners by a ratio of 5 to 3 on the New York Stock
Exchange and almost 2 to 1 on Nasdaq in light trading.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow climbed 4.2% last week, giving the blue-chip gauge its
best week since September. Nasdaq surged 8.8%, its biggest weekly
gain in 13 months.</TE>
<TE>   The rally left investors primed to take profits when the
Conference Board reported that leading indicators fell 0.4% in April
after inching up 0.1% in March.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest concern is the economy," said Marc Klee, co- manager
of the John Hancock Technology Fund.</TE>
<TE>   But in the short term, Wall Street cited fears of another terror
attack as a reason to sell. A new attack on the United States is
almost certain as U.S. intelligence officials picked up signals that
a fresh Al Qaeda strike could be in the works, Cheney said.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI also warned of a possible plot by the Al Qaeda network to
detonate bombs in U.S. apartment buildings. Investors are worried
that more assaults could hurt consumer sentiment and the economy and

<HD>Online Travel Site Orbitz Plans IPO</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Company is proceeding with sale as regulators
look into rivals' allegations of unfair advantage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Controversial online travel site Orbitz Inc. said Monday it plans to
go public, even though it's losing money, being investigated by two
U.S. agencies for possible antitrust violations and facing a
skeptical market for new stock offerings.</LD>
<LD>   The fast-growing site, formed by five major U.S. airlines in 1999,
hopes to raise up to $125 million to keep expanding its business. But
the proposal to float an initial public offering comes as the Justice
and Transportation departments, along with several state attorneys
general, are probing further into rivals' allegations that Orbitz has
an unfair advantage in providing consumers with the cheapest air
fares.</LD>
<LD>   The Chicago-based company, revealing its financial condition for
the first time in its registration filing with the government, said
it lost $8.9 million on revenue of $32.2 million in this year's first
quarter after losing $103 million last year as it ramped up
operations. Orbitz also said "we expect to incur losses in the
future."</LD>
<TE>   And Orbitz is wading into an IPO market that is decidedly lukewarm
toward companies that aren't profitable. With the economy and stock
market languishing, investors are being choosy about buying new
issues. Orbitz's lead underwriter is Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Another young travel-related concern, JetBlue Airways, is up 62%
from its April 2 IPO price, but the fledgling carrier is making
money.</TE>
<TE>   Orbitz's biggest test could be convincing investors to buy its
stock despite the government investigations. Rivals claim that Orbitz
gets deeply discounted seats from its founding carriers that aren't
available to other travel agencies. Regulators are examining whether
this amounts to collusion among the airlines to give them a
stranglehold on the Internet travel market.</TE>
<TE>   The IPO would give the public a minority stake in Orbitz, so "the
airlines are still going to control Orbitz and therefore consumers
are still going to be hurt by Orbitz," said Antonella Pianalto,
executive director of the Interactive Travel Service Assn., a trade
group for online agents and an Orbitz critic.</TE>
<TE>   Orbitz denies any wrongdoing, claims its service is unbiased and
says it gets the lowest fares in exchange for providing those
airlines and other travel suppliers with sophisticated Web technology
that drives down their distribution costs. The five founding
airlines--AMR Corp.'s American, UAL Corp.'s United, Delta Air Lines
Inc., Northwest Airlines Corp. and Continental Airlines Inc.--account
for 70% of Orbitz's ticket sales and executives from each of those
airlines comprise Orbitz's board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   Department of Transportation spokesman Bill Mosely declined to
comment on Orbitz's IPO specifically, but said his agency is
"monitoring all developments at the company" as it prepares to submit
its report on Orbitz to Congress by July 1. In its filing, Orbitz
also warned that it expects its rivals "will continue to engage in
lobbying" and other actions to generate "negative publicity about
Orbitz and pressing legislation or regulation that could be harmful
to us."</TE>
<TE>   Orbitz's filing didn't indicate how many shares the company hopes
to offer or at what price. It also didn't specify a date for the
offering; those details will be in subsequent revisions of its
registration filing. Orbitz said it expects the stock to trade on
Nasdaq under the symbol "ORBZ."</TE>
<TE>   Despite its controversy, Orbitz is a hit with consumers and it's
expected to become more popular as more travelers migrate to the
Internet to book their reservations. Orbitz is the third-most popular
independent travel site behind Expedia Inc. and Sabre Holdings
Corp.'s Travelocity.com, according to some researchers.</TE>
<TE>   But critics contend that if Orbitz keeps routinely undercutting
rivals on price, it ultimately will reduce competition in the
Internet market and lead to higher prices. Shares of Expedia fell
$5.54 to $78.36 on Monday on Nasdaq, while Sabre slipped 97 cents to
$37.95 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Limited Inc. said first-quarter profit rose 62% on lower costs, and
the second-largest U.S. clothing retailer changed its name to Limited
Brands to reflect its apparel, lingerie and cosmetics businesses.</LD>
<LD>   Net income increased to $49.9million, or 10 cents a share, the
owner of Limited and Express stores said. Revenue fell 4.7% to $2.03
billion, reduced by the sale of the Lane Bryant chain in August.</LD>
<LD>   Limited kept inventory lean, brought in new goods more quickly and
slowed hiring. The company also trimmed costs and gained sales as it
bought back the 16% of Victoria's Secret parent Intimate Brands Inc.
it didn't own.</LD>
<TE>   Limited said it will meet analysts' second-quarter earnings
forecasts. Shares of Columbus, Ohio-based Limited fell 75 cents to
$21.50 on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>Boeing Co. and Honeywell International Inc. were cleared by a jury in
Seattle of charges that design flaws on certain planes allowed
leaking chemical fumes to mix with cabin air, the companies said.</LD>
<LD>   Twenty-six current and former flight attendants from Alaska Air
Group Inc.'s Alaska Airlines claimed in a King County Superior Court
lawsuit that repeated exposure to toxic fumes on MD-80 aircraft over
two decades caused them to suffer neurological damage.</LD>
<LD>   Honeywell, the maker of a part named in the suit, said in a
statement that its products have "proven safe over tens of millions
of hours of operation."</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Chicago-based Boeing fell 29 cents to $45.13. Honeywell,
based in Morristown, N.J., fell 57 cents to $38.90, both on the NYSE.

<LD>A shareholder lawsuit against current and former executives of HCA
Inc., the nation's largest for-profit hospital company, was given new
life by a federal appeals court panel.</LD>
<LD>   Shareholders in the class-action suit alleged in 1997 that they
were defrauded by management of the Nashville-based company, then
called Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., which saw stock prices plunge
after federal agents raided offices and hospitals amid a wide-ranging
fraud investigation.</LD>
<LD>   Two years ago, a lower court dismissed the suit and prohibited the
shareholders from amending their complaint. But the U.S. 6th Circuit
Court of Appeals decided that there was no evidence that the
plaintiffs acted in bad faith and allowed them to file again.</LD>

<LD>* Senate Banking Committee Chairman Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.)
postponed action on accounting oversight legislation until after the
congressional Memorial Day recess. The delay came amid mounting
industry and Republican opposition to the chairman's bill, which
would create an accounting oversight panel with more authority than
one approved by the Republican-controlled House.</LD>
<LD>   * Energy companies El Paso Corp. and Questar Corp. said they have
not engaged in the types of sham energy trades that falsely boosted
volumes and revenues at some of their rivals.</LD>
<LD>   * World Wrestling Federation Entertainment Inc. said it
repurchased NBC's stake in the company for about $27.7 million. World
Wrestling paid the TV network $12 a share for about 2.31 million
shares of its Class A common stock, the Stamford, Conn.-based company
said. In March 2000, NBC invested $30 million in World Wrestling to
own half of the XFL football league, which folded last May.</LD>

<LD>Kmart Corp. spent as much as $1.05 billion in the first quarter as it
slashed prices and prepared to close hundreds of stores.</LD>
<LD>   The discount retailer also said for the first time that it is
reviewing executive compensation as part of its internal review of
former management.</LD>
<LD>   Kmart spent $600 million to $800 million in the quarter for the

retailer is liquidating merchandise and plans to fire about 22,000
workers.</LD>
<TE>   Troy, Mich.-based Kmart, which filed for Chapter 11 in January

<HD>Low-Tech Pen Foils CD Copy-Protection Device</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Technology buffs have cracked music publishing giant Sony Music
Entertainment Inc.'s elaborate disc copy-protection technology with a
decidedly low-tech method: scribbling around the rim of a disc with a
felt-tip marker.</LD>
<LD>   Internet newsgroups have been circulating news of the discovery
for a week, and users have pilloried Sony for deploying "high-tech"
copy protection that can be defeated by paying a visit to a
stationery store.</LD>
<LD>   "I wonder what type of copy protection will come next?" one
posting on Alt.music.prince read. "Maybe they'll ban markers."</LD>
<TE>   Sony did not return calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Major music labels, including Sony and Universal Music, have begun
selling the "copy-proof" discs as a means of tackling the rampant
spread of music piracy, which they claim is eating into sales.</TE>
<TE>   The technology, Key2Audio, aims to prevent consumers from copying,
or "burning," music onto recordable CDs or onto their computer hard
drives, which enables the music to be shared with other users over
file-sharing Internet services such as Kazaa and Morpheus MusicCity.</TE>
<TE>   Sony's proprietary technology, deployed on many recent releases,
works by adding a track to the copy-protected disc that contains
bogus data.</TE>
<TE>   Because computer hard drives are programmed to read data files
first, the computer will continually try to play the bogus track
first. It never gets to play the music tracks elsewhere on the disc.</TE>
<TE>   The result is that the copy-protected disc will play on standard
CD players but not on computer CD-ROM drives, some portable devices
and even some car stereo systems.</TE>
<TE>   Internet postings claim that tape or even a sticky note also can
be used to cover the security track.</TE>
<TE>   And there are suggestions that copy-protection schemes used by
other music labels can be circumvented in a similar way.</TE>

<SE></SE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Metromedia Fiber Network Inc. filed the second-largest bankruptcy in
the telecommunications industry, which has been slammed by falling
prices, slack demand and stiff competition. The company has debt of
about $3.3 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Metromedia Fiber, which is backed by Verizon Communications Inc.
and other wealthy investors, said it will continue to operate during
its Chapter 11 bankruptcy restructuring.</LD>
<LD>   It hired Impala Partners to assist during the reorganization and
UBS Warburg to advise on its strategic alternatives.</LD>
<TE>   Metromedia, which builds high-speed fiber-optic networks in
cities, said it reached an agreement with its senior secured lenders
that will allow it to fund its operations while it cuts costs and
reorganizes. The New York-based company said it would shed idle data
centers or nonessential offices, reject burdensome vendor contracts
and cut jobs.</TE>
<TE>   In March, Metromedia said it planned to sell the facilities of its
Internet exchange, PAIX, for about $50 million in cash and an equity
interest in the buyer.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Verizon Wireless Inc. will unveil a flat-rate plan in June for
customers who want to surf the Web or check e-mail from mobile phones
and laptop computers as it tries to stake a claim in a new market.</LD>
<LD>   The No. 1 U.S. wireless phone company also said it will expand the
service, Express Network, to 29 more U.S. cities today and offer a
per-minute price plan to include both voice and data. With the
roll-out, the service will be accessible to about 60% of the
company's potential market.</LD>
<LD>   The Bedminster, N.J.-based firm, a joint venture of Verizon
Communications Inc. and Britain's Vodafone Group, launched Express
Network in January. The initial price plan, which cost customers an
extra $30 to use minutes from their voice plans for data, was
criticized as expensive and confusing. The $30 charge comes on top of
base rates of $35 to $150.</LD>

<HD>Juniper Networks to Buy Siemens' Unisphere Unit</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Juniper Networks Inc. will buy the Unisphere Networks Inc. unit of
Siemens for about $740 million in cash and stock in a move to expand
the telecom manufacturer's line of equipment that directs traffic on
the Web. Juniper is the No. 2 maker of equipment that directs
Internet traffic, behind the granddaddy of telecom equipment
providers, Cisco Systems Inc.</LD>
<LD>   The deal, which Juniper said will dilute earnings this year, will
help the Sunnyvale, Calif.-based company compete with Cisco, one
analyst said. It will combine Juniper's strength in network cores, or
"long-haul" long-distance lines and systems, with Unisphere's focus
on the "edge" of networks, where telecom service providers connect to
customers.</LD>
<LD>   The combined market share of the companies based on first-quarter
revenue would have been 18%, second to Cisco's 59%.</LD>
<TE>   Investors were cautious. Juniper shares fell 31 cents to $9.54 on
Nasdaq.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lenders to WorldCom Inc. founder Bernard Ebbers, who owes as much as
$408.2 million backed by his stock holdings, demanded partial
repayment and sold 17% of his stake in the No. 2 U.S. long-distance
company. WorldCom said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing
that "margin sales" since April 5 have cut Ebbers' holdings by almost
3 million WorldCom shares and by 118,991 MCI Group tracking shares
linked to WorldCom's consumer long-distance business.</LD>
<LD>   The filing didn't say who made the "margin calls," and a WorldCom
spokesman declined to comment. Brokerages or lenders may issue a
margin call to an investor when stock that was bought partially with
borrowed money, or on margin, declines below the value of the loan.
If the investor cannot pay the amount of the loan that's called, the
lender may sell the stock.</LD>
<LD>   WorldCom and Ebbers, who resigned as chairman and chief executive
last month, are under investigation by the SEC for $408.2million in
loans made or guaranteed by the company.</LD>

<HD>Teamsters OK Strike if UPS Talks Fail</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Teamsters members have authorized their leaders to call a strike if
they fail to reach an agreement with United Parcel Service Inc.,
raising the specter of a devastating walkout more than two months
before the current contract expires on July 31.</LD>
<LD>   The early strike vote, held over the weekend and announced to the
company at a contract negotiating session Monday, was meant to "get
their attention and cause them to react more seriously to our
proposals," said Ken Hall, lead negotiator for the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters. The Teamsters declined to say how many of
the 210,000 members covered by the contract cast ballots, but said
more than 90% of those who voted favored the strike authorization.</LD>
<LD>   UPS spokesman Norman Black characterized the strike vote as
"routine" and said talks have been moving along well.</LD>
<TE>   Agreements on regional supplemental contracts are close to
completion, and daily negotiations on the national master agreement
are starting this week at sessions in Chicago, he said.</TE>
<TE>   These are the first major Teamsters-UPS negotiations since 1997,
when a 15-day walkout crippled the package-delivery giant and caused
an estimated $750 million in losses.</TE>
<TE>   UPS has tried to reassure customers that it will have an agreement
this summer, and Black said only a few have sent their business
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Part-time work is a key issue in the talks. The Teamsters want
3,000 part-time jobs converted to full-time during each year of the
contract. About 58% of the union-covered workers are part-time.</TE>

<HD>Renewed Worries Propel Gold Prices</HD>
<DH>Another slump in the dollar's value against the euro and
the yen also is driving investors to the safe haven.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters and Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gold's bull market plowed ahead Monday, pushing bullion prices to
two-year highs amid renewed worries about more terrorist attacks
abroad and on U.S. soil.</LD>
<LD>   Another slump in the dollar's value against key currencies also
helped gold.</LD>
<LD>   Near-term gold futures in New York rose $5.10 to $315.70 an ounce,
highest since February 2000. Gold has risen from $279 an ounce on
Jan. 1.</LD>
<TE>   The latest rally began in Europe as the dollar drooped against the
euro and the yen, continuing the buck's recent slide. The dollar
closed at 125.36 yen in New York, down from 125.78 Friday and the
weakest since December.</TE>
<TE>   A falling dollar makes gold more attractive to safe-haven-seeking
investors outside the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "With the U.S. dollar on the ropes, at least for now, the yellow
metal should remain firm," said John Reade, metals analyst at UBS
Warburg.</TE>
<TE>   Some economists argue that global investors finally are paying
attention to the huge U.S. trade deficit, which for years has loomed
as a potential negative for the dollar's value.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, continuing terrorist attacks in the Middle East and
warnings by Bush administration officials that the U.S. remains
vulnerable to new attacks are turning more investors to gold,
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Gold's value also has been boosted this year by a surge in
Japanese demand, as the government imposed limits beginning April 1
on insurance coverage for bank time deposits.</TE>
<TE>   The change led nervous depositors to shift money to larger banks
or convert some of their savings to gold, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Demand for gold from investors in Japan will rise well over 200
metric tons this year, up from 70 tons in 2001, Newmont Mining
President Pierre Lassonde said last week.</TE>
<TE>   Gold mining shares have soared this year with bullion's price, and
rallied again Monday. Newmont Mining rose 69 cents to $30.14,
Goldcorp rocketed $2 to $21 and Agnico Eagle gained 48 cents to
$15.93.</TE>
<TE>   Silver prices rose with gold Monday. Near-term silver futures in
New York jumped 11.4 cents to $4.77 an ounce, a 52-week high.</TE>

<HD>Investment Banks Win Delay in IPO Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Credit Suisse First Boston Inc. and about
40 other investment banks won a bid Monday to delay the surrender of
documents to investors suing over stock offerings of Internet and
software start-ups the banks took public in the late 1990s. Investors
had asked the judge presiding over a barrage of
initial-public-offering lawsuits to order the defendants to turn over
internal documents. But U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin in New
York denied the request. She said federal securities law requires
halting pre-trial discovery until after a judge rules on a request to
dismiss a suit.</LD>
<LD>   The investment banks are expected to make a request for blanket
dismissal soon.</LD>
<LD>   The judge said the investment banks will be allowed first "to
test" whether investors have a viable claim before incurring "the
burden and expense" of discovery.</LD>
<TE>   Investors claim the banks rigged IPOs of 310 companies from 1998
to 2000 to benefit themselves and key clients.</TE>

<LD>New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer said he is working "vigorously"
with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. to settle allegations that the company
misled investors with biased stock research. In an interview with
CNBC on Monday, Spitzer said he is optimistic a settlement can be
reached, though the two sides have faced "substantial" disagreements
in talks over the last three weeks. He declined to be specific.
Spitzer launched his case against Merrill in April.</LD>

<HD>Blake Aide Gets Outside Counsel</HD>
<DH>Court: Judge appoints a lawyer to advise the bodyguard on
letting the actor pay his legal fees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles judge appointed a lawyer Monday to advise Robert
Blake's co-defendant about potential problems with allowing the actor
to pay his legal fees.</LD>
<LD>   Over defense objections, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge
Lloyd M. Nash named attorney Steven D. Sitkoff as an independent
counsel for Blake's bodyguard, Earle Caldwell.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors had asked Nash to remove Caldwell's attorney, Arna H.
Zlotnik, because her financial relationship with Blake "undermines
her independence of judgment and casts doubt on the integrity of all
proceedings against her client." Blake is paying Zlotnik, and he
posted $1-million bail for Caldwell, who filed a document last week
asking Nash to permit Zlotnik to represent him.</LD>
<TE>   Blake, 68, and Caldwell, 46, were arrested last month and charged
in the 2001 fatal shooting of Blake's wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, 44,
outside a Studio City restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities allege that Blake shot Bakley. He has been charged
with murder, two counts of soliciting someone to kill her and
conspiracy. Caldwell, who has been charged with conspiracy, is
accused of helping Blake prepare for the slaying. If convicted, both
men face life in prison. They have pleaded not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   Nash said he was reluctant to take Zlotnik off the case. He said
he wanted a court-appointed lawyer to meet with Caldwell before he
makes his decision.</TE>
<TE>   Zlotnik objected to the judge appointing Sitkoff to advise
Caldwell, but she did not offer any reason.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Stephen Yagman, who said in court that he represents
Caldwell and Zlotnik, said he will ask Nash to assign someone else to
advise Caldwell.</TE>
<TE>   In court, Nash also warned Blake's attorney, Harland W. Braun,
about "mudslinging" inside the Van Nuys courtroom. "I want everyone
to be civil in this case," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He also denied a motion to stop Braun from employing a private
investigator who prosecutors say is a witness in their case against
Blake, best known for his role on the 1970s television series
"Baretta."</TE>
<TE>   Nash said that on June 18 he will consider another bail motion for
Blake, who is being held without bail at the Men's Central Jail in
downtown Los Angeles. The judge denied a similar motion earlier this
month.</TE>
<TE>   Braun has asked Nash to release Blake on $1-million bail, with the
condition that the actor wear an electronic anklet so authorities can
monitor his whereabouts.</TE>
<TE>   Braun accused prosecutors of alleging the special circumstance
that Blake was lying in wait for Bakley solely to keep his client
held without bail.</TE>

<HD>His Brother Is Immigrants' Keeper</HD>
<DH>Activism: Rep. Duncan Hunter is working to secure the
U.S.-Mexican border. John Hunter is attempting to save the lives of
those who sneak across the boundary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>YUHA DESERT, Calif.</DL>
<LD>If there's any local official who can take credit for the layers of
steel fencing dividing the hills of Tijuana from San Diego, it's Rep.
Duncan Hunter. The conservative congressman has focused a large
portion of his 22-year career on trying to seal the border with
Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   The imposing fences have thwarted many undocumented migrants, but
they have also pushed the flow of illegal immigration east to the
deserts and mountains of Imperial County. In this rugged land, more
than 400 migrants in the last seven years have succumbed to
suffocating heat, bone-chilling cold and other dangers.</LD>
<LD>   To human rights activists and immigration advocates, the deaths
are proof that the border crackdown promoted by Hunter and other
officials is misguided and inhumane.</LD>
<TE>   So it has been a seemingly incongruous and surprising turn of
events that has delivered the activists a new ally--John Hunter, the
Republican congressman's brother.</TE>
<TE>   Disturbed by the border crackdown's human toll, the younger Hunter
began lugging gallon jugs of water out to the desert two years ago,
hoping they would be found in time by desperate immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Today, his Water Station project has turned into a weekly spring
and summer ritual that draws as many as 100 volunteers. And John
Hunter's brother has become one of the project's strongest
supporters. The congressman even helped get permits to set up the aid
stations on federal land.</TE>
<TE>   To some human rights advocates, Duncan Hunter's endorsement of the
border aid program is a strange anomaly from the man they blame for
helping make crossings more dangerous in the first place. The
congressman considers his actions all of a piece: A fortified border,
he says, need not be a deadly one.</TE>
<TE>   John Hunter tries to stay out of the politics. Although it took
him some time to convince skeptics that his relief efforts are
sincere, the younger Hunter said all he wants to do is stop people
from dying.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very ironic situation," said Enrique Morones, a former
executive of the San Diego Padres, who helps run the Water Station
project. "His brother is putting up a wall. And he's saving the lives
of people trying to cross in the most dangerous areas, because of
that wall."</TE>
<TE>   Those who know the Hunter brothers said that, although the
impulses that drive them appear to be at odds, both have something in
common.</TE>
<TE>   "Both Duncan and John are very public-spirited," said state
Assemblyman Juan Vargas (D-San Diego), who has volunteered on John's
project. "They just took very different approaches on this one. It's
like the yin and the yang."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The brothers grew up on a ranch outside Riverside, along with
three other siblings, children of a housing developer who was active
in local Republican politics. Despite their eight-year age
difference, the two were good friends who hunted and did chores
together.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan went from a stint in the Army in Vietnam to law school and
then to legal aid work in San Diego's working-class Barrio Logan.
Once in Congress, he joined a cadre of young legislators rallying
around Newt Gingrich.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, John spent a year in the West Texas desert prospecting
for uranium after college before earning a doctorate in particle
physics and working on satellite technology at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory. Now, he's a toy inventor.</TE>
<TE>   The younger Hunter described himself as a "George Bush kind of
conservative" who is largely apolitical, other than some
door-knocking for his brother Duncan in 1980. Calling himself the
"classic" distracted scientist, John Hunter said he didn't think much
about border issues until he began reading about the number of
immigrants dying in Imperial County. He was horrified.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody was doing anything," said the 46-year-old, who lives north
of San Diego in Poway. "If they were registered voters, everyone and
their mothers would be out saving them."</TE>
<TE>   John told Duncan about his plan to set up water stations in the
desert, and the congressman helped secure permits from the Bureau of
Land Management.</TE>
<TE>   "When people are dying of thirst in the desert, you don't step
over their bodies," Duncan Hunter, 54, said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   The congressman said there is nothing contradictory about his
support for saving immigrants and his pursuit of stronger border
enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   "The best service you can do for border security and for would-be
illegal immigrants is to stop them at the border before they travel
into this very harsh desert environment," he said.</TE>
<TE>   John has mixed feelings about the border fencing, saying it has
helped keep out drug dealers and smugglers. But at the same time, the
measure has exacted a severe human cost, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to put up a Berlin Wall next to Mexico," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Their differences have led to some interesting discussions at
family gatherings, both said. But neither brother likes to talk
publicly about where he parts views with the other.</TE>
<TE>   "Duncan's a great brother," John said.</TE>
<TE>   "John is a very big-hearted person," Duncan said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On a recent May morning, John Hunter bumped south down Highway 98
in a pickup, the Yuha Desert desert rolling before him.</TE>
<TE>   Heat descends with a force in this barren borderland, blanching
the sky white along the horizon. Ocotillo bushes dot the desert
floor, their straggly arms stretching out like the bones of
scarecrows.</TE>
<TE>   In the back of his pickup, Hunter carries a rolled-up map marked
with colored lines indicating where migrants have died. Orange
signifies a death by heat exposure; blue is a drowning in the
All-American Canal that runs along the border; yellow represents
deaths from unknown causes. The map is speckled with color.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at this desert. It's killed a huge number of people," he
said. "To me, I consider it like a serial murderer."</TE>
<TE>   As the temperature rose, Hunter and a handful of volunteers
trudged out onto the sand and filled cardboard boxes marked "AGUA"
with one-gallon jugs of water. Over the boxes, they raised flags on
tall poles, the large blue cloths standing out like beacons against
the distant, dun-colored hills.</TE>
<TE>   The first year, he and his four children and a nephew set up 70
aid stations around the desert. This year, Hunter hopes to erect 300
water stations before the hot season, when temperatures can climb to
120 degrees. Every weekend, he will make the journey to the desert to
refill the boxes with water.</TE>
<TE>   The work can be awkward, as it throws him together with activists
who have outspokenly criticized his brother's politics. They know he
does not share their condemnation of the border crackdown, and steer
clear of the subject.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think he sees the overall picture, but I respect what
he's trying to do," said Roberto Martinez, the longtime leader of the
American Friends Service Committee, a Quaker social action
organization. "If he can save one life, more power to him."</TE>
<TE>   Hunter becomes uncomfortable when the conversation turns to
questions of the congressman's policies.</TE>
<TE>   The officials who erected the fencing did not intend to encourage
immigrants to attempt the often-deadly journey to the east, he said.
"I'm confident that they didn't foresee what would happen."</TE>
<TE>   As for Duncan, "he knows how I feel, and I think he's helped me
enough that we don't argue the fine points," he added. "Rather than
cast blame, let's just move forward."</TE>
<TE>   John saves his ire for officials who know about deaths but still
do nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "The ones I really don't get along with are those who hate these
people for crossing," he said as his pickup rumbled south. "No one
really owns the Earth. It belongs to everyone. We have to abide by
the law. I believe in a strong border. But people have to come
first."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Known for his hawkish views and blunt manner, Duncan Hunter has
made policing the U.S.-Mexico boundary one of the central
preoccupations of his congressional career. His Web site features a
13-page chronology of his efforts to secure the border.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, has
proposed stationing troops along the international line. On his
suggestion, the National Guard strung together corrugated steel mats
to replace the chain-link fence dividing the countries along parts of
the border.</TE>
<TE>   He has lobbied to double the number of Border Patrol agents
nationwide to 20,000 and has pushed to construct a "triple fence"
along the 14-mile westernmost stretch of border to keep out drug
traffickers and illegal immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   After some modifications, a pilot project began in 1997 in San
Diego, where a 16-foot-tall secondary steel fence was erected.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell you, the fence was derided by a lot of folks, but it's
been good for law enforcement on both sides," said Hunter, who lives
in Alpine, a suburb east of San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   The congressman's stances have led some to label him xenophobic
and evoked comparisons with Pat Buchanan. That reputation was on the
minds of wary activists when they first heard about his brother's
project.</TE>
<TE>   El Centro resident Roberto Rubio was so suspicious of John
Hunter's intentions that he originally joined Water Station as a spy,
worried the aid stations were traps.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'This guy needs to be watched, because he's Duncan's
brother,'" Rubio said. But before long, he said, he realized Hunter
was sincere and now he is one of the project's most ardent
supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Morones, the former vice president with the Padres baseball team,
was so taken with Hunter's single-handed attempt to save lives that
he has agreed to become president of the project.</TE>
<TE>   "At first, I didn't know what to think of him," Morones said. "As
I got to know him, I was impressed. Here's a guy who rolls up his
sleeves and does something."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Hunter and Morones expanded the aid stations to the
winter, setting out emergency cold weather kits, with clothes and
food, in the mountains. They are working on a Web site that will
contain information and stories about migrants who have died, and
billboards along the border warning people about the dangers of
crossing.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter wants to prevent the frequent drownings in the All-American
Canal, a polluted waterway that hews along the border. In the last
seven years, 168 migrants have drowned trying to cross the
swift-moving waters, according to statistics kept by the Mexican
Consulate in Calexico.</TE>
<TE>   John Hunter thought he had a perfect solution: stringing up ropes
and buoys across the canal to be used as lifelines.</TE>
<TE>   But the five-member board of the Imperial Irrigation District
argued the lines would cause more deaths by encouraging people to
cross. They rejected the proposal last year.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter said he's not discouraged. And he has someone on his side:
His brother Duncan agrees that the ropes could help save lives.</TE>
<TE>   And if the lifelines don't fly, the congressman has another idea:
"We can always fence the canal."</TE>

<HD>Tustin Teen in Coma After Overdose on Prom Night</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Tustin teen was in a coma Monday after overdosing on the popular
drug Ecstasy on her prom night, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Police could not confirm the name of the 18-year-old Foothill High
School student, who they said lost consciousness about 5:40 a.m.
Sunday at the Embassy Suites Hotel in Santa Ana.</LD>
<LD>   "Apparently she told somebody that she had taken Ecstasy earlier
in the evening," said Sgt. Gene McManus, a spokesman for the Santa
Ana Police Department.</LD>
<TE>   "She became sick, went unconscious and her friends called police,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The young woman was taken to Western Medical Center-Santa Ana,
where she was reported comatose and in serious condition late Monday
night, McManus said.</TE>
<TE>   Friends said she had gone to the prom Saturday night at Joe's
Garage in Tustin.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like any other school dance," said Daniel Morrison, 18,
who also attended. "I'm sure she was sober there. They had lots of
security before you went in--you had to shake hands with the
principal."</TE>
<TE>   Monday at school, Morrison said, there was little discussion of
the incident. "They should definitely make a big deal out of it," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Doctor Describes Detainment in Israel</HD>
<DH>Homecoming: Riad Abdelkarim says he was interrogated for 10
hours at a time but never charged. Officials say he was suspected of
funding terrorism.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Calling his experience a "nightmare," an Anaheim doctor released from
Israel after a two-week detention on suspicion of terrorist activity
returned Monday to an all-American homecoming of fluttering flags and
his favorite burger--a "double-double" from In-N-Out.</LD>
<LD>   At an exuberant welcome of about 70 family members and friends at
John Wayne Airport in Orange County, Riad Abdelkarim clutched his
youngest son, Omar, and expressed gratitude for his American freedoms
and thanked God and his family for helping him endure his ordeal.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm happy and proud to be a citizen of this great nation," said
Abdelkarim, looking gaunt and fatigued, at a packed airport news
conference. "It's great to be home. It's great to be free."</LD>
<TE>   Later, in an interview, the 34-year-old Santa Monica native said
he was never formally charged with any crimes nor shown any evidence
of wrongdoing during his detention in what he described as a
cockroach-infested jail in a Tel Aviv suburb. He called the detention
"an attempt to sabotage any humanitarian efforts on behalf of
Palestinian civilians in the occupied territories."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials have largely declined to comment on his case but
told Israeli newspapers last week that he was suspected of possibly
funding "terror attacks." Abdelkarim was a member for one year of the
board of directors of the Holy Land Foundation, an Islamic charity
outlawed by Israel and the United States on charges that it funded
the Hamas militant group. The foundation denies the charges of
terrorist activity and is suing the U.S. government for freezing its
funds.</TE>
<TE>   David Douek, a spokesman at the Israeli consulate in Los Angeles,
said he had no information about Abdelkarim's case but did say, "We
don't hold people without just cause." He also called "baseless"
accusations that Israel is blocking humanitarian aid to Palestinian
civilians, saying the Jewish state had delivered more than 6,000 tons
of milk and flour to them even after the Passover suicide bombings
inflamed the Israeli public.</TE>
<TE>   Abdelkarim's detention rallied American Muslims nationally and
drew gestures of help from people ranging from Sen. Dianne Feinstein
(D-Calif.) to Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) to the Rev.
Jesse Jackson, who offered to travel to Israel to seek the doctor's
release. His case sparked calls for U.S. investigations into Israeli
treatment of the six to 12 American aid workers from Illinois, Ohio,
Wisconsin and other states believed to be under Israeli detention,
according to Salam Al-Marayati of the Muslim Public Affairs Council
in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   A news conference of several American aid workers previously
detained in Israel is scheduled today. Several international
organizations, including the International Red Cross, have charged
Israel with shooting at aid workers, blocking doctors from treating
the wounded and other acts.</TE>
<TE>   Abdelkarim was sent to Israel by the International Medical Corps,
a Los Angeles-based global humanitarian organization, to assess
medical needs in the Palestinian territories. Among other things, he
said, he visited Bethlehem and Beit Jala to interview local medical
experts on the impact of the violence on children.</TE>
<TE>   Abdelkarim was detained May 5 as he attempted to board a flight
home. Another American aid worker, Dalell Mohmed of Dallas, was also
detained and released last week after eight days of near-solitary
confinement.</TE>
<TE>   During days of interrogations that lasted as long as 10 hours,
Abdelkarim said, Israeli security police repeatedly threw out
accusations "like a mantra" that he had helped fund suicide bombers
and terrorists. But Abdelkarim said the interrogators did not
particularly dwell on his relationship with the Holy Land Foundation.
Nor did interrogators focus on International Medical Corps or
KinderUSA, a new charity he and others founded to help Palestinian
children after U.S. authorities shut down Holy Land.</TE>
<TE>   "They were on a fishing expedition," he said. "They wanted to
bully and intimidate nascent American relief organizations."</TE>
<TE>   Abdelkarim said he was not physically mistreated. In her own news
conference last week, Mohmed said she believed he was being tortured
because she heard him scream out in the next room, "Stop! Stop this
now!" But the doctor said he had lost patience with interrogators for
accusing him of giving money to families of Palestinian suicide
bombers and yelled at them to stop.</TE>
<TE>   He said he was kept in a small room with eight to 13 other men for
part of the time and was moved to what he called a "dungeon"--a gray
room with no windows and poor ventilation--after he complained about
his room to his attorney and U.S. consular officials. Food consisted
of cucumbers, boiled eggs, bread, occasional chicken and yogurt, but
Abdelkarim said he went on a hunger strike after the first few days.</TE>
<TE>   Although he signed an expulsion order that will bar him from
returning to Israel, Abdelkarim said he told his Israeli guards that
he hopes to return someday after a just peace between Israelis and
Palestinians is achieved.</TE>
<TE>   After taking some time off to with his wife, Wijdan, and their
four children, Abdelkarim said he wants to "get back to doing what I
do best--taking care of my patients."</TE>

<HD>4 Bald Eaglets Returned to the Channel Islands</HD>
<DH>Nature: Biologists hope the birds, which will be kept in
nesting boxes for a month, will make the park their home and drive
off nonnative golden eagles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fifty years after pollution drove them off, bald eagles were returned
to Channel Islands National Park on Monday, marking the first step in
a five-year effort to restore the powerful predators to the
sanctuary.</LD>
<LD>   The four eaglets, with their 9-foot wingspans and enormous yellow
talons, shivered as they were carried up a ladder in driving rain and
placed in locked nesting boxes on Santa Cruz Island. They flapped and
squawked before gazing out at the dramatic seascapes, jagged
mountains and hidden coves that biologists hope will be their new
home.</LD>
<LD>   A month from now, when the birds can fly, the boxes will be opened
and they will be released.</LD>
<TE>   "Returning bald eagles to the Channel Islands is the ecological
equivalent to restoring wolves to Yellowstone Park," said park Supt.
Tim Setnicka. "It's that significant."</TE>
<TE>   Scientists and park officials hope the bald eagles, which left the
islands after DDT poisoning thinned their eggshells, will again
dominate the sky, driving off the golden eagles that eat the island
foxes. The foxes have been penned for their safety and won't be
released until the golden eagles are gone.</TE>
<TE>   The project's funding comes from a $140-million settlement reached
in 2000 between the government and the Montrose Chemical Corp. and
other companies. The businesses were accused of dumping millions of
pounds of toxic DDT and PCBs into the ocean near Los Angeles from
1947 until 1972. The chemicals poisoned fish, mammals and birds such
as the bald eagle. Wildlife agencies, which say 110 tons of the
poisons remain in the ocean, are using $30 million of the settlement
to restore what was lost.</TE>
<TE>   The 8-week-old eaglets, which came from the San Francisco Zoo,
will be monitored with cameras in their nest boxes and with satellite
transmitters attached to their bodies.</TE>
<TE>   They will be fed pig carcasses for a month after their release to
keep them healthy until they can hunt their own food.</TE>
<TE>   "When they are released there will be some mistakes made," said
David Garcelon, president of the Institute for Wildlife Studies in
Arcata, which monitors and helps manage the eagles. "Landing is a
tough thing to learn how to do. And it takes about a year before they
can take fish from the water surface."</TE>
<TE>   The eaglets' perch on an 800-foot hill overlooking Chinese Harbor
will get the updrafts needed when they decide to fly.</TE>
<TE>   "They will grow from something young and gawky, and in four weeks
they will be dominating the skies," Garcelon said.</TE>
<TE>   That's what park officials are banking on.</TE>
<TE>   When the bald eagle disappeared half a century ago, the vacuum was
filled by the golden eagle, a voracious hunter that arrived in the
late 1980s. The eagles, which are not native to the islands, fed on
the thousands of feral pigs and a handful of island foxes. Plans are
now underway to fence in the pigs and shoot them next year. The park
hopes eliminating the food source and restoring bald eagles--which do
not feed on foxes--will rid the islands of the golden eagles.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a system out of balance because of nonnative species,"
Setnicka said. "This restoration ecology is like medicine was at the
turn of the century, and we are still groping in the dark."</TE>
<TE>   No one knows if the new bald eagles will hunt, breed or even stay
on the islands. There is also no guarantee that any of their eggs
will hatch.</TE>
<TE>   In 1980, bald eagles were restored to Santa Catalina Island but
the effects of the DDT have lingered, with only 30% of the eggs laid
actually hatching into chicks. Catalina now has 20 bald eagles and
four breeding pairs, biologists said.</TE>
<TE>   Biologist Jessica Dooley will monitor the eaglets on the
65,000-acre Santa Cruz Island, the largest in the Channel Islands
chain.</TE>
<TE>   "Once they begin to fly, it's a critical time," she said. "They
will need to find food."</TE>
<TE>   Dooley carried the eagles up a slippery 15-foot ladder to their
boxes. She put two birds in each of the large nests made of logs and
straw. The raptors glared and occasionally hissed at the humans
surrounding them.</TE>
<TE>   The wind blew cold rain through the metal bars of the box. The
eaglets shielded themselves with their big black wings. Because they
are young, their heads don't have the signature white feathers that
characterize adult bald eagles.</TE>
<TE>   Garcelon looked up at the blocky tower with its boxes and sweeping
vistas of mountain ridges and deep blue ocean.</TE>
<TE>   "There is probably nothing more rewarding than returning a species
to its habitat," he said, "And returning eagles to their former
grandeur."</TE>

<HD>Severance Pay OKd for El Toro Planner</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The end of Orange County's eight-year effort to build an airport at
El Toro became official Monday when supervisors approved a severance
package for program manager Gary Simon, who will leave his post June
6.</LD>
<LD>   The Board of Supervisors eliminated the El Toro office and Simon's
position last month and put the program under County Executive
Officer Michael Schumacher.</LD>
<LD>   The board decided against letting Simon continue planning for an
airport after a county measure approved by voters in March changed
the zoning to that of a park and other development. Irvine wants to
annex the former Marine base and control its redevelopment.</LD>
<TE>   Under a plan approved unanimously Monday by the board, with
Supervisor Jim Silva absent, Simon will leave the $182,000-a-year job
he has held since January 2001 with the same severance package as if
he had been fired. Simon will receive seven months' pay, about
$106,000.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors agreed that they had voided Simon's contract by
eliminating his job.</TE>
<TE>   The board discussed Simon's departure last week but delayed a
final vote after Supervisor Todd Spitzer protested a portion of a
resolution that praised Simon's job performance. The language
ultimately approved states simply that Simon will leave the county.</TE>
<TE>   "Gary's departure signifies the final chapter to the El Toro story
from the county's perspective," Spitzer said Monday. "There is now no
pro-airport figurehead to be identified with this losing battle."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Chuck Smith, who supported an airport, said that Simon,
a builder of other large projects, was hired to build an airport, a
job that voters eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no point in him sticking around," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't reflect on him at all. I think Gary's done an
outstanding job. We part very good friends. It's unfortunate he had
to spend more time with the politics."</TE>
<TE>   Simon oversaw an agency of 29 employees, most of whom found jobs
elsewhere in Orange County government. Last year, the office's budget
was $11.8 million.</TE>

<HD>John Gorton, 90; Australian Leader</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Australian Prime Minister Sir John Gorton, a war hero and
maverick conservative who voted himself out of office, has died at
age 90.</LD>
<LD>   Gorton died Sunday of pneumonia and respiratory failure in a
Sydney hospice.</LD>
<LD>   Almost everything about Gorton and his term as prime minister from
1968 to 1971 was unconventional.</LD>
<TE>   "Sir John was fearless in the expression of his views and honest
and forthright in his dealings," said Lynton Crosby, federal
secretary of Gorton's conservative Liberal Party. "He was both a
great Liberal and a great prime minister."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Melbourne on Sept. 9, 1911, Gorton was the second child
born out of wedlock to John Gorton, a British businessman who made
his fortune in South Africa.</TE>
<TE>   After their mother died, Gorton's father moved the children in
with his legal wife in Sydney, where Gorton was educated at private
schools before studying at Oxford University in England. His first
marriage was to an American, Bettina Brown, who died in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, he joined the Royal Australian Air Force and
served in Britain, Malaysia and Papua New Guinea. He was shot down
twice by the Japanese and suffered severe facial injuries that left
him scarred for life.</TE>
<TE>   Gorton was elected to the Senate in 1949, promoted to the Cabinet
in 1958 and served as government leader in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Often called "the accidental prime minister," Gorton became leader
of the country and the Liberal Party on Jan. 10, 1968, a month after
Prime Minister Harold Holt mysteriously disappeared while swimming at
a Melbourne beach.</TE>
<TE>   Gorton's breezy style made him popular with voters but also made
him some powerful enemies, including members of his own party and the
government bureaucracy, as well as Australia's most powerful media
baron, Sir Frank Packer.</TE>
<TE>   "He was bold, uncompromising, sometimes impetuous, but he was
never afraid. He did things his way," said Tony Eggleton, a former
federal secretary of the party.</TE>
<TE>   That familiar appraisal was incorporated into the title of an
authorized biography, "John Gorton: He Did It His Way," written by
Ian Hancock and published in March. The book emerged at a time when
the Liberal Party seemed interested in rehabilitating Gorton's
standing in history.</TE>
<TE>   Hancock attributed part of Gorton's unpopularity to bad
timing--that he was prime minister during a period between those of
two charismatic titans, Robert Menzies and Gough Whitlam.</TE>
<TE>   Gorton's womanizing--he admitted in the biography to at least one
extramarital affair while prime minister--and drinking binges may
have made him popular with the populace, but not with politicians.</TE>
<TE>   His reputation among conservatives also suffered from repeated
conflict with the United States over its refusal to share information
about the Vietnam War, to which Australia committed more than 50,000
troops.</TE>
<TE>   In 1971, Defense Minister Malcolm Fraser, a future prime minister,
resigned in disgust at Gorton's leadership, sparking a challenge.
When the ballot among Liberal lawmakers split 33 to 33, Gorton used
his ballot to vote himself out of the party leadership and prime
minister's office. He retired from Parliament in 1975 and later
became a patron of the movement to legalize marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   Gorton's family has accepted an offer of a state funeral. The date
has not been determined. He is survived by his second wife, Nancy;
three children; 12 grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.</TE>

<LD>Stephen Jay Gould, an influential evolutionary biologist, prolific
essayist and passionate New York Yankees fan, died Monday of cancer
at his home in New York City.</LD>
<LD>   Unfailingly witty, frequently controversial and occasionally
combative, Gould, 60, was one of the best-known scientists of his
generation. For many, he became the public face of science--a quick
sketch of heavy-lidded eyes and a knowing half-smile separated by a
thick, brush mustache.</LD>
<LD>   A professor of zoology at Harvard University and biology at New
York University, Gould used his academic bully pulpit to champion
understanding of science in issues large and small. He was a
best-selling author whose 22 books most often sought to make complex
debates about geology, paleontology and evolutionary biology
accessible to as many as possible.</LD>
<TE>   "The Mismeasure of Man," a critical study of intelligence testing,
won the National Book Critics Award in 1982.</TE>
<TE>   A 1989 book, "Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of
History," used the example of the Burgess Shale, a small fossil area
in British Columbia, to support his theory that humans are little
more than an accident of nature. It became a national bestseller
within weeks of its release and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize
in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   And this spring, Harvard University Press published what almost
certainly was the culmination of his life's scholarly work--a
1,433-page tome that Gould labored on for 20 years that seeks nothing
less than to reformulate Darwin's theory of evolution.</TE>
<TE>   In scores of essays, Gould expounded authoritatively on a variety
of topics, including religion, the fallacies of racial biology,
Gilbert and Sullivan, and the demise of the .400 hitter. "This View
of Life," his monthly column in Natural History magazine for which he
wrote 300 essays, won the National Magazine Award for Essays and
Criticism in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   "Steve Gould always seemed larger than life. His ideas, powerful
and commonly controversial, inspired PhD theses for three decades,"
said Harvard colleague Andrew Knoll, a natural history professor in
the university's department of molecular and cellular biology.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure he ever thought a small thought in his life."</TE>
<TE>   Gould was best known in scientific circles for the theory of
punctuated equilibrium that he proposed with his colleague Niles
Eldredge of the American Museum of Natural History in 1972.</TE>
<TE>   In a series of controversial papers, Gould and Eldredge took issue
with the Darwinian view that all life evolved slowly and
incrementally over a long stretch of time from simple, common
ancestral forms. Instead, using examples from the fossil record, they
suggested that species experience long periods of slow and gradual
evolution that may be interrupted by the abrupt emergence of new
forms--punctuated rather than gradual change.</TE>
<TE>   "Gradualism is more a product of Western thought than a fact of
nature," Gould wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "He really changed the field of paleontology from the
stamp-collecting type of science where you just catalog fossils,"
said Michael Shermer, director of the Skeptic Society, an
organization that Gould helped start that aimed to rebut
pseudoscience.</TE>
<TE>   The most dramatic piece of evidence suggesting that other forces
contribute to evolutionary change, Gould would often say, was the
discovery that the extinction of the dinosaurs was caused by a giant
meteor striking the Earth, resulting in global dust clouds that
interrupted environmental cycles and caused many life forms to die
out.</TE>
<TE>   Even as he championed Darwin, however, Gould thought that the
theory of evolution left something to be desired.</TE>
<TE>   With characteristic panache, Gould wrote in his recently published
book that "nothing of Darwin's central logic has faded or fully
capsized, but his theory has been transformed, along his original
lines, into something far different, far richer, and far more
adequate to guide our understanding of nature."</TE>
<TE>   When Gould was first diagnosed with cancer in 1982, he believed
that he had "almost zero chance of finishing" the book. He beat back
the disease with surgery and chemotherapy.</TE>
<TE>   "Stephen Jay Gould was a giant in his field," said National
Science Foundation Director Rita Colwell. "He was sort of a
latter-day Darwin. He put together massive amounts of material in a
way that relationships were pulled out that weren't obvious" unless
one had a mind of equal caliber.</TE>
<TE>   Although Gould was open to new ideas, she said, "he was a prickly
sort of fellow. He didn't tolerate shoddy science."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Gould was for decades at the center of debates over the
theory of evolution. He was, in particular, a fierce public opponent
of creationism.</TE>
<TE>   "The rise of creationism," he wrote in a 1981 essay, "is politics,
pure and simple."</TE>
<TE>   He attracted many critics over the years. Some accused Gould, the
son of a Marxist, of having an underlying political agenda. They
argued that Gould embraced the idea of punctuated equilibrium only
because Marxism requires revolutionary change--a charge that Gould
always called absurd.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics, such as pioneering British evolutionist John Maynard
Smith, writing in the New York Review of Books, suggested that Gould
was simply foolish, "a man whose ideas are so confused as to be
hardly worth bothering with."</TE>
<TE>   Still others dismissed the sometimes arrogant Gould as a
simple-minded popularizer of science. Gould turned such attacks into
compliments.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything, even the conceptually most complex material, can be
written for general audiences without any dumbing down," he said in a
recent interview in Mother Jones magazine. "This goes back to
Galileo, who wrote his great books as dialogues in Italian, not as
treatises in Latin. And to Darwin, who wrote 'The Origin of Species'
for general readers.... So what I'm doing is part of a great
humanistic tradition."</TE>
<TE>   Gould began as an enfant terrible of paleontology and ended his
life as a senior statesman of science. At his death, he had just
completed a term as president of the American Assn. for the
Advancement of Science, the world's largest general scientific
society.</TE>
<TE>   Born in New York City on Sept. 10, 1941, Gould was always a
Yankees fan, especially enamored of Joe DiMaggio.</TE>
<TE>   But it was not until he turned 5 that a visit to the American
Museum of Natural History with his father kindled his interest in
science. The young Gould was riveted by his first glimpse of the
reconstructed skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus rex.</TE>
<TE>   "As we stood in front of the beast," he wrote in his essay "The
Telltale Wishbone," "a man sneezed; I gulped and prepared to utter my
Shema Yisrael. But the great animal stood immobile in all its bony
grandeur, and as we left, I announced that I would be a
paleontologist when I grew up."</TE>
<TE>   His parents helped him look for dinosaur bones and marine fossils.</TE>
<TE>   By age 11 he had read G.G. Simpson's "The Meaning of Evolution,"
and Charles Darwin had become his hero. Though his high school
curriculum gave scarcely a nod to the topic--the teaching of
evolution in most American schools had been in disfavor since the
Scopes trial of 1925--Gould found it so exciting that he studied it
on his own.</TE>
<TE>   He credited his dedicated teachers at Antioch College, where he
earned a bachelor's degree in 1963, with developing his sense of
himself as a scientist and teacher.</TE>
<TE>   He went on to Columbia University, where he wrote his doctoral
dissertation on the fossil land snails of Bermuda.</TE>
<TE>   He earned a doctoral degree in paleontology in 1967 and became an
assistant professor of geology at Harvard, advancing to associate
professor in 1971 and professor in 1973. He became one of the
faculty's superstars, leading hugely popular undergraduate courses in
geology, biology and the history of science.</TE>
<TE>   Although his cancer was in remission for many years, in late
February 2000, doctors discovered several tumors in his brain and
lungs and on his liver, Shermer said. Gould recovered from brain
surgery on April 1 to return to his course at Harvard on April 5. But
while preparing for lung surgery, doctors decided that the cancer had
spread too far.</TE>
<TE>   Gould returned to New York City on May 13, where he was born, and
entered a hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "He always said he was a New York boy, born and bred," Shermer
said. "He was always a visitor in Boston."</TE>
<TE>   The scientist is survived by his wife, sculptor Rhonda Roland
Shearer; his mother, Eleanor Gould; his first wife, Deborah Lee; and
their two sons, Ethan and Jesse.</TE>

<HD>Joseph Limprecht, 55; Ambassador to Albania</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joseph Limprecht, a foreign service officer who had served as
ambassador to Albania since 1999, has died of a heart attack while
touring northern Albania. He was 55.</LD>
<LD>   The Associated Press quoted Albanian officials as saying that
three medical teams were rushed to the area, but the ambassador died
Sunday before he could be taken to a hospital. The U.S. Embassy in
Tirana confirmed Limprecht's death.</LD>
<LD>   Albanian President Rexhep Meidani said his country had lost a
"great friend."</LD>
<TE>   "His last tour to several towns in the north of the country is
significant evidence of his serious and professional commitment,"
Meidani said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Limprecht, a fifth-generation Nebraskan, was a native of Omaha.
The graduate of the University of Chicago received a master's degree
from Harvard University and a doctorate in history from UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   He began his State Department career in 1975, and was stationed in
Washington and Bonn before serving as public safety advisor at the
U.S. mission in Berlin from 1985 to 1988. He then served until 1991
in Islamabad, Pakistan, where he directed anti-narcotics operations.</TE>
<TE>   The diplomat spent tours in Washington, D.C., as deputy director
of the Office of Israel and Arab-Israeli Affairs and as a division
chief in the State Department's personnel bureau.</TE>
<TE>   From 1996 until becoming ambassador in 1999, he was deputy chief
of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Tashkent, Uzbekistan.</TE>
<TE>   In Albania, Limprecht worked with a country that had become
plagued by government corruption and organized crime. The Omaha
World-Herald reported that when he traveled from the embassy
compound, it was in a 6-ton armored vehicle, with three guards armed
with automatic weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Limprecht had been due to end his three-year tour in Albania,
where he had helped mediate disputes by various political factions
and worked to end strife.</TE>
<TE>   Former Albanian President Sali Berisha said, "The United States
lost a talented diplomat and Albania a distinguished friend who
worked with great efficiency to foster the relations between the two
countries and peoples."</TE>
<TE>   Limprecht, who spoke German and Uzbek, had contributed articles to
such publications as the Harvard Business Review and Foreign Service
Journal.</TE>
<TE>   He received two State Department Superior Honor awards and a State
Department Meritorious Honor Award.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors include his wife, Nancy, and two daughters.</TE>

<HD>Erin Brockovich Testifies Boss Was 'Gentleman'</HD>
<DH>Courts: Masry is accused of firing an employee for refusing
sexual advances. He says he fired her because she lied about her
credentials.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WENDY THERMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Erin Brockovich staunchly defended her boss, Ed Masry, as a "perfect
gentleman" as testimony continued Monday in a sexual harassment
lawsuit brought against him by a former employee.</LD>
<LD>   The lawyer for plaintiff Kissandra Cohen suggested that Brockovich
has a peculiar notion of sexual harassment and is trying to protect
the man who helped make her famous in the movie named for her. Lawyer
Dan Marino questioned Brockovich repeatedly about what she wore to
the office, showing the jury published photos of her.</LD>
<LD>   "I have worn low-cut blouses, yes," Brockovich testified. But she
denied using suggestive clothing to get ahead in her career.</LD>
<TE>   Referring to Masry, the 69-year-old mayor of Thousand Oaks,
Brockovich told jurors, "He's been nothing but a perfect gentleman to
others."</TE>
<TE>   In her 11 years at the Masry &amp; Vittitoe law firm in Westlake
Village, Brockovich testified, no one besides Cohen has complained
about sexual harassment. She admitted that some foul language has
been used by her and Masry, but denied that there was constant sexual
banter in the office as alleged on the witness stand by Cohen.</TE>
<TE>   Brockovich, who still works for Masry as his research director,
testified in the Van Nuys courtroom of Judge Stanley Weisberg that
two key pieces of evidence offered by Cohen's lawyer did not strike
her as sexual harassment.</TE>
<TE>   One was a lollipop in the shape of male genitalia. Cohen says it
was left for her at work by a male attorney with a note saying, "Suck
on this."</TE>
<TE>   The other was a cover photo of the Jewish Journal, showcasing
Cohen as an "outstanding graduate" of Loyola-Marymount law school at
age 20. On it, the same attorney had written, "Cool and kosher!! No
pork on these gams!!" and "She looks real good in a skirt."</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't seen this kind of stuff in our law firm," Brockovich
testified. "If it was between friends, it could have been construed
as a joke."</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers admit that attorney James Brown wrote the comments
on the magazine but deny that he gave Cohen the lollipop.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen contends that Masry fired her in December 1999 after she
refused his sexual advances. Her lawsuit says that constant foul,
sexually suggestive language used by Masry, Brockovich and others
created a hostile work environment.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen, who is Jewish, also alleges religious discrimination
because she had to work Friday nights to attend meetings of a
citizens group Masry was representing in a lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Masry denies all the allegations and says that he fired her
because she misrepresented her academic credentials. After she worked
for him only a few months, he concluded that "she was in over her
head."</TE>
<TE>   Masry testified Monday that there has been "not even a whisper" of
sexual harassment allegations against him in more than 40 years of
running his law firm.</TE>
<TE>   When he hired Cohen out of law school, about the time the movie
"Erin Brockovich" was becoming a hit, her resume was so impressive
that he believed that he could make Cohen a star attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Masry testified that Cohen falsely told him in a job interview
that she was about to graduate first, second or third from Loyola and
that she was concurrently receiving an MBA. Other trial evidence
showed that she graduated fifth from last in her nearly 400-member
law class and that she had been disqualified from Loyola's MBA
program.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought to myself, boy, in 10 years I'll make her the Clarence
Darrow of the West Coast," he testified.</TE>
<TE>   Masry planned to assign her to the same type of environmental
litigation that was the plot line in the Universal Pictures film.</TE>
<TE>   The film told the story of the town of Hinkley, Calif., where
Brockovich tenaciously proved large-scale corporate pollution.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually Masry won a $333-million settlement from Pacific Gas &amp;
Electric in that case.</TE>
<TE>   Outside court, Brockovich said she felt bad about having to
testify against someone beginning her career, but she thought that
she had no choice.</TE>
<TE>   "Ed is my mentor, my boss, my hero," she said. "He was delighted
to hire this young person. It just didn't work out."</TE>

<HD>UC Seeks Nurses in Event of Strike</HD>
<DH>Health: A Web site offers $1,000 for a 12-hour shift, plus
expenses, to staff hospitals if the one-day walkout occurs. About
8,000 could strike.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A temporary nursing agency is seeking replacement nurses to work at
University of California medical centers during a one-day strike next
week, offering wages of $1,000 for a 12-hour shift plus up to $600 in
travel expenses and "deluxe accommodations."</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco firm, Healthcare Consulting &amp; Staffing Services,
is advertising on a Web site, www.scab.org, for nurses to "be a part
of the largest strike ever staffed."</LD>
<LD>   If the 8,000 nurses of the UC system strike on May 29, as planned,
such temporary replacements would earn about three times as much as
the average clinical nurse at UCLA Medical Center in Westwood, union
officials said.</LD>
<TE>   The wages raise questions about how high the costs will go if the
strike is extended by the nurses union against UC's five medical
centers, including UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "The university should be figuring out how to use its available
funds to make a decent offer to its nurses, not spend the money on
folks to replace those nurses in the event of a strike," said Joe
Lindsay, chief negotiator for the California Nurses Assn., the union
representing the nurses.</TE>
<TE>   UC spokesman Paul Schwartz refused to discuss the deals between
the public university and the temporary staffing agencies, or the
amount of money involved. He said the information is not relevant to
the contract dispute.</TE>
<TE>   "As a responsible health-care provider, we are obligated to take
steps to protect our patients, including making precautionary
arrangements for temporary staff for the day of the strike," Schwartz
said in a written statement.</TE>
<TE>   "Accordingly, UC has contracted with several staffing agencies to
reserve temporary nursing personnel in the event we feel the strike
threatens to compromise patient care..."</TE>
<TE>   In the past week, the UC system has also said it would begin
closing certain services, such as trauma care, in the days leading up
to a strike. It could also transfer patients to other hospital
systems.</TE>
<TE>   If the strike settles at the last minute, the replacement nurses
who arrive on site with proper documentation would receive no less
than $500, according to the Web site of Healthcare Consulting &amp;
Staffing Services. The firm is also paying a "referral bonus" of $200
for nurses not in the database.</TE>
<TE>   A representative answering the phone at the nursing agency on
Monday declined to comment. The company recently provided
replacements for nurses who went on strike at Oregon Health &amp; Science
University.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Oregon Health &amp; Science University in Portland said
they spent $600,000 per week for replacement nurses' wages, plus
$200,000 per week for incidentals such as housing, licensing and
travel. The state university hospital used 800 temporary nurses
throughout a 56-day strike, with 300 to 400 working at any given
time.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiators for UC and the nurses union remain divided on several
issues as they try to replace a contract that expired April 30. Union
members voted overwhelmingly earlier this month to authorize a
strike.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson
(D-Culver City), Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San
Francisco) and more than 40 members of the Legislature signed a
letter to the UC administration calling on them to resolve the
dispute with the nurses.</TE>
<TE>   Bustamante and Wesson are UC regents.</TE>
<TE>   The nurses union wants UC to abandon its merit-pay plan and adopt
a system of raises based solely upon years of service.</TE>
<TE>   The nurses also want the hospitals to prohibit mandatory overtime
and minimum ratios of nurses to patients.</TE>
<TE>   UC officials said the merit system appropriately rewards
high-quality care and is supported by many nurses. In addition,
officials said they have offered limits to mandatory overtime and
have agreed to abide by nurse-to-patient ratios once they have been
finalized by state regulators.</TE>

<HD>So What Were LAX Fliers Expecting: Vladeville, Webbertown?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some Sacramentans flying out of LAX were not happy about Southwest
Airlines' destination monitors on the day the Lakers-Kings series
started. Sacramento Bee columnist R.E. Graswich reports that the
airline had a bit of a problem spelling the name of the state
capital. Seems it came out: "Shaq-ramento."</LD>
<LD>   Unreal estate: Today's specials (see accompanying) include:</LD>
<LD>   * A residence with a garage for a family of SUV owners (Joyce
Hiller of Redondo Beach)</LD>
<TE>   * A home with a lingerie room (Diana Bahr of L.A.)</TE>
<TE>   * And a canyon property that might appeal to, shall we say, less
ambitious types.</TE>
<TE>   Open wide for this item: Regarding the discussion here of people
with appropriate last names, Joan Kaas mentioned a dentist whose
father had been in the same business. She never snapped a picture of
his sign, but luckily I found one in my files taken by Gregg
Stockdale (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Disorder in the court: During a lawyer-on-the-courthouse-steps
survey, the L.A. Daily Journal asked for some "worst client
experience" stories. Here are a couple:</TE>
<TE>   * Diane Faber said she came back from lunch with a client who was
being depositioned, "and the first question asked was, 'Have you ever
used heroin?' Before I could object, the client said, 'Sure, hasn't
everyone tried it once?'''</TE>
<TE>   * Gary Bostwick had a client being depositioned, and "as soon as
they asked the first question, he passed out. The questioner thought
he had killed the deponent. And I felt awful. I was, after all,
supposed to defend my client. And here, I'd had him killed! It turned
out that he was OK--it was due to an unrelated condition."</TE>
<TE>   Digging for answers: "City of Bones," the title of Michael
Connelly's new novel, refers in part to the murder of a real-life
victim known as "La Brea Woman." Connelly's protagonist, L.A. police
detective Harry Bosch, learns that almost a century ago, a nearly
complete skeleton of a woman was found in La Brea Tar Pits. The
victim, who appeared to have been killed by a blow to the head, lived
about 9,000 years ago. Bosch finds this out while working on a more
recent skeletal-remains case. I don't think I'm revealing too much of
the plot when I say that Bosch never does solve the La Brea Woman
murder.</TE>
<TE>   Poetry in motion: My request for unusual vanity plates prompted
Irene Kennedy to write: "The husband of a friend of mine is a
urologist. His name is Richard Cerruti. His license plate reads:
2PCRC."</TE>
<TE>   More moving plates: Lynn Felton nominated the absurdist sentiment
W8N4GDO. Which reminded me of the creepy license W8N4BG1. You can be
sure the latter driver lives in the L.A. area, not Shaq-ramento.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Forget about clever plates. What Susan Moore of Lomita
wants to see are explanations for the obscure ones she comes across,
such as this declaration on a South Bay woman's car: IAMBOO.</TE>

<HD>No-Bid Contracts Banned by Davis</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIRGINIA ELLIS and DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Moving to address a controversy that is dogging his administration,
Gov. Gray Davis issued an emergency order Monday banning all no-bid
contracts and promised to sign legislation imposing
conflict-of-interest rules for computer contracts.</LD>
<LD>   As hearings into his administration's handling of a no-bid
contract for Oracle software continued a few doors away, the governor
announced that he was also appointing a committee to write tough new
regulations that would prevent a repeat of the Oracle debacle.</LD>
<LD>   "I am determined to ensure that taxpayers get their money's worth
and that all state contracts withstand scrutiny," Davis said in a
prepared statement.</LD>
<TE>   He said his executive order would stop the state from entering
into any contracts over $100,000 that were not competitively bid and
would remain in effect until new regulations that would discourage
sole-source agreements are established.</TE>
<TE>   Davis also said that when it reaches his desk, he will sign a
conflict-of-interest bill (SB 1467) by Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del
Rey) that would prevent consultants hired to advise the state on
technology contracts from bidding on those same contracts.</TE>
<TE>   The decision was a reversal from a position Davis took three years
ago when he vetoed a similar bill by Bowen, saying it would "restrict
... flexibility" of state agencies in procuring computer equipment
and services.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' latest actions came as the Oracle controversy continued to
plague his administration and his reelection efforts, even as he
attempted to turn the political debate to other issues, including the
latest Enron disclosures.</TE>
<TE>   The contract became a liability for Davis in April, when the state
auditor released a highly critical review that found taxpayers may
have been saddled with as much as $41million in Oracle software that
wasn't needed.</TE>
<TE>   The audit found the administration had signed a $95-million deal
to buy Oracle software that was brokered by Logicon, a company that
had been hired a year earlier to advise the Department of Information
Technology on the state's software licensing options.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the agreement was signed, an Oracle lobbyist handed
a $25,000 contribution to Davis' director of e-government, Arun
Baheti, for the governor's reelection campaign. Davis has since
returned the $25,000 donation, suspended the head of the Department
of Information Technology, and forced the resignations of Baheti and
the director of the Department of General Services, which approved
the contracts.</TE>
<TE>   His latest effort to defuse the controversy met with mixed
reactions along partisan lines.</TE>
<TE>   "Two cliches come to mind: 'closing the barn door after the horse
is out' and 'better late than never,'" said Sen. Tom McClintock
(R-Thousand Oaks). "The state has tough regulations that promote
competitive bidding. The governor just chose to ignore them."</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Bill Leonard (R-San Bernardino), a member of the
committee investigating the deal, said the ban on no-bid contracts
also came late. He said that a year ago Davis vetoed a bill by Sen.
Steve Peace (D-El Cajon) that would have prohibited sole-source
contracting.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats were less critical. Bowen said the appointment of a
special committee to examine contracting would enable the state to
address an array of problems associated with the way it does
business.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Dean Flores (D-Shafter), chairman of the Joint
Legislative Auditing Committee, which is examining the Oracle
contract, called Davis' executive order "a stopgap" that "plugs a
hole in a sinking ship."</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after Davis issued his order, the committee approved two
separate audits aimed at broadening the Legislature's investigation
into state procurement practices. One seeks to assess how California
should purchase computers and computer services. The other looks at
the state's list of prequalified contractors who are eligible for
certain state contracts.</TE>
<TE>   The committee, which continues its investigation today, agreed to
give the governor's office until Friday to comply with its request
for documents. The administration had requested the delay.</TE>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Delta Airlines flight from Los Angeles to New York was delayed more
than four hours Monday by a bomb search that was triggered by a
passenger's offhand remark, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   FBI spokeswoman Cheryl Mimura said a male passenger aboard Delta
Flight 106 was detained and questioned. He was released after
authorities determined he had not made a threat but was only
speculating that a departure delay was caused by concerns about a
bomb.</LD>
<LD>   After the remark was reported to the flight crew, the 159
passengers were taken off the aircraft and it was towed from its
regular gate to a secure, isolated part of Los Angeles International
Airport for the search, Mimura said.</LD>
<TE>   Nothing was found, and the plane was towed back to the gate about
three hours later. It departed for New York with its passengers an
hour and a half later.</TE>
<TE>   The lesson, Mimura said: "Don't talk about bombs on aircraft."</TE>

<HD>Senate OKs Bill Requiring Gun Locks Certified Safe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A bill requiring that gun safety locks be certified as safe before
they can be sold in California was passed by the Senate on Monday and
sent to the Assembly, where its approval is expected. The vote was
22-9.</LD>
<LD>   Under the bill (SB 1670) by Sen. Jack Scott (D-Altadena), trigger
locks and other devices would be subject to approval by the state
Department of Justice before they could enter the marketplace.</LD>
<LD>   Also under the bill, violations would be subject to fines starting
at $500 and climbing to $5,000.</LD>
<TE>   Since Jan. 1, devices designed to prevent accidental firing have
been required for guns sold and transferred in California.</TE>
<TE>   But Scott said that some of the devices are flimsy and are
themselves unsafe.</TE>
<TE>   In the past five months, 91 safety mechanisms have been approved
by the department.</TE>

<LD>A mobile home was damaged by a blaze Monday that may have started in
the kitchen, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County Fire Department officials are investigating the
cause of the fire that gutted the rear half of the mobile home on
Ventura Boulevard. The owner, a 55-year-old woman, was at work but
her poodle died in the blaze.</LD>
<LD>   Despite high winds, no other mobile homes in the park were
affected, said Fire Department spokeswoman Sandi Wells.</LD>
<TE>   "With a quick response and some aggressive firefighting, they were
able to keep it confined to this mobile home," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze caused about $82,500 in damage, Wells said.</TE>

<LD>   Nine shooters were preparing to kill as many as 15,000 kangaroos
within the 110,000-acre Puckapunyal army base in the southern
Australian state of Victoria.</LD>
<LD>   The Defense Department hired the shooters after the kangaroo
population exploded to more than 80,000 and the animals began
starving, a spokesman said.</LD>
<TE>   The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals will be
able to monitor the cull, which ecologists recommended.</TE>
<TE>   Several protesters were evicted from the base Sunday when they
broke in and tried to feed hay to some of the kangaroos.</TE>

<LD>   Villagers in trucks streamed off the slopes of the Colima volcano
after a lava spill prompted authorities to order an evacuation.</LD>
<LD>   About 75 people in villages within six miles of the volcano's
crater were evacuated. More than 200 people had been evacuated over
the weekend.</LD>
<TE>   Experts at Colima University said the volcano's seismic activity
had intensified and that its lava crust had broken, causing lava to
spill over the southwestern slopes.</TE>
<TE>   This suggests that the 13,000-foot volcano, about 300 miles west
of Mexico City, is close to erupting, they say.</TE>

<HD>Castro Must Yield to U.S., Bush Says</HD>
<DH>Policy: President lists requirements, including free
elections, before Cuba ties can improve.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN and NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>President Bush denounced Fidel Castro on Monday as a tyrant
maintaining a "stranglehold" on Cuba and declared that the U.S. will
continue its economic quarantine of the Communist island unless the
Cuban president accedes to a long list of conditions, including free
elections.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking first at the White House and then here in the heart of
the nation's fiercely anti-Castro Cuban American community, Bush laid
out his vision of normal diplomatic relations between the United
States and a free Cuba. His remarks were the culmination of an
administration policy review that began in January.</LD>
<LD>   Cheered lustily by several thousand flag-waving, fist-pumping
Cuban Americans in a Miami auditorium, the president said open trade
with Cuba and a "robust" aid program "will only--only--be possible
when Cuba has a new government that is fully democratic."</LD>
<TE>   But Bush's adherence to a hard line on Cuba is likely to collide
soon with attempts by members of Congress to ease the long-standing
trade embargo. They argue that economic sanctions imposed more than
40 years ago have only harmed the Cuban people and have not been
successful in removing Castro from power.</TE>
<TE>   Bush did not indicate whether his vision for Cuba includes a role
for Castro.</TE>
<TE>   "The choice rests with Mr. Castro," he said in Washington. "If he
accepts our offer, he can bring help to his people and hope to our
relations."</TE>
<TE>   In Miami, as his cheering listeners leapt to their feet, Bush
declared: "Mr. Castro must now act. He has his chance."</TE>
<TE>   Among Bush's demands were free, internationally monitored
balloting for the National Assembly. Elections are set for next year.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Castro, once, just once, show that you're unafraid of a real
election," Bush said in Miami as his audience responded with another
ovation.</TE>
<TE>   The president indicated that even if Castro spurned his
"Initiative for a New Cuba," the proposals would promote democratic
freedoms "step by step."</TE>
<TE>   "It's sticks and carrots--both," said Otto J. Reich, the State
Department's point man on Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   "Our plan is to accelerate freedom's progress in Cuba in every way
possible," Bush said. "The goal is freedom for Cuba's people."</TE>
<TE>   The president spoke on the 100th anniversary of Cuba's
independence, which, he said, Castro "hijacked" nearly half a century
ago. Castro "has turned a beautiful island into a prison," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   He also vowed to veto any measure passed by Congress that would
ease or repeal the long-standing trade embargo against Cuba.
Softening the sanctions would "underwrite tyranny," he said, "and we
cannot let that happen."</TE>
<TE>   But a strong bipartisan coalition of lawmakers--comprising liberal
Democrats, free-trade Republicans and farm-state representatives from
both parties--wants to ease or repeal the sanctions, put in place
after Castro nationalized U.S. property on the island in 1960.</TE>
<TE>   Momentum for changing U.S. policy toward Cuba has grown in the six
years since a tough embargo law was enacted after Castro's military
shot down two civilian airplanes piloted by Cuban Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Many lawmakers who supported the 1996 Helms-Burton Act, which
codified the trade embargo, now seem willing to ease the embargo or
even repeal it.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Congress approved limited sales of food and medicine to
Cuba. In 2001, the House of Representatives voted to end the widely
circumnavigated ban on tourist travel to the island. And this year,
the bipartisan coalitions in the House and the Senate are pushing to
pry open doors to commerce that have been closed for four decades.</TE>
<TE>   One such trade-promotion bill, called "Bridges to the Cuban
People," has 28 Senate sponsors, six of whom voted in March 1996 for
the Helms-Burton Act.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.), the bill's chief sponsor,
derided Bush's proposals to begin direct mail service to Cuba and
allow humanitarian aid and support for Cuban dissidents. Unless the
trade embargo ends, Dodd said, U.S. policy will remain flawed.</TE>
<TE>   "Throwing worn-out wallpaper over a cracked foundation--which is
what the Bush administration proposal amounts to--doesn't solve the
problem," Dodd said. "We need a fundamental change in the way we look
at Cuba."</TE>
<TE>   A Senate challenge to the Bush policy could come as early as
today. Sen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.) is pushing an amendment to
pending trade legislation that would ease credit restrictions on
sales of U.S. food and medicine to Cuba. Currently, Cuba must pay for
these imports with scarce cash or obtain loans from foreign banks.
Dorgan said he hopes for a vote this week.</TE>
<TE>   A House critic of current U.S. policy toward Cuba, Rep. Jeff Flake
(R-Ariz.), predicted Monday that Congress will move soon to change
policy whether or not the president agrees. Farm-state interests, he
said, will soon roll over the embargo supporters, led by Cuban
Americans in Miami and the House GOP leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "Pressures are building," Flake said. "Everyone recognizes it's a
failed policy."</TE>
<TE>   The embargo has influential backing among top GOP members of
Congress, including House Republican Whip Tom DeLay of Texas.</TE>
<TE>   "The president was exactly right to reiterate the fundamental
bright-line threshold that Castro must cross to allow expanded
relations between the United States and the people of Cuba," DeLay
said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Here in Miami, Bush was given a hero's welcome in the James L.
Knight International Center. The audience, estimated at 4,000 people,
repeatedly interrupted the president with chants of "USA!" and a
variety of Cuban liberation slogans.</TE>
<TE>   The session often took on the look of a raucous political rally,
and the audience sang the Cuban national anthem with far more vigor
than it did "The Star-Spangled Banner."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's initiative would provide aid to legitimate U.S. religious
and other nongovernmental organizations that directly serve the needs
of the Cuban people; offer scholarships in the U.S. for Cuban
students and professionals seeking to build independent civil
institutions in Cuba; and try to restore direct U.S.-Cuban mail
service.</TE>
<TE>   "Even as we seek to end tyranny, we will work to make life better
for people living under and resisting Castro's rule," the president
said.</TE>
<TE>   Although he harshly condemned Castro and his "career of
oppression," Bush did not call outright for a "regime change" in
Havana, as he has in the case of Saddam Hussein and Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's initiative offers Cuba's government a different path,
leading to a different future--a future of greater democracy and
prosperity and respect," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   In neither speech did Bush mention the accusations made this month
by a senior State Department official that Cuba is developing
biological weapons technology. He also did not announce tougher
restrictions on travel to Cuba, as had been predicted by some.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are follow-on issues that we're going to look at throughout
the year," a senior Bush administration official said.</TE>
<TE>   After his remarks here, Bush attended a fund-raiser expected to
reap $2 million for Florida Republicans. He was accompanied by his
brother Jeb, who is seeking reelection as governor of the state.</TE>
<TE>   Chen reported from Miami and Anderson from Washington. Times staff
writer Janet Hook in Washington contributed to this report.</TE>

<LD>Excerpts from President Bush's speech on Cuba at the White House:</LD>
<LD>   Bienvenidos. Welcome to the White House for the 100th anniversary
of Cuban independence. Today we honor the ties of friendship, and
family, and faith, that unite the Cuban people and the people of the
United States....</LD>
<LD>   Cuba's independence one century ago today was the inspiration of
great figures such as Felix Varela. It was the result of
determination and talent on the part of great statesmen such as Jose
Marti.... Most of all, Cuba's independence was the product of the
great courage and sacrifice of the Cuban people.</LD>
<TE>   Today, and every day for the past 43 years, that legacy of courage
has been insulted by a tyrant who uses brutal methods to enforce a
bankrupt vision. That legacy has been debased by a relic from another
era, who has turned a beautiful island into a prison. In a career of
oppression, Mr. Castro has imported nuclear-armed ballistic missiles,
and he has exported his military forces to encourage civil war
abroad....</TE>
<TE>   Today, I'm announcing an Initiative for a New Cuba that offers
Cuba's government a way forward towards democracy and hope, and
better relations with the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Cuba's scheduled to hold elections to its National Assembly in
2003.... In most elections, there has been one candidate, Castro's
candidate.</TE>
<TE>   All elections in Castro's Cuba have been a fraud. The voices of
the Cuban people have been suppressed, and their votes have been
meaningless. That's the truth. Es la verdad. In the 2003 National
Assembly elections in Cuba, Cuba has the opportunity to offer Cuban
voters the substance of democracy, not its hollow, empty forms.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition parties should have the freedom to organize, assemble
and speak, with equal access to all airwaves. All political prisoners
must be released and allowed to participate in the election process.
Human rights organizations should be free to visit Cuba to ensure
that the conditions for free elections are being created. And the
2003 elections should be monitored by objective outside observers....</TE>
<TE>   It's important for Americans to understand, without political
reform, without economic reform, trade with Cuba will merely enrich
Fidel Castro and his cronies....</TE>
<TE>   If Cuba's government takes all the necessary steps to ensure that
the 2003 elections are certifiably free and fair--certifiably free
and fair--and if Cuba also begins to adopt meaningful market-based
reforms, then--and only then--I will work with the United States
Congress to ease the ban on trade and travel between our two
countries....</TE>
<TE>   Today I'm announcing a series of actions that will directly
benefit the Cuban people, and give them greater control of their
economic and political destiny.</TE>
<TE>   My administration will ease restrictions on humanitarian
assistance by legitimate U.S. religious and other nongovernmental
organizations that directly serve the needs of the Cuban people and
will help build Cuban civil society. And the United States will
provide such groups with direct assistance that can be used for
humanitarian and entrepreneurial activities.</TE>
<TE>   With real reform in Cuba, our countries can begin chipping away at
four decades of distrust and division. And the choice rests with Mr.
Castro....</TE>
<TE>   Cuba's independence was achieved a century ago. It was hijacked
nearly half a century ago. Yet the independent spirit of the Cuban
people has never faltered.... The United States is proud to stand
with all Cubans, and all Cuban Americans, who love freedom. And we
will continue to stand with you until liberty returns to the land you
love so well. Viva Cuba libre.</TE>

<HD>Troops Still Abusing Chechens, Russian Says</HD>
<DH>Military: Official also disputes evaluation of officer as
temporarily insane during killing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Russia's top official in Chechnya on Monday denounced the behavior of
Russian troops in the republic, saying new guidelines imposed by the
military to curb abuses were being flouted on the ground.</LD>
<LD>   "People still disappear without a trace," Akhmad Kadyrov, head of
Chechnya's Moscow-appointed administration, told reporters in the
republic's capital, Grozny. "Those involved in the operations do not
introduce themselves or say where those arrested are to be moved or
what the charges against them are."</LD>
<LD>   Kadyrov said he also took issue with a psychiatric evaluation
declaring Russian Col. Yuri Budanov--the only high-ranking officer
facing prosecution for misdeeds in the war-ravaged
republic--temporarily insane at the time he killed an 18-year-old
Chechen woman.</LD>
<TE>   The psychiatric finding announced last week is widely believed to
lay the groundwork for a light sentence or even an acquittal in the
closely watched 15-month-long trial, which appears to be drawing to a
close.</TE>
<TE>   "We will not be able to restore order until everyone is held
responsible for their conduct, regardless of rank or post," Kadyrov
said in remarks shown on national television.</TE>
<TE>   The military's new operational guidelines, known as Order 80, were
imposed in late March in an apparent effort to raise accountability
among Russian troops. Service personnel were ordered to identify
themselves when entering a house, ensure that registration numbers on
their vehicles are visible, keep public records of all suspects
detained in document sweeps or special operations, and inform
detainees' families of their place of detention.</TE>
<TE>   Local administrators, prosecutors and journalists were granted
permission to observe such operations.</TE>
<TE>   Kadyrov's remarks were the sharpest criticism from a prominent
Russian official since the guidelines went into effect. Kadyrov
appears to have close relations with the Kremlin; he recently was
granted elevated powers by President Vladimir V. Putin.</TE>
<TE>   Aslambek Aslakhanov, Chechnya's representative in Russia's lower
house of parliament, said Kadyrov's remarks were not a commentary on
Kremlin policy but a natural reaction to the facts in light of his
responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   "Since he is the head of the republic, he and his actions are
watched very closely by all Chechen people," Aslakhanov said.</TE>
<TE>   Kadyrov's statements confirm reports from the region and from
human rights groups that Russian troops continue to conceal their
identities during so-called zachistka operations, or document sweeps,
and that local officials and other observers have been kept away.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial, Russia's most prominent human rights watchdog group,
says it has documented the disappearance of dozens of civilians since
Order 80 was announced. In two operations in the town of Alkhan-Kala,
the group says, about two dozen residents died or disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   Russian military officers and prosecutors who met with human
rights observers in Grozny last month did not deny that the order was
being violated, but they described the abuses as "the actions of
individual, undisciplined servicemen and commanders," according to an
account of the meeting posted by Memorial on its Web site.</TE>
<TE>   As for the Budanov case, Kadyrov said the psychiatric evaluation
of the colonel as temporarily insane defied common sense.</TE>
<TE>   "I wonder how Budanov could have been appointed as a regiment
commander and entrusted with control over personnel and weapons if he
is not responsible for his actions," Kadyrov said.</TE>
<TE>   Budanov has admitted to strangling Elza Kungayeva, also known as
Kheda Kungayeva, in his private tent in March 2000. He says he took
her into the tent for interrogation and killed her in a fit of rage
after she denied being a sniper for Chechen rebels and insulted him.</TE>
<TE>   According to Russian news reports based on court documents,
Budanov then ordered several of his subordinates to retrieve the body
from his tent.</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers found Kungayeva naked, her ripped clothes on the
ground.</TE>
<TE>   He ordered them to bury her in the forest, where her body was
later recovered.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors, who originally charged Budanov with rape as well as
murder, have since dropped the rape charge, saying instead that she
was "desecrated" after death by one of the soldiers ordered to bury
her.</TE>
<TE>   They say they believe Budanov's account of the murder and agree
with the evaluation that he was temporarily insane.</TE>
<TE>   "They have been looking for almost a year and a half for a way to
help Budanov escape justice and come out unscathed. There have been
lots of psychiatric examinations of the accused, and finally the
court has found an examination board that would pronounce Budanov
insane," Aslakhanov said. "This is a classic example of doing
something by fair means or foul. Needless to say, the court has
behaved in a most reprehensible way."</TE>
<TE>   The Kungayev family, apparently believing that it has little power
to affect the case's outcome, has often failed to appear at court
hearings, which has dragged out the trial for 15 months.</TE>
<TE>   Russia has fought two wars against separatists in Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   Troops regained control of most of the republic two years ago, but
they continue to conduct operations to root out guerrillas hiding
among the civilian population.</TE>
<TE>   Alexei V. Kuznetsov of The Times' Moscow Bureau contributed to
this report.</TE>

<LD>Nuclear rivals India and Pakistan exchanged fire across their border
in Kashmir on Monday, and the military in India reportedly took
control of the country's paramilitary forces and merchant marine in a
sign of building tension over the disputed Himalayan region.</LD>
<LD>   Each side in the simmering conflict sought to bring international
pressure to bear on the other. India said it asked for foreign help
in isolating Pakistan, which requested international assistance in
starting talks to settle the dispute.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration announced plans to send Deputy Secretary
of State Richard Armitage to the region. State Department spokesman
Richard Boucher said the administration was "strongly concerned"
about the situation.</LD>
<TE>   India has refused to negotiate until Pakistan stops its alleged
support for Islamic militants who have launched attacks on the Indian
side of the border in Kashmir. Pakistan denies backing the militants
but does support the goal of separating the Indian portion of mainly
Muslim Kashmir from Hindu India.</TE>
<TE>   The two nations have sent a total of about 1 million soldiers to
their frontier as the dispute flared anew over Kashmir, which has
provoked two wars between India and Pakistan since their independence
from Britain in 1947.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called on both sides "to
exercise maximum restraint to avert a further escalation of
tensions," U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said in New York.</TE>

<HD>4 Israelis Kicked Out of Cabinet</HD>
<DH>Politics: Sharon fires members of the Shas Party after they
fail to support his economic plan. But a compromise could get them
back in.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Prime Minister Ariel Sharon abruptly fired four of his Cabinet
members from the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party Monday night after they
helped to narrowly defeat the government's own emergency economic
plan in the Israeli parliament.</LD>
<LD>   A political storm that threatened to shake the foundations of
Sharon's broad-based government erupted when Shas, Israel's
third-largest party, voted against the plan to slash about $2.7
billion from the budget, saying it would hurt the poor. The measure
was defeated by three votes.</LD>
<LD>   It was the second serious political setback for Sharon in less
than 10 days. On May 12, his Likud Party's Central Committee adopted
a resolution ruling out establishment of a Palestinian state, in
direct contradiction to Sharon's stated support for eventual
Palestinian independence.</LD>
<TE>   The events underscore the gap between Sharon's popularity with the
general public, which sees him as a powerful leader, and his
weakening position in his own party and with the fractious
parliament.</TE>
<TE>   "Prime Minister Ariel Sharon this evening ordered the immediate
dismissal of four Shas ministers ... following this evening's Knesset
vote against the government's economic program," Sharon's office said
in a terse statement. Sharon also dismissed the deputy ministers of
United Torah Judaism, another ultra-Orthodox party in his Cabinet,
after they, too, voted against the economic plan.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd rather stand with the poor and not in the government," said
Interior Minister Eli Yishai, the leader of Shas. "If they fire me
because I fight for those who haven't anything to eat--that is my
reward.... The economic situation is difficult. I advise the prime
minister to begin negotiating with his allies."</TE>
<TE>   Without the support of Shas, Sharon would maintain only 60 seats
in the 120-seat Knesset, or parliament, one short of a majority. But
by this morning Sharon reportedly was close to reaching a compromise
with the party that would allow the members to remain in the
government. But even if the crisis is resolved, political analysts
said, Shas' defection, and Sharon's sacking of its ministers, could
signal the beginning of the end for the government, a partnership of
his nationalistic Likud Party, the ultra-Orthodox, the center-left
Labor Party and some small, far-right parties.</TE>
<TE>   If the crisis is not resolved before the resignations take effect
just before midnight Israel time Wednesday, Sharon will be more
dependent on the Labor Party to stay in power. He will probably find
himself buffeted between Labor's demands to renew diplomatic contacts
with the Palestinians and the far-right's demands that he crush the
Palestinian Authority and get rid of its leader, Yasser Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   The economic program's defeat reflected "anarchy that is leading
to the dissolution of the government," said Effi Oshaya, chairman of
Labor's Knesset faction.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition leaders immediately called for Sharon to resign and
dissolve the Knesset, citing his failure to pass the emergency bill.
Both Yossi Sarid, leader of the left-wing Meretz, and Tommy Lapid,
leader of the anti-Orthodox Shinui, said the government's failure
meant Sharon should go. But aides to the prime minister said he would
invite Shinui to join the government.</TE>
<TE>   The economic plan, which was meant to slash the deficit in the
2002 budget, was defeated by a vote of 47 to 44, with one abstention.
Sharon sternly reprimanded Education Minister Limor Livnat, from his
own Likud, for failing to show up for the vote. Another Likud Knesset
member stayed away, as did several Labor Knesset members and David
Levy of the Gesher Party, also a member of the government.</TE>
<TE>   "The Knesset preferred narrow political interests over the
national interest," said Finance Ministry Silvan Shalom, who looked
stunned as television cameras captured him watching the vote tally
flash on an electronic board in the Knesset.</TE>
<TE>   "We are determined to pass the emergency plan because there is no
other choice and we have to save the economy," Shalom said.</TE>
<TE>   Economists predicted that the failure to pass the emergency plan
would have dire consequences for a recession-bound Israeli economy
hit by the collapse of the high-tech industry and 20 months of
fighting with the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar was expected to soar to new highs against the shekel,
the stock market was expected to drop and Israel's international
credit rating was expected to be lowered after Monday night's vote.
Israeli media reported early today that Sharon instructed his Cabinet
secretary, Gideon Saar, to conduct a telephone survey of Cabinet
ministers with the hope of bringing the emergency package to a vote
again Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   This morning, Israel Radio reported that Shas ministers might
abstain in that vote, a move that would allow them to stay in the
government because Sharon would rescind their dismissal.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon may well win points with Israeli voters for taking on the
ultra-Orthodox parties over the budget. But Sharon is not facing
voters now, he is dealing with an unruly Knesset filled with members
loath to sacrifice benefits intended for their constituents in the
name of belt-tightening. Sharon may yet be forced to compromise and
bring Shas' five ministers back into the government, including
Religious Affairs Minister Asher Ohana, who was not fired, because he
is not a Knesset member, but resigned when his colleagues were
sacked.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>After Arkady Wieselman narrowly escaped Israel's deadliest suicide
bombing by walking out of a hotel dining room moments before a blast
killed 29 people, he phoned his family to say his survival was a
miracle.</LD>
<LD>   After Sunday's blast in the vegetable market in Wieselman's home
city of Netanya, his family's phone was silent.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly two months after surviving the suicide blast at the hotel,
Wieselman, along with two other Israelis, was killed in the city's
market by a suicide bomber dressed like a soldier.</LD>
<TE>   Wieselman, a chef at the Park Hotel, had helped prepare a Passover
Seder meal March27 when a suicide bomber walked into the packed
dining hall.</TE>
<TE>   Just before the bomber blew himself up, Wieselman had left the
dining room to get something from the kitchen's freezer.</TE>
<TE>   Hotel manager Rina Hamamy said she arrived at the scene five
minutes later to find him tending to the injured.</TE>
<TE>   "He helped save the people. I thought it was impossible that
something like this would happen again to the people at the hotel,"
she said.</TE>

<HD>Standing Up for Order in Kabul Takes Nerve and a Tough Hide</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: Vehicles with more passengers on top than
inside. Optional signal lights. A traffic cop's life is hard--and
getting harder.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>The bravest man in Kabul is not a ruthless warlord or a battlefield
veteran but a slender 66-year-old whose only weapon is a hand-held
stop sign with its reflective paint worn off.</LD>
<LD>   For 38 years, Shamsuddin Sultani has been a Kabul traffic cop, a
fearless choreographer of a daily cataclysm of vehicular volume that
has at least tripled in the few months since peace and a new
government replaced a quarter-century of war.</LD>
<LD>   Armored vehicles of the international peacekeeping force joust
with four-wheel-drive aid delivery vans for priority on narrow,
crumbling streets pocked by years of war and neglect. Cars and buses
with more passengers on them than in them refuse to brake at
intersections for fear of pitching their rooftop fares. Battered
bicycles toting televisions, lumber or whole families weave defiantly
through the gridlocked, smoke-belching throng as pushcarts, rickshaws
and makeshift wheelchairs move in their wake.</LD>
<TE>   Leaning on the horn seems obligatory, and Kabul drivers have added
melody to the madness with musical klaxons emitting incongruous
strains of "Frere Jacques," "London Bridge Is Falling Down" and
"Don't Cry for Me, Argentina."</TE>
<TE>   Signal lights damaged by bombing have been repaired at three
intersections, but there is seldom electricity available to run them.
Street signs also disappeared over the years, but police say their
restoration is a low priority because most drivers are illiterate
anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "There are too many cars now for our roads, but the bigger problem
is that nobody follows the rules," complains Sultani, who regularly
gets bumped and bruised but is hurt most by drivers' deteriorating
respect for those seeking to bring order to chaos.</TE>
<TE>   As Stability Returns</TE>
<TE>   to Kabul, So Do People</TE>
<TE>   A victim of its own success in securing relative stability over
the last five months, Kabul has seen an influx of foreigners,
refugees and new business that has exceeded expectations.</TE>
<TE>   "Peace and security have brought about this congestion," says
Abdul Azim, deputy chief of the national traffic police squad that is
part of the Interior Ministry.</TE>
<TE>   The number of vehicles licensed in Kabul has increased by only a
few thousand this year to about 107,000. But Azim estimates that at
least 80% of the cars, trucks and buses on the road are unregistered.
With only 514 poorly paid employees to deal with formalities and
enforcement in this city of 2.7 million, the force doesn't even
bother issuing tickets, and only the most serious accidents warrant
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "Our city center is just too small for the number of cars trying
to get around it," says Azim, who notes that paved roads extend for
only about a two-mile radius.</TE>
<TE>   Azim says his office plans to urge the next Afghan government--to
be chosen in June--to encourage development on the outskirts of Kabul
to spread the economic activity and its incumbent traffic over a
wider space.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities recently imposed one-way traffic on some of the
narrower streets that had become impassable, but the growing volume
has already jammed those relief valves.</TE>
<TE>   "If the number of cars keeps increasing at this rate, there won't
be the possibility to move at all in about another month," predicts
Sultani, who says today's traffic is at least three times what it was
at any point in his long career.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic has grown so dramatically in recent months in part because
the personal car is both a family's most coveted asset and a way to
make money.</TE>
<TE>   "In other countries, people drive to get themselves to work, but
for Afghans the car often is our work," says Mohammed Aref, a
39-year-old who worked for the German chemicals giant Hoechst before
its plant here, like most companies', was shuttered by bombings and
trade sanctions. "I have to work as a taxi driver to support my
family until the factory starts work again."</TE>
<TE>   No special license is needed to become a taxi driver; the only
criterion is that the car be painted white and yellow. With neither
income reporting nor tax payment required, any car owner or
contracted driver can pick up fares.</TE>
<TE>   At Mohammed Zarif Mamozai's driving school--the only one in the
country--students plunk down the equivalent of an average monthly
salary of about $33 to take the 36-hour course leading to a driving
license.</TE>
<TE>   Most Afghans learn how to drive from a relative and simply take to
the road, but the school has persuaded its clients that it offers
professional training, even if its sole vehicle is missing a
headlight and lists precariously to the driver's side.</TE>
<TE>   Auto dealers are reporting booming business. At the Zaheb Car
Sales lot in central Kabul, Baryalay Azizi says he and the other
salesmen have seen monthly sales grow from about eight vehicles six
months ago to more than 30 last month. They sell everything from
shiny new $38,000 sport-utility vehicles to a battered '93 Toyota
Corolla priced at $4,000.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that the situation seems stable, a lot of people are getting
money from relatives abroad to get a car and start a business," says
Azizi, whose lot, like all sales operations here, accepts only full
advance payment in cash.</TE>
<TE>   Some cars have come out from under a canvas covering or inside a
rural outbuilding now that the Taliban rulers have been chased from
power.</TE>
<TE>   "Under the Taliban, people were afraid to drive because their cars
could be confiscated and there would be nothing they could do about
it," says Mohammed Kabir, 42, an instructor at Mamozai's driving
school. "Now people are bringing their cars out of hiding and putting
them back on the road."</TE>
<TE>   Traffic Makes It Tough</TE>
<TE>   for Nation to Move On</TE>
<TE>   All that traffic gets in the way of those struggling to feed and
assist a population that, although free of bombs and bloodshed, is
still in peril from drought and disease.</TE>
<TE>   "We waste so much time just getting across town to pick up our
deliveries," says Fraidun Jahani, a driver for the World Food
Program, which tries to feed the millions of Afghans displaced by
ethnic conflicts or destruction of their homes.  The lack of a public
bus system fuels much of the traffic. Those with jobs must pay
private drivers as much as a fifth of their daily income to get
shuttled to and from work.</TE>
<TE>   An even bigger contributor to the four-wheeled mayhem has been the
return--just in the last 10 weeks--of more than 500,000 refugees from
abroad, many of them borne home by right-hand-drive cars, vans,
trucks and buses from Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   In a country virtually devoid of statistical information and
populated by those who regard registration rules as an avoidable
nuisance, there is no official figure for the number of
right-hand-drive cars plying Afghanistan's roads, which are designed
for left-hand-drive cars.</TE>
<TE>   But an eyeball estimate suggests that the proportion is well over
half and expanding daily.</TE>
<TE>   Azim, of the traffic police, blames the right-hand-drive cars for
most of the accidents plaguing Afghanistan's crude highways, as those
drivers have to veer into oncoming traffic to see if the way ahead is
clear to pass.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an assault on our national culture by those who claim
Afghanistan should be part of Pakistan. They are trying to force a
change in our road system so they can claim we belong to them," says
Aga Mozafari, head of the international transportation department of
the Commerce Ministry.</TE>
<TE>   Allowing an unfettered inundation of cars may help the Afghan
economy in the short term, he says, but the bedlam now prevailing
will eventually damage business and the mending nation's ability to
attract investment.</TE>

<HD>Hope, Doubt in Little Havana</HD>
<DH>Policy: Despite their opposition to Castro, some of Miami's
Cuban Americans worry that Bush's hard-line stance may hurt their
relatives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>It was Cuban Independence Day in Little Havana on Monday, and
rum-laced Cuba libres were on the house at the Versailles restaurant.
Jose Lago, who fled the island in the 1960s, had just listened to
President Bush on the radio. And he had tears in his eyes.</LD>
<LD>   "He is the only president who will liberate Cuba," the 61-year-old
businessman said. "He is my president."</LD>
<LD>   One hundred years to the day after the Caribbean island became an
independent nation, Bush delivered a hard-line speech on
Cuban-American relations. He linked any lifting of the 40-year-old
U.S. trade embargo to Fidel Castro's willingness to free political
prisoners, allow opposition parties and organize independently
monitored elections.</LD>
<TE>   "A relic from another era," Bush said, "has turned a beautiful
island into a prison."</TE>
<TE>   The president then flew from Washington to celebrate the holiday
with leaders of Miami's 700,000-member Cuban American community--one
of the Republican Party's most reliable constituencies. It is also a
key voting bloc for the state GOP in the November elections, in which
the president's brother, Jeb, is seeking reelection as governor, and
for Bush's own reelection chances in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's tough talk, however, clearly did not sit well with everyone
in Little Havana, despite how they may feel about Castro and his
communist dictatorship.</TE>
<TE>   Marlene Garcia, who has been in America for 22 years, complained
about the current government restrictions on travel and money
transfers to Cuba. Her brother Julio, 45, who had remained on the
island, died of a heart attack Sunday. Garcia said she would like to
be able to attend the funeral without breaking U.S. law. Likewise,
Garcia said, her niece in Cuba depends on the cash payments Garcia
regularly wires her. "If you don't have dollars in Cuba, you can't
live."</TE>
<TE>   Some See Ordinary</TE>
<TE>   Cubans as Victims</TE>
<TE>   To mark the century of independence from Spain, Cristy Ruiz Brown
put the red, white and blue flags of the island into the hands of her
son, 3-year-old Dante, and daughter Vanessa, 11 months, and came to
Calle Ocho, Little Havana's Main Street. The New Jersey-born daughter
of Cuban exiles, Brown, 28, said she believed that Bush's approach
was too harsh--and that the long-standing ban on U.S.-Cuban trade
hurts ordinary Cubans and not the island's rulers.</TE>
<TE>   She also sounded dubious that Bush's strategy of offering renewed
economic ties in exchange for democratic reforms would work. "They're
not going to make those changes," Brown said. "If they didn't do it
in 40 years, I don't think they're going to do it the next day."</TE>
<TE>   But Manny Palmeiro, a Cuban American who is the spokesman for the
bus and rail system of Miami-Dade County, said Bush's new proposals
have backed Castro against a wall. "If, like [Castro] says in almost
all of his speeches, all the problems of the country are due to the
embargo, this is his chance to solve them," Palmeiro said. "With what
[Bush] has said this morning, we may see a new light."</TE>
<TE>   (To fete the Monday holiday, Palmeiro and other members of the
Hispanic Transit Society and the National Assn. of Hispanic Public
Administrators ordered an 8-foot-long lemon sponge layer cake with
custard filling that was shaped like the island of Cuba.)</TE>
<TE>   A week ago, former President Carter traveled to Havana and urged
Cubans to embrace democracy. He simultaneously called on the United
States to scrap its unilateral trade ban. In contrast, Bush insisted
Monday that the Castro leadership transform the political system
first, saying open commerce between the nations would be possible
only "when Cuba has a new government that is fully democratic."</TE>
<TE>   So as to not place all his bets on the 74-year-old Castro, Bush
promised aid to private organizations that assist Cubans, as well as
scholarships at U.S. colleges and universities for Cubans who are
trying to build civil institutions outside the communist system.</TE>
<TE>   The president's approach--offering Castro a deal while also trying
to foment change in the country--was music to the ears of the most
influential exile organization in Miami, the Cuban American National
Foundation. The group's leaders believe that revived trade would
cement Castro's grip on power.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, President Bush shut the door to those who want to throw a
lifeline to a dictatorship or have a humanitarian capitulation,"
executive director Joe Garcia said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   He also saluted Bush's echoing of demands by Cuban human rights
activists for a national referendum that would ask voters whether
they favor civil liberties--including freedom of speech--and amnesty
for political prisoners. The European Union also voiced support
Monday for the petition, known as the Varela Project.</TE>
<TE>   Doubters Among</TE>
<TE>   Dissidents in Havana</TE>
<TE>   But leading Cuban dissidents in Havana said Monday that Bush's
policies could hurt their efforts to force a democratic opening.</TE>
<TE>   "Changes have to be made, but changes have to be made on both
sides," Vladimiro Roca, who was released from prison this month two
months short of his five-year sentence, told Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   "Dialogue, negotiation and reconciliation" will do more than U.S.
hard-line policies, Roca said. There was no immediate response from
the Cuban government.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Padron, a 38-year-old Miami psychologist, expressed doubts
that even the deftest political maneuvering by the White House could
dislodge the wily and experienced Castro, who seized power with his
band of revolutionaries in 1959 and retained it through ruthless
repression and a secret police force trained by the Soviet KGB.</TE>
<TE>   Only an armed uprising of the same sort Castro organized against
Fulgencio Batista, the former president-turned-dictator he ousted,
will produce real results, Padron said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Cuban people can fight for freedom, but we need help--like we
had before with President Kennedy," he said. In 1961, the CIA backed
a failed invasion of Cuba by armed exiles at the Bay of Pigs.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last few months, Uva de Aragon, assistant director of the
Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University in
Miami, has been reading about how Cuba won its independence and what
ensued.</TE>
<TE>   Following the defeat of Spain in the Spanish-American War, the
United States occupied the island. At midday on May 20, 1902, an
American general formally transferred power to Cuba's first
president, Tomas Estrada Palma. For years afterward, under an
amendment that Washington insisted be added to Cuba's constitution,
the United States intervened in the island's affairs when it deemed
its own national interests at risk.</TE>
<TE>   "In a way," De Aragon said, "it's sad that 100 years after the
independence of Cuba that Cubans both on the island and here are
still so attentive to what presidents of the United States say Cuba
should be and do."</TE>

<HD>Exhaust Legislation May Hit a Red Light</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Legislation to make California the first state to regulate tailpipe
emissions of greenhouse gases, a suspected cause of global warming,
is foundering in the Assembly amid a lobbying and advertising blitz
by automakers, car dealers, oil companies and organized labor.</LD>
<LD>   The measure by Assemblywoman Fran Pavley (D-Agoura Hills) has
already cleared both houses by rail-thin margins and needs only final
approval of the Assembly to reach the desk of Gov. Gray Davis. But to
the dismay of the environmental groups behind the legislation,
support is eroding, and the bill may now be defeated.</LD>
<LD>   In a well-funded campaign of television, radio and newspaper ads,
opponents have portrayed it as an un-American attempt to force soccer
moms from their beloved SUVs into smaller, less safe vehicles that
will hurt the economy and cost workers their jobs. Many of the
commercials feature Cal Worthington, the colorful California car
dealer whose offbeat television ads with his "dog Spot"--usually a
tiger, elephant or some other beast--made him a cult figure.</LD>
<TE>   The result has been a flood of calls, letters and e-mails to
legislators from voters worried that their cars of choice could soon
be endangered--and flip-flops from some Republican and Democratic
legislators whose swing votes Pavley was counting on for victory.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had a change of heart on this issue," said Assemblyman Tom
Harman (R-Huntington Beach), a moderate who touts his environmental
credentials and got 500 calls one week from angry constituents. "SUVs
and light trucks are very popular in Southern California, and people
don't want to lose the ability to ride these vehicles,
notwithstanding the fact that they are polluters and gas guzzlers."</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists call the campaign wildly misleading, saying it
features claims of tax increases and higher prices at the pump that
have little basis in reality. But they say they have grown accustomed
to scare tactics from the auto industry, which used similar arguments
to fight California's pioneering efforts to control air pollution
with unleaded gasoline and catalytic converters, only to be proved
wrong each time.</TE>
<TE>   "I understood they were going to mobilize, but they really do a
disservice to the democratic process by waging a campaign not based
on facts," Pavley said. "That millions of dollars by special interest
groups can deceive and dupe people--if this is the message sent, that
this is how to ... win at any cost, that's a sad commentary."</TE>
<TE>   The Sacramento showdown mirrors--with good reason--the recent
dispute in Washington over tougher federal fuel efficiency standards
that resulted in a victory for automakers. The easiest known way to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions in cars is to produce more
fuel-efficient vehicles, so that would be the likely result of the
California legislation.</TE>
<TE>   "It really is an attempt to regulate fuel economy on new motor
vehicles; make no bones about it," said Ray Buttacavoli, a lobbyist
for General Motors.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, it has major national repercussions, not only because
Californians buy more cars than anyone else and shape the automobile
market, but because under federal law, only California can pass
higher air pollution standards than those set in Washington. Other
states can then choose California's standards, but they cannot be the
first to surpass those set by the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with such restrictions, car dealers contend, automakers will
restrict the number of models offered in California.</TE>
<TE>   "All the Suburbans they don't sell here they will sell in Texas,
and there will be just as much emissions of CO2; only Californians
will have less choice and more expensive cars," said Peter Welch of
the California Motor Car Dealers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, do not directly form
smog or otherwise imperil human health; in fact, they are some of the
basic building blocks of life on the planet. But carbon dioxide
absorbs heat from the sun, and as excessive amounts are released into
the atmosphere from human activities such as burning fossil fuels, it
helps form a warm blanket of air around the planet that leads to
global warming, scientists believe.</TE>
<TE>   Though that problem remains an abstraction to many, some
scientists say it is beginning to have effects that are hitting home
in California.</TE>
<TE>   In perhaps the most serious example, research shows that the
Sierra snowpack, the concentration of mountain snowfall that feeds
the state's reservoirs and trickles south as it melts during the
summer, is becoming smaller because of global warming. That could
eventually affect the supply of water to the state's agricultural
heartland and growing urban centers.</TE>
<TE>   "People come to California because of the beauty of the
environment, the oldest and tallest trees in the world, the scenic
beaches with sea lions--and all those species are threatened by
global warming," said Peter Miller, a scientist with the Natural
Resources Defense Council.</TE>
<TE>   "It's critical that California take leadership on this issue," he
added. "California has always been a leader in technology that not
only benefits the state, but eventually the nation and the entire
world."</TE>
<TE>   Pavley's legislation, AB 1058, attempts to address the problem in
sweeping fashion. Rather than stating how the emissions would be
reduced in automobiles and trucks, it directs the California Air
Resources Board to come up with regulations that "achieve the maximum
feasible reduction of greenhouse gases" by 2005. The new standards
would apply to all vehicles from model year 2009 forward.</TE>
<TE>   That hazy mandate frightens the auto industry. Though the measure
balances its call for maximum reduction with assurances that the
regulations should not outlaw any vehicle types, including sport
utilities, or place uneconomical demands on car owners, opponents
cite a recent report by the air board and the state's Energy
Commission as a peek into what the measure might bring.</TE>
<TE>   The report on ways to reduce petroleum use mentioned raising
gasoline taxes, reducing speed limits and taxing the number of miles
traveled. None of those ideas is mentioned in Pavley's bill, and in
fact, the air board does not have the power to raise taxes.
Nonetheless, they are the basis for the more sensational accusations
in the opposition ad campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, "the proponents were able to debate the issue in the
abstract: Global warming is a problem; we need to do something about
it," said Phil Isenberg, a former Sacramento mayor and legislator who
is the spokesman for the opposition campaign. "They have proven far
less effective on the technical questions of how this would actually
work."</TE>
<TE>   The recent report, he added, "makes politicians nervous, because
they see this is not only about taxes, but about the air board
designing cars and everything that goes with that."</TE>
<TE>   With support from the Legislature's leaders, Assembly Speaker Herb
Wesson (D-Culver City) and state Senate President Pro Tempore John
Burton (D-San Francisco), Pavley was able earlier this year to
navigate past strong Republican opposition to get her measure through
both houses.</TE>
<TE>   But she appears to have hit a wall. Largely because of the
high-pressure lobbying against her bill by the United Auto Workers
union and others, the legislation has languished in the Assembly for
two weeks. To pass, every bill in the Legislature must obtain a
second, final approval from the house in which it originated.</TE>
<TE>   Two moderate Republicans who voted for the measure in January,
Orange County's Harman and David Kelley of Idyllwild, have reversed
their positions. So have two business-friendly Democrats: Joe
Canciamilla of Pittsburg and John Dutra of Fremont. Pavley had vowed
to take up the bill last Thursday, but backed down as UAW
representatives in union jackets patrolled the Capitol's hallways.
Without their votes, the measure--which received 42 votes the first
time around--would fall short of the 41 needed for passage.</TE>
<TE>   "I was never in love with the bill in the first place,"
Canciamilla said, adding that he voted for the measure in January as
a favor to Democratic leaders, but always made clear that he would
reserve judgment until later. "This is simply pressure to get the
automakers to build more hybrids, and if that is the case, they
should just come at it clean."</TE>
<TE>   Some lawmakers privately say the fight over the measure, the most
significant heard thus far this year in Sacramento, is proving to be
a test of Wesson's clout as speaker. But he plays down his powers,
saying that the days of speakers twisting arms and bullying
colleagues ended with the arrival of term limits.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's important for California," Wesson said. "But I am
not Attila the Hun. This is a different office in a different time,
and I think everyone has to be treated with respect.</TE>
<TE>   "I personally don't know if things can be 'speakerized' anymore."</TE>

<HD>Longtime TV Anchor, Known From 'the Desert to the Sea,'
Dies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BRAXTON and BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jerry Dunphy, one of the most recognizable and popular news anchors
in Los Angeles for more than four decades with his trademark line,
"From the desert to the sea to all of Southern California," has died.</LD>
<LD>   He was guarded about his age but admitted to being at least 80.</LD>
<LD>   Dunphy, who had undergone heart bypass surgery in 1978, suffered a
heart attack Wednesday in front of his Wilshire Boulevard condominium
and had been hospitalized. KCAL-TV Channel 9, where Dunphy was one of
the main anchors, announced his death Monday night.</LD>
<TE>   "Anchors come and go, but Jerry Dunphy is a Los Angeles
institution," said Joe Saltzman, Associate Dean of the USC Annenberg
School of Communication. Saltzman worked with Dunphy during the 1960s
at KNXT (now KCBS) on the pioneering "The Big News," one of the first
local TV newscasts in the country to run one hour each night.
"Viewers were very loyal to him."</TE>
<TE>   In a prepared statement, Dunphy's family said he "served as a
constant beacon of truth and guidance in our ever-changing world."</TE>
<TE>   With his distinctive white hair and deep voice, Dunphy was one of
the key anchors for some of Los Angeles' most innovative TV news
formats. In the 1960s and for half of the 1970s, he was primary
anchor for "The Big News." In 1975, he moved to KABC-TV Channel 7,
where he was an anchor for the "Eyewitness News" format, which mixed
titillating stories with friendly banter.</TE>
<TE>   John Severino, the former KABC general manager who brought Dunphy
to the station in 1975 and is godfather to his teenage daugher, said
Dunphy was "a throwback to the glory days of broadcasting."</TE>
<TE>   "When he did 'The Big News,' there was NBC, CBS and half of ABC.
He owned the market," Severino said.</TE>
<TE>   At KNXT, the station's news routinely attracted nearly 25% of
homes in the Los Angeles area, beating the competing stations
combined.</TE>
<TE>   When Dunphy's contract came up for renewal, Severino told Russ
Barry, who was running KNXT, that he had no interest in hiring
Dunphy. "I said, 'He's over the hill, we wouldn't want him," Severino
said, later telling Barry after he had signed Dunphy to KABC, "I
lied."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview conducted during the 1990s, Dunphy attributed his
longevity in the precarious world of local TV news to "a certain
amount of, dare I say it, credibility that I've established. Or maybe
because they are accustomed to this old face."</TE>
<TE>   The newsman had worked at KCAL since 1997, his second stint at the
station.</TE>
<TE>   Though he was praised for his journalism, Dunphy was regarded,
particularly in his earlier local career, as one of the best
newsreaders in the business.</TE>
<TE>   "He's probably the best reader I ever worked with," said Saltzman,
who was a news writer for "The Big News." "In those days, a writer
really wanted a good reader. It was like having a great layout in the
newspaper. Jerry had beautiful pitch, and he put a story over with
conviction and intelligence. There was no pretense about it."</TE>
<TE>   Saltzman added, "It tends to sound degrading when you say a person
is a great reader, but it's the highest of compliments. There are a
lot of very good anchors, but not that many good readers."</TE>
<TE>   Dunphy was often candid about his views on news, once criticizing
KABC while he worked there, accusing the station of diluting its
newscast with trivia. He also said that the station sensationalized
stories with little substance, and that a credible journalist "has to
compromise in the name of good business."</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to respond to what the public is going to watch if
you're going to get the [big] number," Dunphy said in a 1984
interview on "Inside Story," the public television series about the
news media. "Ratings are a real important part of the business."</TE>
<TE>   He added during the interview that "there are a lot of things on
television today that wouldn't have been put on 10 or 12 years ago--a
lot of entertainment information, a lot of little stories that could
easily go without telling but [which] have a certain amount of appeal
to them."</TE>
<TE>   "Whether they're good news stories or not--that's something else,"
Dunphy added. "We've diluted the product somewhat to getting where we
are. And sometimes being No. 1 and having something like that
succeed, keeps you ... doing it."</TE>
<TE>   He would reflect on his earlier career, saying "The Big News" was
a particularly exciting time.</TE>
<TE>   "There just wasn't any of the flimflam that you see today because
it just wasn't necessary, because there was no competition," Dunphy
said in a 1993 interview with The Times. The interview preceded his
receipt of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences' Los
Angeles-area Governors Award, the group's most prestigious honor, as
part of the local Emmys.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as the competition set in, things got a little frothier,
promotions get a little flakier."</TE>
<TE>   He would tell how he was paid $25,000 a year when first starting
as an anchor and reporter at KNXT.</TE>
<TE>   He was one of the first local newsmen to report from Vietnam in
1966. Dunphy in 1979 nabbed the first extended live television
interview with Richard Nixon since the former president left office
in 1974--a dialogue Times columnist Howard Rosenberg called "soft, an
interview suffering from a bad case of the squishies."</TE>
<TE>   Dunphy first joined KCAL in 1989 when the station was acquired and
renamed by the Walt Disney Company. KCAL lured Dunphy away from KABC
to be the centerpiece of the station's groundbreaking three-hour
prime-time news block. He was rumored to have received a contract
worth an estimated $5 million over five years.</TE>
<TE>   His departure from KABC was also due to his unhappiness when the
station gave anchor Paul Moyer (who has since moved to KNBC-TV
Channel 4) a lucrative contract while denying Dunphy some of those
benefits and perks, including allowance for a company car.</TE>
<TE>   Dunphy went back to KCBS in 1994 when KCAL allowed his
$1.3-million-a-year contract to expire. He was unable to help that
station's struggling ratings, and he returned to KCAL in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   He experienced more than his share of personal drama. Dunphy
suffered his first heart attack in 1978, undergoing multiple bypass
surgery. Four years later, he was robbed at gunpoint by thieves who
broke into his home, tied him up, stole an estimated $13,000 in cash
and jewelry, and drove off in his Rolls-Royce.</TE>
<TE>   In 1983, he was shot in the neck and wrist by gang members who
robbed him. The woman he was with, KABC makeup artist Sandra
Marshall, was also injured. Marshall, 26 years younger than Dunphy,
later became his second wife.</TE>
<TE>   He suffered another heart attack in 1991, which again resulted in
a multiple-bypass procedure.</TE>
<TE>   Dunphy was also known outside his local anchor duties. In addition
to appearing in numerous films as an anchor, Dunphy served as one of
the inspirations for the blustery Ted Baxter character on the classic
TV comedy "The Mary Tyler Moore Show."</TE>
<TE>   He was "one of the most dynamic and popular newscasters in the
history of the business," said KTLA-TV Channel 5 "News at 10" anchor
and managing editor Hal Fishman, who has been a local anchor since
1960.</TE>
<TE>   He also was "a serious journalist, which contrasts with the fun
and games that permeates much of local journalism," Fishman said.</TE>
<TE>   Dunphy was born in Milwaukee and attended the University of
Wisconsin.</TE>
<TE>   After starting his career in Peoria, Ill., in 1947, he briefly
moved to Southern California, but struggled to find work. Two years
later, he took a radio job in Davenport, Iowa, where he met and
married his first wife.</TE>
<TE>   Dunphy had a daughter with Marshall and five children from his
first marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral arrangements are pending.</TE>

<HD>FBI Expects Suicide Bomb Attack in U.S.</HD>
<DH>Security: Agency chief Mueller says terrorist acts similar
to those in Israel are 'inevitable.' The concerns are prompted by a
flood of recent intelligence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>FBI Director Robert Mueller, voicing fears sparked by recently
gathered intelligence, said Monday it is "inevitable" that suicide
bombers like those who have blown up scores of Israelis will kill
Americans on U.S. soil.</LD>
<LD>   Federal authorities said they also believe terrorists could be
renting rooms in U.S. apartment buildings so they can detonate
explosives and take down the structures.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities have issued interagency warnings about that threat, as
well as a formal "notification" that 25 or so Islamic militants may
have entered the country in recent weeks as stowaways on container
ships from Central America, intent on committing a terrorist act,
according to U.S. officials.</LD>
<TE>   Asked about the possibility of a suicide bombing attack similar to
those used against Israelis in recent months, Mueller told a meeting
of the National Assn. of District Attorneys: "I think we will see
that in the future; I think it's inevitable."</TE>
<TE>   Mueller also said: "There will be another terrorist attack. We
will not be able to stop it. It's something we all live with."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI director said such suicide bombings are nearly impossible
to stop because of the secretive and insular nature of Islamic
terrorist organizations and the difficulty that authorities have had
in trying to infiltrate them. "I wish I could be more optimistic," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller's speech before the prosecutors' group at a convention in
suburban Washington was closed to the press. The FBI would not
comment on the accuracy of the remarks, which were reported by
Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller's remarks were confirmed by a Justice Department official,
who also said authorities believe the threat of such a suicide
bombing attack in the near future is very real, and based on an
accumulation of recent intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know when," said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. "All we know is it is consistent with patterns we have
seen overseas and with information we have been receiving over the
last few weeks."</TE>
<TE>   Mueller's comments marked his first public confirmation of such a
U.S. threat by a suicide bomber. But one federal law enforcement
official said the nation's counter-terrorism apparatus has quietly
been on high alert for the last three weeks, when a flood of
intelligence--and information gathered during interrogations of Al
Qaeda operatives--appeared to indicate that such an attack may be in
the works.</TE>
<TE>   Vice President Dick Cheney hinted Sunday during a television talk
show that he sees "a real possibility" that walk-in suicide bombers
may strike in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks ago, the FBI issued a federal law enforcement alert to
all federal, state and local police agencies to be on the lookout for
possible attacks at banks. One law enforcement official confirmed
Monday that the warning specifically mentioned "suicide operatives."</TE>
<TE>   "The bank alert was Friday, then on Monday, it was malls" that
authorities believed might be the target of a terrorist attack, the
official said. "They put it all together and said, 'Whoa.' ... When
you start having a few weeks like the last few weeks, it raises the
level of concern" even higher than it had been.</TE>
<TE>   A major reason for the concern, as the Israeli government has
learned, is that no amount of preparedness can stop such bombers--not
swarms of police patrols, stepped-up border enforcement or increased
intelligence-gathering missions.</TE>
<TE>   In most cases, one person armed with less than a handful of
plastic explosives can walk into a public gathering, flick a
detonation switch and kill dozens of people, as was the case March 27
in Netanya, Israel.</TE>
<TE>   That law enforcement official and other authorities said the
intelligence intercepts were gathered by U.S. and allied governments
by monitoring phones and cell phones, Internet exchanges and other
communications, and that the volume of such "chatter" has spiked
remarkably in the last three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, such dramatic increases--even if vague--have preceded
large-scale terrorist attacks, including the Sept. 11 suicide
skyjackings, according to those officials.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, the law enforcement official said the intelligence
has not specified an exact time or place of any planned attack; nor
did the threats about attacks on apartment buildings and terrorists
stowing away on container ships.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the official said, "the increased chatter, and the
quantity and nature of the information, has been increasingly
disturbing over the last few weeks, on a number of fronts."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities confirmed that much of the intelligence involved
suicide bombings by individual members of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's
terrorist network, which authorities believe is rebuilding and
redeploying after the punishing military strikes at its former base
in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   One alleged Al Qaeda terrorist, Richard C. Reid, allegedly tried
to blow up a commercial airliner over the Atlantic in December by
trying to ignite plastic explosives hidden in his sneaker, Mueller
noted Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The intelligence gathered by U.S. and allied counter-terrorism
agencies in the last three weeks also appeared to refer to suicide
bombers driving cars, trucks or even boats up to targets and
detonating them, one federal law enforcement official said.</TE>
<TE>   For that reason, the nationwide law enforcement warning three
weeks ago about banks did not specify whether attackers would come by
foot or by vehicle, as was the case when Al Qaeda soldiers used
trucks to blow up two U.S. embassies in Africa in 1998, killing 224
people.</TE>
<TE>   "They were careful to not say it could be just someone walking
into a bank, but also [that it could be] a truck bomb," one official
said.</TE>
<TE>   Two truck bombings occurred in recent weeks in Pakistan and
Tunisia. Authorities believe Al Qaeda was behind the blast in Tunisia
that killed 19 people at a Jewish synagogue, and they are
investigating whether terrorists affiliated with Bin Laden were
involved in the Pakistan blast, which killed 19 people May 8 at a
hotel frequented by Western visitors.</TE>
<TE>   Counter-terrorism experts in and out of government said Mueller is
extremely concerned about the potential damage wrought by such
suicide bombers. They concurred that such "walk-ins" will probably
launch the next attack within the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been saying this for some time.... It is just so easy to
do," said Robert Blitzer, the FBI's counter-terrorism chief until
1998, who has studied Al Qaeda extensively.</TE>
<TE>   "They were able to recruit 19 guys who were willing to give up
their lives. What's to say there aren't another 20 guys already out
there, ready to give their lives as well?"</TE>
<TE>   Al Qaeda's own operatives have told authorities that they were
trained in how to launch such suicide bombings during their
attendance at Bin Laden's terrorist camps in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   One of them, Ahmed Ressam, constructed enough homemade explosives
and timers to take down a relatively large building; he was stopped
by a U.S. Customs agent on his way to detonate a suitcase full of
explosives at Los Angeles International Airport in December 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "They have all had training in this. Over many years, there was a
lot of training in Afghanistan, in Al Qaeda camps, that ranged from
small arms to all kinds of explosives using vehicles and people,"
Blitzer said.</TE>
<TE>   "Just as Israel has found with Hamas, these are religious fanatics
who have nothing to live for except to go out in a blaze of glory and
come out as martyrs. And that is what they're doing."</TE>

<LD>WASHINGTON STATE</LD>
<LD>   The sexual relationship between sixth-grade teacher Mary Kay
Letourneau and one of her students could not have been prevented by
the school district or local police, a civil jury ruled in Kent,
Wash. Letourneau was 34 and former student Vili Fualaau was 12 when
the relationship began in the spring of 1996. Letourneau gave birth
to two daughters fathered by Fualaau and was sentenced to seven years
in prison for child rape.</LD>
<LD>   Monday's verdict followed a nine-week trial in which Fualaau's
lawyer argued that the school district and police should have picked
up on clues to the relationship. Fualaau was not in court when the
verdict was read. His mother and co-plaintiff, Soona Vili, sighed
deeply. Fualaau's attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr., said no decision had
been made on an appeal.</LD>

<TE>   Democrats are considering moving their 2004 national convention to
a later date after learning Republicans plan to hold their gathering
in late August or early September.</TE>
<TE>   It's a scheduling dance aimed at getting the most mileage out of a
convention in the polls and making the best use of federal campaign
money that becomes available to both sides after nominees are chosen.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Cardona, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National
Committee, said "the fact that the Republicans are looking at these
late dates" prompted Democrats to consider starting their meeting on
Aug. 30. "We are looking at all of our options," she said.</TE>

<DL>CANNES, France</DL>
<LD>Harvey Weinstein, the pugnacious co-chairman of Miramax Films, jumps
aside as Leonardo DiCaprio and his security detail rampage down the
hall of the Palais at the international film festival here.</LD>
<LD>   "Harvey Weinstein!" a photographer calls out. The burly
businessman stops and smiles before deftly ducking to the side to
avoid being crushed by the DiCaprio phalanx.</LD>
<LD>   This is the kind of media attention that Weinstein craves, the
kind that can boost his prized "Gangs of New York" to box-office
success and quell what was at first a whispering campaign and now is
open speculation over the commercial and artistic well-being of the
$100-million movie.</LD>
<TE>   To turn around expectations on a film that is a year late to the
theaters, Weinstein and the film's director, Martin Scorsese, on
Monday presented a 20-minute "extended preview" of the violent
revenge epic to an enthusiastic crowd here.</TE>
<TE>   "Gangs of New York"--with its star power, its larger-than-life
personalities and the small fortune that international investors have
staked on the project--has become the talk of Cannes 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Fueling the anticipation and speculation is the fact that "Gangs
of New York" is exactly the kind of movie that franchise-mad
Hollywood has all but given up making: big, expensive, potentially
artistic and with absolutely no possibilities for action dolls or
Happy Meals.</TE>
<TE>   It's the film many studios turned down. It not only arrives late
but also carries the stigma of being a package from the late and
oft-reviled firm of Michael Ovitz, as well as the imprimatur of
Weinstein, a divisive figure in his own right.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the 1928 book by Herbert Asbury, the film, now scheduled
for a Christmas Day release, is set in the grimy criminal underworld
of New York before the Civil War. It tells the story of a young Irish
immigrant (DiCaprio) seeking to avenge his father's death at the hand
of a nativist gang leader, Bill the Butcher, played by Daniel Day
Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   Although Hollywood is notoriously adept at crafting stunning
20-minute trailers, the slice of "Gangs" shown here was visually
extravagant and promised 19th century gang warfare and a certain
amount of "Titanic"-size love story. (In one scene, hellcat
pickpocket Jenny Deane, played by Cameron Diaz, tries to bite the
nose off DiCaprio before landing him instead in a lip lock.)</TE>
<TE>   As he guided his crew from their news conference to their waiting
limousines, Weinstein seemed elated. "I don't know what people are
going to tell me," he said. "But afterward we had a 20-minute
interlude, and people were walking over saying they were blown away.
It helps when you see the scope of the production. People naturally
have questions why it took so long, and when they see it, they go,
'OK, I get it.'"</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the amount of time and money invested, the personalities
themselves have provoked a certain amount of interest and intrigue.</TE>
<TE>   At the news conference, Scorsese and Weinstein made an elaborate
show of amicability to dispel the tales of ill will and on-set
battles. They called each other "Marty" and "Harve," with Scorsese
explaining their differences by saying, "I'm an excitable guy," and
Weinstein taking swipes at the media. "You guys keep writing about
this project. This is an attempt at art," he roared.</TE>
<TE>   This past year has hardly been Weinstein's finest. He was forced
to fold his Talk magazine, at a cost of $27 million to the company,
slash his staff by 75 and go home to New York without his usual batch
of Oscars. The fact that the budget for Weinstein's film is
big--officially $97 million, but at least $115 million by the
unofficial speculation--makes other studio executives shake their
heads.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't deny his anxiety. Holed up in a tiny elevator between
floors of the Palais, Weinstein said: "I never get nervous before a
presentation like this. This is the first time I've ever gotten
nervous. It's so personal to me, this movie."</TE>
<TE>   DiCaprio, Diaz and Scorsese are the major players on the film's
artistic side. But Graham King is the film's major financial player.</TE>
<TE>   Little-known in the U.S., King is the chairman of the Initial
Entertainment Group, an overseas-distribution company, which shelled
out $67 million for the foreign rights to the picture. This is the
other part of the show at Cannes, where the people who put up the
money for the films get to see what they paid for--and to hobnob with
the stars.</TE>
<TE>   All evening King has been looming around the periphery of the
"Gangs" core. Yet the strapping Englishman is paying close to $1
million for this presentation and following dinner, as well as for
hotel rooms at the $1,000-a-night Hotel du Cap and the private jet
for DiCaprio and Diaz. He has also invited to the presentation all
his buyers, the 200 or so distributors from around the world, all of
whom paid record prices for the rights to distribute Scorsese's
vision of "the worst place on Earth" in Bangkok, Beirut and beyond.</TE>
<TE>   The Film the Studios Turned Down</TE>
<TE>   For the American studios, the decision to pass on co-financing
"Gangs of New York" seemed something of a no-brainer. The script was
ultra-violent, and Scorsese, for all his filmmaking laurels, is
considered risky, at best, at the box office.</TE>
<TE>   King, whose largest picture to date had been the Robert Altman
film "Dr. T and the Women," was ecstatic when he heard that he might
be able to buy into this picture.</TE>
<TE>   "For me to bring [these distributors] a Leonardo DiCaprio picture
is huge, because Leo only goes through studios. For us, we wanted to
be in the big boys' game, and this was a way to start."</TE>
<TE>   As word got around before Cannes, he said, "it was like a
circus.... The Koreans, the Swedish, the Malaysians are coming over
to me, 'Do you really have Leo?'"</TE>
<TE>   'Hate and Love ... and Leonardo and Cameron'</TE>
<TE>   Unlike some American studios that were worried about the violence
(an R rating would cut down the audience significantly from a PG-13),
this was not a problem overseas.</TE>
<TE>   "There's violence, and then there's violence. There's Marty
violence, and then there's Schwarzenegger violence," King said. "A
lot of countries don't differentiate. They call it action. Action is
action. Everyone wants action."</TE>
<TE>   "The film has action in it. It opens in a big gang war in New York
and ends in a draft riot," said Scorsese, sounding a bit put out that
foreign audiences might not differentiate between his moral,
political examination of violence and a regular shoot-'em-up.</TE>
<TE>   "I do know one thing foreign audiences might be interested to see
is this particular depiction of America at a time when the country
was still young and defining itself.... That might be something,
along with rousing characters you love to hate and love [along with]
personal conflict, and Leonardo and Cameron."</TE>
<TE>   And as the talk turned to commercial success, the question lurking
behind all speculative chatter in Cannes, the director sighed.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I make a movie, it's been a crapshoot. What does it
mean to be successful? 'Spider-Man' is successful. Is that the figure
we have to reach? This is the biggest budget I have ever worked with.
We have a lot of hope for the picture and embrace the movie and love
it, but it's a movie by me."</TE>

<HD>INS Error Cited on Atta's Visa</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. authorities now believe the Immigration and Naturalization
Service may have improperly allowed terrorist ringleader Mohamed Atta
to reenter the United States eight months before the Sept. 11
hijackings despite questions about his visa status, officials said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   That suspicion, contained in a new Justice Department
investigative report, offers the first indication that any of the 19
hijackers may have come into the country improperly, and it raises
new questions about the INS' ability to secure the borders from
terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   Previously, all of the Sept. 11 hijackers were thought to have
entered the country through proper channels, using tourist, business
and student visas to adeptly navigate the labyrinthine U.S.
immigration system.</LD>
<TE>   But the new report questions whether Atta, who piloted American
Airlines Flight 11 into the World Trade Center's north tower, should
have been turned back at the U.S. entry point in Miami in January
2001 because his application for a student visa had not yet been
approved.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department Inspector General's office, which issued
the report, was unable to reach definitive conclusions, and it found
that INS policies generally were followed in Atta's case. But the
report said the issue was symptomatic of widespread flaws in the INS'
poor handling of the hundreds of thousands of foreigners who study in
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a laxity in the system," Inspector General Glenn Fine
said in an interview. "This shows [that the INS] did not scrutinize
students closely at the time and did not consider them to be a big
risk."</TE>
<TE>   The findings are sure to intensify efforts to impose major
structural changes upon the INS. A firestorm engulfed the agency in
March when it notified a Florida flight school that it had approved
student visas for Atta and fellow hijacker Marwan Al-Shehhi. The
notification came six months after they had become infamous for their
roles in the Sept. 11 attacks--and eight months after the INS
actually had approved their visas. Al-Shehhi is believed to have
piloted United Flight 175 into the south tower.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to questions about whether Atta should have been
allowed to return to the United States, investigators found other
potential trouble spots in the INS' handling of his case and that of
Al-Shehhi. The problems often involved poor coordination and
incomplete information to field employees:</TE>
<TE>   * INS employees who were considering applications from Atta and
Al-Shehhi for student visas did not realize that the two men had
already completed their flight training in Florida while their
applications were pending. "If the adjudicator had full information,
he should have denied their applications," investigators found.</TE>
<TE>   * Although a warrant for Atta's arrest was issued on June 4 in
Florida because of his failure to appear in court for a traffic
ticket, INS inspectors allowed him to reenter the country six weeks
later because that information was not available on their computer
system.</TE>
<TE>   * At one point during Atta's stay in the United States, he was
given a visa for eight months instead of the standard six months. An
eight-month visa would have allowed him to remain through Sept. 8,
2001. Not until Atta went to an immigration office in Miami in May of
that year to try to get an eight-month stay for an unidentified
companion did officials realize the apparent error and reduce the
length of his visa to six months.</TE>
<TE>   But in July his application for a student visa was approved,
allowing him to stay in the country through October.</TE>
<TE>   Although Atta and Al-Shehhi were in the United States legally on
Sept. 11 as a result of their active visas, three of the other 17
hijackers had overstayed their visas, immigration officials say.</TE>
<TE>   INS officials said they were gratified that the inspector general
had not identified any clear violations of department policy in the
handling of Atta and Al-Shehhi, and they said they are already moving
to correct problems identified in the report.</TE>
<TE>   But congressional critics--and even the INS' bosses at the Justice
Department--were less forgiving.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, said he found the inspector general's findings "deeply
disturbing."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.), chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee, said the report reflects a "dramatic failure" of
INS management "to provide clear guidance, policies and procedures to
its front-line employees."</TE>
<TE>   And Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, who oversees the INS, said the
report "reinforces the need" for fundamental changes in the way the
agency regulates the visas of foreign students. He said the Justice
Department will "redouble our efforts to move the INS' reporting
systems into the 21st century" by vastly expanding data that U.S.
schools are required to send the INS about their foreign students.</TE>
<TE>   But the inspector general's office concluded that the INS is
unlikely to be able to meet the ambitious Jan. 30 deadline set for
that overhaul.</TE>
<TE>   Fine noted that the INS would have to recertify 72,000 U.S.
universities, colleges and vocational schools in a matter of months
for that plan to become fully operational. "That's a monumental
task.... We think it's unlikely to happen," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The report offers perhaps the most detailed reconstruction to date
of the global travels of Atta and Al-Shehhi in the months leading up
to the hijackings, as each entered the country three separate times
in apparent preparation for the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Atta, in his first trip out of the country, left Miami for Spain
on Jan. 4, 2001, and returned to Miami six days later. He had already
applied to change his visa from tourist to student status so he could
attend flight school in Florida. When Atta returned to Miami
International Airport, an INS inspector raised questions about his
status.</TE>
<TE>   By leaving the country while his student visa application was
pending, Atta had effectively abandoned his application under INS
policy. The inspector in Miami concluded that he would need a student
visa to reenter and sent his case to another inspector at the airport
for more extensive questioning, according to the inspector general's
report.</TE>
<TE>   The second inspector apparently believed--erroneously--that Atta's
change to a student visa had already been approved. "We do not know
how the secondary inspector could have come to that conclusion
because the request had not been approved at that time and INS
databases would not have reflected the approval until many months
later," the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Still unclear is exactly what Atta told the second inspector. If
he told him he was studying at flight school only part time, he would
have been allowed into the country under then-INS policy, officials
said. But if he said he was studying full time, that should have
barred his reentry unless he received a waiver for an "unforeseen
emergency," investigators found.</TE>
<TE>   "Should he have gotten in? That's the hard question," Fine said.
"If he said [to the inspector] that he's attending school full time,
then he needed a student visa, which he didn't have. But we don't
know what he said, and neither does the inspector."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Strassberger, a spokesman for the INS, said Atta's January
2001 reentry to the country "could be problematic, but it was not
improper. A decision was made based on the information the inspector
had available to him, which is something that happens many times a
day around the country, and it was enough to allow [Atta] in," he
said. "There was no information at the time that [Atta or Al-Shehhi]
were terrorists or intended to do harm."</TE>

<HD>Bonanza for Art of the West</HD>
<DH>Paintings and sculptures of the frontier are spurring a new
kind of gold rush. So what if the New York critics find it appalling?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PASO ROBLES, Calif.</DL>
<LD>The county cattlemen's association's annual sale is about to begin.
As dusk falls on the Mid-State Fairgrounds, two men stand practicing
lariat tosses, a barbecue drum belches tri-tip smoke, and a crowd
collects in the exhibition hall, thick with Stetsons and Wranglers
and leather fringe. The scene is everything a city slicker would
imagine, except that the cattlemen aren't here to sell cattle.</LD>
<LD>   They're here for the art.</LD>
<LD>   "Amazing," says one browser, admiring a stylized steer.</LD>
<TE>   "The color!" says another, standing before a desert landscape.</TE>
<TE>   In the unlikely event that you could haul an art critic or curator
into this room, the 100-plus paintings and sculptures might well
inspire scorn or giggles. But these artworks sell. Within minutes of
the sale's 7 p.m. opening, red dots are turning up next to oil
paintings priced at $6,000 and $7,000.</TE>
<TE>   Americans are buying Western art--pictures and sculptures of
cowboys, Indians, ranch animals and the landscapes that sustain
them--at a startling rate, paying prices that stretch into six and
seven figures. In Los Angeles, the take of the Autry Museum of
Western Heritage's annual Western art sale has grown since 1998 from
$350,000 to $1.4 million. In Reno, the annual Coeur D'Alene Art
Auction jumped from $8 million in sales in 2000 to $14 million in
2001. In Oklahoma City, where the National Cowboy and Western
Heritage Museum's annual Prix de West sale has doubled its revenue in
the last seven years, a June sale of about 275 paintings and
sculptures fetched $2.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   This doesn't mean the Western art wagon train is about to roll
over Monet, Van Gogh or Picasso. But a New West subculture has
collected around this Old West imagery. Its mostly male ranks are
populated at one extreme by genuine ranchers who want their interiors
to match their outdoor lives, and at the other by wealthy indoorsmen
looking to illustrate their dreams of escape.</TE>
<TE>   "It's no-nonsense art," says Margaret L. Brown, editor of
Houston-based Southwest Art magazine. "You don't have to explain it
or figure it out. It is what it is."</TE>
<TE>   In this world, cell phones may be sheathed in leather holsters,
mustaches are often waxed, and belt buckles make fashion statements.
Cowboys and Indians do business side by side. And though nobody can
fully explain an art boom, insiders and outsiders naturally have
their theories.</TE>
<TE>   "It represents a clearer, simpler kind of life," says David
Pereira, a San Luis Obispo rancher on the art show committee.</TE>
<TE>   And it may be no coincidence that Western art is booming just as
an unprecedented number of vacation homes are rising in Jackson Hole,
Wyo.; Sun Valley, Idaho; and other Western resort towns. "They don't
want modern art," says Bob Drummond, co-founder of the Reno-based
Coeur D'Alene auction. "They want Western paintings to fit their
decor."</TE>
<TE>   Not every big-time aficionado, however, is merely filling wall
space in a new cabin. Look, for instance, at the walls of John and
Sara Lynn Geraghty. John Geraghty, 72, retired from the automotive
business in the mid-1990s and has been running the American West Fine
Art Exhibition and Sale at the Autry museum since 1998. Two hundred
paintings and drawings hang in his comfortable Glendale home.</TE>
<TE>   Geraghty, sporting a bolo tie and boots, looks at his collection
like a teacher inspecting prize students.</TE>
<TE>   "The cream comes to the top," Geraghty says. "When a piece can
tell a story, it's going to last longer, and it's got more value."</TE>
<TE>   Geraghty points out the impressionistic scenes in the dining room,
the wildlife in the master bedroom, the color values in a misty scene
by Richard Schmid of an Alaskan salmon trawler.</TE>
<TE>   He pauses in the den, at "Army Regulations," which shows four
Indians on horses. "It's not photorealism," Geraghty says. "It's
real, honest-to-God masterful art. Look at the hint of veins in the
horses' legs."</TE>
<TE>   His view of abstract art: "It's just a scam. I can't appreciate
it. It's hard for me to have a big white canvas with a red dot in the
corner and call it art."</TE>
<TE>   Attention to Detail,</TE>
<TE>   and the Right Costume</TE>
<TE>   Back at the fairgrounds, the Stetsons and Wranglers are jostling,
and Steven Lang is talking about cowboy leggings.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to know when they wore shotgun chaps, and when they
were batwing chaps," says Lang. "You can't use batwing chaps on an
1850s cowboy. I'm trying to paint for the 2% of people who know
that."</TE>
<TE>   Lang, 41, plain-spoken and part Pawnee, wears a cowboy hat --"it's
almost the costume you have to wear," he confesses--and stands in
front of a booth with half a dozen of his canvases. Six years ago, he
was designing characters for a video game company in San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   Now Lang, who lives on the Monterey peninsula, paints Western
scenes full time. The Paso Robles show, which took place April 4 to
6, is a logical place for Lang, whose works often fetch four-figure
prices. The priciest works here are going for $10,000, not the
$100,000 or more often seen in Phoenix, Oklahoma City, Reno and Los
Angeles, not to mention Scottsdale and Santa Fe.</TE>
<TE>   But here, too, signs of rising interest are clear. The San Luis
Obispo County Cattlemen's Assn. moved to Paso Robles this year
because the crowds had grown too big for its home of 11 years, a barn
near the Madonna Inn, outside San Luis Obispo. The change makes room
for more commerce--$75,000 will change hands in the first three
hours--and more stagecraft. Painter Earl Cacho has brought a bear
skin and a steer skull to decorate his booth. Donald "Putt" Putman
has a cowboy model pose while he works on a likeness.</TE>
<TE>   Wayne Justus, the show's featured artist, stands by his work in a
tall hat, a vest, green bandanna and fancy stitched boots. Justus,
who has been doing this for decades, has already sold one painting
for $7,000, a few others for less.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll stay three weeks on end at a ranch in Texas or Arizona,
where they still have chuck wagons on a million acres," he tells
admirers. "A lot of artists will go out there and snap a bunch of
photos, then paint from the photos. I always think they oughtta take
a bedroll along and ride 30 miles a day, so they can know what
they're seeing." Collector Jerry Cowdrey, a landscaper from
Sebastopol and a regular at sales in Los Angeles, Oklahoma City and
Phoenix, lingers near Justus' booth, then pounces at Lang's: He'll
buy a 16-by-20-inch oil, "Cautious Approach," which shows two Plains
Indian hunters hunched under a bison pelt. The price: $4,200.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always been interested in the Western scenes, more the
Native American than the cowboy," says Cowdrey. "I have a lot of
empathy for what they've gone through. And how many paintings can you
have of a cowboy on a horse?"</TE>
<TE>   Even a Remington Can Receive Harsh Criticism</TE>
<TE>   The problem with most Western art, curators and critics say, is
that it's nostalgia-driven illustration that reads like propaganda
for Manifest Destiny. In short, says Albert Boime, a UCLA art history
professor who has written extensively on 19th century American
painting, "it's the tinge of kitsch."</TE>
<TE>   Even the genre's foremost figure takes frequent beatings in
critical circles. When the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York
dared mount a Frederic Remington retrospective in 1989, New York
Times critic John Russell let the artist and curators have it with
both barrels. Remington, wrote Russell, had "a macho, pre-Freudian
and blatantly racist conception of American manhood" and produced
paintings that are "hopelessly labored and inert, secondhand and
second rate."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Hassrick, who co-curated that exhibition and serves as
director emeritus of the University of Oklahoma's Russell Center for
the Study of Art of the American West, notes that Western art's role
has always been problematic. From the time the first images were
carried east from the frontier, Hassrick says, the painters were
viewed as "pictorial storytellers" who illustrated history, or fed
Eastern fantasies, but didn't grapple with truth and beauty in the
established way of the fine artist.</TE>
<TE>   Since World War II, many museums have sprung up to celebrate the
genre, but the country's most revered art institutions continue to
consider 20th century Western realists to be backward-looking and
largely beside the point. In John Geraghty's house or at the Paso
Robles fairgrounds, however, looking backward isn't a flaw, just a
choice.</TE>
<TE>   The market that these venues represent, says Southwest Art
magazine's Brown, grew in the 1960s, surged during the oil boom in
the 1970s, then lagged after the oil bust of the 1980s. These days,
sales of Western art's twin giants, Remington (1861-1909) and Charles
Russell (1864-1926), have never been stronger. In 1999, a Remington
oil sold for $5.2 million; in 2001, a Russell went for $2.3
million--highs for each artist. In general, says Eric P. Widing, head
of the Christie's American art department in New York, Western works
produced before 1950 are "one of the fastest-growing areas in
American painting."</TE>
<TE>   Life is more complicated for living artists. Dealers and
collectors may take notice when a buyer spends $100,000 on a new
work, but the greater commercial test, professionals agree, is what
that work fetches the next time it's sold.</TE>
<TE>   Because there are so many novice collectors--as many as one in
four buyers at Western sales are first-timers--Geraghty and others
warn that prices can rise and fall dramatically. Auction houses like
Christie's and Sotheby's, which happily handle works by living
artists in other genres, steer clear of post-1950 Western works.</TE>
<TE>   In this uncertain landscape, collectors might find comfort in a
reliable brand: the letters "CA." That abbreviation near the artist's
signature can add thousands to a sales price, because it means the
artist is among the 27 men alive who have been invited to join Cowboy
Artists of America.</TE>
<TE>   Since four painters hatched the idea 37 years ago in a Sedona,
Ariz., bar, the members of CA have built a modern medieval guild,
granting membership to the artists they consider most accomplished,
sustaining a museum in Kerrville, Texas, and staging a sale every
fall at the Phoenix Art Museum.</TE>
<TE>   In this group, none outsells a man in Tucson named Howard
Terpning. Raised in Illinois and trained in Chicago, he served as a
New York-based illustrator for magazines and the movie industry in
the 1960s. He created the poster art for "The Sound of Music" and the
re-release of "Gone With the Wind."</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1970s, Terpning moved west and began studying and
painting the Plains Indians. In 1979, he was invited to join the
Cowboy Artists of America, and since then his prices have marked a
remarkable trajectory. In the mid-'70s, recalls Stuart Johnson, owner
of the Settler's West Gallery in Tucson, Terpnings sold for $2,000 to
$4,000. At auction in Reno last July, his painting of cavalry troops
in full gallop, "Flags on the Frontier," fetched $302,500. A few
months later, Johnson sold another--three Blackfeet Indians riding on
a backbone trail, for more than $400,000.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of critics will simply say, 'That's bad taste' and 'That's
vulgar money,'" says Hassrick. But, he suggests, Western art's unique
position in American culture makes it worth more scrutiny than it has
gotten.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's Boime goes one step further. One day, he suggests, "there
will be scholars dealing with the Cowboy Artists of America."</TE>
<TE>   Something Irresistible</TE>
<TE>   Rounds Up Buyers</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Cowdrey is back, and only a little bit sheepish. It's Day 2
of the Paso Robles sale and Cowdrey, the same collector who mused the
night before about how tired he was of cowboys, now stands in
certified cowboy country, at Wayne Justus' booth.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought all night about that little 'Noon Meal' piece," Cowdrey
says. "So I came back and bought it."</TE>
<TE>   "Noon Meal" is a picture of cowboys lined up at a chuck wagon.
Cowdrey pays $3,500, which puts his weekend's contribution to the
boom at $7,700.</TE>
<TE>   And just wait until next year. David Pereira of the cattlemen's
association reports that the 2003 show will be timed to coincide with
local wineries' zinfandel festival and the West Coast Cutting and
Reining championships.</TE>
<TE>   "Horses, art and zinfandel," says Pereira. "What else is left in
life?"</TE>

<HD>SEC Accounting Probe Expands in Silicon Valley</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID STREITFELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>In a show of force by the federal government against Silicon Valley,
top executives from three Bay Area software companies were charged
with accounting fraud Monday. Managers at two of the firms were
charged criminally as well.</LD>
<LD>   The charges allege that five executives at Quintus Corp., Unify
Corp. and Legato Systems Inc. separately engaged in a laundry list of
illegal practices that wildly inflated revenue during the technology
boom.</LD>
<LD>   According to the Securities and Exchange Commission, a Quintus
executive created false contracts, e-mails and purchase orders, as
well as forged signatures and faked the proof of a sale needed by an
auditor; Unify managers paid other firms to buy its software; and
Legato booked sales on deals that were never consummated.</LD>
<TE>   Also Monday, accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young was charged with civil
violations for getting involved in an allegedly improper business
relationship with PeopleSoft, a software firm that was its client.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials are expanding their probes into the technology
sector, amid mounting evidence of widespread fraud in the late 1990s.
The SEC also is targeting what it believes were inflated revenue
figures across a broad expanse of U.S. industry, as managers sought
to pump up their stock prices.</TE>
<TE>   "With some tech companies, the key to their fame was thinking
outside the box," said Charles Niemeier, head of accounting for the
SEC's enforcement division. "That does not work well when it comes to
the accounting rules."</TE>
<TE>   At their peak, the three software companies charged Monday had a
combined stock market value of about $8 billion. Legato has fallen to
$650 million, while Unify trades for pocket change. Quintus went
bankrupt and no longer exists.</TE>
<TE>   "We all knew that the bubble was being fueled by massive amounts
of hype," said Silicon Valley hedge fund manager Eric Von der Porten.
"But even the skeptics didn't imagine just how many maneuvers
companies were using to puff up their revenues and make it look like
they might justify their market values. It's only now in the
post-bubble, post-Enron environment that all the dirty little secrets
are starting to be revealed."</TE>
<TE>   Monday's charges were announced simultaneously because "we wanted
to send a message to the firms in Northern California that if they
play these games, we're going to go after them aggressively," said
Helane Morrison, SEC district administrator for the Bay Area. Federal
prosecutors simultaneously announced criminal charges against the
Quintus and Unify officers.</TE>
<TE>   According to the complaints filed in U.S. District Court in San
Francisco, the three companies seemed to expend more energy on faking
sales than they did in generating legitimate business.</TE>
<TE>   "The nature of most financial fraud is that it begins subtly and
then it grows," Niemeier of the SEC said. "Once a company starts
manipulating the numbers, it's almost impossible to stop without
revealing the fraud. Once started, the company is pushed to add more
fraudulent revenue or earnings in order to maintain the scheme."</TE>
<TE>   Unify, which makes database management software, was founded in
San Jose in 1980. It went public in 1996 and saw its stock soar in
the Internet boom as it started marketing e-commerce applications.
But sales during fiscal 2000 were in danger of falling short of
expectations.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the government charges, Chief Executive Reza Mikailli
and Chief Financial Officer Gary Pado resorted to fictitious sales.</TE>
<TE>   In one case, a Panamanian company called Open owed Unify $400,000
on a software contract. Despite this obligation, the SEC says, the
Unify executives negotiated a new $1.15-million contract. Open's
chief executive warned Unify that he couldn't pay, but the executives
told him not to worry, according to the SEC's civil suit.</TE>
<TE>   Unify's auditors refused to record the new sale until Open paid
its existing debt, according to the suit. Mikailli wired Open
$400,000 of his own money, which Open then sent back to Unify. Open
never paid the $1.15 million, but Unify recorded the revenue anyway,
the SEC says.</TE>
<TE>   In another episode, according to the SEC, Mikailli was in
discussion with the chief executive of Internet company Ichatterbox
Inc. about joining the Unify board of directors. There was a catch,
however: Ichatterbox had to buy $100,000 worth of Unify software,
even though the Internet company had no need for it and very little
cash, the SEC says.</TE>
<TE>   Mikailli paid Ichatterbox $300,000, instructing its chief
executive that a third of it was for the software and the rest was an
investment, the SEC says. Unify then reimbursed Mikailli his
$300,000.</TE>
<TE>   Such fraudulent deals, the SEC charges, allowed Unify to report
revenue of $39.5 million and net income of $15.3 million for the 12
months ended April 30, 2000. More than half the revenue, or $21.1
million, was fake, the SEC says; as for the profit, it actually was a
loss of $7.7 million.</TE>
<TE>   Mikailli sold all his Unify stock--more than $8 million
worth--during this time. The sales went unnoticed, the SEC says,
because he failed to report them.</TE>
<TE>   Mikailli was arrested Monday morning at his home in Saratoga,
Calif. He was indicted on 10 counts of securities fraud and
conspiracy and faces SEC civil fraud charges. His lawyer did not
return a call for comment Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   Pado, the CFO, pleaded guilty last week to conspiracy to commit
securities fraud, the government said.</TE>
<TE>   After its accounting problems were first revealed in July 2000,
Unify's stock fell as low as 3 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   Quintus was founded in 1984 as an artificial intelligence firm. By
the time it went public in late 1999, it was touting itself as a
maker of software that allowed companies to manage their customer
relationships. The stock rose from $18 to $55 the first day. Chief
Executive Alan Anderson's stake was immediately worth $62million.</TE>
<TE>   "To create and maintain interest in the stock," the SEC charges in
its complaint, "Anderson embarked on a campaign to falsely bolster
the company's reported revenue."</TE>
<TE>   In one deal, the SEC says, Quintus negotiated to make AT&amp;T Corp. a
reseller of its software. Quintus asked AT&amp;T to guarantee that it
would purchase $8 million worth. AT&amp;T declined, saying it would pay
for the software as it was resold to third parties.</TE>
<TE>   According to the court documents, Anderson forged an AT&amp;T
executive's signature on a contract that guaranteed a $7-million
payment. Quintus then added the $7million to its quarterly revenue.</TE>
<TE>   As part of its standard policy to test the accuracy of Quintus'
books, the software company's auditor asked AT&amp;T to confirm the deal.
"When AT&amp;T did not respond to the request for confirmation," the SEC
charges, "Anderson offered to locate [the executive] and deliver the
confirmation request." Instead, the complaint says, Anderson forged a
response confirming the deal.</TE>
<TE>   When the accounting discrepancies were first revealed in late
2000, Quintus collapsed. Within three months, it entered bankruptcy
proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson's lawyer, Michael Tubach, said, "Mr. Anderson has fully
cooperated with the government."</TE>
<TE>   The third company, Legato Systems of Mountain View, Calif., was
founded in 1988 and went public in 1995. A maker of software for
managing large computer networks, it was once a hot stock, reaching a
high of $82 a share in late 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Civil fraud charges were filed against David Malmstedt, Legato's
former executive vice president of worldwide sales, and Mark
Huetteman, its former vice president of North American sales.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint charges the pair with causing Legato to fraudulently
record millions of dollars of sales. In one case the company
recognized $7 million of revenue on a deal that was never
implemented, the SEC says.</TE>
<TE>   Malmstedt's lawyer, Kyle Kirwan, said "the SEC allegations are
completely false." Huetteman's attorney did not return a call for
comment Monday night.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Transportation Security Administration wants to hire 57,500
employees to screen airline flights.</LD>
<LD>   In a report to Congress, the new agency said Monday it needs
30,000 workers to staff airport checkpoints and screen passengers and
another 27,500 to inspect checked luggage for explosives.</LD>
<LD>   The 57,500 employees do not include armed air marshals on
airplanes or a federal police force to be deployed at airport
checkpoints.</LD>
<TE>   Under the law passed after the Sept. 11 attacks, federal employees
are to replace private security screeners at all 429 commercial
airports by Nov. 19. All checked luggage is supposed to be screened
by machine for explosives by Dec. 31.</TE>

<HD>Ovary Removal May Cut Cancer Risk</HD>
<DH>Health: Women with genetic predisposition to breast tumors
would benefit, studies find. It offers an alternative to
mastectomies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Women who carry genes that increase their risk of breast cancer can
sharply reduce their risk by surgical removal of their ovaries, a
less disfiguring alternative than preventive removal of both breasts,
which has been their primary option until now.</LD>
<LD>   The operation also greatly reduces the risk of ovarian cancer,
which is also associated with the same genetic condition.</LD>
<LD>   The new findings offer an alternative but also a new set of
difficult choices for women who carry the high-risk versions of the
genes, known as BRCA1 and BRCA2.</LD>
<TE>   Between 1 in 400 and 1 in 800 American women carry those genes.
The percentage is higher among certain ethnic groups such as Jewish
women of Eastern European origin, about 1 in 40 of whom carry the
high-risk gene.</TE>
<TE>   Most breast cancers occur in women who do not carry the high-risk
genes. But those who do carry those genes have a 50% to 85% risk of
developing breast cancer during their lifetime and a 10% to 40% risk
of developing ovarian cancer.</TE>
<TE>   The presence of the genes can be readily detected by tests.
Doctors do not routinely screen women for the genes, but they are
suspected when at least three female members of a family develop
breast cancer or when family members develop the disease at an
unusually early age.</TE>
<TE>   Removing the ovaries makes the women's risk of breast cancer
comparable to that of women who do not have the mutated genes,
according to the new research, which was reported Monday at an
Orlando, Fla., meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.
The findings also will be reported in Thursday's New England Journal
of Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   The studies support recommending the surgery for women who have
finished their childbearing, said Dr. Daniel Haber of Massachusetts
General Hospital. It also "provides a strong rationale for genetic
testing in women with a strong family history of breast cancer," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   But deciding to undergo the procedure, he added, is ultimately "a
highly personal choice."</TE>
<TE>   The removal of the ovaries almost completely eliminates the risk
of ovarian tumors, because there is no tissue left in which cancer
can grow.</TE>
<TE>   But the operation also reduces the risk of breast cancer by as
much as 75%, because it sharply reduces the body's production of
estrogen, which stimulates breast tumor growth.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been doing this [removing ovaries] for a long time, and it
makes sense clinically," said Dr. Jeffrey Weitzel of the City of Hope
Medical Center in Duarte. "What hasn't been clear is whether we truly
made an impact by doing this. Now we know that it is likely to be
effective if a woman chooses it."</TE>
<TE>   Removing both breasts to prevent cancer from
developing--prophylactic mastectomy--"is the gold standard" for
prevention of breast cancer in high-risk women, said Dr. Kenneth
Offit of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, who
led one of the new studies. That operation reduces the risk of breast
cancer by greater than 90% but does not lower the risk of ovarian
cancer.</TE>
<TE>   However, the new studies suggest that ovary removal alone may be
sufficient. "It may be that women no longer have to think about
making the choice of having their breasts removed," said Dr.
Olufunmilayo Olopade of the University of Chicago Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   Offit and his colleagues studied 173 women who had been determined
to have the mutated version of either the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene.</TE>
<TE>   The women received extensive genetic counseling and were given the
option of either having their ovaries and fallopian tubes removed or
undergoing intensive screening for the early detection of ovarian
tumors.</TE>
<TE>   One hundred and one of the women chose surgery and 72 chose
screening. Three of the women who chose surgery were found to have
small ovarian tumors at the time of the surgery and were not included
in the final analysis.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of two years, three of the 98 women who chose surgery
had developed breast tumors and one had developed a peritoneal tumor,
a form of ovarian cancer that arose in the very small amount of
tissue left behind in the surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Among the 72 who chose screening, eight developed breast cancer,
four developed ovarian cancer and one developed peritoneal cancer.</TE>
<TE>   "This adds to our preventive arsenal, offering women at high risk
of these cancers another option for preventing disease," said Dr.
Larry Norton, president of the oncology society.</TE>
<TE>   The second study, led by Olopade, was a retrospective study of 551
high-risk women who had been followed for at least eight years. Of
this group, 259 had undergone an operation to remove their ovaries
and fallopian tubes and 292 had not.</TE>
<TE>   The team examined the incidence of breast cancer in a subgroup of
99 women who underwent the surgery and 142 who did not.</TE>
<TE>   Of those who underwent surgery, 21% developed breast cancer. Of
those who did not have the surgery, 42% developed breast cancer.</TE>
<TE>   The study also showed that the operation greatly reduced the risk
of ovarian cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 259 women who had the surgery, six were found to have an
ovarian tumor at the time of their operations and two subsequently
developed peritoneal tumors.</TE>
<TE>   In sharp contrast, in the group that did not have the operation,
58 developed ovarian cancer.</TE>

<HD>Trial of 2 Linked to Militants Opens</HD>
<DH>Courts: The brothers are accused of smuggling cigarettes
from North Carolina to Michigan to help fund a Lebanese terrorist
group.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHARLOTTE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>In a courthouse protected by federal marshals and a ring of concrete
barriers, jurors were chosen Monday for the trial of two men accused
of helping run a cigarette-smuggling operation to benefit Lebanese
militants.</LD>
<LD>   Brothers Mohamad and Chawki Hammoud arrived at U.S. District Court
in a closely guarded armored truck, and courtroom spectators passed
through two checkpoints, both with metal detectors, to attend the
trial. As many as a dozen marshals at a time were in the courtroom,
while others stood outside with shotguns.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers and Judge Graham Mullen questioned prospective jurors for
a trial that could take up to eight weeks.</LD>
<TE>   Mullen told lawyers at the lunch break to be ready for opening
statements Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The government charges the Hammouds with taking part in a
conspiracy that bought cheap cigarettes in North Carolina and resold
them in Michigan without paying that state's higher cigarette taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Mohamad Hammoud, 28, also is charged under a 1996 anti-terrorism
law with providing material support to a terrorist group, the
Lebanon-based Hezbollah.</TE>
<TE>   He faces up to 10 years in prison on that charge. If convicted and
sentenced at maximum levels on other charges--money laundering,
cigarette smuggling, immigration fraud and racketeering, among
others--he could spend the rest of his life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Chawki Hammoud, 37, faces lesser charges of cigarette smuggling,
money laundering and racketeering.</TE>
<TE>   Hezbollah, labeled a terrorist organization by the State
Department, led a guerrilla war against Israel's 18-year occupation
of a border zone in southern Lebanon.</TE>
<TE>   The occupation ended with an Israeli withdrawal in May 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The group is blamed for a number of terrorist attacks on the
United States, including the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy and a
Marine barracks in Beirut that killed 241 American servicemen.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have never charged the Hammouds or any other
defendants in the case with committing or planning violent or
terrorist acts.</TE>

<HD>Killer Is Caught 32 Years After Escape</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NASHVILLE</DL>
<LD>A convicted murderer has been captured nearly 32 years after she
escaped from a Tennessee prison and assumed a new identity and life
in her hometown of Columbus, Ohio, authorities said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Margo Freshwater, 53, was arrested Sunday by state and local
authorities. Using the name Tonya McCartor, she and her husband
worked there as truck drivers, said Brooks Wilkins, a special agent
with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation.</LD>
<LD>   While a fugitive, Freshwater married several times, had three
children and kept her criminal record clean except for minor auto
violations, authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't believe her current husband or the son who was with her
at the time of her arrest knew anything about her past," said Larry
Wallace, bureau director.</TE>
<TE>   Freshwater was denied bail at an extradition hearing Monday in
Franklin County, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Freshwater escaped from the Tennessee Prison for Women on Oct. 4,
1970, when she and another woman "broke formation" and scaled a
perimeter fence, corrections authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   She had served just one year of a 99-year sentence for the
first-degree murder of a Memphis liquor store clerk. The other woman
was recaptured in the early 1990s, corrections spokesman Steve Hayes
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, which for years traced
women of similar age and physical description, got a break last month
when their research led to Tonya Hudkins, the name Freshwater was
using before her most recent marriage, Wallace said.</TE>

<HD>Guardsman Mostly Kept Danger to Himself</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: To many friends, Sgt. Vance was just a regular
guy. They didn't know he was in the Special Forces until he died in
an ambush.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FAYE FIORE and ESTHER SCHRADER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Gene Vance always seemed to be going off to do things most other
people didn't. Once he went away for several weeks and came back
speaking Farsi. He spent many mornings in grueling training--for
what, few knew--hiking a brisk 10 miles with 75 pounds of bricks on
his back and returning with his feet busted up and his body broken
down.</LD>
<LD>   One of his closest friends assumed that he was just a great guy
who loved a challenge. But the full picture of Sgt. Gene Arden Vance
Jr. did not click into focus until Sunday, when the 38-year-old West
Virginia man became the second National Guard soldier to die in
combat in the war on terror.</LD>
<LD>   "There were two Genes--the one you knew like a brother and the one
who'd go off and do the stuff he never told you about," said Ed
Evans, his friend for a decade. "We didn't know how highly trained he
was. It was like a secret life."</LD>
<TE>   Vance was called up in December. He left behind his job at a
bicycle shop in Morgantown and his bride of five months, Lisa, just
as they were to leave for a delayed honeymoon in Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   He was a language specialist, trained to detect and decipher
foreign communications. He died in an ambush Sunday when suspected Al
Qaeda and Taliban forces fired on his unit, part of a patrol that was
sweeping eastern Afghanistan for enemy forces.</TE>
<TE>   "He had trained for years to do this job and he loved it," said
Sheril Keeler, a family friend on hand to comfort his widow in the
couple's modest ranch-style home. An American flag flew outside and a
yellow ribbon was tied to the handle of the front door. Uniformed
National Guard officials and women bearing trays of food began
arriving Monday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Vance was born in the small town of Yaeger, W.Va. He graduated
from Oceana High School outside of Charleston, then served seven
years in the Army. He returned to civilian life, took some college
courses, then joined the National Guard, studying Farsi at the
Defense Language School. He has a teenage daughter from his first
marriage.</TE>
<TE>   To most, Vance was a tall, rangy outdoorsman who worked any hours
required as a manager at the Whitetail Bicycle and Fitness shop and
trained with the Guard one weekend a month and two weeks in the
summer.</TE>
<TE>   But Vance was not your normal "weekend warrior"; he was assigned
to one of two Special Forces groups of the National Guard that were
regularly called to active duty. His death underscores the proximity
to danger for more than 26,000 Army and Air Force guardsmen plucked
from their civilian careers to fight in the war on terrorism at home
and abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Many of these citizen-soldiers play a supporting role to forces on
the front lines. They are the pilots who fly the cargo planes, the
repairmen who fix them, the chefs who keep troops fed. But some, like
Vance, are special operations soldiers, trained to back up elite
units such as the Green Berets. Many, like Vance, were once
active-duty soldiers who hadn't lost the taste for adventure or the
desire to serve their country.</TE>
<TE>   "They've been involved in all phases of this operation, from
flying combat missions to support to being on the ground as well.
They have been playing a very critical role from the beginning," said
Lt. Col. Dave Lapan, a Pentagon spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   The first guardsman killed was Sgt. 1st Class Daniel A. Romero,
one of four U.S. servicemen who died destroying a weapons cache on
April 15 near Kandahar.</TE>
<TE>   Vance is the 22nd U.S. service member killed in action since the
fighting began last year. Some in West Virginia who thought they knew
him learned only recently that he had won a Bronze Star, although the
circumstances were not immediately clear.</TE>
<TE>   "That doesn't surprise me on two counts--that he won it and that
he never told anybody about it," said Bruce Summers, owner of the
bike shop where Vance worked.</TE>
<TE>   Vance met Lisa, a software engineer, while they were putting
together a Web site for the shop. They married in July. She was on a
work assignment in Washington when casualty officers tracked her down
to break the news.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, an Army honor guard received Vance's flag-draped coffin
at Ramstein Air Base in Germany. It was not immediately clear when
his body would be flown home to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The news media converged outside his home and the bike shop with
questions about who he was. His high school planned a moment of
silence. And West Virginia Gov. Bob Wise ordered all state flags to
be flown at half-staff until after the burial.</TE>
<TE>   "Sgt. Vance's selflessness and supreme sacrifice for his country
in defense of our liberty on a battlefield half a world away brings
honor to his family, the people of the state of West Virginia and his
country," Wise said.</TE>
<TE>   Vance probably would not have cared for all the attention, his
friends said.</TE>
<TE>   "He would have hated it," Summers said. "Gene was an extremely
private person. He wasn't shy. He just didn't talk a whole lot about
himself."</TE>

<HD>Supreme Court to Hear Real Estate Discrimination Case</HD>
<DH>Housing: Jurists will consider whether a firm's owner may
be liable for an agent's bias.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE and DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court, taking up an appeal backed by California's real
estate industry, agreed Monday to decide whether the owner of a small
real estate firm can be forced to pay a damages verdict out of his
own pocket if one of his agents discriminates against a prospective
buyer or renter.</LD>
<LD>   "What sane individual would take on that responsibility" of owning
or managing a real estate business if they are "going to be
personally liable for the acts of all of the agents?" asked Douglas
G. Benedon, a Woodland Hills attorney, in his appeal to the high
court.</LD>
<LD>   He is representing David Meyer, the owner of a now-defunct real
estate company that sold homes in the Twentynine Palms area of
Southern California. He was sued for racial discrimination after one
of his agents allegedly turned away a mixed-race couple and referred
to them as a "salt-and-pepper team."</LD>
<TE>   The couple, Emma and David Holley, offered $145,000 for a house in
October 1996, but the seller's agent, Grover Crank of Triad Realty,
never presented the offer. The owner later sold his house for $20,000
less.</TE>
<TE>   The Holleys and the seller joined a race-bias suit against Crank,
the Triad firm and its owner and broker, Meyer.</TE>
<TE>   The case has never gone to trial. It reached the Supreme Court on
the question of who can be held liable for discrimination under the
landmark Fair Housing Act of 1968.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, U.S. District Judge William Matthew Byrne Jr. dismissed
Meyer from the case, ruling that the plaintiffs could sue only Crank
and Triad.</TE>
<TE>   Since the agent and the company had little in the way of insurance
or assets, the lawyers for the bias victims appealed to the U.S. 9th
Circuit Court of Appeals. Last year, its judges gave the civil rights
law a broad sweep, saying that liability extends to all who "direct
or control" real estate sales and rentals.</TE>
<TE>   "Owners and officers of corporations may be held vicariously
liable for an employee's violations of the Fair Housing Act," said
Judge Procter Hug Jr.</TE>
<TE>   The court said the plaintiffs did not have to prove that Meyer
knew of or condoned the alleged discrimination. Instead, they needed
to show only that he supervised the agent.</TE>
<TE>   That ruling sent a jolt through the real estate industry, said
June Barlow, general counsel for the California Assn. of Realtors,
based in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have a problem with holding the firm liable. This went
beyond that to say the owner can be personally liable, and without
any finding of wrongdoing on his part," Barlow said.</TE>
<TE>   The California Realtors group and the Chicago-based National Assn.
of Realtors joined Meyer's appeal to the high court. They said the
entire real estate industry faced "much upheaval" if the personal
assets of "innocent" owners and directors could be put at risk in a
lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   A lawyer for the bias victims said the Realtors groups are
exaggerating the effect of the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been the law for decades. If you are licensed by the
state and you are in control [of a real estate operation], with that
control comes the responsibility to assure that the agents comply
with the law," said Christopher Brancart of Pescadero.</TE>
<TE>   Arguments in Meyer vs. Holley, 01-1120, will be heard in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   Experts in housing discrimination say it is hard to gauge whether
blatant bias persists in the real estate industry.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the norm, but it's not uncommon either," said Raphael
Bostic, a professor at USC and an expert on home lending practices.
"It wouldn't be a big surprise to come across Realtors and brokers
that use this kind of approach, but at the same time a lot of
reputable Realtors don't do this."</TE>
<TE>   Marlene Garza, chief executive of the Housing Rights Center, which
handles litigation complaints for the city and county of Los Angeles
and 28 other cities, said testers continue to see stark disparities
in the treatment accorded whites and racial minorities. In a recent
test, the group found that a person of color was handed brochures and
showed a Web site by brokers at a Pasadena agency, while a white
person of similar income and housing needs got a personal tour of
neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   But lawsuits are relatively rare.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have a rampant number of [discrimination] cases because
a lot of it goes undetected," said Gary Rhoades, litigation director
for the Housing Rights Center.</TE>
<TE>   The National Fair Housing Alliance, a Washington group that

month that only 1% of discrimination by agents is reported.</TE>

<HD>Witness Says He Didn't See Ex-Klansman in '63</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BIRMINGHAM, Ala.</DL>
<LD>A barber whose earlier testimony helped convict two Ku Klux Klan
members of murdering four black girls in a 1963 church bombing
testified Monday he did not see Bobby Frank Cherry with the other men
the night before the attack.</LD>
<LD>   Bill Jackson also told the jury that he didn't see Cherry at a
Klan recruitment meeting he went to at about the same time as the
bombing at the 16th Street Baptist Church.</LD>
<LD>   "I met him [Cherry] this morning for the very first time," Jackson
said of the defendant.</LD>
<TE>   Cherry is the last suspect to stand trial in the deadliest attack
against the civil rights movement. The blast killed Denise McNair,
11; along with Addie Mae Collins, Carole Robertson and Cynthia
Wesley, all 14.</TE>
<TE>   The defense rested its case late Monday, contending the evidence
against Cherry is "mostly hearsay."</TE>
<TE>   Cherry was not called to testify. Final arguments are scheduled
today, with the case then going to the jury.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Blanton Jr., one of the men Jackson testified against, is
serving a life term after being convicted last year. That jury
reached its verdict after only two hours of deliberation. The other
Klansman, Robert "Dynamite Bob" Chambliss, was convicted in 1977 and
died in prison. A fourth suspect, Herman Cash, died in 1984 without
ever being charged.</TE>
<TE>   Facing four counts of murder, Cherry, 71, has often seemed bored
during his trial and showed no emotion when a 1957 newsreel was
played for the jurors last week, showing Cherry taking a swing at a
black minister during a civil rights demonstration.</TE>
<TE>   "Bobby's just an old guy who wants this to be over," his attorney,
Mickey Johnson, said of the ex-Marine who was trained in explosives
and was 33 at the time of the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Two of Cherry's grandsons also testified Monday, saying they had
lived with Cherry for extended periods and never heard him speak of
bombing the church or being a Ku Klux Klan member.</TE>
<TE>   But last week an ex-wife and four other witnesses told the jurors
they had heard Cherry admit to taking part in the bombing, statements
the defense branded as lies. Cherry was indicted in the attack in
2000, but his trial was delayed by questions over his mental
competence.</TE>
<TE>   A good part of Cherry's defense is focused on a claim made by an
FBI informant, Mary Frances Cunningham, in 1964. She said she saw
Cherry and the three other Klan suspects sitting in a car near the
church on the morning of the bombing. Cherry got out of the car and
put the bomb in the building, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, testifying for the defense, she denied ever making the
statement to the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   On the morning of the bombing, Sept. 15, 1963, civil rights
demonstrators were gathering at the church for a protest against
segregation. The church was used by civil rights leaders, including
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Rev. John Cross, as a base to
promote civil rights.</TE>

<HD>3 Plead Guilty in Tennessee Driver's License Fraud Case</HD>
<DH>Courts: An FBI probe yields no links to terrorism among the
defendants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MEMPHIS, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>Three of four men charged in a Tennessee driver's license fraud case
pleaded guilty Monday in federal court.</LD>
<LD>   The defendants were arrested Feb. 5 along with Katherine Smith,
49, a Tennessee driver's license examiner who died five days later in
a car fire authorities say was intentionally set.</LD>
<LD>   Mostafa Said Abou-Shahin, Khaled Odtllah and Sakher A. Hammad each
admitted Monday that they tried to obtain licenses illegally. The
fourth defendant, Abdelmuhsen Mahmid Hammad, was to appear in court
Monday afternoon.</LD>
<TE>   Defense lawyers have said the men traveled to Memphis from New
York because they heard it was easy to get driver's licenses in
Tennessee, where Social Security numbers are not required.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI investigated whether the men were linked to terrorists,
but prosecutor Tim DiScenza said Monday there was "no proof of any
terrorist activity."</TE>
<TE>   Sentencing for the men is scheduled for June 27. Prosecutors have
recommended leniency.</TE>
<TE>   The men face a maximum of five years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   After almost a monthlong investigation, the Tennessee Highway
Patrol determined that Smith's death was not caused by the wreck but
by "other means."</TE>
<TE>   No one has been charged in her death, which wasn't mentioned in
court Monday.</TE>
<TE>   A fifth defendant, Mohammed A. Fares, pleaded guilty earlier this
month.</TE>

<HD>High Court Takes Megan's Law Case</HD>
<DH>Crime: The justices will look at whether states should be
allowed to post information about convicted sex offenders on their
Web sites.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court said Monday it will decide whether states may post
on their Web sites the names and photos of convicted sex offenders
regardless of whether they continue to pose a danger to the
community.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, a federal appeals court barred Connecticut from posting
the names of its ex-offenders until each of them was given a hearing
on whether they pose a danger now.</LD>
<LD>   The case, to be heard in the fall, could limit the use of
so-called Megan's Laws that have been adopted in every state.</LD>
<TE>   They were named for Megan Kanka, a 7-year-old New Jersey girl who
was raped and killed in 1994 by a paroled sex offender who,
unbeknownst to her parents, had moved into the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   States have adopted different definitions of who is included in
their public registry of sex offenders and how this information is
made public.</TE>
<TE>   Connecticut has a broad system that includes virtually all sex
criminals, from first-time, nonviolent offenders to repeat rapists.
And the state posts this information online for 10 years after the
criminals are released.</TE>
<TE>   Those convicted of violent sex crimes remain on the registry for
life.</TE>
<TE>   California has the nation's oldest sex registry law, but its
postings are limited to serious sex offenders and are not available
on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "The Legislature has not wanted to put those names on the
Internet, but anyone can go to a sheriff's office or a police station
and check for names and ZIP Codes," said Hallye Jordan, a spokeswoman
for the California Department of Justice.</TE>
<TE>   The state's Violent Crime Information Center lists 94,000 sex
offenders, including people who are convicted of sexual assaults,
rapes or lewd and lascivious conduct with minors.</TE>
<TE>   Among these, 1,742 people are classified as "high-risk" offenders
because they have repeatedly committed violent sex crimes. Police can
take special steps to notify the community when such a person moves
into an area.</TE>
<TE>   But the state law also says it is illegal to use this information
to harass or punish a paroled sex offender.</TE>
<TE>   A broad ruling in favor of the privacy rights of ex-offenders
could have an effect on California's system. It would certainly
affect the 20 states that routinely post the names of all sex
offenders.</TE>
<TE>   But the justices agreed to hear an appeal from Connecticut
prosecutors who say these postings do not violate the constitutional
rights of ex-offenders.</TE>
<TE>   A state's "publishing true and accurate information about [a
criminal] and his conviction history" does not clash with the U.S.
Constitution, Connecticut Atty. Gen. Richard Blumenthal said in his
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   He relies heavily on a 1976 opinion written by then-Justice
William H. Rehnquist, which held that a person's reputation is not
protected by the Constitution. An accused shoplifter from Louisville,
Ky., had sued the police chief for putting out a flier that included
his name and photo on a list of "active shoplifters." The charge was
later dropped and the man sued, claiming the officials had damaged
his reputation.</TE>
<TE>   But Rehnquist said there is no such right in the U.S.
Constitution. States may not deprive persons of "liberty without due
process of law," but the issuance of the flier did not amount to
depriving him of liberty, he wrote. However, the plaintiff was free
to sue a local official for defamation under state law, he added.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Court of Appeals in New York acknowledged that ruling in
considering the challenge to Connecticut's sex offender registry. Its
judges said the state went beyond damaging the ex-offender's
reputation by posting his name and photo. The state also requires
offenders to supply a blood sample and to notify officials
immediately whenever they change residence.</TE>
<TE>   "We hold that the plaintiff and members of the class are entitled
to have a hearing ... to determine whether or not they are likely to
be currently dangerous before being labeled as such" in the state's
registry, said the judges of the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals.</TE>
<TE>   The law had been challenged by the Connecticut Civil Liberties
Union on behalf of two unnamed ex-offenders who say they are not
dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   The court will hear their case, Connecticut Department of Public
Safety vs. Doe, 01-1231, in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   A second, related challenge is also due to be heard then. In an
Alaska case, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said states may
not post on the Internet the names of sex offenders whose crimes took
place before the sex registry system became law.</TE>
<TE>   In that case, Otte vs. Doe, 01-729, the justices voted to hear the
state's appeal.</TE>

<HD>Court OKs Federal Phone Suit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court ruled Monday that states can be sued in federal
court for their part in bringing competition into local telephone
markets.</LD>
<LD>   Justices refused to shield states from lawsuits by telephone
companies, turning down arguments from Maryland regulators who claim
that's what Congress intended.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling is the court's second in a week stemming from a 1996
law intended to give consumers a choice of local phone companies.
Last week, justices upheld a federal plan for making the transition.</LD>
<TE>   Monday's ruling means states must deal with potentially lengthy
federal court litigation from companies angry over how state utility
boards or other regulators are following the law.</TE>
<TE>   Maryland attorneys had argued that companies dissatisfied with
state decisions should be restricted to challenges in state courts.
They contend they have protection from federal court suits under the
Constitution's 11th Amendment.</TE>
<TE>   The justices ruled, 8 to 0, that states can be sued in federal
court. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who owns telephone company stock,
did not participate.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling, which overturns a decision by the U.S. 4th Circuit
Court of Appeals, is a victory for the Bush administration and
Verizon Communications.</TE>
<TE>   The cases are Verizon Maryland vs. Public Service Commission of
Maryland, 00-1531; United States vs. Public Service Commission of
Maryland, 00-1711; and Mathias vs. WorldCom, 00-878.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, the court slightly expanded the constitutional
requirement for states to provide lawyers for poor defendants.</TE>
<TE>   In a 5-4 ruling Monday, the court said poor defendants who ''may''
face jail are entitled to a lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Most states go beyond this requirement. California provides
lawyers for poor defendants charged with a misdemeanor.</TE>
<TE>   But Alabama's Atty. Gen. Bill Pryor appealed when the state
Supreme Court ordered a new trial for LeReed Shelton, a man who was
given a 30-day suspended sentence for an assault. Often, such people
are sent to jail immediately if they commit another offense.</TE>
<TE>   In Alabama vs. Shelton, 00-1214, the court affirmed the Alabama
court's ruling.</TE>

<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Science experiments on the International Space Station survived a
weekend power failure, NASA said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   For three hours Sunday all heavy power systems aboard the Russian
service module and most of the systems aboard the U.S. laboratory
module were shut down after the failure of a Russian cooling system
that keeps on-board electronics from overheating.</LD>
<LD>   The three astronauts in the station were never in danger or
seriously inconvenienced, NASA said.</LD>
<TE>   But some critical experiments, including ones that involve
detailed measurements and plant growth, were shut down. All of the
experiments were running again Monday.</TE>
<TE>   A NASA spokesman said the fast response of the crew and ground
managers prevented any damage to the multimillion-dollar science
experiments as a result of the power outage.</TE>

<HD>Lieberman Urges Tax Cut Rollback</HD>
<DH>Economy: The senator and potential candidate for president
says the federal deficit must drop or some reductions should be
suspended.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) on Monday called for rolling back
major portions of President Bush's tax cut, the first prominent
Democrat considering a 2004 presidential race to challenge the
centerpiece of the administration's domestic agenda.</LD>
<LD>   In a speech to the Detroit Economic Club, Lieberman said that if
the federal deficit did not improve by next year, Congress should
suspend three elements of the tax plan--including the next two
scheduled reductions of the top income tax rate.</LD>
<LD>   "We must be prepared to postpone the most expensive and least
progressive parts of the Bush tax cut that go into effect in 2004,
2006 and thereafter," Lieberman declared.</LD>
<TE>   Lieberman also offered proposals to slow the growth in federal
spending and called for making permanent the tax reductions Americans
already have received under the Bush plan.</TE>
<TE>   But his direct assault on the next stages of the tax cut moved him
beyond the other best-known potential contenders for the 2004
Democratic nomination, all of whom have criticized the Bush plan
without directly urging its repeal. Among Democrats exploring a
presidential campaign, only Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who has little
name recognition outside his own state, previously has urged that the
tax cut be significantly altered.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans immediately portrayed Lieberman's speech as a signal
that he wanted to raise taxes. "The president's leadership and tax
cut is much of the reason why the recession was as short-lived as it
was, and raising taxes would be the worst thing to do as our economy
is recovering," said White House spokeswoman Anne Womack.</TE>
<TE>   Rates Wouldn't Rise</TE>
<TE>   Anticipating the criticism, Lieberman said that under his
proposal, 98% of Americans--all but families earning $180,000 a year
or more--would receive all of the tax cut they were promised in last
year's bill, and no one would pay higher income tax rates than they
do today.</TE>
<TE>   "Read my lips: Keeping current tax rates is not a tax increase,"
he said, adapting the famous "no new taxes" pledge then-Vice
President George Bush, the father of the current president, made
during the 1988 campaign for the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman's speech isn't likely to change this year's fiscal
debate in Congress, where Democratic leaders have shown little
inclination to challenge the Bush plan. But it suggests that
attitudes toward the tax cut could be a critical dividing line in the
battle for the party's 2004 presidential nod.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman, Al Gore's running mate in 2000, has been giving
speeches around the country as he eyes a 2004 candidacy. But he has
said he will not run if Gore does.</TE>
<TE>   While the other leading Democrats exploring the race--who include
Gore, House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and Sens.
John F. Kerry of Massachusetts and John Edwards of North
Carolina--have repeatedly portrayed the tax cut as a danger to
long-term growth and Washington's fiscal health, none have offered
specific proposals to reduce it.</TE>
<TE>   Dean has called for canceling all further rate reductions promised
in the law.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman said Monday that if the deficit projections don't
improve by next year, Congress should save $1 trillion over the next
two decades by rolling back three aspects of the Bush plan. Lieberman
said he would:</TE>
<TE>   * Eliminate future reductions scheduled to drop the top income tax
rate from the current 38.6% to 35% and then to 33%;</TE>
<TE>   * Abandon the repeal of the estate tax approved in the
legislation, and instead provide more-limited tax relief for
inheritances.</TE>
<TE>   * Repeal provisions meant to make the personal exemptions and
itemized deductions more valuable for upper-income taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   'Targeted Cuts'</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman said he would use the proceeds for "targeted" tax cuts,
more spending in areas such as education and homeland defense and
increased reduction in the national debt, which aides said would
receive "the bulk" of the funds.</TE>
<TE>   To constrain government spending, Lieberman said he would support
a cap on its growth, "perhaps at the rate of inflation." He also said
he would back a commission proposed by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) to
cut corporate subsidies and urged Congress to make "tough choices" on
defense.</TE>
<TE>   In his emphasis on spending restraint and debt reduction,
Lieberman sought to differentiate himself from more liberal critics
of the Bush tax cut, such as Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.).</TE>
<TE>   The tax cut law is due to expire Dec. 31, 2010, and Bush in
several recent speeches has sought to pressure Congress to make it
permanent. The GOP-run House last month approved legislation that
would do that, but the measure is expected to languish in the
Democrat-run Senate.</TE>

<HD>Kings for a Day? No Doubt About It</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>All the Sacramento Kings gained here was a little bit of credibility.</LD>
<LD>   Come on, now. If you can't win one home game out of two, if you
can't capitalize on a sick Kobe Bryant and a derailed Shaquille
O'Neal, then you really have no business being in the Western
Conference finals.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings did what they had to do. They beat the Lakers, 96-90,
and evened the series at 1-1. They ensured themselves another home
game, Game 5, but I'm less convinced than before that they'll get
back to L.A. for a Game 6.</LD>
<TE>   Bryant and O'Neal came up smaller than usual in the second half,
no other Lakers filled the gaps and yet they still entertained
thoughts of sending this game into overtime during the final seconds.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings made just enough of their 38 (38!) free throws to hold
the Lakers at bay.</TE>
<TE>   And the Lakers just sort of brushed it off. There won't be much
soul-searching these next three days before Game 3 on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no regrets about this game," said forward Robert Horry,
who might have lamented his two missed three-point shots if he hadn't
grabbed 20 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel good about what went on tonight," O'Neal said.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal made some not-so-thinly veiled remarks about the
officiating, but that was really the natural order of the NBA
exerting itself.</TE>
<TE>   Things have a way of evening out in the course of a series. The
Lakers got the calls in Game 1, the Kings got the calls in Game 2,
and that's the last that will be said here about the officiating.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Lakers were in as cheerful a mood as you'll ever find
them after a playoff loss. O'Neal, who usually drops his head and
mumbles in an even lower monotone, looked up, looked alert and was
even playful.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant popped his head into the media work area and growled at the
reporters pounding away at their laptops: "Punch the keys!"</TE>
<TE>   After a room service bacon cheeseburger gave him a bout of food
poisoning, Bryant made a wisecrack at the podium that the next time
he's hungry he'll go to McDonald's. (That's the second endorsement
he's managed to work into these televised postgame interview
sessions. Did you notice what brand of soft drink he sipped after
Game 3 in San Antonio?)</TE>
<TE>   For a while on Monday night it really was "Shaq-ramento"--as the
sign said at the gate for my Southwest Airlines flight here.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal scored 13 consecutive points for the Lakers in the second
quarter. He had 23 points on 11-for-15 shooting before he picked up
his third foul 4:49 before halftime. He went out and never got his
groove back.</TE>
<TE>   In the second half, he made only four of 12 shots.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers had the shots they wanted in the third quarter. They
had O'Neal with the ball inside, Bryant firing jumpers, and had
little to show for it. They shot a combined five for 12 in the
quarter and the Lakers fell behind by 15 points before rallying to
make it interesting at the end.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings did do some good things. Hedo Turkoglu, who gave them
nothing in the first game, finally made some shots and scored eight
points.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Jackson continues to be a daredevil on his flights to the
basket and should be playing more minutes than Turkoglu. But the
Lakers keep exploiting him defensively by posting Rick Fox or even
Devean George against him.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings got another solid game from Mike Bibby.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Webber put up the numbers--21 points, 13 rebounds and five
assists--but he still hasn't shown the will or ability to take over a
game. That's what we're all waiting for from him.</TE>
<TE>   "There's times I need to be more aggressive," Webber said. "But at
the same time, I believe in my team."</TE>
<TE>   He keeps talking about wanting to keep his assists up this series
and make sure his teammates get good shots.</TE>
<TE>   He should worry about getting his own shots. The Kings don't have
any better option than Webber in the low post against the overmatched
Horry or Samaki Walker.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal is setting up so deep that he might strike oil. As long as
the Lakers keep getting him the ball down there, they'll keep
enjoying the best percentage shots in the business. That's why their
chances in this series look so good.</TE>
<TE>   So the Lakers got one out of two, which showed that it is possible
to have a good time in Sacramento. They didn't get two, which would
constitute a great trip to Sacramento, and I'm not sure that's
possible.</TE>
<TE>   They still have to come back here. And I'll offer this free bit of
advice for Bryant, the best thing I have to say about Sacramento:
There's an In-N-Out Burger about a mile or so from Arco Arena.</TE>

<HD>Williams' Work Helps Cardinals Gain on Reds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The second start to Woody Williams' season has been nearly perfect.</LD>
<LD>   Williams pitched six scoreless innings, and Jim Edmonds and Albert
Pujols each homered to help the St. Louis Cardinals defeat the
Cincinnati Reds, 7-3, Monday night and take three of four from the
National League Central Division leaders at St. Louis.</LD>
<LD>   "My mechanics were off, but shoot, are you kidding me?" Williams
said. "I'll take that every time. I'm not a beggar."</LD>
<TE>   The Cardinals have won nine of 11, shaving the Reds' lead to three
games. They outscored Cincinnati, 23-12, in the series.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just nice we're starting to play competitive baseball,"
Williams said. "For so long, we were just getting run over."</TE>
<TE>   Williams (1-0) hasn't given up an earned run in 12 innings after
spending more than five weeks on the disabled list with a strained
muscle in his left side. He gave up five hits, struck out five and
walked one.</TE>
<TE>   AMERICAN LEAGUE</TE>
<TE>   Boston 9, Chicago 0--Derek Lowe, who pitched a no-hitter 23 days
ago, gave up two hits in eight innings at Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Lowe (7-1) gave up a leadoff infield single to Kenny Lofton in the
first inning and a two-out single to Jeff Liefer in the eighth. He
struck out seven, walked two and lowered his leading earned-run
average to 1.90.</TE>
<TE>   Shea Hillenbrand hit a three-run homer and Jason Varitek hit a
two-run drive.</TE>
<TE>   New York 6, Toronto 3--Robin Ventura homered for the third
consecutive game, a tiebreaking drive leading off the bottom of the
seventh inning that led the Yankees to their 12th victory in 13
games.</TE>
<TE>   Bernie Williams got the Yankees going with a two-run homer in the
first, the fifth game in a row New York has scored in the first
inning. Ventura's 12th home run tied him with Toronto's Carlos
Delgado and Texas' Alex Rodriguez for the league lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees, who have won five in a row, have homered in 12
consecutive games and have 24 in their last eight, giving them a
major league-leading 72.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 4, Cleveland 3--Wendell Magee's tiebreaking single in the
seventh inning at Detroit gave the Tigers their first four-game
winning streak this season. The Indians have lost four of five.</TE>

<HD>Angels Throw Weight Around</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Appier wins as they dispatch the struggling
Royals, 6-3, to post best start since 1989.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Meet the new bully on the block.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels have earned the right to push lesser teams around.
After all, they have had to scrub sand from their faces year after
year. But there is just a hint of satisfaction in the way they are
beating up on the American League's have-nots these days.</LD>
<LD>   By the time they were done with the Kansas City Royals Monday, the
Angels had a 6-3 victory that extended one of the hottest stretches
in franchise history.</LD>
<TE>   "For us, these are the teams that have always been our nemesis,"
outfielder Tim Salmon said. "We have always played the better teams
tough. It seems like we don't play as well against teams like Detroit
and Kansas City, teams that are not as good as we are. So far, we've
been able to get the job done against those teams this season."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels went into the game riding their best since 1995. The
victory, their 19th in the last 22 games, gave them their best start
since 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the Angels failed to win the division title either of
those seasons. Which more than anything explains the sparse crowd of
14,035 at Edison Field. Angel fans have been fooled by May flowers
before, only to settle for weeds in September. They know this muscle
flexing may only be temporary.</TE>
<TE>   But what the no-shows did miss was another night when the Angels
got the most out of their resources.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not playing perfect baseball, but we're hitting on all
cylinders," Manager Mike Scioscia said. "We hope that this is a level
of production we can sustain all year."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels managed to sustain it through Monday's game.</TE>
<TE>   They were solid in the field. Shortstop David Eckstein made a
diving stop on a grounder to get the Angels out of a two-on, two-out
situation in the first. Third baseman Troy Glaus ended the sixth by
throwing out Mike Sweeney, who had singled in a run and then tried to
take second on a throw to third.</TE>
<TE>   They made the most of a potluck offense. Darin Erstad, Garret
Anderson, Brad Fullmer, Scott Spiezio and Adam Kennedy each drove in
runs to build a 5-1 lead through six innings.</TE>
<TE>   They got great pitching. Kevin Appier dominated at times, retiring
15 consecutive batters in one stretch. He went 6 1/3 innings, giving
up three runs, to improve his record to 5-1. The bullpen then
finished it off.</TE>
<TE>   "During this streak, every aspect of our team has been solid,"
Appier said. "That's what it is going to take in this division. We
have to be solid in all areas."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels brought all that to bear Monday against the Royals, who
have the American League's worst offense. They entered with the
league's lowest team batting average (.231) and fewest home runs
(25).</TE>
<TE>   But, then, the Angels' hot streak has been built on weaker
pitching staffs.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't look at it that way," Scioscia said. "Any time you face
major league pitching, it's a challenge. There is a lot of talent on
every major league team."</TE>
<TE>   Still, there is less on lesser teams, and the Chicago White Sox
are the only team with a winning record the Angels have faced in
their last 21 games. The Angels (25-17) have won 18 of those games to
move within 3 1/2 games of the Seattle Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have handled such 98-pound weaklings as the Detroit
Tigers and Toronto Blue Jays, two teams who seem destined to spend
the summer challenging the Tampa Bay Devil Rays for the worst record
in the league.</TE>
<TE>   Toss on that heap the Royals (16-27), whose play has already cost
Manager Tony Muser his job. Tony Pena has taken over the helm, but
the Royals have stayed the (downward) course.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels wasted little time in again oppressing the unfortunate,
scoring three times in the first inning.</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein dumped a single into right field and, one out later,
Glaus was hit by a pitch. Anderson ended an 0-for-12 streak with a
single to left, and Eckstein barely beat the throw to the plate.
Fullmer followed with a single to center, scoring Glaus. One out
later, Spiezio singled to center to score Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   Appier took it from there.</TE>

<HD>Trade Is Looking Even Better</HD>

<LD>There is a lot of season left, but it is becoming more apparent that
the dominos in the Angels' Mo Vaughn-for-Kevin Appier trade with the
New York Mets are tilting Anaheim's way.</LD>
<LD>   Appier has been the Angels' linchpin in the rotation, but what has
been pivotal is the way Scott Spiezio has outproduced Vaughn, whom
Spiezio replaced at first base.</LD>
<LD>   Spiezio had 23 runs batted in in 36 games before Monday. Vaughn
has 15 RBIs in 30 games. Vaughn sat out three weeks because of a
broken finger. Spiezio sat out a week while serving a suspension.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not going to compare myself to Mo Vaughn," Spiezio said.
"He's a great player and an All-Star, year in and year out."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, toss into that mix the Angels are getting production this
year from designated hitter Brad Fullmer, who has 16 RBIs, and the
Angels have been able to balance the impact of Vaughn's absence in
the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, acquiring Brad [from Toronto] was what made that trade
work," Manager Mike Scioscia said. "He is a left-handed bat who can
give us run production. That allowed us to trade Mo to improve our
pitching."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio has even improved against left-handed pitchers.</TE>
<TE>   His batting average is only slightly better than last season
against left-handers (.244 to .239), but he has 14 RBIs, compared
with six as a right-handed batter last season. Both his home runs
this season have come as a right-handed batter.</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio had 13 home runs last season, but none against left-handed
pitching.</TE>
<TE>   "I have always felt comfortable hitting from the right side, but
it has been 2 1/2 seasons since I played regularly," Spiezio said.
"My right-handed hitting suffered. I made a few minor adjustments
this spring with [hitting coach] Mickey Hatcher. It was like a
15-minute session, but it worked."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shortstop Benji Gil (sprained ankle) will begin a minor league
rehabilitation assignment with triple-A Salt Lake City Friday,
Scioscia said. Shawn Wooten (thumb surgery) will probably join him
next week. Both players are currently working out at the Angels'
facility at Mesa, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Taking one for the team: David Eckstein was hit by a pitch in the
second inning Monday. It was the ninth time this season he has been
hit, tops in the American League. Eckstein scored when Darin Erstad
followed with a triple.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Boston Red Sox outfielder Manny Ramirez still might need surgery on
his broken left index finger if tests later this week show that the
fracture has spread, a team doctor said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The American League batting leader has missed two weeks with the
injury, which was expected to keep him out of the lineup for four to
six weeks.</LD>
<LD>   "If his fracture has not changed since his last X-ray, we'll
continue with nonsurgical treatment," Dr. Bill Morgan said. "If it's
changed and it's unacceptable, he'll require surgery. So he's still
not completely out of the woods."</LD>

<TE>   Seattle Manager Lou Piniella and several unidentified Mariners
were given oxygen for smoke inhalation Sunday after a bus carrying
some of the team to the airport caught fire in Boston's Ted Williams
Tunnel.</TE>
<TE>   "Lou Piniella got out, I think to see if he could help, and ran
into a wall of smoke," team broadcaster Dave Niehaus said.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners were on their way to Logan International Airport
following a 3-2 loss to the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park when the
fire started. They flew to Seattle on Sunday night.</TE>

<LD>Under the headline, "Strike may be the best thing for a fading
sport," Gary Shelton of the St. Petersburg Times writes:</LD>
<LD>   "Baseball needs repair more than America needs baseball. As a
sport, it rattles and wheezes like an old car trying to make one last
trip before it dies on the road.</LD>
<LD>   "Still, it lumbers ahead, as if 1950 were going to come back and
all the parts were going to be new again and everyone would be
happy."</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the NBA playoff record for least time
played before fouling out?</TE>
<TE>   In the chips: Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle: "Bone
chips from the elbow of Mariner pitcher Jeff Nelson draw a high bid
of $23,000 before eBay pulls the plug.</TE>
<TE>   "Wow, pitchers and football linemen can earn a nice side income
selling their surgical debris. That's not a bad elbow you got there,
Lefty, that's a chip farm."</TE>
<TE>   More Ostler: "The Sharks' sad demise brings to mind the question
once posed by noted sports thinker George Kiseda, who asked, 'Which
sport has the most accidents?' Answer: 'Hockey. They're called
goals.'"</TE>
<TE>   No ordinary intruder: The San Quentin Giants, the convict baseball
team, hosted the semipro Novato Knicks recently at the prison, which
Steve Rushin of Sports Illustrated dubbed "Unsafeco Field."</TE>
<TE>   According to Rushin, "Prison ball presents pressures unknown to
Randy Johnson." For instance, Novato's Kevin Wolfe, pitching against
the Vacaville state prison team in 1984, heard a guard yell, "Hey,
Charlie, get off the field!"</TE>
<TE>   Wrote Rushin, "The diamond invader obeyed, but still: When Charles
Manson is your Morganna, it gives a pitcher pause."</TE>
<TE>   Homebody: Steve Jacobson of Newsday in an interview with Seattle
Mariner Manager Lou Piniella: "[He] pointed out that he played in
four World Series, batted .319 in 72 at-bats and never drew a walk.</TE>
<TE>   "'That was my on-base percentage: .319,' he said. 'I consider that
stat now. It's a good thing they didn't have that stat then. I'd have
on-based myself onto the bench.'"</TE>
<TE>   Tip money now: In a 1968 interview with Maury Allen of the New
York Post, pitcher Tom Seaver said of a new contract with the Mets,
"I got what I wanted. If I had gotten more it would have not been
fair to the club."</TE>
<TE>   Allen: "Seaver was raised to $20,000, an extraordinary contract
for a second-year player."</TE>
<TE>   Old habit: Comedy writer Earl Hochman: "David Schultz, president
of Pony athletic shoe company, is backing Pete Rose in his bid to
reach the Hall of Fame with advertisements in magazines and on
billboards. Rose is laying 2-1 odds the campaign will pay off."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1952, the Brooklyn Dodgers broke
loose for a major league-record 15 first-inning runs and coasted to a
19-1 victory over the Cincinnati Reds at Ebbets Field.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Travis Knight of the Lakers, six minutes against
San Antonio on May 23, 1999.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: In a divorce petition against former Angel Chuck
Finley, Tawny Kitaen called the Indians' pitcher a heavy drinker,
marijuana smoker and steroid user.</TE>
<TE>   Finley's reply: "It's all bull. It's a typical custody battle. I
can't believe she left out the cross-dressing."</TE>

<HD>Again, Drury Is Money Guy</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Forward scores 10th game-winner in playoffs as
Avalanche defeat the Red Wings, 4-3, in overtime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Chris Drury and Patrick Roy did it again.</LD>
<LD>   Drury scored the 10th playoff game-winning goal of his career at
2:17 of overtime Monday night as the Colorado Avalanche beat the
Detroit Red Wings, 4-3, to even the Western Conference finals at a
game apiece.</LD>
<LD>   Steven Reinprecht got a rebound of Peter Forsberg's shot and set
up Drury to tie the best-of-seven series.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm pretty lucky to be next to this guy," said Drury, motioning
to Forsberg. "I don't think they were watching me, they were watching
him."</TE>
<TE>   Forsberg had a goal and three assists for the Avalanche, and Roy
made 30 saves to improve to 10-0 following a playoff loss in which
Colorado allows at least five goals.</TE>
<TE>   "It was great to bail Patty out for once because he's always there
for us," Forsberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Roy shrugged off his comeback ability.</TE>
<TE>   "I see it more as a team stat," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It was the third playoff overtime goal for Drury in his career. He
leads the Avalanche with four postseason game-winning goals against
the Red Wings. Colorado improved to 21-1-1 this season when Drury
scores.</TE>
<TE>   Drury's game-winners in the playoffs trail only Joe Sakic's 14 in
franchise history.</TE>
<TE>   "Chris Drury is one of the best money players we can have on our
team," Colorado Coach Bob Hartley said.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit has gotten a lot of production out of its gritty grinders,
such as Darren McCarty, who scored three goals in Game 1, and Kirk
Maltby, who ended a 31-game playoff goal-less streak, by tying the
score at 2-2 in the second period.</TE>
<TE>   But Red Wing stars such as Brendan Shanahan and Sergei Fedorov
have struggled to make an impact in the series.</TE>
<TE>   "Our big guys have got to get going," Detroit Coach Scotty Bowman
said. "It's a tight series and you know, there is not much room out
there."</TE>
<TE>   Game 3 is Wednesday night in Denver.</TE>
<TE>   "We played a bad game overall," said Dominik Hasek, who made 22
saves for the Red Wings. "We made a lot of mistakes.... We didn't
play well enough to win."</TE>
<TE>   After the game, several players pushed and shoved each other, but
no fights ensued.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado took a 1-0 lead in the first, a 2-1 lead in the second
and a 3-2 lead in the third. Each time, the Red Wings answered later
in the period to tie it.</TE>
<TE>   Not only couldn't Roy deny a third Red Wing goal, he helped put it
in the net.</TE>
<TE>   On a power play, Nicklas Lidstrom's slap shot from above the
circles rebounded off the boards behind Roy. As Roy tried to kick the
shot away, the puck bounced off his right blade and in with 6:35 to
go.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Yzerman was credited with the 100th assist of his career on
the play while Roy just shook his head as the crowd taunted him with,
"Pa-trick! Pa-trick!" chants.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado's Greg de Vries had put the Avalanche ahead, 3-2, at 5:26
of the final period on a wrist shot that got past Hasek's glove.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Tanguay and Forsberg gave the Avalanche leads in the first
and second periods, but Detroit's Boyd Devereaux and Maltby each got
the Red Wings even.</TE>
<TE>   Forsberg scored from just inside the left circle by redirecting
Martin Skoula's pass, from the top of the right circle, off the
inside of his skate.</TE>
<TE>   Lidstrom's fluke goal came after a poor decision by Roy allowed
the Red Wings to tie it 2-2 in the second period.</TE>
<TE>   During a Colorado power play, Roy skated well beyond the circles
to play the puck. Maltby took advantage of Roy being so far from his
net by forcing the goalie to bite on a fake before getting beat.</TE>

<LD>   What: "What Baseball Means to Me: A Celebration of Our National
Pastime"</LD>
<LD>   Editor: Curt Smith</LD>
<TE>   Publisher: Warner Books</TE>
<TE>   Price: $34.95</TE>
<TE>   This 270-page coffee-table book should be mandatory reading for
baseball players and owners who are threatening the national pastime
with talk of another work stoppage. What baseball means to our
history and our culture is conveyed in essays by some of the most
prominent people in our society, and some ordinary people too. There
are 172 essays in all.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush, his father, Jimmy Carter and former New York mayor
Rudy Giuliani are among the contributors. So is Tom Burgoyne, a
mild-mannered Philadelphian who transforms himself into the Phillie
Phanatic for every Phillie home game. "I'm the only baseball
celebrity [Philadelphia fans] never boo," Burgoyne says.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Brokaw writes about his beloved Dodgers, and Dan Rather about
the Houston Buffaloes, a double-A team for which he once did
play-by-play. Olympic filmmaker Bud Greenspan writes about playing
stickball in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The book was the brainstorm of baseball historian Curt Smith, a
former speechwriter for President George Bush, and Rick Wolff of
Warner Books. Smith, whose 10 books include "Storied Stadiums" and
"Voices of the Game," got backing from baseball Hall of Fame
President Dale Petroskey. In April 2000 they sent letters to people
in politics, entertainment, sports, literature, media and other
fields seeking unpaid essays about what baseball meant to them.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 80% responded. Most wrote about their childhood memories.
The essays make for great reading, and more than 200 classic
photographs, most supplied by the Hall of Fame, make this slick book
a collector's item. If it enlightens the right people about the
importance of baseball to this country, that's an added plus.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Brown-Johnson Duel Sunday</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A duel between of Kevin Brown of the Dodgers and Randy Johnson of the
Arizona Diamondbacks is one of baseball's marquee pitching matchups.</LD>
<LD>   That matchup was ensured Monday when Dodger left-hander Kazuhisa
Ishii was pushed back in the rotation because of a sore hip.</LD>
<LD>   Ishii was scheduled to start tonight against the Milwaukee Brewers
in the first game of a six-game trip that will conclude Sunday
against the defending World Series champion Diamondbacks at Phoenix.
Instead, Brown will start tonight at Miller Park and will be followed
by Hideo Nomo on Wednesday and Ishii on Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   The Diamondbacks were off Monday and are also off Thursday. That
means the Dodgers' Odalis Perez will face Curt Schilling on Friday,
Andy Ashby will face Rick Helling on Saturday and Brown squares off
against Johnson on Sunday in the slot that Ishii otherwise would have
occupied.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger General Manager Dan Evans said the Ishii-Brown switch had
"absolutely nothing" to do with setting up the rotation for the
Arizona series.</TE>
<TE>   "That wasn't a factor, none whatsoever," Evans said. "With the day
off [Monday] this keeps Brown and Nomo on turn. It really doesn't
hurt our club."</TE>
<TE>   Evans said Ishii had some mild discomfort before his start last
Wednesday against the New York Mets. Ishii gave up one run and four
hits in seven innings but suffered his first loss after six
consecutive victories.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nothing serious, but at this time of year you have to be
cautious and not push guys," Evans said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Before they left for Milwaukee, Dodger players said they would
concentrate on their series with the Brewers, but they acknowledged
that the Diamondbacks were on their minds.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers began their season with 19 games against National
League West opponents, including six against the San Francisco
Giants, seven against the San Diego Padres and six against the
Colorado Rockies.</TE>
<TE>   This will be their first games against the Diamondbacks, against
whom they went 9-10 last season.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't overlook teams like Montreal and the Brewers because
they are certainly roadblocks," catcher Chad Kreuter said. "But it
will be a fun series [against Arizona]." The Dodgers are confident
they can win the series against the Brewers and are optimistic about
facing Schilling and Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not two guys you want to face, but you're going to have
to face them somewhere down the line," said catcher Paul Lo Duca, who
is nursing a sore right hand.</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder Shawn Green, who went one for 19 in the Dodgers'
seven-game home stand, said he welcomes the challenge of facing two
of the best pitchers in baseball regardless of his .231 average.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to see those guys--I like facing the best pitchers," Green
said. "You know it's going to be some tough at bats, but you go up
with the thought that you're going to be successful."</TE>

but did not get the decision in a 4-3 victory over the Montreal Expos
last Thursday. In his previous start, he struck out 10 in seven
innings of a 3-0 victory over the Florida Marlins. The Brewers are

<KH>CHARTING THE LEAD: A look at the Lakers' lead or deficit by
the minute</KH>
<HD>SACRAMENTO VS. LAKERS/ GAME 2 REPORT</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>FIRST QUARTER: LAKERS 26 SACRAMENTO 25</LD>
<LD>   Highlight reel: There was thunder, lightning, wind, rain and hail
in Sacramento. The midday temperature plummeted to 44 degrees. Kobe
Bryant was stricken with food poisoning from a bad room service
cheeseburger and didn't sleep a wink. Something was seriously amiss
in the roundball world. There was word that Bryant might not play
because he was so ill. By game time, he was on the floor and ready to
score, looking a step slow, but giving the Lakers all he could, which
was plenty after going every second of the opening quarter. He made
four of eight shots.</LD>
<LD>   Not in the box score: The name of a reputable food-taster for
Bryant for future trips to Sacramento. Seriously, the man can't be
expected to haul around his own meals on the road. If you can't trust
room service, you have to take steps to ensure all is well.
Conspiracy buffs will have fun with this one, as they did when
Michael Jordan suffered a similar illness before Game 5 of the 1997
Finals against the Utah Jazz.</LD>
<TE>   Winning number: Nine, the team-leading points for Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: Eight for 21, the Kings' shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Bryant 9, Shaquille O'Neal 8; Kings--Doug
Christie 8, Vlade Divac 8.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--Robert Horry 7, Bryant 2; Kings--Divac
5, Hedo Turkoglu 3.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SECOND QUARTER: LAKERS 50 SACRAMENTO 52</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: There is no truth to the rumor going around Arco
Arena that Hedo is Turkish for "Ofer." Turkoglu finally made a
basket, a perimeter jump shot late in the quarter than ended an
0-for-11 drought to start the series. He's still not playing well
enough for Coach Rick Adelman to keep going to him, but Peja
Stojakovic is out indefinitely because of a sprained right ankle.
Adelman is out of options. He could have started Bobby Jackson in a
three-guard setup but decided against it because it presented matchup
problems. There is no one to check Bryant. Jackson gets a great deal
of playing time, though, because Turkoglu's confidence appears to be
shot.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: A guess at how bad Bryant must be feeling.
He didn't play poorly, but he didn't have the same zip he had in Game
1 or in playoff series victories over San Antonio and Portland. It's
obvious that he's not at his best and Coach Phil Jackson tried to
give him as much rest as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Winning number: O'Neal scored 13 consecutive points for the Lakers
at one point.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: Kings were outscored in the paint, 18-4.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--O'Neal 15, Samaki Walker 5;
Kings--Jackson 11, Mike Bibby 9.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--Horry 5, O'Neal 4; Kings--Chris Webber
4, Divac 3.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THIRD QUARTER: LAKERS 67 SACRAMENTO 76</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: Webber made a jump shot to start the quarter, then
another. Christie swished a three-pointer. Suddenly, the Kings were
off on a 7-2 run to open the second half and they had some breathing
room. Perhaps the play of the quarter (and the game to that point)
was Divac's flop that drew O'Neal's fourth personal foul with 8.7
seconds remaining in the quarter. Divac claimed not to know what the
word meant last week, but if you look up the term in the basketball
dictionary, there's a picture of him embellishing the minimal contact
as O'Neal turned to shoot.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: A Laker to halt the Kings, whose best
quarter of the series gave them a nine-point lead going into the
final quarter. This was a pivotal quarter for the Kings, who simply
couldn't lose and fall behind by two games heading to Staples Center
for Game 3 on Friday. Desperate times called for desperate play.</TE>
<TE>   Winning number: 10, Webber's points for the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: The Lakers' seven-for-20 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Bryant 6, O'Neal 5; Kings--Webber 10,
Divac 6.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--Horry and O'Neal 3; Kings--Divac and
Webber 4.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FOURTH QUARTER: LAKERS 90 SACRAMENTO 96</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: Bibby halted a Laker rally that looked as if it
was going places midway through the quarter with a critical
three-pointer with 2:51 to play. The Kings had gone almost four
minutes without a point, knocking a 15-point lead to 89-82 with
plenty of time remaining. But Bibby stopped the Laker momentum with
one long-range jumper, giving the Kings a 92-82 lead. Without that
shot, it was easy to envision the Lakers completing a comeback more
impressive than when they erased a 10-point deficit in the final 6:15
of Game 4 of their conference semifinal series victory over the
Spurs.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: A Laker basket out of their timeout with 10
seconds to play. Down by 94-90 and looking for a miracle, the best
they could get was Rick Fox's hurried three-point try that was well
short of the mark. They needed a better plan at that stage of the
game, but the ball never touched Bryant's hands. Or O'Neal's.</TE>
<TE>   Winning numbers: The Kings held the Lakers to six-for-22 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: 20 rebounds for Horry in the game, but only eight
points.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--O'Neal 7, Horry 6; Kings--Bibby 7,
Jackson 6.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--Horry 5, O'Neal 4; Kings--Webber 4.</TE>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Oh, this is actually going to be a series?</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers are going home to face their greatest opponent--
themselves--in the comfort and splendor of their very own Staples
Center.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, Laker fans can't be expected to do anything as declasse
as going to feed stores to buy cowbells. Nevertheless, they'll be
enthusiastic in their own way. As John Lennon said at the Beatles'
Royal Command Performance before the Queen, "Would the people in the
cheap seats clap your hands, and the rest of you, if you'll just
rattle your jewelry."</LD>
<TE>   A different King team showed up Monday night, from the opening tip
... which Vlade Divac won from Shaquille O'Neal ... to the first
basket, a 20-footer by Divac ... to the most important play of the
game, O'Neal's third foul, a charge that Scot Pollard took, sending
Shaq to the bench for the rest of the first half with 4:49 left, with
23 points.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal wound up with 35, missing eight of his 12 shots in the
second half. Divac wound up with 15 points and 14 rebounds and the
Kings survived to fight another day.</TE>
<TE>   "What I do?" asked Divac, the old Laker favorite, after another
night of being thrown around like a rag doll by the present Laker
center. "Anything. Just hope he's gonna miss.</TE>
<TE>   "No strategy against Shaq. He's gonna score his points. Hopefully,
you can draw double-teams and make him pass the ball but when you do
that, then other guys get involved. It's hard....</TE>
<TE>   "I can't push him out. You see that play they run from out of
bounds when he goes in the middle? When timeout is over, I'm running
to get there before him because if he gets there before me--what I
said about Utah in the first series, they're done? Then I'm done."</TE>
<TE>   Well, Divac may be on the endangered list and the Kings may have
their work cut out, but they're not done yet.</TE>
<TE>   After going against the big, hard-nosed Spurs, O'Neal was making
little secret of his comfort zone against the Kings, repeatedly
noting, as he did again between games, that the Lakers "know what it
takes to win against certain teams."</TE>
<TE>   This was a nice way of saying: These guys are soft inside and
that's where I play.</TE>
<TE>   For their part, the Kings were besieged with more helpful hints
than they wanted. Chris Webber was advised to take his outside game
inside. Coach Rick Adelman was advised to start Bobby Jackson for
Hedo Turkoglu, who had missed all eight of his shots in Game 1, going
scoreless.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, his teammates were there for him.</TE>
<TE>   "He played like a dead man," said Scot Pollard between games,
laughing. "... I expect him to play much better. If he scores one
point, that's better."</TE>
<TE>   When Turkoglu took his first shot, midway through Monday night's
first quarter, you could hear Arco Arena hold its breath. When he
missed, there was an audible "Ohhhhhhhhh."</TE>
<TE>   Turkoglu also missed his next two, leaving him with an 0-for still
working late in the first half, when he finally knocked down a
20-footer, giving him two more points in the series than a dead man
would have scored.</TE>
<TE>   Turkoglu wound up with eight and five teammates scored in double
figures.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, O'Neal, a monster in the first half, struggled in the
second. Kobe Bryant, the king of the Laker fourth quarters, faded in
this one.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, who had to have this game, got it, as surely as the
Lakers, who needed to get one here, won the opener. Laker Coach Phil
Jackson, asked later if urgency had been the key in both games, said,
simply, "Yes."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Kobe did bang in a late three-pointer, cutting the King
lead, which had once been 15 points, down to 93-90 with 12 seconds
left, but for the Lakers, that was as good as it would get.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't want to know what was going through my mind," Adelman
said. "He's one of those guys, you just don't think he's going to do
the things he does.</TE>
<TE>   "He shot it and I said, 'It's good, let's get the ball in bounds.'
I've seen it too many times."</TE>
<TE>   With the series going back to Staples Center, the Lakers would
seem to have the advantage. The problem for them lies in the fact
they have played all their best games on the road, where they seem to
feel some urgency, while trailing in the second half of four of the
five they've played at home, while waiting for the other team to flee
at the sight of them.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, asked after Game 1 if his players, whom he had pronounced
"underdogs," were now favorites again, answered, "We haven't played
that great at home so let's let sleeping dogs lie."</TE>
<TE>   These puppies are awake and the Laker roll, if not over, has
cooled down. After going six for 12 on three-pointers in the first
half of Game 1, they went 0 for eight in the second half and three
for 19 Monday, meaning they had missed 27 of their last 30 from
beyond the arc.</TE>
<TE>   A little sense of urgency is sure to come in handy in Game 3.
Let's see who has some.</TE>

<HD>A Chip Shot</HD>
<DH>With this team, Ward thinks he can add a victory to his
solid Indy record</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>In five Indianapolis 500 starts, Jeff Ward has finished second, third
and fourth.</LD>
<LD>   "It's about time for a one to go with that two, three and four,"
the 40-year-old Scot said. "No doubt, this is the best chance I ever
had, to be driving for a team like Chip Ganassi's. It's all a driver
could ask for.</LD>
<LD>   "Now it's up to me to not make any mistakes, let the team call the
race and be in the top three for the last pit stop. Then it's up to
me."</LD>
<TE>   Ganassi was the first CART team owner to bring his drivers here
for the 500 after the open-wheel split in 1996. Rookie Juan Montoya
won the 2000 race in a Target team car and Jimmy Vasser finished
fourth.</TE>
<TE>   This season, Ganassi started his own Indy Racing League team,
running it besides his two-car CART team and a NASCAR Winston Cup
team.</TE>
<TE>   Ward is Ganassi's IRL driver and for Sunday's 500 is teamed with
Ganassi's two CART drivers, pole-sitter Bruno Junqueira and former
winner Kenny Brack.</TE>
<TE>   "Racing's a funny business," said Ward, who was one of the world's
greatest motocross champions before switching to cars a decade ago.
"When the year started, I didn't have a ride and was looking for an
Indy-only opportunity. Then I heard from a friend that Chip was
thinking of starting an IRL team.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted him to know I was available, but I wanted to tell him in
person. He was in Laguna Seca for a test. I left home in San Juan
Capistrano at 11:30 and drove all night. I got to the track at 5 a.m.
so I would be sure to be the first to talk to him.</TE>
<TE>   "Fortunately, I had known Chip for about 15 years because he was a
big motorcycle fan who used to come to motocross when I was riding. I
had even talked to him about his CART team when Montoya left, but
nothing came of it. Before I knew it, we had a deal and formed an IRL
team, five days before the first race at Homestead [Fla.]."</TE>
<TE>   Ward never considered racing cars while he was winning seven
national motocross championships, posting 20 supercross wins, 54
motocross wins and riding on winning U.S. teams in seven Motocross
des Nations. He was the first rider to win seven AMA titles with one
manufacturer, Kawasaki, and in 1992 received the AMA's
sportsman-of-the-year award.</TE>
<TE>   "I nearly won the championship in my last year, but I knew I was
going to retire," he said. "Physically, it was too difficult keeping
up with 16-year-olds. I was 31 and it was too much. Jeremy McGrath is
finding that out this year. Ricky Carmichael has it all going for
him, but wait until he's 30.</TE>
<TE>   "Once I realized I was not going to race, it left me kind of in a
vacuum. I had been racing since I was 5, it was all I knew. I did a
few stadium truck races with Walker Evans and hooked up with an Indy
Lights ride at the end of 1992."</TE>
<TE>   For four years he drove in Indy Lights, but without "a bankroll in
my hip pocket" found the door closed to a CART ride.</TE>
<TE>   "When the IRL was formed, it saved my career," Ward said. "It gave
me a chance to drive without having to bring a big sponsor. Eddie
Cheever gave me my big chance to drive one of his cars in the 500."</TE>
<TE>   Ward made the most of it, leading 49 laps, finishing third and
winning rookie-of-the-year honors.</TE>
<TE>   "The IRL has been everything to me," he said. "Fortunately, even
though I had always raced motorcycles on road-type courses, I adapted
well to ovals."</TE>
<TE>   A number of other famous two-wheel champions--Kenny Roberts, Eddie
Lawson, Kevin Schwantz and Rick Johnson--tried automobiles, but never
had Ward's kind of success. The greatest combo rider-driver was Joe
Leonard, who won two Grand National cycle championships before
winning the USAC driving championship in 1972 in the Vel's Parnelli
Jones Samsonite Special.</TE>
<TE>   "Perseverance, that's what it was," Ward said with a smile. "When
I started riding, it took me four years, from 1978 to 1982 before I
won my first race, but I never gave up. I never quit trying. It was
the same way with cars. I didn't win in four years in Indy Lights,
but I kept improving."</TE>
<TE>   Ward is also winless in the IRL, but he has four second-place
finishes, one in the 1999 Indy 500 when he trailed winner Brack by
6.5 seconds while driving for underfunded Pagan Racing.</TE>
<TE>   When he's not living in the family bus, going from race to race,
Ward lives in San Juan Capistrano with his wife, Candice, and their
children, Brandon, 9, Ayrton and Alain, 4-year-old twins, and Siena,
almost 3.</TE>
<TE>   Ayrton and Alain are named for famous Formula One champions Senna
and Prost.</TE>
<TE>   "When the boys were born, my wife liked their names," Ward said.
"I knew Prost but never met Senna. Our oldest has a Scottish-Irish
name in keeping with my ancestry, and Siena is named for a city in
Italy where my wife's family lived."</TE>
<TE>   Ward was 2 when his family left Glasgow for California, and he has
been back only once, but he still carries his British passport.</TE>
<TE>   "You can go all over Europe, even to Japan, without all the hassle
you get with an American passport," he said. "It's really helped me
when I've raced over there."</TE>
<TE>   Although there would seem to be little similarity in racing a
motorcycle over a dirt track filled with bumps, berms and high-flying
jumps and racing a car over a relatively smooth paved oval, Ward says
there is a common thread called concentration.</TE>
<TE>   "You drive around Indy at 220 mph and to do it right, you have to
hit every turn perfect, hit every line precisely, lap after lap. Your
focus has to be complete. In a motocross, you learn every corner,
every rock, every bump and you want to take every berm the same way
to keep up your speed and momentum.</TE>
<TE>   "In a race, with bikes or cars all around, it's not possible to
hit every corner perfect, but your mind has to react instantly to a
rider or a car slowing in front of you or challenging you in a
corner. Do you lift, do you fight him for the corner or do you change
your line? It all happens so fast that when the race is over and you
see tapes you can't believe what you've done in certain tight
circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   "That's where experience is so important. Your brain has to know
what to do before you can even think about it. Your focus, your
concentration, must be intense every second."</TE>
<TE>   Ward will be starting Sunday's race in 15th place, on the outside
of Row 5, alongside last year's top two finishers, Penske drivers
Helio Castroneves and Gil de Ferran.</TE>
<TE>   "It's farther back than I would have liked, but the year I
finished second I started 14th," Ward recalled. "In 500 miles, it's
not far from 15th to first. I'd still like my Indy record to read
1-2-3-4.</TE>
<TE>   "My plan is, like always, race the racetrack and not pay attention
to anyone else, at least until after the last pit stop. Until then,
all I want to think about is my car, my line."</TE>

<HD>Kings Get the One They Needed</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The consensus going into Game 2 of the Western Conference finals was
that the Kings would be all but done if they couldn't defeat the
Lakers on Monday at Arco Arena.</LD>
<LD>   Mostly, it was the Kings who said they faced a must-win situation.</LD>
<LD>   "It's the biggest thing for this franchise, the biggest anything
for this franchise," guard Bobby Jackson said. "A win is a must for
us. You don't want to go to L.A. down two games. We just have to go
out and do it and stop talking about it. And play better defense,
that's for sure."</LD>
<TE>   Center Vlade Divac put it this way: "It's a must-win game.
Basically, you lose this game and there is probably only a 1% chance
of winning the series. You can't put yourself down, 0-2."</TE>
<TE>   Point guard Mike Bibby offered a counterpoint.</TE>
<TE>   "If they were to win [Game 2], who is to say we can't go down
there and win two games?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, going into this postseason, only seven NBA teams had
rebounded from a 2-0 deficit to win a best-of-seven series. But after
a 96-90 victory, the Kings don't have to worry about that.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defense was atop the Kings' to-do list before Game 2. The Lakers
exploited the Kings Saturday in Game 1, particularly while shooting
67% in building a 14-point lead by the end of the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Laker forward Rick Fox noticed a dramatic difference between the
Kings' lax defense on the perimeter and the San Antonio Spurs'
pressure in the conference semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   "This Sacramento team wants to go up and down the floor," Fox
said. "We love that pace. We know we're going to get open looks. It's
just a matter of knocking them down."</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the Kings faced a difficult choice, according to Fox.
The Kings could concentrate on stopping Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe
Bryant and risk having Fox, Derek Fisher and Robert Horry torch
them--as happened Saturday in Game 1.</TE>
<TE>   "Pick your poison," he said, not talking about food poisoning.
"They stay with us and Shaq and Kobe go for 40 [points]. If they stay
at home on Shaq and Kobe and the rest of us go for 40."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Kings had no plans to slow the tempo in an attempt to play
better defense.</TE>
<TE>   "Our game is pushing the ball up and down," Jackson said. "We
didn't do it the last game. We've got to push it to get a flow. We
can play half-court if we have to, but we want to push the tempo.
[Saturday,] they broke us down with the dribble drive. We've got to
be able to contain them."</TE>

<HD>Bryant Is Treated With Fluids</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Kobe Bryant received three liters of intravenous fluid before Monday
night's game, the last as his Laker teammates warmed up for Game 2 of
the Western Conference finals at Arco Arena, because of what medical
personnel suspect was food poisoning.</LD>
<LD>   The final player off the team bus early in the evening, Bryant
walked gingerly across the court to the visitors' locker room. He was
expressionless as half a dozen television cameramen backpedaled ahead
of him.</LD>
<LD>   Bryant telephoned Laker trainer Gary Vitti from his hotel room at
4:30 Monday morning, having vomited for most of the night. He'd eaten
a room-service dinner of a bacon cheeseburger and a slice of
cheesecake.</LD>
<TE>   Vitti rushed to Bryant's room.</TE>
<TE>   "He was doubled over like a shrimp," Vitti said.</TE>
<TE>   Vitti administered medication and Bryant slept most of the
morning, until the team returned from the shoot-around. Bryant awoke
just before noon and took further treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Vitti said he ruled out a virus because Bryant lacked the
symptoms, typically a fever and muscle aches. Phil Jackson and Vitti
both downplayed the possibility that Bryant, who scored 30 points in
Game 1, was intentionally poisoned.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe in that kind of stuff," Vitti said. "I spoke to
some of the people at the hotel and they served 1,200 room-service
meals and there wasn't any other cases. Sometimes, these things
happen."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, on Bryant's diet: "He's young. He doesn't know any
better."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After spending most of the first two series at the end of the
bench, Lindsey Hunter has played important defensive minutes late
against San Antonio's Tony Parker and Sacramento's Mike Bibby.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter said he hadn't considered Jackson's plan for him.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think," Hunter said. "I don't really think about that
kind of stuff. I love playing basketball. I haven't played much, but
I still love it.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what you want to do. You want to feel like you're a part
of it, that you're helping as much as you can."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Every series, Derek Fisher is "the other point guard."</TE>
<TE>   People mention Damon Stoudamire, Parker, Bibby, and what they're
going to do to the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "I just go out and play ball," Fisher said. "It's more about
winning for me and not really my individual matchup. I take it very
seriously, being able to defend against anybody I play against."</TE>

<HD>An Ill Wind for Lakers</HD>
<DH>Game 2: Bryant is weakened by food poisoning as Kings even
series and end L.A. road streak at 12. O'Neal scores 35, but he isn't
happy about officiating.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>When the confetti fell and Chris Webber raised his arms for the point
he scored in the final nine minutes and the lion mascot danced, Kobe
Bryant stood at midcourt, smiling.</LD>
<LD>   Shaquille O'Neal touched Bryant's palm with his.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers lost Monday night, in part because the Sacramento Kings
were a little better, in part because Bryant played in the throes of
food poisoning, in part because Shaquille O'Neal's 35 points were not
quite enough.</LD>
<TE>   Sacramento's victory was 96-90 at Arco Arena, tying the
best-of-seven Western Conference finals at 1-1. Game 3 is Friday at
Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant and O'Neal gathered a few of their teammates together on
the way off the floor. They pulled on each other's jerseys, and
nodded at what they had missed, the chance they had lost.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, if I was healthy I could have played a lot better,"
said Bryant, who was up all Sunday night, sucked in three liters of
intravenous fluids, and then scored 22 points in 40 minutes. "But
that's not really the point. They played better than we did. We're
just going to have to live with it."</TE>
<TE>   That is what the Lakers talked about in that moment on the floor,
after their first road defeat in 13 playoff games. Not the referees
who so angered O'Neal and Coach Phil Jackson, among others. Not the
shots that did not fall at the end, when the Kings lost a lot of a
15-point lead. Moving on.</TE>
<TE>   "We lost, now let's go home and take care of business on Friday,"
Bryant said. "We had opportunities. We missed some wide-open shots in
crucial situations, shots that normally fall for us."</TE>
<TE>   Webber scored 21 points and Mike Bibby scored 20, including a
three-pointer from the top that gave the Kings a 92-82 lead with less
than three minutes remaining. The Lakers missed six of their last
seven field-goal attempts, including two three-pointers--by Rick Fox
and Derek Fisher--inside the final 10 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers did not lead in the second half, which began with the
Kings ahead, 52-50. They scored 17 points in the third quarter, which
gave the Kings enough of a cushion to survive their now usual
fourth-quarter collapse.</TE>
<TE>   There were two statistics that surely would grab Jackson. The
Lakers missed 16 of 19 three-point attempts. And the Kings shot 23
free throws in the first half, to the Lakers' five. The officials
closed the gap a bit by the end, but the Lakers stomped and
complained about it for nearly 48 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "If the outcome is going to be predicted WWF style," O'Neal said
of the professional wrestling league, "let me know so I'm not out
their busting my butt for nothing. Just let me know, so I can be in
on it."</TE>
<TE>   He smiled, but not much.</TE>
<TE>   "Those who understand the game know what really went on," O'Neal
said. "We had a couple of chances to win. We just missed a couple of
shots. So, we feel good about that. In order to beat us, you have to
beat us fair and square. There is only one way to beat us. It starts
with a C and ends with a T."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he meant "cheat," O'Neal said, "Don't put words in my
mouth."</TE>
<TE>   In the fourth quarter, with the deficit large and the crowd loud,
Bryant was on the bench, several seats to the right of Jackson,
tucked between Mitch Richmond and Samaki Walker.</TE>
<TE>   He sucked on the water bottle with the yellow sweat band wrapped
around it, a white towel draped over his shoulders. He returned with
3:39 left, with the King lead seven points, a bit too much for him
and his wrung-out body.</TE>
<TE>   "In certain spurts I had a lot of energy, and in some I didn't,"
Bryant said. "I just tried to pace myself for three quarters, and
then hopefully we'd get within striking distance. Then, the energy
I'd saved up, I'd be able to put it all out when the game was on the
line. But, unfortunately, we weren't able to get to that point."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers lacked the energy they had in Game 1, and the Kings
brought more of the fight many expected of them before the series.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers entered the fourth quarter behind by nine points,
because they scored those 17 in the third, by which time they had
attempted 19 fewer free throws than the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Jackson scored on a layup to start the fourth, so the
deficit was 11. Five minutes into the quarter, Bryant was on the
bench and the deficit was 12.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Bryant returned, the Lakers, heading for their third
loss in 27 playoff games, already had gotten into the habit of going
to O'Neal. He made 15 of 27 attempts. Everyone else made 21 of 62.
Bryant was nine for 21.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaq was rolling," said Robert Horry, who took a career
playoff-high 20 rebounds. "He was doing the work down there. It
wasn't that Kobe was sick. He looked plenty good to me. [Usually, the
fourth] is his quarter. But, Shaq was doing his thing. So why take
over?"</TE>
<TE>   Bryant lacked some of his usual charisma, but little of his game.
He scored nine points in the first quarter, on eight shots, one a
flying tomahawk dunk on a fastbreak.</TE>
<TE>   His shoulders sagged some, and his mouth hung open.</TE>
<TE>   He had a cup or a bottle to his mouth in almost every down moment,
and frequently encouraged Devean George from beneath heavy eyelids.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't smile a lot, when Slamson, the Kings' lion mascot,
bonked him with his big head, or when the guy behind the Laker bench
held up the sign that recommended the cheeseburger and cheesecake.</TE>
<TE>   When he left the floor, he often had Dr. Steve Lombardo in his
ear, and he often nodded, as if to say he was OK.</TE>
<TE>   He had two points in the second quarter, when he started to hit
the front of the rim with his jump shots. He made the Lakers' last
field goal--the three-pointer that brought them to within 93-90 with
12.5 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal was assessed three personal fouls in 16 minutes in the
first half, two of them on the offensive end, once when Vlade Divac
fell and once when Scot Pollard staggered backward.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson received a technical foul for arguing the second, with
4:49 left in the half, and O'Neal left the floor muttering at the
referees.</TE>

<HD>Lakers Are Own Worst Enemy</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>RICK MAJERUS</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Lakers met the enemy Monday night, and it was them.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings played a much better game than the opener Saturday, but
the Lakers were accomplices in that success.</LD>
<LD>   Uncharacteristically, the Lakers fell for the fool's gold, the
early J, the jump shot that tempted them early in the clock. So they
yanked some up, all too many of them. Had they waited, two better
things might have happened. They would have had a better look later
in the clock, or they could have swung the ball a bit and gotten it
into Shaq. They had that patience against San Antonio and they had it
in the first game against Sacramento. This time, they didn't. The
Lakers' shot selection was questionable, as was their shot
allocation. This was a strange-looking triangle offense. They all
thought they were the point of the attack, rather than part of the
triangle. Especially Derek Fisher. Too many early shots, long
launches before any offense or ball movement could begin.</LD>
<TE>   Having said all that, the scary thing is, the Lakers nearly won.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento adjusted well. We said after the first game that they
ran the same stuff too often, that their two-man game with Chris
Webber and Mike Bibby to the left of the key was all they had and all
they did. And we said the Lakers are too good, too veteran to not
handle that kind of static attack easily. You don't need to have 31
flavors, but all Sacramento had Saturday was vanilla. You need at
least four flavors, and this time the Kings had at least that many.</TE>
<TE>   They re-picked at least two of the five times they set Monday
night. They also picked in the backcourt, picked at the top of the
key, they picked coming from the weak side and ran pick and rolls.
When those didn't work the first time, they replaced and did it
again.</TE>
<TE>   Webber is crucial to what they do, and he had what I call a
blended game. I think he read what Bill Plaschke wrote Monday
morning, or he listened to what Bill Walton was saying about him on
TV.</TE>
<TE>   He established a low-post presence part of the time. He also made
some jump shots. He took it to the rim and finished. He got some
offensive rebounds and he got to the free-throw line a lot. Even if
he isn't making his free throws, he's got to get there. If he is
getting there, it's saying plenty about how aggressive he is playing.</TE>
<TE>   Two plays by the Kings were characteristic of the good game they
had.</TE>
<TE>   At the start of the fourth quarter, Scot Pollard set the backcourt
pick that freed Bobby Jackson to go all the way for a key layup. In
Game 1, the Lakers slowed the Kings down with backcourt pressure.
This time, Pollard helped relieve that.</TE>
<TE>   Then, right after that, Pollard made a tip-in of a miss by
Jackson. Great movement, when the Kings were really building the
lead, and they needed every point they had at the end.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings also forced Shaq to be much more active, to work much
harder, than in the first game. Their big players need to come across
the floor and set picks. That makes Shaq come with them to defend.</TE>
<TE>   The main differences in this game and the first were that the
Lakers weren't the Lakers. Instead of passing and rotating and being
patient, they played as individuals. The other difference was that
Sacramento wasn't so predictable. The Kings changed the angles of
their picks, they tried new ones, they threw some change-ups with the
fastballs.</TE>
<TE>   And they decided one more thing: That they were not going to let
the role players--Fisher, Lindsey Hunter, Rick Fox--beat them. Were
they successful? Fisher had four points, Fox 10, Hunter zero.</TE>
<TE>   You be the judge.</TE>

analyst on the Lakers for the rest of the playoffs. Majerus, the
fourth-winningest active coach in major college basketball, will
begin his 14th season at Utah this fall.</TE>

<LD>The Houston Rockets, owners of the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft,
contacted the agent for Yao Ming to express their interest in the
7-foot-5 Chinese center.</LD>
<LD>   "Mr. [Carroll] Dawson called us to tell us they remain very
interested in Yao Ming," Yao's cousin and agent, Erik Zhang, told
Houston television station KRIV. "I think he called as a courtesy to
us and we appreciate that."</LD>
<LD>   The Rockets saw Yao work out in an NBA-sponsored practice in
Chicago and wonder how they might get him to Houston for another
look.</LD>
<TE>   Dawson, the team's general manager, said Sunday the team has six
weeks to decide its best option. But the Rockets need a center.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York Knick center Marcus Camby, who sat out the last 38 games
of the season because of a torn muscle in his hip, has been cleared
by team doctors to resume full workouts.</TE>
<TE>   Camby played in only 29 games. The Knicks (30-52) had the
seventh-worst record in the league.</TE>

<TE>   Former Boston Celtic teammates Larry Bird and M.L. Carr wrote a

<TE>   The Hornets, who played in the city for 14 seasons, are moving to
New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   Stern said before a new team could play at Charlotte, the city
would need a new arena deal. He said if such a deal were in place,
the league's board of governors would consider Charlotte.</TE>

<LD>Tiger Woods parred the third sudden-death hole against Colin
Montgomerie on Monday and won the Deutsche Bank-SAP Open at
Heidelberg, Germany, for the second consecutive year.</LD>
<LD>   The two finished tied after 72 holes at 268. Woods shot a
final-round four-under-par 68, and Montgomerie had a 69.</LD>
<LD>   Woods won with a par on the third playoff hole when Montgomerie
drove into a bunker and hit his next shot into a lake.</LD>
<TE>   Woods earned $410,222, Montgomerie $273,480. It was the 44th
victory of Woods' career and his 16th in 34 events on the European
Tour.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a fun week to hit the ball like this," Woods said. "I wish
I could do this all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Montgomerie, who has never won a tournament with Woods in the
field, had been taking painkillers for a back problem and said he
nearly pulled out before the final round.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had been two under par rather than leading, I wouldn't have
been here," he said. "It was a good effort considering my physical
condition. I'm very proud to go out there and shoot 69. That was a
real effort."</TE>

<HD>Vikings Are Gaining Focus in L.A. Picture</HD>
<DH>Pro football: Owner says he might sell or move team, and
firm he hired has already contacted Anschutz group.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The San Diego Chargers might be the front-runner among NFL teams
weighing a move to Los Angeles, but the Minnesota Vikings are not far
behind.</LD>
<LD>   Viking owner Red McCombs on Monday said he might sell or move the
team because it does not make enough money in the Metrodome. He has
hired J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc., which already has contacted
representatives of a group looking to build a stadium in downtown Los
Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   In a written statement, McCombs said he has hired the investment
firm "to assist me in evaluating all possible options. These options
will include but not be limited to relocation or a sale. This action
is necessary to assure the viability of Vikings football."</LD>
<TE>   The news comes less than a week after a Philip Anschutz-backed
coalition of investors revealed its proposal for a football stadium
adjacent to Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Also last week, NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue announced he will
chair a committee that includes five owners and will explore the
potential return of pro football to L.A., which has been without a
team since the Raiders and Rams left after the 1994 season.</TE>
<TE>   There are no obvious loopholes in the Viking lease, which extends
through the 2011 season. The Metropolitan Sports Facilities
Commission also has a notarized guarantee, signed in 1979 by former
NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, promising the Vikings would play in
the Metrodome for a minimum of 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, McCombs is expected to investigate every potential
escape clause in the deal. He bought the team in 1998 for $246
million, and last year the franchise was valued at $346 million by
Forbes magazine. He reportedly is seeking between $400 million and
$500 million for the team.</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers, who also have contacted the Anschutz group, have an
out in their Qualcomm Stadium lease that could allow them to leave
after the 2003 season if San Diego opts not to match an offer from
another city.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Leiweke, president of Anschutz Entertainment Group, said a
best-case scenario envisions a downtown stadium being constructed in
time for the 2005 season. In the interim, he said, a transplanted
team could play at the Coliseum or Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   But advocates of both of those venues say they are vying to be a
permanent home for an NFL team. Coliseum officials plan to present a
proposal to the Los Angeles City Council today that emphasizes the
viability of their stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, according to a Reuters report, the NFL plans to sell
$200 million of 15-year bonds to generate money to improve old
stadiums and build new ones. In August, the league sold $285 million
of 15-year bonds, nearly double the $150 million planned, for the
same purpose.</TE>

<KH>Lonnie White ON THE NHL</KH>
<HD>Boucher's Eye Injury Was a Scary Sight</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The last time we saw defenseman Philippe Boucher, April 25, he was
being helped off the Pepsi Center ice after getting hit in his right
eye by a puck in Game 5 of the Kings' first-round series against
Colorado.</LD>
<LD>   How Boucher got hurt was bad luck. Over the first four games of
the series, Boucher was a force on the King blue line, giving as much
as he took against Peter Forsberg and company. With 4:41 left in the
first period of Game 5, a shot by Avalanche defenseman Darius
Kasparaitis caromed off a group of players and struck Boucher in the
face.</LD>
<LD>   It was the type of injury that was as bad as it looked and Boucher
knows that if the puck had hit his eye a little cleaner, his hockey
career would be over.</LD>
<TE>   "I have pretty big cheekbones and that took a little bit of the
impact away," said Boucher, who had surgery to repair a detached
retina earlier this month and has only recently begun to get around
on his own again. "It easily could have took my entire eye out."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly a month after suffering his injury, Boucher still
experiences pain whenever he closes his eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of those things that you'll always remember," he said.
"Although I knew that I probably had a concussion, I was conscious
the whole time. Everything slowed down from the moment the puck hit
the guy in front of the net. I saw the puck coming right at me but I
had nowhere to go. There was nothing I could do."</TE>
<TE>   It was the second time this season that Boucher was hit in the
face by a puck. But the first time, he only suffered a broken nose.
The second time, Boucher immediately knew the injury was serious.</TE>
<TE>   "This one hit me so hard, all I could do was go down to the ice
and I knew there was no way I could have gotten up," he said. "You
knew it was bad right away when you try to see and you can't. It's
easy to panic.</TE>
<TE>   "Thinking that my career was over came through my mind. When I was
down on the ice and couldn't see, all kinds of thoughts took over."</TE>
<TE>   If his career was over, Boucher, 29, knew the timing could not
have been worse. After struggling to find his spot as an NHL regular
in his first nine seasons in the league, he finally had stopped
spending time in the minors last season. Since then, he has developed
into a steady two-way defenseman who led the Kings in shots on goal
during the regular season and finished with career-highs in assists,
23, and points, 30.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, Boucher will be an unrestricted free agent in a
market with opportunities for his kind of player. It seems as if
every team needs a defenseman like Boucher and last summer, players
with similar capabilities, such as Jon Klemm and Jason York, signed
big-time free-agent contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Two things helped ease Boucher's mind after he was injured.</TE>
<TE>   King doctors told him that with surgery, he had a 95% chance of
full recovery and that with a follow-up operation the chance rose to
100%.</TE>
<TE>   Then too, Boucher had bought an insurance policy before the start
of this season. Although he had to pay a high premium because of his
history of concussions, Boucher bought the policy, thinking of his
wife, Lucy and son, Matthew.</TE>
<TE>   For the first week after the injury, Boucher seemed to be
recovering well. But when he went for one final checkup before being
released from the hospital, he suffered a setback.</TE>
<TE>   "After the blood on the retina drained, they noticed that I had a
tear on it," he said. "I thought that I was about to go home but
instead, I ended up having emergency surgery the next day."</TE>
<TE>   Boucher hopes to be able to start training again in July. By that
time, he hopes to have heard something from the Kings about his
contract. But he'll also be ready to test free agency after working
so hard to get to this point of his career.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it's going to be a slow process, with my recovery and
[deciding his NHL future], but I'm excited about this summer," he
said. "It's been a long road and I know this is a time that I may be
able to get a good contract and be able to take care of my family."</TE>
<TE>   Once a Whaler and Now a Hurricane</TE>
<TE>   In November 1971, Howard Baldwin and a couple of his business
friends were awarded a World Hockey Assn. franchise, the Hartford
Whalers.</TE>
<TE>   For 17 years, Baldwin was the main man behind the Whalers. He
watched them gain world attention when they signed Gordie Howe and
his sons, Mark and Marty, in 1977 and then join the NHL in 1979.
Baldwin also watched the Whalers grow into one of the league's most
stable franchises until his group sold the team in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Baldwin has moved full time to Southern California and
now heads Crusader Entertainment, a film production company that has
as a financial resource, King owner Philip Anschutz's Denver-based
Anschutz Corp. But that has not stopped Baldwin from following the
Whalers, who became the Carolina Hurricanes in 1997 under the
ownership of Peter Karmanos, Jim Rutherford and Thomas Thewes.</TE>
<TE>   "I follow it really closely because, I guess, you can say that I
founded the franchise," Baldwin said of the team, tied with Toronto,
1-1, in the Eastern Conference finals. "I just discovered it in a
different market. My last year with the franchise was 1988 but you
still can't help but keep track of what's going on."</TE>
<TE>   Baldwin said his best move with the Whalers was drafting Ron
Francis in 1981. Francis, in his second stint with the franchise, was
an All-Star center for the Hurricanes at 39 this season.</TE>
<TE>   But even if the Hurricanes go on to win the Stanley Cup, Baldwin
isn't ready to get back into owning an NHL team. Crusader
Entertainment, which produced the hockey-themed movie, "Mystery,
Alaska," is doing well with three features being released this year
and six more in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't miss it because I'm plenty busy doing what I'm
doing now with the film company," Baldwin said. "I started the
Whalers and it was seven years of extraordinary ups and downs.... But
in hindsight ... it was probably way easier to manage the team back
then than how teams have it today.</TE>
<TE>   "It has become a business where, unless you are extremely wealthy,
it's become a very tough business to succeed in."</TE>

<DH>Record-setting Ochoa begins final NCAA event before turning
pro</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER YOON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The NCAA women's golf tournament starts today, and Lorena Ochoa can
feel the heat. A sophomore at Arizona, Ochoa has turned college golf
upside down with a record-setting season. She won an NCAA-record
seven consecutive tournaments before finishing second in the Pac-10
tournament, then won again May 11 at the NCAA West Regional.</LD>
<LD>   "Almost perfect," she said.</LD>
<LD>   Her eight victories are a single-season record, and she begins her
quest for a ninth today in Seattle. She knows everyone wants to beat
her, and she wouldn't have it any other way.</LD>
<TE>   "I like being the one everyone wants to beat," Ochoa said. "To me,
that is why I play golf. I know they are out to beat me, but I want
to beat them too."</TE>
<TE>   Ochoa, the top-ranked woman in the nation, has a season scoring
average of 70, more than a stroke better than the NCAA-record 71.33
she set last season. She has scored her nine victories by an average
margin of five strokes, has shot under par in 22 of 26 rounds and has
11 rounds in the 60s. But in a sport in which egos and jealousy often
go hand in hand with competition, there is little animosity toward
the humble, soft-spoken 20-year-old from Guadalajara, Mexico. Not
only is she the player everyone wants to beat, she's also the player
everyone wants to chat with after the round.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost like you're rooting for her," said Katherine Hull of
Pepperdine, who is ranked third in the nation and has finished second
to Ochoa three times. "I want to beat her--everyone wants to beat
her--but what she has done is so awesome, and she has the personality
to boot. It's not often that happens in golf."</TE>
<TE>   Ochoa is a rarity in more ways than one. Her hobbies include
triathlons, half-marathons, mountain biking and snowboarding. She
also comes from a country where golf is not exactly the national
sport.</TE>
<TE>   At first, Ochoa shied from the attention that came with being a
Mexican-born woman golfer, but she has learned to embrace her status
as a pioneer.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's good for the game," said Ochoa, who won seven
Mexican junior championships and a record five consecutive Junior
World championships. "In Mexico, they don't know about golf, but if I
can help to change that, then that is a good thing. I think I can
inspire people to play golf."</TE>
<TE>   Even in Southern California, Ochoa has made an impact. During her
recent visit to play in the LPGA's Kraft Nabisco Championship in
Rancho Mirage, Ochoa noticed Latinos in her gallery.</TE>
<TE>   "I was surprised they came out to see me play," she said. "But I
was very happy to see them. They were all cheering for me. It was
nice to see."</TE>
<TE>   She drives the ball about 265 yards, long by women's standards,
and is deadly accurate with her irons and around the greens. And she
relishes the opportunity to think her way around the course.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a challenge unique to golf," she said. "You have so many
things to think about when you are on the course, but you have to
control your mind for every shot. That is an incredible challenge,
and that is what I love the most about golf."</TE>
<TE>   It all translates to a game that seems more than ready for the
LPGA Tour. Ochoa played three LPGA tournaments on sponsors'
exemptions earlier this year. She finished tied for 37th, tied for
fifth and then eighth at the Nabisco, an LPGA major. The NCAA
tournament ends Friday, and Ochoa has scheduled a news conference
Saturday, at which she is expected to announce her intention to turn
pro.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything is set for me to turn pro," she said. "But you never
know. If I don't feel 100% ready after this week, I won't turn pro."</TE>
<TE>   Ochoa has little left to prove in college golf. She has finished
first or second in 17 of her 19 tournaments, third and ninth in the
others, and has a scoring average of 70.71. She has shot over par
only 11 times in 56 rounds and is 44 under for her career.</TE>
<TE>   "She really doesn't have any weaknesses," Arizona Coach Greg Allen
said. "She plays very aggressive on the course, but she has the game
to do that. When she misses, she gets it up and down."</TE>
<TE>   Equally impressive is how she has earned the respect of opponents
with her demeanor.</TE>
<TE>   "She's very nice, very genuine, yet she loves to compete, to play
and to win," said Pepperdine Coach Laurie Gibbs. "It's an incredible
mix. Of course, my players want to beat her, but at the same time,
you just like her. She brings a lot to women's golf, and she is going
to make a huge impact when she turns pro."</TE>
<TE>   As a freshman, Ochoa won three times and finished second four
times in 10 tournaments and was selected national player of the year.
She lost a one-hole playoff to Candy Hanneman of Duke in the NCAA
final.</TE>
<TE>   She set unprecedented goals at the beginning of this season: to
win every tournament and to finish with a stroke average of lower
than 70. At first, teammates brushed those aside as golfer-speak, but
then she won seven in a row, eclipsing the previous NCAA mark of five
and the single-season victory mark of six.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought maybe she didn't set her goals high enough," Allen
said.</TE>
<TE>   The lone blemish for Ochoa this year is something she still
doesn't like to talk about. Looking for an eighth consecutive
victory, she held a four-shot lead during the second round of the
Pac-10 tournament after an eagle at No. 10 left her five-under for
the tournament. What followed was an unthinkable collapse in Ochoa's
mind: bogey, bogey, bogey, double bogey, par, bogey.</TE>
<TE>   Ochoa blamed a mental lapse.</TE>
<TE>   "It happened so fast," she said. "I couldn't control my mind. I
was thinking about all kinds of things. My winning streak, the course
record, everything except what I should have been thinking."</TE>
<TE>   The streak ended after the final round the next day, when her
12-foot birdie putt on No. 18 stopped two inches short. Had she made
it, she and Jimin Kang of Arizona State would have gone to a playoff.
Ochoa cried. At first, she said, she thought they were tears of
sadness, but now she realizes they were tears of relief.</TE>
<TE>   "I was putting so much pressure on myself to win every
tournament," she said. "I hate to lose, obviously, but I'm almost
glad the streak is over. I learned from losing, and there is less
pressure going into the nationals with no streak. I think it's better
this way."</TE>

<HD>Situation Is Fluid Before, After Loss</HD>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Kobe Bryant's Monday began 90 minutes after midnight, somewhere south
of nasty, an after-dinner kink becoming an awful awakening.</LD>
<LD>   That was no cheeseburger in paradise.</LD>
<LD>   "He was doubled over like a shrimp," said Laker trainer Gary
Vitti.</LD>
<TE>   Bryant's day got worse at dawn, after the food poisoning had
dehydrated him beyond Gatorade, when the first of three liter bags of
fluids was hooked up into his arm.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually a guy takes one or two," Vitti said.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant spent the pregame warmups like some people spend hospital
stays, on his back and attached to a bag.</TE>
<TE>   He spent the next three hours in a much more curious state.</TE>
<TE>   As a human.</TE>
<TE>   He scored, but he stumbled. He was terrific, then tepid, then just
plain tired.</TE>
<TE>   When the fourth quarter finally showed up, he didn't.</TE>
<TE>   And when the Lakers had a chance to essentially finish the Western
Conference finals after two games, they couldn't.</TE>
<TE>   Was their 96-90 loss to the Sacramento Kings at Arco Arena--tying
the series at one game apiece--a mere coincidence?</TE>
<TE>   There will ultimately be two ways of looking at it.</TE>
<TE>   They would have won this game if Bryant were Bryant, and will
prove that again beginning in Game 3 Friday at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Or, for want of a food taster, a championship was lost.</TE>
<TE>   Only one thing is for certain.</TE>
<TE>   "Next time I order a cheeseburger, I'm going to McDonald's,"
Bryant said.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of the Lakers' first road playoff loss in two years,
silly conspiracy theories abounded.</TE>
<TE>   In the Hyatt hotel where the Lakers were staying, where Bryant
ordered the bacon cheeseburger that allegedly caused the illness, he
was the only Laker to get sick.</TE>
<TE>   This, even though other Lakers also ordered room service.</TE>
<TE>   Then once the game started, according to the Lakers, the referees
poisoned the scoreboard by unfairly giving the Kings 13 more foul
shots that they converted into eight more points.</TE>
<TE>   "There's only one way to beat us," said Shaquille O'Neal, who was
charged with three offensive fouls and four overall. "It begins with
'C' and ends with 'T.' The real basketball fans know what is going on
here.''</TE>
<TE>   Funny, but hasn't virtually every vanquished Laker playoff
opponent in the last three years felt cheated?</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal was right, there is only one way to beat the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   But it starts with "K" and ends with "E."</TE>
<TE>   When Bryant has a stomachache, the Lakers are doubled over like,
well, shrimp.</TE>
<TE>   When he plays with a left-arm sweat band covering the bandage that
covered the spot where the IV needles were inserted, it's not a good
thing.</TE>
<TE>   "They just played better than us," Bryant said afterward. "We just
have to live with this."</TE>
<TE>   He sounded like his old self. And certainly, by Friday, he surely
will be.</TE>
<TE>   But at times Monday, he was a mere shadow.</TE>
<TE>   "Kobe struggled," Coach Phil Jackson said. "I think he carried it
pretty well but defensively, energy-wise, you could tell he was
limited."</TE>
<TE>   In all areas, really.</TE>
<TE>   He made only nine of 21 shots. He had more turnovers (four) than
assists (two).</TE>
<TE>   And in the fourth quarter, with the Lakers trailing by a dozen and
7:14 remaining, the world's best fourth-quarter player was in a most
incredible spot.</TE>
<TE>   On the bench.</TE>
<TE>   "In certain spurts I had a lot of energy, and in some I didn't,"
Bryant said. "I just tried to pace myself for three quarters, and
then hopefully we'd get within striking distance, and then the energy
I saved up, I'd be able to put it all out when the game is on the
line."</TE>
<TE>   But that never happened.</TE>
<TE>   After sitting for about four minutes, he came back into the game
just in time to allow a three-pointer by Mike Bibby without so much
as a leap in his face.</TE>
<TE>   And even though he hit a three-pointer to bring the Lakers to
within three with 12.5 seconds remaining ... when it came down to a
shot that could bring them to within one point in the final moments
... that shot was taken by Rick Fox.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, it was the shot Jackson wanted. "We wanted something we could
get up quick," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And on this day, Bryant was anything but.</TE>
<TE>   The record for points in a playoff game while suffering food
poisoning--38 by Michael Jordan in 1997--is safe.</TE>
<TE>   The assuredness with which the Lakers were going to win this
series is not.</TE>

<LD>Sylmar and Los Angeles Roosevelt highs were seeded first and second
Monday when the City Section baseball playoff pairings were released
after piling up victories in relatively weak leagues.</LD>
<LD>   Woodland Hills El Camino Real, which won the heralded West Valley
League by three games, was selected as the third-seeded team. The
Conquistadores would have had a strong case for being the top-seeded
team--if they hadn't lost to Sylmar and Roosevelt earlier this
season.</LD>
<LD>   "It doesn't matter," El Camino Real Coach Matt LaCour said of the
seedings. "You're going to have to play them all to win this thing
anyway."</LD>
<TE>   Said Sylmar Coach Gary Donatella: "To me, the one, two, three
seeds--you could flip a coin. There's not much of a difference."</TE>
<TE>   Roosevelt is trying to break the San Fernando Valley's iron grip
on section championships; Valley teams have won 28 of the last 29
titles. But the Roughriders will do well just to get past Cleveland,
their first-round opponent. The Cavaliers, who defeated league rival
Chatsworth in three of four meetings, were somehow relegated to No.
15.</TE>
<TE>   "We're happy to get in," Cleveland Coach Joe Cascione said. "I
didn't think we were going to get in because we finished fourth in
our league."</TE>
<TE>   The bottom half of the bracket, which includes three West Valley
League teams, is the toughest. Sixth-seeded Chatsworth's Joe Guntz
will battle 11th-seeded Granada Hills Kennedy's Adam Geery on Friday
in a first-round matchup of top-notch pitchers. The Chancellors might
be a good bet to win the championship because No. 6-seeded teams have
won five of the last 10 titles; No. 1-seeded teams won in the other
years.</TE>
<TE>   A clerical error kept Coliseum League champion Crenshaw out of the
playoffs. The Cougars had to forfeit four league games after two
players were mistakenly left off an eligibility list sent to the
section office before the start of league play. Fremont, which
finished second, was awarded the league's automatic playoff entry.</TE>

<LD>Pasadena La Salle was declared Southern Section Division IV girls'
track and field co-champion with North Hills L.A. Baptist on Monday
after being awarded second place in the divisional finals at Cerritos
College on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   L.A. Baptist outscored La Salle, 79-74, according to the official
results released Saturday. But L.A. Baptist's Nikki Marquez had been
mistakenly awarded five points for finishing in a tie for third in
the shotput when she actually placed a non-scoring eighth. With the
correction, each team finished with 74 points.</LD>

<HD>Riverside Poly's Wooding Is a Cut Above</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Peter Yoon; Lauren Peterson</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Josh Wooding came to the Southern Section Individual golf
championships looking only to survive the cut. He left hauling the
hardware of a champion.</LD>
<LD>   Wooding, a junior from Riverside Poly, birdied his last three
holes in the shotgun tournament Monday at Canyon Country Club in Palm
Springs, and shot four-under-par 68 to win by two shots.</LD>
<LD>   Henry Liaw of Hacienda Heights Los Altos, Kyle Dowden of Camarillo
and Jay Choi of Cerritos Gahr each shot 70. Liaw finished second and
Dowden was third after a two-hole playoff.</LD>
<TE>   Wooding, 17, battled through the gusting winds that took a toll on
scoring. His winning score is the highest since Brian Sinay of Irvine
University won with a 69 in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Wooding made the turn at two under before the winds peaked at
around 25 mph, but he adjusted and finished strong.</TE>
<TE>   "The main goal was just to get through," Wooding said. "You always
think about winning, but when you get here, you put your tee in the
ground and just try to survive."</TE>
<TE>   The top 22 advance to the CIF-Southern California Golf Assn.
Championships on June 4 at the SCGA Members Club in Murrieta. Five
players advanced through a six-way playoff that lasted two holes.</TE>
<TE>   Wooding, who hit within eight feet on No. 13, within five feet on
No. 14 and made a 12-foot birdie putt on No. 15 to close out, didn't
think his score would hold up to win.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just hanging around most of the round," Wooding said. "I
thought with this field any of these guys could shoot way under par.
The greens were so pure, I thought it would be a 65 or 66 easy, but
it's nice to see your name up there with [past champions] like Tiger
Woods and Billy Casper."</TE>
<TE>   Liaw, the reigning U.S. Junior Amateur champion, battled a balky
driver most of the day, but stayed in the round with hot putting. He
birdied the final two holes to get in the playoff for second place.</TE>
<TE>   "I just kept thinking positive," he said. "I had winning on my
mind, but I figured that no matter how bad I play, I have to get
through."</TE>
<TE>   Dowden, a junior, came with a go-for-broke attitude. He made four
birdies, including a 25-foot putt from the fringe on No. 16, to go
with two bogeys.</TE>
<TE>   "I went at a lot of pins," Dowden said. "I figured with this
field--this is national quality--someone would shoot in the 60s. To
me, it feels great to be in third."</TE>

<HD>Nets' Van Horn Is Best Viewed in Soft Focus</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>They call Keith Van Horn enigmatic. And that's the compliment.</LD>
<LD>   Van Horn's New Jersey Net teammate, Kenyon Martin, has used some
impolite words while calling on Van Horn "to dunk the darn
basketball." Van Horn's coach, Byron Scott, has begged him to be
meaner, tougher, nastier, more focused, more passionate, more like a
superstar and less like a contented backup.</LD>
<LD>   Opponents whisper that Van Horn is soft and is wasting good
talent, and that the Nets are wasting good money. Sometimes Van Horn
feels as if playing on the road is better than at home. He is booed
less often on the road.</LD>
<TE>   What is it, then? Did the Nets overrate Van Horn when they gave
him a long-term contract that paid him $10,865,250 this year and will
pay him $15,694,250 annually by 2005-06, and expected him to be a
marquee player? Is he a waste? A smaller version of Shawn Bradley, a
confounding mass of talent lost in the body of a man who might be
happier being a husband, a father and a 20-minute-a-game back-row
understudy?</TE>
<TE>   A child of Southern California, reared in Diamond Bar where he
played pickup games at a place called Ronald Reagan Park--and who can
possibly become a hard-hearted, don't-get-in-my-way bad boy while
playing at Ronald Reagan Park?--the freshman Van Horn was told by his
college coach at Utah, Rick Majerus, to gain some weight and become a
man.</TE>
<TE>   It has always seemed as if Van Horn has been tormented by his
talent and the expectations that talent has brought to him.</TE>
<TE>   "Keith can do so many things with the basketball," Martin said.
Martin is Van Horn's opposite, a player possessed by too much energy
and desire and enthusiasm, a man cursed by his emotions and often
left on the bench because he was put there by his own anger and
referees who don't get him.</TE>
<TE>   "When I got in his face about dunking, it was only to help him,"
Martin said. "I would want someone to tell me what they saw. What I
see is a man who is 6-10, who can run the floor with anybody and who
has all the shots. He just doesn't always have confidence."</TE>
<TE>   At times this season Van Horn has poured out his soul to Kerry
Kittles, telling his teammate how he lost his confidence and belief
in himself. At times this season Van Horn has railed publicly about
lack of playing time, even as Scott was saying he wanted to play Van
Horn more if only Van Horn would act as if he wanted to be on the
court.</TE>
<TE>   "There [were] times," point guard Jason Kidd said, "you could see
Keith was hesitating on every shot. He wasn't doing things naturally,
in rhythm. Maybe he was thinking too much. Things were bothering him
too much."</TE>
<TE>   When Van Horn, 26, was a rookie in 1997-98, he led the Nets in
scoring, was on the NBA all-rookie first team and was an astounding
surprise to Net fans, who had grumbled at his selection because of
all those faults they thought he had--too soft, too unaggressive, too
darn nice.</TE>
<TE>   And of all the surprises about the rookie, nothing was as amazing
as how Van Horn became best buddies with Jayson Williams, the
big-mouthed, foul-mouthed, oversized personality who played hard and
lived hard. It has bothered Van Horn immensely this year to see the
former Net center indicted on nine counts, including a charge of
aggravated manslaughter, in the February shooting that left a man
dead in Williams' home.</TE>
<TE>   As good as he was as a rookie, Van Horn was even better the next
season. He averaged 21.8 points and 8.5 rebounds, although he played
only 42 games because of a broken thumb. Injury aside, Van Horn was
turning into a franchise player, a go-to guy, a young man of great
character who could lead the Nets into the uncharted territory of
deep playoff runs and a packed arena.</TE>
<TE>   In his third season, though his scoring (19.2) and rebounding
(8.4) averages dropped a bit, Van Horn played 80 games and seemed
deserving of his big, new contract. But a year later Van Horn spent
32 games on the injured list with a broken leg. His scoring dropped
to 17 points a game and rebounds to 7.1. And this season his scoring
average has dropped again, to 14.8.</TE>
<TE>   Now people were asking what it was the Nets were stuck with.</TE>
<TE>   "You definitely start wondering how much you are capable of," Van
Horn said. "... In my mind, I don't think I lost faith in myself. But
maybe I did, a little. You begin to wonder if you can ever contribute
what is expected of you."</TE>
<TE>   Against Boston Sunday night, during New Jersey's 104-97 victory in
Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals, Van Horn showed all the
parts of his game, good and bad.</TE>
<TE>   Van Horn made an on-the-run blind pass to Martin for a dunk and
perfect cuts that resulted in three slams for himself. But twice Van
Horn took passes from Kidd when wide open for three-point shots. Once
he double-clutched and threw up a brick. Once he looked at the
basket, cocked his arm as if to shoot, then threw a pass to a
surprised Martin, who stumbled and shot an off-balance jump shot.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd booed, but only softly. The Nets were winning, after
all, and what was the point?</TE>
<TE>   Van Horn is what he is. A player of great talent. A player of some
ego but maybe not enough. A player who will get mad but not all the
time, who will be pushed but who won't always push back. A man who
didn't beg for all the money but who takes it, who didn't ask to be a
superstar but who could be. And isn't. But might be. Or not.</TE>

<HD>Carlos Rules Out France as a Favorite</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What is the world to make of France's startling 2-1 loss to Belgium
on Saturday, the first home defeat in three years for the reigning
World Cup and European champion?</LD>
<LD>   A fluke, to be attributed mostly to the absence of star attackers
Zinedine Zidane and Thierry Henry?</LD>
<LD>   Or a sign that the World Cup holders are vulnerable as they
prepare to defend the title they won at home four summers ago?</LD>
<TE>   Brazil defender Roberto Carlos not only believes France is
beatable this time around, but doesn't even list the French among his
top four favorites to win the trophy in Asia.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos, perhaps still stinging from Brazil's 3-0 loss to France in
the 1998 World Cup final, told FIFAworldcup.com that Brazil should
rate with Italy, England and Argentina as the teams most likely to
contend for the 2002 championship.</TE>
<TE>   France, Carlos said, is "not among the quartet of favorites this
year. It's my view that the Asian setting will be very different from
that of the last World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1998, France saw it as their absolute duty to win their first
title. But it's their only world title.... This time around, things
will be a lot less straightforward for the French team.</TE>
<TE>   "They will come up against teams who will be much more motivated
to beat them because they are entering the tournament with the tag of
hot favorites.</TE>
<TE>   "They're going to experience the kind of pressure Brazil have had
to live with for decades, and commencing a World Cup campaign under
such conditions is far from easy, I can assure you."</TE>
<TE>   Belgium defeated France in Paris on an injury-time goal by Marc
Wilmots. France was playing at less than full strength, missing both
midfielder Zidane, who was at home for the birth of his third child,
and striker Henry, who was out because of a strained knee.</TE>
<TE>   French midfielder Patrick Vieira said the loss "will perhaps bring
us down to earth.... Don't worry, we'll be ready for May 31 [when
France opens the tournament against Senegal]. We're confident, we
know what we're capable of."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's 2-0 loss to the Netherlands did little to buoy U.S. hopes
as it prepares for its World Cup opener against Portugal, although in
the interest of straw-grasping there is this: Portugal midfielder
Luis Figo, the 2001 FIFA World player of the year, has been virtually
ruled out of Saturday's friendly match with China because of an ankle
injury.</TE>
<TE>   Hobbled by the injury, which he first sustained in February, Figo
was ineffective in Real Madrid's 2-1 victory over Bayer Leverkusen in
last week's European Champions League final and eventually had to be
removed from the game.</TE>
<TE>   Team doctors are considering holding Figo out of the China match
as Portugal readies for its June 5 World Cup opener against the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   "I sincerely want to perform to the best of my ability at the
World Cup without problem or pain," Figo told reporters at the
Portuguese team's training camp in Macau. "Whatever I can do to help
my team, I will do my best to do it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Germany lost yet another key player Monday when the team announced
playmaking midfielder Sebastian Deisler would miss the World Cup
because of a knee injury sustained in Saturday's 6-2 victory over
Austria.</TE>
<TE>   Deisler hurt his right knee during a first-half collision with
Austria's Rolf Landerl.</TE>
<TE>   A scan taken Sunday indicated no torn ligaments, but a medical
examination Monday showed that the injury was more severe than
originally thought.</TE>
<TE>   Deisler is the fourth potential World Cup starter Germany has lost
to injury, joining defenders Christian Worns and Jens Nowotny and
midfielder Mehmet Scholl.</TE>

<HD>Right on Track</HD>
<DH>There's a method to Bundy's athletic rise at Cleveland High</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>During a banquet for the track and field team at Reseda Cleveland
High, students who compiled a grade-point average of 3.0 or better
received a scholar-athlete award.</LD>
<LD>   Randy Bundy didn't get one, causing his mother, Janet, to walk out
in the middle of the banquet.</LD>
<LD>   When Bundy got home, his mother greeted him with a loud, firm
warning.</LD>
<TE>   "When you get your next progress report, it better be over 3.0 or
it's the end of your track season," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Bundy knew his mother wasn't bluffing. And so did his friends.</TE>
<TE>   "They're scared of my mother," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Last February, Bundy accepted a football scholarship to
California. On Thursday, he'll be favored to win the 400 meters at
the City Section track championships at Birmingham High. Next week,
he could win the state championship.</TE>
<TE>   None of his athletic or academic achievements would have been
possible without the intervention and support of his mother.</TE>
<TE>   "I want my mom to be happy," Bundy said. "I feel she's the only
person I have. She loves to go to track meets. She loves going to
football games. I can hear her voice over everything."</TE>
<TE>   Janet is a single parent rearing three children. She's a social
worker who drives one hour each day from Northridge to San Bernardino
County. She's also earning her master's degree in psychology and
counseling.</TE>
<TE>   She has been adamant about setting high expectations for her
oldest child.</TE>
<TE>   "She knows what buttons to press to make me do what I have to do,"
Bundy said. "Now that I think about it, it was for the best."</TE>
<TE>   It's something for a 17-year-old finally to admit his mother is
right.</TE>
<TE>   Teenage life is about testing boundaries and questioning parental
authority. Those who make it are the ones who eventually learn
something from disagreements with their parents.</TE>
<TE>   Bundy had no choice but to listen to his mother. He couldn't make
excuses because her experiences as a social worker exposed her to
every trick imaginable.</TE>
<TE>   "She sees a lot of stuff," he said. "She knows all the games,
everything. There's no excuses acceptable. No matter what, she
thinks, 'Oh, you're trying to outsmart me.' You can come up with wild
stories, but I just gave up. I get more telling her the truth than
trying to make something up."</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, Bundy was ordered by his mother to take chemistry and
physics in summer school to help lessen his senior class load.</TE>
<TE>   "He cried all summer," Janet said. "He didn't want to do it. He
said this was his last summer and he wanted to have fun. I told him,
'Oh, yeah, you're going to have some fun, but [by] going to school.'
Now his friends are struggling with mandatory classes, and he's
kicking back."</TE>
<TE>   Said Bundy: "I was arguing until the last day of summer school.
Now I see a lot of people stressing out."</TE>
<TE>   Bundy has so many chores to do at home that no one in college will
have to worry about him in the dorms.</TE>
<TE>   He has been in charge of cleaning the bathroom, mopping the floor,
washing dishes, making his bed, baby-sitting....</TE>
<TE>   About the only thing he can't do is cook.</TE>
<TE>   "He burnt spaghetti," Janet said.</TE>
<TE>   Speed is what makes the 5-foot-11, 165-pound Bundy a promising
football prospect. With 4.5 speed for 40 yards, he'll be a wide
receiver for the Golden Bears.</TE>
<TE>   In the 400, he finished third at the City finals the last two
seasons, but at Mount San Antonio College last month, he won in a
career-best 47.81. The 400 is a grueling race that Bundy uses as a
test of character and commitment.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like my whole body aches," he said. "You feel it all day,
the next day, all weekend. There's not a point you can slow down.
Even when you're trying to relax, you have to run. The last 50, 75
meters is all heart."</TE>
<TE>   Bundy has learned from his mother to devote as much energy to his
studies as he does his sports.</TE>
<TE>   "You're a role model whether you know it or not," Janet told him.
"You have to set yourself above the rest. If it's common [that]
athletes don't do well in school, then you make it a point to do
well. I don't expect you to be a straight-A student, but I have to
know and see you are doing everything you can do."</TE>
<TE>   Bundy doesn't blush if someone calls him "a mama's boy," because
he knows what his mother's contributions have done for him.</TE>
<TE>   "She's gotten me ready for everything," he said.</TE>

<HD>Duncan Remains a Triple Threat</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nicole Duncan enters competition at the NCAA Division II outdoor
track and field championships in San Angelo, Texas, on Thursday as
the defending long jump champion.</LD>
<LD>   By Saturday, she may be among the most decorated athletes in Cal
State Los Angeles history.</LD>
<LD>   Duncan, a senior, has won five NCAA titles, four of them indoors.
At the Division II meet, she is expected to win her fourth
consecutive long jump title--two outdoors, two indoors--in a two-year
span. The native of Kingston, Jamaica, also is the favorite in the
100 meters and a prime contender in the 200.</LD>
<TE>   Despite her accomplishments, Duncan was unsure of her ability
until this season.</TE>
<TE>   "I've matured a lot more and I understand my events more," she
said. "Last year, I was just running. Now I feel I'm a lot more
mentally prepared for each event."</TE>
<TE>   Duncan believes she can win all three of her events. She runs the
100 preliminaries and semifinals Thursday and the 200 preliminaries
on Friday. The long jump and sprint finals are on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The schedule could be her biggest obstacle. The long jump
competition starts 20 minutes before the 100-meter final.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year it happened with the long jump and the 200," Duncan
said. "I had to keep going back and forth. Finally, I just forgot
about the 200. But I've studied the schedule and looked at all the
sheets and I think I can do it."</TE>
<TE>   She comes into the meet having won all three events at the
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. meet two weeks ago at UC San
Diego. One more national title would set a school record.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a good year," Duncan said. "I just thank God for
everything that's happened to me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As expected, the women's portion of the Pacific 10 Conference
track and field championships turned into another tight finish
between UCLA and USC.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins edged the Trojans, 160-157, at Pullman, Wash., in a
meet that was decided on the last event--the 1,600-meter relay.
Sheena Johnson took the lead on the third leg and Monique Henderson
took it from there as UCLA won the race in 3 minutes 31.97 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Lena Nilsson won the 800 and 1,500 meters for UCLA, which has won
the last six women's championships. Other Bruin winners were Johnson
in the 400 hurdles and Chaniqua Ross in the discus throw.</TE>
<TE>   Angela Williams, a three-time NCAA 100-meter champion, won that
event for USC. Other Trojan winners were Nakiya Johnson in the 400,
Natasha Neal in the 100 hurdles, Tatyana Obukhova in the triple jump
and Inga Stasiulionyte in the javelin.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, after UCLA won the conference title, USC defeated the
Bruins for its first NCAA championship. That meet is coming up, May
30-June 2 in Baton Rouge, La.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford claimed the Pac-10 men's title, with USC taking third and
UCLA sixth. USC won three events--Ryan Wilson in the 110 hurdles,
Julien Kapek in the triple jump and the 400-meter relay team. UCLA
winners were Scott Moser in the discus and Scott Wiegand in the shot
put.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cal State Northridge won the Big West Conference women's track and
field title Saturday at UC Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Annetta Wells of Northridge was chosen Big West athlete of
the year after winning the 200 and 400-meter titles. The Matadors
also got victories from Aisha Morgan in the 100, Heather Heron in the
100 hurdles, LaShaunda Fowler in the long jump, Dee Scott in the
triple jump, Laura Sauao in the hammer throw and Sammie Freeman in
the javelin.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After getting past stubborn South Carolina to win the NCAA
softball regional at Columbia, S.C., UCLA (54-7) will play Florida
State (53-18) Thursday morning at 8 to open play at the Women's
College World Series in Oklahoma City.</TE>
<TE>   The top-ranked Bruins are also top-seeded in the
double-elimination tournament. They have reached the championship
game the last three years, winning their eighth NCAA title in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   In Thursday's other matchups, California (52-19) plays 2000
champion Oklahoma (49-14), Arizona State (44-18) faces Michigan
(50-9) and Nebraska (49-12) plays defending champion Arizona (52-11).</TE>
<TE>   The championship game is Monday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine was the only local team to advance out of the NCAA West
Regional men's golf tournament with a fifth-place finish at
Albuquerque. Jason Allred tied for eighth individually by shooting an
even-par 216 for 54 holes. USC, which had been ranked seventh in the
nation by GolfWeek magazine, finished 18th. UCLA sophomore John
Merrick advanced to the NCAA championships next week by shooting even
par.... Freshman Roberta Stewart became the first Long Beach State
player to be first-team All-American in women's water polo.... Turhan
Douglas has been hired as interim men's volleyball coach at USC.
Douglas, 32, was an assistant the last three years under Pat Powers,
who resigned in April.</TE>

<HD>Draft Audit Faults $2.4-Billion L.A. Unified Bond Program</HD>
<DH>Schools: State report alleges mismanagement but will be
reworked to reflect improvements.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOUG SMITH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A draft of a state audit alleges that voters may have been misled
into approving a $2.4-billion Los Angeles school repair and
construction bond program in 1997 and that the funds were extensively
mismanaged. But after protests from the school district, the report
will be reworked to reflect recent oversight improvements, officials
said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The draft audit from state Controller Kathleen Connell's office
says the Los Angeles Unified School District improperly paid
consultants, failed to report millions of dollars in spending, dipped
into bond funds for some unrelated district expenses and paid
excessive management fees. One striking contention is that the
district may have led voters into thinking that the measure,
Proposition BB, would pay for all needed repairs as well as build 85
new schools. The auditors project that a shortfall of $1.52 billion
remains to reach that goal.</LD>
<LD>   The draft audit, a copy of which was obtained by The Times, also
stresses that the committee of residents set up as a watchdog for
Proposition BB spending was ineffective.</LD>
<TE>   Connell's office presented the draft to the district earlier this
month for comment. Outraged district officials launched a rebuttal
accusing the auditors of dredging up old history and misrepresenting
the intent of Proposition BB.</TE>
<TE>   From the inception of BB, school district officials and members of
the citizens committee have said the completion of the needed work
would require another bond measure.</TE>
<TE>   After a meeting Monday, Connell and L.A. Unified Supt. Roy Romer
said they agreed to clarify that most of the problems occurred before
he installed a new management team. Romer, the former governor of
Colorado, became superintendent in 2000, the third year of the
spending program.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Monday, Connell conceded that most of the problems
identified in the audit preceded Romer's new team and that many have
been solved.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone agreed that there had been a transition," she said.
"Everyone agreed that we were on higher ground today."</TE>
<TE>   The district is particularly sensitive to the criticism because it
is preparing a new bond measure for the November ballot to complete
the massive construction program. The mounting allegations of
waste--some from the district's own auditors--may hamper the
district's efforts to convince voters that it can handle a new bond
measure, the size of which is still uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   That local bond vote may be on the ballot at the same time as a
$13-billion statewide school construction bond measure. After hearing
testimony about BB two weeks ago, the Los Angeles City Council
rescinded its endorsement of the state bond measure and intends to
urge the state to include a mechanism for accountability.</TE>
<TE>   Connell said she was disheartened that The Times planned to
publish details of the draft. It is not unusual, she said, for early
stages of an audit to have strong language that is later modified or
cut.</TE>
<TE>   Among other charges, the draft says the district wasted nearly $20
million in a failed effort to put a big chunk of the 300 air
conditioning projects in a single "fast track" contract. After two
years of bidding and negotiations, the district signed a $155-million
contract with a Denver-based joint venture.</TE>
<TE>   According to the draft, contract disputes arose and the district
eventually agreed to pay the firm $19.3 million without any air
conditioners being installed. A district spokeswoman said the
contract was so flawed that the district realized it could do the
work faster and more cheaply on its own, even after the big payout.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition BB was touted to voters as the antidote to decades of
neglected maintenance and stagnant new-school construction.</TE>
<TE>   The draft audit faults the district for not making it clear in the
1997 ballot statement that "the bond proceeds would not fully fund
all projects."</TE>
<TE>   Voters "may have been led to believe" that the money would bring
all the district's 800 schools into good condition and add enough
classrooms for bulging enrollment. The district says it never
intended for BB to pay for all that and denies any deception.</TE>
<TE>   Connell and Romer said the redrafted audit will include a timeline
showing which of the problems predated the current team and which
ones still need to be addressed.</TE>
<TE>   District officials conceded last year that the program to repair
hundreds of schools was $600 million short of its goal. Two internal
audits have blamed excessive management costs and inefficiency.</TE>
<TE>   Based on school district records, The Times reported in February
2000 that work on the 12,000 school repair and modernization projects
was over budget and at least two years behind schedule.</TE>
<TE>   The next month, district Inspector General Don Mullinax delivered
the first of two audits denouncing the management of the bond
program.</TE>
<TE>   He found that the outside firms overseeing BB projects were
charging an average of 20%--far in excess of what other school
districts pay for management costs. The new state audit says the
management fees were actually 24%.</TE>
<TE>   In November 2001, school district officials acknowledged a
$600-million shortfall in BB, which they attributed to escalating
costs, contractual disputes and poor oversight. The shortfall is
jeopardizing the completion of more than half the 12,000 projects.</TE>
<TE>   Romer vowed at the time to make up the funding gap with revenues
such as earned interest, loans and state grants, and he predicted no
further delays in work. All Proposition BB repairs, he said, will be
finished by the end of 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Three months later, Mullinax delivered more bad news in his second
report. The inspector general's consultant, Deloitte &amp; Touche, found
that the team overseeing new school construction had greatly
improved, but that the repair work was still mired in such problems
as poor lines of authority and inadequate cost controls.</TE>
<TE>   Among other findings were that there were too many outside project
managers and that the district's computerized financial system "may
not be capable of providing reliable, detailed or timely data
management of the BB program."</TE>

<HD>Ex-Altar Boy Alleges Priest Abused Him</HD>
<DH>Litigation: Complaint filed under federal racketeering law
claims Mahony protected Father Baker. Cardinal calls the suit
baseless.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GLENN F. BUNTING and RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former altar boy alleged in court papers filed Monday that he was
molested at a Van Nuys church by Father Michael Stephen Baker,
bringing to three the number of victims who say they were abused
after the priest admitted engaging in sexual misconduct to Cardinal
Roger M. Mahony.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit alleges that Baker abused at least a dozen young boys
between 1975 and 1999. The complaint, filed under a federal
racketeering law, states that Mahony and the Roman Catholic
Archdiocese of Los Angeles failed to keep Baker away from children
after his admission, did not report the abuse to authorities and paid
money to victims to keep the misconduct secret.</LD>
<LD>   "Cardinal Roger Mahony belongs in prison for aiding and abetting
Michael Baker, for protecting a pedophile priest," attorney Jeffrey
Anderson told reporters outside the Los Angeles Superior Courthouse
after filing the suit. "The deception has to end.... We have come
forward to say: no more secrets, no more crimes."</LD>
<TE>   Mahony called the racketeering suit "baseless and irresponsible"
in a statement released Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "I will not let these claims distract me from continuing to focus
all of my energies on ... reaching out to victims of clergy abuse and
their families, assisting with their spiritual and emotional healing,
and expanding our programs to protect children throughout the
archdiocese," the statement said.</TE>
<TE>   Baker and his attorney, Donald Steier, could not be reached for
comment Monday. In previous interviews, Baker acknowledged telling
Mahony in a 1986 meeting that he had abused "two or three" children.
Baker said the cardinal did not press him for details and he did not
provide any.</TE>
<TE>   The Times reported last week that Mahony transferred Baker to nine
parishes after learning about the priest's history of sex abuse and
later approved a secret $1.3-million settlement to two men. The
victims' attorney, Lynne M. Cadigan of Tucson, said the archdiocese
insisted on a strict confidentiality clause.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony arranged for Baker to quietly retire from the priesthood in
late 2000 without notifying law enforcement authorities or informing
parishioners about the alleged abuses.</TE>
<TE>   The two victims, who are brothers in their 20s now living in
Mexico, alleged in a letter of complaint to the archdiocese that they
had been repeatedly molested by Baker over 15 years. The Times does
not identify victims of sexual abuse without their consent.</TE>
<TE>   The third purported victim to emerge since Mahony learned of
Baker's abuse is identified in the lawsuit only as "John Doe 53." He
was raised in a devoutly Roman Catholic family and served as an altar
boy at St. Elisabeth parish in Van Nuys, according to the suit.</TE>
<TE>   The abuse began in 1990 when the altar boy was 12 or 13 years old
and continued for about three years, said attorney Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   "This happened after Baker's cozy chat with Mahony,"
Anderson said. "What did [Mahony] do with that? Nothing.... All of
these victims suffered in secrecy, silence and sham."</TE>
<TE>   Archdiocese records show that Baker lived at St. Elisabeth from
1988 to 1991. The pastor at the time, Father Paul Hruby, said he knew
of no allegations against Baker of sexual abuse during Baker's time
there. Hruby declined to say whether archdiocese officials informed
him of Baker's history when the priest was assigned to the Van Nuys
parish.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's lawsuit was filed on behalf of the former altar boy and
three other men.</TE>
<TE>   One of the four men appeared at the press conference Monday. Matt
Severson, 34, of West Hollywood claimed that Baker abused him for a
decade, beginning in 1976 when he was 9.</TE>
<TE>   "I did not have a voice at that time," Severson said. "I was too
embarrassed to tell anyone. I felt great humiliation and pain."</TE>
<TE>   Severson, called "John Doe 50" in the lawsuit, said he came
forward to "reclaim some of the power that was taken away from me as
a child.... I want an apology, not just for me but for my family. My
family was very devastated."</TE>
<TE>   The suit is the second in which Anderson has cited racketeering
laws against Mahony and the archdiocese. He has also sued under the
federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act on
behalf of alleged victims of Father Carl Sutphin, an associate pastor
at the new downtown cathedral until his recent removal from the
ministry.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson alleges that Mahony's actions amount to a pattern of
illegal activity. RICO lawsuits allow damage awards to be tripled.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said last week he will turn over records to the district
attorney's office on the Baker case and all others, as necessary.
Regarding Baker's files, Mahony said, "We told [LAPD detectives]
whatever they wanted, they could have."</TE>
<TE>   In response to the story in The Times last week, Los Angeles
County District Atty. Steve Cooley warned the cardinal that he would
seek a grand jury investigation unless the Los Angeles archdiocese
turned over all documents related to allegations of sexual abuse by
priests.</TE>

<HD>Project to Ease Bottleneck in Oxnard</HD>
<DH>Traffic: Caltrans will widen the 101 Freeway from six to 12
lanes at the Santa Clara River Bridge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Caltrans began work Monday to ease the bottleneck on the Ventura
Freeway in Oxnard, where traffic comes to a daily standstill at the
Santa Clara River Bridge.</LD>
<LD>   The $114-million project includes widening the freeway from six to
12 lanes and improving the Pacific Coast Highway interchange. Work is
scheduled to be completed in 2006.</LD>
<LD>   "Traffic just tends to get congested in that area," said Kerry
Forsythe, deputy director of the Ventura County Transportation
Commission.</LD>
<TE>   In addition to the thousands of drivers trying to get through the
stretch from Vineyard Avenue to Oxnard Boulevard, the recent
reopening of the adjacent Esplanade shopping mall has brought even
more traffic to the area.</TE>
<TE>   According to 1998 figures from Caltrans, at least 168,000 cars
travel through the stretch each day, but the number is expected to
rise in more recent traffic studies, Forsythe said.</TE>
<TE>   To make matters worse, an additional 79,000 cars are expected to
flow onto the highway and surrounding streets if the RiverPark
mixed-use project is built at the junction.</TE>
<TE>   Groundbreaking for the 700-acre project, being developed across
the freeway from the Esplanade, could get underway by late this
summer. It is not scheduled to be completed until after the bridge is
widened.</TE>
<TE>   The $750-million mini-city would include about 2,800 dwellings
centered on village greens, a vintage town square, a first-class
hotel and convention center, three schools and a sports field.
Commercial space would total 2.5 million square feet in 30 buildings.</TE>
<TE>   The Oxnard Planning Commission is set to consider the project June
20.</TE>
<TE>   As for work being done this week on the Ventura Freeway, all but
one lane in each direction from Vineyard to Oxnard Boulevard will be
closed from 11 p.m. tonight, Wednesday and Thursday to 6 a.m. the
following day as crews re-stripe the lanes and install safety
barriers to protect construction workers, said Caltrans spokesman
James Deno.</TE>
<TE>   A groundbreaking ceremony will be held with Gov. Gray Davis in the
next few weeks.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Council OKs Budget, Avoids Cutting Services</HD>
<DH>Finances: Reserve fund is boosted, but few other changes
are made to mayor's $4.8-billion plan. Final approval is expected
Friday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles City Council on Monday tentatively approved a
$4.8-billion budget that maintains existing levels of public service.</LD>
<LD>   The council signed off on most of Mayor James K. Hahn's 2002-03
spending plan. But it increased the reserve fund from $64 million to
$102 million and rejected his proposal to eliminate nearly three
dozen police positions in special departments, such as the
ombudsman's office.</LD>
<LD>   "It preserves last year's funding levels for city services at a
time when we thought, after Sept. 11, things would be extremely
difficult," said Councilman Nick Pacheco, chairman of the council's
Budget and Finance Committee.</LD>
<TE>   The council still must formally adopt the budget at a hearing
Friday. Then the spending plan will be sent back to Hahn for his
signature.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's office was pleased with the council's revised
budget--especially the increased city reserve fund--and doesn't
anticipate making major changes before Hahn signs it, said Deputy
Mayor Matt Middlebrook.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Los Angeles County and the state, the city was able to
avert major spending cuts because of an improving local economy
combined with an increase in revenue from the Department of Water and
Power.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn did make some cuts, such as decreased travel and photocopying
budgets, that tended to affect city workers rather than residents.
The budget also maintained a citywide hiring freeze.</TE>
<TE>   "A budget is a matter of priorities," said Chief Legislative
Analyst Ron Deaton. "At the end of the day, you have to be balanced."</TE>
<TE>   About 260 miles of streets will be resurfaced, 10 miles of dirt
alleys will be paved, 118 miles of sidewalks will be repaired and
123,000 trees will be trimmed.</TE>
<TE>   Spending on police, fire and other basic services is slightly
higher than the current fiscal year. The budget provides the Los
Angeles Police Department with money for DNA evidence analysis
equipment and positions, increased bomb-squad training and more
canine units at Los Angeles International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   The council rebuffed Hahn's proposal to eliminate 34 positions in
special LAPD divisions, such as the ombudsman's office and community
affairs group.</TE>
<TE>   The council approved a motion by Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski
that allows the Police Department to retain these positions but does
not fund them.</TE>
<TE>   Miscikowski said the move--backed by Interim LAPD Chief Martin
Pomeroy--will allow the new police chief to structure the department
as he sees fit, while requiring the department to find the $369,000
to fund the slots in its budget of more than $900 million.</TE>
<TE>   "It puts back those positions right now that Chief Pomeroy
indicated were important," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Nate Holden, the lone dissenter against the motion,
urged the council to fund the positions.</TE>
<TE>   "Public safety should be Number One," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "You vote for the positions, but you give them no money to fill
those positions? ... It's a Mickey Mouse approach ... and I'm not
going to support that."</TE>
<TE>   Council members submitted dozens of amending motions for new
spending in their districts, from landscaping highway medians in the
San Fernando Valley to building a handicapped children's playground
at the Venice Pier. These motions were all referred to committee,
except one "safety net" that was approved. It provides $2 million for
children's summer programs if the state Legislature cuts funding.</TE>

<HD>County Not Liable for Death at Courthouse</HD>
<DH>Ruling: State high court says victims must show defect in
the building, site of a 1995 shooting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA DOLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>State and local governments are not financially liable for unforeseen
shootings and other crimes in public buildings, the California
Supreme Court decided unanimously Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Ruling in a 1995 Los Angeles courthouse murder, the state high
court said government is not responsible for random acts of violence
it could not have anticipated or provoked.</LD>
<LD>   The decision was a loss for the three children of Eileen Zelig,
who was fatally shot in the chest by her former husband, Dr. Harry
Zelig, at the county's civil courthouse in downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   "The risk of injury to Eileen at the hands of her ex-husband was
at least as great outside the courthouse," Chief Justice Ronald M.
George wrote for the court. "He could just as readily have shot
Eileen as she picked up one of her children from a public or private
school."</TE>
<TE>   The children, including a 6-year-old girl who witnessed the
slaying, sued Los Angeles County on the grounds that it failed to
provide reasonable security inside the courthouse. Women's legal
groups and advocates for victims of domestic violence sided with the
children.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the shooting, the civil courthouse had not
installed metal detectors because the county said it could not afford
to pay for guards to operate them. A county spokeswoman said Monday
that all courthouses in Los Angeles County now have metal detectors.</TE>
<TE>   The case, Zelig vs. County of Los Angeles, S081791, will now be
dismissed because the children of the victim failed to show there was
any defect in the courthouse that contributed to the murder, the
ruling said.</TE>
<TE>   Governments can be liable for third-party crimes only if it is
shown that their property was maintained in a dangerous condition,
the court said.</TE>
<TE>   It suggested that a victim mugged in an airport parking lot could
sue a government airport authority if the garage had inadequate
lighting or had been the site of repeated criminal violence. "In the
present case, plaintiffs are unable to point to any defective aspect
of the purely physical condition of the property," George wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Steven J. Renick, a private attorney who represented the county in
the case, said there had been two shootings at the courthouse in the
20 years before Zelig's murder--one involving a security guard and
the other involving two litigants.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have a history of violent criminal activity, just like any
private landlords, the municipality or the state would have to
respond to it," Renick said.</TE>
<TE>   Eileen and Harry Zelig were in the courthouse on Sept. 1, 1995,
for a hearing on spousal and child support. The couple had separated
in October 1993, and Harry Zelig had failed to comply with court
orders on financial support.</TE>
<TE>   Victim Had Feared Her Ex-Husband</TE>
<TE>   On at least three occasions before her murder, Eileen Zelig had
informed the bailiff in one department of the family court that she
feared her former husband and believed he might attack her in the
courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   The victim had given the bailiff and a judge in the family court
copies of letters and telephone messages in which Harry Zelig
threatened to kill her. She also had obtained restraining orders
against him.</TE>
<TE>   On the day of the shooting, the couple met in a family law hearing
room at the court and were directed to go downstairs to a different
room.</TE>
<TE>   As she reached the second floor of the building, Harry Zelig
pulled out a loaded .38-caliber revolver from his clothing and shot
his ex-wife in the chest at point-blank range. Their daughter, Lisa,
then 6, watched the shooting. Eileen Zelig, 40, died soon thereafter.</TE>
<TE>   Harry Zelig, a Woodland Hills physician, was later sentenced to 29
years to life for the murder. The children are being reared by
grandparents.</TE>
<TE>   Edward M. Medvene, who represented the children in the lawsuit,
said Monday's decision "compounds the tragedy of their mother's
death."</TE>
<TE>   "It seems a rush to judgment to preclude somebody from being able
to present their best case on why, if they go into a courthouse, they
shouldn't be protected," Medvene said.</TE>
<TE>   A Los Angeles County Superior Court judge had thrown out the suit,
but a state Court of Appeal later reinstated it.</TE>
<TE>   "She had to go to the courthouse to get [child and spousal]
support," Medvene said. "She had no choice but to use that
courthouse."</TE>
<TE>   Renick said the Supreme Court decision reinstates what the law had
been before the Court of Appeal's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   To prevail in the kind of lawsuit filed by the Zelig children,
"there has to be an actual defect in the property," Renick said. "A
defect is not simply that someone else committed a crime."</TE>
<TE>   He said the appeals court probably sided with the children in part
because of the nature of the crime.</TE>
<TE>   "This was just a horrible, terrible incident," the lawyer for the
county said. "It was one of those things that just make you cringe."</TE>

<HD>Eaglets Returned to Channel Islands</HD>
<DH>Nature: Biologists hope the birds, which will be kept in
nesting boxes for a month, will make the park their home.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Fifty years after pollution drove them off, bald eagles were returned
to Channel Islands National Park on Monday, marking the first step in
a five-year effort to restore the powerful predators to the
sanctuary.</LD>
<LD>   The four eaglets, with their 9-foot wingspans and enormous yellow
talons, shivered as they were carried up a ladder in driving rain and
placed in locked nesting boxes on Santa Cruz Island. They flapped and
squawked before gazing out at the dramatic seascapes, jagged
mountains and hidden coves that biologists hope will be their new
home.</LD>
<LD>   A month from now, when the birds can fly, the boxes will be opened
and they will be released.</LD>
<TE>   "Returning bald eagles to the Channel Islands is the ecological
equivalent to restoring wolves to Yellowstone Park," said park Supt.
Tim Setnicka. "It's that significant."</TE>
<TE>   Scientists and park officials hope the bald eagles, which left the
islands after DDT poisoning thinned their eggshells, will again
dominate the sky, driving off the golden eagles that eat the island
foxes. The foxes have been penned for their safety and won't be
released until the golden eagles are gone.</TE>
<TE>   The project's funding comes from a $140-million settlement reached
in 2000 between the government and the Montrose Chemical Corp. and
other companies. The businesses were accused of dumping millions of
pounds of toxic DDT and PCBs into the ocean near Los Angeles from
1947 until 1972. The chemicals poisoned fish, mammals and birds such
as the bald eagle. Wildlife agencies, which say 110 tons of the
poisons remain in the ocean, are using $30 million of the settlement
to restore what was lost.</TE>
<TE>   The 8-week-old eaglets, which came from the San Francisco Zoo,
will be monitored with cameras in their nest boxes and with satellite
transmitters attached to their bodies.</TE>
<TE>   They will be fed pig carcasses for a month after their release to
keep them healthy until they can hunt their own food.</TE>
<TE>   "When they are released there will be some mistakes made," said
David Garcelon, president of the Institute for Wildlife Studies in
Arcata, which monitors and helps manage the eagles. "Landing is a
tough thing to learn how to do. And it takes about a year before they
can take fish from the water surface."</TE>
<TE>   The eaglets' perch on an 800-foot hill overlooking Chinese Harbor
will get the updrafts needed when they decide to fly.</TE>
<TE>   "They will grow from something young and gawky, and in four weeks
they will be dominating the skies," Garcelon said.</TE>
<TE>   That's what park officials are banking on.</TE>
<TE>   When the bald eagle disappeared half a century ago, the vacuum was
filled by the golden eagle, a voracious hunter that arrived in the
late 1980s. The eagles, which are not native to the islands, fed on
the thousands of feral pigs and a handful of island foxes. Plans are
now underway to fence in the pigs and shoot them next year. The park
hopes eliminating the food source and restoring bald eagles--which do
not feed on foxes--will rid the islands of the golden eagles.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a system out of balance because of nonnative species,"
Setnicka said. "This restoration ecology is like medicine was at the
turn of the century, and we are still groping in the dark."</TE>
<TE>   No one knows if the new bald eagles will hunt, breed or even stay
on the islands. There is also no guarantee that any of their eggs
will hatch.</TE>
<TE>   In 1980, bald eagles were restored to Santa Catalina Island but
the effects of the DDT have lingered, with only 30% of the eggs laid
actually hatching into chicks. Catalina now has 20 bald eagles and
four breeding pairs, biologists said.</TE>
<TE>   "When an eagle lays an egg on Catalina we swipe them and switch
them with a phony egg," said Peter Sharpe, a wildlife ecologist who
helped bring the birds back to Catalina. "We take the egg to the San
Francisco Zoo."</TE>
<TE>   When an egg hatches, the chick is put in the nest in the hope that
the parents will take care of it. So far, the practice has been
largely successful, with the exception of one mother who pecked her
chick to death.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the bald eagles on Catalina have stayed but they often
wander far and wide. Radio transmitters have recorded them in Oregon
and British Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Cruz eagles will be joined by eight others from Alaska
later this year. Setnicka said he would like to have about 50 within
five years.</TE>
<TE>   Biologist Jessica Dooley will monitor the eaglets on the
65,000-acre Santa Cruz Island, the largest in the Channel Islands
chain.</TE>
<TE>   "Once they begin to fly, it's a critical time," she said. "They
will need to find food."</TE>
<TE>   Dooley carried the eagles up a slippery 15-foot ladder to their
boxes. She put two birds in each of the large nests made of logs and
straw. The raptors glared and occasionally hissed at the humans
surrounding them.</TE>
<TE>   The wind blew cold rain through the metal bars of the box. The
eaglets shielded themselves with their big black wings. Because they
are young, their heads don't have the signature white feathers that
characterize adult bald eagles.</TE>
<TE>   Garcelon looked up at the blocky tower with its boxes and sweeping
vistas of mountain ridges and deep blue ocean.</TE>
<TE>   "There is probably nothing more rewarding than returning a species
to its habitat," he said, "And returning eagles to their former
grandeur."</TE>

<HD>Supervisors OK El Toro Severance Pay</HD>
<DH>Government: Simon will receive seven months' salary--about
$106,000 --since his job was eliminated. The county hired him in
January 2001 to plan an airport.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The end of Orange County's eight-year effort to build an airport at
El Toro became official Monday when supervisors approved a severance
package for program manager Gary Simon, who will leave his post June
6.</LD>
<LD>   The Board of Supervisors eliminated the El Toro office and Simon's
position last month and put the program under County Executive
Officer Michael Schumacher. The board decided against letting Simon
continue planning for an airport after a county measure approved by
voters in March changed the zoning to that of a park and other
development. Irvine wants to annex the former Marine base and control
its redevelopment.</LD>
<LD>   Under a plan approved unanimously Monday by the board, with
Supervisor Jim Silva absent, Simon will leave the $182,000-a-year job
he has held since January 2001 with the same severance package as if
he had been fired. Simon will receive seven months' pay, about
$106,000. Supervisors agreed that they had voided Simon's contract by
eliminating his job.</LD>
<TE>   The board discussed Simon's departure last week but delayed a
final vote after Supervisor Todd Spitzer protested a portion of a
resolution that praised Simon's job performance. The language
ultimately approved states simply that Simon will leave the county.</TE>
<TE>   "Gary's departure signifies the final chapter to the El Toro story
from the county's perspective," Spitzer said Monday. "There is now no
pro-airport figurehead to be identified with this losing battle."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Chuck Smith, who supported an airport, said that Simon,
a builder of other large projects, was hired to build an airport, a
job voters eliminated. "There's no point in him sticking around,"
Smith said. "It doesn't reflect on him at all. I think Gary's done an
outstanding job. We part very good friends. It's unfortunate he had
to spend more time with the politics."</TE>
<TE>   In a farewell statement, Simon said he was leaving to pursue other
job opportunities but didn't elaborate. During an interview, he said
he had received "interesting phone calls from Sacramento and
Washington" to continue working in the public sector but had made no
decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "The entire El Toro team of staff, counsel, consultants and
contractors performed exemplary work in a highly professional manner
under circumstances that everyone agrees were highly charged and
challenging," Simon's statement said. "Working under extremely high
levels of scrutiny and pressure, the El Toro team never lost its
composure and always treated everyone with the utmost respect. I wish
the future stewards of El Toro the best of luck."</TE>
<TE>   He ended with a warning that the area's future demands for
additional airport capacity need "to be solved in one way or
another.... The battle over El Toro is behind us, and it is indeed
time for healing, but the challenge of meeting the growing aviation
demand in Southern California remains."</TE>
<TE>   Simon oversaw an agency of 29 employees, most of whom found jobs
elsewhere in Orange County government. Last year, the office's budget
was $11.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   This was Simon's second stint with the county. He had headed El
Toro's real-estate team a year earlier, but left to work for an
engineering firm hired for an expansion of Los Angeles International
Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Simon returned to head an El Toro office that for the first time
reported directly to supervisors. The office was moved in May 2000
from the control of then-County Executive Officer Jan Mittermeier,
who left the county after arguing that the change breached her
contract.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer repeatedly had sparred with Simon over El Toro. In
December 2001, Spitzer protested after thousands of county-funded
postcards touting the airport were authorized by Simon and Deputy
County Counsel Don Rubin after a judge tentatively ruled that public
money couldn't be used to advocate the airport. County attorneys said
the ruling didn't prohibit the mailers. Simon had told Spitzer in a
meeting that same day that no more mailers were contemplated.</TE>
<TE>   The judge later clarified the ruling and specifically barred the
county's El Toro mailings. By then, many of the postcards already had
been delivered to the post office.</TE>

<HD>Spiritual Trip Is Off for Gay Man</HD>
<DH>Dispute: He says the sponsoring ministry barred him because
he belongs to Pepperdine straight-homosexual group, and that the
school backs decision.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joining groups that promote understanding has always appealed to
Pepperdine University student Justin Emerick.</LD>
<LD>   He never imagined that one group would punish him for being a
member of another.</LD>
<LD>   This spring, Emerick said, he was barred from participating in a
summer mission to Japan organized by a Christian group after group
officials learned of his membership in the church-affiliated campus'
fledgling Gay Lesbian Straight Alliance.</LD>
<TE>   The 20-year-old was appointed secretary of the alliance in
January, the same month he was accepted into Let's Start Talking, a
ministry that sends college students overseas on missions to teach
English and spread Christianity. In April, he was asked to leave the
ministry.</TE>
<TE>   "I joined the [alliance] because I think people struggling with
homosexuality should have a place to deal with it, so I feel like
it's a disservice not to talk about this," said Emerick, a junior
majoring in international affairs.</TE>
<TE>   "To censor a discussion on gays and lesbians--or anything that
doesn't mesh with traditional Christian values--denies their
existence and denies people's struggles," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Student Feels That School Let Him Down</TE>
<TE>   Emerick said his school has let him down. Although Pepperdine has
no official affiliation with Let's Start Talking, it has many
informal ties. For example, the West Coast coordinator of the
Christian group is married to a campus minister and lives on
university grounds. Also, the group operates under the auspices of a
Church of Christ congregation in Texas, and the Church of Christ in
Malibu has a strong presence on campus.</TE>
<TE>   The president of the university and a majority of the Board of
Regents are required under university bylaws to be members of the
conservative Churches of Christ.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to underscore that students should feel welcome and that
they can belong here," said Jerry Derloshon, director of public
information for Pepperdine. "We really do encourage freedom to
discuss different ideas. But we reserve the right to be sensitive to
who we are in our tradition and heritage."</TE>
<TE>   No other university official, including Provost Darryl Tippens,
would comment for this story. Mark Woodward, Let's Start Talking's
co-director, did not return repeated calls for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Emerick said he was determined to do right by both groups. During
the same months he helped the student group organize talks on
homosexuality by a campus minister and a pastor who marries gay
couples, he also raised $2,000 from friends and family for the trip.</TE>
<TE>   But in mid-April, Emerick said, after the ministry's West Coast
coordinator, Kim Lambert, learned of Emerick's involvement with the
alliance, she summoned him to her Pepperdine home and told him he
would not be going on the six-week trip to Osaka.</TE>
<TE>   Lambert said being in the gay alliance conflicted with the
ministry's message, Emerick recalled.</TE>
<TE>   "Being involved in GLSA has this other implication for them that I
run around advocating some immoral lifestyle," Emerick said. "It's so
demeaning and degrading to bring sexuality into a place where it
shouldn't even be a factor. I see the conflict, but I don't agree
that it should exist or that it's right."</TE>
<TE>   Lambert, who is leading a mission in the Netherlands, did not
reply to e-mails.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, Emerick met with David Baird, dean of Pepperdine's
liberal arts college and a church elder, and Tippens to discuss the
situation.</TE>
<TE>   He said they told him that they agreed with the Christian group's
decision, although they did not like the way the issue had been
handled.</TE>
<TE>   Emerick, who has known he was gay since high school, said he chose
to attend Pepperdine because of its scenic location, small class size
and spiritual atmosphere, despite its reputation as a strict school.
Dancing on campus wasn't allowed until 1988, and drinking is still
forbidden.</TE>
<TE>   "Being gay and being Christian are both parts of my identity,"
said Emerick, who lives with his parents in the northern San Diego
County city of Vista during school breaks. "It never crossed my mind
that being at Pepperdine would make me feel guilty for who I am."</TE>
<TE>   At least one Pepperdine professor said the Christian program is
within its rights.</TE>
<TE>   "Given that I think homosexual conduct is inconsistent with a
Christian mission, I don't have a problem with the local church
saying that isn't what they want to support in a missionary," said
Marilyn Misch, an accounting professor.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine student Shalen Bishop agreed that the ministry's
position was fair. "The Let's Start Talking program is about
spreading the Christian values and views throughout the world,"
Bishop said. "Although I don't necessarily feel his lifestyle is bad,
it doesn't fit with Christian morals."</TE>
<TE>   Many Pepperdine students learned of the controversy when Gay
Lesbian Straight Alliance Co-Chairman Jim Albarano, who just
completed his junior year, sent an e-mail to 200 supporters telling
them to protest the decision to church elders and Pepperdine
officials.</TE>
<TE>   "They picked the wrong person to persecute with Justin," he said.
"He's the sweetest kid. Nobody could think this situation was
anything but blatant discrimination."</TE>
<TE>   Albarano said Pepperdine officials misunderstand the alliance's
purpose. "Everyone who comes to these meetings is not necessarily
embracing the [gay] lifestyle," Albarano said. "We're just embracing
conversation on the topic."</TE>
<TE>   The 20-member alliance has not been recognized by
Pepperdine--which translates into university funding--because
officials believe it conflicts with the school's mission, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Many Colleges Recognize Gay Groups</TE>
<TE>   Gay student groups, such as those at Yeshiva, Southern Methodist
and Georgetown universities, are recognized at dozens of other
religious colleges around the country.</TE>
<TE>   Still, gay students at other schools run into opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Loyola Marymount's Gay and Lesbian Awareness group is listed on
the university Web site along with other social groups. But it
remains unrecognized--unfunded by the university--after losing a 1990
lawsuit requesting that status, said Frankie Parra Camacho,
co-chairman of the group.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very stressful because we're constantly fighting to stay
alive," Parra Camacho said. "But every time we think it's bad here,
we look at Pepperdine and are grateful that at least we have as much
as we do."</TE>
<TE>   Visiting other colleges, both religiously affiliated and not, has
shown Emerick a whole other world, he said. At USC, for example, one
dormitory section has been set aside as a special-interest "Rainbow
Floor" for gay students and their supporters.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost unreal to think that Pepperdine can be so
closed-minded when there's such a diverse world on other Los Angeles
campuses," Emerick said. "And while I don't regret going to
Pepperdine, things like this really make me not want to be there
sometimes."</TE>

<HD>Publicize Newborn Law, Report Urges</HD>
<DH>Safety: Too few young mothers know they can legally give up
their babies within 72 hours of birth, grand jury says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Babies may be dying because their young mothers don't know about a
state law allowing them to legally give up newborns within 72 hours
of birth, according to an Orange County Grand Jury report issued
Monday. "Lack of awareness ... by the mother could be a contributing
factor in child abandonment and homicide," the seven-page report
says.</LD>
<LD>   Although the report does not say how many babies have died under
those circumstances, it calls for such statistics to be compiled and
for a public-awareness campaign about the new law.</LD>
<LD>   "One avenue could be through public-service radio advertisements
on stations listened to by adolescents," the report suggests. "Other
possibilities could include signs on buses and bus kiosks and other
places frequented by teens."</LD>
<TE>   The Safe Arms for Newborns Law, which took effect Jan. 1, 2001,
allows the parent or guardian of a child up to 72 hours old to
surrender the newborn anonymously to a public or private hospital
emergency room without fear of prosecution. "We were very concerned
that the information wasn't getting out," said Peter Carter, chairman
of the grand jury's human services committee, which issued the
report.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, Orangewood Children's Home has been designated a
receiving facility for unwanted infants. Although the staffs at
Orangewood and hospital emergency rooms seem well-versed on the law,
mothers of unwanted newborns do not seem to be, according to the
report.</TE>
<TE>   That was underscored by interviews with county officials, who said
they recalled at least eight cases of infant abandonment, the report
said, including one in which a baby was left on a roof and another in
which an infant was left in an office filing cabinet.</TE>
<TE>   "These deaths were particularly disturbing," the report says.</TE>
<TE>   Among the report's recommendations: that brochures, including an
existing one, "Don't Throw Your Baby Away," be placed in drugstores,
school offices and other appropriate places; that the materials
indicate the willingness of hospitals to accept or redirect newborns
to other sites, or act as a referral service for women who want to
give up older babies; and that a planned media-awareness campaign
canceled by the Orange County Social Services Agency be resurrected.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope the information will be disseminated to mothers who would
put their babies in harm's way," Carter said. "We want them to know
that there are agencies willing to accept their babies."</TE>

<HD>LAFCO Feels Heat From All Sides</HD>
<DH>Secession: As the commission prepares to rule on Valley
plan, its analyses are questioned.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The once-obscure agency set to decide Wednesday whether to call a
citywide election on San Fernando Valley secession has come under
fire from all sides over the methods it used to craft a breakup plan.</LD>
<LD>   The Local Agency Formation Commission, a state-empowered panel
that typically handles minor boundary shifts, has never before tried
to divvy up a major city. And in drafting a plan that could go before
voters in November, the commission has repeatedly changed directions
and left key questions unanswered.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the unknowns have to do with the longer-term financial
health of a Valley city and the shrunken Los Angeles it would leave
behind.</LD>
<TE>   The report before LAFCO this week envisions the Valley as a
contract city that would depend on Los Angeles for all municipal
services, at least for the first year. That approach, which defenders
say was the only realistic way to address the complexity of the
proposed breakup, shaped LAFCO's conclusions in each of its secession
analyses, leaving dissatisfied observers on all sides.</TE>
<TE>   But experts say it is not up to LAFCO to eliminate every
uncertainty that arises in the dismembering of a city of 3.7 million
people. They also say the political battle over secession makes it
inevitable that LAFCO's work, no matter how thorough, will be subject
to heated second-guessing.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to live in a glass house," said Jaime Regalado,
executive director of the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs at
Cal State Los Angeles. "Everything's fair game. It's always going to
be messy, especially when the stakes are this high.... There's no
cookbook for how to divide up the city."</TE>
<TE>   Barring a successful court challenge, LAFCO has the last word on
whether, and in what form, secession proposals for the Valley,
Hollywood and the harbor area reach the ballot. Its decisions on the
Hollywood and harbor measures are due in the next two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The agency has spent more than two years and $2 million analyzing
breakup plans. It has sampled a variety of recipes. First, it
designed a wholesale split between the Valley and the rest of the
city, only to abandon that approach for a simpler model. It has
changed payment estimates over and over again, but the city still
contends the calculations are off by tens of millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Lawsuit Threats and Anger in Harbor Area</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn has hinted that the city might sue
over the Valley breakup plan, and even some
secessionists--particularly those from the harbor area, which LAFCO
has thus far judged incapable of supporting itself as a separate
city--are questioning how the agency reached its conclusions.</TE>
<TE>   In the harbor area, LAFCO has used so many different projections
that the area's apparent budget deficit shriveled from $51 million a
year to $6 million, and it could shrink even further if LAFCO
relieves the harbor's debt payments.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say that the zigzagging path can be traced to LAFCO's
roots. The state Legislature created Local Agency Formation
Commissions in 1963 to manage growth in each county. The commissions
are filled with a hodgepodge of political appointees, from county
supervisors and city council members to water district directors.</TE>
<TE>   State law offers basic guidelines--for example, secession plans
must preserve the fiscal health of both the existing city and any new
towns carved from it--but LAFCOs can set additional rules as they go
along.</TE>
<TE>   "They're supposed to be looking at it in a neutral way," said
William Fulton, an urban planner who has written books about Southern
California sprawl. "But this is a commission made up of local
politicians, so it's going to be political. And the Los Angeles
County LAFCO has a history of being especially political."</TE>
<TE>   The commissioners leave the number crunching to hired hands. To
judge whether each proposed city's revenue would cover its expenses,
LAFCO turned to Public Financial Management Inc., a consulting firm
with experience studying secession plans in New York state.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest challenge was the Valley, whose 1.35-million
population is almost 10 times larger than that of the proposed harbor
city and seven times that of Hollywood. Midway through their
analysis, the consultants scrapped their original plan to divide the
city's assets. Gone were the neat calculations that gave two of the
Fire Department's six helicopters and 8,564 of 34,607 municipal
employees to the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, LAFCO decided it made more sense to design an independent
Valley as a contract city.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley would hire Los Angeles, the very city it's trying to
escape, to provide all municipal services for at least one year. To
compensate Los Angeles for lost tax revenue, the Valley would have to
fork over an annual "alimony" payment.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the avalanche of data from both camps. That led to
wildly different price tags for the secession plans, depending on who
did the math.</TE>
<TE>   At the moment, LAFCO says the Valley's alimony payment should be
$55.8 million. But that calculation has been adjusted more than 10
times, and the amount is expected to jump again today.</TE>
<TE>   "This is like 'The Wizard of Oz,'" complained Deputy Mayor Matt
Middlebrook. "Now is the time we've got to go behind the curtain and
look at the real numbers. If this has been based on phony math,
[Valley taxpayers] will find themselves drowning in red ink very
quickly ... and the remaining city is going to have a huge hole in
its budget."</TE>
<TE>   The city came up with a much higher alimony figure: $306 million
per year. Then, its consultant rejiggered the balance sheet and
reduced the number to $153.8 million--but only for the eight city
agencies it had time to analyze.</TE>
<TE>   Even minor calculations had major consequences. LAFCO and the city
disagreed on whether fractions should be rounded up or down. For the
Valley, the difference was the equivalent of 147 jobs--more than the
staffs of the Department of Emergency Preparedness, Environmental
Affairs and the City Council combined.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not exact, but it doesn't need to be," said Shirley Svorny,
an economics professor at Cal State Northridge who favors secession.
"If your benchmark is that you can't break up if you can't find every
penny, then you can never break up."</TE>
<TE>   The city certainly did have trouble finding its pennies. About a
quarter of its revenue couldn't be traced geographically, making it
hard to earmark the proper share for areas seeking to break away.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, LAFCO commissioners chastised the city for either
stonewalling when asked for information or dumping 100-page reports
on the agency at the last minute.</TE>
<TE>   "We're almost entirely dependent on the city of Los Angeles for
data, and they're not a willing party to this," said Craig Hoshijima,
a consultant who helped LAFCO analyze the secession proposals.
"That's made it extremely difficult."</TE>
<TE>   Exact Figures Hard to Come By</TE>
<TE>   To estimate the price of city services, LAFCO used the percentage
of Los Angeles workers serving each area. That left the new cities
looking like bite-sized versions of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Harbor area secessionists argue that LAFCO should instead design a
small-town city from the bottom up. They want to eliminate some
big-city departments. So in the latest go-round, LAFCO did just that.
Executive Officer Larry Calemine found that the proposed city could
shave about $21 million from its budget.</TE>
<TE>   He also switched tracks on the harbor area's contracting plans.
Calemine determined that the region could save money by contracting
with Los Angeles County instead of the city.</TE>
<TE>   But exact figures were hard to come by. For firefighting, LAFCO
applied general county billing rates. For animal control, it used
Santa Clarita as a model. For libraries, it relied on a per-capita
cost estimate.</TE>
<TE>   "We stand by all the calculations," Calemine said.</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO again concluded that a harbor city would outspend its
income. Calemine recommended against putting it on the ballot--but
then came back the following week with more ideas for making the
numbers pencil out.</TE>
<TE>   Several LAFCO commissioners, meanwhile, have voiced their desire
to get the breakaway proposals--each prompted by petitions from 25%
of voters in the affected area--onto the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   At LAFCO's last board meeting, one commissioner likened secession
to the populist glory of the American Revolution. Invoking the Boston
Tea Party, retired Judge James DiGiuseppe declared that the colonists
overcame "great odds" to beat the British.</TE>
<TE>   Like the secessionists battling a reluctant Los Angeles, he
concluded, "The people decided, 'We'll make it work no matter what.'"</TE>

<HD>Jailed Gang Member Arrested in 1999 Slaying</HD>
<DH>Crime: The suspect, already doing time for robbery, is
booked in the shooting death of a Rio Mesa High athlete.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 21-year-old El Rio gang member serving a jail term for attempted
robbery was arrested Monday in connection with the shooting death of
a 17-year-old Rio Mesa High School football player just before
Christmas in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Marcus Daniel Morales was booked on suspicion of murder Monday
morning at Ventura County Jail for the death of Ezequiel Francisco
Miramontez, who was killed as he sat in his Toyota Celica in the El
Rio neighborhood where he lived and worked.</LD>
<LD>   Morales is currently serving a 16-month sentence for robbery and
violating his probation, said Sheriff Bob Brooks during a news
conference in the jail lobby.</LD>
<TE>   Investigators allege that Morales set Miramontez's car on fire
after shooting him in the head and body. Firefighters discovered
Miramontez's bullet-riddled body in the driver's seat on Dec. 23,
1999, when they responded to the car fire in the 2600 block of Cortez
Street.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks declined to reveal a motive for the shooting, which stunned
many in the small community because Miramontez was not affiliated
with any gang and "was a good guy on a career path," said his uncle,
Jay Flores.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks said Morales, a known gang member, and Miramontez, a
promising defensive tackle, knew each other because they both were
raised in the same El Rio neighborhood. He said the shooting baffled
investigators, who spent more than 2,000 hours on the case and
conducted nearly 100 interviews.</TE>
<TE>   The ensuing investigation, played out against a backdrop of
frightened witnesses and few hard leads, frustrated the 20 sheriff's
detectives who spent time on the case, Brooks said.</TE>
<TE>   "They grew up in the same community but there was no provocation,"
Brooks said of the suspect and victim. "In a community with a big
gang presence, investigators had to work around the barriers of
witnesses not wanting to come forward."</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the shooting, detectives said they had developed a
string of leads because the suspect had bragged about the killing to
witnesses. Those leads soon dried up, investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks said enough witnesses eventually came forward with
information linking Morales to the crime and, most important, agreed
to testify against him in court.</TE>
<TE>   "There was sympathy on the part of the witnesses because they
liked Frankie," Brooks said, using the name family and friends used
for Miramontez, though his football teammates called him Zeke.</TE>
<TE>   In the 2 1/2 years since the shooting, relatives of the slain
teenager have become well-acquainted with homicide investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Miramontez, a high school junior at the time of his death, worked
as an apprentice in a family-owned auto body shop when he wasn't on
the football field. Shortly after he was shot, 30 members of the Rio
Mesa High School football team walked from classroom to classroom at
the Central Avenue campus to collect more than $1,000 for the
funeral.</TE>
<TE>   In November 2000, Flores and Det. Tim Lorenzen held a news
conference on the spot where Flores' nephew died. They appealed for
help and offered a $25,000 reward to anyone with clues. The money was
collected from the Sheriff's Department as well as from Flores and
his family.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Flores and Lorenzen were together again to discuss the
arrest, along with Miramontez's mother, Maria, and his aunt, Rosie
Ochoa.</TE>
<TE>   "This could happen anywhere at any time," Flores said. "[Maria
Miramontez] lost her only son. I see her crying all the time."</TE>
<TE>   In her right hand, Maria Miramontez clutched a photo of her son
wearing his football uniform. In her left was a picture of the grave
site he shares with his grandmother Isabel, who died six months after
the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Lorenzen, who worked the case from beginning and came to know the
family well, said he has spoken every week with the boy's mother or
another family member.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big relief because there was a lot of frustration putting
everything together," Lorenzen said. "I hear from the family all the
time. [Maria Miramontez] cries on the phone every week when I talk to
her."</TE>

<HD>Nails Close Park in Mission Viejo</HD>
<DH>Crime: A razor blade is also spotted at the playground.
Students next door are barred.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A razor blade and construction nails were discovered at a Mission
Viejo park early Monday, prompting school officials to close the
playground to elementary students.</LD>
<LD>   There has been a rash of discoveries of sharp objects at South
County parks since late April.</LD>
<LD>   But police detectives don't think the incidents are the work of
the same person.</LD>
<TE>   Rather, the objects found Monday were probably placed by a
copycat, said Jim Amormino, spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's
Department.</TE>
<TE>   He said an unidentified teen noticed a razor blade sticking out of
wood chips in the playground of Napoli Park as he jogged by shortly
after 6 a.m. Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The teen ran home and told his father, who called police.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities searched the playground with metal detectors about
6:35 a.m. and found 13 nails and one razor blade, most placed
underneath pull-up bars.</TE>
<TE>   Police declined to give details about the nails or razors, saying
it would only encourage copycats.</TE>
<TE>   The park is next to Bathgate Elementary School, in the 27000 block
of Napoli Way.</TE>
<TE>   It is used by third- through fifth-grade students, said David
Smollar, spokesman for the Capistrano Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   As with other schools in the district, Bathgate's playground has
been checked daily by maintenance crews.</TE>
<TE>   They use metal detectors and rakes to check the grounds before
classes begin, school officials said.</TE>
<TE>   It was closed Monday as police scoured it for evidence.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing funny about it because when they get caught, it's
going to be very, very serious," Amormino said.</TE>

<HD>Unions, Baca Join to Protest Cutbacks</HD>
<DH>Budget: Labor leaders urge county to delay construction
projects to plug gap. Sheriff plans a show of support at today's
meeting against proposed reductions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARRETT THEROLF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County budget debate intensified Monday as unions and
departments facing deep cuts urged county supervisors to turn their
budget ax on building projects rather than jobs and services.</LD>
<LD>   Union leaders cited a $500,000 project to place new signs on
county courthouses, including one to put Supervisor Mike Antonovich's
name on an Antelope Valley courthouse. They also singled out new park
facilities such as soccer fields and tennis courts.</LD>
<LD>   Barbara J. Maynard, a spokeswoman for a coalition of 12 county
unions, said representatives would argue against the items on the
agenda today and will call for a halt to new building in the county.</LD>
<TE>   "At a time when the county supervisors are considering cutting
vital services ranging from health care to public safety and child
protective services, these projects should be put on hold until the
county is back on a stable financial footing," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you add a new bedroom to your house at a time when your kids
don't have food they can keep in their bellies?"</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors has proposed a $16.2-billion budget that
reduces spending by $355 million. They say a downturn in the economy
is forcing them to make painful cuts in services.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff Lee Baca, who is facing millions of dollars in cuts, is
also expected to appear today with about 3,000 sworn and retired
officers in tow.</TE>
<TE>   Marvin J. Dixon, a Sheriff's Department chief, said his department
has found common ground with the unions.</TE>
<TE>   "You shouldn't be building new buildings. You should be investing
in people, not things," Dixon said.</TE>
<TE>   County officials defended the projects as necessary investments.</TE>
<TE>   "[Building] projects have been deferred for many years. There is a
backlog of deferred maintenance and deferred building projects that
need to be addressed," Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said.</TE>
<TE>   "One can argue about any individual expenditure, but there is a
backlog of capital and maintenance projects that cannot be deferred,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Administrative Officer David E. Janssen said that about
$60million in capital projects have already been deferred in the
proposed budget and that it may not be possible to cut much more.</TE>
<TE>   The county's proposed budget includes $120.2 million for building
and maintenance projects.</TE>
<TE>   Janssen said the legacy of deep cuts in capital improvements
during the recession of the early 1990s has left parks and other
facilities woefully behind on maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department and county officials have already had
some public confrontations about the budget.</TE>
<TE>   Several supervisors have criticized Baca for changing his forecast
of how his department will be affected by the cuts.</TE>
<TE>   His department, which has a $1.4-billion budget, will receive
nearly $50 million less, according to the county's proposed budget.</TE>
<TE>   Baca has said the Sheriff's Department would have to reduce
services in unincorporated areas, shrink or eliminate jails, and end
investigative programs involving hate crimes and identity theft,
among others.</TE>
<TE>   He also said last month that he would have to close four sheriff's
stations under the proposed budget. Those statements have not been
repeated recently, and according to recent papers submitted by Dixon,
Baca will be able to keep all the stations open.</TE>
<TE>   "You're making it up as you go along," Yaroslavsky told Dixon, who
represented Baca, at a meeting last week. "You don't have a clue
what's going on in your own budget."</TE>
<TE>   But Dixon replied that the department "does have a clue," and
later in a interview with reporters said today's protest "is not
something we were looking forward to."</TE>

<HD>Councilwomen to Push for Borough Commission</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>PATRICK MCGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Los Angeles City Council members said Monday they will propose a
November ballot measure to create an elected commission that would
devise a borough system of government as an alternative to secession.</LD>
<LD>   Councilwomen Wendy Greuel and Janice Hahn said they hoped to
introduce a motion today that would detail plans for a 15-member
commission. The full council would have to approve putting such a
referendum on the ballot.</LD>
<LD>   The commission would be required to place a borough plan on the
ballot by November 2004. It would be similar to the charter reform
commission elected five years ago.</LD>
<TE>   On Wednesday, a state panel is set to decide on whether to place
San Fernando Valley secession on the Nov. 5 ballot this year. It is
also considering putting secession proposals for Hollywood and the
harbor area on the same ballot.</TE>
<TE>   A borough system would give local regions of the city more say in
budget and planning decisions, Greuel said. Each borough would have
an elected board and president, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the plan, the City Council would continue to deal with
citywide matters.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Brain, president of the secession group Valley VOTE,
dismissed the borough plan as a "political ploy" designed to confuse
voters about secession.</TE>

<HD>'Slick 50s' Gang Member Pleads Guilty, to Get 5 Years</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A member of Orange County's "Slick 50s" gang pleaded guilty Monday to
attempted murder for beating and stabbing a guest at a 1998 party in
Aliso Viejo.</LD>
<LD>   Joshua Carlsen, 25, agreed to plead guilty after Judge Robert R.
Fitzgerald said he would sentence him to five years in prison. The
sentence is scheduled to be imposed next month.</LD>
<LD>   In 2000, Fitzgerald sentenced Carlsen to 11 years in prison for
the crimes, but a state appeals court last year overturned Carlsen's
convictions, citing mistakes by the judge and a defense attorney.</LD>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Jonathan Fish opposed the judge's plea offer
Monday, saying prosecutors hoped to take the case to trial.</TE>
<TE>   A second defendant in the case, Jesse Grist, is scheduled to
appear June 7 before Fitzgerald. His prior conviction also was
overturned last year.</TE>
<TE>   Grist and Carlsen were among five defendants convicted in an
attack that seriously injured a 17-year-old boy.</TE>
<TE>   The victim was struck with a bottle and stabbed at least three
times with a knife.</TE>
<TE>   The "Slick 50s" were a gang of young men who dressed in vintage
1950s clothing and prowled south Orange County looking for trouble,
prosecutors alleged.</TE>

<HD>Panel to Vote on Limiting LAX Solicitors to Kiosks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM and KAREN ALEXANDER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a blustery May day, Melissa Jones and her colleagues from One
Nation Under God are busy pocketing $1, $2 and even $5 donations from
passengers they approach outside the Southwest Airlines baggage claim
at Los Angeles International Airport.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, Erinne Johnson can't do more than lean over a black
Formica desk in the United Airlines terminal at San Francisco
International Airport as she attempts to wave passengers over to hear
her spiel about St. John Coltrane African Orthodox Church. Few give
money.</LD>
<LD>   Jones, who has relatively free rein at LAX, soon may find herself
in Johnson's position, or at least sharing similar restrictions.</LD>
<TE>   The Airport Commission today will consider a city ordinance that
would restrict solicitors to kiosks in each of LAX's nine terminals.
The law, patterned after a policy in use at Bay Area airports, is the
latest attempt in a 28-year struggle by the city agency that operates
LAX to rein in panhandlers at the world's third-busiest airport.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed law would require charitable organizations to obtain
a monthly permit from the airport designating the days, times and
booth locations in which they could solicit money. Only one
organization would be allowed to use a booth at a given time.</TE>
<TE>   Solicitors would be allowed to approach passengers with printed
material, but could not ask for money unless they were sitting in the
booth, the ordinance says. LAX officials could revoke a group's
permit if it violated detailed rules of conduct set out in the
ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, organizations must obtain an information card from the
city each year if they plan to solicit on city property. Five groups
have information cards that allow them to raise money at
LAX--although city officials suspect some ask for donations without
proper identification. In contrast, 23 groups received permits to
solicit in San Francisco International Airport's booths in May.</TE>
<TE>   It's difficult to discern how much money organizations raise at
LAX--although officials believe it's a lucrative location, based in
part on imprecise financial reports that soliciting groups are
required to file with the city.</TE>
<TE>   From July 1, 2000, to June 30, 2001, groups soliciting at the
airport and on other city property raised anywhere from $9,410 (One
Nation Under God) to $359,184 (International Society for Krishna
Consciousness of California).</TE>
<TE>   Airport officials argue that the proposed law is necessary because
solicitors at LAX contribute to crowding by stopping passengers to
ask for money. Fund-raisers also distract travelers from important
security information, they add.</TE>
<TE>   "Frequent travelers comment to us that they encounter more
aggressive solicitation here than they see at other airports," said
Paul Haney, an airport spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   The airport agency hopes the ordinance, if approved by the
commission and the City Council, will withstand legal challenges that
have stymied numerous efforts by the city to control solicitation at
LAX.</TE>
<TE>   A series of anti-soliciting regulations and laws enacted
since 1974 met challenges by civil liberties lawyers, each of which
the city eventually lost, including one case before the California
Supreme Court and another before the U.S. Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, a federal judge deemed unconstitutional a 1997 city
ordinance that prohibited solicitation inside the airport's
terminals, on its sidewalks or in parking lots. The city has appealed
the decision. In her ruling, U.S. District Judge Consuelo B. Marshall
left the door open for airport officials to restrict the "time, place
and manner" in which solicitors can ask for money, if the
restrictions are narrowly tailored. The airport agency hopes the
proposed law meets this standard.</TE>
<TE>   But advocates for local groups say the proposed law restricts free
speech and would not stand up in court. San Francisco International
Airport's 20-year-old policy has never been legally challenged.</TE>
<TE>   "The ordinance restricts solicitors to where they're not able to
effectively reach people they're trying to contact," said David
Liberman, an attorney for the International Society of the Krishna
Consciousness of California. "Everything I've seen so far points
directly and inexorably toward further litigation."</TE>
<TE>   The Hare Krishnas, together with the Committee for Human Rights in
Iran, sued in federal court and obtained a restraining order against
Los Angeles that barred it from enforcing the 1997 no-soliciting
ordinance. Liberman said his clients would prefer multiple booths in
each terminal in prime locations. The airport agency has not
determined the locations for the booths.</TE>
<TE>   Solicitors working the terminals at LAX recently agreed with
Liberman. "If they put us behind booths, it would slow things down,"
said Joe Douglas, who was working alongside Jones outside Terminal
No. 1 raising money for One Nation Under God. "If I have $100 in $1
bills, it usually means I asked 1,000 people."</TE>
<TE>   Douglas, whose colleagues held clipboards with maps of LAX glued
to the backside, said solicitors "provide a service" by giving
passengers directions. But some travelers were caught off-guard by a
request for donations after solicitors provided assistance. Salt Lake
City resident Cody Patterson gave Jones $1 after she sold him a
stamp.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a missionary, so I've been on that side," he said. "It's a
public place with public access, so asking for money is OK, as long
as it's not deceptive."</TE>
<TE>   At San Francisco International Airport, passengers stop and ask
Johnson for flight information, even though there's a sign in front
of the desk she's sitting behind that declares, "This is not an
airport information booth.... "</TE>
<TE>   Passengers who listened to Johnson's pitch say they appreciated
the distance the booth provides.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not quite as intrusive this way," said Robert Gourbana, who
stopped to hear Johnson out. Gourbana said he would come back after
he checked in for his flight to Chicago. He never returned.</TE>

<HD>SUV Surge Driving Out Small Parking Slots</HD>
<DH>The popularity of bigger vehicles prompts a growing number
of cities to ban 'compact' spaces at new projects in favor of
one-size-fits-all.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Move over. Here come more of those hulking behemoths, roaring down
the road with names as big as all outdoors: Yukon, Tundra and
Sequoia.</LD>
<LD>   Sport utility vehicles are growing in size and popularity, taking
up a bigger share of the automobile market, and a bigger chunk of
America's roadways and parking lots.</LD>
<LD>   Consider the mother of all SUVs: the Ford Excursion. It weighs 3.5
tons, seats nine and is 19 feet long. The rotund roadster can barely
fit into a standard space. Squeezing an Excursion into a "compact"
space would be like ramming a rhinoceros into a phone booth.</LD>
<TE>   To accommodate the bigger vehicles, including all those minivans
and pickup trucks, several local cities have eliminated the compact
parking space requirements that were adopted when driving small,
gas-efficient cars was all the rage.</TE>
<TE>   Compact parking spaces are about a foot and a half narrower and 5
feet shorter than standard spaces. In some cities, developers are
allowed to use compact spaces for up to 40% of all parking stalls.</TE>
<TE>   But in cities such as Santa Clarita, Riverside and Westminster,
small spaces are out; big stalls are in. Developers of new parking
lots and garages there are no longer allowed to build the smaller
spaces.</TE>
<TE>   A proposal to make compact spaces roomier in unincorporated Los
Angeles County awaits a decision by the Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   One Los Angeles city lawmaker said he also is considering changing
the parking requirements to accommodate the bigger vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if they drive SUVs, people are parking in these compact
spaces," said Councilman Hal Bernson. "It's a problem."</TE>
<TE>   It's a problem that is growing with the popularity of SUVs.</TE>
<TE>   Sport utilities represent nearly 25% of all new vehicle sales.
Over the next two years, the number of SUV models is expected to jump
from 67 to 85, say J.D. Power and Associates auto industry analysts.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, the municipalities that mandate larger parking
spaces have not cut back on the overall number of stalls they require
for housing and commercial projects. The new rules simply mean that
developers must build bigger parking lots and garages.</TE>
<TE>   But many developers are content to build the larger lots to serve
the needs of big-car drivers.</TE>
<TE>   "Most companies don't want to build compact spaces anymore," said
William Hurrell, vice president of Wilbur Smith Associates, an
international engineering firm. "You hardly ever see anyone [adding]
compact spaces anymore."</TE>
<TE>   As expected, SUV drivers love that many cities are eliminating
compact parking stalls. They say they are tired of cramming their
beloved vehicles into tight spots only to have adjacent vehicles
leave dings on their shiny door panels.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes too long to find a big space," said UCLA student Jasmine
Malek, explaining why she parked her hefty Ford Explorer in a compact
space at the Westside Pavilion mall. "If I see a space, I take it."</TE>
<TE>   But the trend is not limited to Southern California. Throughout
the state, 35 cities prohibit compact spaces in new developments, a
study of 160 California cities by International Parking Design Inc.,
a Sherman Oaks-based architectural firm, found.</TE>
<TE>   The most common compact spaces are 71/2 or 8 feet wide and about
15 to 17 feet long. But a space like that would be a tight fit for
the Ford Excursion: It could squeeze in with only 6 inches to spare
on either side, and with the back end hanging out by 4 feet.</TE>
<TE>   Parking designers say many cities are replacing compact spaces
with roomier, one-size-fits-all spaces. Glendale, for example, allows
developers to install only a universal-sized stall that is 81/2 feet
wide and 18 feet long.</TE>
<TE>   Who has the roomiest stalls in the state? Bell Gardens, Cerritos,
Lawndale, Rialto and San Marcos ban compact spaces in new projects,
allowing only standard spaces that are 9 feet wide and 20 feet long,
according to the International Parking Design study.</TE>
<TE>   The city of Davis in Northern California can be considered the
most unaccommodating community to the SUV driver. Davis parking
standards allow developers to build nothing but compact spaces,
measuring 71/2 feet wide by 16 feet long.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Webb, a spokesman for the Davis Building and Safety
Department, said the trend of massive SUVs has yet to hit that
college town, so the need for bigger parking spaces has never been
raised.</TE>
<TE>   "In Davis, we probably do see more compact cars than not," he
said. "A lot of vehicles in town are smaller, student cars."</TE>
<TE>   A measure pending a decision by the Los Angeles County Board of
Supervisors would increase the compact space dimensions from 8 feet
wide to 81/2 feet. The measure also would reduce the allowable
percentage of compact spaces from 40% to 25% in new commercial
developments. The measure has been endorsed by the county Regional
Planning Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone likes the idea, however. Environmentalists and
mass-transit advocates say municipalities that widen parking spaces
are only indulging an environmentally destructive trend: a love
affair with gas-guzzling vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Schlageter, conservation coordinator for the Sierra Club in
Los Angeles and Orange counties, said the trend toward bigger parking
spaces is counterproductive because it takes up more valuable land
and supports practices that harm the environment.</TE>
<TE>   Another drawback to the trend of bigger spaces is that the
big-vehicle craze could just as quickly shift back to compact cars
with a spike in gasoline prices or a downturn in the economy.</TE>
<TE>   "The mix of automobiles changes from year to year," said Con Howe,
director of planning for the city of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the future car craze, Leslie Wolff of Los Angeles loves
her beefy Jeep Grand Cherokee.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent morning, she pulled into a West Los Angeles parking
lot to stop at a frozen yogurt shop. All the standard-sized spaces in
the lot were taken. Only a few compact spaces remained. So she
crammed her SUV into a compact stall.</TE>
<TE>   Wolff admitted that motorists have yelled at her for such a move,
but she said she doesn't have time to circle the neighborhood in
search of a roomier stall.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they just have to make the spaces bigger," she said. "If
they were all bigger, everyone would get more space, including the
small cars."</TE>

<DH>Courts: The church paid $8.67 million this month to end
legal battle that started in 1980.</DH>

<LD>Lawrence Wollersheim was awarded millions of dollars, but he plans to
keep living as a nomadin a solar-powered RV, connected to the world
by a cellular phone with a secret number.</LD>
<LD>   The ex-Scientologist came by his money in a unique fashion, too:
He won a grueling 22-year court battle against the Church of
Scientology of California that went to the U.S. Supreme Court.</LD>
<LD>   Wollersheim said the church pushed him to the brink of suicide,
brought on bipolar disorder and drove his business into bankruptcy. A
Los Angeles jury agreed.</LD>
<TE>   On May 9, the church deposited $8.67 million with the Los Angeles
Superior Court, marking the only time in two decades, church
officials say, that Scientology has lost a lawsuit and been forced to
pay a former member, or as church officials call him, an apostate.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Wollersheim said, he won't "have to worry about having a job
ever again."</TE>
<TE>   But the 53-year-old, who has spent his entire adult life in
Scientology or fighting it, said he is unlikely to relax in his
newfound security.</TE>
<TE>   He'd like nothing better, he said. It's just that his quest for
justice may compel him to wage more battles. He is encouraging other
ex-members to file their own suits and plans to stay involved in
Factnet, the anti-Scientology, anti-cult Web site he co-founded.</TE>
<TE>   "Justice is more powerful than therapy," Wollersheim said. "If it
takes another 22 years, I'll stay with it. I'm standing up straight
and tall and looking them in the eye, and they're not pushing me
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Church officials see a very different picture. They paint
Wollersheim as a calculating, deranged ex-member who was mentally
unbalanced when he joined and managed to convince a jury--using bogus
testimony--that Scientology was responsible for what was wrong in his
life.</TE>
<TE>   His victory was "a miscarriage of justice," said Kurt Weiland, an
official with the Church of Scientology International.</TE>
<TE>   Church officials dispute Wollersheim's allegations that they
dragged their heels to avoid paying. They said that he didn't want to
collect and that he had an elaborate scheme to lose so he could
continue collecting donations from anti-Scientologists.</TE>
<TE>   Wollersheim's lawyers dismiss this claim as ridiculous. Attorney
Craig Stein said the church "used every possible litigation technique
to make the pursuit of collection of the judgment so costly that any
less determined person would have given up a long time ago."</TE>
<TE>   Wollersheim's odyssey with the organization began when he was
barely into his 20s. According to court records, it was San Francisco
in 1969. He was a college student from Wisconsin strolling the
colorful streets when a good-looking girl caught his eye.</TE>
<TE>   They got to talking, and before he knew it, Wollersheim was
enrolling in his first Scientology course.</TE>
<TE>   By 1973, he had dropped his plans for a college degree and moved
to Los Angeles, where the church is headquartered.</TE>
<TE>   All the money he had went to pay for Scientology courses, he said.
He signed up for "auditing," a Scientology practice in which an
"auditor" asks a member questions while a device called an
electropyschometer is used, reportedly to help locate areas of mental
distress. Scientologists believe that auditing can help rehabilitate
the human spirit and is the path to spiritual enlightenment.</TE>
<TE>   For 11 years, Wollersheim said, he believed that too. He signed a
billion-year contract, which the church describes as a symbolic
gesture of eternal commitment. At one point, he said, he lived with
other Scientologists and spent all his waking hours working for the
church. He also operated several businesses, including a photography
enterprise.</TE>
<TE>   Then things went bad. In the mid-1970s, according to court
records, Wollersheim agreed to undergo auditing sessions aboard a
ship in Long Beach. It was a strenuous regime of little sleep, paltry
food and hours of auditing that experts testified helped bring on his
mental illness.</TE>
<TE>   At another stage, according to court records, Wollersheim agreed
to disconnect from friends and family who had expressed concerns
about Scientology.</TE>
<TE>   Wollersheim said he went along with those church practices. But he
also said he began to have suicidal thoughts and personality changes.</TE>
<TE>   When he started to question his belief in Scientology, he said,
retribution followed. Wollersheim said Scientologists drove his
business into bankruptcy. Church officials said members stopped
patronizing Wollersheim's business because they discovered he was
disreputable. They also deny pressuring him to disconnect from
friends and family.</TE>
<TE>   Wollersheim said he left the church in 1980 and moved to a tiny
town in northern Wisconsin, where for four months "I was being
nothing, going nowhere, just kind of psychologically gutted."</TE>
<TE>   Then he filed a lawsuit. In 1986, a Los Angeles County jury
awarded him $30 million. An appellate court later cut that amount to
$2.5 million, but upheld the case. Over the years, the judgment grew
to $8.67 million with accrued interest.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the money is owed to lawyers and others who helped
bankroll Wollersheim's battle. He hasn't had a long-term job in the
last decade, he said, because harassment from those angry at his suit
have forced him to stay on the move, at times armed with a gun and a
bulletproof vest. Scientology officials say they never harassed him.</TE>
<TE>   What kept him going was the conviction that he was fighting, not
just for himself, but for others hurt by the church, he said. He
lives in a recreational vehicle with four wheel drive and solar power
so he can go "off the grid" to hide if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   That suits him fine, he said. He loves the solitude of the desert
and mountains, reading books on metaphysics and cooking. .</TE>
<TE>   Wollersheim said he has made no real plans for his money, except
to invest and buy presents for his family. He also wants to spend
more time with his adult son.</TE>
<TE>   Church officials said they are happy to have the matter behind
them and wish no harm to Wollersheim.</TE>
<TE>   He said that despite his long legal battle he has no ill will
toward individual Scientologists.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a zealot," Wollersheim said.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not my enemies. I actually pray for these people.... If I
didn't pray for them, they'd get me so angry I'd lose my balance."</TE>

<TE>   He moved to a tiny town in northern Wisconsin, he said, where for
four months "I was being nothing, going nowhere, just kind of
psychologically gutted. Not knowing how to think; not knowing what to
do. And gradually, I started coming out of it."</TE>

<TE>   He has also discovered a new passion: designing health-related
software. During his long years of legal fighting, he said, he picked
up computer skills, and he now works freelance from the road.</TE>
<TE>   Wollersheim said he has made no real plans for his money, except
to invest and buy presents for his family. He also wants to spend
