<HD>Eminem Holds Off Charge by Papa Roach for No. 1</HD>

<LD>The angry young rock of Papa Roach could not beat out the angry young
rap of Eminem, whose "The Eminem Show" retains the top spot on the
nation's pop albums chart. "The Eminem Show" sold 381,000 copies last
week, bringing its total sales to 3.3 million in four weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Papa Roach's "Lovehatetragedy," which finds the Northern
California rap-rock group veering more toward its heavy guitar sound
than its hip-hop stylings, debuts this week at No. 2 with 136,000
copies sold.</LD>
<LD>   The other debuts in the top 20 represent an eclectic trio of acts
hailing from near neighbors of the U.S.: Haitian-born Wyclef Jean
opens at No. 6 with "Masquerade," followed by Toronto rock band Our
Lady Peace at No. 9 with "Gravity," and "Border Girl" from Mexico
City pop singer Paulina Rubio at No. 11.</LD>
<TE>   The most impressive leap of the week belonged to the "Lilo &amp;
Stitch" soundtrack, which, thanks to the film's debut Friday, bounded
from No. 57 to No. 16 on the chart, which is based on the retail
reports collected by Nielsen SoundScan. The soundtrack is a mix of
Hawaiian sounds and five hits by Elvis Presley, including "Hound Dog"
and "Devil in Disguise."</TE>
<TE>   The king for the moment, though, remains Eminem, although
retailers predict that the Detroit rhymer will lose his grip on No. 1
next week; St. Louis rapper Nelly's highly anticipated "Nellyville"
hit stores on Tuesday and is expected to sell more than 600,000
copies its first week.</TE>

fusion of Cuban son, R&amp;B, rap and jazz, delivers the perfect recipe
for an evening of rhythm and sound. And on Saturday, the hilarious
comedy troupe that whipped up "A Bowl of Beings" and dished out
"Nuyorican Stories" cooks up its own special brand of party--the
Culture Clash Comedy Fiesta. Clashers Richard Montoya, Ric Salinas

sawdust on the ground of the vacant lot to keep everything from being
covered with dust, hence the name. This year's festival, which opens
Friday, will feature more than 175 artists offering ceramics, glass,
watercolor and oil paintings, jewelry, leather, sculpture and more,
plus workshops, demonstrations, live entertainment, three cafes and a
saloon. And more than 50 tons of sawdust.</TE>

<TE>   Filmmaker Majid Majidi's "Baran," which had a one-week
Oscar-qualifying run last December, makes a welcome return beginning
Friday. Majidi, one of Iran's most acclaimed directors for such films
as "The Children of Heaven" and "The Color of Paradise," tells a
romantic tale of a group of Afghan refugees working illegally at a
Tehran construction site, the young Iranian boy who serves as the
site's caretaker and an Afghan girl with whom he falls in love. The
Times' Kevin Thomas wrote that "the darkly glowing 'Baran' brings an
irresistible blend of warmth and humor and a consistent embracing
humanity in the face of life's harshness" and named it as one his top
10 films of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "Baran," rated PG for language and brief violence, opens Friday
exclusively at the Laemmle's Music Hall, 9036 Wilshire Blvd., Beverly
Hills, (310) 274-6869 and Laemmle's Town Center, 17200 Ventura Blvd.,

Slabolepszy's savage apartheid-era drama, "Saturday Night at the

the loss of innocence in a violent world.</TE>

<LD>   Those who take their fiction strong, straight-up and with no
chaser can get their fill at Writers Bloc Presents James Ellroy.
Ellroy, the "demon dog" of contemporary American literature and
author of such noir volumes as "The Cold Six Thousand," "My Dark
Places" and "L.A. Confidential," appears with Bruce Wagner, author of
"I'll Let You Go," "Force Majeur" and "I'm Losing You." Both writers,
who mine Los Angeles' boulevards and back alleys in their work, will
talk crime, mystery and the scatology of the streets.</LD>
<LD>   Writers Bloc, the Writers Guild Theater, 135 S. Doheny Drive,
Beverly Hills, 3 p.m. $15. (310) 335-0917 or
www.writersblocpresents.com.</LD>

<TE>   7pm Pop Music</TE>
<TE>   We may never know whether David Baerwald was the first or second
half of critically acclaimed '80s duo David + David, but we do know
that minus David Ricketts, Baerwald subsequently put out two highly
regarded solo albums, "Bedtime Stories" and "Triage." Having spent
most of the last decade working as a producer, film composer and
collaborating with other musicians, Baerwald recently recorded the
first album of his own since the early '90s. "Here Comes the New Folk
Underground," arrives July 16 on the Nashville-based Lost Highway
label. The longtime L.A. resident moved to Austin earlier this year,
but he's on a brief tour that returns him to his old haunts for shows
Sunday and Monday at the Mint.</TE>
<TE>   David Baerwald, the Mint, 6010 W. Pico Blvd., Los Angeles. With
Abra Moore, Sheila Nicholls. 7 p.m. $14. (323) 954-9630.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   3pm Jazz</TE>
<TE>   Trumpeter Ron McCurdy and spoken-word artist John Wright have
joined forces to create a multimedia production of Langston Hughes'
"Ask Your Mama: 12 Moods for Jazz." Written in 12 parts by Hughes in
the early 1960s, this 800-line suite of poems reflects the atmosphere
of the Harlem Renaissance. This production will feature spoken word
accompanied by a live jazz quartet and life-size slide projections of
Hughes' world.</TE>
<TE>   Langston Hughes' "Ask Your Mama: 12 Moods for Jazz," featuring the
Ron McCurdy Quartet and John Wright, Wilshire Ebell Theatre, 4401 W.
8th St., L.A., 3 p.m. Free. (626) 744-0246.</TE>

<TE>   4&amp;7pm Dance</TE>
<TE>   They may not be Bollywood heartthrobs, but the Rangoli and Arpana
dancers are among the most active local artists bringing Indian dance
to Southland audiences. Their coincidental Sunday performances
provide a chance to sample the beauties of Indian classical dance.
The Rangoli "Enduring Traditions" program capitalizes on variety. In
contrast, the Arpana Foundation celebrates its 20th anniversary with
"Maya Manusha--The Illusive One," a company showcase concentrating on
the human and divine aspects of the Hindu god Krishna. Take your pick
and sample ancient glories newly resplendent.</TE>
<TE>   Rangoli Dance Company, "Enduring Traditions," Madrid Theatre,
21622 Sherman Way, Canoga Park. 4 p.m. $12 to $15. (818) 347-9938.</TE>

<HD>Big Brother Is Selling</HD>
<DH>Some marketing techniques depicted in the futuristic
'Minority Report' seem close at hand, raising anew issues of privacy</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NATHAN BIERMA</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>And you think there's too much advertising now.</LD>
<LD>   In the new movie "Minority Report," set in the year 2054, every
billboard knows your name and holograms bark out personalized
commercials. When star Tom Cruise, for instance, enters a Gap store
(still in business!), computers identify him through an eye scan,
triggering a holographic saleswoman whose job it is to recite his
recent purchases and suggest new ones.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the not-too-distant future. This is imminent," says Peter
Schwartz, chairman of the Global Business Network, a futurist
consulting firm. In April 1999, at Spielberg's request, Schwartz
organized a "think tank" of futurists to map out the world of 2054 at
a three-day convention in Santa Monica.</LD>
<TE>   While "1984"-ish science fiction stirs fright of Big Brother
watching over your shoulder (and in "Minority's" case, inside your
brain), Schwartz says this movie also tries to raise questions of how
technological advances in security may foreshadow commercial
intrusions of privacy.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether it's your [credit] card, buying something on the
Internet, or being scanned on a commuter train platform, information
about us is being exchanged all over the place in lots of ways that
make money for other people," says Leslie Reis, director of the
Center of Information Technology and Privacy Law at The John Marshall
Law School in Chicago. "And there are not many mechanisms out there
right now that give a data subject control over how information about
himself or herself is used."</TE>
<TE>   Technologically, Reis and others say, futuristic advertising may
be much closer than 2054. It's just a matter of putting the pieces
together, and then walking the fine line between trying to reach
customers without annoying them.</TE>
<TE>   "In class I use the [hypothetical] example that I'm walking down
State Street and my cell phone rings. It's Marshall Field's, and
there's a generated message on there that says, 'Hi, Leslie, we're
having a 20% off sale on petite women's clothing right now if you
stop in.'</TE>
<TE>   "What's been done is my phone number is on a database, my buying
preferences are on a database, and that, combined with the ability to
track my presence using the technology that's already in my cell
phone.... It's really just an extension of the customer lists that
are already out there."</TE>
<TE>   In another scene from "Minority Report," which opened last Friday,
Cruise shuffles through a subway corridor and his eyes are scanned by
billboards, which call out his name and make personalized sales
pitches.</TE>
<TE>   Harold Krent, interim dean of the Chicago-Kent College of Law,
says that while Spielberg's movie world may not be imminent, he's
still keeping an eye on keeping retailers in check when it comes to
privacy.</TE>
<TE>   "We should be more concerned about the ability of retailers to
deal in private information, as well as the ability of the
government," Krent says. "So far there has been modest success in
regulating insurance companies, financial institutions and health
care in their use of private information."</TE>
<TE>   But other analysts say the mere development of advertising
technology doesn't necessarily portend Cruise's world of blaring
billboards.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of futurist movies are based on this apocalyptic vision,
and the whole idea is to scare people," says Eric Garland, a futurist
consultant with Agos Dynamics Group in Washington, D.C., who is
working on a book called "Doing Business in a World Without Secrets."</TE>
<TE>   "Most of that is based on the passe idea of judging future
situations with today's values. Most of what constitutes daily life
that we've taken for granted now would absolutely scare someone from
1820 to death," Garland says.</TE>
<TE>   "The technology being there is one thing. Getting everybody to
agree on how to use the tech and to have consumer groups agree to
that kind of invasion may be a different story," Garland says,
pointing out the backlash against telemarketers and credit card
companies sharing personal information. "Most technologies, in the
way they're applied, are always based on our values."</TE>
<TE>   Personalized ads have already arrived, of course, in junk mail and
on the Web.</TE>
<TE>   Thus far, the technique of eye scanning is used mostly for
security.</TE>
<TE>   Systems using iris recognition, in which volunteer frequent fliers
have their eyes scanned for their unique optical imprint, have slowly
begun to replace passport check-in at Amsterdam's Skipbohl Airport
and London's Heathrow, and will soon be introduced for employee
check-in at New York's JFK.</TE>
<TE>   For now, using eye-scanners for advertising remains science
fiction.</TE>
<TE>   Glover Ferguson, who produces prototypes of new advertising
technologies as chief scientist at the Accenture Technology Lab in
Chicago, says the role of technology is to help advertisers reach
customers on a more personal level.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no law saying you can't run out of stores shouting at
people, but it's not done. Whereas in higher-end clothing stores, we
welcome people coming up and making specific suggestions," Ferguson
says.</TE>
<TE>   "In our culture, with our legal system, we will ultimately decide
what's acceptable and what isn't," he says. "If it's unacceptable, we
will treat it in such a way that it crawls to the side of society or
we'll pass a law against it."</TE>
<TE>   Nathan Bierma is a reporter for the Chicago Tribune, a Tribune
company.</TE>

<LD>Propped up in a darkened room and illuminated at an oblique angle,
the flat rectangle of pewter reluctantly reveals the scene it has
faithfully held for 176 years.</LD>
<LD>   "You have to dance around it to get a good view," Dusan Stulik, a
senior scientist at the Getty Conservation Institute, said as he
hovered nearby.</LD>
<LD>   You do, and the plate flashes gold before going dark. A step
forward, one back and somewhere in between an image emerges. A farm
building. Pear and poplar trees. A dovecote.</LD>
<TE>   Together, the objects appear just as they did to Joseph Nicephore
Niepce in 1826, when the Frenchman created what is acknowledged as
the world's first photograph.</TE>
<TE>   "All of the history of photography, the history of film, the
history of television: If you go back, this is where all those
histories unite," Stulik said of the faint image.</TE>
<TE>   Since the photograph arrived on June 14 at the Getty, experts have
begun the first scientific study of the image since it was
rediscovered and authenticated in 1952.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first time we have done any analysis. This is an
opportunity to really see it for the first time since it was done,"
said Roy Flukinger, a senior curator at the Harry Ransom Humanities
Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin, which acquired
the image in 1963.</TE>
<TE>   The analysis is part of a joint photo conservation project with
the Getty, the Image Permanence Institute at the Rochester Institute
of Technology and France's Centre de Recherches sur la Conservation
des Documents Graphiques.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last week, scientists have pored over the 8-inch-by-6
1/2-inch photograph with advanced scientific instruments and assessed
its state of preservation, which is generally good.</TE>
<TE>   Experts will repair its original frame and build a new airtight
case for it. They have also photographed the image, which is
difficult given its faintness.</TE>
<TE>   Previous reproductions were little more than retouched mosaics of
various images made in the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   Study results are preliminary but confirm accounts that Niepce
used a polished plate of pewter, just one-sixteenth-of-an-inch thick,
coated with a thin layer of bitumen to create the image.</TE>
<TE>   During an exposure made over as many as three days, the
light-sensitive petroleum derivative hardened. Washing the plate with
a mixture of oil of lavender and white petroleum dissolved the
unexposed portions of bitumen.</TE>
<TE>   Niepce called the permanently fixed, direct positive picture--the
first ever captured from nature--a "heliograph."</TE>
<TE>   The original image returns to Austin on Monday.</TE>

<HD>Soju Goes Where Vodka Cannot Tread</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS RUBIN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You can get a mojito, a cosmo and even assorted martinis at Vine, a
new fondue restaurant and nightspot in Hollywood. That wouldn't be
unusual at most bars in town, but Vine has only a beer and wine
permit.</LD>
<LD>   It's not breaking any laws, so what's in the cocktails? Soju, a
Korean variation on vodka traditionally made from rice but more
commonly from sweet potatoes these days. With 24% alcohol, soju is
stronger than beer (4% to 5%) or wine (about 13%) but packs a weaker
punch than virtually all vodkas, which are 40% alcohol.</LD>
<LD>   A part of traditional Korean cuisine, soju is often enjoyed with
meals, but because many Korean mom and pop restaurants had only beer
and wine licenses, they were unable to sell it. (A new "general" or
distilled spirits license costs $12,000 or more, according to Dave
Gill, a district administrator for the state Department of Alcoholic
Beverage Control, and a beer and wine license runs only $548 and
often faces far less opposition from neighbors.)</LD>
<TE>   After some lobbying by the Korean Restaurant Owners Assn., a bill
by Sen. Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) passed in 1998, allowing the
sale of soju by establishments previously licensed to sell only beer
and wine in California. "Soju is served as a traditional drink
accompanying spicy Korean meals and used to enhance the meal's
flavor," reads the analysis of the bill.</TE>
<TE>   At first, few bar owners outside the Asian community were aware of
the bill, so sales of soju were limited to Korean and a few Japanese
places. (The Japanese version, shochu, is almost identical and also
can now be poured legally by establishments with beer and wine
licenses.) But sales of soju shot up immediately, says Alex Kim,
marketing manager for Jinro America Inc., the largest manufacturer of
soju. "We saw a 35% to 40% increase in the first year since the law
passed."</TE>
<TE>   And he thinks that's only the beginning, once the traditional
Korean beverage finds new drinkers. "Soju is enormous outside of the
United States: Jinro sold 55 million cases around the world in 2001.
We haven't aggressively marketed it to the mainstream, but we have a
plan to do that in 2003," Kim says. The company will start where so
many national trends are born: in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   David Reiss, proprietor of Sugar in Santa Monica, believes his was
the first non-Asian establishment in Los Angeles to take advantage of
the law. He inherited a beer and wine license when he took over the
club about four years ago but was unable to upgrade to a full liquor
license. He assumed that meant serving only beer, wine, champagne and
sake.</TE>
<TE>   "We got our sake from Mutual Trading, and a guy at the warehouse
asked why I didn't also buy soju, since he knew I had a beer and wine
license," Reiss recalls. "Once I found out about soju, it made our
business completely different."</TE>
<TE>   Sugar offers a menu of cocktails made with Kyungwoul "Green" soju,
produced by Doosan Kyungwoul Co. in Seoul, which Reiss describes as
"pretty neutral in flavor." Few order shots of the stuff, but soju
mixed in Red Bull is popular, as are standards from lemon drops to
cosmos, he says--pretty much everything where you'd use vodka."</TE>
<TE>   He said he's sure other bars and clubs will catch on fast. In
fact, he's the one who told Vine's owner, Simon Jones, about soju.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'You're going to make a lot of money with this!' " Jones
spent a few days experimenting with the stuff and doing research. "We
went to some Korean restaurants," he says, "and saw that they served
it straight up, or shaken with lemon or orange-flavored extract."</TE>
<TE>   Servers at Vine don't go out of their way to explain soju. "If
people ask for vodka-and-tonic or gin-and-tonic, [soju is] what we
serve. We tell them if they don't like it, they don't have to drink
it," Jones explains.</TE>
<TE>   Vine's bartenders mix up a variety of soju-based cocktails, many
of which are copies of vodka- and other spirits-based classics, as
well as a few originals. As soju contains only about half the alcohol
in vodka, it makes cocktails that feel and taste different.</TE>
<TE>   Soju straight up is easy to drink, mild and fairly neutral but a
bit watery. Unlike vodka, soju doesn't turn syrupy when left in the
freezer. Few serious drinkers would confuse a shot of the stuff with
an equal dose of super-premium vodkas like Pearl. "It tastes like a
'well' vodka," says Reiss. "Like Smirnoff."</TE>
<TE>   It's in the custom cocktails at Vine that soju shines. Windex may
have a less-than-appealing name, but the electric blue libation,
concocted from soju, blue curacao, orange juice and ginger, has a
pleasant thickness and sweetness. And the sour apple martini smells
like fresh sliced apples and has a pleasant puckery quality.</TE>
<TE>   Set decorator Ann Shea was eager to try the new drinks when she
noticed Vine's list. "The lemon ginger cocktail tasted really good,
like a martini, but not as harsh or strong," she says."I don't
usually drink hard liquor," she adds. "Too much of a buzz too
quickly. But I don't feel that way with soju. I can have three drinks
and feel OK."</TE>
<TE>   With its lower alcohol level, soju may be the drink for people who
enjoy sipping a few cocktails over the course of an evening but don't
want to get drunk. But will this newfound ability to pour soju-based
drinks without a full liquor license have adverse consequences?</TE>
<TE>   "I've done some checking with our offices," says Gill, "and we
have not had any problems with the sale or service of soju in our
licensed locations. Most of our licensees want to do a good job, and
if this allows them to provide alcoholic beverages that are less
intoxicating, that is not a bad thing."</TE>

<DH>Northridge's A-1 Produce and Veggie Lovers Deli doesn't
fail to surprise</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Where do you go for mangoes as sweet as sugar, garbanzos by the
20-pound sack, henna for hand tattooing and a hearty, complex
vegetarian meal? Simple. A-1 Produce and Veggie Lovers Deli in
Northridge.</LD>
<LD>   The Southland abounds with colorful ethnic markets, but Somi
Rehil, former owner of A Taste of India in downtown Burbank, has just
upped the ante. On top of the bulk legumes, jars of mustard seed oil
(essential for Bengali dishes), Ayurvedic medicines and spicy cereal
snacks in foil bags, this big new market includes a restaurant
serving a riot of Indian vegetarian classics, plus some surprise
Mexican and Chinese dishes.</LD>
<LD>   The restaurant is located near the entrance (accessed from the
rear parking lot), but no matter where you are, you can smell its
simmering vegetables. It's a plain, functional place of plastic
chairs and Formica-topped tables.</LD>
<TE>   You slide your tray past a steam table stocked with various stews
and sautes to the cash register, where you order. South Indian snacks
and soups are also available, all cooked to order. Everything is
impeccably fresh and laughably cheap.</TE>
<TE>   How cheap? On my first visit, I got a combination lunch consisting
of a trencherman's portion of bengan bartha (a smoky dish of eggplant
sauteed with tomatoes, onions and spices) and added a heap of basmati
rice, some of the cooling yogurt and chopped vegetable concoction
raita, spiced lentils (dal), the hot, puffy fried bread puri, a pile
of pickled cauliflower yellow from turmeric and a lot of chopped
onions. Six dishes: $3.50.</TE>
<TE>   On another occasion I tried the saag paneer, minced spinach stewed
with big chunks of farmer's cheese, which looks like creamed spinach
from a steakhouse. It's a dish that actually deepens in flavor in a
steam table, and this version is about as good as it gets.</TE>
<TE>   The combination lunch is only one option. Many Indian customers
will be eating masala dosa, wafer-thin lentil flour crepes with a
sour tang that's offset by a complex filling of curried potatoes,
peas and cashews. These seriously crunchy, golden brown dosas are
more than a foot and a half long. Indians generally eat them as
snacks.</TE>
<TE>   You could snack yourself into oblivion here, actually. I loved the
potato bonda, spicy deep-fried potato balls that fairly burst with
steam when bitten. The pakoras are thumb-sized chunks of vegetables
such as cauliflower, onion or fiery green chiles (mirch) enrobed in
yellow lentil flour batter and deep-fried. A-1 sells pakoras to go by
the pound.</TE>
<TE>   From Gandhi's home state of Gujarat comes dhokla, squares of
steamed garbanzo bean flour eaten like cornbread. India does have a
cornbread, makki roti, and you can get that here too. It's actually a
grilled flatbread, and even though Indians don't usually smear it
with butter, it's delicious that way.</TE>
<TE>   Another south Indian specialty that this kitchen does well is
uttapam, a thick griddled semolina pancake studded with bits of
tomato, green chile and onion. This uttapam comes with a small bowl
of thin lentil soup called sambar, strongly flavored with lime and
tamarind.</TE>
<TE>   For customers who aren't into this sort of Indian home cooking,
the kitchen makes a few good Chinese dishes, such as spicy sauteed
tofu, thickly breaded mushrooms with sweet and sour sauce, and even a
vegetarian chow mein of nappa cabbage, carrots, broccoli and noodles.</TE>
<TE>   There also are Mexican specials, which aren't bad either. The
black bean and cheese burrito is fat and flavorful, oozing Oaxacan
cheese. The enchiladas are firm and plump--like Indian pancakes, in
fact, if you omit the cheese.</TE>
<TE>   Most Indian desserts are variations on the theme of milk and
sugar. Barfis are fudge-textured milk sweets laced with almonds or
cashews. One of the best desserts is rasgolla, balls of sweetened
cottage cheese in a rich white cream sauce.</TE>
<TE>   There are also wonderful homemade ice creams (kulfis), rich,
caloric slabs flavored with mango, pistachio and other tropical
fruit. There is even Haagen-Dazs chocolate ice cream in the freezer,
if you insist.</TE>
<TE>   A-1 Produce &amp; Veggie Lovers Deli, 9043 Reseda Blvd., Northridge.
(818) 998-6900. Food served 11:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. daily. No
alcohol. Parking lot. MasterCard and Visa. Lunch for two, $8 to $15.</TE>
<TE>   What to Get: saag paneer, masala dosa, potato bonda, pakoras,
kulfi ice creams.</TE>

<HD>Wearing Their Welcome</HD>
<DH>To get inside a trendy nightspot in L.A., most patrons must
adhere to the club's dress codes--the written one and the unspoken
one</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUISE ROUG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The sign above the door reads: "Strict dress code enforced."
Underneath it, a slight doorman in a dark green suit patrols his
fiefdom, the sidewalk outside Deep. He carries a clipboard but
doesn't consult it as he plucks a select few from the line and lets
them through the tightest door in Hollywood. At his side are two
beefy men in leather jackets, who ensure that no one touches the
velvet rope.</LD>
<LD>   With a growing line of 40 impatient people, the muscle seems
prudent. Standing at the front are three guys in black slacks and
shirts who have spent the better part of their Saturday night--nearly
two hours--waiting. The three, who have driven 90 or so miles from
Temecula, eventually give up. Pointing to his shirt, one guy
exclaims: "I've got flames on my sleeves--that's the reason we're not
getting in."</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles may be the capital of casual couture during the day,
but at night it's quite another world--a land where merciless doormen
enforce a system of dress codes as loosely organized and confusing as
the city itself. The suit and tie that let you breeze past a doorman
in Beverly Hills may only get you a disapproving stare outside a club
in Hollywood. The nightlife dress code, this sartorial fatwa, is as
hard to negotiate as a left turn across Pacific Coast Highway in
July.</LD>
<TE>   Although some clubs advertise formal dress codes, the real rules
are unspoken and nebulous. A given: Show skin, or hold one of the
three universal trump cards--striking good looks, disposable cash or
recognizable celebrity--and you won't have a problem. Possessing none
of these, prepare for, in quick succession, adrenaline, anxiety
followed by possible disapproval, and mortification.</TE>
<TE>   Rejection is always personal, and served up by a neckless guy in a
cheap Italian suit.</TE>
<TE>   Ivan Kane, for one, is unapologetic about inflicting a style
standard on those who want to get into his clubs, Deep and the newly
opened Forty Deuce. To perpetuate the nightlife fantasy--a sexy
escape from the mundane 9-to-5 world--a club has to have the right
mix of beauty, skin and fame.</TE>
<TE>   Fashion is just one ingredient--albeit an important one--in that
mix. But for those who don't pore over the latest issue of In Style,
the rules can seem arbitrary. And, in fact, they are. Kane's dress
code officially bars jeans, sandals, flip-flops, hats and T-shirts.
But then comes the inevitable caveat: "If you get a girl who's
wearing a pair of Frankie B. jeans cut low, we're going to let her
in. If George Clooney shows up in a tank top, we're all good," Kane
says. "The doorman's job is critical. You want a discerning
person.... It's all about the eye. You have got to have a guy who
knows who David Geffen is." (As if on cue, Andy Garcia, in matching
dark pants and shirt, walks by. Kane nods in recognition and approval
and, later, peels off to hug Deep's celebrity of the night.)</TE>
<TE>   To the thwarted partygoer, Kane says this: He's felt your pain.
Really. He's been stranded on the other side of the velvet rope
(though he won't say where). "I was like: 'I want to know what the
memo is.' "</TE>
<TE>   If there's a memo at the Standard Hotel on Sunset Boulevard, it
must read: "Only black. Preferably skimpy. Definitely no pleated
pants."</TE>
<TE>   On the poolside deck this June night, dozens of young,
well-dressed men and women lounged above the city's glittering grid.
In a corner, a man (in slacks sans pleats) tries to get a phone
number from Taniesah Evans, a 29-year-old marketing executive who, on
this night, has opted for the tight and timeless: snug black jeans, a
black top and a soft leather jacket.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to get through the door, you have to present a
certain look," says Evans, who has style to spare. "In New York,
people are very honest about dress codes. It's harder in L.A. because
it's more hidden, and there's more variety and different styles. It
makes it harder to judge what to wear."</TE>
<TE>   Evans shops specifically for going-out clothes and dresses
according to her destination. She's concluded that the beach cities,
including Santa Monica and Venice, are more casual; day turning into
night doesn't have to mean a wardrobe change. Not so in Hollywood,
where dressing like you just spent a month's salary at Fred Segal
spells the difference between dancing the night away and a night
spent crying into a drink at some T.G.I. Friday's.</TE>
<TE>   "In Santa Monica, I can wear jeans, tank top, sandals. On Sunset,
you need heels--stilettos. In Hollywood, I can wear a leopard print
and a short skirt." For an open-ended night, the wardrobe has to be
versatile, hence Evans' black on black.</TE>
<TE>   The other universal pass: attire so audacious that it turns heads
no matter where you go. That's the look that Casey Reuter, 20, and
Brooke Bader, 21, have as they breeze through the Standard's lobby.
Dressed "techie"--like techno, they patiently explain--fashion
students Reuter and Bader wear tight club wear and glitter, with
Bader baring her midriff and Reuter in a red mini dress set off with
rainbow-striped leg warmers. The only person unmoved is the underwear
model chatting on a cell phone in the glass cage above the
concierge's desk.</TE>
<TE>   "People who go out in jeans drive me crazy," says Reuter, batting
her glittery lashes and drawing crazy out into a very long word. "I
want to be a fashion idol, like Donatella Versace."</TE>
<TE>   Those aspirations, though, demand effort. And a deep closet.</TE>
<TE>   "I will probably change eight times before going out," says Bader.</TE>
<TE>   Admittedly, the hard work of dressing right isn't just for the
sake of the doorman. There are people inside to impress too--people
who can be even more critical.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon Martinez, nursing a drink nearby, says he's pretty
disgusted by what he sees in the bars and clubs on the Strip. "Low,
low, low pants," the hairdresser says, with a sneer. "Tiny shirts."
In short: "Low-rider pants, highlighted hair." Fashion is fickle, he
says, and the Sunset Strip is a tourist trap. Bad combination.</TE>
<TE>   "It attracts a lot of people from Orange County. You wonder what
some of them were thinking. I mean, the sequined tops? Please, shoot
me."</TE>
<TE>   He goes back to the bar.</TE>
<TE>   Doormen--and they are almost all men--are toughest on their own
sex. Again, it's that nightlife fantasy equation: Clubs need women
inside because men--straight men, at least--go where the women are.
Upset that balance, let too many men inside, and the fantasy becomes
a Darwinian nightmare.</TE>
<TE>   There is, frankly, also a certain simplicity to women's clubgoing
attire: Look sexy. Low necklines, high heels and bare shoulders seem
universally acceptable. The visual clues for men are more subtle.</TE>
<TE>   At Deep, 34-year-old Harrison Kordestani wears fashionably slim
dark pants and a black shirt open at the neck to reveal generous
tufts of hair. But the winning touch is his shoes, purchased on a
recent business trip to Italy. His nails are recently manicured,
buffed and polished and shiny. He estimates the tally on this
evening's outfit at about $500.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a dress code in Los Angeles," says Kordestani, while
women in skimpy underwear writhe in a plexiglass box above the dance
floor. "You can't wear your suit from work. It needs to be very sharp
or smart. Form-fitting."</TE>
<TE>   Falene Nurse, a British expat, says that those fine distinctions
of fashion often escape the men. Creating a look is all about the
details--blending the clothes, the haircut, even the right posture.
The same T-shirt and dyed denim jacket can say shy and sexy, or poor
and sloppy. "On Melrose and in the clubs, you see the young Hollywood
boys, a lot of people trying to look like British mods," Nurse says.
"But, it's not about the feather cut; they don't understand the
'shoegazer.' They look good, but they don't get it."</TE>
<TE>   (Her two friends, Marlayna Cherisse, 23, and Shalome Zavaro, 30,
say that they don't get the "shoegazer" thing either. Though another
friend does. "It's the Charlatans. The Stone Roses. Early, early,
early Smashing Pumpkins," she explains, with the pop culture acumen
of a Nick Hornby character.)</TE>
<TE>   Inside the club, 31-year-old Ed Gillespie leans back against the
bar for a view of the dance floor. "The L.A. vibe: Everyone's
fashionable here," he says, surveying the crowd. In Hollywood, he is
simultaneously careful and casual.</TE>
<TE>   "Some nights are leather, but, really, I do the A to Z of fashion.
From the Prada shoes to the thrift store."</TE>
<TE>   Tonight that is, in fact, his outfit: a patterned shirt found at a
thrift store, Theory pants, Prada shoes and Dior sunglasses in the
dreads. Rarely, he says, does he have problems at the door.</TE>
<TE>   Don't think of the doorman as a bouncer. Think of him as an
artist.</TE>
<TE>   He's picking out people to create an "overall look" for the club,
says veteran doorman Steven Atkins, a 6-foot-7 former bodybuilder
from Australia. He worked one of the toughest doors in town, SkyBar
at the Mondrian Hotel, for six years and is now raising money to
start his own club. (He once wrote a rap song, "Just a Doorman,"
detailing the travails of his job.)</TE>
<TE>   For guys, he offers this advice: "A nice tucked-in shirt. Not
necessarily a tie, but comb your hair. Flip-flops, no. Sneakers, no."
The best accessory, however, is a woman. Groups of guys are much less
likely to get in, he says, whereas women "can get away with almost
everything." And while he says that today's doormen are all about
maintaining decorum, they are also uncompromising when it comes to
upholding that "overall look."</TE>
<TE>   "If I see a guy who's 300 to 400 pounds, they may be perfectly
nice," he says, "but ... I don't want to get in trouble."</TE>
<TE>   That's the harsh truth of the matter. The hotter the spot, the
more picky (read: blatantly ageist, look-ist and body-ist) the
doorman can, and will, be.</TE>
<TE>   "There are clubs, they'll make you feel like it's the ... gates of
heaven. That you're lucky to get in," concurs DJ Paul V. But "the
Studio 54 thing, that's so two decades ago."</TE>
<TE>   At Paul V's Dragstrip 66, a popular monthly event at Rudolpho's in
Silver Lake, there's no dress code, just "a dress inspiration." A
flier for a typical Saturday, for instance, advises dressing
"tutti-frutti or coochie-coochie."</TE>
<TE>   About 700 people eventually will get in; it's just a matter of how
quickly. There are three lines for the door: a slow lane, a
semi-express lane and the fast lane. Sabrah, wearing a sombrero with
yellow tassels, an orange shirt with ruffled sleeves and a
full-length black skirt, steers guests to their destiny. "Spell your
last name," Sabrah asks a guy in jeans and T-shirt, checking her
guest list. Slow lane. A Carmen Miranda look-alike with a
medium-sized fruit basket as headgear? No question. Fast lane.</TE>
<TE>   Tina Telemundo (a.k.a. Christian Satrustegui) exchanges air kisses
with Sabrah while zipping down the fast lane. His minuscule gold
chain-link outfit is perfectly tailored to the club. But his parting
words you could take anywhere: "You always have to look like you have
a better place to go."</TE>

<HD>How a Doorman Sees It</HD>
<DH>He's gotten perks, wielded power--and stood around in the
cold all night.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Louise Roug</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Keith Rosary has seen how low people will go to try to get into a
club.</LD>
<LD>   And it's not pretty.</LD>
<LD>   Rosary, who started working in clubs 20 years ago when he was 18,
has seen the hopeful give away jewelry, throw punches and even file
suit to get in.</LD>
<TE>   "Wearing a press pass from 1942, coming up, saying, 'Press,' " he
said. Calling from "Steven Spielberg's office" to get on the guest
list; yes, he's heard that one a few times. "But then when you ask
them for a business card, they won't have one."</TE>
<TE>   Rosary, who has worked the door at the Highlands, the Garage, the
Palace and Martini Lounge, could teach a short course in nightclub
history. In the 1970s, the rock 'n' roll years, the bouncers looked
like bikers and in some cases were: Hells Angels members worked
"security" at some places. That gave way to the "velvet rope
mentality" spawned in the late '70s and early '80s at the famed New
York dance club Studio 54.</TE>
<TE>   "The headset and shades constituted the cool doorman look. You
didn't have to look at the guests, and it was cool to ignore them,"
he said. "It was a power thing. To ignore you, to miss you, that was
to have the power." The now-defunct Vertigo, where he worked for a
while, nearly got its liquor license revoked because of its
discriminatory dress code. Four men sued and won $250 each in Small
Claims Court when a dress code kept them out of the Mayan. So someone
invented the guest list.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, there's no list," Rosary confessed. "That's just a way
to keep people out."</TE>
<TE>   And those powers of inclusion or, more often, exclusion ensure
doormen good graft. Some guests have dropped up to $1,000 at the
door, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what it's all about: If you take care of me, I'll take
care of you. The perks are incredible." A week after he slipped Tommy
Hilfiger into an exclusive MTV party, for instance, Rosary received
an entire spring wardrobe in gratitude.</TE>
<TE>   "But we go through so much," he said. "We're underpaid, and we
stand out here in the cold, all night."</TE>

<HD>Advice From the Masters</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Arnovitz and Tom Williams</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You're not getting in. Not tonight.</LD>
<LD>   Forget about arguing your case or explaining that you're really
beautiful inside. To catch the doorman's eye, you've got to have the
right clothes and project the right attitude.</LD>
<LD>   That's what Kevin Arnovitz and Tom Williams found out while they
were editing and assembling Zagat's first "Los Angeles Nightlife"
guide, which assesses more than 650 bars, clubs and lounges. We asked
for their advice on getting past the velvet rope.</LD>
<TE>   * Project confidence. The velvet rope can smell fear and
insecurity, so smile widely on your approach, greet the bouncer
cordially and act as if this is your weekly jaunt to the Sunday
farmers market. Remember, it's easier to attract bees with honey than
with vinegar, so have a good attitude. Bouncers have little patience
for petulance from a diva in stilettos or a bruiser in leather.</TE>
<TE>   * Do your homework. Call ahead for details such as door policy,
theme nights and guest lists. A sensible way to avoid hassles is to
check out a hot club on an off night or to arrive early in the
evening before the bouncer assumes his perch.</TE>
<TE>   * It's all about context. Arrive well-groomed and well-assembled
no matter where you go. Clubs look for a diverse, sexy crowd and for
those who bring something unique to the party. That said, the clean
Prada suit that might write your ticket into Joseph's on a Monday
night could attract dirty looks at the biker bar just over the hill.
And, unless you're in a bar with peanut shells on the floor or a game
on the big-screen TV, flip-flops, shorts, baseball caps or T-shirts
will get you nothing but a raised eyebrow from the bouncer.</TE>
<TE>   * Remember the ratio. Fellas, avoid marching up to a club with
your "Swingers"-esque posse of guys. Club proprietors like to
maintain a healthy ratio of women to men. Don't expect any fraternal
empathy from the bouncer.</TE>
<TE>   * Cut your losses. Waiting outside for divine intervention from
the nightlife gods is a bad idea. If you've been there more than five
minutes and sense you're on the outside looking in, you probably
are--for whatever reason. Don't cause a scene. Chalk it up to
experience.</TE>
<TE>   * To thine own self be true. If you don't feel comfortable in the
painted-on jeans or super-starched shirts that everyone seems to be
wearing on site, chances are that it's not your crowd. Keep looking.
The clubs might discriminate, but Los Angeles takes all kinds.</TE>

<LD>When I heard that actor Vincent Schiavelli would be cooking a
Sicilian menu last Thursday at Alto Palato, I immediately made a
reservation for four.</LD>
<LD>   The familiar character actor, who has appeared in "One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest," "Ghost" and "Amadeus," among other films, is a
wonderful cook and author of two books about Sicilian cuisine.</LD>
<LD>   The first, "Papa Andrea's Sicilian Table: Recipes and Remembrances
of My Grandfather," reconstructs the dishes young Schiavelli learned
at his grandfather's side in Brooklyn. The second, "Bruculinu,
America: Remembrances of Sicilian-American Brooklyn, Told in Stories
and Recipes," part memoir, part cookbook, recounts growing up in that
neighborhood.</LD>
<TE>   Papa Andrea, however, wasn't just another grandfather who enjoyed
cooking. Before he emigrated from Polizzi Generosa in north-central
Sicily to America, he had been among the last in the long tradition
of monzu, master chefs who worked for noble families of Sicily and
Naples. So the young Schiavelli had quite a teacher.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's prix fixe menu began with white eggplant marinated in
lemon and extra-virgin olive oil and scattered with shavings of
pecorino cheese. The raw, thinly sliced eggplant was incredibly
delicious--earthy and green.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was a delicate pasta dish of ditali (short ribbed
pasta) sauced with fava beans, baby artichokes, asparagus and peas
perfumed with wild fennel.</TE>
<TE>   For the main course, Schiavelli braised shoulder lamb chops in
white wine and onions, and finished them with cherry tomatoes.
Wonderful, really. The flavorful shoulder is for some reason rarely
served in restaurants. He paired it with carrots infused with clove
and rolled in drawn butter.</TE>
<TE>   I wanted to eat the whole menu over again, it was that good.</TE>
<TE>   Looking quite the chef, Schiavelli did a turn around the room,
fielding compliments and explaining the dishes to anyone who asked.</TE>
<TE>   To most of L.A., Sicilian food is a cipher. Even Celestino Drago,
with his longtime following, wasn't able to make a go of his Sicilian
restaurant, L'Arancino. But Schiavelli is proposing not Sicilian 101,
but graduate courses in intricate and remarkably subtle Sicilian
cuisine with its Greek, Roman, Arabic, Norman, French and Spanish
influences.</TE>
<TE>   This is just the beginning: Schiavelli will present a Sicilian
menu every Thursday night (that is, whenever he's not away filming).
Tonight's, for example, is baked warm zucchini flowers stuffed with
mushroom-flavored bechamel, pasta in a roasted sweet red pepper sauce
enhanced with pancetta and garlic, and veal shoulder roast marinated
and baked in Marsala wine with onion and black peppercorns.</TE>
<TE>   At $35 a person for three courses, not including tax and tip,
that's quite a deal and worth getting out to savor the tastes of
Sicily.</TE>
<TE>   Alto Palato, 755 N. La Cienega Blvd., West Hollywood; (310)
657-9271. Vincent Schiavelli three-course menu $35 a person, not
including tax or tip; call for menu. Thursday nights only. (The
restaurant's regular menu is also available.)</TE>

<HD>La Habra Celebrates Baseball and a Talented Favorite Son</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL MILLER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Take Me Out to the Ballgame," this summer's exhibit at the
Children's Museum at La Habra, will touch all the bases of the
national pastime, from batting practice to old radio broadcasts. But
the most significant part of the show may be the display off to one
side of the museum.</LD>
<LD>   That's where the museum honors the underdogs of baseball history:
players in the Negro Leagues who excelled even though they were
denied the opportunity to play in the majors, and Hispanic immigrants
who were ambitious enough to seek tryouts for teams that never would
have scouted them.</LD>
<LD>   "We want the kids to see that there was talent and recognition
outside the major leagues as well," says April Baxter, the museum's
curator. "But we're not going to dwell on the hardships so much as
the fact that everybody can play baseball, and everybody can make it
if they try hard enough."</LD>
<TE>   Can modern-day kids from in and around La Habra, with their
pressed uniforms and organized Little League, identify with these
players from an earlier era? Possibly--since the player at the center
of the exhibit, Jesse Flores, is a La Habra legend himself.</TE>
<TE>   Flores, who made history as the first Mexican pitcher ever to
appear in the majors, played for seven seasons in the 1940s. His
photograph and biography will grace that wall of the museum about
baseball's underdogs.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Guadalajara in 1914, the youngest of six children, Flores
emigrated to La Habra with his family when he was 9. Flores spoke no
English when he came to California and dropped out of school after
the eighth grade to work in the citrus fields with his father and
brothers. He developed a knack for baseball, often playing at what is
now Portola Park, the field next to the Children's Museum. "It was
just a barren field by the train station back then," says Josie
Anderson, Flores' second cousin and a longtime La Habra resident.</TE>
<TE>   In 1938, when the Chicago Cubs held a tryout camp in L.A., Flores
went and landed a minor-league contract. Four years later, he finally
got a taste of the big leagues. He went on to play seven seasons for
the Cubs, Philadelphia Athletics and Cleveland Indians, winning 44
games and hurling 11 shutouts.</TE>
<TE>   Even after his pitching career was over, Flores stuck with
baseball. He started a short-lived semipro team, the La Habra Tigers,
in the late '40s, and from 1955 until his death in 1991, he worked as
a major league talent scout, mostly for the Minnesota Twins. In 1987,
he was inducted into the Mexican Baseball Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, the city of La Habra honored him with a special plaque
at Portola Park. The park's three baseball diamonds--all much neater
than the field where he played as a child--are now known as the Jesse
Flores Sports Complex.</TE>
<TE>   "Take Me Out to the Ballgame," which continues through Sept. 1,
allows visitors to learn about baseball in many other ways. The
museum's main room features a 12-by-12-foot baseball diamond with
soft bats and balls and a listening station with recordings of
historic baseball broadcasts and a video of the famed Abbott &amp;
Costello routine "Who's on First?" Even kids who aren't interested in
swinging a bat can get into the action by trying on period spectator
costumes.</TE>
<TE>   Being central to such an exhibit is a legacy Flores would have
appreciated. "He was instrumental in getting kids off the street and
getting them to play ball," recalls a relative, Steve Anderson. "He'd
throw them a ball and say, 'Let's get busy.' "</TE>
<TE>   "Take Me Out to the Ballgame," Children's Museum at La Habra, 301
S. Euclid St. Mondays-Saturdays, 10 a.m.-5 p.m.; Sundays, 1-5 p.m.
$4; $5 after July 1. Through Sept. 1. (562) 905-9793.</TE>

<LD>* The comedian's concert film, "Notorious C.H.O.," opens Friday at
the Nuart Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   The 'Burbs: I just bought my first house [in Glendale] and I'm so
into it. There's a store called the Great Outdoors in Burbank; it's
this huge, kind of upscale Home Depot, where they have less of the
nuts and bolts and more of the fun stuff like fixtures and accents. I
go there so often it's really sick. Home improvement is totally like
a drug. You start it and then you think, "Oh I can handle this," but
you have to get more and more involved.</LD>
<LD>   Buddha Hunting: I buy a lot of my furniture and artwork from Koan
Collection on Melrose. I collect sacred art from all over the world
and they specialize in sacred art from Asia, Southeast Asia, India
and my favorite place, Tibet. I try to represent every type of Buddha
there is. I have almost the whole set.</LD>
<TE>   Get Physical: On the weekends I like to go to the early-morning
yoga class, preferably Bikram yoga. They heat the room up to 104
degrees and you do 26 postures, which are very intense and difficult
and you sweat like crazy. I go to a studio in Pasadena, Bikram's Yoga
College of India.</TE>
<TE>   Night Out: I really love music. Saturday night I might go see a
show, something at Largo. I just went to see Elvis Costello, which
was totally amazing, at the Kodak Theatre. I've become such an adult
now, when I go see rock shows I just can't stand in the pit anymore,
I have to sit down.</TE>
<TE>   Spiritual Hunger: Sunday I would probably meet with my Sangha
group. We get together and do these spiritual things, like hiring
mediums, visiting channelers and all this really crazy New Age stuff.
It's a lot of fun. The whole point of doing yoga and for going to all
these different churches or meditating or whatever, is to divert all
the energy I was using up as an anorexic/bulimic. I've kind of
transformed this hunger for food and for nurturance with a search for
spiritual knowledge and for this kind of greater hunger.</TE>

<HD>Intriguing Colley Quartet Deserves a Higher Profile</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Scott Colley Quartet isn't an ensemble that shows up prominently
on anyone's jazz radar screen. But with a lineup that includes, in
addition to bassist Colley, saxophonist Ravi Coltrane, guitarist Adam
Rogers and drummer Bill Stewart--each a leader in his own right--it
should, and, one hopes, soon will.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday night at the Jazz Bakery, the quartet played an opening
set belying the fact that the musicians were still somewhat glazed
from having flown in that afternoon. And Coltrane, his luggage still
in transit, played with his usual sense of musical authority, even
though he only had a single reed available--and one that did not meet
his high standards.</LD>
<LD>   Given the tight schedules that confront most jazz groups, opening
nights can always be hazardous, of course. But the Colley players
managed, better than most, to adjust quickly to the Bakery's
acoustics and, after the first number, to settle into a productive
musical groove.</LD>
<TE>   Their performance was driven throughout by the marvelously
symbiotic interaction between Colley and Stewart. Both are vastly
more than mere rhythm-section support players, bringing subtle layers
of musicality to everything they play. In one instance, Colley opened
a piece with a virtuosic cadenza before launching into a high-speed,
musically precise bass line. Elsewhere, he brought a sense of
compositional structure to the solos of Coltrane and Rogers, shifting
and altering his phrasing around their individual flows of invention.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart extracted a stunning array of sounds from his drum kit,
using sticks and hands, striking and rubbing his percussion,
alternating thunderous bursts of energy with sudden dynamic shifts
into small, understated rhythmic passages. He did so, in addition,
while maintaining an urgently irresistible sense of swing and forward
momentum. Together, Colley and Stewart offered a virtual seminar in
the creativity--too often unrevealed--at the heart of the jazz rhythm
section.</TE>
<TE>   The combination of Coltrane and Rogers was equally intriguing. In
pieces such as Ornette Coleman's "Alpha," their similarly dark and
mellow sounds interacted and blended, occasionally moving through
pungent dissonances, at other times swerving into side-by-side
harmony. There was more contrast in their individual efforts, with
Coltrane tending to build his choruses by combining and contrasting
snippets of instantly generated melody. Rogers, on a different path,
favored long, lean phrases, often interrupting their flow with sudden
flurries of fast-fingered bop lines.</TE>
<TE>   Best of all, the Colley Quartet revealed its presence at the crest
of a new wave of 21st century jazz. Without resorting to artificial
insertions and additions of pop music elements, they displayed the
evolutionary life force that is omnipresent in the music--beyond
bebop, beyond fusion, beyond '90s revisionism and beyond the view
that jazz must distort its essential identity to survive.</TE>
<TE>   The Scott Colley Quartet at the Jazz Bakery, 3233 Helms Ave., L.A.
Tonight through Sunday at 8 and 9:30 p.m. $25. (310) 271-9039.</TE>

<LD>Like many musicians, Gary Wilson will always remember the first time
he heard himself referred to in a high-profile setting. It came at
the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards when Beck cited one of his songs.</LD>
<LD>   "They interviewed him as he was walking out and he started talking
about [Wilson's song] '6.4,' " says Wilson, who remembers being
stunned as he watched the telecast.</LD>
<LD>   This landmark moment came a full 22 years after Wilson's lone
album was released.</LD>
<TE>   The very embodiment of obscurity, "You Think You Really Know Me"
was a strange, sinister mix of art-pop and avant-garde strangeness
veering between Steely Dan subversion and John Cage abstraction. It
was recorded by Wilson in his parents' Endicott, N.Y., basement and
released without the help of a label. He printed only about 2,500
copies, reaching an audience seemingly limited to college radio
programmers, who gave the record what little airplay it got, and
members of the art-weirdness group the Residents, who for a time kept
up an encouraging correspondence with him.</TE>
<TE>   Today, not only does the album boast Beck's endorsement, but it
was also reissued earlier this year by the New York independent label
Motel Records, drawing rave reviews and sales already approaching
10,000 copies. In his first show in more than 20 years, in May at
Joe's Pub in New York, Wilson delivered his music and performance art
(fondling a mannequin, getting pelted with flour) to a rabidly
enthusiastic audience. He'll repeat the exercise Friday at the
Knitting Factory Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Is the new attention belated vindication for his distinctive
musical vision?</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe that's reading a little more into it," says a sanguine
Wilson, 48, who's been living a low-key life in San Diego for more
than 20 years. "I'm flattered everyone likes it now. It's a great joy
for it to come around again."</TE>
<TE>   Wilson hadn't exactly been looking for a comeback. After a
fruitless late-'70s move to the West Coast to try to stir label
interest, he turned away from the music business, settling in San
Diego and starting a series of jobs--deli server, theater usher, and,
currently, keyboardist in an Italian restaurant lounge band and
weekend night-shift clerk at an adult book store.</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago, interest in Wilson started to grow in record
collector circles. One collector, musician Ross Harris, made a copy
of the album for Beck, who was so taken with it that he name-checked
Wilson in his hit "Where It's At" ("Passin' the dutchie from coast to
coast / Like my man Gary Wilson rocks the most") and occasionally
performed Wilson's oddball ode "6.4 = Makeout" in concert. Wilson,
who didn't really follow pop music, heard vaguely through friends
about Beck's references, but it wasn't until seeing the MTV interview
that he believed it.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he wasn't waiting for a record company to call at this late
date. He didn't even have a phone.</TE>
<TE>   "I often wondered after I put the album out why it met so much
resistance," he says. "I could never figure it out at the time. But
after a certain number of years, you accept your fate, so to speak."</TE>
<TE>   An Unexpected Turn</TE>
<TE>   Fate, though, took an unexpected turn earlier this year when
collector Harris played Wilson's album for Motel Records owners
Christina Bates and Adrian Milan.</TE>
<TE>   "We were blown away and said, 'What do you know about this guy?' "
Milan says. "Ross said, 'I've been looking for him for five years and
other people have as well, and no one can track him down.' I said, 'I
don't care. I'm going to find him.' "</TE>
<TE>   After two frenetic weeks, the pair and the private investigator
they hired had turned up nothing. But on a hunch, Bates tracked down
Vince Rossi, a former member of Wilson's band the Blind Dates, who
was still living in Endicott. Rossi was able to get word to Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   A week later, Wilson finally called, although he was not wholly
enthusiastic about their proposal to put the album out.</TE>
<TE>   "He had this dream and persona for so long and had to let it die
in order to live regularly," Bates says. "And re-sparking that was
probably scary. He had to work past that."</TE>
<TE>   By and large, he has worked past it, the key moment coming when he
walked on stage in New York to front a band featuring Rossi on
keyboards and Milan on drums. (For the L.A show, Wilson will be
backed by a group that includes Harris, Milan, original Blind Date
Joe Lunga on keyboards and Ed Ruscha on bass.)</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't done too many huge things" since making the album,
Wilson says. "Just trying to keep going without getting too bummed
out in life. Try to keep it so I don't have too much stress. Then I
do these shows, and it's a contradiction. I was worried about that
before I went to New York, but once I got there and saw how much fun
it was, I was fine.</TE>
<TE>   "I was surprised when I walked out and people knew my songs. There
were people from the Village Voice and the New York Times, but also a
whole core group of younger kids who knew the lyrics, which was kind
of intriguing. Twenty-five years ago people were throwing stuff at
me."</TE>

<LD>   The Exonerated--To speak of life-or-death stakes in "The
Exonerated" is, for once, no exaggeration. Created and directed by
New York-based Jessica Blank and Erik Jensen from interviews they
conducted with former death-row inmates whose wrongful convictions
were eventually overturned, a riveting Actors' Gang staging examines
capital punishment and the justice system in chilling terms. By
depicting the stories of six innocent people (out of 100 similar
cases and rising), this devastating docudrama proves more profound
and persuasive than any rhetorical pitch to abstract moral
principles. In some respects, Blank and Jensen's effort was
simplified by the drama inherent in the facts. Nevertheless, the work
benefits from the skillful way the stories are interwoven and paced
to build tension and momentum. Rising to the importance of their
task, a talented Actors' Gang ensemble makes the most of this charged
material.</LD>

<DH>Mad magazine-style 'Poseidon Adventure' musical is best
after the ship goes topsy-turvy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When your world gets turned upside-down, you've got to pick yourself
up and start climbing.</LD>
<LD>   Recognize the message? It was delivered in a seminal film from
1972: "The Poseidon Adventure."</LD>
<LD>   And you thought it was just a disaster movie.</LD>
<TE>   Recognizing the film for the cultural icon that it is, writers
Bill Robens and Genemichael Barrera playfully pull it apart and put
it back together in "The Poseidon Adventure: The Musical!" It's a fun
idea, though its potential is reached only in fits and starts in this
Opiate of the Masses production at the Tamarind Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   Robens and Barrera's Mad magazine-style treatment is a virtual
scene-by-scene replay of the movie, with some elements exaggerated
for comic effect. It's a significantly reworked version of the
"Poseidon Adventure" musical that they developed with different
collaborators three years ago. Its spirit is much the same as last
year's "The Towering Inferno: The Musical!," also an Opiate of the
Masses production and co-written by Robens, with many of the same
performers.</TE>
<TE>   The talky setup bits are pretty lame, but once a tidal wave flips
the passenger ship Poseidon upside-down, Kiff Scholl's direction
helps keep things interesting. The big scene in which passengers are
thrown onto the ceiling of the grand salon is one of the best, as a
strobe light reveals flickering images of the cast scooting, tumbling
and cartwheeling from one side of the stage to the other.</TE>
<TE>   From then on, a small band of survivors climbs toward the upended
bottom of the ship. The water that relentlessly advances toward them
is evoked--as was the fire in "Towering Inferno"--by dancers.</TE>
<TE>   Here, the sea god Poseidon (Miguel Montalvo) directs chorus girls
(Leanne Fonteyn, Erika Gardner, Josie Gundy and Amy Roulet) through
fluid, Busby Berkeley-style numbers choreographed by Fonteyn. The
cleverest is a fan dance that encircles Monica Carbery's Shelley
Winters character during her heroic underwater swimming sequence.</TE>
<TE>   Carbery gives the most winning performance as Winters' Belle
Rosen, while Scholl gamely dances through a big production number on
a shattered leg as Roddy McDowall's steward, and Marin Van Vleck
channels Carol Lynley for a groovy rendition of the movie's pop
theme, "The Morning After."</TE>
<TE>   The new songs--written in a pastiche of styles by Robens, Barrera
and Scholl--are OK, but the cast's lack of singing talent makes most
a trial on the ears.</TE>
<TE>   "The Poseidon Adventure: The Musical!," Tamarind Theatre, 5919
Franklin Ave., Hollywood. Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 4
p.m. Ends Aug. 3. $20. (323) 960-5755. Running time: 1 hour, 50
minutes.</TE>

<LD>   Pavarotti's Swan Song: On 70th Birthday, 2005</LD>
<LD>   Luciano Pavarotti's retirement has long been a subject of
speculation. And the buzz heated up in May when the tenor canceled
two concerts at New York City's Metropolitan Opera House due to
illness.</LD>
<TE>   On Tuesday's edition of CNN's "Connie Chung Tonight," Pavarotti
finally played his hand. His last note will be sung on his 70th
birthday--Oct. 12, 2005--the operatic legend said.</TE>
<TE>   "I am busy for two or three years more and then I will retire...
," said Pavarotti, 66. He maintained that he would not sing after
that time, "not even when I'm taking the shower."</TE>
<TE>   The singer didn't say whether he's already retired from the opera
stage. Some wonder whether his January performance at London's Royal
Opera and the recent Met commitment were his swan songs at those
venues. Though a Three Tenors World Cup concert (in which he'll sing
with Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras) is scheduled for today in
Japan, no opera is on his itinerary. According to CNN, he currently
schedules about 40 dates a year--mostly arena performances--that
bring him about $35 million.</TE>
<TE>   Chung asked whether his decision to retire is linked to a decline
in voice quality or poor health. Negative, the tenor replied. Maybe
it's a matter of priorities: He plans to marry Nicoletta Mantovani,
32, his companion of six years, before 2003, he told Chung. And
they're thinking about having children, he said--"one or two or 10."</TE>
<TE>   Madrid Police, FBI Recover Stolen Art</TE>
<TE>   A police sting in Madrid recovered 10 works of art, collectively
said to be worth an estimated $50 million. They were stolen last year
from the private collection of Spanish billionaire Esther
Koplowitz--listed by Forbes as the 445th richest person in the world.</TE>
<TE>   The loot was seized after Spanish police officers posed as
Americans interested in buying Pieter Brueghel's "The Temptation of
St. Antonio," the BBC reports. The painting's identity was confirmed
by an FBI agent posing as an art expert (the agency has a team
devoted to Eurasian organized crime). Three men were arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Nine other paintings, including pieces by Camille Pissarro and
Goya, were found in a car parked near a football stadium, but a
handful are still missing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the most important art seizure in the last decade
internationally, both for its artistic and economic value," said
Madrid Police Chief Juan Cotino.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Grammy-winning R&amp;B singer R. Kelly pleaded innocent to charges of
child pornography Wednesday. He's due back in the Chicago courtroom
on Aug. 7.... India.Arie was named best female R&amp;B artist at Tuesday
night's Black Entertainment Television Awards. Usher was chosen top
male R&amp;B performer.... A Picasso portrait of his mistress fetched
$23.9 million--almost double the estimate--at Christie's auction
house in London.... Luisa Cariaga, managing director of Deaf West
Theatre, has been appointed executive director of Los Angeles'
American Youth Symphony.... Bass Samuel Ramey, 60, star of the Los
Angeles Opera production of "Duke Bluebeard's Castle" and "Gianni
Schicchi," will marry soprano Lindsey Larson, 38, on Saturday in
Sioux Falls, S.D. Ramey and Frederica von Stade will sing at the
wedding.... Metropolitan Opera board member Lewis S. Ranieri has been
appointed board chairman of American Ballet Theatre, succeeding Gerry
Grinberg.... Antonio Banderas will star in HBO's "Pancho Villa as
Himself," playing the Mexican revolutionary.</TE>

<LD>* New This Week: Director Guillermo del Toro (who did "Cronos,"
"Mimic" and "Blade II") sets the fable "The Devil's Backbone" in a
remote, fortress-like boys' school in the waning days of the Spanish
Civil War. Here again, he adds a touch of the supernatural to his
compelling, sometimes darkly amusing vision of the universe as a vast
mechanism in which the individual is in constant peril through the
workings of pride and chance. With this ambitious and ominous film,
Del Toro rises to a new level of accomplishment, adding history and
politics to his distinctive blend. Fernando Tielve, Federico Luppi,
Marisa Paredes and Eduardo Noriega star. In Spanish, with English
subtitles.</LD>

<HD>Life Gets Complicated After This 'Stranger' Enters the
House</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID D. NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than one schizophrenic quality surfaces in "Stranger," now at
Theatre/Theater. Brett Pearsons' new psychosexual thriller is buoyed
by respectable staging and playing, while struggling to integrate a
disparity of tone and scope.</LD>
<LD>   At the outset, prototypical yuppie Glenn (Pearsons) is practicing
golf shots at home when he is interrupted by a visitor (Max Koch)
passing himself off as Davis, a close friend of Glenn's girlfriend,
Michelle. Their banter serves as expositional underpinning, planting
plot turns and character traits in a wide swath.</LD>
<LD>   This faintly sitcom ambience is upended when Michelle (Jeni
Verdon) and the real Davis (Michael Porter) enter on the heels of the
imposter's exit.</LD>
<TE>   After another deceptively chirpy scene, with nearly certified
therapist Davis agreeing to treat Michelle, the narrative shifts into
overdrive. In a neighborhood bar tended by the pivotal Gail (Sydney
Bennett), the stranger ingratiates himself with Michelle, using
information gleaned from Glenn. A series of cat-and-mouse gambits
transpires.</TE>
<TE>   Director Joshua Biton makes inventive use of the utilitarian
setting; lighting designer David Flad's deft deployment of limited
resources is invaluable. Biton's cast is committed though not
impervious to the script's limitations.</TE>
<TE>   Pearsons' comedy background suits Glenn's wiseacre tendencies,
less so his histrionic ones. Verdon's Michelle traces her descending
emotional arc more seamlessly than it is written, with the climactic
retracing of trauma beautifully handled.</TE>
<TE>   Porter's measured rationality is appropriate, and Bennett wields
her slender instrument to notable effect, particularly in
unsettlingly recalling her own encounter with the stranger. Koch
valiantly attempts to fuse his innate joviality with his character's
pathology with only intermittent success. He is perhaps the chief
casualty of the textual discrepancies.</TE>
<TE>   The overly brisk trajectory renders the twists foreseeable and, in
the case of Michelle's back story, manufactured, with the motif of
therapeutic transference barely developed. True, the climactic
face-off does generate frissons, yet these are still less reminiscent
of classic boulevard thrillers than of episodic television, which
fairly sums up this game effort.</TE>
<TE>   "Stranger," Theatre/Theater, 6425 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood.
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m. Ends July 20. $10-$15. (323) 850-8969.
Mature audiences. Running time: 1 hour, 35 minutes.</TE>

<LD>Scoping Sona: Chef David Myer, who used to head the kitchen at Jaan
in Raffle's L'Ermitage Hotel, has sealed the deal on a location for
his soon-to-be Sona restaurant. He and his wife, Michelle, the former
executive pastry chef at Patina, will transform the old Europa space
on La Cienega into a modern spot with the finery of a first-class
restaurant, including Rosenthal china and Spiegelau stemware. But
don't expect French classics here; Myer and Myer will serve
French/Californian cuisine. The wine list will be designed by Chris
Sandin, the former general manager of the Wine House and Wally's and
former buyer for the Wine Cask of Santa Barbara. Sona is slated to
open Sept. 1.</LD>
<TE>   Indian Food with a Michelin Chef: Do you remember the original
India's Oven on Pico near Fairfax? It spawned several dozen imitators
around Los Angeles in the '80s, as well as stirring interest in
Indian food. Well, the two guys behind all this, Singh Navraj and his
son, R.J., are now opening a whole different kind of Indian
restaurant in the heart of Silver Lake. Tantra will have an
exceedingly lush decor full of rich colors and sensual Indian
fabrics. Beside a dining room, it will have a lounge where
contemporary Indian music will set the mood while you nosh on Indian
appetizers and sip cocktails (e.g., the Tantrini, an Indian Martini).
The dining room will serve a menu created by three Indian chefs, the
foremost being Vineet Bhatia, imported from London where he runs the
elegant, Michelin-starred Zaika. Sukha Dubb (formerly executive chef
at Gaylord in L.A.) will control the day-to-day operations along with
Amar Jeet (formerly executive chef at India's Oven and sous chef at
Gaylord). The menu is very diverse. One part mixes Western and
Eastern techniques, creating a lighter, more contemporary Indian
cuisine; the other features authentic regional dishes. Tantra opens
in mid-July.</TE>
<TE>   Small Bites: Alice Waters is signing her new book, "Chez Panisse
Fruit," at Campanile July 9. The restaurant will be serving an a la
carte menu featuring items from the book. Reservations are
recommended....If your children show an interest in cooking, why not
sign them up for Granita's cooking class for kids in Malibu? There
will be five classes offered by executive chef Jennifer Naylor. All
ages are welcome, but an adult must accompany those under 8. It's $35
per class, $175 for the series ....Even though L'Orangerie is still
serving chef "Ludo" Lefebrve's menu, he says he's finally left for
good and is busy looking for investors to open his own restaurant
....That oh-so-private supper club Drake's is having a silent charity
auction and rum bash from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. Sunday. The auction will
benefit the Malibu chapter of the Surfrider Foundation, a non-profit
dedicated to protecting oceans and beaches. Attendees will bid on
one-of-a-kind plates by local Venice artists including Guy Dill,
Christina DeMusse and Tania Jacobi as they sip wacky rum libations
and snack on the decadent finger food. Tickets cost $30. For
reservations, (323) 656-2224.</TE>

<LD>LACMA's provocative Double Exposure: Photography, Film and the Cinema
series continues tonight at 7:30 in the Bing Theater with a program
of short films by famous still photographers.</LD>
<LD>   It commences with the rarely seen 15-minute "In the Street" (1948)
by Helen Levitt, Janice Loeb and James Agee. It envisions the
tenement streets of New York as a theater and a battleground wherein
everyday people, especially children, exhibit an unconscious
artistry. This exuberant film captures that artistry and celebrates
it; it's as if Levitt's photographs had come alive.</LD>
<LD>   "Pull My Daisy" (1959), a tedious 30-minute vignette, is written
and narrated by Jack Kerouac and adapted and directed by Robert Frank
and Alfred Leslie. It's set in a Bowery loft and features notables
such as poets Allen Ginsberg, Peter Orlovsky and Gregory Corso and
painters Alice Neal and Larry Rivers. Also known as "The Beat
Generation," the film plays like an inside joke but has undoubted
historical value because of the participants. William Klein's
15-minute "Broadway by Light" (1958) follows; it is a poetic homage
to Times Square's dazzling array of electric signs.</LD>
<TE>   Paul Robeson narrated but did not appear in arguably the most
important film of his career, Leo Hurwitz and Paul Strand's "Native
Land" (1942). It begins like a series of Norman Rockwell
illustrations in celebrating America as the land of life, liberty and
the pursuit of happiness only to segue deftly into a series of
stunning vignettes reenacting--in those same nostalgic settings--the
violence spawned by enemies of the labor movement. Not surprisingly,
many of the people who participated in this independent venture,
including composer Marc Blitzstein, later faced blacklisting during
the McCarthy era. The message of "Native Land" was muffled because it
had the misfortune of opening just after the bombing of Pearl Harbor.
Also screening but unavailable for preview: Bruce Weber's "Gentle
Giants" (1994).</TE>
<TE>   Two classics are scheduled for Saturday: Bert Stern's "Jazz on a
Summer Day" (1958), a splendid record of the 1958 Newport Jazz
Festival, screens at 7:30 p.m.; following will be Jean Bach's "Great
Day in Harlem" (1994), a glorious reunion and account of the lives of
the jazz artists who posed in front of a Harlem brownstone for a
famous 1958 Esquire magazine photograph. (323) 857-6010.</TE>

<TE>   MOCA's Warhol on Screen series continues Friday at 7 p.m. at the
Pacific Design Center's SilverScreen Theater with a pair of sound
two-reelers from 1965, "Camp" and "Paul Swan." The first is a talent
night at the Factory with drag queen Mario Montez performing a wobbly
"I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate" and an exuberant rumba.
That's followed by interpretative dancer Swan performing a Grecian
soldier number, complete with toga and sword, in which Baby Jane
Holzer, in tight hip-huggers, joins in; after these diverting
interludes, boredom sets in. However, because of Swan's presence,
"Camp" becomes a curtain-raiser for "Paul Swan."</TE>
<TE>   "Paul Swan" is one of the strongest of the early Warhols. It
offers a poignant portrait of a game and gallant 82-year-old
modern-dance pioneer defying the march of time to present a sample of
his repertoire that ranked him among such contemporaries as Ted Shawn
and Ruth St. Denis. It is not surprising to discover he appeared in
DeMille's first "Ten Commandments" because his exotic costumes and
stylized performance are typical of dance sequences in both DeMille
and D.W. Griffith silent spectacles. Screening Wednesday at 7 p.m. is
"Vinyl" (1965), in which pointless Factory shenanigans prove
unwatchably boring. (213) 621-1745.</TE>

<TE>   In its closing weekend, the IFP/West--Los Angeles Film Festival
offers a second chance to see some of its strongest entries. Among
them is "Ball in the House" (Directors Guild, Friday, 7 p.m.), in
which director Tanya Wexler and writer Matthew Swan tell the story of
a highly intelligent 17-year-old alcoholic (Jonathan Tucker) in a
blue-collar family. The teen possesses acerbic wit and an awareness
of the challenge of staying sober. The ensemble cast includes David
Strathairn as the youth's kind but tough-minded therapist; Jennifer
Tilly as his sexy, treacherous aunt; Dan Moran as his gruff
stepfather; and Deirdre O'Connell as his loving but ineffectual
mother.</TE>
<TE>   Less complex but equally powerful, Jacques Thelemaque's "The
Dogwalker" (DGA, Saturday, 11 a.m.) closely observes the rocky
relationship that develops between a destitute young woman (Diane
Gaidry), who has fled her abusive lover, and a reclusive,
misanthropic professional dog walker (Pamela Gordon).</TE>
<TE>   Raja Amari's "Satin Rouge" (DGA, Saturday, 4:30 p.m.) concerns the
secret sexual transgressions of a mother and daughter in defiance of
traditional conservative mores that proscribe Tunisian women's lives.
While her beloved teenage daughter (Hend El Fahem) has taken a lover,
a beautiful but dutiful young widow (Marher Kamoun) allows herself to
be drawn to a neighborhood cabaret featuring belly dancers, not
knowing it will transform her life in unexpected ways. Since Amari's
plot involves a stunning coincidence, he could have settled for
melodrama but happily sets his sights higher to achieve a witty and
mature sense of irony.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The American Cinematheque's fourth annual Mods &amp; Rockers Film
Festival opens tonight at 7:30 with the Los Angeles premiere of
Murray Lerner's "Blue Wild Angel: Jimi Hendrix Live at the Isle of
Wight." Promoters of the landmark 1970 festival allowed Lerner to
film the event, but financial and other difficulties prevented him
from completing it until 1996 as "Message to Love." Hendrix's set was
substantial and Lerner had so much backstage and other footage at his
disposal, including contemporary interviews with Hendrix's band
members and others that the result is a powerful record of the
charismatic Hendrix in full throttle, a blistering performance
pouring out raw emotion with beauty and pain in a large number of
songs. With his bravura guitar playing and dressed in bell bottoms
and colorful, flowing shirt, Hendrix cuts a timeless figure, as
indelible and enduring as his music. More concert films will be
screened along with a plethora of '60s features through July 10.
(323) 466-FILM.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Asian Film Foundation's second Midnight @ Sunset offering,
screening Saturday and Sunday at the Sunset 5, is Katsuhito Ishii's
dizzying high-style action comedy "Shark Skin Man and Peach Hip
Girl," in which a drably dressed young woman (Sie Kohinata) at last
escapes the clutches of her evil uncle, manager of a posh mountain
resort hotel, and crosses paths with a nearly naked young man
(Tadanobu Asano) running through the forest with some yakuza in hot
pursuit. Audacious, imaginative and consistently fast and funny.
(323) 848-3500.</TE>
<TE>   Note: "The Perfect You" (DGA, 7:30 tonight) is a perfectly
skippable New York romantic comedy; neurotic, talky and tedious.

<LD>When your lifelong belief in God is suddenly called into question,
it's sometimes deemed a crisis of faith. But when this happens to a
divinity student who is nearing graduation, the stakes run even
higher.</LD>
<LD>   Documentary filmmaker and minister-in-waiting Macky Alston takes
viewers on a quest for some mighty big answers tonight in
"Questioning Faith: Confessions of a Seminarian" (6:30 p.m. on
Cinemax).</LD>
<LD>   It was the death of a colleague from AIDS that sent Alston--like
his friend, a 30-something gay man--reeling into his spiritual abyss.
Feeling wounded to a depth that even he doesn't quite understand,
Alston attempts to make some sense of God's plan, or whether even
believing in a god who could take away an individual like Alan Smith
made any sense at all.</LD>
<TE>   He methodically examines the philosophies of people from all
corners to see what makes their belief systems tick: Christians,
Muslims, atheists, Jews, Buddhists, a God-fearing but strongly
believing cancer patient. Yet he always goes back to his footage of
Smith to gauge how any of the insights gleaned might reflect on the
man's life and passing.</TE>
<TE>   Alston, who won the Freedom of Expression Award at the 1997
Sundance Film Festival for his Emmy-nominated film "Family Name,"
sometimes blurs the focus with his shifts from big-picture questions
to personal relationships. But the overall effect is powerful and
resonates at a level all too rare on TV.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The acting and directing career of Ron Howard takes center stage this
week with the DVD release of his Oscar-winning "A Beautiful Mind" and
two films from the '70s he made for producer Roger Corman, "Eat My
Dust!" and "Grand Theft Auto."</LD>
<LD>   "A Beautiful Mind" won four Academy Awards in March: best film,
best director for Howard, best adapted screenplay for Akiva Goldsman
and best supporting actress for Jennifer Connelly. But it is Russell
Crowe, who won the Golden Globe and received an Oscar nomination for
best actor, who is the heart of this film. He gives a touching,
powerful performance as Nobel Prize-winning mathematician John Nash,
who spends most of his adult life battling schizophrenia.</LD>
<LD>   Universal's two-disc "Awards Edition" ($23) is available in either
a wide-screen or pan-and-scan version. The first disc features
commentary from Howard, who talks about how he decided to introduce
Nash's illusionary characters.</LD>
<TE>   Goldsman supplies an equally fascinating commentary track. Also
included on the first disc are several deleted scenes, which are all
pretty terrific. They were deleted, Howard explains, because of time
limitations and flow.</TE>
<TE>   The second disc examines the friendship and working relationship
between Howard and his producing partner, Brian Grazer, and contains
a storyboard-to-film comparison; a look at development of the
screenplay; clips of Nash receiving the Nobel Prize in Stockholm;
excerpts from one of Howard's visits with Nash, who explains to the
director his economics theory; a behind-the-scenes look at the
casting process; and a glimpse into James Horner's scoring of the
film.</TE>
<TE>   Howard the actor and novice director are on display in "The Ron
Howard Collection" from Roger Corman's New Concorde Home
Entertainment. While playing Richie Cunningham on "Happy Days,"
Howard starred in the 1976 low-budget car-chase flick "Eat My Dust!,"
which was a big hit on the drive-in circuit. Though some of the chase
sequences aren't bad, it's pretty silly. Look for Howard's brother,
Clint, and his dad, Rance, in supporting roles. A young Corbin
Bernsen is featured as a dimwitted gas station attendant. The DVD
($15) includes the trailer, talent files and a short interview with
Corman and critic Leonard Maltin.</TE>
<TE>   "Eat My Dust!" was such a hit that Corman called Howard the first
week of the film's release and asked him to do a sequel. Howard, who
had wanted to direct a feature since he was about 10, told Corman
that he would act in the sequel for the same salary and would direct
it for nothing. Corman agreed to let the then-22-year-old direct
"Grand Theft Auto." The 25th-anniversary edition of the film ($20)
includes fun commentary with Howard and Corman, a poorly shot video
interview with the two, a video interview with Corman and Maltin, the
original theatrical press kit and trailer.</TE>
<TE>   Howard also co-wrote with his father this slapstick chase film
about a young couple (Nancy Morgan and Howard) who decide to elope to
Las Vegas in her father's Rolls-Royce.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Robert Altman had his biggest hit critically and commercially in a
decade with "Gosford Park," which received seven Oscar nominations
and won for Julian Fellowes' screenplay in March. This slyly witty
look at the British class system in the early 1930s stars some of
England's greatest performers, including Maggie Smith and Helen
Mirren (who each received an Oscar nomination for supporting
actress), Kristin Scott Thomas, Michael Gambon, Derek Jacobi, Charles
Dance, Jeremy Northam and Emily Watson.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD (Universal, $27) includes a nice wide-screen transfer of
the film, deleted scenes with commentary from Altman, a fun Q&amp;A
session with Altman and several stars in March at the Academy of
Television Arts &amp; Sciences, an above-average "making of" documentary
and interviews with a butler, cook and parlor maid who were advisors
on the film. Altman supplies commentary, and though it's not listed
on the DVD, he's joined by his son, Oscar-nominated art director
Stephen Altman, and producer David Levy.</TE>
<TE>   Screenwriter Fellowes, who grew up among the British upper class,
also provides commentary.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The haunting documentary "WTC: The First 24 Hours" (Docurama, $20
for VHS or DVD) opens with an image of the north tower of the World
Trade Center on fire and ends with a view of debris-covered lower
Manhattan the next morning. Without music or commentary, "WTC"
presents raw, moving portraits of ground zero, the heroism of the
firefighters and police and the beginning of the cleanup after the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD and VHS tape each feature two versions of the documentary,
an official selection at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival--the
original 11-minute version and the final 48-minute film. The DVD also
includes a gallery of 200 images.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A&amp;E presents all 32 episodes of the 1967 animated syndicated
series "Captain Scarlet" on DVD ($80). Created by Gerry and Sylvia
Anderson of "Thunderbirds" fame, this action series also features
Anderson's trademark Supermarionation technique he introduced on
"Thunderbirds." This sci-fi thriller is set in the year 2068, when
the Earth finds itself at war with a powerful invisible race.</TE>
<TE>   The four-disc DVD set has commentary from Anderson on two
episodes, his biography, character profiles and production stills.</TE>

<LD>Messy and high-spirited, the Excalibur Children's Thea- tre
production of "Peter Pan" won't win any awards for professional
polish, but its exuberance and audience-friendliness would be hard to
match.</LD>
<LD>   In the tiny lobby outside the small theater space, upstairs from
Studio City's Sports Center, actors in costume greet the audience and
slip neckties over the heads of adults of the male gender. As the men
enter the theater and take their seats, they're fair game for
enthusiastic "Lost Boys" who confiscate the ties because there are
"no grown-ups allowed" in Never-Neverland.</LD>
<LD>   In no time, children in the audience watch the entrance and shout,
"A tie, a tie!" to the cast.</LD>
<TE>   The rowdy pre-show playfulness continues as Peter Pan (disarmingly
sincere Garry Purdy), the Lost Boys (C.J. DeAngelus, Tim Munday,
Nathan Curtis, Joseph Falstad and Jared Vandegrift) and Valley
girl-style Indian maidens (Victoria Bender, Bridget Pugliese, Paula
Savar, Jency McLane, Shartel Haywood and K.C. Franklin) talk to and
tease kids in the audience.</TE>
<TE>   Once underway, James M. Barrie's fairy tale, directed by Melissa
St. Onge, bumps along, unevenly but cheerfully, over some pop culture
references, a few undercooked musical numbers and evidence of varying
levels of acting expertise.</TE>
<TE>   Most notable are Bender's Tiger Lily, Brit Townsend's Wendy,
Matthew Artson's "Hook Junior" stooge and Mike Cahill's funny Captain
Hook. Hook's nemesis, the Crocodile (Jim Jackson in a wacky costume)
is another crowd-pleaser. He has swallowed not a clock but a boombox,
whose "funky, downtown beat" makes Hook quake.</TE>
<TE>   The young company's energy never flags. Its members leap, do back
flips and cartwheels and bounce between acting out the story and
recruiting audience participation. The building of Wendy's house with
sticks and flowers involves at least half the audience.</TE>
<TE>   St. Onge might rethink action that doesn't suit the long, narrow
Excalibur stage, however. When actors sit or lie down, they disappear
for most of the audience, and the lighting (light board operator Leah
King is credited) could be considerably improved. But Bev Wiest's
loosely matched costumes are of the friendly,
let's-see-what's-in-the-trunk variety, and scenic artist John Wan's
multicolored abstract designs for Never-Neverland and Hook's simple
rowboat are a pleasant surprise.</TE>
<TE>   "Peter Pan," Excalibur Theatre, Sports Center, upstairs, 12655
Ventura Blvd., Studio City. Sundays, 1 and 3 p.m., through July 7.
Adults, $10; children, $8. (818) 761-8804. Running time: 1 hour, 10
minutes.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bucking trends came naturally for the late Joyce Treiman, an artist
who spent much of her life in Los Angeles and whose show of drawings
and prints has landed with a generous splash in the Carnegie Art
Museum in Oxnard.</LD>
<LD>   Through the '60s until her death from cancer in 1991, she
defiantly honed her work in a figurative mode while those around her
were flirting with assorted ideas about abstraction and
conceptualism.</LD>
<LD>   She also put earnest effort into her drawing, viewing it as much
more than just a preliminary warmup to the act of painting. Wandering
through this subtle and wonder-filled traveling exhibition, which
fills the Carnegie's gallery spaces and is headed for other venues,
one becomes a believer. What's on view is Treiman's insightful skill
and also a boon to the world of drawing well-done.</LD>
<TE>   Treiman wasn't self-conscious about putting herself squarely in
the middle of her art, sometimes with a whimsical tilt toward art
history, as with the pencil-on-paper "Study for Turner and Me," a
seaside two-shot of herself and the famed 19th century British
seascape painter J.M. Turner.</TE>
<TE>   One room in the museum is given over to a portfolio of lithographs
called "Mirrored Couple." We follow a couple recognizable as the
artist and her husband through a series of views and increasingly
abstract inventions. It plays like an essay on the dualities and
vicissitudes of couple-hood.</TE>
<TE>   Amid several self-portraits are small portraits of artists of
historical import she admired and also those she knew, including
Winslow Homer, Thomas Eakins and respected film editor Walter Murch.</TE>
<TE>   The most powerful image in the show is "Incident 1," sparked
partly by its sense of both ambiguity and alarm. A woman--another of
Treiman's self-portraits--stands in her pajamas, howling through
cupped hands, standing in splattered blood that mirrors the color of
her hair. A corpse on a stretcher passes behind her; two suspicious
characters hover before her. That this piece was created around the
same time Treiman learned she had lung cancer adds personal
poignancy.</TE>
<TE>   Head upstairs, though, and note how the artist channeled her sense
of physical frailty and mortality through filters of humor and
mythos. Her "joker" drawings are lean, with sparse bursts of imagery
among mysterious cushions of white space. This spacious scheme gives
emphasis to her drawings of jokers, monks, wrestlers and other
figures, which appear as pranksters imbued with mystical power, like
not-so-grim reapers.</TE>
<TE>   In her last several years, she used art to come to grips with the
inevitable, with integrity and her wit intact.</TE>

<DH>Ten 'Women of Enron' find a temp job posing for a pictorial
in Playboy</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK--Carey Lorenzo was just a few weeks into her new job at
Enron Corp. last fall when she started getting signals that job
security might be an issue.</LD>
<LD>   Working out of a 20-person office in the landmark Chrysler
Building, Lorenzo, 31, sold electricity in the state's newly
deregulated energy market. Although she usually could offer small
businesses a cheaper deal than they were getting from old-line
utility Consolidated Edison, some customers balked at signing four-
and seven-year contracts with a company that looked like it might not
survive that long.</LD>
<LD>   "Enron? No way!" Lorenzo recalled one businessman telling her. "Do
you watch the news, honey?"</LD>
<TE>   Lorenzo, whose job evaporated when the scandal-ridden energy
company declared bankruptcy Dec. 2, has no regrets about her
two-month fling with energy deregulation. After all, it gave the New
Jersey native her shot at celebrity: She is one of 10 Enronites
chosen to pose naked for Playboy's "Women of Enron" issue, hitting
the stands Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The women, including Maya Arthur of Tehachapi, were selected from
more than 300 current and former Enron employees who sent in photos
after Playboy announced in March plans for the pictorial. Playgirl
magazine has already published its own peekaboo feature on Enron men.</TE>
<TE>   Lorenzo and two fellow posers, who made TV appearances Wednesday,
will also be on Wall Street today for a press conference and
autograph session playing on Enron's notoriety as a stock-market
fallen angel.</TE>
<TE>   One of them, Cynthia Coghlan, 28, had a four-month stint in an
Enron unit in Toronto. After the U.S. bankruptcy filing, however,
Canadian workers were in limbo awaiting a court ruling on whether
their division could operate independently. The answer was no.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't really do any work," Coghlan recalled during an
interview this week at Playboy's 5th Avenue offices overlooking
Central Park. "We sat around playing euchre tournaments in the board
room."</TE>
<TE>   For Oregonian Christine Nielsen, the August issue's cover girl,
the Playboy promotional tour is her first visit to New York. Like
Coghlan and Lorenzo, she said she's had only positive feedback about
Playboy from her former co-workers at Enron. "They just laugh when
they hear about it."</TE>
<TE>   Nielsen, 28, said she could see cracks in the Enron facade well
before Wall Street did. The project manager at Portland-based Enron
Broadband and hundreds of co-workers were laid off in May 2001,
months before the parent company started unraveling amid allegations
of document-shredding and accounting fraud.</TE>
<TE>   "Business was drying up," Nielsen said. "Everybody saw the writing
on the wall."</TE>
<TE>   But a year earlier, while broadband was still flying high, she met
and was impressed by Enron's then-chairman Kenneth L. Lay and
then-president Jeffrey K. Skilling when the two visited Portland for
conferences.</TE>
<TE>   The macho reputation established by Enron's aggressive Houston
trading operation also permeated Portland, Nielsen said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very masculine, tough, go-get-'em atmosphere, definitely
not nurturing," she said. Still, "I never felt like if I came up with
a great idea, as a woman I'd be discouraged from running with it,"
she added.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's collapse taught Nielsen a lesson about corporate America,
she said: "Buyer beware."</TE>
<TE>   In two years on the job, she had built a sizable nest egg of Enron
stock options, which became worthless when the company went bankrupt.
It was worse for her father, a retired letter carrier in Portland who
invested "a good chunk" of his retirement savings in Enron stock.</TE>
<TE>   Nielsen, who holds an environmental science degree from the
University of Oregon, is heading back to school to train as a midwife
so she can "use my skills as a nurturing person," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the new Playboy models have lost jobs, money or both in
Enron's collapse, yet there is surprisingly little bitterness among
them. Arthur, 29, the lone Southern Californian among the 10, said in
a telephone interview that her three years at Tehachapi-based Enron
Wind were overwhelmingly positive.</TE>
<TE>   Payback played no part in motivating Arthur, who is married and
the mother of a 4-year-old, to try out for the Playboy pictorial, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   When a friend e-mailed her about the upcoming issue, her first
reaction was, "No way. Just the thought of being nude in front of
strangers was scary."</TE>
<TE>   But finally, encouraged by friends and her husband, she decided
that she would kick herself later if she let the opportunity pass.
The night before the shooting, "I got maybe an hour's sleep," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Playboy nor the Enron models would discuss the modeling
fee paid for the photo session, but Lorenzo said it was more than
enough to cover the rent this summer on her apartment in Manhattan's
trendy Gramercy Park area.</TE>
<TE>   If Enron was accused of using accounting tricks to inflate
profits, Playboy, in catering to sexual fantasies, is also capable of
rounding up to a higher number.</TE>
<TE>   Lorenzo's figure isn't as over-the-top as that of a typical
Playboy centerfold, so she borrowed a padded bra to wear under a
tightfitting T-shirt for an Entertainment Tonight taping Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "Thanks for the boobs," she said, laughing as she returned the
garment afterward.</TE>

<LD>I wandered back to our utility room the other night to feed the cats
and was confronted by an animal scratching at a wastebasket in a far
corner.</LD>
<LD>   I couldn't see what it was, but instinct told me it wasn't one of
ours. When Cat One and Cat Two enter the room, they do so with
intense caution and hesitancy and are rarely waiting for me when I
arrive. They are more shadow than substance.</LD>
<LD>   We live in wild L.A., and animal intrusions are not uncommon. The
utility room is left open to the outside until the cats come in, at
which time the door is closed to protect the little dears from
night-hunting predators.</LD>
<TE>   Anything could come waltzing in, from raccoons to unregenerated
hippies still existing on beer and cat food.</TE>
<TE>   When I heard the scratching at the wastebasket, I instantly shut
the door that leads from the room into the main house to protect
myself from the unknown, the way screaming women hid from werewolves
in those old Lon Chaney Jr. movies.</TE>
<TE>   I yelled at my wife, "There's an animal in the utility room!"</TE>
<TE>   It's on Page 361, Section 42, of the Funk &amp; Wagnalls Manual for
Husbands, to wit: "When danger threatens, holler for your woman, then
push her in front of you."</TE>
<TE>   "That's what cats are," she said, "animals. Feed them."</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't a cat animal."</TE>
<TE>   "Well, you were a Marine. Flush it out!"</TE>
<TE>   Flushing out was never a part of my training. A drill instructor
simplified our goals in perilous situations by saying, "If it moves,
shoot it."</TE>
<TE>   I don't have a gun, but I do have a ceremonial sword given to me
by a friend from Kuwait. The same D.I. pointed out in his own
primitive way that sticking an enemy with a bayonet was almost as
much fun as shooting it.</TE>
<TE>   While I saw little amusement using a sword to do in a small
animal, I was not about to turn my house over to it.</TE>
<TE>   I felt like a character out of an Alexandre Dumas epic as, cutlass
in hand, I opened the door to the utility room and turned on the
light. Staring at me from inside a wooden recycling box was an animal
with a long, pointed nose.</TE>
<TE>   For a moment, I thought it was an oversized rat, but then I
realized it was a possum.</TE>
<TE>   In the few seconds that we stared at each other, the question
arose in my mind: Do I have the raw Marine devotion to duty that
would allow me to stick a possum? I pictured the D.I., a sergeant
with the attitude of a serial killer, and knew he'd track me down if
I didn't stick the possum.</TE>
<TE>   I wavered.</TE>
<TE>   "What's going on back there?"</TE>
<TE>   I could hear Cinelli coming down the hall. I closed the door.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a possum," I said.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, that's cute. Oops, shouldn't have said that. I know how much
you hate cute."</TE>
<TE>   She opened the door to peek in. "There's nothing there."</TE>
<TE>   "It's in the recycling box."</TE>
<TE>   She went in. "There's nothing in the box."</TE>
<TE>   A closer look revealed that items had been knocked down from
shelves below a makeshift attic. It's where we store stuff we don't
want but can't bear to throw away. A sort of halfway house for junk.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't take Charlie Chan to figure out that the possum had gone
into the attic for safety and was tucked among those things.</TE>
<TE>   Cinelli looked upward and shook her head. "You got a big problem
there, Mac," she said, and left me standing with a sword in hand and
a cute thing in the attic.</TE>
<TE>   I put the dog Barkley into the room for about 20 minutes, assuming
that as a springer spaniel, he was probably an instinctive flusher.
But when I opened the door, I found he'd eaten the cats' food and
gone to sleep on their blanket. So much for man's best friend as a
possum hunter.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving messages for people I thought might know possums, I
received a return call from David Diliberto, director of field
operations for the city's Department of Animal Services. He said not
to worry, possums might hiss and drool as a warning, but most of the
time they'll either run away or, well, play possum.</TE>
<TE>   He did warn, however, that they have more teeth than any other
North American mammal and they're needle sharp. Grabbing at them, he
said, might not be a good idea, adding, "Sprinkle a little flour by
the door and you can tell by the footprints if your possum has left."
If ever.</TE>
<TE>   An Internet Web site suggested that I could locate the beast by
its scent and then trap it. I asked Cinelli how she thought a possum
might smell, and she mentioned the odor of a drinking friend of mine
in Oakland named Freddie, who was known not to bathe frequently. I
ignored her comparison. The guy may have been a little gamy, but I
don't think he smelled like a possum.</TE>
<TE>   I found nothing of value online regarding possum nuisances until I
hit upon a Web page called "The Possum Cookbook." Here were recipes
for possum kabob, possum pot pie, possum stew and so on. Possum
creole appealed to me the most, but in order to obtain the possum
chunks required, one had to have the possum first, which I didn't
have.</TE>
<TE>   "You harm that animal," Cinelli warned, "and I turn you in for the
reward."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, I didn't do anything but sprinkle flour by the door.
The possum, sensing my hostility, wandered off on his own, leaving
his little rat prints behind. I was glad to be rid of him, but I
couldn't help wondering how a possum tasted.</TE>
<TE>   If he smelled anything like Freddie, I probably wouldn't have
eaten him anyhow.</TE>

<TE>   The word "Provence" is laden with mystique. In culinary terms, the
word conjures up fare made with robust mixtures of olive oil, capers,
garlic and lamb, and writers like M.F.K. Fisher and Peter Mayle have
taken any number of armchair travelers on gastronomic tours of this
picturesque region in the south of France.</TE>
<TE>   But there is another aspect to the south of France, often
overlooked, yet just as tied to the tastes of the tongue: an archaic,
extraordinary language in which medieval troubadours sang their songs
of love. The language is all but extinct, and if one could hear it
spoken today, it might sound as alien as Chaucer's English does to
modern ears.</TE>
<TE>   Extinct though it may be, the language and poetry of Provence and
the surrounding lands have mingled, like a scent of wild dill, with
the life of W.S. Merwin, one of the finest lyrical poets writing
today.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Mays of Ventadorn," Merwin pays lavish tribute to the 12th
century troubadours and the regions that have meant so much to him
during his career, starting with that day in the 1950s when he
visited the poet Ezra Pound.</TE>
<TE>   " ... [A]t your age you don't have anything to write about. You
may think you do, but you don't," Pound told the 19-year-old Merwin
at St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington, D.C., where Pound was
confined after World War II. "So get to work translating .... Try to
learn the Provencal, at least some of it, if you can .... Get as
close to the original as you can. It will make you use your English
and find out what you can do with it."</TE>
<TE>   Another poet who inspired Merwin was Dante, whose homage to the
troubadours in the 26th canto of "Purgatorio" made Merwin "want to
try again to hear something of the troubadours' brief, bright sense
of the world."</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who knows Merwin's poetry or his memoir, "The Lost Upland,"
knows how intimate he is with the world of nature, how he places
himself in sensuous and direct contact with it.</TE>
<TE>   And so, with the words of Pound and Dante in his ears, the young
Merwin traveled, maps in hand, to the region known as the Quercy,
talking to villagers and combing the countryside for ruins and old
farmhouses. It became "a continuing treasure hunt, finding them,
trying to learn something of their current status .... But I could
scarcely imagine having one of them and living in it."</TE>
<TE>   Soon, however, he became the owner of a farmhouse "half-buried in
brambles"--thanks to a small inheritance left by a great-aunt. Over
the years, it becomes a refuge, a haven from the rest of the world,
even as that world encroached on the Quercy in the forms of
modernization and tourism.</TE>
<TE>   The "brief, bright" world of the troubadours, as Merwin comes to
understand it, exuded a force that appeals still today. They were the
rock stars of feudal courts; in song they bared their souls to
swooning duchesses betrothed to kings. Isolated from their loves,
they were defiant, roguish, yet mournful, and seething with desire.</TE>
<TE>   Their poetry blended eroticism with coded references to court
gossip and the hawthorn, also known as the mayflower or mays, which
the troubadours used as a symbol of love before the rose took its
place. "The way this love of ours goes on," writes the supreme
troubadour Bernart de Ventadorn, whom Merwin deeply admires, "is like
the branch of the hawthorn/that keeps trembling upon the tree .... "</TE>
<TE>   Merwin traces Bernart's elusive life, hunting for the truths among
the legends, speculating on his long romance with Eleanor of
Aquitaine, who would marry the French King Louis VII and then the
cruel Henry II of England. It is perhaps about her, Merwin suggests,
that Bernart wrote:</TE>
<TE>   Oh what is my life to me</TE>
<TE>   Unless every day I see</TE>
<TE>   My own true joy</TE>
<TE>   In bed or from the window</TE>
<TE>   Even in translation, one sees the simple clarity that Merwin
admires. And, as he also points out, the mixture of "sensuality and
sublimation" one finds here, and elsewhere in troubadour poetry, is
perhaps what led to its demise, discouraged and smothered by the
Inquisition as well as by continuing turmoil among the warring
nobles.</TE>
<TE>   Merwin's prose is vivid and spare, like his poetry, and his method
of plunging into the life of Bernart ripples outward like a stone
tossed in a pond, touching on larger historical and social contexts.
He moves easily among the stories of Bernart and his unfulfilled
longings; those of romantic figures like Richard the Lion-Hearted;
childhood memories of his own stern father who was an Army chaplain;
and the pastoral way of life that he knew was ending with the deaths
of old friends in his village.</TE>
<TE>   "The Mays of Ventadorn" is elegiac, written by the light of a
setting sun. Though only fragments remain to give us a glimpse of the
troubadours' world, Merwin makes us grateful that we have them.</TE>

<LD>H.C. Westermann</LD>
<LD>   As a boy growing up in Los Angeles, Horace Clifford (Cliff)
Westermann had an amazing childhood. He built carts, scooters and
airplanes. When he was a teenager, in order to have his own room, he
built an addition to his parents' home out of scrap wood. He
submitted drawings of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to the Disney
Studios, and Disney offered him a job, only to take back the offer
when they found out how young he was. During World War II he served
in the U.S. Marine Corps on the aircraft carrier Enterprise. Later he
fought in the Korean War, then toured the country as an acrobat! In
addition, he created imaginative, humorous and thoughtful sculptures.</LD>
<LD>   Westermann called this sculpture "Memorial to the Idea of Man if
He Was an Idea." Although Westermann claimed that this sculpture was
not about him, there are some similarities. The tattoo on this
memorial is the same tattoo that Westermann had on his arm. Inside
the cabinet he spelled "HC W" in bottle caps, an acrobat is one of
the two toys inside the cabinet and a sinking battleship is on the
bottom shelf.</LD>
<TE>   Westermann's sculptures and selected drawings are currently on
view at MOCA at the Geffen Contemporary, 152 N. Central Ave. in
Little Tokyo. You can see his humanoid sculptures, boxes, houses,
boats, machines and tableaux, or scenes. H.C. Westermann Robot
Workshops for children ages 9 to 14 start on July 13 and continue for
the next five Saturdays. For registration information, call (213)
621-1751 or visit www.moca.org.</TE>

<DH>Have You Ever Been Teased?</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Students at Warner Avenue Elementary in Los Angeles have been teased,
and this is what they have to say about it.</LD>
<LD>   * I have been teased by one of my friends a lot. She said that I
was fat and I was dumb. I handled it by talking to my mom and she
said she would talk to the teacher. I felt better after we had a
talk. (Janis, 9)</LD>
<LD>   * I have been teased. Ivan called me "little nose." I handled it
by saying, "Ivan, can you please not say that?" But Ivan would not
stop, so I told the teacher and he never did it again. (Morgan, 10)</LD>
<TE>   * My friend teases me. He says that I'm bad at Capture the Flag
and he is good. The way I handled it was by just walking away. I know
he felt bad inside. It ended up that he apologized to me and we made
up. (Austin, 10)</TE>
<TE>   * Yes, I'm teased ... a lot, mostly by my sister, but also other
people. I live with it, but it hurts. They say all kinds of things. I
usually tease them back or walk away. It's very hurtful. I don't like
it at all. I hope it stops. (Adam, 10)</TE>
<TE>   Students at Hope View Elementary in Huntington Beach have been
teased, too. Here's how they handled it.</TE>
<TE>   * I know what it is like being teased. If you are teased you
should ignore the teaser and not let him or her get to you. (Wesley)</TE>
<TE>   * A kid at school says "shut up" and "dork" every time he sees me.
I don't say anything and I just walk away. (Cameron, 8)</TE>
<TE>   * This boy called me "Miss Waylor" instead of "Miss Taylor." I
walked away and I didn't talk to him. I've bumped into him on the
playground once but I ignored him. (Melissa)</TE>

<HD>You Make Great Stuff, Martha, and That Counts for a Lot</HD>
<DH>In Kmart's aisles, the siren song of your linens and lint
rollers drowns out those pesky news reports</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEANNINE STEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dear Martha:</LD>
<LD>   We're so sorry to hear about all the trouble you're having with
that nasty insider trading scandal--oops, alleged insider trading
scandal--involving those ImClone stocks. You must be biting those
neatly manicured nails down to the cuticle worrying about what that
congressional committee is up to, not to mention the mess with your
hunky Merrill Lynch broker being put on paid leave. And then there's
your tanking Martha Stewart Omnimedia stock--ouch!</LD>
<LD>   But we've got good news, Martha! Some Kmart shoppers who are
buying your products or even considering buying your products don't
really give a rat's behind what you did! Some don't even know a thing
about the scandal! And get this--some people don't even know who you
are!</LD>
<TE>   Like David, the CPA from Redondo Beach who was checking out your
curtains at the Big Kmart in Torrance. Well, he sort of knew who you
are, even though he didn't even realize he was looking at your
curtains. He described you as "some kind of designer for housewives,"
which doesn't really do justice to the complexity of you and your
mega-empire. Being a CPA he sure heard about your woes, but don't
worry--he's on your side!</TE>
<TE>   "Her broker probably told her to sell and she sold," he said. "How
much money did she make--$200,000? That's not enough to worry about.
Why would she do it? If there's anything to this, it's political."</TE>
<TE>   Dave has a point, you know. Two hundred thousand dollars--you
probably blow your nose on that!</TE>
<TE>   Cathy Burgos, a 34-year-old mom from Long Beach (who owns one of
your garbage cans) hasn't even been paying attention to what's been
going on with you. As she was strolling your bath and bedding aisles
at the Super Kmart in Long Beach with her two kids she said, "If it's
not on Cartoon Network, I don't know about it."</TE>
<TE>   She wasn't the only one. Sheronda Walker, a 31-year-old temp from
Long Beach who was cruising comforters, said she had "no idea" what
you were up to. "I don't watch TV," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Isn't that amazing? Especially considering that at the checkout
stand there was that Globe tabloid with the screaming headline,
"MARTHA STEWART JAILBIRD? Will She End Up Decorating a Prison Cell
... The Full Shocking Story."</TE>
<TE>   But even people who have heard of you and the insider trading
thingy don't seem that upset, and some even said they'll keep buying
your products no matter what happens.</TE>
<TE>   "If she's selling hangers and I need hangers I'm going to buy
them," said Victor Smith, a 40-year-old man from Lynwood who works
for Toyota. "I'm sure she has some very loyal customers who might
feel a little let down [by the insider trading scandal], but it
wouldn't affect me."</TE>
<TE>   He was busy looking at your hangers and shoe trees at the Super
Kmart in Carson and even though he admitted that he doesn't really
seek out your products, he did watch one of your cooking segments on
TV because whatever you were making looked pretty good.</TE>
<TE>   "Personally she might be a monster, but it doesn't affect whether
she has good products or good ideas," said Mary Perl, a 60-year-old
entertainment manager from Rancho Palos Verdes who was considering
some poly/cotton sheets at the Torrance Big Kmart.</TE>
<TE>   Mary, who's bought your linens before but admits she "doesn't feel
one way or the other" about you, waxed a little philosophical when we
asked if she'd keep buying your stuff even if they cart you off to
the pokey: "It sounds awful," she said, "but there are so many people
who are corrupt and don't get caught. I don't think two million
wrongs make a right, but it's just a fact of life that corruption is
all over the place. It's too bad, but it's the way our society runs.
And if I thought that by not spending $50 on sheets it would have
some social significance I wouldn't, but whatever I do will have no
significance whatsoever."</TE>
<TE>   Whoa. That was pretty heavy stuff to ponder, so we decided to take
a little walk and clear our head. Know what we discovered? You are
all over that store, Martha! They should change the name to Martha
Mart! The bed linens and towels we knew about, but the rest--geez!
Clocks and dishes and shower curtains and utility drawer organizers
and pots and pans and little corn on the cob holders and frames and
hanging moth cakes and meat thermometers and candles and
candleholders and label makers and plastic storage tubs and
toothbrush holders and even a lint picker-upper! Whew!</TE>
<TE>   By the way, thanks for taking the time to put that lint trivia on
the lint roller wrapper. We never knew that "lint" refers not only to
"tiny fibers, ravelings and remnants from yarn and fabrics," but it's
also what raw cotton is called when it's just gone through a gin. You
are too much!</TE>
<TE>   While we were wandering we ran into Janet Hagopian, a 45-year-old
woman from Torrance who works for the South Bay Civic Light Opera.
Her cart was practically stuffed with your curtains, and she's been
very pleased with the comforters she's bought in the past.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the quality is good," she said, "and I think the products
are a fair price." But more than that, Martha, she thinks you've
helped a lot of people "in terms of showing them what you can do with
different things. She's helped me a little bit with decorating and
showing how you can use your creativity." Janet really hopes you
don't lose your show or stop making all your stuff, and she's going
to keep buying regardless: "I guess I feel [the insider trading
situation] should be kept separate from her products," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But, Martha, you probably know that there are going to be some
people out there for whom your conduct does make a difference. Debbie
Resch, a 43-year-old office manager from Gardena who's bought your
products before and has watched your shows and read your magazine,
was giving your kitchen towels a once-over at the Super Kmart in
Carson and said that although she hasn't heard much about the scandal
she'd think twice if you were found guilty.</TE>
<TE>   "My history has always been one of high moral standards," she
said, "and if she was found guilty I probably would not end up buying
her products again."</TE>
<TE>   Well, there you have it, Martha. We hope you sleep a little better
tonight knowing that, for the moment at least, those hanging moth
cakes will continue to sell.</TE>

<HD>New Shelf Life for Pools</HD>
<DH>Never mind swimming. The latest in pools is a ledge just
for lounging.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET EASTMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Life has taken on a shallowness that suits Mary Kay Jordan just fine.
Sunk in a low-slung beach chair, knee-deep in water, she watches over
her world with languid blue ripples reflecting in her sunglasses.</LD>
<LD>   "Sometimes nothing is going through my mind," whispers Jordan,
iced tea and an unopened Tom Clancy thriller within reach, "when I'm
sitting on my Baja step."</LD>
<LD>   The self-employed bookkeeper and mother of three isn't vacationing
at a Mexican resort but chilling in her Carlsbad backyard pool,
taking full advantage of its first step, which is really a shelf as
wide and long as an oversized beach towel. It is the ultimate pool:
You can go in the water ... and yet stay dry. Well, almost.</LD>
<TE>   A third of the in-ground pools made by California's largest
builders this year will have such a shelf, an entry area that's about
a foot deep and as broad as the homeowner's imagination. There are as
many names for them as there are uses: tanning bench, kiddie play
platform, grandparents' step, thermal ledge, Shamu shelf (picture
SeaWorld's killer whale belly-up in shallow water).</TE>
<TE>   But the idea is the same: In pools, there's a lot less swimming
and a lot more lounging going on.</TE>
<TE>   It's all part of the trend of transforming ever smaller backyards
into social oases "where people can group together as families and
neighbors," says Bil Kennedy of P.K. Data, an Atlanta-based market
research firm that has been tracking the swimming pool industry for a
decade.</TE>
<TE>   And shallow waters make that possible, whereas deep ends are empty
space, says Brian Van Bower of Aquatic Consultants in Miami. "With
deeper pools you have a whole section that you can only swim or float
through, but you can't stand around and have fun."</TE>
<TE>   To create an oasis, more often the distinction between home and
backyard is blurred. The old-fashioned pool entry with three little
steps clustered in one corner compared with an expanded entry is
"like the difference between having a skinny front door and an
inviting large one," says Skip Phillips of Questar Pools and Spas in
Escondido.</TE>
<TE>   And builders such as Frank Berry of Southwinds Landscaping in
Irvine have been scrambling to keep up with demand for counters,
stools and even speakers in pools.</TE>
<TE>   To add more of the feeling of a resort, some owners are having
holes carved into the concrete steps to hold umbrellas, which shade
waders during the day and can also be used as tiki torch holders at
night, creating a dramatic reflection of fire on water.</TE>
<TE>   Questar client Marilee Breeding of Fallbrook says her shallow area
is more like a reflecting pool. "We had our daughter's wedding
reception at the house and the photographer took photos with the
water in the foreground."</TE>
<TE>   The Next Wave</TE>
<TE>   Pool styles come in waves. Few people long for the big blue
rectangular tanks of the past. Instead they want pools that are pond-
or lagoon-like in finish and shape. And ones without a deep end.</TE>
<TE>   A typical new pool might be 3  1/2 feet in depth on each end and
deeper in the center--but only by another foot or so.</TE>
<TE>   It's a good setup for volleyball or water basketball, not so good
for swimming laps: Flip turns require 4 feet of water.</TE>
<TE>   "There are people who are serious about swimming as an exercise,
and they have lap pools, but that's not us," says homeowner Kristine
Quart of Encinitas. "It's our social center."</TE>
<TE>   Daughter Gabrielle, 13, turns up the outdoor stereo and stages
shows on the same ankle-deep shelf--which is also the space the
family's German shepherd chooses to take his naps. "My husband,
Barry, keeps saying, 'Why should I go on vacation when I can enjoy my
backyard this much?' " says Quart.</TE>
<TE>   A shelf costs less than most weekend getaways when designed into a
new pool; adding one to an existing pool runs a few thousand dollars
more. The average price of a new pool is around $35,000, according to
the Virginia-based National Spa &amp; Pool Institute.</TE>
<TE>   California Pools charged the Jordans $350 for their 4-by-6-foot
shelf when it was wrapped into the cost of their new $37,500 pool.
Jordan figures that they spent about 1% of their budget on the corner
of the pool they use almost 100% of the time.</TE>
<TE>   The two preschoolers in the family see it as a wading pond; the
teenager leans against it when he's standing chest-deep on the main
pool floor (the pool at its deepest is only 4 feet); the grandmother,
age 80, uses it to maintain her balance as she dips into the pool. As
for Jordan and her husband, Robert, well, they enjoy lounging there
when they get a free moment.</TE>
<TE>   There's another benefit: The bigger step and shallower pool cut
maintenance costs. Less water has to be treated and cared for, says
Bruce Conn of California Pools. And, he adds, it acts as a solar
collector, reducing heating costs.</TE>
<TE>   Re-creating a Honeymoon</TE>
<TE>   Saving memories--not money--was Sarah Winkler's incentive for
having a shelf take up one-fifth of her pool in San Clemente.</TE>
<TE>   Winkler and husband Troy spent their honeymoon in the shallow end
of a Cancun pool. "It was a hot July, and we'd sit all day in lounge
chairs in a few inches of water, which kept us at a constant
temperature so we didn't have to dunk into the pool every five
minutes to cool off," says Winkler.</TE>
<TE>   When the couple went searching for a builder to create a
mini-version for their backyard last year, they found James Long of
Mission Valley Pools &amp; Spas in Lake Forest, who for years has been
designing what he calls a "Baja reef"--so named, he says, because,
like the California coast, it starts out shallow, then drops deep.</TE>
<TE>   Katie Parks and Peggy Chambers of Long Beach worked with Long to
create a knee-deep bench in their pool for a physical therapist to
use when working with their son, Akio, 14, who has a spinal injury
and Down syndrome. Parks was surprised to find, however, that
everyone gravitates to Akio's space. "Little kids in life jackets
feel safe there, and four adults can sit and talk to people who are
in or out of the pool."</TE>
<TE>   Joe and Shelly Kaufmann of Mission Viejo, also Long's clients,
retreat to their walled-off shelf when kids' play gets to be too
much. "When our children are jumping and having water-gun fights in
the deep end, we can stay out of their way," says Shelly.</TE>
<TE>   Getting wet and staying wet is the whole point over at Mark
Abbott's place in San Clemente. Abbott surfs every day, usually at
nearby Trestles Beach, and when he gets home he heads for the pool,
often with friends. He sees his longboard-size landing as the first
step to bliss.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a shallow sandbar you see in the Caribbean," he says.
"Sometimes we wrap inflated travel pillows around our necks, lie down
in the foot-deep water and just completely let go."</TE>

<HD>Think Outside the Envelope</HD>
<DH>That's what postal service did to come up with 20 images
for stamps saluting U.S. and photographic history</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEANNINE STEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The task seemed incredibly daunting: Condense 130 years of
outstanding American photography to 20 images that convey both the
artistic and journalistic aspects of the medium, shrink them to an
inch-and-a-half by an inch, put them all on one page and hope they
sell.</LD>
<LD>   That's what the U.S. Postal Service has done with its new stamp
series, "Masters of American Photography," an arresting display of 20
black-and-white photographs that includes Civil War soldiers by
Timothy O'Sullivan, an Andre Kertesz cityscape, an Edward Steichen
image of a lotus and a Garry Winogrand street scene.</LD>
<LD>   The finely reproduced images chronicle not only the history of
photography, but the history of the country, with compelling images
of war, the Depression and westward expansion. Though past stamps
have recognized the medium of photography or individual
photographers, this is the post office's first true celebration of
American photography. The plate, which debuts at the new stamp price
of 37 cents (the rate takes effect Sunday), has been generating buzz
since its release earlier this month.</LD>
<TE>   "I think it's wonderful," said Weston Naef, curator of photographs
for the J. Paul Getty Museum. "These images are both classic on one
hand and adventuresome on the other. It's obvious that this selection
was not based on some capricious decision, but was very carefully
chosen."</TE>
<TE>   Guiding the selection was Peter Bunnell, McAlpin professor
emeritus of the history of photography at Princeton University and
former curator of photography at the Museum of Modern Art in New
York, who is considered the country's leading scholar of American
photography. As the stamps have slipped into circulation, Bunnell has
been pleasantly surprised at the reactions. Some fans have asked him
to autograph the sheet, and a woman stopped him in the supermarket to
tell him she was "overwhelmed and fascinated" with the images.</TE>
<TE>   "You can publish all the magazines and books in the world, but you
probably aren't going to reach millions of people with this kind of
authoritative pronouncement," Bunnell said from his home in New
Jersey. "Presumably this might have some effect on a lay public that
never thought about photography. Also, in an era when everything is
in color, this reminds you that the first visual images were black
and white, which is a truly abstract form."</TE>
<TE>   Although these tiny images will only live a short time on pieces
of mail, Naef believes their impact will loom large: "From that
picture of Daniel Webster to those that chronicle the expansion of
the West, the art of photography and the destiny of America overlaps
in a cultural and political way more here than any other place on
Earth."</TE>
<TE>   As with all postage stamps, the road from concept to sticky-back
stamp sheet was a long one. Bunnell said he was tapped in 1996 to
work on the set, part of a series that included American artists and
illustrators. "I used monographs," he explained, "to stimulate my
thoughts and move beyond the most obvious images" that still
represented the photographers' work.</TE>
<TE>   He wanted the final slate of images to "not be perceived as simply
art photography, but to convey how they work journalistically, as
documentation. We were interested in photography in the context of
history. That's why we went with Eugene Smith's picture from World
War II, and Walker Evans' imagery of the Depression."</TE>
<TE>   There are other artful visions of the past as well. The works
range from James VanDerZee's "My Corsage" to a Man Ray abstract
rayograph(a contact print), from Ansel Adams' "Sand Dunes, Sunrise"
and Edward Weston's "Two Shells" to an intimate portrait of author
Agnes Rand Lee and her daughter Peggy, titled "Blessed Art Thou Among
Women," by Gertrude Kasebier.</TE>
<TE>   As if summing up the history of American photography in 20 frames
weren't difficult enough, Bunnell made his job even tougher by
setting tight parameters for what he wanted in the final mix: male
and female photographers; a representation of various regions of the
country; a mix of portraits, landscapes and still-lifes; and
photographers who made "important contributions as picture makers,
not necessarily as people who were involved in photography." That's
why noted Civil War photographer Mathew Brady was dropped in favor of
a daguerreotype by Southworth and Hawes from the same era. Bunnell
felt Brady was more significant as an entrepreneur who hired others
to shoot.</TE>
<TE>   As he moved to more modern times, he also had to observe the
unbendable postal rule about commemorating only those who had been
dead at least 10 years. There were also pragmatic considerations.
Some estates and heirs denied permission to use works. Certain shots
turned to indecipherable mush when shrunk, and others didn't fit into
the vertical format.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the problem of arranging the images chronologically
and harmoniously on the sheet. "If you shifted one photograph with
another, they affected each other," said Derry Noyes, the graphic
designer and art director who worked closely with Bunnell. "I put a
white border around the images because I wanted them to feel like
little pictures within a frame, and I didn't want them to compete
with each other."</TE>
<TE>   Noyes chose a "quiet, understated" font for the photographers'
names and the denomination, then placed them on the stamps as
unobtrusively as possible.</TE>
<TE>   She selected one additional image, attributed to William Henry
Jackson, that complements the rest. It appears in the "selvage," an
area to the right of the stamps, and shows a photographer with a
sizable camera positioned precariously on Overhanging Rock above
Yosemite Valley. The photo, Noyes said, shows not only "the master at
his art," but also reveals the lengths photographers went to to
obtain their images.</TE>
<TE>   She, too, is hopeful that the sheet will spark interest in
outstanding American photography: "It's great," she said, "that the
old masters are starting to get appreciated."</TE>

in Monroe High's auditorium for her big sister's graduation ceremony.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Grandpa has brought tiny binoculars, and he lets me borrow them and
watch the graduates. I can't see their faces, but they're sitting
very still and serious, not horsing around the way they'd do on an
ordinary day.</LD>
<LD>   There are all kinds of speeches, and then</LD>
<LD>   Darcy Miller, who's the smartest girl in Kate's class, stands at
the podium and talks about what a wonderful school Monroe is and how
fortunate they all are to have attended.</LD>
<TE>   "Let's get the show on the road," I whisper to Grandpa, who is
next to me. But he is so concentrated on the backs of those heads
that he doesn't answer.</TE>
<TE>   My cousin Gwen, on my other side, asks: "Is this going to go on
all day?" She sounds bored. But she's 15, and she sounds bored most
of the time. Maybe she thinks it's cool.</TE>
<TE>   "Get a grip," I whisper, which is what Kate says to me when she
especially wants to sound superior.</TE>
<TE>   There's another speech, and then the principal, Mr. Carruthers,
stands at the podium and says, "It is my pleasure to present the
graduating class of 2002." Everyone applauds except Gwen, who is
filing her nails.</TE>
<TE>   "John Adair," the principal calls, and a tall, skinny guy comes
mooching up the steps and across the platform. He gets his
certificate and leaves at the other side of the stage.</TE>
<TE>   One by one they come up. This is alphabetical, so we have a long
time to wait. But that's OK. Doesn't my cousin Gwen know this is
worth waiting for?</TE>
<TE>   I make a boat from my program to help pass the time, and when I
look along the row all my cousins are copycatting me. My Aunt Connie
is whispering angrily to little Davey, who is passing time kicking
the seat in front of him.</TE>
<TE>   We're getting really close to the Ps now.</TE>
<TE>   "Connie Lu," Mr. Carruthers says.</TE>
<TE>   I stuff my boat into my coat pocket and wait for what's coming.</TE>
<TE>   Friday: Will Mr. Carruthers ever get to the Ps?</TE>

<HD>Adelphia Stakeholders Tell Judge of Their Anger</HD>
<DH>Cable: The company paints a rosy picture of its prospects
at a bankruptcy hearing, but investors express anger.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A day after seeking protection from creditors, Adelphia
Communications Corp. told a bankruptcy judge that the debt-ridden
cable television company is "eminently reorganizable."</LD>
<LD>   That sunny view of prospects for the sixth-largest U.S. cable TV
company, though, did not sit well with the company's stakeholders,
who told the bankruptcy judge that they are angry over the collapse
of Adelphia.</LD>
<LD>   Adelphia got permission Wednesday from U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Robert Gerber to pay its employees, hire professionals and jointly
administer the Chapter 11 filings of the parent and 228 subsidiaries.
In the process, though, the company got an earful from stakeholders.</LD>
<TE>   "Adelphia has literally been looted by the Rigas family, all to
the detriment of the company's bondholders and stockholders," said
David Friedman, an attorney for bond investors holding $10 billion
worth of Adelphia's debt.</TE>
<TE>   "This is perhaps the single largest case of fraud in corporate
history."</TE>
<TE>   Coudersport, Pa.-based Adelphia filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection late Tuesday, listing $18.6 billion in debt and $24.4
billion in assets in court papers. It is the biggest cable television
company to file for bankruptcy protection and is the fifth-largest
filing in U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   The company is negotiating with creditors to sell almost half of
its assets. It said Wednesday it has received as many as 10 inquiries
from potential buyers for its cable systems.</TE>
<TE>   At the first-day bankruptcy hearing in New York, attorneys for
bondholders and shareholders aimed most of their anger at allegations
of self-dealing among Rigas family members who founded the company.</TE>
<TE>   Company founder and former Chairman John Rigas and his son
Timothy, formerly the chief financial officer, resigned from the
company in May. The Rigases did not attend the bankruptcy hearing.</TE>
<TE>   The Rigases used company money to fund the Buffalo Sabres pro
hockey team they own and buy company cars from a family-owned
dealership, according to regulatory filings. The family also used
guaranteed loans to buy company securities, the filings say.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles may sue Adelphia if the cable TV provider doesn't
upgrade systems and maintain service quality, City Atty. Rocky
Delgadillo said. Last week Delgadillo said he would advise the city
to revoke or refuse to renew Adelphia's contracts if the company
fails to pay franchise fees and provide the promised quality of
service.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just not fair that the Rigas family was off buying a hockey
team when our customers were being denied Internet service,"
Delgadillo said at a news conference.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia operates in five franchise areas of Los Angeles, serving
about 250,000 subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   The company said Wednesday that it plans to operate normally
during reorganization with no interruption in services to its
subscribers.</TE>

<HD>Bausch &amp; Lomb Infringed Lens Patents, Judge Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc. must stop making and selling its PureVision line
of contact lenses because the product infringes a patent owned by
Novartis' Wesley Jessen Corp., a U.S. judge ruled Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "There is no 'sound reason' for denying Wesley Jessen's request"
for an injunction, U.S. District Judge Roderick McKelvie said.</LD>
<LD>   The decision is the latest chapter in the legal battle for a
greater share of the $43-billion contact lens market between
Rochester, N.Y.-based Bausch &amp; Lomb and Ciba Vision Corp., a unit of
Swiss drug maker Novartis that includes Wesley Jessen. The ruling
means Bausch &amp; Lomb can't make or sell PureVision lenses until at
least 2005, when the patent expires, Ciba Vision said.</LD>
<TE>   "This is the outcome we expected," Ciba Vision general counsel
Scott Meece said. "We were quite confident in the validity of this
patent and the infringement by Bausch &amp; Lomb."</TE>
<TE>   Bausch &amp; Lomb spokeswoman Margaret Graham said the company would
file an immediate appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Novartis' American depositary receipts rose 36 cents to $40.10 on
the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of Bausch &amp; Lomb, the world's
third-largest contact lens maker behind Ciba Vision and No. 1 Johnson
&amp; Johnson, fell $3.78, or 10%, to $33.30, also on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Wesley Jessen never made a product from the patented technology
and sought no monetary damages, according to the opinion. McKelvie's
ruling said it cost Bausch &amp; Lomb $60 million to bring its product to
market.</TE>
<TE>   McKelvie also upheld the validity of Wesley Jessen's 1987 patent
for lens plastics with increased "wettability." The decision ends
just one of many lawsuits between the two companies.</TE>

<HD>Blockbuster CEO Denies Conspiracy Deals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.A. BADGER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The chief executive of Blockbuster Inc. testified Wednesday that the
video-rental giant competed vigorously with other video retailers,
but that it considered large chains as its major rivals, rather than
independent stores.</LD>
<LD>   John F. Antioco was called as a hostile witness by the plaintiffs
suing Dallas-based Blockbuster and top Hollywood movie studios for
alleged antitrust violations.</LD>
<LD>   The plaintiffs--three small video-store operators--claim the
studios and Blockbuster conspired on special revenue-sharing deals in
the late 1990s to monopolize the video-rental market and drive them
out of business.</LD>
<TE>   Under revenue sharing, Blockbuster paid less up front for tapes
and then split the rental revenue with the movie studios.</TE>
<TE>   Before the revenue deals, Blockbuster and others typically paid a
set fee for a tape and kept all of the income generated.</TE>
<TE>   Antioco denied that any improper conspiracy existed and said the
studios were free to make revenue-sharing deals with Blockbuster's
competitors.</TE>
<TE>   Just before Antioco's testimony, James Sweeney, an economist from
Stanford University, told jurors that his analysis of Blockbuster's
revenue-sharing deals with the studios led him to believe that an
illegal conspiracy existed that hurt independent video retailers.</TE>

<HD>Other Telecom, Bank Stocks Dragged Down</HD>
<DH>Reaction: As WorldCom's bonds plunge in value, those
holding the paper are feeling the pain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As WorldCom Inc. bonds plunged Wednesday, news of the long-distance
company's alleged $3.9-billion accounting fraud dragged down
securities of other telecom companies and the banks that have
financed them.</LD>
<LD>   Investors in Clinton, Miss.-based WorldCom held debt securities
with a face value of $28 billion, including $11.9 billion issued last
year in the biggest bond sale by a U.S. company. Companies with the
biggest exposure include foreign insurers such as Aegon ($200
million) and Manulife Financial Corp. ($172 million).</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, WorldCom's long-term bonds were trading for as
little as 11 cents on the dollar, down from 40 cents before Tuesday's
disclosure of the accounting scandal. Its short-term debt fell from
73 cents on the dollar to 19 cents. The prices reflect investor
concerns that WorldCom may seek bankruptcy protection and the bonds
won't be fully repaid.</LD>
<TE>   WorldCom's stock never opened for trading Wednesday. In
after-hours trading Tuesday, it had tumbled to 35 cents a share from
its regular-session close of 83 cents. The stock was trading at
around $62 three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The slide has cost WorldCom investors dearly. The California
Public Employees' Retirement System, the largest U.S. pension fund,
said its losses on WorldCom stocks and bonds could reach $565
million. Michigan's state pension fund put its losses at $116
million.</TE>
<TE>   "The market is saying this company's probability of winding up in
bankruptcy has increased dramatically," said Mark Kiesel, senior
strategist at Newport Beach's Pimco bond funds. He said the debacle
was accelerating a flight by investors out of risky stocks and junk
bonds and into conservative fixed-income investments.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, some well-known junk bond mutual funds suffered sharp
losses in share value Wednesday, as bonds of WorldCom and other junk
issuers sank. The Fidelity Capital &amp; Income fund dropped 3.7% for the
day. The Pimco High Yield fund fell 1.6% and the Strong High Yield
Bond fund tumbled 2.5%.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, investors poured into U.S. Treasury securities. The
yield on the 10-year Treasury note dropped to 4.74% from 4.81%
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   A WorldCom bankruptcy would be the largest in U.S. corporate
history, surpassing that of Enron Corp. Like Enron, WorldCom was
financed by the nation's biggest banks, whose stocks were punished
Wednesday despite their assurances that, as Citigroup Inc. Chief
Financial Officer Todd Thomson put it, "the financial impact [on
Citigroup] ... should be relatively modest."</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup, the largest financial services company, said it
expected losses on WorldCom bonds owned by its insurance subsidiaries
to total $335 million, with an additional $40 million in "possible
exposure in other areas."</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup dropped $2.12 to $37. Shares in the nation's
second-largest bank, J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., lost $1.44 to $31.49;
No. 3 Bank of America Corp. declined $2.58 to $67.45.</TE>
<TE>   Mellon Financial stock fell $1.55, or nearly 5%, to $30.65 after
the bank said it could lose $100 million on a loan to WorldCom.</TE>
<TE>   Bank of America led a bank syndicate that previously arranged a
$2.65-billion unsecured line of credit for WorldCom, with Citigroup
and Morgan as co-leaders. WorldCom drew down that line last month,
putting some 30 banks that shared the loan at risk of loss. Last
month, B of A and Morgan arranged an additional $1.5 billion in loans
secured by payments by WorldCom customers, and thus are presumably
safe.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom's financial filings show it also had separate unused
credit lines for $1.6 billion and $3.75 billion. The banks said
WorldCom would be unable to access those lines now that it has
admitted that it improperly booked more than $3.9 billion in routine
expenses as capital improvements.</TE>
<TE>   Before the disclosures, WorldCom was trying to negotiate $5
billion in new credit lines with its banks. Its chances of success
are now "significantly reduced," said Robert Konefal, an analyst at
Moody's Investors Service.</TE>
<TE>   Bank of America could not be reached for comment. Morgan said its
WorldCom exposure "is very small."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, WorldCom bondholders are worrying about whether they'll
be elbowed aside by the banks should WorldCom file for bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   "As of now, the banks are the enemy," the bond research firm
CreditSights Inc. warned.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom's $28 billion in bonds and notes, which even before the
news had been classified as speculative by the ratings agencies,
immediately were lowered to the lowest realms of junk-bond status.</TE>
<TE>   Other telecom companies took a beating Wednesday. AT&amp;T Corp.
dropped 37 cents to $9.62, and Sprint FON was down $1.19 to $10.10.</TE>
<TE>   The debacle also rocked computer service provider Electronic Data
Systems Corp., whose stock fell 6.9% on fears that a $6.4-billion
WorldCom contract was jeopardized.</TE>

<HD>Federal Reserve Leaves Rates Unchanged</HD>
<DH>Economy: Analysts say policymakers' cautious optimism
indicates no increases are probable in the immediate future.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GLENN SOMERVILLE</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Federal Reserve policymakers decided Wednesday to keep U.S.
short-term interest rates unchanged at four-decade lows, biding their
time as they await signs that a full-throttle recovery is in place.</LD>
<LD>   The Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee announced
at the close of a two-day meeting that it voted unanimously to
maintain its federal funds rate target at 1.75%. The more symbolic
discount rate, charged to banks for loans directly from the Fed, also
was unmoved at 1.25%.</LD>
<LD>   In its statement, the Fed acknowledged the economy had softened
after an inventory-led bounce in the first quarter. But it expressed
cautious optimism.</LD>
<TE>   "The committee expects the rate of increase of final demand to
pick up over coming quarters, supported in part by robust underlying
growth in productivity, but the degree of the strengthening remains
uncertain," the statement said.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed said risks were equally balanced between economic weakness
and a flare-up in inflation, a stance unchanged from the last meeting
on May 7, but economists said the post-meeting statement's overall
tone indicated no rate increases were likely in the immediate future.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a hint that they do not see any reason to tighten in the
near term," said Alan Ruskin, research director at 4Cast Ltd. in New
York. "They are moderating the perception of an [economic] upside and
moderating expectations of a Fed tightening further out as well."</TE>
<TE>   The widely expected decision to stand pat on rates came amid
growing market unease and with the economy still edging ahead
unevenly. Recent data have shown the economy in a gradual
recovery--growing once more after a brief recession last year but at
an uneven pace that analysts say has delayed the Fed's anticipated
timetable to begin raising rates.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed cut rates 11 times last year by a total of 4.75 percentage
points to revitalize the flagging economy.</TE>
<TE>   A general sense of queasiness in financial markets, prompted by a
seemingly unending series of accounting scandals, concern over
corporate profits and a weakening dollar, has cast a shadow across a
generally favorable second-half economic outlook and could unsettle
consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the government reported Wednesday that sales of new homes
hit a record seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.028 million units
in May, up 8.1%, while orders for durable goods were up 0.6% last
month. The pickup in durables orders indicated the nation's factory
sector, which bore the brunt of last year's economic slowdown, might
be getting its feet under it once more.</TE>
<TE>   These orders are taken partly as a sign of heavy industries'
willingness to invest in expanded production facilities, something
that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan monitors closely and regards as
essential to a sustained recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Any indication of a firming in business investment could be
heartening to Fed policymakers.</TE>
<TE>   "Capital investment is not going anywhere very fast," Greenspan
said of the economy earlier this month during an appearance in
Montreal with other central bankers from key European economies and
from Japan. "Our outlook at the Fed hasn't really materially changed
since January," he said at that time.</TE>

<HD>Unlikely Pair at Center of Tempest</HD>
<DH>Management: The close partnership of WorldCom's former CEO
and CFO is generating interest as firm's books unravel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN KAPLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bernard J. Ebbers was an unlikely pioneer in the cutting-edge world
of telecommunications. Though he transformed WorldCom Inc. from an
idea on a coffee-shop napkin into the second-largest long-distance
company in the country, Ebbers himself is known to shun cell phones,
pagers and even e-mail.</LD>
<LD>   Still, the folksy former-basketball-coach-turned-chief-executive
managed to build a formidable company through an inspired series of
more than 70 mergers and acquisitions that propelled WorldCom's stock
price into the stratosphere. The financial mind behind the deal
making was Ebbers' right-hand man, Chief Financial Officer Scott D.
Sullivan.</LD>
<LD>   Ebbers and Sullivan were an odd couple--the laid-back Ebbers in
cowboy boots and faded jeans, Sullivan an accounting whiz kid 20
years his junior. Yet together they made such frequent visits from
WorldCom's headquarters in modest Clinton, Miss., to the bankers and
analysts of Wall Street that their presentations were dubbed "The
Scott and Bernie Show." Each time, they won over crowds with slide
presentations showing WorldCom's ever-rising stock.</LD>
<TE>   Those gains have been wiped out by concerns about WorldCom's
ability to service the nearly $30 billion in debt that piled up
during the spectacular buying spree, sinking demand for its phone and
data network services and the meltdown of the telecom industry.</TE>
<TE>   But the close partnership between Ebbers and Sullivan is
generating new interest in the wake of WorldCom's revelation this
week that the company inflated its books by $3.9 billion over the
course of 15 months, turning losses into profit and masking the dire
financial health of what was once one of the nation's most admired
companies.</TE>
<TE>   The two men occupied adjoining offices and held the center of
power at WorldCom. And now both have left the company in disgrace.</TE>
<TE>   Ebbers resigned as CEO in April amid concerns about WorldCom's
accounting practices and future prospects. Sullivan was fired by
WorldCom's board of directors this week after the accounting
shenanigans came to light.</TE>
<TE>   With few details emerging from the company and the two men
shielding themselves from public questioning, it is impossible at
this stage to gauge their motives for classifying some of the
company's routine expenses as capital expenditures. It also is
unclear whether Ebbers was aware of the methods, though many Wall
Street observers believe he must have been.</TE>
<TE>   Growing up in Edmonton near Canada's Rocky Mountains, Ebbers, now
60, showed few signs of becoming an icon of the accounting scandals
that have undermined investors' confidence in corporate financial
information and sent the stock market into a tailspin.</TE>
<TE>   Upon graduation from high school, the 6-foot-4-inch Ebbers took a
job delivering milk door to door, sometimes in temperatures that
reached 30 degrees below zero. As a refuge, he accepted a basketball
scholarship to Mississippi College, a small Southern Baptist school
in Clinton. He graduated in 1967 and became a high school PE teacher
and basketball coach.</TE>
<TE>   Ebbers gradually became interested in business. He managed a
garment warehouse, then purchased a motel and expanded it to nine
outlets. In 1983, he and a group of investors realized that the
breakup of phone monopoly AT&amp;T Corp. offered an opportunity for
start-ups to compete in the market for long-distance phone service.
They sketched their plan for LDDS (short for long-distance discount
service) on a napkin.</TE>
<TE>   Over time, LDDS expanded its initial mission of selling cut-rate
long-distance services and grew into a worldwide provider of voice
and data networks with 20 million residential customers and thousands
of corporate accounts. Ebbers achieved nearly all of this growth
through a series of increasingly ambitious acquisitions, each one
adding to the company's portfolio and raising its profile among
investors and customers.</TE>
<TE>   The company changed its name to WorldCom to reflect its global
ambitions.</TE>
<TE>   "He is extremely aggressive and simply wants to build the biggest
company in the industry," John W. Sidgmore, WorldCom's current chief
executive, said of Ebbers at the height of his deal making.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, Ebbers bought Advanced Telecommunications Corp., a
long-distance provider, for $720 million. Advanced
Telecommunications' CFO and treasurer was Scott D. Sullivan, who
became one of the few executives from acquired firms to find a major
role at WorldCom.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan, now 40, earned a reputation on Wall Street as the brains
behind WorldCom's flashy merger-and-acquisition strategy. He
sharpened his skills in the 1980s, when his job was to audit
potential deals for General Electric Co. Tony Ferrugia, an analyst
who follows WorldCom for A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons in St. Louis, has
described Sullivan as "one of the brightest CFOs I have ever met."</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan earned that respect by juggling several major
acquisitions at once--a skill necessitated by Ebbers' voracious
appetite for growth. At one point, Sullivan was working on a
complicated three-way deal to acquire the network assets of online
computer services firm CompuServe Corp. and America Online Inc. while
simultaneously negotiating a $2-billion stock deal for Brooks Fiber
Properties Inc., a local phone upstart challenging the entrenched
Baby Bells.</TE>
<TE>   In the midst of those negotiations, Sullivan made an off-the-cuff
comment to an investment banker that WorldCom might be a better
candidate to purchase No. 2 long-distance firm MCI Communications
Corp., whose plan to merge with British Telecom was beginning to
unravel.</TE>
<TE>   "On a whim I said, 'We might be able to help out,' " Sullivan
recounted to a reporter in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Over the course of a plane ride, he ran the numbers and realized
that MCI was worth more to WorldCom than to BT because WorldCom could
blend the long-distance company's assets with its own local network.
WorldCom made an offer and ended up buying MCI for about $40 billion,
setting a record in the telecommunications industry.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan was richly rewarded for his efforts. In 1998, he was
rated the most highly paid CFO in America by the magazine CFO. On top
of his base salary of $4 million, he took home $15.25 million in
stock option profit.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan also earned the respect and confidence of Ebbers, and the
pair became so close that they alienated other executives. They ran
WorldCom in an informal manner that reflected Ebbers' style.</TE>
<TE>   Though he remained in Mississippi, Ebbers held on to his Rocky
Mountain roots.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very down-to-earth, no airs or nothing," said Frank
Latham, who often served Ebbers at his restaurant, Frank's World
Famous Biscuits, in Jackson, Miss. "In fact, when he came over for
lunch, there would be three or four guys with him and he would be the
worst dressed of them all."</TE>

<LD>New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer said Wednesday that his office will
investigate analyst commentary on WorldCom Inc., which had a "buy"
rating from star telecom analyst Jack Grubman at Citigroup Inc.'s
Salomon Smith Barney from 1997 through this April.</LD>
<LD>   Just Monday, with the stock down more than 90% from December,
Grubman cut his rating to "under-perform" from "neutral."</LD>
<LD>   "It did catch many people's eye that he finally issued a
downgrade," Spitzer said.</LD>
<TE>   His office, which in April stunned Wall Street with allegations of
tainted research advice at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., already has been
investigating Grubman, people familiar with the situation said.</TE>
<TE>   Salomon advised WorldCom on its $44-billion purchase of MCI
Communications Corp. in 1998 and co-managed its $11.9-billion bond
sale last year, the biggest by a U.S. company.</TE>

<HD>Blue Shield Adds Quality Evaluations</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Blue Shield of California said Wednesday that it would start
evaluating hospitals under its "network choice" program in terms of
quality and patient experience, not just cost-effectiveness.</LD>
<LD>   The move is the latest in a series of policy changes by health
insurers to balance cost control and quality assurance. For Blue
Shield, it is another step toward the development of a broad database
that eventually will help its 2.3 million members decide which of the
nonprofit insurer's 350 hospitals offer the most effective and
cost-efficient medical care.</LD>
<LD>   The plan builds on the fact that Blue Shield already has separated
hospitals into two groups--choice or affiliate--based solely on
costs. Choice hospitals are considered less expensive than affiliate
hospitals.</LD>
<TE>   Under Blue Shield's network choice, there are no changes to a
member's out-of-pocket co-payment or co-insurance amounts when using
a choice hospital. Members who use affiliate hospitals pay an
additional co-payment or co-insurance fee of $200 or 10% of the
hospital's fee each time they are admitted to a hospital that is not
on Blue Shield's preferred list.</TE>
<TE>   But few, including Blue Shield, regard the cost standard alone as
an effective way for consumers to make decisions about what hospital
to choose.</TE>
<TE>   Health-care costs are expected to rise this year at an even
greater rate than last year's double-digit increase, experts say,
with hospitals driving a big portion of that continuing surge.</TE>
<TE>   As employers are expected to push more of those costs to their
employees, the goal is to encourage patients to make the most
cost-efficient decisions.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Shield effort is one of many underway. But the database
will take years to create.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no real silver bullet here. It's discussed as
consumer-driven health care, but it's also part of a larger desire by
employers to make their workers more aware of the real costs of
care," said Alwyn Castle, a spokesman for the Washington, D.C.-based
Center for Studying Health System Change.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very important step forward," said Dr. Arnie Milstein,
medical director for the Pacific Business Group on Health. "We've had
a market in California that rewarded low costs, and we need to do
more to balance that with rewards for quality and transformative
information technology advances. The more insurers that follow in
this direction the better."</TE>
<TE>   Blue Shield is responding to that push by employers, and the next
phase will be the gathering of cost and quality information based on
two sets of standards, said David Joyner, senior vice president for
network services.</TE>
<TE>   Among the first set of standards, developed by a group mainly
comprising Fortune 500 companies called the Leapfrog Group, will
include whether hospitals have a computerized entry system for
medications and dosages and properly staffed intensive care units.</TE>
<TE>   The other standards, known as Patients' Evaluation of Performance
in California, will take a long time to gather and will serve as a
kind of exit poll for patients.</TE>
<TE>   PEP-C is a collaborative effort of the California Institute for
Health Systems Performance and the California Health Care Foundation.
Among other things, it will ask patients to rate their hospital care
based on such criteria as respect for patient preferences,
information and education, physical comfort and emotional support.</TE>
<TE>   When the program is put online in October, Joyner said, the first
measuring standard will be whether the Blue Shield-affiliated
hospitals have implemented the Leapfrog and the PEP-C standards. The
next phase is building the database of patient evaluations.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Chason, chief executive of the hospital at UC Davis, said that
cost and patient outcomes alone are misleading standards since some
more-expensive hospitals can have superior patient outcomes that
mitigate those costs, and because hospitals like his often deal with
sicker and more difficult patients than other facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Many experts hope that these databases eventually will include
such things as the rate of opportunistic infections or complications,
the rates at which procedures were ultimately deemed ineffective and
had to be redone through another hospital stay and further medical
procedures, and whether the hospital had a shorter patient stay
because it was too aggressive in moving people out of the hospital or
because it was more effective in carrying out the procedures without
any problems.</TE>
<TE>   "Any standard of outcomes has to take that into consideration.
Otherwise, you are mixing apples and oranges," Chason said.</TE>

<HD>Judge to Decide on Hiring Lawyers for Kmart Board</HD>
<DH>Courts: Retailer's creditors argue that request is contrary
to the estate's interests.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Attorneys for Kmart Corp.'s creditors said the estate has no business
paying for a new set of lawyers to represent a board of directors
accused of impropriety.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Cieri, attorney for some of the retailer's creditors,
argued in federal court Wednesday that paying to defend board members
was contrary to the estate's interests.</LD>
<LD>   "How can it be in your best interest to be funding your potential
opponent's defense?" Cieri asked.</LD>
<TE>   Attorney Jack Butler, arguing for the company, said it was just
good business sense to have the board represented and getting advice
as it helps oversee reorganization.</TE>
<TE>   He moved for the hiring of Dewey Ballantine, a New York law firm
with fees ranging from $102 to $595 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Susan Pierson Sonderby said she would rule
July 17 on whether to allow the hiring.</TE>
<TE>   "It goes without saying the board should have counsel," she said.
"The question is whether the estate should pay for it."</TE>
<TE>   Butler said it would be "imprudent if not reckless" to force the
board to make business decisions without its own legal counsel.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart filed court documents Wednesday outlining its "stewardship
investigation" to determine whether corporate executives acted
properly in the months leading up to the January bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation was started by an anonymous Jan. 9 letter from
Kmart employees to the Securities and Exchange Commission about
unspecified accounting matters.</TE>
<TE>   News reports in the No. 2 discount retailer's home state of
Michigan have said the company is investigating whether executives
exceeded their authority in making loans to senior executives as a
way of retaining them.</TE>
<TE>   Butler said part of the investigation eventually would involve
questioning board members about what they knew of the loans and other
accounting measures.</TE>
<TE>   He said they were entitled to legal counsel.</TE>

<KH></KH>
<HD>Volatile Session Mostly Recovers</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Heavy selling at the outset reflects investors'
exasperation with WorldCom's disclosure. Indexes resurge to end
mixed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORA VRANA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks plunged Wednesday, then recovered most of their losses, in a
volatile session triggered by WorldCom Inc.'s disclosure of an
allegedly massive accounting fraud.</LD>
<LD>   Coupled with the day's heavy trading volume--the New York Stock
Exchange had its busiest session this year--the dramatic turnaround
raised hopes that the market may have reached at least a near-term
bottom after five straight weekly declines, analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average was down nearly 200 points at its
low, then resurged to close with a loss of 6.71 points, at 9,120.11.</LD>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite index and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 both
traded below their three-year closing lows reached Sept. 21, but
recovered to finish nearly even on the day. The Nasdaq index posted a
net gain of 5.34 points to 1,429.33 after falling as low as 1,375.53,
a level last seen in October 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The S&amp;P eased 2.61 points to 973.53 after falling to 952.92.</TE>
<TE>   The heavy selling at the outset reflected investors' exasperation
with WorldCom's disclosure, the latest in a string of scandals
engulfing corporate America.</TE>
<TE>   Traders described the market scene early in the day as overrun
with fears that WorldCom's bombshell may be followed by a new wave of
financial frauds.</TE>
<TE>   "Investors are saying, 'What else is next? Who can you trust?,' "
said Ned Riley, chief investment strategist at State Street Global
Advisors.</TE>
<TE>   But buyers began to return to stocks in droves in the final 90
minutes of trading.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said there was no specific catalyst for the rebound,
though the Federal Reserve's announcement that it is holding
short-term interest rates at 40-year lows may have soothed some
investors--even though the central bank's decision had been expected.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed, in its announcement after a two-day meeting, said the
economy continues to recover, but that the pace may be moderating.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street optimists say the stock market has been distracted
from the improving economy by the barrage of corporate scandals.</TE>
<TE>   But with key indexes down sharply this year even as the economic
outlook has improved, some analysts see stocks strengthening soon--if
investors begin to make decisions based on economic realities rather
than fear of the next corporate accounting debacle.</TE>
<TE>   "We are seeing the peak of market anxiety right now, " said Subodh
Kumar, chief investment strategist for CIBC World Markets in New
York. "However, the economy is improving and I think we are bottoming
out."</TE>
<TE>   General Electric on Tuesday said it's on track to meet analysts'
earnings estimates for the second quarter. The stock rose 78 cents to
$29.50 on Wednesday after falling as low as $27.42.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Colgate-Palmolive predicted double-digit earnings growth in
the second quarter. Its shares jumped $1.71 to $49.66.</TE>
<TE>   Major mutual fund companies said some investors have expressed
concern about WorldCom in calls to fund offices. But the firms said
they have not seen a wave of redemptions from their stock funds this
week.</TE>
<TE>   At Charles Schwab Corp. in San Francisco, which runs a supermarket
of mutual funds, spokesman Greg Gable said the "heightened sense of
caution" of the last several months has continued.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts cautioned that the turnaround Wednesday stemmed
partly from technical factors. For example, "short covering"--buying
by traders who had previously sold borrowed shares, betting on lower
prices--may have helped stoke the late rebound.</TE>
<TE>   Although key market indexes ended nearly flat, declining issues
outnumbered advancers by 19 to 14 on the New York Stock Exchange and
by 21 to 14 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Some traders said the market's ongoing problem is as much a lack
of interest by potential buyers as it is a desire by others to sell
out.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a slow death due to a very skeptical investor base. They
are just waiting it out," said Jack Francis, managing director and
head of Nasdaq trading at UBS Warburg. "This is a sick market."</TE>
<TE>   Others point to still-high price-to-earnings ratios on many
stocks, even as prices have dropped this year.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign investors weary of ongoing U.S. accounting scandals and
doubtful about the nation's economic growth potential contributed to
the early decline Wednesday, analysts said. The U.S. dollar slid
further against the euro, though it recovered much of its losses by
the close. The euro ended at 98.6 cents in New York, up from 97.8
cents Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Asian markets were the first to react to the WorldCom news
Wednesday. In Tokyo, the Nikkei-225 index sank 4% to 10,074.56. South
Korea's main index slumped 7.2%.</TE>
<TE>   European markets also were mostly lower. The German market fell
2.5%, and the British market lost 2.2%.</TE>
<TE>   On Wall Street, WorldCom shares never opened for trading
Wednesday, but companies with any ties to WorldCom, such as telecom
gear suppliers and banks, saw their stocks tumble even though most
rushed to calm investors fears, saying their exposure would be
limited.</TE>
<TE>   Lucent Technologies said WorldCom is a "minor customer," but
Lucent shares still fell 39 cents to $1.58. Among other telecom
equipment firms, Nortel Networks was off 14 cents to $1.47 and
Tellabs lost 57 cents to $5.78.</TE>
<TE>   Among other telecom services firms, Qwest Communications plummeted
$2.40 to $1.79 on worries about its accounting, while AT&amp;T slid 33
cents to $9.62.</TE>
<TE>   Concern that banks with billions in loans to WorldCom could suffer
if the firm files for bankruptcy sent shares of J.P. Morgan Chase
down $1.44 to $31.49 and Citigroup down $2.12 to $37.</TE>
<TE>   Although some analysts predicted the market would continue to make
gains for the rest of the week, the outlook for the rest of the
summer remains uncertain. Another terrorist attack against America or
another major accounting scandal could keep the market depressed for
months to come, some said.</TE>
<TE>   "That could send us back to new lows," Riley said.</TE>

<HD>Wall St. Batters Martha Stewart Stock</HD>
<DH>Media: Reports of a wider probe rattle investors, but
analysts say her company's business appears strong.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street continued to hammer shares of Martha Stewart Living
Omnimedia Inc. on Wednesday after reports of a wider investigation
into alleged insider trading by Martha Stewart.</LD>
<LD>   But, at least so far, the scandal appears to have had very little
effect on the company's business.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of the multimedia company fell 24% Wednesday, losing $3.20
to close at $10.40 on the New York Stock Exchange.</LD>
<TE>   The stock has fallen since June 7, when a House of Representatives
panel said it was reviewing Stewart's sale last December of stock of
ImClone Systems Inc. Reports have since included possible charges
against Stewart for obstruction of justice and making false
statements regarding her role in the sale.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart's most important constituency, however--the TV viewers,
magazine readers and decorating disciples who buy everything from
paint to gardening tools emblazoned with her name--have stood by the
entertaining expert, retailers and others say.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think at this point, any of this has impacted her company
at all," said Jeffrey Klinefelter, an analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray in Minneapolis. "I haven't heard about any changes in sales
trends, advertisers pushing back or anything else."</TE>
<TE>   And unless Stewart is formally charged with a crime, that trend
probably will continue, say financial analysts and consumer behavior
experts. She might even, in typical Martha Stewart fashion, turn the
potential disaster to her advantage.</TE>
<TE>   A Kmart Corp. spokesman said the company does not break out sales
of individual brands, but Stewart's "Everyday" line of thousands of
exclusive products continues to sell well. At Sherwin-Williams Co.,
which makes Martha Stewart paint for Kmart and recently began selling
a line of Martha Stewart-licensed paint colors at its 2,600 stores,
only one customer has called with concerns about Stewart's integrity
and her relationship with the paint company, said spokesman Conway
Ivey.</TE>
<TE>   "I told her that I don't know anything about the allegations, that
we would want to see what comes out of any judicial process," Ivey
said, "but that we've had a relationship with her and her company and
that they are excellent people who have always acted in an honorable
and forthright way."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart has denied wrongdoing in her sale of nearly 4,000 ImClone
shares one day before the Food and Drug Administration rejected
ImClone's application for approval of an experimental cancer drug,
which sent the stock plummeting.</TE>
<TE>   If Stewart is exonerated--or even charged with a crime but not
convicted, some say--she could use the scandal to prove her
oft-repeated claim that she is subjected to greater scrutiny as one
of the few successful women leaders of a major American company.</TE>
<TE>   "If nothing is found, she can use it in the future to say,
remember this the next time someone attacks me," said Michael Kamins,
an associate professor of marketing at the USC Marshall School of
Business.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy grew out of Stewart's friendship with former
ImClone Chief Executive Samuel D. Waksal, who was arrested two weeks
ago on charges of insider trading for allegedly trying to sell his
stock and tipping off family members after learning of the impending
FDA decision.</TE>

<HD>OPEC Not Boosting Oil Output</HD>
<DH>Fuels: Ministers decide to leave quotas at 11-year low to
maintain prices. Member nations may hike production in fall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>OPEC ministers Wednesday agreed to keep production quotas at an
11-year low to maintain oil prices at about $25 a barrel at a time of
slowing world demand.</LD>
<LD>   Members said they want to increase output after their September
meeting, choosing to wait for world economies to rebound. Concern
about possible disruptions to oil supply because of violence in the
Middle East has contributed to a 26% jump in prices this year to
$25.24 a barrel in London.</LD>
<LD>   "The current price is reasonable," said Saudi Arabia's oil
minister, Ali Ibrahim Naimi. "They are at a level where we don't need
to make any change right now. We will increase output when the time
is right, and hopefully that will be later in the year."</LD>
<TE>   With prices rising, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries has been pumping more than promised to raise additional
revenue and fight Russia, Norway and other rivals for market share.
The quota of 21.7 million barrels a day is the lowest since the
Persian Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   Oil demand this year may rise at less than half the average during
the 1990s, the International Energy Agency estimates. OPEC's
restraint has helped bolster prices, with the group's benchmark at
$24.61 a barrel Tuesday, within its $22 to $28 target range.</TE>
<TE>   The decision had been expected by traders. Benchmark Brent crude
oil rose 4 cents to $25.24 a barrel Wednesday in London.</TE>
<TE>   Iran's oil minister, Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, said an increase in
output is probable in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Naimi said it's too early to judge the effect of plunging stock
markets worldwide on prospects for the oil market. The Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 stock index is down 16% this year and at its lowest level
since after the Sept. 11 attacks on the U.S. Investors said prices
may stay high.</TE>
<TE>   "OPEC is continuing to control the market quite effectively," said
Robin Batchelor, who helps manage about $1.7 billion at Merrill Lynch
Investment Managers.</TE>
<TE>   Ten of OPEC's 11 members--all except Iraq--have output quotas.
Those quotas were cut for a fourth time in a year Jan. 1, falling by
1.5 million barrels a day as the group anticipated a drop in world
demand after Sept. 11.</TE>

<HD>Mexican Peso, Stocks Take Hit</HD>
<DH>Latin America: Currency falls to lowest level against
dollar since 1999. WorldCom troubles spark telecom sell-off.</DH>

<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Mexico's peso closed on Wednesday at its weakest level since early
1999 and stocks hit new lows for the year on fear that the Mexican
economy and markets may be hurt by fallout from U.S. accounting
scandals.</LD>
<LD>   The peso shed 1.2% from Tuesday to close at 10.004 per U.S.
dollar, its weakest level since Feb. 10, 1999, raising chances that
Mexico's central bank would restrict liquidity in the local money
market to support the currency and calm inflation fears.</LD>
<LD>   Mexico's benchmark IPC index of 36 stocks fell to a fresh low for
the year, down 2.9%, or 182.63 points, to close at 6,171.63, its
lowest level since mid-December. The index has lost 12.3% since the
end of May and is down 3.2% since the start of the year.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts said some global investors who have large stakes in
Mexican securities may be tempted to sell if they need to raise cash
to offset losses in other markets.</TE>
<TE>   "The market has been one of the best performers, so it is one
place where investors will look to raise cash," said Thierry Wizman,
Latin American strategist at brokerage Bear Stearns in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Blue-chip Mexican telecommunications companies, which are
favorites of foreign portfolio investors, were the top losers in
Wednesday's market rout, tracking losses in many U.S. telecom shares
in the wake of news of WorldCom Inc.'s massive accounting
irregularities.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of wireless company America Movil tumbled nearly 10%. Phone
giant Telmex, which accounts for 16% of the IPC, dropped 3.8%.
Telmex's U.S.-traded shares fell $1.72, or 5.3%, to $30.66 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the sell-off in the Mexican telecom sector was more
tied to the market's overall reaction to the WorldCom news than to
concerns that Mexican telecom companies might face debt-load problems
similar to those faced by some of their U.S. or European peers.</TE>
<TE>   "Mexican telecom companies are actually very under-leveraged,"
said Lars Schonander, Latin American fixed-income analyst at ING
Barings in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Investors fear that corporate accounting irregularities in the
United States and misdeeds by U.S. corporate executives could begin
to threaten the U.S. economic recovery, which is also seen as
negative for Mexico's economy.</TE>
<TE>   "If confidence in the United States is completely undermined and
we start facing the idea of a double dip [recession] in the U.S.
economy, then it is difficult to talk about a floor for the Mexican
economy and market," said Yarek Aranowicz at Credit Suisse Asset
Management in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico sends about 85% of its exports to the United States and has
seen its economy shrink by 2% in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Mexico's U.S.-fueled woes, Aranowicz said Mexican
assets, including stocks, bonds and the peso, could come under
pressure from a worsening political and economic outlook for Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   "We had this image built in the last two to three years that
whatever happens in Latin America should not affect the Mexican
economy and market, but problems in Brazil will impact all emerging
markets, including Mexico," he said.</TE>

<HD>Port Labor Talks Not Going Well</HD>
<DH>Trade: West Coast workers, firms are far from a deal just
five days before contract expires.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A month into high-stakes contract negotiations, West Coast
dockworkers and shipping lines have failed to reach agreement on a
single issue of significance--and have not even begun to discuss the
thorny topics of technology and job cuts, both sides said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The lack of progress just five days before the contract expires is
alarming businesses across the country. Fearing labor disruptions
during the busy back-to-school and Christmas seasons, some retailers
are stockpiling goods, pushing inbound container traffic to record
highs at ports along the coast. Two retailer groups already have
lobbied national and state legislators to intervene.</LD>
<LD>   The willingness of the union and shippers to speak publicly on
negotiations is in itself a sign of trouble. Both had agreed in
mid-May to an information blackout during talks.</LD>
<TE>   But Wednesday, Steve Stallone, spokesman for the International
Longshore and Warehouse Union, accused the shipping lines of leaking
news through third parties and said, "The gloves are off."</TE>
<TE>   Hours later, the Pacific Maritime Assn., which is negotiating on
behalf of shipping lines, tersely responded that the union was
misrepresenting its bargaining positions.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a good sign," said Jack Kyser, chief economist for
the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp., which is closely
monitoring the discussions. "The retail industry is already in a
panic over this."</TE>
<TE>   Imports entering through the Long Beach and Los Angeles ports were
up 26% in May from the previous year, Kyser said, in part because
retailers were moving summer deliveries early as a hedge against
shipping disruptions.</TE>
<TE>   A slowdown or lockout of the West Coast ports could cost the
national economy up to $1 billion a day, according to a study by UC
Berkeley planning professor Stephen S. Cohen.</TE>
<TE>   The ILWU has not threatened a strike, and Stallone said there were
no plans for work slowdowns when the contract expires at 5 p.m.
Monday. But the PMA has said it will monitor production and is
prepared to lock out union workers if the pace of work drops
significantly. Work slowdowns in 1999, when the previous contract
expired, cost the industry millions of dollars, the association said.</TE>
<TE>   Technology and productivity issues were expected to dominate the
talks and could prove to be stumbling blocks. Shipping lines have
said new scanners, electronic seals and other devices could
substantially reduce the employment of union clerks, who plan and
track container shipments. ILWU clerks last year earned an average of
$118,000, including overtime, according to the PMA.</TE>
<TE>   The union maintains it is willing to accept new technology as long
as none of the remaining work is outsourced to nonunion workers.</TE>
<TE>   But technology questions have not yet been raised because the ILWU
wants to settle the benefits question first.</TE>
<TE>   "They want major concessions in health care, cutbacks, co-pays,"
Stallone said. "Our position has always been that we need to maintain
our benefits package."</TE>
<TE>   When talks opened in mid-May, PMA President Joe Miniace said the
association's health-care contributions increased by $57 million last
year alone. "We must focus on the cost of this program," he said at
the time.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement issued Wednesday, the PMA disputed union claims
that it was asking for reductions in health benefits, and said the
ILWU plan was among the best in the country. The group contributes an
average of $42,000 per worker per year for benefits, more than the
average annual wage of U.S. workers, it said.</TE>

<DH>SEC Targets Top Execs; Errors Shock Analysts</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday said the alleged
$3.9-billion fraud at WorldCom Inc. was "directed and approved" by
top managers "to keep [earnings] in line with Wall Street's
expectations and to support WorldCom's stock price."</LD>
<LD>   The allegation, contained in a fraud suit filed in federal court
in Manhattan, contends that "WorldCom falsely portrayed itself as a
profitable business" when it should have reported a total of $1.2
billion in losses for last year and the first three months this year.</LD>
<LD>   "This portends that the agency is going to turn this suit around
and go after senior management," said Washington lawyer Jacob
Frenkel, a former SEC enforcement officer.</LD>
<TE>   WorldCom, which briefed the agency earlier this week on the
accounting irregularities it found, provided few new details
Wednesday to explain improper accounting transfers or why the company
engaged in such tactics.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesman Brad Burns said William McLucas, the former SEC
enforcement chief WorldCom hired to conduct an independent
investigation, will determine the reason that prior executives
wrongly moved certain routine expenses off the company's
profit-and-loss statement.</TE>
<TE>   Burns, in an interview before the suit was filed, said the costs
involved were normal expenses for connecting both commercial and
residential customers to the company's fiber-optic network, but he
could not provide further details.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC alleges in its suit that the costs were fees the company
paid to local Baby Bell carriers and other third-party companies for
access to their customers.</TE>
<TE>   The accounting fiasco first surfaced last week when an internal
WorldCom auditor found that expenses incurred last year didn't appear
where they should have in the company's books, according to a report
today in the New York Times. Instead, the costs were sprinkled across
a series of accounts for capital expenditures. The auditor quickly
figured that the shift in expenses was a big event that was
potentially fraudulent, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts and telecommunications experts said they were stunned by
the alleged accounting fraud that would dwarf all others and could
force the nation's second-largest long-distance company into the
biggest corporate bankruptcy ever.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts had thought little more could happen to the bedraggled
telecommunications industry, already beset by too much capacity on
fiber-optic lines and too little demand for services.</TE>
<TE>   "Events at WorldCom leave us virtually lost for words," analyst
Adam Quinton at Merrill Lynch Global Securities said in a note to
investors.</TE>
<TE>   The sheer size of WorldCom's errors--combined with the dire
financial and accounting problems that already have battered
WorldCom, Global Crossing Ltd. and other telecom companies--makes it
hard to believe that WorldCom simply misjudged how the costs should
be treated, accounting experts said.</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of the scandal is an often murky way of determining
when costs are part of ordinary day-to-day business and when they can
be considered capital expenditures.</TE>
<TE>   Ordinary costs are immediately deducted from revenue, lowering
earnings. Capital expenditures--outlays of money for long-term assets
such as fiber-optic cable, routers and other hardware and
software--are depreciated over time.</TE>
<TE>   "What happens is, firms start by capitalizing things that are
required to be capitalized, then they move to optional items, then
they keep pushing the line and finally they're capitalizing things
that shouldn't be capitalized at all," said W. Steve Albrecht,
associate dean of the Marriott School of Management at Brigham Young
University. "I can't tell you how many cases I've seen where
something starts out as aggressive accounting and somewhere switches
over to fraud."</TE>
<TE>   In WorldCom's case, Burns said, normal costs for connecting
customers to its fiber-optic network were wrongly transferred from
the profit-and-loss statement to the balance sheet as capitalized
expenditures.</TE>
<TE>   He said the improper transfers involved costs both at the
company's WorldCom group, which caters to large commercial customers,
and at its MCI group, which serves residential and small-business
customers.</TE>
<TE>   Burns said he could not provide additional details about the
expenses that were transferred. Nor could he say why the transfers
were made.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd have to ask Mr. Sullivan," he said, referring to Scott D.
Sullivan, the longtime chief financial officer who was fired Tuesday
as the company released information about the accounting
irregularities.</TE>
<TE>   But experts around the country had little doubt about the motive.</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted to keep their stock price up," said Brett Trueman, an
accounting professor at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   Though WorldCom's problems steadily mounted last year, its stock
traded within a range of $10 to $20 a share in the period, aided by
the firm's public reports of continued profits: The company said it
earned a net $1.4 billion last year and $130 million in this year's
first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   But those profits were phantom earnings in light of WorldCom's
latest announcement.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, Wall Street's fixation on near-term results feeds the
pressure on corporate executives to match or exceed investors'
expectations of performance, analysts said. So do the stock options
that are showered on executives and other employees, who profit only
if the company's earnings and stock price climb higher.</TE>
<TE>   Debate over normal costs versus capital expenses has been raging
for years.</TE>
<TE>   Whenever a company spends money, either in cash or on credit, to
buy a new asset--from miles of cable to a bucket of paint--it must
ask how long the asset will continue to have value. If the answer is
less than a year, the expenditure probably should be treated as an
ordinary business expense and deducted from earnings in the same
quarter, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   But if the asset will keep generating revenue into the next year
or longer, there might be a good argument for "capitalizing" it,
turning it into an asset that can be depreciated over a number of
years instead of deducted from earnings right away.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1999 speech, Lynn Turner, then chief accountant for the SEC,
said improper capitalization was the second most common accounting
problem the watchdog agency encountered, after improper revenue
recognition.</TE>

<HD>Qwest's Shares Plummet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Qwest Communications International Inc.'s stock lost more than half
its value Wednesday amid concern that regulators may force the
telephone company to restate its financial results after rival
WorldCom Inc. disclosed it hid losses.</LD>
<LD>   The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that Qwest, operator of
a fiber-optic network, is under tough scrutiny by the Securities and
Exchange Commission for how it accounted for as much as $1.4 billion
in sales of capacity to rivals. Citing people close to the probe, the
paper said the SEC is examining whether it was proper for the company
to include the revenue upfront on its books.</LD>
<LD>   After the markets closed, Qwest announced that Marilyn Carlson
Nelson was resigning as director of the company, adding that the move
was not related to the SEC investigation.</LD>
<TE>   The SEC, which began investigating Qwest in March, is looking at
transactions in which the company sold network space to other
carriers, then agreed to buy a similar amount from them. Investors
have questioned whether Qwest used the "swaps" to improperly inflate
sales. Qwest has said its accounting is proper.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest shares closed at $1.79, down $2.40, on the New York Stock
Exchange on Wednesday after falling as low as $1.20, the lowest since
they began trading in 1997. It was the fourth most actively traded
stock in the U.S. The decline in Qwest's share price, from a high of
$66 in March 2000, has wiped out more than $100 billion in market
value.</TE>
<TE>   "Qwest is a different company [from WorldCom] and I wouldn't be
here if I didn't believe that," Chief Executive Richard Notebaert
said. "I don't believe that anything has changed in the way that we
are working with the SEC."</TE>
<TE>   A Qwest spokesman declined further comment.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom said Tuesday that it fabricated profit by misreporting
$3.9 billion of costs in the last five quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Denver-based Qwest has said it may have to restate financial
results for the last three years. Qwest, the fourth-biggest U.S.
local telephone carrier, disclosed in April it had revised 2001
revenue lower, resulting in a wider net loss. Arthur Andersen, which
had been WorldCom's auditor, also audited Qwest until it was
dismissed this year in favor of KPMG.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest has reported eight straight quarterly losses and is trying
to pay down $26.4 billion in "junk"-rated debt. It also has
eliminated 13,000 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Notebaert, who replaced Joseph Nacchio this month, is trying to
sell the company's directory publishing unit by year's end to avoid a
loan default. Analysts value the unit at as much as $10 billion.</TE>

<HD>Regulators Feeling Pressure to Aggressively Pursue Fraud</HD>
<DH>Probes: Criticism that the SEC has moved too slowly against
corporate wrongdoing forces it to take immediate steps.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>WorldCom Inc.'s disclosure of a potentially titanic accounting fraud
ratchets up the pressure on securities regulators and criminal
prosecutors to prove they are taking aggressive steps to punish
executives who break the law.</LD>
<LD>   In a demonstration of that urgency, the Securities and Exchange
Commission filed a civil-fraud lawsuit against WorldCom in U.S.
District Court in Manhattan on Wednesday evening.</LD>
<LD>   It is unusual for the SEC to file a lawsuit so quickly after a
surprise disclosure of accounting irregularities. The agency normally
launches an in-house investigation and takes months to decide whether
to bring charges.</LD>
<TE>   Still, the SEC already had a head-start in the case: The agency
began a widely reported probe of WorldCom's accounting earlier this
year. But a fresh barrage of criticism that the SEC has moved too
slowly against corporate fraud forced it to act rapidly Wednesday,
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom "will cause the Department of Justice and the SEC to put
on a full-court press in an attempt to weed out the corporate
misfits," said Christopher Bebel, a former prosecutor who now is a
partner at Shepherd Smith &amp; Bebel in Houston. "If they don't, they
know they're going to have to provide a lot of explanation to
Congress."</TE>
<TE>   Key members of Congress on Wednesday renewed their attacks on the
SEC and its embattled chairman, Harvey L. Pitt, even as the House
voted to nearly double the agency's annual budget to $776 million.
Critics say Pitt's long tenure as a lawyer representing many
accounting firms and brokerages before taking over the SEC last fall
has left him unwilling to press those industries for reform.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt struck back at his opponents Wednesday night, saying he was
being unfairly targeted. "I will not stoop to the level of those who
seek to attack a diligent agency for political advantage," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Several experts sided with Pitt, saying he was being made a
scapegoat for deep-seated problems in the accounting industry and
lapsed executive suite ethics.</TE>
<TE>   "What was the guy supposed to do in the last six months?" said
James Cox, a Duke University securities law professor. The attacks
are "totally off-base and undeserved."</TE>
<TE>   In another uncommon action Wednesday, the SEC said it will require
WorldCom to furnish it with a complete report detailing its
accounting irregularities by Monday morning. The report will have to
be done under oath. It marks only the third time in recent history
the SEC has required such a report.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, they're trying to make it look a little more serious
than an ordinary investigation," said Alan Bromberg, a Southern
Methodist University law professor.</TE>
<TE>   The WorldCom revelations also increase the likelihood that the
corporate scandals will result not only in civil suits by the SEC,
but also in criminal prosecutions of some corporate executives--and
in jail time, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt alluded to that possibility in comments Wednesday. "We are
fully partnered with the Department of Justice and the U.S. attorneys
across the country to ensure that where conduct warrants criminal
prosecution, justice will not only be swift it will be maximized,"
Pitt said.</TE>
<TE>   More immediately, the WorldCom case may push the SEC to put more
teeth in its proposal for a new accounting industry oversight board.
Critics say Pitt's proposal, which the SEC recently put out for
public comment, is weaker than a plan passed by the Senate Banking
Committee this month. Some reports Wednesday suggested the White
House may now back the Senate plan.</TE>

<HD>Rite Aid Tells Investors Order Has Been Restored</HD>
<DH>Retailing: Management cites gains, but some shareholders
skeptical after recent indictments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER JACKSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>HARRISBURG, Pa.</DL>
<LD>Rite Aid Corp., facing its shareholders Wednesday after accounting
irregularities led to the indictment of former executives, tried to
reassure investors that the company was on the right path.</LD>
<LD>   Mary Sammons, president and chief operating officer of the
nation's third-largest drugstore chain, said the company had reduced
long-term debt by $2.5 billion, improved its cash flow and
strengthened its portfolio by closing 168 unprofitable stores and
opening, acquiring or improving dozens of others during its fiscal
year ended March 2.</LD>
<LD>   "Rite Aid is a stronger company today than it was a year ago,"
Sammons said.</LD>
<TE>   The company also announced the naming of a new chief financial
officer and other senior management changes. Chris Hall, 37, was
promoted to CFO from chief accounting officer.</TE>
<TE>   Shareholders showed a mixture of skepticism due to the indictments
and hope that the current managers, including Bob Miller, chairman
and chief executive since December 1999, are turning the company
around.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Miller has given me hope. I believe he's an honest man," said
Justine Burmeister of Toms River, N.J. But Burmeister and her
husband, William, both retirees in their 70s, also echoed other
shareholders' anger over an accounting scheme allegedly perpetuated
by previous managers, which forced an earnings restatement that
increased company losses in the mid-1990s by a record $1.6 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't need Al Qaeda to ruin this country. We've got our own
corporate executives doing that," said Edward Ziober, 60, a neighbor
of Camp Hill, Pa.-based drugstore chain and the owner of 4,000 shares
of Rite Aid stock.</TE>
<TE>   The stock, which peaked at more than $50 in 1999, just as the
accounting scandal was coming to light, closed down 13 cents at $2.55
on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, federal prosecutors unveiled a 37-count indictment
charging Martin L. Grass, Rite Aid's former CEO and the son of its
founder; former Chief Counsel Franklin Brown; and former Chief
Financial Officer Franklyn M. Bergonzi with securities fraud,
conspiracy and other offenses. Eric Sorkin, the current executive
vice president for pharmacy services, also was named in the
indictment and was promptly suspended.</TE>
<TE>   Shareholders also demanded explanations for $5.6 million in loans
and payments to top executives.</TE>

<LD>A Senate committee urged the General Accounting Office to investigate
the financial stability of Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corp., a
buyer of agricultural and rural real estate mortgages.</LD>
<LD>   The request comes in the midst of a 40% decline in the company's
stock since April 26. The shares tumbled after a report that the
company, known as Farmer Mac, was mismanaging its debt and stock
option programs.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Sens. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Richard Lugar (R-Ind.)asked the GAO "to
ensure that Farmer Mac's mission continues to be met in a financially
sound manner."</LD>
<TE>   Farmer Mac shares fell 75 cents to close at $26.25 on the NYSE.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Mills Inc. said fiscal fourth-quarter profit fell 61% because
of slower cereal sales and higher costs related to its acquisition of
Pillsbury.</LD>
<LD>   The company still expects earnings per share before unusual items
to rise by almost $1 to $2.60 this year as it introduces products and
completes its combination with refrigerated dough maker Pillsbury.</LD>
<LD>   Net income fell to $57 million, or 15 cents a share, the company
said. Sales increased 76% to $2.32 billion, helped by the October
purchase of Pillsbury.</LD>
<TE>   Excluding costs for the Pillsbury purchase and restructuring the
company's flour business, General Mills would have earned 25 cents a
share, meeting estimates.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Minneapolis-based General Mills rose $1.51 to $44.36 on
the NYSE.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A group of Michigan hotel owners is suing the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, saying more rigorous visa screening since
Sept. 11 has kept them from getting the extra summer workers they
need.</LD>
<LD>   The group filed its suit in U.S. District Court in Detroit after
the average waiting time for the INS to process temporary visa
requests rose from a range of 10 to 14 days before Sept. 11 to a
current average of 60 to 65 days, making it difficult to meet hiring
deadlines.</LD>

<HD>PG&amp;E Wins Round in Bankruptcy Plan</HD>

<BD>Reuters and Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge in San Francisco cleared the way for Pacific Gas &amp;
Electric Co. to appeal a decision that threatened to scuttle its
effort to get out of bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker ruled that the unit of PG&amp;E
Corp. may appeal a decision by a U.S. Bankruptcy judge that the
utility's reorganization plan could not preempt 36 California laws
governing its business. Walker set a hearing on PG&amp;E's appeal for
Aug. 14.</LD>
<LD>   PG&amp;E's plan is competing against a rescue bid by the California
Public Utilities Commission that would keep the company intact and
firmly under state regulations.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, PG&amp;E won preliminary approval from the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission to build a 53.6-mile extension of a natural gas
pipeline that runs from Canada to California's border as part of the
company's effort to secure energy supplies for its power plants.</TE>
<TE>   FERC said that the expansion is needed to transport the fuel to
new gas-fired generators and help alleviate electricity shortages.
The project is subject to environmental review.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three consumer advocacy groups sued to overturn a U.S. rule that
gives auto makers a choice in how they meet a requirement to install
tire-pressure monitors in all vehicles, saying it allows "an inferior
system."</LD>
<LD>   Public Citizen, the Center for Auto Safety and the New York Public
Interest Research Group filed a petition against the Transportation
Department in U.S. appeals court in New York. The rule issued in May
is arbitrary because it lets companies such as General Motors Corp.
and Ford Motor Co. choose effective direct monitors or inferior
indirect systems, they said.</LD>
<LD>   The new rule for cars and light trucks built after Nov. 1, 2003,
was passed in response to 271 highway deaths linked to tread
separations of Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. tires.</LD>

<LD>Salon Media Group Inc., the struggling online magazine, has received
a notice from its auditors expressing substantial doubts about its
ability to continue.</LD>
<LD>   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the firm
said the auditor's opinion was based on its history of losses. The
company, which was formed in 1995 and has won numerous journalism
awards, has never made a profit and recently has suffered steep
declines in ad revenue.</LD>

<HD>Amazon CFO Quitting to Join Electronic Arts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alex Pham</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Warren Jenson, chief financial officer of Amazon.com Inc., said he
will leave the online retailer to join Electronic Arts Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Jenson, 45, will replace Stan McKee, 58, who will retire after 13
years as EA's financial chief. Weeks after Amazon reported a profit
for 2001, its first, Jenson in February announced plans to resign
sometime this year.</LD>
<LD>   Jenson, who was the CFO for NBC between 1992 and 1996, said he
weighed several offers before he settled on Redwood City,
Calif.-based EA, the country's largest video game publisher. Amazon
has yet to name Jenson's replacement.</LD>
<TE>   "We've had discussions with a number of promising candidates and
we're making progress for finding the right person for Amazon," said
Amazon spokeswoman Patty Smith, who declined to say when the
retailer, which is expected to have $3.7 billion in sales this year,
is likely to appoint a new CFO. Jenson's move is a coup for EA, which
has been searching for a successor to McKee for nearly a year.</TE>
<TE>   Before the news was announced, Amazon closed up 51 cents at $15.85
and EA closed up $1.40 to $63.75, both on Nasdaq.</TE>

<LD>Alcatel, Europe's biggest maker of telecommunications equipment,
expects a loss this year as clients cut spending on phone gear and
said it will shed a further 10,000 jobs as part of an expanded
restructuring plan.</LD>
<LD>   The Paris-based company had previously forecast an operating
profit for the year. It also trimmed its sales estimates.</LD>
<LD>   Phone-equipment makers have seen sales plunge as phone companies
such as BT Group cut investments and network operators such as Global
Crossing Ltd. went bust. WorldCom Inc. forecast losses for 2001 and
the first quarter of 2002 after discovering it had inflated profit.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>RealNetworks Inc., which makes software for playing Internet audio
and video, said second-quarter sales will fall short of forecasts,
resulting in a net loss, as customers cut back on purchases of
programs that distribute Web content.</LD>
<LD>   The news, announced after the markets closed, sent the company's
shares down 18% in after-hours trading.</LD>
<LD>   Sales will be $42.5 million to $45 million, down from $47.3
million last quarter, RealNetworks said. The loss will be 1 cent or 2
cents a share. Gross margin, or the percentage of sales left after
production costs are subtracted, will be narrower than expected, the
Seattle-based company said.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts polled by Thomson First Call on average expected a
second-quarter profit of 1 cent a share on sales of $50.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   RealNetworks shares dropped to as low as $3.50, or by 18%, in
extended trading. They had declined 18 cents to $4.29 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares in companies that make hardware for Microsoft Corp.'s Xbox
were mostly lower after chip maker Cirrus Logic Inc. warned of a
revenue shortfall from slack production of the video game console.</LD>
<LD>   Cirrus shares fell 43 cents, or 6.6%, to $6.11 on Nasdaq, after
the company warned that revenue this quarter would be as much as 16%
below guidance because of lower-than-expected sales to Thomson
Multimedia.</LD>
<LD>   Cirrus sells its chips to France's Thomson, which builds them into
the DVD drive for the Xbox.</LD>
<TE>   Thomson denied production was down, saying its Xbox-related orders
have exceeded the contractually mandated production. Microsoft
representatives were not immediately available for comment, nor were
representatives of Cirrus.</TE>
<TE>   Other shares closing lower on Nasdaq after the news were Nvidia
Corp., which makes graphics chips for the Xbox, down $1.10, or 5.2%,
at $20.07, and Flextronics International Ltd., which builds the Xbox,
down 73 cents, or 8.4%, at $7.92. Solectron Corp., which provides

<HD>Kozlowski Facing New Charge</HD>
<DH>Courts: Ex-Tyco CEO, already accused of tax evasion, is
indicted on a count of tampering with evidence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>L. Dennis Kozlowski, the former chief executive of Tyco International
Ltd. who resigned this month after being accused of tax evasion, was
indicted Wednesday on a new charge of tampering with evidence.</LD>
<LD>   Kozlowski, 55, pleaded not guilty to the latest allegation. The
charge is "frivolous," said his lawyer, Stephen Kaufman.</LD>
<LD>   The expanded indictment accuses Kozlowski of removing a phony
shipping document from a file at Tyco's offices in Boca Raton, Fla.,
before the material was delivered to New York prosecutors. Kozlowski
had prepared the false document, the indictment says.</LD>
<TE>   Kozlowski, who made more than $300 million as head of Tyco,
resigned June 3 and was charged a day later with conspiring with
dealers to avoid sales taxes on art he bought for $13.2 million. His
fall was seen by many investors as an extreme example of a chief
executive who used his company for personal gain. Tyco shares have
fallen 79% this year.</TE>
<TE>   After entering his plea before New York State Supreme Court
Justice Michael Obus, Kozlowski made a brief comment. "I'm spending
my time with family and friends," he said when asked what he's doing.</TE>
<TE>   Kozlowski, who remains free on $3 million bail, is charged with
tax violations, tampering with evidence and falsifying business
records in an indictment that now has 14 counts. The tampering charge
is a felony that carries a maximum four-year prison term, the same as
the tax evasion counts.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco spokesman Gary Holmes declined to comment on the new
accusation. Tyco is conducting its own investigation, and Holmes
wouldn't say whether Tyco helped produce the missing document.</TE>
<TE>   "We're cooperating fully with the D.A.'s investigation," Holmes
said. "We're not going to comment on Mr. Kozlowski's personal issues
because they have no impact on Tyco."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Tyco fell $1.58, or 12%, to $11.97 on the New York Stock
Exchange after earlier touching $11.35.</TE>
<TE>   The Bermuda-based conglomerate is the largest maker of electrical
connectors, burglar alarms and undersea fiber-optic cables. Earlier
this month, a person familiar with the situation said the Securities
and Exchange Commission revived an investigation of how Tyco
accounted for acquisitions.</TE>
<TE>   Kaufman declined to say whether he expects the case against
Kozlowski to be expanded again. Authorities have said the
investigation of Kozlowski is continuing.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing I'm dealing with right now is a sales tax case,"
Kaufman said.</TE>
<TE>   The latest charges say Kozlowski removed a document that falsely
reflected the shipment of five paintings from New York to Tyco's U.S.
headquarters in Exeter, N.H.</TE>
<TE>   Kozlowski previously was accused of evading more than $1 million
in New York sales taxes by shipping five empty crates to New
Hampshire in January. Kozlowski's purchases included paintings by
Monet and Renoir.</TE>
<TE>   In another instance, Kozlowski arranged for a painting to be taken
from his Manhattan apartment, shipped to New Hampshire and then
returned to his Manhattan apartment, authorities said.</TE>

<HD>Messier Seeks to Restore Confidence</HD>
<DH>Media: Vivendi chief launches bimonthly calls with analysts
to head off criticism. Many still see his job at risk.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vivendi Universal's chief executive moved Wednesday to restore
investor confidence and save his job as the media giant's shares went
on another roller coaster ride.</LD>
<LD>   After surviving a charged board meeting this week, Jean-Marie
Messier set to work with the first of a series of bimonthly
conference calls with analysts intended to fend off criticism about
his stewardship. He said he had no plans to leave.</LD>
<LD>   "I would be pleased, with the support of the board, shareholders
and stakeholders, to run the company for another 15 years," Messier
told analysts in a conference call.</LD>
<TE>   In another move to take a new tack toward communications, Messier
said he would be prepared to see French shareholder activist Colette
Neuville appointed to the company's board as an independent director.</TE>
<TE>   Neuville has asked a French court to call for an expert inquiry
into corporate governance.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi shares reversed an initial 20% slide in Paris trading,
closing up 7.78%. In New York, Vivendi shares rose 5% to $20.56 on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the resignation of his closest ally on the board, luxury
goods billionaire Bernard Arnault, Messier retained his crown and, it
was reported, fended off efforts by American board members to oust
him.</TE>
<TE>   However, many analysts still believe his job is at risk.</TE>
<TE>   After lowering its debt forecast following Tuesday's board
meeting, Vivendi said Wednesday that it was convinced it could meet
its financial obligations over the next year and that it had $3.21
billion in unused credit lines. It also announced plans for a bond
issue of 1 billion to 2 billion euros this year to replace short-term
debt.</TE>

<HD>WorldCom May Survive After All</HD>
<DH>Outlook: A bankruptcy filing could allow the firm to come
out stronger. Customers are the key.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY, ALEX PHAM and P.J. HUFFSTUTTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite mounting fiscal and legal woes, WorldCom Inc. could emerge
from its current crisis as a leaner and stronger telecommunications
company.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said Wednesday that WorldCom will probably be forced to
file for bankruptcy protection, a move that ordinarily would lead
competitors to buy its assets at fire-sale prices. But problems in
the telecommunications industry are so severe that no one is likely
to want the company.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, WorldCom could remain in operation, cast off unprofitable
units and negotiate better terms from lenders and suppliers, who are
motivated to help the company survive, analysts said.</LD>
<TE>   If it does, the reincarnated WorldCom could push prices for
long-distance phone and data services even lower, intensifying
competition in a market that already has too much capacity and too
many providers.</TE>
<TE>   For WorldCom, the wild cards are its customers, particularly the
large corporations that rely on its phone and data services. If they
run to other carriers, WorldCom is doomed.</TE>
<TE>   "We're concerned, of course," said Suzy Whittenton, chief
financial officer of the Texas Department of Parks and Wildlife,
which has hired WorldCom to create and run a multimillion-dollar
database system for hunting and fishing licenses. "Our staff's
meeting right now to figure out how we'd deal with this if WorldCom
went away."</TE>
<TE>   The telecommunications industry is plagued by too much supply and
not enough demand, said David Passmore, research director for Burton
Group, a network analysis firm. Companies such as WorldCom built
massive networks to move phone calls, e-mails and faxes around the
world, but the pipes are far from full.</TE>
<TE>   "What needs to happen is that half of these companies have to go
away so that the remaining companies can begin to heal themselves,"
Passmore said. "But that's not happening. The assets remain. The
networks don't go away. Someone else will come along and continue to
operate these networks, and that keeps up the price pressure. It's a
difficult situation. That's why we're not going see the end of the
bankruptcies by carriers for some time."</TE>
<TE>   Compounding the situation is a perceived advantage to seeking
Bankruptcy Court protection as a way to wipe a company's slate clean
of debt.</TE>
<TE>   "As each carrier goes bankrupt, they are freed from debt,"
Passmore predicted. "When they emerge from bankruptcy, they can cut
their prices to compete, which drives the next guy into bankruptcy.
There's a domino effect that could happen here."</TE>
<TE>   If the recent experience of Covad Communications Group Inc. and
McLeodUSA Inc. is any guide, WorldCom has reason to be optimistic.
The two telecommunications companies recently went through
bankruptcy, yet both said they held on to virtually all of their
major customers.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom executives said they have no plans to file for bankruptcy
protection or to make any significant changes in their offerings.
Although the company will no longer resell wireless-phone service, it
plans to continue providing long-distance calling, local and
long-distance data and Internet services and international
communications.</TE>
<TE>   "Yesterday's announcement does not affect our customers or our
service," a WorldCom spokeswoman said, referring to Tuesday's
disclosure that the company had mischaracterized $3.9 billion in
expenses as capital improvements. "It really is business as usual."</TE>
<TE>   On the contrary, many analysts said, the announcement is likely to
compound WorldCom's financial troubles. The company had recently
reported a nearly 10% decline in revenue from external customers,
including steep drops in consumer long-distance and small-business
sales.</TE>
<TE>   Its most valuable assets include its high-capacity long-distance
lines and, in numerous cities, local fiber-optic networks that can
link businesses to that long-distance backbone. But on many of the
routes WorldCom serves, fierce competition and rapidly advancing
technology have led to a glut of long-distance capacity and sharply
falling prices.</TE>
<TE>   This bleak industry outlook, combined with the financial hit
WorldCom must take to properly account for its expenses, makes
lenders unlikely to offer the company more credit. Nevertheless, some
financial experts say there is a small chance WorldCom may avoid
bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   "But if creditors can agree to work with the company, it's a lot
faster, cheaper and less complicated to stay out of court," said
Richard Levin, a partner at Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &amp; Flom in Los
Angeles who helped draft the 1978 U.S. Bankruptcy Code.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom also has $4 billion in cash, enough to allow it to
continue operating into early next year, analysts said. It also plans
to cut 17,000 of about 80,000 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Glen Macdonald, a vice president at Adventis Corp.,
a technology consulting firm in Boston, predicted that WorldCom won't
be able to dodge the bankruptcy bullet. "They'll definitely have to
seek bankruptcy protection," he said. "It will send a signal to their
suppliers and customers ... that they'll have time to get their act
together."</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom's banks and equipment suppliers are eager to see the
company stay in business because they'll lose less money that way,
Macdonald said. The key to WorldCom's ability to emerge from
bankruptcy protection, he said, is its ability to hold onto its
customers.</TE>
<TE>   Residential customers could easily switch from WorldCom to AT&amp;T
Corp., Sprint Corp. or another provider, but Macdonald said most
wouldn't change as long as they could continue to make long-distance
calls. And corporate customers aren't likely to switch quickly,
analysts said, because they have long-term contracts with WorldCom or
complex network connections.</TE>
<TE>   "Customers can't flash-cut overnight," Adam Quinton,
telecommunications analyst with Merrill Lynch, said during a
conference call. The question is whether customers find a gradual
exit. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, for example, is
midway into a seven-year contract with WorldCom's MCI subsidiary for
data services related to its automobile-emissions program.</TE>
<TE>   "It's only one program, but it's an important one," said Rich
Kirkpatrick, the department's press secretary. "Though we don't
expect any problems, we do have emergency provisions in place. We're
having meetings about those steps today."</TE>
<TE>   So too was the staff at the Texas Department of Parks and
Wildlife. The team is only one year into a five-year contract with
WorldCom.</TE>
<TE>   "They told us what they knew--the layoffs weren't going to affect
them," Whittenton said. "But that could change, and everyone knows
it."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>First things first: Michael A. Newdow says he is not a nut. He's an
eccentric, for sure, an emergency room physician by training who says
he has given up working to "fight the government," an
envelope-pushing free-thinker who equates believing in God with
believing in Santa Claus.</LD>
<LD>   But Newdow, a 49-year-old single father who lives on the outskirts
of Sacramento, also has an undergraduate degree from Brown
University, a medical degree from UCLA and a law degree from the
University of Michigan.</LD>
<LD>   He has fought repeatedly in court for a strict separation of
church and state. And even foes who find his cause misguided--and all
of a sudden, there are many--might find his resolve impressive. He
estimates that he spent 4,000 hours preparing his own lawsuit arguing
that forcing children to pledge allegiance to "one nation, under God"
is unconstitutional and marginalizes those who are not religious.</LD>
<TE>   And so, on Wednesday morning, when he won in a federal court, and
the collective jaw of the mainstream legal community dropped, Newdow
didn't seem to think anything particularly dramatic had happened.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's a very interesting argument. I think it's an
unquestionable argument," Newdow said. "Could we say we are 'One
nation under Jesus'? Could we say we are 'One nation under David
Koresh'? Or Muhammad? No. And we can't say we are 'one nation under
God.' "</TE>
<TE>   His community, to put it mildly, does not agree.</TE>
<TE>   Within hours of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals' decision, the
national media descended upon Newdow's two-story, upper-middle-class
home, near a crook of the Sacramento River known as "the pocket."</TE>
<TE>   He was quickly forced to buy a second telephone line to his
house--primarily to handle the steady influx of obscene messages and
death threats that were pouring in.</TE>
<TE>   "You atheist bastard," one woman said on the answering machine.
The message was reviewed by a Times reporter.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't like the way this country is, take yourself and your
family and get the hell out," the woman continued. She signed off:
"This is from America."</TE>
<TE>   Another woman recited the Pledge of Allegiance on the machine, and
a man left this message: "I hope you and your daughter go to hell.
People are going to get even. I hope you suffer."</TE>
<TE>   Newdow, standing on the hard-wood floors of his kitchen, amid
children's toys and stuffed animals and a blackboard that said
"ALGAE" in children's writing, was trying to take it all in
stride--even doing the dishes as reporters peppered him with
questions. But he was clearly stunned by the response to his legal
victory.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't prepared," he said, shaking his head. "And I was stupid
not to be prepared."</TE>
<TE>   Except for the toys and the writing scrawled on the blackboard,
there was no sign of Newdow's 8-year-old daughter, who will wrap up
her second-grade year at an area elementary school next week. Newdow
declined to discuss his personal life, though he said he is a single
father who wants to protect his daughter by keeping her identity a
secret.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm fearful for her. I'm worried," he said. "I'll bet there will
be something thrown through my window in the next few days."</TE>
<TE>   Newdow acknowledged that he is, in effect, using his daughter to
support his cause. He said as far as he knows, she stands to recite
the pledge along with her classmates in school.</TE>
<TE>   "This is more about me than her," he said. "I'd like to keep her
out of this."</TE>
<TE>   Most of Newdow's neighbors said they don't support Newdow's cause,
but support his right to fight for it.</TE>
<TE>   "I see no fault in saying 'In God we trust,' " said Melvin
Holland, a house painter who has lived in the neighborhood for 14
years. "To me, it's mind-boggling that he's doing it."</TE>
<TE>   Told about the obscene messages left on Newdow's answering
machine, however, Holland shook his head in disgust.</TE>
<TE>   "That's awful," he said. "Everyone has their right to speak their
piece."</TE>
<TE>   Newdow, although he said he wanted to keep details of his personal
life private, said he was raised in the Bronx, N.Y., and northern New
Jersey. He graduated from Brown University before attending the UCLA
Medical School. He worked as an emergency room physician, then
returned to school and received a law degree from the University of
Michigan. University officials confirmed that Newdow graduated from
the colleges.</TE>
<TE>   The balding Newdow, who often answers the phone with a chirpy
"Yo," said he has always been an atheist, but a Web site advertising
his campaign also describes him as "an average guy."</TE>
<TE>   "What brought me to atheism was the same thing that brought me to
stop believing that there was a Santa Claus," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He was always uncomfortable when asked, along with the rest of the
kids, to recite the Pledge of Allegiance in school, he said. In some
public school classes, he was also forced to pray.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember it bothered me," he said. "I remember wondering why I
had to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Newdow became what he describes as an ordained minister in 1977
through the Universal Life Church, a California organization that has
been attacked by mainstream religious institutions for allowing many
people to become "ministers," regardless of their beliefs. Even
today, the Universal Life Church's Web site advertises that those
interested can become ordained ministers "in less than three
minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Twenty years later, Newdow says, he launched a religious
institution called the First Amendmist Church of True Science, or
FACTS.</TE>
<TE>   Newdow initially filed his lawsuit against then-President Clinton
and Congress while living in the Fort Lauderdale, Fla., area. When he
moved to the Sacramento area in 2000, he said, he lost legal standing
in Florida and had to refile the case in Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   He also filed a related case seeking to prohibit President
Bush--who once named Jesus when asked for the identity of his
favorite political philosopher--from mingling politics and his
Christian beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   In that case, filed in federal court in the Sacramento area,
Newdow cited Bush's inaugural, during which the Rev. Franklin Graham
called upon "the Lord Jesus Christ" for guidance.</TE>
<TE>   Newdow called that a violation of the 1st Amendment, and said the
comments clearly showed the government's preference for Christians.
That effectively excluded and marginalized members of other
religions, Newdow argued.</TE>
<TE>   After federal prosecutors argued that the judicial branch cannot
interfere with the other branches of government--namely, the
executive branch--a U.S. District Court judge dismissed the case this
spring.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue is this: Does government have the right to stick
religion in the midst of a pledge, in the midst of society?" Newdow
said. "Or anywhere?"</TE>

<HD>Pakistani Forces Raid Al Qaeda Hide-Out</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- Acting on a tip from the United States,
Pakistani forces staged a nighttime raid on an Al Qaeda hide-out in a
remote village near the border with Afghanistan, touching off a
four-hour gun battle that killed 10 Pakistani soldiers and at least
two suspected members of the terrorist network, Pakistani officials
said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   A 15-year-old foreign boy was captured after the battle, which
began late Tuesday near the border town of Wana, Pakistani officials
said. However, most of the fighters, believed to be Chechens, escaped
in the darkness early Wednesday, military and police officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The combat deaths were the first suffered by Pakistani forces
charged with flushing out foreign fighters from the rugged, lawless
region. Senior Pakistani officers and analysts predicted that the
gunfight would stiffen the resolve of the Pakistani military, which
U.S. officials earlier this year had to coax into patrolling the
remote border region.</LD>
<TE>   Pakistani army officials estimated that 40 to 45 Al Qaeda fighters
were still hiding in the area, said Pakistani officers reached by
telephone in Wana, a tribal area south of the Afghan town of Khowst
whose leaders have been sympathetic to the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   "The situation is very tense and most people have closed their
shops because of the ongoing search operation in the area," said a
Wana resident, Mohammed Farooq. He said hundreds of troops were
swarming the area looking for Al Qaeda fighters.</TE>
<TE>   Senior American officers in recent weeks had urged Pakistan to
search out Al Qaeda fugitives who U.S. intelligence indicated were
concentrated near Wana.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Special Forces and CIA operatives have been working with
Pakistani forces in searching for Al Qaeda fighters believed to have
taken refuge on the Pakistani side of the border. But Gen. Richard B.
Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters in
Washington that U.S. troops did not participate in the latest battle.</TE>
<TE>   "While U.S. forces were not involved ... we appreciate the
Pakistan army's efforts to locate the Al Qaeda" fighters, he said.</TE>
<TE>   An Interior Ministry official said Pakistani troops found
uniforms, a mortar shell and Al Qaeda papers in the house targeted in
the raid.</TE>

<DL>BUENOS AIRES</DL>
<LD>Two people were killed and at least 90 injured Wednesday as police
fought pitched battles with hundreds of jobless demonstrators trying
to block highways around the Argentine capital.</LD>
<LD>   It was the worst violence since President Eduardo Duhalde took
office in January after riots toppled President Fernando de la Rua.</LD>
<LD>   Demonstrators said dozens of protesters were injured, and they
said police fired on them from rooftops, shops and an elevated
walkway. The claims could not be independently verified. Police said
173 people were arrested.</LD>
<TE>   Masked demonstrators responded to volleys of police tear gas and
rubber bullets with a hail of rocks. The protesters also used
homemade clubs to break shop windows and smash cars. One bus was set
afire, the driver said, after he and passengers were forced off at
gunpoint.</TE>
<TE>   Protests against the government's handling of a protracted
recession have become near-daily events in Argentina since the crisis
exploded in December.</TE>

viewing U.S. spy plane footage of last week's gun battle in which he

navy boats and fishermen in the shark-infested coastal waters have

<HD>Executions Mark Anti-Drug Rallies in China</HD>

<DL>SHANGHAI</DL>
<LD>SHANGHAI -- China marked International Day Against Drug Abuse by
executing 64 people accused of drug crimes, officials and state media
said Wednesday. Other nations staged anti-drug rallies and burned
piles of confiscated narcotics.</LD>
<LD>   Many of the Chinese executions came immediately after public
rallies at which thousands watched as judges condemned the accused
and authorities burned piles of seized heroin, Ecstasy and other
drugs.</LD>
<LD>   China usually marks the day with a wave of publicized executions,
underscoring authorities' belief that harsh punishments are an
effective weapon against drugs. United Nations officials have said
they do not condone the practice.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in Myanmar, the military government torched a pile of
seized drugs and insisted that it was committed to fighting
narcotics, despite international accusations that the junta profits
from the drug trade. At a ceremony in Yangon, the capital,
authorities set ablaze more than 3 tons of opium, 530 pounds of
heroin and nearly 35 million stimulant tablets.</TE>
<TE>   In Afghanistan, President Hamid Karzai participated in an
anti-drug rally at Kabul University.</TE>
<TE>   "Will you fight against drugs?" Karzai asked a group of girls,
their heads covered in bright red scarves. "Yes!" they shouted.</TE>
<TE>   "You are our future," Karzai said, speaking from a dais decorated
with a map of Afghanistan emblazoned with the words "Wheat instead of
drugs." Afghanistan has been a leading producer of opium poppies,
which are used to make heroin, and authorities are trying to persuade
farmers to plant other crops.</TE>

<HD>A Window on N. Korea Opens Up in Soccer Field</HD>
<DH>Asia: North's coverage of the South's advance in the World
Cup is seen as a bid to stress their bond.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>The advance of South Korea's soccer team to the semifinals of the
World Cup before its loss Tuesday to Germany provided more than just
a rousing good time for fans. It also gave North Korea watchers
another window into the isolated Communist regime's mood, mentality
and motivation.</LD>
<LD>   As usual, the North Korean government walked a fine line when
depicting the outside world to its isolated people, say analysts who
make their living poring over the regime's every expression and
gesture.</LD>
<LD>   The coverage of South Korea's surprising ascent to the ranks of
the top four teams suggested a certain shared pride in what fellow
Koreans have accomplished against some of the greatest soccer powers.</LD>
<TE>   By airing on Sunday an edited, hourlong version of South Korea's
victory last week over Italy--a lengthy broadcast by North Korean
standards and narrated, analysts say, quite evenhandedly--the
Communist regime sought to stress the common bond.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got the same faces," said Moon Chung In, a political
science professor here with Yonsei University. "Ultimately blood is
thicker than water."</TE>
<TE>   On the political level, some add, the regime may also want to get
a bit closer to South Korea, given the harder line and "axis of evil"
accusations the North has faced from Washington since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   At one point during the broadcast, a North Korean commentator even
sided openly with the South Korean team after Italian player
Francesco Totti was penalized for faking an injury. "The referee is
correct," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The North's decision to air the Italy match was also significant
in a nation where symbolism and historical precedent are extremely
important. Not only did it show an Asian power beating a Western
power whose roots go back millenniums, analysts say, but it also
created a historical tie with North Korea's own surprising defeat of
Italy in the 1966 World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   In something of a dig, however, there also was a subtle message
that it took the southern cousins 36 years to match the North's own
accomplishment, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea refused to televise the Communist nation's World Cup
triumph.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1966 we were in the peak of the Cold War," said Suh Dong Man,
a political science professor with South Korea's Sangji University.
"Under President Park Chung Hee, it was out of the question."</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's broadcast also acknowledged for the first time on the air
in the North that South Korea is playing co-host to one of the
world's premier sports events. The regime generally has seen any such
accomplishment as a challenge begging for a rebuttal. Thus the North,
which held a World Socialist Youth Festival in 1988 during the Seoul
Olympics, organized the Arirang cultural festival this year to
counter the World Cup glory.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, North Korea's recognition of the South came weeks after
the games started. Still, any recognition is significant, analysts
say, particularly when reinforced by footage of South Korea's modern
stadiums and enthusiastic, well-behaved crowds.</TE>
<TE>   That said, the regime in Pyongyang, the North's capital, was
careful in the broadcast to avoid putting South Korea in too positive
a light, analysts say, lest that highlight its own inadequacies,
start its people thinking or deviate from the official line.</TE>
<TE>   Close-up crowd shots that might show the affluence, individuality
and character of the South Koreans were heavily edited. Although
there were shots of the nation's flag, North Korea also removed the
crowd noise, including the spirited singing of "Great Republic of
Korea."</TE>
<TE>   The North aired South Korea's second-round victory five days after
the fact and a day after the team won its third-round victory against
Spain.</TE>
<TE>   A charitable analysis suggests that North Korea needed the time to
edit the tape and "borrow" the footage from South Korean television
without paying royalties. Another school of thought says the North
waited to see whether the team won the next round before deciding to
air the earlier game.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea may have absolute control over the media, but it still
must compete against word of mouth.</TE>
<TE>   This puts the state in something of a bind. If it doesn't announce
big news events before citizens hear about them, its credibility is
undermined. And South Korean soccer victories are just the sort of
news that travels like wildfire.</TE>
<TE>   "North Korea has steel walls, but they're not that high," said
Park Hak Soon, a North Korea specialist with the Sejong Institute, a
South Korea-funded think tank. "People talk."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say they're now closely watching whether North Korea airs
other South Korean games that clearly show Seoul surpassing the
North's past glory.</TE>
<TE>   It's too early to read too much into this week's broadcast, they
add, or what it says about proposed U.S.-North Korean talks or
North-South relations. The Communist regime hasn't exactly been
forthcoming with Seoul lately on such issues as economic relations,
family reunions or tourism.</TE>
<TE>   Still, for many in South Korea, a bit of light at the end of the
stadium tunnel is welcome.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course North Korea no doubt closely considered the political
impact of this broadcast both internally and vis-a-vis South Korea,"
said Lee Jong Seok, a North Korea specialist with the Sejong
Institute. "Still, I thought their presentation was pretty objective
and friendly."</TE>

<HD>Palestinians Schedule Votes for Presidency, Legislature</HD>
<DH>Mideast: An official says self-interest, not Bush's speech,
led to decision on elections and reforms. Meanwhile, Israelis keep
800,000 under curfew.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERICHO, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Palestinians will elect a president and legislative council in
January, a senior official announced Wednesday just two days after
President Bush made Palestinian statehood contingent on the selection
of new leaders.</LD>
<LD>   Palestinians are moving forward with the elections and government
reforms, which were also announced Wednesday, out of self-interest
and not because of U.S. or Israeli pressure, insisted Saeb Erekat,
the minister for local government.</LD>
<LD>   "Many of you may think: Are we submitting this or saying this in
response to President Bush's speech?" Erekat said during a news
conference here in the only major West Bank city not recently
reoccupied by the Israeli army. "We are saying this in response to
Palestinian needs. We're saying this because we have been working on
this reform for months."</LD>
<TE>   Shortly after Erekat made his announcement, another senior
minister, Nabil Shaath, speaking to reporters in London, said that
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat would run for
reelection. At the moment, Arafat faces no serious challenger,
although a 53-year-old political scientist, Abdel Sattar Qassem, has
announced that he plans to run.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian officials expressed hope that the international
community would pressure Israel to withdraw its troops from
Palestinian areas to allow the reforms to be implemented and the
preparations for the elections to be made.</TE>
<TE>   But the army tightened its grip Wednesday on seven cities and
numerous towns and villages reoccupied in the last week after a pair
of suicide bombings that killed 26 Israelis. About 800,000 residents
remained under curfew. Palestinians reported that troops enforcing a
curfew in the northern West Bank city of Jenin shot to death a
7-year-old boy. The army said it was investigating the incident.</TE>
<TE>   In Hebron, the army said that about 150 Palestinians surrendered
to troops who have surrounded the Palestinian Authority's area
headquarters there.</TE>
<TE>   Writing in the Israeli daily Haaretz, military correspondent Amos
Harel said commanders across the West Bank had been told to "take
your time" and count on staying inside Palestinian-controlled areas
for an extended period.</TE>
<TE>   Erekat said Arafat intends to hold presidential and legislative
elections some time between Jan. 10 and Jan. 20. Municipal elections
will be held in March, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But he stressed that Palestinians would be hard-pressed either to
carry out government reforms or to conduct elections as long as
Israeli troops remain in control of most of the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat had wanted to announce the blueprint for reforms himself,
Erekat noted, but could not do so because he is besieged by Israeli
tanks and troops in his Ramallah headquarters. The task fell to
Erekat "because I am the only Palestinian official who can still
travel from his home to his office," the minister said.</TE>
<TE>   A committee appointed by Arafat has devised a plan to streamline
the security services, strengthen the judiciary and make the
financing of the Palestinian Authority more accountable, and Arafat
has approved the recommendations, Erekat said.</TE>
<TE>   Both the Interior and Finance ministries would be restructured and
"modernized," according to the plan. Security services would be
brought under the Interior Ministry's purview, which would "deal with
the negative phenomena arising from lack of discipline within the
security services," the plan says.</TE>
<TE>   All Palestinian Authority income would be controlled by the
Finance Ministry in an effort to keep closer track of tax receipts,
money from donor countries and other funds.</TE>
<TE>   If implemented, the reforms would represent a sweeping
reorganization of the Palestinian government.</TE>
<TE>   The question is, Erekat said, "will we be allowed to carry out
[these efforts] while [Israeli Prime Minister Ariel] Sharon continues
his endgame of destroying the Palestinian Authority?"</TE>
<TE>   Both Israeli officials and Palestinians who support reforms
expressed doubt that the Palestinian Authority is serious about
implementing the plan. A spokesman for Sharon said that real
political change and elections could come only after Arafat cracks
down on militants.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see how there can be free elections when a reign of
terror rules the streets, when armed gangs dictate the Palestinian
political agenda," said Raanan Gissin, the prime minister's
spokesman. "You can't have reforming elections without reforming the
essence of the Palestinian Authority, when Hamas and Islamic Jihad
are in the streets."</TE>
<TE>   Hussam Khader, a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council and
a dissident leader of Arafat's Fatah movement, said that the plan to
reform the government and hold elections is meant to solidify
Arafat's grip on power.</TE>
<TE>   "This leadership, which is totally against reforms and elections,
now believes in reforms and elections," Khader said. "It believes in
these things only because it feels threatened."</TE>
<TE>   Khader said dissidents and gunmen who have battled Israeli troops
and attacked Israeli civilians are in disarray after nearly two years
of fighting, but that Arafat and his key aides remain firmly in
power.</TE>
<TE>   "Elections will bring out the traditional leadership, the families
to vote for their people," he said. "We're bound to see the return of
the traditional leadership rather than the rise of a progressive, new
leadership."</TE>
<TE>   There is near consensus among Palestinians that Arafat, who has
led the Palestine Liberation Organization for more than three decades
and was elected president of the Palestinian Authority in 1996, will
easily win reelection despite increasingly public criticism of his
policies among his people.</TE>
<TE>   But Erekat said that any Palestinian 35 or older is free to run
for the presidency. He said that any Palestinian political group,
including Hamas and Islamic Jihad, would be welcome to participate.</TE>

<DH>Protests: In contrast to Genoa and Seattle, G-8 activists
in Canada make their point by knitting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CALGARY, Canada</DL>
<LD>It was a far cry from the pitched street battles of Genoa, Italy, and
Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   Sitting quietly in a sunny pedestrian mall, with foreign camera
crews hovering on the peaceful periphery, two dozen
anti-globalization protesters were, quite literally, tending to their
knitting.</LD>
<LD>   The self-styled "revolutionary knitting circle"--a symbolic strike
against Third World sweatshops and First World corporations,
organizer Grant Newfeld explained--was one example of what passes for
radical protest in this conservative oil town as it plays host to the
thousands of journalists, activists and government officials lured
here by the Group of 8 summit in the Kananaskis wilderness 50 miles
to the west.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm skeptical that the G-8 leaders even know what is happening in
the streets here, but I'm hoping that what we do will have some sort
of impact," said Erin Kelly, a young protester from Edmonton, the
province of Alberta's other chief city, as she watched her earnestly
knitting comrades.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier on Wednesday, bicyclists in bright green frog suits
cruised through town--a demonstration meant to evoke what a statement
from the anti-global warming G8 Bike Brigade called "the frightening
and pertinent metaphor" of a frog unwittingly boiled alive in a
gradually heating saucepan.</TE>
<TE>   A more standard anti-G-8 protest marched uneventfully past a
phalanx of police officers downtown with a banner proclaiming:
"Oppose Globalization--Adopt Voluntary Poverty." The day before, in
one piece of street theater that successfully roused world media
attention, demonstrators staged a "nude protest" outside a Gap
outlet, stripping down to undergarments or less to dramatize their
campaign for a boycott of the clothing chain for its alleged
exploitation of cheap labor abroad.</TE>
<TE>   As the helicopter gunships clattering overhead made clear,
Canadian security services came here prepared to confront far more
obstreperous protesters--as well as possible terrorist attacks. The
Royal Canadian Mounted Police distributed pamphlets to Calgary
shopkeepers advising them how to cope with pepper spray ("don't rub
your eyes") and tear gas ("get into the fresh air as soon as
possible"). The airport, the convention hall that houses the G-8
media center, and the Kananaskis summit site itself were all ringed
with emergency fencing patrolled by heavily armed police and army
personnel.</TE>
<TE>   In the high plains and rocky peaks west of Calgary, in what
Canadian officials called their biggest domestic military operation
since World War II, thousands of soldiers have dug in, creating
temporary bunkers and guard posts on paved roads and back-country
trails and blocking overland access to the remote summit lodge. Their
commander, Brig. Gen. Ivan Fenton, told the Calgary Herald that his
troops had permission to use "lethal force" against anyone trying to
breach these defenses.</TE>
<TE>   All commercial and private aircraft were banned from the skies
over Calgary and Kananaskis for the duration of the two-day meeting,
but the Canadian military wasn't taking any chances: F-16s
crisscrossed the protected airspace Wednesday, while a battery of
surface-to-air missiles stood ready in the woods outside the lodge
where the leaders were discussing everything from Palestinian
elections to the euro exchange rate.</TE>
<TE>   But with the exception of a pair of demonstrators arrested early
Wednesday in a scuffle outside a McDonald's, the Calgary protesters
have been scrupulously peaceful and law abiding, local authorities
say. Much of the anti-G-8 activity has been confined to sober
counter-conferences on economic development strategies for Africa and
other poor regions. After the city of Calgary refused to grant
permits for mass rallies in local parks, Canadian organizers arranged
for parallel protests in Ottawa on Wednesday and today, deliberately
reducing the influx of demonstrators here.</TE>
<TE>   The demonstrations Wednesday in Canada's capital were larger and
more raucous than the protests here, with activists burning American
flags outside the U.S. Embassy, dancing naked in front of the
Parliament building and hurling golf balls at police cars, according
to news reports.</TE>
<TE>   At a border post south of Calgary, meanwhile, Canadian authorities
announced that they had arrested two unidentified U.S. citizens who
they said had crossed into Canada illegally Wednesday after being
denied entry Tuesday night. "The individuals are believed to have
been entering Canada to attend G-8-related protests and were found to
be in possession of gas masks and graffiti equipment," the Canadian
government said.</TE>

<HD>Sharon Genocide Suit Dismissed in Belgium</HD>
<DH>Justice: Israeli leader cannot be tried in absentia for
1982 massacre, court rules.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>BRUSSELS</DL>
<LD>A court here threw out a genocide suit against Ariel Sharon on
Wednesday, ruling that his absence from Belgium means the Israeli
prime minister cannot be prosecuted over a 1982 massacre of
Palestinian refugees in Lebanon.</LD>
<LD>   Survivors of the Beirut camp massacre had pursued Sharon--who was
Israeli defense minister at the time--under a Belgian law empowering
courts here to try suspects on charges of crimes against humanity and
genocide, no matter where they allegedly were committed.</LD>
<LD>   Israel, whose relations with Brussels were soured by the case
filed a year ago, hailed the ruling as a triumph of "law over
politics." Some legal experts said the decision leaves Belgium's
sweeping human rights law all but impotent if suspects live abroad.</LD>
<TE>   The verdict makes it unlikely that similar complaints in Belgium
against international figures--including Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat, Cuban President Fidel Castro and Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein--can be successful, said Jan Wouters,
director of the Institute of International Law at the University of
Leuven.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians, hundreds of whose relatives were killed by
Israeli-backed Lebanese Christian militiamen in the Sabra and Shatila
camps, nevertheless vowed to keep after Sharon. The plaintiffs'
lawyers said they would take the case to Belgium's Supreme Court of
Appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "We will never give up our attempts and demands that Sharon must
be prosecuted for his crimes," Palestinian Cabinet minister Imad
Falouji said in the Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon made no immediate comment.</TE>

<HD>A Vision for Peace--After 28 Drafts</HD>
<DH>Speech: Bush's call for new Palestinian leadership followed
18th version--and reports that Arafat had paid a group linked to
attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT and TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The speech was drafted, redrafted and then worked over again and
again--28 times in all before President Bush finally delivered his
vision for achieving peace in the Middle East.</LD>
<LD>   The drafts varied widely. Version 11 opened with a dramatic--some
officials later called it inflammatory--description of a young girl
in a Jewish settlement hunted down and killed by a Palestinian
gunman. U.S. diplomats in the Middle East urgently pressed for
changes to the anecdote. Revisions were made. Then it disappeared
completely, according to U.S. officials who monitored the evolution
of the speech Bush gave Monday in the Rose Garden.</LD>
<LD>   The president's most provocative and controversial idea--to
abandon Yasser Arafat and call for new Palestinian leadership--didn't
show up in the speech until late last week, even though the idea had
permeated the often intense debate among Bush's foreign policy team
for weeks.</LD>
<TE>   In the end, the president's deep feelings about the war on
terrorism, his own morality and the swift U.S. success in ending the
Taliban's rule in Afghanistan heavily shaped the new
initiative--almost as much as the situation on the ground in the
Middle East, according to U.S. officials.</TE>
<TE>   "This speech would have been dramatically different if it had been
made before Sept. 11," said a State Department official who saw
several versions. Officials willing to discuss the speech requested
anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   What happened between the speech's first version and the last
tells a great deal about Bush's world view, his decision-making and
the divisions within his administration, U.S. officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "This speech is very much a product of how the president looks at
the world, based on two core ideas. The first is the idea of freedom
wrapped into human rights, democracy, economic freedom and individual
potential. The second is fighting terrorism," an administration
official said.</TE>
<TE>   The president's imprint is reflected in the key changes that
occurred during the speech's evolution, which resulted in a virtual
policy reversal.</TE>
<TE>   Central to the first version, drafted at the State Department,
were proposals for a U.S.-hosted international conference to generate
momentum so that the leaders of Israel and the Palestinian Authority
would focus on peace rather than confrontation, U.S. officials say.</TE>
<TE>   But that approach faded as Vice President Dick Cheney and Defense
Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld joined the debate and offered strong
arguments mirroring the Israeli position that Arafat, the Palestinian
Authority president, is unable to make peace. Their view overpowered
the approach advocated by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell.
Increasingly, the White House's National Security Council, headed by
Condoleezza Rice, took over drafting the text.</TE>
<TE>   The final draft, polished by chief White House speech writer Mike
Gerson and Deputy National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley, had no
mention of the conference. And Arafat was targeted for political
retirement.</TE>
<TE>   "We started the process based on a premise that there were two
partners in the peace process and the efforts centered on how to get
over their lack of trust," said the State Department official. "We
ended up with the premise that there is only one partner and we can't
move forward until we find a new second partner."</TE>
<TE>   The about-face happened after version 18, the last draft seen by
U.S. diplomats in the region. It had no reference to the demand for
new Palestinian leadership, now the crux of Bush's plan for an
independent Palestinian state and Middle East peace.</TE>
<TE>   So several top U.S. envoys said they were surprised--some
appalled--by what they finally heard Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Some last-minute intelligence basically sealed Arafat's fate for
Bush. The information reported that Arafat had authorized a payment
of $20,000 to the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a faction linked to his
Fatah movement that has claimed responsibility for suicide bombings
against Israelis, a senior administration official with Bush in
Canada at this week's summit of top industrial nations confirmed
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The information was relayed as Bush held daily deliberations with
his top advisors last week. It coincided roughly with a June 19
bombing that killed seven Israelis. The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade
claimed responsibility for the blast, which followed by a day a bus
bombing carried out by another Palestinian group that killed 19
Israelis. Both attacks visibly angered the president, U.S. officials
say.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that the president was to give this speech in a context
in which violence had erupted did confirm for the president--confirm
for all of us--the need for a change in [Palestinian] leadership,"
the senior administration official said.</TE>
<TE>   The intelligence reports, however, came from both Israeli and U.S.
services--with somewhat different interpretations, according to
well-placed sources who asked to remain anonymous. The version the
president accepted reflects his mind-set--and why he opted to strike
out in a new direction.</TE>
<TE>   One version of the intelligence came from Israeli officials, who
in recent months have often rolled out documents they claim show
Arafat's ongoing ties to terrorism. They presented "very specific
information" about Arafat at a hastily organized meeting at the White
House last week, said a Middle East source who asked to remain
anonymous.</TE>
<TE>   The other version came from U.S. intelligence, which picked up a
conversation last week between two Palestinians in which one told the
other that Arafat had approved a $20,000 payment to a person
representing Al Aqsa. It was not specified what the payment was for.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials concluded that the information was not
definitive--and hardly a smoking gun. It was not clear that the
people in the conversation had the authority to represent Arafat. It
also was not clear that money was actually transferred.</TE>
<TE>   "Those close to the issue felt it didn't tell us anything new and
was only more evidence of a problem that is complex and difficult to
resolve," said the State Department official. "But for some folks
newer to the issue, it was what this intelligence could mean if you
took it far enough."</TE>
<TE>   In Bush's view, the intelligence strengthened the position
advocated by Cheney and Rumsfeld that it was time to look for new
Palestinian leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Also, in the aftermath of the U.S. role in Afghanistan, the idea
of ousting a well-entrenched leader didn't seem untenable, U.S.
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "Regime change is a nasty business, and the United States hadn't
done it for a long time. Afghanistan and getting rid of the Taliban
influenced the thinking about what was possible," said the State
Department source.</TE>
<TE>   The president's thinking "crystallized" and the debate basically
ended, according to an administration official. Bush's foreign policy
team had scheduled another round of talks over the weekend, but with
the president having taken a stand, the session was canceled.</TE>
<TE>   The only remaining issue was finding a lull in the bloodshed that
would allow Bush to deliver his Rose Garden speech.</TE>
<TE>   Wright reported from Washington and Wilkinson from Jerusalem.</TE>

<HD>Allies Step Away From Bush's Arafat Stance</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: While the president holds his ground, others at
G-8 summit in Canada say leadership issue should be left to
Palestinians.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG and WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>CALGARY, Canada</DL>
<LD>One by one, the United States' closest allies distanced themselves
Wednesday from President Bush's campaign to rid the Palestinians of
their current leadership, as uncertainties about the Middle East
shadowed the Group of 8 summit conference.</LD>
<LD>   The president made his point anew Wednesday, threatening in a
comment to reporters to withhold U.S. financial support for the
Palestinian government if it does not clean up corruption.</LD>
<LD>   As the leaders of seven major industrial nations and Russia met in
the lodge of a resort in the Rocky Mountains 50 miles west of
Calgary, the attention being devoted to the Middle East overtook much
of the formal agenda: the still-struggling global economy and the war
on terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   Even British Prime Minister Tony Blair, so often the most reliable
of U.S. partners, distanced himself slightly from U.S. policy, while
making clear that Palestinians would pay a price if they failed to
elect new leaders in elections scheduled for January.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a question of saying we're going to tell people who they
elect or not elect--that's for them," Blair said. "But it's for us to
say the consequences of electing people who aren't serious
negotiating partners is that we can't move this forward."</TE>
<TE>   As much as Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, the summit host,
has insisted that he would keep the focus on his limited
agenda--particularly aid to Africa, the topic for the closing
discussions today--Bush set the public agenda Monday when he said a
change in the Palestinian leadership was necessary for peace in the
Middle East, a course widely seen as aimed at removing Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat from power.</TE>
<TE>   Chretien offered the only public statement of support for Bush's
position. On Tuesday, as summit participants were arriving, Chretien
said Arafat's removal from power "might be a good thing."</TE>
<TE>   But Wednesday, Chretien's top aides backed away from the prime
minister's comment, telling journalists here that Canada views Arafat
not as a terrorist but as "the leader of the Palestinian people." If
new elections were held in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, "we would
accept the verdict of the Palestinian people," said a senior Canadian
official, who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   And French President Jacques Chirac said, "It is naturally up to
the Palestinian people, and to them alone, to choose their
representatives."</TE>
<TE>   The issue is a particularly sensitive one in Europe, where many
leaders find themselves caught between supporting U.S. policy in the
Middle East and being responsive to constituents' concerns over
Israel's treatment of Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Among the apparent side effects of Bush's speech Monday was the
last-minute decision of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to not
attend the summit. He had been scheduled to take part as a member of
a delegation of African leaders who are joining the meetings today.</TE>
<TE>   This summit is perhaps more low-key, more isolated and more
heavily protected than any of the 27 that have preceded it.</TE>
<TE>   Barricades across mountain roads are keeping all but officials,
security agents and limited numbers of aides far from Kananaskis, the
ski village where the Group of 8 is meeting. Among the tall pines and
spindly beech trees, a battery of surface-to-air missiles was
deployed under camouflage nets near several beaver ponds.</TE>
<TE>   Demonstrators took to the streets in Calgary, carrying out their
protests with none of the turmoil that disrupted other summits in
recent years. When the G-8 met last July in Genoa, Italy, one
demonstrator was killed by police, tear gas filled the city's old
streets and the leaders were largely confined to their meeting site.</TE>
<TE>   The G-8 is made up of the United States, Britain, Canada, France,
Germany, Italy, Japan and Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Meeting beneath 9,000-foot rocky peaks still bearing the winter's
snows, the summit leaders focused during their private sessions on
economic issues, trade and terrorism, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "People think that the economy is in a stronger position globally
this year than it was when the G-8 met last year," White House Press
Secretary Ari Fleischer said. Indeed, the U.S. economy is no longer
in recession, but Japan's has been stagnant for years and the
European economies are struggling to show even anemic growth.</TE>
<TE>   The group reached a broad agreement on a 10-year plan under which
the U.S. would contribute $10 billion and the European Union and
Japan together another $10 billion to help Russia clean up nuclear
weapons sites and secure its remaining nuclear material, a senior
Bush administration official said. However, differences over
guidelines for keeping track of the money delayed completion of the
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   In meetings, Bush defended his decision to impose heightened
tariffs on imported steel, another senior aide to the president said.
That course has put him at odds with his efforts to reduce such
barriers to free trade around the world.</TE>
<TE>   The Sept. 11 attacks introduced terrorism as a central topic on
the summit agenda.</TE>
<TE>   The eight nations agreed on several steps intended to make
international transportation more secure. These include establishing
standards for travel documents and other information used to track
international passengers, and moving to increase the security of
cargo containers.</TE>
<TE>   They agreed to increase screening of passengers and cargo but
established no specific processes.</TE>
<TE>   Moving beyond Russia's de facto acceptance in the summit club in
recent years, the leaders announced that Russia would be the host of
the 2006 meeting, bestowing on it formal acceptance in the unofficial
organization.</TE>
<TE>   "Russia has demonstrated its potential to play a full and
meaningful role in addressing the global problems that we face," the
group said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   But it was the Middle East that swirled about the talks--just as
it has during numerous previous summits. The first time Canada was
the host of a summit, in 1981, Israel had just sent fighter jets to
blow up a nuclear reactor in Iraq, and growing tensions in the region
dominated the conference.</TE>
<TE>   In public Wednesday, Bush spoke of little but the Middle East and
the emerging financial scandal involving the WorldCom
telecommunications company. The closed-door topics of the summit drew
little attention.</TE>
<TE>   During remarks to reporters at the start of a meeting with Blair,
Bush said that if Palestinians hold elections in January and Arafat
is again chosen as the leader of the Palestinian Authority, he would
hold to his demand "that there needs to be change."</TE>
<TE>   "If people are interested in peace, something else has got to
happen," he said. " ... If their leadership is compromised by terror,
we won't be on the path to peace."</TE>
<TE>   "I've got confidence in the Palestinians, when they understand
fully what we're saying, that they'll make right decisions as to how
we get down the road for peace," the president said.</TE>
<TE>   As for judging whether the Palestinians meet his demand for
reform, he said that decision would be made by "the free world, the
people that are going to be asked to put up money. Listen, I can
assure you we won't be putting money into a society which is not
transparent and [is] corrupt. And I suspect other countries won't,
either."</TE>
<TE>   The United States' aid contributions to Palestinians are already
limited, but the administration exerts strong influence over funding
decisions by international organizations.</TE>
<TE>   British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw had said in London on Tuesday
that his nation would work with Arafat if he was reelected, seeming
to set Britain apart from the United States.</TE>
<TE>   With their knees almost touching, Blair kept some policy distance
from the president, saying, "It's for the Palestinians to elect the
people that they choose to elect."</TE>
<TE>   However, he said, progress demands negotiations among those who
are serious about security and political reform.</TE>
<TE>   The summit appeared to have achieved a degree of the informality
that was envisaged for the meetings when they began in 1975 as a
gathering where the leaders of the six largest industrial democracies
could discuss common economic issues.</TE>
<TE>   Cabinet-level aides were not invited this year, a summit-ending
communique will not be issued, and the leaders were not planning to
hold a news conference when they concluded their sessions at midday
today.</TE>
<TE>   Chretien limited each delegation to no more than 25 officials. But
downsizing G-8 style still means a group of nearly 250, with the EU
sending representatives. The collection of presidents, prime
ministers and one chancellor--Gerhard Schroeder of Germany--were
housed under one roof.</TE>
<TE>   An official could walk down a hotel hallway and cross through the
American, British and French neighborhoods, each delineated with a
flag.</TE>
<TE>   "You have leaders literally bumping into each other, talking
informally," Fleischer said.</TE>

<HD>Russia Finds Ex-Spy Guilty of Treason</HD>
<DH>Courts: Oleg Kalugin, now living in the U.S., calls verdict
revenge by the KGB's old guard.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Seven years after he left his homeland to write about espionage,
hobnob with ex-CIA officials and live in the Washington area--where
he once was the acting KGB chief--retired Russian Maj. Gen. Oleg
Kalugin was convicted of treason here Wednesday and sentenced in
absentia to 15 years in prison.</LD>
<LD>   It was one of the few cases since the fall of the Soviet Union in
which a trial was conducted in absentia, and it was seen here as a
sign of how much Kalugin is detested by some of his former KGB
colleagues for allegedly spilling the agency's secrets in the West.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to imposing the prison sentence, the court stripped
Kalugin of his military rank and the state honors he acquired during
the years he ran the KGB's counter-intelligence department.</LD>
<TE>   "A triumph of Soviet-style justice," Kalugin said of the verdict
in a telephone interview with The Times from the United States. "This
was a case of political retribution and revenge, carried out by the
KGB old guard, who are now back in power."</TE>
<TE>   Kalugin pointed out that his conviction came only a day after
Russia's Supreme Court upheld the treason conviction of a military
journalist who reported on the Russian navy's dumping of nuclear
waste, a case that has perturbed human rights advocates.</TE>
<TE>   The conviction was greeted with frank delight by Vladimir A.
Kryuchkov, the hard-line head of the KGB from 1988 to 1991 who helped
organize the unsuccessful coup against then-Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev in 1991. In a rare interview, Kryuchkov called his onetime
subordinate a "sheer traitor."</TE>
<TE>   "He betrayed our motherland, which he--as a KGB officer--was
supposed to treasure and protect.... He rejected and betrayed all
those things that he owed his motherland. He also betrayed his former
friends and colleagues, who worked shoulder to shoulder with him,"
Kryuchkov said.</TE>
<TE>   The court ruled that Kalugin's activities are "harmful to Russia's
national security" and that he has provided classified information to
the United States. The court also found that Kalugin published
secrets about a series of past actions by Soviet intelligence meant
to discredit the CIA, the director of the FBI and U.S.
counterintelligence services.</TE>
<TE>   The charges were based on information in Kalugin's book, "The
First Directorate: My 32 Years in Intelligence and Espionage Against
the West," published in the U.S. in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Kalugin left the KGB in 1990 and publicly condemned the
organization as a menace that needed to be dismantled. He came under
increased scrutiny with the 2000 election of Russian President
Vladimir V. Putin, himself an ex-KGB officer, which raised the
political standing at home of the KGB and its domestic successor
agency, the FSB.</TE>
<TE>   FSB chief Nikolai P. Patrushev told a reporter in March that
Kalugin had caused "colossal damage" to the Russian intelligence
service, apparently referring to Kalugin's testimony last year in the
Florida espionage trial of retired U.S. Army Col. George Trofimoff,
who was convicted of spying for Russia and the Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   Kalugin, who said he appeared only reluctantly at that trial,
maintains that his testimony was not crucial to the prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   In the decision Wednesday, the court dismissed the treason charges
related to Kalugin's testimony at the Trofimoff trial, saying it did
not have access to the U.S. court transcripts.</TE>
<TE>   Court-appointed defense lawyer Yevgeny Baru said he intends to
contest Kalugin's sentence. But in his telephone interview, Kalugin
made it clear that he has no intention of returning voluntarily to
what he called "Putin's Russia."</TE>
<TE>   Kalugin said some prominent figures in the U.S. are appealing to
Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft to grant him citizenship. "If it happens, I
will be truly happy."</TE>
<TE>   Kalugin first went to the U.S. as a Fulbright scholar after having
been recruited by the KGB; he later worked as a Radio Moscow
correspondent in New York in the early 1960s. From 1965 to 1970, he
was officially press secretary of the Soviet Embassy in Washington
but actually was its acting KGB chief and ran a network of anti-U.S.
spies.</TE>
<TE>   Recalled to Moscow, Kalugin quickly rose in the KGB hierarchy,
becoming the organization's youngest general and head of foreign
counterintelligence. He was put in charge of disseminating
disinformation about the West and managing high-level defectors. The
decision to try Kalugin in absentia came after he refused a summons
given him by the Russian Embassy in Washington to return to his
homeland. The legal code that allows trials in absentia in extreme
cases is being replaced July 1, and such proceedings will be
abolished.</TE>

<HD>Washington Extends an Olive Twig to China With Military
Visit</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: High-level Pentagon official meets with army
chiefs, another small step toward reviving ties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHING-CHING NI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>A high-level Pentagon official met with army commanders here
Wednesday in an effort to resurrect U.S.-Chinese military contacts,
taking another baby step on the road to better ties after last year's
spy plane crisis.</LD>
<LD>   Peter Rodman, assistant defense secretary for international
security affairs, came to Beijing on the heels of last month's visit
to Washington by Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao, the heir apparent
to China's top post.</LD>
<LD>   Hu's meeting with Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld at the
Pentagon appeared to signal that a better U.S.-Chinese military
relationship was on the horizon.</LD>
<TE>   Rodman met with Vice Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing and a
high-ranking general in the People's Liberation Army, Xiong Guangkai,
according to the U.S. Embassy. Rodman is expected to confer today
with Defense Minister Gen. Chi Haotian.</TE>
<TE>   "The talks dealt candidly with problems that had arisen in the
past," the embassy said in a statement. "No agreement was intended to
be reached on this visit."</TE>
<TE>   The former Cold Warriors were never cozy, but the relationship
suffered a serious blow last year after a U.S. surveillance plane
collided with a Chinese fighter jet off the southern Chinese coast,
killing the Chinese pilot.</TE>
<TE>   After that, already limited military contacts, from academic
conferences to student exchanges and military installation tours,
became even more rare.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, a U.S. warplane accidentally bombed the Chinese Embassy
in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, putting a damper on already lukewarm ties
then.</TE>
<TE>   Washington's focus on the war on terrorism may have deflected
attention from a perceived Chinese threat. But Washington wants
Beijing to show more reciprocity if it is to become a true partner.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has long complained that Chinese military
officials don't offer the same degree of access and openness as the
Americans during their exchanges. Beijing argues, however, that such
access isn't possible until the two are on a more level playing
field.</TE>
<TE>   "America is so strong; China is so weak. How can you demand total
equality?" asked Xia Yishan, senior research fellow at the China
Institute of International Studies here. "America has more than 6,000
nuclear warheads. China has a few more than 20. How can you talk
about equal openness?"</TE>
<TE>   But the main obstacle between the two countries remains their
differences over Taiwan.</TE>
<TE>   Beijing considers the island a renegade province that China could
take back by force if necessary. The Bush administration, however,
has pledged to defend the island if it is attacked.</TE>
<TE>   Until the two see eye to eye on this volatile issue, Chinese
observers say, it's hard to be too optimistic about future relations.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope America can help facilitate a peaceful resolution to the
issue of Taiwan," Xia said. "If they can take a step in that
direction, it would do more than anything else in advancing
U.S.-China relations."</TE>

<HD>WorldCom Hit With Federal Fraud Lawsuit</HD>
<DH>Scandal: The action aims to prevent internal abuses. The
stock market is jolted, then recovers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. HUFFSTUTTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amid shock waves from the WorldCom Inc. accounting scandal that
rocked corporate America on Wednesday, federal investigators slapped
the nation's second-largest long-distance company with a civil fraud
lawsuit to prevent it from disposing of assets, destroying documents
and paying off senior officers.</LD>
<LD>   In a measure of the scandal's growing effect, the Securities and
Exchange Commission said it has accelerated plans to force chief
executives and financial officers to guarantee financial statements,
making them potentially liable if the data are found to be
fraudulent. The certifications would be required of the nation's
1,000 largest corporations by Aug. 15, the agency said.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of major banks and many telecommunications firms were hit
hard Wednesday over concerns that the accounting and debt woes of the
Clinton, Miss.-based WorldCom would cause broad economic harm.
WorldCom's bonds plummeted to as little as 11 cents on the dollar,
and major New York banks saw their stocks skid over concerns that
they stand to lose billions on shrinking WorldCom bonds.</LD>
<TE>   Though the overall market dropped sharply in the morning, much of
its loss was erased by the close of trading--a recovery explained by
some market watchers as a result of the declining shock value of
corporate scandals on Wall Street traders.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom disclosed Wednesday that it had improperly accounted for
$3.9 billion in expenses over the last five quarters, showing that it
was earning significant profit at a time it was losing hundreds of
millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush branded the news as "outrageous." Lawmakers said it
underscored a new urgency in Washington to strengthen federal
oversight of corporate accounting and governance. Members of Congress
said the WorldCom disclosures put pressure on them to produce
legislation cracking down on corporate misdeeds.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the WorldCom crisis creates a new crunch on the
already besieged SEC, and pushes the Justice Department to bring more
criminal cases against executives whose companies are accused of
fraud.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom, meanwhile, appeared headed for a bankruptcy that could
allow it to emerge as a healthier player in an industry of weak and
damaged rivals.</TE>
<TE>   But after a season of seemingly endless corporate corruption, the
damage caused by WorldCom's disclosure is not only a financial blow.
Wall Street watchers said it has further solidified the public's
mistrust of the business world, and convinced many that the days of
"ethical" Fortune 500 companies are long gone.</TE>
<TE>   "WorldCom's future depends on the faith that its creditors put
into it," said Michael Hodel, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. in
Chicago. "This fraud wipes out the majority of faith that any
creditor has in this company."</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom's acknowledgment that it inflated profit could lend
credence to the idea of systemic problems requiring more sweeping
action. Bush told reporters Wednesday at an annual economic meeting
that the federal government would begin taking a far more aggressive
approach to companies engaging in such practices.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some concerned about the validity of the balance sheets
of corporate America, and I can understand why," Bush said on the
opening day of the Group of 8 economic summit in Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) promised, as the first
order of business after the July 4 recess, to bring to the Senate
floor legislation that would increase oversight of auditors and make
corporate officers more accountable for the accuracy of their
companies' financial statements. He predicted that it would easily
win Senate approval.</TE>
<TE>   The House voted Wednesday to authorize nearly a doubling of the
SEC budget, from $481 million in Bush's proposed budget to $776
million for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, launched an investigation into WorldCom's
restatement of earnings and losses, suggesting the case was "eerily
similar to the accounting hocus-pocus that occurred at Enron."</TE>
<TE>   Hours after the vote, the SEC filed its civil suit against
WorldCom in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New
York.</TE>
<TE>   "By improperly transferring certain costs to its capital accounts,
WorldCom falsely portrayed itself as a profitable business during
2001 and the first quarter of 2002," according to the civil
complaint. "This improper accounting action was intended to
manipulate WorldCom's earnings.... WorldCom violated the anti-fraud
and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws and, unless
restrained and enjoined by this Court, will continue to do so."</TE>
<TE>   The civil complaint filed against WorldCom points out that the
firm reported its operating earnings were nearly $2.4 billion in
2001--when in reality it had "suffered a loss of approximately $662
million." The suit later states that WorldCom reported in its federal
filings for the first quarter of 2002 that the telecom company's
operating earnings were $240 million, rather than post the actual
loss of about $557 million.</TE>
<TE>   Just a few months ago, consumers were bombarded with a WorldCom
advertising campaign that touted its hook into "Generation D," the
"digital generation" of business and life that was interconnected
with technology.</TE>
<TE>   The pitch was that WorldCom was hip and cool, and showed young
workers zipping along corporate hallways with carefree joy as they
pondered the ventures WorldCom was focusing on--Internet services,
Web hosting and international business.</TE>
<TE>   But industry watchers said the light-hearted tone of the ad
campaign masked the very serious accounting maneuvers that hid
WorldCom's financial troubles, which paralleled the
telecommunications industry slump.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts expect telecommunication equipment companies to take
another hit if WorldCom no longer is a customer. Though some vendors
that supply equipment to the troubled telecom firm said the effect of
WorldCom's cutbacks would be minimal, many saw their shares fall in
trading Wednesday, among them Lucent Technologies Inc., Nortel
Networks Corp. and Juniper Networks Inc. Stock prices also slumped
for some Baby Bell phone companies and even the advertising companies
that handled WorldCom's campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "The WorldCom accounting scandal is pretty much the last thing the
doctor could have ordered right now," said John Wilson, an analyst at
RBC Capital Markets.</TE>
<TE>   Terrified of losing customers, WorldCom's top executives spent
much of Wednesday speaking to the large commercial clients of its
WorldCom group operation, said spokesman Brad Burns. The unit caters
to the voice and data needs of commercial customers, and the revenue
generated last year accounted for two-thirds of the company's sales.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive John W. Sidgmore and Chief Operating Officer
Ronald R. Beaumont personally handled calls to customers, Burns said.
"They've received very good support," he said. "That's obviously
positive for us."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, WorldCom's MCI unit serves local and long-distance
needs of up to 20 million consumers and small businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Many of these smaller customers, as well as the vendors who supply
WorldCom with the equipment that run its data networks, complained
that WorldCom officials had kept them in the dark.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd think that, given the news, someone in a glass office would
have sent out an official memo or e-mail to everyone," said an
executive at a Silicon Valley high-tech firm that supplies equipment
to WorldCom. "You'd think that they'd care about making us feel good
about their future. Why is the only information we're getting coming
from rumor we're hearing from the people who are handling our
contract?"</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to curb the potential for fraud, SEC officials said they
would enact emergency powers to force chief executives and chief
financial officers to "certify" that quarterly and annual reports are
truthful and complete. The executives would have to sign a section of
the reports attesting to the accuracy of the information and to their
personal familiarity with it.</TE>
<TE>   Securities law experts said current laws require executives to
release accurate and thorough information. But the proposed rule
would make it tougher for them to hide behind claims of ignorance,
experts said. If they are held directly accountable for corporate
reports, CEOs and CFOs could be exposed to heightened--and
personal--legal liability should problems arise at their companies,
legal experts said.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC had been considering the rule earlier this month, but
officials said they opted to bypass the remainder of the research and
comment process in order "to give the public real confidence."</TE>

<TE>   WorldCom Meltdown</TE>
<TE>   What's at issue:</TE>
<TE>   * WorldCom admitted late Tuesday that it used improper accounting
techniques to classify $3.9 billion of routine expenses as capital
expenditures over a 15-month period. That allowed the company to
report profit when in fact it had been losing money.</TE>
<TE>   *WorldCom's board of directors fired the chief financial officer,
Scott D. Sullivan. Another executive, Controller David Myers,
resigned.</TE>
<TE>   * Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt said
Wednesday that his agency filed a fraud case against WorldCom, a move
designed to prevent the company from disposing of assets or
destroying potential evidence.</TE>
<TE>   What's next:</TE>
<TE>   * The Justice Department, which is reviewing the WorldCom case,
could file a criminal action against the company or its officers.</TE>
<TE>   * Analysts expect the disclosures to force WorldCom into
bankruptcy. The company says it has no plans for a bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   * WorldCom customers may begin defecting from the carrier, which
could doom its ability</TE>
<TE>   to recover.</TE>

<HD>Bush Promises a Full Investigation by SEC</HD>
<DH>Reforms: President assails 'egregious practices.' Congress
feels growing pressure to crack down on corporate abuses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON and JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Wednesday branded as "outrageous" revelations of
massive accounting improprieties by another major American company
and members of Congress said the WorldCom disclosures put new
pressure on both parties to produce legislation cracking down on
corporate misdeeds.</LD>
<LD>   As investor confidence in the financial markets sags, Bush
promised a full investigation by the Securities and Exchange
Commission into the latest--and biggest--accounting miscalculation.</LD>
<LD>   "We've had too many cases of people abusing their
responsibilities. And people just need to know that the SEC is on it,
our government is on it," Bush said at the G-8 economic summit in
Calgary, Canada.</LD>
<TE>   Bush's criticism of the "egregious practices" at WorldCom Inc.
underscored the growing concern about the effect of the wave of
corporate scandals on financial markets.</TE>
<TE>   In Congress, the House voted Wednesday to nearly double the SEC
budget, to $776 million for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. An
investigation of WorldCom's earnings restatement was launched by Rep.
W.J. "Billy" Tauzin, (R-La.), and Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) promised
reform legislation to increase accounting oversight.</TE>
<TE>   "If the laws were broken, somebody needs to go to jail," Daschle
said.</TE>
<TE>   But while the WorldCom revelations put the spotlight back on
efforts to pass business reforms originally triggered by Enron
Corp.'s collapse last year, it remained unclear what might emerge
from a sharply divided Congress in an election year.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Peggy Peterson, spokeswoman for the Republican chairman of
the House Financial Services Committee, expressed concern that the
latest revelations "could increase the appetite to do something that
would make things worse."</TE>
<TE>   Democratic and Republican lawmakers differ on how far Congress
should go in imposing new oversight rules on business.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate is considering a bill that would limit the amount of
consulting that accounting firms could provide to companies they
audit. It also would create a new oversight board with the power to
discipline auditors. And it would establish new rules for financial
disclosure by public companies and impose new responsibilities on
corporate officers.</TE>
<TE>   The measure, drafted by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Paul S.
Sarbanes (D-Md.) is tougher than an industry-backed measure approved
by the Republican-controlled House in April.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, top Republican on the Senate Banking
Committee, said Wednesday that while he supports establishing an
independent board to oversee accountants, the WorldCom revelation "in
no way changes my opinion about the undesirability of having Congress
set accounting standards or write into law a one-size-fits-all
mandate that would force the smallest incorporated business in the
smallest town to employ the same myriad of accounting firms that are
required for General Motors."</TE>
<TE>   A hefty budget increase for the SEC could be one of the few
significant business reforms to emerge from Congress this year.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Republican-controlled House and Democratic-led Senate
disagree over many of the proposed reforms, both favor more money for
the SEC than the amount proposed in Bush's budget.</TE>
<TE>   But while the House voted overwhelmingly to authorize a funding
increase, lawmakers still must take another vote during budget
deliberations--something that could prove more difficult when the SEC
budget comes up against other spending needs.</TE>
<TE>   Experts differ on whether WorldCom's disclosure would bolster
efforts to pass tougher legislation.</TE>
<TE>   "The WorldCom scandal makes it much more likely that Congress will
spend a lot of time blustering about business reform, but doesn't
radically increase the likelihood of any single bill's passage," said
Patrick Basham, senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, said WorldCom's restatement of earnings and
losses--the latest in a wave of corporate scandals--would make it
harder for financial-industry lobbyists to water down reforms.</TE>
<TE>   "Congressional supporters of industry will be hammered by their
opponents in the next election," said John W. Dienhart, a business
ethics professor at Seattle University.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Democrats responded to the WorldCom imbroglio by stepping
up their efforts to make a campaign issue of corporate
responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something that is a failure on our system's part," said
Sen. Jon Corzine (D-N.J.), a former co-chairman of investment bank
Goldman Sachs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's systemic. It is undermining to our economic welfare,
undermining investment in our economy."</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath of last year's Enron collapse, Democratic leaders
have been trying to portray Republicans as pushing deregulation and
other policies that have allowed corporate greed and abuse to
flourish.</TE>
<TE>   House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) proclaimed the
WorldCom scandal and other corporate misdeeds as the logical
consequence of the pro-business agenda advanced by then-House Speaker
Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) after Republicans took control of Congress in
1995.</TE>
<TE>   But Republicans argue that Democrats will be hard-pressed to make
a political issue of corporate scandals that the public does not seem
to view in partisan terms.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, Republicans say, the issue will not benefit the
Democrats because people tend to view politicians of both parties
with as much mistrust as business leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't think politicians are best positioned to whip
business into shape," said Terry Holt, spokesman for House Majority
Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas).</TE>
<TE>   Daschle, however, assailed the SEC for not being more aggressive
in rooting out corporate corruption. "I don't see the kind of
aggressive activity, the kind of attitude in the SEC that we need to
do this right," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement later on Wednesday, SEC Chairman Harvey L. Pitt
responded: "In my 10 months on the job, the SEC has laid out and is
actively implementing creative and effective solutions to the
problems I inherited."</TE>
<TE>   Some lawmakers said the snowballing examples of corporate
malfeasance underscore the need for more aggressive congressional
oversight.</TE>
<TE>   But corporate governance is a notoriously arcane area where
lawmakers are often outgunned in their command of the details by
specialists and special interests.</TE>
<TE>   "How many more Enrons and WorldComs are there?" said Rep. Sherwood
L. Boehlert (R-N.Y.).</TE>
<TE>   "I don't pretend to be an expert, but we ... better become an
expert in a hurry."</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Until WorldCom Inc.'s admission that it improperly
accounted for $3.9 billion in expenses, the revelations of business
misdeeds beginning with Enron's collapse in early December looked as
if they would produce little more than some arcane accounting changes
and a few prosecutions.</LD>
<LD>   Washington's lack of appetite for stiff action was especially
striking because among its most ardent advocates were heads of some
of the most powerful business institutions in America, the New York
Stock Exchange and investment bank Goldman Sachs. The lack of fallout
was a gigantic relief to Republicans.</LD>
<LD>   But the latest scandal may finally do what its predecessors have
not done so far--set off a chain reaction that results in
considerable economic damage and substantial political change. And it
raises the question of how much of the booms of the last two decades
were real, and how much were financial gimmickry.</LD>
<TE>   "It's raised the decibel level of the crisis high enough the
politicians are going to have to act," said Arthur Levitt, former
chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Most immediately, WorldCom could make corporate scandal a fall
election issue. The accumulated weight of accounting misstatements
and executive self-dealing already have helped drive down the stock
market in recent weeks, and pollsters now detect signs its effects
are showing up in the political arena.</TE>
<TE>   "It's now possible a loss of confidence in the market will spill
over into the economy and therefore into the November election," said
Bill McInturff, a prominent Republican pollster. McInturff and others
have begun warning Republican candidates to prepare for Democratic
attacks on the GOP as too close to business.</TE>
<TE>   A new CNN/USAToday/Gallup poll finds that public confidence in
business, which remained high until recently, has slipped to levels
not seen in the early 1990s when a shallow but damaging recession
helped force President Bush's father from the White House.</TE>
<TE>   "The steady drip of scandal is beginning to have an effect on the
economy and politics," said Karlyn K. Bowman, a polling expert with
the generally conservative American Enterprise Institute.</TE>
<TE>   More broadly, the new revelations could help force a reassessment
of the preeminence business achieved during the economic booms of the
last two decades, opening the way for substantially stronger
legislation and regulations than have been proposed so far.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, President Bush himself appeared to move slightly
beyond the administration's stock position that the problems are
confined to a few bad apples. He labeled WorldCom's accounting
practices "outrageous," and warned executives that "when we find
egregious practices ... we'll go after them, and need to." Democrats
picked up on the change quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you stop talking about bad apples and start talking about
corporate responsibility, you're on the road to broader reform," said
Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg.</TE>
<TE>   At root, what must be answered in the debate over the recent
scandals is how much of corporate America's accomplishments in the
last decades were real, and how much was the illusory product of
financial manipulation.</TE>
<TE>   Virtually all of America's economic expansions have ended with
stock tumbles and scandal. The 1960s were followed by the collapse of
the "Nifty 50" stocks and the indictment of Robert Vesco for looting
a mutual fund. In the late 1980s came revelations about massive stock
and bond manipulations by Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken.</TE>
<TE>   What's striking this time, according to observers, is how
widespread the problems are and how enriching for the executives
involved. Some explain the problem in strictly moral terms.
"Basically, what we've had in the last two decades is an erosion of
the ethical values of corporations," said Levitt, the former SEC
chairman.</TE>
<TE>   But at least four other factors appear to have been at work.
First, big companies came to rely more heavily than ever before on
the stock market, rather than banks or the traditional bond market,
for funds. As they did, they were able to buy and sell whole
companies, rather than engage in the considerably less glamorous task
of building plants or developing new businesses from scratch.</TE>
<TE>   As corporate reliance on stocks grew, so did the need to meet
investors' increasingly exuberant demands for higher profits and
share prices.</TE>
<TE>   "It became necessary to account for everything in the most
favorable light," said Edward Lawler, a USC management professor. If
a company failed to do so, he said "then everybody was
unhappy--stockholders, directors, the television programs that
grilled chief executives."</TE>
<TE>   Second, top executives were given generous stock options that,
while intended to align their interests with those of other
shareholders, ended up acting as an incentives for them to cook the
books of their firms to send share prices ever higher.</TE>
<TE>   Third, as new technologies emerged, companies that sought to
commercialize them may legitimately have needed to keep different
kinds of accounting records than those of traditional firms. "That
their accounting innovations also made profits look better than they
were," and therefore fed spiraling stock prices, may only have been
incidental, said Patricia Hughes, who teaches accounting at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the pace of deal-making and the changes in accounting
practices outstripped the ability of discouraged and increasingly
underfunded regulators to keep up.</TE>
<TE>   "It's noteworthy that for all the recrimination today, the [SEC]
never once challenged any of the hundreds of filings Enron made in
the 1990s," said Avedick Poladian, a Los Angeles-based senior partner
with Arthur Andersen, whose roles in the Enron Corp. and WorldCom
scandals are all but certain to result in the accounting firm's
demise.</TE>
<TE>   Congress took a first, tentative step Wednesday to boost SEC
funding when the House passed a measure pledging to double the
agency's budget to $776 million. But lawmakers must still find the
funds to pay for the promise.</TE>

<TE>   Scandal Overload</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom is just the latest in a series of corporate crises. A
rundown:</TE>
<TE>   ImClone</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive Samuel D. Waksal resigned in May and was arrested
June 12 on insider trading charges for allegedly tipping off family
members after learning that the FDA would not consider the company's
experimental cancer drug Erbitux. In a related development, Martha
Stewart, a friend of Waksal's, also is under scrutiny related to her
sale of ImClone stock.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom</TE>
<TE>   MCI's parent company reported that it had inflated profit by
improperly accounting for $3.9 billion in routine expenses. On
Wednesday, President Bush vowed there would be a full investigation,
and SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt said the company faced federal fraud
charges.</TE>
<TE>   Enron</TE>
<TE>   The energy giant filed for bankruptcy protection in December. Its
tangled finances, including off-balance-sheet deals to keep billions
of dollars in debt off the books, are the focus of numerous
investigations.</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Andersen</TE>
<TE>   The accounting firm, whose clients included Enron and WorldCom,
was convicted on obstruction-of-justice charges this month in
connection with the Enron case.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco International</TE>
<TE>   Ex-CEO L. Dennis Kozlowski was charged with evading more than $1
million in New York state and city sales taxes on purchases of
artwork. Kozlowski resigned June 3, the day before the indictment. On
Wednesday, he pleaded not guilty to additional charges of tampering
with evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia Communications</TE>
<TE>   The cable television company filed for bankruptcy protection
Tuesday. The SEC and two federal grand juries are investigating
questionable financial transactions, including $3 billion in
off-the-books loans to the founding Rigas family. Adelphia also
revealed that cash-flow figures and subscriber numbers had been
overstated for the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   Rite Aid</TE>
<TE>   Three former executives and a current employee of the drugstore
chain were charged with securities and accounting fraud in a federal
criminal indictment filed Friday. The alleged fraud resulted in a
$1.6-billion restatement of earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing</TE>
<TE>   The telecommunications company, which filed for bankruptcy
protection in January under the weight of more than $12 billion in
debt, is being investigated by two congressional committees, the SEC
and the Justice Department to determine if the company used
fraudulent transactions to inflate revenue and mislead investors.</TE>

<HD>'Tweens: From Dolls to Thongs</HD>
<DH>Marketers dangle glittery goods to lure preteen girls with
spending power. But some adults say it's too much, too soon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE EARNEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the store mannequins wears a fringed denim skirt riding low on
the hips and a top pushed high on the midriff. Another has shorts
that roll down on the tummy and a one-shoulder top.</LD>
<LD>   The music here is loud, throbbing. But it can't drown out the
giggles of shoppers.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, giggles.</LD>
<TE>   Welcome to the abercrombie in Costa Mesa, a store for kids ages 7
to 14.</TE>
<TE>   Known as 'tweens in the marketing world, youngsters in this age
group are spending like never before, $90 billion a year, by one
estimate. And they are doing it with new freedom, as their busy,
dual-income parents are more likely to indulge their whims. Girls in
particular have grabbed retailers' attention with their desire for
trendier clothes.</TE>
<TE>   Gone are the days when Mom lugged home dungarees and T-shirts for
her 9-year-old daughter's school year. Today's 'tweens make for
picky, fickle shoppers with a keen awareness of what's hot and a
hankering to look more grown-up than they are. At the same time,
their tender age makes them vulnerable to advertising.</TE>
<TE>   It's an ideal combination for manufacturers and retailers, who
have helped fuel the buying craze with faux leather pants and flirty
tops. A line of pedicure products beckons to this age group.
Marketers even host slumber parties to find out how to make a 'tween
spend.</TE>
<TE>   The trend raises the anxiety level of many parents and consumer
advocates, who say that girls barely past Beanie Babies are being
pushed too quickly toward mascara and navel rings.</TE>
<TE>   The debate heated up recently with Abercrombie &amp; Fitch's sales of
thong underwear to young girls at its abercrombie stores.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's appalling, sexualizing these girls at 9 and 10,"
said John Jones, a 59-year-old college instructor, who accompanied
his wife and niece on a recent shopping trip for the girl's 10th
birthday. He stood by grumbling at the Girl Mania store in Newport
Beach, watching as a group of girls awkwardly imitated a hip-gyrating
dance routine and his niece had her hair twisted up and glittery
makeup applied.</TE>
<TE>   "This will come back to haunt the kids and their parents," Jones
said. "You can't sexualize the kids and then take it away."</TE>
<TE>   Companies reach out to 'tweens with bright colors, videos,
flashing lights and pulsing music. Some stores have gum-ball machines
and photo-sticker booths, others lighted vanity tables where girls
can admire freshly applied makeup. Glitter is everywhere--on denim
skirts, in lavender eye shadow.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the many indicators that these are kids in transition, a
dressing room at the Limited Too store in Costa Mesa outlines a
three-step process for choosing the correct size bra.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, children haven't changed that much over the years,
academics and market analysts say. But the world around them has.</TE>
<TE>   More families have two working parents and more discretionary
income. And with families under increasing stress, experts say,
parents have a greater need to believe their children are competent
and able to make their own decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "There have never been so many influences on them, whether it's
MTV or the Internet or wealthier parents willing to spoil these
kids," said Brian Tunick, an analyst with J.P. Morgan Chase, an
investment banking firm in New York. "With both parents working now,
this is a way for them to show love to their kids. That's what has
changed."</TE>
<TE>   'Tweens--so named for their status between early childhood and the
teenage years--are not developed enough psychologically to know how
to be skeptical about advertising, said Elizabeth Moore, assistant
professor of marketing at the University of Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   "Children have televisions in their rooms, phones, computers,"
Moore said. "From a marketer's point of view, the range of products
these children are consuming is expanding. And there's a lot of
evidence that they have a lot of influence over what their parents
buy."</TE>
<TE>   The advertising directed at this age group encourages them to want
to be like teenagers, with the emphasis on being cool. High-voltage
and often skimpily clad entertainers such as Britney Spears and
Jennifer Lopez have become idols to many young girls.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, many parents now leave apparel decisions to
their children.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't dare bring anything home anymore," said Becky Yager of
Huntington Beach, who shopped recently with her 10-year-old daughter.
"I have to let her see it first."</TE>
<TE>   This early sophistication, particularly among girls, has given
rise to an array of products, from electronics to wigs to bedroom
furnishings.</TE>
<TE>   "Companies recognize its huge market potential," said Steven
Richter, an analyst with Wellington Management, an investment banking
firm in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   A huge market, but not easy to capture. The pint-sized consumer is
as easily bored as a full-blown teenager, and her attention span is
even shorter.</TE>
<TE>   "New, new, new. It's all about newness," said Dana Siegel, who
handles marketing and product development for Hotsie Totsie, a
'tween-driven division of Worldwide Cosmetics in Los Angeles. "One
second they like it, the next second they don't."</TE>
<TE>   Specialty retailers have the edge in capturing the 'tweens'
attention and money, market experts say. Limited Too, with its trendy
clothes, glittery makeup and extras such as in-store ear-piercing,
dominates the apparel niche, but others are bent on taking a share.
The Zutopia and Rave Girl chains, which also boast cool clothes in
'tween sizes, are expanding.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to get them in, convert them, then keep them in the fold
as long as possible," said Kathy Bronstein, chief executive of Wet
Seal Inc., which owns Zutopia.</TE>
<TE>   Girls can shop, get their hair styled and have birthday parties at
small shops such as Girl Mania and Club Libby Lu in Chicago. Libby Lu
customers are greeted with a sprinkling of "fairy dust" and allowed
to mix their own shower gel, moisturizer and lip gloss.</TE>
<TE>   Retail giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has doubled floor space for
preteen girls over the last year. Sears also offers trendier clothes
for youngsters and has sponsored concert tours for preteen icons
Christina Aguilera and Backstreet Boys.</TE>
<TE>   Pedicure kits for the 4- to 12-year-old set have been flying off
the shelf at Bath &amp; Body Works in Costa Mesa. The kits, which cost
$12.50, include a toe separator, nail file, pink and blue sparkly
nail polish and "beach feet foot cream."</TE>
<TE>   The popularity of clothes can be tougher to predict.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't wear pink or skirts ... never," said Halle Bissin, 9,
who on a recent shopping trip to Nordstrom and Limited Too at the
South Coast Plaza shopping center wore a blue wig and tennis shoes
with wheels in the heels that allowed her to glide from rack to rack.
Her mother followed, loaded down with clothes and saying, "Mom is
about out of money, honey."</TE>
<TE>   Keeping up with what's "over" and what's still hot is enough to
make an adult break out with pimples, said Barbara Fields, owner of
an L.A. trend forecasting service, who visits Europe every six months
to track 'tween and teen trends for her clients.</TE>
<TE>   "You're running ragged, almost being them, so to speak," she said.
"You have to be."</TE>
<TE>   But she has some advice: If U.S. retailers know what's good for
them, they'll install manicure stations in stores--as many European
businesses are doing--and designated spaces for girls to try on hats
and wigs. They also should have "bead bars," where girls can make
their own jewelry; "customized denim departments," where they can
decorate jeans, and--of course--the latest in candy.</TE>
<TE>   A Los Angeles company, Girls Intelligence Agency, owes its
existence to this 'tweens marketing craze. The firm holds slumber
parties in homes and other locations across the nation, showering
'tweens with products to see how they react, President Laura Groppe
said. Groppe then advises clients whether to "launch an entire
product line or abandon ship immediately," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Groppe recently held a slumber party in a gymnasium in Austin,
Texas, so that 50 girls ages 7 to 12 could preview products set for
launch by Tiger Electronics, a division of Hasbro Inc. The youngsters
went wild over a "hit clip," a tiny cassette player that hangs on a
key chain and plays segments of a song.</TE>
<TE>   "The girls came up with lots of great ideas as to the different
shapes they should have to make it more of a fashion accessory," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   On the flip side of the advertising coin is Girls Inc., a
nonprofit in New York that teaches girls as young as 6 to be more
skeptical of media messages.</TE>
<TE>   Meeting in schools, homes and elsewhere, program coordinators talk
with girls about the messages they're getting from videos, television
and magazine ads, said Kim Kearns, executive director of the Los
Angeles chapter.</TE>
<TE>   "Because they're so bombarded with images of high-priced items,
they really need to look at what's the best way to use the money they
have," Kearns said.</TE>
<TE>   Girls Inc. also prods girls to think about whether they need an
array of products to be socially acceptable.</TE>
<TE>   "I personally have heard my niece say, 'Do I look sexy?' " said
Lucy Santana, program director of Girls Inc. of Orange County. "I
say, 'You're 5 years old. Where did you get that word?' "</TE>
<TE>   This summer, the Orange County branch will offer a program called
Body IMAGEination intended to, among other things, help girls ages 7
to 11 deal with peer pressure to dress more provocatively.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of girls just 10, some 10 1/2, are transferring to middle
school," Santana said. "There's a lot of pressure to dress the way
everybody else is dressing and look the way everybody else is
looking, to fit in."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch was bombarded with e-mail from
people who were enraged by the company's sales of thong underwear to
preteens.</TE>
<TE>   Some underwear had the words "wink wink" and "eye candy" printed
on the front, said Don Wildmon, founder and executive director of the
American Family Assn. Abercrombie assured the group's members it
would take the thongs off the shelves, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They're exposing kids and telling them, 'If you want to be
popular, sex is the way to do it,' " Wildmon said. "They're robbing
the children of their childhood for a dollar."</TE>
<TE>   Abercrombie did not return repeated phone calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   More stores are bound to follow in the teenage retailer's
footsteps, because girls want what they see on television and what
their older sisters wear, said Marshal Cohen, co-president of
NPDFashionWorld, a unit of NPD Group, a market information firm in
Port Washington, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Abercrombie is "all about selling sex, even to the younger kid,"
he said. "You're going to see people trying to emulate the
Abercrombie formula, absolutely."</TE>
<TE>   Retailers insist that their clothes and makeup are appropriately
designed for young girls. In fact, much 'tween apparel is cheery and
childlike--T-shirts imprinted with the word "Angel," gingham pants
and cotton undies decorated with bumblebees.</TE>
<TE>   And not all parents are fretting about the expanding clothing
options.</TE>
<TE>   When the topic of thong underwear came up between Pamela Campos
and her 13-year-old daughter, Campos at first wondered whether it
would "lead to something else." But she decided that "the reason
they're wearing it is probably the same reason I would have--to not
show a panty line."</TE>

<HD>Standing Proud on the Sidelines</HD>
<DH>Education: Tutor who guided an autistic teen will see him
graduate from high school.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He was never absent or tardy. He was always in his seat with pencil
and notebook ready when the class bell rang. Not once in the ninth,
10th, 11th and 12th grades did he fall asleep during a dry history
lecture or shoot a spit wad during a lull in math class.</LD>
<LD>   As perfect as Armando Herman sounds, he won't be stepping forward
with the 650 others who have finished their four years at Garfield
High School when diplomas are handed out tonight.</LD>
<LD>   But as he watches from the sidelines, no one else at the East Los
Angeles ceremony will be prouder of a graduate's accomplishments.</LD>
<TE>   Herman is a classroom aide who for five years assisted Victor
Samayoa, an autistic student who is part of a vanguard of youngsters
with disabilities being placed in conventional Los Angeles classrooms
instead of being assigned to special education classes.</TE>
<TE>   Samayoa, 20, was "mainstreamed" with regular Garfield High
students. That meant he was required to take the same courses and the
same tests as everyone else, despite his autism--a neurological
disorder characterized by difficulty in communication and social
interaction.</TE>
<TE>   Symptoms of autism can range across a wide spectrum, from the
complete lack of speech or acknowledgment of other people in severe
cases to social awkwardness or extreme shyness among
higher-functioning individuals such as Samayoa.</TE>
<TE>   Herman, 35, of Boyle Heights was hired by the Los Angeles Unified
School District to help make certain Samayoa wasn't overwhelmed by
the curriculum and crowds at the 4,500-student Garfield campus.</TE>
<TE>   Together Since 1996</TE>
<TE>   The pair began working together in 1996. And the job was an
eye-opener for the youthful-looking Herman--who had graduated from
rival Roosevelt High School 10 years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Herman had been a typical high school student, passing through
Roosevelt with little effort or direction. He was accepted at Cal
State Los Angeles but never enrolled because of a mix-up with a
financial grant.</TE>
<TE>   He took a vocational class instead and worked as a nurse for 3 1/2
years at County-USC Medical Center before becoming a warehouse
supervisor in South Pasadena. When a back injury ended that job,
Herman returned to vocational school.</TE>
<TE>   There, he enrolled in the first open class he found: a 500-hour
program on how to become a special-education aide. Herman was hired
at Garfield immediately after finishing the training.</TE>
<TE>   Returning to high school was a jolt, he said. "The biggest shock
was the attire and attitude of kids. Their dress is more revealing.
And some of their comments are more arrogant now than they were when
I was in school."</TE>
<TE>   The curriculum seemed more intense too.</TE>
<TE>   Herman's job was to help Samayoa fit in academically as well as
socially at Garfield. So he found himself explaining classroom
assignments and tutoring the young man in subjects he had long ago
put out of his mind--or in some cases never learned the first time
around.</TE>
<TE>   "Algebra was difficult. It seemed like I was from another planet
talking about something I couldn't even relate to when I was in high
school," Herman said. "I was learning along with Victor."</TE>
<TE>   Herman's biggest lesson was about himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I discovered that I hadn't put 110% into learning when I was in
high school. I was about at 80%. I found out here I could have done a
whole lot more myself in high school. I could have accomplished a lot
more than I did--I could have pursued more."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles school officials say mainstreaming has the potential
to help children with disabilities accomplish more in the classroom,
too. Campuses throughout the school system will be required by
December to write a "least-restrictive environment plan" to help
guide them, according to Gloria Lopez, director of instructional
initiatives for the school district's Division of Special Education.</TE>
<TE>   "We absolutely want more children to follow this young man's
footsteps," Lopez said of Samayoa. "We want them to start earlier, so
that by the time they reach high school they have had built-in
support all along their academic career."</TE>
<TE>   In Samayoa's case, his autism had left him withdrawn and socially
inept by the time he was ready to enter high school. That forced
Herman to work outside the classroom to teach the boy how to relate
to other teenagers and participate in classroom discussions.</TE>
<TE>   Herman also had to teach the Garfield student body a lesson.</TE>
<TE>   "At first kids mocked Victor a lot. There was a lot of teasing:
'He's retarded. He's dumb. Look at the geek.' I intervened a lot at
first. I was his shadow, basically.</TE>
<TE>   "Anytime someone caused conflict, I would jump in and say, 'OK,
this is Victor. You're going to show a lot more respect to this
person.' At first they thought I was his bodyguard or something."</TE>
<TE>   Victor was soon accepted. And even protected by other Garfield
teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids were accepting him for who he is, and not as a person with a
disability. As time went on, the older kids would teach the newer
ones that this person has been here a while and is OK."</TE>
<TE>   On a few occasions when Samayoa's autism got the best of him in
class, Herman stepped in quickly and quietly.</TE>
<TE>   Some Difficult Moments</TE>
<TE>   "Once he threw an eraser in my face and the other kids were
shocked. They thought there was going to be an altercation. There
wasn't. I had him step out of class and we settled it.... He
apologized and it never happened again."</TE>
<TE>   Herman accompanied Victor to football games and school dances. "He
had a wonderful time. And I had a wonderful time knowing he was
having fun," Herman said.</TE>
<TE>   Garfield students and teachers say both Samayoa and Herman fit in
seamlessly at the campus.</TE>
<TE>   Onofre di Stefano, the school's assistant principal, said one
other autistic student is being mainstreamed at Garfield. Six other
pupils have aides assigned to help them in class.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a safe place, in many ways an ideal setting for Victor,"
Di Stefano said. "He could grow realizing no one was going to pick on
him. I'm very proud of him--he's grown intellectually and socially."</TE>
<TE>   English teacher Jim Roybal said Samayoa earned the diploma that
Principal Norma Danyo will hand him tonight.</TE>
<TE>   There was no coaching when Samayoa took and passed the four
mandatory proficiency tests required for high school graduation,
Roybal said. Instead, he, Herman and others focused two years on
boosting Samayoa's comprehension skills. "He had been very
mechanistic in his understanding about things" when he first arrived
at Garfield, Roybal said.</TE>
<TE>   Samayoa Is Well-Liked</TE>
<TE>   Classmate Elsa Garza, 17, said Samayoa is a popular member of the
senior class. "Victor's really nice. He comes to our dances and isn't
shy like other guys. He's like the rest of us--he can't wait for
graduation," said Garza, who is Garfield's student body activities
coordinator. "He told me this morning his mom's coming today to pick
up his cap and gown."</TE>
<TE>   Rayalda Samayoa of East Los Angeles arrived at noon and helped her
son claim the garments he will so proudly wear as the class of 2002
marches together for the last time.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a lot of friends here," Victor Samayoa said. "Armando is
one of them. He helped me pay attention and follow along in class.
When I'd daydream he'd tap me on the shoulder. He makes me think.
He's a good guy. I'm going to miss him."</TE>
<TE>   Herman has volunteered to temporarily help Samayoa this fall, when
Samayoa plans to enroll at East Los Angeles College. "I'd tutor him
and help him get situated until somebody else takes over. He'll be
able to function in college because of the way a lot of teachers at
Garfield opened doors for him," Herman said.</TE>
<TE>   The classes at Garfield High motivated Herman too.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to college myself," he said. "I'm starting with
community college courses too. I'm a lot more prepared now."</TE>

<LD>In an attempt to encourage recycling, the Los Angeles City Council
imposed a fee Wednesday on private firms that haul trash from
businesses and apartment buildings to landfills.</LD>
<LD>   The council decided that, for at least the next six months, the
city will charge haulers 10% of what they charge their customers.
Haulers can reduce the amount by sorting out recyclables beforehand,

<HD>O.C. Jail Officials Accused of Abuses</HD>
<DH>Courts: Judge is told inmates are deprived of visits,
exercise, access to phones and religious services. Deputies routinely
disregard policy, attorney says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A prominent civil rights attorney asked a federal judge on Wednesday
to find officials at the Orange County Jail in contempt for allegedly
violating a 1978 federal court order aimed at stemming overcrowding.</LD>
<LD>   Attorney Richard Herman, who served as the plaintiff attorney as
the jails came under federal court review in the 1980s, contends that
deputies are routinely disregarding jail policy, resulting in abuses
at the jail. In papers, he alleges that a "code of silence" exists
that effectively means that jail deputies--not their supervisors--run
the jails.</LD>
<LD>   Inmates allege that they are deprived of visits from family and
legal counsel, outdoor exercise, access to telephones and religious
services.</LD>
<TE>   The accusations come as the FBI is probing five allegations of
brutality in the jail. Last month, the Board of Supervisors agreed to
pay $650,000--the largest settlement for a brutality suit in county
history--to the family of a Garden Grove man who died while in
custody.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's officials denied any wrongdoing in that case, asserting
that the inmate died of a head wound he suffered before being taken
into custody.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's Department officials as well as county attorneys
declined to speak on the suit's specific accusations Wednesday,
saying it's against county policy to discuss pending litigation.</TE>
<TE>   "The Orange County jail system ranks among the best," said
Sheriff's Department spokesman Jon Fleischman. "When you look at the
aggregate of amounts paid out in settlements and compare that to
other major jails in the country, it's significantly less."</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Herman concluded in court papers that Sheriff Mike
Carona and top department officials were making strides and expressed
optimism that conditions would improve. "I've been working with the
Sheriff's Department for several years on cleaning up the jails and
we've reached an impasse," Herman said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Herman said jail deputies who break the rules are rarely reported
to their superiors. As a result, he said, deputies can create their
own rules for running the jail.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the alleged abuses occur during the jail-intake process,
according to the suit, when many inmates are crowded into specific
cells as they are directed through the booking process.</TE>
<TE>   While the court order requires that inmates be given seats in
cells, Herman says some must stand because there are not enough
seats.</TE>
<TE>   Four inmates named in the suit complained that they were
discouraged from exercising by guards who would "trash their stuff"
while they did so.</TE>
<TE>   While the court order requires the jail to provide inmates with
meal times of 15 minutes, inmates insist they are sometimes given
only five minutes to eat, Herman said.</TE>

<HD>Home-Schoolers Chartered</HD>
<DH>Education: With its program approved by the Ojai Unified
district, the alternative- teaching community just needs a campus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ojai's newest public school will have fewer than 60 children, from 4
to 15 years old.</LD>
<LD>   Some will attend class only three hours each week.</LD>
<LD>   And best of all, say prospective students, there will be no
homework.</LD>
<TE>   Valley Oak Charter School will open in September as a campus for
parents who home-school their children. This week, Ojai Unified
School District trustees unanimously approved the proposal, making
Valley Oak the first charter school in the Ojai Valley and the third
in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers now are scrambling to find a school site, hire a
director and prepare a curriculum for the 45 students who have signed
up so far.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so thrilled--and relieved," Martha Fellows, an Ojai parent
who has led the Valley Oak effort, said after the school board's vote
Tuesday night. "We have a lot of work to do."</TE>
<TE>   Fellows and her husband, Ojai teacher John Shifflette, applied for
charter-school status after two years of operating a district-funded
home-schooling program for about two dozen students out of a
classroom at San Antonio Elementary School.</TE>
<TE>   Valley Oak proponents are among a growing number of parents in
California who are teaching their children at home not for religious
or political reasons, but for academic ones.</TE>
<TE>   "My daughter had problems reading in first grade, so I took her
out and started teaching her at home," said Brenda Barron, a member
of the charter school's organizing committee. "The public school
approach didn't work. She's a fantastic reader now."</TE>
<TE>   The Ojai home-schooling program embraces the philosophy that
children are learning all the time, and that they learn better when
they have a choice in deciding what subjects to study, Shifflette
said.</TE>
<TE>   His job is to align what parents are teaching with the California
education standards--a set of lessons in various subjects that all
public school students are expected to master by a certain grade
level. Teachers also provide supplemental instruction for
home-schooled children and supervise during the students' weekly
meetings. Shifflette, for example, taught a Spanish class last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of taking a curriculum and doing the things the adults
are planning out for them, it's a more child-centered approach,"
Shifflette said. Instead of six hours a day, with breaks for lunch
and recess, learning is going on all the time. For example, a trip to
the zoo is a biology lesson, while cooking dinner includes math.</TE>
<TE>   Parents who will run the charter school are partnering with the
Ojai school district, which will receive about 22% of the school's
state funding to handle accounting, payroll, attendance and other
administrative support duties. Valley Oak students also will have
access to any class or activity at any school in the district, with
the exception of California Interscholastic Federation sports.</TE>
<TE>   Charter schools are subject to the state's testing and
accountability program, but Fellows said she expects many parents at
Valley Oak will opt out of the standardized testing, which is their
right. It may affect funding, she said, but "we'll have to deal with
it."</TE>
<TE>   The school's annual budget will be determined by how many students
enroll.</TE>
<TE>   At 40 students, the budget would be about $200,000, Fellows said,
minus the $44,000, or 22%, that would go to the district. State law
requires that half of the balance go to paying salaries of
credentialed teachers, leaving the school about $78,000 for overhead,
special programs and materials.</TE>
<TE>   Still, that is much more revenue than the program ever received as
part of the district, Fellows said. A desire for such financial
independence, allowing more flexibility in spending, is what
initially drove the charter school movement.</TE>
<TE>   "Now the largest part of the funding will be coming directly to
the classroom," Shifflette said.</TE>
<TE>   One piece that has yet to fall into place is a location.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers are looking at the old Oak View School on Mahoney
Avenue, which homeowners and activists in Oak View are trying to buy
from the Ventura Unified School District for $1.1 million. If a
proposed $49-a-year parcel tax passes by July 23 with more than 50%
of the vote, the county will contribute $400,000 in matching funds to
purchase and redo the exterior of the school, said Ventura County
Supervisor Steve Bennett.</TE>
<TE>   Community members want to save the school to prevent the property
from being sold off to a developer and subdivided into as many as 28
homes, Bennett said. They envision the school housing the Oak View
public library and other arts or social-service groups, including,
potentially, the charter school.</TE>
<TE>   Although the school allows parents to retain the primary
responsibility for their child's education, students will have to
meet with a Valley Oak teacher for at least three hours each week,
Fellows said.</TE>
<TE>   One parent for each student must also volunteer in the classroom
for one full shift, 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., about once every eight weeks.
The school plans to be open three days a week, with teachers
available for each of the age groupings: K-3, 4-6 and 7-10.</TE>
<TE>   Having a central location where home-schoolers can meet makes a
big difference for her family, said parent Robin Godfrey.</TE>
<TE>   "It gives me a break," she said, "and it gives the kids that sense
of community and a sense of belonging to a group."</TE>
<TE>   Godfrey decided to home-school her oldest daughter, Paige, because
the pacing suited her better than a public-school day did, she said.
Her two other children also tried public school off and on, but would
rather learn at home.</TE>
<TE>   "I like that you can just do more, and you can choose what you
want to do," said Paige, 11. "I can go at my own pace. And there's no
homework."</TE>

<HD>Compton's Clintonian Comeback</HD>
<DH>Image: Once-troubled district's new school will be named
for the former president.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOE MATHEWS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hoping to finally reverse their district's reputation for ineptitude,
Compton school board members this morning will break ground on their
first new school in more than three decades--and announce that they
are naming it for a former U.S. president with reputation troubles of
his own.</LD>
<LD>   William Jefferson Clinton Elementary School represents a
considerable milestone both for the district and for the 42nd chief
executive of the United States. The 54,000-square-foot structure,
with a tree-filled central courtyard and room for 1,000 students,
promises to be a symbol of the Compton district's emergence from
state control. Associates and admirers of the former president said
that outside of his home state of Arkansas, they know of no other
school in America named for Clinton.</LD>
<LD>   "This new school is a clear sign of a board going in the right
direction toward rehabilitating our district for the children of
Compton," said Isadore Hall, president of the Compton school board.
"Naming it William Jefferson Clinton furthers our message. It will
give the school an identity and some recognition that people will
remember."</LD>
<TE>   Hall and other school officials billed the new school as a perfect
marriage between a district that serves a population that is
overwhelmingly Latino and black and a president who was popular in
those communities. Clinton's impeachment and status as one of modern
America's most divisive political figures were considered
insignificant compared to his accomplishments in aiding public
education and race relations, they said. And they deflected questions
about other characteristics the school district and president share,
not all of them flattering.</TE>
<TE>   Both are best known for the years 1993 to 2001. (During that time,
Clinton served two tumultuous terms as president and the school
district endured eight years of a state takeover launched to stem
academic failings and corruption.)</TE>
<TE>   Both continue to be dogged by prosecutors. (Clinton is under
scrutiny for his last-minute granting of pardons; Compton's
superintendent is being investigated by New Mexico authorities for
alleged open-meeting violations in his previous job, and the Compton
board's vice president is under indictment on election fraud
charges.)</TE>
<TE>   Both Clinton and the Compton school board entered new phases of
their lives last year. (He left office, the board had its authority
restored by the state.) As a result, both are eager to improve their
standing in the public eye.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, Clinton was the man because of his work in education and
his work helping minorities--the other stuff doesn't matter," said
Basil Kimbrew, the board vice president who is under indictment for
allegedly lying about his address in election filings, which he
refuses to publicly discuss. Kimbrew formally proposed the naming at
a board meeting a few weeks ago. "And I thought we'd be one of the
first Clinton schools of many."</TE>
<TE>   Some board members said they adopted the Clinton name in part to
avoid ethnic controversy. The writer Toni Morrison may have called
Clinton the "first black president," but board member Marjorie Shipp
said she supported naming the campus for Clinton "because he's
white."</TE>
<TE>   "Picking an African American or a Hispanic might have gotten a lot
of people here upset," Shipp said. "We figured Clinton would be a
neutral name."</TE>
<TE>   Reaction in Compton has been positive mainly among those who know
of the naming. The only loud objection came from community activist
Lorraine Cervantes, who said she will not attend today's ceremony in
protest.</TE>
<TE>   "Under no circumstances should you put on a school the name of a
person like Clinton who has broken the Ten Commandments and betrayed
the public trust," Cervantes said. "It will reinforce the unfair
perception people have of Compton. It makes it look like we think
betrayal by public officials is OK."</TE>
<TE>   Clinton was not invited to the groundbreaking, though he may be
asked to attend the school opening. His spokeswoman, Julia Payne,
said this week that "the president is very honored whenever something
is named for him."</TE>
<TE>   Skip Rutherford, president of the Clinton Presidential Library
Foundation and a close tracker of all things Clintonian, said he is
unaware of any American schools named for the former president
outside Arkansas, where he was governor. William Jefferson Clinton
Elementary Magnet School was dedicated in 1995 in the Arkansas town
of Sherwood (pop. 21,500). Hope Primary School in Clinton's
birthplace was renamed for the president during his second term. And
the University of Arkansas plans to open the Clinton School of Public
Service, which will grant master's degrees, in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Political opponents and bitter editorialists have made snide
references to "the Bill Clinton School of Public Relations" (Buffalo
News), "the Bill Clinton School for Scandal" (any number of
congressional Republicans) and even "the Bill Clinton School of
Tactile Touching" (Washington Post), but those are brickbats, not
bricks-and-mortar institutions.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton's supporters have done better with public works projects.
The town of New Square, N.Y., named a street after Clinton. During
the 2000 Democratic National Convention, the city of West Hollywood
briefly renamed Clinton Avenue Bill Clinton Avenue in honor of the
president's commitment to gay rights. And as one might expect of a
president fond of building rhetorical bridges, there are any number
of spans being contemplated for his name.</TE>
<TE>   The Clinton name is popular internationally--there's a piece of a
highway in Ireland, a road in Nigeria, even a strip club in Reykjavik
that bares his name.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still very early," said Rutherford, the foundation
president, noting that Clinton is just in his 50s and has been out of
office less than 18 months. "My sense is that there will be over time
many opportunities, and much of those will be based on the fact that
his administration included more women and minorities than ever
before."</TE>
<TE>   That reflects the thinking in Compton, a city of 93,000 whose
predominantly black and Latino voters overwhelmingly voted for
Clinton in the 1992 and 1996 elections.</TE>
<TE>   For more than a decade, school officials have sought to build a
elementary school, largely to deal with overcrowding in the eastern
half of Compton, where immigrant families have settled and thrived.</TE>
<TE>   But public confidence in the district was so low--and the state
takeover so unpopular--that school bond measures that might have paid
for new construction routinely failed to win voter support. In
December, the state--citing improvements in facilities and financial
management--returned authority to the board's newly elected school
board. That board--and new Supt. Jesse Gonzales--moved quickly to
build the $16-million school with state money and loans not involving
bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Compton school board members said they did not debate the naming
much.</TE>
<TE>   Hall, the board president, first suggested the idea several weeks
ago, and Kimbrew's formal motion was approved in less than 10
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The board also discussed poet Maya Angelou and late Compton school
board member Manuel Correa, a former police officer.</TE>
<TE>   The new school "will have a park-like feel, with a courtyard and
an outdoor amphitheater," said Jeff Fuller, project manager of
Clinton Elementary's designer, GKK Corp. of Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The campus will consist of two-story modular buildings, brought to
the site in trucks, allowing for completion by February.</TE>
<TE>   The name will be prominently displayed at the school's Compton
Boulevard entrance, at the eastern gateway to the city.</TE>

<HD>D.A. Says Politics Fuels O.C. Grand Jury Criticism</HD>
<DH>Probe: Rackauckas vows to rebut a report alleging cronyism
and meddling in favor of contributors.</DH>

<LD>Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas defended his performance as
the county's top law enforcement officer Wednesday, dismissing a
scathing grand jury report as the product of longtime political
enemies.</LD>
<LD>   The report, formally released Wednesday, accuses Rackauckas of
political cronyism and meddling in cases that involve campaign
contributors, among other transgressions. Rackauckas vowed to rebut
the 130-page report's findings in detail.</LD>
<LD>   "This whole thing began with a series of complaints that were
politically motivated, and that's how it was driven all the way
through," he said. "If you see this in perspective, [the subject of
the report] is not a big part of what we do. It was taken out of
proportion based on political motivations.</LD>
<TE>   "None of this should undermine the public's trust in law
enforcement or the district attorney's office," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Saying he was elected in 1998 "to bring far-reaching change,"
Rackauckas defended replacing existing top managers with his own team
and cast dissent as predictable bureaucratic fallout.</TE>
<TE>   He also accused the grand jury of basing its conclusions on
incomplete and wrong information.</TE>
<TE>   "At least some of these inaccuracies could have been avoided had
the D.A.'s office had an opportunity to read and discuss a
preliminary report with the grand jury in order to verify the
accuracy of their findings," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas denied that political allies received preferential
treatment and pledged a detailed response to the grand jury's
specific findings.</TE>
<TE>   Few analysts believe that the report carries sufficient weight to
oust Rackauckas, but its findings could pose a high hurdle should he
seek state office.</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors plans to take up the report in a special
meeting Friday. But the district attorney is an independently elected
official, and the board has little authority over him and his office.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas said he had not been asked to attend the meeting and
was unsure if he would go.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm certainly going to be talking to all the board members and
the CEO, [telling them] what my impression is of the result," he
said. "We'll need to discuss the report in detail and where we go
from there."</TE>
<TE>   The state attorney general's office, which assisted the grand
jury, has not decided whether to investigate further.</TE>
<TE>   Although Rackauckas has described the criticism as partisan
potshots, the nature of the grand jury makes it difficult to regard
its findings as stones thrown by political enemies.</TE>
<TE>   "They are a bunch of ordinary citizens," said Fred Smoller,
chairman of Chapman University's political science department. "It's
a nonpartisan group. They don't have an ax to grind."</TE>
<TE>   Against a national backdrop of malfeasance by major corporations,
the report's accusations that Rackauckas gave special help to
campaign donors could erode support for him, Smoller said</TE>
<TE>   "The allegation that political donors get one form of justice and
those who aren't get another form of justice is the sort of thing
that's going to undermine citizen confidence," Smoller said. "It's an
extremely serious charge."</TE>
<TE>   Still, voters have notoriously short memories, and this week's
scandal could fade by the next election.</TE>
<TE>   "I predict that in two months, nobody is even talking about this,"
said Mark Petracca, chairman of UC Irvine's political science
department.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Keller, a criminal defense attorney and Rackauckas
backer, described the report as a rehash of campaign issues from the
March election in which Rackauckas defeated one of his deputies,
Wally Wade.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas hung up his robe as a Superior Court judge in 1998 to
clean up what he saw as the political cronyism and questionable
policies of predecessor Mike Capizzi.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas handily won reelection in March despite Wade's
accusations that Rackauckas had committed ethical breaches.</TE>
<TE>   From his first days in office, the grand jury said, Rackauckas'
purging of political opponents "set the wrong tone, which continues
to the present, that loyalty to the district attorney, personally, is
of prime importance."</TE>
<TE>   Wade said: "The report is a vindication of the prosecutors who had
the courage to come forward to the grand jury and had the courage to
oppose Mr. Rackauckas in the last election."</TE>
<TE>   The document describes the district attorney's office as a
political minefield in which good lawyers "continue to do outstanding
work in ... a politically divisive, low-morale working environment."</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, the report accuses Rackauckas of treating top
managers inherited from Capizzi "in an intimidating and unjustifiable
manner" by coercing them to retire and demoting those who would not.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas also snooped into computers assigned to three
prosecutors who were critical of his actions, the report says. In one
instance, under Rackauckas' direction, an investigator copied hard
drives from computers used by an assistant district attorney whose
wife had filed a sexual discrimination lawsuit against the
department. The tab: $1,386.84.</TE>
<TE>   The report also examined a case in which Rackauckas interceded on
behalf of a prominent defense attorney and campaign backer. The
lawyer's client was charged with 16 felonies involving automobile
burglaries, thefts and a school burglary. Ultimately, the client paid
less than $2,000 in restitution, and all felony charges were dropped.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney, Ron Brower, said Wednesday that he was given no
special access to Rackauckas or senior members of his office. In
fact, Brower said, he has discussed cases with previous Orange County
district attorneys and senior staff and contributed to their
campaigns as well--a point he said he made while testifying to the
grand jury.</TE>

<HD>Rackauckas: Criticism Is Driven by Politics</HD>

<TE>   Rackauckas said he had not been asked to attend the meeting and

not uncommon."</TE>
<TE>   Raising questions about morale inside the office, grand jurors
said some prosecutors testifying before them "expressed fear of
retaliation." They also noted that some senior management witnesses

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Point and Counterpoint</TE>
<TE>   Here are some of the accusations made by the Orange County Grand
Jury and Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas' replies.</TE>
<TE>   Office operations</TE>
<TE>   GRAND JURY: Rackauckas changed office hiring policy to ensure that
job candidates who were friends or relatives of a political supporter
would obtain interviews. Three prosecutors who were critical of
Rackauckas had their computers confiscated and their hard drives
analyzed.</TE>
<TE>   RACKAUCKAS: "Unfortunately, the report describes certain
situations for which the grand jury did not have the complete story
and the resulting conclusions are inaccurate."</TE>
<TE>   Personal use of public resources</TE>
<TE>   GRAND JURY: Chief of Investigations Donald Blankenship ordered one
of his deputies to investigate whether a car driven by Blankenship's
son was towed illegally when removed from a library parking lot.
Investigators also were ordered to probe the disappearance of the
boyfriend of Blankenship's daughter.</TE>
<TE>   RACKAUCKAS: "The grand jury report inaccurately describes the
experience of Chief Don Blankenship and his activity within the
D.A.'s office.... His leadership has resulted in significant benefits
to the public."</TE>
<TE>   Accounting problems</TE>
<TE>   GRAND JURY: A District Attorney's Special Fund, which was designed
to pay for undercover work by investigators and to protect witnesses,
was misused to pay for bar tabs and meals. In some cases, expenses
were double-billed.</TE>
<TE>   RACKAUCKAS: "To the extent that accounting practices need to be
revised to ensure that all county monies are properly spent and
reported N that will be done."</TE>
<TE>   Intervention in the Arnel Case</TE>
<TE>   GRAND JURY: Rackauckas took over negotiations in a consumer
protection case against an apartment business owned by billionaire
developer George Argyros, whose company donated to Rackauckas'
campaign. The lawyer representing the real estate firm, Arnel
Management Co., was a key Rackauckas campaign contributor and fund
raiser, raising a Opossible appearance of impropriety.</TE>
<TE>   RACKAUCKAS: "At no time did Mr. Argyros or his company ever
receive preferential treatment from D.A. Rackauckas or his office."</TE>
<TE>   Intervention in a Domestic Violence Case</TE>
<TE>   GRAND JURY: Rackauckas ordered his deputies to dismiss a domestic
violence case after a campaign contributor arranged for him to meet
with the victim, who said she made up the allegations. Once again,
there was an 'appearance of impropriety surrounding' the district</TE>
<TE>   Attorney's decision.</TE>
<TE>   RACKAUCKAS: "The misdemeanor domestic case cited in the report did
not involve any preferential treatment by D.A. Rackauckas or the
D.A.'s office.... This opinion [to dismiss the case] was arrived at
after consideration of the individual circumstances confronting this
particular family.''</TE>

<HD>1 Boy Drowns, Another Is Injured in Pool Accidents</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 3-year-old boy died and a 2-year-old boy was in critical condition
Wednesday after separate pool accidents in Anaheim.</LD>
<LD>   Asuel Chavez died after he walked out a bathroom door that led to
the pool deck at his home in the 200 block of North Vine Street,
officials said. Asuel was being watched by his grandmothers while his
mother was at work and his father, who works at night, was asleep.
The father, awakened by screams, pulled his son from the pool.</LD>
<LD>   Police and firefighters responded within four minutes of the 2:17
p.m. call and performed CPR. But the boy never regained consciousness
and was pronounced dead at Western Medical Center-Anaheim, Fire
Department spokeswoman Maria Sabol said.</LD>
<TE>   Three hours later, 2-year-old Joshua Taylor was pulled from his
family's pool in the 2100 block of West Chateau Avenue, Sabol said.
The boy was last seen napping with his parents.</TE>
<TE>   The boy's father and 12-year-old brother found him in the murky
pool, Sabol said. Joshua was taken to Western Medical Center where he
was listed in critical condition.</TE>
<TE>   Neither pool had a barrier around it, officials said.</TE>

<HD>Oxnard Mayor's Wife Says Flynn Threatened Her</HD>
<DH>Allegations: In a police report, Irma Lopez contends the
supervisor twice shouted, 'I'm gonna get you!' to her at a weekend
barbecue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The wife of Oxnard's mayor has filed a police report contending that
Ventura County Supervisor John Flynn verbally threatened her last
weekend during an annual Democratic Party barbecue.</LD>
<LD>   Irma Lopez maintains she was leaving the luncheon at a ranch in
south Oxnard about 3 p.m. Saturday when Flynn twice shouted at her:
"I'm gonna get you!"</LD>
<LD>   During the confrontation, Lopez, 55, said Flynn was gritting his
teeth and his face was "beet red and veins were bulging." The
exchange was witnessed, she said, by a friend who was standing
nearby.</LD>
<TE>   "He scared me so much--he was livid," said Lopez, who is married
to Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez. "People may say, 'Oh, that's just John
Flynn,' but I don't take threats lightly."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said she asked Flynn what he meant, but that he did not
respond. She then returned home and called Oxnard Police Chief Art
Lopez, who advised her in a return phone call later the same day that
she should file the report.</TE>
<TE>   Flynn, 69, denied making any threats and described the incident as
the latest in a series of attempts by Irma Lopez and others to
"publicly embarrass" him and get him ousted from office. They are
motivated, he said, by a desire to have more Latinos and blacks in
public office.</TE>
<TE>   "[Lopez] won't be happy until she sees a sea of brown faces in
every political office in west Ventura County," Flynn said in a
telephone interview as he was driving to meet with Chief Lopez and
Oxnard City Manager Ed Sotelo about the incident.</TE>
<TE>   Flynn said he was walking down the driveway toward his car when he
playfully said to Lopez, "Irma, I'm going to win." The reference, he
said, was to winning the attack on his position and reputation.</TE>
<TE>   After Flynn made his statement, he said, he walked around Lopez
and then in front of her, at which time she yelled to him that it was
improper for him to turn his back on a woman. At this point, Flynn
said he told Lopez: "I'm not sure you're a woman."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said she was interviewed about the incident by a detective
who came to her Oxnard home early Monday. The matter will be
investigated by police, who will also ask the district attorney to
review the matter, she said.</TE>
<TE>   In her interview with the detective, Lopez said she explained that
she takes threats very seriously since being traumatized in a
shootout nearly a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, unemployed computer engineer Alan Winterbourne opened
fire in an Oxnard unemployment office where Lopez worked. She was
shot, but dragged to safety. Four people, including an officer, were
killed before police fatally shot Winterbourne.</TE>
<TE>   "Ever since that happened, I've had flashbacks," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said she will consider a restraining order against
Flynn--which he said he would gladly sign--but also hopes that the
supervisor seeks anger-management counseling for what she described
as a history of such problems.</TE>
<TE>   In December 2000, Flynn was accused by Oxnard Elementary School
District Supt. Richard Duarte of grabbing Duarte's arm after a
controversial school site vote. At the time, Flynn alleged Duarte
pushed and elbowed him.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday evening, Flynn named Duarte and Rio School District
Supt. Yolanda Benitez as two of the people involved in Lopez's
alleged plot to oust him.</TE>
<TE>   As examples of the alleged witch hunt, Flynn said that his name
has been omitted from an invitation for an upcoming fund-raiser for
Rep. Lois Capps (D-Santa Barbara), to be held at Lopez's house, and
that he also wasn't invited to a fund-raiser held three months ago in
Oxnard for Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara).</TE>
<TE>   "She purposely excludes me from everything," Flynn said of Lopez.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said she has long supported her fellow Democrat and been a
friend of Flynn and his wife for more than 20 years. She said she
isn't sure why Flynn allegedly threatened her, but believes it could
be over her friendship with Benitez.</TE>
<TE>   In the 2000 election, Benitez initially endorsed Flynn, but then
threw her support to Oxnard School District trustee Francisco
Dominguez.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot understand this," Lopez said. "It's very bizarre."</TE>

<HD>Garden Grove Cuts Rezone Plan After Protest</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After 700 residents packed Garden Grove City Hall to plead for their
homes, the City Council bowed to their demands early Wednesday and
dramatically limited a redevelopment plan that could have forced
1,000 families to move.</LD>
<LD>   At the close of the seven-hour public hearing, the council voted
unanimously to remove huge chunks of the proposed 195-acre project,
areas that include about 500 homes, 300 mobile homes and dozens of
apartment units.</LD>
<LD>   Consultants and some city leaders, including Mayor Bruce
Broadwater, had hoped to remake Harbor Boulevard with new hotels and
an entertainment anchor--such as a theme park--to entice people to
come to Garden Grove.</LD>
<TE>   Residents mobilized door-to-door campaigns in protest, held
community meetings and turned out en masse at Tuesday's council
meeting to sway city leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like a proud parent with your first newborn kid," resident
Bob Walker said about the hard-fought victory. "I feel like this is
what America is all about. I'm glad that the City Council saw it our
way. I'm glad that they did what was right, instead of what was
popular."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, council members said the city might have been reaching
too far in its goals and might have been too ambitious with
redevelopment efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Adding the 195 acres to the redevelopment area would have given
city officials the power of eminent domain.</TE>
<TE>   If a developer proposed a project, residents could have been
forced to sell their homes and move.</TE>
<TE>   Some council members said the plan would have put the city on a
new path--an aggressive approach that uses redevelopment as a tool
for economic growth and increased tax revenue by clearing out old
businesses or homes to make room for newer chains, big-box stores, or
hotels.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to be the next poster child for redevelopment
abuse," Councilman Mark Leyes said. "I just thought we needed to pull
back and moderate our approach."</TE>
<TE>   Broadwater, one of the plan's biggest cheerleaders, said he was
disappointed even though he voted with the rest of the council to
pare the plan.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll just have to work harder. This doesn't mean it's the end of
everything," Broadwater said.</TE>
<TE>   Attracting more hotels, restaurants and stores would have been one
way to increase the tax revenue in the blue-collar city, ranked as
second poorest in tax revenue in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the changes, the city still has redevelopment areas
intact--including most of the property facing Harbor and Garden Grove
boulevards.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to continue knocking on doors; we're going to
continue marketing the area," said Assistant City Manager Matt
Fertal.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a sense of relief, but I'm going to watch them," resident
Verla Lambert said.</TE>

<TE>   "We just won't have as attractive, suitable sites as we could have

<TE>   Larry Gilbert, Orange County co-chairman of the Californians
United for Redevelopment Education, praised the residents' efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "These people poured their hearts out. They were scared to death
someone was going to take their homes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   City officials criticized leaders of the Coalition of Concerned
Garden Grove Residents for fueling residents' fears and providing
misinformation about the threat of eminent domain.</TE>
<TE>   Although the city might someday have taken the homes, that plan
would have been years away, the officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The city promised residents a fair-market value for their homes,
offered to help relocate them, and said nothing would happen until a
developer had an idea for the property.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a sense of relief, but I'm going to watch them," resident
Verla Lambert said.</TE>
<TE>   "In six months, they can come back and do it again--or even
sooner.... I think this goes to show the City Council that they're
there for us. They're our employees. This is our city. They work for
us."</TE>

<DH>Violence: U.S. customs agent identifies one of the robbery
suspects at the Mexico border.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two men trying to cross the U.S. border from Tijuana were arrested
Wednesday in the shooting of an armored-truck guard the day before in
north Long Beach, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The guard, Victor Hurtado, 33, of Paramount, died Wednesday
morning. He had been shot in the head at close range by a robber.</LD>
<LD>   Jose Silva, 20, of Long Beach and Daniel Nieves, 22, of Los
Angeles were arrested about 4 p.m. after a U.S. customs agent thought
one of them resembled a photograph police had circulated, said Nancy
Tabing, a spokeswoman for the Long Beach Police Department.</LD>
<TE>   Police said they recovered money believed taken in the robbery at
three homes in Long Beach, South Gate and Compton. They also found
other undisclosed evidence, Tabing said.</TE>
<TE>   Gunfire erupted about 11 a.m. Tuesday in the 2300 block of East
68th Street as Hurtado left the Jetro Cash and Carry store with a
satchel containing an undisclosed amount of cash.</TE>
<TE>   The driver of the armored vehicle tried to warn Hurtado that a
gunman was approaching, but police said that the guard was fired
upon. The driver was not injured, but Hurtado was hit. He died
Wednesday at Lakewood Regional Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach detectives had information from witnesses and evidence
that suggested they look in San Diego for the killer, Tabing said.
Police there came up with a photo of a possible suspect, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The photo was placed at Customs Service booths along the border.
Tabing said she didn't know whether it resembled Silva or Nieves,
both of whom were booked on suspicion of murder.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives were trying to determine which man is suspected of the
shooting.</TE>
<TE>   About an hour after the shooting, a red two-door Chevrolet Blazer
was found burning about a mile from the Jetro store. Detectives are
investigating whether the SUV belonged to the suspects, Tabing said.</TE>

<HD>Health Care Takes Deep Cuts</HD>
<DH>Budget: County supervisors vote to close 11 of 18 clinics,
pare 5,000 jobs and end inpatient services at High Desert Hospital.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI, EVELYN LARRUBIA and GARRETT THEROLF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County supervisors made the deepest cuts ever to their
troubled health-care system Wednesday, voting unanimously to shutter
11 of 18 public health clinics, end inpatient services in High Desert
Hospital and eliminate 5,000 positions.</LD>
<LD>   The vote came although about 1,000 people showed up to plead with
the supervisors to preserve a health-care system that cares for
800,000 annually, most of whom are uninsured and have nowhere else to
go. At one point a shouting match erupted between union officials and
supervisors.</LD>
<LD>   "Billions of dollars were found to fight terrorism. Billions of
dollars were found to save airlines," said Mandy Johnson, who
represents private clinics that will see their funding cut by 25%.
"How do you tell people with no health insurance, no child care or
transportation that there is no appointment available for their sick
child, their diabetic mother or father with bronchitis?"</LD>
<TE>   But supervisors insist that there is not enough money to sustain
the current system and that change is long overdue. After roughly 75
minutes of public testimony, they voted for a plan that seeks to
reduce patient visits by 29% and trims staffing by 22%. The cuts
would save about $150 million when fully implemented.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the day, the supervisors approved an overall budget that
cut the Sheriff's Department funding by at least $60 million and
reduced other services as well.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors also directed their health department to prepare for
far more severe cuts in October should they fail in their effort to
secure a $350-million bailout from the federal government. Those cuts
could pare services at two hospitals, possibly Olive View and Harbor
UCLA Medical Center. Officials would consider eliminating emergency
rooms and even inpatient services at those facilities.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very difficult time for all of us," Supervisor Yvonne
Brathwaite Burke said during the morning session on health care. "We
hope for a miracle, but we have to work with what we have."</TE>
<TE>   The reductions approved Wednesday are not technically final until
a lengthy series of public hearings is completed this summer. If
supervisors reaffirm their vote at the end of that process, the
facilities will close by October, though unions and health-care
advocates vowed to fight to keep them open and some hinted at
possible legal challenges. Elected officials and private medical
providers in the Antelope Valley are trying to assemble a last-ditch
plan to keep High Desert open as well.</TE>
<TE>   Labor leaders and patient advocates said the supervisors have
enough money on hand to fully fund the health department for another
year and complained that they are moving too fast.</TE>
<TE>   "Cutting back essential services is not brave--it's an abdication
of leadership," said Kathy Ochoa of the Service Employees
International Union Local 660, which represents most of the health
department's 23,000 workers.</TE>
<TE>   But the supervisors replied that they were making cuts they should
have made long ago, when they first turned to the federal government
for help in running their health department. Since 1995, when they
made what was an unprecedented layoff of 3,500 workers in a
last-ditch effort to balance the budget, the agency has relied on two
five-year, $1-billion bailouts from Washington to stay open. The
final bailout declines next year and runs out completely in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors had promised to streamline the health system as part
of the bailouts, but have failed to meet their goals.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to do what we probably should have been doing five years
ago," Burke said.</TE>
<TE>   Changes Possible</TE>
<TE>   Still, supervisors left the door open to saving some of the
services. Supervisor Mike Antonovich, whose district is home to High
Desert Hospital, told the health department to consider proposals by
Antelope Valley health providers who want to keep High Desert open
before beginning hearings to end inpatient services there.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky called for further exploration of ways
to fund the clinic system, which he has supported. And Supervisor Don
Knabe directed the department to explore ways to reconfigure the
system with health experts.</TE>
<TE>   Though the health department has $160 million in reserve available
for next year--and the county has nearly $500 million--officials
argued that such money is available only once and cannot be relied
upon to keep the health system afloat.</TE>
<TE>   Still, while finalizing the county budget later Wednesday, the
board voted to spend $4 million in surplus funds to keep alive a
program for poor mental health patients. That drew an objection from
Supervisor Gloria Molina. "The argument this morning and the tough
decisions we made, we're undoing them one by one."</TE>
<TE>   Other supervisors said the expenditure was necessary and
relatively small.</TE>
<TE>   During the morning session, the county's new health director
warned the supervisors against digging into reserves to maintain his
agency.</TE>
<TE>   Spending the reserves "really wouldn't change much," Thomas
Garthwaite told supervisors. "It would just delay the pain slightly."</TE>
<TE>   Speaker after speaker challenged that contention.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm here to ask you to try and rise to the occasion," Lark
Galloway-Gilliam, executive director of the Community Health
Councils, told supervisors. "You don't have to accept this as
reality."</TE>
<TE>   Lynn Kersey, executive director of a maternal and child health
access advocacy group, said the county should use its surplus to keep
the system afloat while experts look for less painful ways to save
money. "We're not saying keep the same broken system open," she said.
"There are ways of fixing this system that do not have a
slash-and-burn kind of impact."</TE>
<TE>   'Asking for a Hand'</TE>
<TE>   Patients said the cuts would jeopardize their lives. Dora Soto,
63, works part time as an aide in a middle school in Littlerock in
the Santa Clarita Valley and gets treatment for her diabetes and
arthritis at High Desert Hospital. If High Desert closes as planned,
she will have to drive 50 miles to Olive View in Sylmar for
treatment. If that hospital closes in October, as is also planned,
Soto will have an 87-mile trek to the nearest county hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "The majority of our residents don't have access to transportation
or health stamina to travel long distances for medical care,"
South-Central Los Angeles resident Thelma James Mwanza said. "We're
not asking for a handout. We're just asking for a hand."</TE>
<TE>   With their 700-person hearing room full and hundreds milling about
outside, supervisors set 75 minutes for public testimony, saying that
full comments can be made during the public hearings process. They
gave each speaker two minutes, which irritated several of the members
of the public, including Annelle Grajeda, the general manager of
Local 660.</TE>
<TE>   Grajeda stepped onto the speaker's dais and began to rapidly read
a four-page statement, accusing supervisors of sacrificing patients
for political expediency. She said the cuts made little
sense--pointing out that the county is slashing outpatient care while
one of its stated goals is increasing outpatient care.</TE>
<TE>   'Let Her Speak'</TE>
<TE>   In his role as board chairman, Yaroslavsky told Grajeda to stop
talking when her two minutes were up. But Grajeda continued.</TE>
<TE>   "Let her speak!" the crowd chanted.</TE>
<TE>   "Annelle, you know the rules," Yaroslavsky warned her.</TE>
<TE>   "This plan includes 5,000 layoffs. I think that deserves five
minutes of your time," Grajeda shouted back.</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky directed county workers to cut off Grajeda's
microphone, but she kept speaking. After trying to quiet the crowd,
Yaroslavsky stormed out of the boardroom, and Burke andMolina urged
Grajeda to step down, saying others had a right to testify.</TE>
<TE>   Grajeda stayed at the dais for several minutes, allowing others to
speak. When other union members tried to yield their time to her,
Yaroslavsky blocked them. Finally, Ochoa stepped up and finished
reading Grajeda's speech.</TE>
<TE>   After the supervisors voted, union members retreated to the plaza
between the Hall of Administration and civil courthouse, where
Grajeda outlined a series of demonstrations and exhorted anyone who
wanted to to sign up for civil disobedience training.</TE>
<TE>   But Ochoa said the supervisors clearly had their minds made up.
She said the public hearings this summer, required by law before
health reductions can be approved, are "a moot point."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they're committed to a public process," Ochoa said.
"The money is already gone."</TE>

<HD>INS Officer Faces Bribery Charges</HD>
<DH>Immigration: He allegedly demanded sex and cash from two
asylum seekers. He also is named in a civil suit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Immigration and Naturalization Service hearing officer was
indicted Wednesday on charges of demanding sex and money from two
Chinese women who were seeking political asylum.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas A. Powell Jr. was the third local INS employee charged this
month in separate and unrelated corruption cases.</LD>
<LD>   Now on paid administrative leave, Powell is a defendant in a
$10-million civil suit filed last year by his two alleged victims.</LD>
<TE>   Powell, 58, of Pomona was charged with two counts of bribery and
one count of violating civil rights under the color of law. If
convicted, he could receive up to 31 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the government has made a grave error," said Morton
Boren, Powell's defense lawyer. Boren said the case could prove
embarrassing to the INS if it goes to trial, but declined to
elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, federal authorities arrested a senior INS
inspector on charges of smuggling illegal immigrants into the United
States through Los Angeles International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Maximiano Ramos, a 19-year INS veteran, was accused of shepherding
the immigrants past airport inspectors in return for as much as
$10,000 a person. Four other people also were indicted.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said the five suspects took advantage of an INS rule
that allows passengers en route to a third country to stop briefly in
the United States while awaiting connecting flights.</TE>
<TE>   Also this month, Maria Chica, an INS employee with 22 years of
service, was charged with stealing permanent resident cards that were
supposed to be destroyed and selling them for $3,500 to an undercover
FBI agent.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment returned against Powell provided scant details
about his alleged dealings with the two Chinese asylum seekers, Xue
Lu and Jie Hao.</TE>
<TE>   However, according to their civil suit, the women appeared
separately before Powell at his Anaheim office in 2000 after filing
applications for political asylum. About a week later, Lu said,
Powell phoned her at home, saying he wanted to see her alone at her
apartment in Monterey Park.</TE>
<TE>   She said he showed up there on Feb. 28, 2000, and took a seat on
her bed, telling her he wanted to help her and indicating he would do
so for cash, according to the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   When she said she had no money to give him, Powell began fondling
her and tried to remove her clothes, according to the suit. Lu was
represented at the time by immigration attorney Douglas G. Ingraham.
Shortly after the episode at Lu's home, the lawsuit said, Ingraham
received a call from Hao, whom he also represented.</TE>
<TE>   She told the lawyer that Powell said he wanted to come by her home
in Los Angeles to discuss her case. Ingraham contacted Justice
Department officials, who set up a sting. They equipped Hao with a
concealed recorder for two meetings with Powell.</TE>
<TE>   No date was set for arraigning Powell, who remains free.</TE>

<HD>Fire in Laguna Burns 80 Acres</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE ANTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A brush fire that blackened 80 acres in Laguna Canyon on Wednesday
was caused by a bulldozer clearing weeds as a fire-prevention
measure, fire officials said.</LD>
<LD>   "It's very ironic--that's exactly why they were clearing it," said
Capt. Stephen Miller of the Orange County Fire Authority.</LD>
<LD>   The location was not far from where an arsonist set a wildfire in
1993 that destroyed hundreds of homes.</LD>
<TE>   The driver, who was not identified, tried to put out the fire by
dumping dirt on the blaze with the bulldozer. But 10- to 15-mph winds
quickly pushed the flames into Laguna Coast Wilderness Park. The
bulldozer apparently had clipped a rock, which caused a spark and
started the fire about 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   "He's very upset," Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   About 100 firefighters and water-dropping helicopters had the
blaze 90% contained by 5 p.m. Fire crews were expected to remain at
the scene throughout the night. The southbound Laguna Freeway
connector was closed at the San Diego Freeway, Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   No injuries were reported, and no residents were evacuated. Still,
the blaze frayed nerves in the canyon, where a devastating 1993 fire
burned 450 homes and caused more than $500 million damage.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I hear an ambulance siren on the road, I look out the
window," said Shelley Evans, an artist whose studio is across the
road from Wednesday's fire. "We're all on alert."</TE>
<TE>   Miller said they should be. Orange County, like much of the West,
is tinder-dry, and most of the fire season lies ahead.</TE>
<TE>   So far this year, more than 5,000 acres have burned in Orange
County wildfires, Miller said.</TE>

<HD>Romer Gets 2 More Years in Schools Job</HD>
<DH>Education: L.A. Unified board expresses general
satisfaction with the superintendent's work.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Board of Education has unanimously renewed schools
Supt. Roy Romer's contract for two years.</LD>
<LD>   The board's action late Tuesday extends Romer's position until
2005. The 73-year-old former Colorado governor was hired two years
ago after serving as the head of the Democratic National Committee.</LD>
<LD>   Romer will continue to be paid $250,000 a year and after five
years will receive a state-funded annuity, pension plan and lifetime
health coverage.</LD>
<TE>   The board also doubled Romer's expense account for meals and
entertainment, to $30,000 a year, during a closed session Tuesday.
For the second year in a row, Romer declined what was to be a
$100,000 bonus, and the board granted his request that it be written
out of his current contract.</TE>
<TE>   Romer said that his contract had come up for renewal so early to
give the board time to look for a replacement in case they were
dissatisfied with him. Board members said they have been generally
happy with his leadership, despite debates on such difficult issues
as the completion of the Belmont Learning Complex and class-size
increases.</TE>
<TE>   Board member Julie Korenstein, who has been critical of Romer on
budget issues, said that she voted for the contract renewal because
"he certainly is aggressive in tackling literacy and math in our
schools. And he's aggressive on facilities.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are efforts I applaud him for."</TE>
<TE>   The board also ordered its auditor to investigate the staff
recommendation that a joint venture be awarded three construction
management contracts worth $33 million.</TE>
<TE>   Board members voted 6 to 0 for the audit the day The Times
reported that 3D/International Inc. and URS Corp. had been dismissed
from a large school modernization job in Maryland after complaints of
lax supervision. Facilities officials at Los Angeles Unified said
they were unaware of the partnership's problems before it became a
contract finalist here.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, the Los Angeles district auditor reported that
3D/International and O'Brien Kreitzberg--a predecessor of URS
Corp.--were charging L.A. Unified fees higher than the industry
standard.</TE>
<TE>   The 3D/Iinternational-URS venture was one of 21 firms recommended
to share $230 million in construction management contracts. The board
Tuesday approved all but the 3D/International contracts, which were
delayed until the investigation is completed.</TE>
<TE>   Romer contended that any problems in the joint venture will be
overcome.</TE>
<TE>   Expressing concerns that L.A. Unified did not adequately review
the contracts, the board also ordered Romer to strengthen the
district's contract selection process.</TE>
<TE>   In other matters, the board voted 5 to 2 to approve a provisional
$5.9-billion general fund budget. The district still needs to shave
$9.7 million to balance the budget by its deadline of July 1. The
final budget is due Sept 8.</TE>
<TE>   Romer has also said that to cover health benefits for district
employees, the board must find at least an additional $30 million
that is not currently included in the budget.</TE>
<TE>   The board approved the sale, for $12 million, of 7.6 acres in
Sullivan Canyon near Pacific Palisades that for 22 years had been
leased to a private equestrian club. The Sullivan Canyon Preservation
Assn., a group of neighbors and horse enthusiasts, bought the
property.</TE>
<TE>   The board also voted 5 to 2 to allocate $7.6 million in change
orders for renovations to the future district headquarters at 333 S.
Beaudry Ave. The increase amounts to 24.99% of the cost of the total
renovation.</TE>

<HD>Mormons Get an OK on Newport Steeple</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Mormons' quest to build a temple with a towering steeple in
residential Newport Beach was bolstered Wednesday by a favorable city
report that concludes the 12-story-high spire fits with the
building's architecture and won't require special approval.</LD>
<LD>   The size of the steeple, topped by a golden statue of a
trumpet-blowing angel, has angered some nearby residents who fear it
will dominate their hillside skyline and decrease property values.</LD>
<LD>   Opponents of the temple's design have set up a Web site with
computer-enhanced photos to show how the spire will obstruct their
views, but they said they haven't seen the just-released
environmental impact report and couldn't comment on its specifics.</LD>
<TE>   Mormon officials said they were pleased with the report.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite nearly six months of extensive analysis," the study
showed that nothing about the project "would result in any
significant adverse environmental impact," said Weatherford T.
Clayton, president of the church's Newport Beach stake, in a written
statement.</TE>
<TE>   Since announcing plans 14 months ago to build Orange County's
first Mormon temple, officials with the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints have agreed to a number of concessions involving
the 17,500-square-foot building on Bonita Canyon Drive near MacArthur
Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Lighting has been reduced by 50% and will be turned off by 11
p.m., unlike most Mormon temples, which are lighted through the
night. The exterior of the art deco building has been switched from
stark white to earth tones. And the church has agreed to landscape
with mature trees.</TE>
<TE>   But soaring steeples are an important symbol in Mormon theology,
and only the president-prophet of the church can authorize those
height reductions, an unlikely event. Newport Beach city codes exempt
churches from the area's 50-foot height restriction.</TE>
<TE>   For Mormons, a temple with gleaming white interiors bathed in
natural sunlight serves as a bridge between heaven and Earth.
Ceremonies such as weddings and baptisms take place at the temple,
which is open only to members in good standing. Southern California
Mormons participating in sacred rites now travel to Los Angeles or
San Diego, where the area's only temples are located.</TE>
<TE>   The spire, which rises 121 feet from the ground, symbolizes the
Mormons' heavenly aspirations and "identifies the temple as a source
of eternal blessings available to the faithful," Clayton said.</TE>
<TE>   Regular services are held in meeting houses.</TE>
<TE>   Residents and others have 45 days to review the city's report
before the project will be considered by the Planning Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Mormon officials originally hoped to break ground on the temple
last spring, but community concerns slowed the process. A temple in
Redlands is nearly half complete. Plans for both structures were
announced on the same day in April 2001.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Cedes MTA Chair to Focus on Secession</HD>
<DH>Transit: Keeping the city intact is too important to divert
time from, he says. Valley Councilman Bernson is his choice for the
influential post.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an admitted nod to the threat of secession, Los Angeles Mayor
James K. Hahn will announce today that he will turn down the
opportunity to head the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn said he will nominate in his place veteran Los Angeles City
Councilman Hal Bernson, a San Fernando Valley representative.
Bernson, one of Hahn's three MTA appointees, declined to comment.</LD>
<LD>   "My focus has got to be on keeping the city together," said Hahn,
noting that the position would entail frequent travel in search of
federal and state transit dollars. "I do recognize the opportunity to
shape transportation policy, but I don't know when I'd have the time
for my [anti-]secession efforts."</LD>
<TE>   Hahn said that stopping secession is more important than chairing
the MTA, because breaking up Los Angeles would dilute the city's
ability to attract funds from Washington. Moves by both the Valley
and Hollywood to split from Los Angeles will be decided by voters in
November.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA chair drives the agenda at the nation's second largest
transit agency, a $2.7-billion behemoth charged with handling some of
the world's worst traffic. When the mayor of Los Angeles heads the
agency, his power is greatly expanded. To pass through key items, a
mayor, in theory, can consolidate his vote with that of his three
appointees. The four votes comprise more than half of the seven votes
needed to muster a majority of the 13-member board.</TE>
<TE>   The chair also decides which members of the board--a body
including the county supervisors, small-city officials and the
mayoral appointees--sit on the important subcommittees from which
contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars flow.</TE>
<TE>   Holding the chairmanship opens up more lobbying power in the
corridors of Washington and Sacramento than the mayor might otherwise
have, said former Mayor Richard Riordan. "That kind of access is key
for the region."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan served on the MTA board from 1993-99, the last three years
as chairman. While Hahn has been on the board for only a year, many
are already comparing his performance negatively with that of the
ex-mayor.</TE>
<TE>   Among many moves, Riordan brokered a federal consent decree to
improve bus service and appointed a highly regarded turnaround
specialist to right the MTA. He also led a difficult charge to halt
subway construction the agency couldn't afford.</TE>
<TE>   While Riordan declined to comment on Hahn's decision, reaction
elsewhere was mixed.</TE>
<TE>   MTA board member and county Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who has
clashed with Hahn on occasion, said he agreed with Hahn's move.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't make much sense for him to take it right now," said
Yaroslavsky, who noted the mayor still has significant clout by
virtue of his control of four votes. "He obviously has a lot on his
plate."</TE>
<TE>   Disagreeing with Yaroslavsky were many who believe Hahn is passing
up a timely chance to alter transit policy. USC professor and transit
expert Jim Moore said the mayor could help fight secession by using
the chairmanship to force the MTA's hand on issues important to the
Valley, such as more funding for freeway carpool lanes.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn is "giving up a huge leadership opportunity by not taking
that role," said USC law professor Erwin Chemerinsky. "In Los Angeles
there are few issues more important to people than transportation....
My guess at this point is that in his mayorship transit has not been
a top priority."</TE>
<TE>   That view has been voiced by many at the MTA since Hahn took over
as vice chair of the board when he became mayor last June.</TE>
<TE>   While he does support an expansion of rapid buses and has shown
some interest in a Crenshaw corridor rail line, Hahn has not
forcefully pushed a bold, visionary project--a light rail line or a
busway, for example--while on the board.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor has also been largely ineffective on the few issues he
has promoted. Early on, Hahn's campaign promise to block a dedicated
busway down Chandler Boulevard in the San Fernando Valley was
defeated after his tepid counterproposal was shot down by the board.
In that case, Hahn appointee Bernson voted against him.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Hahn failed to persuade the board to adopt his position to
stop the MTA's continuing court appeals of the federal consent decree
with the Bus Riders Union over shoddy bus service. The MTA went ahead
with the appeals, increasing its legal fees to more than $4 million,
before being turned away by the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Bernson, after his expected approval by the board, will replace
current chair John Fasana, a Duarte councilman.</TE>

<LD>The world seems to abound with conspiracy theories these days.
Consider this distress call in the police log of the Los Alamitos
News-Enterprise: "One man claimed his neighbors made their large
poodles bark at him whenever he was in his frontyard." I can't see
any merit to this claim. I've never met a poodle that didn't bark at
everyone it saw.</LD>
<LD>   Get this column to the church on time: It's June. Do I have
matrimonial items? I do (see accompanying):</LD>
<LD>   * A bowl for the gardening bride (Dolores Russell of Huntington
Beach)</LD>
<TE>   * A shop that offers some sort of alternative to "weddings" (Jay
Lowy of Encino)</TE>
<TE>   * A supply service of wedding partners off the Santa Ana Freeway</TE>
<TE>   * And, finally, some "loners" that an electronics company makes
available to its sales reps.</TE>

request for "Let Me Go, Lover," the old Teresa Brewer recording.</TE>
<TE>   Numbers games: Remember the embarrassment for the Houston Astros
when they found themselves playing at Enron Field? Well, the Dodgers
aren't quite in that fix. But Norbert Taylor did notice on the team's
Web site that Dodger Stadium will be the site of Foam Finger Day,
compliments of financially troubled Adelphia, on July 20. (I can
think of a use that the company's stockholders would make of those
fingers.) And Aug. 27 is the date of Bubble Watch Night, courtesy of
another entity with moolah problems: Amtrak.</TE>
<TE>   With all these financial crises, I heard an analyst say that "no
one trusts numbers anymore." Who knows who's exaggerating? I mean,
what if the Dodgers cooked their scorebooks? What if the team has
actually lost more games than it has won? What is the infield fly
rule? Only time will tell.</TE>
<TE>   More numbers games: Bob Abrahams of L.A. points out that Laker
fans have a question to ponder in the off-season in the wake of the
team's third straight championship.</TE>
<TE>   Mainly, what phrase will they want to use to describe the fourth
title that the team will surely win next year? (Threepeat would be
outdated, obviously.) I sort of like Fourgone (Laker championships
are Fourgone conclusions these days). Abrahams suggested Four-play.
I'm open to suggestions.</TE>

<HD>Study of Hillside Initiative Called Misleading</HD>
<DH>Ventura: The city attorney offers an analysis of Open 80, a
measure that would clear the way for construction of 1,390 homes and
dedicate open space.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANICA BUTLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura's city attorney has completed an analysis of a proposed
hillside development initiative, which opponents criticized Wednesday
as an inadequate review that does little to help voters sort out the
issues.</LD>
<LD>   "Whether it's intentional or unintentional, because of what [the
analysis] leaves out, it misleads the voters," said county Supervisor
Steve Bennett, a former councilman and an architect of the city's
growth-control laws.</LD>
<LD>   In May, a split City Council voted to ask the city attorney to
prepare a legal analysis of the so-called Open 80 initiative, which
would clear the way for construction of 1,390 homes on hillsides and
dedicate more than 3,000 acres to permanent open space.</LD>
<TE>   The 12-page report by City Atty. Robert Boehm is written in a
question-and-answer format. It essentially states the initiative is
in compliance with an ordinance that prohibits extending city
services into the hillsides without voters' approval.</TE>
<TE>   The report also states the developer would be required to conduct
a full environmental review before construction is approved.</TE>
<TE>   The city would also have discretion to deny building permits if
portions of the development are found to be inconsistent with the
city's master plan.</TE>
<TE>   But Bennett said some questions are written in a way that does not
provide straight answers. One example is a question regarding whether
the city would waive developer fees for donating land as open space,
Bennett said.</TE>
<TE>   "The question is worded to say does the developer 'not have to pay
any fees at all,' when the question ought to be, 'Will the developer
get credits and have many fees waived?' That would have given a
different answer."</TE>
<TE>   An analysis by Save Open Space, an environmental group founded by
Bennett, last month issued its own analysis of the hillside
initiative. It concluded the measure leaves little negotiating power
with the city and would transfer numerous costs for city services to
taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   But Mayor Ray DiGuilio and City Councilman Jim Monahan, both of
whom voted in favor of the analysis, praised it as thorough and fair.
They said the report shows the city would retain discretionary
controls over any hillside development.</TE>
<TE>   Margaret Merryman, spokeswoman for Venturans for Open 80, said
Boehm's analysis provides a fair summary of the initiative.</TE>
<TE>   "It clearly shows that our opponents have misunderstood much about
the initiative," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The political divisiveness sparked by the analysis is why
Councilman Jim Friedman said he voted against its commission.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate to see the city attorney put in an absolute no-win
situation," Friedman said. "People who want Open 80 will use [the
analysis] to their advantage, and people who don't want Open 80 will
use it to their advantage."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Friedman said he believes the analysis was conducted in an
impartial manner.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday the report will be made available to the public but the
council will take no further action on it. The panel, however, is
expected to adopt a resolution to place the initiative on the
November ballot.</TE>

<HD>Pledge of Allegiance Violates Constitution, Court Declares</HD>
<DH>Law: The phrase 'under God,' added in 1954, undermines
separation of church and state, 9th Circuit panel decides. Ruling is
widely derided and will be appealed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA DOLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The Pledge of Allegiance violates the U.S. Constitution because the
words "under God" endorse religion, a federal appeals court ruled
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   In the first such ruling in the nation, a panel of the U.S. 9th
Circuit Court of Appeals struck down a 1954 law passed by Congress
that added the reference to God to the pledge. The court said the
words "under God" violate the establishment clause of the 1st
Amendment, which requires the separation of church and state.</LD>
<LD>   The decision sparked a swift, angry reaction across the nation,
including a flurry of denunciations by public figures including
President Bush and Gov. Gray Davis. Bush called it "ridiculous" and
Davis said he was "extremely disappointed" that a court would rule
against "one of our most profound human expressions of American
patriotism."</LD>
<TE>   The 2-1 ruling prohibits public schools in the nine Western states
covered by the 9th Circuit from reciting the pledge with the words
"under God." Several legal scholars said they do not expect the
ruling to be upheld on appeal, although they said it represented a
plausible interpretation of U.S. Supreme Court precedent.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the odds of that are about as great as an asteroid
hitting Los Angeles tomorrow," said Harvard's Laurence Tribe, a
constitutional law professor.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Alfred T. Goodwin, a Republican appointee of President
Nixon, wrote the ruling and Judge Stephen R. Reinhardt, a liberal
Democrat appointed by President Carter, concurred. It came in a
lawsuit filed by a Sacramento County atheist who was offended that
his daughter's public school teacher led students in reciting the
pledge.</TE>
<TE>   "In the context of the pledge," Goodwin wrote for the court, "the
statement that the United States is a nation 'under God' is an
endorsement of religion." The court panel said the reference to God
is equivalent to a declaration "that we are a nation 'under Jesus,' a
nation 'under Vishnu,' a nation 'under Zeus,' or a nation 'under no
god.' "</TE>
<TE>   In dissent, Judge Ferdinand F. Fernandez wrote that the
Constitution was "not designed to drive religious expression out of
public thought."</TE>
<TE>   "The danger that phrase presents to our 1st Amendment freedoms is
picayune at most," Fernandez wrote.</TE>
<TE>   He warned that the ruling eventually could jeopardize the singing
in public settings of the nation's most treasured patriotic songs and
even make vulnerable the words "In God We Trust" on coins and bills.</TE>
<TE>   " 'God Bless America' and 'America the Beautiful' will be gone for
sure," wrote Fernandez, appointed by former President George Bush,
"and while use of the first and second stanzas of the 'Star Spangled
Banner' will be permissible, we will be precluded from straying into
the third.</TE>
<TE>   "And currency beware!"</TE>
<TE>   Michael A. Newdow, 49, brought the lawsuit on behalf of his
second-grade daughter at an Elk Grove elementary school near
Sacramento. Newdow is an emergency room physician by training and
also has a law degree.</TE>
<TE>   He said he hasn't worked recently and "fights the government" as a
profession. He represented himself in the court case and said he will
argue before the U.S. Supreme Court if the case gets there.</TE>
<TE>   Flushed with victory, Newdow predicted that the decision will be
upheld because it is correct. "I think it's cool the Constitution
gives every citizen the right to defend it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   David W. Gordon, superintendent of Elk Grove schools, said the
district will appeal the ruling, either by asking for a rehearing
before the 9th Circuit or by taking the case directly to the U.S.
Supreme Court. The parties have 14 days to file for a rehearing,
which, if granted, would stay implementation of the decision. If
there is no appeal, the opinion would take effect in 21 days.</TE>
<TE>   'We Need ... the Pledge'</TE>
<TE>   "It's something we feel very strongly about, that we need to
continue saying the pledge in our classrooms," Gordon said. He said
the schools "don't try to impose religion on our kids."</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit stressed in its ruling that the words "under God"
were added to the Pledge of Allegiance by Congress in 1954 to make a
political and religious statement at a time when the country was
terrified of communism.</TE>
<TE>   The pledge was first written in 1892 with no reference to God. A
Baptist socialist minister is generally credited with penning it. "I
pledge allegiance to my flag," wrote Francis Bellamy, "and to the
republic for which it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty
and justice for all."</TE>
<TE>   Public school students first recited the pledge that year when
they saluted the flag in a celebration to mark the 400th anniversary
of Christopher Columbus' voyage to America.</TE>
<TE>   After a campaign by the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic group,
Congress added the reference to God. The 9th Circuit said the sole
purpose of the addition was to "advance religion in order to
differentiate the United States from nations under communist rule."</TE>
<TE>   The statement that the United States is a nation "under God"
professes a religious belief in monotheism, not a mere acknowledgment
that many Americans believe in a deity, the court said.</TE>
<TE>   Goodwin wrote, "To recite the pledge is not to describe the United
States; instead, it is to swear allegiance to the values for which
the flag stands: unity, indivisibility, liberty, justice, and--since
1954--monotheism."</TE>
<TE>   The practice by schools to have teachers lead students in reciting
the pledge "aims to inculcate in students a respect for the ideals
set forth in the pledge, and thus amounts to an endorsement of these
ideals," the court said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to suing his daughter's school district, Newdow also
named Congress, then-President Clinton and the state of California as
defendants. The court said that a president and Congress were not
appropriate defendants in the suit. The court did not address a state
law that requires public schools to begin their days with an
"appropriate patriotic" exercise.</TE>
<TE>   Legal scholars said the ruling was based on a reasonable analysis
of cases decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. The high court has ruled
in recent years that school prayer, graduation prayers at public
schools and student-led prayers at public football games are
unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   "The majority decision is actually a very plausible reading of the
Supreme Court precedents," said UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh, a
conservative scholar.</TE>
<TE>   But he said the ruling was "certainly not an open-and-shut
reading" of the principles set down by the Supreme Court. He said the
ruling conflicts with a decision by the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals
based in Chicago, which found several years ago that the pledge was
constitutional. "The Supreme Court is almost certainly going to have
to decide this," Volokh said.</TE>
<TE>   UC Berkeley constitutional law expert Jesse Choper said he thinks
the 9th Circuit got it right legally, but he also expects that the
Supreme Court will overturn the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "You could get a panel of any federal appellate court anywhere in
the country who could come this way plausibly," Choper said. "They
could. But most judges will say, 'Yeah, but intuitively, this just
goes too far.' "</TE>
<TE>   USC constitutional law professor Erwin Chemerinsky said he agreed
with the ruling and contended that it is impossible to predict what
the high court will do.</TE>
<TE>   "It is an issue largely of symbolic importance," he said. "I could
imagine the court turning this case down, or I could imagine it
taking it because it is an interesting question."</TE>
<TE>   In previous cases, U.S. Supreme Court justices have described the
reference to God in the Pledge of Allegiance as "ceremonial deism,"
not religion.</TE>
<TE>   Choper said references to God have been regarded as "part of a
patriotic ceremony, and that is what is going to make a difference in
the Supreme Court."</TE>
<TE>   Scholars Cite Safeguards</TE>
<TE>   The high court already has ruled that schoolchildren cannot be
required to recite the pledge if they feel it conflicts with their
views, and some scholars said students probably could ask to be
removed from settings where the pledge is recited under case law
decided long before Wednesday's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit panel said voluntary recital of the pledge ignores
the fact that young students may feel coerced.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the age and impressionability of schoolchildren ... the
policy is highly likely to convey an impermissible message of
endorsement to some, and disapproval to others of their beliefs
regarding the existence of a monotheistic God," the court wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Supreme Court justices have made occasional comments in other
cases indicating acceptance of the "one nation under God" wording of
the pledge. "However, the Court has never been presented with the
question directly, and has always clearly refrained from deciding
it," Goodwin wrote in his ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Several critics of Wednesday's ruling observed that each session
of the U.S. Supreme Court is opened with a declaration, "God save the
United States and this honorable court."</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said, "This ruling is
ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer was asked if the president supported a call by the
National Republican Congressional Committee to urge House members to
tell school districts to ignore the decision. "I don't think it comes
down to what anybody is telling people," Fleischer said. "People are
going to feel very strongly about this themselves and take the
actions that they are going to take."</TE>
<TE>   Brian D. Myers, an Elk Grove school board member, noted that
district students have long had the opportunity to "opt out" of the
pledge or skip the "under God" line. He said the court should have
found a way to accommodate those who don't choose to recite the
pledge without "throwing the baby out with the bathwater."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Scott Gold contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Prison Guards' Sick Leave Usage Soars as Rules Shift</HD>
<DH>Labor: Union is donor to Davis. He OKd change, which
matches other agencies, aide says.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>In the four months after Gov. Gray Davis agreed to a new and looser
sick-leave policy sought by the prison guards' union, sick leave by
the officers jumped 20% over the same period last year.</LD>
<LD>   The new policy is part of the labor agreement negotiated by the
Davis administration and the California Correctional Peace Officers
Assn., and approved by the governor and Legislature in January. The
pact also promises correctional officers a pay increase of up to 34%
over the next five years, at a cost of $680 million by 2006, when the
final raise kicks in.</LD>
<LD>   Critics say other provisions, such as the one dealing with sick
leave, will also add to the state costs. If the current trend of
officers calling in sick continues for the rest of the year, the jump
will cost the state an extra $12.5 million. Spokesmen for the
Department of Corrections and the union that represents California's
27,000 prison officers said they were unaware of any disease outbreak
afflicting prison workers during the first four months of 2002.
Rather, they cite the new labor contract, and the limits it places on
wardens who want to discipline officers for using extraordinary
amounts of sick leave. A union executive said the contract gives
officers "newfound freedom" to call in sick without fear of
retribution.</LD>
<TE>   The Corrections Department reported that the related cost of
overtime also jumped 20%, to $58.4 million, in the first four months
of 2002, worsening the prison system's $277-million budget shortfall
and the state's projected deficit of nearly $24 billion. Officers are
forced to work overtime to cover for colleagues who call in sick.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to the soaring use of sick time by state prison
guards, the state's other major law enforcement agency, the
California Highway Patrol, reports that sick leave increased less
than 1% in the first four months of the year, at a cost of $33,796
more than last year's tab for that period. Overtime costs at the CHP
rose 7%.</TE>
<TE>   Some lawmakers and others have criticized the contract with the
prison guards, saying its terms are too generous and questioning the
Davis administration's role in cutting the deal. The guards' union
has given Davis $662,000 in direct and indirect donations since he
took office in 1999, and it spent $2 million to help elect him in
1998.</TE>
<TE>   As the use of sick time in state prison grows, other records
suggest that overtime is accounting for a large percentage of some
officers' salaries. Records released by the state controller's office
show dozens of prison officers making such heavy use of overtime that
they will double their pay, which is $55,248 for veterans. With
overtime earnings through May, at least 80 correctional officers will
earn $100,000 or more in the fiscal year that ends Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's crazy that correctional officers are making more than
schoolteachers," state Sen. John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara) said.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) called the run-up in sick
leave and overtime "unbelievable, unreal," adding: "They're going to
bankrupt the state at the rate they're going."</TE>
<TE>   The costs are relatively small given California's overall budget
of $100 billion. But as lawmakers consider deep cuts and tax
increases as they try to close the budget gap, Polanco said it
represents "a lot of money to people facing cutbacks in health care
or closure of senior services."</TE>
<TE>   Davis signed legislation implementing the new contract in
mid-January. Two months later, the California Correctional Peace
Officers Assn. contributed $251,000 to the Democratic governor's
reelection campaign, bringing its total to $662,000 in direct and
indirect donations since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   'Extraordinary Use' List</TE>
<TE>   At the union's behest, Davis administration negotiators eliminated
one tool used by wardens to discipline officers who would call in
sick frequently--the "extraordinary use of sick leave" list.</TE>
<TE>   Under that old system, wardens could place employees on the list
if they called in sick more than five times covering nine days in a
year; if employees repeatedly took sick days immediately after days
off; or if they called in sick after having already been denied a day
off. Once on the list, employees were required to provide notes from
doctors justifying sick leave.</TE>
<TE>   The new contract says "employees shall not be denied the right to
use sick leave or be subjected to any corrective or disciplinary
action, or in any manner discriminated against for use or attempting
to exercise their right to use sick leave based solely on the amount
or frequency of use."</TE>
<TE>   Corrections Department spokeswoman Terry Thornton said, "The new
agreement has taken away one of the management tools for managing
sick leave." Joe McGrath, warden at the maximum-security Pelican Bay
State Prison in Crescent City, told lawmakers in April that the
contract creates "significant" challenges for managers trying to
limit sick leave abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to have a real uphill battle when I start in on the
correctional officer that I know was out fishing yesterday," McGrath
told a budget subcommittee chaired by Polanco.</TE>
<TE>   Defending the new sick leave policy, Mike Jimenez, executive vice
president of the officers' union, said officers are not abusing it,
adding, "I don't know that a 20% increase is totally out of the norm
for this occupation.</TE>
<TE>   "Officers for the first time feel they can use sick leave without
fear of intimidation," he said. "There is a newfound freedom here. In
the past, the Department of Corrections has used tactics that were
intimidating and threatening."</TE>
<TE>   Department of Personnel Administration Director Marty Morgenstern,
the Davis appointee who oversees labor negotiations, said he agreed
with the union that the "extraordinary use of sick leave" list caused
resentment among prison employees. He said one reason for the jump in
sick leave could be that officers are "blowing off steam" now that
the list is no longer used.</TE>
<TE>   "The union made to me a very good case that it was a highly unfair
rule," Morgenstern said, noting that officers could be undergoing
chemotherapy and end up on the list. "It is very difficult to run a
prison ... and we make allowances for that. But that [rule] just
seemed too unfair."</TE>
<TE>   Davis Press Secretary Steve Maviglio said that upon being informed
of the jump in sick leave, the governor directed that Morgenstern
"immediately review the situation and take all actions to make sure
the system is not abused." Maviglio added, however, that the
"extraordinary use of sick leave" list was unique to the Corrections
Department, and said, "This new contract reflects what every other
state employee has."</TE>
<TE>   In January, the month that Davis signed the contract, prison
guards' use of sick time rose to 8,164 hours, 5% above the 2001 level
for that month. In February, it climbed by almost 15,000 hours, or
10.6% more than the previous February. In March, sick leave increased
by 43,634 hours, or 30%. And by April, sick time had shot upward by
46,543 hours, more than 33% above April 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Line officers are not the only ones calling in sick. During the
first third of the year, correctional sergeants' use of sick leave
shot up 36.9% after having dropped during the same period last year.</TE>
<TE>   No Bonus Pay Included</TE>
<TE>   As negotiations began over the new contract, Corrections
Department officials sought authority to provide financial incentives
to officers who limited their use of sick time. However, the final
contract includes no such bonus pay. Morgenstern said the
department's suggestions would not have saved the state money, or
would have been rejected at the bargaining table.</TE>
<TE>   Use of sick leave adds to prison costs by driving up overtime, for
which officers receive pay at the rate of time and a half.
Corrections spokeswoman Thornton said the department's overtime has
been higher lately because of the heavy use of sick time and because
many officers who are reservists have been called to active military
duty. She predicted that overtime costs will abate as the department
fills about 1,100 vacancies for correctional officers.</TE>
<TE>   Records released by state Controller Kathleen Connell suggest that
officers are making more use of overtime now than they were two years
ago, when the Bureau of State Audits found overtime to be so
lucrative that 5,000 correctional officers made more in annual pay
than their direct supervisors in the 1998-99 fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   "With overtime earnings so high," the audit said, "many
lower-level custody staff may be content to remain in their present
positions and not seek advancement.... In fact, department officials
told us that some sergeants and lieutenants have asked to be demoted
to the rank of correctional officer."</TE>
<TE>   Connell's records show that at San Quentin State Prison, at least
10 officers stand to make more this year than wardens' pay of
$100,932. At the top, one officer logged 1,731 hours of overtime in
the 11-month period ending in May, grossing an extra $69,831. That
officer stands to make $125,079 by the end of the fiscal year June
30--or $1,824 more than the head of the Corrections Department.</TE>

<HD>SAT to Add: a) An Essay b) Anxiety c) Both</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For generations of college-bound students, taking the SAT admissions
test has meant three stress-filled hours spent darkening tiny printed
bubbles with a finely sharpened No. 2 pencil.</LD>
<LD>   That enduring rite of passage, or at least part of it, is on the
verge of major change.</LD>
<LD>   The College Board, which owns the SAT, is expected to announce
today that it will add a writing test, including an essay, to the
exam, which would stretch the test to as long as 3 1/2 hours.</LD>
<TE>   That and other revisions could amount to the most sweeping
overhaul of the SAT in its 76-year history, according to college
admissions officers and testing experts. The changes are set to be
announced after a meeting of the College Board's trustees, and would
take effect for the class entering college in the fall of 2006.</TE>
<TE>   The new SAT is likely to include a tougher math test and a revised
verbal exam, with more reading comprehension questions than before.
But it is the prospect of the writing test--and especially, a
handwritten essay departing from the multiple-choice format--that
marks the most profound shift, and the one most likely to send
shivers through many of the 1.3 million students who take the test
each year.</TE>
<TE>   Armed only with pencil and paper, students would have 20 to 30
minutes--the time is not yet set--to respond to, or argue a position
on, a statement such as, "Any advance involves some loss," or "The
more things change, the more they stay the same." The rest of the
writing test would be composed of multiple-choice editing questions
on grammar and sentence structure, College Board officials say.</TE>
<TE>   The board is expected to drop the verbal analogies that have
bedeviled millions of students over the years. The analogies section
likely would be replaced with more reading comprehension questions.</TE>
<TE>   For this year's eighth-grade graduates, that would mean escape
from puzzlers such as whether "clay:potter" is most analogous to
"stone:sculptor" or, for example, "chalk:teacher." (The College Board
says it's "stone:sculptor.")</TE>
<TE>   The New York-based nonprofit board first announced in March that
it was considering major changes to the SAT. The board's willingness
to shift the content--and, some say, the philosophy--of the SAT
stemmed from growing debate about the test across the country and,
most significantly, pointed criticism from the powerful University of
California.</TE>
<TE>   In a major speech in February, UC President Richard C. Atkinson
proposed that the university drop the SAT as an admissions
requirement, saying it was unfair to many students and tested
ill-defined notions of college aptitude. Since then, the proposal has
gained momentum among the university's faculty.</TE>
<TE>   UC's nine-campus system, the SAT's biggest client, has said it
wants an entrance exam that is more closely tied to what students
learn in high school and that includes a writing sample. The UC
regents had planned to vote on the decision in July, but may delay
the vote to give them time to study the College Board's changes.</TE>
<TE>   Carla Ferri, the university's systemwide director of undergraduate
admissions, was reluctant to comment on the proposed changes to the
SAT before they become official. But she said UC officials generally
support many of the planned revisions and are pleased about the
likely inclusion of a writing test.</TE>
<TE>   "Writing is essential to everything we do at the university,"
Ferri said.</TE>
<TE>   College admissions officers say adding a writing sample to the SAT
would provide them with something not often seen in most college
applications these days--an essay they can be sure was written
exclusively by the student, without help from an adult or the
Internet.</TE>
<TE>   But formulating and writing an essay during a timed, high-stakes
entrance exam is many college-bound students' notion of a nightmare.
Chavonne Taylor of South- Central Los Angeles sympathizes with the
Class of 2006 and is grateful not to be among them.</TE>
<TE>   "They're just adding something else for you to stress over
unnecessarily," said Taylor, 17, a recent graduate of Manual Arts
High School. "This is just another addition to make it even harder."</TE>
<TE>   Some veterans of the SAT, however, say a writing sample might have
helped them.</TE>
<TE>   Annettr'e Johnson, 18, a recent Jordan High School graduate who
won a college scholarship because of an essay she wrote, says the
inclusion of an essay on the SAT might have boosted her low math and
verbal scores.</TE>
<TE>   "My SAT scores don't show how smart I am," said Johnson, who plans
to attend Cal State Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   She said she found the rows upon rows of answer bubbles on the
test confusing. "But when you write an essay," she said, "you are
writing what you feel."</TE>
<TE>   College Board officials have said the handwritten essays would be
reviewed by two readers, who would score it on a scale of 1 to 6, and
a third reader if the two initial readers didn't agree. The essays
would then be scanned onto a computer Web site accessible to
admissions officers at schools where the student had applied.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Poch, dean of admissions at Pomona College in Claremont,
said he would be interested to read the essays of Pomona applicants,
partly to compare them with the typically more polished writings
submitted with applications. But he would prefer to receive the SAT
essays unscored, he said, to judge them for himself. College Board
officials have said sending out unscored essays is unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   The SAT essays are not likely to be read by the harried admissions
officers at much larger schools.</TE>
<TE>   At UCLA, which receives nearly 40,000 applications a year, more
than any other college in the country, admissions director Vu Tran
said the writing test score would be one of many factors considered,
but the essay would not be read.</TE>
<TE>   Without an admissions staff trained to evaluate writing skills,
Tran said, "I don't see any benefit in us reading that at all."</TE>
<TE>   Among some students--and their parents--anxiety is already brewing
over the writing exam, test preparation services say. And it's likely
to be very good for business.</TE>
<TE>   Writing is the one academic skill that can be counted on to
"really freak kids out," said Seppy Basili, vice president of Kaplan
Inc. He advises students not to panic, to spend five minutes
organizing their thoughts and settling on an approach to the
question, then dive in.</TE>
<TE>   He sees advantages for those who don't do well on multiple-choice
tests. Because there aren't right or wrong answers on essay
questions, the score on a student's writing exam is often the easiest
one to improve, he said.</TE>
<TE>   With the revised SAT likely to be used for the first time in 2005,
the College Board would have relatively little time to design, write
and field-test its new questions. But it would not be starting from
scratch.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the SAT's new writing section probably would resemble the
SAT II writing test, an hourlong exam that is one of a series of
achievement tests offered by the College Board, said Wayne Camara,
the College Board's vice president of research and development.
Sometimes called subject tests, the SAT II exams are taken annually
by fewer than a fifth of the high school students who take the SAT.</TE>
<TE>   Several dozen of the nation's choosiest schools, including the
University of California, now require the SAT II writing test, which
the College Board indicates may be revised as well, or eventually
scuttled as redundant.</TE>
<TE>   The addition of the writing test would increase the maximum
combined score on the SAT's three sections--verbal (to be renamed
"critical reading"), math and writing--from 1600 to 2400.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of scoring the writing test would also add between $7 and
$11 to the price of the SAT, which will be $26 this fall, Camara
said.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the writing exam, Camara said, trustees today also will
consider changes to the math test, including adding questions on
advanced algebra.</TE>
<TE>   But decisions on some issues may be deferred, Camara said,
including whether to require all students to take the writing test
even if the colleges they apply to don't require it, or to give
students a choice.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that writing is extremely important, whether you're an
engineer, a teacher or a poet," he said. "But not all colleges are
requiring it for admission. Maybe they'll all move that way in the
future, but right now, it's hard to say."</TE>

<HD>Lawmaker Urges Boroughs for Valley City</HD>
<DH>Breakup: Keith Richman attacks such a plan for all of L.A.
while declaring secession mayoral bid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first mayoral candidate for a proposed San Fernando Valley city
said Wednesday he would push for creation of a borough system for the
new municipality, but that a current borough plan for Los Angeles is
"too little, too late."</LD>
<LD>   Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge) called for a Valley
borough system while formally declaring his candidacy. The mayor's
race will be on the same Nov. 5 ballot as a measure that would split
the Valley from Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Some City Council members have proposed putting a borough plan on
the ballot as an alternative to the secession measure.</LD>
<TE>   "It would result in very large boroughs in the city of Los Angeles
and still be under the guidance of an ineffective and inefficient
bureaucracy," Richman told about 40 supporters at a North Hollywood
health clinic. "Boroughs under my leadership in the San Fernando
Valley are going to provide a locally responsive government that is
accountable to the residents."</TE>
<TE>   Richman, 48, said he will release details of his proposal in
coming weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The lawmaker also outlined a platform for improving public safety
and transportation in the Valley, and promised to cut taxes and speed
approvals of business and construction permits to help stimulate the
local economy.</TE>
<TE>   Richman got a taste of the campaign give-and-take when about a
dozen sign-carrying opponents of the Ahmanson Ranch housing
development showed up at his news conference to protest his support
of the project, planned for the eastern edge of Ventura County north
of Calabasas.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm here representing a lot of Valley residents to say this is a
disastrous development and it is going to affect all our lives in a
horrible way," said Cristi Tandy of Woodland Hills. Richman later
said he is prepared to change his mind on Ahmanson if a pending
environmental study shows the 3,050-home subdivision would be wrong
for the area.</TE>
<TE>   "I await to see the new environmental impact report and look
forward to meeting with people on both sides of the issue," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The mayoral post Richman is seeking will exist only if a majority
of voters, both in the Valley and citywide, approve Valley
independence. A secession proposal for Hollywood will also appear on
the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Local Agency Formation Commission on Wednesday
rejected a request by Valley activist Harry Coleman to reconsider its
decision to put the secession measure before voters. The commission
said Coleman did not pay the fee to have the request processed.</TE>
<TE>   Next month LAFCO is expected to turn down the city's request for
reconsideration.</TE>
<TE>   In another development, Mayor James K. Hahn's office on Wednesday
released a letter from the Studio City Residents Assn. that states it
has quit the pro-secession group Valley VOTE. The association has not
yet taken a position on secession. Also Wednesday, a Latino civil
rights group suggested that a Hollywood city council eventually be
elected by district rather than at-large. The secession measure calls
for at-large council members, a system the Mexican American Legal
Defense and Educational Fund says dilutes the Latino vote. MALDEF
wants a switch to district elections within two years of a secession.</TE>

<HD>Pilots, Controllers Blamed in Burbank Crash</HD>
<DH>Airlines: Jet that slid onto street approached too fast at
too steep an angle, the NTSB says.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Errors by the pilots and air traffic controllers caused the
crash-landing of a Southwest Airlines jet at Burbank Airport two
years ago, federal officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The National Transportation Safety Board said the twin-engine
Boeing 737 was going too fast and descending at too steep an angle as
it touched down on the runway about 6:15 p.m. on March 5, 2000.</LD>
<LD>   The 108,000-pound plane skidded out of control, slid off the end
of the runway, smashed through a blast-fence barrier and came to rest
on a busy street. Two of the 137 passengers were seriously injured
and the captain and 41 passengers suffered minor injuries.</LD>
<TE>   NTSB investigators said controllers directed the plane onto an
approach path that was too high as the jetliner approached the San
Fernando Valley airport after a routine flight from Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   "The pilots should have aborted the landing, done a go-around,"
said an NTSB source who asked not to be named. "They tried to put the
plane down anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said the plane swooped down onto the runway at a
six-degree angle, about twice as steep as usual. The jetliner touched
down at 200 mph, about 50 mph faster than normal.</TE>
<TE>   "That was way too fast, and that meant trouble," Barry Schiff, a
retired Trans World Airlines pilot and air crash consultant said.</TE>
<TE>   As the jetliner touched down on Runway 8, the pilots activated the
engine thrust reverser, slowing the plane. But the NTSB said the
pilots failed to apply the wheel brakes with full force, and as a
result, the jetliner burst through the barrier at the end of the
6,032-foot runway.</TE>
<TE>   "Had the accident flight crew applied maximum manual brakes
immediately upon touchdown, the airplane would likely have stopped
before impacting the blast fence," the final NTSB report said.</TE>
<TE>   The plane's captain, Howard Peterson, a veteran with 11,000 hours
of flight time, exclaimed, "My fault! My fault!" as the jetliner
skidded through the fence, according to a transcript of the cockpit
voice recorder recovered from Flight 1455.</TE>
<TE>   When the plane finally stopped, just short of a gas station at
Hollywood Way and Burton Avenue, Peterson told his co-pilot, Jerry
Erwin, "Well, there goes my career."</TE>
<TE>   Peterson and Erwin were fired a few weeks later. Erwin won
reinstatement after his union filed a grievance. Peterson had his
firing overturned and was allowed to retire.</TE>
<TE>   Last October, in an effort to limit its costs in more than two
dozen lawsuits filed in connection with the accident, Southwest said
it was willing to concede that pilot negligence was to blame.</TE>
<TE>   The NTSB report said efforts to evacuate the plane were slowed by
an escape slide that inflated inside the plane and blocked an exit.
The board asked the Federal Aviation Administration to order slide
latches fixed on many Boeing 737s to prevent unintentional
inflations.</TE>

<HD>County Files Suit to Block Redevelopment Plan for Downtown</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County has filed a lawsuit to stop the city's massive
downtown redevelopment plan, alleging it will illegally deprive the
county of $278 million in taxes. The move could create a major
obstacle for backers of a $1-billion hotel and entertainment
district.</LD>
<LD>   Though the primary conflict is over 30 acres of parking lots near
Staples Center, the lawsuit jeopardizes the entire 879-acre City
Center redevelopment project, which is supposed to create thousands
of jobs and low- and medium-income homes, and millions of square feet
of commercial space.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisors, who voted to sue in late May, complained that the
redevelopment area is a tax giveaway that will deprive the county of
money for programs such as cash-strapped public hospitals.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a heist of county money," said Supervisor Zev
Yaroslavsky. "Over its lifetime, this will cost us [more than] a
quarter of a billion dollars in lost revenue. That's just
unacceptable."</TE>
<TE>   City officials have said the plan is necessary to revitalize the
South Park, Historic Downtown and City Markets neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "I am disappointed that the County of Los Angeles has chosen to
use taxpayer dollars to block urban redevelopment," Mayor James K.
Hahn said. "This lawsuit will delay our efforts to build affordable
housing and eliminate blight in an area that sorely needs this kind
of development."</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Jan Perry, who represents the area, said she thought
the area was well thought out but remained hopeful that the city and
county would resolve their differences. "We all have the same goals,
which is to build more housing in the redevelopment area,
particularly for people who are homeless," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Dennis Zine, one of three members to oppose the plan,
said the proposal was a "bait-and-switch" that was presented as a way
to help the poor while the real beneficiaries would be private
developers.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council approved the City Center plan in May, and the
county voted to sue a week later. The papers were filed in Los
Angeles Superior Court on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   If the entertainment district stands, the city's Community
Redevelopment Agency will receive 60% of future property tax revenue
on the condition that it invest the money in the district. Twenty
percent would go into a housing trust fund, and the remaining 20%
would go to the normal taxing entities: the city, county, Los Angeles
Unified School District and community college district.</TE>
<TE>   CRA officials declined to comment on the lawsuit because they
hadn't yet received it.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors said that over the next 45 years, the plan would
deprive the county of $278 million in new property tax revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The 30 acres--the primary conflict between the city and the
county--is composed of parking lots slated to be turned into a
$1-billion entertainment and sports district by the Anschutz
Entertainment Group. The land will include a 1,200-room hotel that
would serve the convention center, a 600-room hotel, 1.1 million
square feet of retail, entertainment and restaurants, a 7,000-seat
theater, 800 homes, 300,000 square feet of office space and parking.
The hotels are viewed as the only way to improve the fortunes of the
struggling Convention Center.</TE>
<TE>   Anschutz officials declined to comment on the suit Wednesday, but
the threat of legal action was one of the reasons the group gave two
weeks ago for abandoning its plans to build a 64,000-seat football
stadium in South Park.</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky said the only reason the city included the land in the
district was to get more property tax revenue at the county's
expense.</TE>
<TE>   But others are not so sure. A consultant's study says that the
area will need $67 million to $115 million in public subsidies, which
could be provided through the redevelopment plan.</TE>

<HD>Jury Convicts 6 of Smuggling Immigrants</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Six defendants on trial in connection with an elaborate Ukrainian
immigrant smuggling ring were found guilty Wednesday in U.S. District
Court.</LD>
<LD>   After deliberating for less than three days, the jury reached
verdicts against six of the seven people accused of smuggling
immigrants from Ukraine into the United States via Mexico, and
forcing many of them into prostitution.</LD>
<LD>   The trial, which lasted about seven weeks, included wiretap
transcripts and testimony from Ukrainian immigrants who said they
were smuggled into the country and several who said they worked as
prostitutes for the defendants.</LD>
<TE>   Serge Mezheritsky, 36, of Hollywood; Tetyana Komisaruk, 50, of
North Hills; and her husband, Valeriy Komisaruk, 40, were found
guilty of smuggling, money laundering, conspiracy and smuggling for
the purpose of prostitution.</TE>
<TE>   Tetyana Komisaruk's daughter, Lorina Latyshev, and son-in-law,
Oleksander Latyshev, also were found guilty of smuggling. Another
defendant, Grigoriy Chernov, who remains free on bail until
sentencing, was found guilty of smuggling.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the jury told Judge Robert Takasugi that it could
not reach a unanimous verdict on Nataliya Korolova, another daughter
of Tetyana Komisaruk.</TE>
<TE>   A 45-count indictment from the Los Angeles County Grand Jury
listed 29 immigrants who paid the defendants thousands of dollars to
travel to Mexico and then be brought across the border.</TE>
<TE>   In May, Olena Krivolapchuk, 22, testified that she worked as a
prostitute and dancer at a topless club in Los Angeles to repay a
$5,000 debt for her trip from Ukraine. Five other defendants
previously pleaded guilty. Federal authorities are seeking six
fugitives.</TE>
<TE>   The six defendants, who will be sentenced in October, face a
minimum of five years in prison.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Husband Denies Abuse in Attempted Drowning Case</HD>
<DH>Court: Port Hueneme couple had a troubled marriage, father
admits. Woman is charged with trying to kill their two children after
learning he had filed for divorce.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The ex-husband of a Port Hueneme woman accused of trying to drown
their two children told a jury Wednesday that he never beat, kicked,
cheated on or threatened to kill his former wife, as she alleged.</LD>
<LD>   But he acknowledged that their marriage had been deeply troubled
and that he had secretly sought a divorce in their native India three
years ago to get away from her.</LD>
<LD>   "She would just cuss at me and tell me, 'You are just like a dog,
going everywhere,' " said 43-year-old Santokh Virk, testifying about
his ex-wife's allegations of infidelity. He said the couple fought
often. But he denied that the arguments led to violence or police
involvement.</LD>
<TE>   The husband's testimony stands in stark contrast to the portrait
of marital discord offered by the defense during opening statements
in the trial of 42-year-old Narinder Virk in Ventura County Superior
Court this week.</TE>
<TE>   She is charged with two counts of attempted murder for allegedly
trying to drown her son and daughter, then 9 and 6, in Channel
Islands Harbor on Jan. 12, 2000. She has pleaded not guilty by reason
of insanity.</TE>
<TE>   Narinder Virk's attorney contends she was a battered wife who
suffered a mental breakdown after learning that her husband had
walked out on the family and boarded a plane for India.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors say the defendant was so angry that she decided to
punish her spouse by killing his children. The couple have since
divorced.</TE>
<TE>   In court Wednesday, Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Simon sought
to discredit the abuse allegations by offering evidence that Santokh
Virk provided for his family and was not the lout portrayed by the
defense in its opening statement.</TE>
<TE>   An employee at Santokh Virk's Port Hueneme liquor store testified
that when his boss left for a six-month trip to India three years ago
he made arrangements for his wife and children to get groceries and
cash from the store and did not leave them destitute.</TE>
<TE>   However, Deputy Public Defender Cynthia Ellington noted on
cross-examination that the groceries consisted mostly of snack foods
and gallons of milk.</TE>
<TE>   Santokh Virk testified that his marriage was arranged. The couple
lived in India for several years before he moved to the United States
in 1984. The next year, he married an American woman to stay in the
country legally. He said he later sent for Narinder to join him in
California</TE>
<TE>   By 1997 marital problems had begun, he testified. They argued
often. She accused him of infidelity. In late 1998, Santokh Virk left
for India without telling his wife and stayed for six months. It was
during that time, he said, that he filed for divorce.</TE>
<TE>   He told the jury that when she received the court papers from
India in late 1999 she refused to accept them. It was around that
time that he decided to leave again.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 11, 2000, Narinder Virk called the liquor store looking
for her husband and a clerk told her he was on a plane to India,
according to court testimony. Three hours later, she allegedly walked
the children, who could not swim, to the harbor and pushed them in.</TE>

<HD>Police Still Hunting for Gunman Who Killed College Student</HD>
<DH>Crime: Jose Pimentel was chatting outside his uncle's home
when he was shot last month by a gang member.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A month after the fatal shooting of a college student on Ventura's
west side, police said they are still no closer to solving the case
or developing solid leads that could lead them to the killer.</LD>
<LD>   "We don't have anything," Sgt. Brock Avery said regarding the May
21 gang-related shooting of Jose Pimentel, 20. "We are still asking
for the public's help. Somebody said something to someone, and now
they have to have the courage to come forward and say something to
us."</LD>
<LD>   As they monitor the police investigation closely, members of
Pimentel's family said coming to terms with the stunning death has
been difficult.</LD>
<TE>   "We're still in shock about what happened," said Pimentel's
24-year-old sister Norma. "We're still coping with it, but I've had
to be strong so I still haven't broken down."</TE>
<TE>   Pimentel, who was taking classes at Ventura College while working
for a beer company in Goleta and dreaming of becoming a police
officer, was gunned down as he chatted with his cousins and some
friends in front of his uncle's Olive Street home about 10:30 p.m. on
May 21.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said a gunman with a shaved head and baggy clothes
walked up to the group and opened fire. The group scattered as the
man fired at least eight rounds and yelled out the name of a
well-known Oxnard gang before fleeing on foot, witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   Pimentel, who police said was not a gang member, was shot once in
the head. He died hours later.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting was part of a surge of violence in Ventura and Oxnard
last month that left two people dead and three injured and spurred
police in both cities to look for a possible connection between the
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard police have made no arrests in the stabbing death of a
15-year-old boy that occurred a day before Pimentel was shot. And no
arrests have been made in connection with a shooting on May 21 in
south Oxnard that sent three teenagers to the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Avery said the Pimentel shooting is similar to the case in May of
last year involving Alfonso Acosta Delgado Jr. The Ventura resident
was gunned down after an early morning standoff with the Ventura SWAT
team. Police considered him the prime suspect in the shooting death
of a Ventura Avenue grocery clerk during a robbery six weeks earlier.
They caught up with Delgado only after chasing leads for weeks and
interviewing and re-interviewing witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   As in the Delgado case, several detectives are working full time
on the Pimentel investigation and have so far conducted nearly 30
interviews of people who may have known something about the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators have sought leads by talking with detectives from
the Oxnard and Port Hueneme police departments as well as with
members of the sheriff's anti-gang unit.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still reviewing reports on the case," Avery said. "The
leads haven't dried up yet. We haven't put this case in the cold
stack."</TE>
<TE>   To say the weeks since the shooting have been painful would be an
understatement, members of Pimentel's family said.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives from the Northern California town of Hayward have been
taking turns visiting every weekend, offering the family comfort and
assisting with household chores.</TE>
<TE>   Family members said plans to move out of their cramped apartment,
a block from where Pimentel died, have been put on hold. Funeral
expenses cost nearly $8,000, which drained a savings account that was
intended to purchase a home.</TE>
<TE>   Pimentel's cousin, Salvador Pimentel, said his family has not
adjusted well to life with out the man they called "Sha Na Na."</TE>
<TE>   Salvador Pimentel, who narrowly missed being shot by the gunman,
said the neighborhood has been gripped with fear since the night of
the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "This guy was on a rampage and it could have been anybody," he
said. "It's going to take awhile for us to be secure. There will
always be that little voice inside saying, 'Look out! Look out!' "</TE>

<HD>For Welfare-to-Work Clients, Social Service Cuts May Hit
Hard</HD>
<DH>Assistance: As O.C.'s budget shrinks, the belt-tightening
begins. One jobs-program worker calls it 'two steps backward' in
helping the poor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On Monday, Claudia Hernandez had little hope she could live and work
in Orange County. By Wednesday, she had new confidence that she might
be hired as a bilingual receptionist and rent her own apartment.
Besides job interview techniques, she'd gotten the beginnings of a
new wardrobe and a coupon for a haircut.</LD>
<LD>   But the welfare-to-work program that changed her attitude in a few
short days is facing significant budget cutbacks. Orange County
supervisors Tuesday approved cutting $39 million in social services
funding, much of it for programs considered a vital safety net by the
working poor and their advocates.</LD>
<LD>   "If we lose this, we lose everything," said Hernandez, 28, who
left her Santa Ana home because of what she called an abusive
relationship and lives in a homeless shelter with two of her five
children. "This helps us with interviews, how to present yourself,
how to clothe yourself and how to develop confidence."</LD>
<TE>   Because a looming state budget deficit will mean a drop in funding
for the county, cuts are planned for welfare-to-work programs,
medical outreach workers, adoptions, day care, job retraining and
transportation that will affect thousands of low-income residents.</TE>
<TE>   Some cuts are expected to take effect as early as Monday. Welfare
officials can't estimate how many people ultimately will be affected.
But one official said cuts may affect at least 5,000 clients of the
county's CalWORKS program, which helps people get off welfare.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors approved $39 million in social services cuts when it
adopted a $4.9-billion budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1, a
budget 4% more than last year's, but one that shaves $57 million
across most county departments.</TE>
<TE>   For poor people, living on the margins of a prosperous Orange
County economy can often mean spending more than 50% of their income
on rent. A cut in an assistance program may mean the difference
between keeping a job or going back on the welfare rolls, say county
social services officials and administrators of nonprofit agencies
that serve the needy.</TE>
<TE>   The cuts also mean that county social service workers will not be
stationed at local hospitals, community medical clinics and family
resource centers.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to reduce the access to programs," said Karin
McGlinn, executive director of Share Our Selves. "We've made enormous
strides under welfare reform, but this is two steps backward."</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez receives $600 from welfare and now participates in a
four-week course provided by Affiliated Computer Services in Anaheim,
a county contract agency that expects to significantly reduce
services to its 2,000 monthly clients.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, though, Hernandez was reviewing job interviewing
techniques in a class of welfare recipients who were learning how to
sell themselves to potential employers. A day earlier, they worked
with another contract agency that provided work clothes.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really scared, but now I think I can't do this without
them," Hernandez said of the agency's employees. "I could never learn
this on my own, and I don't have the money for clothes or anything."</TE>
<TE>   Classmate Tamica Wilkerson, 23, the mother of a 4-year-old,
agreed: "I would be lost without this program. I'd probably be a
fast-food worker for the rest of my life."</TE>
<TE>   Buddy Ray, executive director of Garden Grove-based nonprofit
Community Development Council, which provides consumer education and
assistance to low-income residents, said need will not decrease along
with the cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "For every government service cut, there will be a significant
increase in demand," Ray said. "It is a cascading effect."</TE>
<TE>   Ray's organization stations outreach workers at food banks to
encourage clients to sign up for food stamps. The program eases
demand at local food banks, which have lost as much as 25% of their
donations just in the last year. He said that service will end,
possibly next month, unless private money is found to replace county
funding.</TE>

<HD>Cajon Pass Blaze Closes I-15, 138</HD>
<DH>Wildfire: Residents are evacuated as the flames strand
motorists, destroy at least two homes and consume more than 5,000
acres of brush.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A wildfire raced across more than 5,500 acres in the Cajon Pass on
Wednesday, closing down two highways in both directions, forcing
evacuations, consuming buildings, stranding motorists, and cutting
power to 463,000 homes and businesses.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said they believe that a roadside car fire had ignited
the brush at 4:15 p.m. By 11:30 p.m, it had consumed at least two
homes, two outbuildings and a trailer, and closed Interstate 15, the
main artery between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, and California 138. No
containment was in sight.</LD>
<LD>   Communities in nearby Swarthout Canyon were evacuated, as four
helicopters, 12 air tankers and hundreds of firefighters battled the
flames.</LD>
<TE>   Cars and trucks near the flames inched away from the fire. Some
drivers made U-turns and drove off the wrong way, "trying to bail out
as quick as they can," said Meg McDonald, a spokeswoman for the San
Bernardino County Fire Department.</TE>
<TE>   Freight traffic stopped on nearby rail lines operated by Union
Pacific and Burlington Santa Fe.</TE>
<TE>   The crew of a Union Pacific train headed to Colton from Ogden,
Utah, was trapped briefly as flames burned within 10 yards of the
cars, said Mike Furtney, a Union Pacific official. At first, crew
members were told to get off the train and wait for fire crews to
pick them up. But firefighters couldn't get through to the men,
Furtney said, so they returned to the train to move out.</TE>
<TE>   "We had four carloads of propane at the end of the train, so it
was a hairy few minutes," Furtney said. "It was a close call, but
everybody was able to get out safe."</TE>
<TE>   He said the rail closure would have a significant impact on a
route traversed by as many as 60 trains a day.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very busy route," Furtney said.</TE>
<TE>   The flames damaged transmission lines and shut off power to areas
from Redlands to San Dimas and Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   Electricity was restored to all but a few homes and businesses
within a few hours.</TE>
<TE>   There were no early reports of injuries. The blaze occurred in
virtually the same area where a fire roared across 7,000 acres two
weeks ago and cost $2.6 million to suppress.</TE>
<TE>   Fire investigators said that fire was deliberately set.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's fire began on the east side of I-15 near Pitman
Canyon, where a car was seen "engulfed" in flames, McDonald said. It
soon jumped the freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Another brush fire broke out Wednesday afternoon in Laguna Canyon
and burned about 80 acres, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The fire was ignited about 1 p.m. when a spark created by heavy
equipment striking a rock lighted the brush, said Dennis Shell of the
Orange County Fire Authority.</TE>

reported destroyed.</CP>

<HD>Zoo's Animals Get Star Treatment</HD>
<DH>Veterinarians: A new health center is ready to treat
everything from geckos to gators.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Zoo will unveil its $13.4-million Animal Health and
Conservation Center today, allowing invited guests a first peek at
its gorilla-sized anesthesia machine, pool for treating aquatic
animals and new quarantine facility.</LD>
<LD>   The 29,000-square-foot center replaces the animal hospital built
in the 1960s. Chief veterinarian Bob Cooper said that at the old
facility, "there wasn't the space, there wasn't the sterility, there
wasn't the equipment to deal with both the nature of the collection
we had and [the needs of ] the staff."</LD>
<LD>   Zoo medicine presents special challenges because veterinarians
must treat animals from rhinos to geckos, said Cooper, 47, who
previously practiced at Calgary and other Canadian zoos. He became
chief veterinarian at the Los Angeles Zoo last fall and now heads a
staff of three full-time and two part-time vets responsible for 1,200
animals representing about 300 species.</LD>
<TE>   The new health center, which is closed to the public, is tucked
into a narrow canyon at the back of the Griffith Park zoo. It has
five major areas: a holding wing with animal intensive-care units and
swings for ailing monkeys; a hospital for diagnosis and treatment; a
quarantine area; offices; and the commissary, where animal meals are
prepared.</TE>
<TE>   This week, glamour shots of animals were being hung on the walls
and staff members were still moving into offices on the second floor
of the two-story complex. But the veterinary staff already had begun
using the center for animal care.</TE>
<TE>   Lionel, a 14-year-old lion who had been losing weight and limping,
was recently examined and found to have a deficiency in digestive
enzymes. Methuselah, an older alligator, had growths snipped and sent
to an outside lab for analysis.</TE>
<TE>   One challenge for the vets is that wild creatures often don't look
nearly as sick as they are. "It's certainly my experience that many
of the animals we deal with will show very few symptoms until the
condition is very advanced," said Cooper.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper said zoo medicine has been transformed in recent years by
"an explosion of information" about the health-care needs of animals
in captivity. The field has become a recognized specialty in
veterinary medicine.</TE>
<TE>   Former Los Angeles Zoo vet Charles Sedgwick, who helped design the
complex, said the new health center is smaller but otherwise
comparable to such top-notch animal hospitals as the San Diego Zoo's.</TE>
<TE>   Of the old hospital, Sedgwick recalled: "It was marvelous to have
something designated as the veterinary facility. Before, you just
worked where the animal fell."</TE>
<TE>   Sedgwick said the new surgery suite, which has windows so keepers
can watch procedures and an operating table that can support up to
5,000 pounds, is especially welcome.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're going to give a chimpanzee a hysterectomy or something
like that, you've got a truly sterile surgery," he said. "It has to
be designed something like a swimming pool ... so that you can start
at the ceiling and wash the walls down."</TE>
<TE>   Known as the East Wing, the quarantine area is essential because
animals new to the zoo must be quarantined for at least 30 days to
test for diseases.</TE>
<TE>   The East Wing also is equipped to become one of eight facilities
nationwide approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
in Atlanta for the quarantine of potentially deadly imported
primates, officials said.</TE>

<HD>Park's New Eagles Slow to Leave Nesting Boxes</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A day after nesting boxes holding four young bald eagles were opened
on Santa Cruz Island, one of the birds has left and two others were
last seen standing on the doors apparently still deciding whether to
fly away. The fourth bird remained inside.</LD>
<LD>   The animals are part of a five-year effort to reestablish bald
eagles in Channel Islands National Park. Eagles disappeared from the
area 50 years ago when DDT contamination thinned their eggshells and
stopped successful hatching.</LD>
<LD>   The young eagles were brought to Santa Cruz Island, the largest
island in the park, more than a month ago and have remained in two
locked nesting boxes until they were able to fly. But when the doors
were opened Tuesday morning the birds stayed put. One left later that
night.</LD>
<TE>   On Wednesday two other birds were on the edge of the box looking
around, said park spokesman Tom Dore.</TE>
<TE>   "There are two on the deck right now," he said. "Another is about
100 yards away on a perch. One is still inside."</TE>
<TE>   Park officials hope to introduce 12 bald eagles a year for the
next five years on Santa Cruz Island.</TE>

<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The City Council is expected Tuesday to approve a $183-million budget
for the new fiscal year.</LD>
<LD>   The spending plan would leave a $500,000 surplus if expenses don't
exceed budgeted amounts. The fiscal year begins Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "We're anxiously waiting to spend the surplus, but we have to
restrain ourselves" until after the state budget is approved,
Councilman Tom Holden said.</LD>
<TE>   Oxnard's budget includes a $1.7-million allowance for a sweeping
living-wage policy to be phased in within four years.</TE>
<TE>   The council postponed until July 9 a discussion on the policy,
which calls for contractors and vendors doing business with the city
to pay employees at least $9 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Living-wage advocates are also pushing the council to pass an
ordinance that would impose fines on contractors who do not pay the
higher wages.</TE>

<HD>Wildfire Leaves Apaches With Misery--and Pain</HD>
<DH>Blaze: Tribal areas are devastated, as homes, businesses,
livelihoods are gone.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN and STEVE BERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WHITERIVER, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>Even in good times, this Apache Indian reservation community
struggles from paycheck to paycheck. The 60-year-old homes need paint
and screens, fences miss slats, hulks of old cars sit abandoned in
backyards.</LD>
<LD>   For hundreds of Apaches, Wednesday's paychecks will be the last
for months because their forest has burned. Fire robbed the town of
its main livelihood: ponderosa pines to be milled at the tribe's Fort
Apache Timber Co.</LD>
<LD>   "We will go broke by the end of the month," said Cindy Bennett as
her husband picked up his last paycheck Wednesday at the mill.</LD>
<TE>   About 70% of the 330 employees at the tribal company's two mills
were laid off Monday as the Rodeo-Chediski fire, the nation's
largest, raged through the White Mountains of northeastern Arizona.
The remaining employees will be out of work in two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The fire's devastation is being felt throughout Navajo County--at
least 339 homes destroyed, 410,000 acres of forest charred.</TE>
<TE>   But perhaps nowhere is the economic fallout of the fire felt more
immediately than by the White Mountain Apache Tribe.</TE>
<TE>   In coming days, hundreds of Apaches will run out of money to buy
food and medicine. The tribe already has lost millions of dollars in
revenue that goes toward a variety of social services and the cost of
running its government. There are no trees to cut for the mills, no
elk to attract hunters, no tourists to gamble in its casino or fill
its motels and restaurants--all revenue that feeds the tribe's
general coffers.</TE>
<TE>   The pain is felt in other ways too: Apaches are frequently
targeted with icy stares when they shop off the reservation, blamed
for the fire because it started on their reservation. There is
resentment, too, that the Apaches' suffering is going unnoticed, with
so much attention being paid to the plight of the other mountain
residents.</TE>
<TE>   "It was all Show Low this and Show Low that," said Sandra DeClay,
referring to the city north of here that was besieged by the blaze.</TE>
<TE>   "We are suffering," said Dallas Massey Sr., chairman of the tribe,
which has 12,000 adult members. "Even before this, we had so many
unmet needs, in infrastructure, in housing."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, this tribe was already in a world of hurt. Before this
week's layoffs, unemployment stood at a staggering 60%. Household
income for a full half of the families is below poverty level.</TE>
<TE>   The reservation's beauty belies the economic hardships of those
living here; most of its 1.6 million acres are carpeted in ponderosa
pines; streams and lakes attract anglers, elk attract the hunters.</TE>
<TE>   But in Whiteriver, where tribal government is headquartered in
two, one-story brick buildings, there are only a handful of
businesses--a band, a gas station, a restaurant and small motel among
others.</TE>
<TE>   For the last seven years, Nelson Bennett Jr., 37, made a living
sorting and stacking freshly cut lumber. He earned about $800 a
month; most of it went for groceries and the $235 car payment for his
'93 Chevrolet, chronically in need of repair.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's the utilities, and medicine, and the occasional
toys and clothes for the children. Payday is normally a fun shopping
day for the kids--maybe new shirts, new toys--but that is ending.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett's words Wednesday were pointed. "I'm angry," he said.
"This is the first time I've been laid off."</TE>
<TE>   He's hoping for $300 a month in unemployment, and food assistance
from the tribe.</TE>
<TE>   But the tribe is in little position to help.</TE>
<TE>   It lost $4 million in pending wood sales and $237 million in
future revenue because the fire destroyed more than 700 million board
feet of timber. U.S. Forest Service officials say it will be more
than 100 years before that part of the tribe's forest recovers.</TE>
<TE>   In coming months, mill workers will lose a total of $500,000 in
wages with the end of milling and logging operations.</TE>
<TE>   The tribe's hotel, convention and casino in nearby Hon Dah also
have closed, costing the Apaches $3.3 million in expected revenue
over the next three months.</TE>
<TE>   And one of the tribe's outdoor recreation business has evaporated
too, including $20,000 elk hunts and income from daily fishing and
camping fees.</TE>
<TE>   Altogether, tribal businesses are braced to lose $8.4 million over
the next three months, and untold millions in the future, money to
fund housing and other unmet needs.</TE>
<TE>   All because a small fire began on the reservation June 18, north
of Cibecue. The fire burned for about 24 hours on the
reservation--and firefighters from the tribe and the Bureau of Indian
Affairs thought they had it almost contained when it exploded beyond
their reach, said Robert Lacapa, the BIA's local forest manager.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, outside help was requested. After devouring tribal
woodlands, the fire stretched north into the Apache-Sitgreaves
National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze and a companion fire, which started June 20 when a lost
hiker shot off a flare, merged on Sunday, threatening the evacuated
city of Show Low, population 7,700. By Wednesday, the fire's
perimeter stretched 400 miles and was only 5% contained. The fire
glanced along Show Low's western edge.</TE>
<TE>   Tribal members say they've felt the anger of the neighboring
communities.</TE>
<TE>   As residents fleeing their homes drove through the reservation,
signs were taped to car windows: "Thank you Apaches for burning our
houses."</TE>
<TE>   Sympathy was extended by President Bush, who met with Massey and
Gov. Jane Dee Hull on Tuesday after freeing up federal money to help
fire victims, the tribal chairman said.</TE>
<TE>   But the misery grows.</TE>
<TE>   Rudell Baha, 41, was depressed that unemployment benefits will
fall short in paying mounting bills. Even after working the mill's
saws for 22 years, he said he and his wife have less than $200 at the
end of the month to meet the needs of their seven children.</TE>
<TE>   And that was before this week's layoffs.</TE>
<TE>   His brother-in-law may be able to help, Baha said, but now he has
another mouth to feed--his father's, because he was laid off too.</TE>
<TE>   Sandra DeClay figured she had enough savings to last about a
month. A mill office worker and single mother of three, she figured
she has enough savings to last about a month.</TE>
<TE>   "I just pray," she said, "we all can go back to work soon."</TE>
<TE>   Massey said the tribe--hunters and gatherers before learning the
cattle business--was proud of its economic development over the last
20 years. The tribe launched commercial lumbering as its first
venture.</TE>
<TE>   As the tribe , sorts out its financial future, Massey said he's
embracing the Indian's long view of dealing with adversity.</TE>
<TE>   "Apaches take care of the land, and it takes care of us," he said.
"The land will recover and become stronger, and provide even more
nuts and trees.</TE>
<TE>   "We as a tribe will suffer for now. We may have to tap other
resources, explore other economic development," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "This fire will open the door for new diversity and growth."</TE>

<HD>Study Debunks Added Cancer Risk With 'Pill'</HD>
<DH>Health: Biggest survey ever removes some doubt for 80% of
women born after 1945 who were probable users of contraceptives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oral contraceptives do not increase the risk of breast cancer in
women, regardless of age, race, weight, age, the variety of
contraceptive used, or any other factors, according to the largest
study ever to examine the possible hazards of the "pill."</LD>
<LD>   A 1996 survey of several small studies had suggested that using
the pill produced a small increase in breast cancer risk, but the
massive new study published today) in the New England Journal of
Medicine found no increased risk at all for women who do not smoke.</LD>
<LD>   The findings lift a cloud of doubt that has hovered over the 80%
of American women born after 1945 who have taken the pill at some
time in their lives.</LD>
<TE>   "This is very good news," said Dr. Polly Marchbanks of the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, who led the study. "This is a
very important issue because of ... the high prevalence of oral
contraceptive use."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, this may have been the researchers' last chance to
demonstrate the safety of the pill because there are no longer enough
women who haven't used it to provide an effective comparison group,
added Dr. Robert Spirtas of the National Institute of Child Health
and Human Development.</TE>
<TE>   The pill is not completely without risk, however. In rare cases,
it can cause blood clots, liver cancer and heart attacks in women who
smoke. In contrast, oral contraceptives have also been shown to
reduce the risk of ovarian and endometrial cancer by about 40%.</TE>
<TE>   "But for most women, the benefits of avoiding pregnancy, with its
attendant health risks, clearly outweigh these side effects," Dr.
Kathy J. Helzlsouer and Dr. Nancy E. Davidson of Johns Hopkins
University wrote in an editorial in the same journal.</TE>
<TE>   In light of the new results, they said, researchers should shift
their concern from worrying about the possible adverse effects of
existing contraceptives to the development of newer versions that
protect against breast cancer.</TE>
<TE>   About 200,000 American women are diagnosed with breast cancer each
year and 40,000 die from it. The incidence has been increasing since
the 1980s, and some researchers had feared that the rise was linked
to the growing use of oral contraceptives because breast cancer is
known to be linked to sex hormones. The new findings mean that the
search for causes of that increase will have to shift to other
directions.</TE>
<TE>   In the new analysis, Marchbanks and her colleagues studied 4,575
women who had developed breast cancer and 4,682 closely matched women
who had not.</TE>
<TE>   The women, aged 35 to 64, were questioned closely about their use
of the drugs, as well as about a variety of other potential
complicating factors. About 65% of the women were white and 35%
black.</TE>
<TE>   The team found that 77% of the women with cancer had used oral
contraceptives, compared to 79% of those without the disease--an
insignificant difference.</TE>
<TE>   The team found no link between use of the pill and the development
of breast cancer, no matter how long women had used the
contraceptive, when they started it, how long ago they quit, or how
large an estrogen dose they had received. There was also no increased
risk among women who were obese or among women with a family history
of breast cancer. No racial differences in risk were observed.</TE>
<TE>   "Every which way you looked at it, there was no increased risk"
associated with contraceptive use, Helzlsouer said.</TE>
<TE>   The findings are "very reassuring," said Dr. Duane Alexander,
director of the NICHD, which sponsored the study. "Women between the
ages of 35 and 64 are more likely to develop breast cancer than are
younger women," he said, and the new study shows that the pill does
not increase their risk.</TE>
<TE>   The sole exception to the findings was among women between the
ages of 45 and 64 who are taking the pill to alleviate symptoms of
menopause or to reduce their risk of ovarian and endometrial cancer
and benign breast disease.</TE>
<TE>   The team found a slightly increased risk of breast cancer among
these women, but the number of women studied in this group was too
small to reach any firm conclusions and the increased risk was not
statistically significant.</TE>

<HD>20,000 'Escape Hoods' Delivered to Capitol</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>From Times Staff Report</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON, D.C.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Homeland security became more than an abstract concept this week
with the delivery of 20,000 "escape hoods"--enough to protect every
lawmaker, congressional employee, police officer and tourist from a
chemical or biological attack on the U.S. Capitol.</LD>
<TE>   Congressional staffers, some of whom were shut out of their
offices for more than three months after last fall's anthrax attacks,
on Monday will begin learning how to use the loose-fitting respirator
hoods.</TE>
<TE>   Capitol Police officials said they did not buy the devices--at
about $100 each--because of a specific terrorist threat. Nor is the
timing of training sessions next week related to vague threats of
terrorist attacks on or around the Fourth of July, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Having the gear on hand--the hoods will be stored throughout the
Capitol complex--is a prudent, protective measure, they said.</TE>
<TE>   The State and Energy departments, as well as the Supreme Court
police, the National Institutes of Health, the Federal Emergency
Management Agency and all branches of the military also have
purchased the devices from Survivair, a Santa Ana-based company.</TE>

<DH>Politics: Amendment will allow President Bush to use an
extra $814 million that Democrats had intended for other uses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Senate Republicans Wednesday scored a victory in their effort to
provide the entire $7.6 billion President Bush has sought for missile
defense next year, and signaled strong congressional support for one
of Bush's top priorities.</LD>
<LD>   After two days of intermittent debate, the Senate amended the
defense authorization bill to allow Bush to spend on missile defense
up to $814 million in funds that the Senate Armed Services Committee
had earmarked for military shipbuilding and other purposes.</LD>
<LD>   The latest battle over funds for the program, which is aimed at
protecting the country from long-range missile attacks, had become an
important test of whether opponents of missile defense could weaken
or delay the program.</LD>
<TE>   Missile defense critics saw the committee's action as an
opportunity to slow a high-priced and controversial program that
appears to be gaining momentum. Administration officials and their
allies contended that the panel was trying to "cut the heart" from
the antimissile effort.</TE>
<TE>   Bush had threatened to veto the bill if the money was not
restored. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld declared at a Pentagon
news conference Wednesday that the 12% cut "would be particularly
destructive of the entire missile defense program."</TE>
<TE>   The victory comes in a year when two major obstacles to the
program have evaporated.</TE>
<TE>   The 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty with the Soviet Union, which
restricted development of long-range antimissile systems, was
officially abandoned this month. Foreign opposition to the U.S.
program has also appeared to subside.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate approved two amendments. The first, offered by Sen.
John Warner (R-Va.), said the $814 million could be restored if an
administration review of inflation showed that earlier predictions
were too pessimistic, and that more money than expected would be
available for defense accounts.</TE>
<TE>   The second amendment, offered by Armed Services Committee Chairman
Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), declared that counter-terrorism is the
Senate's top priority for defense spending.</TE>
<TE>   This language, while suggesting that a move by Bush to restore the
money to missile defense would go against the will of the Senate,
would not stop him from doing so.</TE>
<TE>   The bill is expected to receive final approval this week, and then
must be considered by a House-Senate conference committee. The House
earlier approved the administration's full request for missile
defense.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Gaffney, president of the Center for Security Policy and a
longtime missile-defense advocate, said the Senate action was
"absolutely a sign of [the critics'] weakness" and "an important
straw in the wind" about prospects for the realization of the missile
defense project.</TE>
<TE>   Republican leaders wanted a roll call vote on the issue, which
would have been awkward for centrist Democrats who do not want to
appear to be voting against the idea of protecting the nation from
missile attack, Senate aides noted. The amendments were finally
approved by unanimous consent, which left no record of individual
senators' positions.</TE>
<TE>   John Isaacs, president of the pro arms-control group Council for a
Livable World, said the outcome reflected the narrow divisions in
Congress over the issue.</TE>
<TE>   He said he believed Levin would have pressed for a vote on cutting
the $814 million if he thought he could have lined up the needed 51
votes. "But he didn't have that, so he tried to produce the best deal
he could," Isaacs said.</TE>
<TE>   Isaacs said that with the ABM Treaty gone and political opposition
weaker than in the past, the only remaining hurdle for the
administration was the viability of the complex missile defense
technology.</TE>
<TE>   He added: "That's a high hurdle."</TE>
<TE>   In arguing to shift the money, Democrats said they had moved only
funds that were for duplicative or unclear purposes. They contended
that because the missile defense program had about $4 billion left
unspent from the current year's program, officials would still have
about $10 billion to spend next year.</TE>
<TE>   "That is adequate and sufficient in our view," said Sen. Jack Reed
(D-R.I.), chairman of the Armed Services Committee's strategic
subcommittee.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats also contended that the military has other pressing
needs, including shipbuilding and security, and that the missile
defense mission is not as urgent as counter-terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   But Republicans insisted that the missile defense threat is urgent
and growing steadily, from countries such as North Korea, Iraq and
Iran.</TE>

<HD>Key Witness Offers Startling Account of Slaying of Sheriff</HD>
<DH>Trial: Prosecution's hit man turned informant tells of the
night that Derwin Brown was ambushed outside his home. The defense
attacks his credibility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY GETTLEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ALBANY, Ga.</DL>
<LD>The star witness of Georgia's sheriff-killing-sheriff trial took the
stand Wednesday and offered a chilling picture of what happened the
night Derwin Brown was assassinated.</LD>
<LD>   Patrick Cuffy, who was a hit man turned informant, said that two
gunmen were hiding in the bushes, he was in a car and another
accomplice was down the street -- all ready to spring -- when
recently elected Sheriff Brown came trotting up his driveway, arms
full of presents and red roses for his wife. That's when one of the
men pumped 12 shots into Brown with a TEC 9 handgun.</LD>
<LD>   "He fell slowly, slowly. Like this," Cuffy said, closing his eyes
and acting out the death while Brown's family watched in horror from
10 feet away.</LD>
<TE>   Cuffy testified that the outgoing sheriff, Sidney Dorsey, ordered
the hit because he wanted his power back.</TE>
<TE>   "My mission was to follow through with what Mr. Dorsey asked,"
Cuffy said, "and that was to kill Derwin Brown."</TE>
<TE>   But during an edgy cross-examination, a defense lawyer poked holes
in Cuffy's previous version of events--and his credibility.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't always tell the truth, do you, Mr. Cuffy?" asked
attorney Brian Steel.</TE>
<TE>   "Back then, no," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors had promised Cuffy's testimony would be a decisive
moment in the case against Dorsey, the first black sheriff of DeKalb
County, in suburban Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey became a suspect immediately after Brown was cut down on
Dec. 15, 2000--a brazen hit on a reform-minded politician that shook
the Atlanta area--three days before he was to take office.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, a well-liked police officer, had vowed to clean up the
DeKalb Sheriff's Department. Dorsey, like several of his
predecessors, was under investigation on corruption charges. Brown
trounced him after a bitterly contested election.</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey, 62, has said he had nothing to do with the killing.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of local and federal investigators joined the case. But
despite one of the most expansive murder investigations in Georgia
history, authorities had little evidence to go on but a handful of
9-millimeter shells.</TE>
<TE>   Until they struck a deal with Cuffy.</TE>
<TE>   In November, prosecutors granted full immunity to Cuffy, a former
sheriff's deputy who was close to Dorsey, even though he admitted he
helped plot the assassination. The crucial condition was that he
testify truthfully.</TE>
<TE>   In March, two other suspects, including alleged triggerman Melvin
Walker, were acquitted after Cuffy testified against them.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors said they thought Cuffy was lying.</TE>
<TE>   His role as lead witness has created an anxious dynamic in a
courtroom already laced with glares, tears and uncertainty. Brown's
wife, sister and mother sat in the front rows Wednesday, sometimes
crying, sometimes holding hands, with their hopes for justice resting
on the square shoulders of a man who has said, at times almost
boastfully, that he helped kill their loved one.</TE>
<TE>   After Cuffy, 37, stumbled over details of statements he made
earlier, defense attorney Steel asked: "It wasn't truthful what you
shared with the police, was it?"</TE>
<TE>   "No, not all of it," Cuffy replied.</TE>
<TE>   In one exchange, Cuffy vehemently denied ever driving the getaway
car. Then, five minutes later, he admitted he was wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Cuffy also snapped at a defense lawyer using profane language,
drawing a scolding from Judge Cynthia J. Becker. Steel also asked
Cuffy whether he repeatedly listened to the reggae song "I Shot the
Sheriff" after the assassination. Cuffy, a native of the Caribbean
island of St. Croix, said, "Yeah, we played it, but it wasn't like we
were blasting it throughout the house." He added that he is an avid
reggae listener.</TE>
<TE>   The trial is being held in Albany, a small town in the middle of
cotton fields three hours south of Atlanta, because the judge feared
publicity surrounding the case had tainted the Atlanta-area jury
pool.</TE>
<TE>   The trial is in its third week and is expected to continue for
several more days. In addition to murder charges, Dorsey faces
allegations that he solicited bribes, made a female contractor have
sex with him and stole public resources.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Dorsey sat in a dark suit studying Cuffy, who
testified that at one point in his life, Dorsey "treated me like a
son."</TE>

<HD>Scientists Expose Secrets of the First Photograph</HD>
<DH>History: Frenchman used pewter, bitumen and oil of lavender
to create 1827 heliograph.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY SINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1827, Frenchman Joseph Nicephore Niepce placed a metal plate
coated in a strange chemical in the window of his country home. The
concoction baked in the sun for eight hours, creating a hazy image in
silver and black--the first known photograph.</LD>
<LD>   The mystery of Niepce's image has perplexed scientists for years,
in part because it is now too fragile to directly examine.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists at the Getty Conservation Institute announced Wednesday
that they have finally solved its chemical secrets. Through the use
of nondestructive techniques in which different wavelengths of light
were shined on the photograph to determine its chemical makeup, the
scientists confirmed that the plate is made of pewter, and its
chemical coating consists of an asphalt-like substance called
bitumen. They found that Niepce washed the plate using oil of
lavender to expose the finished image.</LD>
<TE>   "Everything in imaging goes to this one moment in history," said
Dusan Stulik, senior scientist at the Getty Conservation Institute.</TE>
<TE>   The analysis was the first scientific examination of the photo.
Understanding the exact chemical composition of the photograph and
the process by which it was made is important to determining how to
preserve the work.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists spent the last two weeks trying to unlock the secrets
of the photo, which has been sealed in box of inert argon gas to
protect against decay. Researchers never touched the plate.</TE>
<TE>   From the new findings, along with historical accounts of the work,
scientists were able to detail how Niepce (pronounced Nee-ps) created
"View from the Window at Le Gras." The bitumen-coated plate was
placed in a simple camera. Portions of the bitumen coating were
hardened by the sun. Less-exposed sections were removed using the oil
of lavender, a common solvent of the time, revealing the image of
farm buildings and a pear tree.</TE>
<TE>   Looking closely at the photograph, which Niepce termed a
heliograph, one can see that the buildings on both sides of the scene
are illuminated, reflecting the changing position of the sun as it
moved across the sky during the eight-hour exposure.</TE>
<TE>   The image is still difficult to see and can only be viewed from an
oblique angle. The shiny plate has been notoriously difficult to
capture with current photographic techniques.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, viewing the plate is "magical," said Ray Flukinger,
senior curator of photography and cinema at the University of Texas
Harry Ransom Center, which owns the photograph.</TE>
<TE>   Niepce, an inventor who also worked on a type of jet engine, began
experimenting with the concept of photography in 1798 as a way to
reproduce engravings. He tested several chemicals, searching for a
light-sensitive compound that could also be "fixed" to the plate to
create a permanent image.</TE>
<TE>   He experimented with silver halides, the photosensitive chemical
used in today's photography, but couldn't find a way to make the
image permanent. The solution was discovered in 1839 by Louis
Daguerre, who is often called the father of photography.</TE>
<TE>   The two men collaborated for several years, but Niepce died in
1833 before their work could be finished. Daguerre continued to build
on principles developed by Niepce to produce the daguerreotype, which
became popular in the mid-1800s.</TE>
<TE>   Niepce's first photograph was lost for almost half a century. It
was rediscovered in 1952 by art collector Helmut Gernshiem in the
attic of a London home, and brought to the U.S. in 1963 when it was
bought by the Harry Ransom Center.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists at Getty Conservation Institute will restore the
original frame of the photo and develop a special oxygen-free box so
the work can be displayed.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Jamie Moyer and a pair of relievers combined on a two-hitter, and
Jeff Cirillo had a run-scoring single in the eighth inning to give
the Seattle Mariners a 1-0 victory over the Oakland Athletics on
Wednesday night at Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   Cirillo's one-out hit up the middle came off Chad Bradford (3-2)
after Charles Gipson singled and stole second.</LD>
<LD>   Moyer blanked the Athletics on two hits for seven innings.
Shigetoshi Hasegawa (4-1) pitched a hitless eighth, and Kazuhiro
Sasaki pitched the ninth for his 18th save in 21 opportunities.</LD>
<TE>   It was Sasaki's 100th career save for Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland's second consecutive loss to the American League West
leaders dropped the A's into third place behind the Angels. Rookie
Aaron Harang gave up two hits in 6 1/3 scoreless innings.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland Manager Art Howe arrived at the game during the fifth
inning after a flight back from St. Louis, where he attended a public
memorial service for Darryl Kile. Howe was Kile's first manager in
Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 7, Cleveland 4--Johnny Damon's bases-loaded triple
highlighted a six-run fifth inning as the Red Sox and Pedro Martinez
overcame three Indian homers to win at Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland led, 4-0, after four innings on homers by Ellis Burks,
Jim Thome and Ben Broussard. Martinez (9-2) had given up only six
homers in his first 15 starts this season.</TE>
<TE>   Damon's fielding also helped Boston end a four-game losing streak.
He made fine catches in the second and fifth innings.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 4, Toronto 2--Tanyon Sturtze ended the longest losing
streak by an American League pitcher this year, stopping his
eight-game skid at St. Petersburg, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Jared Sandberg and Aubrey Huff hit sixth-inning home runs as Tampa
Bay defeated Steve Parris (0-1) to end a six-game losing streak.
Sturtze (1-8) gave up two runs in seven innings.</TE>
<TE>   Esteban Yan worked the ninth for his 10th save.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 8, New York 7--Gary Matthews Jr. singled off Steve
Karsay with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning, stole second
and scored on Tony Batista's single for the Orioles at Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   It was the fourth consecutive victory for the Orioles, who roughed
up Roger Clemens early before beating up on the New York bullpen in
the ninth. Mike Stanton (3-1) took the loss.</TE>
<TE>   Willis Roberts (5-2) worked out of a jam in the top of the ninth,
retiring Derek Jeter and Jason Giambi with the go-ahead run in
scoring position.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 6, Chicago 5--Bobby Kielty drove in a career-high four
runs at Minneapolis to lead the Twins, who played without Manager Ron
Gardenhire.</TE>
<TE>   Gardenhire left the team before the game to be with his family in
Oklahoma after the death of his father. Batting coach Scott Ullger
took over as acting manager.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Lee homered twice for the White Sox, who have one victory
in their last six games. Kyle Lohse (7-5) beat Todd Ritchie (4-10).</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 6, Detroit 5--Aaron Guiel, who spent 10 seasons in the
minors before being called up last weekend, hit his first major
league homer, a three-run shot in the seventh inning that lifted the
Royals at Kansas City, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   Guiel's homer off Jamie Walker landed on the grass beyond the
right-field fence and put the Royals ahead, 6-4.</TE>

<HD>Texas-Sized Homer for Molina</HD>
<DH>Angels: His first of season barely clears fence, but it's a
big moment in 7-6 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ARLINGTON, Texas</DL>
<LD>On Saturday, Angel catcher Bengie Molina was robbed of a possible
home run in Milwaukee by an umpire's call.</LD>
<LD>   "One day, it's going to be mine," vowed Molina, homer-less this
season.</LD>
<LD>   That day was Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   His first home run came against the Texas Rangers at The Ballpark
in Arlington in front of a crowd of 29,726, leading to a 7-6 victory.
The win moved the Angels past the Oakland A's into second place in
the American League West, still 3 1/2 games behind the Seattle
Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   It came on a night when the Angels, losers of three in a row, were
facing a Ranger team that had won eight in a row. It came on a night
when the Angels had fallen four runs behind. It came in the eighth
with a run already in and two men aboard. It came against reliever
John Rocker, a hard thrower who was ringing up pitches in the 95-97
mph range.</TE>
<TE>   It came on a breaking pitch.</TE>
<TE>   And it came as a shock to Rocker.</TE>
<TE>   "Who sits on a first-pitch breaking ball from a guy that throws
95?" Rocker said.</TE>
<TE>   Even as the ball sailed into the Texas night toward the
right-field seats, Molina didn't fully grasp the moment.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think it was going out," he said. "The wind carried it."</TE>
<TE>   Just barely. The ball traveled 359 feet, beyond the reach of right
fielder Juan Gonzalez into the first row of seats.</TE>
<TE>   Molina felt a surge of joy as he circled the bases, not only
because he had hit his first home run since the final day of last
season, but because he had left five men on base in his previous
three at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so frustrated," he said, "because I knew I could have made
a difference. To do this, to tie up the game, this is probably the
happiest day for me this year. I was happier than Joe Carter when he
hit his [to win the 1993 World Series for the Toronto Blue Jays]."</TE>
<TE>   Last Saturday, Molina hit a ball that hit the top of the wall in
Milwaukee's Miller Park and appeared to be on its way out when
outfielder Jeffrey Hammonds trapped it. Umpire Bill Hohn ruled it a
catch.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just glad Jeffrey Hammonds was not playing the outfield for
the Rangers," Molina said.</TE>
<TE>   Molina's shot merely tied the game.</TE>
<TE>   It was left to the top of the order to win it in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   With Hideki Irabu on the mound for Texas, Adam Kennedy, batting
leadoff because David Eckstein had been given the night off, singled
to right with one out. With two out, Tim Salmon singled through a
hole at short, his third hit of the game. Garret Anderson followed
with a double to left-center that scored Kennedy with what proved to
be the winning run.</TE>
<TE>   In the bottom of the ninth, closer Troy Percival had to face Mike
Lamb and then Ivan Rodriguez, Alex Rodriguez and Gonzalez. The last
time up, the power company of Rodriguez and Rodriguez had homered
back to back, Ivan hitting his second of the year and Alex hitting
his American League-leading 23rd.</TE>
<TE>   Percival got Lamb on a fly ball and Ivan Rodriguez on a ground
ball. When he fell behind in the count to Alex Rodriguez, who already
had three hits, Percival walked the Ranger shortstop.</TE>
<TE>   "That lineup is tough to face," Percival said, "and I was having a
real hard time getting the ball down."</TE>
<TE>   With Rodriguez on first, the game came down to a duel between
Percival and Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like I was getting an easier guy," Percival said, "but
at least I had more room to work [with a fresh count]."</TE>
<TE>   Percival got Gonzalez to hit a pop fly into foul territory. First
baseman Scott Spiezio squeezed it to end the game, giving Percival
his 18th save, giving reliever Ben Weber (4-2) the victory and giving
the Angels back the momentum they had lost since coming to Texas.
Irabu (3-7) took the loss.</TE>
<TE>   "They had all the momentum the last few days," Angel outfielder
Darin Erstad said. He did his best to break up that momentum
Wednesday night, getting a single, double and triple.</TE>
<TE>   "They've been kicking our butts," Erstad said. "Molina had a huge
hit. When he hit it, I jumped up and put both my hands in the air. I
looked like a cheerleader."</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Hershiser Out of the Office</HD>

<DL>ARLINGTON, Texas</DL>
<LD>At half past noon Wednesday, it was silent at The Ballpark in
Arlington. With the sun baking the outfield grass, the humidity
hanging heavily over the field and the first pitch of the Angel-Texas
Ranger game still 6 1/2 hours away, there was little reason to
venture out early.</LD>
<LD>   But Texas pitching coach Orel Hershiser was already at work. There
was paperwork to examine, scouting reports to analyze and strategy to
formulate.</LD>
<LD>   This isn't what Hershiser signed on for when he joined the Rangers
in November as assistant general manager under John Hart.</LD>
<TE>   Hershiser pitched in the majors for 18 seasons, appearing in 510
games. He was with the Dodgers from 1983-94, won the Cy Young Award
and the World Series MVP award with them in 1988 and also set a major
league record that season with 59 consecutive scoreless innings.
Hershiser also pitched for the Cleveland Indians, San Francisco
Giants and New York Mets. After finishing up his career back with the
Dodgers in 2000, he worked as an analyst with ESPN last season. Then
came the offer from Hart, the general manager during his seasons in
Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to learn the front office," Hershiser said, "learn
scouting, marketing, see how things are put together in an
organization, learn the other side of the equation."</TE>
<TE>   All that, however, was put on hold last week when the Rangers
fired pitching coach Oscar Acosta.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a communication problem with the pitchers," Hershiser
said.</TE>
<TE>   So how does Hershiser like being back in uniform?</TE>
<TE>   "I've been at this job 72 hours, about one bite into the ice-cream
bar," Hershiser said. "But if it's Rocky Road, I haven't bitten into
any tough nuts yet."</TE>
<TE>   Hershiser is hesitant to talk much about his new position or his
long-term goals.</TE>
<TE>   "This is [Manager] Jerry Narron's team," he said. "This is John
Hart's team. This is not about me. I want to be loyal to Jerry Narron
and I want to help make him the best manager he can be."</TE>
<TE>   When he first retired, Hershiser volunteered to stay in the Dodger
organization and was sent to the team's Albuquerque farm team as an
observer.</TE>
<TE>   Hershiser said that, upon his return, he called Kevin Malone, then
the Dodger general manager.</TE>
<TE>   "He never returned my calls," Hershiser said. "If someone doesn't
return your calls, there are no more assignments."</TE>

<TE>   Record vs. Phantoms--First meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Update--A victory would be the Avengers' third in a row and would
guarantee them their first .500 season. But the team has a bigger
goal: hosting its first Arena playoff game. The Phantoms, who last
year won the Eastern Division in their initial Arena season, are
still in the playoff picture but had lost four of five before
defeating Orlando, 47-34, last week. Los Angeles posted its largest
ever margin of victory in a 62-32 win over Carolina. Avenger
quarterback Tony Graziani (2,589 yards, 50 touchdowns) will test the
league's stingiest defense; Toronto is giving up 41.7 points a game.
The Phantoms' talented secondary will have its hands full stopping
the receiving tandem of Chris Jackson, who leads the league with 26
touchdowns and 158 points, and Greg Hopkins, who leads the league
with 78 receptions and is a leading candidate for the Ironman of the
Year award given to the league's top two-way player.</TE>

<HD>Assembly Takes Step Toward Drug Testing</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Responding to reports of widespread steroid use in baseball, a
California Assembly committee voted Wednesday to require professional
athletic teams to test their players for performance-enhancing drugs.</LD>
<LD>   "This is what happens when you don't police yourself," Assemblyman
Tony Strickland said before the Assembly Arts, Entertainment, Sports,
Tourism and Internet Media Committee approved the bill, 11-0.</LD>
<LD>   There has been heightened interest in drug testing of athletes
since former baseball MVPs Ken Caminiti and Jose Canseco admitted
using steroids and accused other players of doing it too.</LD>
<TE>   The vote sent the bill to the Appropriations Committee, the last
stop before the Assembly floor.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For the second time in six days, Busch Stadium in St. Louis was a
place of mourning as former teammates paid their respects to Darryl
Kile.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of players who have been grieving for Kile in ballparks
across the country got the chance to say goodbye together in an
hour-long memorial service attended by 5,000 fans Wednesday. Among
the speakers were retired pitcher Doug Drabek, Colorado Rockies'
pitcher Pete Harnisch and Cardinal teammates Dave Veres, Woody
Williams and Mike Matheny.</TE>
<TE>   "Baseball, more than people would like to think, is a family,"
Arizona Diamondback pitcher Curt Schilling said. "Unfortunately, the
only time you hear about a DK is when something tragic happens.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a fantastic human being, a great father, and our thoughts
and prayers are with his family."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh Pirate left-handed starter Dave Williams expects to
have season-ending shoulder surgery by mid-July. Williams said rest
and exercise haven't helped to heal a torn labrum in his left
shoulder.... The Diamondbacks have agreed to contract terms with
first-round draft pick Sergio Santos, a 6-foot-3, 200-pound shortstop
who batted .388 with eight home runs and was a standout at Santa Ana
Mater Dei High last season.... South Carolina's Drew Meyer, the 10th
overall pick, signed a contract with the Texas Rangers only four days
after his last college game.</TE>

<HD>Ronaldo Gives Brazil Big Tip</HD>
<DH>World Cup: He uses 'toe-poke' instead of booming shot to
score goal that beats Turkey, 1-0, in semifinal game.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAITAMA, Japan</DL>
<LD>With the weight of the World Cup no longer on his shoulders, Ronaldo
has been a free man in Asia, running unimpeded through the midfield,
around defenders, to appointments with bad barbers and great goals,
the last one carrying Brazil on Wednesday to its third consecutive
World Cup final.</LD>
<LD>   Four years removed from the overwhelming pressure that left him a
sick and nervous wreck in Paris, Ronaldo finally delivered on the
potential that had haunted him across France in 1998, producing a
goal that shocked everyone on the field at Saitama
Stadium--especially the opposing goalkeeper--and lifted Brazil to a
1-0 semifinal victory over Turkey.</LD>
<LD>   This time, the frazzled nerves belonged to Ronaldo's teammates as
they tentatively stepped onto the field for the second half, having
squandered numerous chances to put away Turkey in the first 45
minutes. Dominating the early play yet having nothing tangible to
show for it, Brazil had seemingly misplayed its way right into
Turkey's opportunistic hands.</LD>
<TE>   But then, just four minutes into the second half, Ronaldo turned
the game--and the Turkish defense--inside out.</TE>
<TE>   Taking a long feed down the left flank from midfielder Gilberto
Silva, Ronaldo looked up and, as has often been the case this
tournament, found himself surrounded by several defenders. Four of
them, this time. Quadruple-teamed.</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo put his head down and bulled past Alpay Ozalan and
straight toward a backpedaling Ergun Penbe. Two other Turkish
defenders, Fatih Akyel and Bulent Korkmaz, quickly closed in on
either side--forming a red-shirted diamond around the Brazilian
forward.</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo continued to churn forward, keeping the diamond-and-one
moving backward. As Turkey goalkeeper Rustu Recber readied for the
inevitable big leg-whip and blast, Ronaldo tricked him by poking the
ball with the tip of his boot--too quickly for Recber to react until
the ball had hooked inside the far goalpost.</TE>
<TE>   It was a startling goal, one that left four Turkish defenders
slack-jawed and on-site commentators struggling to adequately
describe it, although Ronaldo didn't seem to have much trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a toe-poke," he said, simply.</TE>
<TE>   And Brazil-Germany, the matchup for Sunday's final in Yokohama, is
just another soccer match.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an important goal," he added.</TE>
<TE>   How important?</TE>
<TE>   With it, Brazil becomes only the second country in World Cup
history to qualify for three consecutive World Cup finals. The first?
Germany, of course. Germany reached three straight finals from
1982-90, winning the championship in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   The goal also sets up a historic first World Cup meeting between
four-time winner Brazil and three-time winner Germany. Brazil ranks
first in all-time World Cup victories and winning percentage; Germany
is No. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Although both teams have been criticized as pale imitations of
their legendary predecessors, a final between Brazil and
Germany--after four weeks of inexplicable upsets and controversial
underdog-aiding referee decisions--will placate purists who cringed
at the thought of either South Korea or Turkey going through to
Yokohama.</TE>
<TE>   For Ronaldo, it means a second chance after his mysterious
breakdown hours before the 1998 final against France. Reports still
vary on what happened to Ronaldo that day--was it an epileptic
seizure or a nervous collapse that left him listless and ineffective
during Brazil's 3-0 defeat?</TE>
<TE>   "I am not thinking about the last final," Ronaldo said when asked
about it. "We are not thinking about it at all. I only wanted to play
in a different final and to do so, we had to win today's game.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, we are just going to play our football and go to the final
and try to win."</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo is a different player than the overwhelmed World Cup
rookie of 1998, which perhaps explains his recent break from
long-standing tradition--i.e., the sensible haircut--and the
introduction of the bizarre fuzz triangle that has been sculpted into
his scalp--a post-modern monk sort of look.</TE>
<TE>   Four years have passed since Ronaldo failed to win the Cup for
Brazil. Three were lost to injuries and knee surgeries, relegating
the 1996 and 1997 world player of the year to who-knows status at the
start of the 2002 tournament.</TE>
<TE>   But Ronaldo has been in surprisingly good form--his six goals lead
all scorers in this World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Brazil Coach Luiz Felipe Scolari is taking no chances with
his fragile star. Bothered by a sore thigh, an injury sustained in
the quarterfinal against England, Ronaldo played only 19 minutes
after his goal--nearly assisting on two others, only to watch
teammates fail to finish. In the 68th minute, Scolari removed Ronaldo
from the match, replacing him with Luizao.</TE>
<TE>   "Ronaldo was not worried [about his thigh]," Scolari said. "And I
was not worried about him because when I saw him with that strange
haircut, I knew it was a positive sign that he would be playing this
match."</TE>
<TE>   Turkey, appearing in its first World Cup semifinal, was outplayed
during the first half but came close to equalizing several times in
the waning minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Substitute Ilhan Mansiz sent Brazilian goalkeeper Marcos scurrying
to palm a 79th-minute strike barely over the crossbar.</TE>
<TE>   Two minutes later, Hakan Suker's twisting volley pressured Marcos
again into palming the ball just out of danger.</TE>
<TE>   "We came to the World Cup to take part in the festival and make an
impact," Turkey Coach Senol Gunes said. "I think we've achieved our
goal and I am proud of my players, who have done absolutely
superbly."</TE>
<TE>   This time, Turkey's players were the ones consumed by the demands
of the moment.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, we lacked experience," Gunes said, "but there are also the
effects of the tension back home in Turkey. They are expecting a lot
from us and this created pressure on my players. This led to mistakes
on the field."</TE>

<HD>Cal Is Hit With Bowl Ban</HD>
<DH>College football: School also put on five years' probation
for violations involving academics, improper benefits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROB FERNAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's football team was banned from bowl competition next
season and the university was placed on probation for five years
because of rules violations in the football program, the NCAA
announced Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Chancellor Robert M. Berdahl said the university will appeal the
ruling, which also includes a reduction of nine football scholarships
over the next five seasons.</LD>
<LD>   The violations stem from academic improprieties involving two Cal
football players who competed while ineligible in 1999, and from
improper benefits given to 34 players and four recruits for
incidental hotel expenses between 1997 and 2001. Three of the
recruits went on to play for the Golden Bears.</LD>
<TE>   Cal was considered a repeat offender by the NCAA because the
violations occurred within five years of another major infraction
involving the men's basketball team in 1997, subjecting the
university to more severe penalties.</TE>
<TE>   Berdahl called the penalties "unfairly punitive." The NCAA imposed
the sanctions in addition to penalties meted out last year by the
Pacific 10 Conference, which placed Cal on one-year probation and cut
four football scholarships over two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   All of the violations occurred while Tom Holmoe was football
coach. Holmoe resigned in November after a five-year record of 16-39,
including 1-10 last season.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Tedford, former offensive coordinator at Oregon, said he was
made aware of Cal's problems before being hired as coach in December.
Athletic Director Steve Gladstone was hired last June.</TE>
<TE>   "I expected we would receive some additional penalty from the
NCAA, although it is unfortunate that a new administration and
coaching staff must bear the burden," Tedford said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Former Cal football players Ronnie Davenport and Mike Ainsworth
received credit for an ethnic studies class they had not taken in the
spring of 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Cal must forfeit all 11 games during the 1999 season in which the
two receivers played. Davenport and Ainsworth, a former Monrovia High
standout, flunked out of Cal after the 1999 fall semester.</TE>
<TE>   The NCAA found that a lack of institutional control occurred at
Cal because it failed to adequately investigate allegations of
academic fraud after repeated indications that the violations had
occurred.</TE>
<TE>   In January, the Pac-10 reported additional possible violations at
Cal pertaining to the improper payment of hotel incidental expenses
incurred by players and recruits. Of the 38 players and recruits
involved, 27 competed while ineligible.</TE>
<TE>   Because of -conference-imposed restrictions, Cal played last
season with 81 scholarship players. The NCAA ruling, if upheld, means
Cal would lose two scholarships in each of the next four seasons and
one in 2006 before returning to the NCAA limit of 85 in 2007.</TE>

<HD>Clippers at Least Land One Guard</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Trade for Miller doesn't happen, but 2000
draftee Jaric set to sign four-year contract.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Clippers' attempts to pry point guard Andre Miller from the
Cleveland Cavaliers failed during Wednesday's NBA draft, but that
doesn't mean a trade won't be worked out as soon as today.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, the Clippers said they have all but completed a deal to
sign Marko Jaric, a 6-foot-7 point guard from Serbia they drafted
30th overall in 2000. An announcement on a four-season contract is
expected to be made in the next day or so. Jaric has been playing for
a club team in Italy, averaging 15.2 points, 4.9 rebounds and 2.6
assists last season.</LD>
<LD>   Certainly, the Clippers prompted a good deal of head-scratching
Wednesday by drafting two power forwards with the eighth and 12th
picks when they already have an all-star at that position in Elton
Brand.</LD>
<TE>   Or as Charles Barkley told a national cable television audience
after the Clippers selected Chris Wilcox from Maryland with the
eighth pick, "They either took that pick for someone else or they're
stupid."</TE>
<TE>   Moments later, the Clippers took another power forward, Melvin Ely
from Fresno State. The Clippers used their second-round pick (41st
overall) to select Mario Kasun, a 7-1 center from Croatia whose
rights were traded to Orlando.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers covet a seasoned point guard to replace Jeff McInnis,
who is eligible to become an unrestricted free agent next week and
probably won't be re-signed. They're loaded with talent along the
front line, with Brand, center Michael Olowokandi and small forward
Lamar Odom. They also have Corey Maggette, a small forward, and
Darius Miles (power forward) filling key reserve roles.</TE>
<TE>   It's possible the Clippers could find another trading partner in
the coming days and weeks. The Clippers also spoke Wednesday to the
New Orleans Hornets about dealing for Baron Davis. But the Clippers
did not wish to give up both first-round picks and Odom for Davis, a
former UCLA standout.</TE>
<TE>   "The question came up regarding the guard position," Clipper
General Manager Elgin Baylor said when asked about selecting Wilcox
and Ely. "We're in the process of signing Marko Jaric, who is
considered the best point guard in Europe. We also have Keyon
Dooling. So, we'll have a lot of people at every position."</TE>
<TE>   Only five can play at one time, however.</TE>
<TE>   "We talked to them and it just didn't work out," Baylor said of
attempting to trade for Cleveland's Miller, who averaged a
league-leading 10.9 assists and 16.5 points last season. "We tried to
talk and we just couldn't come to an agreement about which players
would be involved."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if the deal was dead, Baylor said, "That I don't know. There
will be more talks I'm sure and we're going to keep the lines [of
communication] open."</TE>
<TE>   For the moment, Wilcox and Ely can hang onto the Clipper caps they
donned when their names were announced at Madison Square Garden in
New York.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a surprise," Wilcox acknowledged when asked about being
selected by the Clippers. "I never thought I would be out in L.A.,
but I'm happy I have a chance to go out to L.A. and, hopefully, I can
make the best of that situation. Hopefully, I'll get some playing
time, but if not, I'll have to work my way into the rotation."</TE>
<TE>   Ely also wasn't expecting to be selected by the Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   "When they picked me, I thought somebody was playing with me," he
said. "I went to Fresno State and traveled to L.A. a lot. I'm so
happy I can stay on the West Coast. It's been good to me."</TE>
<TE>   Of the logjam at power forward, Ely said, "I'm the type of player
that is going to go out and give whatever team I'm with 110%. I know
Quentin Richardson. I played high school ball with him. I played with
Corey Maggette and also with Lamar Odom and Elton Brand. I know all
those guys and I hope they'll help me with this transition.</TE>
<TE>   "If I am traded, I'll give any team I'm with my all."</TE>
<TE>   Wilcox and Ely are each listed at 6-10 and, under different
circumstances, would be considered excellent picks.</TE>
<TE>   As a sophomore, Wilcox helped Maryland to the NCAA championship
last season, averaging 12 points, 7.1 rebounds and 1.6 blocked shots.
Ely, 24, was named Western Athletic Conference player of the year in
his junior and senior seasons. He averaged a conference-leading 23.3
points in 2001-02.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to be good," Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry said. "It
would be great to have a great point guard, but everything is not
over. I still think there is a possibility [of a trade]. We have to
wait and see what happens.... I still think we're going to explore
all avenues to make our team better. We're not going to shut it down.
We have a lot of assets and we have flexibility."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers tendered qualifying offers for 2002-03 to Olowokandi
and backup forward Tremaine Fowlkes.... The team said it has sold
1,500 new season-ticket packages. The Clippers had 12,500
season-ticket holders last season.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Never Wrestle With a Pig"</LD>
<LD>   Author: Mark H. McCormack</LD>
<TE>   Publisher: Penguin Books</TE>
<TE>   Price: $14</TE>
<TE>   Although the author is in the sports and celebrity management
business, this 286-page paperback self-help book applies to those in
about any business. It's filled with tips and ideas for building a
business and a career.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the first thing that needs to be explained is the title. On
page 62 is this tip: "Never wrestle with a pig. You get dirty and
only the pig enjoys it." Translation: Don't waste time arguing with
people who love to argue for the sake of argument.</TE>
<TE>   The author, Mark McCormack, is the founder and chief executive of
International Management Group, a sports and celebrity management
organization with a client list that includes Tiger Woods, Arnold
Palmer, Venus and Serena Williams, Derek Jeter and Bob Costas.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen years ago McCormack wrote his first book, "What They Don't
Teach You at Harvard Business School." It reached No. 1 on the New
York Times bestseller list. This is McCormack's 12th book. It was
previously published under the title "Staying Street Smart in the
Internet Age."</TE>
<TE>   If there is an underlying theme, it is the need for people skills
and relationships in a society dominated by the Internet and cell
phones. Technical skills are important, but so are people skills.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point, people may be so reliant on technology, they won't
even feel the need for human contact," McCormack writes. "After all,
if you can get your message across via e-mail, who needs face-to-face
contact?"</TE>

<HD>Agent: Ahn Won't Go to Perugia</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ahn Jung-Hwan will not go back to Italian league club Perugia, which
had threatened to fire the South Korean forward for scoring the
extra-time golden goal that eliminated Italy from the World Cup, his
agent said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Ahn's rebuttal came after the Italian club reversed its position
and said it exercised the option to buy Ahn's contract from South
Korean K-League club, Busan I.cons.</LD>
<LD>   "Ahn has flatly denied Perugia's offer to fully join them," Ahn's
management group, ePlayers, said in a statement. "He said he will no
longer discuss his transfer to Perugia, which attacked his character
instead of congratulating him for his goal in the World Cup."</LD>
<TE>   Reached by telephone in Italy, Perugia spokesman Paolo Giovagnoni
said the club had not heard from Ahn.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't believe this news," he said. "There is a contract signed
by three parties--Perugia, Busan, and Ahn--that takes effect June 30,
2002. We'll wait to hear directly from Ahn, who I hope is now
enjoying some vacation."</TE>
<TE>   Ahn has been with Perugia since the start of the 2000-2001 season,
spending most of his time on the bench.</TE>
<TE>   His header in overtime lifted South Korea to a stunning 2-1
victory over Italy in the round of 16.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pierluigi Collina, the Italian referee known for his bald head
almost as much as his consistent officiating, will be chosen to
oversee the World Cup final, an Italian sports newspaper reported.</TE>
<TE>   While FIFA will not make its official selection until today, La
Gazzetta dello Sport wrote that "there are no more doubts" as to
which referee the organization that oversees international soccer
will choose."</TE>
<TE>   Collina--who speaks Italian, Spanish, French and English--has been
mentioned in connection with Sunday's final between Germany and
Brazil since early April, when FIFA Secretary General Michel
Zen-Ruffinen, a former referee, said he would be the ideal candidate
for the match.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Glasgow Rangers striker Claudio Caniggia has been given a $1,000
fine and a two-match ban for his World Cup red card, according to the
club's Web site.</TE>
<TE>   The ban means the 35-year-old Caniggia, who missed Argentina's
first two Group F games because of injury, will miss the first two
games of Argentina's Copa America campaign, should he continue his
international career.</TE>

<HD>Nomo Pulls Double Duty</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: He wins sixth consecutive decision and drives in a
run in 5-3 win over the Rockies. Green hits 24th homer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dodger right-hander Hideo Nomo did not sink to the depths right
fielder Shawn Green submerged to in early May--what's the pitching
equivalent of not hitting a ball out of the infield for five straight
games?--and Nomo's rebound wasn't nearly as dramatic as that of
Green, baseball's hottest hitter for the last month.</LD>
<LD>   But the two Dodgers have been on a parallel course this season.
There was speculation Nomo would be demoted to the bullpen after four
rocky starts, resulting in three losses and a no-decision from April
25-May 12, and Green was benched for a day when his average sank to
.230 on May 17.</LD>
<LD>   Green then went on his tear, Nomo went on his hot streak, and
Wednesday night their paths crossed, with Nomo providing seven strong
innings and Green hitting a two-run home run to lead the Dodgers to a
5-3 victory over the Colorado Rockies before 25,083 in Dodger
Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   Nomo gave up two runs and two hits, solo home runs by Todd Zeile
and Greg Norton in the fifth inning, struck out eight and walked two
to improve to 8-5 and lower his earned-run average to 3.55. He is 6-0
with a 3.20 ERA in his last eight starts and hasn't lost a decision
since May 12.</TE>
<TE>   Green followed Paul Lo Duca's leadoff single in the fourth with a
towering drive over the wall in center field for his 24th home run of
the season, which ranks third in the National League. It is his 21st
homer in his last 33 games.</TE>
<TE>   Since May 21, Green is batting .358 (43 for 120) with 21 home runs
and 40 runs batted in, and he leads the major leagues with 26 runs
and 11 homers this month.</TE>
<TE>   Closer Eric Gagne had his 12-inning scoreless streak ended when he
gave up his first run since May 29, a span of 11 appearances, but he
struck out Norton with a runner on third to end the game and record
his major league-leading 28th save.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo, who was hitless in 23 at-bats this season, also broke a 2-2
tie with an RBI double in the fifth, but it was his command on the
mound that most impressed Dodger Manager Jim Tracy.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo, who was perfect through four innings before giving up the
homers in the fifth, ranks second in the league with 57 walks, one
behind teammate Kazuhisa Ishii, but he worked ahead in the count for
most of Wednesday night's game, and he induced many weak swings with
his split-fingered fastball.</TE>
<TE>   "The pitches he threw early in the count for strikes completely
took the sting out of their bats, and that's what makes him so
effective," Tracy said. "He gave up two home runs, but they were
solo. There was no more damage set up by walking someone before
them."</TE>
<TE>   Green did his damage in the fourth, giving the Dodgers a 2-0 lead
and continuing a five-week surge that has shown no signs of ending.
Green's 11-game hit streak ended Tuesday night, but there he was
Wednesday night, tossing another pair of batting gloves into the
crowd after his home run.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw him get hot last year, and when this guy is mechanically
sound, there's not a whole lot you can do with him," Tracy said. "You
take your chances--it's very similar to the guy in San Francisco
[Barry Bonds], when he gets locked in. When the ball looks as big out
of the pitcher's hand as it does to Shawn Green right now, he's as
dangerous as anyone in baseball."</TE>
<TE>   Almost as stunning as Green's run is the fact that opponents
continue to pitch to him. Brian Jordan and, most recently, Eric
Karros, have followed Green in the order, but Green has walked only
20 times in the last 33 games.</TE>
<TE>   "That's their decision to make," Tracy said of opposing managers.
"I get to make that decision in 19 games when Barry Bonds comes to
bat. Karros has had some huge at-bats for this team. In my mind, if
you want to take a pass at Green for a while, Karros will give you a
heck of an at-bat. He's done it several times this year."</TE>
<TE>   Green, who hit .297 with 49 homers and 125 RBIs last season, had
three home runs and 21 RBIs on May 17, a sluggish start that put him
on pace for 11 homers and 81 RBIs. Now, Green is batting .286 and is
on pace for 50 homers and 128 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just enjoying the ride," Green said. "I don't expect it to
last."</TE>

<HD>Cora Is Given Start at Second Base</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The question has been asked of Manager Jim Tracy almost every day for
the last week: Why isn't reserve infielder Alex Cora, a rangy
defensive player who was batting .319 before Wednesday night's game,
playing more second base in place of struggling starter Mark
Grudzielanek?</LD>
<LD>   Cora did start against the Rockies on Wednesday night, but Tracy
insisted that Grudzielanek would play tonight against Colorado and
this weekend against the Angels, and that he wasn't moving toward a
time share at second base with Cora, who bats left-handed, and
Grudzielanek, who bats right-handed. Cora went 0 for 3 to drop his
average to .307.</LD>
<LD>   But Grudzielanek, who is batting .238 with four homers and 24 runs
batted in, and is five for 33 with one RBI in his last 10 games,
knows that unless he snaps out of his funk soon, he will be in a
platoon.</LD>
<TE>   "Of course I wouldn't be happy about that; I like being in there
every day, and that fits my attitude," said Grudzielanek, who has a
.278 on-base percentage, 46 strikeouts and 11 walks in 248 at-bats.
"But I'm not hitting very well.</TE>
<TE>   "The last thing I want to do is hurt the team, but if it gets to
that point, then absolutely, no question [Tracy has to make a move].
I hope it doesn't get to that point. If it does, then I'll probably
look for employment elsewhere, or they wouldn't want me around. But I
think we're far away from that point now."</TE>
<TE>   Grudzielanek has been slowed by hamstring and lower-back injuries,
and he's had fluid-filled bumps on the back of his right hand drained
several times. But he believes his problems can be traced to one
missing element.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not seeing the ball well out of the pitcher's hand, and when
that happens, you tense up and lunge forward too early," Grudzielanek
said. "I haven't had a run all year where I've felt good several days
in a row. It's to the point now where it has to get better."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy, as he did with Shawn Green when the right fielder struggled
for the first six weeks, has stuck with Grudzielanek. Tracy was the
bench coach in Montreal when Grudzielanek hit .306 in 1996, and he
was the bench coach in Los Angeles when Grudzielanek hit .326 for the
Dodgers in 1999 and .279 in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There are 35 shopping days until the July 31 trade deadline, and
there could be some big-ticket items such as Scott Rolen, Carlos
Delgado and Cliff Floyd in store windows, but Dodger General Manager
Dan Evans doesn't seem ready to break out the credit cards.</TE>
<TE>   "The key thing for our staff is to remain focused on the big
picture, what we're trying to accomplish in years to come, and not
just 2002," Evans said. "I think clubs put themselves in a bad
situation when they mortgage the future trying to win one or two
extra games."</TE>
<TE>   It's easy for Evans to say that now--the Dodgers don't have the
kind of minor league prospects other teams covet, and that will tie
his hands in trade talks.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers would like to add some pop to the bench and bolster
their bullpen, though the potential return of Darren Dreifort could
help the pitching staff. They have no interest in Cub reliever
Antonio Alfonseca, who is available, and little interest in Rolen,
the Philadelphia third baseman who will most likely be traded.</TE>
<TE>   It's doubtful Evans will be able to extend the Dodgers'
$102-million payroll much, so players such as Delgado, the Toronto
first baseman, and Floyd, the Florida outfielder, are not good fits.</TE>
<TE>   "We're playing well, but we're not going to do anything to
jeopardize our goal of winning games and having flexibility in the
future," Evans said. "This has got to be a long-term look for this
club."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The starting time for the Dodgers' game against the Houston Astros
on Sept. 8 has been moved to 4:10 p.m. so it won't conflict with the
city's annual triathlon. Part of the triathlon course goes near
Dodger Stadium.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>YOKOHAMA, Japan</DL>
<LD>Conspiracy has been an oft-used word at this World Cup, but now comes
a match with some truly intriguing plots and subplots.</LD>
<LD>   Brazil versus Germany for all the marbles--the brightly colored
ones that have characterized the South Americans' sparkling play and
the opaque ones that have kept the true depths of the Europeans'
hidden.</LD>
<LD>   Astonishing as it might seem, Brazilians and Germans have never
lined up opposite each other on a World Cup field. They have played
170 matches in the quadrennial world championship, but never against
each other.</LD>
<TE>   Making that even more remarkable, either Brazil or Germany has
reached every final but one since World War II, but still they have
never met.</TE>
<TE>   (For those keeping score, the exception was 1978, when Argentina
defeated the Netherlands in the final in Buenos Aires.)</TE>
<TE>   The Brazilians have samba'd their way through Korea/Japan '02,
even though the Turks once again made for an uneasy dance partner
Wednesday night in Saitama, Japan, before Coach Luiz Felipe Scolari's
team finally prevailed.</TE>
<TE>   The Germans, in contrast, have barged into the championship game,
with Coach Rudi Voeller making the most of what is essentially a
physically powerful but limited side without the quality of past
German teams.</TE>
<TE>   Resolute, obdurate, dull, plodding and stolid are all descriptions
that have been applied to the men in black and white.</TE>
<TE>   The headline in the Times of London (admittedly not the most
impartial observer) after Germany had ousted South Korea, 1-0, in
Seoul on Tuesday night was a typical reaction: "Voeller's Ruthless
Army Marches On."</TE>
<TE>   Brazil won its semifinal by the same score over Turkey, but the
same newspaper reserved nothing but kind words for the men in yellow
and blue.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it's the music and the bikini-clad women who accompany the
Brazilian team wherever it goes that warps the journalists' outlook.</TE>
<TE>   But look at the records. There really isn't much to choose between
the teams as far as bare statistics go.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil comes into Sunday's final unbeaten at 6-0, having scored 15
goals and giving up only four. Germany comes in unbeaten at 5-0-1,
having scored 14 goals and giving up only one.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, the Germans banged eight past the hapless Saudis, but the
Brazilians hammered five past the not-quite-as-hapless Costa Ricans.</TE>
<TE>   Voeller's men were taken to the wall by Ireland in their only tie,
but Scolari's team has twice been stretched to defeat Turkey. Both
teams have an unfinished look. Germany lacks the sort of midfield
that can open up a game, Brazil lacks the sort of defense that can
close it down.</TE>
<TE>   And so the questions begin to pile up ahead of the final:</TE>
<TE>   * Can Germany's Oliver Kahn justify his standing as the
tournament's top goalkeeper by foiling not only the "Triple-R" line
of Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho, but also the likes of Roberto
Carlos, Cafu and Denilson?</TE>
<TE>   * Can Brazil's defense cope with the high balls that are going to
be floated into the penalty area for Marco Bode, Miroslav Klose,
Oliver Bierhoff and Carsten Jancker to redirect past goalkeeper
Marcos?</TE>
<TE>   * With reliable playmaker Michael Ballack suspended, who is
Voeller going to start in his place? Voeller on Wednesday called
Ballack (three goals, four assists) irreplaceable, but will have to
choose between untested Lars Ricken and defense-minded Jens Jeremies.</TE>
<TE>   Chances are it will be the latter, as Germany tries to contain
Brazil's high-octane attack and hope for a goal on the break or for
the final to go to penalty kicks. The Germans have prided themselves
on shutting down World Cup opponents.</TE>
<TE>   "We gave up one goal in six games," midfielder Dietmar Hamann
said. "That says everything."</TE>
<TE>   Ballack said Germany, which had to beat Ukraine in a playoff just
to qualify for the World Cup, is stronger now than it was a month
ago.</TE>
<TE>   "The team has gathered so much self-confidence that nothing can
throw it off balance now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The team has managed to accomplish an incredible feat. In the
world, very few people would have placed much money on us going
through to the final, and so it's satisfying for us to prove them
wrong."</TE>
<TE>   As columnist Simon Barnes pointed out Wednesday in the Times of
London, however, the Brazilians' self-belief is immense.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect a lot from Brazil and tend to chuck logic out the
window when we read the name, read the surname-free players, see them
run out in canary yellow shirts," Barnes wrote. "But it's not just
us. Brazilian players do it as well.</TE>
<TE>   "Brazil [is] at the World Cup, so every player thinks, 'Ah, yes,
this is the competition we win. We win because our footballing
culture is better than anyone else's. I am Brazilian, I play for
Brazil, therefore I must be one of the best footballers that ever
drew breath.' "</TE>
<TE>   It's a sentiment that is reinforced almost every time Brazil takes
the field. It has been reinforced at this tournament, even though
this was where the Brazilians were supposed to fail.</TE>
<TE>   They were awful in South American qualifying, losing six of their
18 games and flirting with not making it to Korea/Japan '02 at all.</TE>
<TE>   But here they are, in the final, and in fine spirits too.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very good," midfielder Juninho Paulista said of player
morale earlier this week. "We're joking a lot. Keeping a good
atmosphere is important."</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo said the team is as loose as can be.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no pressure on us," he said. "When we're on the field, we
forget our problems."</TE>
<TE>   One interesting sidelight to Sunday's game is the three-way battle
for the so-called "Golden Boot" that is awarded to the tournament's
leading goal scorer.</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo leads with six goals after notching another against the
Turks on Wednesday, but teammate Rivaldo is right behind with five.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no fight between us," Ronaldo said. "Who is going to
come out on top is not important. It is more important that Brazil
wins the World Cup."</TE>
<TE>   Also in the running is Germany's Klose, also with five, but Klose
sustained a rib injury against South Korea that makes his status day
to day.</TE>
<TE>   What will happen Sunday? It's best to recall something German
defender Cristoph Metzelder said a few days ago:</TE>
<TE>   "Anything is possible in 90 minutes."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

Chance Encounter
Brazil has competed in all 17 World Cups, Germany in 15. Between
them, they have won seven championships, and only once since World
War II has a World Cup title game been contested without one of them
involved. Yet, Sunday will be their first meeting in World Cup play.
Some of the near misses:
SWEDEN 1958
West Germany blew a one-goal lead against the host nation and lost,
3-1, in the semifinals. Brazil won its semifinal and went on to
defeat Sweden, 5-2, for its first world championship
MEXICO 1970
Brazil again reached the final, but West Germany fell to Italy in the
semifinals, 4-3, in overtime after a 1-1 tie in regulation, one of
the wildest finishes in Cup history
WEST GERMANY 1974
Brazil failed to reach the final, losing in the final game of
semifinal group play to the Netherlands, 2-0. The Dutch lost to West
Germany, 2-1, in the championship game
ARGENTINA 1978
It wasn't easy for the two powers to avoid each other. Each finished
second in its first-round group; had either finished first, they
would have met in a semifinal group game
MEXICO 1986
Both teams went to penalty kicks in their quarterfinal games. West
Germany defeated Mexico, 4-1, but Brazil fell to France, 4-3. West
Germany then defeated France, 2-0, in the semifinals</TE>

<HD>Maybe This Major Title Isn't Their Cup of Tea</HD>

<LD>What is it about winning the British Open that brings out the worst
in a player? All right, not exactly the worst, but mediocre is
certainly appropriate, at least in the last several years.</LD>
<LD>   The record shows that since John Daly won at St. Andrews in 1995,
the British Open champion has followed one of three paths, all of
them bad--not winning again, not winning another major, or slumping
miserably after his victory.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, there is an exception named Tiger Woods, who won the
2000 Open at St. Andrews and just about everything else since then.</LD>
<TE>   Maybe there's nothing to this British Open slide trend, but it's
worth looking at. It is a strange legacy for the Open that runs
totally against the norm.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the case of Mark O'Meara, who won at Royal Birkdale in
1998 and in the three years since, in 73 tournaments, has only six
top-10 finishes and no victories. O'Meara, ranked fourth after
Birkdale, is 122nd now.</TE>
<TE>   Daly's descent into the ordinary has been puzzling, although he
has shown some signs of coming back lately and is No. 45 in the World
Ranking. But since he won at St. Andrews, Daly has played 159 PGA
Tour tournaments without a victory and with only 11 top-10s.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, Tom Lehman won his only major, at Royal Lytham, and has
one victory in the last six years--two years ago at the Phoenix Open.
Lehman was seventh after Lytham, 32nd now.</TE>
<TE>   He was 25 when he broke through with a major title at Royal Troon
in 1997, but Justin Leonard hasn't won another big one in five years.
In fairness, Leonard has been the most successful of recent British
Open champions--again, Woods being the exception. He has four
victories, including the 1998 Players Championship and the WorldCom
Classic in April. He made the big putt at the 1999 Ryder Cup. But
there has been a lot more expected of Leonard in the majors and he
hasn't been able to close the deal, although he did make a playoff at
Carnoustie.</TE>
<TE>   Ah, yes, Carnoustie. In the 1999 British Open at Carnoustie, Paul
Lawrie's victory was a fluke, thanks to Jean Van de Velde's
spectacular flameout. Lawrie did win a tournament on the European
Tour last year, but that's it in the last three years and he has seen
his ranking drop to No. 86. Except for a tie for 11th at the British
Masters, Lawrie's best result this year is a tie for 24th.</TE>
<TE>   Woods won by eight shots at St. Andrews two years ago and 11 times
since then, including four majors, so the British Open thing hasn't
affected him at all.</TE>
<TE>   But that's not the case for the reigning British Open champion.
David Duval is working on a 21-tournament winless streak and has
missed five cuts in his last seven events, including the Masters and
the U.S. Open.</TE>
<TE>   Now, if Woods completes the third leg of his Tour de Slam next
month at Muirfield, we'll see if he is still immune to the British
Open bug.</TE>
<TE>   Ticket News</TE>
<TE>   The last one ended only 11 days ago, but the U.S. Open is still in
the news for two reasons. One, the U.S. Golf Assn. raked in an
estimated $100 million for the 102nd Open at Bethpage Black. And,
two, the USGA is introducing a computerized random drawing plan for
tickets to the 2003 U.S. Open at Olympia Fields in Illinois, for
anyone who is a dues-paying USGA member.</TE>
<TE>   And while we're on the subject of tickets, if you're thinking
about buying some for the PGA Championship in August, you're too
late. Tickets for the week, at Hazeltine National Golf Club in
Chaska, Minn., are gone.</TE>
<TE>   According to the general chairman for the event, Minnesotans
bought 85% of the tickets. On sale next week: pay-per-view telecast
of lame duck Gov. Jesse Ventura ice-fishing.</TE>
<TE>   Notahble Finish</TE>
<TE>   Notah Begay won twice in 1999 and twice again in 2000, but has
made five cuts in the last two years because of disk tears. Last week
at Hartford, Begay tied for 33rd--the first time he has made the cut
in 12 tournaments this year.</TE>
<TE>   Begay, who shot three rounds in the 60s at Hartford, said he is
able to sleep through the night without pain and he's playing at
Memphis this week.</TE>
<TE>   Said Begay: "I'm not sure if I'm back."</TE>
<TE>   Money News</TE>
<TE>   According to BusinessWeek, Greg Norman's standard appearance fee
for a corporate outing is $300,000, only slightly more expensive than
Phil Mickelson, Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson, whose fees are each
$250,000.</TE>
<TE>   Woods' fees for corporate outings are built into his contracts
with his corporate partners and he is not available for others.</TE>
<TE>   Business News</TE>
<TE>   Even though his victory came, oh, a week too late, and at Hartford
instead of Bethpage Black, Mickelson carried the banner well for
Titleist, his primary sponsor. Mickelson won with a Titleist driver,
irons, wedges, putter and ball. He used a TaylorMade three-wood.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Mark Brooks, who was featured in ads for Nike, is going
back to Ben Hogan products, produced by Spalding. Brooks, the 1996
PGA Championship winner, is having one of his worst years--10 missed
cuts in 17 events and a best finish of 22nd.</TE>
<TE>   Timing II</TE>
<TE>   News item: Sergio Garcia wins a skins game in Canada on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: He set his watch with Mickelson.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Factor</TE>
<TE>   It was borderline hilarious when Gary Player rapped Mickelson for
not showing more emotion about coming up short in a major--without
ever mentioning him by name, of course.</TE>
<TE>   Here's what Player said of a certain, unnamed player: "I have just
been amazed by one of the players who finishes close every time to
[Woods] and they do an interview with him every time afterward, and
they ask 'How are you feeling?' and he says, 'I'm happy with my
game.' Well, he hasn't won and he finishes second and third and he's
very happy. I got so ticked off, I wouldn't talk for two weeks."</TE>
<TE>   What you get with Mickelson is a classic defense mechanism,
putting a positive spin on not winning a major. Who can blame him?</TE>
<TE>   Nothing else has worked. It didn't work when he avoided the
subject of not winning a major, it didn't work when he tackled the
issue head on, and it didn't work when he got ticked off. At least
credit Mickelson with coming up with new stuff.</TE>
<TE>   There will come a day when Woods plays ordinarily, but Mickelson
plays great and he wins. That's what Mickelson has got to think,
anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Toto Knew</TE>
<TE>   News item: Players are spending as much as $1,000 a day to stay in
private housing at the U.S. Women's Open in Hutchinson, Kan.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: After they arrive, some will be willing to pay $2,000 a
day to get out of town.</TE>
<TE>   Fuzzy Thinking</TE>
<TE>   The quote of the week is from Fuzzy Zoeller, on his favorite
course: "Covered Bridge ... because I own it."</TE>
<TE>   Jack and Arnie</TE>
<TE>   With Nicklaus withdrawing from this week's U.S. Senior Open,
speculation is heating up that he might not play the Masters in 2003.
Let's hope he does. Nicklaus and his fans deserve a proper farewell,
the same kind of adios Arnold Palmer and his Army enjoyed in April.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of Palmer, he is hinting (again) that he's close to
hanging it up for good. Palmer, 72, is playing this week in the U.S.
Senior Open at Caves Valley Golf Club in Baltimore and there is a
chance that it's either going to be his last major of any kind or his
last tournament, period.</TE>

<HD>Fairplex Proposal Is Turned Down</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Board rejects moving 17-day meet to Santa
Anita by 4-1 vote but indicates it will revisit issue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LANCE PUGMIRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Horse Racing Board voted Wednesday to reject the
proposed move of the 17-day Los Angeles County Fair meet to Santa
Anita Park in Arcadia, meaning the 64th season of racing at Fairplex
Park in Pomona will begin Sept. 13.</LD>
<LD>   "This was just such a serious change to our racing calendar and it
will definitely impact the Del Mar and Oak Tree meets," board member
Roger Licht said. "I just thought it needed additional study before
we tampered by approving a move."</LD>
<LD>   Licht, Marie Moretti, John Harris and John Sperry voted to reject
the move by a 4-1 count, with chairman Alan Landsburg voting against
the rejection. Sheryl Granzella abstained. William Bianco was absent.</LD>
<TE>   At the June 6 board meeting, when the proposal to move the fair
meet was first discussed, Moretti abstained from a vote to reject the
move. The 3-3-1 split preceded a motion to arrange Wednesday's
special meeting in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Licht said he would "seriously consider" the move for next year.
Moretti said she applauded the proposal for the fair meet to reinvent
itself.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a tough one; I've never received so many calls on an
issue as I have on this one," Moretti said during the meeting. "But I
think we should vote to reject for this year."</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Moretti explained, "This idea to move just came upon
everyone too fast. It seemed like every day a new letter was coming
in citing a new statute that needed to be addressed."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Fair Assn. President/Chief Executive James
Henwood said his decision to strike a five-year lease arrangement
with Santa Anita President Jack Liebau was precipitated by industry
hints that the Fairplex dates were too valuable to be expensed on an
old, tight-turned five-eighths-mile dirt track.</TE>
<TE>   Liebau argued that moving the fair dates to Santa Anita would
result in increased handle, higher purses due to the presence of a
one-mile track and turf course and greater distribution to satellite
wagerers.</TE>
<TE>   Upon defeat, Henwood contended that the members of the industry
who declared Fairplex Park such an important component of the
Southern California circuit were now responsible for proving their
stances were not self-serving.</TE>
<TE>   Henwood wants year-round training at Fairplex reinstated--most of
April and July are now deemed off months after a 50% reduction ($1.5
million) in funding--and he also requested increased involvement in
the Barretts Equine Sales and industry support should he decide to
install a one-mile track and turf course.</TE>
<TE>   "The industry needs to be accountable about our challenges,"
Henwood said.</TE>
<TE>   Henwood is expected to resume talk of a move to Santa Anita at the
board's 2003 racing dates committee meeting July 26 at Del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   Racing boards and executives from Hollywood Park, the Del Mar
Thoroughbred Club and Oak Tree Racing Assn., which operates its meet
at Santa Anita, opposed the move, along with the Thoroughbred Owners
of California and the California Thoroughbred Trainers.</TE>
<TE>   The overwhelming support to deny the move was evident at the
meeting, as attorneys, track executives and such veteran horsemen as
trainers Mel Stute and Jack Van Berg addressed the board.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't got rich there, but Fairplex is a tradition, and if
there's one thing horse racing needs, it's tradition," Stute said.</TE>
<TE>   Two-time Kentucky Derby-winning owner Bob Lewis argued, "We
recognize tradition is magnificent, but we have to move forward
within this industry, and a move like this would be advantageous."</TE>
<TE>   Craig Fravel, Del Mar's executive vice president, and Sherwood
Chillingworth, an Oak Tree vice president, whose respective meets
immediately precede and follow the fair, questioned the details of
the Henwood-Liebau lease. They also claimed approving the move would
invoke a law that would ban satellite wagering at Fairplex during a
fair season at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   A letter written by John Van de Kamp of the Thoroughbred Owners
advocating a reallocation of fair racing dates to Del Mar, Hollywood
Park and Santa Anita was also mentioned. Landsburg dismissed that
plan, but it is expected to be part of the debate next month.</TE>

<LD>A couple of streakers will get together in today's main event at
Hollywood Park.</LD>
<LD>   Bonus Pay Day and Alfurune, both of whom have won two in a row,
head a field of six in the seventh, a $55,000 allowance at 1 1/16
miles and the fifth leg of a pick six that has a $100,430 carryover.</LD>
<LD>   A California-bred gelding, Bonus Pay Day has blossomed since being
claimed for $32,000 by trainer Pete Eurton for the partnership of
Frank and Sharon Alesia, Mike Mellen's Bran Jam Stable and Joe
Ciaglia.</LD>
<TE>   After finishing fourth in a blanket finish on the Santa Anita turf
in his first race for Eurton, Bonus Pay Day won by three lengths as
the 2-1 favorite in his first Hollywood Park start May 4. A little
more than three weeks later, he was even more dominant, winning by 4
1/2 lengths at 11-10.</TE>
<TE>   The removal of blinkers has obviously made a difference and the
son of Bonus Money has trained well since scratching from the
Californian earlier in the month. He again will be ridden by
apprentice Kevin Krigger.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Savario Farm and trained by Craig Dollase, Alfurune won
two sprints at Hollywood Park in April and May and now has to prove
that he can win around two turns. The gelding is winless in five
previous races beyond seven furlongs. Both of his recent victories
have come with Laffit Pincay, who remains his jockey.</TE>
<TE>   Completing the field are Kela, Brazilian import Nikolayev,
Trompolino and Wallahatchie.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The sixth is a contentious sprint for 3-year-olds
racing for a $40,000 claiming price. There are few, if any, throwouts
in the field of nine.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Patrick Valenzuela. The jockey won three races
Wednesday at Hollywood Park and has a 55-39 lead over Pincay in the
standings.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Phil Hauswald. The trainer is three for 51 this year
and is 0 for 21 at Belmont Park.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three singling Distinctive Tale in the
second, using Bonusita and Youmakemethorbaby in the third and Bronx,
Insane Reality, Special Forces and Pikester in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/123. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $12.60/$711. Total money bet: $790.</TE>

<HD>Lakers Still Real Deal</HD>
<DH>Lakers: Three-time champions stay flexible by swapping with
Raptors. They acquire Rush and Murray for Hunter and draft pick
Jefferies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Lakers acquired the draft rights to Kareem Rush, a 6-foot-6 guard
from Missouri, and veteran shooter Tracy Murray on Wednesday night in
a deal that sent guard Lindsey Hunter and the rights to their own
draft pick to the Toronto Raptors.</LD>
<LD>   Through the draft-day trade, the Lakers hoped to broaden their
perimeter game (Murray), develop a big guard in the style of Ron
Harper while getting younger and quicker in their backcourt (Rush),
and also to gain the long-term financial pliancy to retain their own
key free agent (Devean George).</LD>
<LD>   Murray, who has played for five teams--the Raptors twice--can be a
free agent after next season. Hunter could have earned as much as
$8.1 million over the next two seasons, a potential hindrance
alongside a pending multiyear offer to George.</LD>
<TE>   "If anything, this allows us to more vigorously pursue Devean,"
Laker General Manager Mitch Kupchak said, "providing us some
flexibility down the road."</TE>
<TE>   On draft day last year, faced with pending foot surgery for Derek
Fisher, Kupchak worked most of the night trying to acquire Hunter,
completing the trade with the Milwaukee Bucks the following day. In
the days leading to this draft, Kupchak found the Raptors, who had
their own back-court issues. Guard Alvin Williams has undergone three
recent surgeries, according to Kupchak.</TE>
<TE>   With the 20th pick, the Raptors took Rush, who averaged 19.8
points and made 40.5% of his three-point attempts in his junior
season, his last with the Tigers. In their first-round spot at No.
27, the Lakers selected Fresno State forward Chris Jefferies, who was
packaged with Hunter.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter, who played well early for the Lakers when Fisher was
recovering from surgery and late in chasing guards Tony Parker and
Mike Bibby in the playoffs, was unavailable for comment. His father,
Lindsey Sr., reached in Jackson, Miss., said, "That's good. He wants
to play. He wants to contribute."</TE>
<TE>   Murray, a 6-foot-7 small forward who will turn 31 in July, is a
career 39.1% three-point shooter. He grew up in Glendora and attended
Glendora High and UCLA. Hindered by hip pain for about two years,
Murray had surgery April 3 to repair cartilage damage and shave bone
spurs on the right side. He said Wednesday night that he expected to
be healthy before the start of training camp.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a dream come true," Murray said. "My dream wasn't
accomplished until right now. Now, from here, let's go get No. 4."</TE>
<TE>   Rush averaged 18.9 points in three seasons at Missouri. Asked why
he made the deal, Kupchak smiled and said, "Kareem. Kareem's always
been good to us here. We've been very fortunate with Kareems. With
one Kareem, anyway."</TE>
<TE>   He called this Kareem "an incredible talent" with NBA size and a
dynamic game, particularly on offense. He scored at Missouri from the
perimeter and as a slasher to the rim.</TE>
<TE>   "We know he can score," Kupchak said. "That's probably the hardest
thing to find at this level.</TE>
<TE>   "We know when he puts his mind to it he can defend as well."</TE>
<TE>   Rush's younger brother, JaRon, once was a player with similar
potential at UCLA. He sat out much of his sophomore year, however,
because of allegations of past improprieties. Hounded by those and
personal problems, he made himself eligible for the 2000 draft but
wasn't drafted. He has since played in the satellite leagues.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers likely will bring Kareem Rush along slowly. Kobe Bryant
is their starter at shooting guard, and they expect to re-sign free
agent Brian Shaw. Also, Coach Phil Jackson has little use for
rookies, even talented ones.</TE>
<TE>   Though he'd seen little, if any, of Rush, Jackson said he
appreciated his size, and was willing to wait for Rush to develop.</TE>
<TE>   "The name itself conjures up something because of the association
here, with UCLA and basketball," Jackson said. "This young man, we
think we're making a move in an experimental way, to find out if he's
going to fit with this basketball club, and if he has the ability to
learn and to mature. There's no better ground than right here, with
this team, a group of veteran players....</TE>
<TE>   "We have enough networks out there in the college ranks to feel
assured that we got a player that's going to stay around the NBA and
play in the NBA and he's going to contribute."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers were not able to fill their need in the front court.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't get everything covered," Jackson said. "But we feel
really comfortable with the fact that we've improved what we went out
to improve, and that's team speed in the backcourt and our overall
team speed. We have some young players we think can develop in that
area.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously the one space we still have as a question mark is a
legitimate backup, seven-foot center to back up Shaquille [O'Neal].
That's been a problem we've had to face for a couple years."</TE>

<HD>No High Demand for Local Players</HD>
<DH>NBA: Jacobsen, Prince are drafted in the first round, with
Gadzuric, Barnes and Clancy going in the second.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Only two players with Southland connections were selected in the
first round of the NBA draft Wednesday, and neither played college
basketball in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   And although five others with roots in the region were selected in
the second round, a highly touted high school player wasn't drafted.</LD>
<LD>   Such was the lot of players from the region who were looking to
jump to the highest level in a draft heavily influenced by
undergraduates and foreigners.</LD>
<TE>   Casey Jacobsen, a junior guard from Stanford who played at
Glendora High, was selected by the Phoenix Suns with the No. 22 pick,
and Kentucky senior forward Tayshaun Prince, who played at Compton
Dominguez, was drafted by the Detroit Pistons one pick later.</TE>
<TE>   Only first-round picks receive guaranteed contracts.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA senior center Dan Gadzuric was the 34th pick overall, going
to the Milwaukee Bucks, and Bruin teammate Matt Barnes, a senior
forward, was picked by the Memphis Grizzlies with the 46th pick, then
his rights were traded to Cleveland. Neither Gadzuric nor Barnes
could be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Former Fresno State guard Tito Maddox, who played at Compton and
one season in college but had to sit out last season because of
improper contacts with an agent, went 38th to the Houston Rockets.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps falling most precipitously was USC senior forward Sam
Clancy, the Pacific 10 Conference player of the year and a
second-team All-American.</TE>
<TE>   Clancy, who dislocated his left knee in a workout with Phoenix on
May 13 and later underwent surgery, was unable to visit any other
team and fell victim to an out-of-sight-out-of-mind syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   The Philadelphia 76ers remembered him, though, and chose him at
No. 45, their only selection after trading away the rights to No. 16
pick Jiri Welsch.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-7 Clancy, who has been tabbed too small to play power
forward in the NBA, was overjoyed at the prospect of joining a team
one season removed from playing in the NBA Finals and helping Dikembe
Mutombo and Derrick Coleman down low.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew teams would [sleep] on me, so to speak," Clancy said from
his home in Cleveland. "But for [the 76ers] to take a chance on me
means a lot. I see myself fitting in nicely there and I just got off
the phone with Coach [Larry Brown] and he said he felt the same way."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Clancy, who tested the draft waters last year before
returning for his senior season, was perturbed that he had to wait so
long to hear his name called.</TE>
<TE>   In being the 45th pick, Clancy matched California's Sean Lampley,
selected by the Chicago Bulls last summer, as the second-lowest
Pac-10 player of the year drafted. Only USC's Wayne Carlander, who
went 99th overall to Sacramento in 1985, when the draft lasted seven
rounds, has gone lower.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, I saw some people go ahead of me that I would kill on an
average day," Clancy said. "But I'm just happy being drafted in the
NBA, especially being hurt. I have a teammate [USC senior forward
David Bluthenthal] who should have been drafted but wasn't, so I'm
just counting my blessings."</TE>
<TE>   The last player from the region drafted was California freshman
center Jamal Sampson, a former Santa Ana Mater Dei standout, who went
47th to the Utah Jazz before having his rights dealt to Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Inglewood senior DeAngelo Collins was not selected despite being
considered a borderline first-round selection in some draft circles.
The 6-foot-10, 230-pounder intrigued scouts with quickness and range,
but may have scared off teams with his history of transgressions.</TE>
<TE>   At 13, he assaulted a woman in Stockton, his hometown, and served
60 days in a juvenile detention center. As a freshman at Tustin, he
served six months in juvenile hall for assaulting a teammate.</TE>
<TE>   Collins, a third-team Parade All-American this season, averaged 23
points and 15 rebounds despite sitting out 12 games because of a knee
injury.</TE>

<HD>Lakers Still Real Deal</HD>
<DH>NBA draft: Clippers unable to pull off a trade for Miller
or Davis, and they wind up with more young forwards in Wilcox and Ely
... for now.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK HEISLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All you Clipper fans who were going out to LAX to welcome Andre
Miller, never mind.</LD>
<LD>   The NBA draft went off largely as expected Wednesday, starting
with the Houston Rockets' selection of 7-foot-5 Chinese center Yao
Ming ... with one notable exception:</LD>
<LD>   The widely reported trade between the Clippers and Cleveland
Cavaliers fell apart.</LD>
<TE>   Oh, and another deal the Clippers tried to put together for Baron
Davis foundered, sources say, when Clipper owner Donald T. Sterling
nixed it.</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposed deal with Cleveland, the Clippers would have
gotten the promising Miller for their No. 8 and 12 picks plus a
player, but they couldn't agree on the player.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers offered Corey Maggette, then made Lamar Odom
available late in the process.</TE>
<TE>   The Cavaliers demanded Darius Miles. The Clippers refused,
according to a source, on orders from Sterling.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, back at the draft, selections were going as
expected--Yao to the Rockets at No. 1, Duke's Jay Williams to the
Chicago Bulls at No. 2, Duke's Mike Dunleavy to the Golden State
Warriors at No. 3, Kansas' Drew Gooden to the Memphis Grizzlies at
No. 4, 6-11 Georgian wunderkind Nikoloz Tskitishvili to the Denver
Nuggets at No. 5--until the Cavaliers' choice at No. 6.</TE>
<TE>   With Miller, a free agent next summer, still on their roster, they
drafted another point guard, Memphis freshman Dajuan Wagner.</TE>
<TE>   Then, minutes later, Clipper sources say, the Cavaliers called
them back just as they were turning in their No. 8 pick--offering to
make the deal for Odom if the Clippers would draft Caron Butler for
them and give them No. 12.</TE>
<TE>   However, the Clippers had already phoned in their selection to
league officials in New York--Maryland power forward Chris
Wilcox--making it official.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers then spent a feverish 10 minutes, calling the Phoenix
Suns, who were drafting No. 9, and the Miami Heat, drafting No. 10,
trying to trade Wilcox for either pick so they could take Butler.</TE>
<TE>   The Suns had already turned in their pick, high school star Amare
Stoudemire.</TE>
<TE>   Heat Coach Pat Riley, who had said taking Butler would be a
"no-brainer" if he fell that far, then grabbed the Connecticut
standout.</TE>
<TE>   Just to round out their day, the Clippers also tried to get Davis,
but that didn't work, either. The New Orleans Hornets were willing to
do it for the two Clipper picks plus Odom, but the Clippers turned
them down ... on orders from Sterling, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   So, the Clippers wound up with Wilcox, one of the draft's
highest-rated power forwards, and Fresno State's 6-9 Melvin Ely at
No. 12, another promising young big man ... who doesn't figure to
play much, either, assuming he or Wilcox stays with the Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   This left a flummoxed Elgin Baylor, the Clippers' general manager,
to explain what he was now going to do with Wilcox, Ely, Odom, Miles
and Elton Brand at forward, not to mention swing men Corey Maggette
and Quentin Richardson.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had gone in any other direction, we'd have had a whole lot
of people at that position too," Baylor said.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers have plenty of big men, assuming they retain center
Michael Olowokandi, who is a year away from free agency. They have
the planet's biggest collection of forwards and shooting guards.</TE>
<TE>   However they're thin at point guard with last season's starter,
Jeff McInnis, not expected to be re-signed, leaving only Keyon
Dooling, who sat out most of last season because of an ankle injury,
5-6 Earl Boykins and soon-to-be signed European star Marko Jaric.</TE>
<TE>   Equally flummoxed Coach Alvin Gentry, asked to assess the point
guard situation, tried a diversionary maneuver:</TE>
<TE>   "Well," Gentry said, "we're going to be good. It would be great to
get a great point guard, but everything isn't over.... We'll find a
way to make that position work."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the Cavaliers were still calling the Clippers on Wednesday
night ... and Davis reportedly has told the Hornets he won't re-sign
... so stay tuned.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's notable winners include the Rockets, who wound up with
Yao and promising European forward, Bostjan Nachbar, whom they took
at No. 15.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulls got Williams, generally considered to be the best bet to
have an immediate impact.</TE>
<TE>   The Nuggets wound up with two of the most intriguing prospects in
the draft, Tskitishvili and 6-9, 250-pound Nene Hilario, and former
Knicks Marcus Camby and Mark Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Then there were the Knicks, who decided they couldn't wait for the
19-year-old Hilario to develop, and traded the pick (and Camby and
Jackson) for Antonio McDyess and a low first-round pick that turned
out to be Illinois point guard Frank Williams.</TE>

<HD>Giants Just Can't Shove This Issue Aside</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So, Barry Bonds and Jeff Kent exchanged dugout shoves in the most
public demonstration of their unusual relationship, and the thing
about it is that 20 or 21 of the other San Francisco Giants consider
both to be incorrigible and probably wouldn't have cared if they had
put each other out of commission--although it might have made
catching the Dodgers in the National League West a little tougher.</LD>
<LD>   It isn't that Bonds and Kent are totally isolated on their own
little islands in the Giant clubhouse, where Bonds' suite of corner
lockers at Pacific Bell Park comes with a luxury reclining chair and
the recent warning that reporters are no longer welcome.</LD>
<LD>   Kent, after all, probably has J.T. Snow on his side and Bonds is
believed to be supported by Reggie Sanders and maybe Shawon
Dunston--didn't Bonds give him a Mercedes-Benz last year as reward
for predicting he would hit 73 home runs?--but consider that their
teammates pretty much stood around and watched as the league's two
most recent most valuable players (pugilists?) went at each other in
the dugout at San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium Tuesday night.</LD>
<TE>   It took trainer Stan Conte and Manager Dusty Baker to serve as the
principal peacemakers, with Baker and Kent reportedly exchanging
words and Kent later saying it was no big deal because he and Bonds
have taken their version of "Family Feud" to similar levels about
half a dozen times and why should that translate to a dysfunctional
relationship?</TE>
<TE>   Besides, Baker told reporters after the Giants had lost to the
Padres, 10-7, "it happens in your job too. I've seen sportswriters
nearly come to blows in my office."</TE>
<TE>   Media hotheads are one thing. A potentially disruptive exchange
between star teammates is another.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants were busy sweeping up after Bonds and Kent on
Wednesday, saying the right things, but one wonders if the microscope
won't be a little more intrusive now, if the race in the West got a
little tougher for a team only four games over .500 since opening the
2002 season with six straight wins, including a three-game sweep in
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds, the Bay Area-born son of former Giant star Bobby Bonds and
godson of Giant Hall of Famer Willie Mays, and Kent, the blue-collar
Texas rancher, have kept their respectful distance, neither friends
nor particularly friendly, for five years. They have also managed to
keep those half-dozen other incidents out of the public eye. Now,
with the Giants 4 1/2 games behind the transformed Dodgers, their
relationship has been exposed as a potentially ticking time bomb and
one more hint of internal problems with the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   It was only a week ago, for instance, that Bonds, a target for
opposing pitchers, ripped his own pitchers for failing to protect
him, to which Giant pitchers have yet to respond, and it was only a
week ago that Baker took a shot at Kent, who bats behind Bonds, by
saying he wasn't surprised at how often Bonds was being walked, but
was surprised at how often the strategy was working.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant General Manager Ned Colletti cited the team's
inconsistency at the plate when he said Wednesday:</TE>
<TE>   "Our struggles have a lot more to do with [a lack of] offense than
any friction or personality conflicts. We deal with friction and
personality conflicts all the time. Even teammates can find it
difficult being neighbors when you play every day. I mean, a lot more
happens than people know about.</TE>
<TE>   "Will this be disruptive? I don't think it will be any more
disruptive than Kent's comments in Sports Illustrated last year. We
worked through that and we'll get through this. It's one of Dusty's
strengths."</TE>
<TE>   Colletti referred to Baker's people skills, which Larry Baer, the
Giants' chief operating officer, also acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   "I would never condone fighting, but if you look at baseball
history, it's the good teams, the high-performing teams, that tend to
have the most tension and conflicts," Baer said. "The reality is that
Barry and Jeff are passionate, emotional guys who care about winning.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a high degree of confidence that all of this can be
repaired. We still have high expectations for the year, and that's
where our focus is.... The Dodgers have played great, but there are
no awards given to teams on June 27."</TE>
<TE>   Nor will Bonds and Kent be honored for their Tuesday night
skirmish that, by all accounts, started when Kent jumped on third
baseman David Bell for a play he had made in the second inning. Bonds
defended Bell, Kent told Bonds what he could do, and Bonds put his
left hand on Kent's throat and shoved him against the dugout wall.</TE>
<TE>   Baker interceded, and Kent reportedly said, "I want off this
team," to which Baker is said to have told him, "Don't ever say that
again," and Kent reportedly replied, "It's his team anyway. Of
course, you'll take his side."</TE>
<TE>   By the end of a game in which Bonds and Kent each homered, with
each high-fiving the other, Baker was refusing to discuss specifics,
Bonds was maintaining his recently imposed media boycott and Kent was
talking only to Bay Area reporters, saying, "Just add that to the
half-dozen times we've done it before." Kent added that if there was
any dislike after five years, "I don't think we'd be playing
together. I think we do a lot of good things for this team that
benefit him and benefit me. I think if you guys try to create a
dysfunctional relationship, that's a farce too, because that's not
true."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, but this will definitely be the last year they play
together, and if the Giants could get comparable value for Kent, if
they could find a club willing to take on the rest of his $6-million
salary, he might be gone before the July 31 nonwaiver trade deadline
rather than when he becomes a free agent at the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   It is Bonds' team, and no matter what the hard-nosed Kent thinks
about the left fielder's poses after his long and frequent home runs,
his failure to run all out on some ground balls and base hits, the
elbow padding he's allowed to wear when batting, the time off he gets
when games become routs and the in-your-face schedule he's allowed to
keep, nothing will change that.</TE>
<TE>   It is Bonds' team, and sources said the Giants remain angry with
Kent for failing to tell the truth about the motorcycle accident in
which he was injured during the spring, disappointed at his lack of
production behind Bonds this year and concerned that he has allowed
his role as the National League's union representative to interfere
with his focus at the plate.</TE>
<TE>   "When Jeff won the MVP two years ago, he turned it into a
competition with Barry. He challenged himself," a club source said.
"Since then, Barry has blown him away, and it seems to have played on
his psyche. It's as if he's no longer up for the challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Well, Bonds and Kent challenged each other in the dugout Tuesday
night, and their teammates enjoyed standing and watching.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>WorldCom Inc.'s financial crisis may cost the PGA Tour and several
auto racing series a longtime sponsor, and may even force the MCI
Center in Washington to be renamed, sports marketers said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   If the No. 2 long-distance telephone company files for bankruptcy
protection after a disclosure that it hid more than $3.8 billion in
expenses and fabricated profits, the roughly $120 million a year
WorldCom commits to professional sports may dry up.</LD>
<LD>   CART and IRL are two of the entities that may suffer most from the
potential fallout. WorldCom spends about $5 million a year combined
as a sponsor of CART and the IRL.</LD>
<TE>   Spokespeople for CART and IRL didn't return telephone calls
seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   In April, WorldCom agreed to spend $26 million over the next four
years for naming rights to the PGA Tour's WorldCom Classic in Hilton
Head Island, S.C., an event that may not be attractive to some
companies because it's held the week after the Masters. Many top
golfers don't play in events close to major events.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Steve Wilmot, tournament director of the WorldCom Classic,
said event organizers would be able to find a replacement if the
phone company doesn't fulfill its contract.</TE>
<TE>   Motor Racing</TE>
<TE>   Ferrari escaped severe punishment for manipulating the finish of
last month's Austrian Grand Prix.</TE>
<TE>   The governing body of Formula One racing, the FIA, imposed a joint
$1 million fine on the automaker and drivers Michael Schumacher and
Rubens Barrichello for improper conduct on the victory stand.</TE>
<TE>   The FIA refused to deduct points for Ferrari's order that
Barrichello let Schumacher pass him to win the race and strengthen
his hold on the season standings, a result that had fans jeering.</TE>
<TE>   Barrichello, who is Brazilian, stood on the top step of the podium
while the German national anthem was played for the winner,
Schumacher. Schumacher then joined him on the top step while the
Italian national anthem was played for Ferrari. Only the winner is
supposed to take the top step.</TE>
<TE>   Hockey</TE>
<TE>   The Mighty Ducks picked up the options on left wing Kevin Sawyer
and center Marc Chouinard.</TE>
<TE>   Sawyer, who will make $475,000, provided toughness for the Ducks
last season and finished fourth in the NHL with 221 penalty minutes.
He had one goal and two points.</TE>
<TE>   Chouinard, who will make $375,000, was solid as a fourth-line
grinder who won 55% of his faceoffs. He had four goals and nine
points.</TE>
<TE>   The San Jose Sharks have temporarily acquired the rights to Theo
Fleury from the New York Rangers. The Sharks said that they got the
rights to Fleury as the future considerations in a minor trade
Sunday. The Sharks gave their sixth-round pick to the Rangers for a
sixth-round pick in the 2003 draft.... Jeff O'Neill, who led the
Carolina Hurricanes in goals the last three seasons, signed a
two-year, $7 million contract with the team.... The Columbus Blue
Jackets signed veteran right wing Grant Marshall and recently drafted
center Lasse Pirjeta. Marshall was re-signed to a multiyear deal,
while Pirjeta's contract is for one season with a club option for a
second.</TE>

<HD>Sheffield's Grand Slam Lifts Braves</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With Gary Sheffield in the middle of the lineup this year, the
Atlanta Braves might finally be able to put away the New York Mets
before September.</LD>
<LD>   Sheffield's tiebreaking grand slam in the eighth inning lifted
Atlanta to a 6-3 victory over the Mets at New York on Wednesday
night. The NL East-leading Braves won for the seventh time in eight
games to open an 8 1/2-game lead on fourth-place New York.</LD>
<LD>   "That's exactly what we got him for," Chipper Jones said of the
former Dodger. "He saved his best swing of the series for the most
crucial spot."</LD>
<TE>   Former Angel Mo Vaughn homered twice for the Mets, including a
titanic shot off Kevin Gryboski more than halfway up the Shea Stadium
scoreboard in right-center field. It was generously estimated at 505
feet, and considered one of the longest home runs in the history of
the ballpark.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to laugh," Sheffield said. "Mo's a strong guy. That was
amazing. His counted for one and mine counted for four."</TE>
<TE>   The Braves have taken two of three so far in the four-game series,
and six of their last seven against New York. The Mets lost for the
fourth time in 11 games overall.</TE>
<TE>   David Weathers (2-3) walked pinch-hitter Keith Lockhart leading
off the eighth. Darren Bragg reached when first baseman Vaughn
bobbled his sacrifice bunt for an error, and both runners moved up on
a sacrifice by Rafael Furcal.</TE>
<TE>   Julio Franco drew a walk from Scott Strickland, and Sheffield
drove the next pitch 410 feet into the left-center bleachers for his
12th home run of the season and eighth career slam.</TE>
<TE>   "Being a power hitter, when you hit it, you know you've got it,"
Sheffield said.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona 9, Houston 1--Randy Johnson held the Astros hitless at
Houston into the sixth inning and didn't allow a run in eight innings
to lead the Diamondbacks.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson (12-2) didn't give up a hit until Gregg Zaun lined a
single to center with one out in the sixth inning. He gave up three
hits and struck out eight in defeating Wade Miller (3-3).</TE>
<TE>   Johnson helped Arizona snap a three-game skid and improved to 9-0
when pitching after a Diamondback loss.</TE>
<TE>   "He definitely is a streak stopper," Arizona's Mark Grace said. "I
was kind of hoping he would get the no-no, but he was still dominant.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember when I played against him, you knew if you won the
first two games and he was pitching the third, you had better believe
you were going to lose."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Finley and Grace drove in two runs apiece for the
Diamondbacks.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco 6, San Diego 5--Shawon Dunston's run-scoring infield
single capped a three-run ninth inning against Padre closer Trevor
Hoffman, and the Giants won at San Francisco on J.T. Snow's RBI
single in the 12th.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman had converted 27 consecutive save chances since Sept. 8 at
Arizona but couldn't protect a three-run lead in the ninth. On
Monday, Hoffman gave up a game-winning homer to Barry Bonds in San
Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Benito Santiago and Snow singled and Bonds walked. Pinch-hitter
Marvin Benard drove in two runs with a double and took third as Bonds
was thrown out at the plate before Dunston's game-tying hit.</TE>
<TE>   "I know Hoffman is the best," Dunston said. "Fortunately I put the
ball in play. I know I'm old, but I can still run."</TE>
<TE>   Florida 6, Philadelphia 2--Pitcher Michael Tejera homered--a day
too late--and Cliff Floyd and Derrek Lee hit consecutive home runs
for the Marlins at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Tejera hit his first career homer, a solo shot in the second
inning. On Tuesday night, after the Marlins ran out of position
players, Tejera was sent up as a pinch-hitter and struck out to end
Florida's 7-6 loss in 11 innings to the Phillies.</TE>
<TE>   Tejera (3-1) gave up one run in five innings.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 5, Milwaukee 2--After the late Darryl Kile's 5-year-old
son Kannon threw out the first pitch, the Cardinals won at St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Woody Williams and Mike Matheny, who spoke at a memorial service
for Kile earlier in the day, played pivotal roles as the Cardinals
ended a four-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Williams (5-3) gave up two runs in 7 2/3 innings and had an RBI
single. Matheny had his first two-RBI game since April 25 as the
Cardinals beat Jamey Wright (1-6).</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 8, Chicago 6--Sean Casey knocked Cub starter Jason Bere
out of the game with a line drive off the pitcher's right knee and
also hit one of four Red home runs at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Walker, Adam Dunn and Juan Encarnacion also homered for the
Reds. Jimmy Haynes (8-6) worked six innings, and Danny Graves got his
23rd save.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 7, Montreal 4--Brian Giles homered and drove in three
runs at Pittsburgh to help Kip Wells win for the first time in five
starts. Mike Williams pitched the ninth for his 21st save.</TE>
<TE>   Expo right fielder Vladimir Guerrero stretched his hitting streak
to 19 games with an RBI single in the eighth.</TE>

<HD>Potvin Stays, Boucher Probably Will Test Market</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Kings ended the suspense Wednesday and exercised their option on
Felix Potvin's contract, guaranteeing the goaltender $3.55 million
next season, including revisions based on his performance last
season.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, General Manager Dave Taylor said he does not expect to
reach a deal before the end of the weekend with defenseman Philippe
Boucher, who will become an unrestricted free agent Monday if not
re-signed by the Kings.</LD>
<LD>   "Where we are [in negotiations], I don't think we'll get a deal
done," Taylor said, "but I can always hope.... It looks like he'll
test the waters."</LD>
<TE>   Exercising the option on Potvin's contract was only a formality
after the goaltender posted a career-best 2.31 goals-against average
while establishing a club record by playing in 71 games, but the
Kings chose to wait.</TE>
<TE>   If they hadn't exercised their option before Monday, Potvin, 31,
also would have become an unrestricted free agent, but the Kings had
no intention of letting that happen. Potvin will become an
unrestricted free agent July 1, 2003, unless the two sides reach
agreement on a new deal in the next 12 months.</TE>

<LD>Clippers' owner Donald Sterling popped a lozenge in his mouth, and
noticing the worried look on my face, he said, "I'm not going to
choke," as he began talking about the prospect of spending a lot of
his money on basketball players.</LD>
<LD>   Sterling is sitting on an NBA gold mine as long as he can continue
to lay claim to the most promising talent in the league, which might
mean putting out more than $80 million each for such players as
Michael Olowokandi, Elton Brand and Lamar Odom.</LD>
<LD>   "I spend that kind of money on any given day in some of my
business dealings, and maybe that much twice a month," Sterling said,
while sitting down with The Times for only the third time since 1990.
"Money is no factor to me."</LD>
<TE>   When I picked myself off the floor, I told him I've dreamed of the
day when he has spent so much money on salaries, he's forced to pay
the NBA luxury tax.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that would be so funny," I said. "You're the last guy in
sports that anyone would ever think would reach the luxury tax.
Imagine that, Mr. Cheapskate, having to pay the luxury tax."</TE>
<TE>   I laughed to show him how funny I thought that would be.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see any humor in that," Sterling said, and he wasn't even
smiling. "But that would be my No. 1 objective in the universe
(hitting the luxury tax). That would mean I have the best players on
my team. If I'm really sincere, and I am, that we will pay all-star
prices for All-Star players, then that's my clear business objective
now."</TE>
<TE>   I'm not sure there is a bigger breaking news story in sports:
"Sterling Wants to Spend Money and as Soon as Possible."</TE>
<TE>   "Why would people think I wouldn't pay for the best?" he said.
"Whether you're in the business of buying buildings, buying banks or
stocks, you want to buy the best. I'm not a slum lord. I buy Beverly
Hills, Westwood, Brentwood. I'm the largest owner in five California
cities and all those cities are the highest-priced cities. I want to
buy the best and will pay the most. But I want quality for my money."</TE>
<TE>   Sterling has yet to demonstrate he's willing to spend in the
sports world, but he said it's because he's never been given the kind
of player who deserves top money. The Clippers now have that in
Brand, who was not only productive last season but showed the
potential to become one of the most popular athletes in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The team could wait two years from now to match an offer for Brand
if he was successful in securing one as a restricted free agent, but
Sterling suggested the Clippers intend to be very aggressive and
spend more than $80 million to make Brand a long-time Clipper
beginning this summer.</TE>
<TE>   I apologized once again for falling out of my chair.</TE>
<TE>   "We would like to sign him for six years [a maximum contract],"
Sterling said. "I'm sure that's Elgin Baylor's plan to sign him, and
to do it this year. Elton is a quality player and a quality person,
and of all the players we have, there is a clear consensus he belongs
here as a cornerstone of the franchise."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   STERLING SAID he would rely on Baylor's judgment when it comes to
paying Olowokandi. "If he wants Olowokandi," Sterling said, "we'll
have Olowokandi."</TE>
<TE>   Baylor, without question, is Olowokandi's biggest supporter, which
suggests a big payday for the center, and smelling salts for
Sterling's accountant.</TE>
<TE>   "Listen, we're generating a lot of money from tickets, a lot of
money from TV and we have some offers from some local TV stations
that are astronomical," Sterling said. "If we make $20 million in
profit, or spend $20 million more than we take in, that's no big deal
to me.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue in this business is to get the best players you can,
keep them and put a competitive team on the floor. I look at
Olowokandi, Odom, Brand, [Darius] Miles, [Corey] Maggette, [Quentin]
Richardson and [Keyon] Dooling as major parts of this organization,
and whatever it takes to sign them, we want to sign them."</TE>
<TE>   When there was talk Wednesday about trading Miles or Odom,
Sterling offered an opinion.</TE>
<TE>   "Any trade Elgin wants to make I would authorize him to pull the
trigger," Sterling said. "Would I personally like to trade Miles? My
answer would be no. I would search every other possibility before I
would trade him.</TE>
<TE>   "Would you trade Odom for Baron Davis?" he asked. "Me, I'm
optimistic that Odom is going to be every bit the great player he was
two years ago."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   STERLING SAID, "I've won in every aspect of my life--except
one--sports. It's not easy to win, and that's why you really have to
congratulate [Laker owner] Jerry Buss. I think he's a genius as a
gambler, and maybe I'm not. He's extremely intelligent. He signed
[Phil Jackson to big money] and I don't know if every owner in the
league thought that coach was that good."</TE>
<TE>   Asked what it felt like to live in a city where the other team is
always riding in a championship parade, he said, "One guy has a
daughter who is Shirley Temple and one guy has a daughter who has no
voice or timing, but both men love their daughters dearly, and I love
my team."</TE>
<TE>   A number of local fans feel the same way. The Clippers have sold
almost 1,500 new season tickets on top of last year's record
attendance, which included 16 consecutive sellouts. And most NBA
observers believe the Clippers are playoff-bound, the future riding
on Sterling's willingness to pay.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been excited before about our team and it's never
materialized," Sterling said. "I'm optimistic, but like everyone
else, I have to see it happen."</TE>
<TE>   I'm optimistic Sterling will spend the money, too, but I'll have
to see it happen.</TE>

<TE>   Update--Some would consider this meeting a potential preview of
the WNBA Finals, although both Los Angeles and Washington have far to
go to reach that goal. Even so, the teams lead their respective
conferences and have the two best records in the WNBA. Still
Washington, which slipped past Sacramento on Tuesday, 87-86, in
double overtime, knows this Western road swing that ends Friday in
Portland can legitimize it as a title contender. Mystic forward
Chamique Holdsclaw, revitalized by energy brought by draft pick
Stacey Dales-Schuman, is having a superstar season and leads the
league in scoring (21.6) and rebounding (12.5). Lisa Leslie (17.6
points, 11.6 rebounds) leads the Sparks in most statistical
categories but clearly is benefiting from the scoring of Mwadi
Mabika, Tamecka Dixon and DeLisha Milton. The Sparks' offensive
balance is the main reason they lead the league in scoring at 78.6
points a game.</TE>

<DL>WIMBLEDON, England</DL>
<LD>Paradorn Srichaphan was in the interview room Wednesday, talking
about the biggest unexpected victory of his life. The Bangkok-born
22-year-old sent Andre Agassi out of Wimbledon in the second round,
stealing the spotlight from Agassi with a charming victory
celebration, a quiet bow and prayer sign to the fans on all four
sides of the court.</LD>
<LD>   Still, he could not steal the spotlight from John McEnroe.</LD>
<LD>   Who can?</LD>
<TE>   After all, no one has been able to do it for more than two decades
at Wimbledon. On the court, McEnroe did it by whining and winning.
Now, he is getting his daily dose of exposure by writing and talking.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday evening, McEnroe was on an NBC conference call. It was
the first opportunity to ask him about accusations made by his
ex-wife, Tatum O'Neal, including charges that he used steroids during
his playing days and once kicked her down some stairs. O'Neal's
interview with Barbara Walters will be on ABC's "20/20" on Friday
night.</TE>
<TE>   The charges and countercharges were started with the recent
release of McEnroe's autobiography, "You Cannot Be Serious." He has
been doing interviews at a frantic clip--you wonder if you'll see him
show up on the Golf Channel one of these days.</TE>
<TE>   By supposedly baring his soul, and, it seems, selling out his
ex-wife and their three children, McEnroe got his desperate wish:
more attention and a No. 1 spot on the New York Times' bestseller
list.</TE>
<TE>   To say he was surprised that O'Neal decided to fight back was
disingenuous. How could he possibly believe mud wouldn't come flying
back after striking the first blow in his book?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm definitely disappointed," he said. "I think it's ridiculous,
but at the same time, this isn't the first or last thing I'll hear.
That's why it forced me to make a statement. I don't know what she's
trying to accomplish. I'm concerned about my own kids. I can handle
it."</TE>
<TE>   His attempt at handling it Wednesday was a decided double-fault.
The statement released Tuesday did not respond to specifics. But he
did not clear up the issue by answering the steroid question directly
on the call, either. Mr. Candor wasn't willing to say whether one of
the game's greatest players used steroids as a performance-enhancing
assist.</TE>
<TE>   "First of all I think I have made it clear where I stand on that
in the statement that I made," he said. "I think it is ridiculous and
unfair. My statement makes it pretty clear as to what my feelings are
on that topic as well as other ones. Unfortunately, it's not as
simple as addressing this one issue, and I believe it's better
served, and my family and children are better served, sticking with
what I said."</TE>
<TE>   Later, he refused to answer another direct question about whether
he used steroids, unwilling to give a simple yes or no. He argued
with one reporter and in typical fashion said: "You're incorrect. You
need to read the book."</TE>
<TE>   After that sparring session, he speculated that O'Neal was unhappy
because he was happy with the success of the book. He worried about
the "horrible things my kids are going to have to deal with" because
of his ex-wife's accusations.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal explained to Walters why she is angry about the book.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, first of all that he would--loose lips sink ships, that he
would do a tell-all," she said. "Talking about me ... and not ask my
permission.... Ah, am I afraid of him? No. Who is gonna fight him if
I'm not? Who's gonna refute some of this ... that's in this book."</TE>
<TE>   She said McEnroe used steroids during his comeback campaign in
1988, after their son Sean was born, and she urged him to stop taking
steroids "because he was becoming violent." Walters asked O'Neal if
tennis officials knew. "I never read about it," O'Neal said.</TE>
<TE>   In another recently released book, "Uncovered," Pat Cash wrote
about smoking marijuana with McEnroe. Cash also caused waves in the
British tabloids and broadsheet newspapers with harsh criticism of
Greg Rusedski, whom he coached in 2001. It says something about the
state of men's tennis that the biggest news in the lead-up to
Wimbledon in England came from books written by two players who have
not been a force on the tour in years.</TE>
<TE>   At least there was a moment of levity, albeit unintentional, near
the end of McEnroe's call.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to be a distraction to the tournament or Wimbledon,"
he said. "I'd like to blend in. I'd like to be the icing on the
cake."</TE>
<TE>   No, not quite. He not only wants to be the icing, but the whole
cake. He also wants to tell everyone what kind of ingredients are in
the cake and what he thinks of it after it is baked.</TE>

<HD>ATP Is Prepared to Begin EPO Testing by September</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Organization will also increase screenings in and
out of events. Pattern of tests will change.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WIMBLEDON, England</DL>
<LD>The ATP said Wednesday it is prepared to start testing for the
performance-enhancing substance EPO by September, and is increasing
in-competition as well as out-of-competition testing.</LD>
<LD>   By raising the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, EPO improves
endurance. In May, the ATP signed on with Swedish-based International
Doping Testing Management (IDTM) to administer its drug-testing
program. IDTM has specialized portable blood testing equipment to
screen for the use of EPO.</LD>
<LD>   But the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) is scheduled to make a
decision as to whether only a urine test is reliable, or if blood and
urine tests are required.</LD>
<TE>   "It makes more sense to wait a few weeks--they [WADA] may just go
with the urine test," ATP spokesman David Higdon said. "We would
begin testing immediately."</TE>
<TE>   The tour also is planning on making the drug-testing patterns less
predictable, for example, starting in the middle of a tournament or
near the end, instead of arriving Monday.</TE>
<TE>   In 2002, the Tennis Anti-Doping Programme--jointly used by the
ITF, the ATP and the WTA tour--is planning to increase the number of
in-competition tests by 20% and out-of-competition tests by 100% from
2001.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Yevgeny Kafelnikov was tested 10 times in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Of players ranked in the top 100, Tommy Robredo of Spain and David
Nalbandian of Argentina fell through the cracks and were not tested
last year, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   What brought the issue of drugs into sharper focus recently were
the criticisms of Frenchman Nicolas Escude during Roland Garros
earlier this month. Escude, in an interview with a French newspaper,
charged the ATP with covering up positive drug tests. The ATP denied
those allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Escude is supposed to meet with Mark Miles, the CEO of the ATP, at
Wimbledon. One source said that Escude wrote a letter of apology to
tour officials.</TE>
<TE>   He wasn't the only critical voice in the Le Parisien article.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe there is a real will to fight against doping,"
Fabrice Santoro told the newspaper. "I don't know whether the testing
is done to catch the guys or just for show. Sometimes, I ask myself
the question, when I see what goes on."</TE>

<DH>Tennis: Sampras stunned by Bastl, Agassi loses to
Srichaphan within a matter of hours. No. 2-seeded Safin also knocked
out.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WIMBLEDON, England</DL>
<LD>Who knew what was about to happen on a picture-perfect English day?</LD>
<LD>   Sixth-seeded Pete Sampras was playing on a sun-baked Court 2
Wednesday at Wimbledon. No. 3 Andre Agassi would take Centre Court in
the afternoon. As Sampras played against lucky loser George Bastl of
Switzerland, ranked 145th, there was the faintest smell of smoke in
the distance, wafting over the grounds.</LD>
<LD>   It was a signal that 2002 Wimbledon was about to go up,
inexplicably, in smoke.</LD>
<TE>   Shockingly, after being linked so many times by success, Sampras
and Agassi were joined in defeat, exiting in the second round within
a couple of hours. It was the first time since they both started
playing at Wimbledon that Agassi and Sampras have lost before the
third round.</TE>
<TE>   Bastl, formerly of USC, who gained entrance into the event only
when another player withdrew, beat Sampras, 6-3, 6-2, 4-6, 3-6, 6-4.
Agassi's loss was slightly less embarrassing but more one-sided.
Paradorn Srichaphan of Thailand played brilliantly, moving Agassi
from side to side at will, winning, 6-4, 7-6 (5), 6-2.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the day, there was one other crushing loss to an
American, though in a different way. Youngster James Blake lost a
marathon to Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands, as the former
champion prevailed, 6-3, 6-4, 3-6, 4-6, 11-9.</TE>
<TE>   The day of disruption also included the loss of No. 2 Marat Safin
of Russia, who was ousted by diminutive Olivier Rochus of Belgium.
The 5-foot-5 Rochus defeated Safin, 6-2, 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (1). It is the
first time in the Open era, which began in 1968, that five of the top
eight seeded players have lost before the third round.</TE>
<TE>   Sampras was devastated. He had counted on turning his year around
here and has now gone two years without a tournament title since
Wimbledon 2000. His eyes glistened as he answered questions.</TE>
<TE>   On the court, he cut a solitary figure after his defeat, the first
time he has lost this early at Wimbledon since 1991. Usually, he
escapes quickly from the court after a devastating loss, but on this
day, the seven-time champion sat woodenly in his chair, staring at
his racket strings, contemplating his future.</TE>
<TE>   He said he plans on returning. Sampras did not want it to end with
a loss on Court 2, which is known as the graveyard of champions.</TE>
<TE>   "I was thinking that," he said. "There's not a question if I'm
going to be back or not back. It all happened so quickly, from 4-4, a
matter of five minutes, 'Boom, I lost the match.' You just kind of
sit there, you're a little numb sitting there."</TE>
<TE>   During changeovers Sampras read a note from his wife, actress
Bridgette Wilson, for inspiration.</TE>
<TE>   He needed some form of motivation. Through the first two sets,
Sampras moved sluggishly. He seemed unable to handle any low slice
from Bastl and kept spraying his backhand.</TE>
<TE>   And, unusually, his serve betrayed him.</TE>
<TE>   "My serve just let me down," said Sampras, who double-faulted 10
times. "There's always one shot I can rely on when I'm not hitting
the ball that well, my serve. I don't know what my percentage was,
but I wasn't getting any in."</TE>
<TE>   The last turning point came when Sampras was broken in the ninth
game of the fifth set when he pushed a forehand half-volley wide,
unable to get past the service line to make the volley. Bastl
finished it by holding his serve, winning on his first match point
when Sampras hit a forehand passing shot long.</TE>
<TE>   There was no shortage of opinions on Sampras' woes after he left
the court with a sad wave. It was only the second grass-court victory
for Bastl in his career, and the first was in the first round against
another lucky loser. ("It's a nice story," Bastl said.)</TE>
<TE>   Said commentator John Lloyd, "It was the worst grass-court match
I've ever seen Pete Sampras play."</TE>
<TE>   Said his former coach Paul Annacone: "I think it's mostly mental.
I think 99% of what is going on is mental right now.... Emotionally,
it gets wearing. You're used to winning five, six, seven tournaments
a year and then you don't win one for three years and you actually
start working harder. You start to work yourself into a deficit."</TE>
<TE>   The shocking impact of Sampras' loss was lessened a bit when
Agassi was dismissed by the little-known Thai player, who is ranked
67th. Agassi was hurt by a close call at 5-5 in the second-set
tiebreaker, which gave Srichaphan a set point, and he took advantage
of the break.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a little stunned," Agassi said. "Certainly disappointed, just
never found my rhythm out there today. Played a very average match
against a guy who was taking it to me and deserved to win....</TE>
<TE>   "A set apiece or two sets down is a big swing. I thought the ball
was long. But what can you do?"</TE>
<TE>   Those are the same kinds of questions Sampras has been asking
himself through a frustrating 2002. He was upset at being placed on
Court 2.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I was playing out there on one of the show courts," he
said. "I plan on being back. I love playing here. It's a tough loss.
I really felt I like I could do it here. I just came up short today.
Pretty bummed out."</TE>
<TE>   His new coach, Jose Higueras, wasn't willing to give up just yet
either.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a fighter myself," he said. "The only time you lose is when
you quit."</TE>

<HD>First the Hype, Now the Pain</HD>
<DH>Market's fall was both predictable and predicted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEAN BAKER</AU>
<BD>Dean Baker, the author of "Double Bubble: The
Over-Valuation of the Stock Market and the Dollar" (Center for
Economic and Policy Research, June 2000), is the co-director of the
Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the last two months, people have begun asking whether the
intelligence agencies had the information, or should have had the
information, needed to prevent the Sept. 11 attacks. It is an
appropriate question.</LD>
<LD>   It is also a question that should be asked about two other
disasters that have done enormous damage to the nation: the crashing
stock market and the plummeting dollar. This week's reports of
fraudulent accounting at WorldCom make this question all the more
urgent.</LD>
<LD>   As a result of the stock market plunge, millions of workers, who
had looked forward to a comfortable retirement, have seen much of
their savings evaporate. They will have to either delay their
retirement or get by with a far lower standard of living. Millions of
other families lost much of their children's college funds. The
dollar's decline will also whack the economy in ways that are just
beginning to be seen. Most important, it will make it more difficult
for the Federal Reserve Board to boost the economy from its current
slump, thus keeping the unemployment rate at high levels.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike the Sept. 11 attacks, there is no question that the
financial disasters were foreseeable--a small group of economists
tried to warn the public about the dangers of an inflated stock
market and overvalued dollar. Unfortunately, we were a small minority
that was largely ignored. Most economists were happy to celebrate the
stock market and dollar bubbles as good news.</TE>
<TE>   Politics played a large role in the story, and the blame is
bipartisan. The Democrats under President Clinton were happy to take
credit for the nation's prosperity at the end of the 1990s. Although
some of the prosperity was real (e.g., the lowest unemployment rate
in 30 years), the bubble part of it was not. But there was little
political value in calling attention to this fact. The Republicans
did not want to burst the bubbles because the illusory prosperity
provided the revenue to pay for their tax cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Recognizing these bubbles didn't require great insight. For
example: To see the story of the stock market, imagine that there is
a government bond that pays $5 interest every year and has always
sold on the market for $100. This means that the bond pays a 5%
return. Now imagine that the price of the bond has been bid up to
$200. Since the bond still pays just $5 a year in interest, the
return will have fallen to 2.5%.</TE>
<TE>   Unless people are willing to receive a much lower return on this
bond than they had in the past, the $200 price will not hold. To
escape this logic, profits would have to grow far faster than any
serious economists projected. Even the accounting scandals now being
exposed were both predictable and predicted.</TE>
<TE>   In a world in which investors are willing to believe unreal
numbers, it is inevitable that some will seek to profit by
deliberately producing their own unreal numbers. But the country did
not have to be taken in.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the economists acted like the accountants at Arthur
Andersen and said exactly what those with money and power wanted them
to say.</TE>
<TE>   The reporters who cover these issues, with few exceptions, acted
just like the business reporters who repeatedly named Enron one of
the nation's top companies: They celebrated the bubbles.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, "strong dollar" became a mantra, with few showing any
recognition of its implications. In short, the people with
responsibility, who should have known better, completely failed in
their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   But one feature of the "new economy" seems likely to hold through
this disaster. The people on top, those who were most responsible,
will survive relatively unharmed by the crashes.</TE>
<TE>   Few economists, economic reporters or market analysts are going to
find themselves either out of work or facing poverty in their old
age. That fate will be reserved for the people who listened to their
advice.</TE>

<HD>What Technology Giveth, Mergers of Media Taketh Away</HD>
<DH>Consolidation is constricting access and diversity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NORMAN HOROWITZ</AU>
<BD>Norman Horowitz is a media consultant and former
president of Columbia Pictures Television Worldwide Distribution,
Polygram Television and MGM/UA Telecommunications, as well as a
former CBS/Viacom executive.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Looking back on our nation's history, it seemed reasonable to have
regulations that prevented a concentration of media ownership. It
made sense that if you owned a newspaper in a market, you should have
been precluded from owning a radio or television station in that same
market.</LD>
<LD>   These cross-ownership restrictions prevented a single voice from
dominating the distribution of information and entertainment in a
market.</LD>
<LD>   Diversity of ownership creates opportunities for diversity of
content. Concentration of ownership has historically led to a
reduction in creativity because, when that's the case, content
control rests in the hands of a few.</LD>
<TE>   The Federal Communications Commission has said it is interested in
"encouraging diversity and competition in the media."</TE>
<TE>   So how could further consolidation--such as Viacom swallowing all
of NBC--possibly result in diversity or competition?</TE>
<TE>   Certainly the passage of time and the miracles of technology have
given many voices the opportunity to be heard in each market. Sadly,
some of the voices are considerably louder than others.</TE>
<TE>   Though the latest technology does offer new opportunities to
supply news, information and entertainment to Americans, free access
to these systems is being throttled by such conglomerates as Walt
Disney/ABC; News Corp./Fox; General Electric/NBC/CNBC/MSNBC;
Viacom/CBS-UPN; and AOL/Time Warner/CNN/WB.</TE>
<TE>   Given the apparent popularity of corporate piggybacking, it is
unlikely that delivery systems and program services will experience a
greater diversity of ownership in the near term.</TE>
<TE>   Having already allowed an incredible consolidation of power in the
over-the-air delivery services, the FCC is sailing full speed ahead
to remove regulatory impediments that prevent further consolidation
of the broadcast industry. The FCC also is looking to eliminate
cross-ownership restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   One would think it self-evident that a single company--let's say
Viacom--should not own three over-the-air broadcast networks, not to
mention an unlimited number of radio stations throughout the country,
plus newspapers in the cities serviced by its cable and satellite
networks.</TE>
<TE>   I'd really like to hear FCC Chairman Michael Powell explain to the
nation why such consolidation is beneficial to the interests of
Americans who are not shareholders of these giant companies.</TE>
<TE>   Does Powell believe that program diversity can emanate from these
vertically and horizontally integrated corporations?</TE>
<TE>   Does he believe that these consolidations will encourage valid
criticism of our government as it pursues activities that an
independent media might not think are in the best interest of its
citizens?</TE>
<TE>   The American media have grown under the control of a politically
motivated regulatory process. What we have done under the battle cry
of deregulation is to concentrate the power of the media into the
hands of a very few.</TE>
<TE>   Network executives testified before the FCC that if the
regulations covering financial interest and syndication were removed,
they would not attempt to control prime-time programming scheduled by
their network.</TE>
<TE>   Did they do what they promised? No, they acted in their own
self-interest and in a manner contrary to their promises to the FCC.
This is what networks do and have always done.</TE>
<TE>   Our country should not give media moguls more power and influence
than they already have.</TE>
<TE>   Other voices should be heard along with these existing
powerhouses.</TE>
<TE>   Governmental decisions regarding the media should be governed by
the public interest, not corporate interest.</TE>
<TE>   One solution would be for the FCC to at least maintain current
media regulations until, say, 2020, to allow the competitive
conditions to level out. This might not suit the interests of Michael
Eisner, Rupert Murdoch, Bob Wright, Steve Case or Sumner Redstone.
But it might just suit the best interests of the citizens of the U.S.
of A.</TE>

<HD>Close the Chapter on Arafat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT SATLOFF</AU>
<BD>Robert Satloff is the director of policy and strategic
planning of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After charting a bold new path for Arab-Israeli peace, President Bush
needs to quickly close a loophole through which Yasser Arafat could
emerge as the popularly elected leader of the Palestinians.
Otherwise, Bush's Monday speech could amount to little more than a
brief detour on the way to creating a new terrorist state in the
Middle East.</LD>
<LD>   The president issued a stinging indictment of the current
Palestinian leadership--i.e., the unnamed Arafat--and called on
Palestinian voters to go to the polls early next year to choose "new
leaders, not compromised by terrorism." However, in a glaring lacuna,
he did not specifically say their terrorist pasts had disqualified
Arafat and his close colleagues from participating in any U.S.-backed
political process.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, contrary to what many national news outlets reported, he
did not specifically call on Palestinians to remove Arafat.</LD>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, Arafat--the opportunist par
excellence--immediately sought to capitalize on Bush's gentility.
With a straight face, he embraced the speech, endorsed new elections
and expressed bemusement that anyone would infer that the reference
was to him when Bush denounced Palestinian leaders who had
"trafficked in terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   More surprising have been statements by some U.S. officials
suggesting that Arafat could emerge from elections as the legitimate,
accepted leader of the Palestinian people.</TE>
<TE>   "We will see what they [the Palestinians] decide they want through
these elections," Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said Tuesday,
"and the United States will respect whatever they say as a people
when these elections are held."</TE>
<TE>   Surely, certifying Arafat's leadership through an election was not
Bush's intent. A lifetime of terrorism and corruption, with the
terrible coda of his personal involvement in the organizing,
financing and praising of suicide bombings over the last two years,
cannot be compatible with the president's call for a Middle East
infused with the "universal hopes" of dignity, prosperity and
freedom. In fact, no true democratic election can take place with
Arafat's control over the machinery of the Palestinian Authority in
the months leading to an election.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, therefore, should act now to fix this problem by revoking
the legal waiver he and President Clinton have routinely issued since
1993 that permits the United States to deal with the Palestine
Liberation Organization and allows the PLO to have political offices
on U.S. soil. This would effectively suspend U.S. ties with Arafat
and his close colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   There are three groups it is especially important to ban from
political life in the months leading to an election and to prevent
from appearing on the ballot or from serving in subsequent leadership
positions: Palestinian Authority officials formally accused of
corruption by the Palestinian legislature, heads of PA security
organizations and members of the PLO Executive Committee.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Washington should inform its European and Arab
allies that it will not recognize a Palestinian election in which
Arafat participates, so if they are keen on helping Palestinians
achieve statehood they should hasten Arafat's departure from power
well before plans for a Palestinian election take shape.</TE>
<TE>   Bush deserves great credit for offering Palestinians and Israelis
the prospect of a hopeful future, post-Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   It would be a shame if Arafat were himself atop that new
Palestinian state.</TE>

<HD>A Spoonful of Jitters to Garnish the Hot Dogs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NORAH VINCENT</AU>
<BD>Norah Vincent is a senior fellow at the Foundation for
the Defense of Democracies, a think tank set up after Sept. 11 to
study terrorism. Web site: www.norahvincent.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Next Thursday is our nation's birthday, and by the way we're leading
up to it, you'd think it was doomsday. We've got the jitters, and
bad. But who can blame us?</LD>
<LD>   We've been deluged with the news of so many plots afoot, or
potentially afoot, or in the planning stages, or as yet unhatched in
some captured aide-de-camp's brain at Camp X-Ray, that the summer
blockbusters seem like G-rated fairy tales. But the worst that 20th
Century Fox's smash hit "Independence Day" envisioned back in 1996
has already come to pass. The Empire State Building is still intact,
but the World Trade Center towers are gone and the White House might
have been too if that fourth plane had hit. All we're missing are the
aliens.</LD>
<LD>   What will we do for entertainment this Fourth of July if real life
has outstripped the special effects? Well, worry. That and
obsessively envision the worst. Forget celebrating. I for one am glad
I'm going to be in the mountains.</LD>
<TE>   In an effort to make themselves look clever and efficient in
fighting the war on terror, the feds have contributed mightily to
this state of panic most of us are in. They're vigorously patting
themselves on the back for catching "dirty" bomber suspect Jose
Padilla before, they say, he'd even fully formulated his plan to
build such a device. Not only that, they're keeping the buzz up about
the effects of a dirty bomb (a conventional explosive that spreads
radioactive matter), who could make one and how relatively easy it
would be to do so.</TE>
<TE>   The International Atomic Energy Agency got in on the gloom act
Monday, announcing that almost any nation in the world has the
radioactive materials needed to build a dirty bomb and that more than
100 of these countries do not have controls that are adequate to
prevent their theft. Gee, thanks, guys. With that news under our
belts, the nitrates in a few hot dogs won't seem so bad after all.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's the White House setting an equally fear-mongering
example. Not only did the authorities make a big fanfare of
evacuating the White House recently when a private single- engine
Cessna strayed into restricted airspace, they did a botched job of
it, liberating the all-important press but failing to herd out the
president and his staff.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't help that another would-be sleuth, Michael Hamdan, felt
compelled to throw his two cents into the pot. Hamdan claimed to have
overheard a cell phone conversation between two men speaking in
Arabic about the destruction of Las Vegas and thus concluded that the
city of corruption was a likely bombing target for July 4. After
Hamdan failed a lie-detector test, the feds announced that it was not
a credible threat. Have a nice Fourth.</TE>
<TE>   The worst part of all this hype and deflation of hype is that at
some point we'll become desensitized, if we haven't become so
already, and that will be much worse for all concerned. We've already
started laughing off rumors of threats. Reports of a purported plan
by Al Qaeda to dump 40 operatives and their weapons on Santa Catalina
Island to launch an attack on Los Angeles were met mostly with
nonchalance or derision.</TE>
<TE>   This state of controlled panic isn't good, but staying home
paralyzed by fear isn't the worst that could happen. It's when we
sink back into our seats at the multiplex and laugh at terrorism
scenarios that the terrorists--as everyone has been so fond of
saying--will have indeed won.</TE>

<HD>Africa Vies for G-8's Ear</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Urgent though their agenda is, the leaders of five African nations
are going to have a hard time keeping discussion focused on their
continent's needs when they meet today in the Canadian Rockies with
the leaders of the world's seven top industrial nations and Russia.
Since last year's gathering of these rich nations--known as the Group
of Eight--the Middle East has erupted in mayhem and terrorists have
hammered the free world. There are indications that the United States
wants the G-8 nations to concentrate on those topics. We encourage
them to find time for Africa too.</LD>
<LD>   Four of every 10 people in sub-Saharan Africa live on less than $1
a day. Africa's share in world trade amounts to less than 2%.
Illiteracy is widespread. Almost one-third of the population--about
200 million people--has no access to health services, and 25% of some
countries' inhabitants are infected with HIV or have AIDS. Life
expectancy is the lowest in the world and safe drinking water is
scarce.</LD>
<LD>   Last year's G-8 summit in Genoa, Italy, triggered the creation of
an "action plan" to help Africa. There's a good reason to find money
for the plan this year: By recognizing that African nations must
transform themselves and then play the key role in eradicating
poverty, bolstering sustainable growth and spurring development, the
plan makes sense.</LD>
<TE>   Africa is the least democratic region in the world, with only nine
of 53 countries extending basic political and civil liberties to
citizens. Yet according to the World Bank, a number of repressive
regimes like Cameroon, Eritrea and Equatorial Guinea received
significantly more aid money per capita than democratic states like
Botswana, Mauritius and South Africa. The industrial world has grown
weary of watching money used not for malnourished children with
distended bellies but by corrupt leaders for chateaus in the South of
France.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new plan, only countries that achieve good governance,
rule of law, economic growth and poverty reduction will receive more
aid. Other rewards include market access and additional debt relief.
The selection of recipients will be based on peer reviews by African
countries.</TE>
<TE>   Recognizing that democracy tends to flounder when people are being
blown to bits, the plan also offers assistance in resolving the
conflicts that cripple parts of the continent, along with money to
remove land mines.</TE>
<TE>   The G-8 nations need to look ahead. This self-help initiative
would help Africa participate in the global economy before it becomes
as big a preoccupation for the industrialized world as terrorism and
the Middle East.</TE>

<LD>So WorldCom was cooking its books to the tune of more than $3.9
billion. News of this sort is becoming less shocking. WorldCom, whose
troubles may also pull down long-distance carrier MCI, is probably
headed toward the largest bankruptcy filing in the history of the
United States. In the wake of dozens of other companies 'fessing up
to crooked practices, the question on spooked investors' minds is:
Who's next? And just where is the government?</LD>
<LD>   It's hard to think of a more conclusive end to the booming 1990s,
when small investors were repeatedly assured by all the investment
houses that being in the highflying end of the stock market was the
only way to prepare for their golden years.</LD>
<LD>   Market historians already point to the slavish worship of the
entrepreneur and the stock market that took hold. WorldCom, like so
many technology companies, emerged from obscurity to become a sudden
financial giant. The surprise may be that it took so long to go poof.</LD>
<TE>   There were plenty of abettors, like the accountants and
consultants of Arthur Andersen who colluded with Enron to mislead
investors. (We don't know yet what accountants did for WorldCom.) And
then there are the charlatans like television pundit James Glassman,
who published "Dow 36,000" on the eve of the collapse of the stock
market.</TE>
<TE>   No one should have been oblivious to the inherent risks of buying
stocks, but the American economic system rests on investor confidence
that the market is not rigged in favor of a few corrupt individuals.
That confidence has evaporated along with the reputations of national
companies like Rite Aid, Adelphia and Merrill Lynch, tugging the Dow
briefly below 9,000 Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The business icons of the 1990s have been smashed, and good
riddance. But before the bits and pieces are swept under the rug, a
reckoning must take place. It's no coincidence that many of the most
audacious companies were also big political contributors.</TE>
<TE>   The 17 companies being scrutinized for financial irregularities by
federal investigators, from WorldCom to MicroStrategy, gave Democrats
almost $2.2 million and the GOP more than $2.9 million in the last 18
months, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.</TE>
<TE>   But at least House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt is gearing
up to demand action. House Majority Leader Dick Armey is still
polishing his fiddle amid the flames, quashing any crackdown on
companies that evade taxes by having mailboxes in Bermuda.</TE>
<TE>   If any lesson is clear, it's that the American economic system
cannot regulate itself.</TE>
<TE>   Congress must start with legislation to increase funding for the
Securities and Exchange Commission so it can regain its watchdog
role. It must rein in accountants who serve as analysts for the
companies they are supposed to be supervising. Otherwise, investors
will continue to believe that a clean stock market is no more
attainable for the average Joe or Jill than Martha Stewart's gleaming
kitchen.</TE>

<HD>A Godforsaken Ruling</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled 2 to 1
that the Pledge of Allegiance--you know, "I pledge allegiance to the
flag of the United States of America ... "--is unconstitutional. And
the reason? Because of the phrase "under God" inserted by Congress 48
years ago.</LD>
<LD>   The court said an atheist or holder of non-Judeo-Christian beliefs
could see these words as an endorsement of monotheism, even though
students can opt out.</LD>
<LD>   "A profession that we are a nation 'under God' is identical, for
establishment clause purposes, to a profession that we are a nation
'under Jesus,' a nation 'under Vishnu,' a nation 'under Zeus' or a
nation 'under no god' because none of these professions can be
neutral with respect to religion," wrote Judge Alfred T. Goodwin.</LD>
<TE>   It's a fundamentally silly ruling, which deserves to be tossed
out, as was the initial suit by a Sacramento atheist. For now,
erasing the pledge applies only to 9th Circuit states--California,
Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon and
Washington. Implementation of the ruling is suspended pending
appeals.</TE>
<TE>   The original 1892 pledge didn't contain the phrase "under God,"
which was added after a vigorous debate during a period of loyalty
oaths and Red-baiting. The Cold War insertion of the phrase in 1954
clearly was driven as much by ideology as religion. That said, for
all the overheated and dire predictions voiced then, the "under God"
phrase has in no way led to establishment of an official state
religion. Further, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1943 that it was
unconstitutional to force pledge recitations. Thus the 9th Circuit
decision is a cure without an ailment.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, references to the Almighty have long been an integral
part of everyday American life--honest to God. That's not too
surprising for a nation initially organized by Europeans fleeing
persecution for practicing their beliefs in God. The pledge ("one
nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all") is
recited daily by millions, with few, if any, enforcement problems
over which words someone mumbles or skips.</TE>
<TE>   When taking office, many government officials, including judges,
take an oath invoking God. Court witnesses swear to tell the truth
"so help me God." In fact, the Supreme Court, where this case should
go with Godspeed, opens sessions with a reference to God.</TE>
<TE>   And what about that oppressive song "God Bless America" that the
entire Congress sang on government property after Sept. 11? Then
there's the problem of U.S. currency, which may now be
unconstitutional because it says, "In God We Trust." The appeal
should come swiftly. God willing, it will.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>As telecommunications giant WorldCom Inc. tumbles toward almost
certain bankruptcy, the campaign finance industry that fuels politics
on Capitol Hill is in danger of losing yet another
multimillion-dollar player.</LD>
<LD>   In the last decade, WorldCom, its MCI subsidiary, its officers and
its employees have pumped more than $4 million into the campaign
coffers of the Republican and Democratic parties and their
candidates--more than half of that in the last three years, according
to Federal Election Commission records and two independent groups
that monitor campaign finance.</LD>
<LD>   In the current congressional election cycle alone--a period when
the company's stock was tanking and federal investigations into its
practices mounted--WorldCom and its key employees donated more than
$1 million to both parties and candidates, ranking it among the
nation's top 50 donors.</LD>
<TE>   WorldCom has been generous to both sides of the aisle: That
$1-million-plus total was almost evenly divided between Republicans
and Democrats, according to the Dwight L. Morris &amp; Associates
campaign finance project and the Center for Responsive Politics.</TE>
<TE>   Disclosure documents show that WorldCom's donations targeted
specific issues and specific members of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Charles W. "Chip" Pickering Jr. (R-Miss.), who represents the
district that includes WorldCom's headquarters in Clinton, was the
largest individual recipient. He received $57,500 since 1991,
including $6,000 in personal donations from Bernard J. Ebbers,
WorldCom's former chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   Second on the list was Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.), who
received a total of $31,166 in WorldCom-related money since 1991 and
is now poised, as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, to play
a critical role in defeating legislation that the company has
bitterly opposed.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom and its money have been heavyweights in the battle over
the Internet Freedom and Broadband Deployment Act of 2001, which
became one of the more heated lobbying wars of the current
congressional session.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, the bill would open new access ramps for the
"Baby Bell" regional telephone powerhouses to compete in the
long-distance data industry, which is dominated by the long-distance
giants AT&amp;T Corp., Sprint Corp. and WorldCom. By easing 6-year-old
anti-monopolistic restrictions on the Bells, the law would cut into
WorldCom's profit.</TE>
<TE>   Last February, WorldCom and its allies lost their first battle to
kill the bill in the House, which narrowly approved it in
February--after WorldCom's alliance was outspent in campaign
financing.</TE>
<TE>   Together, WorldCom, Sprint and AT&amp;T together contributed about $12
million to federal campaigns in the three years before the House
vote, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.</TE>
<TE>   The Baby Bells--which include SBC Communications Inc., the parent
of Pacific Bell--contributed $19.4 million during that period.</TE>
<TE>   But WorldCom's group may yet win the war. The legislation now
rests in the Senate, where Hollings publicly vowed before the House
vote that the bill would be "dead on arrival."</TE>
<TE>   Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) ranks third on
WorldCom's individual recipient list since 1991, with a total of
$30,500 going to the senator and his political action committees.
Lott represents the company's home state.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom is not the most generous of the corporate donors that
have fallen since Enron Corp. filed for bankruptcy protection Dec. 2.
The energy-trading giant itself spread $6 million around the election
landscape in the last decade--$2 million of it in the period before
the 2000 presidential elections.</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm that audited both Enron and
WorldCom and was convicted this month on federal charges of
obstructing justice, contributed $5.2 million to federal parties and
candidates in the same period.</TE>
<TE>   And Global Crossing Ltd., another telecom corporation embroiled in
bankruptcy and federal inquiries, contributed $1 million in the last
two years alone.</TE>
<TE>   Times researcher Robert Patrick contributed to this report.</TE>

<LD>Re "Gay Pride Confronts an Identity Crisis," June 24: Although I'm a
50-year-old libertarian gay man, I am not now, nor have I ever been,
a member of any "community." If people are astonished to discover
that "the gay community has long experienced a certain amount of
internal dissent," then they must not get out much.</LD>
<LD>   Imagine making the statement about an imaginary "women's
community" or "adolescent community." Aside from the obvious
us-versus-them factor, it seems that most of the confusion comes from
equating the mythical gay community with the very real,
self-righteous, naive, thought-police community. And although it
isn't necessary to be gay to be a member of the Stalinist community,
sadly, it obviously doesn't hurt, either.</LD>

<LD>It seems hard to believe that a mother would kill two of her own
children (" 'Motherly Love' Cited in Sons' Deaths," June 20).
However, if you have gone through the terrible, agonizing years of
Huntington's disease you would have an insight into what went on in
Carol Carr's mind.</LD>
<LD>   My wife has the disease. She cannot speak, she drools, she
falls--it goes on and on. Her problems started in the mid-1980s. It
is usually a very slow process. My wife may live for another 10
years, and she is only going to deteriorate more. My daughter got
tested because she and her husband wanted to have children. She has
the gene, but no symptoms. She is 28 years old. Now I get to contend
with her situation.</LD>
<LD>   I can just imagine Carr watching her two boys waste away. She must
have felt hopeless. Although I do not condone her actions, I can
understand. Now she is going to have to live the rest of her life
knowing she killed her two boys. Life can be very cruel, but you
cannot let it keep you down. With Huntington's disease you must play
the genes you and your family were dealt.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   We Huntington's disease caregivers always secretly hope for a
celebrity victim to help us get publicity and research funding. But
this is so heart-wrenching. My heart goes out to that brave woman. I
know several families that are similarly afflicted and are hanging on
by a thread. My husband is now in a nursing home after my having
cared for him for several years at home.</TE>
<TE>   Huntington's is a dreadful disease, totally hereditary, each child
having a 50% chance of getting it. There is no treatment and no cure.
We just watch its victims deteriorate mentally and physically for 10
to 20 years and finally die. We pray that stem-cell research will
find a cure for our children and grandchildren before they start
showing symptoms.</TE>

<LD>I have to disagree with your June 22 editorial, "Too Much Hunger by
Half." You state, "Children in California go hungry because state and
county officials can't make the food stamp program work right." No,
it's not that at all.</LD>
<LD>   Children go hungry, with very few exceptions, because their
parents were irresponsible in having them when they could not afford
them in the first place. Kids are really expensive (I know!), and not
everyone has the financial resources to take care of them properly.
If you can't afford them just yet, hold off until you can.</LD>

<HD>Bush's Speech Put the Burden on Palestinians</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Bush Declares His Path," editorial, June 25: President Bush could
not have been clearer that Yasser Arafat has to go. Nor could he have
been more emphatic in rejecting the idea of cosmetic reforms that
would simply reinforce the existing regime. This marks a historic
departure from the "let's pretend" universe in which previous
diplomatic initiatives took place. Bush also paired his expressions
of solidarity with Israeli suffering under terrorist attack--noting
that even Israeli kindergartens are now under armed guard--with
sympathy for Palestinians suffering under their own regime. He
described Palestinians, accurately, as "pawns" but avoided mentioning
whose pawns they were--the Arab regimes'.</LD>
<LD>   For years, the U.S. acted as if the real obstacle to peace was
Israel's reluctance to give up land. The great breakthrough in this
speech was the unmistakable shift in the U.S. interpretation of the
root causes of the conflict. The concept of land for peace has been
relegated to where it should have been all along: a reflection or
ratification of peace, rather than its source or cause.</LD>
<LD>   Mature democracies rarely war with each other. Now the president
has noted this fact and embraced its wisdom. For this alone, he
stands at the cusp of greatness.</LD>

<TE>   Re "A Palestinian State Requires New Leadership, Bush Says," June
25: Bush has washed his hands of the Middle East. By linking any
peace initiative to a regime change in the Palestinian Authority he
has sent the message that he cannot find a way out of the political
morass he, his advisors and Ariel Sharon have created. He hopes that
by postponing the issue for a political eternity--at least 18
months--American and world attention will shift from his failings as
a Middle East peacemaker to other, more flattering topics.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps he thinks that his claims to world leadership will be
vindicated by a successful invasion of Iraq in about 12 months. But
the Middle East is filled with people and leaders who don't forget,
and America's self-serving consignment of the Palestinian problem to
time and the malign workings of Sharon will long be remembered. The
American people should also consider how long the world and our
country can endure the intellectual and moral vacuum that is George
W. Bush before the need for true leadership by the world's only
superpower can no longer be ignored.</TE>

<TE>   Bush said exactly what needed to be said. There was no diplomacy
in his language, just blunt American policy that spared no punches on
Arafat's failed leadership. The gauntlet has been tossed to the
Palestinians. If they continue on the road of suicide-murder, they
will have no support from the U.S. and could risk moving into the
cross hairs of our war against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Lionel De Leon</TE>
<TE>   Garden Grove</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Although the Palestinians live in "squalor and occupation," Bush
believes the burden rests squarely on their shoulders to produce "new
leaders, new institutions and new security arrangements with their
neighbors." What do the Palestinians get in return? A "provisional
state" that sounds a lot like the crazy patchwork of autonomous zones
that came out of the Oslo accords. Israeli "settlement activity" will
be brought to a halt when Israel sees fit. Someday the Palestinians
and Israelis will somehow work out final borders, the status of
Jerusalem and the refugee issue. Yet no timeline, framework or basic
ideas were set down by Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Oslo took nearly a decade of vague promises to accomplish nothing,
and this plan represents more of the same. In the meantime, the
occupation and the settlements continue. Hard times call for bold
leadership, and Bush's speech missed the mark once again.</TE>

<HD>GOP Should Retain Its Partisan Principles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One has to marvel at the hubris exhibited by Frank del Olmo ("Trying
to Exorcise a GOP Demon," Commentary, June 23). After commending GOP
gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr. for courting Latino voters,
and after encouraging the California GOP to back away from
Proposition 187-style "anti-immigrant themes," he ends his commentary
by saying that, should the GOP abandon its anti-immigrant tendencies,
it "just might help bring some partisan balance back into California
politics."</LD>
<LD>   If the state GOP becomes more like the Democrats by abandoning the
millions of Californians (of all races and ethnicities) who consider
illegal immigration to be a major problem for our state, then we
won't have "partisan balance." Turning the GOP into the Democrats
will only serve to give us two Democratic parties. I would rather
have a minority of Republican state legislators who stick by their
principles and represent people like me than a "balanced" Legislature
in which both parties are practically indistinguishable.</LD>
<LD>   Del Olmo should be reminded that voters in California
overwhelmingly passed ballot initiatives that restricted services to
illegal immigrants, ended race-based affirmative action and scuttled
bilingual education. This is what the majority of California voters
want. We deserve to have at least one party in this state that
represents our views.</LD>

<HD>Normal Crop Rotation in the Imperial Valley</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In "Farmers Oppose Call to Idle Land," your excellent June 17 article
about the resistance to fallowing in the Imperial Valley, Adan
Ortega, who is identified as an executive of the Metropolitan Water
District of Southern California, compares this controversial practice
to normal "crop rotation." The difference, of course, is that normal
crop rotation is done in the interest of conserving and sustaining
the land, while fallowing is intended to destroy it. Normal crop
rotation gives the land a rest; fallowing gives it back to the
desert. Normal crop rotation protects local jobs; fallowing exports
them elsewhere.</LD>
<LD>   To suggest otherwise is cynical and shortsighted. Imperial Valley
farmers are among the most efficient and productive anywhere in the
world, and their use of water to grow food and fiber isn't just good
for this valley and California, it's good for the country.</LD>

<LD>Re "Jurors Find Attias Insane," June 21: Regarding David Attias, how
insane can one be, theoretically, when one attends a university,
drives a European car solo around town, smokes marijuana and parties
very frequently? Clearly our justice system has once again
demonstrated that murder of four innocent lives is not OK--unless one
or one's parents have got the filthy lucre and the fame. Compassion
for the rich and famous is a social disease from which even our
supposedly just and fair judicial system is not immune.</LD>

<HD>Coronadans Fear Free Passage on Bridge Will Still Take a
Toll</HD>
<DH>Transportation: Fare is being eliminated on the span
linking San Diego with upscale peninsula. Residents say it will make
a bad traffic situation worse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CORONADO</DL>
<LD>At 10 o'clock tonight--or very shortly thereafter--something will
happen on the San Diego-Coronado Bridge that has never happened in
its 33-year history: A motorist driving alone will cross the bridge
into Coronado for free. Free.</LD>
<LD>   And when he or she returns to San Diego, that trip too will be
free.</LD>
<LD>   After years of debate stretching from here to Sacramento, the
2.1-mile, pale-blue, curvilinear span over San Diego Bay is being
dropped from that handful of California bridges that charge tolls.</LD>
<TE>   Soon the city of Coronado--which prefers to consider itself an
island, although it is actually a peninsula--will discover whether a
long-anticipated civic nightmare becomes reality.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Coronado officials fought the idea of dropping the $1
entry toll. They feared it would greatly increase traffic on the
city's already car-clogged streets by removing the motivation of
workers at North Island Naval Air Station, Coronado's main employer,
to form car pools, which have crossed the bridge free since 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Although long praised by aesthetes for its grace and melding of
form and function, the span is the bane of civic life in upscale
Coronado (population 23,000). Old-timers pine for the days when
Coronado was accessible only by ferry from San Diego or by car from
Imperial Beach along the Silver Strand.</TE>
<TE>   The bridge "nearly ruined Coronado," said James Kenwald, a
resident since pre-bridge days. "It turned a nice, quiet community
into a racetrack. Now it'll just get worse."</TE>
<TE>   To mollify residents, the county's regional planning agency, which
has authority over bridge tolls, has promised to work to alleviate
traffic congestion and find ways to slow down drivers who will no
longer have to stop at a toll booth.</TE>
<TE>   The bridge is from an era long passed: when San Diego legislators
had major clout in Sacramento and the governor felt beholden to the
city.</TE>
<TE>   The bridge was approved during the reign of Gov. Pat Brown. That
Brown's biggest political supporter in San Diego was tycoon John
Alessio, then owner of the Hotel del Coronado and a major bridge
booster, did not hurt.</TE>
<TE>   When it opened in 1969, the toll was 60 cents each way. In 1980,
that was changed to a one-way toll of $1.20, prompting local wits to
suggest Coronado was the only local city with a cover charge. That
was later trimmed to $1. The San Diego Assn. of Governments decided
in October to end the tolls. The $48 million in bonds used to build
the bridge were paid off in 1986. Once the kitty of collected tolls
is depleted, the state will pay for bridge upkeep.</TE>
<TE>   Although the bridge forever changed Coronado and the Barrio Logan
neighborhood on the San Diego side, it would be wrong to say it
dominates the skyline.</TE>
<TE>   It was never meant to make a statement like bridges with famous
names such as Golden Gate and Brooklyn.</TE>
<TE>   Architectural critic Kay Kaiser says the bridge's true
accomplishment is in being nonintrusive in design and color.</TE>
<TE>   "It curves out and away from land and doesn't slam you in the
face," Kaiser said. "It's hard to make that much concrete elegant,
but they did it."</TE>
<TE>   The toll-takers have all been offered other jobs in Caltrans,
which controls the bridge. Tonight, they will gather for a
sentimental remembrance of VIPs and others who have passed by the
tollbooths--like President Clinton, who saluted; Queen Elizabeth and
Prince Philip, who waved; and Madonna, who did nothing.</TE>
<TE>   The San Diego Assn. of Governments is having a party to watch the
final motorist pay the final $1. The news media will be assembled.</TE>
<TE>   There will be no celebrating at Coronado City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Coronado officials are concerned about an association study that
shows use of the bridge increasing by 11,000 trips daily, to 90,000
trips, once the toll is no more. Already, the street leading from the
bridge is the most heavily traveled in the county.</TE>
<TE>   "We're concerned, and we're going to be watching very closely,"
said City Manager Mark Ochenduszko.</TE>

<HD>Sheriff's Budget Cut as Libraries Are Spared</HD>
<DH>Finances: The health department takes the largest hit as
county supervisors approve an austere spending plan for the coming
year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN LARRUBIA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors cut at least $60 million
from the Sheriff's Department on Wednesday but spared the library
system from significant reductions as it approved a mostly austere
budget for the coming fiscal year.</LD>
<LD>   "We're really grateful to the board and relieved," County
Librarian Margaret Donnellan Todd said. "We did not want to close
libraries or reduce hours, and we know the board didn't want to
either."</LD>
<LD>   The budget proposed by the county's top administrator and adopted
by the board in May recommended $8.4 million in cuts to services and
books to cover waning revenues.</LD>
<TE>   Officials estimated that the library would have to cut a third of
its hours or close 15 branches and reduce hours at other branches to
make up the shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   On a motion by Supervisor Don Knabe, the board agreed to restore
$7.2 million to its budget.</TE>
<TE>   The county health department was by far the biggest loser,
suffering cuts that will save the county $150 million when fully
implemented.</TE>
<TE>   Another was Sheriff Lee Baca, who had held a number of news
conferences to warn of dire consequences if the board did not fund
all his programs.</TE>
<TE>   But on Wednesday Baca seemed resigned to the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   He said he will close the Century Detention facility and end a
popular community policing program.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what I have to do to make my budget next year," Baca
said.</TE>
<TE>   To ease his pain, the board postponed repayment of $12.7 million
that the county lent him when he overspent his budget last year.</TE>
<TE>   The mental health department sustained $28.9 million in cuts,
which will result in fewer services to low-income, mentally ill
residents.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors produced a flurry of motions in last-ditch efforts to
save favored programs--the vast majority of which were voted down or
deferred.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had a pleasant day, thank you," joked Knabe after two of his
motions to increase funds for law enforcement were voted down by the
three Democrats on the five-member board.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors on Wednesday passed $14 million in new funding to
restore programs that had been cut in May.</TE>
<TE>   They included the probation department's work furlough program,
mental health services for the indigent, and an embalming program at
the coroner's office to address a problem of rats gnawing bodies.</TE>
<TE>   The additions barely moved the bottom line of a $16.4-billion
budget.</TE>
<TE>   "It's inappropriate," Supervisor Gloria Molina said as she voted
down one of the many proposals, pointing out that the same group had
just hours earlier voted to close 11 health clinics.</TE>
<TE>   "Have you ever heard the song: 'Hey, hey big spender'?" she said.</TE>
<TE>   The budget does not address the almost certain loss of money when
the state's budget is approved.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Administrative Officer David Janssen said the county stands
to lose between $140 million and $300 million in state funds.</TE>
<TE>   Camp Rockey, one of a number of detention facilities for juvenile
offenders, was one of the popular programs targeted for cuts in May
but was saved through the identification of more funds.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Mike Antonovich made a last-ditch effort to save some
programs but was voted down.</TE>
<TE>   Among those were the district attorney's environment crimes and
sex crimes units.</TE>

<HD>Daniel Case III, 44; Fueled Wall Street Internet Boom</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Daniel H. Case III, chairman of JP Morgan Chase's JPMorgan H&amp;Q
division, who played a pivotal role in Wall Street's fascination with
young Internet companies in the late 1990s, died Wednesday in San
Francisco after a yearlong battle with brain cancer. He was 44.</LD>
<LD>   Case spent more than 20 years in investment banking, mostly at
Hambrecht &amp; Quist, which was legendary for financing companies in
high-tech and biotechnology, including Apple Computer Inc., Genentech
Inc. and Netscape Communications, which was later acquired by America
Online.</LD>
<LD>   Hambrecht &amp; Quist was taken over by Chase in 1999 and became Chase
H&amp;Q. Chase merged with JPMorgan a year later.</LD>
<TE>   In his roles as chief executive and later chairman of H&amp;Q, Case
became one of the most influential bankers during the bull market of
the last decade. His work taking many Silicon Valley companies public
helped establish the West Coast as an important banking center and
forced many blueblood New York investment banks to closely look at
investment opportunities in and around California.</TE>
<TE>   As Case enjoyed a rising profile from his own work, his younger
brother, America Online founder Steve Case, came into the spotlight.
The two became symbols of the youth-driven Internet boom.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Case stepped down from his day-to-day responsibilities at
JPMorgan H&amp;Q about a year ago, after he was diagnosed with brain
cancer. Steve Case, now chairman of AOL Time Warner Inc., also
withdrew from the spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   "Like everything else he did in his life, Dan gave this battle
against brain cancer everything he had," Steve Case said in a
statement Wednesday. "He fought for a cure, knowing that he might not
live to see it but with a determination to make a difference in the
search."</TE>
<TE>   A native of Hawaii, Case joined Hambrecht &amp; Quist in 1979 after
company co-founder William Hambrecht asked faculty at Princeton
University to recommend the school's "smartest student" for a summer
internship, according to a JPMorgan statement.</TE>
<TE>   A Rhodes scholar with a bachelor's degree in economics and public
policy from Princeton, Case worked his way through the firm's
corporate finance, venture capital, and mergers and acquisitions
departments before becoming co-chief executive in 1992 and sole chief
executive in 1994. He was named chairman in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Stacey Black Case; four children,
Alexander, Winston, John Daniel and Charlotte; his parents, Dan and
Carol; brothers, Steve and Jeff; and sister, Carin.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral services will be held at Grace Cathedral in San Francisco
on Tuesday at 3:30 p.m. The family has asked that any gifts in his
honor be made to ABC2 (www.abc2.org) so that his dream of finding a
cure for brain cancer can be fulfilled.</TE>

<HD>Court Rejects San Diego Ploy in Cross Dispute</HD>
<DH>Law: City sold site of the war memorial to a private group
that promised to maintain it. Appellate judges rule that the move was
unconstitutional.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court Wednesday rejected a strategy used by San
Diego city officials to maintain a cross on public property atop Mt.
Soledad overlooking La Jolla.</LD>
<LD>   The city had arranged for the property to be sold to a nonprofit
corporation dedicated to keeping the cross. But the U.S. 9th Circuit
Court of Appeals, by a 7-4 vote, said the sale was unconstitutional
because, in effect, it was rigged to exclude groups that might want
to tear down the cross.</LD>
<LD>   The 43-foot-tall cross, a memorial to the city's war dead, enjoys
enormous public support. But the ACLU has waged a decade-long court
fight against the cross on the grounds that it violates the
constitutional separation of church and state.</LD>
<TE>   "It is past time for the city to quit evading its constitutional
duty and end its entanglement with the Soledad cross," said ACLU
legal director Jordan Budd.</TE>
<TE>   Far from quitting the fight, City Atty. Casey Gwinn said he will
advise the council about a possible appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the same court that apparently found the Pledge of
Allegiance unconstitutional," Gwinn said.</TE>
<TE>   "This [the cross] case has been going on for 13 years," Gwinn
said. "It's not likely to end any time soon."</TE>
<TE>   In 1991 U.S. District Judge Gordon Thompson Jr. ruled that it was
unconstitutional for the city to maintain a cross in a publicly owned
park, even as a war memorial.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Thompson upheld the city's sale of the land to the Mt.
Soledad Memorial Assn., a group formed by American Legion Post 275 in
La Jolla in the 1950s to build and maintain the cross for the city.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson's decision was upheld last year by a three-judge panel of
the 9th Circuit. Wednesday's ruling overturns that decision.</TE>
<TE>   To satisfy Thompson's 1990 ruling, the city arranged an auction of
the property.</TE>
<TE>   But the rules of the auction required buyers to promise to
maintain the site as a war memorial.</TE>
<TE>   "The city thereby granted a direct, immediate and substantial
benefit in aid of a Christian message," the court ruled.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Neil, a retired Marine Corps general and San Diego
attorney, urged the council to appeal to the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is an outrage that a minority group such as atheists
would attempt to assert the tyranny of the minority over the
majority," Neil said.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be a slap in the face to veterans everywhere to tear
down a cross that has come to symbolize the sacrifice of veterans for
our country," Neil said.</TE>
<TE>   Though they may squabble about innumerable issues, successive city
councils have been united in their support of the cross, which was
built in 1952 at a site that makes it one of the city's most visible
monuments.</TE>
<TE>   But San Diego attorney James McElroy, who served as co-counsel for
the ACLU action, said the constitutional issues should not be decided
by popular sentiment. The case was brought on behalf of Vietnam
veteran Philip Paulson, an atheist.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm old enough to remember when standing for integration in the
South wasn't very popular," McElroy said. "Sometimes doing the right
thing is not very popular."</TE>

<HD>Homaira Shah, 84; Former Afghan Queen</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Homaira Shah, the former queen of Afghanistan and wife of ex-monarch
Mohammad Zaher Shah, died Wednesday in Rome. She was 84.</LD>
<LD>   Shah suffered a heart attack after having been hospitalized this
week with a fever, said her granddaughter, Homaira Wali.</LD>
<LD>   Shah, who had lived with her husband in Rome since he was ousted
from power in 1973, didn't follow the king on his historic return to
Afghanistan in April because of her deteriorating health.</LD>
<TE>   She had, however, planned to return, Wali said.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the family are trying to take her body back to Kabul
for burial. They hope to do so in the next three to four days, Wali
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to get her back as soon as possible," Wali said,
adding that her grandmother would be buried in the royal tomb on a
hill overlooking the capital.</TE>
<TE>   The bullet-scarred tomb was one of the first places Zaher Shah
visited after he returned to Kabul on April 18, ending a 29-year
exile.</TE>
<TE>   He was married to his cousin, Princess Homaira, daughter of Sardar
Ahem Shah, on Nov. 4, 1931.</TE>
<TE>   Zaher Shah and his family moved to Rome after a 1973 coup by his
cousin ended his 40-year reign.</TE>
<TE>   The family lived in a comfortable home in a gated community
outside Rome, surrounded by relatives and a small core of
advisors--many of whom recently followed the ex-monarch back to
Kabul.</TE>

<HD>A Court on 'Left Coast' of Legal Map</HD>

<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The San Francisco-based U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals is the last
bastion of old-fashioned liberal activism in the federal system, a
place where judges are not afraid to push the margins of the law.</LD>
<LD>   Its judges declared that dying patients have a right to
doctor-assisted suicide, and they have repeatedly stood in the way of
state officials trying to carry out the death penalty.</LD>
<LD>   In 1992, the justices of the Supreme Court were kept up all night
as they reversed four successive stays from the 9th Circuit that for
a time had halted the execution of San Diego murderer Robert Alton
Harris.</LD>
<TE>   Wednesday's ruling striking down the Pledge of Allegiance may be
seen by many--including several of those justices--as further
evidence that the 9th Circuit represents the "Left Coast."</TE>
<TE>   No regional court has its decisions reversed as often as the 9th
Circuit. In 1997, the high court took up 29 cases from the 9th
Circuit and reversed 28 of them. Nearly two-thirds of those reversals
were unanimous.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the justices have reversed 12 of 16 rulings in cases
that came from the 9th Circuit.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, legal experts were quick to predict the
three-judge panel's ruling in the pledge case will be reversed.</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely expect the Supreme Court will reverse this, if the
full [9th Circuit] court doesn't do it first," said Catholic
University Law Dean Douglas Kmiec.</TE>
<TE>   But he said it was a mistake to portray the 9th Circuit or
Wednesday's ruling as extreme.</TE>
<TE>   "To paint this as a wild-eyed opinion is wrong. If you take
seriously what the Supreme Court has said on this subject, you could
plausibly come to this conclusion," said UC Berkeley law professor
Jesse Choper, an expert on the Supreme Court and church-state law.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court has not taken up challenges to mottoes or
references to God, such as the phrase "In God We Trust" on coins.
However, it has intervened when schoolchildren were given a message
about religion.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the author of many key church-state
rulings, has said the Constitution does not permit government to take
actions that appear to "endorse" religion.</TE>
<TE>   For example, O'Connor and her colleagues struck down an Alabama
law that called for a daily moment of silence in the public schools
because, she said, it was intended as a state endorsement of prayer.</TE>
<TE>   Later, the court rejected a Texas school board's policy allowing
student-led prayers at football games.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's ruling cites those cases and O'Connor's words. The
court's opinion by Judge Alfred T. Goodwin, who was appointed to the
court by President Richard Nixon, also relies heavily on one of the
most remarkable decisions in the Supreme Court's history.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, the justices were asked to reconsider the
state laws that required schoolchildren to salute the flag and recite
the Pledge of Allegiance. (In those days, the pledge did not include
the phrase "under God," which was added in 1954 during the Cold War.)</TE>
<TE>   Parents in West Virginia who were Jehovah's Witnesses challenged
the pledge as violating their rights to freedom of speech and freedom
of religion. On a 6-3 vote, the Supreme Court agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation,
it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be
orthodox in politics, nationalism [or] religion ... or force citizens
to confess by word or act of faith therein," Justice Robert H.
Jackson wrote in West Virginia vs. Barnette, which was issued on Flag
Day in 1943.</TE>
<TE>   These days, legal experts say the West Virginia ruling stands for
the principle that children cannot be compelled to salute the flag or
say the Pledge of Allegiance.</TE>
<TE>   Parents can ask that their children be exempted.</TE>
<TE>   Law professors say the 9th Circuit erred by taking the next step
and ruling that the pledge itself is unconstitutional because of the
reference to God.</TE>
<TE>   "But they are inclined to be on the cutting edge and to push the
margin," Kmiec said.</TE>

<HD>Duke of Norfolk, 86; Senior English Nobleman</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>The 17th Duke of Norfolk, England's most senior nobleman, has died.
He was 86.</LD>
<LD>   Staff at Arundel Castle, his family seat in southern England, said
that the duke died Monday in his sleep at his home in
Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, west of London and that his wife was
with him. No cause of death was given.</LD>
<LD>   On the death of his cousin in 1975, Miles Francis Stapleton Fitz-</LD>
<TE>   alan-Howard succeeded to England's oldest dukedom, created in 1483
by King Richard III for John Howard, his loyal supporter in the Wars
of the Roses.</TE>
<TE>   The dukes of Norfolk are referred to as the premier dukes--the
highest rank of peers--because their title is the oldest.</TE>
<TE>   The Howards have been one of England's most prominent families for
500 years. They kept their Roman Catholic faith despite King Henry
VIII's break with the Roman Catholic Church in the 16th century.</TE>
<TE>   Like his predecessors, the 17th duke was earl marshal of England,
one of the Great Officers of State, who are senior members of the
royal household.</TE>
<TE>   The 17th duke was educated at Oxford University. He served in the
army for 30 years and retired as a major general.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, he served in France, North Africa, Sicily and
Italy and was awarded the Military Cross for reconnaissance of mined
roads on foot under enemy fire.</TE>
<TE>   He remarked in later years that "anyone can be Duke of Norfolk,
but I'm rather proud of that medal," the Times of London said in its
obituary.</TE>
<TE>   The duke and his wife of more than 50 years, the former Anne
Constable-Maxwell, had two sons and three daughters, including
actress Marsha Fitzalan.</TE>
<TE>   His elder son, Edward, the Earl of Arundel, succeeds him.</TE>

<CX>   Duke of Norfolk obituary--A June 27 obituary of the 17th duke of
Norfolk incorrectly stated that the Howard family, to which the duke
belonged, had kept its Catholic faith despite King Henry VIII's break
with the Roman Catholic Church. In fact, several of the duke's
predecessors were Protestants. The obituary also did not give a full
history of the creation of the dukedom. Although the first duke of
Norfolk in the Howard family was designated in 1483 by King Richard
III, as the Associated Press story reported, a previous duke of
Norfolk had been created in 1397 by King Richard II, who banished him
in 1398.</CX>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Lionel "Rusty" Bernstein, 82, a white anti-apartheid activist who
stood trial for sabotage along with former South African President
Nelson Mandela, died Sunday in Oxford, England, of a heart attack.</LD>
<LD>   The onetime head of South Africa's Communist Party, Bernstein was
one of 16 activists, including Mandela, who were charged in 1963 with
sabotage and the attempted overthrow of the South African government.
The accused in what came to be known as the Rivonia Trial used the
courtroom to put the apartheid nation on trial.</LD>
<LD>   Bernstein spent a year of the trial in prison and was later
acquitted. The other defendants were sentenced to life or lengthy
prison terms.</LD>
<TE>   An architect by profession, Bernstein eventually distanced himself
from the Communist Party and moved with his family to England after
learning that South African security police planned to arrest his
wife.</TE>
<TE>   His story was later told in the book "Rivonia's Children: Three
Families and the Cost of Conscience in White South Africa."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>George Paterno, 73, a longtime Penn State football broadcaster and
brother of coach Joe Paterno, died Tuesday at a hospital in State
College, Pa., of complications from a heart attack. He was 73.</LD>
<LD>   Paterno spent 24 years broadcasting Penn State football games as
an analyst on radio and television from 1976 through the 1999 season.</LD>
<LD>   He was born and raised in Brooklyn, N.Y., and began his football

Kings Point, N.Y., in 1965.</TE>
<TE>   He led the team to a 46-32-3 record in 1965-68 and 1971-75. He
spent 1969-70 as a defensive coordinator at Michigan State.</TE>

<HD>Derrek Dickey, 51; NBA Player, Broadcaster Still Holds

<DL></DL>
<LD>Derrek Dickey, 51, a member of the Golden State Warriors championship
team in 1975 who later broadcast National Basketball Assn. games for
the Chicago Bulls and the Sacramento Kings, died Tuesday at his home
near Sacramento.</LD>
<LD>   The cause was apparently a heart attack.</LD>
<LD>   Dickey, a 6-foot-7, 220-pound forward, played five seasons in the
NBA, helping the Warriors sweep the Washington Bullets for the 1975
league championship. Dickey set an NBA finals record that still
stands, shooting 73.9% from the field. He ended his playing career
with the Bulls in 1978.</LD>
<TE>   A three-year letterman at the University of Cincinnati, Dickey led
the team in scoring in 1971, averaging 17.9 points per game, and was
the team's most valuable player in 1972.</TE>
<TE>   After his NBA career, Dickey did some broadcasting work for the
University of Cincinnati. He then spent three seasons with the Kings
as a color commentator.</TE>
<TE>   While working as a radio analyst for the Bulls in 1997, he
suffered a stroke that left him with limited use of his left side.
However, he later returned to the broadcasting booth for the Bulls.</TE>

<DL>THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE</DL>
<LD>They might as well have burned the flag--or at least stomped on it.</LD>
<LD>   Wednesday's decision essentially barring that age-old American
tradition, the Pledge of Allegiance, from the public classroom came
less than a year after the Sept. 11 attacks and just in time for the
Fourth of July.</LD>
<LD>   Predictably, there were fireworks.</LD>
<TE>   "This decision is ... just nuts," said U.S. Senate Majority Leader
Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), who fired a return salvo by asking all senators
to be present this morning to recite the pledge en masse. Within
hours, U.S. senators had voted 99 to 0 to pass a resolution calling
for the ruling to be overturned.</TE>
<TE>   The House of Representatives reacted just as strongly. About 100
members joined in a bipartisan condemnation of the ruling by
gathering Wednesday afternoon on the Capitol steps to recite the
pledge and to sing "God Bless America."</TE>
<TE>   The House is expected to adopt its own resolution today.</TE>
<TE>   The backlash reached from the highest seats of power--President
Bush branded the ruling "ridiculous"--to the sleepy country lanes of
middle America.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Blake, a 71-year-old Korean War vet living in Indiantown,
Fla., bristled along with everyone else when the topic echoed through
the local Veterans of Foreign Wars Hall. "I think it is disgraceful
that they would think of doing something like this," Blake said.</TE>
<TE>   The national VFW organization, based in Kansas City, Mo., called
the decision "an unconscionable act by our court system, especially
when patriotism is renewing the spirit of our nation."</TE>
<TE>   The court's very different opinion, expressed in a 31-page ruling,
clearly showed more feel for technicalities of the law than for the
mood of the nation. With flags still flying from car antennas, with
families of terrorism victims still grieving, with U.S. forces still
conducting a global search for Osama bin Laden, federal circuit
judges voted 2 to 1 to declare teacher-led recitations of the
pledge--which have been a rite of schoolchildren for
decades--unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   The judges found that the phrase "under God" is an endorsement of
religion that violates the constitutionally mandated separation of
church and state.</TE>
<TE>   "What's next?" asked Richard Land, president of the Southern
Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, who
criticized the ruling as "absurd." He said he fears that the decision
jeopardizes the national motto, "In God We Trust," and lines from the
final verse of "The Star Spangled Banner."</TE>
<TE>   "If this doesn't outrage the citizenry of California," said Gil
Ferguson, a World War II veteran and former Orange County
assemblyman, "it's obvious that nothing ever is going to outrage the
people. I would tell the school boards not to pay any attention to
the ruling."</TE>
<TE>   The National Republican Congressional Committee quickly
recommended the same.</TE>
<TE>   "The Pledge of Allegiance is a reflection of the values of America
and has been an important patriotic tradition for more than a
century," said Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry
McAuliffe. "I trust that the judicial process will ultimately
overturn this wrongheaded decision."</TE>
<TE>   The last time a federal court decision on a patriotic symbol
caused such an outpouring of criticism was in 1989, when the Supreme
Court ruled it legal for citizens to burn the flag as a form of
political protest.</TE>
<TE>   Passions were such Wednesday that it was difficult to find
supporters of the 9th Circuit's stance.</TE>
<TE>   Margie Ghiz, owner of the Midnight Special bookstore in Santa
Monica, was one member of that minority.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea of pledging the allegiance or waving the flag [has]
nothing to do with patriotism," she said. "Real patriotism, and real
love for your country, is expressed in so many different ways--like
dissent, or people fighting against the closure of hospitals."</TE>
<TE>   Some religious leaders supported the court's ruling. The Rev.
Masao Kodani of the Senshin Buddhist Temple in Los Angeles said
Buddhists do not believe in God, and many view the concept of a
supreme creator as a cause of suffering. Kodani said he instructs
children in his temple's dharma classes to recite the pledge in
school but to remain silent during the mention of God.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Curry, the Roman Catholic auxiliary bishop of Santa
Barbara, said that he had not yet seen the ruling but that he
generally favors strict bans against government promotion of
religion.</TE>
<TE>   "Religion is something propagated by a free people and the grace
of God, not by government," said Curry, author of "Farewell to
Christendom," a book on church-state issues published last year.</TE>
<TE>   Curry said the key question was whether the pledge's single
reference to God really amounted to government promotion of religion
and actually oppressed anyone, or was simply an expression of the
nation's traditions.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's ruling was the stuff talk radio dreams are made of.
With a "this-just-in" quality about an issue like prayer in school,
the airwaves were crackling.</TE>
<TE>   Fans of "The John and Ken Show" on L.A.'s KFI-AM (640), were
queued up on the switchboard well before the program went on the air
at 3 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   At KFI's competition, KABC-AM (790), callers registered exactly
the kind of emotion that the station likes to tap into: outrage.
Larry Elder, host of "The Larry Elder Show," dedicated all three
hours to the story.</TE>
<TE>   Bush learned of the ruling while attending a G-8 Summit in
Calgary, Canada. He diverted attention from pressing global issues to
lambaste the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "The Supreme Court itself begins each of its sessions with the
phrase, 'God save the United States and this honorable court,' " said
presidential Press Secretary Ari Fleischer. "The Declaration of
Independence refers to God or to the creator four different times.
Congress begins each session with a prayer. And of course, our
currency says, 'In God We Trust.' "</TE>
<TE>   California Gov. Gray Davis said he was "extremely disappointed."
He called the Pledge of Allegiance "one of our most profound human
expressions of American patriotism."</TE>
<TE>   The ruling provoked some California-bashing from conservative
Republicans who see the 9th Circuit as a bastion of left-wing
thinking.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, the liberal court in San Francisco has gotten this one
wrong," said House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.). "It's time for
the Senate to move forward and confirm some common-sense jurists."</TE>
<TE>   Even some noted California liberals railed against the court's
action.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a flawed decision," said Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown, who, as
California governor, sparked his share of public controversies. "For
over 200 years, references to God have been ... part of the national
life of the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) pointed out that one of the
judges who supported the ruling was appointed by a Republican
president. But Feinstein joined in the denunciations:</TE>
<TE>   "I can only say, this senator is embarrassed."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer David Ferrell contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Panel Endorses 2 Businessmen as UC Regents</HD>
<DH>Politics: Senate expected to confirm Haim Saban and Richard
Blum, who are big donors to Democrats. Both favor greater ethnic
diversity at the university.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Haim Saban and Richard C. Blum, both wealthy businessmen and generous
campaign contributors to Democrats, won the endorsement of a key
committee Wednesday in their quest to become University of California
regents.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate Rules Committee, which considers nominations for those
posts, approved their appointments by 4-0 votes, clearing the way for
Gov. Gray Davis' picks to face a full vote in the Senate, where
confirmation is expected.</LD>
<LD>   Representatives of some minority rights organizations complained
that Davis, like other governors before him, stacked the board with
white, male campaign donors.</LD>
<TE>   However, in testimony to the Democrat-controlled Senate Rules
Committee, the witnesses said they backed the appointments of Saban
and Blum because each voiced support for bringing greater diversity
to the 160,000-student university.</TE>
<TE>   On unanimous votes, the committee recommended that businessman
Blum, husband of U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, and Saban, an
entertainment tycoon, investor and philanthropist, be approved by the
full Senate for confirmation to 12-year terms. They are expected to
be confirmed easily.</TE>
<TE>   Saban is one of the marketers of the "Mighty Morphin Power
Rangers." In February, he gave the Democratic National Committee a
record $7-million donation. He regularly hosts Davis at dinners at
his home and is among the governor's biggest donors.</TE>
<TE>   Saban and his entertainment enterprises--Saban Entertainment and
the since-sold Fox Family Worldwide--have given $467,869 to Davis
since 1999, including $50,000 in May. Blum gave $50,600 to Davis in
2000 while companies associated with him contributed another $65,000.</TE>
<TE>   Both men told the Rules Committee that they opposed a proposed
ballot initiative by activist Ward Connerly that would prohibit UC
and other governmental entities from collecting ethnic, racial and
other data.</TE>
<TE>   Blum and Saban said they favored greater economic, ethnic and
social diversity at the university and said they would oppose raising
student fees as a means of easing the current state budget gap.</TE>
<TE>   The typical UC undergrad student now pays about $4,000 a year, a
UC spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Blum said that if student fees were to be increased, he would
favor boosting the higher fees paid by out-of-state students but
would oppose raising fees paid by California residents.</TE>
<TE>   Saban told the committee he favors creating a sliding scale of
fees, in which the fee level would reflect the student's economic
status. He said sliding-scale fees would make it easier for
low-income and minority students to attend, but would not discourage
wealthier students from enrolling in the state's universities.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Democratic and Republican governors have been accused
of rewarding their favorite campaign contributors with seats on the
Board of Regents. Davis and his predecessor, Pete Wilson, have denied
those accusations and said they chose nominees capable of overseeing
the prestigious system.</TE>
<TE>   John Gamboa of the Greenlining Institute in the Bay Area said Blum
and Saban fit the notion that governors reward their white, wealthy
male supporters with appointments to the Board of Regents.</TE>
<TE>   "We have an appearance in this state that government is for sale,"
said Gamboa, who spoke before the committee.</TE>
<TE>   Another witness, Leo Avila, representing the American GI Forum,
echoed the assertion that appointments to government offices in
California "appear to be for sale. That bothers me."</TE>
<TE>   He said this diminishes the political power of minority groups
because people of color cannot match the big contributions of wealthy
white people. Those and other speakers, however, said their
criticisms were directed at Davis, not the nominees.</TE>
<TE>   "I share your concern," Senate leader John L. Burton (D-San
Francisco), told the witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Burton, who chairs the committee and who often criticizes fellow
Democrat Davis, said Rules Committee members are "aware of the lack
of diversity" in the appointment of regents by Davis. He accused the
governor of "some dereliction ... in not getting more diversity" in
his appointments to the UC board.</TE>

<HD>Southland Educators Assail U.S. Ruling</HD>
<DH>Schools: Many view court's decision on Pledge of Allegiance
as a blow to patriotism. The campus ritual, they say, will continue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIKA HAYASAKI , JENIFER RAGLAND and DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a federal court declared recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance
in public schools unconstitutional Wednesday, many Southern
California educators called the ruling a blow to patriotism and
insisted it will not stop their classroom ritual--complete with the
controversial phrase "under God."</LD>
<LD>   "I feel like a deflated balloon. They just let out my pride," said
Joseph Santana, a Vietnam War veteran and principal of John Adams
Middle School in South Los Angeles. "What do we have left if we
cannot have respect for our country and demonstrate it outwardly?"</LD>
<LD>   Santana said he would obey the decision if upheld, but not without
protest.</LD>
<TE>   Attorneys and officials at school districts in Los Angeles, Orange
and Ventura counties said Santana need not worry, because they expect
the ruling to be quickly put on hold for an appeal, and probably
overturned.</TE>
<TE>   Harold Kwalwasser, general counsel for the Los Angeles Unified
School District, said there is "some credibility to the court's
argument" that the pledge's reference to God unconstitutionally mixes
church and state. But he said that he expects the decision to be
reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court and that his district will hold
off on changing any policies for now.</TE>
<TE>   Reciting the pledge, however, is voluntary for California students
and is usually conducted at the start of the day in elementary and
middle schools, led by teachers or students in honorary rotations
facing flags hanging from classroom walls or held by hand.</TE>
<TE>   As they have for generations, student pledgers stand, cover their
hearts with their right hands and struggle over the word
"indivisible."</TE>
<TE>   Some high schools pledge only at assemblies or sports events,
while others broadcast the pledge during every homeroom period over
sometimes-crackling public address systems. Not all high school
students pay attention, but teachers say they are at least not
disruptive during the patriotic minute.</TE>
<TE>   Even if participation is voluntary, a majority of the panel of the
9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said, the phrase "under God"
conveys a sense of state endorsement of religious belief to
impressionable youngsters when led by teachers. Aaron Stell, a
teacher at Grant High School in Van Nuys, where the pledge is said
during every homeroom period, said he welcomed the ruling because he
was skeptical of displays of nationalism.</TE>
<TE>   "It shouldn't be forced on students," he said, saying he tells his
students they should feel free to abstain. Stell said about
two-thirds of his class take part in the pledge.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Supt. of Schools Charles Weis said the ruling makes
perfect sense in this multicultural society. He said he hopes the
pledge can be retained and frequently recited without the reference
to God.</TE>
<TE>   That way, he said, the pledge would enable "everyone to
demonstrate their patriotism, regardless of their religious beliefs."</TE>
<TE>   But reactions of sadness, anger or confusion were more common.</TE>
<TE>   Butool Abdullah, 13, a Muslim student who attends Etiwanda High
School in Rancho Cucamonga, said she recites the pledge every day and
has never been offended by the reference to God, even if it was
written without Islam in mind.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in God, so one God works for me," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Francisco Lopez, 16, a freshman at Monroe who was born in Mexico
and has limited English skills, said the Pledge of Allegiance has
helped him learn the language and give thanks to his new home.</TE>
<TE>   "This country opened its arms to me and my family," Lopez said,
"and every time I say it, I am saying, 'Thank you.' "</TE>
<TE>   At Francis Polytechnic High School in Sun Valley, Principal
Christine Clark said she was appalled by the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "In this day and age, when patriotism is something that we're all
holding on to so dearly, to have one of the symbols of patriotism
called unconstitutional ... it's amazing to me," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd Houske, principal of Cahuenga Elementary School in
Koreatown, said most students at the school come from intensely
religious Korean and Central American immigrant families.</TE>
<TE>   So to them, he said, it makes no sense to ban the word "God."</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many different names for God," Houske said.</TE>
<TE>   "It just seems to me that in our desire to protect the rights of
everybody, sometimes that ends up not being the best thing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Most school administrators and school board members said they will
ignore the court's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to continue to recite the pledge as we know it
today," said Al Mijares, superintendent of the Santa Ana Unified
School District. "If we get some edict that completely prohibits us
from saying it, I'll have to evaluate it."</TE>
<TE>   Harald Martin, a trustee with the Anaheim Union High School
District, said he would not support discontinuing the pledge.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes people do foolish things, and that doesn't preclude
jurists."</TE>

<HD>Deal Is Engineered to Fund Amtrak</HD>
<DH>Railroad: White House agrees to an immediate $100 million
to keep the trains running, for now.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR and KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Amtrak won a reprieve late Wednesday as the Bush administration
agreed to a bailout that will keep trains rolling into the fall and
allow for a fuller debate over the troubled rail system's future.</LD>
<LD>   Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta and Amtrak chairman John
Robert Smith issued a joint statement saying they had reached an
agreement in principle "aimed at resolving the short-term financial
crisis facing the railroad."</LD>
<LD>   David Gunn, Amtrak's new president, threatened to start shutting
down the system over the July 4 holiday because it was quickly
running out of cash. That would have forced thousands of people to
seek alternate means of transportation, and also would have paralyzed
critical commuter rail lines on both coasts that rely on Amtrak
support services to operate.</LD>
<TE>   "We are confident that, with congressional support, Amtrak
services will not be disrupted," the joint statement read.</TE>
<TE>   In California, the agreement came as a relief to officials worried
about the potential closing of commuter systems, such as Los Angeles'
Metrolink, as well as the loss of seven Amtrak lines that course
through the state.</TE>
<TE>   "Our big concern is [whether] this is going to happen again and
what we can do to guard against it," Metrolink spokeswoman Sharon
Gavin said. In Congress, a group of House Republicans introduced
legislation Wednesday aimed at keeping commuter lines running in the
event of an Amtrak shutdown.</TE>
<TE>   Details were scant, with Mineta and Smith saying that no final
agreement has yet been signed.</TE>
<TE>   However, sources familiar with negotiations said the government
would make an immediate $100-million loan to Amtrak and provide as
much as $170 million more in cash or loan backing, subject to
conditions that include an accounting of assets and finances, monthly
financial reports and a possible wage freeze. The statement said
Amtrak's financial condition and operating performance must be made
"transparent to the public."</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak lost more than $1 billion last year and was more than $4
billion in debt after mortgaging its most valuable assets. Achieving
profitability--a goal Congress previously set--now seems out of
reach.</TE>
<TE>   Mineta said Wednesday his goal was to buy time for a reasoned
discussion of Amtrak's prospects and that he would not seek deep cuts
as part of the temporary bailout. "Amtrak must continue to search for
ways to cut their own expenses," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said some in the administration would have been unfazed
at letting Amtrak slip into bankruptcy. But the potential disruptions
were politically unacceptable to President Bush. A shutdown would
have snarled the Northeast Corridor between Washington and Boston,
which carries more than half of Amtrak's 64,000 daily riders, and
hundreds of thousands of commuter rail passengers. So Bush authorized
Mineta to extend more subsidies to a rail system that Republicans
have railed against for years.</TE>
<TE>   The administration is proposing sweeping long-term reforms for
Amtrak that would break it up into smaller units, open up choice
routes to private competition and involve states in providing
financing. Since its creation in 1970, Amtrak has not had a
profitable year. It is saddled with unprofitable routes and a
deteriorating infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   The prospect of a shutdown has galvanized Amtrak supporters in
Congress. Powerful Democratic senators have proposed $205 million in
emergency aid as part of a supplemental government funding bill that
is pending.</TE>
<TE>   The second part of the administration's bailout package--as much
as $170 million in cash or financing--requires congressional
approval. It was unclear Wednesday how the administration's aid would
be reconciled with the proposal advanced by Senate Democrats. Aides
to Mineta said they would brief key lawmakers today.</TE>
<TE>   Maintaining Amtrak, even in a pared form, will almost certainly
require billions of dollars in continuing government subsidies. The
railroad has asked for $1.2 billion in the coming fiscal year; the
Bush White House has offered half that.</TE>
<TE>   "The politics relating to Amtrak have been flatly dishonest for
years," said rail historian William L. Withuhn, transportation
curator at the Smithsonian Institution. "No long-distance passenger
rail system makes money on a fully amortized basis, including capital
costs.</TE>
<TE>   "The politics and the economics are so confusingly linked that no
one can make any sense of either.</TE>
<TE>   "We need, not the advocates," Withuhn said, "but someone to be
able to say with a straight face, these are the real numbers and this
is what has to be done."</TE>
<TE>   Alonso-Zaldivar reported from Washington and Streeter from Los
Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Rising Costs Pricing Millions Out of College, Committee
Says</HD>
<DH>Education: Estimates are that more than 4 million qualified
graduates this decade won't be able to go to four-year schools.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART SILVERSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Limited scholarship funds and rising tuition costs have created
financial hardships that will prevent more than 4 million qualified
high school graduates this decade from attending four-year colleges,
a federal advisory group asserted Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance released a
report that shows the burden of college costs will fall hardest on
students from families with incomes of less than $50,000 a year.</LD>
<LD>   Juliet V. Garcia, the committee's chairwoman and president of the
University of Texas at Brownsville, said that financial barriers are
forcing students from low- and moderate-income families to take on
excessive debt or work excessive hours to attend college full time.
Speaking at a Washington news conference, she blamed the problem on
"a severe shortage" of scholarship money for needy students. "Without
increases in grant aid, these trends are irreversible," she said.</LD>
<TE>   Garcia said the report rebutted the argument made by some
education experts that the biggest barrier preventing low- and
moderate-income students from attending college is not money, but the
poor educational preparation they receive before reaching college
age.</TE>
<TE>   The report was seized upon as political ammunition by student aid
advocates to call on the Bush administration to increase such
assistance as federal Pell Grants.</TE>
<TE>   Titled "Empty Promises," the report focused on students who have
taken college preparatory courses and maintained grade averages of B
minus or better. Among students meeting those qualifications from
low-income families--defined as families with incomes of less than
$25,000 a year--48% don't go to four-year schools, it said. In
addition, 22% of these students don't pursue any secondary education:
four-year schools, community colleges or trade schools.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the report said only 16% of such students from
families with incomes exceeding $75,000 don't go to a four-year
school; 4% fail to attend any college.</TE>
<TE>   A report released last fall found that the annual cost of tuition
and room and board nationally averaged $9,008 at four-year public
universities and $23,578 at private four-year schools.</TE>
<TE>   Terry W. Hartle, senior vice president of the American Council on
Education, an umbrella organization representing public and private
colleges, said the report documents "how far we have to go in the
United States to make sure all Americans have equal access to
post-secondary education."</TE>
<TE>   "The participation gap between low- and upper-income students is
the same as 35 years ago," Hartle added. "Smart poor kids go to
college at the same rate as stupid rich kids, and that's a tragedy."</TE>
<TE>   The advisory committee, which advises Congress and the U.S.
Department of Education, concluded that 406,000 qualified high school
graduates from families with incomes below $50,000 did not attend
four-year schools this year. Of those students, 168,000 didn't attend
community colleges or trade schools either. The committee blamed
financial barriers for all of those cases of students not attending
college.</TE>
<TE>   By 2010, the committee said, the number of qualified students from
families with incomes below $50,000 who won't attend four-year
colleges within two years of graduating high school will be 4.4
million. It calculated that the number who won't seek any
post-secondary education will total 2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia said the affordability problem will be aggravated by the
current wave of tuition increases at public schools across the
country in states struggling with budget crises. California's college
systems have said they don't plan increases in attendance fees next
year for state residents, but lawmakers have started to raise the
possibility of hikes.</TE>
<TE>   The only solution the report provided was a call for federal and
state governments, along with individual colleges, to provide more
grants for students from low- and moderate-income families.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The government put temporary flight restrictions around three

fear of possible attacks during the Fourth of July holiday.</LD>
<LD>   The ban prohibits planes from flying around the Statue of Liberty,
Mt. Rushmore National Memorial in South Dakota and the Gateway Arch
in St. Louis near the July 4 holiday, the Federal Aviation
Administration said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The "no-fly zone" around the Statue of Liberty was put in place
Tuesday and bars flights within one nautical mile--about 1.15
miles--of the monument until September, Federal Aviation
Administration spokesman William Shumann said.</LD>
<TE>   The FAA prohibited all flights within four nautical miles around
Mt. Rushmore and within three nautical miles of the Gateway Arch from
July 3 to July 5.</TE>
<TE>   "Large crowds of Americans are expected to attend these sites

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Many gambling Web sites lack adequate safeguards and
warnings to prevent children and teenagers from placing illegal bets,
federal regulators said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   In a survey of 100 popular Internet gambling sites, the Federal
Trade Commission found that one in five had no warnings for minors
and most had disclaimers that were hard to find. The sites also
lacked screening mechanisms to keep children out or had blocks that
kids could easily get around.</LD>
<LD>   "There is a growing problem with kids engaged in online gambling,"
FTC Chairman Timothy J. Muris said at a news conference. He said
minors gambling online may use their parents' credit cards, costing
them money and damaging their credit ratings.</LD>
<TE>   In a warning to parents, the FTC said that online gambling can be
addictive because "gambling in social isolation and using credit to
gamble may be risk factors for developing gambling problems."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Frank R. Wolf (R-Va.) asked the agency to investigate. He
says the Bush administration is not doing enough to protect children
from online gambling.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids are becoming addicted," Wolf said. "This Internet stuff
comes right into the family room."</TE>
<TE>   Muris said the FTC is continuing its research and plans to work
with the online gambling industry to develop voluntary steps to
protect children.</TE>
<TE>   Gambling is illegal for minors in every state, but the majority of
the gambling Web sites surveyed were based outside the United States,
the FTC said. The agency did not identify the sites.</TE>
<TE>   Wolf said the number of Internet gambling sites is growing and the
industry likely will take in $3 billion this year.</TE>

<HD>Immigrants Make Election-Year Gains With Lawmakers</HD>
<DH>Welfare: A push to reinstate benefits that had been
stripped in 1996 emerges in Congress, as politicians look to the
country's newest citizens for votes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A push to restore immigrants' benefits that Congress took away in
1996 has scored some notable recent victories, as politicians compete
for the loyalty of new American voters.</LD>
<LD>   Most recently, the Senate Finance Committee agreed Wednesday to
end a federal ban on welfare payments to many noncitizens. The ban
was enacted six years ago as one of the most controversial parts of
welfare reform.</LD>
<LD>   The panel also voted to reinstate Medicaid benefits for immigrant
children and pregnant women in states that choose to provide them.</LD>
<TE>   The moves come on top of last month's vote by Congress to end a
prohibition on food stamps for legal immigrants who have been here at
least five years, a reversal that close observers view as a watershed
in a long battle to reinstate federal aid for low-income immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   "The conventional wisdom was that these issues are difficult, that
it's heavy lifting," said Cecilia Munoz, a vice president of the
National Council of La Raza, a Latino civil rights group. "We got
clobbered in the mid-1990s. But the conventional wisdom has been
completely turned on its head."</TE>
<TE>   Balking at Restoration</TE>
<TE>   Restoring federal benefits to recent low-income immigrants remains
unpopular in some important circles. The welfare bill that passed the
Republican-controlled House in May did not include a reinstatement of
cash aid for immigrants, and the White House continues to oppose such
a change in welfare policy.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of benefits argue that immigrants are supposed to rely
on sponsors--or themselves--for financial survival, and that offering
them federal aid only undermines that principle. But the government
does not press sponsors to abide by their financial promises, a
reality that prompted congressional conservatives to push for the
immigrant prohibitions in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really a question of whether you want to say that the
sponsor's obligation has any meaning at all," said Robert Rector, a
senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation here.</TE>
<TE>   Despite some limited restorations of aid before this year, that
view has dominated the congressional debate, with substantial
restrictions of aid to immigrants for welfare, health care and food
stamps remaining in effect until this year. But recently, various
pressures have emboldened critics.</TE>
<TE>   The 2000 census documented that, of more than 13.3 million
immigrants who arrived in this country in the last decade, a growing
share settled outside such traditional enclaves as California, Texas,
Illinois and New York. That, analysts said, has changed the
politics--and the demands for public service--in many regions.</TE>
<TE>   After Immigrant Votes</TE>
<TE>   On the level of electoral survival, politicians increasingly are
courting immigrant voters and seeking to demonstrate sensitivity to
their concerns. President Bush provided an example of this when the
White House publicly advocated the restoration of food stamp benefits
for immigrants in this year's budget.</TE>
<TE>   "If Democrats don't watch out, Bush is going to eat their lunch,"
said Charles Cook, a Washington political analyst, speculating that
Democrats would feel growing pressure to demonstrate their own appeal
to immigrant voters. "You could conceivably see something of a
bidding war, with each side trying to reach out more and more," Cook
said.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Cook added that Republicans have their own
serious problems with groups such as Mexican Americans. "The
Republican Party cannot afford to get hammered by Hispanic voters the
way it has in the past," he said. "I think most Republicans are
grudgingly coming around to that view--that it's political suicide to
be seen as anti-Hispanic--and they're making efforts to reverse
course."</TE>
<TE>   A dramatic sign of the changing sentiment came April 23, when Rep.
Joe Baca (D-Rialto) offered an amendment instructing House
negotiators to accept a Senate provision that would broadly reinstate
food stamp benefits for immigrants as part of the farm bill. The
measure passed over the strong objection of House GOP leaders by a
vote of 244 to 171--with the help of 45 Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a gamble," said Josh Bernstein, senior policy analyst with
the National Immigration Law Center in Washington. "It's very rare
for this issue to come up directly for a vote."</TE>
<TE>   A survey of likely voters commissioned last month by the law
center also suggested that a large majority of the public supported
restoration of benefits for legal immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   "The politics of this has been escalating," La Raza's Munoz said,
noting that, in this election year, "there's much more awareness of
the dangers of refusing to cover these populations."</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, immigrant issues merged as a major focus of debate
inside the Senate Finance Committee, which was completing work on a
bill to extend the nation's welfare program for five years.</TE>
<TE>   Aid for Women, Kids</TE>
<TE>   His fellow Democrats backed the effort of Sen. Bob Graham of
Florida to give states the option of restoring heath-care coverage
for legal immigrant children and pregnant women at a projected cost
of more than $2.2 billion over 10 years. The proposal passed, 12 to
9, backed by 10 Democrats and two Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   Graham argued that the measure made sense in terms not only of
compassion but of practicality: "Right now, if states are not helping
these legal immigrants, they are using the most costly and least
effective method for health care--the emergency room at the county
hospital."</TE>
<TE>   The Finance Committee also agreed that the federal government
should pay for the cash payments and other welfare benefits of
immigrants in states that choose to offer such aid. Currently,
California and about 20 other states provide such benefits at their
own expense, but federal law prohibits Washington from reimbursing
them during an immigrant's first five years in this country.</TE>
<TE>   California, for example, paid $54 million in 2001 in welfare and
related costs to noncitizens who were not covered by the federal
government, according to the state Department of Social Services.</TE>
<TE>   The ban on immigrant benefits has become increasingly unpopular
among state governments. "For state legislatures, [restoring
immigrant benefits] has become a top priority," said Sheri Steisel,
an expert on social services at the National Conference of State
Legislatures.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Moves to Keep Radioactive Bomb Plot Suspect Behind
Bars</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Justice Department asks a judge to reject
freedom request, saying Jose Padilla's lawyer and a New York federal
court both lack standing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The Justice Department asked a federal judge Wednesday to reject a
request to free Jose Padilla, a suspect in an alleged Al Qaeda plot
to explode a radioactive bomb in the United States, arguing that both
his lawyer and a New York federal court lack authority in the case.</LD>
<LD>   Padilla's lawyer, Donna R. Newman, filed papers with U.S. District
Court in Manhattan on June 19 charging that his constitutional rights
were violated when he was moved to the high-security Consolidated
Naval Brig in Charleston, S.C.</LD>
<LD>   Padilla was being held in the Metropolitan Correctional Center
here under a material witness warrant.</LD>
<TE>   On June 9, President Bush determined that Padilla, an American
citizen, was an "enemy combatant" and should be in the custody of the
United States military.</TE>
<TE>   ''The authority of the United States to seize and detain enemy
combatants is well settled--and vital to our core military
objectives,'' government lawyers said in their filing. ''... the
authority to capture and detain is not diminished by the fact that
the enemy combatant is an American citizen.''</TE>
<TE>   Not 'Next Friend'</TE>
<TE>   In its submission to U.S. District Judge Michael B. Mukasey, who
signed the order transferring Padilla, the Justice Department argued
that Newman lacked sufficient standing to continue to represent
Padilla because the lawyer didn't have a "significant relationship"
with the detainee.</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors said that while Padilla's defense lawyer had
"done her job as appointed counsel on a now-dismissed material
witness matter," it did not mean she had met the rigorous test to be
a "next friend" to bring further legal action.</TE>
<TE>   Next friend standing is typically reserved for those who have a
close personal relationship with a detainee, such as a parent, spouse
or sibling, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department also said the federal court in Manhattan no
longer had jurisdiction to consider Newman's petition either to free
Padilla, halt his interrogation or allow her to meet with him.</TE>
<TE>   Government lawyers said the only proper respondent for a petition
to challenge Padilla's detention was the commanding officer of the
brig in South Carolina where he is being held.</TE>
<TE>   "It is well settled that a court of the United States has no
jurisdiction to enjoin the president in the performance of his
official duties or otherwise to compel the president to perform any
official act," the Justice Department added.</TE>
<TE>   If Mukasey ruled in favor of Newman's continued representation of
Padilla, prosecutors said the case should then be transferred from
New York to the district court in South Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   On May 8, Padilla, a Brooklyn-born Muslim convert who took the
name Adbullah al Muhajir, was arrested by the FBI in Chicago moments
after he arrived from Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   Government officials alleged that he was conducting a scouting
mission for a bomb attack.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla was held on a material witness warrant and transferred to
New York where a grand jury investigating terrorism has been meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyer's Claim</TE>
<TE>   "The evidence linking Padilla to the alleged dirty bomb plot is
weak at best," Newman charged in court papers. "There is insufficient
evidence for the government to obtain an indictment against Padilla."</TE>
<TE>   Newman asked Mukasey to schedule a hearing during which the
government would present proof to support its claims.</TE>
<TE>   Mukasey is not expected to rule until at least next month.</TE>

<HD>Stamp Rates Rise 3 Cents on Sunday</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Mailing a letter will cost 3 cents more starting Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The boost in the first-class rate to 37 cents was approved in
February after hearings by the independent Postal Rate Commission.</LD>
<LD>   A variety of other rates, for items including postcards, parcel
post and priority mail, will go up at the same time. Postal Vice
President Azeezaly Jaffer said the increases would cost the average
person about 45 cents extra a month.</LD>
<TE>   Postmaster General John Potter has promised rates won't go up
again until at least 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The increase comes none too soon for the cash-strapped Postal
Service, which lost $1.6 billion last year, even before the terrorist
attacks cost it hundreds of millions. Nondenominated stamps covering
the new first-class rate went on sale in early June and the post
office also is printing millions of 3-cent stamps to help people use
up leftover 34-cent stamps.</TE>
<TE>   The increases affect only domestic mail.</TE>
<TE>   Besides costs from the anthrax attacks and the Sept. 11 terrorism,
mail volume has been declining in the soft economy. The agency does
not receive taxpayer funds for normal operations. However, Congress
has approved $675 million for damage and to help pay for sanitizing
government mail.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to cut costs, the post office halted new construction
and reduced staff by 12,000 last year and another 8,000 this year.</TE>
<TE>   While the cost of the first ounce of first-class mail goes up 3
cents, each additional ounce will remain at 23 cents. Postcards go up
2 cents, to 23 cents, and express mail jumps $1.20 to $13.65 for 8
ounces.</TE>

<HD>Homeland Security Plan Draws Senator's Criticism</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Warning the Bush administration not to overreach, the chairman of the
Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday criticized parts of the
president's plan for a Homeland Security Department as an attempt to
put the new agency ''above the law.''</LD>
<LD>   Drawing fire from Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) were
administration proposals that could exempt the agency from provisions
of federal whistle-blower protection law, public-record disclosure
law, purchasing rules and a range of management regulations.</LD>
<LD>   ''What this does is put them above the law. That is very troubling
to me,'' Leahy told Tom Ridge, the White House homeland security
director, during a committee hearing on the Bush plan.</LD>
<TE>   Leahy said that unless his concerns are addressed, legislation to
enact the plan could run into obstacles.</TE>
<TE>   While several committees on Capitol Hill delved into the Bush
plan, which congressional leaders hope will clear Congress this year,
the House overwhelmingly approved a separate bill requiring the
administration to set up new procedures for sharing terrorism-related
intelligence with state and local authorities. The vote was 422 to 2.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Jane Harman (D-Venice), who co-authored the legislation with
Rep. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), said it would help ensure that local
police get timely and credible information to help them respond to
emerging threats.</TE>
<TE>   ''Every act of terrorism is local,'' Harman said. ''It happens on
someone's real estate. This bill is designed to deal with that
issue.''</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement groups across the country backed the bill, which
now goes to the Senate. Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca said,
''Effective communications between agencies is one of the most
important tools law enforcement can have.''</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration supports the bill, with some
qualifications.</TE>
<TE>   Information-sharing became an issue in the weeks after the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks as local, state and federal law enforcement
officials grappled with how to respond to threats and whether to make
them publicly known.</TE>
<TE>   In one episode last fall, Gov. Gray Davis announced that he had
tightened security at major bridges in California after learning of
threats he viewed as significant. Other sources, however, downplayed
the threats.</TE>
<TE>   Harman said her legislation would help governors facing such
situations by establishing an improved process for evaluating the
credibility of information the federal government sends to state and
local authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The two dissenters were Reps. William D. Delahunt (D-Mass.) and
Dennis J. Kucinich (D-Ohio).</TE>
<TE>   Bush's plan for the Homeland Security Department would create a
vast new Cabinet agency with nearly 170,000 employees and a mission
of protecting the nation from terrorism and other domestic threats.</TE>
<TE>   Ridge vigorously defended the president's proposal before Leahy's
committee--as he has in several similar appearances in recent
days--but promised to work with senators to try to address their
concerns.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, as Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), pressed him on
whether the administration would guarantee protections to
whistle-blowers within the new department, Ridge said Bush fully
supports federal employees who want to raise alarms about government
missteps.</TE>
<TE>   ''We'll just have to work with you to assure you that the kind of
protection you want to give these men and women exists within the
statute,'' Ridge said.</TE>
<TE>   Ridge did not directly respond to Leahy's attack. But he did say
that some information the agency collects from sources in private
industry should be shielded from public view--a point business
leaders have pressed repeatedly in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   ''It would not be in the best interest of American businessmen or
women or any other American, frankly, to draw a road map of critical
infrastructure vulnerabilities for those who would do us harm,''
Ridge said.</TE>
<TE>   Several other committees are examining pieces of the proposed
department, which would take in such far-flung agencies as the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, Coast Guard, the Customs
Service and the Transportation Security Administration.</TE>
<TE>   The House Armed Services Committee quizzed defense officials on
Wednesday about the role the Pentagon would play in homeland
security. Several Republicans and Democrats voiced fears that the
plan seemed rushed.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Rep. Curt Weldon (R-Pa.) said: ''The president will
probably get what he wants. But not without a lot of members

<HD>Money-Laundering Rules Awash in the Bureaucracy</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Millions in suspect funds may be moving through
the system because the U.S. has no way to be certain sanctions are
followed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Millions of dollars in terrorist-tainted money may be
making its way through U.S. banks and financial institutions because
of the government's inability to ensure that its sanctions are being
followed, financial and law enforcement experts say.</LD>
<LD>   The problem, highlighted in a confidential report to Congress that
is raising concerns among lawmakers, has threatened to derail efforts
to shut down Osama bin Laden's money pipeline--a primary goal of the
Bush administration's war on terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   The report warns that many financial institutions--one in four,
according to a survey by the Treasury Department inspector
general--do not have computer software in place to determine whether
they are doing business with banned terrorists or affiliates. Some
institutions do not even have written guidelines or staff assigned to
ensure compliance, and dozens of banned transactions have been
allowed to proceed without detection, investigators found.</LD>
<TE>   Compounding the problem is miscommunication between the U.S.
government and the financial sector about what is allowed. Banking
executives complained in interviews that there is widespread
confusion over what the Treasury Department expects them to do in the
stepped-up effort to track and seize terrorist-tainted money, and the
simplest of tasks--like how to spell "Mohammed"--has caused banks no
shortage of frustration.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't think [the Treasury Department's asset seizure arm]
was designed for a job like this. What you're asking the financial
sector to do is very, very different from anything we've had to do in
the last 30 years," said an executive at a major bank who asked not
to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   "There's terrorist money in the system. It could be a taxi stand
in New Jersey that's running a front, it could be somewhere else, but
it's there," the executive said.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter sent Wednesday to Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill,
Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) said he was concerned by "serious
gaps" in the Treasury Department's efforts "to disrupt the financial
lifeblood of terrorists, drug kingpins, criminals and rogue nations."</TE>
<TE>   The Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control, or OFAC, has
played a central role since Sept. 11 in the U.S. effort to cut off
the flow of terrorist money, by freezing $34 million in suspected
terrorist assets and putting 210 groups and individuals on "blocking"
lists.</TE>
<TE>   But Grassley, a senior member of the Senate Finance and Judiciary
committees, told O'Neill that "with the stakes to our national
security and the war on terrorism so high, OFAC must close these gaps
... and use more aggressive and direct enforcement to carry out its
mission."</TE>
<TE>   The Treasury Department did not respond to requests for comment.
In a written response to the inspector general, however, department
officials disagreed with many findings and said the financial
sector's compliance with Treasury regulations "as a whole is very
high." Aggressive efforts to educate the financial sector, along with
the banks' "desire to avoid negative publicity" if they are found in
violation of U.S. sanctions, have driven the compliance, OFAC
director R. Richard Newcomb said.</TE>
<TE>   While the report recommended broadening OFAC's powers to close
gaps, Newcomb said the office's authority is sufficient "to
reasonably ensure compliance."</TE>
<TE>   The inspector general's study dealt largely with data compiled
before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and
the Pentagon, but officials said questions raised about Treasury's
ability to ensure compliance with its own rules have broad
ramifications for the war on terrorism. The April 26 report has been
circulated confidentially among members of Congress in recent weeks,
but the department has declined to release it publicly. A copy was
obtained by The Times.</TE>
<TE>   The stakes are high: Authorities have identified more than $4
billion worth of assets in the United States tied to designated state
sponsors of terrorism, with $3.5 billion blocked as a result of
economic sanctions against terrorist countries, the inspector
general's report said. The blocking of most of those assets pre-dated
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators found that, while the Treasury Department has made
inroads in getting financial institutions to detect and prevent
violations of foreign sanctions, the department cannot be sure that
its sanctions are being obeyed.</TE>
<TE>   Because of statutory limitations, OFAC does not randomly audit
financial institutions to see if they are complying with U.S.
sanctions, and the agency must rely on banking regulators to detect
problems, investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the inspector general found that statistical errors and
outdated policies at OFAC call into question the accuracy of the
Treasury Department's data on the thousands of financial transactions
blocked each year.</TE>
<TE>   The Treasury Department and the financial sector face the
complicated and perhaps unachievable task of identifying suspicious
activities among billions of financial transactions around the
country every day, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   The Sept. 11 hijackers managed to carry out the attacks on a
modest budget of perhaps half a million dollars, opening U.S. bank
accounts, using credit cards and staying largely within the law.
There was little to arouse suspicion.</TE>
<TE>   "These were very low dollar amounts--a couple of thousand dollars
here and there in a checking account. It wasn't going to be on
anyone's radar screen," said John Byrne, senior counsel for the
American Banking Assn.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of suspected "20th hijacker" Zacarias Moussaoui, for
instance, Moussaoui deposited $32,000 in an Oklahoma bank in early
2001, and the bank filed a cash transaction report with the
government as required, a government source said. Moussaoui, now
facing the death penalty on conspiracy charges, kept other
transactions below the $10,000 reporting requirement and did not do
anything else to attract interest, the FBI said.</TE>
<TE>   "He wasn't a known bad guy. The problem when you're trying to
track the terrorist money is that you need to not only know the
transaction took place, but the name [of the person making the
transaction] has to mean something," the government source said. "We
don't know how big the problem is. It could be millions or tens of
millions that's getting through."</TE>
<TE>   Based on a limited survey of 102 financial institutions, the
inspector general found 74 banned transactions that went through
despite U.S. sanctions in 2000--the last year for which data were
available. But officials said the magnitude of the problem may be
much greater.</TE>
<TE>   Several financial sector executives complained that part of the
problem is that the Treasury Department has adopted a "one-way
street" mentality, demanding increased accountability from financial
service firms but sometimes not providing the information to carry
out the task.</TE>
<TE>   Congress has subjected a broader range of businesses to federal
accountability requirements for reporting certain types of
transactions in an effort to spot terrorist money, but executives say
confusion remains about exactly what type of transactions are
covered, how often screening should be done, and whose orders in
Washington they should be following.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the biggest problems I'm hearing from our members is
they're not sure what they're supposed to be doing or following," the
American Banking Assn.'s Byrne said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of things [the Treasury Department] can do around
the edges rather than just say to the banks, 'Look it up, look it up,
look it up.' "</TE>
<TE>   Byrne said the Treasury Department has promised to post answers to
commonly asked questions on its Web site in coming weeks. That should
help, he said, but, "there is an inherent difficulty in getting
answers.... There are a million things we need to know."</TE>
<TE>   Particularly frustrating are the many variations on Arabic names
that may be subject to blocking orders. (Bin Laden's first name, for
instance, is spelled "Usama" by the FBI.)</TE>
<TE>   The problem has become so vexing that money-laundering expert
James R. Richards posted tips for deciphering names of Al Qaeda
suspects on the Web, at www. mlprevention.homestead.com.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't a perfect system," Byrne said. "We all need to get
better at understanding how this process works."</TE>

<HD>City Adds Fee for Haulers</HD>
<DH>Sanitation: The council's action is an attempt to encourage
recycling by private companies that collect trash from apartments and
businesses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an attempt to encourage recycling, the Los Angeles City Council
imposed a fee Wednesday on private firms that haul trash from
apartment buildings and businesses to landfills.</LD>
<LD>   The council decided that, for at least the next six months, the
city will charge haulers 10% of what they charge their customers to
dump trash in landfills. Haulers can reduce the amount they pay by
sorting out recyclables beforehand, city officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The city's Bureau of Sanitation estimates that the
trash-collection fee could generate $10 million a year, which would
be used to pay for programs to encourage recycling at apartments,
restaurants and other businesses, said bureau director Judy Wilson.</LD>
<TE>   "We'll do whatever works best to reduce tonnage," Wilson said.
"That's our goal." The fee does not apply to the sanitation bureau
itself, which collects trash and recyclables from single-family homes
in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Council members debated two ways to calculate the new fee. The
Bureau of Sanitation favored the method ultimately chosen by the City
Council, which is based on haulers' gross receipts from customers.</TE>
<TE>   However, some haulers and environmentalists maintained that tying
the fee to the trash's weight would better encourage recycling by
making dumping in landfills more expensive.</TE>
<TE>   "There needs to be an incentive to get people to recycle," said
Kim Thompson, vice president of the North Valley Coalition--a group
of residents who live near the San Fernando Valley's Sunshine Canyon
landfill, where much of the city's trash is dumped.</TE>
<TE>   Trash haulers, contractors who transport their own refuse and
neighbors of landfills said the fee will do nothing to encourage
recycling and will only go into the sanitation bureau's coffers.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council asked the Bureau of Sanitation to examine how
recycling and revenue would be affected by charging the private
haulers based on how many tons they dump.</TE>
<TE>   The bureau will also set annual goals for reducing trash sent to
landfills.</TE>
<TE>   Sanitation officials said they resisted calculating the fee based
on trash weight because doing so would cost $2 million extra for
staff to ensure that haulers were disposing of trash as they claimed,
said bureau assistant director Barry Berggren.</TE>
<TE>   "We definitely want to increase the amount of recycling that's
going on," Berggren said.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not want to spend an exorbitant amount of money trying to
conduct an audit trail."</TE>
