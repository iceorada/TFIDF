<HD>'MST3K' Humorist Comes Down to Earth</HD>
<DH>Books* Mike Nelson of 'Mystery Science Theater 3000' fame
explores the mundane world of today in 'Mind Over Matters.'</DH>

<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Ask Michael J. Nelson what he finds funny, and the answer doesn't fit
with his television image as a regular guy who spent years trading
wisecracks with robots while watching really bad movies.</LD>
<LD>   "I love the golden age of the '20s, and even earlier," Nelson
says, reeling off the names of such literary wits as P.G. Wodehouse,
S.J. Perelman and Robert Benchley.</LD>
<LD>   "I just love them all. I'm always a little worried--is it too
late, that era? Will it ever return, where people really enjoy
reading?"</LD>
<TE>   Nelson, 37, does his part to recapture those days of droll humor
with "Mike Nelson's Mind Over Matters." A collection of 58 essays on
such subjects as "Portal to Hell: The RadioShack Experience" and
"Television and How It's Shaped Us ... Into Balls of Dough," Nelson's
second book goes a long way toward establishing him as a Midwestern
Jerry Seinfeld.</TE>
<TE>   Among the targets:</TE>
<TE>   * Lunching in the Serengeti Room at the Cafe Odyssey restaurant.
("Is there anything enjoyable about eating a turkey club while living
in fear that at any moment, a Serengeti leopard will leap from the
tall plains grass, sink its teeth into the back of your neck, and as
you thrash and scream, drag you up and into a nearby shade tree,
where it consumes you slowly?")</TE>
<TE>   * Leaf blowers. ("Leaf blowers have taken a world which was, on
the whole, a decent place to live, in spite of talk radio, and turned
it into a noisy and unpleasant vale filled with atomized bits of
vegetal detritus.")</TE>
<TE>   * "Whimsical" office furniture. ("After 10 days of noting the
design's wink-and-a-nod attitude toward the modernist school, you'd
punch the chair right in its smirking, witty little face and then
step on it, bending a leg slightly and damaging its aluminum
powder-coating.")</TE>
<TE>   As former head writer and host of "Mystery Science Theater 3000,"
Nelson was with the cult cable-TV show for almost all of its
10-season run. He took over for the show's creator, comedian Joel
Hodgson, as the trapped-in-space everyman forced to watch cinematic
sludge such as "Soultaker" and "Invasion of the Neptune Men" while
exchanging quips with robots Crow and Tom Servo.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Nelson's first book after the show's demise, "Mike
Nelson's Movie Megacheese," took aim at big-name movie stars and
bloated Hollywood blockbusters. But for his new book, he was glad to
get away from bad movies and just explore the things around him, such
as his wife's obsession with skin moisturizers.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson's wife, former "Mystery Science" writer-performer Bridget
Jones, and their two young sons provide inspiration for some of the
sketches in "Mind Over Matters." The final piece is a sweet, funny
recounting of Nelson's attempts to read a bedtime story to the boys.</TE>
<TE>   But Nelson's greatest source of material is himself, such as his
clumsy attempts at musical theater or his celebration of his Danish
heritage.</TE>
<TE>   Television also provides a lot of comic fodder for Nelson. He
writes a monthly "Watch Dog" column for TV Guide. For a future
column, he's trying to get a tape of the Fox TV special "Celebrity
Boxing," featuring the Tonya Harding-Paula Jones match.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal [for TV now] is to be both stupid and appalling," Nelson
says. "Remember the golden days, when TV was just stupid? When 'My
Mother the Car' was all you needed?"</TE>
<TE>   Nelson decries the so-called reality TV trend and wacky morning
radio-show announcers who pretend to be someone else while
interviewing unsuspecting subjects.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless everyone's in on the joke, I'm not really interested in
it. It just kind of makes me squirm."</TE>
<TE>   Not that there aren't some "Mystery Science" bits that Nelson
regrets, such as the skit in which the cast mocked a large-faced
actor.</TE>
<TE>   "We flat-out called him an ugly, ugly man," Nelson says. "And it
struck us as funny. And then I watched the show, I saw it coming.
It's like, 'Oh, what if that guy is sitting there and his movie comes
on--'Hey, kids, let's watch.'"</TE>
<TE>   Nelson recently returned to writing for television, joining the
staff of the Twin Cities-produced show "Let's Bowl" for four weeks.
The show, which features bowlers settling their grudges on the lanes
for such prizes as a used Dodge Charger or a new chain saw, airs on
Comedy Central.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson recently taped a pilot for a TV show and is editing his
next book, "a clean, funny novel." He also stays in touch with fellow
"Mystery Science" cast members Bill Corbett (Crow) and Kevin Murphy
(Tom Servo).</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking about working on something," Nelson says. "That's
how vague I am. We're maybe going to turn it into a concept and then
an idea."</TE>

<LD>Since 1951, the green hills and winding lanes of Marlboro, Vt., have
provided the backdrop for a summer chamber music festival that has
recharged the batteries of many a young or senior musician. And if
the latest edition of Music From Marlboro, the touring arm of the
festival since 1965, is any indication, the juice is still flowing.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, the high-energy output of Hiroko Yajima (first violin),
Min-Young Kim (second violin), Nicholas Tzavaras (cello) and
alternating violists Sang-Jin Kim and Brian Chen sometimes produced
whoops of delight from the audience at Schoenberg Hall Thursday
night--which you don't hear too often at chamber music concerts.</LD>
<LD>   In this hall, the young musicians' huge collective sound seemed a
bit loud and coarse-grained for the Haydn String Quartet, Opus 20,
No. 2, with a middle-period-Beethoven fullness in the unison
passages. But their vitality was well-suited for the remaining works
by Hindemith and Mendelssohn.</LD>
<TE>   The generic title Quintet for Clarinet and Strings masks a jolly,
invigorating, extraordinarily clever bit of writing from Hindemith's
brash late 20s, where the finale is an exact backward replay of the
first movement and the weird fourth movement finds the solo clarinet
sounding just one deadpan note at the bottom of its register.
Clarinetist Alexander Fiterstein played both B-flat and E-flat
clarinets with lusty abandon as the strings attacked Hindemith's busy
passages with big-boned gusto.</TE>
<TE>   With both violists at work in Mendelssohn's String Quintet, Opus
87, the ensemble's luxurious tone sometimes resembled that of a
chamber orchestra. But the vigorous tempos and attacks kept things
moving.</TE>

<HD>Seeing Monet as a Precursor to Digital Art</HD>
<DH>Art* A Swiss museum draws a painterly line from the
pioneering Impressionist and his waterlilies to today's vibrant new
works.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HANNS NEUERBOURG</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>BASEL, Switzerland</DL>
<LD>By the time he died 75 years ago, Claude Monet's late work had been
more or less dismissed by many avant-garde artists.</LD>
<LD>   Critics dubbed him an anachronism, a man who had outlived himself.
For Lionello Venturi, a leading Italian art historian, he was a
"gravedigger of Impressionism," the movement to which a Monet piece
once gave its name.</LD>
<LD>   But after World War II, interest in Monet surged again, chiefly in
the United States. It centered on his famous waterlilies and other
"series paintings," depicting on various canvases the same subject
under the changing effect of light and weather.</LD>
<TE>   With advancing age, he had evolved a diffuse style, bordering on
the abstract. Suddenly, Monet's late oeuvre was recognized as an
important landmark in the evolution of modern art.</TE>
<TE>   Now, a major Swiss exhibition sets out to show a path leading from
these masterpieces to the video and computer art of the 21st century.</TE>
<TE>   "Claude Monet ... Up to Digital Impressionism" is the title of the
show expected by organizers to draw a quarter of a million visitors
to the Beyeler Foundation Museum in suburban Riehen.</TE>
<TE>   Museum founder Ernst Beyeler said it is seeking to "trace the
dominant role of Monet's work as a preliminary stage to abstract
painting." It is also, he said, trying to explore the link between
Impressionism and present-day "electronic aesthetics."</TE>
<TE>   More than 40 of Monet's color-saturated works, some never before
seen in public, are on view. The spotlight is on his heavily textured
landscapes with blurring contours and neither horizon nor
perspective.</TE>
<TE>   They are displayed along with almost equal numbers of modern and
contemporary exhibits. Lenders include museums and private collectors
in the United States and eight European countries.</TE>
<TE>   Featured are many from Monet's garden series at Giverny, his home
after 1890, with its legend-inspiring waterlily pond that became the
most important subject in his late career, culminating with the
"Grandes Decorations," a decorative cycle of murals in the Paris
Orangerie.</TE>
<TE>   The dazzling eight-part panorama of a lily pond, Monet's gift to
the French nation, was opened to the public seven months after his
death. But it soon was neglected as critical esteem shifted.</TE>
<TE>   After visiting the Orangerie on his return from U.S. exile a
quarter-century later, French painter Andre Masson praised it in a
widely cited article as the "Sistine Chapel of Impressionism."</TE>
<TE>   Contributing to the postwar "Monet Revival" was also a
comprehensive 1949 Impressionist exhibition in Basel, focusing for
the first time on several late waterlilies that had remained rolled
up in the Giverny studio since Monet's death. They were lent by
Monet's son, Michel.</TE>
<TE>   Writing in a catalog for the show, art historian Michael Leja
credits the paintings of American abstract expressionists as playing
the key role in the rediscovery of Monet. He named Jackson Pollock,
Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman and Mark Rothko as artists "who had
educated the vision of contemporary viewers to recognize the
achievements of Monet's late work."</TE>
<TE>   Paintings by them are displayed in the show's "Modernism" section.
Leja's German colleague, Karin Sagner-Duechting, who initiated the
project, says that for many of the more than 300 American artists who
went on a pilgrimage to Paris in the 1950s, "the immediate experience
of Monet became a catalyst."</TE>
<TE>   Works by modernists on view range from a 1910 study by Wassily
Kandinsky to a 1995 canvas by Anselm Kiefer. Kandinsky had been one
of the few turn-of-the-century avant-garde artists to sense the
importance of Monet's late style.</TE>
<TE>   In a prologue to the section displaying analytical and digital
art, Monet's wintry "Misty Morning, Floes Melting" hangs opposite a
series of white monochromes by Robert Ryman. It is the only direct
juxtaposition allowing observers to judge the affinity of their
styles. The section also includes a work by video artist Diana
Thater, featuring Monet garden impressions and an eroticized
installation by Pipilotti Rist called "Sip My Ocean."</TE>
<TE>   For Markus Bruederlin, chief curator of the Beyeler Foundation,
the concept of "Digital Impressionism" transports "the painterly
visions of this ancestor of modern art [Monet] into the 21st
century."</TE>
<TE>   The foundation's own Monet, a monumental "Water Lily Pond"
triptych that, at more than 9 yards wide, is also the largest of the
show, was moved from its regular room, where it faced a real lily
pond, to be temporarily replaced by the latest work at the show,
which is only slightly smaller.</TE>
<TE>   Olafur Eliasson's 2002 "Your Spiral View" is a 26-foot tunnel of
highly polished steel with a dazzling kaleidoscopic effect.</TE>
<TE>   Beyeler, who also owns one of Switzerland's most highly reputed
art galleries, said at the opening that, despite the expected large
influx, the show is certain to run up a "tremendous deficit" before
it closes Aug. 4.</TE>
<TE>   With Monets selling at auction for up to $33 million--and other
leading artists also selling well--insurance premiums are
skyrocketing. Proceeds from the gallery allow him to continue to
mount important shows, he said in an interview with the Basler
Zeitung newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   "In the future, the very great exhibitions are likely to be
reduced in scale, because it is becoming increasingly difficult to
loan high-quality pictures," Beyeler said. "Therefore, we are trying
to run ahead of this trend and will continue to organize such shows
as long as possible."</TE>

<HD>Piano Competition: Few Votes for Critic</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his commentary on the Pasadena Rachmaninoff International
Competition ("Competition of Pianists Ends on a Controversial Note,"
April 8), Mark Swed seems to have missed the spirit of the last two
weeks by only attending the Saturday night awards.</LD>
<LD>   I witnessed a building excitement and enthusiasm as the rounds
were completed and seen by the ever-increasing audience, which
included proud homeowners who had "adopted" the contestants and their
10-hour-a-day practice sessions, smitten seniors who worked
tirelessly to make all the arrangements, intent piano students who
watched the virtuoso performances in awe and, finally, all of the
rest of us who love classical music.</LD>
<LD>   I refuse to let Swed's cruel and cynical criticism ruin a unique
gathering of music lovers and contestants in our town of Pasadena.
Even if my favorites didn't win, I will always remember their
alternately feisty and romantic performances, and, above all, their
earnestness.</LD>
<TE>   If these pianists are a "dime a dozen," as Swed claims, then I have
great faith in the youth of the world and am thrilled there are so many of
them.</TE>
<TE>   BARBARA SHEINKOPF</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena</TE>
<TE>   It is unusual for me to go to a piano competition four times in a
row, but after going to the Norton Simon Museum, where the
competition started out--what a marvelous little museum--I got
hooked, like many others. The audience swelled from 20-some people
into thousands as the competition went on.</TE>
<TE>   Swed could not possibly get hooked because he did not go to any of
the concerts except the last one, which was basically an award
ceremony and not a contest--most unusual for somebody who wants to
review the competition as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   TIBOR ZADA</TE>
<TE>   Beverly Hills</TE>
<TE>   Swed's ignorant assertions that the competition was a "Russian
enterprise" with a "predictable" (predetermined?) award, going to a
"vulgar" Russian pianist whose previous collaboration with the
"crude" Russian orchestra somehow influenced the outcome, are
stunning in their audacity.</TE>
<TE>   With one destructive swipe, he completely obliterates the American
organizers and sponsors of the event, the city of Pasadena, the
Norton Simon Museum and Jorge Mester and the Pasadena Symphony, as
well as slandering every one of the 13 distinguished jurists (four of
them Americans), and all of the other 29 contestants.</TE>
<TE>   LAYNE NIELSON</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   It was a challenging task to organize this competition, but the
promoters should get applause for trying. I hope the event will find
a permanent place here and not be deterred by such undeserved and
cheap reviews from the L.A. Times.</TE>
<TE>   FREDERICK R. ANDRESEN</TE>
<TE>   Corona del Mar</TE>
<TE>   The decision of the jurors at Friday night's final installment of
the Rachmaninoff competition to disqualify Italian pianist Alessio
Cioni as a finalist was appalling. There is no evidence in their own
guidelines for such action and such a punitive gesture seems contrary
to the very beauty and spirit of the music of the beloved
Rachmaninoff himself.</TE>
<TE>   What seemed to be purely an effort to cut the monetary awards of
the prizes resulted in a petty and unnecessary gesture by the jurors
that simply and sadly puts the whole idea of classical musical
competitions in the same kind of scandalous and distasteful category
as figure skating.</TE>

<TE>   The Ince Legend</TE>
<TE>   Some Hollywood legends never die, no matter how erroneous.
Example: Walt Disney was frozen for thawing at a later date (he was
cremated).</TE>
<TE>   Now Peter Bogdanovich is attempting to make some hay with the
ancient wheeze that Thomas Ince was killed in 1924 by William
Randolph Hearst's bullet ("Can Fiction Solve a Real Mystery?" by
Kevin Maynard, April 10). Not so.</TE>
<TE>   In 1924, my father, George H. Thomas, left his post as editor of
the San Diego Sun for what turned out to be a short-lived job. He
became the publicist for the studio magnate Thomas Ince. In his later
years, my father was amused by the alleged scandalous happenings
aboard Hearst's yacht, and one day he told me what happened.</TE>
<TE>   "Ince was a gourmand. He ate and ate, and one night he ate too
much. His stomach burst, and that's what killed him."</TE>
<TE>   The alleged shooting has been treated in film histories, novels
and plays. I'm sure Peter's movie will not be the last word on the
subject. As the newspaper editor remarks in "The Man Who Shot Liberty
Valance": "This is the West. When the legend becomes a fact, print
the legend."</TE>
<TE>   BOB THOMAS</TE>
<TE>   Encino</TE>
<TE>   Casting and Ethnicity</TE>
<TE>   I can't help but think that the anger over the casting of Alicia
Nash in "A Beautiful Mind" (Saturday Letters, April 7) is much ado
about nothing. To reduce the art of acting to the question of whether
the casting was as politically correct as it could have been is to
seriously undermine what great actors can accomplish.</TE>
<TE>   Was there a similar "outrage" when the non-Indian Ben Kingsley
earned an Oscar for his portrayal of Mahatma Gandhi in 1982? Did
anyone feel slapped in the face when the Irish Liam Neeson and the
English Ralph Fiennes were both (deservedly) nominated for Oscars for
their respective performances in "Schindler's List" (Schindler was
Czech, by the way)?</TE>
<TE>   I'm sure we all remember the horrible crime of casting the Texan
Renee Zellweger as the British Bridget Jones (and let's ignore the
fact that she was nominated for an Oscar as well). And it strikes me
as completely hilarious that not one person has raised the "issue"
(if there is an issue at all) that Russell Crowe is Australian, while
John Nash is not.</TE>
<TE>   It's at the point that I wouldn't be surprised if someone were to
complain that no one of Middle-Earth descent was cast in "The Lord of
the Rings."</TE>
<TE>   Let's not all be hypocrites and exploit a double standard for the
sake of political correctness, agreed?</TE>

<TE>   Defending 'Queer as Folk'</TE>
<TE>   I was sorry to read Liz Smith's characterization of Showtime's
"Queer as Folk" as an "awful TV venture," while she lauded Cher's
belief that it does a disservice to gays ("Cher Continues to
Astound," April 8).</TE>
<TE>   As a proud member of the gay community, I could not disagree more.
I, and many of my gay friends, look forward to each new episode of
this groundbreaking and wonderfully heartfelt series. At the same
time, I find the critically acclaimed "Will and Grace" completely
impossible to watch, the gay equivalent of "Amos and Andy"; but then,
I would not be surprised to learn that this is the kind of "safe" and
stereotypical gay fare that makes Smith comfortable.</TE>

<TE>   Brant in the Spotlight</TE>
<TE>   Bravo to Josef Woodard! His article about Pulitzer Prize-winning
composer Henry Brant ("Space for More," April 10) brought the essence
of this exciting music to life. The all-too-modest Brant truly
deserves the spotlight. I hope Los Angeles will experience his work
at the soon-to-be-finished Walt Disney Concert Hall.</TE>

<TE>   In his article "The Unusual Province of Canadian Films" (April 5),
Wade Major asks, "What could be stranger than a movie narrated by a
talking fish?"</TE>
<TE>   How about a movie narrated by six talking fish?</TE>
<TE>   Been there, done that, in Monty Python's "The Meaning of Life"--a
$9-million movie still not yet in profit, according to Universal. How
do they manage that? Incredible, isn't it? Perhaps they use Arthur
Andersen.</TE>

<HD>'SpongeBob' Creator Feels Wrung Out</HD>
<DH>Television* The cartoon's executive producer says he won't
renew his contract with Nickelodeon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTIJANE LEVINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Steve Hillenburg, the creator, executive producer and head writer of
the hit "SpongeBob Squarepants" cartoon series, said Friday he will
not renew his contract with Nickelodeon to make more episodes.</LD>
<LD>   When he finishes with the current set of 20 segments, he will have
completed 60 shows. "I definitely need a break," Hillenburg, 40, told
The Times. "I want to try something new."</LD>
<LD>   The animated series, which began airing in 1999, features a cheesy
yellow sink sponge who lives in an underwater pineapple in the town
of Bikini Bottom, along with an assortment of endearing
invertebrates.</LD>
<TE>   The show has caught on with children and adults, and it has
spawned an entire industry of "SpongeBob Squarepants" merchandise
that the cable network says has brought in approximately $500
million.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the network wants to make a 'SpongeBob' movie,"
Hillenburg said. "I also want to make a movie. I wouldn't want to try
and work on the series concurrently with the film."</TE>
<TE>   Nicole Mazer, a spokeswoman for Nickelodeon, said no movie deal
has been set. "Nothing's been signed between Hillenburg and
Nickelodeon," she said. She confirmed that "SpongeBob" production
will "go on hiatus for a while."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, she said, fans need not fear immediate withdrawal
symptoms. There are at least 20 episodes in the pipeline that have
not been seen, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Whether he does the "SpongeBob" film or not, Hillenburg said he
will not re-sign for the TV show when the current contract ends. It's
not an unusual time to stop, Hillenburg said. Many animation shows
end at around 60 episodes. Some resume production at a later date.</TE>
<TE>   Nickelodeon's "Rugrats," for example, stopped at 65 segments.
"Then they made a movie, and after that they came back and made more
episodes for TV. That could eventually happen with 'SpongeBob' too,"
Hillenburg said, "although I really have no idea what I'll do."</TE>
<TE>   But Nickelodeon can do anything it wants. The studio owns all
rights to the show and to franchises for "SpongeBob" merchandise.
Hillenburg sold his rights to get his concept made, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "You could never get anything made if you didn't sell" ownership
to the people who are spending the money to make it, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nickelodeon could continue to produce new episodes without the
show's creator being involved, as happened years ago with the
channel's "Ren &amp; Stimpy" series.</TE>
<TE>   But he doesn't think Nickelodeon would. "I think they respect that
my contribution is important," Hillenburg said. "I think they would
want to maintain the original concept and quality."</TE>

<HD>Taping Stories of TV Pioneers</HD>
<DH>Archive* An ambitious team hustles to interview people who
helped get the new medium started, but it's a race against time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Those who work in television are accustomed to operating at a
frenetic pace, but a small staff in a nondescript North Hollywood
office faces a different sort of race against time.</LD>
<LD>   The recent deaths of Milton Berle, programming innovator Sylvester
"Pat" Weaver and "The Fugitive" creator Roy Huggins offer reminders
that the television business' pioneering generation is gradually
passing on, instilling a greater sense of urgency in those assembling
the Archive of American Television, an ambitious effort to preserve
on video the memories and insights of those who gave birth to and
shaped the medium.</LD>
<LD>   Under the aegis of the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences
Foundation, the archive has taped unedited broadcast-quality
interviews--ranging in length from three to seven hours--with 265 TV
pioneers, ranging from actors and producers to editors and engineers,
totaling nearly 900 hours of footage.</LD>
<TE>   Bob Hope recently donated $1 million to help finance the venture,
which is still wrestling with funding to continue conducting
interviews, digitize them and begin making the material accessible to
a wider audience.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt this was really a worthwhile program, not just for the
foundation but the industry," said TV Academy Foundation Chairman
Thomas Sarnoff, the son of Gen. David Sarnoff, who founded NBC.
"Nobody else was chronicling the history of television through the
eyes and words of the people who created and developed it."</TE>
<TE>   The project was initiated in 1996, when then-Disney Television
executive Dean Valentine took the idea to Richard Frank, the former
president of the TV academy and Disney Studios.</TE>
<TE>   Valentine drew inspiration both from his friendship with
writer-producer Danny Arnold--who, before his death in 1995, regaled
him with show-business anecdotes from his career, which included
"Barney Miller" and "Bewitched"--and from Steven Spielberg's Shoah
Foundation. The foundation documents the stories of Holocaust
survivors, many of whom, like the TV industry's pioneers, are now in
their 70s and older.</TE>
<TE>   The long-term goal is to make the television archive available via
a central location as well as on the Internet, establishing a
database for university students, libraries and TV viewers around the
world.</TE>
<TE>   Executive producer Michael Rosen, who oversees the archive's few
employees from new offices adjacent to the TV academy in North
Hollywood, said sessions are meticulously researched and don't shy
away from topics that portray Hollywood in a less-than-flattering
light, such as the blacklisting during the McCarthy era.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Rosen sees the archive's appeal extending beyond
television to 20th century history. Someone interested in John F.
Kennedy's assassination, for example, will eventually be able to
access interviews with Walter Cronkite, Robert MacNeil and "60
Minutes" producer Don Hewitt, who covered the story and shared
recollections of that day during their interviews. Many subjects also
reminisce about the Great Depression's influence on their lives or
about the advent of television.</TE>
<TE>   "These interviews are seen as archival documents.... The best way
to look at it is an interactive encyclopedia," Rosen said.</TE>
<TE>   The archive's current schedule calls for taping 50 interviews a
year, with a committee of industry volunteers, in consultation with
various academics, selecting candidates from a wish list of more than
1,000 names. Those already interviewed include Berle, Steve Allen,
Sid Caesar, Carl Reiner, Aaron Spelling, Sheldon Leonard, "I Love
Lucy" writer Madelyn Pugh Davis, Ted Turner, Grant Tinker, Mary Tyler
Moore and Dick Van Dyke.</TE>
<TE>   "Looking back, I'm somewhat disappointed we didn't start this
sooner," Sarnoff said. "We're trying to pick up, to the extent we
can, interviews with people who have passed away who we didn't get so
we can include them."</TE>
<TE>   An interview was conducted with ABC founder Leonard Goldenson, for
example, who died in 1999 at the age of 94; however, the archive was
initiated after the deaths of NBC's Sarnoff, CBS patriarch William S.
Paley and many others. Thomas Sarnoff has provided tapes of
interviews with his father, while Johnny Carson's company donated
interviews with Jack Benny and George Burns.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a constant, ticking clock that is running after us," Rosen
said.</TE>
<TE>   Even within the TV industry, the archive is still a relatively
well-kept secret. Some footage has been licensed to A&amp;E's "Biography"
series and E! Entertainment Television, and nostalgic cable network
TV Land has been running 30- and 60-second interstitial segments
relating to classic TV series culled from the interviews.</TE>
<TE>   Still, organizers say they remain a long way from their ultimate
goal, which includes both increasing the pace of the interviews and
finding a secure way to disseminate them, as Rosen put it, that will
"take it out of a dusty room and make it accessible."</TE>
<TE>   The foundation received $1 million from ABC at the outset and has
picked up smaller donations in addition to the recent grant from
Hope.</TE>
<TE>   Fund-raising, however, has not come easily--prompting Sarnoff, who
as a child was featured by his father in an early demonstration of TV
technology, to suggest that current industry leaders are apathetic
toward a program that Rosen compares to having the opportunity to
hear Mozart discuss classical music or Shakespeare, literature.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like pulling teeth; it's like pulling arms and legs,"
Sarnoff said. "They don't really seem to care, or understand, what
their own history was."</TE>
<TE>   Although the TV academy is best known for honoring television with
its annual presentation of the Emmy Awards, the foundation's
ancillary activities include sponsoring internships, handing out
awards to college filmmakers and orchestrating seminars for college
and university faculty.</TE>
<TE>   "The academy focuses on the present," Sarnoff explained. "The
foundation concentrates on the past and the future. This archival
program is not just about the past, but it's the future too."</TE>

<LD>Those Duke boys are doing all right.</LD>
<LD>   John Schneider, who played Bo Duke 20 years ago on the CBS country
comedy and car-chase caper "The Dukes of Hazzard," now plays
Superman's adoptive father on the WB's popular "Smallville," while
Tom Wopat, who played Luke Duke, has been amassing stage credits,
notably as co-star of the late-'90s Broadway revival of "Annie Get
Your Gun."</LD>
<LD>   Now, Wopat--a velvety, virile baritone--is exploring a recording
and cabaret career that brought him to the Orange County Performing
Arts Center Thursday to sing in the smooth, uninflected style of '50s
and '60s jazz, which he tried out a year and a half ago on the album
"The Still of the Night." Opening his four-day engagement in the
center's intimate nightclub space, Founders Hall, Wopat evoked Vegas
back in the days when Frankie, Sammy and Joey owned the town.</LD>
<TE>   Wopat's take on this style is so restrained and predictable that
pretty soon, Harold Arlen's "Let's Fall in Love" began to sound just
like Hoagy Carmichael's "I Get Along Without You Very Well," which
sounded like Cole Porter's "In the Still of the Night." If Wopat
wants to succeed in the cabaret world, he would do well to take a
step back toward acting and connect more emotionally with each song.
If he can recapture the irresistible combination of swagger and
vulnerability that he lent to the Frank Butler character in "Annie
Get Your Gun," so much the better.</TE>
<TE>   In performance, as on the album, he was most in touch with a pair
of Jimmy Webb tunes: "The Moon's a Harsh Mistress" and "If These
Walls Could Speak," his voice sweeping through the songs like a
lonesome wind across a prairie.</TE>
<TE>   Venturing from the album, he tried to have fun though still proved
awfully strait-laced with Bob Dorough and Dave Frish- berg's "I'm
Hip," Wardell Gray and Annie Ross' "Twisted" and a fast-tempo version
of Jerome Kern's "I Won't Dance," propelled by Ted Firth on piano,
Don Kasper on bass and Peter Grant on drums.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Wopat appears at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600
Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa, tonight at 7:30 and 9:30 and Sunday at
7 p.m. $46 and $49. (714) 740-7878.</TE>

<LD>   Next Ellen Incarnation: A Weekday Talk Show</LD>
<LD>   As Rosie O'Donnell and Sally Jessy Raphael make plans to leave the
daytime talk arena, Ellen DeGeneres is getting ready to enter. She
has signed a deal to host an hourlong syndicated talk/variety show
beginning in the fall of 2003.</LD>
<TE>   Produced by Telepictures and distributed by Warner Bros. Domestic
Television, the weekday series is contingent on what happens with her
CBS sitcom, which is currently on the bench. CBS is expected to make
a decision in the next few weeks about whether to renew "The Ellen
Show."</TE>
<TE>   DeGeneres, who began her career as a stand-up comic, is best known
for her earlier ABC series "Ellen."</TE>
<TE>   'Real World' Turned Into MTV Movie</TE>
<TE>   Let's see if we've got this straight. MTV, which kicked off the
current TV fad of mixing fiction filmmaking elements (casting, sets,
situations) with the documentary genre to produce unscripted dramas
in the form of its long-running series "The Real World," is now going
to turn the concept around by making a TV movie about the so-called
reality show. It will feature a combination of real actors and former
"Real World" cast members.</TE>
<TE>   Got that?</TE>
<TE>   More simply, Mary-Ellis Bunim and Jon Murray, the creators and
producers of "The Real World," are producing a TV movie for MTV
called "The Real World--The Lost Season," to air Aug. 6. The plot: A
group of people assemble to tape a new edition of "The Real World"
but wind up being kidnapped to another location by a young man who
had been unable to land a spot on the show. He's determined to make
his own version and threatens to blow up the house if they don't
comply.</TE>
<TE>   MTV didn't say whether the TV movie is based on real events.</TE>
<TE>   RADIO</TE>
<TE>   Ed Pyle Named</TE>
<TE>   KNX News Director</TE>
<TE>   Ed Pyle, executive news producer of KNX-AM (1070) since 1990, on
Friday was named news director. Beginning April 29, he'll replace Bob
Sims, a 33-year veteran of the all-news station who has been news
director since 1982. Sims is retiring for personal reasons, the
station said.</TE>
<TE>   Pyle's career spans more than three decades. He joined KNX as a
reporter in 1985 and for the previous 10 years had been a news editor
and news director at KFWB-AM (980).</TE>
<TE>   Ronnie Bradford, KNX's news producer since 1982, will take over
Pyle's job as executive news producer.</TE>

<TE>   Good News/Bad News Review for Diaz</TE>
<TE>   It may be the worst good review Cameron Diaz has ever received--a
write-up of her latest outing, "The Sweetest Thing," by the
Washington Post's Stephen Hunter.</TE>
<TE>   "The best thing about Cameron Diaz, God love her, isn't how bad
she is, which is wonderful enough," he wrote. "It's how oblivious she
is to her awfulness.... She's so awful she's fabulous."</TE>
<TE>   How awful is she? "She can't dance, she can't act, she can hardly
walk and to see her is to love her forever. She's so cursed with
beauty, no one has ever had the nerve to tell her she stinks, or to
school her, or even direct her just a bit.</TE>
<TE>   "Unguided, she gets by entirely on the powerful grace of her three
most striking attributes: her legs, her attitude and her butt. When
she doesn't know what to do, which is frequently, she just shakes any
one, two or three of the above, to brilliant effect."</TE>
<TE>   MGM, New Line Settle 'Goldmember' Dispute</TE>
<TE>   New Line Cinema and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. have reached an
agreement that will allow New Line to resume using the disputed title
"Austin Powers in Goldmember" on its new James Bond spoof this
summer.</TE>
<TE>   In return, New Line agreed that for all future titles that may be
construed as parodies of Bond, the titles must first be subject to
approval by MGM.</TE>
<TE>   MGM had previously filed a protest with the Motion Picture Assn.
of America, claiming that the "Goldmember" title was an infringement
on its 1964 Bond film, "Goldfinger," starring Sean Connery.</TE>
<TE>   A three-member MPAA arbitration panel subsequently ruled that New
Line had committed a technical infraction by going public with the
title before it had been properly registered. New Line then launched
a nationwide effort to retrieve thousands of posters and movie
trailers that had already gone out to theaters.</TE>
<TE>   With the agreement, New Line is expected to soon launch a
large-scale marketing campaign on behalf of the Bond spoof, which
stars comedian Mike Myers as the bespectacled, snaggletoothed British
secret agent Austin Powers.</TE>
<TE>   The film is scheduled to be released in North America and the
United Kingdom on July 26.</TE>

<TE>   All-Chinese 'Turandot' Tour Planned</TE>
<TE>   Promoters of the highly successful "Three Tenors" concerts have
announced plans for a 15-city North American tour of Puccini's final
opera, "Turandot," with an all-Chinese cast. Anaheim will be one of
the stops during the September-October outing.</TE>
<TE>   Organized by the Rudas Theatrical Organization, the production
will be mounted in the round at sports arenas and convention centers.
And, in another break with operatic tradition, the singers will wear
microphones because of the often-poor acoustics in those venues.</TE>
<TE>   "Turandot," which premiered in Milan in 1926, had one of its most
famous stagings in Beijing's Forbidden City in 1998. It's the story
of the cruel Chinese ice-princess Turandot, who poses three riddles

<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK--With the release Tuesday of guidelines for the development
of ground zero, the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. has taken the
first significant step toward the creation of a master plan for the
16-acre World Trade Center site. And although it's too soon to panic,
there's reason for concern.</LD>
<LD>   Assembled by Alexander Garvin, the agency's vice president for
planning, design and development, the guidelines propose a park with
a memorial and a related museum of American freedom, a development
that would include housing; commercial and retail space; the
relocation of West Street, the site's west boundary, below ground for
better pedestrian access to Battery Park City and its World Financial
Center; and the reestablishment of a number of streets that were
eradicated when the World Trade Center complex was built in the
1970s.</LD>
<LD>   The Lower Manhattan Development Corp. expects to lay out a
timetable in the next few months for developing the early phases of
the project. The schedule will focus first on the reconstruction of
the underground transportation hub linking subway and rail lines and
on establishing a competition to design the park and related
memorials.</LD>
<TE>   Safe and unimaginative, the guidelines reflect the planning
mentality that has shaped large-scale development in Manhattan for
decades.</TE>
<TE>   But ground zero is no ordinary site; its planning demands the
highest level of creative intelligence. That will require a
willingness to break rules, to challenge accepted orthodoxies. And
that's something the current guidelines are unlikely to accomplish.</TE>
<TE>   Established in November by New York Gov. George Pataki and
then-Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the development agency's function is to
coordinate the interests of all stakeholders in the site. And the
main aim of the guidelines, in fact, is a political one--to avoid a
collision between the forces vying for control of the site--the
ordinary citizens and victims' families who consider ground zero a
sacred site and the city's power brokers, who see it as prime real
estate and worry about plummeting property values.</TE>
<TE>   In effect, the guidelines isolate these interests by creating two
distinct zones. That is accomplished by reestablishing the old lower
Manhattan street grid. The most important of these streets are
Greenwich and Fulton, which would cross to create a roughly 7-acre
lot at the southwest corner of the site. That lot contains the
footprint of the twin towers, and it's widely assumed that it will
eventually become the site of the memorial. The remaining 9 acres
would be divided into city blocks, which could then be independently
developed as housing, retail and commercial space.</TE>
<TE>   Such divisions, in turn, allow the agency to practice a kind of
design-containment policy, establishing different creative standards
for each of the two zones. Although the details have yet to be worked
out, the park and other memorial elements will be created via a
competition, an approach that will probably attract a number of
celebrated architects and artists. So far, however, there has been no
discussion of launching such a competition for the rest of the site,
which implies that at least some portions of it--if not all--will be
designed along more conventional commercial-development lines.</TE>
<TE>   The outcome of such an approach is fairly easy to predict. The
best-case scenario is a project such as Berlin's Potsdamer Platz, by
Italian architect Renzo Piano. The result of a 1992 international
competition sponsored by Daimler-Benz, Potsdamer Platz restored a
historic district destroyed by the construction of the Berlin Wall.
Covering 16.8 acres, it is eerily similar in scale to the ground zero
site and it also includes underground transportation systems and a
mixed-use development of corporate towers, housing and retail shops.</TE>
<TE>   Piano's design blends traditional planning strategies with a
modern building aesthetic. It does not shy away from contemporary
realities, nor does it slip into a nostalgic sentimentality. The
sleek forms of his towers are discreetly woven into the surrounding
city fabric. Many of them--equipped with soaring glass atriums--have
an exquisite lightness.</TE>
<TE>   But as a whole, the development has the homogenous, slightly
sterile feel of the edge cities that are a dominant feature of the
contemporary urban experience. The reason is the restrictions placed
on Piano's design by Berlin's powerful planning board, which
regulated street patterns, building heights and exterior cladding
materials. The result is a uniformity that even a skilled architect
could not overcome.</TE>
<TE>   A more likely result at ground zero, however, is something closer
in spirit to Battery Park City. Its 1979 master plan is an example of
New Urbanist strategies, which are modeled on the patterns of the
traditional city. Covering 92 acres, the mixed-use development
includes the four World Financial Center towers that overlook the
World Trade Center site.</TE>
<TE>   Battery Park City's narrow pedestrian streets lined by
buttoned-up, limestone facades and old-fashioned lampposts fail to
create the kind of urban complexity that its proponents claimed to
love. Rather than reproduce the rich mix of contrasting styles and
social hierarchies that true cities accumulate over time, the
sprawling development remains somewhat soulless and artificial.</TE>
<TE>   Applying such a formula at ground zero would be particularly
ironic. Battery Park City was conceived as an antidote to the kind of
postwar, Modernist superblocks that Minoru Yamasaki's World Trade
Center embodied. The two projects represent two extremes in a
long-standing, often vicious ideological battle. To build one over
the ruins of the other 25 years later would symbolize a particularly
perverse victory.</TE>
<TE>   As of now, however, two master plans already in the works lean
toward the Battery Park City model. The most detailed of these is a
plan designed by David Childs of Skidmore Owings &amp; Merrill for Larry
Silverstein, the developer who holds the lease on the land for the
World Trade Center. It reestablishes the street grid and calls for a
5-acre memorial park. Its dense grid of commercial buildings conforms
to the height limits established by the World Financial Center next
door and includes a single, soaring 100-story tower.</TE>
<TE>   Brookfield Financial Properties, which owns three of the four
World Financial Center towers, also completed a master plan for
ground zero, although the group has no direct stake in the site.
Designed by Alex Cooper, of Cooper, Robertson &amp; Partners/--a designer
of the master plan for Battery Park City--the scheme has not yet been
unveiled. Sources say its main features include a submerged West
Street that would carry the bulk of traffic, leaving a grand
boulevard above, linking ground zero and Brookfield's property.</TE>
<TE>   Garvin and others at the Lower Manhattan Redevelopment Corp. have
carefully studied both plans, and Higgins said that the two teams
"have done a lot of the legwork in evaluating challenges at the site
and they'll be a large part of the consulting process."</TE>
<TE>   There are more courageous approaches the city could take. It could
back away from parceling up the site, from divisions between
creativity and commerce, and instead encourage the widest possible
range of designers and thinkers to reconceive it as a more unified
composition.</TE>
<TE>   Other cities have been aggressive in engaging such talents, who
have often produced fluid, cohesive and ultimately more compelling
visions for the urban environment.</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, the city of Lille, France, hired Dutch architect Rem
Koolhaas to design a 290-acre master plan for Euralille, a commercial
and business development that borders the city's historic core.
Koolhaas created a sleek, futuristic network of circulation systems,
with commercial towers implanted on top of high-speed rail stations
and underground freeways. In Singapore, London-based Zaha Hadid
recently completed a master plan for a 494-acre science hub. Her mix
of housing, commercial space and research facilities is enveloped in
a uniform landscape, its surface evoking a softly crumpled carpet,
with roads carved out of its surface.</TE>
<TE>   Another promising example is under construction in Yokohama,
Japan, a park and ferry terminal set on a 7.5-acre pier. The result
of a 1994 competition that attracted 660 entries, it was designed by
Foreign Office Architects, a husband-and-wife team then in their
early 30s. The scheme drapes an undulating park of natural and steel
forms and sinuous wood walkways over the ferry terminal's massive
hall like a luxurious urban blanket.</TE>
<TE>   All of these designs represent a level of creative energy that the
Lower Manhattan Development Corp. has yet to engage. Each share a
desire to create new forms for a new age.</TE>
<TE>   That spirit, of course, has always defined New York. It was the
driving force behind developments like Rockefeller Center, whose
imposing scale and muscular, streamlined forms embodied an unwavering
faith in the future. Even the twin towers, for all their supposed
isolation, stood as a stunning counterpoint to the older landmarks
that dot the downtown skyline.</TE>
<TE>   The development agency still has time take a broader view of the
site's future. They could launch an international competition--not
solely for a predetermined memorial parcel--but for the entire site.
That would create a more open public debate, one that could explore
the far reaches of contemporary planning ideas.</TE>
<TE>   The question can be reduced to this: Does New York want an
architecture that is business as usual, or a deeper level of
soul-searching, and with it, the possibility of a vision that has
real transformative power?</TE>

<HD>Heroine of 'Constance Wilde' Remains in Husband's Shadow</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHILIP BRANDES</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Being the wife of Oscar Wilde was an especially thankless lot in
life. Eclipsed by her husband's fame as the premier intellect and wit
of Victorian society, then marginalized by his roaming homosexual
exploits and finally disgraced by his public persecution, Constance
Wilde is remembered, if at all, as a minor orbiting satellite in her
husband's notorious history.</LD>
<LD>   With his three-character drama, "The Secret Fall of Constance
Wilde," the Irish writer Thomas Kilroy tries to rescue Constance from
obscurity, recounting the high price she paid for her husband's ruin
and speculating on her unrelated private tragedies. Alas, Kilroy's
efforts to keep Constance in the spotlight are only partly successful
despite a serious-minded, handsomely staged production at the Celtic
Arts Center.</LD>
<LD>   After a promising, spirited confrontation between the estranged
couple, and some well-scripted monologues from its heroine, the
long-suffering Constance (Karen Ryan) ends up taking a back seat to
the irresistibly magnetic presence of Oscar (Craig Aldrich). She all
but disappears for long stretches as Kilroy's play gets sidetracked,
rehashing territory covered in several recent dramatic portraits of
Wilde--his trial, imprisonment and tortured relationship with Lord
Alfred "Bosie" Douglas (Christopher Michaels).</LD>
<TE>   There's commendable complexity in Oscar's affection and pity for
Constance, but the woman herself remains an enigma, yielding no clue
as to her passions. Kilroy's theory about the central trauma of her
life is tacked on almost as an afterthought.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Wittrock's staging skillfully employs visually striking
elements from Japanese Noh theater, including silent, masked
attendants to assemble abstract sets from circular platforms. Amid
this surreal tableau, historical details are inseparable from
fanciful speculation (some of which strains credibility, especially
in attributing so much cunning and self-awareness to the shallow
Bosie).</TE>
<TE>   Notably absent from this grim treatment is the dazzling wit that
Oscar used to navigate his adversities. Very committed performances
don't make a sufficiently convincing case for the importance of being
over-earnest.</TE>
<TE>   "The Secret Fall of Constance Wilde," Celtic Arts Center, 4843
Laurel Canyon Blvd., Studio City. Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays,
7 p.m. Ends May 12. $15. (818) 760-8322. Running time: 2 hours, 15

<HD>Delfs Meets Mozart; L.A. Can Celebrate</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It happens every so often. The stars line up. A shaft of light. And
seemingly out of nowhere comes a bit of Mozart. Then, for a fleeting
moment, all can seem right in the world.</LD>
<LD>   Such is the moment. Thursday night the Los Angeles Philharmonic
began its two-week More Than Mozart Festival, and Amadeus addicts in
need of an extra strong dose might try a visit to the Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion on Sunday for a matinee repeat of the
Philharmonic's Mozart program followed by Los Angeles Opera's "Magic
Flute" in the evening. If you can stomach Tom Hulse as the cackling
boy genius, 20 more minutes of "Amadeus" were delivered to the movie
theaters last week.</LD>
<LD>   The Mozart portion of the Philharmonic's Thursday program included
two symphonies and concert arias; the "more" was the premiere of a
new piece by a young composer, Theodore Shapiro. The conductor was
Andreas Delfs, the Milwaukee Symphony's music director who next
season assumes the directorship of the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra. He
is new to the Philharmonic and impressive.</LD>
<TE>   It is often said that stick technique is not everything in a
conductor: There are any number of ways, some downright mysterious,
of communicating to an orchestra. But technique certainly helps, and
the first impression Delfs makes is of a conductor in thrilling
command of the essentials.</TE>
<TE>   He presided over a moderate-size orchestra (not period-instrument
small but by no means the full Philharmonic), energetically
urging--and spectacularly getting--flexible, exciting playing.</TE>
<TE>   The sprightly "Haffner" Symphony, which opened the program, was
fast and leaped forth with a spring in its step, a smile on its face
and a touch of attitude (maybe even a cackle or two). And it went by
in no time; Delfs doesn't have patience for many of the traditional
repeats that added to the sense of momentum.</TE>
<TE>   The heavier Symphony No. 40, which closed the program, was given
necessary additional weight but not very much. Again, there were a
deftness of touch, a rhythmic precision, a fine sense of dynamic
gradations, a sense that the Philharmonic could turn on a dime and,
most important, a flair for dramatic urgency that kept familiar music
fresh.</TE>
<TE>   There are conductors who flesh out slow movements more than Delfs
does. But the sheer magnetic vitality he gave to the pulsing eighth
notes in the Andante had the effect of a living heartbeat. Everything
was alive.</TE>
<TE>   Mozart has been good to the Philharmonic in other ways lately. Two
weeks ago, the orchestra borrowed the Tamino from L.A. Opera's "Magic
Flute" when a tenor scheduled to appear got sick. On this occasion,
soprano Andrea Rost--who sang the concert arias "Bella mia fiamma ...
Resta, oh Cara" and "Nehmt meinen Dank"--is the production's Pamina.</TE>
<TE>   In the first aria, Mozart's intensely emotional response to a
conventional text, the Hungarian soprano sounded pressed, a sports
car straining in too high a gear. But in the gracious, ever so
slightly feminist, second aria, she came into her own when she threw
in elaborate ornamentations in the second stanza.</TE>
<TE>   The eternal freshness of Mozart invites new music, especially
lively new music by young composers. Shapiro (pronounced Sha-PIE-row)
is just that, a 29-year-old who has already made a name for himself
in film (he scored the recent David Mamet films "State and Main" and
"Heist").</TE>
<TE>   For his 18-minute "Chambers," a co-commission from the
Philharmonic and the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra, the composer
originally meant the score as a response to his New York neighborhood
on Chambers Street and his move to Los Angeles for a year.</TE>
<TE>   He had intended it, he writes in the program notes, as a happy
portrait of the city in the first two movements and a fond look back
from his new home across the country. Sept. 11 happened just after he
moved West and married and just as he was finishing the work.
Fondness took on solemnity.</TE>
<TE>   "Chambers" shows why Shapiro has had success in film. His musical
ideas are more friendly than original--the snappy Scherzo movement in
the middle is "West Side Story"-like--he develops them with ease, and
he is a clever and skillful orchestrator.</TE>
<TE>   Pleasant melodic phrases colorfully presented in the first
movement are transformed in the last into suspended falling scales
which, with the help of glassy orchestrations, create the sense of
being suspended in space.</TE>
<TE>   That movement is effective moody accompaniment to something
unsaid, but I kept waiting for something to be said, some other
layer. The climax is the only overt reference to Sept. 11, and it is
nicely handled in a Mahlerian way, a surprise but also a release of
tension.</TE>
<TE>   Shapiro was lucky to have Delfs lead the premiere. The performance
was secure, alert and focused, generously giving the composer the
benefit of the doubt.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Philharmonic repeats its first More Than Mozart
program Sunday, 2:30 p.m., $12-$78, Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, 135 N.
Grand Ave. (323) 850-2000.</TE>

<DH>In L.A. for the Israel Film Festival, participants describe
the effect of violence and fear on their industry at home.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Israel Film Festival opened this week in Los Angeles during one
of the most frightening times in that nation's history--and one that
is having a devastating effect on Israeli cinema, according to
festival participants.</LD>
<LD>   During the last four months, ticket sales at Israeli movie
theaters have plummeted 35%, and the reason is brutally simple: With
no break in the intensity of deadly Palestinian suicide bombings,
there is a pervasive fear among Israelis of gathering in public
places.</LD>
<LD>   "In the cities, most cinemas are in malls, and they are
practically empty. Parents are afraid to send out their kids," says
Israeli director Dan Wolman, whose film "Foreign Sister" is playing
at the festival.</LD>
<TE>   Israel has experienced continual crises throughout its 54-year
history, but the present conflict is different. "We always had
soldiers fighting at the borders, or the shelling of our border
settlements, but now every day civilians are being killed in the
heart of Jerusalem, Tel Aviv or Haifa," Wolman says.</TE>
<TE>   Wolman is among 19 Israeli producers, directors and actors
participating in the 18th Israel Film Festival, which runs through
April 25 at the Laemmle theaters in Beverly Hills and Encino.</TE>
<TE>   The bloody strife between Palestinians and Israelis, known as the
second intifada, has been the dominant reality in the Middle East for
the last 19 months, yet it is barely reflected in the lineup of 31
feature films, documentaries and television specials screening at the
festival.</TE>
<TE>   On opening night, the featured film was "Late Marriage," winner of
nine Israeli film awards, including best picture. One reason for the
paucity of pictures reflecting the current situation is the lag time
between the conception of a movie and its completion, a period
ranging from one to two years in Israel. Transmuting the raw material
of a powerful historic event into cinematic veracity requires the
perspective of many years, filmmakers say.</TE>
<TE>   But more telling than the time constraints are the psychological
barriers, Wolman believes. "When such a traumatic thing [as the
suicide bombings] happens, it is hard to relate to them right away.
It's like survivors of the Holocaust who couldn't speak about their
experiences for decades."</TE>
<TE>   But some of the festival films do focus, if not on the intifada
itself, on some of the underlying Arab-Jewish tensions and
perceptions.</TE>
<TE>   This approach is more noticeable among the documentaries. One is
"Ramleh," which explores the religious, cultural and national
barriers separating Arab and Jewish women. "Whose Land Is It?"
centers on an Arab policeman and artist, who tries to organize an
exhibit by both Arab and Jewish painters.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, documentary filmmaker Ronit Kertsner is facing one
unusual problem. "I can't line up any film crews and cameras, because
they've all been hired by foreign news producers covering the
intifada," she complains.</TE>
<TE>   Wolman's feature, "Foreign Sister," examines the relationship of a
foreign worker, an Ethiopian Christian woman, and her employer. The
theme has an indirect link to the intifada, says Wolman, because it
was the growing distrust of Palestinian workers in Israel that
contributed to the large-scale importation of foreign men from the
Far East and Romania.</TE>
<TE>   "My film has to do with racism and our attitude toward the Arabs,"
he says. "I think it is my job to break stereotypes and to show Arabs
as human beings."</TE>
<TE>   One groundbreaking documentary, which was well-received by
Israelis, won't be shown to L.A. audiences. "The Inner Tour," an
Israeli-Palestinian co-production actually finished after the
outbreak of the intifada, presents a none too flattering picture of
Israeli life as seen through the eyes of a group of Arab "tourists."</TE>
<TE>   The film got a positive response at the Sundance and Berlin film
festivals this year, but it was not chosen for the current Israel
Film Festival by its founder and executive director, Meir Fenigstein.
The festival is also presented in New York, Miami and Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Fenigstein, who has presented difficult subjects and artists in
the past, explained that, "under present circumstances, I decided to
take a step away from too much controversy" and didn't include the
film in the festival lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Similar to most of their Hollywood brethren, Israeli filmmakers
are seen as lined up on the liberal side of the political spectrum,
and some of their ideas for future films dealing with the intifada
may raise the hackles of their more conservative compatriots.</TE>
<TE>   Eli Cohen, a leading Israeli director who is being honored with a
retrospective of his works at the festival, is writing the screenplay
for a comedy about the intifada. "The most powerful weapon against
fanaticism is humor," says Cohen, who is thinking in terms of a
"MASH"-like approach, "but a bit more politically oriented."</TE>
<TE>   He adds that he would like to collaborate on the project with a
Palestinian director, although "I'm afraid he can't make fun of his
own people as I'm willing to do of mine." But even Cohen thinks that
the subject is too touchy and immediate to set the film in the
current intifada, and he will probably transfer the era to the less
bloody first intifada of the late 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Wolman, Cohen, Kertsner and others agreed that there was no
pressure by their government, led by hawkish Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon, to produce "patriotic" films, nor has he tried to dictate the
subject or views. That is rather remarkable, because 70% of the cost
of Israeli feature films, from script development and production to
distribution and marketing, is borne by the Israeli government.</TE>
<TE>   The money is administered by an independent agency, the Israel
Film Fund, whose director, Katriel Schory, says that without such
government assistance, the small Israeli film industry, with a
limited domestic market and a negligible foreign one, could not
survive. There is a smaller fund for documentaries, which has
supported several projects by Israeli Arab filmmakers.</TE>
<TE>   Local production is overwhelmed by imports. "Of the 170 titles we
imported last year, 150 came from America and the rest from Europe
and Asia," says Schory.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, industry veteran Schory has seen a succession of
"waves" in the domestic movie output, initially consisting of broad
public or social issues, such as the Holocaust, Israeli relations
with Arabs and the chasm between religious and secular Jews.</TE>
<TE>   After the Oslo accords of the early 1990s, with their short-lived
promise of permanent peace, directors came out with pictures
centering on more personal hopes and problems. "Recently, we have
seen a wave of pictures located in the countryside, in small villages
and towns, often dealing with the lives of disparate immigrant
groups," says Schory.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a reflection that the vision of our founding fathers of
Israel as a melting pot society didn't work and that what we are
getting is a multicultural society."</TE>
<TE>   The Israel Film Festival: 31 feature films, documentaries,
television specials and student shorts, through April 25 at Laemmle's
Music Hall Theater in Beverly Hills, (310) 274-6869, and April 20-25
at Laemmle's Town Center 5 in Encino, (818) 981-9811. "Late
Marriage," voted Israel's best picture of the year, will screen today
at 7:30 p.m. at the Music Hall and again on April 24, as well as next
Saturday at the Encino location. For general information and advance
ticket sales, call (877) 966-5566. The full schedule is also

<HD>KMXN's 'Go Loco' Gets Local With Unsigned Bands</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The grass-roots music scene gets a long-absent boost in the form of a
weekly radio program focusing on unsigned bands when "Go Loco"
premieres Sunday night at 8 on Anaheim-based Super Cool KMXN-FM
(94.3).</LD>
<LD>   "There's just so much great music in Orange County," said the
station's new program director, Rand DeWitt. "Every time you turn on
the radio you hear Lit, No Doubt, the Offspring, Social
Distortion--the list goes on."</LD>
<LD>   Although DeWitt's list encompassed the punk and alternative-rock
bands that have been the county's biggest success stories in recent
years, he said that "Go Loco" will have "no boundaries." That means
roots-rock, blues, country and other genre groups will have a shot at
airplay on the four-hour segment, which will be hosted by deejay Sean
Thumb.</LD>
<TE>   Local music shows have appeared on Southland radio stations, but
they've mostly been on college or public stations, which makes the
move by commercial KMXN all the more unusual.</TE>
<TE>   Along with Thumb, local radio veteran Tazy Phyllipz will have a
featured segment each week, DeWitt said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be very music intensive," said Phyllipz, "without a
lot of talk." Phyllipz said the definition of "local" music that will
be covered will coincide roughly with the station's signal coverage
area, which means primarily Orange County, along with Long Beach,
some parts of Los Angeles and bits of the Inland Empire.</TE>
<TE>   The show was spawned by the success that KMXN's sister station in
San Diego, KSFD-FM (92.1), has had with a Sunday night local music
program in a market dominated by Clear Channel Entertainment-owned
91X-FM (91.1).</TE>
<TE>   "It's woken 91X up a bit," said DeWitt, who was assistant program
director at KSFD before coming to KMXN in February. "Now they're in
kind of a battle, and more local music is being played, which is
great for everybody.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be mostly the unsigned acts," he said. "But if [No
Doubt singer] Gwen Stefani wants to show up and bring us something
one week, we're not going to say, 'Sorry, come back Monday.'</TE>
<TE>   "What I think it's going to do is turn people back onto
radio....," he said. "The whole radio scene has been so homogenized
for so long, a lot of people have been turned off by it."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Miami likes its politics noisy and boisterous, like last year's
battle over the planned arrival of musicians from Cuba for the Latin
Grammy ceremonies. Threatened protests by anti-Castro exiles, you'll
recall, drove the ill-fated show out of South Florida with hurricane
force.</LD>
<LD>   But when it comes to compromise, in music as in politics, even
hardliners must be discreet.</LD>
<LD>   Consider the recently released album by Generoso Jimenez, the
renowned Cuban trombonist and arranger famous for helping create the
1950s big-band sound of Afro Cuban icon Beny More.</LD>
<TE>   On the surface, "Generoso Que Bueno Toca Usted" appears to be just
another album a la Buena Vista Social Club, with pictures of a
frail-looking "Tojo," as the 84-year-old Jimenez is known, playing a
scruffy relic of a piano. Recorded in Havana, the album features new
compositions from Jimenez in his classic style, performed by a
collection of 27 musicians listed on the back of the informative CD
booklet.</TE>
<TE>   The album's political bombshell lies silently within those
credits.</TE>
<TE>   Among the names, fifth and sixth on the list, are Arturo Sandoval
and Paquito d'Rivera, two of the most famous Cuban exile musicians.
The liner notes don't say how or why these two U.S.-based artists,
both veterans of Cuba's legendary group Irakere, turned up on a
record made in Havana. Especially one recorded at the Abdala Studios
of Silvio Rodriguez, an acclaimed singer-songwriter who's reviled by
critics as an apologist of the Castro regime.</TE>
<TE>   Surely there's no way they would have gone there. In Cuban
circles, a homecoming by these two would have been as newsworthy as
Henry Kissinger's secret Paris meetings with the Viet Cong.</TE>
<TE>   This is not the first time Cuban nationals and exiles have
collaborated on an album, but such projects are rare and have usually
involved recordings made in the U.S. with guests from the island.
D'Rivera, for example, was musical director on 1996's "Cuba Jazz,"
which was almost an Irakere reunion as it featured several former
members, including founder Chucho Valdes. That album was recorded at
Fantasy Studios in Berkeley for Ralph Mercado's TropiJazz label.</TE>
<TE>   But the new Jimenez project poses a stickier problem, because many
exiles have long advocated boycotting anything coming out of Fidel
Castro's Cuba. Sandoval's participation is particularly surprising,
considering the political hard line he reasserted recently in an
interview published in La Opinion. The jazz trumpeter, who defected
in 1990, vowed he would never "enter into any kind of arrangement
with anything which represents the government of Cuba, nor would I
ever play with an artist who represents the government of Cuba."</TE>
<TE>   In a written response Friday, Sandoval said he was unaware that
the album was to be recorded in Cuba when he was approached by the
German label Termidor. According to Sandoval, the German label
pitched the project as a tribute to Jimenez, whom he considers an old
friend and a victim of the Cuban regime.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't represent the Cuban government, he never has, never
will and the Cuban government has never cared about him," wrote
Sandoval, who since his exile had not previously recorded with an
artist from Cuba. "I was always in my heart participating in a
tribute to Generoso, who is a hell of a musician that deserves ALL my
respect. He has been left in the dark with out any help at all,
isolated in his country by the Cuban government who has never
recorded him."</TE>
<TE>   Juan Pablo Torres, a fellow Miami-based exile who produced the CD,
said he first discussed the new album with the retired Jimenez during
a family visit to Cuba. Though he declined to contradict Sandoval
directly, the producer says that he invited his fellow exiles to join
the project and that everybody involved knew it was being recorded in
Cuba. In fact, the album was designed from the start to include songs
written by Jimenez from Havana as tributes to his three exiled
colleagues: Torres, Sandoval and D'Rivera.</TE>
<TE>   "It's obvious where it was recorded, because that's where Generoso
lives," said Torres, who worked with Sandoval in Cuba as members of
the Orquesta Cubana de Musica Moderna, the precursor of Irakere.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever Sandoval knew, he now fully endorses the project.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't regret anything I did, and for him, I would do it again,"
the trumpeter said of Generoso in his message.</TE>
<TE>   It's true that Jimenez has not made an album in Cuba as a
bandleader for more than 30 years. But after More's death in 1963,
the trombonist led his own band for two years, and he made his debut
recording in 1965, six years into the revolution. That album, "El
Trombon Majadero," was recently re-released in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   On the new record, Sandoval recorded his trumpet parts at his home
studio in Miami, working from arrangements sent from Havana by
Jimenez. D'Rivera overdubbed his sax solos in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Politics was never an issue in the record, said Torres, because
Jimenez is such a legendary figure.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody wanted to be a part of this one, because Generoso is
the father of the Latin trombone," says Torres, who also plays the
instrument. "All of us who got together for this record became of one
mind, when it came time to make music."</TE>
<TE>   Even that lofty sentiment can have explosive consequences in the
supercharged Cuban political environment. Last year, Manolin, a top
star of the musical style known as timba, defected to Miami after
allegedly running afoul of Cuban cultural authorities. His offense:
recording a song that extended an olive branch to Cubans in Miami.</TE>
<TE>   On the flip side, peer pressure to toe the anti-communist line has
compelled exiled musicians to avoid any association with their
Cuba-based counterparts, considered lackeys of the Castro regime by
simply staying and working there.</TE>
<TE>   Celia Cruz refused to be photographed with Bamboleo when the
popular Havana band and its female lead singers visited the Queen of
Salsa in New York during filming of the video for Wyclef Jean's
version of "Guantanamera."</TE>
<TE>   And Cachao, the famed exiled bassist, missed a chance to appear on
1999's "Caravana Cubana" album because he refused to play on any cut
that featured invited artists from the island, according to producer
Alan Geik. Geik and others see the Generoso CD as a subtle sign of a
"wilting away" of these old Cold War animosities.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sort of like a gradual slide toward what we all know is
happening anyway," Geik says. "There's sort of a segue into
acceptance. It doesn't happen overnight. Things just get more and
more forgiving and, sooner or later, people just forget what the
issue was."</TE>
<TE>   A full and open cultural exchange would be a powerful boost for
Cuban music. The Afro Cuban event of the century would be a Havana
homecoming concert by Cruz, though that's not likely to happen soon.
For his part, producer Torres says he's working on new projects that
feature collaborations across the Florida Straits, including a new
album to be titled "Juntos Otra Vez," (Together Again). "I always try
to let music represent the most heavenly side of human nature," says
Torres, who communicates with his trombone mentor in Havana by phone
and e-mail. "I think this is a beautiful project, from here to there
and there to here. And may it reverberate to the benefit of
everybody."</TE>

<LD>The wonders of fatherhood might seem an awfully tame topic for
naughty-boy storyteller-comedi- an John Leguizamo. But in "Sexaholix
... A Love Story," his latest stage show-turned-HBO special (at 10
tonight), the devilish wit and goofily randy behavior remain
undiminished, even as he elicits sentimental tears.</LD>
<LD>   In the stage and HBO show "Freak," Leguizamo had offered a picture
of a spectacularly dysfunctional upbringing. This time, as he looks
back on squabbling parents, grandparents and aunts and uncles, he
wonders whether he's been given the proper tools to commit to a
relationship or to raise children.</LD>
<LD>   As always, his gift for mimicry brings these characters vividly
alive. Recalling childhood misbehavior with his broth- er, Leguizamo
adopts his father's bellow to threaten: "Look, if I have to come back
down one more time, it's going to cost you years off your life--and
I'm not talking about the crummy ones at the end."</LD>
<TE>   Also meant as a warning is: "Wait till you have children; you'll
see." But perhaps this is Dad's blessing, not a curse.</TE>
<TE>   Relationships keep going awry in adolescence (when Leguizamo hops
after a beautiful young woman as though his pants are down around his
ankles) and young adulthood, leaving him to the company of his
buddies, known since schooldays as the Sexaholix. (Taped live in New
York under Marty Callner's direction, the show is greeted with the
same clamor that it received during a brief run here in L.A.)</TE>
<TE>   When he finally meets a soul mate who broaches the topic of
children, Leguizamo blurts: "Kids? We don't need kids. We got me."</TE>
<TE>   Yet despite such pronouncements, he quietly indicates he's up to
the task.</TE>

<HD>Andersen Is Closer to Settlement, Sources Say</HD>
<DH>Probe: Talks with the Justice Department are centered on
wording of an admission of wrongdoing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Andersen and the Justice Department edged closer to a settlement of
the accounting firm's criminal indictment Friday, with negotiations
now centered on the wording of a proposed admission of wrongdoing by
the firm, according to people familiar with the talks.</LD>
<LD>   Such a deal would defer prosecution of the government's
obstruction-of-justice charge against Andersen for destroying
documents sought in the federal probe of Enron Corp.'s accounting and
subsequent bankruptcy. In effect, Andersen would begin a probationary
term during which it would be required to institute companywide
reforms and not commit new infractions.</LD>
<LD>   An agreement could be reached next week, according to people
familiar with the talks. It would avoid trial in the case, scheduled
to start May 6.</LD>
<TE>   People familiar with the talks said that in addition to the
wording there were other issues that could take some days to resolve,
but they did not elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the Justice Department confirmed that negotiations
were continuing, but they declined to comment on the likelihood of
reaching a settlement or when an agreement might be reached.</TE>
<TE>   Though Andersen sought a deferment deal last month, its legal
position changed significantly Tuesday when David B. Duncan, its top
Enron auditor, entered a guilty plea on a similar
obstruction-of-justice charge for document destruction. He also
agreed to cooperate with the government in its investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan's plea undermined Andersen's argument that there was no
criminal intent to obstruct justice, legal experts say, and the firm
apparently became more flexible in its talks with the Justice
Department.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has wanted to avoid entering a guilty plea because
federal rules generally block a person or company convicted of a
felony from auditing public companies.</TE>
<TE>   Progress in resolving the criminal indictment comes amid signs of
a rift within the firm.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen's leadership believes resolving the indictment is
critical to transforming the firm into a smaller, audit-oriented
business.</TE>
<TE>   Rank-and-file partners, meanwhile, want to see an orderly
dismantlement of the business that would leave them free to work for
other firms, said Allan Koltin, a consultant brokering deals between
Andersen partners and other firms.</TE>
<TE>   Many of these partners already are negotiating deals to take
offices and clients to other firms on the expectation that Andersen
can't survive much longer, he said.</TE>
<TE>   KPMG looks to be the beneficiary of a proposed agreement to
acquire large portions of Andersen's audit practice, Koltin
predicted.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen already has a signed memorandum to transfer half of its
tax practice to Deloitte &amp; Touche and another to sell the practice to
its managers and leveraged buyout firm Fox Paine &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Two second-tier firms, BDO Siedman and Grant Thornton, are
expected to pick up much of Andersen's mid-size company business,
Koltin said.</TE>
<TE>   All these agreements, however, must devise ways to deal with
claims against Andersen for its work for Enron and on other problem
audits.</TE>
<TE>   The accounting firms involved have not said how they will protect
themselves from the liabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Among the ideas floated are a sale of the firm through a
bankruptcy and the establishment of a restitution fund.</TE>
<TE>   Enron investors say they lost billions of dollars because of the
Houston-based energy trader's faulty accounting.</TE>
<TE>   Another issue is how much of Andersen's business will be left to
acquire. Rival firms already have won the business of its public
company audit clients.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen lost at least a dozen more clients Friday, including May
Department Stores, a $3.2-million account.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has lost about 200 public company audit clients since
December--about 10% of its business, and the rate of defections is
increasing.</TE>
<TE>   And its affiliations with 83 overseas partnerships has broken
apart. Those foreign offices are arranging their own mergers
independently.</TE>
<TE>   Koltin estimates that Andersen has lost about a third of what he
believes was once $4.5 billion in U.S. revenue.</TE>
<TE>   What's left of the business could sell for $600 million to $700
million, he said.</TE>

<HD>SEC Challenges Enron's Retention Bonus, Severance Plan</HD>
<DH>Courts: Agency wants to know who would share millions in
payments. Creditors, fired workers also file objections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday challenged a
retention bonus plan for 1,285 "key employees" at bankrupt Enron
Corp., saying the company must provide more disclosure to justify why
the payments of up to $130 million are warranted.</LD>
<LD>   Enron sought court approval for the plan last month but has not
named the employees to receive bonuses or said how much each would
collect, the SEC said in an objection filed Friday.</LD>
<LD>   A group of fired Enron workers and at least three sets of Enron
creditors also filed objections.</LD>
<TE>   A hearing is scheduled for Tuesday before Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez
in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   "They are seeking such a large amount of money and providing so
few critical details that there needs to be more public disclosure,"
SEC attorney Alistaire Bambach said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   After learning of the SEC's objection, Enron lawyers contacted SEC
staff Friday afternoon to offer further details of the plan, but the
conference didn't satisfy the agency, Bambach said. The key is for
Enron to state its case in public, giving names and dollar amounts,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC and the other objectors also criticized a component of the
plan that would protect 237 top employees from having to give back
any of the money they were awarded last year when Enron handed out
$55 million in bonuses just two days before its Dec. 2 bankruptcy
filing.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics believe those payments were an improper transfer of
assets--a "fraudulent conveyance," in legal terms--and should be
recovered for Enron creditors and shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   In proposing the new plan, Enron said senior managers possessing
"unique knowledge, skills and experience" must be kept to get maximum
value out of the energy company's remaining assets.</TE>
<TE>   Besides $40 million in retention bonuses to be paid out quarterly
through Feb. 28, the plan calls for an unusual "liquidation incentive
pool" to benefit 150 to 200 "select employees possessing the
requisite skill and expertise" involved in selling off Enron assets.</TE>
<TE>   Pool participants would share in $7.4 million to $90 million,
based on how much cash the assets generate. The rationale is that the
employees will work harder for a top price if their compensation is
tied to it, Enron said in its filing.</TE>
<TE>   An additional $7 million in severance payments is earmarked for an
estimated 842 employees not eligible for the retention bonuses.
Finally, about 700 of those participating in the bonus plan also
would receive severance from a pool totaling $500,000 if they get
laid off, according to the Enron filing.</TE>
<TE>   Dunhill Group, a collection of energy firms that are major Enron
creditors, said in its objection that Enron has become so tainted
that many of its workers are "otherwise unemployable, certainly not
at their present salary. Giving such a person an additional financial
incentive to stay employed with [Enron] is unnecessary."</TE>
<TE>   A group of 22 laid-off Enron workers, in its filing, lashed out at
Enron's official creditors committee for endorsing the bonus plan but
opposing additional severance packages for their fellow 4,500 workers
laid off last year.</TE>
<TE>   The creditors committee "appears to prefer to join in the
whitewash of past misdeeds than to assist thousands of innocent
workers facing enormous financial and personal hardship," the filing
states.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Enron nor the creditors committee responded to requests
for comment.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate action Friday, Judge Gonzalez transferred Enron's
$10-billion lawsuit against would-be merger partner Dynegy Inc. to
U.S. District Court in Houston. Enron sued after Dynegy backed out of
the deal, which was seen as a last-ditch chance for Enron to escape
bankruptcy.</TE>

<HD>State's Jobless Rate Climbs to 6.4% in March</HD>
<DH>Economy: California employers boost payrolls only slightly
as they continue to wait for clear signs of recovery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Signaling that the economic recovery has yet to reach the job market,
California's unemployment rate rose to 6.4% in March, matching the
five-year high set at the beginning of the year. Last month's rise
from February's revised 6.2% rate was the result of anemic job
creation. In March, California employers boosted their payrolls by
only a net 200 jobs, underscoring their continued reluctance to hire
workers.</LD>
<LD>   Overall, California's March employment figures reflected an
economy in transition, with employers hesitant to hire new hands
until they are certain the recovery has legs. The good news is that
California's labor market appears to have leveled off after losing an
average of 2,200 jobs a month in 2001. The bad news is that the
world's sixth-largest economy isn't creating many net new jobs, which
could lead to a continued uptick in the unemployment rate even as the
economy continues to improve.</LD>
<LD>   "We are in an in-between period," said Howard Roth, chief
economist with the state Department of Finance. "Employers aren't yet
convinced ... and committed to hiring."</LD>
<TE>   California's rise in joblessness reflected the nation's, which
grew to 5.7% in March from 5.5% in February. But while the rest of
the nation managed to eke out a small net gain of 58,000 jobs in
March, California's job machine appears to be at a virtual
standstill, with new hires by some companies canceled out by
continued layoffs at others.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing pulling us out of the slowdown," said Tom
Lieser, senior economist with the UCLA Anderson Forecast. "There is
no engine moving us forward."</TE>
<TE>   The jobs that are being added are mainly in Southern California,
which continues to outshine the hard-pressed Bay Area. Orange
County's March unemployment rate was 3.7%, unchanged from February,
and San Diego's rate likewise held steady at 3.8%.</TE>
<TE>   But it is the Inland Empire that is leading the pack in job
creation. Last month, Riverside and San Bernardino counties added a
combined 3,700 nonfarm jobs, putting the area nearly 34,000 jobs
ahead of where it was in March 2001. That 3.3% year-over-year growth
rate is the highest of any large metro area in California. It helped
push Riverside County's March jobless rate down to 5.2% from 5.5% in
February, while San Bernardino's rate dropped to 5.1% from 5.2% the
previous month.</TE>
<TE>   John Husing, an economist who studies the Inland Empire economy,
credits the region's growing population, affordable housing,
abundance of low-cost developable commercial land and pro-business
climate for the area's continued strength.</TE>
<TE>   "It's less expensive to live and do business here," Husing said.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Los Angeles County has about 42,000 fewer jobs than
it did a year ago, as its March unemployment rate rose to 6.7%, up
from a revised 6.6% in February. One piece of good news is that the
motion picture industry is showing some signs of life coming off a
tough year marred by runaway production and two threatened strikes.</TE>
<TE>   The state added 9,100 motion picture jobs in March--nearly 40% of
them in Los Angeles County--reflecting an increase in movie shoots on
local streets. Last month saw 723 filming days for feature films in
Los Angeles County, the highest since June, said Nancy Sidhu, senior
economist with the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "We're definitely seeing more white [movie] trucks around,
particularly in downtown Los Angeles," Sidhu said. "We have come part
of the way back."</TE>
<TE>   California's services and trade sectors were the only areas to
show net job gains in March. Transportation and public utilities led
the losing sectors with 6,900 job losses, while manufacturing shed
2,000 jobs, marking its 14th consecutive month of decline.</TE>
<TE>   The government sector recorded its first job loss in six months,
declining by 1,200 jobs. The state of California shed the most jobs
in March--800--reflecting a slowdown in the hiring of teachers in
some regions and government belt-tightening because of the budget
crunch, economists said.</TE>
<TE>   The Bay Area continues to bear the brunt of California's slowdown.
The jobless rate in Santa Clara County, the heart of Silicon Valley,
was 7.4% last month. That's slightly better than the 7.5% it
registered in February, but it's a far cry from the 2.2% jobless rate
recorded in March 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Younger Californians suffered the highest unemployment in March.
The rate for teenagers ages 16 to 19 climbed to 17.6%, compared with
4.8% for workers over the age of 25.</TE>
<TE>   The unemployment rate for blacks reached 9.7% in March, up sharply
from 9.1% in February. Latino unemployment increased slightly to 7.3%
from 7.2% the previous month, and the rate for whites edged up to
5.5% in March from 5.3% in February.</TE>
<TE>   San Luis Obispo County posted the state's lowest unemployment rate
at 3.2%. Colusa County reported the highest at 23.2%.</TE>

<HD>GM Takeover Could Be End of Daewoo in U.S.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Motors Corp.'s expected takeover of Daewoo Motor Corp. would
probably spell the end of the South Korean car maker's operations in
the U.S., a top American Daewoo official said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The deal, expected to be signed this month, would strand Daewoo's
525 U.S. dealers, about 160,000 car owners and about 8,000 dealership
and corporate employees.</LD>
<LD>   Gary Connelly, senior U.S. executive for Compton-based Daewoo
Motor America, said "there's every indication they are not including
Daewoo Motor America in the deal. It doesn't look good."</LD>
<TE>   GM has been negotiating for almost a year to acquire assets of the
troubled South Korean car maker. The deal on the table calls for GM
to take over assets that would help it gain a foothold in Korea and
expand its Asia-Pacific presence.</TE>
<TE>   Subsidiaries that don't advance those goals, including Daewoo
Motor America, are not on the list of units to be acquired, Connelly
said.</TE>
<TE>   GM officials declined to comment, but have in the past questioned
whether Daewoo had a place in the firm's U.S. strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Daewoo's U.S. dealers have formed a committee to deal with the
situation and this week retained Florida attorney Dan Myers to
represent them, said Kirk Kelley, general manager of Daewoo of
Cerritos. Myers also represents Oldsmobile dealers battling GM's
decision to discontinue that brand.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been misled for as long as these negotiations have been
going on," Kelley said. "There's a Daewoo dealer in Utah who just
celebrated the grand opening of his $4.5-million store."</TE>
<TE>   Many Daewoo dealerships are part of larger operations, franchises
paired with larger and better-known brands.</TE>
<TE>   But a number are expensive stand-alone sites. Daewoo of Cerritos,
part of a chain of dealerships owned by Bobby Colon, is one. Colon
has three other Southern California Daewoo franchises that together
employ 120 people. Most would lose their jobs if Daewoo Motor America
folds, Kelley said.</TE>

<HD>Gateway Advertising Campaign Inviting Legal Downloads</HD>
<DH>Internet: Computer maker's stance against anti-piracy
legislation draws fire from the music industry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SETH HETTENA</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The recording industry is having a cow over an ad campaign that
features a Holstein singing along to a hip-hop cover of a Gordon
Lightfoot tune.</LD>
<LD>   The cow singing "Sundown" is part of Gateway Inc.'s new campaign
taking a stand in the burgeoning battle over digital music. "Gateway
supports your right to enjoy digital music legally," the ad
concludes.</LD>
<LD>   On its Web site, the company invites visitors to download songs
and voices its opposition to anti-piracy legislation introduced last
month in the Senate.</LD>
<TE>   But the whimsical ad is no laughing matter for the Recording
Industry Assn. of America, which is trying to stamp out music piracy.</TE>
<TE>   RIAA's president, Hilary Rosen, accused Poway, Calif.-based
Gateway of engaging in "misleading scare tactics" and suggested the
company was acting in its own interests, not those of consumers.</TE>
<TE>   "If only they would devote a little bit of the millions of dollars
they're spending on this ad campaign to help stop illegal
downloading....But that wouldn't help them sell more CD burners,
would it?" Rosen said.</TE>
<TE>   The back-and-forth between the nation's No. 4 computer maker and
the recording industry trade group illustrates the battle shaping up
in the Senate over digital piracy.</TE>
<TE>   A bill introduced last month by Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.)
would require computers and other digital electronic devices to
contain a lock of sorts that restricts the copying of music or
movies.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents led by the entertainment industry say the protections
are needed to stop computer users from making unlimited copies of
songs and movies.</TE>
<TE>   But opponents, including Gateway, fear the measure would outlaw
all digital copying, including compiling favorite tunes or a slide
show on a compact disc.</TE>
<TE>   In response to Rosen's statement, Gateway spokeswoman Ashley Wood
said the company was trying to find "new ways to distribute music and
embrace legal digital technology rather than stifling it with
regulation."</TE>

<HD>JetBlue Stock Flies High in Wall Street Launch</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>JetBlue Airways' new stock soared into the wild blue yonder Friday,
with investors betting that the discount airline can keep confounding
the industry's poor economics and stay profitable.</LD>
<LD>   After the carrier's initial public offering was priced at $27 a
share late Thursday, the stock jumped $18 to $45 a share, a 67% gain
in opening trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The rally wasn't
entirely a surprise: The IPO was priced well above JetBlue's original
intended price of $22 to $24 a share, signaling that the stock was in
hot demand.</LD>
<LD>   But the scale of JetBlue's surge was somewhat reminiscent of the
dot-com craze of the late 1990s, when Internet IPOs routinely soared
and created instant wealth. New issues like that are now uncommon.</LD>
<TE>   JetBlue's stock also represents a rare airline IPO. The last one
was five years ago by Midway Airlines, which is now in bankruptcy
reorganization.</TE>
<TE>   Based at New York's Kennedy International Airport, JetBlue flies
to 17 other cities, including Long Beach and Ontario, and it has big
expansion plans. The 2-year-old carrier offers one-way fares as low
as $114 for transcontinental flights, yet provides leather seats and
individual satellite-TV monitors on its fleet of Airbus jets.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the airline makes money. While the rest of the U.S.
airline industry lost more than $7billion last year because of the
Sept. 11 attacks and the recession, JetBlue earned $38.5million on
revenue of $320million. The profit included an $18.7-million pretax
gain from JetBlue's portion of the federal bailout, but the carrier
would have been profitable nevertheless.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a relatively good track record, and in this environment
it's hard to find an airline that's doing well," said Betsy Snyder,
an analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Whether JetBlue and its stock can stay robust is another matter.
Even by stock market standards, airlines are notoriously risky
investments because the carriers have enormous costs that are fixed
regardless of the economy's health. Those costs, which are mostly out
of the airlines' control, include jet fuel and heavy borrowing for
aircraft that is subject to swings in interest rates.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the industry continues to lose money this year amid the
weak economy and higher jet fuel prices. (Oil prices fell Friday,
however, which helped lift airline stocks overall.)</TE>
<TE>   JetBlue is getting stiff competition on its routes from giants
such as UAL Corp.'s United Airlines and AMR Corp.'s American
Airlines.</TE>
<TE>   But JetBlue, led by founder and Chief Executive David Neeleman,
has bucked airline trends since it started in February 2000 and has
several advantages.</TE>
<TE>   Backed by such investors as billionaire financier George Soros,
the airline was well-capitalized with $160 million when it first took
off. (Its IPO, representing 14% of the carrier, raised an additional
$159 million.)</TE>
<TE>   The airline also has relatively low costs. It saves on training
and maintenance by flying one type of aircraft, has a nonunion work
force and sticks mostly to less-populated airports to avoid delays.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, many investors are comparing JetBlue to Southwest
Airlines, the leading low-fare carrier that also has a low cost
structure that enables it to stay profitable despite its cheap
prices. Southwest's stock climbed 92 cents, or 5%, to $19.26 a share
Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Another Losing Week for Markets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors nibbled at tech, telecom and airline stocks Friday, but the
mood on Wall Street was sober as the broader market wrapped up its
longest weekly losing streak in a year.</LD>
<LD>   The jitters about slack corporate profits and concerns about the
mounting violence in the Middle East that have slammed stocks in
recent weeks continued.</LD>
<LD>   "It's just a bounce-back," said Michael Vogelzang, president of
Boston Advisors. "It's been a brutal couple of weeks."</LD>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 14.74 points, or 0.1%, to
10,190.82, rebounding from Thursday's 205-point decline. The Nasdaq
composite index rose 30.95 points, or 1.8%, to 1,756.19, and the
broad Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index climbed 7.32 points, or 0.7%, to
1,111.01.</TE>
<TE>   Winners led losers 2 to 1 on Nasdaq and the New York Stock
Exchange. Trading was moderate.</TE>
<TE>   For the week, the S&amp;P 500 lost 1%. It was the benchmark index's
fourth straight weekly decline, a streak not seen since it fell eight
weeks in a row in early 2001. Nasdaq and the Dow both slipped 0.8%
for the week. It was Nasdaq's fifth straight weekly loss.</TE>
<TE>   Oil stocks dragged on the market after oil prices fell $1.52 to
$23.47 a barrel after Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, pressured by
the military, agreed to resign.</TE>
<TE>   Airline stocks rallied after a promising initial stock offering by
JetBlue Airways, which rose more than 66% in its first day of
trading.</TE>
<TE>   Economic reports Friday showed consumers kept spending in March
but only at a modest pace, and consumer sentiment dipped in early
April, in part because of the Middle East violence. Wholesale prices
surged in March, mostly because of the recent spike in energy prices.</TE>
<TE>   In other market news:</TE>
<TE>   * IBM rose $1.41 to $85.60, regaining some of the ground it lost
Thursday on a report that regulators were probing its accounting.
Investors breathed a sigh of relief when the Securities and Exchange
Commission said late Thursday that it had opened and shut a
preliminary inquiry into IBM.</TE>
<TE>   * General Electric fell 20 cents to $33.55 and was the most active
stock traded on the NYSE. GE slumped 9% on Thursday after posting a
rare drop in quarterly net income after charges for accounting
changes. Its revenue was weaker than analysts had hoped.</TE>
<TE>   * Telecom stocks rose, recovering from a severe beating in recent
days on worries that the sector will continue to be plagued by the
soft economy, price wars and weak demand. Wireless phone service
provider Sprint PCS jumped 73 cents to $9.96. The Amex North American
telecommunications index rose 2.5%.</TE>

<HD>Oil Prices Fall on Venezuela Power Shift</HD>
<DH>Energy: The benchmark drops 6.5% on optimism the unrest
will end and production will return to normal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Oil markets cheered the overthrow of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
on Friday, as the benchmark oil price fell nearly 6.5%, reflecting
traders' optimism that any new regime will end the turmoil in a
nation that is the United States' third-largest source of crude and
refined oil products.</LD>
<LD>   Chavez's resignation came amid labor unrest that had brought
Petroleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, to a near standstill. A strike by
oil workers and sympathizing union and nonunion workers had cut oil
shipments by half or more this week and was beginning to cripple the
Venezuelan economy.</LD>
<LD>   With Chavez out of power, analysts were optimistic that markets
will settle down and that production in Venezuela will resume its
customary high levels. In New York, U.S. light crude slumped $1.52 to
$23.47 a barrel, a five-week low.</LD>
<TE>   Market analysts said that, judging from market fundamentals, oil
prices were irrationally inflated and due for a decline. Friday's
price drop says more about easing market fears than the likelihood of
the new Venezuela government dramatically increasing oil production,
they said.</TE>
<TE>   "Venezuela is an issue but not enough to account for a $1.50 drop
in oil prices," said Chris Schachte, an energy analyst at GSC Energy,
a trading firm in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   But there was no doubt Friday of oil's importance to Venezuela's
economy and politics. Chavez's fate was sealed when he fired top
PDVSA executives and reshuffled the state-owned oil company's board
of directors, bringing in five members whose only qualifications
seemed to be that they were Chavez loyalists.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts were hopeful that, under a new president, the investment
climate for foreign oil companies in Venezuela will improve. Several
major companies have suspended exploration projects begun in the
mid-1990s when the Venezuelan government openly courted foreign oil
companies.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a total shock to the market. It became clear in the
last several days that Chavez wasn't going to make it, especially
when he started to lose the support of the military. In Venezuela,
that's not a good thing for a president," Schachte said.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Berges, Latin America investment strategist for Merrill
Lynch in New York, said Chavez's ouster was good news for Venezuela's
economy overall, which worsened considerably during the three years
that the populist, left-leaning ex-paratrooper was in office.</TE>
<TE>   Oil accounts for 80% of Venezuela's exports, while oil sales
supply more than half of the nation's revenue. The total output of
the Venezuelan economy is expected to shrink by 1% this year after
growing 2.3% last year.</TE>
<TE>   The Venezuelan currency, the bolivar, lost 30% of its value in
February, falling from 765 to the dollar to 1,110, after the
government abandoned a controlled devaluation policy and let it float
freely. The bolivar has since rallied to the 900 level.</TE>
<TE>   Economic problems caused Chavez's power base to weaken. "Consumers
don't like devaluations because it reduces their purchasing power,"
Merrill's Berges said.</TE>
<TE>   Confidence in their leaders shaken, Venezuelans increasingly have
been converting their savings to dollars and socking cash away in
offshore bank accounts. As a result, Venezuela's capital reserves
have dropped by $3 billion to $11billion since the start of the year.</TE>
<TE>   In a report issued Friday, Standard &amp; Poor's cautioned that
turmoil in Venezuela is not necessarily over and that any
transitional government may lack the "political clout to take the
necessary stabilization and structural reform measures needed to
reactivate the economy."</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, Venezuela averaged 1.28 millions barrels of crude oil per
day in shipments to the United States. In addition, the country sends
the equivalent of 400,000 barrels of refined products to the United
States, including gasoline that is crucial to the East Coast
wholesale market. It is the fourth- largest exporter of crude and
third- largest overall U.S. supplier of crude oil combined with
refined petroleum products.</TE>
<TE>   Shipments of gasoline from PDVSA refineries in Venezuela and St.
Croix in the Caribbean also had been slowed by labor unrest.</TE>
<TE>   Combining crude and refined products, Venezuela ranked behind only
Saudi Arabia and Canada as energy exporters to the United States in
2001.</TE>

<LD>In an unusually sharp and public display of displeasure with one of
Hollywood's most powerful talent agencies, the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences on Friday took Creative Artists Agency to
task for a full-page advertisement saying that 32 of its clients had
received Academy Award nominations when half of those listed weren't
nominated this year.</LD>
<LD>   The academy, in a full-page ad published Friday in the trade
papers Daily Variety and the Hollywood Reporter, called CAA's ad
"unprecedented" in Oscar history and said it was issuing the public
rebuke to foster "a return to scrupulous accuracy in awards-related
advertising in future years."</LD>
<LD>   Academy President Frank Pierson on Friday called the CAA ad
"wretched excess" and the latest example of the "hysteria" that
swirled around this year's Oscar campaigning.</LD>
<TE>   "We wanted to get it out that we don't like it," Pierson said.
"Maybe everybody should take a step back and think about what they
are doing during the Oscar season."</TE>
<TE>   CAA had no comment Friday about the controversy. But when asked
about the inaccuracies alleged by the academy, an agency
representative defended the ad as "celebratory."</TE>
<TE>   "We just like to celebrate our clients," the agency said,
according to the academy's ad.</TE>
<TE>   Vanity ads with congratulatory sentiments are a staple of the
Hollywood trade papers, but CAA's ad drew immediate comments.</TE>
<TE>   What infuriated many, from the heads of rival talent agencies to
rank-and-file academy members, was a March 22 ad in the Hollywood
trade papers in which CAA listed 32 clients who received Academy
Award nominations, but failed to mention that 16 of the people were
not nominated this year.</TE>
<TE>   Pierson said the academy, which zealously guards the image and
reputation of its awards, tried to deal with the problem quietly.</TE>
<TE>   "We protested and CAA had the opportunity to put out a letter
[apologizing], which they did not do," Pierson said. "So we thought
we should draw it to people's attention."</TE>
<TE>   He said "CAA was sorry that they had done it," but the academy, t
after waiting for a corrective ad to run, felt it had no choice but
to spend thousands of dollars to run its own ads in the trade papers.</TE>
<TE>   The non-nominees listed in CAA's ad included Ewan McGregor for
"Moulin Rouge," Marton Csokas, Viggo Mortensen and Liv Tyler for "The
Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Kristin Scott Thomas
for "Gosford Park," Ed Harris for "A Beautiful Mind," and John
Goodman and James Coburn, who provided voices in the Disney/Pixar
animated film "Monsters, Inc."</TE>
<TE>   Under "Best motion picture of the year," CAA accurately listed
director/producer Ron Howard and producer Brian Grazer, who took home
golden statuettes for their work on the Oscar-winning movie "A
Beautiful Mind."</TE>
<TE>   But CAA also listed as nominees Karen Kehela, a production
executive at Imagine Films (Howard and Grazier's production company),
and Sylvia Nasar, the author whose biography of Nobel laureate John
Forbes Nash Jr. formed the basis upon which the Oscar-winning
screenplay adaptation by Akiva Goldsman was written.</TE>
<TE>   Sources say Jeff Berg, chairman of talent agency International
Creative Management, was among those who called academy officials to
complain about the CAA ad. Pierson would not identify any of the
callers except to say that the academy was "getting quite a bit of
telephonic and e-mail protests from other agencies and from the
membership."</TE>
<TE>   In its ad, under the headline "Department of Clarification," the
academy addressed the Hollywood community at large, saying: "In the
past few weeks many of you have expressed puzzlement or concern about
the full-page trade ads run by Creative Artists Agency on March 22
congratulating a roster of CAA clients on having received Academy
Award nominations.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the artists listed in the ad were in fact 2001 nominees,
but many were not. Through the years both the academy and the
industry have taken considerable care not to allow inaccurate
information to be disseminated about which artists have been honored
in a particular year with Academy Award nominations and statuettes.</TE>
<TE>   "... It seems prudent to nip this form of enthusiasm in the bud,
lest CAA or another even more enthusiastic entity decide next year to
celebrate its clients by awarding several dozen of them not just
nominations but actual Oscars, or Congressional Medals of Honor, or
Nobel Prizes."</TE>
<TE>   Pierson said the academy plans to leave it at that.</TE>
<TE>   "I like CAA," the academy president said. "They're my agents."</TE>

<HD>Ovitz Is Target of $9.6-Million Suit</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Former head of mogul's now-defunct TV
company alleges fraud and breach of contract.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CORIE BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the latest of a string of setbacks for Michael Ovitz's
entertainment enterprise, the head of his ill-fated television
company has filed a $9.6-million fraud, defamation and
breach-of-contract suit against Ovitz and his companies.</LD>
<LD>   Ovitz is struggling to steady his core management company during
the current barrage of bad news. Three years after launching a
venture designed to leverage a star-studded roster of clients through
an array of companies in all facets of the entertainment industry,
his Artists Management Group is cutting back in an effort to survive.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit claims that Ovitz, a former Walt Disney Co. executive
and co-founder of Creative Artists Agency Inc., made "grandiose
promises" and "false representations" to Eric Tannenbaum when he
hired him to run the now-defunct Artists Television Group, a sister
company to Artists Management Group.</LD>
<TE>   Ovitz promised he would personally finance the television company
for five years and boasted of a "billion-dollar line of credit"
Tannenbaum could access as he built the enterprise from the ground
up, according to the suit.</TE>
<TE>   "The parties named in this lawsuit deny the allegations and are
confident that these claims will be determined to be legally and
factually meritless," Ovitz's lawyer, Terry Sanchez, said in a
statement. "Mr. Tannenbaum ran Artists Television Group from its
inception with substantial funding, and despite the efforts of many
people, ATG was not financially successful."</TE>
<TE>   After five months of on-again, off-again negotiations to settle
Tannenbaum's claims against Ovitz, lawyers for the parties spent much
of Thursday in last-minute talks before the suit was filed, according
to sources on both sides.</TE>
<TE>   The television unit officially shut down in August after two years
and a reported $100 million had been spent developing shows. Though
"Madigan Men" aired on ABC, "Cursed" on NBC, "The Street" on Fox and
"Grosse Point" on WB, none of the shows survived beyond their first
season.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit follows on the heels of this week's news that comedian
Robin Williams has fired AMG and returned to his former talent
agency, CAA.</TE>
<TE>   The move is a meaningful victory for the talent agency, which
three years ago broke off all professional contact with Ovitz's
management company after he lured Williams away from CAA. The cold
war between the companies has continued ever since.</TE>
<TE>   Also last month, StudioCanal, a division of Vivendi Universal,
backed out of its three-year multimillion-dollar pact with Ovitz's
film production arm, Artists Production Group.</TE>
<TE>   Ovitz's company, with no films in production, has yet to secure
another film financing and distribution partner.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Ovitz recently slashed costs and reorganized his
sports management division, ending a foray into managing hockey
players as well as an effort to establish a foothold in tennis.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, key sports manager Jill Smoller left AMG to join
William Morris Agency, taking clients including Pete Sampras and Rick
Fox with her.</TE>
<TE>   The co-heads of Ovitz's Los Angeles music management office left
this year as that unit cut costs and trimmed staff.</TE>
<TE>   Now, rather than the multifaceted entertainment enterprise he
boasted he was building in spring 1999, Ovitz's enterprise rests on
the talent management firm run by Julie Silverman Yorn and her
brother-in-law, Rick Yorn.</TE>
<TE>   Their clients, who include Cameron Diaz, Leonardo DiCaprio and
Samuel L. Jackson, along with Ovitz's clients, including Martin
Scorsese, Sydney Pollack and Oliver Stone, are the bedrock of
Hollywood's largest management company, which serves primarily
younger and lesser-known clients.</TE>
<TE>   In the lawsuit, Tannenbaum claims Ovitz lured him away from a
secure job at Sony Corp.'s Columbia TriStar Television in spring 1999
with promises of a minimum annual salary of $1.5 million and complete
control of his fledgling television company.</TE>
<TE>   "Ovitz represented that he had a $1-billion line of credit with
J.P. Morgan and that Ovitz was personally committed to the venture
... for a minimum of five years," the suit says.</TE>
<TE>   Executives with Ovitz's company said all other employee claims
associated with the television operation have been settled without
litigation.</TE>
<TE>   The dozen or more contracts with writers, producers and other
Hollywood talent have mostly been resolved, they said.</TE>
<TE>   According to the lawsuit, Tannenbaum's contract was different from
the other ATG employment arrangements because Ovitz guaranteed that
he would personally be responsible for covering the full five years
of his deal.</TE>

<LD>Retail sales rose a modest 0.2% in March, mostly on higher gasoline
prices, and producer prices rose just 1%, showing the U.S. economy is
expanding slowly but steadily.</LD>
<LD>   Consumers' views on the economy edged lower though, according to
the University of Michigan's preliminary monthly survey of consumer
sentiment, which fell to 94.4 in April from 95.7 in March.</LD>
<LD>   Retail sales would have been flat without gasoline, the Commerce
Department report showed. Excluding sales of autos, which fell 0.4%,
overall sales would have been up 0.4%.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>French media giant Vivendi Universal said Denis Olivennes had
resigned as chief operating officer of its pay-TV arm Canal Plus.</LD>
<LD>   Olivennes' departure followed weeks of tension between Vivendi
Chairman Jean-Marie Messier and Canal Plus management.</LD>
<LD>   Messier publicly criticized Canal Plus management last month,
complaining about the unit's poor financial performance and demanding
that it become profitable within two years.</LD>
<TE>   Canal Plus Chairman Pierre Lescure swiftly retaliated in an e-mail
to employees, saying Messier had fully supported the unit's strategy
in Italy that resulted in a $440-million cash drain last year.
Vivendi shares rose $1.36 to $32.95 on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>   The settlement was the largest civil agreement involving contracts
with the Office of Personal Management. The contracts provided
benefits to 9 million federal employees and their dependents under
the Federal Health Benefits Program.</LD>
<LD>   The Justice Department had accused PacifiCare and its predecessor
companies of violating the False Claims Act by basing its bills on
rates that weren't developed in accordance with U.S. regulations and
rating instructions.</LD>
<TE>   The Santa Ana-based health insurer, which didn't acknowledge any
wrongdoing, said it had set aside reserves to pay the settlement. A
release of excess reserves of $12.8million pretax will add 23cents a
share after taxes to first-quarter earnings, it said.Shares of
PacifiCare rose 86cents to $19 on Nasdaq before the news was
released.</TE>

<HD>3 O.C. Veterans Who Helped Open Death Camps Recall Pain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA BORGATTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ward Payne remembers the day his infantry unit walked through the
gates of Nordhausen, the Nazi concentration camp where inmates too
weak or ill to work were sent to die--not in the gas chamber, but in
bunkers and trenches where they would suffer slow and agonizing
deaths from starvation and disease.</LD>
<LD>   "This is what I saw," he said, tapping a finger on a photograph of
a ditch filled with mud-covered bodies, some living, some dead. "It
looked just like this."</LD>
<LD>   For decades, Payne kept his memories largely to himself. Only when
he got together with old wartime buddies would he talk about what he
had seen in April 1945.</LD>
<TE>   But Payne, 82, stepped forward to share his experience when he
spotted a small ad in a community newsletter seeking veterans who had
witnessed the liberation of the Nazi death camps. So did two of his
Leisure World neighbors--Theodore Frumes, 78, and Chester Kozik, 83.</TE>
<TE>   The trio, who had never met, were brought together by Lee Kobin,
the director of education at Reform Temple in the Laguna Woods
retirement community who placed the ad in an effort to find veterans
to chronicle the experience of soldiers who witnessed the opening of
the camps.</TE>
<TE>   .</TE>
<TE>   They will share their stories, which have been recorded and
filmed, with Kobin's congregation during a Holocaust Remembrance
program Thursday. Kobin said theirs is an American perspective not
often heard.</TE>
<TE>   "These men were called to wage a war on European soil," said
Marilyn Harran, director of the Rodgers Center for Holocaust
Education at Chapman University. "But their service must have never
had more meaning than the moment they saw these camps and realized
the responsibility to bring that kind of evil to an end."</TE>
<TE>   For Kozik, the experience grounded him in faith. He considered
becoming a priest. Frumes found new appreciation for tolerance and
democracy. Payne pursued a military career and went on to fight in
the Korean War, where he earned a Silver Star.</TE>
<TE>   Each has carried his memories quietly. "The people who were the
liberators and saw the atrocities of concentration camps are, in many
ways, also victims of the Nazis," said Esther Giller, director of the
Sidran Institute in Maryland, which provides education on post
traumatic stress disorder. "People from that generation, survivors of
the Holocaust and war veterans, often lived with the symptoms of post
traumatic stress--they just didn't tell you about it."</TE>
<TE>   Frumes, a husky man with a warm smile, is stoic when he talks
about the day his tank rolled up to Dachau, a notorious concentration
camp outside Munich.</TE>
<TE>   He recalls his confusion as he watched thin, almost ghostly
figures slip between the loosely chained gates.</TE>
<TE>   It was happenstance that the unit--the 9th Tank Battalion of the
20th Armored Division--arrived at the camp at all. The men were en
route to Berlin, where they were to meet up with Gen. George Patton's
forces. Freeing Jewish captives wasn't part of the mission.</TE>
<TE>   That's why members of the unit were stunned to see these men
shuffling past the tanks, heads bowed, their bodies draped in striped
uniforms with the yellow Star of David sewn on the shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   "I was puzzled," Frumes said. "The Army never told us anything
about the concentration camps."</TE>
<TE>   He asked in English what they were doing, but no one answered.
Then he heard someone ask for food in Yiddish, the language Frumes
spoke with his grandmother.</TE>
<TE>   The tank was loaded with 500 pounds of food--plenty to spare.
Frumes tossed the men boxed meals, lots of them. They disappeared
back into the camp.</TE>
<TE>   Later he learned it was the wrong thing to do. The inmates were
starving. They gorged themselves. Some died.</TE>
<TE>   Kozik had heard rumors about the concentration camps. In the
spring of 1945, he was a young soldier, a radio technician in the 4th
Infantry, full of curiosity. He stepped forward when his commander
called for volunteers to secure a small camp near the Germany-Austria
border.</TE>
<TE>   He remembers little about the camp itself, not even its name, only
that it was sparse, and the accommodations were crude. He was briefed
by an appointed member of the camp who spoke of the deplorable
conditions in which they had been forced to live, the inhumane
treatment, the deaths of so many.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, he and his buddies rounded up gifts to take the
women in the camp--stockings, chocolate and candles. Most of the
women were in their late teens and early 20s, and Kozik and his
comrades wanted them to feel young and pretty again.</TE>
<TE>   He remembers the women placing the candles on top of lockers in
the barracks. In the pale glow of the candlelight, everyone looked
surprisingly lovely given the grim conditions, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The women made the soldiers potato pancakes from supplies they
raided from the officers' quarters.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the details I remember," Kozik said. "That way, I don't
have to think about all the agony."</TE>
<TE>   Payne recalls the anguish. There was unspeakable suffering at
Nordhausen, he said, unmatched by anything he saw on the battlefield.
Bodies were everywhere. The living lay among the dead--they were too
weak to move their own bodies, let alone bury another.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a hell of a place. You can't get much worse," said Payne,
who had been injured earlier in the Battle of the Bulge and
eventually received a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star.</TE>
<TE>   Payne, a first lieutenant in the 9th Infantry Division, arrived at
Nordhausen a day or two after it had been liberated. His orders were
to transport any remaining guards to a detainment camp, but nothing
was said about a concentration camp.</TE>
<TE>   He saw medics removing bodies from the trenches and learned from
them what it was. "It just seemed so unreal to me," Payne said. "It
was so ghastly."</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, the experiences of Payne, Frumes and Kozik are as
important as the stories of the survivors. They are the witnesses to
the genocide, and they share an American perspective, said William S.
Parsons, chief of staff at the United States Holocaust Memorial
Museum in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "What they saw--it's a leap in the imagination for us, but here
are people who witnessed and saw the results, who stood inside the
camps and looked at what had been done," Parsons said.</TE>
<TE>   "They have all the eloquent phrases to depict the horror, and
still you hear them struggle and say there aren't enough words to
describe it."</TE>
<TE>   But as time goes on, the memories become distant and surreal.
Parsons doubts that the Holocaust will ever be forgotten. But he
wonders how it will be remembered. And he applauds efforts like
Kobin's to archive these experiences.</TE>
<TE>   "Remembrance is only one aspect," Parsons said. "The further you
get from the time the Holocaust occurred, the further away the
opportunity to hear these accounts becomes."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Police are investigating the slaying of a 21-year-old southeast Los
Angeles woman who may have been dismembered by her roommate,
authorities said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a very brutal homicide," said Capt. Richard Bonneau of the
LAPD's Southeast Division. "He may have dismembered the body,"
Bonneau said. Investigators were awaiting lab results, he said.</LD>
<LD>   Antron Singleton, 27, will be arraigned Monday on a capital murder
charge, with the special circumstance allegation of inflicting
torture in the death of Tynisha Ysais, 21.</LD>
<TE>   The woman's body was found Wednesday afternoon in an apartment
unit she shared with Singleton and her boyfriend in the 400 block of
East 108th Street near Figueroa Street.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors and police said Singleton, a rapper who goes by the name
"Big Lurch," was found staggering, covered in blood, about a block
from the apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Singleton may have been under the influence of drugs, police said.</TE>

<HD>Moorpark's Hopes Advance</HD>
<DH>Education: The high school team wins a key portion of the
national Academic Decathlon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Moorpark High School won a key portion of the brain-draining Super
Quiz contest Friday at the U.S. Academic Decathlon, bringing the
Ventura County powerhouse one step closer to recapturing the national
title the school won three years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Cheered on by a noisy contingent of parents, teachers and
classmates, the eight seniors and one junior who make up Moorpark's
team answered 31 out of 45 questions correctly on the public portion
of the Super Quiz--the only event in the two-day competition open to
the public.</LD>
<LD>   "I am stoked," said a beaming Julie Bristol, who was one of few
decathletes to answer all five of her questions correctly in the
fast-paced, game-show-style contest. "This is phenomenal."</LD>
<TE>   While a dramatic finale to this battle of brains and stamina, the
public portion of the Super Quiz counts for only 4% of a team's total
score.</TE>
<TE>   The winner of the 21st annual scholastic competition will be
announced at an awards banquet tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good omen," said Kara Bettencourt, one of Moorpark's two
coaches. "It means we can go to bed feeling confident."</TE>
<TE>   The Super Quiz involves two multiple-choice tests. Contestants
completed one exam earlier in the day, then fielded a second round of
questions in a ballroom packed with a wildly cheering audience of
more than 800.</TE>
<TE>   Moorpark's supporters were among the most vocal and colorful,
sporting sparkly tinsel wigs in green and gold--the school's
colors--painted faces and T-shirts that together spelled out the
school name.</TE>
<TE>   When students exited the stage, their contingent screamed and
whooped, holding up hand-painted posters of encouragement.</TE>
<TE>   "This is incredible," Moorpark Principal Anna Merriman said. "It
shows how much the kids are loved."</TE>
<TE>   Academic Decathlon, or "aca-deca," is the nation's premier
scholastic competition. The contest tested about 500 of the country's
brightest high school students in seven subjects, with topics ranging
from the poetry of Robert Frost in literature to continuous
probability distributions in statistics.</TE>
<TE>   In the Super Quiz, team members from each of 38 states competed
one at a time through nine rounds. Seated on a large stage under
spotlights, students punched answers to questions on an electronic
keyboard and filled out separate paper answer sheets.</TE>
<TE>   Event's Theme Is Internet and Society</TE>
<TE>   This year's theme was "E-communication: the Internet and society."
Students needed to know, for instance, that redundancy is a problem
to be solved in telemedicine technology and that corporate America is
the most enthusiastic supporter of a non-regulatory approach to
Internet safety.</TE>
<TE>   As the event wore on Friday, tension in the audience mounted; the
heat of competition rivaling the 95-degree outside temperature in
downtown Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Parents sat on the edge of their seats, nervously tallying points.
Bettencourt said she inadvertently chewed off the end of her pen as
she watched her students on stage.</TE>
<TE>   Moorpark was ahead by at least one question through most of the
event, trailed by Waukesha West High School in Waukesha, Wis., and
James E. Taylor High School of Katy, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Waukesha squad said their second-place finish was a
thrill. After five straight years of losing the state title to rivals
Catholic Memorial High School, they were happy with such a strong
showing at the nationals.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels pretty good to know we can play with the big boys even
though we're from the Midwest," said 17-year-old Ryan Ramlow, adding
playfully, "We're on to you, Moorpark."</TE>
<TE>   For the past nine years under head coach Larry Jones, Moorpark has
built a reputation around the state and nation as a decathlon
powerhouse. The school has made it to the state-level competition
seven times since 1993, and has come in either first or second over
the past five years. Moorpark won its first national title in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   This year Moorpark is again the team to beat.</TE>
<TE>   Preparation and Sacrifices</TE>
<TE>   Since last fall, seniors Bristol, Dean Reich, Michelle Kim, Johnny
Mendoza, Sheena Sidhu, Andy Song, Sergio Suarez and Jerome Yang and
junior Nathaniel Jones have spent hundreds of hours poring over study
materials, reciting speeches, writing essays and taking practice
quizzes.</TE>
<TE>   They gave up hobbies, sports teams and after-school jobs. But they
also formed strong bonds with each other.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a relief, but at the same time it's sad because it's all
going to be over soon," Andy said. "But this feeling will never go
away. It's amazing."</TE>
<TE>   So, what now?</TE>
<TE>   For starters, a combination of eating, celebrating and relaxing.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to not do anything," Lee said. "I would love to just
sit and stare at a wall."</TE>

<HD>Ahmanson Opponents Head for Company Meeting in Seattle</HD>
<DH>Land: The group plans to tell investors outside Washington
Mutual's shareholder session that the development will hurt the
bank's image.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forty opponents of the Ahmanson Ranch development will board a bus
for Seattle this morning, to protest at developer Washington Mutual's
annual shareholder meeting.</LD>
<LD>   Actor-director Rob Reiner, who co-founded the opposition group
Rally to Save Ahmanson Ranch, actress Alfre Woodard and environmental
crusader Erin Brockovich will meet the bus and other protesters
Tuesday outside the Paramount Theatre, where the Seattle bank's
meeting will be held.</LD>
<LD>   Actor Martin Sheen and politicians opposed to the project are
scheduled to meet up with the tour bus at stops along the way.</LD>
<TE>   In Seattle, project opponents won't chant or picket, but they will
be outside the meeting, handing out brochures and talking to
investors. They will argue that the upscale $2-billion town planned
west of Calabasas and north of Malibu in eastern Ventura County could
hurt the bank's image and, in turn, its bottom line--a contention the
developer rejects.</TE>
<TE>   The bus trip underscores how opponents' strategy has shifted in
recent months, from pressuring elected officials to curb the
3,050-home development to now trying to scare the nation's largest
savings and loan into dropping its foray into real estate
development. Project opponents say the bank should sell the property
as parkland.</TE>
<TE>   "They have focused a lot of time and resources on corporate
imaging and branding," said Mike Monasmith, a spokesman for Reiner's
group.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a great deal to lose if customers begin to have a
negative image of them as a corporate entity that conducts itself
without respect for the environment or the community's wishes," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   About 400 of the bank's 2,000 branches are in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Washington Mutual spokesman Tim McGarry said the project is a
national model for smart growth, placing a village center with shops,
offices and a resort hotel within a 10-minute walk or bike ride from
affordable and luxury homes. It also would offer on-site public
transportation, two golf courses and nine miles of hiking trails.</TE>
<TE>   "Washington Mutual is very proud of the ranch," McGarry said. "It
puts homes where they're needed. It makes sense for Southern
California and we're committed to bringing it about."</TE>
<TE>   On their way up the coast, protesters will stop at bank branches
in Thousand Oaks, Santa Barbara and Portland, telling customers
willing to listen that the project will add to sprawl, gridlock and
environmental damage in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   In response, Washington Mutual is making available at all bank
branches an open letter explaining the company's position. Turning
the land over to park agencies "would fly in the face of Southern
California's worsening housing crisis," the letter says.</TE>
<TE>   Project backers say they want to work with true conservationists
to address their concerns, but charge that many of the opponents are
simply NIMBYs or Los Angeles County officials frustrated that Ventura
County would draw the project's tax dollars.</TE>
<TE>   The Ventura County Board of Supervisors approved Ahmanson Land
Co.'s plans in 1992, after negotiations that set aside 10,000 acres
as open space. The Ahmanson Land Co. became a Washington Mutual
subsidiary when the Seattle-based company acquired Home Savings of
America in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The project had already survived a number of lawsuits and, in
1999, it suffered another setback when scientists for the developer
identified two rare species on the property, the San Fernando Valley
spineflower and California red-legged frog.</TE>
<TE>   The developer has proposed conservation plans for the species but
still needs final approval for those. The discovery also required a
supplemental environmental review by Ventura County officials.
Supervisors will be asked to accept that review later this year, but
at least one supervisor has indicated he wants to call for additional
study.</TE>

<HD>Politicians Toot Horns at Rail Corridor Opening</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a salute marked by brass band music and train whistles, about
1,000 dignitaries, community leaders and train aficionados gathered
at a downtown Los Angeles field Friday to launch a new rail
expressway that will enhance the flow of international trade in
Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   Among those on hand for the grand opening of the $2.4-billion
Alameda Corridor, which links local ports with downtown switching
yards, was U.S. Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta, who called
it "one of America's most significant transportation projects."</LD>
<LD>   After two decades of planning and five years of construction, the
20-mile-long railway came in on time and on budget, making it a model
of innovative financing, cooperation and good government, Mineta
said.</LD>
<TE>   The project's legacy extends beyond speeding the flow of cargo
from seaports currently handling $200 billion worth of goods a year.
A 10-mile stretch of its tracks hidden from view in a 33-foot-deep,
50-foot-wide trench, which eliminated more than 200 rail crossings,
is expected to ease traffic congestion and air pollution in six
cities.</TE>
<TE>   The project provided construction job training for 1,200
residents, 637 of whom were placed in union apprenticeships.</TE>
<TE>   The Alameda Corridor was funded by a mix of private and public
sources, and involved the cooperation of half a dozen political
jurisdictions with conflicting concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's going to wonder, 'How'd they do it?'" joshed Mayor
James K. Hahn. "This is going to be how to do infrastructure in the
future."</TE>
<TE>   Added Gov. Gray Davis: "This is a marvel of leadership and
vision--this is a big deal!"</TE>
<TE>   That is precisely why John Olguin, founder of the Cabrillo Marine
Aquarium, traveled from San Pedro and found a seat up front and
center in the bleachers facing a stage crowded with political and
business leaders. "This is yet another moment in history that will
make Southern California great," said Olguin, 81. "I compare it to
the development of the San Pedro breakwater in 1898."</TE>
<TE>   His wife, Muriel, said it reminded her of the seemingly fanciful
stories she heard as a student at Occidental College in 1941 about
"how they were going to build a freeway in Pasadena--and that there
were more to come."</TE>
<TE>   Then there was Wally Shidler of Walnut Park, who recalled a 1925
report by the California Railroad Commission. "It called for the
elimination of railroad crossings," he said, shifting his train
engineer's cap. "Well, they finally got around to it."</TE>

<HD>EPA Plan Would Stem Toxins That Flow Into Newport Bay</HD>
<DH>Goal is to open the highly polluted water to swimming by
2013 and fishing by 2019. Runoff, street sweeping and residents' use
of common pesticides may be affected.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some homeowners and nurseries probably will have to restrict or
eliminate their use of some common pesticides under a complex plan,
released Friday, that seeks to stem the flow of 14 toxic pollutants
into Newport Bay.</LD>
<LD>   The plan, made public by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,
also might affect how often streets must be swept and compel
businesses to keep contaminated water from running into storm drains
in an effort to clean the bay of pesticides and metals.</LD>
<LD>   Parts of the bay have been off-limits for swimming and shellfish
harvesting for nearly three decades. Plans to cut down on fecal
coliform and other pollutants already are in place. Officials hope
that those plans, combined with the new one, will open the bay to
swimming by 2013 and to taking shellfish by 2019.</LD>
<TE>   The plan for pesticides and metals must be finalized by the EPA
before taking effect. It affects cities, homes and businesses in the
bay's 154-square-mile watershed, which extends miles up the San Diego
Creek, through parts of eight Orange County cities, including Irvine,
Tustin and Orange. Within the watershed are three large wholesale
nurseries in eastern Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   The plan lays out how much of each pollutant the bay can handle,
and then allocates quotas to various sources, such as nurseries,
streets and residential areas.</TE>
<TE>   These pollution limits are the result of Newport Beach-based
Defend the Bay's lawsuit against the EPA, and are among the first
wave of more than 1,000 such plans throughout the state.</TE>
<TE>   "This is part of a consent decree filed in '96. It's been a long
time waiting," said Bob Caustin, founder of Defend the Bay.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just thankful they have taken the ball and established [the
limits] and given us something to work with," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal released Friday sets limits on diazinon and
chlorpyrifos, among other pesticides.</TE>
<TE>   Under EPA rules, most diazinon use is being phased out nationwide,
and chlorpyrifos use is being halved in coming years. However, the
plan says, " ... additional measures appear to be necessary to
achieve the reductions" needed to cleanse the bay.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Kiff , assistant city manager in Newport Beach, said that
it's possible the plan might prevent people in the watershed from
using pesticides or require them to find a way to keep the pollutants
from leaving their property.</TE>
<TE>   Nurseries have been gearing up to deal with the new limits for
three years, said Dave Kabashima, a University of California
environmental horticulture advisor in Orange County who has
coordinated nurseries' efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Some nurseries have installed computerized irrigation systems to
reduce the amount of water that runs off their property. Other
nurseries have planted canna lilies, whose roots will suck up excess
water.</TE>
<TE>   "They're very well prepared," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Other pollutant limits will probably affect public agencies. For
example, cities may have to increase street sweeping or install new
filters to stop copper shed from car brakes from entering local
waters.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, Newport Beach will have to deal with some metals and
out-of-use pesticides such as DDT that have been trapped in sediment
in the bay for more than half a century, possibly by dredging the
sediment out or by capping it.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal will be discussed at a public meeting at 1 p.m.
Tuesday at Newport Beach City Hall, 3300 Newport Blvd. Written
comments are due May 28.</TE>

<DH>Emergency: Chemicals fuel flames at South Gate plastics
manufacturer. No injuries are reported.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A huge chemical fire burned out of control Friday night, sending
flames and smoke billowing hundreds of feet into the air near the
Long Beach Freeway and quickly consuming an entire acre near a South
Gate plastics factory, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The fire started about 8:35 p.m. in plastic barrels at the White
Metal Products Inc., at 10520 on Sessler Street near Imperial
Highway. The flames appeared to be fueled by chemicals from residue
of the petroleum-based products in the barrels, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Many of the 55-gallon barrels exploded from the heat of the
flames, Los Angeles County Fire Inspector Mike Brown said. Officials
said they did not know how the fire started.</LD>
<TE>   No injuries were reported and no residents in nearby neighborhoods
had been evacuated as of 11 p.m., according to fire officials.
Residents were told to stay in their homes and keep their windows
closed.</TE>
<TE>   The intensity of the three-alarm blaze sparked explosions,
consumed several power lines and threatened a high-voltage line
directly above the fire site, said Brown. It also knocked out power
and water to much of the surrounding area and rendered fire hydrants
useless. Firefighters relied on water in their tanker engines.</TE>
<TE>   About 2,400 Southern California Edison customers in the South Bay
area lost power for about an hour, said Tom Boyd, an Edison
spokesman. About 400 customers in South Gate remained without power
late Friday, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The exploding oil drums and arcing power lines provided a hazard
to firefighters, Capt. Brian Jordan said, but he added that the fire
did not appear to be advancing on homes a few blocks away.</TE>
<TE>   The explosions, which sent huge fireballs into the sky, could be
heard every few minutes. Flames could be seen for several miles.</TE>
<TE>   More than 140 firefighters battled the blaze.</TE>
<TE>   "Flames were shooting up about 200 feet in the air," said Rafael
Yera, 44, who lives about half a mile from the fire. Yera said he and
his family heard several explosions and then began gathering their
belongings in case they had to evacuate.</TE>
<TE>   Lights flickered in their home, but they did not lose power, he
said. He said he was concerned about the effect the smoke would have
on his family.</TE>
<TE>   "If it starts blowing closer to the ground we may have to go,"
Year said. "I've been outside watching and now I can feel it in my
throat. It's a scratchy feeling."</TE>

<DH>Shooting: Siblings, family mourn Anthony Ramirez, gang
victim. LAPD arrests one.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anthony Ramirez and a cousin were playing on a grassy hill at the
edge of Trinity Recreation Center south of downtown Los Angeles when
three gang members began chasing and shooting at a rival, who had
been playing basketball in the park's gym, friends and relatives said
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   As the man ran out of the park around 7:30 p.m. Thursday,
8-year-old Anthony was shot in the chest, mortally wounded, police
said.</LD>
<LD>   Another bystander, Anthony Madrigal, 43, was shot in the arm as he
stood in his front yard across East 25th Street.</LD>
<TE>   Madrigal's wife, Erlinda, a nurse's assistant, was leaving the
house when she heard shots. She said she jumped out of her car and
ran to the boy, saw that he was breathing and applied pressure to his
wounds.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony's sister, Elizabeth Ramirez, 11, was playing soccer on the
other side of the small park when her brother was shot.</TE>
<TE>   "This boy came and said, 'Anthony got shot! Anthony got shot!'"
Elizabeth said. Her mother, she said, was washing clothes in their
apartment on nearby Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes later, stunned relatives followed the ambulance that took
Anthony to Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center, where he was
pronounced dead.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't get to touch him," said Adriana Ramirez, 18, his
stepsister. "We looked at him through the glass window."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday night, police arrested one of the suspected gunmen, Jose
Luis Romano, 18, on suspicion of murder.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony's relatives and neighbors continued mourning the loss of
the youngster Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony's father, Carlos Ramirez, squatted down in front of a
makeshift memorial of candles and flowers, his eyes filled with
tears. He held a blue sweatshirt that had belonged to his son to his
lips. He declined to be interviewed.</TE>
<TE>   About two dozen neighbors and well-wishers gathered around the
family. Some wept. An employee of an after-school program at the
park, overcome with emotion, rushed away from the site.</TE>
<TE>   "When something happens, it's always an innocent person that's
getting shot," Anthony Madrigal said. "This little boy was playing
and they got him."</TE>
<TE>   Adriana Ramirez said Anthony was a popular child who loved soccer
and video games. "He was really shy. All the kids liked him," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   The children's father, who lives in Phoenix and drove to Los
Angeles when he heard about his son, had been planning to move the
family to Arizona, where they had previously lived together,
relatives said.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad even told us this is a dangerous place, somebody's going
to get hurt," Elizabeth said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked how many children were in the family, Elizabeth answered:
"There was four, but now there's three."</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors and police say gang violence is a part of life here.</TE>
<TE>   Irene Acuna, Madrigal's daughter, said her brother, a gang member,
was gunned down a decade ago 20 yards from the spot where Anthony was
shot.</TE>
<TE>   One man, who declined to give his name, shouted expletives at a
group of Los Angeles police officers and members of the park police,
blaming them for not patrolling the park more often.</TE>
<TE>   Bryan Farias, 10, one of Anthony's cousins, listened to the man's
yelling. His brother had been playing with Anthony when the shots
were fired.</TE>
<TE>   "I know," he said, nodding in agreement. "They come when it
already happened.... My brother couldn't go to sleep. He was
Anthony's best friend."</TE>

<HD>Jews Remember Bulgarian Heroism</HD>
<DH>Ceremony: Members of an Encino synagogue honor a nation
that helped protect 50,000 from Nazi persecution during World War II.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To survivors such as Rabbi Haim Asa of Fullerton, it is one of the
great untold stories of World War II and the Holocaust.</LD>
<LD>   Fifty-five years ago, when being a European Jew was tantamount to
a death sentence, Asa had the good fortune of being Bulgarian. While
Jews from surrounding nations were being killed, the king, clergy and
people of Bulgaria chose to save their 50,000 Jews, despite the
country's alliance with Nazi Germany.</LD>
<LD>   Asa recalled that his businessman father was the first in his town
to learn that the Jews were at risk of being deported under pressure
from Berlin.</LD>
<TE>   "Some were already on the trains," Asa said. But his father and
others in the Jewish community began to call in favors, appealing to
everyone in power to save Bulgaria's Jews. The appeal went all the
way to King Boris III, who ultimately signed an order of protection.</TE>
<TE>   Asa recalled that the leader of the Eastern Orthodox Church in
Bulgaria announced: "I myself will lie on the tracks and not allow
you to be taken away from us." The prelate also offered every Jew a
baptismal certificate to prevent deportation.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been my dream for many years that the best-kept secret of
the Holocaust would become public knowledge," Asa said Friday. He
spoke at Valley Beth Shalom in Encino as the synagogue prepared to
honor the Bulgarian people, who risked their lives to save Jewish
neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   "Bulgaria is unique in that there were as many Jews after the war
as there were at the beginning of the Holocaust," said Beth Shalom's
Rabbi Harold M. Schulweis. The Jewish population of Bulgaria actually
grew during the Holocaust from 48,000 to 50,000, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Schulweis is a founder of the Jewish Foundation for the Righteous,
whose objective, he said, "is to recognize goodness." As part of the
synagogue's observance of Yom Hashoah, or Holocaust remembrance, it
held a Royal Shabbat Dinner Friday night to honor the Bulgarians.
Among the guests were the daughter of King Boris III--Princess Maria
Louisa--as well as the current leader of the Bulgarian Orthodox
Church.</TE>
<TE>   "The main reason is because we had tolerant people," the princess
said when asked why Bulgaria had saved Jews, while other nearby
nations had not.</TE>
<TE>   Now living in exile in the United States, Princess Maria Louisa
explained that the Bulgaria of her childhood was a mix of cultures,
including Turkish, Armenian and Gypsy, as well as Jewish.</TE>
<TE>   "These people all lived in harmony," she said. "They were
Bulgarians. No one pointed them out. If some went on Sunday to church
and others on Saturday to synagogue, that was their business."</TE>
<TE>   "There was no scapegoating," said Asa, who contrasted Bulgarian
tolerance with the tendency elsewhere in Europe to blame Jews for
their ills.</TE>
<TE>   "At Easter time, when Jews were hiding in their basements to avoid
pogroms, I was visiting my neighbors," he said, remembering how his
Christian friends shared a delicious braided Easter bread that
reminded him of Jewish challah loaves.</TE>
<TE>   A coalition of intellectuals, prelates, ordinary people and the
king formed to save the Jews, the princess said.</TE>
<TE>   As to why the wartime heroism of the Bulgarians is so little
known, she blamed the communists who came to power after Soviet
occupation in 1944.</TE>
<TE>   "For the communists, people like the intellectuals, the church and
the king were anathema, so they put a lid on it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She and other family members who survived the occupation went into
exile in 1946, when the monarchy was abolished. In 1943, at the age
of 6, her brother had become King Simeon II Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Last
year, he was elected prime minister of Bulgaria.</TE>
<TE>   She said she knew nothing of the plight of the Jews when she was a
child: "At the time, I was 10, and Father did not bring his worries
home to us."</TE>
<TE>   Children from the temple school presented Princess Maria Louisa
with a bouquet of roses, Bulgaria's national flower. Five-year-old
Shira Michelle Levin had practiced her curtsy and executed it
flawlessly for the royal visitor. Kosher Bulgarian delicacies were on
the evening menu.</TE>
<TE>   The princess said she always makes herself available for Bulgarian
causes. And she wanted to set the record straight.</TE>
<TE>   "Father has always been accused of running the country in the
later years with an iron hand," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "But the reason the Jews were saved was because of his name on a
piece of paper--no other reason."</TE>
<TE>   Boris III died unexpectedly in 1943 after a trip to Germany.
Hitler was reported to have had a heated meeting with the king, and
Asa and others believe the monarch was killed by the Nazis.</TE>
<TE>   "He left healthy--you can't say healthy as a horse because he was
a king--and he comes back 36 hours later, on oxygen already," Asa
said.</TE>

Nazis. Rabbi Haim Asa, right, was one of those spared persecution.</CP>

<HD>Laidlaw Goes Directly to Its Striking Drivers</HD>
<DH>Labor: Union leaders are upset as firm sends letters to
workers with their paychecks. Talks resume.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Labor talks resumed Friday between striking school bus drivers and
the Los Angeles Unified School District's main transportation
contractor, Laidlaw Education Services, after a determined effort by
the bus company to influence pickets.</LD>
<LD>   Teamsters Union Local 572 officials had planned a vote on
Laidlaw's latest proposal for as soon as Sunday morning. The union
leadership opposes that offer and hopes talks will lead to a better
one.</LD>
<LD>   A settlement would end the nine-day strike, which has caused
delays for the 20,000 schoolchildren along Laidlaw's 700 bus routes.
At least one school, the Brentwood Science Magnet, sent students home
early to accommodate the reduced bus schedule. Field trips and
sporting events also have been disrupted.</LD>
<TE>   The resumption of negotiations over the wages and benefits for 842
drivers came on the first payday since the strike began. Reflecting
work before the walkout, some drivers received only one day's wages,
minus union dues and health insurance fees.</TE>
<TE>   Accompanying those paychecks were letters from Laidlaw Vice
President Jim Ferraro outlining the company's position and settlement
proposal, which would increase drivers' wages an average of 6.3% each
year over three years. They now earn between $8 and $15 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not believe that your union leaders are acting in your best
interest," Ferraro wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Teamster officials complained that Laidlaw executives made an end
run around the local's negotiating team.</TE>
<TE>   Don Owens, a Teamster spokesman who flew in from national
headquarters last week, also accused Laidlaw of taking advantage of
the absence Friday of the head of Local 572, Rick Middleton, who was
on jury duty.</TE>
<TE>   Ferraro said he was only giving union members information their
leaders had withheld.</TE>
<TE>   Ferraro said many of the workers did not know that Laidlaw had
offered wage increases retroactive to Sept. 1. For some drivers, that
could offset the financial burden of striking for nearly two weeks,
Ferraro said.</TE>
<TE>   Owens said that he and other Teamster leaders were completely
forthright with their membership, and that they confronted Ferraro
and other executives at the company's Gardena bus lot to rebut their
arguments.</TE>
<TE>   The school district, which has its own in-house drivers and
contracts with other bus firms, has been using substitute drivers on
the Laidlaw routes. Still, in recent days, students have had to wait
an average of 50 minutes for a ride.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the school district has hired seven small bus operators
to ferry students to varsity athletic events next week in the event
that talks fail again.</TE>
<TE>   Although wages would be improved under Laidlaw's proposed
settlement, a relatively spare pension plan would remain the same.
Laidlaw is offering earlier eligibility for health coverage for new
hires: six months rather than a year. But the union says those
benefits need improvement.</TE>
<TE>   Laidlaw did not include those details in its letter to employees.</TE>
<TE>   The school district's transportation branch Director Antonio
Rodriguez said he hopes the talks are successful.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully they will reach amicable agreement that will be good
for both sides," he said, "so we can get about our business, which is
getting kids to school."</TE>

<HD>Davis Embraces Wilson's Tactics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's fitting that when Gray Davis flew to Los Angeles on Friday to
cut the ribbon on the Alameda Corridor, he came to celebrate the
opening of a project initiated under his predecessor in the
governor's office, Pete Wilson.</LD>
<LD>   The two dour career politicians share more than a penchant for
basking in the glow of a successful big-money project during a
reelection campaign--the corridor for Davis, the quake-damaged Santa
Monica Freeway in 1994 for Wilson. Davis has wholeheartedly embraced
the Wilson political playbook.</LD>
<LD>   The parallels go beyond the bland centrist personas of the two
governors and say a lot about California's surprisingly staid
political culture.</LD>
<TE>   Both are ex-military-men-turned-politicians, humbled by
devastating defeats who have gone on to become champion fund-raisers,
unpopular with their own party activists and in the polls, but
remarkably difficult to beat.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson ran for reelection in 1994 amid an economic downturn with
sagging poll numbers--the same spot Davis finds himself in today.
Both men launched preemptive attacks against their challengers before
the general elections began.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson faced the scion of one political dynasty whom he painted as
an extremist, the same tack Davis is taking with Republican Bill
Simon Jr., son of a well-known Nixon Treasury secretary.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson used the death penalty to paint challenger Kathleen Brown
as being out of touch with Californians; Davis is using abortion
against Simon. Wilson's razor-sharp consultants, as with Davis, were
the envy of the political world. Davis' brash chief political
strategist, Garry South, has cited Wilson several times in describing
the current governor's strategy.</TE>
<TE>   ''It tells you a lot about what the political system rewards,''
said UC Berkeley political scientist Bruce Cain. ''It rewards highly
disciplined candidates who are not very spontaneous and who are not
very charismatic or brilliant, but are shrewd, cautious and
well-managed.''</TE>
<TE>   There are certainly differences between the two men and their
campaigns. While Wilson launched preemptive strikes against his
challenger in 1994, they were not as relentless as Davis' campaign
against former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan in this year's GOP
primary. The $10-million Davis onslaught knocked Riordan out of the
running and set up a general election contest against the more
conservative Simon.</TE>
<TE>   And while Wilson was a proficient fund-raiser, Davis is in a
league of his own, according to most observers. Indeed, Wilson began
his reelection campaign $2 million in debt, while Davis has more than
$27 million in the bank.</TE>
<TE>   George Gorton, who managed Wilson's 1994 reelection campaign,
cautioned against drawing too close parallels, saying that Davis may
find the comparison useful. "It's a clever spin: Pete Wilson came
from 23 points behind, and we can too," Gorton said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, observers say the comparisons are valid.</TE>
<TE>   "Apart from a couple of issues, there's not a radical difference
between Gray Davis and Pete Wilson," said Jack Pitney, a former GOP
official who is a professor of government at Claremont McKenna
College. "Both of them are very tough politicians who run close to
the center."</TE>
<TE>   Wilson was pro-abortion rights and pro-gun control, like Davis.
Davis is a vocal proponent of the death penalty and relatively
cautious fiscally, like his predecessor. Those stances have created
tensions for both governors with the more activist wings of their
parties.</TE>
<TE>   Both men have decades of experience in California politics. Wilson
served in the state Legislature and as mayor of San Diego. A loss in
the 1978 governor's race did not deter him--Wilson became a U.S.
senator before winning the governor's office in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Davis served as former Gov. Jerry Brown's chief of staff before
becoming an assemblyman, state controller and lieutenant governor. He
lost the Democratic senatorial primary to Dianne Feinstein in 1992,
but continued to push his way up the electoral ladder.</TE>
<TE>   "They have both had the same career path," veteran Democratic
political consultant Bill Carrick said. "They have tremendous
fund-raising skills, the ability to put together a very broad
coalition of economic interests behind their candidacies and use it
to very aggressively define how the opposition is viewed."</TE>
<TE>   Carrick ran Feinstein's 1990 race for governor, in which she was
defeated by Wilson. He recalled that Wilson emerged from the GOP
primary low on cash, but swiftly began to pound the former San
Francisco mayor, alleging she favored quotas. Four years later he
trailed Kathleen Brown in the polls but went after her on the death
penalty and illegal immigration. Wilson won reelection in a
landslide.</TE>
<TE>   Now Davis is hammering Simon on his support of abortion and
opposition to gun control.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the Wilson game plan," Carrick said. "It's a very tough,
emotional issue that's difficult to counteract if perception is
you're on a different side of the issue."</TE>
<TE>   For all their campaign fireworks, neither man is known for his
personality. Davis, like Wilson, has a talent for relentlessly
sticking to the message--one that was on display Friday, when he
joined dozens of other politicians to celebrate the opening of the
$2.4-billion Alameda Corridor rail line. "The old saying that success
has a thousand fathers and failure is an orphan has never been more
true than it is today," Davis said in his speech. At a news
appearance a few minutes later, Davis virtually repeated the speech.</TE>
<TE>   The cautious centrist persona of Davis and Wilson--and to a lesser
extent that of the man who preceded them in the governor's office,
George Deukmejian--is the key to electoral success in massive
California, where candidates rely almost entirely on paid advertising
to sway voters rather than personal contact, Cain said.</TE>
<TE>   Institutional elements reinforce the centrism. California's
governmental system, with its array of commissions and propositions
demanding certain spending and preventing others, tends to limit the
powers of governors, said Pitney of Claremont McKenna. "There really
isn't much room for a governor of California to make a radical policy
change," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Add to that residents' traditional distaste for state politics,
and you have a recipe for dull elected officials, Pitney said.</TE>
<TE>   The moral of the Wilson-Davis parallels, according to Pitney?
"California's a lot more boring than people think."</TE>

<LD>Although citizenship will do little to change his day-to-day life, a
Mexican native and hospitalized quadriplegic on Friday achieved a
goal he set for himself five years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Candalerio Garcia became a naturalized U.S. citizen in the
activity room of his subacute care unit at Encino-Tarzana Regional
Medical Center in Encino.</LD>
<LD>   A hospital social worker, who helped him make the arrangements,

<TE>   Garcia, 44, has required nearly constant care since a 1995 car
collision in Temecula left him largely unable to move his arms and
legs.</TE>
<TE>   The native of Jalisco, Mexico, has lived in the United States
since 1983. Before his accident, he was a permanent U.S. resident and
a farm worker.</TE>
<TE>   Because of his injuries, he was unable to return to his job. About
two years ago, he was admitted to the Encino hospital for a
tracheotomy. He has been there since, unable to live alone because of
his medical needs, Ta said.</TE>
<TE>   ''I feel real happy,'' Garcia said on Friday, struggling for
breath. ''I live here.''</TE>
<TE>   ''Congratulations, sir, you are the newest American citizen,''
Fong said.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia said he hopes his citizenship will make it easier for his
three children, who live in Jalisco, to visit him. His son, 13, and
two daughters, 16 and 21, stay in contact by telephone.</TE>
<TE>   Several months after he arrived at the hospital, Ta began helping
Garcia with the naturalization process. In his motorized wheelchair,
Garcia would look for Ta several times a week, asking for updates
about his case, she said.</TE>
<TE>   ''I bugged her too much,'' Garcia said, smiling.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia, who is divorced, said he has no family in the United
States. The medical staff, many of the other 27 patients in Garcia's
unit and their families have stepped in to fill the void and were
with him to celebrate his U.S. citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   When someone asked if any family was present, Matilda Katz rose
from her seat and said, ''I'm here!''</TE>
<TE>   Katz, 67, the mother of another patient, arrived early to cut
Garcia's hair and dress him in a formal shirt for the ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   ''He's sort of adopted,'' Katz said.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Cop Faces Federal Trial on Sex Counts</HD>
<DH>Crime: Officer fired in Alhambra for allegedly molesting a
woman he pulled over is accused of civil rights violations after an
FBI probe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Alhambra police officer was arrested Friday on charges of
violating a female motorist's civil rights by sexually assaulting
her.</LD>
<LD>   Benny Marquez, 32, was taken into custody by FBI agents on two
criminal counts accusing him of acting under the color of law.</LD>
<LD>   A federal grand jury indictment said Marquez pulled the woman over
for a traffic violation during the early morning hours of Jan. 25,
2001, and during an ensuing exchange told her to choose between being
his "friend" or receiving several expensive traffic tickets.</LD>
<TE>   Marquez, a seven-year police veteran, was accused of fondling her
before letting her go without issuing a ticket.</TE>
<TE>   Later that day, the indictment said, he went to her home, forced
his way inside and tried to have sexual intercourse with her despite
her protests.</TE>
<TE>   The woman filed a complaint with the Alhambra police. Marquez was
relieved of duty and later fired following an internal affairs probe.</TE>
<TE>   His attorney, Dieter Dammeier, called the charges outrageous.
Whatever transpired, he said, was consensual.</TE>
<TE>   Last November, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office
declined to file charges against Marquez, citing insufficient
evidence. Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman, said a prosecutor reviewing
the allegations concluded that Marquez's conduct was unprofessional,
but that it was not clear who initiated the relationship with the
woman or if the alleged sexual acts were forced.</TE>
<TE>   Gibbons said the district attorney's office had explored whether
to charge the former officer with sexual battery and assault with
intent to commit rape based on an investigation by sheriff's
detectives.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, the FBI was pursuing its own probe of the incident in
collaboration with sheriff's investigators. On Thursday, a federal
grand jury returned an indictment charging Marquez with depriving the
woman of her civil rights under the color of law. The crime carries a
maximum statutory penalty of life in prison. Under federal sentencing
guidelines, however, Marquez would face much lighter punishment if
convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Dammeier said he was shocked by the federal indictment. He said
the Sheriff's Department had "tracked down every female they could
who ever had contact with Marquez and this was the only complaint
they came up with."</TE>
<TE>   He said the woman, a Chinese immigrant who speaks poor English,
flirted with Marquez during the traffic stop and exchanged telephone
numbers with him. At her home later that day, he said, Marquez and
the woman consensually kissed and fondled each other, but she became
alarmed and asked him to leave when she heard someone else in the
house.</TE>
<TE>   In January, the woman brought a federal lawsuit against the city
of Alhambra and Marquez for severe emotional injuries and distress.
The case was recently settled for an undisclosed sum.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Sugars, who represented the woman in the civil suit, said
she had initially agreed to go on a date with Marquez, but later that
day she called and told him not to come to her home. The officer
showed up anyway, made his way inside and forcibly tried to have
sexual intercourse with her, her lawyer said.</TE>
<TE>   "He wouldn't take no for an answer," said Sugars.</TE>
<TE>   Marquez is being held pending a bail hearing on Monday.</TE>

<HD>Irvine Requests County Backing to Buy El Toro</HD>
<DH>Development: The Board of Supervisors will be asked to urge
the Navy to sell the closed Marine base to the city. Financing
details are few.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Irvine officials will ask Orange County supervisors Tuesday to urge
the Navy to sell the closed El Toro Marine base to Irvine and allow
the city to take control of the property by Jan. 1.</LD>
<LD>   Details about how the city would buy the base were scant Friday.
In briefings with two supervisors, city officials said they want to
develop a 440-acre section that lies within city boundaries and use
the proceeds to pay for the rest of the property. County planners at
one time estimated the base's overall worth at a minimum of $3.5
billion.</LD>
<LD>   The 440-acre area, known as the panhandle, spikes southward from
the lower edge of the base to the San Diego Freeway. Unlike the rest
of the property, it lies in Irvine and is not subject to Measure W,
the initiative Orange County voters approved March 5, which rezoned
the base for a park, nature preserve and limited development. The
initiative was in opposition to county leaders' longtime plans for a
commercial airport.</LD>
<TE>   Supervisors Tom Wilson and Chuck Smith had different reactions to
the briefings on Irvine's proposal. Wilson said the plan had merit;
Smith called it "smoke and mirrors." Irvine officials will brief
Supervisors Cynthia P. Coad and Jim Silva on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Todd Spitzer, who backs Irvine's plan, asked county
executives to prepare a draft agreement for board approval Tuesday
that would allow Irvine to annex the base, now within county
jurisdiction. The Navy will dispose of 3,600 acres of the 4,700-acre
base; the remainder is set aside as a wildlife sanctuary.</TE>
<TE>   At least two drafts of the agreement were circulating Friday. One
called for Irvine to give up its fight against the county's plans to
expand the James A. Musick Branch Jail near Lake Forest in exchange
for annexation. Another provision was an agreement to share tax
revenue from development of the land between the county and Irvine--a
requirement before any area can be annexed.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine officials also need approval from the county for a more
immediate reason: They want to mount a united front when they present
their plan to Navy officials in Washington on Thursday. The county
Board of Supervisors is the only local entity that can recommend a
redevelopment plan to the Navy.</TE>
<TE>   Timing is critical because the Navy announced last month that it
intended to sell the base, and would make a formal decision April 23.
Four of the five county supervisors have met with Navy officials in
Washington in recent weeks to urge a delay.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said two Irvine officials--El Toro park planner Dan Yung and
City Manager Allison Hart--presented the El Toro plan to him and
Wilson but offered little more than an artist's rendering. Notably
lacking were details on how the city would pay for the base and
finance a park with museums, sports fields and other amenities.</TE>
<TE>   He said the Irvine officials want the Navy to enter into a
partnership in which the Navy would get paid as the property is
developed. Smith predicted that suggestion would be rejected by Navy
officials, who have said they want to use proceeds from the base sale
for the defense budget.</TE>
<TE>   "Given what I've seen, [the Irvine plan] is just pie in the sky,"
Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson said the city's redevelopment concept is "in the spirit of
Measure W" but differs in some ways, including discarding a limit of
96,000 vehicle trips a day for future base development.</TE>
<TE>   If the city annexes the base, the county initiative won't apply to
the city, though Irvine officials have pledged to follow the
measure's intent. A map of the panhandle area included in Measure W
showed it for "city of Irvine park-compatible" development.</TE>
<TE>   "The mission is to let the Navy know that [the Irvine plan] has
legs," Wilson said. "The objective is to get three or four
[supervisor] votes [for the plan]. I'd rather have four or five to
show there's no dissension. If the Navy sees fragmentation and
infighting, they may say ... let's just put it up for sale."</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Mayor Larry Agran said he is pleased by cooperation he's
seen since the March 5 vote in efforts to forge a new plan for the
base. More detail about how a sale would be financed and how
development would be funded will emerge Monday and at Tuesday's
supervisors' meeting, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everything is falling into place," Agran said. "Everyone
seems to be taking seriously the Measure W vote and our shared
responsibility to follow the will of the people. Everyone
acknowledges that Irvine is central to that. It gets down to the
details: How do you make this happen?"</TE>
<TE>   Among those who will urge supervisors to back Irvine's efforts is
the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority, a nine-city coalition of South
County cities that opposed the county's airport plan.</TE>
<TE>   "We're fully supportive of Irvine's direction and planning" on
annexation and its desire to negotiate a sale with the Navy, ETRPA
Executive Director Paul Eckles said.</TE>
<TE>   A continued wild card in the redevelopment plan is a proposal by
Marine Commandant Gen. James Jones to move the Marines' West Coast
boot camp in San Diego to El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   The boot camp, called the San Diego Recruit Depot, is wedged on
388 acres next to Lindbergh Field, San Diego's international airport.
Jones has proposed taking 1,300 acres of El Toro for a new boot camp,
with a commissary, post exchange store and medical facilities--a
popular notion among Orange County naval retirees.</TE>
<TE>   Coad put a proposed resolution on Tuesday's agenda in favor of
moving the boot camp to El Toro, which Smith said he'd support.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it would be great if they bring the Marines back," Smith
said.</TE>

<HD>Woman, 20, Dies When Hit by Train</HD>

<LD>A 20-year-old Camarillo woman died Friday when her car was struck by
an Amtrak passenger train in Somis.</LD>
<LD>   Nicole Laster was hit shortly before 2 p.m. at an unguarded
railroad crossing on a private road that runs past Hagle Tree Farm.</LD>
<LD>   The northbound Amtrak Surf--liner, which was carrying several
dozen passengers, was traveling approximately 70 mph when the
accident occurred, authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   The victim, authorities said, was returning home after visiting
friends in the Somis area when she reached the railroad crossing near
North Lewis Road.</TE>
<TE>   A farm laborer in the area saw the woman as she neared the
crossing and yelled out to her about the oncoming train, said Officer
Steven Reid of the California Highway Patrol.</TE>
<TE>   But the woman stopped her car on the tracks and turned to wave at
the man before being hit, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The crossing is posted with a red stop sign and a black and white
sign that indicates the crossing is private. Private crossings are
particularly dangerous because they lack the lights, bells and gates
required by law at public crossings.</TE>
<TE>   The impact of the train threw the woman from her silver Mitsubishi
Eclipse and demolished the car, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   It was the fourth death at a private railroad crossing in Ventura
County during the past three years, according to authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The site of Friday's crash was also one of four locations that
officials went to in early November to warn farm workers about the
dangers of unmarked railroad crossings.</TE>

<HD>Fraternity Defends Itself, Plans Injunction Appeal</HD>
<DH>Law: Sigma Pi says it started changing its ways after
parties led to a suit. 'We've just been singled out,' one member
says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANUEL GAMIZ JR.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The red-tiled Sigma Pi fraternity house looks nothing like the Delta
House of "Animal House" fame, but Long Beach officials have noticed
many similarities. Among them: loud music, littering, drunkenness and
urinating in public.</LD>
<LD>   The 30-year-old house fell silent this week after a judge issued
an injunction that threatened the Cal State Long Beach fraternity
with fines or arrest if it didn't tone down its wild partying.</LD>
<LD>   The frontyard was relatively clean this week, with the exception
of a few cigarette butts. Inside, two fraternity brothers slept late,
another played a Sony Playstation and the rest were at school.</LD>
<TE>   Dean Wormer would have been proud. Fraternity members compared the
injunction, granted Tuesday, to actions by the stubborn, fun-hating
dean from the 1978 National Lampoon classic movie.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not the only fraternity in the area," said Nick
Scarabosio, a 20-year-old Sigma Pi member. "We've just been singled
out. We do not have parties every night. We are college students, and
every once in a while we have parties to unwind. It's normal."</TE>
<TE>   Sigma Pi members said they started changing their ways in
December, when they learned that the city had filed a lawsuit because
of numerous complaints.</TE>
<TE>   After the filing, Sigma Pi's last party was only 30 strong, with
music provided by a small CD player, said 19-year-old freshman
Candice Toda. Lately, parties have been held at clubs to reduce the
number of complaints at the house. "It's been quiet here," said Toda,
who has many friends in the fraternity. "It's been hard to find a
good party to go to."</TE>
<TE>   Fraternity members plan to appeal the injunction, which may become
permanent when it goes before a Los Angeles Superior Court judge as
early as June.</TE>
<TE>   Sigma Pi is one of 35 fraternities and sororities--representing
about 1,500 students--affiliated with the Cal State Long Beach
campus. There is no fraternity row, and the organizations' houses are
located throughout Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Sigma Pi has more than 60 members, with 14 living at the house. It
is regarded by many as one of the more popular fraternities on campus
and, according to school officials, one of the smartest. Also one of
the rowdiest, said City Atty. Bob Shannon.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors have called police 168 times since 1997 and, during the
past fall semester, police made 12 trips to the Belmont Heights house
on East 4th Street. "The problem has existed for the past four years.
It wasn't a secret around here," Shannon said, pleased about the
judge's decision. "We got what we were looking for."</TE>
<TE>   Police resources are strained every time they go to the house, he
said, adding that each visit requires at least two squad cars and
five officers.</TE>
<TE>   One section of the injunction bars the fraternity from having more
than 30 members in the house at any time without a permit. Breaking
any portion of the injunction could result in fines and possible jail
time for members.</TE>
<TE>   Shannon said that the issue could have been resolved without a
court order but that the university did not view the problems as
seriously as the city did.</TE>
<TE>   "They could have failed to recognize the group as a fraternity,"
said Shannon, saying universities have taken that step in the past to
rein in problem fraternities. He said he is also keeping an eye on a
few other Cal State Long Beach fraternities.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Hostetler, the university's dean of students, said several
attempts were made to remedy the problem, including sending members
of the school's Interfraternity Council to help out at the Sigma Pi
house. No sanctions were placed against the fraternity because the
university never received any formal complaints from citizens,
Hostetler said.</TE>
<TE>   Scarabosio complained that "no one ever talks about the good
things that we do."</TE>
<TE>   Sigma Pi members volunteer two hours each week to clean the
neighborhood. The house also cleans a mile-long stretch of beach,
which it adopted awhile back.</TE>
<TE>   Many neighbors appreciate this side of Sigma Pi.</TE>
<TE>   "They really don't bother us," said 41-year-old Katie Cotter, who
lives on 5th Street, almost directly behind the house. "They've even
offered to help me with any household chores I might need."</TE>
<TE>   Cotter said a few parties spilled into the streets, but she always
remembers the streets being clean in the morning.</TE>
<TE>   Others, such as Mike Marsh, another 5th Street resident, were
pleased to hear the party was over.</TE>
<TE>   "Having a party and ending it at a reasonable time is one thing,
but then you have drunk people lingering around the streets," said
Marsh, a 47-year-old general contractor.</TE>

<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn said Friday that he wants to increase
the amount of money in next year's city budget for the fledgling
neighborhood council system.</LD>
<LD>   In a preview of one of his budget priorities for the 2002-03
fiscal year, the mayor said he is proposing to increase the
Department of Neighborhood Empowerment's budget by nearly $1 million,
and create a pool of $3 million in city grant money available to
neighborhood councils to pay for neighborhood cleanups, playground
equipment and planting trees.</LD>
<LD>   The neighborhood council system was approved by voters in 1999,
and the local groups began organizing this year.</LD>
<TE>   Hahn said that by next year he hopes 70 local groups will be up
and running. They each could apply for up to $50,000 in grant money
for neighborhood projects.</TE>
<TE>   "This is all happening because City Hall is changing," he said
during a visit to a San Pedro school to tout the funding increase.
"We're listening to neighborhoods."</TE>

<HD>Confidence Up as Jobless Rate Drops</HD>
<DH>Economy: Demand for farm workers lowers Ventura County
unemployment, and employers say they will keep hiring.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Ventura County economy continued to strengthen last month as
unemployment dipped, and analysts say confident local employers now
intend to hire many more workers in coming months.</LD>
<LD>   Buoyed by a seasonal boost in farm employment, the county's
jobless rate dropped from 4.7% in February to 4.6% in March, compared
with March figures of 6.5% in California and 6.1% nationwide, without
seasonal adjustments.</LD>
<LD>   There were 19,500 jobless workers locally last month, down 300
from the month before, as a strawberry harvest and other farm
activities accounted for nearly all of the 1,200 jobs added in
Ventura County.</LD>
<TE>   Compared with a year before, jobs were up 3,200 in March.</TE>
<TE>   "This is exactly what we expected to see--relatively slow growth,"
said Bill Watkins, director of the Economic Forecast Project at UC
Santa Barbara. "And a good part of it is seasonal agriculture."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Watkins said a new UCSB survey shows that
employers are growing increasingly confident that the economy will
improve.</TE>
<TE>   "The change is fairly dramatic," Watkins said. "The preliminary
surveys show a very large increase in people's perception of the
economy's performance in the coming months and the next year. And
they intend to hire."</TE>
<TE>   Final results of the UCSB survey of hundreds of businesses in
Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties will be released
later this month.</TE>
<TE>   The Central Coast area has fared much better than the state and
nation, and even outperformed bigger regions in a healthy Southern
California, Watkins said.</TE>
<TE>   The jobless rate in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties tied for
eighth-lowest of the state's 58 counties last month. San Luis Obispo
County had the lowest rate, 3.2%. Orange and San Diego counties
ranked third and fourth, respectively, and Los Angeles County had a
6.5% rate, the state average.</TE>
<TE>   "Overall, these numbers are very consistent with a slowly
improving economy," Watkins said. "And obviously, this region is
doing much better than the state."</TE>
<TE>   The local economy is riding out the downturn relatively well
because heavy manufacturing and Internet businesses, the nation's
weakest sectors, are not big employers in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest job gains last month were apparently fueled by a
robust strawberry harvest, which started in February and continued
into March. Farm-related employment increased by 1,100 in March,
after a 2,800-job increase in February. Farms employed 2,000 more
workers in March than in the same month last year.</TE>
<TE>   Nonfarm employment increased by just 100 jobs during the month,
with construction jobs off by 300 from February and down 500 from
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Manufacturing, hit hardest locally by the short recession, is down
700 jobs since March 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, parts of the economy related most closely to consumers
have done well. Restaurants and bars employ 600 more workers than a
year ago, auto dealers 300 more.</TE>
<TE>   And food production facilities employ 400 more workers.</TE>
<TE>   "This recession has been characterized by a lack of investment by
business," Watkins said, "and by strong consumer spending."</TE>

<HD>Leap From Bridge Kills Student</HD>
<DH>Death: A Cal State Long Beach senior and two friends take a
late-night plunge. Friends survive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARIOT LOUIMA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Cal State Long Beach student who had been drinking with friends
early Friday died after he jumped off a bridge about 30 feet above a
marina, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Rescue workers pulled Ryan Quintrell's body from Alamitos Bay
Marina at 5:25 a.m., more than four hours after he plunged into the
murky water.</LD>
<LD>   Quintrell, 21, of Anaheim, had been celebrating a good grade over
drinks with friends shortly before he and two other men jumped from
Davies Bridge in Long Beach, said Nancy Tabing, a Long Beach police
spokeswoman.</LD>
<TE>   Quintrell's friends were not injured, but the college senior,
known as a daredevil, died in the water. The cause of death was
undetermined Friday, Long Beach authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   "They thought it would be a good idea to jump from the bridge to
the waters below," Tabing said. "Unfortunately, it ended in a
tragedy."</TE>
<TE>   Quintrell's parents were at the marina at Pacific Coast Highway
and 2nd Street when divers pulled their son from the water.</TE>
<TE>   "He was cold. He had been in the water for so long," Beverly
Quintrell said of the youngest of her two children. "It was hard
looking at him. I hugged him and kissed him and told him I loved him.
But he was just so cold."</TE>
<TE>   Quintrell, a business major at Cal State Long Beach, wanted to run
his own company, said his father, Michael. He was also interested in
computer programming, and was a skilled surfer and snowboarder.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a pretty easygoing, good-natured kid," said Michael
Quintrell. "He was quiet, had a real good heart and was the first one
to reach out and give someone a handshake or a hug."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said diving from city bridges has become a regular and
dangerous pastime for some area teens and young adults.</TE>
<TE>   "It's illegal, but they think it's some kind of thrill," said
Lifeguard Chief Mark Boone of the Long Beach Fire Department.
Usually, he said, the stunt ends in chastisement by lifeguards who
patrol the waters.</TE>
<TE>   Beverly Quintrell said she did not know whether her son had jumped
from the bridge before. She said she could never have prepared
herself for the pain of losing a child who was so young.</TE>
<TE>   "He was an active kid," she said. "He made a bad decision last
night and it cost him his life."</TE>

<HD>John Wayne in the Black as El Toro Drain Ends</HD>
<DH>Aviation: For the first time since 1994, the county's
commercial airport gets to keep its surplus revenue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now that John Wayne Airport will no longer have to underwrite Orange
County's effort to build an airport at El Toro, it will be able to
keep its surplus revenue for the first time since 1994.</LD>
<LD>   John Wayne will be about $1.7 million in the black this fiscal
year, with a $7.8-million surplus expected in 2002-03, according to
county estimates. This year's surplus would be higher but for $4.9
million in remaining El Toro bills that must be paid.</LD>
<LD>   The surpluses will be used to replenish a capital reserve fund
drained of $54 million to cover El Toro costs over eight years. The
airport also will put $10 million yearly in a contingency fund.</LD>
<TE>   The end of El Toro spending is serendipitous, coming after
warnings by airport manager Alan Murphy beginning last year that John
Wayne's reserves were waning.</TE>
<TE>   In years past, John Wayne posted surpluses of $10 million to $15
million a year. But much of that was used for El Toro: Planning for
the former Marine base used $9 million of airport money this fiscal
year, a splurge that coincided with the Board of Supervisors adopting
a plan for an airport serving 18.8 million passengers.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Orange County voters scuttled that plan, overturning
airport zoning at the 4,700-acre base, replacing it with zoning for a
large park, nature preserve and limited development. John Wayne
Airport money may be used only for airport planning, according to
federal regulations.</TE>
<TE>   A week after the election, Orange County supervisors approved a
series of rate hikes for parking, shuttle buses and aircraft storage
at John Wayne to cover increased security and insurance costs, which
jumped $12.8 million since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The airport estimated it would have been about $50,000 in the red
by June 30 without the rate boosts.</TE>
<TE>   Even without the new security costs, John Wayne Airport couldn't
keep handing over money to El Toro in coming years, Murphy told
supervisors. Though one phase of planning was completed with the
board's adoption of the airport plan, design and implementation
likely would have increased the yearly financial drain, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It had reached a point where we couldn't give what we didn't
have," Murphy said. "Our [reserve] balance was slowly coming down."</TE>
<TE>   The county was able to take such large amounts from John Wayne
Airport because it had built up a huge cash reserve, he said. The
reserve was used to pay for capital improvements outright without
having to finance them--something that continued even with the El
Toro drain. For example, the county paid $28 million to retire some
of the bonds used to fund the airport's $300-million expansion in
1991.</TE>
<TE>   "No projects were put off because of El Toro spending," Murphy
said.</TE>
<TE>   With a new airport rejected by voters, county officials are
preparing to expand John Wayne. Supervisors approved limited growth
for the airport before the March 5 vote. The plan, which must be
accepted by the Federal Aviation Administration, calls for slightly
increasing the airport's maximum of 8.4 million passengers a year to
9.8 million. A court agreement that limits the size of the airport,
which expires Dec. 31, 2005, would be extended to 2015.</TE>
<TE>   El Toro planning manager Bryan Speegle had defended spending John
Wayne Airport money on El Toro as a wise investment, saying it was
worth risking the money because getting the land free from the
federal government would be so valuable. Now supervisors are
considering allowing Irvine to annex the property.</TE>

<HD>Let Kline Quit Race, Lawyer Urges</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A lawyer who launched a write-in campaign against an Orange County
judge accused of child molestation filed court papers this week
supporting the jurist's bid to withdraw from the upcoming runoff
election.</LD>
<LD>   Attorney Gay Sandoval, the runner-up among write-in candidates in
the March 5 primary, argued in the court filing that voters will be
hurt unless Judge Ronald C. Kline is allowed to drop his reelection
bid.</LD>
<LD>   "It is unfair to the voters to have on the ballot the name of a
candidate who does not plan to serve, even if elected," Sandoval
wrote.</LD>
<TE>   The attorney also argued that if Kline is allowed to drop out, the
Nov. 5 election should feature the two highest voter getters among
write-in candidates. That would include Dana Point attorney John
Adams, who won the election, and Sandoval herself.</TE>
<TE>   A Los Angeles County judge is scheduled to decide the matter April
24.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say more than 1,500 computer images of young boys were
found at Kline's home, including nude and "hard-core" photographs of
children having sex.</TE>
<TE>   Kline, 61, sat on the Orange County bench for six years until
criminal charges were filed against him last year. He continues to
receive his $136,244 annual salary as a judge, but a federal court
placed him under house arrest, saying he poses a threat to children.</TE>

<LD>   Michael Duarte, 22, was killed by officers after he ran from them

<LD>   The chase lasted two blocks from a Bank of America in La Habra

<TE>   Duarte's family has charged that the shooting was unnecessary.</TE>

<HD>Rep. Kennedy Settles Lawsuit by LAX Guard</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a settlement announced this week, Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy (D-R.I.)
has agreed to pay an undisclosed sum to a former security guard at
Los Angeles International Airport who alleged that the congressman
assaulted her at a security checkpoint in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Kennedy, the son of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), will
personally pay part of settlement to Della Patton of Los Angeles. His
insurance company will pay the remainder.</LD>
<LD>   "He felt it was his responsibility to own up and take
responsibility for this incident," said Jack McConnell, Kennedy's
lawyer. "He's saying that this is an unfortunate incident, and that
he's sorry it happened."</LD>
<TE>   Patton filed suit in Torrance Superior Court, claiming that
Kennedy "intentionally battered" her "with his hands and body" on
March 26, 2000, in an attempt to force his way past her at a Terminal
7 security checkpoint at LAX.</TE>
<TE>   The incident, which was captured on tape by two security cameras,
started when Kennedy tried to put oversized luggage through an X-ray
machine, said Patton's attorney, George Mallory. Patton and another
screener informed him that he would have to check his bag.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy pulled out his wallet and showed Patton his
identification. When she refused to let him pass, Kennedy "shoved her
and she struck the magnetometer," Mallory said.</TE>
<TE>   After the altercation, Patton suffered a "frozen shoulder" and had
arthroscopic surgery for "loose bodies" in her left shoulder, Mallory
said.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy, who eventually checked his bag on a flight to Boston, had
previously apologized to Patton and offered $25,000, which she
rejected.</TE>

<HD>What Would Students Do for a Chance at $50,000? USC
Pranksters Find Out</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The announcement went out at USC about on-campus auditions for the
reality-based TV show "College Fear Factor." And daring students
answered the invitation to swallow live goldfish and eat raw pigs'
feet, washed down with buttermilk.</LD>
<LD>   The danger of indigestion was offset by the prospect of prizes of
as much as $50,000.</LD>
<LD>   One of the fish-gulpers was freshman Diane Yanez, who told Daily
Trojan writer Shahien Nasiripour, "I'm looking for something fun,
something exciting."</LD>
<TE>   Alas, there is no "College Fear Factor" show. What Yanez and
others (mostly freshmen) got were real-life roles as victims of the
annual spring prank of USC's Skull and Dagger Society.</TE>
<TE>   The hoax was revealed before anyone dined on the pigs' feet and
buttermilk.</TE>
<TE>   Yanez, a good sport, said: "It was a cool prank." Besides, as a
wiser sophomore, she'll be able to enjoy next year's stunt from the
sidelines.</TE>
<TE>   A rich tradition: A couple of years ago, the Skull and Dagger
tricksters drew a crowd of excited students at USC when they
advertised in the Daily Trojan that a new "Star Wars" trailer would
be shown on campus. But the crowd had to move aside when a car
pulling a U-Haul trailer arrived with a sign that said: "Star Wars."</TE>
<TE>   On another occasion, Skull and Dagger held a campus memorial for
Traveler IV, the school's equine mascot, who was reported dead.
Eulogies were delivered, fight songs sung. Then a covered trailer
said to contain Traveler's successor came into view.</TE>
<TE>   Unknowing students cheered until a donkey stepped out. The beast
was wrapped in a banner that said: "Traveler IV is alive. Don't you
feel like an ass?"</TE>
<TE>   For golfers who need an extra excuse? Ray Gegenheimer of Rancho
Mirage saw a shoe ad evidently directed toward those who don't want a
good fit or peak comfort (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   No businessman's special here: Brad Lusk of Pacific Palisades
understood the "laser pointer" prohibition in the current L.A. Dodger
Magazine, but why the other laser ban (see accompanying)? People
cursing over the slowness of the printer (as I do at home)?</TE>
<TE>   Who cares how many vacation days you get? "I knew I went into the
wrong profession," wrote Chuck Klein of Ventura after seeing an
opening for an especially lucrative position (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Receptionist who won't take no for an answer: Susan Tellem of
Malibu was going to have a root canal, but her dentist decided to
send her to an oral surgeon, where more extensive work was performed.</TE>
<TE>   A few days later, her dentist's receptionist called to remind
Tellem of her root canal appointment. Tellem explained that it had
been canceled because she'd had surgery elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you sure?" the receptionist asked. Yes, Tellem responded, she
always knows when she's had oral surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "Hold on--let me check," the receptionist said. Tellem hung up.</TE>
<TE>   And, finally: Will Callis of Pasadena swears that in the hot
summer of 1961, the marquee of the Hollywood Paramount Theatre
boasted it had this on view: JOSHUA LOGAN'S "FANNY" COOLED BY
REFRIGERATION</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Joe Shea of Hollywood got a news release for a show at
the Zero One Gallery, which concluded: "Corner of Melrose and La
Brea. Ask for Henry at the Aaron Bros. parking lot to watch your car
if it's worth anything."</TE>

<HD>Spa for Stressed Steeds Encourages Horseplay</HD>
<DH>Equines 'with issues' go to a rehab ranch that uses
alternative therapies to raise their self-esteem. Goal for most is a
return to the track or show ring.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Life is simple at Goodenough Farms near Fillmore: the sweet smell of
orange blossoms, the beauty of a rugged canyon, the murmurs of an
attentive staff.</LD>
<LD>   It's a place to slow down and savor the moment, especially if
you're a high-performance horse a little down on your luck.</LD>
<LD>   There are no pokey little ponies on the idyllic 40-acre spread
described by its owners as a spa for horses.</LD>
<TE>   Most are magnificent jumpers, racehorses or polo
stars--super-achieving, Type-A equines that have pulled up lame,
grown long in the tooth, or for reasons unknown, been plunged into a
long, dark, lonely night of the soul.</TE>
<TE>   There's a beautiful neurotic filly who would barely allow herself
to be touched. Her owner would come up and read to her until she was
told that wouldn't do the nervous nag as much good as a romp with a
resident wild mustang. Now the two horses cavort in the pastures, and
the filly has settled in like a city girl at summer camp.</TE>
<TE>   There are the poor little rich horses, animals puzzled by the
concept of hay because they've dined almost exclusively on cubes of
compressed alfalfa.</TE>
<TE>   And there are the show horses that have spent most of their
nonworking hours languishing in stalls, losing touch with their inner
ponies.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a number of horses with issues," said Goodenough's owner,
John Lockhart. "We really have to teach them how to be horses again."</TE>
<TE>   Lockhart, a 42-year-old public relations executive, lives on the
farm with his wife, Wendy, their two young daughters, a miniature
mule, a llama, a few potbellied pigs and a platoon of cats and dogs.</TE>
<TE>   Lockhart's three dozen charges come from all over Southern
California. Some were abused animals rescued by horse lovers, and
others are ancient champs living out their last years in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Most are athletes that need a place to heal after faltering on the
track or in the show ring. After an average stay of three months,
they can hit the competition circuit again.</TE>
<TE>   New arrivals are greeted with a complimentary massage. A
chiropractor visits to tweak their sore backs. A dentist files their
teeth to a carrot-grating sharpness. An acupuncturist sticks needles
in their flanks, and a masseuse slowly traces small circles all over
their bodies while whispering sweet nothings in their ears.</TE>
<TE>   For about $400 a month, stressed-out steeds get everything but a
fluffy terrycloth robe and chocolates on their pillows.</TE>
<TE>   Lockhart still calls in the local vet for consultation, but
alternative therapies are the real draw at Goodenough.</TE>
<TE>   "We provide the arena for practitioners to practice their craft,"
he said. "But we try to make sure that the efficacy of the procedure
is apparent. The results have to speak for themselves, since the
horses can't."</TE>
<TE>   While Goodenough is unusual in pitching itself as a spa for Old
Dobbin, many places treat equine aches these days with a lot more
than liniment and a blanket. At layup farms and veterinary centers,
therapies that once were unorthodox have galloped into the
mainstream, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, the 6,100 veterinarians in the American Assn. of
Equine Practitioners were surveyed about their use of nontraditional
treatments. More than 40% occasionally recommended chiropractors, and
37% steered clients toward acupuncture, according to Sally Baker, a
spokeswoman for the Lexington, Ky.-based group.</TE>
<TE>   "These certainly are legitimate modalities when they're done by
someone trained in how to do them," Baker said. "I'm sure that 20
years ago you wouldn't have seen as many of these things, but they've
bled from human medicine over into the animal world."</TE>
<TE>   The effectiveness of some therapies, though, is an open question,
with experts pointing out that promising new treatments in the horse
world come as thick and fast as bettors at the $2 window.</TE>
<TE>   "Some work, some are completely bogus and others have a lot to do
with who's applying them," said Dr. Gregory Ferraro, director of the
Center for Equine Health at the UC Davis veterinary school.</TE>
<TE>   One recent afternoon at Goodenough, a skittish thoroughbred named
Victoria drooped in relaxation as Laura Stinchfield massaged her.
Victoria was listless. She had been mysteriously losing weight for a
couple of weeks, and now she was 60 to 70 pounds down.</TE>
<TE>   Stinchfield, an "animal communicator" who says she can listen in
on the thoughts of horses, cats and dogs, spoke of doleful vibes she
was picking up from Victoria.</TE>
<TE>   "She's just so sad," said Stinchfield as she practiced a caressing
massage technique called Tellington touch. "She says she's depressed
and she doesn't know why. It's not like she's mad at anybody or angry
about something. It's an internal thing."</TE>
<TE>   After an additional 40 minutes of massage and mental probing,
Stinchfield had a stabbing pain in her ear and thought she might have
homed in on Victoria's secret. "Could she have an ear infection? I'm
not sure if it's her or me, but sometimes I pick these things up."</TE>
<TE>   Lockhart said he'd give Victoria antibiotics after clearing it
with the farm's vet.</TE>
<TE>   Lockhart moved out of Los Angeles three years ago to find land for
his family's growing menagerie. An animal lover and a zealous
marketer, he seemed a natural for the horse-spa business.</TE>
<TE>   He has offered package deals--complete with limo rides--to
customers who want to pamper their horses at Goodenough and then
pamper themselves at a spa for humans 90 minutes away in Santa
Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   He also recruits speakers such as James Shaw, a tai chi master who
teaches Chinese martial arts breathing techniques to riders who want
greater control of their mounts.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an unseen connection you get with horses just by
breathing," Shaw said.</TE>
<TE>   "You can see the horse change. It becomes softer, its head lowers,
the motion feels bigger and rounder. You become one with the horse."</TE>
<TE>   But most of the action at Goodenough is in a dirt ring, where
Lockhart and his helper, Jaime Reyes, get stiff and uptight horses to
run with the ever-present dogs, to buck and kick and roll on the
ground.</TE>
<TE>   It's good for the back, good for the legs, good for the stomach,
and great for equine self-esteem, according to the folks at
Goodenough.</TE>
<TE>   "Just like kids on a playground," Lockhart said.</TE>

<HD>Parks Hires Lawyers to Fight Panelists' 'Smear Campaign'</HD>
<DH>Record: Of their public statements, he says, 'Whatever
faults I might have, one of them is not my integrity.'</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, lawyers in tow, lashed back Friday at
questions posed about his integrity by members of the Los Angeles
Police Commission, who voted 4 to 1 this week not to reappoint him to
a second term.</LD>
<LD>   Parks challenged public statements by some commissioners that he
had not been forthcoming and honest with them during his
reappointment interview on a pair of issues, one involving a
performance evaluation.</LD>
<LD>   Parks announced at a news conference outside Parker Center that he
has retained two lawyers from the law firm of Allred, Maroko &amp;
Goldberg, the firm of Gloria Allred, to help him defend his record to
the City Council.</LD>
<TE>   "Whatever faults I might have, one of them is not my integrity,"
Parks said.</TE>
<TE>   After Tuesday's commission vote, Parks is fast coming to the end
of his options for seeking a second five-year term. Although council
members say they will consider whether to hear from him on Tuesday,
the likelihood that they will overturn the commission's decision is
slim.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if Parks intended to take legal action, Parks' attorney
Nathan Goldberg said Friday that none was "contemplated at this
time."</TE>
<TE>   Pressed further, he said: "I'm not going to tell you what we will
consider or not consider."</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg called the commissioners' allegations against Parks "a
vicious smear campaign," attacking a man with "an unblemished career
who has never missed a day of work."</TE>
<TE>   During his 37 years with the Los Angeles Police Department,
including five years at its helm, Parks has sought to carve a
reputation built on personal integrity, invoking principle and
honesty in defending his policies, and demanding the same of his
officers through a strict disciplinary system.</TE>
<TE>   But in the final hours of deliberations on the chief's
reappointment bid, Commission President Rick J. Caruso said,
commissioners determined that Parks had tried, in essence, to mislead
them by citing an incomplete performance evaluation from 2001. The
review had been written by then-Commission President Raquelle de la
Rocha and never was approved by the full board.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Caruso had characterized the situation as a
"heartbreaking" turn of events that helped swing the vote against
Parks.</TE>
<TE>   Parks has countered that the problem arose from an honest
misunderstanding, not a lack of integrity.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso and other commissioners gave the following account of the
incident:</TE>
<TE>   Late Monday, in the final hours of what had been days of
deliberations, commission member Silvia Saucedo noticed that she
didn't have a copy of a 2001 performance evaluation to which the
chief had referred in written submissions.</TE>
<TE>   Commission Executive Director Joe Gunn said he didn't know
anything about it. Gunn then called De la Rocha.</TE>
<TE>   De la Rocha concurred that Gunn called late Monday "with one
question, 'Was [the evaluation] ever approved?' I said 'no.' And
[Gunn] said, 'Thank you very much,' and hung up."</TE>
<TE>   Caruso said that he and the other commissioners then concluded
that Parks had knowingly used an unapproved evaluation to sway them.</TE>
<TE>   Parks' account is similar to De la Rocha's. But he insists the
problem arose from an innocent mistake.</TE>
<TE>   Parks' account is that De la Rocha indeed told him that the
document had not been approved by the full commission in a phone
conversation about two months ago.</TE>
<TE>   But he claims he thought that she was going to work on it, and
that when he received the hand-delivered evaluation several weeks
ago, he assumed it was the result of her subsequent efforts and was
therefore an official evaluation.</TE>
<TE>   Parks said he had arranged for additional information to be
delivered to De la Rocha to aid her work in the interim--in
particular, a blank format for evaluations had been sent to her.</TE>
<TE>   He emphasized this point because he said it shows both that he
initially understood De la Rocha's evaluation wasn't finished, and
that he was under a false impression that she was in the process of
finishing it.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, De la Rocha questioned Parks' version, asking why he
would think she was in a position to finalize an evaluation when she
was no longer on the commission. She further noted that he had told
her the evaluation would be useful to him even if it was not
approved, since it represented her thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   However, in Friday's interview, De la Rocha for the first time
also allowed the possibility of a misunderstanding.</TE>
<TE>   'I am trying to reconstruct in my mind if [Parks] could have been
confused," she said. "I never told him three votes were required [to
approve an evaluation]. I assumed he knew that."</TE>
<TE>   De la Rocha explained that she and Parks talked on two occasions
in early February about several topics.</TE>
<TE>   One was a newspaper opinion piece she was writing for which she
needed Parks to send her materials. A second was missing pages from a
previous, official evaluation. And a third was the disputed
evaluation.</TE>
<TE>   De la Rocha said she told the chief that she had written the
evaluation but that it had not been approved by the full commission
and she wasn't sure where it was. She found it and sent it later.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, though, she was bewildered to receive a blank
evaluation format directed to her by the chief. She said she thought,
"Isn't that weird! ... What do I need this for?"</TE>
<TE>   As she looked back Friday, she said, that suggested there may have
been some confusion.</TE>
<TE>   But Caruso questioned how Parks, known for his encyclopedic
knowledge of the LAPD, could not have realized the evaluation had not
been approved, especially given that De la Rocha was no longer on the
commission.</TE>
<TE>   "It should be remembered: The chief is a very precise man," Caruso
said. "If anyone understands the rules and regulations and workings
of the department, I think it's the chief."</TE>
<TE>   De la Rocha said she wouldn't speculate on whether the chief had
lied, but added: "The facts are gray enough, you could go either
way."</TE>
<TE>   Friday's events were evocative of the imbroglio that followed the
end of Chief Willie Williams' term. Parks' predecessor threatened to
sue the city over his failed reappointment bid. It also harked back
to a controversy involving Parks and then-Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti,
in which the commission's inspector general produced a finding that
Parks had made misleading statements. The commission later disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn said he did not have any comment
on Parks' hiring of lawyers, but added that he thought the Police
Commission had given the chief a full and fair evaluation. The
evaluation, "raised a question in their minds, and I think it was
appropriate for them to comment on it," the mayor said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked Friday why he hired a lawyer, Parks answered: "I did not
think there was a need to get an attorney involved until I read the
paper the last two days and seeing the attacks on my integrity."</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg, his lawyer, questioned why commission members had not
confronted Parks about their suspicions during nine hours of
interviews with him before their vote.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso acknowledged that he confronted the chief about the
evaluation only after the vote.</TE>
<TE>   But since Parks had been told by De la Rocha that the evaluation
wasn't approved, "I'm not sure what more we were going to ask the
chief about it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso said Friday that he stands by his earlier statements in
which he questioned the chief's integrity. "I'd be more than happy to
reconsider," the evaluation incident, he added, "But it's not going
to change the ... vote."</TE>
<TE>   That's because other factors weighed against the chief, he said,
including his leadership of the department.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Rats and their droppings continue to turn up at a Los Angeles County
coroner's crypt, which one worker attributes to an ongoing problem
but the county says are merely leftover signs of a past infestation.</LD>
<LD>   "To my knowledge, there have been no live rats found inside the
crypt this week," said coroner's spokesman Craig Harvey. He
acknowledged that dead rats have been found.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, the coroner's office confirmed staff complaints that
rats had fed on a dozen corpses in its long-term storage crypt.</LD>
<TE>   But officials assured the public that the problem was eradicated
by an exterminator in February after droppings were found in the
external refrigerated building.</TE>
<TE>   A coroner's employee, who asked not to be identified for fear of
retaliation, said Friday that rat droppings were found in the crypt
again Thursday. "The rats are still there," the employee said.</TE>
<TE>   Harvey said the long-term crypt was emptied and thoroughly
scrubbed Wednesday. He also said workers had found a crack in the
wall, which was quickly patched.</TE>

will be penalized unless Judge Ronald C. Kline is allowed to drop his
reelection bid.</LD>
<LD>   Sandoval also argued that if Kline is allowed to drop out, the
Nov. 5 election should feature the two highest voter-getters among

<DL></DL>
<LD>Simi Valley serial rapist Vincent Sanchez "cuddled" one of his
victims and apologized for abducting her from a Woodland Hills
neighborhood and raping her at his Simi Valley home, a detective
testified Friday.</LD>
<LD>   After the assault July 10, 2001, Sanchez, 31, drove the victim
back to the Topanga Canyon Boulevard area where he kidnapped her. He
gave her a sweater to stay warm and asked for a kiss goodbye.</LD>
<LD>   The testimony was elicited by defense lawyers who have tried to
show at a preliminary hearing this week in Ventura County Superior
Court that Sanchez was calm and polite during attacks on numerous
women during the past five years.</LD>
<TE>   However, detectives have also testified that Sanchez used knives
and handguns to subdue his victims and threatened to kill their
family members.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez has pleaded guilty to 61 criminal counts in connection
with those assaults. But he has denied charges that he killed
20-year-old Moorpark student Megan Barroso during a rape attempt last
summer.</TE>
<TE>   The hearing is to decide whether prosecutors have enough evidence
to proceed to trial on the murder charge and seek the death penalty.</TE>

<HD>Source of Toxins in H.B. Still Puzzling</HD>
<DH>Environment: Restrooms are not to blame for high bacteria
levels that closed oceanfront. Situation is 'very, very disturbing,'
councilwoman says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Beach bathrooms are not the cause of high bacteria counts that forced
county health officials to close nearly a half-mile stretch of
Huntington State Beach this week, leaving officials with a mystery
disturbingly reminiscent of the devastating 1999 beach closure.</LD>
<LD>   That closure, which put miles of beach in the city off-limits for
two months during the height of the tourist season, also started with
mysterious spikes in bacteria levels. The cause has never been
determined.</LD>
<LD>   Testing Thursday and Friday ruled out three public bathrooms on
the beach near Magnolia Street as sources.</LD>
<TE>   "All preliminary information is that we do not have any leaking
sewer lines at any of the three locations," said Don Ito.</TE>
<TE>   He is state parks superintendent in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators still need on Monday to check two short lines that
hook into the sanitation district's sewer system, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Regional water officials might ask for more ocean monitoring to
determine whether a sewage plume released more than four miles
offshore is drifting back to the coast, said Monica Mazur.</TE>
<TE>   She is a spokeswoman for the Orange County Health Care Agency.</TE>
<TE>   A massive sewer line that runs along the beach will probably be
retested, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Sanitation District has long maintained that its
partly treated sewage is trapped offshore by differences in ocean
temperatures.</TE>
<TE>   But a recent study by Scripps Institute of Oceanography and UC
Irvine found otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   "That is very, very disturbing," Huntington Beach Councilwoman
Shirley S. Dettloff said of the latest closure.</TE>
<TE>   "What is for me the most distressing part of this is we've done so
much to try to find out what the sources are and we've done so many
things so we won't have a problem," said Dettloff.</TE>
<TE>   She also is a member of the Coastal Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The city, county, Orange County Sanitation District and other
agencies have spent millions of dollars studying the city's coast.</TE>
<TE>   Millions of gallons of urban runoff are being diverted.</TE>

<LD>The Los Angeles City Council on Friday agreed to establish an annual
billboard fee to pay for the inventory and inspection of signs in the
city.</LD>
<LD>   The fee--set at $477 per sign--will cover the costs of creating a
citywide list of billboards in an effort to identify illegal signs.
Under the plan approved by the council, sign owners will be required
to affix a certificate to each billboard.</LD>
<LD>   "The first phase of this four-year program will immediately
improve our ability to enforce the law and crack down on illegal
billboards," said Councilman Jack Weiss, who pushed for the fee.</LD>

<HD>Rooftop Energy at Postal Facility</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most employees at the U.S. Postal Service's Marina del Rey processing
center didn't even notice when their workplace became a pioneer of
energy technology.</LD>
<LD>   Installed in just two weeks, a roof-mounted solar-energy system
the size of a football field has made the Marina Mail Processing and
Distribution Center home to what officials say is the country's
largest such installation on a federal building.</LD>
<LD>   Postal officials said they chose the new array, unveiled Friday,
because of city Department of Water and Power incentives to install
systems manufactured in Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   The Postal Service paid only $225,000 of the $1 million it cost to
install and connect the system, which uses about 1,000 photovoltaic
cells manufactured at the Siemens &amp; Shell Solar/PowerLight plant in
Chatsworth. The remainder will be covered through subsidies from the
DWP and state Department of Energy.</TE>
<TE>   The 127-kilowatt system will generate about 10% of the building's
power and be a demonstration project for the Postal Service to
determine if similar ones will be installed at the state's other
processing centers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just getting warm and fuzzy about the environment," said
Ray Levinson, environmental compliance coordinator for the Postal
Service's Pacific region. "We want to do good things, but they have
to be feasible."</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, whose district includes the postal
facility and a Neutrogena plant that was the city's first
solar-powered commercial building, and state Sen. Debra Bowen
(D-Marina del Rey) praised the Postal Service's initiative.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody has to be the early adopter," said Bowen, chairwoman of
the state Senate Energy Committee. "Ten years from now, the vision is
that this won't be an isolated incident. This will be the norm in
building practices."</TE>
<TE>   The DWP pays customers up to $6 per solar-produced watt if the
system is manufactured in Los Angeles, which company officials said
can offset installation costs by 75%. The department's usual
incentive for solar energy is $3 per watt.</TE>
<TE>   It can take up to 15 years for lower utility bills to offset a
system's installation cost, although Levinson expects to recoup in
eight years the cost of the system at the processing center, where
the utility bill averages $60,000 per month.</TE>
<TE>   Although the initial investment is costly, a DWP official compared
the concept to buying a house rather than renting one.</TE>
<TE>   "Energy costs continue to rise, just like rental costs," said
Angelina Galiteva, executive director of strategic planning. "The sun
is always going to be there, and it will always be free."</TE>
<TE>   Camarillo-based Siemens &amp; Shell, which makes the cells, and
Berkeley's PowerLight, which builds the solar-energy systems,
partnered in January to run the Chatsworth factory, the only plant in
the city where solar-energy systems are manufactured.</TE>
<TE>   The postal facility's system, on which PowerLight will collect
data for two years, will demonstrate to companies that solar energy
is not just an option for homes, Levinson said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Postal Service doesn't really like to be on the leading edge,
but this is a proven technology," he said. "People must step forward
and be the pioneers to take the risks that make things better."</TE>

<LD>Police on Friday continued searching for a man they believe killed a
wealthy former schoolteacher and burned her body in the desert.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Eugene DeLyle, 56, of Torrance is wanted in the slaying of
his girlfriend, Sarah Hart, 60, whose body was found in February on a
remote stretch of road north of Big Bear, Torrance police said.</LD>
<LD>   Hart's family contacted police earlier this month because they
hadn't heard from the woman since late January.</LD>
<TE>   Hart was known to travel often and had spent three weeks in Hawaii
with friends in January. But relatives became alarmed when they began
receiving e-mails under her name canceling planned outings.</TE>
<TE>   Police established that one e-mail, canceling a line-dancing trip,
was sent after her death.</TE>
<TE>   Hart owned a house in Running Springs, so Torrance officers
contacted the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 3, deputies responding to reports of a fire in an area off
California 18 known as Cactus Flats discovered a badly burned body.
Dental records later identified the victim as Hart.</TE>
<TE>   Police believe Hart was killed elsewhere before her body was
dumped and burned in the desert. The cause of death was not
disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   DeLyle, a tour guide for a Chicago-based company, has used Hart's
credit cards to obtain cash, police said.</TE>
<TE>   On April 6, they said, surveillance cameras caught DeLyle making
an electronic withdrawal at a bank in Mission Viejo.</TE>
<TE>   Police said DeLyle had borrowed a substantial sum from Hart, who
they said had more than $1 million in a savings account.</TE>
<TE>   DeLyle does not have access to that account and has no apparent
legal claim to the money, police said, but they believe money was the
motive in Hart's death.</TE>
<TE>   They came to that conclusion "because of the way he's been using
her finances," said Sgt. Rod Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Police said DeLyle had lived in Torrance for a number of years,
but they were having trouble locating anyone who knew him.</TE>
<TE>   DeLyle may be driving a 1999 white Ford Ranger pickup truck with
California license plates 6A56139.</TE>

<HD>Gay Leaders Draw Flak Amid Surge in Syphilis</HD>
<DH>Health: Experts say HIV risks haven't been stressed. Others
say prevention is complex.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Efforts to contain a syphilis surge among gay men in California and
elsewhere have been stymied by a failure among many gay leaders to
portray outbreaks as possible precursors to a rise in HIV, health
experts and some AIDS activists say.</LD>
<LD>   "The leadership out of the gay community on this issue has
essentially been absent," said Dr. Judy Wasserheit, who directed the
sexually transmitted disease prevention program at the U.S. Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention for almost a decade before leaving
last summer. "If we wait until we actually see those [HIV] increases
in the community, it's too late."</LD>
<LD>   Making matters worse, federal health officials have been slow to
release a detailed national prevention strategy and have not
allocated enough money to stem outbreaks, critics say.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a recipe for disaster," said Lee Klosinski, director of
programs for AIDS Project Los Angeles, a treatment and advocacy
organization.</TE>
<TE>   Other gay leaders, however, say prevention isn't as simple as
issuing an edict to practice safe sex.</TE>
<TE>   "Sex is complex," said Brian Byrnes, deputy director of the San
Francisco AIDS Foundation. "People are balancing their desire for
sexual health against their desire to get their basic human needs
met."</TE>
<TE>   He said many AIDS prevention groups have tried to integrate
syphilis prevention into their messages. In any case, he added, it is
not productive to call gay men irresponsible for their sexual
choices.</TE>
<TE>   Syphilis is seen as a barometer of community sexual health because
it, like HIV, is transmitted through unprotected sex. Although the
number of cases is still relatively small and syphilis can be treated
with antibiotics, health officials are worried because the disease is
spreading rapidly and its sores greatly increase the chances of
transmitting HIV.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco reported 139 syphilis cases last year, up from a
historic low of 26 in 1998. Los Angeles logged 187 cases in 2001, up
from a low of 88 two years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The outbreaks suggest a return to behaviors that devastated the
gay community in the 1980s, said Wasserheit, now director of the HIV
Vaccine Trials Network at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center
in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   "Haven't we learned anything from what happened in the last two
decades?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, even some HIV prevention workers have become infected
with HIV because of unsafe practices, disease control experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just unbelievable, unbelievable," said Peter Kerndt,
director of sexually transmitted disease control for the Los Angeles
County Department of Health Services. "From my perspective, it
doesn't appear to matter what you say or do. The [sexual] addictions
are so strong that this type of behavior persists."</TE>
<TE>   Brien Stewart, an HIV-positive designer in West Hollywood, said he
began practicing safe sex again recently because of the syphilis
outbreak in the county. But he said he doesn't look to community
leaders for inspiration.</TE>
<TE>   "They're out there, and they're saying to practice safe sex in
their ads, but behind closed doors, they're really not," said
Stewart, 32. "They don't practice what they preach."</TE>
<TE>   Byrnes said he and other AIDS prevention advocates have learned
through experience that gay men don't like to be told how they should
act sexually.</TE>
<TE>   Gay Men's Right to Reject Safe Sex Cited</TE>
<TE>   "Gay men's sexual health choices are their sexual choices." he
said. "They are not the sexual choices of public health officials."</TE>
<TE>   Other AIDS prevention workers say their peers are reluctant to
criticize unsafe sex because gay men are already demeaned by many
heterosexuals for their sexual orientation.</TE>
<TE>   Leadership is also a problem because the gay community is so
diverse and spread out. People who don't publicly identify themselves
as gay are hard to reach; they don't associate with the community or
look to its leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Federal health officials, meanwhile, are also struggling to
respond. For the last several years, the CDC has focused primarily on
eliminating syphilis in impoverished minority communities,
particularly among African Americans in the Southeast. The outbreaks
among gay men are forcing the agency to switch gears.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the CDC, which recently lost two top officials who had
overseen sexually transmitted diseases and HIV, has taken more than a
year to finalize a report on the syphilis problem within the gay
community. The report has gone through more than a dozen drafts.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Ronald Valdiserri, a senior official at the CDC, said the
agency is hurrying to finish. In another attempt to address the
crisis, he said, the agency hosted four town hall meetings--including
one in Los Angeles--last year to discuss syphilis and other STDs
among gay and bisexual men. The CDC also has allocated small amounts
of money to some areas to improve their tracking systems for sexually
transmitted diseases.</TE>
<TE>   No Single Simple Solution in Sight</TE>
<TE>   "We all wish there was a single simple solution, but there is not,
and we need to keep working on it," he said. "We're struggling to try
to get a better handle on what's going to work."</TE>
<TE>   CDC officials face intense pressure from both ends of the
political spectrum, those involved in STD prevention say.
Conservative lawmakers have criticized the federal agency for
allowing sexually explicit HIV prevention messages. Gay groups and
their liberal counterparts want more freedom to craft messages that
they believe appeal to their audience.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of people at the CDC who are very hard-working
and good intentioned, but they have told me that their every action
is heavily scrutinized and they really have to watch what they're
doing and really have to be careful," said Tom Coates, director of UC
San Francisco's Center for AIDS Prevention Studies.</TE>
<TE>   Wasserheit and others say local health officials are not acting
decisively enough either. In many jurisdictions, for instance,
officials don't even collect information on the sexual orientation of
people infected with sexually transmitted diseases. That prevents
disease specialists from tracking their spread, these health
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Some health agencies also don't understand the norms, attitudes
and meeting places in the gay community, hindering their ability to
quickly contain outbreaks, others said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, safe-sex advice can only be taken to a point, said Jeff
Bailey, director of health education at the Los Angeles Gay and
Lesbian Center.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't convey very positive messages about men in relationships
when we tell people that they have to have safe sex by wearing a
condom every time they have sex," Bailey said.</TE>
<TE>   Others say there is no excuse for silence or inaction.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a public health crisis staring us in the face, and the
time to act is now," said Cornelius Baker, executive director of the
Whitman-Walker Clinic in Washington.</TE>

<HD>Leaking Tanker Closes 101 Freeway</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A tanker truck leaking highly flammable liquid oxygen shut down the
Ventura Freeway on Friday, snarling traffic in both directions and
leading to the evacuation of four nearby businesses.</LD>
<LD>   The truck was unloading 4,400 gallons of liquid oxygen at Apria
Healthcare on Trabajo Drive off Del Norte Avenue in Oxnard when the
leak occurred. The oxygen combined with the outside air to form
clouds of white vapor that drifted over the nearby freeway, Oxnard
fire officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Fearing that the vapors could ignite and cause a major
catastrophe, the California Highway Patrol shut down both sides of
the freeway between Rice and Central avenues from 11 a.m. until about
12:30 p.m. Traffic, which was diverted to surface streets, was backed
up for miles, CHP officials said.</LD>
<TE>   "We got this product dumping out and we couldn't have freeway
traffic at that time," said CHP spokesman Steven Reid.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, 100 Apria employees and about 300 workers from three
neighboring businesses were evacuated.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Bill Gallaher of the Oxnard Fire Department said the
incident began about 10:30 a.m. when the truck driver, who was not
identified, was offloading liquid oxygen and heard a popping noise.</TE>
<TE>   When he checked, he discovered a leak and a fire around a valve.
Trying to get the tanker as far from the building as possible, the
driver moved it across the road, which parallels the freeway. He then
unhooked the white tank from the cab and notified Apria, which called
the Fire Department, Gallaher said.</TE>
<TE>   The fire, which was confined to a fiberglass covering of the
truck, was quickly extinguished, Gallaher said.</TE>
<TE>   Hazardous materials teams were called in to clean up the spill.</TE>
<TE>   Gallaher said hot oil on the road or leaking from passing trucks
could have combined with the vapors to cause a fire.</TE>
<TE>   He credited the truck driver, who works for MG Industries in
Irwindale, with getting the tank away from the other oxygen tanks at
Apria when he saw the leak. At the time, he had already unloaded
about 2,000 gallons of liquid oxygen, fire officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Getson, spokeswoman for Apria, said all evacuated employees
were back at work by 12:30 p.m. Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Apria has 380 branches nationwide. The Orange County-based company
specializes in providing oxygen, respiratory and medical equipment to
patients in their homes.</TE>
<TE>   Getson said the company has not had any other incidents.</TE>

<LD>Five illegal dump sites in the Antelope Valley will be cleared of
more than 200 tons of waste by Los Angeles County Department of
Health Services workers next week, authorities said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Discarded appliances, furniture, garbage, tires and construction
and yard debris will be hauled away in a cleanup funded by a $30,000
grant from the California Integrated Waste Management Board, said
project manager Chris Mastro.</LD>
<LD>   Cleanup sites are at the Lancaster intersections of 30th Street
West and Avenue E, 7th Street East and Avenue H-8, and 90th Street
West and Avenue L. The other two sites are at the intersections of
150th Street East and Avenue Q near Lake Los Angeles and 96th Street
East and Avenue V in Littlerock.</LD>
<TE>   Mastro said he takes the cleanup job "very personally."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want the site to revert to what it was. If I see trash
material, I'll get it removed," he said.</TE>

<AU>ANDREA ADLEMAN</AU>
<BD>Andrea Adleman is a member of the Coastal San Pedro
Neighborhood Council governing board.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his highly acclaimed survey of American civic life, Harvard
University sociologist Robert Putnam painted a sobering portrait of
isolationist trends in the latter 20th century. According to the 1995
study, participation was down categorically in everything from Lions
Club meetings to religious services to dinner parties at the Joneses.
People were doing things--bowling, for example--but not collectively.</LD>
<LD>   Americans were "Bowling Alone"--as Putnam's book is aptly
titled--to the detriment of mind, body, spirit and democracy itself.</LD>
<LD>   In modern-day Los Angeles, the neighborhood council is the
metaphorical bowling league and, by contrast, sign-ups are running
strong.</LD>
<TE>   From the waterfront to the foothills, Angelenos are getting the
ball rolling. There's dynamism at the grassroots, and its impact can
hardly be overstated at this defining moment in city and national
history.</TE>
<TE>   Created through the sweeping City Charter reform of 1999,
neighborhood councils were designed to give ordinary people more
information and influence regarding the municipal decisions that
directly affect their neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Codified by Article IX of the charter, neighborhood councils are
empowered through an "early notification system" to alert them in
advance to relevant agenda items of the City Council, a City Council
committee, a city board or a commission. The charter also calls for
neighborhood councils to weigh in on the city budget.</TE>
<TE>   Neighborhood councils have a mandate to reach out to the broadest
diversity of local "stakeholders," minimally defined as people who
live, work or own property in the given jurisdiction.</TE>
<TE>   The harbor area has generated much of the momentum around
neighborhood councils. In the spring of 2000, local activists in
Wilmington and San Pedro began a trail-blazing journey to bring
neighborhood councils to life. Persevering through major growing
pains at the community and citywide levels, harbor-area organizers
made history last December when the Wilmington and coastal San Pedro
neighborhood councils became the first two certified in the city.</TE>
<TE>   Harbor area residents have high expectations of their councils.
Local interest groups are lobbying the councils to vote on their
issues.</TE>
<TE>   The councils are building power and in the process, they are
forging a solution to the central challenge posed by Putnam's study:
How do we identify and popularize new ways of connectivity that speak
to real life in the present tense?</TE>
<TE>   In academic terms, neighborhood councils can be a vehicle through
which we "do with" instead of "doing for." We can "bridge"
differences of race/ethnicity/class/language/national origin/et al.,
as opposed to "bond" with birds of a feather.</TE>
<TE>   Neighborhood councils can bring neighbors of diverse demographics
together to exert newfound political power over the circumstances
that intimately affect their collective well-being: campaigning side
by side for the common good; breaking down the barriers; bowling
together.</TE>
<TE>   The prognosis for the city and the nation is brighter because of
the civic-oriented teamwork inherent in neighborhood councils.
Democracy is strengthened, its functionality increased.</TE>
<TE>   The bowling league is trendy again.</TE>

<LD>Every year on Holocaust Remembrance Day we mourn the loss of millions
of innocent Jews, Catholics, Gypsies, homosexuals, Communists and
political opponents who were murdered by the Nazis. The themes of
loss, remembrance and sacrifice resonate with greater power than
usual this year in light of Sept. 11. While we mourn the loss of
loved ones, we should also recall and celebrate the heroism of those
who risked everything in the name of confronting and defeating
unspeakable evil.</LD>
<LD>   Although many such stories exist, few are ever told publicly. Here
is my father's. In the spring of 1942, the Nazis were occupying
Teshin, Czechoslovakia.</LD>
<LD>   My grandfather managed to escape and join the partisans in
Romania. My grandmother was much less fortunate; she was captured by
the Nazis and sent to the Auschwitz death camp. For three years she
endured horrors I cannot even begin to imagine, until the camp's
liberation in 1945.</LD>
<TE>   Before she was deported to the camps, she made arrangements with
her Catholic neighbors to take care of her only son--my father--then
only 9 months old.</TE>
<TE>   Harboring Jews carried with it unparalleled dangers. The family
that sheltered my father risked their property, their peace of mind,
their very lives. Despite these tremendous perils, my father was
welcomed as an integral part of the family and was given a relatively
normal life amid the chaos engulfing Europe. While other Jewish
children were being slaughtered by the thousands, my father enjoyed a
happy and safe early childhood, thanks to his adoptive family.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the end of the war, the Jewish Agency came to take
my father to a relocation camp for the reunification of families. The
family that had raised and protected him for more than four years,
who treated him as if he was their own son, lost him in a matter of
days. My father lost the only family he ever knew.</TE>
<TE>   As a Jew, I will never forget a picture of my father standing
together with his new family next to a Christmas tree. As a human
being, I will never forget the extraordinary valor of these heroes.</TE>
<TE>   Some 23 years later, at my father's wedding, a rather unusual gift
arrived. The gift was a pair of gold rings sent by the couple that
saved my father's life. The rings were their wedding bands. It is
important to keep in mind that the couple and their daughter were
poverty-stricken, living behind the Iron Curtain. They could have
kept the rings or sold them to buy a little comfort in life, but
instead they passed them on to my father, the son they briefly had,
the son they could not keep, the son they could never forget.</TE>
<TE>   I looked at those rings for the first time this past week. They
were devoid of any markings; they bore no gem and were barren of
elegant engravings or designs. In fact, they were entirely
unremarkable.</TE>
<TE>   In that moment I seized upon the irony that although the rings
were plain and ordinary, the people who had worn them had been
anything but. The people who saved my father were the jewels of
humanity.</TE>
<TE>   As I held those rings in my hand, I said a silent prayer of thanks
for those righteous people who saved my father and, in turn, saved
me. In observing Holocaust Remembrance Day, we must not only recall
the victims but also exalt the heroes of those dark days who bore
untold burdens and sacrifices to provide a better life for others.</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath of Sept. 11, I once again find my thoughts
turning to heroes--the firefighters, the police officers, the
emergency medical technicians and our soldiers who face untold
dangers and evil. I am incredibly thankful to them, perhaps more than
they will ever know.</TE>

<HD>Too Many Homilies Cloud Spiritual Path to Peace</HD>
<DH>RELIGIONS FOR PEACE: A Call for Solidarity to the Religions
of the World; By Francis Cardinal Arinze; Doubleday: 146 pp., $17.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ZACHARY KARABELL</AU>
<BD>Zachary Karabell is a contributing writer to Book
Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scandals over sexual abuse are rocking the foundations of the Roman
Catholic Church in the United States. Ever-rising ethnic and
religious tensions in places such as Kashmir and Israel/Palestine are
engulfing entire regions in hate. And the religious undertone of
terrorism and the war on it remains ominously unresolved. In that
context, now is a good time for a leading cleric to make the case for
how religion can create a better world.</LD>
<LD>   Cardinal Francis Arinze is one of the highest prelates in the
Catholic Church. Born in Nigeria, he was made a cardinal by Pope John
Paul II in 1985, and he now heads the Pontifical Council for
Interreligious Dialogue. Innocuous as that sounds, it is a bold new
venture for the Vatican. The notion of an organized interreligious
dialogue dates only to the Second Vatican Council of the 1960s, and
Arinze has been a recent leader of the church's efforts.</LD>
<LD>   "Religions for Peace" is a series of essays on the problem of
world peace and what religion can do to promote it. It comes with
ringing endorsements from Cardinal Edward Egan of New York, from the
Anglican archbishop of Canterbury and from the secretary general of
the Islamic Society of North America. And it promises to show "what
the various religions can actually do to promote peace."</LD>
<TE>   Rather than offering a path to peace, however, Arinze presents a
compendium of homilies: "War does not lie primarily in armaments or
missiles. It arises from the human heart"; "the effort to build peace
has to be sustained, while resisting discouragement and fatigue";
"justice is a necessary foundation for peace." There is absolutely
nothing objectionable about these statements. Their truth is so
self-evident that almost no one, of any culture, would disagree, but
without tethering them to the more complicated world as it is, they
can sound hollow.</TE>
<TE>   The Vatican may reflect the will of the divine, but it is also a
multifaceted bureaucracy attending to the lives of a billion people.
No matter how senior or how holy, bureaucrats speak in generalities
when they speak in public. And Arinze uses the vague language that
bureaucrats have always used.</TE>
<TE>   In subtle ways, however, Arinze points to some of the more
intractable issues underlying his call for peace. He enjoins everyone
to embrace religious pluralism and to engage in dialogue with other
faiths. Only through interfaith understanding and compassion, he
says, can we avoid wars of absolute truth against absolute truth. But
he cautions that some people are more appropriate to carry on this
dialogue than others. "Interreligious dialogue is ... not for those
who are problem children in their faith communities....It would be a
mistake to allow such doubters into the arena of interreligious
dialogue."</TE>
<TE>   In churchspeak, this is a strong statement. Peace is enhanced by
interreligious dialogue between true believers, not by argument or
discussion between academics or politicians. A devout Muslim should
represent Islam, while a devout Catholic should represent
Christianity. Only they are connected to the importance of God, to
the demands of prayer and to the knowledge that there is a greater
power than human will. That is a stance that some could argue with,
and perhaps that is why the cardinal takes so few of the stances.</TE>
<TE>   Though Arinze presents multiple examples of interfaith dialogue,
of prayer activities to end war and of the role of the faithful in
calling for peace, he does not adequately tackle the link between
religion and war. He mentions it but dismisses it as a false problem.
True religion, he says, abhors war. Therefore, any who use religion
to justify war and violence are not truly religious. That is a
convenient answer. It may also be a true answer. But it is, like much
of what he writes, too pat to be a useful answer.</TE>
<TE>   It's impossible not to celebrate the sentiment expressed in
"Religions for Peace." At the same time, if the best the Vatican has
to offer is homilies, a call for prayer and more interfaith dialogue,
Arinze fails to show why such things are imperative.</TE>
<TE>   Others have written eloquently about prayer and dialogue as
powerful forces for world peace and have not sounded simplistic.</TE>

<HD>Raising Statues, and a Nation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two magnificent statues of Buddha towered over the Afghan town of
Bamian for about 1,600 years, testifying to an earlier culture, a
different religion. Last year the fanatical Taliban rulers, insisting
they were heeding an Islamic code forbidding idols, destroyed the
icons. Now the interim ruler of the shattered nation has promised to
rebuild them. The ancient statues are irreplaceable, but the effort
is an important gesture about the transformation of Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   Prime Minister Hamid Karzai said his administration had contacted
the United Nations to discuss rebuilding the statues, one 175 feet
tall, the other 120 feet. Who will pay is an important question. More
than two decades of war, starting with the Soviet invasion of 1979,
devastated an already impoverished nation. Countries like Thailand
and Sri Lanka, where Buddhism is an important faith, could be donors,
though given their economies their funding probably would not be
substantive. Western nations pledged to religious freedom and
pluralism also should be willing donors.</LD>
<TE>   The Afghan sculptor picked for the job, a man who returned from
exile in New York, said perhaps only one Buddha will be rebuilt, with
remnants of the other left as a monument to Taliban barbarism. That
would be fitting. Numerous Muslim nations protested that the
destruction was not required by Islam, which forbids worship of idols
but does not demand their destruction. Afghanistan of course first
needs to rebuild schools and factories, shops and hospitals. The
Bamian statues cannot be replicated, but even a symbolic reminder can
help heal war's scars.</TE>

<LD>And the winner gets ... a weedy vacant lot, studded with nasty trash,
in the heart of a crowded neighborhood considered dangerous after
dark.</LD>
<LD>   What's the contest? It's an urban tug of war over any large
patches of open space free of environmental challenges. It pits
families who need housing against families who need schools.</LD>
<LD>   The classroom shortage is directly linked to the scarcity of
affordable housing, and many families need both decent schools and
decent dwellings. Proportionally, Los Angeles is home to more renters
than any other U.S. city except New York. Nearly two out of three
L.A. households rent. There are few bargains. High rents--like the
$1,100 a month paid by two sisters, with six children between them,
for a two-bedroom apartment situated in the flight path of LAX--force
many families to double up and even triple up. At home two children
often share a bed. At school they cannot share a desk, but where will
they live if their apartment building is torn down to make room for a
new school?</LD>
<TE>   Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg (D-Los Angeles) faced that question
during her eight years on the Los Angeles school board. During her
tenure, the board moved away from taking apartments, in part because
tenants and owners often couldn't afford replacements even with a
generous purchase or relocation package.</TE>
<TE>   Hardest hit were families who doubled up in one apartment. The law
would not allow the school district to relocate both families to a
small place that remained affordable on two low salaries. Each family
typically moved into a hotel, which was more expensive. After the
relocation money ran out, they got evicted. The district all but quit
building schools. The result is today's overcrowded year-round
campuses. The district is now trying to catch up, and some homes are
certain to be lost.</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg is looking for solutions that will serve both needs. Next
month she will convene nonprofit housing developers, low- and
moderate-income housing advocates and representatives from school
districts and city housing departments to propose ways to work
together. Schools, libraries and parks could be planned together to
allow joint use. Multistory schools would require less land and leave
more for housing. Schools and housing could be built simultaneously
in some areas, though not as part of the same construction project.</TE>
<TE>   As she writes her invitation list, Goldberg should consider adding
Eli Broad, the billionaire real estate developer with a passion for
improving public education, David Abel from Better Neighborhoods,
Better Schools and of course veteran affordable housing experts like
Jan Breidenbach of Housing LA.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Back in 1931, as water engineers and state lawmakers plotted the
transfer of huge amounts of Northern California water to San Joaquin
Valley farms and Southern California cities, they could not have
imagined that little Solano County would boom from 41,000 residents
to more than 400,000 today. They felt secure in promising Solano and
other northern counties they could have their water back if they ever
really needed it. The unspoken belief was that they never would.</LD>
<LD>   Thus the Legislature in 1931 passed the state's first
"area-of-origin" law. It was expanded from counties to cover entire
watersheds in 1933 and became a key provision of the State Water
Project in the late 1950s. The area-of-origin laws were essential to
offset opposition to the $1.75-billion bond issue in 1960 that
financed the start of construction.</LD>
<LD>   Now, the north is striking back. The Times' Nancy Vogel reported
last Sunday that the growing cities of Fairfield, Benecia and
Vacaville in Solano County, east of San Francisco Bay, have
petitioned the state Water Resources Control Board to regain rights
to 31,620 acre-feet of water, enough to serve 155,000 people a year.</LD>
<TE>   That is a fraction of the nearly 5 million acre-feet that are
collected from the northern mountains and moved south of the
Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta by the pumps and canals of the State
Water Project and its companion federal project. But more such
petitions are expected, Michael Jackson, an attorney for northern
counties, told Vogel, because those areas "are running out of water
for growth."</TE>
<TE>   The issue is important to Southern California because the
Metropolitan Water District, which wholesales water to six counties
including Los Angeles and San Diego, is the state project's biggest
customer. MWD Deputy General Manager Tim Quinn says the
area-of-origin issue will force cuts in the south's supply, "but we
have to honor the deal we struck half a century ago." Add to this a
previous agreement that Southern California will limit its take on
the Colorado River to about 10% less than the nearly 5 million
acre-feet it uses now and the future appears even more uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the solution is completing a deal to transfer more than
200,000 acre-feet of Colorado River water from Imperial County farms
to San Diego County for home and business use. There's also no
certainty that Fairfield, Benecia and Vacaville will get the whole
31,600 acre-feet. Some question whether they really are in the
Sacramento River watershed. There is dispute over some wording in the
law. And the three cities will have to devise a way to get the water
to homes and businesses. The state water board hearings, beginning in
June, are expected to be complex and protracted. But the big picture
is already clear.</TE>
<TE>   Seven decades ago, when valley farmers and Southern California
began coveting the north's water, they agreed they would take only
"surplus" or "excess" water. The awakening of the area-of-origin
issue tells us that we've used up any surplus or excess. Any "new"
water will have to come primarily from techniques such as buying from
farmers, conservation, recycling and the development of practical
desalination plants.</TE>
<TE>   This will be politically and technically difficult. It will be
costly. But it is the only basis on which California can plan a sound
economic future.</TE>

<LD>Re "Rapid Growth of Advanced Placement Classes Raises Concerns,"
April 7: Recent growth of the Advanced Placement program was fueled
in the 1990s not just by students seeking to impress admissions
officers but also due to the growing recognition by educators across
the country that rigorous AP courses are the best preparation for
college available.</LD>
<LD>   AP can have the effect of upgrading the quality of the entire
school curriculum as steps are taken to prepare students for intense
course work, beginning in middle school and high school. These
positive effects are most often seen in schools where students
previously have been denied access to high-quality academic programs.
As new and growing AP programs are implemented in more schools, it is
not surprising that extra efforts are needed to ensure that they
match the quality of long-standing, successful programs.</LD>
<TE>   But the answer is not to step away from AP. It is to guarantee
that schools, districts, states and the entire education community
provide teachers with professional development, instructional
resources and other educational supports. These resources can make
high-quality AP experiences universally available. AP has become an
important part of the educational landscape, and we welcome
constructive criticism. Any program that puts forth high academic
standards for students should be committed to nothing less than
continuous self-improvement.</TE>

<TE>   The universities are complaining that students can pass the AP
exams but still not know anything. Now substitute California High
School Exit Exam for Advanced Placement and you'll understand what a
waste of time and money Gov. Gray Davis has in store for taxpayers,
students and schools. Schools are for learning, not test preparation.
It's time to let our teachers teach.</TE>

<TE>   In "Test Case: UC Versus the SAT" (Opinion, April 7), Matthew
Belloni presents the College Board's "courtship" of UC as "sudden"
and the proposed changes to the SAT as driven by the UC, whose method
is to "bully."</TE>
<TE>   Thugs bully. Most educators, including College Board members, seek
change through a deliberative, inclusive, usually collegial process
that works toward a consensus over time. That is what happened
between 1987 and 1994, the last time the SAT I was substantially
revised, and that is what is happening now.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, even UC President Richard Atkinson understands that
substantive change will come to the SAT I only when he persuades
college and university presidents nationwide that some other test
will be better at predicting college success. We all would like to
believe that California is the center of the world, but alas, it is
not.</TE>

<LD>In his Capitol Journal column ("Dear Professor: The Only Way to
Change Politics Is to Participate in Politics," April 8), George
Skelton described an encounter with a Cal State professor who
advocates a "voter boycott" to demonstrate the people's loss of faith
in the political process. Did the professor, a "lifelong political
activist," not notice that the Voter Information pamphlet for the
March 5 primary listed, in addition to the Republican and Democratic
slates, five, count 'em, five minor parties offering candidates for
statewide offices? And that near the end of the pamphlet there was a
section of several pages presenting all the parties' mission
statements complete with addresses, phone numbers and Web sites where
one could obtain further information?</LD>
<LD>   Seems to me that a vote for these other guys would be a far more
effective strategy than a boycott. Check them out! You might find
something to like. As Skelton concluded, "No-shows draw no
attention," but when the fat cats see their captive voters defecting
en masse to those other parties, you bet they'll sit up and take
notice.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Peggy Constantine's comments in "Jumping the Gun on Kindergarten" are
true, in my experience (Voices, April 6). In 1966, when I was a
5-year-old in Chicago, my mother sent me to the Head Start program of
Davis Elementary School. I thrived in that atmosphere. In fact, I had
so much fun and learned so much in the following four years that my
mother unwisely agreed with Davis Elementary's decision to have me
skip the fourth grade.</LD>
<LD>   My verbal skills were ready for the challenge, but my math skills
were not. Missing basic lessons in multiplication and long division
forced me to "catch up"--all the way through high school, where I
only got as far as intermediate algebra. Consequently, I couldn't do
the math for calculus when I first entered a university. This had a
significant impact on my later academic and career decisions.</LD>
<LD>   Parents and school administrators should pay attention to
Constantine's argument for allowing kids to develop before shoving
them into learning environments they are unprepared for.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I thoroughly enjoyed Constantine's piece on the perils of
kindergarten today. I started my 5-year-old (with a September
birthday) in kindergarten last year because I felt I had to.</TE>
<TE>   Kindergarten was a horrid experience for her. She was not ready
for many of the activities, but this did not stop the teacher from
judging her based on these activities. He even wanted her referred to
special education; I asked him to give her time. This year, she is in
a charter school, which is wonderful, and her teacher says she is
right where she should be. While I am grateful that she is now in an
environment with a teacher who understands developmental readiness,
her self-esteem was seriously injured last year. Why does
kindergarten have to be first grade? Whom does it serve?</TE>
<TE>   Marilee Mouser</TE>
<TE>   Goleta</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As a father of a young son enrolling in kindergarten this year,
Constantine's piece on today's higher standards for kindergarteners
left me saddened but not surprised, as it highlighted another classic
example of public education's misplaced priorities. Constantine
informs us that "if your child is not ready to write sentences and
begin reading, give that child a year to develop" before entering him
in kindergarten. Huh?</TE>
<TE>   What happened to letting kindergarten be a pressureless platform
for 4- and 5-year-old kids to make the adjustment to the more serious
learning environment found in the first grade? It really makes no
difference to me whether my son is 5 or 6 years old when he finally
learns to count to 100 and read a simple book.</TE>
<TE>   The education process is a marathon. Why is it being run as a
sprint? If there is any place where standards need to be raised, it
is at the other end of the educational spectrum. How about tougher
standards and increased homework for our middle and high school
students? I've seen the amount of homework given to today's
kindergarteners and I wonder if we are inadvertently conditioning
them to dread school. Kindergarten should be a chance for the schools
to get our kids interested in the learning process.</TE>

<LD>Re "In Our Schools, Cosmetology Is No Substitute for Calculus,"
Commentary, April 8: I am in agreement with LAUSD school board member
Genethia Hudley-Hayes that it's totally wrong not to have advanced
mathematics classes at Fremont High School. As a member of the
superintendent's Focus on Student Achievement Council, I have
continually brought up the subject of the inequity of Advanced
Placement offerings by school and by track. For the past three years,
we start to address this issue and, for various reasons, the
committee breaks up and we have to start over. We are just starting
to address the equality of Advanced Placement classes again.</LD>
<LD>   Why is an auto shop teacher concerned with Advanced Placement
courses? Because we need to meet the needs of all of our students. We
need to have classes for the students who want to go to a four-year
college as well as the students who want to enter the work force.
This should not be an us-versus-them issue. This should be all of us
working together to educate the students. It is wrong not to give all
students access to Advanced Placement courses, and it is wrong not to
give all students access to vocational education.</LD>
<LD>   Tom Marshall</LD>
<TE>   Marshall High School, L.A.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In decrying the absence of Advanced Placement classes at
overcrowded inner-city Fremont High School, Hudley-Hayes overlooks
the opportunity for motivated students to apply for places in LAUSD's
well-regarded magnet school system. Not every school has to offer
college prep programs. LAUSD needs to recognize that there are
students all over the city who belong in vocational education
classes--which do not exist at most college prep schools.</TE>
<TE>   As it becomes increasingly difficult to find a good plumber, a
good car mechanic or a competent handyman, perhaps our educators will
discover that the classes teaching these important skills that lead
to relatively well-paying, stable jobs belong in our curriculum.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Heller Mason</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hudley-Hayes writes that Fremont has six cosmetology classes and
no advanced math classes; that inner-city schools have fewer fully
credentialed teachers, fewer AP courses and more run-down and
overcrowded schools than affluent parts of the district. Together
these cause permanent second-class status. She states that SB 1731
will enable all students to have equal opportunities for
post-secondary education. Extremely laudable goals. If only she had
the pull, say by being a member of the Board of Education and making
policy, to get the LAUSD going in this direction before legislation
passes. Oh, wait a minute, she already is. What's her excuse then?</TE>

<LD>I agree with The Times' support of legislation for greater water
conservation measures ("Flushing Away a Resource," editorial, April
8). Assemblywoman Fran Pavley's bill, AB 2734, will help conserve
hundreds of thousands of gallons in water-deficient Southern
California by expanding the very successful low-flow toilet retrofit
program.</LD>
<LD>   In West Hollywood, we are testing a new waterless-urinal
technology that can save up to 40,000 gallons of water per urinal
annually. These urinals are no more expensive than standard urinals,
and they cost less to maintain since there are no moving parts or
complicated plumbing. The technology is odor-free, and West
Hollywood's test, now several months underway, has thus far been a
success. Waterless urinals may be a prudent next step to water
conservation in this drought-prone region.</LD>

<TE>   Your editorial extols the benefit of low-flow toilets, which have
been required for all new toilets since 1992. While the low flow is a
noble gesture, how many readers find, as my family does, that one
actually uses more water with a low-flow toilet because one must
flush it several times to achieve the desired effect? I wonder if the
unintended consequence of mandating low-flow toilets is increased
water consumption.</TE>

<TE>   While your editorial was swimming in facts and figures, it only
stayed in the shallow end of analysis. It's true that water is a
critical resource in our state and even scarcer in other parts of the
world. When looked at from your perspective, we all can certainly do
our part to conserve what Yeats called "the generated soul." It
obviously should not be wasted. But research beyond the wading pool
would've shown that residential use accounts for only about 5% of
water consumption in California. The rest is applied to very thirsty
agricultural, industrial and commercial purposes.</TE>
<TE>   Further, you didn't mention other options in the pipeline, such as
more economical desalination and more palatable water recycling
technologies (the infelicitously monikered "toilet-to-tap" project
notwithstanding). And finally, though a water shortage is not
something to take sitting down, the low-flow toilet is not likely to
be the solution. Sometimes the low-flow model needs two flushes to
get the job done, defeating its purpose.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "A Mountainous Misstep," editorial, April 5: There is much more to
this story on Mammoth Lakes and the possible expansion of its airport
operations. Intrawest, the Canadian company behind much of this
growth wish, needs more water than the area has, to expand its skiing
operation and for the associated housing boom. It is planning on
drilling water wells in the forested area between Mammoth and June
Lake. This aquifer supplies water for several creeks in the area,
notably Big Springs, which is the headwaters for the Owens River. The
Owens ultimately flows into Lake Crowley, and several runs of rainbow
and German brown trout use the river for their spawning beds. The
loss of the river flows would cause the loss of the fishery.</LD>
<LD>   Mammoth Lakes has been in trouble for illegally diverting water
from Mammoth Creek that is designated for Hot Creek and, ultimately,
Lake Crowley. All this to keep the lawns green and swimming pools
filled. Imagine how lovely the area would be with large jets roaring
overhead, a huge ski town, dead and dying trees and dry creek beds.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Times is suggesting that it knows what is better for Mammoth
Lakes than the people who live there. This is just symptomatic of the
problem we face of urban bureaucrats, activists and media thinking
that they are better qualified to manage suburban, rural and
wilderness areas.</TE>
<TE>   If their logic is true, maybe we should also have the Mammoth
Times suggest policies and procedures to manage Los Angeles. After
all, our record is not so terrific and maybe the experts from a small
town have more insight into some of our problems than we do.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Davis</TE>
<TE>   Calabasas</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The problems with the proposal are not just limited to the
environmental impacts of a massive increase in tourism. Every pilot
in the area knows that the site is dangerous and unreliable, as
winter storms and crosswinds hit here with particular ferocity, and
there are hills, mountains and a highway dangerously close to the
runway.</TE>
<TE>   Also, it seems that a primary goal of the town's plan is to use
the runway expansion as a means to expand its developable territory
outside the town limits--condos, an RV park and shopping centers are
planned for the airport site and the acreage across the highway.</TE>

<LD>Re "Limited Arctic Drilling Won't Harm Caribou, Scientists Say,"
April 8: What a travesty! After 12 years, the U.S. Geological Survey
produced a report about caribou that was damaging to the Bush
administration's proposal to destroy the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge. So it was told to go back and do it over and come up with the
right answer. So, of course they did, in seven days! (And what about
the grizzlies, polar bears, birds, musk oxen and the rest of the
animals?)</LD>
<LD>   Do the Bush administration and Interior Secretary Gale Norton
believe that the American public can swallow such opportunistic
hypocrisy? Can we, the public, ever believe anything that the Bush
people tell us?</LD>
<LD>   Harold D. Watkins</LD>
<TE>   Studio City</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your story reports that the Alaskan caribou would not be decimated
by drilling for oil in the ANWR, and now we hear that Iraq is cutting
off its supply of oil for a month in protest of our position on the
Middle East (April 9). This brilliant move to raise oil prices is
exquisitely timed to hurt our recovering economy just as Americans
were finally finding more jobs. Furthermore, American dollars spent
to buy Middle Eastern oil are used to support the very terrorists who
kill us.</TE>
<TE>   We could bring an end to this paradox by producing our own oil in
Alaska. When will we ever be free of the tyranny of Iraq's Saddam
Hussein and America's environmentalists?</TE>

<HD>Omit 'Scarlet Letter' on Driver's Licenses</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re ''Driver's License Plan for Illegal Workers Criticized,'' April 9:
Why have a ''scarlet letter'' driver's license only for applicants
who have admitted that they are here illegally? Why not reverse the
procedure and let anyone get a license, adding the special mark only
if the holder has produced proof of U.S. citizenship?</LD>
<LD>   Nobody would be forced to prove citizenship, and absence of the
citizenship mark would not prove that the holder was an illegal
immigrant. If the goal is to make the roads safer, rather than to
encourage or oppose illegal immigration, this is a no-brainer.</LD>
<LD>   Keith Jarett</LD>
<TE>   Lafayette, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft is trying to round up illegals and is
asking for state and local police enforcement help, our Gov. Gray
Davis is now trying to help illegals get driver's licenses! Something
is seriously wrong with this. If, as Sheriff Lee Baca states,
illegals are driving in California without licenses or insurance,
then why aren't our police arresting and deporting these illegals?</TE>
<TE>   How can Baca say illegals who are noncriminals should be able to
get a license? This is an oxymoron if ever there was one. California
is part of the United States, and all laws federal, state and local
must be upheld; illegal entry into this country is a crime.</TE>

<LD>   This is a much larger question than using Yucca Mountain as a
toxic waste dump; it behooves us to think critically about the folly
of creating nuclear waste in the first place.</LD>
<LD>   Why are we investing our tax dollars in nuclear energy when no one
in his or her right mind is willing to store the noxious stuff? This
should clearly point our nation away from nuclear power as a viable

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re Lynn Cohen's revolting April 7 Opinion piece, "Memory and
Destiny": I am tired of reading false, unsubstantiated accusations
penned by Jews who are obsessed with comparing Israel's policies to
the barbaric actions taken against the Jewish people 60 years ago.
Such nonsense cannot go unanswered.</LD>
<LD>   I am delighted that Cohen has learned Hebrew. I would encourage
her to learn Arabic as well so that she can understand Yasser
Arafat's calls to jihad and suicide bombing in his native tongue. Her
concern for those targeted "based on ethnicity" was especially
touching, given that the only civilians deliberately targeted, indeed
massacred, are Israelis by Palestinian suicide bombers.</LD>
<LD>   I would welcome another visit by Cohen to Israel, this time to
show solidarity with the victims of terror. Her first visit should be
to a hospital, where she can share her insights with women and
children who have been maimed and scarred for the crimes of being
Jewish and sitting at a cafe. She should then spend a night at a bomb
shelter in northern Israel listening to the screams of mortar shells
lobbed across the border by Hezbollah.</LD>
<TE>   It is clear that only moral myopia could blind someone to the
suffering that Israelis are going through. This year the angel of
death did not pass over the Park Hotel in Netanya, where hundreds of
Jews were gathering for the traditional Seder meal. The arguments put
forth by Cohen offer no inducement to Palestinian leaders to cease
their advocacy of death and destruction. In fact, she offers further
justification for the killing of Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Yuval Rotem</TE>
<TE>   Consul General of Israel</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cohen's romanticized memories of her year in Israel may be filled
with flirty smiles and hungry kisses with her Arab neighbors.
However, her memories do not include the constant threat of being
murdered solely because she is a Jew in Israel. In light of her
so-called love of Israel, Cohen may feel justified using polemic
terms like "Gestapo-style rampage" to describe Israel's defensive
military operation in response to daily terrorism. It is indeed easy
for someone living in the relative comfort of Los Angeles to use such
factually incorrect and offensive phraseology to describe Israel's
military operation.</TE>
<TE>   While all Israelis (and Jews throughout the world) yearn for
peace, peace will never come to Israel if it simply abandons its need
for a secure and defensible state in favor of those romanticized
memories held by the likes of Cohen.</TE>

<HD>Moorpark Advances in Quest for U.S. Title</HD>
<DH>Education: The Ventura County high school team wins a key
portion of Academic Decathlon competition.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Moorpark High School won a key portion of the brain-draining Super
Quiz contest Friday at the U.S. Academic Decathlon, bringing the
Ventura County powerhouse one step closer to recapturing the national
title the school won three years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Cheered on by a noisy contingent of parents, teachers and
classmates, the eight seniors and one junior who make up Moorpark's
team answered 31 out of 45 questions correctly on the public portion
of the Super Quiz--the only event in the two-day competition open to
the public.</LD>
<LD>   "I am stoked," said a beaming Julie Bristol, who was one of few
decathletes to answer all five of her questions correctly in the
fast-paced, game-show-style contest. "This is phenomenal."</LD>
<TE>   While a dramatic finale to this battle of brains and stamina, the
public portion of the Super Quiz counts for only 4% of a team's total
score. The winner of the 21st annual scholastic competition will be
announced at an awards banquet tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good omen," said Kara Bettencourt, one of Moorpark's two
coaches. "It means we can go to bed feeling confident."</TE>
<TE>   The Super Quiz involves two multiple-choice tests. Contestants
completed one exam earlier in the day, then fielded a second round of
questions in a ballroom packed with a wildly cheering audience of
more than 800.</TE>
<TE>   Moorpark's supporters were among the most vocal and colorful,
sporting sparkly tinsel wigs in green and gold--the school's
colors--painted faces and T-shirts that together spelled out the
school name.</TE>
<TE>   "This is incredible," Moorpark Principal Anna Merriman said. "It
shows how much the kids are loved."</TE>
<TE>   Academic Decathlon, or "aca-deca," is the nation's premier
scholastic competition. The contest tested about 500 of the country's
brightest high school students in seven subjects, with topics ranging
from the poetry of Robert Frost in literature to continuous
probability distributions in statistics.</TE>
<TE>   In the Super Quiz, team members from each of 38 states competed
one at a time through nine rounds. Seated on a large stage under
spotlights, students punched in their answers to questions on an
electronic keyboard and filled out separate paper answer sheets.</TE>
<TE>   This year's theme was "E-communication: the Internet and society."
Students needed to know, for instance, that redundancy is a problem
to be solved in telemedicine technology and that corporate America is
the most enthusiastic supporter of a non-regulatory approach to
Internet safety.</TE>
<TE>   As the event wore on Friday, tension in the audience mounted; the
heat of competition rivaled the 95-degree outside temperature in
downtown Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Moorpark was ahead by at least one question through most of the
event, trailed by Waukesha West High School in Waukesha, Wis., and
James E. Taylor High School of Katy, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   For the past nine years under head coach Larry Jones, Moorpark has
built a reputation around the state and nation as a decathlon
powerhouse. The school has made it to the state-level competition
seven times since 1993, and has come in either first or second over
the past five years. Moorpark won its first national title in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   This year Moorpark is again the team to beat.</TE>
<TE>   Since last fall, seniors Bristol, Dean Reich, Michelle Kim, Johnny
Mendoza, Sheena Sidhu, Andy Song, Sergio Suarez and Jerome Yang and
junior Nathaniel Jones have spent hundreds of hours poring over study
materials, reciting speeches, writing essays and taking practice
quizzes.</TE>
<TE>   They gave up hobbies, sports teams and after-school jobs. But they
also formed strong bonds with each other.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a relief, but at the same time it's sad because it's all
going to be over soon," Andy said. "But this feeling will never go
away. It's amazing."</TE>

<HD>B.J. Baker, 74; Backed Top Singers of '50s, '60s</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD CROMELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>B.J. Baker, a backup singer on dozens of recordings from the 1950s
and '60s, including hits by Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Sam Cooke
and Bobby Darin, died April 2 in Rancho Mirage of complications from
a stroke. She was 74.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to her work at the microphone, Baker was a highly
regarded vocal contractor--a person who selects and directs
background singers for recording sessions. She also appeared on
several '60s television shows, provided voices for cartoons and
married three high-profile entertainment figures--actor Mickey
Rooney, composer Buddy Baker and jazz guitarist Barney Kessel.</LD>
<LD>   Born Betty Jane Phillips in Birmingham, Ala., she sang in big
bands and had her own local radio show at age 14. She caught Rooney's
eye when she represented Alabama in the 1944 Miss America contest,
and they married the same year. The couple divorced in 1947. She was
married to Baker, who became head of the Walt Disney Co. music
department, from 1950 to 1957, and to Kessel from 1961 to 1980. Those
marriages also ended in divorce.</LD>
<TE>   Among the records Baker sang on were Presley's "I Can't Help
Falling in Love With You," Lloyd Price's "Stagger Lee," Cooke's "You
Send Me," Jackie Wilson's "Baby Workout," Sinatra's "That's Life,"
Darin's "Dream Lover" and the Righteous Brothers' "You've Lost That
Lovin' Feeling."</TE>
<TE>   She also dubbed the vocal for actress Nancy Kwan on "I Enjoy Being
a Girl" in the movie "Flower Drum Song," and she was a regular on
Dean Martin's and Judy Garland's television variety shows.</TE>
<TE>   Baker is survived by sons Tim and Mickey Rooney Jr. and stepsons
Dan and David Kessel.</TE>

<HD>Scholar and Minister, Father and Son</HD>
<DH>Families: The two widely admired figures are much alike and
their Sunday school classes are always full, yet both agree it's a
challenging relationship.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>K. CONNIE KANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like many sons of illustrious men, the Rev. Michael M. Bruner wishes
people would stop comparing him to his father, theologian F. Dale
Bruner.</LD>
<LD>   "Being your twin," Pastor Michael likes to tell Professor Dale,
"isn't exactly my aspiration, with all due respect."</LD>
<LD>   But comparisons seem unavoidable with these two wiry, bespectacled
graduates of Princeton Theological Seminary. Both are admired Bible
expositors who love teaching and believe passionately the power of
God's redeeming grace.</LD>
<TE>   Their Sunday school classes at the First Presbyterian Church of
Hollywood are always full, not only with professing Christians but
non-churchgoing yuppies, some driving an hour one way on Sunday
mornings. Even agnostics come to check them out. So do mentally
troubled street people, who wander in, babbling to themselves,
looking for a warm, friendly place in the heart of Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruners--a 69-year-old New Testament scholar, author and
former missionary to the Philippines and a 36-year-old Presbyterian
minister--are happy to see them all.</TE>
<TE>   With drama, humor, scholarship and enthusiasm, father and son
explore Scriptures, one right after the other in the same
auditorium-like hall. They sometimes use their own struggles with
ambition, anger, doubts and relationships to make their points.</TE>
<TE>   "They are both tightly wired and intense, romantic and
sentimental, curious and passionate for truth," says Dale's wife of
43 years and Michael's mother, Kathy Bruner. "But it comes out
differently. Dale sits on his innards, is very circumspect and
proper. Michael's innards tend toward spontaneous combustion."</TE>
<TE>   The father says his single most difficult relationship in life has
been with Michael. The son says his relationship with his father has
been "contentious" since he was a baby. "We continue to love each
other and fight with each other," Michael says.</TE>
<TE>   They laugh over a drawing that enjoys a prominent spot in the
father's cozy home in a compound for retired Presbyterian clergy in
Pasadena. Michael did it at age 4, portraying his mother as a gentle
baby bird, himself as a big ferocious monkey-eating eagle, and his
father as an ant--a mere speck on the canvas.</TE>
<TE>   "That," the father says, "explains our relationship."</TE>
<TE>   On Sundays, the professor starts at 9:30 a.m. with an audience
whose ages range from their 20s to their 90s. The son follows at
10:45 a.m. They preach in the Henrietta Mears Center, named after
Dale's mentor, the legendary Christian educator who built Hollywood
Presbyterian's Sunday school enrollment from 400 to 6,300 before her
death in 1963. Michael's class caters mostly to professionals in
their 20s, 30s and 40s.</TE>
<TE>   Professor Dale and Pastor Michael use theater and storytelling
skills to make the Bible relevant to 21st century urbanites trying to
cope with life's vicissitudes.</TE>
<TE>   The professor, who once memorized 20 chapters of Psalms in
English, French and Hebrew, starts each class by reciting his Bible
verses for the day. He uses his rendition of Bible characters in
stick figures on two huge white boards to illustrate his lessons.</TE>
<TE>   When he first began teaching at the Union Theological Seminary in
the Philippines in 1964, Dale Bruner read his lectures as his
professors had done at the University of Hamburg, where he earned his
doctorate in missiology. His Filipino students fell asleep on him.</TE>
<TE>   His wife, daughter of the late F. Carlton Booth, a professor at
Fuller Theological Seminary and noted evangelist, suggested that Dale
memorize Bible verses and "eyeball" the students. It worked. Soon, he
added illustrations and record playing. Toward the end of his tour,
the theology professor from America had become a self-styled "song
and dance" missionary.</TE>
<TE>   Pastor Michael, who traveled the world for a year as a
professional drummer in a zydeco band, begins his classes with live
music--singing, piano, drums, guitar--and on occasion even saxophone.</TE>
<TE>   A "teacher with powerful theology and a casual wardrobe," Rob
Asghar, a church elder and a member of Michael's class, describes
him.</TE>
<TE>   Michael was born and reared in the rural Philippines, where he and
his brother, Frederick, now an American diplomat in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia, spoke Tagalog with their Filipino playmates, made their own
toys, ran through the jungles, climbed trees and swam in the rivers
wearing what amounted to not much more than a loincloth.</TE>
<TE>   Michael worked as a fisherman in Alaska, apprentice carpenter in
Washington and spinning instructor in California; took eight years to
finish college; resisted going to Princeton because he thought that
would be "the kiss of death that would seal me as my father's clone";
wrote a novel; edited manuscripts; married and divorced.</TE>
<TE>   Even after his ordination and pastoring a church in New Jersey,
Michael ventured into the secular world, working as an executive in
Internet, advertising and publishing companies.</TE>
<TE>   He lives in Malibu and makes his living as a "theology consultant"
for area Presbyterian churches. He says he doesn't worry about where
his next check will come from, trusting God to provide.</TE>
<TE>   He says he spends up to 20 hours a week preparing for his Sunday
school class and is writing a book comparing Thomas Jefferson,
Charles Dickens and Leo Tolstoy with Hollywood TV producer Scott
Carter.</TE>
<TE>   "The real art in life is being satisfied with what you have,"
Pastor Michael said as he was speaking about the fall of Adam and Eve
from Genesis 3 in a recent Sunday class.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are able to master that art, you're more open to the
blessings that God has for you," he said. "If you are so focused on
this goal and on that thing, God may be sending you all kinds of
blessings, but you will miss them because of the one thing you want."</TE>
<TE>   Professor Dale was teaching from Matthew 21, on Christ's
"triumphant entry" into Jerusalem recently when he explained the
symbolism of Jesus choosing a donkey.</TE>
<TE>   That he rode a donkey, "the slow-footed animal of the poor," to
his "'coming-out party' is a lesson for Christians to be accessible
and humble," Dale said.</TE>
<TE>   Turning to himself, he asked: "Bruner, are you a stand-up comic on
Sunday mornings? Do I use the Bible in order to perform? Or, do I
perform to glorify God?"</TE>
<TE>   "We respect Dale," said Hollywood writer Lisa Mitchell, "not only
because of his impressive scholarship but his willingness to be
vulnerable and open and let us identify with him."</TE>
<TE>   The professor, who reads and writes in seven languages, taught
theology for 35 years, the last 25 at Whitworth College in Spokane,
Wash. As reclusive as his son is outgoing, he spends all day either
in his study or at the library. He does not answer the phone; people
communicate with him via fax and mail.</TE>
<TE>   A feline lover, Professor Dale sometimes uses animal analogies to
make his theological points. "Purring," for example, is the best
animal synonym he can think of for "faith," he said. And "the best
parable of trust" in his home comes from the family cat, Clement of
Alexandria.</TE>
<TE>   After a coyote ate Clement's companion cat, Archbishop Thomas
Cranmer, Clement was terrified when he ventured outside. But once
inside, he would stretch out on the floor between the kitchen and the
dining room, where foot traffic was heaviest, and fall asleep.</TE>
<TE>   "Kathy or I could squash Clement's head, but he completely trusts
us," Bruner said. "Every time I see Clement just lying there, I say
to myself, 'That's what Jesus wants me to do--to trust him.'"</TE>

<HD>Personal Spiritual Directors Help Point the Way</HD>
<DH>Trends: More laypeople, looking for a deeper meaning, are
turning to trained practitioners of 'holy listening.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>YONAT SHIMRON</AU>
<BD>RELIGION NEWS SERVICE</BD>
<DL>RALEIGH, N.C.</DL>
<LD>In the last two years, Scott Bass and Roberta Mothershead moved from
a spacious four-bedroom home in an affluent neighborhood to a modest
two-bedroom house near a new public housing project. They've gone to
Haiti twice a year to deliver school supplies and clothes to poor
children. And they work fewer hours so they can devote more time to
prayer and meditation.</LD>
<LD>   Bass and Mothershead talked and prayed about these changes. They
also went to see a spiritual director--an increasingly popular move
among people seeking to better understand their faith.</LD>
<LD>   "It was becoming increasingly clear that there was something we
were missing," said Bass, 40, of Raleigh, a lifelong Baptist who
works as a marriage and family therapist. "We were both looking to
pursue things spiritual. We needed to get clear on that."</LD>
<TE>   Across the country, the practice of searching for God through the
guidance of a trained director is seeing a renaissance.</TE>
<TE>   Once limited to monks, nuns and priests, the practice is spreading
among Protestants, both clergy and laypeople, who find it a useful
tool for delving deeper into their faith.</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, thousands of spiritual directors are being
trained each year in more than 200 spiritual formation centers,
according to Spiritual Directors International.</TE>
<TE>   At divinity schools across the country, including those at Duke
and Wake Forest universities, it's now recommended that students seek
out a director.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, many Protestant clergy members say having a personal
spiritual director is so helpful to their own ministry that they
consider it a job requirement.</TE>
<TE>   More significant, perhaps, the practice is spreading among
laypeople, both Christian and to a smaller extent Jewish, eager to
locate God in their lives and willing to pay $85 to $100 once a month
for an hourlong session. (Most directors will not refuse people
unable to pay and have a sliding scale for those of modest income.)</TE>
<TE>   "As churches grow in membership, people realize they can't look to
the church for everything," said Rose Mary Dougherty, a Roman
Catholic nun and program director at the Shalem Institute for
Spiritual Formation in Bethesda, Md.</TE>
<TE>   "There are times in their lives when they need a personal
companion to help them pay attention to the deep inner direction of
the Holy Spirit."</TE>
<TE>   For Bass and Mothershead, the work of spiritual direction was
dramatic.</TE>
<TE>   Guided by images of Abraham being called by God to go "to the land
I will show you," the couple said they set aside their expectations
that life is a quest for more money, more status, more possessions.</TE>
<TE>   "We more and more see Christianity as being countercultural," Bass
said. "The most important thing isn't the income, but serving
people."</TE>
<TE>   Their growing spiritual awareness came about through the work of
their director, whose main job was to listen and occasionally ask a
question.</TE>
<TE>   The couple insist the changes they made were their own.</TE>
<TE>   To many Christians, Jesus was the first spiritual director.
Shortly after his resurrection, Jesus walked alongside two disciples
on the road to Emmaus.</TE>
<TE>   As they approached their destination, the disciples pleaded with
Jesus:</TE>
<TE>   "'Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over.'
So he went in to stay with them," according to Luke 24:29.</TE>
<TE>   Spiritual directors say that is what they do: Stay with people.</TE>
<TE>   The practice of "holy listening" was honed by such great spiritual
masters as St. Teresa of Avila, St. John of the Cross and, in the
16th century, St. Ignatius of Loyola, who developed a series of
spiritual exercises to help people open up to the mystery of God.</TE>
<TE>   Catholics have practiced spiritual direction for years as a way of
helping people in religious orders clarify their vows.</TE>
<TE>   Now non-Catholics and church members are seeing it as a tool to
sharpen their personal vows.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to psychotherapy or pastoral counseling, which is
aimed at solving a problem or correcting behavior, spiritual
direction assumes a person is already whole but may need help paying
attention to what is most meaningful or godlike in his or her life.</TE>
<TE>   Many say the word "director" is misleading; it harks back to the
days when the church could tell people how to live. Many directors
prefer to describe themselves as companions or friends. Some women
find the image of the midwife useful.</TE>
<TE>   Dougherty, the Catholic nun who teaches spiritual direction, likes
to use an African proverb to explain the relationship: "The reason
two antelopes walk together is so one can blow the dust from the
other's eyes."</TE>
<TE>   Directors say people come to them for a variety of reasons. Some
come to shore up their faith. Others are stuck with a child's
understanding of faith and want a more mature perspective.</TE>
<TE>   And increasingly, some people need help letting go of distractions
and finding time for silence and deep contemplation.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the most important things is to encourage people when they
find their lives difficult," said the Rev. Jim Devereaux, a retired
Jesuit priest who works as a spiritual director at his home in Chapel
Hill, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   "The director must love the person he or she talks with and the
other person must sense that."</TE>
<TE>   Spiritual direction is not for everyone. But at a time when the
cross-pollination of religious tradition is at an all-time high,
educated laypeople are eager to try new approaches.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Larry Williams, a retired pastor of North Carolina's
Louisburg Baptist Church, said many people go through dry spells in
their faith.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, he said, "There were moralistic tones: 'You ought to
pray more or read the Bible more.'"</TE>
<TE>   Now, he said, people are finding the freedom to seek out help.
Williams is now helping other ministers learn more about spiritual
direction.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great gift to yourself," said Peggy Monti, 39, a mother
and a member of St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Church in Raleigh who
has received spiritual direction for eight years.</TE>
<TE>   "It establishes a discipline of pausing, if only once a month,"
she said, "to understand what's going on in your life and how God may
be stirring you to do one thing or another.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't take that pause, we'll miss it."</TE>

<HD>Rules Will Make It Easier to Force Inmates to Provide DNA</HD>
<DH>Law enforcement: Move comes as many prisoners refuse to
give samples voluntarily for databank used to solve crimes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTINA BOXALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Criticized for not being sufficiently diligent in obtaining the DNA
of state prison inmates, the Department of Corrections says it will
rewrite regulations to allow guards to more easily use force when
prisoners refuse to give samples.</LD>
<LD>   The move comes as the Legislature considers a bill that would drop
a Corrections Department requirement that guards obtain a court order
before using reasonable force in collecting genetic samples for the
state's DNA databank.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter earlier this month to the bill's sponsor, Director
Edward Alameida Jr. said the Corrections Department had concluded
that existing law allows "it to take these samples involuntarily, and
that the growing number of inmates refusing to be sampled compels our
decision to move forward."</LD>
<TE>   The department estimates there are roughly 900 prisoners in the
state system who have refused to give blood and saliva samples for
the databank, used to search for suspects in unsolved crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Although California was one of the first states to create such a
databank, it has trailed behind national leaders in collecting inmate
samples and comparing them to genetic evidence from unsolved crimes.
An infusion of cash and manpower in recent years has pushed the
program forward, but complaints remain that the state is far short of
exploiting the databank's potential for solving old crimes.</TE>
<TE>   In outlining the department's plans to rewrite its use-of-force
rules, Alameida said he believes the revision will make the proposed
legislation unnecessary. Once prisoners know force can be used, most
will cooperate, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The bill's sponsor, state Sen. Jim Brulte (R-Rancho Cucamonga),
said he has no intention of dropping the measure.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the letter is nothing but, 'OK, there's an issue out
there and this is an election year and we may need to get out in
front of it,'" he said.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Brulte said the Corrections Department has indicated the
new rules will not be in place until the beginning of next year.</TE>
<TE>   The bill, if passed soon and signed into law, could speed up that
schedule by months, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The use-of-force proposal is now before the Senate Public Safety
Committee, where Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San
Francisco) has raised questions about it.</TE>
<TE>   Burton and Brulte say they believe those differences can be worked
out.</TE>

<HD>J. Siderman, 90; Sued Over 'Dirty War'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK J. McDONNELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jose "Pepe" Siderman, who fled his native Argentina during the
military regime's "dirty war" that targeted opponents and later won a
landmark human rights case against the South American nation, died
Wednesday in Los Angeles. He was 90 and died of causes associated
with old age.</LD>
<LD>   A courtly former businessman whose elegant demeanor bespoke Old
World values, Siderman was kidnapped and tortured by Argentina's
military government, which also looted his family's property and
assets, once valued at more than $25 million.</LD>
<LD>   Siderman was one of the survivors of the brutal period of military
rule that began in 1976 and eventually claimed more than 10,000
lives. Most of the victims disappeared without a trace.</LD>
<TE>   After moving to the United States, Siderman and his family pursued
a legal fight that culminated in 1996, when Buenos Aires agreed to
settle damage claims.</TE>
<TE>   "This decision is the dream of my life," Siderman said shortly
after the case was settled, speaking at his son's Santa Monica home.
"This shows that, with persistence, human rights can prevail."</TE>
<TE>   At a memorial service Friday at Hillside Memorial Park in Los
Angeles, family members recalled Siderman's steadfastness.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, Pepe embodied the word 'honor,'" said his granddaughter
Marcela Siderman, 28, of Los Angeles. "He lived his life with
honor.... He fought for what was just and right. He was patient and
kind and generous and always dignified."</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers representing Siderman, led by the American Civil Liberties
Union, were able to win a precedent-setting U.S. Court of Appeals
ruling allowing the case against Argentina to proceed in U.S. federal
courts. The appeals panel rejected Argentina's claims of immunity.</TE>
<TE>   The much-publicized case also added to the voluminous
documentation of the seven-year dirty war and its nefarious subtext
of anti-Semitism. Many of Argentina's military men were admirers of
Adolf Hitler and Germany's Nazi regime. Yet Argentina is a nation
regarded by many of its citizens as the most European, and civilized,
in Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   "At various points I didn't know if I was dead or alive," Siderman
said in a statement filed in court, recalling seven days of torture
that included beatings, deprivation of food and water, and electric
shocks--all while he was blindfolded.</TE>
<TE>   "I lived Dante's stories of hell, the inferno. I could see animals
flying. I saw everything that Dante had written about."</TE>
<TE>   Siderman recalled the shouted epithets--"dirty Jew!"--as armed
goons pounded on his front door March 24, 1976, when a coup d'etat
shattered the prosperous existence of the Siderman family.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no doubt that this disgrace happened to us because we were
Jewish," Siderman said.</TE>
<TE>   Upon his release, he said, a note was left in his pocket.</TE>
<TE>   He was warned to leave or face death. The family fled Argentina,
eventually landing in the United States, where a daughter already
lived. Siderman became a naturalized U.S. citizen.</TE>
<TE>   During the legal battle, Argentine authorities never directly
denied Siderman's allegations of kidnapping, torture and forced
exile. But Buenos Aires fiercely disputed his right to sue in a U.S.
court.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. appeals court disagreed, leading to a reported $6-million
settlement by the Argentine government.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. court's decision was unique in that it provided an
opening for foreign governments to be held accountable for abuses
that occurred abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Born and raised in Argentina, Siderman was the product of a
classic Eastern European immigrant family, one of the multitudes that
fled poverty and oppression in Europe to settle in the New World. His
parents were Ukrainians who left imperial Russia for South America
and began a business installing parquet floors.</TE>
<TE>   Siderman said he never imagined that the nation's politics would
turn so ugly.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted my children to have a good, comfortable life--after all
that's why I worked so hard for so many decades," Siderman said in a
court statement. "Before I die I want to see justice done."</TE>
<TE>   Surviving Siderman are his wife, Lea "Lela" Siderman; his three
children, Alicia and Carlos of Southern California, and Susana of
Florida; seven grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Alleged Victim Sobs as Case Goes to Jury</HD>
<DH>Priest: Deliberations on the sex abuse charges begin after
prosecution says the Catholic cleric's accusers want people like him
'eliminated from the church.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SANTA ROSA</DL>
<LD>As jurors here prepared Friday to decide the fate of Father Donald
Kimball, a Roman Catholic priest charged with rape and molestation,
his chief accusers and their families seemed overcome by the moment.</LD>
<LD>   One woman, who alleged that Kimball raped her in 1977 beside a
church altar when she was 14 and then arranged for an abortion,
shuddered with sobs in the courtroom as the panel heard the last
arguments, then left to begin deliberations.</LD>
<LD>   Afterward, the woman, now 38 and the mother of nine children,
fought back tears as she excused herself from an interview with a
cluster of TV news crews.</LD>
<TE>   "I've got a lot of emotions right now," she murmured before
wandering down a courthouse corridor.</TE>
<TE>   Her mother was left on a bench, surrounded by reporters. She
marveled at all they had been through, and expressed hope that some
good would come of the trial, if not for the victims, then for the
Catholic Church, caught in a nationwide scandal over long-silenced
sexual misconduct by priests.</TE>
<TE>   "The church is changing," said the mother, who still attends
Kimball's former parish. "Eyes are opening in the hierarchy. One day,
families will trust the church again."</TE>
<TE>   But for now, she draws a distinction between faith in God and hope
that the institution will reform itself. The church, she said,
remains "a business," but religious creed "is something inside you."</TE>
<TE>   Kimball was a popular youth minister in the 1970s, dubbed the
"rock 'n' roll priest" because he used Top 40 music to help deliver a
message about Catholicism. For a time, he even had a radio program
broadcast around the country.</TE>
<TE>   His accusers--eight women testified that he abused them, although
the charges focus on only two--say the clergyman used counseling
sessions as an excuse to turn hugs into back rubs and then into
molestation.</TE>
<TE>   Though he resigned from the priesthood more than a decade ago,
Kimball remains active in a program that caters to young people.</TE>
<TE>   And that doesn't sit well with his accusers or their families.</TE>
<TE>   One mother, whose now-grown daughter has charged that Kimball
molested her in 1981, said the priest had destroyed the abiding faith
of trusting children.</TE>
<TE>   "They were so innocent," she said. "They went to him for good
things. Instead they got bad."</TE>
<TE>   She wants prison time for the priest, who could be behind bars for
eight years if convicted. But she professes no anger at him.</TE>
<TE>   "I have sadness, very, very deep sadness," she said. "I hope
someday I'll be able to go to the church and not cry."</TE>
<TE>   Gail Machado, an accuser's aunt, said she had struggled with
Kimball's "total and complete betrayal."</TE>
<TE>   "I look at him now and I can't even envision him in a cleric's
collar," she said. "In my heart, I know he must know what he's
done.... It's an illness, but at some point in any illness you
realize you're sick and do something about it."</TE>
<TE>   Kimball, 58, sat impassively through the closing arguments,
avoiding eye contact with his accusers.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's stressed," said Chris Andrian, Kimball's attorney,
after the jury began deliberations.</TE>
<TE>   During the trial, Andrian attempted to poke holes in the testimony
of Kimball's accusers, saying that they embellished stories in hopes
of making money off the church. In 2000, the Santa Rosa diocese
settled a civil lawsuit with the women for $1.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   Kimball has denied the charges, but has admitted having sex with a
few of the women when they became adults. He did not testify.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not here to apologize for him," Andrian said after the case
went to deliberations. "My job is to present evidence that casts some
doubt."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary Medvigy said there was no doubt.</TE>
<TE>   "Until this defendant is held responsible for these actions, he
remains a danger to society," Medvigy said in his closing arguments
Friday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Medvigy said that Kimball's accusers were intent not on money, but
on "trying to make a difference" by taking a stand against
disreputable priests. "They want the Don Kimballs eliminated from the
church."</TE>
<TE>   During the trial, Medvigy tried to show a pattern of abuse by
recounting the testimony of six other women who alleged that the
priest inappropriately touched them during private counseling
sessions that often took place in his bedroom. Though no charges were
brought in those alleged incidents, Medvigy said they helped
corroborate stories about Kimball's behavior.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, he said the best evidence was Kimball's admission to
church officials when confronted with allegations of sexual
molestations. The prosecutor ruefully noted that Kimball even seemed
to play down the cases, telling church officials that "at least I
didn't touch boys."</TE>

<HD>Francis X. Murphy, 87; Priest and Writer Told of Vatican II
Intrigue</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAEME ZIELINSKI</AU>
<BD>THE WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Father Francis X. Murphy, an author whose puckish and revealing
insider dispatches from the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s set
the tone for popular views of the extraordinary Roman Catholic
conclave, has died. He was 87.</LD>
<LD>   Murphy, the former rector of Holy Redeemer College in Washington,
D.C., died Thursday at Anne Arundel Medical Center in Annapolis, Md.
He had Parkinson's disease and recently had cancer surgery.</LD>
<LD>   Working under a pseudonym in a series of 13 elegantly written
articles for the New Yorker from 1962 to 1965, Murphy caused a
sensation in the marble halls of the Vatican, where the whole of the
Catholic hierarchy was meeting to debate and institute fundamental
changes in doctrine and teaching.</LD>
<TE>   The magazine articles whetted an appetite for news about the
church among the secular press, particularly in the English-speaking
world, and, as he later wrote, prompted the oft-asked question, "Who
the hell is Xavier Rynne?"</TE>
<TE>   Despite the priest's prolific and elaborate denials, which
involved what he jokingly called an "assiduous use of casuistry,"
many observers of the council figured out early on that the author
was in fact Murphy, who at the time was a professor based in Rome and
a linguist working as a translator for the American bishops.</TE>
<TE>   But it was only in the late 1970s that the Redemptorist priest
publicly acknowledged being Xavier Rynne, which was a combination of
his middle name and his mother's maiden name. He admitted his
authorship because, he wrote: "If I died tomorrow, the Jesuits would
claim [Rynne], and the Redemptorists would be delighted to be rid of
him."</TE>
<TE>   During the council and afterward, Murphy, using his own name, also
wrote widely on Catholicism and the papacy for other publications and
was a favorite guest of TV networks.</TE>
<TE>   He used his facility with language, theology and history to
promote and defend the various liberal movements within the church
that were cresting at Vatican Council II, including successful
efforts to have the liturgy said in the native language of the
congregants, ecumenical outreach to Protestants and the Orthodox
Church, and a redefinition of the pope's authority in relation to the
bishops.</TE>
<TE>   In a typical passage, Murphy characterized the ruling hierarchy as
employing "a fear-inspired ruthlessness in dealing with every
semblance of nonconformity in theological thought, and a
determination to explain the traditional doctrines of the church only
within a rigid and static framework."</TE>
<TE>   Murphy had been an editor for the New Catholic Encyclopedia and
had already written for scholarly journals and Catholic publications
when he began collecting notes on the intrigue in Rome preceding the
council.</TE>
<TE>   He submitted an article to a literary agent who later put him in
touch with William Shawn, the New Yorker editor.</TE>
<TE>   Foreseeing the explosive nature of the material, Shawn argued for
Murphy to remain anonymous.</TE>
<TE>   The debut article, written as a "Letter From Vatican City," was
published in 1962 at the start of the council's first session.</TE>
<TE>   It exposed some uncomfortable truths about a Roman curia that
jealously guarded its secrecy.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a general line out of the Vatican that everything was
in agreement," James O'Neill, who at the time was a reporter in the
Rome bureau of the National Catholic News Service, said in an
interview this week. Rynne's article "just ripped off the mask of
tranquillity and calm and serenity that had been floating around."</TE>
<TE>   The New Yorker pieces were collected and published as "Vatican
Council II" in 1968. The four volumes had a second printing in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   A native of the Bronx, N.Y., Murphy was the son of Irish
immigrants. His father was a policeman and his mother was a hotel
concierge.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy entered the Redemptorist seminary when he was 14 years old
and was ordained a priest in 1940. His superiors encouraged him from
an early age to pursue writing. He received a master's degree and
doctorate in history from Catholic University.</TE>
<TE>   After serving at a church in New York and as a naval chaplain in
Annapolis, he was an Army chaplain from 1951 to 1958. In that period,
he was on the front lines in the Korean War. He attained the rank of
captain and received a Bronze Star for offering Mass as mortar shells
fell about him. He later worked with relief efforts in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy had lived in Annapolis since 1985 and served as a priest at
St. Mary's Catholic Church there and St. Christopher Catholic Church
on Kent Island, Md. He was rector at Holy Redeemer and lived in
Washington from 1977 to 1985.</TE>
<TE>   Reached by a Redemptorist publication in 2001, he described his
daily routine: "I say my prayers. I don't make any fetish about it. I
say good morning to God and go about my business."</TE>
<TE>   Survivors include two sisters.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A tanker truck leaking highly flammable liquid oxygen shut down the
Ventura Freeway on Friday, snarling traffic and leading to the
evacuation of four businesses.</LD>
<LD>   The truck was unloading 4,400 gallons of the liquid at Apria
Healthcare on Trabajo Drive when the leak occurred. The oxygen
combined with air to form clouds of white vapor that drifted over the
freeway, Oxnard fire officials said. As a precaution, the freeway was
closed between Rice and Central avenues from 11 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.</LD>

<HD>For Sale: A Piece of the Old West</HD>
<DH>Nostalgia: Victorville building housing the Roy Rogers-Dale
Evans Museum goes on the block, but not Trigger or the other items on
display or in storage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The sprawling building housing the financially troubled Roy
Rogers-Dale Evans Museum in the Mojave Desert town of Victorville is
for sale.</LD>
<LD>   The 33,000-square-foot structure on 50 acres beside Interstate 15
displays a collection paying homage to the "King of the Cowboys" and
the "Queen of the West," who starred together in more than 30 motion
pictures and two television series. He died in 1998 and she died last
year.</LD>
<LD>   The couple's son, Roy "Dusty" Rogers Jr., said Friday that the
sale would not include the approximately 100,000 items stored or
displayed at the museum, including Rogers' stuffed and mounted horse,
Trigger, and his dog, Bullet.</LD>
<TE>   "It's the building and the property that are for sale," Rogers
said. "The [collection] will never be for sale."</TE>
<TE>   Several important pieces of the collection, however, have already
been sold.</TE>
<TE>   Roy Roger's gold-, silver- and ruby-studded saddle and matching
chaps and spurs were auctioned off for $670,000 in January to satisfy
the family's estate tax bill of more than $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Also sold were some of the couples' clothes and hats, some movie
posters and Roy Rogers' favorite bowling shirt and ball.</TE>
<TE>   Dusty Rogers said declining attendance since the death of his
parents has cut museum revenues and forced him to seek a more
promising location.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, people just blitz by us at 85 [mph] on their way to
Las Vegas," he said. "And Mom and Dad's fans are getting older. We
need to go where those people are."</TE>
<TE>   Rogers said he's thinking of relocating "somewhere in the Midwest,
maybe a place like Branson, Mo., the country music capital."</TE>
<TE>   He estimated that the museum building in Victorville--built to
look like a Western fort--and the land surrounding it could bring as
much as $5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers said the museum will remain open until a sale is
consummated.</TE>
<TE>   "That'll probably be at least a year," he said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge agreed Friday to delay sentencing for a woman convicted in
the dog-mauling death of her neighbor, to give the defense time to
argue for a new trial.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge James Warren moved sentencing from May 10 to
June 7 after an attorney for Marjorie Knoller argued that the
evidence against her was insufficient.</LD>
<LD>   Knoller, 46, was found guilty of second-degree murder and could
face 15 years to life in prison. Her neighbor, Diane Whipple, 33, was
fatally mauled Jan. 26, 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Sentencing for Knoller's husband, Robert Noel, 60, was also
delayed. He was convicted of manslaughter and having a mischievous
dog that killed someone.</TE>

<LD>A convicted child molester locked up in a state mental facility under
the state's law on sexually violent predators wants Santa Cruz County
to pay for his castration.</LD>
<LD>   Gregory Donald Grant, committed to Atascadero State Hospital since
1998, told a judge Thursday that he wants the county to pay to have
his testicles removed so his chances for parole would improve.</LD>
<LD>   County spokeswoman Dinah Phillips said the county is researching
the matter.</LD>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Christine McGuire said she does not see such
surgery as an appropriate expense for the county.</TE>

kidnapping, forcibly molesting and sexually assaulting an 8-year-old
boy in a motel.</TE>

<HD>Harassment Lawsuit Takes a Lurid Turn</HD>
<DH>Courts: San Bernardino County files a graphic response to a
fired worker's charges. Her side calls it a ploy to embarrass her.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Bernardino County supervisors know a thing or two about scandal.
After all, this is the place where four county executives have been
prosecuted for accepting kickbacks and a sitting supervisor is
fighting a federal indictment for fraud.</LD>
<LD>   So when office worker Theresa Bushey sued Dist. Atty. Dennis Stout
in October, charging that she was fired for threatening a sexual
harassment complaint, supervisors didn't mind firing back with lurid
accusations of their own.</LD>
<LD>   Bushey, 44, charges that Stout often asked about her sex life and
frequently talked about women and their breasts. Her suit charges
that she was fired in August after rebuffing his advances and
threatening a sexual harassment complaint.</LD>
<TE>   In an unusual response to the suit filed March 20, the county
charges that it was Bushey, not Stout, who couldn't stop talking in
the office about sex.</TE>
<TE>   A mild summary of the accusations: She talked about her
boyfriend's inadequate anatomy; she talked about her inability to be
sexually satisfied; she talked about voyeurism and other forms of
sexual activity.</TE>
<TE>   It was such behavior that led to her firing, county spokesman
David Wert said, and not any sexual misconduct on the part of the
district attorney.</TE>
<TE>   "Although the language in the answer might seem shocking to some,
the county used considerable restraint," Wert said. "The language
could have been much more explicit and shocking had the county used
all it had gathered during its investigation."</TE>
<TE>   County supervisors "agonized over taking this approach," Wert
said. "But they felt they could not back down because of how the
county might look. Their only concern was protecting the taxpayers."</TE>
<TE>   Hogwash, said Bushey's outraged attorney, Vincent Nolan. County
attorneys, he said, went out of their way to create a court document
so embarrassing to his client and her boyfriend--identified by those
familiar with the case as a high-ranking county official--that Bushey
would be too ashamed to continue.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never seen in my 23 years of law something like this occur
in any other case," said Nolan. "This was designed to humiliate her
and drive her out of the case. But I can tell you, that's not going
to happen."</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Dennis Hansberger said Bushey simply needs to
know what she's up against. "It's our responsibility to say to
Theresa, 'This is the story we will tell in court and you need to
know that,'" Hansberger said.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Stout nor his attorney, Geoffrey Hopper, would discuss the
case. But some employees within the district attorney's office
question the county's motives.</TE>
<TE>   "My understanding was that the attitude from the county was,
'Fight fire with fire,'" said Deputy Dist. Atty. Dan Lough--who is
embroiled in an unrelated lawsuit against the district attorney's
office. But "people have a hard time believing conduct like this
occurs in the executive offices in the D.A.'s office."</TE>
<TE>   Like every other scandal that has rocked the county in recent
years, the talk will become old news soon enough--especially now that
Stout has decided to abandon his bid for reelection after he garnered
35% of the vote in the March primary.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't help that at the time of the election, Stout was trying
to overcome a scandal of his own: Court documents revealed that Stout
and his aides secretly helped a candidate challenging incumbent
Supervisor Jerry Eaves in 2000. At the time, Stout's office was
investigating Eaves--who won reelection but since has been indicted
by federal prosecutors--in connection to an alleged bribery scheme.</TE>

<HD>Tests Show Huntington Beach's Seaside Bathrooms Didn't Shut
Down the Shore</HD>
<DH>High bacteria count has made a stretch of the oceanfront
off-limits to swimmers again. Officials fear a repeat of devastation
caused by lengthy closure in 1999.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Beach bathrooms are not the cause of high bacteria counts that forced
county health officials to close nearly a half-mile stretch of
Huntington State Beach this week, leaving officials with a mystery
disturbingly reminiscent of the devastating 1999 beach closure.</LD>
<LD>   That closure, which put miles of beach in the city off-limits for
two months during the height of the tourist season, also started with
mysterious spikes in bacteria levels.</LD>
<LD>   The cause has never been determined.</LD>
<TE>   Testing on Thursday and Friday ruled out three public bathrooms on
the beach near Magnolia Street as sources, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "All preliminary information is that we do not have any leaking
sewer lines at any of the three locations," said Don Ito, the state
parks superintendent in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators still need on Monday to check two short lines that
hook into the sanitation district's sewer system, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Regional water officials might ask for more ocean monitoring to
determine whether a sewage plume released more than four miles
offshore is drifting back to the coast, said Monica Mazur, a
spokeswoman for the Orange County Health Care Agency.</TE>
<TE>   A massive sewer line that runs along the beach will probably be
retested, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Sanitation District has long maintained that its
partly treated sewage is trapped offshore by differences in ocean
temperatures.</TE>
<TE>   But a recent study by Scripps Institute of Oceanography and UC
Irvine found otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   "That is very, very disturbing," Huntington Beach Councilwoman
Shirley S. Dettloff said of the latest closure.</TE>
<TE>   "What is for me the most distressing part of this is we've done so
much to try to find out what the sources are and we've done so many
things so we won't have a problem," said Dettloff, who also is a
member of the California Coastal Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The city, county, Orange County Sanitation District and other
agencies have spent millions of dollars studying the city's coast.</TE>
<TE>   Millions of gallons of urban runoff are being diverted.</TE>
<TE>   And the sanitation district plans to disinfect its sewage with
bleach or an acid used to sterilize hospital equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Dettloff is concerned about another drawn-out summer of mysterious
pollution.</TE>
<TE>   "Not finding the source immediately is not only going to cause a
lot of expense ... it's something that will affect our economy even
more this time," Dettloff said.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists said that the pollution has become expected.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like we've all been dragged through a war here," said
Christopher J. Evans, executive director of the Surfrider Foundation,
based in San Clemente.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a little bit shellshocked. There is a fear [that the 1999
closures are] going to happen all over again but I have to say, it's
not a dramatic fear because we have a background of dirty beaches in
Orange County, in Los Angeles County and in San Diego County.</TE>
<TE>   "We're well known for it now."</TE>

<HD>J.W. Stanton, 78; Ex-World Bank Official, Ohio GOP
Congressman</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>J. William Stanton, a former Republican congressman from Ohio who
championed world banking and hunger issues for nearly two decades,
has died. He was 78.</LD>
<LD>   Stanton died of undisclosed causes Thursday at St. Luke's Hospital
in Jacksonville, Fla. He spent the winter months in the city.</LD>
<LD>   He served in Congress from 1964 to 1983, then served a decade as
counselor to the president of the World Bank. "He was a mentor to me
and someone that I sought out for advice constantly," said Rep. Steve
LaTourette, a fellow Republican who now represents Stanton's
northeast Ohio district.</LD>
<TE>   In Congress, Stanton was a key member of what was then called the
House Banking Committee, on which he was the top Republican.</TE>
<TE>   He was born in Painesville, Ohio, where his father, Frank, was an
early employee of Ford Motor Co. The Stanton family later operated
J.W. Stanton Motors Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Stanton was in the Army during World War II, serving in the
Pacific, and was discharged with the rank of captain. He earned his
bachelor's degree at Georgetown University after the war and returned
to Ohio to run the family's automobile business. He then became
involved in county politics.</TE>
<TE>   "When I ran for county commissioner in Lake County in 1956, I
hadn't even decided whether I was a Democrat or a Republican,"
Stanton told the Cleveland Plain Dealer in 1992. "My grandfather
would have turned over in his grave to know I became a Republican."</TE>
<TE>   Stanton said the most exciting part of his career came after he
left Congress and began traveling the world for the Washington-based
World Bank, which helps establish credit for poor countries that need
schools and hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Peggy, and a daughter, Kelly Marie.</TE>

<HD>W.A. Stewart, 71; Embraced Black English</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>William A. Stewart, a linguist who was one of the first to champion
the controversial concept that black English is different enough from
standard English to be considered a separate language, died March 25
in New York. He was 71.</LD>
<LD>   The cause of death was congestive heart failure induced by
diabetes, said a spokesman for the City University of New York
Graduate Center, where Stewart had taught since 1973.</LD>
<LD>   Stewart put forward his ideas about black English, or what has
become known as Ebonics, in the early 1960s, when most scholars
either ignored or denied the existence of a black vernacular.</LD>
<TE>   He not only believed that black English was as distinct a language
as, say, French or German, he believed it should be embraced by
schools with low-achieving black youngsters as a bridge to teaching
them standard English.</TE>
<TE>   "He was one of the founding figures in the movement to teach black
children standard English as a separate language, and argued
passionately for that approach until the end of his life," said John
H. McWhorter, a professor of linguistics at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   A descendant of Scottish missionaries, Stewart was born in the
cultural melting pot of Honolulu and grew up speaking English,
Spanish, Portuguese and Hawaiian.</TE>
<TE>   Moved to California As a Young Boy</TE>
<TE>   He moved to California with his parents when he was about 8 and
eventually added German, French, Dutch, Wolof, Haitian, Sranan,
Gullah and Papiamento to the list of languages in which he was
proficient.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart was drafted into the Army and served as a translator in
Paris and Frankfurt. After completing his military service, he earned
a bachelor's and a master's degree from UCLA in 1955 and 1958,
respectively.</TE>
<TE>   His outspoken nature landed him in a Brazilian jail when he was a
Fulbright scholar in that country in 1959-60. He was arrested for
heckling a Brazilian general during a speech and was not allowed to
contact the U.S. embassy for assistance because he spoke Portuguese
so well that the Brazilian authorities did not believe he was an
American.</TE>
<TE>   In 1960, he became a staff linguist at the Center for Applied
Linguistics in Washington, D.C., which led to travels in Africa and
the Caribbean.</TE>
<TE>   While at the center he also tutored young black children who were
having difficulty learning to read. He and a colleague, Joan Baratz,
tape-recorded the children's conversations and produced a series of
readers that incorporated their nonstandard English expressions.
Using the primers, the children quickly learned to read.</TE>
<TE>   In 1968, Stewart and Baratz formed the Education Study Center in
Washington, which was devoted to helping inner-city children learn to
read by building on the black English they spoke at home.</TE>
<TE>   They distributed their primers to several Roman Catholic schools
in the Washington area, planning to switch the students over to
standard English texts as soon as they began to read.</TE>
<TE>   But a hailstorm of protest quickly engulfed the project.</TE>
<TE>   "Some misinformed people got the wrong idea, that he was trying to
teach them how to speak [black] dialect," said J.L. Dillard, a
linguist who worked with Stewart at the Center for Applied
Linguistics and later wrote a definitive text called "Black English."</TE>
<TE>   "They kind of hounded him out of the school system," Dillard
recalled.</TE>
<TE>   In 1973, Stewart won a National Science Foundation grant to study
the evolution of Gullah, a Creole dialect that he believed gave rise
to black English.</TE>
<TE>   Gullah was spoken largely by rural blacks living on the
southeastern coast of the United States, from South Carolina to
Florida. He documented many of its features, such as "he busy" to
mean he is busy at the moment, and "he be busy" to mean he is always
busy.</TE>
<TE>   These grammatical peculiarities had been widely seen by educators
as evidence of ignorance or linguistic carelessness, but Stewart
demonstrated that Gullah speakers adhered to rules of speech as
logical as those in standard English.</TE>
<TE>   "People are not prepared for evidence that the vocabulary and
grammar of Gullah can approach the awesome level of standard
English," he told the New York Times in 1977. "For teachers, this is
terrifying. The notion that their own educational framework is
totally inconsequential--that scares them."</TE>
<TE>   In 1984, after teaching appointments at Georgetown University,
Johns Hopkins University and Teachers College at Columbia University,
he became a full professor at the CUNY Graduate Center, where he
taught various courses.</TE>
<TE>   He was called as an expert witness in the landmark Lau case in
1974, which led to the establishment of bilingual education in
California. He also testified in a 1979 Michigan case that forced
educators in the Ann Arbor school district to understand and cope
with black English.</TE>
<TE>   Less far-reaching but attention-grabbing was his role in a 1986
dispute between the owners of Caesars Palace in Las Vegas and New
York developer Donald Trump. Trump wanted to change the name of his
Atlantic City hotel-casino from Trump Plaza to Trump Palace. Caesars
won in part because the court accepted Stewart's conclusion that
"palace" was a protected term in the gaming world.</TE>
<TE>   Dillard said he and Stewart were regarded as "dangerous radicals"
in the 1960s for calling black English a separate and legitimate
language. But Stewart, he said, "was the most dangerous of all,
because he was the most outspoken and most knowledgeable."</TE>
<TE>   Oakland Effort Stirred a Furor</TE>
<TE>   Although Stewart's approach did not catch on elsewhere, it has
continued to reverberate in places where educators are desperate for
ways to raise the scholastic achievement of black youngsters.</TE>
<TE>   In Oakland, for instance, the school board in 1996 recognized
Ebonics as a valid language and declared that teachers should learn
to respect it. The action caused an international furor, and the
Oakland school system has since backed away from the policy.</TE>
<TE>   In such arenas, the pro-black-English debate has sometimes been
harmed by proponents who lack scholarly credentials. Stewart's
pioneering studies of the history and evolution of black English
"made serious study possible," said John Roy, a professor of
linguistics and English at Brooklyn College in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart, who never married, left no immediate survivors.</TE>

misrepresented the phrases "he busy" and "he be busy" as belonging to the
Creole dialect of Gullah. They are examples of American black English.

<HD>Marvin Warner, 82; Head of Failed Bank</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>OCALA, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Marvin L. Warner, who headed Cincinnati-based Home State Savings Bank
when it collapsed in 1985, triggering a run on savings and loans in
Ohio, died Monday. He was 82.</LD>
<LD>   Warner suffered heart failure in Cape Canaveral, Fla., where he
planned to watch the launch of the space shuttle Atlantis.</LD>
<LD>   The collapse of Home State Savings Bank drained Ohio's private
savings and loan insurance fund, and caused then-Gov. Richard Celeste
to close 69 thrifts.</LD>
<TE>   Warner was convicted on nine counts of fraud-related charges in
1987, and served two years and four months in an Ohio prison.</TE>
<TE>   About 90,000 people lost access to $143 million in savings because
of Warner's investments in ESM Government Securities Inc., which sold
bonds to governments, institutions and individuals.</TE>
<TE>   Florida-based ESM sent out false financial statements that
portrayed it as healthy when it was deeply in debt. ESM closed in
1985 after federal authorities charged it with fraud.</TE>
<TE>   It took years for savers to regain their money. The recovery
included $102 million from state-filed lawsuits, including $4.5
million from a settlement of Warner's bankruptcy. The rest came from
the sale of real estate, apartment buildings, offices and other
properties owned by Home State.</TE>
<TE>   After his release from prison, Warner moved to his 150-acre horse
farm in Ocala, sheltered from creditors under Florida's "homestead"
law.</TE>
<TE>   Warner's family owned a bakery in Birmingham, Ala., the city where
Warner was born and raised. He was in the Army during World War II,
serving in the Pacific, and was discharged with the rank of major.</TE>
<TE>   A gifted orator in high school, Warner attended the University of
Alabama on a scholarship, and earned his undergraduate and law
degrees there.</TE>
<TE>   He purchased Home State Savings Bank in 1958, and through his
career bought and sold several financial institutions, including
selling Century Banks of Fort Lauderdale to Sun Bank of Orlando.</TE>
<TE>   Warner also was one of 13 part-owners of the New York Yankees from
1973 to 1975. He also had ownership stakes in the NFL's Tampa Bay
Buccaneers and the Birmingham Stallions of the now defunct USFL. He
was a prominent horseman and owner of Warnerton Farms.</TE>
<TE>   From 1977 to 1981, Warner served as U.S. ambassador to Switzerland
under President Carter.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by a son and two daughters.</TE>

<LD>We take time to offer a much-needed hug and a pat on the back to
Angel fans.</LD>
<LD>   Does anyone have it worse? Not only do they suffer, they get
ridiculed.</LD>
<LD>   Being an Angel fan means long waits with little reward.</LD>
<TE>   Being an Angel fan means hearing ex-players, from Mo Vaughn to
Damion Easley, calling you out for your lax attitude.</TE>
<TE>   Being an Angel fan means sighing and admitting ... they're right.</TE>
<TE>   "They're totally telling the truth," said Bill Schaeffer, a
25-year-old sitting in the fourth row behind the Angels' dugout.
"We're too quiet. We need to get more into the game."</TE>
<TE>   Schaeffer's gear dates two logo changes, including a T-shirt and
cap with the periwinkle blue and winged A, and the "CA" from earlier
in the 1990s. Shaeffer attends 20-30 games a year, a figure he gives
almost apologetically.</TE>
<TE>   "But I read about them all the time on the newspaper and Internet,
[and follow] on radio and TV," he adds, as if he must account for the
time he doesn't come to the park.</TE>
<TE>   Should Angel fans need to justify themselves? Shouldn't the team
have to account for itself for not giving its faithful even one trip
to the World Series since its inception in 1961?</TE>
<TE>   There's no need to recap every struggle over the years. All you
need to know is that the first chapter of Ross Newhan's "The Anaheim
Angels: A Complete History" is titled, "The Parade of Agony."</TE>
<TE>   At least the Cubs, Red Sox and Indians made it to the World Series
at some point in the 20th century. And Boston and Cleveland went as
recently as the 1990s. Their fans are characterized as
long-suffering. Angel fans are just lame.</TE>
<TE>   Consider Easley's recent comments to the Detroit News.</TE>
<TE>   "I came from Anaheim, where fans kind of sat on their hands," said
Easley, who played for the Angels from 1992-96. "Even when you did
well, it was like, 'That's great.'</TE>
<TE>   "But you didn't feel like there was that community support. You
never got the sense they were behind you."</TE>
<TE>   Easley said he feels the support when he runs into people at the
store or restaurant in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   But it isn't there at the ballpark.</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers averaged only 24,016 fans a game last season and
finished more than 80,000 fans behind the Angels in the attendance
rankings (with one fewer home game).</TE>
<TE>   In fact, 10 teams drew fewer fans than the 2,000,917 who went to
Edison Field last season.</TE>
<TE>   From 1982 to 1987--when the stadium seated 65,000 and in a stretch
that included two division championships--the Angels drew between 2.4
million and 2.8 million fans every year.</TE>
<TE>   But Newsday's Jon Heyman called Anaheim "a baseball wasteland if
there ever was one."</TE>
<TE>   And Vaughn moaned about how much he missed "the attitude" of the
East Coast, so he went back there for less money.</TE>
<TE>   I gave Seattle Mariner outfielder Mark McLemore, who played the
first five years of his career in Anaheim, a chance to share his
thoughts on Angel fans.</TE>
<TE>   "Ooh, I would rather not go there," he said. "I would rather not
go there. I'll pass on that question."</TE>
<TE>   No love.</TE>
<TE>   I gave season-ticket holder Greg Jacobs a chance to respond, to
let those critical, evil ballplayers have it. He shrugged it off.</TE>
<TE>   "It's their prerogative," Jacobs, 31, said. "They can say what
they want."</TE>
<TE>   He'll keep coming out to the ballpark, as he has since he was 10.
He'll come regardless of how he's characterized, or how bad the team
is.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great place to relax and have a beer and watch the game
being played," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It's their money. If all they want to do after buying their
tickets is chill at the ballpark, that's fine with me.</TE>
<TE>   Does anybody have it worse than the Orange County sports fan?</TE>
<TE>   The Rams went to the Super Bowl before they moved to Anaheim, and
became exciting champions after they moved to St. Louis. They didn't
do anything to deserve better support in the last few years before
they left.</TE>
<TE>   The Mighty Ducks have given them one playoff run. That's it.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers teased the county by playing a few home games there
every year, and fans packed the Pond, even though the team wasn't
good.</TE>
<TE>   But Donald Sterling wouldn't commit, and now one of the most
entertaining teams in the NBA plays all its home games at Staples
Center.</TE>
<TE>   "We're kind of almost like second-class citizens down here,"
Schaeffer said.</TE>
<TE>   He acknowledges, though, "There is a difference between the East
Coast and the West Coast. You can see it when the Yankees are here.
Their fans are more vocal than we are. We need to be that way."</TE>
<TE>   But what's the price of passion? Ask Wally Joyner if he preferred
to play in Anaheim or Yankee Stadium, where a knife once landed in
front of him as he was running off the field.</TE>
<TE>   Fans in Orange County never booed Santa Claus--or, even worse,
Destiny's Child--the way they did in Philly.</TE>
<TE>   Easley's Detroit fans helped usher in the era of riot
"celebrations" by starting fires and overturning cars after the
Tigers had won the World Series in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   There are many words you could use to describe Angel fans, but
"disgrace" isn't one of them.</TE>
<TE>   "We might not have many of them, but the ones we do have, I think
are fantastic," Angel outfielder Darin Erstad said. "There's a group
of about 10,000 to 12,000 of them that are real loyal. I wish there
was more, but the ones that we have are great."</TE>
<TE>   Do intense fans make a difference for players?</TE>
<TE>   "I've never had to be motivated by crowd noise or anything,"
Erstad said. "So I guess I've never even thought about that."</TE>
<TE>   I guess he's in the right place.</TE>

<HD>Home Style Cooks the Angels Again</HD>
<DH>Baseball: They are 1-7 at Anaheim and have lost five in a
row after Hudson masters them in A's 5-1 win.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A crowd of 31,815 showed up at Edison Field Friday night, but the
Angels once again played like a team struggling with the discomforts
of home.</LD>
<LD>   They wasted a strong effort by pitcher Ramon Ortiz and a chance to
end Tim Hudson's domination of them in a 5-1 loss to the Oakland
Athletics.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels, who were swept by the Seattle Mariners to begin this
nine-game homestand, have lost five games in a row and are 1-7 at
home in a season only 10 games old.</LD>
<TE>   "We haven't swung the bats great, but we haven't got many breaks
either," designated hitter Brad Fullmer said. "We have to find a way
to get it done."</TE>
<TE>   If ever there were a time for the Angels to make a statement
against the division-rival A's, this was it. Oakland, which lost
slugger Jason Giambi to the New York Yankees, was coming off a 7-0
loss to the Texas Rangers, the first time the A's failed to score a
run since June 17, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   But the Angels were facing Hudson, a 26-year-old right-hander who
was 18-9 last season and went into the game with an 8-1 career record
and 3.16 earned-run average against the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Before the game, Angel Manager Mike Scioscia likened Hudson to
several talented young pitchers he caught during his career with the
Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   "He reminds me of Fernando Valenzuela, Orel Hershiser, Bobby Welch
and Steve Howe," Scioscia said. "All of them were extremely young,
but they had an advanced feel for pitching that made them pitch
beyond what you think their experience would predict."</TE>
<TE>   Predictably, Hudson kept the Angels in check.</TE>
<TE>   He gave up one run, nine hits, struck out five and walked only one
as he beat the Angels for the seventh consecutive time dating to
Sept. 26, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Garret Anderson, Troy Glaus and Fullmer, the Angels'
three-four-five hitters, were 0 for 12 against Hudson.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Mecir retired the Angels in order in the eighth and Billy Koch
pitched a perfect ninth.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been really on the edge the last week and haven't given
ourselves much of a chance," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz (1-1), coming off a 6-3 victory over the Texas Rangers last
Saturday, matched Hudson through six-plus innings but could not hold
a 1-0 lead. He gave up three runs, seven hits and struck out four in
six-plus innings.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels threatened in the first and third innings before
breaking through with a run in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Spiezio led off with a double into the right-field corner
and moved to third on Bengie Molina's single through the infield to
left. Adam Kennedy walked to load the bases before Hudson struck out
David Eckstein.</TE>
<TE>   Up stepped Darin Erstad, who had singled in the first and grounded
into an inning ending-double play in the third.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad hit a line drive up the middle that Hudson failed to glove.
Shortstop Miguel Tejada fielded the ball on a hop behind second base
and flipped the ball to second baseman Frank Menechino, but Kennedy
beat him to the bag, allowing Spiezio to score.</TE>
<TE>   It was all for naught, however, as the A's erased the lead with
three runs in the seventh with the aid of an Angel error.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz walked Eric Chavez to start the seventh and Tejada followed
with a single. Terrence Long then hit a short fly ball to left field
that hooked toward the foul line and fell in front of a charging
Anderson for a run-scoring single. Anderson tried to throw out Tejada
at third base, but he was charged with an error when the ball went
past Glaus and rolled toward the screen behind the plate. Tejada beat
the throw from Ortiz to Molina at home plate for a 2-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Ramon Hernandez followed with a single up the middle, scoring
Long, and Ortiz was replaced by Dennis Cook after walking Carlos
Pena.</TE>
<TE>   Tejada hit a two-run home run against Ben Weber in the eigth
inning to make it 5-1.</TE>

<LD>GolfWorld magazine reports that organizers of the recent Algarve
Portugal Open didn't offer a new car as a prize for a hole in one.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, anyone acing the 210-yard 16th hole would have won a
diamond tee worth about half a million dollars.</LD>
<LD>   The prize, displayed in a heated glass case inside the clubhouse,
was guarded by a rattlesnake.</LD>
<TE>   The classy tee went unclaimed.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: What is regarded as the most famous shot in Masters'
history?</TE>
<TE>   Unthinkable: Dave Hyde of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel says
maybe the Marlins deserve contraction after--get this--running out of
hot dogs in the fourth inning on opening night.</TE>
<TE>   "Is that even legal?" Hyde writes. "Isn't slathering a thick
overcoat of mustard over a jumbo dog one of those self-evident,
inalienable, constitutionally protected rights that separates nine
innings of America from a winter in Siberia?"</TE>
<TE>   Poor babies: The Portland Trail Blazers are becoming paranoid
about fouls, including technicals, called against them.</TE>
<TE>   "The officials don't like us," Ruben Patterson told Portland's
Oregonian. "We just have to go out there and play basketball, and if
they call a foul, they call a foul. If things don't go our way, there
isn't anything we can do about that. It's unbelievable right now.
It's crazy."</TE>
<TE>   Dangerous club: Comedy writer Jerry Perisho: "Sam Snead's
ceremonial first tee shot at the Masters Thursday flew into the
gallery and hit a man in the face, breaking his glasses. Snead
quickly pointed out that he was using Gerald Ford's autographed
driver."</TE>
<TE>   It'll get worse: Seattle Mariner veteran Edgar Martinez, after
getting thrown out trying to steal third base in a recent game: "The
bases seem to get further and further apart."</TE>
<TE>   Farther, Edgar, but we get the drift.</TE>
<TE>   Awesome task: Jerry Greene of the Orlando Sentinel on the Masters:
"Phil Mickelson against Augusta National is like Evel Knievel against
the Grand Canyon--except Mickelson has a chance."</TE>
<TE>   Chummy setting: Bill Lankhof in the Toronto Sun: "Montreal is the
only major league city where, instead of introducing the starting
lineup, they just ... introduce the entire crowd."</TE>
<TE>   At least he's honest: The New York Rangers are expected to pass on
Theo Fleury's $7-million option for next season, and none other than
Fleury thinks it is a wise business decision.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not worth $7 million; there's no way," the winger told the
New York Post. "But if there's a way for me to come back for less,
that's what I want to do, because I know that I owe this organization
for the last three years."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Gene Sarazen holing a four-wood shot for a double
eagle on the par-five, 485-yard 15th hole in 1935. He beat Craig Wood
in a playoff.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Darrell Waltrip, three-time Winston Cup champion who
retired in 2000 to become a television broadcaster, qualified 18th
Friday for the Advance Auto Parts 250 NASCAR truck series race in his
one-race return to driving.</TE>
<TE>   "It's either there or it isn't," he said. "If you never had it, it
ain't never there, and if you did, it'll come back, and it came back
pretty quickly."</TE>

<HD>Ishii Touches a Nerve in Latest Gem</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Left-hander again shows no sign of spring
frailty, blanking Padres for six innings in Dodgers' 3-0 win.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Kazuhisa Ishii suffered a serious case of the yips in spring
training, when the rookie left-hander from Japan was so erratic the
Dodgers nearly demoted him to the bullpen. But he has shown nerves of
steel in the regular season.</LD>
<LD>   That was evident in his distinguished Dodger debut last Saturday
and again Friday night, when Ishii blanked the San Diego Padres on
two hits in six innings to lead the Dodgers to a 3-0 victory before
31,894 in Qualcomm Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Any doubts about Ishii's confidence were erased in the first
inning, when he fell behind No. 3 hitter Phil Nevin with a 3-and-1
count. The situation called for a fastball, but Ishii dropped a slow
curve into the strike zone that Nevin, who hit .306 with 41 homers
and 126 runs batted in last season, could only watch.</LD>
<TE>   Nevin then grounded out to end the inning, setting the tone for an
evening in which Ishii extricated himself from trouble and baffled
the Padres with his pitch sequences.</TE>
<TE>   "The ability to put the breaking ball in the strike zone on
fastball counts was the reason he walked off without giving up a run
in six innings," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said of Ishii. "He did that
all night."</TE>
<TE>   Though Nevin looked fooled on that first-inning pitch, he said he
was actually looking for the curve. And it still froze him, making
the pitch all the more impressive.</TE>
<TE>   "The reports we got were that he'd throw that pitch at any time,
and he did," Nevin said. "I thought that [curve] was coming, but it
still looked like it was coming from first base. He threw a good
game. He pitched me with a different pattern every at-bat."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii (2-0) struck out five and walked three, allowing only Deivi
Cruz's second-inning double and Nevin's sixth-inning infield single.
He has allowed no runs and four hits in 112/3 innings this season,
striking out 15 and walking six.</TE>
<TE>   Quite a contrast to the pitcher who walked seven and gave up five
runs in 22/3 innings against Seattle in his final exhibition start on
March 31.</TE>
<TE>   "The difference [between the Seattle game and the regular season]
is the importance of the games," Ishii said through an interpreter.
"Because these are regular-season games, my concentration level has
gone up. And because a lot of American writers were writing that I
didn't have control, I wanted to show them I could throw with
control."</TE>
<TE>   The Padres, who lost despite tying a club record by turning five
double plays, threw a lineup of eight right-handed hitters at Ishii,
benching regulars Mark Kotsay and Ryan Klesko, but that hardly fazed
the Dodger pitcher, who was used to such tactics during his 10-year
career in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers, who have won six of seven, also got spotless relief
from Giovanni Carrara, who threw perfect seventh and eighth innings,
and newly crowned closer Eric Gagne, who retired the side in order in
the ninth for his fourth save in four opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy made one lineup switch, starting Alex Cora at shortstop in
place of Cesar Izturis because Cora had a .500 lifetime average
(seven for 14) with two home runs against Padre starter Kevin Jarvis,
and Izturis was due for a day off.</TE>
<TE>   The move paid dividends, as Cora was hit by a pitch and scored on
Paul Lo Duca's double in the third inning and tripled and scored on
Lo Duca's single in the fifth. Lo Duca, who celebrated his 30th
birthday Friday, added a single in the first, and Shawn Green had an
RBI groundout in the third.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii's only hint of trouble came in the sixth, but he was bailed
out in part by a Mark Grudzielanek play that might qualify as an ESPN
web gem, only it didn't involve the web of the second baseman's
glove.</TE>
<TE>   Trenidad Hubbard lofted a one-out popup toward the line in shallow
right that first baseman Eric Karros appeared to have a bead on, but
Karros yielded to Grudzielanek at the last second.</TE>
<TE>   Grudzielanek overran the play, reached back and made a bare-handed
catch of the ball, which umpire Paul Schrieber ruled would have been
fair had it dropped. The catch proved critical when Nevin followed
with an infield single and Bubba Trammell walked.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of having the bases loaded and one out, there were runners
on first and second with two out. Ishii recovered and retired Ron
Gant on a fly to right.</TE>

<LD>April 9, 2002. Dodgers shut out the Giants in San Francisco for their
first loss of the season; Barry Bonds grounds out in a crucial at-bat
to end the eighth inning. Vin Scully welcomes back his basketball
equivalent. And at Staples Center, the Lakers put the game "in the
refrigerator" with a 112-82 victory over the Jazz, thanks to the help
of Shaq, Kobe and, of course, Chick Hearn.</LD>
<LD>   Another perfect day. I love L.A.</LD>

<TE>   Before Tuesday's Laker game against the Jazz, I bought a six-pack
of soda, which I put in the refrigerator.</TE>
<TE>   I checked my stock quotes, which seemed to be going up and down
all day like a yo-yo on a string. It was cold that morning and I
noticed my clothesline was broken. Darn frozen rope.</TE>
<TE>   I fed the dog. He chowed the whole bowl down. He hadn't eaten like
that since Hector was a pup.</TE>
<TE>   About noon, I stopped by 7-Eleven and bought some lunch. A woman
listening to her Walkman didn't notice me and came hippity-hopping in
my direction, like she was doing the bunny hop in the pea patch, and
knocked the mustard off the hot dog.</TE>
<TE>   After the game, I called it a night and I always make sure the
doors are closed and the lights are out. That was a hectic day. As I
went to bed I noticed my Yahtzee was missing. I gotta play Yahtzee
before bed. Where did I put it? I went downstairs to look for it and,
silly me, the game was in the refrigerator! At least the Lakers won.</TE>
<TE>   Hector Reyes</TE>

<TE>   I'd like to thank Paul Sunderland for his class and excellent
play-by-play work accomplished under a tremendous media microscope
and in the shadow of a broadcasting legend. We Laker fans should not
be so myopic as to think Chickie Baby will be in the booth forever,
but it is reassuring to know that the future of Laker broadcasts is
in very good hands.</TE>
<TE>   Just as the Laker mantle was passed from Elgin and Jerry to Magic
and Kareem to Kobe and Shaq, so must we face this inevitability.
There will never be another Chick Hearn, but certainly Paul
Sunderland has replaced Manny Mota as the greatest pinch-hitter in
Los Angeles sports history.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Morris</TE>
<TE>   Inglewood</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In response to those who sing the praises of Paul Sunderland,
please. He is boring and a sycophant. He makes far more mistakes than
Chick does, and he has no personality, probably because he spends his
time fawning over others. To borrow from Gertrude Stein, "There is no
there there."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When I read the article in The Times about the four finalists for the
UCLA athletic director position, I was very disappointed that Gary
Cunningham's name was not listed.</LD>
<LD>   Not only do Gary's accomplishments show that he is the
best-qualified candidate, there is also a consensus within the
community concerning his qualifications. I have not talked to anyone
in college athletics (alumni, coaches and top UCLA supporters) who
does not think he is the best candidate.</LD>
<LD>   Highlights from Cunningham's resume: UCLA hall of famer, currently
athletic director at UC Santa Barbara, athletic director at Fresno
State for nine years, past president of the National Assn. of
Collegiate Directors of Athletics.</LD>
<TE>   A great university needs the most experienced, qualified and
respected person to be its athletic director. And wouldn't it be
great to have one of the most successful graduates of the John
Wooden-era teams become the UCLA athletic director?</TE>

kill you, Bill? Personally, I love the history, the course and the

<LD>I enjoyed reading those absurd gloom-and-doom letters about the
Dodgers last week. Surely, the Giants' lopsided sweep signified the
end of civilization as we know it. You'd have thought that half the
population of Southern California was about to jump on swords, while
the other half, the anti-Fox-Murdoch half, was about to celebrate by
dancing naked in the street with their collective hair on fire.</LD>
<LD>   Three measly games into a 162-game season and these letter writers
had already written off 2002 and were looking toward 2003. Amazing.</LD>

<TE>   Sports are meant as tests of will. Realistic goals are set and
attaining them provides proof of improvement. Individual skills
meshing with the right chemistry allow teams to outperform the
competition. The key is to avoid such unforeseen circumstances as
injuries to key players over the course of a season.</TE>
<TE>   The baseball season consists of 162 games. There's a common saying
we use to motivate kids: "Winners never quit and quitters never win."
To read the negative letters of April 6 sends the wrong message to
people with a real desire to work toward improving themselves. Last
year, the Diamondbacks were behind the Dodgers months into the season
and won the World Series. They had a healthy perspective as part of
the team's chemistry.</TE>
<TE>   Hearing losers' ignorant comments is part of everyday life. Why
add to it by allowing them a forum?</TE>

<TE>   Fans in Los Angeles are unbelievable. The faithless letters
published in last Saturday's Times about the Dodgers' early-season
woes were, no doubt, written by the same finicky bandwagon sports
"enthusiasts" (not fans) who call for Steve Lavin's firing every year
and can be seen leaving basketball games in the middle of the fourth
quarter, leaving baseball games in the seventh inning and who
complain when the local teams don't win a championship every year.
They are the same people who most likely could be found cheering this
past weekend in the series against the Rockies, screaming, "We did
it!"</TE>
<TE>   Please. Either have faith in your team or find yourself a new one,
but stop complaining when the Bruins don't go 32-0 or the Dodgers
fail to finish 162-0.</TE>

<LD>The Halos are back in more ways than one. As a lifelong Angel fan and
season-ticket holder, I anticipate the start of baseball season and
look forward to going to the ballpark to experience all the sights,
sounds and smells at Edison Field.</LD>
<LD>   But along with the familiar smell of hot dogs, popcorn and spilled
beer, I detect a distinct stench of gasoline coming from the new and
revised "Arson Squad." It is great that we finally got some quality
starters, but what good is it if the bullpen comes in and ignites
their opponents' bats? The uniforms have changed, but the quality of
product has not.</LD>

<KH>THE 66TH MASTERS</KH>
<HD>It's Singh in the Rain</HD>
<DH>Golf: He finishes a seven-under 65 and gets safely to
clubhouse with the lead before play is suspended. Woods, Palmer among
38 unable to complete second round.</DH>

<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>AUGUSTA, Ga.</DL>
<LD>The most important equipment in Vijay Singh's bag at the Masters
wasn't anything he could swing, putt, wear, peel or smear. It was the
nine towels his caddie crammed in there on a rainy Friday at soggy,
slippery Augusta National.</LD>
<LD>   Singh says he and the rain don't mix, but they were a fairly
dominant combination in the second round as his seven-under-par 65
moved him into a four-shot lead in the clubhouse when play was
suspended because of rain with the second round incomplete. The sky
was the color of well-done Porterhouse steak for most of the day, but
Singh managed to finish his round before play was halted at 4:55
p.m., when it began raining hard enough to flood most of the greens
on the back nine.</LD>
<LD>   Play was canceled about an hour later. Maybe it's something we
need to get used to because playing the weather game doesn't look
like such a great idea right now. Rain, possibly lots of it, is in
the forecast through next Thursday. Weather permitting, the second
round will be completed this morning, then the cut will be made and
the third round will start.</LD>
<TE>   Defending champion Tiger Woods and Arnold Palmer, playing his
final Masters round, were among 38 players who could not complete
their rounds.</TE>
<TE>   The cut was projected at three over.</TE>
<TE>   Singh played the last 11 holes in seven under, shot 30 on the
back, eagled the 15th and birdied the 17th and 18th coming in,
leaving him at nine-under 135, four shots ahead of Sergio Garcia,
Angel Cabrera and Padraig Harrington. Those three, all at five-under
139, were the closest to Singh among players who completed their
rounds. Retief Goosen was at six under through 11 holes when play was
halted.</TE>
<TE>   All of which probably explained Singh's sunny disposition
afterward.</TE>
<TE>   "I hit the ball really good, really solid all day, and putted
nicely," he said. "So that's why the score shows."</TE>
<TE>   Please don't call him a wet-weather player, said Singh, who won
the 2000 Masters in trying conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't wet, though, it was cold," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Harrington, who shot 70, had five birdies, three of them at some
of the more difficult holes, the first, ninth and 14th. He just
wishes he knew how he did it.</TE>
<TE>   "That's golf," he said finally. "I didn't particularly choose to
play those holes better than the other ones. I don't have any special
tactic for playing the difficult holes."</TE>
<TE>   Fair enough, because there are certainly plenty of them out there.</TE>
<TE>   For Tom Watson, it was the 12th, where he made a quadruple-bogey
seven, twice hitting eight-iron shots into Rae's Creek.</TE>
<TE>   Said Watson: "Have you seen the movie 'Alien' where the thing
comes out of your chest? Well, that's what it feels like on No. 12
when that happens."</TE>
<TE>   For Bernhard Langer, it was once again the 15th, which he double
bogeyed for the second day in a row.</TE>
<TE>   For Nick Price, it was just about every hole, especially the last
three, which he bogeyed in soggy conditions. He was very much like
everyone else who had early start times and had to play in the rain,
only more vocal.</TE>
<TE>   "We shouldn't have played, pure and simple," he said. "I had mud
on my ball on eight of 13 holes. It's kind of backfiring on
everybody. Look at the leaderboard."</TE>
<TE>   Only three players shot in the 60s: Singh, Rocco Mediate with a 68
and Thomas Bjorn, who birdied the first five holes and came out of
nowhere with a 67.</TE>
<TE>   That's about it for the bright side. Brad Faxon, who had a 75, was
about as happy as Price, which was not happy at all.</TE>
<TE>   "It was borderline laughable on the first three holes," he said.
"You couldn't take a drop. Everybody hit shots out of casual water
because there was no place to [drop]. It was a little sloppy."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Kite had a different description: "It was miserable."</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, misery had a great deal of company.</TE>
<TE>   Davis Love III, who led after the first round with a 67, missed
three birdie putts inside five feet early in his round Friday and
then collapsed, finishing with a 75.</TE>
<TE>   As for Woods, he played 10 holes in one under and was at three
under for the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   He started with six straight pars. He had one birdie, on the
par-four seventh, where he sank an eight-foot putt. Woods, playing
conservatively, didn't birdie either of the front-nine par fives,
even though he had good drives at No. 2 and No. 8. His three-wood
missed the green on both holes.</TE>
<TE>   He lipped out a long birdie attempt at the par-four ninth and made
the turn at one-under 35. He left a 12-foot birdie putt inches short
at the par-four 10th when play was suspended.</TE>
<TE>   By that time, Singh was still replaying his day in his mind. After
playing 36 holes, he has no doubt that the changes to Augusta
National have made it a haven for heavy hitters.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a long golf course now," he said. "Most of the holes that
have been lengthened are playing a lot longer than they seem. It's
all uphill. And you add five yards to an uphill hole, you play it
like 10 yards longer. It plays a lot longer for the shorter hitters."</TE>
<TE>   Garcia, hardly a short hitter, was all over the place on the back
with three bogeys and three birdies, but he finished with a birdie at
the 18th. His five-iron second shot from 185 yards stopped about 16
feet past the hole and he made the putt.</TE>
<TE>   "I struggled a little and I was able to keep it together," he
said. "So, it's a nice finish."</TE>
<TE>   Finishing is a feeling that nearly half of the 87 players in the
field did not experience. Gary Player, who was in the last group with
Charles Howell III and Jose Coceres, had played only nine holes when
play came to a muddy, rainy, watery conclusion.</TE>

<DL>AUGUSTA, Ga.</DL>
<LD>Watching Phil Mickelson play the Masters is like watching a lousy
gambler play blackjack.</LD>
<LD>   You want to look. You can't.</LD>
<LD>   You want to cheer. You want to cry.</LD>
<TE>   You start out fascinated. You end up furious.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson, the greatest active player never to win a major, the
Masters Disaster, climbed the leaderboard Friday in his typically
perverse manner:</TE>
<TE>   Step, splat, step, splat.</TE>
<TE>   He was brilliant. He was bone-headed.</TE>
<TE>   He hit monster drives. He chopped up baby putts.</TE>
<TE>   He shot two under par for the first eight holes, climbing into a
share of the lead.</TE>
<TE>   He shot two over par for the last 10 holes and finished a
rain-shortened second round six strokes behind leader Vijay Singh.</TE>
<TE>   It was a day when the beauty of Augusta National was offset by
ankle-high mud and a backstretch stench.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Mickelson was like that.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so-so," he said.</TE>
<TE>   So gifted. So gosh-darned frustrating.</TE>
<TE>   He once captured the imagination of the sports world by winning a
PGA Tour event as a junior in college, by winning five tournaments
before he'd turned 25, by dueling Payne Stewart to the final hole of
the 1999 U.S. Open.</TE>
<TE>   But time--and 13 top-10 finishes in major tournaments without a
victory--have eroded his image like an old poker chip's.</TE>
<TE>   His smile is tauter. His wave is weaker. His patience is thinner.</TE>
<TE>   His, and his fans' patience with a man who makes more than $6
million annually in purses and endorsements and has yet to make a
truly big putt.</TE>
<TE>   Those fans cheered him to his face Friday, but muttered about him
behind his back.</TE>
<TE>   "Classic Mickelson miss."</TE>
<TE>   "Typical Mickelson blunder."</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson smiled, as always, but inside, he seethed.</TE>
<TE>   "I try not to listen," he said of the people he once loved. "I
really don't notice them much."</TE>
<TE>   He has taken the same approach with reporters who once embraced
him, engaging in a bristling group interview on Tuesday, then
refusing to speak after Thursday's first round, even though he was
among the leaders.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first time in recent memory that anyone of his stature
had taken such a stand at this media-friendly place.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Mickelson worked on his putting, then left without
explanation, even though the interview room was still open.</TE>
<TE>   "I had 30 minutes of sunlight," he said Friday. "I know you have a
job to do, but so do I."</TE>
<TE>   That job is, apparently, to drive his supporters here crazy.</TE>
<TE>   Three times, he has begun the final round of the Masters within
two strokes of the leaders.</TE>
<TE>   But, with an aggressive style that suits this course as well as
cutoffs and black socks, not once has he gained any ground.</TE>
<TE>   The story was so similar Friday, fans were laughing in
exasperation.</TE>
<TE>   Remember his ill-advised flop shot to the 14th green in the final
round last year that led to a double bogey?</TE>
<TE>   He tried the exact shot again Friday, this time spinning the ball
30 feet past the hole, leading to a bogey.</TE>
<TE>   "Gee, usually he doesn't start messing up until Sunday afternoon,"
said a fan.</TE>
<TE>   "My round could have been a lot better," Mickelson acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   One hole earlier, aggressively going for a dangerous part of the
13th green, he hit his second shot into a gully behind the pin. Then
he flubbed his chip. Then he finally putted up and in to save par.</TE>
<TE>   "Why did he do that again?" asked a fan.</TE>
<TE>   "I would not have putted it the first time anyway," Mickelson
said.</TE>
<TE>   On the 17th hole, the cynicism reached its nadir when Mickelson
hit an approach shot to within 15 feet.</TE>
<TE>   "I bet he three-putts it," said one fan.</TE>
<TE>   "I bet he two-putts it," said another.</TE>
<TE>   The bet was on.</TE>
<TE>   Still another fan laughed and said he would bet on one putt, as
outrageous as that sounded to all of them.</TE>
<TE>   Said the first fan, "I know Mickelson is looking at Vijay [Singh]
on the scoreboard, and he'll go for it, like always, and run the putt
far past the hole."</TE>
<TE>   He was right. Mickelson ran the putt far past the hole.</TE>
<TE>   But Mickelson recovered and made the second putt, earning the
other fan a dollar.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I've ever felt comfortable on these greens,"
Mickelson said.</TE>
<TE>   Luckily, for the sake of good taste, the three men were not
present several minutes later at the 18th green, when Mickelson blew
a six-foot putt, completing his typical afternoon at a major.</TE>
<TE>   Four birdies. Four bogeys. Tied for fifth among the players who
had completed their rounds.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone wondering how someone so good could be so wasteful at
such big moments.</TE>
<TE>   "This has not hurt my chances," Mickelson said.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe not. But only five players in the last 20 years have emerged
from deeper than fourth place after two rounds to win this
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson has the ability to beat those odds.</TE>
<TE>   If only we all still had the strength to watch him try.</TE>

<DH>Tracy Doesn't Care How CART Markets Him, Even if Friends
Say That Along With His Flamboyant Image He Has Softer Side</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paul Tracy saw a bit of open road between Kingman, Ariz., and Hoover
Dam. With the valley laid out below him, he wondered how fast his new
Porsche 911 Turbo could go. Since there were no other cars to be seen
...</LD>
<LD>   A Porsche 911 Turbo will do 190 mph on the highway.</LD>
<LD>   That's about 5 mph faster than Tracy will be traveling at the end
of Shoreline Drive during today's second day of qualifying for the
28th Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach as CART sets its starting grid
for Sunday's race. Tracy, a two-time winner at Long Beach, was ninth
at 101.465 mph in his Team Green Reynard-Honda after Friday's first
round of qualifying.</LD>
<TE>   With Robby Gordon having migrated to NASCAR's Winston Cup series,
Tracy is the undisputed bad boy of open-wheel auto racing. Jimmy
Vasser, who runs around Las Vegas with fellow resident Tracy, says
his buddy is "flamboyant," with a well-earned reputation but has a
soft side that the public rarely sees.</TE>
<TE>   Whether he's dying his hair red or green, punting another car out
of the way, referring to the series' chief steward as a clown,
arguing with car owner Barry Green or calling out the series itself
for perceived preferential treatment received by former CART team
owner Roger Penske, Tracy seems to be a racer who doesn't hold back.</TE>
<TE>   "For sure, I'm aggressive on the track and I'll do what it takes
to get the job done," he said. "I'm not afraid to use the nose of the
car, or the wings, to get somebody bumped, and I've been expressive
out of the car when things haven't gone the way I wanted it to go.
That's just my personality."</TE>
<TE>   But does Tracy buy into his reputation? Not really.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody who knows me knows that I'm a fairly normal guy," Tracy
said. "It's something CART has played up as a marketing thing. I just
roll with it. Racing is racing, but it's still entertainment as well.
Like anything, there are good guys and bad guys."</TE>
<TE>   In Tracy's world, worse than being bad is being bland, which is
one reason he doesn't mind being Darth Vader, as long as nobody
confuses him with Charles Grodin. And that's not likely.</TE>
<TE>   He has had well-documented on-track run-ins with his teammate,
Dario Franchitti--once while they were running first and second--and
was suspended for the first race of 1999 for several incidents the
previous year. Al Unser Jr., Michel Jourdain Jr., Christian
Fittipaldi, Michael Andretti ... there's no shortage of drivers who
have cussed Tracy under their breath.</TE>
<TE>   In this year's season opener in Monterrey, Mexico, Tracy got under
Alex Tagliani's skin by cutting the fellow Canadian's tire during a
charge from the last row. Tracy had a chance to win, then settled for
ninth because of a late-race fuel problem.</TE>
<TE>   "I went to Phoenix for an eye check and I asked the doctor his
background," said Max Papis, who was once in second place in
Australia when Tracy punted him off-course. "He said he did eye
surgery to Al Unser Jr., Emerson Fittipaldi and Paul Tracy. I said,
'Who? Paul Tracy.' I said, 'Please, do not put [Paul Tracy] in your
resume--everyone thinks he is driving blindfolded."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy was fined $50,000, penalized three championship points and
put on probation for the final two races last season, after he'd
called former chief steward Chris Kneifel a clown and complained of
perceived leniency toward Penske's drivers, series champion Gil de
Ferran and Helio Castroneves, after a pit incident at Laguna Seca in
which Castroneves knocked Tracy out of the race.</TE>
<TE>   Forgettable? Boring? No way.</TE>
<TE>   "If I was that much of a bad guy, I wouldn't be in the series for
11 years. I'd be gone," said Tracy, who as recently as 1997 drove for
Penske. "I must be doing something right."</TE>
<TE>   Vasser says Tracy, 33, the divorced father of an 8-year-old
daughter and 7-year-old son, is not a simple person.</TE>
<TE>   "He's pretty complex," Vasser said. "He's Jekyll and Hyde. The way
he drives on the track and the way the public sees him ... he'd give
the shirt off his back to his friends or anyone he cares about, but
he won't give you an inch on the track.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a bit flamboyant. He certainly doesn't like to fly under the
radar. He's not understated."</TE>
<TE>   Chris Pook, CART's new president, doesn't mind.</TE>
<TE>   "Every sport has its characters, and he's one of our characters
and he's very important to us," said Pook, who has been on the job
since December.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that he's an incredible racing car driver is an added
bonus."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, he is that. Tracy notched his first champ car victory
at Long Beach in 1993, the first of five that season driving for
Penske. He has won 18 races and finished second 12 times in 173
starts.</TE>
<TE>   He won a second time at Long Beach in 2000, followed by victories
at Road America and Vancouver, but he hasn't won since.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Tracy had two thirds and a fourth--at Long Beach-- to
open the season, then finished higher than sixth only once over the
next 17 races.</TE>
<TE>   He says Team Green was stretched thin when it added a third car,
driven by Andretti, and early-season decisions in the setup and
aerodynamics took the Reynard-Honda combination down the wrong road.</TE>
<TE>   "I made mistakes, the team made mistakes," Tracy said. "What it
comes down to is getting the right equipment under you and making the
most out of it. To be frank, as a team we didn't do a very good job."</TE>
<TE>   If you want frank, Tracy's your man:</TE>
<TE>   "I always say how I feel, whether I'm right or wrong."</TE>
<TE>   The Indy Racing League?</TE>
<TE>   "They've had good finishes. They've done a really good job of
keeping the camera angles out of the stands. There's nobody there."</TE>
<TE>   A CART-IRL unification?</TE>
<TE>   "Sooner or later, one's going to have to fold or compromise. I
don't think either is going anywhere. CART has compromised a lot by
changing our rules, changing our engine formula, not racing in the
month of May [in deference to the Indy 500], but there's been no
compromise back from [IRL President] Tony George, which is
frustrating. CART has made steps [toward a unification] and there's
never any response back. How many times are you going to ask a girl
out and have her turn you down before you say forget it?"</TE>
<TE>   Having only 20 cars in the field?</TE>
<TE>   "We have 20 good, quality cars. Formula One has 20 cars, and they
have four good cars and the rest are crap, and no one says F1 is
dying."</TE>
<TE>   And what of that Internet rumor about him and porn star Jenna
Jameson?</TE>
<TE>   "I met her a couple of times, but there's no connection. I don't
know how people started talking about that. Maybe you can hook me
up."</TE>
<TE>   Green tried to hook up his team this season by making changes in
the engineering department, and Tracy and Franchitti redirected their
approach. Tracy is about 25 pounds lighter, down to 175 pounds on his
5-foot-9 frame. He spent more off-season time with his race engineer,
Steve Challis. He says the team as a whole is more focused and that
he is paying more attention to details.</TE>
<TE>   If those details lead to Tracy's first championship, it wouldn't
surprise Adrian Fernandez, the series' only owner-driver.</TE>
<TE>   "Paul is good for racing, good for CART," Fernandez said. "He's
more mature. He still makes great passes, but he doesn't make as many
stupid mistakes, like in the past. He has a lot of experience, he's
always been fast, he's a tough driver, definitely.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing that I wouldn't hire him for."</TE>

<HD>Acquiring Oliver Is Paying Off for Boston</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Boston Red Sox were so desperate to dump Carl Everett last winter
that they took on underachieving Darren Oliver.</LD>
<LD>   New York is wishing they hadn't.</LD>
<LD>   Oliver pitched 52/3 shutout innings Friday night, leading the Red
Sox to a 3-2 victory over the Yankees at Fenway Park and improving to
6-1 in his career against New York.</LD>
<TE>   "I really have no explanation for that," Oliver said. "I was just
trying to keep the ball down. I don't know how they approach me when
I'm out there."</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees lost their third consecutive game despite four hits by
Jason Giambi.</TE>
<TE>   Nick Johnson homered to lead off the ninth and pull New York
within a run, but Ugueth Urbina finished the inning for his fourth
save.</TE>
<TE>   Oliver (1-0) had an 11-11 record with a 6.02 earned-run average
last year and was scheduled to make $7 million this season, so when
Boston needed to unload Everett, the Rangers were willing to deal.</TE>
<TE>   Oliver picked up his first victory since Aug. 28, giving up five
hits and three walks and striking out four.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando Hernandez (1-1) showed no ill effects of a stiff neck that
pushed him back one day in the rotation.</TE>
<TE>   He gave up two runs, nine hits and two walks, and struck out five
in seven innings.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 3, Kansas City 1--The host Indians won their ninth in a
row and matched their best start as C.C. Sabathia again defeated the
Royals.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Thome and Omar Vizquel each homered for the second consecutive
game and the Indians improved to 10-1, tying the fastest start in the
club's 102-year history. Cleveland started 10-1 in 1959 and 1966.</TE>
<TE>   Sabathia (2-0), who earned four of his 17 victories as a rookie
last season in five starts against Kansas City, struck out nine in
six innings. He gave up five singles and walked four.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 5, Baltimore 2--Left-hander Mark Buehrle gave up two hits
in seven innings to win his third consecutive start and Jose
Valentin, Sandy Alomar Jr. and Ray Durham each homered to lead the
White Sox in front of 41,128 at Comiskey Park.</TE>
<TE>   Buehrle (3-0) gave up a solo homer in the seventh inning to Marty
Cordova, activated from the disabled list earlier in the day, and a
single to David Segui.</TE>
<TE>   Valentin's two-run homer against Josh Towers (0-2) in the fourth
inning put the White Sox ahead. Alomar led off the fifth with a homer
and three batters later, Durham hit a two-run blast.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 7, Texas 3--Ruben Sierra, the four-time all-star who
resurrected his career in Texas, hit a grand slam in his first at-bat
against his former team.</TE>
<TE>   Sierra's fifth career grand slam, his first homer for Seattle,
gave the Mariners a 5-0 lead in the first inning at Arlington, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel good that I did that and I helped my team to win," Sierra
said.</TE>
<TE>   Jamie Moyer (1-1), pulled after a leadoff walk in the sixth, gave
up two runs on four hits. He struck out four and walked four.</TE>
<TE>   Sierra, 36, batted .291 with 23 homers for Texas last season, but
he was not offered a contract after the season.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 14, Tampa Bay 7--Carlos Delgado's three-run homer at St.
Petersburg, Fla., capped a seven-run third inning for the Blue Jays.</TE>
<TE>   Felipe Lopez and Raul Mondesi drove in three runs apiece for the
Blue Jays, who scored four times in the seventh after the Devil Rays
pulled within 8-7.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Grieve hit two solo homers for Tampa Bay, giving him three
home runs in his last two games and four this season.</TE>

<HD>Twins Win a Festive Home Opener</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>The Twins returned to the Metrodome to play again and Brad Radke
helped them send Detroit to yet another loss.</LD>
<LD>   Before the Twins' first home-opening sellout in a decade, Radke
pitched into the seventh inning and sent the winless Tigers to their
ninth consecutive defeat, 4-2, Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Detroit is off to its worst start since going 0-13 in 1920 and the
worst start in the majors since the Chicago Cubs' 0-14 in 1997,
according to the Elias Sports Bureau. The Tigers' skid is their
longest at any point since losing nine in a row in 1999.</LD>
<TE>   Minnesota used a four-run second inning to end a four-game losing
streak--all against Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Fans in the crowd of 48,244, happy to see in person that the Twins
survived baseball's contraction plan, gave players a rousing ovation
before the game.</TE>
<TE>   Radke (2-0), who has rebounded from a rocky outing on opening day
in Kansas City with two consecutive quality starts, gave up two runs
and eight hits in 62/3 innings. Eddie Guardado struck out the side in
the ninth to remain perfect in five save chances.</TE>
<TE>   Torii Hunter struck out leading off the second inning before seven
consecutive Twins reached base--leading to four runs. A.J. Pierzynski
and Jay Canizaro drove in runs with singles, and Jacque Jones walked
to load the bases.</TE>
<TE>   Cristian Guzman and Doug Mientkiewicz followed with run-scoring
singles to make it 4-0, and Hunter ended the inning with a fielder's
choice grounder to second.</TE>
<TE>   Fans lined up early at the Metrodome and for many the off-season
threat by baseball owners to fold the franchise made this opening
night all the more special. It doesn't hurt that the Twins are seen
as a contender to win the American League Central.</TE>
<TE>   The Twins, who opened the season with a 5-5 road trip, were the
last team to play a home opener in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Fans began congregating outside the ballpark as early as 5 a.m.
CDT, and free hot dogs, muffins and newspapers were available to the
early risers. Current and former Twins also greeted fans at two noon
rallies in the Twin Cities.</TE>
<TE>   As the afternoon wore on, the scene shifted to a party-like
atmosphere outside the Metrodome, complete with beer, games for kids,
live music and sunny, 60-degree weather.</TE>

<HD>Anderson Hasn't Hit the Panic Button Yet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Angel outfielder Garret Anderson entered Friday night's game against
the Oakland Athletics with a .333 career average against the A's, his
highest average against any opponent.</LD>
<LD>   He also was hitless in four consecutive games for the first time
since a career-long eight-game hitless streak that occurred June
8-17, 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Anderson went 0 for 4 Friday in the Angels' 5-1 loss at Edison
Field. He is hitless in 18 at-bats during this homestand.</LD>
<TE>   Anderson struck out in the first inning with runners at first and
second, grounded out to second in the fourth, grounded out to first
with the bases loaded in the fifth and flied out to right in the
eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson, who batted .289 with 28 home runs and 123 runs batted in
last season, said he is not struggling with his swing.</TE>
<TE>   "We play enough games that things are going to happen--some good
things and some bad things," Anderson said before the game. "There
are not many things mechanically that I need to think about. I keep
it pretty simple."</TE>
<TE>   Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said he was not concerned about
Anderson, who hit several balls hard in the Angels' four losses
against the Seattle Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a good approach when he is 0 for 20 or 10 for 20,"
Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   "[The Mariners] didn't have a lot of holes out there the way they
were playing defense."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels were batting .220 going into the game, which ranked
12th in the league, ahead of only Tampa Bay (.217) and Baltimore
(.214). Scioscia said he was not going to make any major changes.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now the call is for patience, not any rash moves," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Angel closer Troy Percival, on the 15-day disabled list since
April 3 because of a strained muscle in his rib cage, felt no
discomfort after throwing off a mound for seven minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Percival is scheduled to throw in the bullpen again Sunday. He is
eligible to come off the disabled list Thursday, but Scioscia said
there is no set timetable as he works his way back.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a couple of options--he could pitch in a simulated game
or make a rehab start," Scioscia said. "We'll see how it comes out
Sunday. We don't want to get too far ahead."</TE>
<TE>   First baseman Shawn Wooten and outfield prospect Nathan Haynes,
each of whom had thumb surgery during spring training, had pins
removed Friday. They will begin gradual rehabilitation but are not
expected to begin swinging a bat for three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Wooten suffered ligament damage in his right thumb while
attempting to break a fall after catching a pop fly in an exhibition
game against the San Diego Padres on March 13. He underwent surgery
on March 20.</TE>
<TE>   Haynes, who was scheduled to play center field for triple-A Salt
Lake, suffered ligament damage in his left thumb on March 6 while
running the bases.</TE>

<HD>Alou Accepts Tigers' Offer to Be a Coach</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Montreal Expo manager Felipe Alou has accepted an offer to
become the Detroit Tigers' bench coach for the remainder of the
season.</LD>
<LD>   Alou, 66, joined the Tigers for the Minnesota Twins' home opener
Friday night at Minneapolis.</LD>
<LD>   "It's nice to be home," Alou said in the visitors' clubhouse at
the Metrodome. "Once I got to the ballpark, I realize this is home
for me."</LD>
<TE>   Luis Pujols, hired Monday to succeed the fired Phil Garner as
manager, was on Alou's staff at Montreal from 1993-2000. Tiger
President Dave Dombrowski was an Expo executive during part of Alou's
time with Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm thrilled that he accepted," Dombrowski said. "It's tremendous
for the organization to have somebody with Felipe's knowledge,
background and experience. I don't think you could describe a better
fit right now."</TE>
<TE>   Pujols was just as excited.</TE>
<TE>   "You can see the smile on my face," he said before the game. "He's
willing to help any way he can. I need help, I go to him. I had that
gut feeling as soon as I offered it to him, that he's going to pick
me up. I'm glad he decided to join us."</TE>
<TE>   Alou, the first major league manager born in the Dominican
Republic, declined an offer to stay for two additional years as a
special assistant in the Tiger organization.</TE>
<TE>   Dombrowski said he sought Alou because of his close relationship
with Pujols, and did not consider Alou as a managerial candidate when
he fired Garner.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it is a short-term type project," said Dombrowski,
whose mission is to turn around a franchise that hasn't had a winning
record since 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Edgar Martinez, who ruptured his left hamstring running out a
grounder, was put on the 15-day disabled list by the Seattle
Mariners. Surgery is planned for today.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez, who as walking awkwardly in the clubhouse before the
opener of a four-game series at Texas, was limited to 42 games in
1993 after he injured his left hamstring in a spring training game.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels a little better than in '93, when I could hardly walk at
home," Martinez said. "I have movement with some pain."</TE>
<TE>   Seattle Manager Lou Piniella said he knows his designated hitter
will be out longer than 15 days. He just doesn't know how long.</TE>
<TE>   "It hurts anybody to lose your fourth hitter, and one of the best
hitters in baseball," Piniella said.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Torborg was permitted to manage the Florida Marlins against
Atlanta on Friday pending a review of his two-game suspension by the
commissioner's office.</TE>
<TE>   The suspension for excessive arguing was announced Thursday and
scheduled to begin Friday. But Torborg made an informal appeal to Bob
Watson, baseball's vice president of on-field operations.</TE>
<TE>   Torborg threw his hat, bumped crew chief Tim McClelland and was
ejected after umpires reversed the ruling on a three-run home run by
Florida's Mike Lowell against the Expos on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Call it the $52,500 catch.</TE>
<TE>   That's how much--minus commissions--Charles Murphy will receive
for the ball Barry Bonds hit to tie Mark McGwire's home run record.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, Murphy rejected a "ridiculous" $100,000 offer for No.
70, which he caught in Houston. Instead, he put the ball on the
auction block.</TE>
<TE>   A three-week online auction that ended Friday generated only two
bids for the ball.</TE>

<HD>De La Hoya-Vargas Bout Is Set for Sept. 14</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First it was pride. Then it was money. Then it was an injury.</LD>
<LD>   The long-awaited, but never-realized match between Oscar De La
Hoya and Fernando Vargas, labeled "Bad Blood" by promoters, ought to
be called Bad Karma.</LD>
<LD>   Hopeful now that every possible cause for delay has finally been
eliminated, promoters Bob Arum and Gary Shaw have agreed on a new
date--Sept. 14--for the 154-pound title match between De La Hoya and
Vargas at Las Vegas' Mandalay Bay Events Center.</LD>
<TE>   For years, Vargas, who grew up in Oxnard, challenged De La Hoya of
East Los Angeles only to be rejected, De La Hoya claiming he didn't
want to give his hated rival a big payday.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides appeared to have struck a deal last summer, only to
have negotiations collapse at the end over money. With Arum back in
De La Hoya's camp, an agreement was finally reached on a May 4 date.
But last week, De La Hoya revealed he sprained his left wrist in
training camp, necessitating yet another postponement.</TE>
<TE>   With genuine animosity between the fighters, which culminated in a
shoving match at a Los Angeles news conference, the fight has
built-in appeal.</TE>
<TE>   And neither Arum nor Shaw expects the delay to cool that passion.</TE>
<TE>   "Vargas doesn't shut up," Arum said. "And that's good. He keeps
the pot boiling."</TE>
<TE>   Said Shaw, "Nothing needs to be restarted. The passion will be
sustained. What you have between these two guys is a permanent scar.
A scar remains a scar."</TE>
<TE>   Arum gets passionate when asked about those--Vargas included--who
question whether De La Hoya's injury is genuine.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not crazy," Arum said. "If he could have fought, he would
have fought. Oscar was in great shape. We have a new date, but would
I have rather fought May 4? You're damn right I would, but what can I
do?"</TE>
<TE>   Those who purchased tickets for the May 4 date can either use them
for the same seats on Sept. 14 or can get a full refund.</TE>

<HD>Fine Solution for Olowokandi</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Center apologizes for comments made last
week and has $50,000 penalty rescinded.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Clippers on Friday rescinded center Michael Olowokandi's $50,000
fine for speaking out last week about his lack of a contract for next
season and the effect he believed it was having on the team's play.
Olowokandi and General Manager Elgin Baylor spoke for about an hour
after the morning shoot-around at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   Olowokandi said he apologized to Baylor for making the comments
after the Clippers' loss April 3 against the Utah Jazz, which
effectively knocked the team from playoff contention. He said he was
simply venting his frustration after a game in which he missed 13 of
15 shots and scored only seven points.</LD>
<LD>   Baylor refused to comment, but a team spokesman said, "The fine
has been rescinded based on what Elgin heard from Michael this
morning."</LD>
<TE>   Olowokandi told reporters before the Clippers' game against the
Sacramento Kings that he learned a few things about the way teams can
deal with their free agents. Olowokandi is eligible to become a
restricted free agent this summer, with the Clippers holding the
right to match any outside offers.</TE>
<TE>   "[Baylor] reiterated his commitment to me," Olowokandi said. "We
talked and he asked me my plans. I told him I have never expressed
any desire to be anywhere else. I guess he wanted to hear it from me
for the record."</TE>
<TE>   What he said after the Utah game was, in part:</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't play well together. Whenever you have a group of guys
that are very uncertain of their futures on the team that will always
happen. Whenever you have that situation, you will never have a
basketball team. Not this year, not next year, not 10 years from now.
We had a situation tonight where everyone was just going on their
own. It wasn't good.</TE>
<TE>   "Things are very uncertain with the future of this team. It's
starting to affect the way we play the game."</TE>
<TE>   What Olowokandi said Friday was, in part:</TE>
<TE>   "To blame it on a player not knowing where he'll be or if a team
hasn't kept its players in the past isn't right. When you're an
athlete you definitely should always compete for pride.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't mean to create this big stir-up. I can go on record as
apologizing for not being knowledgeable. I should have dealt with the
situation better. I should have approached it differently."</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi also said he should have sought out Baylor sooner. The
two often talk, according to Olowokandi, but Friday's conversation
was the first time they spoke in detail about the 7-footer's future.</TE>
<TE>   Teams are not allowed to negotiate with free agents until July 1,
with the signing period opening July 16. Olowokandi said he simply
did not know the rules until Baylor explained them to him Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "[Baylor] told me there are only two players on our team, Sean
Rooks and Eric Piatkowski, who have played 10 years or more in the
league and whose contracts he could talk about," Olowokandi said. "My
expiration date ended in October. For some reason, I always felt
[there could be on-going negotiations]."</TE>
<TE>   When Olowokandi would ask his agent, Bill Duffy, if he had heard
anything about a new contract, Duffy would say he had not. Olowokandi
said he took that to mean that, "I would be out of here" at the end
of the season.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Baylor and Duffy can't negotiate a new deal for
Olowokandi until July 1.</TE>
<TE>   This could be Olowokandi's first experience as a free agent. He
was selected No. 1 overall in the 1998 NBA draft despite having
played for only parts of three seasons at the University of the
Pacific. He took up the game as a 17-year-old living in England.</TE>

<LD>The Sacramento Kings clinched their first division title since the
franchise was based in Kansas City, Mo., in 1978-79. They also
secured home-court advantage throughout the playoffs with a 125-106
victory Friday over the Clippers before a sellout crowd of 19,818 at
Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   What's more, they prevented the Clippers from recording their
second winning season since relocating from San Diego before the
1984-85 season. With three games remaining, the best the Clippers
(38-41) can do is finish .500 for only the third time in their L.A.
history.</LD>
<LD>   Six Kings scored 10 or more points, including three with 20 or
more, led by Chris Webber's 28. Sacramento, which won its 11th
consecutive game, shot 60.9%, including 46.2% (six for 13) from
behind the three-point arc.</LD>
<TE>   "They're a great team," Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry said. "They're
going to have a legitimate chance to win the NBA championship.</TE>
<TE>   "When you shoot 54% [as the Clippers did] on your home court,
you'd think you'd have a good chance to win."</TE>
<TE>   Of Webber, Gentry added, "Right now, he's the best player at his
position [power forward] that there is in the NBA. He's so versatile,
and they put shooters around him, so it's difficult to put any one
guy on him.</TE>
<TE>   "In our last two games against them, he's made 16 of 21 and 12 of
19 against us, mainly on jump shots."</TE>
<TE>   Elton Brand led the Clippers with 24 points and Michael Olowokandi
added 21.</TE>

<HD>Gagne Now a Committee of One</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>In an announcement that had all the suspense of an intentional walk,
Manager Jim Tracy confirmed what most Dodgers suspected for weeks:
Eric Gagne is the team's closer. The closer by committee is
adjourned.</LD>
<LD>   "I talked to him [Friday] and told him the ninth-inning job is his
to lose," Tracy said. "I was still going through different scenarios
in my mind, but [Thursday's game against San Francisco] definitely
answered my questions."</LD>
<LD>   Gagne, who was converted from starter to reliever in spring
training, escaped a first-and-third, one-out jam by striking out
cleanup batter Jeff Kent and retiring Reggie Sanders on a fly ball to
save the Dodgers' 4-3 win over the Giants.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't know what scenario you could create from a pressure
standpoint that could match [that]," Tracy said. "He handled it with
grit, a lot of moxie and character. It was like he wanted to be out
there in that situation."</TE>
<TE>   Against the Padres Friday, Gagne pitched a perfect ninth to record
his fourth save. He hasn't allowed a run this season, striking out
nine in 7 2/3 innings. But the true test, he and Tracy admit, will
come when he blows a save.</TE>
<TE>   "From what I've seen, I'm confident he'll bounce back if that
happens," Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Gagne: "If I mess one up, I have to come back and do it
again. I'm going to be able to do it because I'm mentally strong."</TE>
<TE>   Trenidad Hubbard, the former Dodger utility player who started in
center field for the Padres Friday night, holds the roster spot that
would have belonged to Mike Darr, the outfielder who was killed in a
one-car accident a few miles from the club's Peoria, Ariz.,
spring-training base on Feb. 15.</TE>
<TE>   Hubbard, a journeyman who is in his 17th professional season and
has played for 12 different minor league teams, signed with San Diego
soon after Darr's death and won a roster spot by hitting .415 with
three homers and 15 RBIs this spring.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very awkward situation, coming into a place where the
team really loved this guy," Hubbard said. "Mike Darr will always be
a part of this team. He did so well, and he had great alliances with
his teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "It was kind of intimidating. ... But the transition has been
easier because of the open arms I felt when I arrived."</TE>

<HD>This Loss Will Stick With Ducks</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Giguere shows frustration after disputed call
awards Colorado a penalty shot that leads to go-ahead goal in 3-1
victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For one of the few times this season, the Mighty Ducks could be
frustrated at the way they lost rather than at the mere fact that
they lost.</LD>
<LD>   Jean-Sebastien Giguere was working on another solid game Friday,
accelerating his rise toward the top echelon of NHL goalies. After a
flurry of activity that took mere seconds, he was hacking at the goal
post, then flinging his stick up the ice.</LD>
<LD>   That's all it took to put the Colorado Avalanche on the road to a
3-1 victory in front of an announced 17,174 at the Arrowhead Pond
Friday--technically a sellout, but no full house as evidenced by the
large number of empty seats.</LD>
<TE>   Giguere controlled his crease, but not the actions around it. Duck
defenseman Vitaly Vishnevski covered the puck in the crease and the
Avalanche was given a second-period penalty shot.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Drury scored to snap a 1-1 tie. Giguere tossed his stick in
anger.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't happy about the call, and I wasn't happy about letting
the goal in," Giguere said. "Put two and two together and I just
snapped."</TE>
<TE>   Things weren't as simple as that. Rob Blake and Joe Sakic scored
goals. The Avalanche defense was up to playoff speed, exemplified by
Darius Kasparaitis, who had hard checks on a couple of Duck players.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks are preparing for other things. Golf tee times are
around the corner. Vacations are approaching. A little rest and
rehabilitation begin Monday for the Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   Still, they go gently into a not-so-sweet off-season knowing that
at least their goalie situation is in sure hands.</TE>
<TE>   Giguere was solid Friday, stopping 29 of 32 shots. Blake scored 15
minutes into the first period, on a three-on-one. That goal, Giguere
could live with. The tiebreaker was unacceptable.</TE>
<TE>   The Avalanche created chaos in front of the Duck net. Drury,
parked by the net, flipped a shot that Giguere stopped. The puck lay
in the crease and Vishnevski seemed to cover it. Officials awarded a
penalty shot.</TE>
<TE>   Drury then neatly tucked a back-hander behind Giguere, who then
slammed his stick against the goal post and tossed it out to center
ice, resulting in a 10-minute misconduct penalty.</TE>
<TE>   But it also showed competitiveness his teammates appreciate.</TE>
<TE>   "Vish never actually had the puck," Giguere said. "The puck was
lying there available to everyone. I went in and grabbed it because I
knew it was going to be a controversial call."</TE>
<TE>   Giguere has emerged as one of the NHL's top goalies and earned a
spot on Team Canada for the world championships later this month. He
ranks among the league leaders in every category ... except
victories.</TE>
<TE>   "He plays like Patrick Roy," Coach Bryan Murray said. "He has a
big body and gets himself in a good position on the shooter.</TE>
<TE>   "He has made progress. He is more careful back there, especially
handling the puck. That's maturity. He is going to be a big-time
goaltender in this league."</TE>
<TE>   Giguere is a big reason the Ducks will allow fewer than 200 goals
for the first time in a non-lockout season, barring a rout Sunday
against the Kings. His record is only 20-24-6 because only Columbus
has scored fewer goals than the Ducks this season.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Friesen got their lone goal Friday, tying the score, 1-1,
eight minutes into the second period. He took a pass from Steve
Rucchin and zipped a shot into the upper left corner of the net.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I shot it into the crowd," Friesen said.</TE>
<TE>   That has happened too often to too many Ducks this season.</TE>
<TE>   "If our offense gets two goals, that's a big night for us," Murray
said.</TE>

<HD>Galaxy Takes It in Stride</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Depth allows team to stay loose despite injury that
is expected to sideline Albright six to eight weeks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's easy to see why the Galaxy is one of three undefeated teams in
Major League Soccer this season.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, it has been only two games and both went to overtime
before being won, but the depth of talent at Coach Sigi Schmid's
disposal means his players are relaxed and confident.</LD>
<LD>   Certainly, they were a loose bunch during shooting drills Friday
while training for tonight's game against the Dallas Burn at the Rose
Bowl.</LD>
<TE>   They could have been bemoaning the loss of starting forward Chris
Albright, who underwent surgery Friday morning after suffering a
broken bone in his right foot.</TE>
<TE>   Albright will be sidelined for six to eight weeks, but defender
Alexi Lalas wasn't about to send him a get-well card. Lalas suffered
an identical injury to his left foot just before the 1992 Olympic
Games in Barcelona. He strapped up the foot, donned a bigger boot and
played three matches.</TE>
<TE>   Lalas, very much tongue-in-cheek, said today's players wouldn't
dream of doing that.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't know what pain is," he said, laughing. "They don't
know what playing with broken bones is and all that kind of stuff.
It's all about money for these guys. It's not about the love and the
passion for the game that most of us had years ago."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't a bad tackle that caused Albright's injury. It was wear
and tear that caused the fifth metatarsal (a bone on the outside of
his foot) to break.</TE>
<TE>   "He did his the same way I did, where there wasn't anybody [else]
involved," Lalas said. "You just turn, put all your weight on one
side and eventually the bone that's weak just can't handle it. It
also has to do with the amount of soccer that you play and the types
of shoes that we wear.</TE>
<TE>   "When I did it back in '92, I lined up with the X-ray where the
break was. It was right underneath the stud. I was wearing studs for
a long time and your foot can only take so much.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a credit card. When you break a credit card, you bend
it and it gets weaker and weaker and weaker and eventually it just
snaps."</TE>
<TE>   Lalas, 31, said having surgery now was the correct choice for
Albright and had some encouraging words for the 23-year-old. "You're
not going to be out that long and the benefits are great because you
come back much stronger," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lalas waited until after the '92 Olympics for his surgery, and it
had no adverse effect on his U.S. national team and professional
careers. "They put a screw in and grafted some bone in from my ankle
and, to be honest, it's stronger than my right one," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, Albright's place in the lineup will be taken by Brian
Mullan, who will team with MLS leading scorer Carlos Ruiz up front in
a two-man Galaxy attack.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll slot Mullan in," Schmid said Friday. "It's good that we
have Cobi [Jones] available for the next three games. By the time
Cobi leaves for the World Cup, [midfielder] Peter Vagenas will be at
a stage where he comes back [from a back strain that has kept him out
of the lineup], so that gives us the ability to move Sasha
[Victorine] into a more offensive role.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly, it'll increase the playing time for Mullan and for
Gavin Clinton, and maybe we'll even give some minutes to Alejandro
Moreno."</TE>
<TE>   Albright, who started for the U.S. at the 2000 Sydney Olympics,
probably will not be available until June.</TE>
<TE>   "It'll be somewhere between four and five weeks before he can
start running, and then it all depends on how long it takes him from
there," Schmid said.</TE>
<TE>   "Chris Henderson [now with the Colorado Rapids] had his [foot
injury] halfway through our [1990] championship year at UCLA and we
just nursed him through the rest of the year. Lalas nursed his
through the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "With Chris [Albright], we felt it was better just to get it done
now."</TE>

<HD>Clearing in the Derby Forecast</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Outcomes in key races today could establish
more definitive favorites for the first leg of Triple Crown.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LEXINGTON, Ky.</DL>
<LD>In a 90-minute span today, at tracks in Kentucky, New York and
Arkansas, 25 horses will run in three races worth an aggregate $2
million, and just maybe the outcomes will douse the 128th Kentucky
Derby with clarity. It's about time.</LD>
<LD>   After three months of prep races for the Derby, which will be run
three weeks from today in Louisville, 70 miles east of here, all this
crop of 3-year-olds has proved is that this is a
fasten-your-seat-belts year. No one of sound mind projects a Triple
Crown sweep anymore, because such prognosticators have been wrong for
23 years, and this time around nobody would dare suggest that the
same horse might win two of the three races in the demanding
five-week series.</LD>
<LD>   It is frustrating enough that no horse has done enough in the
preliminaries to qualify as a compelling Derby favorite. The winners
of these preps are also not exempt from potshots, and that widespread
uncertainty about their ability to win on May 4 has allowed trainers
from California to Dubai to cling to their hopes. Consequently, there
probably will be 20 starters, the maximum number, in the Derby for
the first time since 1984, which would ensure a roughhouse running
that will leave half the field with excuses.</LD>
<TE>   Today's card starts with the $750,000 Wood Memorial at Aqueduct,
where the last two Derby winners--Monarchos and Fusaichi
Pegasus--prepped. Half an hour later, at Keeneland, Harlan's Holiday
can become a lukewarm Derby favorite by beating five rivals, one that
pest Booklet, in the $750,000 Blue Grass Stakes.</TE>
<TE>   The nightcap is the $500,000 Arkansas Derby at Oaklawn Park, where
the track handicapper probably needed to pick the favorites by lot.</TE>
<TE>   This is the kind of year it has been: Trainer Neil Drysdale, who
won the Derby with Fusaichi Pegasus in 2000, has two candidates,
neither bred in the U.S. Flying Dash, a German-bred, won his American
debut at Keeneland a week ago. Today, Drysdale will saddle Sunday
Break, a Japanese-bred, in the Wood.</TE>
<TE>   Should Fusao Sekiguchi, who also campaigned Fusaichi Pegasus,
green-light Flying Dash into the Derby, Drysdale will first run him
at Keeneland--in the colt's debut on dirt--next Saturday in the
Lexington Stakes.</TE>
<TE>   "There are about 35,000 horses bred in the U.S. every year," said
Drysdale, musing about the beginnings of his two horses. "Where are
they all?"</TE>
<TE>   Only four foreign-breds have won the Derby, none since the
Canadian import Sunny's Halo in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   Harlan's Holiday is as American as Uncle Sam, but he bears the
stigma of being an Ohio-bred, one of whom hasn't won the Derby since
Wintergreen in 1909.</TE>
<TE>   "I still think it's been a good thing that he's an Ohio-bred,"
said trainer Ken McPeek. "He was able to run early in races
restricted to Ohio-breds, and those two wins helped get his career
rolling."</TE>
<TE>   Elevated to open company, Harlan's Holiday won only one of three
meetings with Booklet in Florida this winter, but scored the lone
victory in the most important race, the Florida Derby, a month ago.
Harlan's Holiday is the 6-5 favorite on the Blue Grass morning line
but many expect Booklet, the 5-2 second choice, to even the score.
The Keeneland track frequently favors horses with the kind of early
foot that Booklet possesses and, unlike the Florida Derby, there are
no speed-crazy horses that might run Booklet into the ground, the way
Smooth Jazz did at Gulfstream Park.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the field are Azillion, Bob's Image, Ocean Sound and
Straight Gin. None have ever won a graded stake. Combined for the
year, that quartet has won only three of 13 starts.</TE>
<TE>   In the eight-horse Wood, the favorites at respective odds of 5-2
and 3-1 are Medaglia d'Oro--"gold medal" in Italian--and Saarland,
who is perhaps at an advantage with a win and a second over the
track.</TE>
<TE>   Combined, these two colts have run only three times this year,
Medaglia d'Oro beating a good field at Santa Anita in the San Felipe
in his most recent try. That was the first time trainer Bobby Frankel
saddled the colt, after negotiating the deal that brought Medaglia
d'Oro to his current owner, Edmund Gann, in February.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the Wood field includes Sunday Break, Buddha, Blue
Burner, Nokoma, Laissezaller and Iwin.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhat by default, Private Emblem is the 7-2 favorite in the
11/8-mile Arkansas Derby. The New York-bred--a horse from that state
has never won the Kentucky Derby--was a soundly beaten third in his
only start beyond a mile. He is trained by Steve Asmussen, who is
running a second horse, Windward Passage, at 4-1. Also at 4-1 is Mr.
Mellon, who broke his maiden at 11/16 miles in February and a month
later notched another two-turn victory in a minor stake at Turfway
Park. In this year of living uncertainly, only two improving wins
like that make Mr. Mellon a colt to contemplate. Seat belts fastened?</TE>
<TE>   Stopping off at Keeneland en route to Aqueduct to ride longshot
Iwin in the Wood, Kent Desormeaux won Thursday's $100,000 Jenny Wiley
Stakes with the Bobby Frankel-trained Tates Creek, then added another
win Friday with Neil Drysdale's Touch Of The Blues in the $200,000
Maker's Mark Mile. Touch Of The Blues, a 12-1 shot, was winless in
six previous U.S. starts.... For Officer, make it the Lexington
Stakes at Keeneland next Saturday instead of the Derby Trial at
Churchill Downs.... Off the Derby trail, Mayakovsky, the fourth-place
finisher in the Santa Anita Derby, is scheduled to run in the Derby
Trial. The Preakness might follow.... Trainer Jerry Hollendorfer,
still on the fence about running U S S Tinosa in the Derby, would
need a big effort from Cappuchino in today's $150,000 California
Derby at Bay Meadows to throw him into the Derby mix.... Trainer
Aidan O'Brien is still considering Johannesburg and Castle Gandolfo
for the Derby.</TE>

<HD>Moving Yin</HD>
<DH>Standout Pitcher Leaves Familiar Small-School Setting to
Experience Large-School Environment, Competition</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN ARRITT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Graduation was only four months away for Alison Yin when she ended
her eight-year stay at Pasadena Westridge, a prestigious all-girls'
school, by transferring to Santa Ana Foothill High.</LD>
<LD>   The February move surprised many within the tight-knit Westridge
community and those in club and high school softball circles. It was
well known that Foothill lacked an experienced arm heading into this
season, but Yin was never mentioned as a possible successor to
Courtney Fossatti, a first-team Louisville Slugger/National Fastpitch
Coaches Assn. All-American last season.</LD>
<LD>   Two months into the season, Yin is 14-1 with a 0.35 earned-run
average and 129 strikeouts in 83 innings heading into today's first
round of the Foothill tournament.</LD>
<TE>   "I've never been in a situation where I've practiced and played at
such a high level every day," said Yin, who signed with North
Carolina in December. "I'm really glad I made the right choice."</TE>
<TE>   For Yin, the decision to transfer was fueled by a final
opportunity to compete for a top-notch high school program and a
chance for a public-school experience before heading off to college.
With an enrollment approaching 2,300, Foothill has nearly five times
as many students as Westridge.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the co-ed environment at Foothill, the bigger classes,"
she said. "I like the chance to experience what most kids get to
experience."</TE>
<TE>   In order to proceed with the transfer, Yin moved out of her
parents' Glendale home and rented a room in Tustin from family
friends, who established legal guardianship. The chance to live
semi-independently before leaving for North Carolina also played a
part in her decision to change schools.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm doing all my own laundry and grocery shopping," she said. "I
think it has been a good bridge before heading off to college."</TE>
<TE>   Yin quietly arrived on campus on Feb. 4, the first day of the
second semester. She was so quiet, in fact, that Foothill Coach Joe
Gonzalez said he never had a chance to tell her that practice is not
held on Foothill's campus but across the street at another school.</TE>
<TE>   A teammate finally tracked down Yin as she was preparing to leave
the school's parking lot and brought her to practice, where she met
her new teammates for the first time. Not long after, she was firing
strike after strike.</TE>
<TE>   "I had never even seen her pitch before," Gonzalez said, "but she
fit in as if she had been here all four years."</TE>
<TE>   The transfer of Yin has forced Gonzalez to go on the defensive for
the first time in his 13 years at Foothill. Nobody has directly
accused him or his assistants of recruiting Yin, but he's heard some
second-hand complaints.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez points to the long list of players who have starred at
Foothill and nearly all were home-grown talent.</TE>
<TE>   "We've never had any players transfer in and there's a reason for
that," he said. "Our school is impacted; if you don't live in the
attendance area, you don't go there."</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez added: "One of the fun parts about competing is competing
within the rules."</TE>
<TE>   Yin played for Westridge her freshman and sophomore seasons, then
sat out last season, though she said she preferred not to discuss her
reasons. Bailey Brown, who coached Lin during her freshman year at
Westridge, said it was clear that year that Lin was in a class by
herself.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't have one kid who could catch her," said Brown, who is
coaching the Tigers' softball team again this season. "Nobody could
even catch her overhand throws."</TE>
<TE>   Morgan Muir, a junior catcher for Westridge, played the same
position during Yin's sophomore season. She remembers the webbing of
her glove exploding after one fastball. A bone in her hand fell
victim to several others.</TE>
<TE>   "She kept chipping away at it," Muir said of her injury. "My
doctor had never seen a fracture like that."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Muir said she would have loved to catch Yin again this
season. Westridge has a 2-0 record in the Prep League and is off to
its best start ever.</TE>
<TE>   "We would have been a shoo-in for league if we still had her,"
Muir said. "It's a little disheartening that she transferred."</TE>
<TE>   Brown holds a similar opinion, saying she was shocked when she
learned Yin was leaving Westridge so close to graduation.</TE>
<TE>   "I had not seen anything like that before," Brown said. "I'm happy
for her, but I question why she wouldn't want to graduate from
Westridge."</TE>
<TE>   Yin said she weighed the once-in-a-lifetime opportunities offered
her at Foothill with the chance to finish school at Westridge and
found her decision to be relatively easy.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, Westridge is a fine private school, she considered, but a
diploma from Foothill is nothing to be ashamed of.</TE>
<TE>   "The name of the school [on your diploma] doesn't really compare
to being able to end high school on your own terms," she said.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Yin has been a good fit at Foothill. The Knights have six
returning starters from last season's team that won the Century
League for the 11th consecutive season.</TE>
<TE>   Yin shares the same level of respect her teammates and coaches
have for softball, enjoys how the players sprint onto the playing
fields before games and their determination, no matter the score.</TE>
<TE>   In the seventh inning of a recent one-sided victory over Santa Ana
Valley, sophomore second baseman Whitney Radcliff sprinted after a
foul pop fly, dived unsuccessfully for the ball and landed hard.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what's so great about Foothill," Lin said, referring to
Radcliff's effort. "There's so much respect for the game."</TE>
<TE>   Before Yin arrived, Gonzalez was sure the Knights had the offense
and defense to compete with any team in the region, but pitching was
a concern. The Knights have two freshmen pitchers with a wealth of
potential but little big-game experience.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been an adventure, for sure," Gonzalez said.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, it's Yin who will be in the circle again today, when the
Knights host Anaheim Esperanza at 9 a.m. in a first-round tournament
game.</TE>

<LD>No matter how he does in New York with Medaglia d'Oro in the $750,000
Wood Memorial or Shibboleth in the $350,000 Carter Handicap, trainer
Bobby Frankel should add another stakes to his resume at Santa Anita.</LD>
<LD>   Megahertz, a 3-year-old English-bred filly, is the 3-5 favorite to
remain unbeaten in her third race in this country in the
$75,000-added Providencia Stakes at 11/8 miles on the turf.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Michael Bello, Megahertz won once in eight starts in
France, but has been perfect since joining the Frankel stable.</LD>
<TE>   A fat 10-1 when making her debut in the Blue Norther on Jan. 9,
she rallied from next-to-last to win going away, then took the Some
Sensation nearly two months later. She again came from well off the
pace to win by two lengths, but was the 2-1 favorite this time.</TE>
<TE>   This will be her first attempt beyond a mile, but the way she has
finished in her two races suggest that should be no problem.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Take your pick among the Wood Memorial and Carter
Handicap at Aqueduct, Arkansas Derby at Oaklawn Park, Blue Grass
Stakes at Keeneland and California Derby at Bay Meadows.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Bob Baffert. Santa Anita's leading trainer won with
five of seven starters between Sunday and Thursday, and his two
losers ran second to two of his winners.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Jorge Chavez. One of the country's top riders, he
started Keeneland with only one winner from his first 14 mounts.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet Total: 1/216. Money: Previous day/meet
Total: $3.20/$1,253.40. Total money bet: $1,340.</TE>

<HD>Berth in Playoffs Is Clinched on Day Off</HD>

<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>In November, when they were in danger of falling hopelessly out of
contention, Coach Andy Murray told the Kings that they would need 93
points to reach the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   As it turned out, he was right.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings clinched a playoff berth with 93 points Friday night
when the Edmonton Oilers lost to the Calgary Flames, 2-0, at
Edmonton, Canada, putting the Kings out of the Oilers' reach in the
playoff race.</LD>
<TE>   But that doesn't mean that the Kings' last two games of the
regular season, today against the San Jose Sharks at the Compaq
Center and Sunday against the Mighty Ducks at Staples Center, are
meaningless.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings are tied with Phoenix for sixth but could finish
anywhere from fourth in the Western Conference, which would give them
home-ice advantage in the first round, to eighth, which would give
them a first-round rematch against the Detroit Red Wings.</TE>
<TE>   Also possible: A first-round series against the Sharks, who have
clinched the Pacific Division championship but still figure to be
highly motivated against the visitors today. They are 0-4 against the
Kings.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings earned their 92nd and 93rd points Monday night with a
3-0 victory over the Dallas Stars, then sweated out the last few
days.</TE>
<TE>   "Never has a team missed the playoffs with 93 points, but it
looked like that might not be enough," Murray said. "Now we want to
improve our standing these last two games and go into the playoffs
playing the way we want."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, a regulation loss by the Vancouver Canucks against the
Colorado Avalanche would have put them in the playoffs, but the
Canucks won.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, a tie or loss by the Oilers against the Phoenix
Coyotes would have clinched a playoff berth for the Kings, but the
Oilers won.</TE>
<TE>   Then, on Thursday night, the Kings could have taken care of
business themselves with a tie or overtime loss against the Canucks,
but they lost in regulation.</TE>
<TE>   "So many times this year we've milked the cow and kicked over the
bucket," defenseman Mathieu Schneider said. "We've put ourselves in
bad situations, but that's when we play our best hockey, for whatever
reason."</TE>

<HD>They're Preparing to Really Defend Title</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Lakers did not practice Friday afternoon, Phil Jackson allowing
everyone a migraine day before they get down to the grave business of
defending their consecutive NBA titles.</LD>
<LD>   Besides, Jackson has grown reasonably pleased with their
willingness to play defense, an eight-game trend in which the Lakers
have allowed an average of 89.1 points and a field-goal percentage of
40.6%.</LD>
<LD>   That includes the New Jersey Nets shooting 50% (86 attempts) on
April 3, but also the Portland Trail Blazers' Scottie Pippen shooting
11.1% (18 attempts) on March 29, by himself balancing the statistical
anomaly.</LD>
<TE>   At this point, Jackson would rather save their legs and minds than
press them further, the way he often leans in matters of rest versus
grind. The Lakers practice today and fly this afternoon to Portland,
where they'll play the Trail Blazers on Sunday afternoon, a week
before the divergent franchises could meet in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers are winning again because they no longer seem reluctant
to defend. Indeed, they often remind themselves that it not only
helped them to win championships, but carried those playoff runs,
particularly when Shaquille O'Neal was spry.</TE>
<TE>   "My take on it," assistant coach Jim Cleamons said, "is that they
have finally decided to play better defense."</TE>
<TE>   Why now? The calendar. It's April, the fur coats and black
Mercedes are stored, the gray Mercedes and the defensive slides and
attitudes come out.</TE>
<TE>   "They have realized they have to raise their game," Cleamons said.
"And they have made a conscious effort to focus just a bit more.
They're expending more energy and I think they're being more
conscientious of their roles.... You've seen guys playing a little
harder. They've heightened their state of alertness. They obviously
didn't have the energy to do it for 82 games."</TE>
<TE>   Few teams do, but more is expected of the defending champions,
particularly when they spent the first fifth of the season on a
75-win pace. A lot has happened since, including the complications in
O'Neal's toe and wrist. Everybody looks better when he's going well,
and he's been reasonably healthy for a week, at least enough to
promise George Mikan 45 points Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   It reflects first in their defense, where already they rank first
in field-goal percentage allowed, both on two- and three-point
attempts, even with O'Neal at half-speed.</TE>
<TE>   "This time of year you start to anticipate the emotion level
that's a part of late-season and postseason action," Derek Fisher
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Minnesota Timberwolves shot 33.3% on Thursday and the Utah
Jazz shot 32.1% on Tuesday, and they're both going to the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Laker General Manager Mitch Kupchak said Friday he is satisfied
that Jackson handled O'Neal's absence from Wednesday's practice
properly, and that he suspects O'Neal will have perfect attendance in
the future.</TE>
<TE>   The club was told O'Neal had a migraine and a stomach affliction,
but Jackson fined O'Neal anyway. O'Neal attended a business function
in Las Vegas later Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been addressed," Kupchak said. "It happened, it wasn't
overlooked, it wasn't permissible, and he was fined. It's done."</TE>

<LD>So, Johnnie Cochran is suing NASCAR [April 9] to break up its
"monopoly." Imagine that!</LD>
<LD>   Let's see, millions of dollars flow into NASCAR; they sell out all
over the country; they get a huge TV audience; their followers don't
seem to ever get enough. Gee, John, that sounds more like an
invitation to compete rather than a monopoly.</LD>
<LD>   But then you and I know, John, that it's easier to try to take
away something someone else has created than to create something
yourself.</LD>

<LD>Wednesday's article on the Nike corporation's connections with
Southland high school basketball teams is wrong-headed. The piece
suggests that it is because of Nike's gifts to such schools as
Crenshaw, Fairfax and Westchester that they are successful.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, coaches Willie West, Harvey Kitani and Ed Azzam,
excellent coaches and teachers all, had highly successful programs
long before Nike looked their way. They attracted Nike's attention
precisely because they were successful. The article has it backward.</LD>
<LD>   Howard Safier</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After reading the attack on Westchester High's basketball program,
because of their sponsorship by Nike, I was amazed at the pettiness
of some of the arguments. Most large school districts do not provide
uniforms necessary to play. Parents end up paying for these equipment
costs. The best coaches find ways to curb these expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Nike did not build the program at Westchester. It was built by a
coach who has dedicated his life to a sport and a public school. It
was built by children who have worked day after day to be the best
they can be, and move on to college.</TE>
<TE>   If a program is strong, it stands to reason that it will attract
attention and sponsors. If a school is strong, it will attract the
best students and teachers. People who find fault in the
teacher-coaches and players who compete and win by the rules year
after year have the same opportunities, and should question their own
abilities to create a wonderful program.</TE>

<LD>Evaluating an NBA team's relative ranking is, of course, a subjective
matter. However, Mark Heisler's weekly ranking of the Boston Celtics
is--certainly beyond debate--biased. This week two teams with worse
records were rated higher. It matters not if the Celtics are in a
slump, a winning streak, or, it seems, season sweeping his beloved
Lakers.</LD>
<LD>   Paranoia? No, not when combined with Heisler's back-handed
compliments if not outright hostility in his comments and coverage of
the Celtics. (Memo to Heisler: Rick Pitino is no longer the coach;
this isn't last season's team.) Are the Celtics a top-tier team? Not
yet. But Heisler would serve his readers far better if he left his
prejudice behind and evaluated the teams based on performance, not
team rivalry.</LD>

<LD>Hey, guys and dolls of the LPGA, it is the golf that is important.
Yes, belly buttons can generate excitement. But I can see those at
any mall any day. It is great golf that will bring fans to the
tournaments. However, the great golf has been missing from the LPGA
Tour. When there is a field of 144 players and fewer than five finish
the tournament under par, fans aren't watching great golf.</LD>
<LD>   A few LPGA players are carrying the rest. They don't need to get
to Nordstrom and get their short shorts, they need to get to the
driving range with their coach and do what it takes to improve their
game.</LD>

<HD>Da Matta Has the Edge in Qualifying</HD>
<DH>Auto racing: He costs his Newman-Haas teammate, Fittipaldi,
a point by clocking 102.542 mph for fastest of first day at Long
Beach.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Christian Fittipaldi knows the importance of one point.</LD>
<LD>   One point more in 1999 and he would have been CART champion and $1
million richer. As it was, he and Juan Montoya finished the season
with 212 points each and Montoya was declared champion because he had
more victories.</LD>
<LD>   One point was at stake Friday when the 28th Toyota Grand Prix of
Long Beach got underway with qualifying for Sunday's 90-lap race
around a twisting 11-turn, 1.97-mile circuit with the Queen Mary as a
backdrop.</LD>
<TE>   Again, Fittipaldi came up a point short.</TE>
<TE>   With time running out on the one-hour session, Fittipaldi's lap of
102.352 mph looked like a winner. Then his Newman-Haas teammate,
Cristiano da Matta, squeezed out one slightly faster, 102.542 mph, to
gain the point.</TE>
<TE>   Both drove Toyota-powered Lolas for the team owned by Paul Newman
and Carl Haas.</TE>
<TE>   The point padded da Matta's lead in the CART season, giving him 22
points to 16 for Dario Franchitti and 14 for Fittipaldi.</TE>
<TE>   It also assured da Matta, winner of the season opener last month
in Monterrey, Mexico, a spot in the front row, no matter what happens
in today's second round of qualifying at 1:45 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Curiously, although da Matta has won five races--including the
last three--in four seasons as a CART regular, he has never won a
pole.</TE>
<TE>   "The car ran better than it did in Mexico," da Matta said. "I
would love to get my first pole, but it's a good feeling to know that
we are still out in front."</TE>
<TE>   Fittipaldi was fastest at Monterrey, but because he caused a red
flag during qualifying, he was penalized his fastest lap and the pole
and the point went to Adrian Fernandez. Fittipaldi was also fastest
during morning practice Friday.</TE>
<TE>   One of the many changes Chris Pook made after taking over last
December as president and chief executive officer of CART was to
change the qualifying format and give the first day some meaning.
Today's fastest car also will be on the front row, with the pole
going to the fastest of both days.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, the fastest first-day qualifier was only a
provisional pole-sitter and could slide down the grid if second-day
speeds were faster.</TE>
<TE>   Jimmy Vasser and Michel Jourdain Jr., driving Lola-Ford-Cosworths
for Bobby Rahal, took the next two positions. Vasser, who was fastest
before Fittipaldi and da Matta moved in, had a 102.126 mph lap, with
Jourdain at 101.869 mph.</TE>
<TE>   "I came up on traffic in the hairpin and unfortunately it slowed
me up," said Vasser, winner of the 1996 race. "Then on the last lap I
had a clear go at it, but I started out a bit conservative because I
knew it was my last lap and I didn't want to make a mistake right off
the bat. It's difficult with this system to wait for the right time
and then go out and not encounter traffic."</TE>
<TE>   Although drivers have an hour to qualify, they are limited to 15
laps.</TE>
<TE>   This created a vacuum at the start of qualifying. When starter Jim
Swintal waved the green flag, no one wanted to go. In fact, it was 19
minutes before rookie Mario Dominguez ventured out, taking several
laps before Paul Tracy led a pack onto the track.</TE>
<TE>   Although Dominguez's name was atop the leader board for some time,
his 100.380 mph dropped him back to 17th in the 20-car field.</TE>
<TE>   One of the big surprises was Michael Andretti's inability to get
his Reynard-Honda up to speed. The three-time Long Beach winner's
100.431 mph left him 16th.</TE>
<TE>   "We made a big change from the morning and basically took a gamble
and it didn't pay off," he said. "In fact, I think it made things a
bit worse, but I'm confident we can go back and have a better car.
We've got some work to do tonight."</TE>
<TE>   From da Matta's fastest lap to Scott Dixon's at No. 20, the gap
was only 2.05 seconds.</TE>

<DH>Auto racing: Patrick steals the thunder from luminaries in
qualifying for pro-celebrity race.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>She is a scant 102 pounds, with long brown hair and Hollywood good
looks that make her fit right in with the celebrities in the paddock,
but Danica Patrick isn't part of that crowd.</LD>
<LD>   Patrick is a racer and, though few know her in America, she is a
good one.</LD>
<LD>   The 20-year-old was the fastest qualifier Friday for today's
Toyota pro-celebrity race at the Grand Prix of Long Beach. Patrick
didn't just out-qualify the celebrities in identically prepared
Toyota Celicas, but also two-time Indy 500 starter Sarah Fisher and
Tommy Kendall, the only man to win four Trans-Am sedan championships.</LD>
<TE>   "She's obviously the real deal," said Kendall, who qualified
second at 66.358 mph. "Finishing second in the [European] Formula
Ford Festival shows that. Only one American ever finished as high as
second, and that was Danny Sullivan in 1974. That is one of the most
prestigious races for a young driver in Europe."</TE>
<TE>   Patrick led the field at 66.458 mph and a time of 1 minute 46.606
seconds on the 1.97-mile layout. Fisher, with her Indy Racing League
reputation, is much better known in the United States than Patrick
and qualified third in her first road course event.</TE>
<TE>   The top qualifier among the celebrities was swimmer Dara Torres,
an Olympic gold medalist who was less than two seconds behind
Patrick. Torres will be starting on the pole, alongside former pro
wrestler Bill Goldberg, and will lead a field of 12 celebrities, who
get a 30-second head start over the pro drivers in the 10-lap race.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick, from Roscoe, Ill., spent the last four seasons racing
Formula Ford and Formula Vauxhall in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   In its first 25 years, the pro-celebrity race has never been won
by a woman in either the pro or celebrity category.</TE>
<TE>   "Me and Goldberg have turned it into a battle of the sexes,"
Kendall said. "Neither one of us wants to be in the first race won by
a girl. We have some fragile male egos."</TE>
<TE>   Patrick is basically networking this weekend, hoping to get her
name out with an eye toward landing a ride in the Toyota Atlantic
Series, which has replaced Indy Lights as CART's primary development
series.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not what you know, it's who you know," she said. "The more
talk about a single person, the better it is. Out of sight, out of
mind."</TE>
<TE>   And in Europe, Patrick was out of sight. Today, people will be
watching her.</TE>
<TE>   In provisional qualifying for the Atlantic race, Hylton
Motorsports rookie Ryan Hunter-Reay, hoping to give team owner Keith
Hylton his second consecutive Atlantic championship, took the pole
with an average speed of 89.687 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Jon Fogarty, the winner on the road course in Monterrey in
the season opener, was second to Hunter-Reay at 89.468 mph, Alex
Gurney of Newport Beach was fourth and rookie Luis Diaz was fifth,
all for Dorricott Racing, the team that produced two of the last
three champions in the defunct Lights series.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Valiante of Lynx Racing was third at 89.451 mph. The first
seven drivers were within six-tenths of a second of Hunter-Reay.</TE>

and each race drew nine 3-year-old fillies.</LD>
<LD>   The 10 fastest times will qualify for the 400-yard La Primera Del
Ano Derby, which will be run a week from tonight.</LD>
<TE>   In the first trial, the eighth race on the 10-race program, Mini
Rock will be a solid favorite. Trained by Blane Schvaneveldt for
owner Jay Parsons, the daughter of Chicks Beduino has been 1-2 in six
of nine starts. Most recently, she was second to Panther Mountain in
the Los Alamitos Winter Derby on Feb. 23.</TE>
<TE>   A race later, Costa Mesa Handicap winner Babe On The Beach will
aim for her fifth win in 14 starts for trainer Paul Jones. Other
contenders in the trial include She Reigns and Corona Perfection.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. SRQH Kiss This. 2. Reality Check. 3. Lili Call Me.
4. Short Sale. 5. Hi Tori. 6. Rubin's Pride. 7. Delta Kas. 8. Mini
Rock. 9. Babe On The Beach. 10. Tierra Firme.</TE>
<TE>   Four!  In the seventh, let's use all, single Mini Rock in the
eighth and Babe On The Beach in the ninth and use Truly Tia, Leaving
The Fire, Her Valentine and Tierra Firme in the 10th. Total cost:
$24.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Militate is off the rail and should improve
second time out in the first for Schvaneveldt. Tam's Nitemare could
fire fresh under Eddie Aceves in the sixth in the only thoroughbred
race of the night.</TE>

<DL>AUGUSTA, Ga.</DL>
<LD>For the first time since 1983, Arnold Palmer made it to the weekend
at the Masters. All right, it's only a technicality. Friday's showers
prevented the second round from being completed, with Palmer on the
13th hole.</LD>
<LD>   It rained on the King's last parade at the Masters and even that
didn't stop Palmer from making what had to be one of the grandest--if
interrupted--exits that golf has ever seen.</LD>
<LD>   Time after time, at every tee box and every fairway rope, Palmer
stopped to shake hands and say hello to his fans.</LD>
<TE>   Despite being nine over after 12 holes, he was smiling at every
hole and seemed to enjoy every moment of what was to be his farewell
round.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer, 72, last made the cut at the Masters in 1983, when he tied
for 36th.</TE>
<TE>   He announced in a tearful news conference Thursday that his next
round would be his last at the Masters, which he has played for 48
consecutive years.</TE>
<TE>   There are fast starts and then there are really fast starts.
Thomas Bjorn birdied the first five holes, which nobody had ever done
at the Masters. He played the last 13 holes in par, but his 67 moved
him to three-under 141.</TE>
<TE>   Merchandise tent update: Quickest items to sell out were the
new-design Masters logo cap and souvenir shot glasses. The most
overstocked item? Tubes of suntan lotion.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mark O'Meara shot a 71, but his day began with a salute to Palmer
in the locker room.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him, 'You mean so much to the game, you set the stage, you
are a guy I've always thought was the man. You still are the man. I
love you. You are the man and you will always be the man.'"</TE>
<TE>   O'Meara is five over and will probably miss the cut, projected at
three over.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fred Couples birdied three of the last four holes and shot 73,
which made him happy, but he was very unhappy about the condition of
the course because of the showers.</TE>
<TE>   "I did get upset because the course was under water," he said. "I
saw them squeegeeing the fifth green. I was screaming my head off.
Well, not really screaming, but talking louder to the officials. But
I apologized.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they dropped the ball on [the decision to play],
but I had never seen that before. Every shot was almost a casual
water shot. The eighth fairway had a river running down it."</TE>
<TE>   Couples on Palmer: "That's a legend who's gone.... It's sad. It's
a loss. His score is irrelevant."</TE>
<TE>   Couples, 42, on the 10-year anniversary of his 1992 Masters
victory: "It means I'm a lot older than I was when I won."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Put Stewart Cink in the anti-water brigade too. He shot 70 but
said he did so despite the conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "It was pretty much over-the-line unplayable," he said. "When you
have standing water on the green, that is above and beyond what we
should do in a major championship. It was over the line, no question.</TE>
<TE>   "Heck, my umbrella was gathering water at one point."</TE>

<LD>The Indiana Pacers couldn't go wrong getting the ball to a Miller in
overtime.</LD>
<LD>   Reggie Miller and Brad Miller scored Indiana's 14 points in
overtime and made five of six free throws in the final 36 seconds,
and the Pacers defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, 112-107, Friday night at
Indianapolis.</LD>
<LD>   Reggie Miller scored a season-high 30 points, Brad Miller had 24
points and eight rebounds and Jermaine O'Neal had 20 points and 13
rebounds, helping Indiana keep its playoff hopes alive.</LD>
<TE>   The Pacers and Bucks each are 39-40, but Milwaukee has the
tiebreaker with a 3-1 advantage in the season series. The Pacers will
have to finish with a better record to avoid not qualifying for the
playoffs for the first time since 1996-97.</TE>
<TE>   "This puts us in a better situation, but we're not there yet,"
Brad Miller said. "We've got an opportunity to go and win out.
Hopefully, that will put us in a position to make the playoffs. It
should be really easy to motivate us to go out there and play."</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Bender scored 16 points for Indiana, including the
game-tying free throws with 36 seconds left in regulation.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Allen and Sam Cassell each had 24 points for the Bucks, who
have lost 11 in a row on the road.</TE>
<TE>   The score was tied, 107-107, when Ervin Johnson was called for his
sixth foul, going over the back of Brad Miller. Miller made one of
two free throws for a 108-107 lead. Reggie Miller then made four

<HD>Dakich Abruptly Leaves West Virginia</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dan Dakich's abrupt departure from West Virginia on Friday leaves
more questions than answers.</LD>
<LD>   Dakich quit as West Virginia's men's basketball coach a week after
being hired, a decision the school said was based on a possible NCAA
rules violation last season, and returned to Bowling Green.</LD>
<LD>   In a news conference at Bowling Green, Dakich refused to say what
led to his decision, but said he thought about leaving soon after
taking the job with the Mountaineers.</LD>
<TE>   Asked if the possible NCAA rules violation was the reason he left
West Virginia, Dakich said, "No."</TE>
<TE>   "You just don't make a decision that affects you and your family
off of one thing," he said. "I am not going to get into all the
things that went on."</TE>
<TE>   West Virginia President David Hardesty disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm kind of disturbed," Hardesty said. "I just don't think it's
one thing. I think it's totally Coach Dakich. He went where he felt
he needed to go.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's not a good fit, it's not a good fit."</TE>
<TE>   West Virginia said it was looking into the amateur status of a
player on last season's team and had notified the NCAA and the Big
East Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Hardesty said the violation came to light when Dakich talked to
players about last season.</TE>
<TE>   "One player made a comment that gave him some concern," Hardesty
said.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Knight's son, a Texas Tech assistant athletic director, failed
to pay the university for school merchandise he sent to a store he
owned in Indiana, Texas Tech officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Knight did not commit a criminal act but used "poor accounting
practices," school spokeswoman Cindy Rugeley said.</TE>
<TE>   The merchandise, about 900 miniature basketballs, some caps and
media guides, were shipped to The General's Store in Indianapolis.
The store was owned by Tim Knight and operated by his mother, Nancy,
the former wife of Bob Knight, men's coach at Texas Tech.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford center Curtis Borchardt, who led the Pacific 10
Conference in rebounding and blocked shots, has decided to make
himself available for the NBA draft.</TE>
<TE>   Nevada gave men's coach Trent Johnson a three-year, $654,000
contract. Johnson led Nevada to a 17-13 record last season, the
school's best since finishing 21-10 in 1996-97.... Brad Soderberg,
39, became men's coach at Saint Louis, one year after joining the
Billikens as an assistant. He replaces Lorenzo Romar, who last week
became coach at Washington.... Portland State men's Coach Joel
Sobotka, 31, resigned to pursue other coaching opportunities. He had
a 53-59 record in four seasons with the Vikings.</TE>
<TE>   Pro Football</TE>
<TE>   As expected, eight-time Pro Bowl selection Shannon Sharpe rejoined
the Denver Broncos, signing a free-agent deal with the team he helped
win two Super Bowls during the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Sharpe, 33, the NFL's career leader in catches by a tight end with
692 and in yards receiving with 8,604, played with the Baltimore
Ravens the last two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Free-agent quarterback Chris Chandler, 36, signed a three-year
contract worth $4.5 million with the Chicago Bears to be Jim Miller's
backup.</TE>
<TE>   With the Atlanta Falcons last season, Chandler passed for 2,847
yards and 16 touchdowns, and had a rating of 84.1 playing behind a
line that gave up 41 sacks.</TE>
<TE>   Chandler set a Falcon game record with 431 yards passing against
Buffalo. The Falcons released Chandler in February.</TE>
<TE>   The San Francisco 49ers signed two-time Pro Bowl guard Ron Stone
to a four-year, $9-million contract. He played with the New York
Giants the last two seasons.... Fullback Mike Alstott and the Tampa
Bay Buccaneers agreed to extend the date the five-time Pro Bowl
selection is to receive a $2-million roster bonus from April 15 to
April 23.... The Oakland Raiders added depth to their offensive line,
signing veteran Brad Badger to a one-year contract. He played with
Minnesota the last two seasons. Financial terms were not released....
Quarterback Scott Covington signed a one-year contract with the
Cincinnati Bengals, who probably will use him as a backup to starter
Jon Kitna and No. 2 Akili Smith.</TE>

<LD>Chris Clark scored a power-play goal in the second period and Roman
Turek stopped 36 shots as the Calgary Flames shut out Edmonton, 2-0,
on Friday night at Edmonton, Alberta, eliminating the Oilers from
postseason contention.</LD>
<LD>   Oiler defenseman Janne Niinimaa took a cross-checking penalty at
14:44 of the second period and the Flames converted the opportunity
seven seconds later when Clark banged a rebound past Tommy Salo off a
shot from the point by Derek Morris.</LD>
<LD>   League scoring leader Jarome Iginla added an empty-net goal at
19:38 of the third, his 52nd goal of the season and 96th point.</LD>
<TE>   When Turek posted his fifth shutout and 30th win of the season,
and the Phoenix Coyotes followed shortly after with a 7-1 victory
over the Minnesota Wild, the Oilers' hopes died.</TE>
<TE>   Edmonton's loss also clinched a playoff berth for the Kings and
Vancouver Canucks, completing the list of the eight playoff teams in
the West.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 7, Minnesota 1--Phoenix moved up in the Western Conference
with 93 points, jumping over idle Vancouver by a point. Both teams
have one game left, but have sewn up postseason berths.</TE>
<TE>   Daymond Langkow scored two goals, including a short-handed one
6:25 into the second period that made it 3-0. Brad May and Landon
Wilson each had a goal and an assist for Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 3, Chicago 1--Jere Lehtinen scored his career-best 24th
goal midway through the third period and added an empty-net goal with
17.7 seconds left as the Stars ended a three-game winless streak and
won at Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 5, Montreal 2--Scott Stevens scored for the first time
in 89 games and the Devils rolled at East Rutherford, N.J., to their
fifth consecutive win. Saku Koivu, who just returned to the lineup
this week after a season-long battle with cancer, assisted on both
Montreal goals as the Canadiens had their season-high seven-game
winning streak stopped.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 5, Pittsburgh 2--Curtis Joseph, who sat out 21 games after
breaking a bone in his hand Feb. 26, stopped 27 shots in his first
game back for the Maple Leafs at Pittsburgh. Joseph improved to
29-17-5 this season.</TE>
<TE>   New York Islanders 3, Tampa Bay 1--Dave Scatchard scored the
go-ahead goal at 9:29 of the third to help the Islanders win at
Tampa, Fla., and keep their Atlantic Division title hopes alive.</TE>
<TE>   Columbus 5, Atlanta 4--Jaroslav Spacek scored a power-play goal 29
seconds into overtime and Grant Marshall had a goal and two assists
to help the Blue Jackets win at Columbus, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Jackets, playing before their 56th consecutive sellout
crowd at Nationwide Arena, ended a three-game losing skid in their
final home game.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 3, Buffalo 1--Sebastien Charpentier stopped 38 shots in
his NHL debut helping the Capitals win at Buffalo, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina 3, Florida 1--Bret Hedican scored the go-ahead goal to

<HD>Maddux a Winner in First Start</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Atlanta Braves were delighted to get five shutout innings from
Greg Maddux, and those five double-play grounders didn't hurt either.</LD>
<LD>   Maddux looked sharp in his first start this year, Chipper Jones
hit a two-run homer in the first inning and defense did the rest for
the Braves in a 2-0 victory over the Florida Marlins on Friday night
at Miami.</LD>
<LD>   Maddux, activated from the disabled list before the game, gave up
four hits and two walks and departed after throwing 76 pitches.</LD>
<TE>   "Not too bad. Not too bad at all," said Maddux, a perfectionist.
"I feel pretty good about how I threw. It's pretty hard to complain
when you don't give up a run."</TE>
<TE>   A sore lower back sent him to the disabled list for the first time
in his career and forced him to sit out his opening-day start.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't even say he was rusty," Brave Manager Bobby Cox said.</TE>
<TE>   John Smoltz pitched out of a two-on, none-out jam in the eighth
and finished for his second save in three chances. Mike Remlinger and
Tim Spooneybarger worked one scoreless inning each in the Braves'
first shutout.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a good bullpen right there," Maddux said.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Josh Beckett (0-1) was impressive. Beckett trailed, 2-0,
when he left after six innings with a blister on his right middle
finger.</TE>
<TE>   Florida's Kevin Millar grounded into three double plays and flied
out with a runner on first to end the game.</TE>
<TE>   After setting a franchise low for attendance the previous two
nights against Montreal, the Marlins drew 12,066 against the 10-time
defending division champions.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 7, Houston 3--Jim Edmonds hit two solo home runs and
J.D. Drew had a long two-run shot, leading the Cardinals at St.
Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Morris (3-0) gave up two runs and six hits in six innings to
beat Houston for the second time in a week. He has won eight
consecutive decisions at Busch Stadium dating to July 24. He has won
16 of his last 17 starts at home.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis scored three times in the third inning. Fernando Vina,
who has been hit by 50 pitches in the last two seasons, was plunked
leading off. One out later, Drew hit a 496-foot shot off the
scoreboard in right field, the eighth-longest homer at Busch since
such statistics began being kept in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 7, Pittsburgh 3--Sammy Sosa hit the longest home run in
the two-year history of Pittsburgh's PNC Park, and Mark Bellhorn also
homered to help the Cubs break out of their slump.</TE>
<TE>   Pirate starter Dave Williams (1-1) hit his first career home run,
but gave up three drives of 400 feet or longer, including an
estimated 484-foot shot by Sosa to center field. It was Sosa's fifth
home run.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Bere (1-1), a 2-1 loser to Williams last week at Wrigley
Field, gave up Williams' drive but otherwise held down Pittsburgh's
slumbering offense, giving up three hits in six innings.</TE>
<TE>   The Pirates lost their third in a row following five consecutive
victories. The Cubs had scored only nine runs in their previous six
games.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 8, Philadelphia 5--Juan Encarnacion homered in his
third consecutive game and Barry Larkin doubled to key a six-run
rally in the seventh inning at Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Larkin, who tripled and scored in the sixth inning, hit a double
that tied the score in the seventh and scored the go-ahead run.</TE>
<TE>   Wilton Guerrero had a run-scoring triple, Aaron Boone doubled home
a run and Sean Casey and Jason LaRue each had run-scoring hits in the
inning.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Brower (1-0) pitched a scoreless sixth inning and Danny Graves
earned his fourth save.</TE>
<TE>   New York 2, Montreal 1--Jeff D'Amico made an impressive home debut
for the Mets, pitching eight scoreless innings and New York won for
the third time in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Jeromy Burnitz, who came from Milwaukee with D'Amico in a
three-team, 11-player deal in January, hit a solo homer in the second
inning.</TE>
<TE>   D'Amico (1-0) again pitched well at Shea Stadium. In his only
other start there, he threw eight scoreless innings for Milwaukee on
Sept. 13, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The Brewer bullpen blew a 1-0 lead in that game after D'Amico left
because of dizziness and New York went on to win in extra innings.</TE>
<TE>   D'Amico's start two years ago was one of the reasons the Mets
wanted to acquire him this off-season. New York wanted Burnitz
because of his power.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona 8, Colorado 3--Curt Schilling (3-0) gave up three runs in
seven innings at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   The Diamondbacks are 6-0 when Schilling or Randy Johnson start.
When the co-most valuable players of the World Series do not pitch,
Arizona is 0-5.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Counsell had three hits and three runs batted in for
Arizona. Danny Bautista and Junior Spivey each drove in two runs.</TE>
<TE>   The Rockies' Mike Hampton (0-3) lost his fifth consecutive start,
the longest skid of his career. He gave up seven runs and 10 hits in
seven innings.</TE>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Barry Bonds hit his 573rd home run, tying Harmon Killebrew for sixth
place on the career list, and the San Francisco Giants beat
Milwaukee, 5-1, Friday night at San Francisco as the Brewers lost
their sixth straight.</LD>
<LD>   Bonds hit his major league-leading sixth home run of the season, a
three-run shot off Ben Sheets (1-2) in the third inning.</LD>
<LD>   Bonds nearly connected again in the seventh, but his long drive
hooked foul and landed in the water beyond the right-field wall at
Pacific Bell Park.</LD>
<TE>   Kurt Ainsworth (1-0), Sheets' teammate on the gold medal-winning
U.S. team in the 2000 Olympics, earned his first major league
victory. He gave up one run and four hits over seven innings.</TE>
<TE>   Sheets walked David Bell with one out in the first. The young
right-hander appeared a bit nervous facing Bonds, throwing his first
pitch behind the single-season home run leader.</TE>
<TE>   Sheets went on to intentionally walk Bonds before giving up an RBI
single to Jeff Kent. It was Bonds' 1,735th career walk, moving him
ahead of Mickey Mantle for sixth place.</TE>
<TE>   The Brewers tied it in the second. Alex Ochoa reached on shortstop
Ramon Martinez's throwing error and scored two outs later when Jose
Hernandez's high fly to deep right field was lost in the lights by
Reggie Sanders and fell for a triple.</TE>
<TE>   There was an unusual call before Bonds' homer in the third.</TE>
<TE>   Tsuyoshi Shinjo singled and Bell hit a grounder to Eric Young for
a potential double play. Second-base umpire Rick Reed called Shinjo
out, but Young's throw was too late to catch Bell.</TE>
<TE>   Giant Manager Dusty Baker argued that Young never tagged Shinjo.
On the replay, Young appeared to brush Shinjo with his glove while
the ball was in his other hand. Reed and third-base umpire Tim
Tschida huddled and the call was reversed.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds then homered for a 4-1 lead.</TE>

<LD>   The Vaqueros, winners of the last two Southern Section Division I

<TE>   Earlier this week, Peirsol returned from Moscow, where he set the
short-course world record in the 200 backstroke and led the U.S. to a
world record in the 400 medley relay. On Friday, Peirsol won the 200
individual medley in 1 minute 59.11 seconds, the 100 butterfly in
53.64 and anchored the winning 400 freestyle relay (3:23.82).</TE>

<LD>On the Lakers' home court, at the subdued Staples Center where the
lights didn't seem quite as bright, where many fans didn't return
after halftime, where, even if it isn't possible, it seemed as if a
building was taking a deep breath in anticipation of the important
part of its season beginning, the Sacramento Kings won their 60th
game. They beat the Clippers, 125-106, Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   They clinched the NBA Western Conference's best record and, with
that, earned home-court advantage through the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   This wasn't as Vlade Divac said, "the Lakers' home floor.
Tonight."</LD>
<TE>   Time out for appreciation.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Bibby makes the coolest behind-the-back pass to Divac, who
catches it and scores early in the third quarter. Nobody seems to
care except for one young King fan who sits on the aisle, two rows
up, and cheers like crazy for this creative, athletic, well-conceived
play.</TE>
<TE>   There are a lot of those when the Kings play.</TE>
<TE>   Time out for appreciation again.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Christie whips a pass to Peja Stojakovic. Christie doesn't
look at Stojakovic, just slings the ball, about 15 feet, and
Stojakovic catches it, holds it only long enough to pass it back to
Christie, who makes a wide-open three-pointer.</TE>
<TE>   Numbers say the Kings are the best team in the NBA. They have four
more wins than anybody else. But numbers don't tell the whole story.</TE>
<TE>   "Until somebody beats them," Chris Webber said, "the Lakers are
the best team in the league."</TE>
<TE>   By beating them, Webber doesn't mean here, on Wednesday night, in
the regular-season finale. "If we beat them by 20," Webber said, "the
Lakers will only say it doesn't matter. They make up whatever they
want to make up at the time. If they beat us? It doesn't matter. Not
Wednesday."</TE>
<TE>   Before this historic night, when the Kings were going to win their
60th game, something that has never happened in team history, the
Sacramento players were acting as if they've been here before.</TE>
<TE>   They were neither cocky nor unenthusiastic. This milestone number,
this 60, "it's important," Bibby said. "It's a good accomplishment."
Does this mean the Kings are the best team in the league? "I'm not
jumping to any conclusions."</TE>
<TE>   Time out for more appreciation.</TE>
<TE>   Divac, running his 7-foot-1, 260-pound body at top speed, drops a
pass into the arms of Stojakovic, who is also at full gallop, all
6-9, 229 pounds, and there is another layup. The execution is
precise. The anticipation of Stojakovic and the understanding by
Divac of where Stojakovic was going to be at, bam, the moment the
ball needed to hit Stojakovic's hands, are perfect.</TE>
<TE>   Having earned home-court advantage, the Kings find it amusing to
hear other teams (for "teams" read Lakers) say that isn't an
important accomplishment.</TE>
<TE>   "Any team that says they don't need [home court] is lying," Webber
said.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Kings have the best home record in the league (35-4), it
would seem Webber is telling the truth. But the Lakers always relish
the quirkiest challenges and may mean it when they say they don't
care about that home-court thing. They may actually think it will be
fun to have to win a game at Arco Arena when the building will be
shaking with noise.</TE>
<TE>   And that's fine by Webber. "That's what they say," Webber said.
"But I like what we have."</TE>
<TE>   Don't take this for trash talk. Having been eliminated by Utah and
the Lakers (twice) most recently in the playoffs, Webber speaks
respectfully about what is ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "The Pistons had to go through the Celtics before they finally
won," Webber said. "The Bulls had to get through the Pistons to make
a statement. Winning 60 games won't mean anything if we don't win it
all."</TE>
<TE>   Winning 60 (or more) and not beating the Lakers, or anybody else,
will make the Kings, Webber said, just like the Seattle Mariners. The
Mariners can talk all they want about those great and record-tying
116 regular-season wins, but no one else is talking about those now.</TE>
<TE>   Time out for yet more appreciation.</TE>
<TE>   Hidayet Turkoglu smacks Stojakovic right in the hands with one of
those perfect passes. Stojakovic takes one, two, three, four, maybe
five thundering steps. Whistle blows. Not a travel but a Clipper
foul. The Kings are getting the calls that champions get.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe we have the best team," Divac said. "But what I think
now doesn't matter and what other people think now doesn't matter. I
think four teams have a chance to win it all--us, the Lakers, San
Antonio and Dallas. Our record isn't going to matter in the end.</TE>
<TE>   "It's what we do with what we've earned so far. Give us the home
court and let's see what happens. It's great so far but we're not the
champions, and if we fall short, who will care about us?"</TE>
<TE>   Time out for appreciation. The Kings may be gloating a little and
they were happy and smiling, high-fiving and hugging on the bench as
the starters were taken out. But the Kings weren't boastful or
tasteless in their little celebration. They were just winners.</TE>

<DH>Swimming: Vietor is giving back after benefiting from the
'Swim With Mike' fund-raiser at USC.</DH>

<LD>He'll tell you that he's lucky.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Vietor, 37, was paralyzed from the chest down after a
diving accident at Kings River near Fresno on July 4, 2000. He has
slowly regained movement in his lower body since the accident and can
walk short distances with a cane.Vietor has pledged to swim 10 laps
today at the annual "Swim With Mike," an event benefiting former
athletes such as Vietor by providing scholarship money to those left
physically disabled by accident or illness.</LD>
<LD>   "There's no other program anywhere that offers this kind of hope
for kids who are in almost a hopeless situation," Vietor said. "The
'Swim With Mike' program gives them hope, and it really gives them
the world."</LD>
<TE>   "Swim With Mike" was organized in 1981 by Ron Orr, now USC's
associate athletic director and a USC student at the time. It was
scheduled as a one-time fund-raiser to purchase a specially equipped
van for Mike Nyeholt, a Trojan All-American swimmer paralyzed in a
motorcycle accident.</TE>
<TE>   It raised more than $58,000, more than enough to pay for the van.
Nyeholt suggested the excess money be used to help others in similar
situations. Twenty-one years and $3.2 million later, "Swim With
Mike," a volunteer-run program, continues to grow. The event starts
at 8 a.m. at the USC-McDonald's Swim Stadium.There will be other
activities, including a barbecue, instruction from Olympic swimmers
and a relay race between USC football players and song girls.</TE>
<TE>   Undergraduate and graduate students who participated in high
school or college athletics before suffering a physical disability
are eligible to apply to the Physically Challenged Athletes Fund.</TE>
<TE>   The fund covers everything from tuition and room and board to
on-campus transportation to emotional support services. Starting this
year, scholarship money can be used at a university other than USC.</TE>
<TE>   For many recipients, the scholarship allows them to take steps
toward creating lives for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Ashley Olson, who was in a car accident after her freshman year in
high school that left her paraplegic, said she could not have
attended USC without the financial assistance.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been an enormous gift for me to come here," said Olson, a
communications major. "USC is a great school. It's a flat campus, and
it's in L.A. where there are so many opportunities for me."</TE>
<TE>   Vietor didn't realize he also qualified for the scholarship when
he participated in his first "Swim With Mike" event last April. A
former gym rat, Vietor was simply excited about a chance to
participate in the swim-a-thon.</TE>
<TE>   He pledged to swim 40 lengths by using his upper body to pull his
lower body. After completing the first lap, he felt great. But he
quickly fatigued, completing four lengths. Still, he raised $600.</TE>
<TE>   After Vietor, who lettered in football, volleyball and basketball
at Redondo High, finished swimming, Orr told him that he might
qualify for the scholarship. The fund has been helping Vietor pay for
school since he returned last summer to complete the MBA program.</TE>
<TE>   Vietor, a longtime aerospace employee at Northrop Grumman, has
vowed to attend every "Swim With Mike" event for the rest of his
life.</TE>
<TE>   "It really gives me inspiration," Vietor said. "In the long run,
I'll make a lot more money for the program than they'll ever give
me."</TE>

<HD>Powell Cancels Talks With Arafat After Suicide Blast</HD>
<DH>Mideast: A Palestinian woman kills herself and six others in a
marketplace attack on the first day of the U.S. secretary's peace
mission.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>On the first day of his peace mission, Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell held intense talks with Israeli leaders Friday and nearly came
face to face with the violence that brought him here, as a young
Palestinian woman blew herself up at a busy Jerusalem marketplace,
killing six shoppers.</LD>
<LD>   In the wake of the attack, which occurred shortly before Israelis
began the Sabbath at dusk Friday, Powell called off talks scheduled for
today with Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat at his besieged
headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah.</LD>
<LD>   The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a militia linked to Arafat's Fatah
movement, claimed responsibility for the attack. The bomber reportedly
came from the Jenin refugee camp, a focus of Israel's 2-week-old West
Bank offensive and the home of many of the suicide attackers who have
wreaked havoc on Israelis.</LD>
<TE>   In terse language, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
early today that Powell "condemns in the strongest possible terms" the
terrorist attack and "expects Chairman Arafat to do so as well. It is
important that Arafat not miss this opportunity to take a clear stand
against the violence that harms the Palestinian cause."</TE>
<TE>   "In light of today's developments, the secretary will not be meeting
with Arafat Saturday."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said the talks might be rescheduled for Sunday,
although no arrangements have been made--and a decision is likely to
depend on what happens next and whether Arafat complies with the American
demands.</TE>
<TE>   The gruesome suicide bombing shook a bus stop at Mahane Yehuda, an
outdoor market about half a mile from Powell's motorcade and a mile from
the hotel where he is staying. The bomber was identified by Radio Israel
as Nidal Daraghmeh of Jenin.</TE>
<TE>   After an eight-day battle in the Jenin camp, the army moved to collect
and bury the bodies of Palestinian gunmen killed resisting the Israelis.
News of the impending burials stirred fresh allegations, denied by
Israel, that the army killed hundreds of civilians in the camp and is
trying to hide the bodies. Israel's chief justice ordered a temporary
halt to the burial plan late Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's attack in Jerusalem, the 110th suicide bombing in the last 18
months of fighting, drew an angry reaction from the White House, which
charged that extremists are trying to disrupt Powell's mission.</TE>
<TE>   "The president will not be deterred from seeking peace," White House
Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said. "Today would be a very good day for
Yasser Arafat to publicly denounce terrorism and show some
statesmanship."</TE>
<TE>   After just one day in Israel, Powell faces a new crisis. The secretary
is "looking at the whole situation in terms of the bombing and where we
stand and where we are," Boucher told reporters traveling with Powell.</TE>
<TE>   Powell was informed of the bombing by Israeli Defense Minister
Binyamin Ben-Eliezer as he rode in a tightly guarded convoy from his
hotel to the Israeli parliament's helipad to fly to northern Israel. He
then flew over the site as rescue workers and ambulances scrambled to
help the wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Powell later denounced the attack and said it illustrated the "need
for all of us, everyone, the international community, to exert every
effort to find a solution."</TE>
<TE>   Powell also witnessed the mounting dangers along the nearly 50-mile
border between Israel and Lebanon, which has become increasingly tense
during the Israeli offensive. Although the Bush administration dispatched
Powell largely because of the Israeli-Palestinian hostilities, the danger
of the conflict spilling over into neighboring countries has intruded on
Powell's agenda.</TE>
<TE>   As if to underscore the challenge Powell faces, Lebanon-based
Hezbollah guerrillas opened fire with antitank rockets and mortars as the
secretary toured the border.</TE>
<TE>   Powell was briefed by the Israeli military in Safed, which is about
eight miles from the Lebanese border and 20 miles from Shabaa Farms, a
disputed frontier area that is the site of escalating attacks by
Hezbollah. In the midst of what Powell described as a sobering briefing,
Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran and Syria, again opened fire.</TE>
<TE>   Maj. Dinor Shavit, spokesman for Israel's Northern Command, said that
Israel was "not far from reacting, not far from retaliating. We have
people with matches in this region, and it's very easy to light a fire."</TE>
<TE>   It was a rocky start for Powell's diplomatic rescue mission. The
secretary began the day with a four-hour meeting with Israeli Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon, including a 2 1/2-hour session between the two
retired generals and war heroes at Sharon's residence. Sharon showed
Powell gruesome pictures of victims from previous suicide bombings,
according to Israeli sources.</TE>
<TE>   At a joint news conference, Powell used flowery language to describe
the long U.S.-Israeli friendship "that cannot ever be broken" and the two
nations' common purpose in fighting terrorism. But Powell clearly has
deep differences with Israel too.</TE>
<TE>   Despite two weeks of daily U.S. and international pressure to withdraw
from Palestinian territories, Sharon is standing firm on continuing the
Israeli offensive. Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres pointed out
Friday that the original plans called for four weeks of military
operations in Palestinian areas, only half of which has passed.</TE>
<TE>   "In many places, most of the mission was accomplished or are on the
verge of being accomplished, so we are not talking about months, we are
not talking about years--we are talking about a week or something a
little bit more than that," Peres said.</TE>
<TE>   Powell urged Sharon to end the operation quickly. "As a friend of
Israel, we have to take note of the long-term strategic consequences of
the incursions that are underway and their effect on the nations in the
region and the international climate," Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   The secretary also pressed Sharon on the importance of launching a
political process that will lead to a final settlement with the
Palestinians as soon as possible.</TE>
<TE>   An essential part of the process is eventually getting Sharon and
Arafat to discuss a solution that leads to a Palestinian state. But
Sharon said Friday that he cannot reach peace with Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   "With him we cannot reach any settlement; therefore, I believe that
[there] should have been an effort to find somebody else with whom it
would be possible," he said in an interview with CBS.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the political stubbornness and security setbacks, Powell said
Friday that he is prepared to stay as long as it takes to get results.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Surfboard Maker Taking Wing</HD>
<DH>Aerospace: Foam technology is used to create aircraft parts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the X-45 unmanned fighter jet takes off on its maiden flight
next month, the traditional thumbs-up signal may well be replaced with a
"Surf's up!" yell.</LD>
<LD>   It's not because the flight is taking place in California but that the
world's most advanced robotic aircraft will have wings that are
essentially high-tech versions of a surfboard.</LD>
<LD>   A surfer-turned-amateur engineer, who more than three decades ago
began making surfboards, is hoping to revolutionize the aerospace
industry with a technology that has become as ubiquitous as plastic.
Foam, used widely in the manufacturing of lightweight surfboards, is
being put to use in wings and other aircraft parts.</LD>
<TE>   Kent Sherwood, founder of Foam Matrix in Inglewood, is well-known
among local beachcombers. He developed the Malibu Surf Ski paddle board
in the 1960s and in the 1970s introduced the Z-Flex skateboard, which was
the subject of a 2001 Sundance Film Festival award-winning documentary
narrated by Sean Penn.</TE>
<TE>   Sherwood, whose quest to make a better surfboard turned into a
lifelong study of foam structures, is now making waves in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Suzanne Patrick, the Pentagon's deputy secretary for industrial
policy, told a congressional committee last month that the military is
looking for less traditional sources of defense technology. She cited
Sherwood's 12-employee company as a prime example.</TE>
<TE>   "California's Foam Matrix started as a surfboard supplier and now is a
builder of composite wings for the unmanned combat air vehicle," Patrick
told the panel, some of whose members were a bit befuddled by the name.
"Innovation and small firms have always had an important place in our
defense industrial base."</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks earlier, Boeing Co. had awarded Foam Matrix its Supplier
Innovation Award for 2002. Considering that Boeing has 24,000 suppliers,
the recognition for such a small subcontractor came as bit of a surprise.
Boeing is developing the X-45, also known as the unmanned combat air
vehicle, or UCAV, for the Air Force in conjunction with the Pentagon's
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.</TE>
<TE>   "Innovations typically happen when somebody thinks outside the box,"
said John P. Bishop, director of supply management and quality for
Boeing's Phantom Works, the company's research and development group that
is making the UCAV. "This includes the supplier with the new idea and the
Boeing engineer who recommended going with the supplier in the first
place."</TE>
<TE>   The process of making the 34-foot-long wings seems deceptively simple
and is little changed from the way sail boards are made. Instead of using
several tooling machines, foam material is poured into a single, large
molding block. All the electric wiring and other components are then
molded together into the one-piece foam core.</TE>
<TE>   After curing, the core is wrapped in composite fibers and then placed
back into the mold and is cured with resin to form the wing's skin. There
is no bonding, welding or riveting of materials as required with
composite or traditional aluminum wings.</TE>
<TE>   As such, the process, which Sherwood patented, takes about one day, a
far cry from the several weeks it would take to construct a similar wing
out of composite materials or metals. Moreover, the wings have fewer
parts and don't require much labor, thus reducing cost. A single employee
can produce a wing in one day.</TE>
<TE>   "The process eliminates about 20 steps in the process of making a
wing, and it's lighter and stronger," Sherwood said. "It's pretty much
surfboard stuff but of higher quality. If you really think about it, a
wing is a surfboard."</TE>
<TE>   Boeing executives rave about Sherwood and Foam Matrix, which Boeing
discovered almost by accident. It's highly unusual for the world's
largest aerospace company, with nearly 200,000 employees, to deal
directly with such a tiny firm.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything so far has gone well," Bishop said. "Everything has been
up to snuff."</TE>
<TE>   The Boeing engineer who stumbled upon Foam Matrix was Ted Ralston, who
was working on the design of the unmanned aircraft while helping a crew
from public television's NOVA put together a segment on Easter Island.
Ralston was trying to figure out a way to replicate the 13-ton Moai
statues that line Easter Island and contacted Sherwood, who also helps
artists make materials out of foam. (The effort was separate from the
Styrofoam figures built for Hollywood studios that have generated
protests by Easter Islanders.)</TE>
<TE>   In working together on the project, Ralston learned that Sherwood had
begun doing some aerospace work, including making foam fins for Orbital
Sciences Inc.'s Pegasus rocket, and Ralston eventually asked Sherwood if
the company could develop a lightweight wing for the new aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   The foam wing was an ideal solution to an unusual requirement unique
to the UCAV, according to Boeing. The Pentagon wants an aircraft whose
wings can be removed from the fuselage, with the disassembled parts
capable of being stored in a container for up to 10 years. Because there
are few parts and neither moving components or hollow cavities, the wings
sustain less wear and tear while being transported or stored for lengthy
periods of time.</TE>
<TE>   Working with Boeing has led to other opportunities for Foam Matrix,
many of which the company can't disclose because they involve classified
programs.</TE>
<TE>   But one program could have immediate payoff. Foam Matrix is developing
new fins to go on the outside of engines of the C-17 military transport
plane. Boeing is looking at replacing the so-called engine nacelles,
which, when damaged, must be replaced with a new piece. Foam, on the
other hand, can be repaired, much like filling holes in a wall with
putty. The foam Sherwood uses is much stiffer and has higher strength
than consumer market foams, such as Styrofoam.</TE>
<TE>   Making wings for the X-45 represents the complete transformation of
the company from a sports equipment maker to an aerospace firm.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1990s, Sherwood decided to literally grow up. Declaring
that the company's motto would henceforth be "no more toys," he called a
halt to making surfboards, skateboards and sail boards.</TE>
<TE>   Overnight, Foam Matrix turned into an aerospace company. Its big break
came when Dick Rutan's Scaled Composites at Mojave Airport asked Sherwood
to make the fins for a rocket the company was developing.</TE>
<TE>   Foam Matrix hasn't completely severed its ties to the past. The
company's logo shows a surfer atop an aircraft and is emblazoned with
"UCAV surf team."</TE>
<TE>   And Sherwood, 60, still surfs in Malibu.</TE>

<HD>IRS Has Paid Millions in Illegal Slavery Credits</HD>
<DH>Taxes: The agency says the bogus filings have soared and it
mistakenly accepted some claims.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Internal Revenue Service, inundated with more than $2.7 billion
in illegal claims for slavery reparation payments, may have mistakenly
paid out as many as a couple of hundred of these claims last year, IRS
Commissioner Charles Rossotti told a congressional committee this week.</LD>
<LD>   The agency has seen an explosion of such claims for the reparations,
reflecting both widespread tax scams perpetrated on African American
taxpayers and sentiment that such reparations should be paid out by the
federal government. IRS offices have received tens of thousands of such
claims in recent years.</LD>
<LD>   Although it has caught most of those claims for tax credit, IRS
officials have paid out millions of dollars, Rossotti said. A published
report put the figure at $30 million.</LD>
<TE>   One IRS employee is under investigation for allegedly helping process
returns that claimed the credit, government sources confirmed Friday
night. Four current and eight former IRS employees also have applied for
the credit, government sources acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear Friday whether those IRS employees--largely low-level
workers--were aware that their claims were fraudulent, or whether they
also were taken in by a burgeoning cadre of promoters who have recently
stepped up efforts to market the idea that African Americans can take tax
credits for the value of "40 acres and a mule," a Civil War-era
reparation proposal that was vetoed by President Andrew Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly good people have been getting caught up in this scam," IRS
spokesman Terry Lemons said. "The IRS urges taxpayers to be careful when
promoters are peddling something that sounds too good to be true."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, the IRS enlisted Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson
(D-Texas), chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, to help get the
word out that these claims are not valid and can subject taxpayers to
fraudulent-filing penalties amounting to $500 per claim.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, the IRS had not levied this penalty unless a single
individual had submitted more than one slavery reparation claim. Starting
Monday, the penalty can be assessed against anyone who fails to withdraw
such a claim, Lemons said.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS previously has acknowledged that it has paid some of these
claims, but the Treasury oversight report was the first to indicate just
how significant the problem had become.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last two years, the IRS could have paid out as much as $30
million in these claims, which average more than $43,000 each, according
to the Treasury Department's inspector general for tax administration.
The figures, reported by the Washington Post, were contained in an audit
by the oversight office that reviews the tax agency.</TE>
<TE>   "I am genuinely stunned," said Philip J. Holthouse, partner at Los
Angeles tax law and accounting firm Holthouse Carlin &amp; Van Trigt. "At the
same time that they are trying to punish people for doing this, they were
writing checks. I would put this in the same category as the INS granting
[visa] extensions to the hijackers."</TE>
<TE>   Slavery reparation claims soared to 80,000 in 2001 from 13,700 the
previous year, the IRS said. In addition, the agency recently noted that
the scam was beginning to move into new groups--most notably Native
Americans, who filed about 200 such claims last year, agency officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   The agency believes that promoters are marketing these bogus claims
through advertisements and church groups.</TE>
<TE>   IRS officials declined to say exactly where on a federal tax return
individuals would claim a slavery reparation credit, concerned that would
encourage copycat claims.</TE>
<TE>   The promoters explain that a federal law was passed after the Civil
War to provide each former slave with 40 acres and a mule. The current
value of that grant was estimated at about $43,000. But the promoters'
pitch is only partly true. Congress did pass such a bill, but it was
vetoed and never made it into law.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, some members of the Congressional Black Caucus have
attempted to urge Congress to at least study the issue of reparations for
descendants of U.S. slaves, but they have not been successful in getting
any such bill out of committee hearings.</TE>
<TE>   The debate over reparations for slavery intensified in academic and
political circles in the aftermath of such compensation for Jewish
Holocaust victims and Japanese Americans who were internees during World
War II.</TE>
<TE>   Notably, the IRS said it will attempt to recover any improper refund
checks that it has sent out, with interest and penalties. The agency also
has prosecuted a host of promoters who promulgated these claims. The
penalties can be significant.</TE>
<TE>   One such promoter, Vernon T. James of Texas, for example, was
sentenced to more than six years in prison and ordered to pay $1.2
million in fines for preparing 10 returns that fraudulently claimed the
"black investment tax."</TE>

<HD>Guarding the Coast, and More</HD>
<DH>Already protecting 95,000 miles of shoreline, the smallest U.S.
military branch found itself on the homeland defense front lines after
Sept. 11.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OFF PORT EVERGLADES, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>Four miles out in the Atlantic Ocean, 6-foot waves are hammering
the pilot boat, slathering its windshield in foam and rocking it like a
roller coaster car. Petty Officer 2nd Class Jeremy Zimmer of the U.S.
Coast Guard is about to go to work, stepping into the unknown with only a
pistol to protect himself.</LD>
<LD>   The launch draws alongside Stena Clipper, a freighter arriving from
the Dominican Republic. A rope ladder dangles down 25 feet to the sea
from an open hatch in the rusting hull. Zimmer, a husky 27-year-old from
Ohio, is assigned to lead a boarding party up the swaying ladder and into
the ship. He wants to make sure it hasn't been commandeered by terrorists
and that a pilot can safely guide it into port.</LD>
<LD>   A smiling, mustachioed face peers down from the foreign vessel, but
Zimmer has no way of knowing what, or who, he will find once he's aboard.
"In the worst-case scenario," he says, pointing to the portable radio he
carries along with a 9-millimeter Beretta semiautomatic pistol, "we can
alert the station, and tell them we got a big problem here."</LD>
<TE>   Of all of the country's armed services, none in the last few months
has reoriented itself more speedily or radically than the Coast Guard.
Founded by the young republic to enforce tariffs and protect oceangoing
commerce, the Coast Guard today finds itself on the front lines of
homeland defense, charged with protecting the country's 95,000 miles of
shoreline, its ports and waterways.</TE>
<TE>   Now, when it comes to the prime mission, "the name says it pretty
much: Coast Guard," said Gabriel Gervais, 23, a petty officer 2nd class
from Bradenton, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   With the accent on keeping lives and property safe from terrorism,
assets and personnel are being diverted from more traditional duties such
as environmental protection and staunching the flow of cocaine, marijuana
and other illegal drugs into the country.</TE>
<TE>   According to Rep. Frank A. LoBiondo (R-N.J.), chairman of the House
subcommittee that oversees the agency, missions related to national
security--which once accounted for 2% of the service's budget--have been
gobbling up more than half the resources.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center
and the Pentagon, the smallest of the five branches of the military
already was stretched thin. Many of its ships and aircraft were aging,
with most small rescue craft deemed "not ready for sea" by inspectors.
"Coasties" stationed at small search and rescue stations were working an
average of 84 hours a week. For years, budgets had not kept pace with
mounting expenses.</TE>
<TE>   The Coast Guard, in the words of Adm. James M. Loy, the current
commandant, was like a knife "dulled by complacency and overuse."</TE>
<TE>   But the organization's ability to adapt quickly to changing demands is
a point of particular pride. Over more than two centuries, the Coast
Guard and its ancestors have pursued ships laden with contraband,
maintained lighthouses, chased Prohibition-era rumrunners, rescued
boaters in distress, enforced regulations on fishing and tried to halt
the inflow of illegal immigrants by sea.</TE>
<TE>   Today's commandant likes to paraphrase a congressman who declared, "If
the job is hard and wet, give it to the Coast Guard."</TE>
<TE>   That happened almost immediately Sept. 11, when Rear Adm. Richard E.
Bennis, Coast Guard captain of the port in New York, implemented a plan
to evacuate Manhattan by ship that, in terms of sheer numbers, dwarfed
the Royal Navy's rescue of the British Army at Dunkirk during World War
II.</TE>
<TE>   With New York's bridges and tunnels hurriedly closed after the attacks
on the twin towers, about half a million people were transported by a
motley flotilla of tugboats, ferries and other craft to the outer
boroughs and New Jersey. It was his single proudest moment in the Coast
Guard, said Loy, a 38-year veteran. But the flexibility and capacity for
quick reaction, he says, were typical of the service whose motto is
Semper Paratus--"Always Ready."</TE>
<TE>   At the Coast Guard Academy in New London, Conn., in the fall, a war
game was hurriedly put together to prepare future officers for new
threats. Data for the port of Los Angeles/Long Beach, the nation's
busiest, were entered into computers. An attack by terrorists using a
helicopter spewing poison gas and a commandeered tanker was simulated.
Senior cadets and officer candidates managed to keep the port open, but
the gas attack succeeded, and a Coast Guard cutter was sunk.</TE>
<TE>'A Lot of Adrenaline Moving'</TE>
<TE>   "I think we got a lot of adrenaline moving that morning," Lt. Cmdr.
Joe Vorbach, assistant professor of international relations, said of the
exercise. This semester at the academy, he is teaching a course on
terrorism, complete with readings from the Koran and information about
what differentiates mainstream Islam from its extremist offshoots.</TE>
<TE>   In a sense, the current focus mirrors the Coast Guard's origins in
uncertain times. In "The Federalist Papers," Alexander Hamilton suggested
that "a few armed vessels, judiciously stationed at the entrances of our
ports, might at small expense be made useful sentinels of the laws." In
1790, the Revenue-Marine, the agency's direct forerunner, was founded,
with no more than $10,000 authorized to build 10 ships.</TE>
<TE>   Since autumn, to better enable today's Coast Guard to serve as the
country's oceangoing sentinel, the Bush administration has requested $464
million in emergency funding. The service plans to double the amount of
resources devoted to port safety and security, and to add 5,000
active-duty personnel over the next three years in its largest uptick in
staffing since World World II. It now has 35,000 men and women on active
duty--fewer than the New York City Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   Simultaneously, the agency is in the throes of a modernization
program, begun before Sept. 11, to replace aging vessels and aircraft. By
some estimates, the Coast Guard possesses one of the six largest naval
armadas in the world, but is the 41st oldest. The average age of its
large ships is 28 years. Some cutters patrolling off Alaska date back to
World War II.</TE>
<TE>   "They, more than any other service, have been underfunded for
modernization and recapitalization, and are simply at the end of their
rope," said Daniel Goure, a military analyst and vice president of the
Lexington Institute, an Arlington, Va.-based public policy think tank.</TE>
<TE>   "They need more money, more manpower and more modern assets," LoBiondo
added.</TE>
<TE>   In the months after the attacks, the workweek for the men and women
based at the Coast Guard station at Fort Lauderdale, one of the agency's
largest and busiest, soared to as much as 120 hours. Time on the water
has doubled, Coasties stationed there said, and that leaves less time for
repairs and maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   Crews in 41-foot utility boats now escort Navy warships that call at
Port Everglades to and from the open sea. The aim is to prevent a repeat
of the Oct. 12, 2000, suicide bombing in the harbor of Aden, Yemen, that
crippled the guided missile destroyer Cole and killed 17 of its crew.</TE>
<TE>   Protecting ports from dangers that might be posed by inbound shipping
also has become a priority. That is why armed Coast Guard sea marshals
regularly accompany pilots when they go aboard. "You can imagine what
would happen if a shipload of oil or natural gas blew up in New York
Harbor or near the New York or New Jersey shore," Goure said. "It would
be a near nuclear explosion."</TE>
<TE>   Once up Stena Clipper's ladder, Zimmer and the rest of the boarding
party are welcomed by the ship's Polish captain and first mate, who offer
them coffee and soft drinks. Accompanying pilot Cheryl Phipps, the armed
Coast Guardsmen take up stations on the bridge. The delicate chore of
maneuvering the 485-foot vessel from the open sea to a dock at Port
Everglades can now begin. In the last seven months, under the largest
port security operation since World War II, the Coast Guard has sent sea
marshals onto more than 2,000 vessels; 6,000 ships have been escorted in
and out of port, and more than 35,000 port security patrols and 3,500 air
patrols have been conducted.</TE>
<TE>Cruise Ships See Beefed-Up Security</TE>
<TE>   So far, "it looks like the terrorists haven't been using the maritime
mode to transport either weapons of mass destruction or terrorists," said
Capt. Tony Regalbuto, acting director of port security at Coast Guard
headquarters in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   However, the case of the man they have nicknamed "Container Bob" still
is very much on the minds of Coast Guard officials. In October, Italian
police opened a cargo container on a Canada-bound ship arriving from
Egypt and arrested a 43-year-old suspected Al Qaeda member found inside.
Reports at the time said the container was equipped with a bed, toilet
and provisions for a long voyage. The suspect was carrying a laptop
computer, two cell phones, a Canadian passport and documents identifying
him as a certified airplane mechanic.</TE>
<TE>   "Container Bob," whose real name was Riizak Amid Farid, disappeared
while free on bail.</TE>
<TE>   At the Port of Miami, the Coast Guard also is overseeing beefed-up
security measures imposed since Sept. 11 on the cruise ships that
regularly set sail for the Bahamas, Puerto Rico and other island
destinations. Every piece of passenger luggage is X-rayed and food and
other supplies are screened by dogs before being loaded.</TE>
<TE>   "Now all provisions going into a ship are sniffed for explosives and
weapons, from lettuce to cantaloupes to Christmas trees," said Lt. Steve
Lang, 39, port security supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, other areas traditionally under the Coast Guard's purview
have suffered. In February, Rear Adm. Jay Carmichael, commander of the
7th Coast Guard District--which encompasses the southeastern United
States, Puerto Rico and the Caribbean--disclosed that monitoring of
fisheries had dropped by 80%, and narcotics interdiction and the policing
of marine polluters also had waned.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a process over time to define a new normalcy for us,"
Carmichael told a meeting of the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy in St.
Petersburg, Fla. That means finding the right formula in a changing world
for the parceling out of ships and people.</TE>
<TE>   "We really cannot allow them to forgo any of their missions," LoBiondo
said. "They can do it all if they have the resources."</TE>
<TE>   To better protect the nation from attack by sea, the Coast Guard now
demands 96 hours' notice, instead of 24, from arriving merchant vessels.
But the web of protection is hardly perfect. Lists of crews and cargoes
are supposed to be faxed to a Coast Guard office in Martinsburg, W.Va.,
so they can be checked.</TE>
<TE>   At the moment, Coast Guard personnel must punch in the names on the
manifests, a time-consuming process subject to typographical errors.
Moreover, the government lacks a central database of suspected
terrorists, so the Coast Guard must also pass along its lists to the FBI
and other agencies for vetting.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a problem, because we want to screen 100% of the people,"
Regalbuto said. The Coast Guard's solution is to require arriving ships
by September to e-mail the information to Martinsburg, so the names of
people aboard can be shared instantly with all federal agencies involved
in homeland defense.</TE>
<TE>   The still unsolved problem that particularly concerns Loy is container
traffic: 17 million of the big metal boxes arrive in the United States
each year, 6 million by sea. According to Coast Guard estimates, fewer
than 2% of those are examined. In a nightmare scenario that the nation's
defense planners must take into account, one of the opaque boxes easily
could house a nuclear bomb or other weapon of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe this to be the single biggest black hole we have," Loy
said. The Coast Guard has some strike teams equipped to handle chemical
or biological emergencies, the admiral said, but it lacks the capability
to detect the nuclear arms that Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist
network reportedly has been trying to acquire.</TE>
<TE>   "What can we attach to a crane that offloads containers from a ship,
so it turns yellow or starts squeaking" in the presence of radiation, Loy
asked rhetorically. Other ideas being studied, the admiral said, include
devices to continuously track them by satellite and sensors that would
detect a box tampered with in transit.</TE>
<TE>   At Miami's port, amid what looks like a jumbled, multicolored mountain
range of children's giant building blocks, Petty Officer 2nd Class Joseph
McCoy already is on the lookout for hazardous materials transported
inside containers. "After Sept. 11, we went into a full-fledged mode of,
'We're here all the time,' " said McCoy, 30, of San Bernardino.</TE>
<TE>   One recent morning, the petty officer and members of his team, wearing
blue overalls, grabbed their white safety helmets and bolt cutters to
crack open a gray, 20-foot container that was festooned with cautionary
signs reading "Toxic," and "Corrosive." Documents accompanying the box
showed it contained nitric, sulfuric and hydrochloric acids, as well as
other dangerous chemicals. When the Coasties opened the container,
plywood sheets came tumbling out, and cartons inside looked like they had
been badly jumbled in transit.</TE>
<TE>   "That's two violations," McCoy said: lack of proper blocking and
bracing of cargo, and the mixing of flammable agents and oxidizing
chemicals in the same container.</TE>
<TE>Security, Commerce Kept in Perspective</TE>
<TE>   In all that it does, the Coast Guard must juggle the imperatives of
national security with the vital necessity of keeping the sea lanes open
for business. About 95% of U.S. overseas trade moves by water, and "the
very last thing we want to see is some slowdown in commerce," Loy said.</TE>
<TE>   Under a new national maritime security plan, the Coast Guard wants to
assess the degree of vulnerability to terrorist attack of each of the
country's 361 ports, so authorities can better develop countermeasures
tailored to each. In this age of enhanced risk, container terminal owners
and others in the private sector also have been alerted that they are
expected to do and spend more to make their installations secure.</TE>
<TE>   Coasties, who like to speak of the country's seaboard as the nation's
longest frontier, admit that their assignment of keeping it secure will
be a colossal, long-term task.</TE>
<TE>   At Port Everglades, Petty Officer 3rd Class Travis Stone gazed one
recent afternoon at a Danish freighter offloading containers and wondered
what they might conceal.</TE>
<TE>   "And that's just one ship," the 26-year-old Georgian said. "They come
in and out every day like that."</TE>

<DH>S. America: Military arrests Chavez and names a businessman interim
leader.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR TOBAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela
</DL>
<LD>Hugo Chavez resigned as president and was placed under arrest by
his former military allies Friday, after his charismatic reign as
Venezuela's nationalist strongman came crashing down in a flurry of
protest and violence.</LD>
<LD>   The military and its civilian allies named a 35-member "government of
democratic transition" to run the country, headed by a prominent
businessman and top Chavez critic. Pedro Carmona, the leader of
Venezuela's largest business association, became interim president.</LD>
<LD>   Carmona promised to hold elections within a year to choose a new
president for this oil-rich but economically troubled South American
nation. The new ruling council announced a major overhaul of Venezuela's
government, including the immediate firing of all members of the
pro-Chavez National Assembly and Supreme Court.</LD>
<TE>   "We must go about returning to the rule of law," Carmona, 60, told
supporters after taking the oath of office at the presidential palace.
"Strongman rule will be left behind. I will act in the most open manner,
working with all sectors of the country."</TE>
<TE>   The measures amounted to a counterrevolution, led primarily by the
nation's business sector, to the highly personalized state that Chavez
built in the three years since becoming president. The former paratrooper
allied Venezuela with Fidel Castro's Cuba, espoused a fiery populist
rhetoric and encouraged the growth of a cult of personality.</TE>
<TE>   In a major shift in foreign policy, Carmona's government also said the
state-owned oil company would discontinue Chavez's controversial oil
sales to the Communist regime in Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   Cuban Foreign Relations Minister Felipe Perez Roque said that his
country still recognized Chavez as president and that the overthrow was
illegal.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez's supporters at home and abroad called the events in Venezuela
a coup. Chavez, who led a failed coup 10 years ago as a lieutenant
colonel, has not spoken in public since his last, defiant speech to the
Venezuelan people Thursday afternoon, in which he said he would not step
down.</TE>
<TE>   In Caracas, the capital, Atty. Gen. Isaias Rodriguez said he had not
seen evidence that Chavez had resigned.</TE>
<TE>   "Why don't they allow him to be interviewed?" Rodriguez asked. "Did he
commit a crime? Is resigning a crime?"</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez called the Carmona government "unconstitutional." A few
hours later, Carmona announced that Rodriguez had been relieved of his
duties.</TE>
<TE>   Even the name of the country was changed Friday. Chavez fancied
himself the true heir to the mantle of Simon Bolivar, the 19th century
independence leader, and had renamed the country the Bolivarian Republic
of Venezuela. The new government announced, to loud cheers from its
supporters in the palace, that the nation would once again be called,
simply, the Republic of Venezuela.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer declared the
Bush administration's support for new elections in Venezuela and
condemned the actions of Chavez's government against protesters that left
at least 14 people dead and more than 200 wounded Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "According to the best information we have, the government suppressed
what was a peaceful demonstration of the people," Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   Several Latin American leaders, however, were critical of the new
government. In Costa Rica, leaders at the summit of the 19-nation Rio
Group of Latin American countries criticized "the interruption of
constitutional order" in Venezuela.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican President Vicente Fox said his country would not recognize
Carmona's government until new elections were held, although he said it
wouldn't sever diplomatic relations.</TE>
<TE>   The streets of Caracas were calm Friday, a day after tens of thousands
of people marched on the presidential palace to demand Chavez's
resignation. Some witnesses said snipers positioned on rooftops had fired
on the anti-Chavez protesters.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez could face charges in the protesters' deaths. Still, he
retained the support of an untold number of Venezuelans, especially among
the poor. On Friday evening, the mood remained tense.</TE>
<TE>   "How can it be that our president, the man we chose to lead us, is
rotting in a jail cell?" said one of dozens of pro-Chavez callers to
Faith and Happiness, a religious radio station.</TE>
<TE>   "We repudiate, we hate what has happened," another caller said. "A
group of military men has stabbed our president in the back."</TE>
<TE>   Chavez is a cult hero to many impoverished Venezuelans, even though in
the final months of his presidency he implemented tough economic policies
demanded by the International Monetary Fund and sharply reduced
government spending.</TE>
<TE>   There were reports of violent protests Friday evening in some poor
neighborhoods of the capital.</TE>
<TE>   In a ceremony before Carmona was officially sworn into office, the
members of the new government took pains to give his administration a
veneer of legitimacy, scheduling legislative elections for December.</TE>
<TE>   The new leaders cited a long list of crimes committed by Chavez's
regime, including "an illegal concentration and usurpation of powers,"
the suppression of free speech and a foreign policy of "isolation" that
harmed the Venezuelan economy.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the military turned against Chavez on Thursday after the
bloodshed near the presidential palace and after Chavez moved to shut
down all the nation's private television stations.</TE>
<TE>   After being taken from the palace before dawn Friday, Chavez was being
held in an army base.</TE>
<TE>   "He is not being held in any cell," army Gen. Rommel Fuenmayor said.
"He is in a secure place being guarded by people of extreme confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Fuenmayor added that, in the final hours of his rule, while
negotiating his resignation with military officers, Chavez asked to be
allowed to leave Venezuela and flee to Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   Several of Chavez's political allies and high-ranking members of his
government were arrested Friday, including Ramon Rodriguez Chacin, who is
both interior and justice minister.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez was detained by police in the city of Baruta.</TE>
<TE>   "He surrendered without any resistance," Henrique Capriles, the mayor
of Baruta, told a local radio station. "He knew there was nothing he
could do."</TE>
<TE>   A pro-Chavez provincial governor, Ronald Blanco of Tachira, was
detained after refusing to recognize Carmona as president. Two generals
took him into custody at the provincial government offices and brought
him by plane to the same military facility where Chavez was being held.</TE>
<TE>   Venezuelan television also showed images of police raiding homes and
wrestling with Chavez supporters. They were reportedly searching for the
leaders of the "Bolivarian circles," pro-Chavez muscle groups that are
suspected in the repression of Thursday's march.</TE>
<TE>   A large anti-Chavez crowd formed outside the Cuban Embassy after
rumors spread that at least two pro-Chavez legislators and the vice
president were seeking refuge inside. Diplomatic sources later denied the
rumors. The crowd lingered, however, and at one point it cut off water
and electricity to the embassy.</TE>

<HD>Mahony Regrets Transfer of Priest</HD>

<LD>Cardinal Roger M. Mahony said Friday he erred when he transferred a
priest accused of molesting children to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center about
14 years ago without telling hospital officials about the allegations.</LD>
<LD>   In his first public comments on a sex abuse case involving the Los
Angeles Archdiocese, Mahony said he never should have assigned Father
Michael Wempe to Cedars-Sinai without informing hospital officials that
he had removed Wempe from his parish and ordered him to a New Mexico
treatment facility for evaluation and counseling.</LD>
<LD>   After the treatment, Mahony said, he was told Wempe could be trusted
to work as a priest if he were in a supervised job without access to
children. Mahony said he was told Wempe could serve in a prison or a
hospital.</LD>
<TE>   When he assigned Wempe to Cedars-Sinai, Mahony said, he did not know
it had a pediatric unit.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that was a mistake on our part then to not simply tell them
of his background," Mahony told The Times. "That should have been done. I
take responsibility for that."</TE>
<TE>   In retrospect, Mahony said, he should have forced Wempe to immediately
resign after hearing of the abuse allegations. "Fourteen years [later] is
so different," said Mahony, who has headed the L.A. Archdiocese since
1985. "If that had been today, he would have been out of the priesthood."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said he did not report Wempe's abuse allegations to police at
the time. He assigned Wempe to Cedars-Sinai, where he worked from 1988
until last month, when Mahony forced him to retire under his recent "zero
tolerance" policy against maintaining abusers in the church.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said he recently gave Wempe's name to the Los Angeles Police
Department to review past allegations against him.</TE>
<TE>   Wempe, 62, could not be reached for comment Friday. He had been living
at a church parish attached to a school south of Hancock Park, according
to a parish directory and interviews, but has since moved to Seal Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Cedars-Sinai officials said they learned Friday about past allegations
against Wempe. Grace Cheng, spokeswoman for Cedars-Sinai, said officials
contacted the archdiocese earlier this week after inquiries from The
Times. Representatives of the archdiocese met Friday with top officials
of Cedars-Sinai.</TE>
<TE>   "There were absolutely no complaints or claims or any issues of
impropriety or misconduct" while Wempe was at the hospital, Cheng said.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital officials described Wempe as well-liked. Mahony said he
attended a luncheon in the chaplain's honor a couple of years ago. A
retirement party scheduled for this month was canceled at Wempe's
request, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "To the best of our knowledge . . . this particular priest was
functioning very well and effectively," Mahony said. "As far as we know,
there was never a hint" of any impropriety at the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, two brothers, now grown, filed a lawsuit in Orange
County Superior Court alleging they had been sexually abused by Wempe
from about 1976 to 1985. The suit also names the archdiocese, alleging
that senior priests knew--or should have known--of Wempe's misconduct but
failed to intervene.</TE>
<TE>Brothers Say Transfers Didn't Stop the Abuse</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Friday with their attorney present, Mark and Lee
Bashforth, who asked that their names be published, said the abuse began
in a Ventura County parish and continued as Wempe was transferred to
other area churches. Both men said they only recently remembered the
abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "I was 8 or 9 years old and I am staying in the rectory in his room
overnight, where there is only one bed," said Lee Bashforth, 32.</TE>
<TE>   Archdiocese officials had not seen the lawsuit and would not comment
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said he believed a therapist Wempe saw in 1987 reported the
case to authorities, but the cardinal was not certain. A source with
knowledge of the case said allegations about Wempe were reported to the
archdiocese in 1987 or 1988.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Archdiocese is among a number of Roman Catholic
ministries enmeshed in the widening sex abuse scandal. Recent and
decades-old accusations of abuse by priests and others affiliated with
the church began drawing national attention after highly-publicized cases
in Boston earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   The Times reported in March that six to 12 priests had been dismissed
by Mahony in February for past sexual abuse of minors. Mahony, under
growing pressure to reveal details about the cases, would say only that
"a few" priests, almost all of them retired, were involved.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Mahony continued to refuse to name priests accused of
sexual abuse, repeating earlier statements that he has been asked by two
victims not to divulge the priests' names.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, however, Mahony clarified the number of known sex
abuse cases. He said seven cases allegedly occurred before 1997, four in
the last five years and another four were connected to priests who have
since left the ministry and cannot be found. There were also a smaller
group of allegedly abusive priests who are now dead, Mahony said.</TE>
<TE>   In a 90-minute interview, conducted Friday afternoon in the residence
receiving room of the new downtown cathedral, Mahony said the cases
"gnaw" at him. He said he has trouble sleeping when he thinks about the
victims.</TE>
<TE>   "I keep reaffirming my own pledge to do everything in my power to make
sure no one is harmed by the church," Mahony said. "That's what keeps me
up at night: real sadness, sorrow, devastation."</TE>
<TE>Priest Was Trusted Friend of the Family</TE>
<TE>   Mark Bashforth said that Wempe, who was a trusted family friend, began
molesting him when he was 12. Then Wempe turned his attentions to Lee,
who was 8, the brothers claim. They allege they were molested on
overnight trips and during other activities.</TE>
<TE>   Lee Bashforth said he recalled the abuse, which he had suppressed from
his memory, about a month ago, watching coverage of the growing sex
scandal. He said he had allowed Wempe to help officiate at his wedding
ceremony last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you think I'd let him anywhere near my wedding, if I had
remembered?" Lee said.</TE>
<TE>   After recalling the abuse, Lee Bashforth said, he called Mark, 39, and
they began to sob together on the telephone.</TE>
<TE>   "Because it such a traumatic memory, the mind does not let you recall
these things," Mark Bashforth said. "[Wempe] gave a blessing in Lee's
wedding ceremony. He did that knowing what he had done to my brother. How
could he carry on this charade?"</TE>
<TE>   R. Richard Farnell, a Newport Beach attorney representing the
brothers, said Wempe had a history of abuse that was ignored by the
archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   "The church concealed the truth about this priest for decades, moving
him from parish to parish, without any thought for the children," Farnell
said. "There are going to be other victims out there. A pedophile does
not just do this once."</TE>

<HD>Death of Reformer May Gain Her Goal</HD>
<DH>Corruption: Inquiry into the slaying of a Mexican city councilwoman
might lead to a cleanup of local government.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ATIZAPAN, Mexico
</DL>
<LD>When she joined the city council in August 2000, Maria de los
Angeles Tames already suspected that her hometown was corrupt. But her
parents and prosecutors say she had no idea the corruption was so
pervasive--or that it would one day kill her.</LD>
<LD>   The 27-year-old attorney, the politically mature daughter of a former
federal senator from the National Action Party, didn't plan to be a
crusader in this Mexico City suburb, her parents said. She just wanted to
make a difference.</LD>
<LD>   But Tames uncovered indications of corruption in the city government
and police beyond anything she imagined. And the evidence led her to
suspect Mayor Juan Antonio Dominguez.</LD>
<TE>   She found evidence that bidding for city contracts was rigged, that
building permits were sold illicitly and that bars were paying police up
to $40,000 a year to ignore underage drinking, drug dealing and
prostitution.</TE>
<TE>   City administrators and police ignored the council's votes, including
one to halt construction of a beer warehouse in a residential zone.</TE>
<TE>   "She was more outraged than surprised when she learned of the
corruption," says her father, Pedro Tames, a former city administrator
who is now an executive at the Notimex news agency.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than look the other way, Tames became what other council
members described as the "reformist leader" on the council, while
gathering evidence that she told her family she would one day present to
prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   She never made it. On Sept. 5, 2001, about a week before she planned
to resign and go to prosecutors, she was shot five times with a
high-caliber weapon on the doorstep of her home. Investigators say the
evidence she collected led them to her suspected killers. It could end up
achieving her main goal: cleaning up city hall.</TE>
<TE>   This week, Dominguez and his former personal secretary, Daniel Garcia,
were charged with murder, extortion and fraud. They are in jail awaiting
trial. Four other suspects are under house arrest. Another five remain at
large, including four other members of the Garcia family, which
prosecutors describe as a city hall "mafia," and the alleged triggerman.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say their seven-month investigation confirms Tames'
suspicions. Though no one has been convicted, the investigation also
suggests how elected officials can bleed a city dry, and why it's no
accident that urban development in Mexico is so helter skelter.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the arrests, many close to the case fear that the violence
isn't over. Two other city council members, Virginia Ruiz and Claudia
Gutierrez, the city's human rights coordinator and prosecutors working on
the case all have been threatened.</TE>
<TE>   Tames had been active in politics since she was a teenager. After
going to law school, she told her parents that someday she wanted to be
elected to the federal chamber of deputies. Tames' interest in politics
was heightened by serving as an aide to her mother, Evangelina Perez
Zaragoza, during her year in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Tames' mother said in an interview Thursday that her daughter started
seeing trouble signs three months after joining the city council.</TE>
<TE>   The first indication was the city's direct purchase of $220,000 in
heavy machinery, which should have been put out for bid. Investigators
say the seller was a construction company that helped the mayor pay off
his mortgage.</TE>
<TE>   That led Tames to dig deeper into the city's contracting practices.
Investigators who spoke on condition of anonymity because of fears for
their safety said the winning bidders were usually cronies or relatives
of Dominguez or Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   Tames tried calling up or visiting the businesses that were listed as
losing bidders on city contracts, often finding that they didn't exist or
that the addresses were those of billiard parlors or private residences.
Some construction projects had special permits that had been approved by
Garcia and were not to be blocked, the investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   Then there were the many mysterious nighttime flights at the Atizapan
municipal airport that investigators think might have been used to
transport drugs. The airport's flight records have disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   Tames and other council members got Garcia fired in January 2001. But
her insistence that other Garcia family members in city hall also be
fired fell on deaf ears. Meanwhile, Garcia became a bitter enemy.</TE>
<TE>   At some point, her father said she began to sense her conversations
were being recorded because the mayor repeated specific words and phrases
back to her in conversation.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, investigators found a wiretap operation in a
building a few yards from city hall.</TE>
<TE>   "My daughter told me she knew it was going on when the day after a
telephone conversation in which another city councilwoman called the
mayor's wife a fool, the mayor called her to say that one thing he
wouldn't tolerate was disrespect toward his wife," said Pedro Tames.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks before she was killed, Tames met the mayor at a restaurant
in an adjacent Mexico City suburb, and the mayor asked her to stop
criticizing him in council meetings. According to her father, she told
him she would stop as soon as he gave her reason to stop.</TE>
<TE>   Although she never felt her life was in danger, she had decided to
quit the council and go to prosecutors with the evidence she had.</TE>
<TE>   "She wanted to put these people in jail," Pedro Tames said.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after 8 p.m. on Sept. 5, as she was opening the gate to her
parents' home, the councilwoman was shot five times by a gunman who
prosecutors charge was hired by Daniel Garcia's brother, Isaias. Four of
those shots were in the back, all from a distance of three feet or less.
Her body was found by her mother.</TE>

<HD>Russia Force Enters Gorge in Georgia</HD>
<DH>Europe: The former Soviet republic and U.N. officials reject
Moscow's assertion that the deployment is in line with a peacekeeping
accord.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>Russia sent a contingent of heavily armed troops deep into a
contested gorge in the former Soviet republic of Georgia on Friday in an
operation that threatened to escalate the conflict just as U.S. military
personnel are moving into the region.</LD>
<LD>   The operation was quickly condemned by Georgian officials and U.N.
observers. The Georgian military was placed on high alert, and commanders
were authorized to use live fire in the event of a confrontation.</LD>
<LD>   "A decision has been made to open fire in case of any uncoordinated
actions" by the Russians, Georgian Defense Minister David Tevzadze said.
"This decision has already been forwarded to commanders on site."</LD>
<TE>   Russian officials said they sent 78 peacekeepers into the upper part
of the Kodori Gorge to reestablish a checkpoint dismantled during an
upsurge in violence last autumn. They said the operation was authorized
under an agreement signed with Georgia last week renewing the mandate of
peacekeepers to patrol Abkhazia, a separatist region in western Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   Abkhazia, a former resort area on the Black Sea coast, has operated as
a de facto independent republic since it fought a war for independence
that ended in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, a force of almost 2,000 Russian peacekeepers has been
stationed there, and 109 U.N. observers have kept an eye on the tense
border zones. Georgia has repeatedly accused the Russian peacekeepers of
aiding and abetting the Abkhazian rebels.</TE>
<TE>   The Kodori Gorge is in a contested area between the two sides. It is
ethnically Abkhazian and is traditionally considered part of Abkhazia,
but officially it is in the Georgian zone of control. As part of the
agreement last week, Georgian troops withdrew from the area to permit
U.N.-monitored peacekeepers to patrol.</TE>
<TE>   The peacekeepers are formally under the aegis of the Commonwealth of
Independent States, a political grouping of former Soviet republics. But
in practice, they are mostly from Russia and are commanded by Russian
officers.</TE>
<TE>   "It is our duty to monitor and control the withdrawal of regular
military units of both sides from the Kodori Gorge, as well as to patrol
the entire area of the Kodori Gorge on a regular basis in compliance with
the Tbilisi protocol of April 2, 2002," said Igor Konashenkov, spokesman
for the CIS peacekeepers. "This is the mission that we have arrived here
on."</TE>
<TE>   But Georgian and U.N. officials said the operation violated last
week's agreement. Pakistani Maj. Gen. Anis A. Bajwa, the head of the U.N.
observer mission, said he had warned the Russian peacekeepers of that in
advance.</TE>
<TE>   "It is to my total surprise, therefore, that the CIS [peacekeeping
force] decided to undertake the establishment of this checkpoint
immediately in an aggressive and combative manner, which is against the
norms of peacekeeping," the general said in a statement. "I strongly urge
the leadership of the CIS to immediately withdraw and act only in a
manner mutually agreed and acceptable to all parties."</TE>
<TE>   Television footage of the peacekeepers showed them wearing
robin's-egg-blue helmets. Under U.N. regulations, the CIS peacekeepers
are not supposed to wear U.N.-style blue helmets because they are not
official U.N. peacekeepers.</TE>
<TE>   The United States is preparing to deploy military trainers in the
region to help Georgia better control two lawless mountainous areas: the
Kodori Gorge and the Pankisi Gorge, which borders the separatist Russian
region of Chechnya. The Americans were originally scheduled to arrive
last month, but preparations are still under way and no official arrival
date has been set.</TE>
<TE>   Russia has complained vociferously that Georgia has failed to control
the Kodori Gorge. After a group of Chechen fighters allegedly took refuge
there last year, warplanes and helicopters bombed several villages.
Georgia accused Russia of bombing its territory; Russia denied the
charge.</TE>
<TE>   In a sign of alarm over the new escalation in tension, Georgian
President Eduard A. Shevardnadze flew to the gorge Friday to negotiate
with the Russian commander; he returned to Tbilisi, the Georgian capital,
in the evening, saying he had received a pledge that they would withdraw.</TE>
<TE>   "I have issued an ultimatum--the contingent deployed in [Kodori]
should be withdrawn," Shevardnadze said. "It is clear that it is
impossible to do it at nighttime. But they have got all day tomorrow at
their disposal."</TE>
<TE>   However, Russian news agencies reported late Friday that the Russian
Defense Ministry refused to confirm that such a pledge had been made.</TE>
<TE>   "These issues will now be solved at a higher level," said Maj. Gen.
Alexander Yevteyev, commander of the Russian peacekeepers.</TE>

<HD>German Chancellor Denies That He Dyes</HD>
<DH>Europe: Schroeder insists his dark-brown locks are natural, but
critics have used the controversy to assail his credibility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN
</DL>
<LD>Does he or doesn't he?</LD>
<LD>   Whether German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder dyes his dark-brown hair
may be something only his hairdresser knows for sure, but it's now a
question the whole country is talking about.</LD>
<LD>   His lawyer appeared in court Friday to seek an injunction against a
news agency to prevent it from repeating a political image-maker's
observation that the 58-year-old Schroeder "would be more credible if he
didn't dye his hair."</LD>
<TE>   Armed with an affidavit from Schroeder's barber that the chancellor's
chestnut locks are natural, lawyer Michael Nesselhauf told journalists
outside the Hamburg state court that the false charge amounts to
defamation.</TE>
<TE>   But even if Schroeder's legal challenge prevails when the court rules
May 17, it might be a Pyrrhic victory.</TE>
<TE>   Political commentators have cast the controversy as a sign of
insecurity on the chancellor's part, and Schroeder's conservative
opposition has already seized on the follicle affair with gusto.</TE>
<TE>   "How the Chancellor colors things," charges a campaign mailing from
the youth arm of the Christian Democratic Union, which supports
Schroeder's challenger, the white-haired Bavarian Gov. Edmund Stoiber, in
September elections.</TE>
<TE>   The folded card, delivered to 700 press office mailboxes in Berlin,
depicts the dark-coiffed Schroeder and a bottle of "Chancellor Tone" hair
dye labeled "rosy red"--alluding to his left-of-center leanings. The card
also contained a packet of black-cherry coloring from the Wella company.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder's crowning glory came into question in January, when the DDP
news agency distributed an article containing the quote about the
chancellor's credibility issue from image consultant Sabine Schwind von
Egelstein. The agency issued a correction after the chancellery
complained, but subscribing news media are under no obligation to publish
the retraction or refrain from repeating the consultant's claim.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Christian Democratic lawmaker Karl-Josef Laumann alluded to
the issue in his comment before parliament that "a chancellor who colors
up his hair will also color up the statistics." He was referring to a
recent debate about inflated figures for government retraining programs
for unemployed Germans, who now number more than 4 million and present
Schroeder with his biggest election-year headache.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder's hairstylist, Udo Walz, who also counts models Claudia
Schiffer and Naomi Campbell among his clientele, told journalists that he
considered the tempest over Schroeder's hair color to be a sign that
Germans have few real problems.</TE>
<TE>   "If you had the opportunity to get as close to his head as I do, you
would see that he does have gray hairs," Walz said outside the packed the
Hamburg courtroom where he appeared for what proved to be a 10-minute
proceeding.</TE>
<TE>   Political analysts criticized Schroeder for making an issue of the
image-maker's allegation.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have expected a bit more self-confidence from him. Schroeder
himself is the one who has the most to lose in all this," Peter Hahne of
ZDF television observed during a live broadcast on Hit Radio FFH during
which the program's host had his own hair dyed.</TE>
<TE>   DDP's lawyer, Klaus Sedelmeier, argued that it was not the
responsibility of the media to prove or disprove the veracity of comments
made by its interview subjects and that agency journalists fulfilled
their responsibility by distributing the chancellery's claim that the dye
contention is untrue.</TE>
<TE>   If the court rules against the agency, it is prepared to take the
matter to a higher court, Sedelmeier insisted, suggesting that the hair
affair could become a recurring theme on the campaign trail.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the conservatives are taking maximum advantage of the color
issue, not just regarding Schroeder's hair but also the signature colors
associated with each political party in Germany. Schroeder's Social
Democrats are identified with red, while the Christian Democrats invoke
black as their symbol.</TE>
<TE>   "Vote black," the youth arm's mailing says. "That way your hair won't
be standing on end."</TE>

parliament approved a law allowing extraditions to a Hague war crimes

<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>In recent years, the U.S. government has celebrated the march of
democracy up and down the hemisphere, often declaring that with the sole
exception of Cuba, every government in the region has been democratically
elected.</LD>
<LD>   Yet U.S. officials shed no tears Friday at news that the regime of
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez had been toppled overnight in a
distinctly undemocratic fashion.</LD>
<LD>   In four years in office, the boastful former army colonel was fast
becoming as much of an irritant to U.S. officials as Cuban President
Fidel Castro, whom he emulated. The populist authoritarian threatened
vital U.S. oil supplies, challenged the American campaigns against
terrorism and drug trafficking, and stood in the way of U.S. efforts to
build a hemispheric free-trade area.</LD>
<TE>   Thus, even before the nature of the new Venezuelan regime was clear,
experts were calling Chavez's removal from office a victory for the U.S.
government.</TE>
<TE>   "Across the board, the next regime will be more favorable to the
interests of this administration," predicted Julia Sweig, deputy director
for Latin American studies at the Council on Foreign Relations think tank
in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials were trying not to crow, yet they made
clear their disapproval of the fallen government. They pointed out that
Chavez had gagged the media and banned constitutionally protected
demonstrations while allowing his supporters to kill or injure more than
200 protesters.</TE>
<TE>   "Undemocratic actions committed or encouraged by the Chavez
administration provoked yesterday's crisis," the State Department said in
a statement. Officials noted that the transitional government has
promised elections and said they were confident that the crisis would be
resolved "peacefully and democratically."</TE>
<TE>   At the core of the United States' concern is Venezuelan oil.</TE>
<TE>   With the largest reserves outside the Middle East, Venezuela is the
third-largest oil supplier to the United States, providing about 15% of
its stocks. The country is relatively close to refineries in Texas and
Louisiana and for many years has cranked out its heavy crude in volumes
that have held down prices globally.</TE>
<TE>   But Chavez has sought to change that. With a new nationalist fervor,
he lowered production in an effort to raise prices. Chavez also
politicized the national oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, by
installing cronies in top management, reversing a decade-long
professionalization of the company.</TE>
<TE>   The mounting protests against Chavez in recent days included strikes
by oil workers that drastically slowed exports, sending oil prices
sharply higher. The shortfall has worried the White House, given the
simultaneous strains on prices from violence in the Middle East and a
temporary export embargo imposed by Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   World oil markets reacted quickly to Chavez's ouster. Prices fell more
than 6% on Friday, and analysts predicted that the change in regimes
would help lower prices for a long time to come.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez also made oil exports a part of his relationship with
Castro--another source of friction with the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Venezuela has recently been supplying Cuba with about 53,000 barrels
of oil a day, or half the island nation's total supply, and at discount
prices. Chavez styled his own regime as a revolutionary government akin
to Castro's, and he spoke up for Cuba at international gatherings.</TE>
<TE>   But Friday, officials of the Venezuelan oil monopoly said exports to
Cuba would be stopped.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to send a single barrel of oil to Cuba," Edgar
Paredes, an oil executive, told cheering employees at a news conference
in the capital, Caracas.</TE>
<TE>   Further complicating matters, the United States and Venezuela seemed
headed for a collision over Venezuela's alleged support for the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.</TE>
<TE>   According to reports, hundreds of FARC guerrillas have sought
sanctuary from Colombian government troops in western Venezuela. The Bush
administration has recently sought congressional approval to broaden its
military aid to Colombia to fight the rebels.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez also stood in the Bush administration's way by refusing to
allow U.S. government aircraft gathering intelligence on drug operations
to fly over Venezuela.</TE>
<TE>   He annoyed U.S. officials in October by denouncing American bombing
raids on Afghanistan, saying the United States was "fighting terror with
terror."</TE>
<TE>   And Chavez has sought to obstruct the U.S. government's effort to set
up a hemispheric free-trade area by aiming to create a rival trade
organization.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials have generally been cautious in comments about Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Johnson, a Latin American specialist at the Heritage Foundation
think tank in Washington, said the reticence of U.S. officials might have
been "a pretty astute policy. There was no war of words, and he was held
up to his own record."</TE>
<TE>   But experts say that U.S. and other Western Hemisphere leaders must
now deal with a potentially troublesome diplomatic question: Was Chavez's
ouster a coup?</TE>
<TE>   Both U.S. law and an international agreement signed last year by
members of the Organization of American States require sanctions against
governments that come to power in a coup.</TE>
<TE>   The ouster was not the act of a power-hungry minority, since it was
supported by the military, business, unions, the Roman Catholic Church
and the news media. Yet if Western leaders overlook the fact that the
overthrow might have been counter to the Venezuelan Constitution, they
could send a message to military leaders in other countries that coups
are acceptable, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials said privately Friday that, given the broad
support for Chavez's ouster, the White House was not likely to classify
it as a coup.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, "if the response here is a wink and a nod, what kind of signal
does that send to, for example, Argentina?" asked Sweig.</TE>
<TE>   "It is awkward," said Viron P. Vaky, a former U.S. ambassador to
Venezuela. "We don't want people thinking, 'This is a way to get this
done.' "</TE>

<HD>Turf Fighting Flares Near Afghan Capital</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ALA SANG, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Factional fighting erupted Friday in the hills just west of Kabul,
the capital, the latest in a series of Afghan power struggles ahead of a
planned national council that will choose a new government.</LD>
<LD>   Mortars flashed from the rocky hillsides and Kalashnikov rifle fire
crackled in the valley 25 miles west of the capital in the battle that
began early Friday. Gen. Zafar Uddin moved into the area to take control
of checkpoints maintained by a local leader who has designs on the
governorship of Wardak province, according to Uddin's fighters and
government officials.</LD>
<LD>   At least 100 men loyal to the local leader, who uses the single name
Nangialai, mounted a fierce resistance using antitank rockets, mortars
and Kalashnikovs, the officials said. By sunset, Uddin's 500 men had
advanced about three miles, capturing two villages and four checkpoints,
but they still faced heavy fighting.</LD>
<TE>   Zapto Alokozai, a senior federal police official who visited the
region Friday, said in Kabul that six of Uddin's men were killed and two
of Nangialai's were wounded.</TE>
<TE>   But Uddin said that there were no deaths and that only one of
Nangialai's men was wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Uddin, surveying the battle from a hilltop position with two dozen of
his men, said he expected the fighting to drag on because he had little
backup. He called Nangialai a former Taliban leader who was using caches
of Taliban arms to destabilize the interim government.</TE>
<TE>   Uddin said he had the full backing of the Defense Ministry, and he
appealed for more international aid for the government. But Alokozai, the
police official, said Uddin is also allied with a former prime minister
whom the government accuses of trying to destabilize its regime.</TE>
<TE>   The fighting served as a stark reminder of the task facing interim
Prime Minister Hamid Karzai as he seeks to consolidate authority ahead of
a loya jirga, or grand council, that will choose a new government in
June.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, U.S. Special Forces troops discovered more ammunition
caches and captured several suspected Al Qaeda members in southeastern
Afghanistan, a U.S. military spokesman said. He refused to give details.</TE>

<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>A powerful earthquake struck northern Afghanistan for the third
time in less than two months Friday, flattening a village and killing
dozens of people.</LD>
<LD>   Citing the Interior Ministry, state television said the quake killed
at least 50 people and injured about 150 in three villages in the rugged
Hindu Kush mountains, not far from the epicenter of a March 25 quake that
killed as many as 1,000 people.</LD>
<LD>   Aid workers said most of the casualties Friday were in Doabi, a
village of about 3,000 people 90 miles north of Kabul, the capital. "Not
a single house is standing there," said Fahrana Faruqi, a United Nations
official.</LD>
<TE>   The 8:30 a.m. quake had a magnitude of 5.8, according to the National
Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's quake was the third deadly temblor to hit northern
Afghanistan in six weeks. A magnitude 7.2 quake that struck in the same
area of the Hindu Kush on March 3, killing more than 100 people, was the
strongest to hit the region since 1983.</TE>

<HD>A Young Woman and a Bomb on a Beautiful Spring Day</HD>
<DH>Scene: At Jerusalem's integrated Mahane Yehuda market, Israelis
were unusually upbeat just before suicide attack No. 110.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>The Mahane Yehuda market on Jaffa Street is always crowded before
Shabbat, the Jewish Sabbath, and the mood there Friday afternoon was
unusually upbeat for an anxious city living with the drumbeat of war and
the danger of suicide bombers.</LD>
<LD>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell was in town, and however slim his
chances were of arranging a cease-fire, his mere presence gave the
Israelis' spirits a boost. The day was springlike--sunny and 75 degrees.
The battlefront news, from the Israeli perspective, was good, with the
military reporting that it was securing the Jenin refugee camp in the
West Bank after an eight-day battle.</LD>
<LD>   Ehud Olmert, the mayor of Jerusalem, stopped at the market's deli, as
he does most Fridays, to buy challah, a special Shabbat bread. Shimon
Iluz bumped into his brother, and they stopped to chat in a doorway near
the market. Eli Sheva, a Michigan-born resident of Jerusalem, looked at
the vegetables on one vendor's cart and thought about how much she
enjoyed Mahane Yehuda on Fridays and seeing Arabs and Israelis mix and
get along fine.</LD>
<TE>   A young woman, reportedly from the Jenin camp, also was on Jaffa
Street on Friday, but she wasn't there for pleasure. Tentatively
identified as Nidal Daraghmeh, she had explosives under her dress. She
started to enter the market but apparently was unnerved by the sight of
security at each entrance. So she turned and joined a queue of about 30
people awaiting the No. 6 bus to the neighborhood of Talpiot.</TE>
<TE>   The driver, Awadallah Hussein, an Israeli Arab, came to a stop. As he
opened the door, Daraghmeh blew herself up. The explosion was so
powerful, car windows a block away were shattered. Six people died, in
addition to the bomber, and as many as 80 were wounded, including
Hussein. It was, Israeli authorities said, the 110th suicide attack
against the Jewish state in the last 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, Jaffa Street, a main thoroughfare, was in panic. Shoppers
ran screaming for cover. A woman's head lay outside the deli. Arms and
legs were strewn about, resting on the sidewalk among potatoes and
melons. Broken glass and plastic shopping bags and shredded paper
littered the street. And once again, the wail of sirens filled the air,
as did calls for help.</TE>
<TE>   "I admit my first thought was, 'How do you bring Powell here--not so
he can see the dead, but so he can see those who survived?' " said
Olmert, the mayor, who had just crossed the street and gotten into his
car when the blast went off.</TE>
<TE>   "How do you bring him here so that he can see their fear and anxiety,
so that finally everyone may understand what cannot be seen from
thousands of kilometers away? For them, this is a political problem. But
for us, this is our life, and it gets harder from one attack to the next.
I no longer know what to say to the shocked residents of the city."</TE>
<TE>   "I had just greeted the mayor with 'Shabbat shalom,' " Iluz said.
"Then this huge blast shook everything. The body of the bomber--at least
I think it was hers--flew into the air and landed on my brother and I. It
was a miracle we survived."</TE>
<TE>   Sheva, the Israeli American, ran to help the walking wounded. Later,
clutching a bloodied scarf, she said: "I believe the bomber belongs right
where she went--in hell. There was no peace process before, and there
isn't one now. There is war. I can't tell you how lovely this market is,
when people are getting murdered here."</TE>
<TE>   A senior aide to Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat,
Mohammed Dahlan, the security chief in the Gaza Strip, said he believed
that the bombing was in response to the Israeli military offensive in the
West Bank and not related to Powell's trip. He reiterated the Palestinian
Authority's stated position that attacks on civilians on either side is
wrong.</TE>
<TE>   The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, an offshoot of Arafat's mainstream Fatah
movement, claimed responsibility for the attack. The militia has been at
the forefront of planning and executing the suicide attacks that gave
rise to the Israeli offensive. The Israeli campaign hit hard at the Jenin
camp, viewing it as a nest of militants: The woman who blew herself up
Friday was just the latest of a long string of bombers from there.</TE>
<TE>   How much control Arafat exercises over the group is a point of debate,
but the Palestinian leader is eager to meet Powell, and it seemed
unlikely that he would approve an attack that has led to the delay, if
not the cancellation, of that meeting.</TE>
<TE>   The suicide attacks have brought fear and a sense of vulnerability
more intense than anything Israelis have felt for years.</TE>
<TE>   "Why doesn't the international community realize we are victims?" Odi
Steinberger, 23, said as he watched emergency workers don gloves and pick
up brown plastic bags used for the collection of body parts.</TE>
<TE>   'For us, this is our life, and it gets harder from one attack to the
next.'</TE>

<HD>Controversy Over Israeli Plan to Bury Camp Dead</HD>
<DH>West Bank: Palestinian survivors accuse the army of trying to hide
the bodies of civilians slain at Jenin.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JENIN, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>With smoke still rising from the ruins of a quieted urban
battlefield, Israel's army provoked a bloodless but bitter skirmish
Friday by moving to collect and bury the bodies of Palestinian gunmen
killed as it occupied Jenin's refugee camp.</LD>
<LD>   Announcement of the impending burials caused anxiety among Palestinian
survivors as they wandered the bleak landscape on foot, searching
desperately for husbands, sons and cousins still missing in the aftermath
of the eight-day assault. The news stirred fresh allegations, denied by
Israel, that the army killed hundreds of civilians here and is trying to
hide the bodies.</LD>
<LD>   Israel's chief justice, Aharon Barak, ordered a temporary halt to the
burial plan late Friday. He scheduled a Sunday hearing of the full
Supreme Court on a motion by Mohammed Baraka, an Arab member of the
Knesset, Israel's parliament.</LD>
<TE>   Baraka joined leaders of Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority in
accusing Israel of war crimes. "We want to make sure that those
responsible for crimes in the camp won't be able to hide the evidence,"
the lawmaker said.</TE>
<TE>   What will happen to the dead is one of several lingering questions
about the West Bank's bloodiest battle since the 1967 Middle East War. A
day after Israel said it subdued the last resistance by gunmen inside the
camp, no one is certain how many Palestinians died, how many of them fell
in battle and how many were unarmed civilians.</TE>
<TE>   But it was clear that the fierce fighting here will make Jenin a
powerful symbol of the wider Israeli-Palestinian conflict for years to
come.</TE>
<TE>   To Israel, Jenin was the chief breeding ground of the suicide bombers
who carried out a string of bloody attacks in Israel last month. The
attacks prompted the army to invade Palestinian-ruled cities of the West
Bank starting March 29 in an effort to root out what Israeli leaders call
a "terrorist infrastructure."</TE>
<TE>   Subduing the camp's fighters cost Israel the lives of 23 soldiers,
including 13 killed this week in an explosion.</TE>
<TE>   Brig. Gen. Eyal Shlein, commander of Israeli forces in Jenin, said
soldiers cleaning up after the battle Thursday discovered the bodies of
three key militants who had directed suicide attacks--Jamal Akhuil, head
of the military wing of Fatah, Arafat's political movement; and Thabet
Mardawi and Ali Safuri of the Islamic Jihad organization.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians seized upon Jenin as a symbol of resistance and
martyrdom--a moral victory in which as few as 200 gunmen held out more
than a week against an arsenal of tanks and helicopter gunships.</TE>
<TE>   In the Gaza Strip, hundreds of people demonstrated Friday to
commemorate the gunmen who died fighting in the camp. Doctors in Gaza
City said three babies born in the last three days have been named Jenin.</TE>
<TE>   More ominously, Palestinians saw Friday's suicide bombing in
Jerusalem, which killed six Israelis, as revenge for the assault on the
refugee camp.</TE>
<TE>   "In military terms, the Israelis did not achieve their goal" to stop
suicide bombings, said Assad Hashash, a 37-year-old medic who watched the
fighting from the top of his three-story home just across a road from the
camp's western perimeter. "People who never thought about doing anything
against the Jews are now going to try to do something because of what
they have seen here."</TE>
<TE>   As Hashash spoke, black smoke rose from deep inside the
half-square-mile camp. Most of the densely packed community's multistory
cinder-block houses were still standing, but many bore battle
scars--gaping holes left by tank rounds, scorched walls, shattered
windows. Scattered homes were flattened.</TE>
<TE>   Tanks and armored personnel carriers rumbled along all the camp's
perimeter roads, chasing away journalists who tried to get in.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the camp's 13,000 residents fled during the fighting,
especially from homes in the center, which took the heaviest pounding
from tanks and attack helicopters. Hundreds of people are believed to be
still in the camp, but reporters who stood at the western edge Friday saw
no one.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, nobody is moving inside the camp and nobody knows
what's inside the camp," said Guy Siri, a Frenchman who is deputy
director of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which oversees
aid programs inside Palestinian refugee camps.</TE>
<TE>   "The living conditions are just incredible," he said. "They have been
without food, without water, without anything. The handful of people who
moved out of the camp today had been drinking sewage water just to keep
their throats moist."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli army spokesman Brig. Gen. Ron Kitrey said soldiers were
collecting bodies Friday, separating those of armed men from those of
civilians.</TE>
<TE>   He said the gunmen would be buried in unmarked graves in a special
cemetery in the Israeli-controlled part of the Jordan Valley. The
cemetery is in a field where Lebanese fighters killed in cross-border
clashes have been buried in graves marked only by numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "The civilians we will try to give back to the Palestinians," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Al Jazeera, the Qatar-based Arabic-language television network, quoted
witnesses Friday as saying Israeli army trucks had already taken out some
bodies Friday. The army would not confirm the report.</TE>
<TE>   Kitrey said "apparently hundreds" of Palestinians died in the camp,
but his office later clarified that he was referring to casualties--dead
and wounded--and "there is no clear number of those killed."</TE>
<TE>   Some Palestinian officials have spoken of 400 to 500 dead. The
Palestinian Red Crescent Society said it had no way to verify any
estimates because the Israeli military has not permitted relief agencies
or medical teams to enter the camp.</TE>
<TE>   "They want to hide their crimes, the bodies of the little children and
women," said Saeb Erekat, a Palestinian Authority Cabinet official. He
said he would insist that visiting U.S. Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell, who was due to meet with Arafat, tour the camp.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officers insist that most of the dead were armed militants and
that they took care to avoid harming innocents.</TE>
<TE>   "We went one house at a time," said an Israeli tank commander at a
checkpoint near Jenin. "Another army, like the American army, you saw
what they did in Afghanistan. They just bombed, and that's it. We went in
one by one in the houses, so as not to kill civilians."</TE>
<TE>   But Palestinian survivors, other witnesses and doctors in Jenin said
the civilian death toll was heavy. They said helicopter gunships and
tanks fired into scores of homes to drive people out, even when there had
been no firing at the army.</TE>
<TE>   Hashash said he saw two unarmed Palestinians, including a 70-year-old
man seated in front of his home, killed by sniper fire.</TE>
<TE>   Along the steep, rugged dirt roads outside the camp Friday, scores of
Palestinians walked in search of shelter in nearby villages.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know where our husbands are," said Rabia Nijel, 29, who was
walking with two other women and four small children. "The Israelis took
us out of our houses. They brought their guns and their dogs, and they
made us leave our houses. They beat our husbands in front of us and took
them away. We haven't seen them for three days."</TE>
<TE>   "Later they told the women and children we could leave, go wherever
you want, but don't come back here."</TE>

<HD>Annan Calls for Cease-Fire Monitors</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Proposal seeks an international force backed by but
operating independently of the U.N. in the Palestinian territories.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS
</DL>
<LD>In a reflection of deepening concern here about the specter of a
widening Middle East war, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged the
Security Council on Friday to authorize an international force to oversee
a cease-fire in the Palestinian territories.</LD>
<LD>   "The situation is so dangerous and the humanitarian and human rights
situation so appalling," Annan said from the U.N. offices in Geneva, that
outside military intervention "can no longer be deferred."</LD>
<LD>   A few hours later, Annan's top political deputy in New York briefed
the Security Council on the proposal in a closed-door session. U.N.
officials said Annan envisioned a well-armed multinational force endorsed
by but operating independently of the U.N., as in Afghanistan, with one
nation volunteering to organize and command the troops.</LD>
<TE>   "I am talking about a force that will help create a secure environment
to allow for assistance, to allow us to be able to end the killing and
give us time for negotiations and diplomacy," the secretary-general said.</TE>
<TE>   According to people who attended Friday's session, the proposal was
received with surprise and caution by the Security Council, which has
been deliberating renewed requests from Arab nations for a U.N.
monitoring mission in the Middle East--an idea staunchly resisted by
Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Annan, normally careful and even deferential in his dealings with the
council concerning the region, has been under intense and growing
pressure to speak out within the U.N., senior officials here said, as
Israeli troops have occupied and in some cases destroyed parts of U.N.
refugee settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   American diplomats here, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they
needed more details of Annan's proposal but wanted Secretary of State
Colin L. Powell's mission in the region to remain the immediate Mideast
diplomatic focus.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even if Powell secured a truce, recent history suggests that the
Israelis and Palestinians on their own would be unable or unwilling to
maintain it, Annan said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that when one considers the situation and the attitude of the
parties--the enmity and distrust are so deep--that even when you come up
with agreements, cease-fire and all that, you need a referee, a third
party," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Powell said after meetings with Arab leaders on his way to Jerusalem
this week that Washington would be willing to provide monitors to
supervise a cease-fire, but Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and
other administration officials have opposed deployment of U.S. troops in
Israel and the Palestinian territories.</TE>
<TE>   Other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization might be more
willing to undertake such a deployment. Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien has said that his nation would consider contributing troops, and
European Union leaders also have voiced tentative support for the
introduction of foreign troops if a cease-fire can be negotiated.</TE>
<TE>   Evoking memories of Bosnia-Herzegovina, where thousands of unarmed
civilians died in the 1990s before international forces intervened,
Annan's chief spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said the secretary-general "felt
that something new--something bold--had to be considered by the Security
Council" before the Mideast explodes into wider war.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a reaction to the carnage that is taking place--that we cannot
remain neutral as people are being killed on both sides from one day to
the next," Eckhard told reporters here.</TE>
<TE>   Annan issued his call for the international force shortly before a
suicide bombing Friday in Jerusalem. In a statement issued after the
blast, he expressed his "utter condemnation of such attacks against
Israeli civilians as morally repugnant."</TE>
<TE>   There was concern among diplomats here that the attack could sabotage
Powell's cease-fire mission and increase pressure on the U.N. from the
Arab world and elsewhere to intervene more forcefully in the conflict.
Annan was expected to return to New York over the weekend to further
discuss the peacekeeping proposal with diplomats here.</TE>
<TE>   Before Friday's bombing, U.N. officials had been focusing largely on
what they termed the "humanitarian emergency" in West Bank cities and
refugee camps occupied or recently occupied by Israeli troops.</TE>
<TE>   At a U.N. refugee camp in Jenin, the scene of some of the bloodiest
recent fighting between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian militias, U.N.
relief officials were again barred from entering Friday, Eckhard
reported.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian representatives to the U.N. are demanding an official U.N.
inquiry into this week's Israeli operation in Jenin, which the Israeli
army estimated left hundreds of Palestinians and 13 Israeli soldiers
dead.</TE>
<TE>   Asma Jahangir, a U.N. human rights officer with jurisdiction over
"extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions," called Friday for an
investigation of allegations that Israeli forces killed unarmed civilians
in the Jenin camp.</TE>
<TE>   "If the government of Israel continues to deny access, it will only
lend further credibility to the allegations made by independent sources,"
Jahangir said.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Robinson, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, asked
Israel last week for permission to conduct an investigative mission in
the region with Felipe Gonzalez, the former prime minister of Spain, and
Cyril Ramaphosa, a leading South African political figure. Israel has not
yet responded to the request, U.N. officials said.</TE>
<TE>   A year-old blueprint by former Sen. George J. Mitchell (D-Maine) for a
cessation of hostilities--a plan tentatively endorsed by Israel and the
Palestinian Authority, as well as by the United States and the United
Nations--stressed that a foreign monitoring force would be feasible only
if both sides supported its presence.</TE>
<TE>   Annan and other U.N. officials acknowledged Friday that a peacekeeping
mission would require both Israeli and Palestinian assent.</TE>
<TE>   "I would hope that both parties see the wisdom in accepting
third-party support," Annan said in Geneva. "It is patently obvious that
the parties left to themselves cannot resolve this issue."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Says Arafat Must Call for an End to Suicide Attacks</HD>
<DH>Conflict: The latest deadly bombing in Israel won't deter Bush from
seeking peace, the White House tells reporters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The White House responded to the latest suicide bombing in Israel
on Friday by saying the violence made it "a particularly apt day" for
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat to call for an end to such
attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The Palestinian Authority "needs to renounce [violence] and renounce
it soon," White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said. Late Friday in
Jerusalem, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell called off his meeting for
today with Arafat in the wake of the attack, which killed six people in
addition to the bomber.</LD>
<LD>   As the United States continued trying to arrange a cease-fire and
begin political talks between the warring parties, Fleischer expressed no
opinions on the documents that Israel contends link Arafat and other
Palestinian officials to the string of suicide bombings that have killed
scores of Israelis.</LD>
<TE>   "Appropriate government agencies" are reviewing the documents,
Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. intelligence agencies have reached no conclusions yet as to the
credibility of the documents, which Israel said it seized from Arafat's
headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking at them," a U.S. official said Friday. "But we really
don't know at this point."</TE>
<TE>   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said an Israeli
official distributed the documents to several U.S. government agencies in
Washington this week.</TE>
<TE>   "They're trying to tie people in positions of leadership in the
[Palestinian] security forces to the terrorist network," he said. "These
are some of the people we've dealt with, all parties have dealt with.</TE>
<TE>   "They're trying to make the case that even the security officials, who
were relied upon to bring security to the situation, were unreliable
partners."</TE>
<TE>   At the White House, President Bush learned of Friday's suicide bombing
as he convened an early-morning national security meeting.</TE>
<TE>   A short time later, Fleischer told reporters at his daily briefing:
"The president condemns this morning's homicide bombing in Jerusalem.
There are clearly people in the region who want to disrupt Secretary
Powell's peace mission. And the president will not be deterred from
seeking peace."</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer downplayed a fund-raising telethon for Palestinians that was
organized by the Saudi government.</TE>
<TE>   "According to the information that we have about the telethon, and the
assurances that we have received from the Saudi government, the money is
raised to help with the broader humanitarian needs of the Palestinian
people--something the United States is committed to," Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   By late Friday, the telethon had raised more than $92 million for the
Palestinians. The telethon was expected to continue today.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The White House has added a new term to its Middle East
descriptions: "homicide bombing."</LD>
<LD>   That's how White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer has begun
referring to bombing attacks in Israel, including Friday's, in which a
woman detonated explosives she was wearing, killing herself and six other
people at an outdoor market.</LD>
<LD>   "The president condemns this morning's homicide bombing," Fleischer
said.</LD>
<TE>   When asked why he used the term, Fleischer replied that it better
captures the nature of the violence.</TE>
<TE>   "These are not suicide bombings. These are not people who kill just
themselves," Fleischer said. "These are people who deliberately go to
murder others, with no regard to the values of their own life. These are
murderers."</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>PARIS
</DL>
<LD>Members of a Jewish amateur soccer team have been attacked in the
first organized anti-Semitic assault since Israel's offensive against
Palestinians in the West Bank triggered a sharp rise in attacks on Jewish
sites in France.</LD>
<LD>   About 15 hooded attackers wielding sticks and metal bars beat up
several members of the soccer team during a training session late
Wednesday in Bondy, a racially mixed suburb northeast of Paris.</LD>
<LD>   A 15-year-old goalkeeper, who was severely beaten, said members of the
gang shouted racial insults.</LD>
<TE>   "This marks a turning in anti-Semitic acts which seems to be more
serious because it wasn't a chance encounter," said Patrick Gaubert, head
of the anti-racist group LICRA.</TE>
<TE>   President Jacques Chirac has condemned the violence, which has ranged
from vandalism to graffiti to Molotov cocktail strikes.</TE>
<TE>   Police have stepped up patrols at potential targets, including
synagogues, schools and community centers, but in most cases they have
failed to catch the assailants.</TE>
<TE>   Though most of the attacks remain unsolved, many in France, including
Muslim leaders, accept a link with the mounting violence in the Middle
East. But Muslim representatives said it would be wrong to put all the
blame on members of their community.</TE>
<TE>   The Union of Islamic Organizations of France this week condemned the
acts of violence.</TE>

<HD>Abuse Cases Exist, Mexico Bishops Say</HD>
<DH>Religion: 'We are not angels,' a conference official says, adding
that a lack of data, not secrecy, keeps the issue quiet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<AU>RAFAEL AGUIRRE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY
</DL>
<LD>Roman Catholic bishops meeting at an annual church conference in a
suburb of this capital city acknowledged this week that some Mexican
clergy members had committed child abuse, but they could not provide any
numbers. One insisted that the clergy's "dirty laundry would best be
washed at home."</LD>
<LD>   Jose Guadalupe Martin Rabago, the bishop of Leon and vice president of
the Mexican Bishops Conference, said at a news conference Wednesday that
cases do exist.</LD>
<LD>   "We are not angels. We live in an environment in which this problem
exists," Martin Rabago said. He said it's not that the church is
unwilling to disclose the cases, it's that "we simply do not have the
data."</LD>
<TE>   The bishop of Jalapa, Sergio Obeso, said Thursday that any such cases
would be analyzed in-house before being made public. But invoking the
"dirty laundry" phrase, he said he was inclined to keep such cases under
wraps.</TE>
<TE>   Questions about possible abuses involving Mexican priests arose
frequently at news conferences given by the bishops during their annual
conference, which ran from Monday through Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is topical because of the scandals in several Roman Catholic
dioceses in the United States involving church cover-ups of child abuse
cases, including some involving repeat offenders who were merely
transferred to other parishes.</TE>
<TE>   Roberto Blancarte, a professor and church expert at the Colegio de
Mexico here, said the cultural pressures that have kept cases quiet are
probably stronger in Mexico than in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "Here in Mexico, people seem to just keep silent about the whole
subject," Blancarte said.</TE>
<TE>   Some bishops defended keeping such cases out of public view, with
Bishop Renato Ascencio Leon of Ciudad Juarez saying they are best handled
by applying canonical law, under which the maximum penalty would be
expulsion from the church. Only if the civil authorities find out about
specific abuse should civil law apply, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not our duty to hand over our sons to civil authorities. A
father would never hand over his son," Ascencio Leon said.</TE>
<TE>   But Blancarte said evading the civil process is "totally illegal and
irresponsible."</TE>
<TE>   "This may be a sin in the church, but it is a crime in the state,"
Blancarte said. "There is no reason they can hide someone who has
committed a crime as serious as sexual abuse of children."</TE>
<TE>   The professor said such an attitude is a holdover from the 19th
century, when the Mexican clergy had special immunity from civil laws.
Such exemptions ended with Mexico's constitutional reforms of the 1850s.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS
</DL>
<LD>Talks slated for this month between Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji
Sabri and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan have been postponed at
Baghdad's request, Annan's spokesman said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Iraq sought the delay because it didn't want to distract attention
from the crisis in the Middle East, Annan spokesman Fred Eckhard said.</LD>
<LD>   The talks had been scheduled for next week in New York. No new date
has been scheduled.</LD>
<TE>   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Mohammed Douri, said he expected the delay
would be short, perhaps only until month's end.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to divert public attention from the Palestinian problem
for a relatively small issue of a dialogue with the United Nations," he
told Reuters.</TE>
<TE>   Annan and Sabri met March 7, their first high-level talks in a year.
Annan has said he hoped the new talks would focus on the return of U.N.
weapons inspectors to Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Baghdad is under sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council for
its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, and they cannot be lifted until inspectors
certify that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction have been eliminated.</TE>

<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>Opening arguments in the trial of four men accused in the
kidnapping and slaying of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl were
postponed for more than a week, attorneys for both sides said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Chief prosecutor Raja Qureshi said the delay was to meet legal
requirements for trying in absentia seven other suspects who remain at
large. Journalists were again barred from the half-hour proceeding, which
took place inside Karachi's central jail.</LD>
<LD>   British-born Islamic militant Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh, 28, and three
co-defendants are in custody, charged with murder, kidnapping and
terrorism. They face the death penalty if convicted.</LD>
<TE>   During the session, Judge Arshad Noor Khan scheduled the entering of
pleas and opening statements for April 22 after police said they could
not find the seven other suspects, Qureshi said.</TE>
<TE>   Khan formally declared them fugitives, paving the way for them to be
tried in absentia along with the four others. However, Pakistani law
requires a delay of at least a week before proceedings against the seven
can be started.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl disappeared Jan. 23 on his way to meet an Islamic militant
contact, allegedly Sheikh.</TE>
<TE>   A videotape received by U.S. diplomats in Pakistan on Feb. 21
confirmed that Pearl, 38, was dead.</TE>

<LD>U.S. soldiers posed for photos with Taliban fighter John Walker
Lindh, who was handcuffed and wearing a blindfold with an obscenity
written across it, Pentagon officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The disclosure could help support his attorney's claims that Lindh was
mistreated while in U.S. custody.</LD>
<LD>   It is at least the third troublesome incident for the Department of
Defense involving photos of Lindh, a 21-year-old Californian who is
accused of training with Al Qaeda terrorists and is charged with
conspiring to kill Americans.</LD>
<TE>   In a court motion, his lawyers have said that unofficial photos and
videos of Lindh were taken aboard the amphibious assault ship Peleliu
while he was confined on the Navy vessel.</TE>
<TE>   The photos troops took of themselves with their prisoner were found
when the Pentagon did a computer search for documents and other materials
ordered by the court, an official said.</TE>

<HD>First Family Reports $711,453 in Income</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush and First Lady Laura Bush reported a net taxable
income of $711,453 for 2001 and paid $250,221 in federal income taxes,
according to their joint tax return. The document was released by the
White House on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The bottom line for the couple was similar to their 2000 return, when
they had a net taxable income of $744,682 and paid $240,342 in federal
income taxes.</LD>
<LD>   The Bushes' 2001 return shows they had a short-term capital loss in
investments of $91,360. That was partially offset by a long-term capital
gain of $55,126, thus creating a $36,234 net loss.</LD>
<TE>   The losses were not fully specified, but some likely involved setbacks
in the stock or bond markets, or both, according to Philip J. Holthouse,
a certified public accountant and partner in the Los Angeles-area firm of
Holthouse Carlin &amp; Van Trigt, who reviewed the return for The Times.</TE>
<TE>   The return did show some losses related to the sale several years ago
of Bush's share in the Texas Rangers baseball team.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's 2001 income included most of the $400,000 salary for the
presidency (he took office Jan. 20), salary he earned as Texas governor
in 2000 but was not paid until 2001, and investment income from blind
trusts in which his and Mrs. Bush's assets are held.</TE>
<TE>   The couple's return also showed they contributed $82,700 to churches
and various charitable organizations, including Sept. 11-related funds,
Southern Methodist University in Dallas (Mrs. Bush's alma mater) and the
Evergreen Chapel at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland's
Catoctin Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, the Bushes reported $143,300 in charitable contributions,
including $75,000 the president had earned in royalties from his
autobiography. The return further showed the couple paid $18,823 in
property taxes, likely on their 1,600-acre Prairie Chapel ranch near
Crawford, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Like an increasing number of taxpayers, the Bushes declined, as they
did last year, to designate $3 of their tax money to help finance
presidential elections.</TE>
<TE>   The first couple did not sign their return; instead, it was signed,
under power of attorney, by a vice president of the Northern Trust Co. of
Chicago, acting as their trustee.</TE>
<TE>   The tax returns for Vice President Dick Cheney and his wife, Lynne,
are to be released Monday, according to a spokeswoman for the vice
president.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the couple reported an adjusted gross income of $36 million
for 2000 and paid more than $14 million in federal taxes.</TE>
<TE>   The vice president's wage and salary income had included $806,332 in
salary and $4,333,500 in deferred compensation and bonuses from
Halliburton Co., the energy services firm where he was chief executive
officer until he resigned Aug. 16, 2000, to become Bush's running mate.</TE>

<HD>Missions to Pluto, Europa Canceled</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>USHA LEE McFARLING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NASA's on-again, off-again mission to Pluto appears to be off, at
least for now. And a JPL mission to Jupiter's watery moon
Europa--considered the most likely spot for extraterrestrial life--also
has been canceled for budget reasons.</LD>
<LD>   Top NASA officials said Friday it was highly unlikely that a mission
to Pluto would launch by 2006--the final date set by scientists to be
able to reach the planet in time to study its atmosphere before it
becomes inaccessible for a century. The Europa mission was canceled after
its projected cost more than doubled.</LD>
<LD>   Though a darling of schoolchildren and a long-elusive target of
scientists, a Pluto expedition is not favored by the White House. For the
second year in a row, the administration budget has included no money to
explore the distant world.</LD>
<TE>   Last year, Congress added $30 million to NASA's budget to develop
plans for a Pluto mission after a flood of letters and calls from
distraught children and concerned citizens. But this year, scientists at
the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore
were refused the $122 million they say is necessary to continue
developing a $500-million mission.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Congress again restores funding at the last minute, the
unmanned mission faces two significant hurdles, said Chris Scolese,
NASA's deputy associate administrator for space science.</TE>
<TE>   It has yet to be proved, he said, that the distant mission is
feasible. In addition, the use of plutonium in the spacecraft, to power
its instruments, remains controversial.</TE>
<TE>   In other spacecraft, including Cassini, which is bound for Saturn, it
has generally taken about eight years to receive permission to use
plutonium, Scolese said. Opponents of using the radioactive material fear
contamination from a spacecraft accidentally returning to Earth; NASA
says the plutonium is well shielded, minimizing any risk.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the mission is scheduled to leave Earth aboard a new
rocket--either a Boeing Delta IV or a Lockheed Martin Atlas V. Both
rockets have yet to take their maiden voyage; NASA officials would want
the rockets to be well proved before using them to launch spacecraft.</TE>
<TE>Life on Europa Thought Possible</TE>
<TE>   The mission to Europa was canceled after its $650-million budget
swelled to $1.4 billion. The mission could compete for funding in the new
NASA budget if its cost is trimmed back to $650 million. But scientists
think it is unlikely that they could conduct an effective mission to
probe the icy moon's subsurface oceans for traces of life for less than
$1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the staff working on the Europa mission at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory--80 to 90 people--are continuing to work on a new generation
of faster, smaller radiation-hardened electronics that were part of the
project and will now be used to improve future missions. Others have been
redeployed to work on a Mars rover project. Lab officials said the move
resulted in no layoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Planetary scientists and those in favor of exploration are angered by
NASA's move. Reaching Pluto and Europa is among the top priorities for
solar system exploration. Pluto was considered especially urgent because
it is entering a distant, colder part of its elliptical orbit. This means
the atmosphere will freeze completely and could be unavailable for study
for roughly 100 years.</TE>
<TE>   Lou Friedman, executive director of the Planetary Society, called the
decisions shortsighted and called them the equivalent of "recalling the
fleet."</TE>
<TE>   Colleen Hartman, who directs solar system exploration for NASA, said
it may still be possible to reach Pluto and Europa in the near future as
technologies such as nuclear propulsion evolve. "We're doing things now
that seemed impossible five years ago," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Hartman was also awaiting a survey, done once a decade by the National
Academy of Sciences and due out in August, that will set priorities among
scientific goals for planetary exploration. A strong push to get to Pluto
or Europa from the respected organization could resurrect funding for the
projects.</TE>

<HD>Law Makes It Clear He Won't Resign</HD>
<DH>Church: The cardinal's letter is in response to disclosures he
approved the transfer of a pedophile priest from Boston to California.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON
</DL>
<LD>A defiant Cardinal Bernard Law on Friday vowed to remain archbishop
of Boston "as long as God gives me the opportunity."</LD>
<LD>   Rebuffing calls for his resignation in the wake of the sexual abuse
scandal shaking the church, the country's senior Roman Catholic prelate
declared in a letter addressed to "my dear brother priests"--the 650 who
serve in his archdiocese--that he has no plans to step down.</LD>
<LD>   The letter issued Friday morning was Law's first comment after
disclosures Monday that he had approved the transfer of a pedophile
priest from Boston to Southern California.</LD>
<TE>   Responding to reams of documents from the archdiocese's own files that
showed Father Paul Shanley had advocated sex between men and
boys--stating at one point that "when adults have sex with children, the
children seduce them"--the cardinal wrote:</TE>
<TE>   "The case of Father Paul Shanley is particularly troubling for us. For
me personally, it has brought home with painful clarity how inadequate
our record-keeping has been."</TE>
<TE>   Outside the cardinal's residence late Friday, spokeswoman Donna M.
Morrissey would not elaborate on Law's comments.</TE>
<TE>   But she stressed that his two-page letter was aimed only at fellow
priests.</TE>
<TE>   "The letter is not an answer to the question: 'Will he resign?' " she
said. But she added: "The letter is pretty clear that he is going to
continue as archbishop as long as God gives him the resources to do so."</TE>
<TE>   More than once, Morrissey had to strain to be heard above the sounds
of drivers honking their horns as they passed the chancery. The motorists
were responding to protesters holding signs reading: "Honk if you want
Law to go."</TE>
<TE>   Joe Gallagher, owner of a decorator supply company and organizer of a
group called Coalition for Concerned Catholics, was holding a sign
reading, "Go directly to jail."</TE>
<TE>   Of Law's letter, Gallagher said: "I am extremely disappointed. Instead
of spending the week trying to figure out some compassionate way to
respond to victims, he apparently has spent the week hunkered down in his
bunker, trying to figure out how to hang onto his power."</TE>
<TE>   Gallagher described himself as a devout, practicing Catholic. He said
he had not lost his faith, but felt "really quite puzzled" about his
church.</TE>
<TE>   "I have six kids," he said. "They say to me, 'Dad, what the heck are
you doing in that church? Would you belong to a country club that treated
people that way?' "</TE>
<TE>   But C.J. Doyle, executive director of the Catholic Action League here,
said he came to the chancery Friday to defend his cardinal.</TE>
<TE>   "I am pleased," Doyle said of Law's announcement that he will not
renounce his job. "This is an issue for the pope. It is not up to the
bottom feeders of the media." Only the pope has the power within the
church to remove a cardinal.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't judge this by secular standards. He is not our CEO. He is
our father," Doyle said.</TE>
<TE>   Morrissey said the cardinal had spent the week in private meetings
with other clerics and with victims of sexual abuse by priests.</TE>
<TE>   "He is also reflecting, and spending a great deal of time in prayer,"
she said. "He derives his strength from prayer. He asked for your prayers
too."</TE>
<TE>   Morrissey would not comment about whether Law had been in touch with
the Vatican during the week, and said she was "not privy to" information
about whether Law had submitted his resignation.</TE>
<TE>   "The cardinal is clearly very concerned," Morrissey said. "Clearly,
when he hears people have lost trust in his leadership, that is
troubling."</TE>
<TE>   But, she said, "he does not believe he has lost his moral authority."</TE>
<TE>   With donations to diocesan charities down since the scandal escalated,
Morrissey said, the cardinal was dealing with the financial effects of
the problem "one day at a time."</TE>
<TE>   "A word needs to be said. There are a great number of people who are
in pain," Morrissey added. "But it is time that we take a deep breath.
This is not a story that is going to end today or tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Her assurances were of scant consolation to Terry McKiernan, a writer
and a member of a Catholic group formed in January called Voice of the
Faithful. McKiernan also found little comfort in Law's letter.</TE>
<TE>   "Under cover of communicating with priests, he tells us he plans to
keep his job," McKiernan said. "He really has to resign. The Shanley
documents make it clear that he had knowledge of [pedophile priests] at
every turn. He knowingly sent a rapist out to San Bernardino."</TE>
<TE>   Law's letter addressed the fact that some priests in his own diocese
have voiced similar views.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that there are many who believe my resignation is part of the
solution," Law wrote. "It distresses me greatly to have become a
lightning rod of division when mine should be a ministry of unity."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court refused to let an Atlanta salvage company
sell artifacts recovered from the wreck of the Titanic.</LD>
<LD>   In a 3-0 ruling, a panel of the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in
Richmond upheld a decision by a lower court judge and said that R.M.S.
Titanic Inc. does not have title to the objects.</LD>
<LD>   In 1994, U.S. District Judge J. Calvitt Clarke Jr. of Norfolk granted
R.M.S. Titanic the exclusive rights to bring up items from the wreck.
Later, however, the company, citing financial difficulty, wanted to begin
selling some or all of the items.</LD>

the manual for courts-martial issued by the White House.</LD>
<LD>   The changes also spell out for the first time rules for prosecuting
military members for adultery. The rules say the adultery must either
damage military order and discipline or hurt the military's reputation.</LD>

<LD>Bellying up to the bar at Jerry's Nugget Casino in North Las Vegas
will get you more than just a hangover. It'll help a campaign to keep
nuclear waste out of Nevada.</LD>
<LD>   The casino is offering a specialty drink called "The Yucca Mountain
Meltdown." The $2.50 drink, served in a souvenir glass, is a blend of
curacao, rum and pineapple.</LD>
<LD>   Jerry's Nugget will donate $1 from each sale to the Nevada
Anti-Nuclear Waste Task Force, a nonprofit public advocacy organization.</LD>

<HD>Man Pleads Guilty in '91 Brooklyn Riots</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Declaring he has never been a racist, one of two black men charged
in the 1991 Crown Heights riots pleaded guilty Friday for his role in the
violence that swept through the Brooklyn neighborhood and lead to the
death of a Jewish scholar.</LD>
<LD>   Charles Price, 48, who appeared in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn,
admitted he violated the civil rights of Yankel Rosenbaum, 29, who died
in a nearby hospital after being stabbed on the street.</LD>
<LD>   Price told the court he urged members of a crowd, which had gathered
after a black child was killed in an auto accident, to follow him. "I
told them it was an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth," he said.</LD>
<TE>   "In my heart, I have never been a racist," Price added. "I feel very
sorry for all the people who were hurt or died that night."</TE>
<TE>   Over four days, 188 people were injured as crowds threw bottles,
looted and smashed cars, including police vehicles. A state investigative
group later labeled the violent clashes between Hasidic Jews and blacks
as "the worst outbreak of racial violence in more than 20 years."</TE>
<TE>   Price's appearance Friday before Judge David Trager was a somewhat
bitter aftermath to the violence.</TE>
<TE>   In January, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered a new trial
for Price and Lemrick Nelson Jr., 27. It said Trager manipulated the jury
makeup in their trial in an effort to achieve a racial and religious
balance.</TE>
<TE>   Price originally received a sentence of 21 years and 10 months in
prison. On Friday, Trager sentenced him to 11 years and eight months. He
already has served almost half of that time.</TE>
<TE>   Norman Rosenbaum, whose brother was killed in the rioting, sat in the
courtroom while Price read his prepared statement. He said he didn't
believe that Price spoke with sincerity.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't hear the words, 'I'm sorry.' I didn't hear one iota of
remorse," Rosenbaum said after the proceeding. "It's not good enough."</TE>
<TE>   Price's lawyer, Darrell Paster, said his client decided Thursday night
to plead guilty. "He just wanted closure. He just wanted certainty,"
Paster said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Atty. Alan Vinegrad said he believed the government had achieved
a fair result in the case. "After years of denials, this defendant has at
long last admitted that he was responsible for precipitating the attack
on Yankel Rosenbaum," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson, who was 16 when the violence flared, was originally acquitted
of killing Rosenbaum. He was later found guilty of violating the victim's
civil rights and sentenced to 19 1/2 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Vinegrad pledged to press the case against Nelson too.</TE>
<TE>   "The Department of Justice will continue to pursue our civil rights
prosecution . . . until he too is brought to justice," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The rioting erupted Aug. 19, 1991, when a station wagon in a
procession escorting Rabbi Menachem Schneerson, the world leader of
Lubavitch Judaism, struck and killed 7-year-old Gavin Cato. As word of
Cato's death spread through the neighborhood, black youths stoned homes
and attacked residents.</TE>
<TE>   A grand jury declined to indict Yosef Lifsh, the driver of the
vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, on the 10th anniversary of the violence, Rosenbaum's brother
and Cato's father shook hands in a gesture of reconciliation at City
Hall. The meeting was arranged by then-Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.</TE>

<HD>New Federal Security Mandates Mean Financial Crunch for Major
Airports</HD>
<DH>Screening: LAX is among those facing daunting shortfalls while
trying to pay for explosives detection.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Dozens of major airports across the country, including Los Angeles
International, face a massive funding shortfall as they seek to meet a
Dec. 31 deadline for installing explosives detection machines required by
Congress, officials with the U.S. Conference of Mayors said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The gap at LAX is more than $120 million, and Los Angeles Mayor James
K. Hahn warned that the shortfall could interfere with meeting the
deadline for putting the devices online.</LD>
<LD>   "We won't be able to install them; we will run out of money very
quickly," Hahn said. "If we're going to be part of this effort to provide
homeland security, we are going to need some help. We don't believe the
funding has been forthcoming."</LD>
<TE>   Elsewhere, officials estimate costs of $50 million to $86 million in
Atlanta and $24 million in St. Louis. And this is just one of a range of
arenas in which someone--the federal government, state and local
government or the private sector--will have to pay the high cost of
protecting the United States from terrorist attacks such as those of
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Congress required in November that all checked luggage--about 1
billion bags a year nationwide--be screened with explosives detection
equipment by the end of this year. The most advanced machines use
computerized tomography technology similar to that employed by hospitals
to look at the body's soft tissues. Roughly the size of a sport utility
vehicle, a machine costs $1 million, plus $1 million to install. The
federal government will pay the cost of procuring the machines; the
dispute is over installation costs.</TE>
<TE>   The $120-million shortfall at LAX is more than half of what it budgets
in a typical year for all capital improvement projects, including safety
upgrades to reduce the airport's high risk of runway collisions.</TE>
<TE>   At a smaller Los Angeles-area airport, Ontario International,
officials estimate that the cost of installing the detection equipment
will range from $4.8 million to $6.4 million, with an expected federal
contribution of $2.8 million. Figures were not available for Burbank and
John Wayne International airports.</TE>
<TE>   Fort Worth Mayor Kenneth Barr said Dallas-Fort Worth International
faced a total bill of $195 million and expected the federal contribution
to cover only a fraction.</TE>
<TE>   "Is it necessary?" Barr asked. "I don't know. But I don't think that
as elected officials responsible for the safety of this facility, we can
ignore the threat. The cost is absolutely mind-boggling. But the cost of
not doing it could be greater."</TE>
<TE>   Barr said the Dallas-Fort Worth airport may have to raise its fees on
airlines, which would result in higher ticket prices. At LAX, Hahn said,
rising security costs could lead to layoffs and pressure to slow down
safety improvements.</TE>
<TE>   Local officials say the funding crunch stems from a decision by the
Bush administration to budget only $175,000 as the federal share of
installing each scanner. Previous Federal Aviation Administration
estimates put the installation cost at about $1 million for each machine.
In many cases, floors have to be reinforced and walls torn down to
accommodate the units.</TE>
<TE>   "We definitely recognize that there is going to be some budgetary
challenge in meeting the requirements," said Jonathan Thompson, a
spokesman for the new federal Transportation Security Administration. He
cautioned that the estimates by the airports might turn out to be high,
because the agency had yet to decide the mix of devices that would be
used for scanning bags.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), chairwoman of the transportation
appropriations subcommittee, said the administration's $175,000 appeared
"woefully low."</TE>
<TE>   "I am concerned that we are starting to see a pattern of the
administration indicating that they want to have aviation security on the
cheap," Murray said. "It was precisely because we didn't make the
necessary security investments in the past that we were so vulnerable
Sept. 11."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said LAX estimated it would need 150 of the most sophisticated
bomb detection machines. The federal contribution of $175,000 per machine
for installation would come to about $26 million. But the total
installation cost could top $150 million.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer than 200 of the machines are being used at airports around the
country, including Los Angeles International. An estimated 2,990 would be
needed to cover all 429 airports with regular airline service, at a cost
of more than $2.5 billion, plus installation. All told, the cost of
fortifying the nation's airports is expected to exceed $6 billion in the
current fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials have urged the mayors to tap into grants that
Congress already provides to expand airport capacity and improve safety.
But local officials say that's not the answer.</TE>
<TE>   "We certainly don't want to rob Peter to pay Paul here," Hahn said.
"We want to do runway safety, but we also want to make sure every
passenger and every piece of baggage is screened."</TE>

<HD>Traficant Faces Uphill Fight to Keep House Seat</HD>
<DH>Politics: Precedent is working against the Ohio lawmaker found
guilty of corruption.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Convicted of bribery, racketeering and other crimes by a jury of
12, Rep. James A. Traficant Jr. now awaits the verdict of a jury of 434.</LD>
<LD>   The question of whether his House colleagues will let him stay in
office could come up in a matter of days, but the nine-term Ohio Democrat
remained defiant Friday, declaring that he would seek reelection this
fall as an independent and reiterating that he would not resign.</LD>
<LD>   "I will not allow the government to get rid of Jim Traficant without a
fight," he told reporters in Cleveland, one day after a U.S. District
Court jury found him guilty on 10 federal charges. He has vowed to
appeal.</LD>
<TE>   Traficant's defiance has put him on a collision course with other
House members.</TE>
<TE>   Most had kept silent while the outcome of his trial was pending. But
now they appear ready to mete out harsh discipline. As a result,
Traficant could become the first member expelled from the House in 22
years, and just the second since the Civil War's end.</TE>
<TE>   The House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct has announced it
will review Traficant's case. The 10-member ethics panel, evenly divided
between Republicans and Democrats, can recommend a range of punishments,
from reprimand to expulsion.</TE>
<TE>   A source familiar with the committee predicted a quick review of
Traficant's case. The panel already has begun assembling the trial
record.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Constitution, the House is the final arbiter of its
membership. It may expel a representative on a two-thirds vote.</TE>
<TE>   While the ethics panel's recommendation would carry great weight,
Traficant could face House expulsion as soon as the chamber reconvenes
Tuesday. House rules permit any member to bypass the committee and bring
a resolution for expulsion directly to the floor.</TE>
<TE>   House bylaws require that such matters dealing with the "dignity and
integrity" of the House take priority over all legislation, forcing
Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) to schedule a debate and vote within
two legislative days.</TE>
<TE>   Under House rules, it appears possible for a convicted felon to
continue to cast votes. The rules say only that a member convicted of a
crime carrying a possible sentence of at least two years' imprisonment
"should refrain" from voting in the House--until the member regains a
presumption of innocence or is reelected.</TE>
<TE>   Traficant faces up to 63 years in prison and more than $2 million in
fines.</TE>
<TE>   Precedent and politics indicate that Traficant faces an uphill battle
to defend himself in the House.</TE>
<TE>   The last member expelled, Rep. Michael J. "Ozzie" Myers (D-Pa.), also
was convicted of bribery--a crime that lawmakers say strikes at the heart
of the government's reputation. Before Myers was forced out in October
1980, the only three previous expulsions occurred in 1861 as Congress was
ridding itself of lawmakers loyal to the Confederacy, according to
Congressional Quarterly.</TE>
<TE>   Other lawmakers in modern times have run afoul of the law and kept
their seats. Some have served while under indictment. Rep. Jay C. Kim
(R-Diamond Bar) was allowed to serve out his term after he pleaded guilty
in 1997 to misdemeanor campaign finance violations. He subsequently lost
a reelection bid.</TE>
<TE>   But congressional aides note that a conviction is more significant
than an indictment, and a felony, such as bribery, is more serious than a
misdemeanor.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anybody wants to be in the position of protecting a
felon," one Republican aide said.</TE>
<TE>   Added a Democratic leadership aide: "It reflects horribly on the
House."</TE>
<TE>   Also working against Traficant is his lack of a partisan base. Neither
party gave him a committee seat during this session of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats shun him as a traitor for voting last year to reelect
Hastert as House speaker. House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt
(D-Mo.) called on Traficant to resign immediately after the verdict was
announced Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans in recent years have relished Traficant's support on key
legislation and have been amused at his outlandish tirades during floor
debates, which he frequently punctuates with his pet phrase, "Beam me
up!"</TE>
<TE>   But Republicans are keenly aware that he is not one of them--and more
important, that he could never be elected under the GOP banner from his
heavily Democratic base in northeast Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   A few factors could work in his favor, however. The House could delay
a decision until his sentencing June 27. It also could decide to avoid
the appearance of a hasty decision by letting the ethics panel deliberate
the matter.</TE>
<TE>   One influential Ohio Republican, Rep. Robert W. Ney has spoken up for
Traficant. While Ney lamented the pall that the verdict cast over the
House, he described himself as a friend of the convicted congressman.
"It's a shame," he said. "Our thoughts go out to Jim Traficant and his
family."</TE>
<TE>   Ney said the ethics panel should consider the Traficant matter before
it comes up on the floor. Asked about the possibility of a rapid vote,
bypassing the committee, he said: "That's not justice."</TE>

<HD>Educator Will Finally Get Her Trip in Space</HD>
<DH>Flight: Barbara Morgan, who was a backup for the doomed Challenger
mission, will crew on a shuttle in 2004, NASA says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>SYRACUSE, N.Y.
</DL>
<LD>Sixteen years after Christa McAuliffe and six other astronauts died
in the Challenger explosion, NASA announced Friday that McAuliffe's
fellow teacher and onetime understudy Barbara Morgan will ride aboard a
shuttle in 2004.</LD>
<LD>   "NASA has an unfinished mission," Sean O'Keefe, the space agency's
administrator, said during a speech at Syracuse University. "It is time
for NASA to complete the mission--to send an educator into space to
inspire and teach our young people."</LD>
<LD>   Morgan, 50, is a former third-grade teacher from McCall, Idaho, who
now lives in Houston, where she has trained and worked at the Johnson
Space Center since 1998. She has been named the educator mission
specialist.</LD>
<TE>   O'Keefe said Morgan's selection was fitting.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan trained with the Challenger crew and was McAuliffe's backup.
She watched from the launch site when the shuttle exploded Jan. 28, 1986,
just 73 seconds into its flight.</TE>
<TE>   Since the accident, Morgan has worked with NASA and science
organizations "keeping alive Christa McAuliffe's inspiration and the
dream of an educator in the space program," O'Keefe said.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan's mission will be the first of a series of flights in the new
Educator Mission Specialist program. O'Keefe said NASA is developing a
partnership with the U.S. Education Department and soon will release the
details of a national recruitment program for follow-up missions. Each
teacher would receive full astronaut training.</TE>
<TE>   "It is vital that we inspire our young people to learn and to teach,"
O'Keefe said. "I hope that NASA's new direction in this area--in the
person of Barbara Morgan and those who will follow her--will result in a
new crop of young, invigorated educators."</TE>
<TE>   O'Keefe's predecessor, Daniel Goldin, approved Morgan's acceptance as
a full-time astronaut Jan. 16, 1998, at the same time he announced
then-Sen. John Glenn's assignment to the crew of an October 1998 shuttle
mission.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, NASA critics speculated Morgan was approved to divert
criticism of the Glenn assignment. But Goldin insisted NASA was not
reviving the old "civilian in space" program, saying the agency was
simply "expanding the reach of the astronaut program."</TE>
<TE>   While O'Keefe did not name a specific flight, he said Morgan will fly
in 2004, after the international space station's solar power system is
finished. The appointment is the centerpiece of a program emphasizing
education in a bid to attract more students to science and engineering.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the old Teacher in Space program, O'Keefe said Morgan's
appointment will not be "a one-shot deal, which in a lot of ways the
Teacher in Space program was."</TE>
<TE>   "This will be a case of really dedicating effort to professional
educators, who will also be proficient, trained and competent to handle
all the other important mission objectives that every astronaut has,"
O'Keefe said.</TE>
<TE>   As O'Keefe was making his remarks, Morgan was working in Mission
Control at the Houston space center, serving as the day shift's
"capcom"--capsule communicator--the astronaut who relays instructions to
the crew aboard the space station. As such, she was not immediately
available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Space station astronaut Carl Walz told a reporter that Morgan's

<HD>Report Raises Questions in Columbine Teen's Death</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER
</DL>
<LD>The independent investigation charged with determining how
Columbine student Dan Rohrbough died during the 1999 school shooting
reportedly concludes the 15-year-old was not shot at close range. That
finding allows for the possibility that Rohrbough was accidentally killed
by police as the boy's parents contend.</LD>
<LD>   The 1,200-page report from the El Paso County sheriff's office has not
been released publicly, but the Rocky Mountain News reported Friday that
Rohrbough's parents have been informed the new report contradicts a key
finding in the original investigative report from Jefferson County
officials.</LD>
<LD>   That original report said Rohrbough fell to the ground, wounded,
outside the school cafeteria. Then, the report said, gunman Dylan Klebold
approached the teen and shot him at close range, killing him.</LD>
<TE>   If the newspaper's report is true, it opens the possibility Rohrbough
could have been caught in police cross-fire, from law enforcement
officers at various positions surrounding the school.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve students and one teacher were killed at Columbine, the worst
school shooting ever in America. The two student gunmen, Klebold and Eric
Harris, roamed the school, tossing bombs and gunning down classmates
before taking their own lives in the school library.</TE>
<TE>   Rohrbough's parents have long maintained their son was felled by
friendly fire. It was their insistence on further investigation that
prompted the current one.</TE>
<TE>   In December, Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone asked El Paso County
Sheriff John Anderson to conduct an independent investigation into the
circumstances of Rohrbough's death.</TE>
<TE>   The newspaper said it was not clear whether the report draws a
conclusion as to who killed Rohrbough. Officials with El Paso and
Jefferson counties would not comment on the report.</TE>
<TE>   The significance of the new finding could launch more lawsuits from an
incident that has already spawned dozens.</TE>
<TE>   A lawsuit brought by Rohrbough's parents in which they allege an
officer shot their son was dismissed in November in federal court here.
But the family filed another suit a month later, naming a Denver police
officer as the shooter. The officer has denied the allegation.</TE>

<HD>Moussaoui Says Rights Violated</HD>
<DH>Defense: The accused terrorist is being denied attorney-client
privilege in jail, his lawyers argue in a court motion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Accused terrorist Zacarias Moussaoui, who has been portrayed as
sullen and uncommunicative, is trying to take an active role in his
defense against death-penalty charges but has been thwarted by
"oppressive" lock-down conditions in jail, his lawyers said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Moussaoui, who some authorities contend was to be the 20th hijacker on
Sept. 11, has been harassed by guards, kept awake all night by blinding
light and jarring noise and denied the basic rights of the accused,
according to a court motion.</LD>
<LD>   The court papers said Moussaoui hasn't been allowed to keep
discussions with his lawyers or his legal paperwork confidential. He has
been denied a computer, even though the federal government's voluminous
investigative materials are being provided to the defense on 1,400
CD-ROMs, according to the court papers.</LD>
<TE>   Moussaoui is also prohibited from having staples or paper clips to
organize the thousands of pages of legal documents he will be receiving,
according to the motion, which was filed in U.S. District Court in
Alexandria, Va.</TE>
<TE>   His lawyers filed the motion to seek an immediate injunction from what
they describe as the "particularly oppressive conditions of his
confinement that interfere with his ability to defend himself."</TE>
<TE>   "It is the most oppressive thing I have ever seen for someone who is
presumed innocent," defense lawyer Frank W. Dunham Jr. said.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials responded that the "special
administrative measures" were court-ordered and are not being abused.
Beyond that, "we can't comment on anything regarding this case," because
of the continuing investigation and upcoming trial, spokesman Bryan
Sierra said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema scheduled an April 22 hearing to
determine whether Moussaoui's rights have been violated and whether he
deserves better treatment.</TE>
<TE>   The court brief also provides details, for the first time, of
Moussaoui's behavior since his indictment in November on charges that he
conspired to kill more than 3,000 people in the attacks on the World
Trade Center and the Pentagon. Last month, prosecutors said they would
seek the death penalty for Moussaoui, 33, a French citizen of Moroccan
descent who is the only person charged in the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   For months, Moussaoui has been portrayed as being so unresponsive that
he refuses to say anything other than anti-American epithets.</TE>
<TE>   But in the documents, as well as interviews with his lawyers Friday,
Moussaoui is described as being interested, even eager, to help his
public defenders mount the best defense possible.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui, they say, asks questions, takes notes, participates in
legal discussions and has actively tried--without success--to prevent
authorities from listening in on his conversations and going through his
mail.</TE>
<TE>   "We wouldn't be filing this motion if he wasn't trying hard to
participate in his own defense," Dunham said, adding that Moussaoui keeps
the legal team informed of potential violations of his legal and civil
rights while in custody.</TE>
<TE>   "How else would we know about them?" Dunham asked.</TE>
<TE>   According to the legal brief, the violations are so significant as to
potentially affect the outcome of Moussaoui's trial, which will put the
U.S. legal system on worldwide display when it gets underway this fall.</TE>
<TE>   "While no one condition may seem that onerous when considered in
isolation, when viewed as a whole . . . they are quite lethal," the
defense lawyers wrote. "Whether intended or not, the conditions of
confinement create an insurmountable impediment to Moussaoui, an
intelligent and well-educated man professing his innocence, from having
any meaningful participation in defense of his own life."</TE>
<TE>   Some of Moussaoui's problems stem from the fact that he was bumped out
of a larger prison cell recently to make room for another notorious
prisoner, accused American Talib John Walker Lindh. That cell had the
space for a computer, files and documents that lawyers said Moussaoui
needs to participate in his defense.</TE>
<TE>   The lawyers also contend that their client is being harassed by his
captors.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui is being held in solitary confinement, in a small cell with
a steel toilet, steel sink and raised concrete platform for sleeping,
"with little room for anything else," the court brief said.</TE>
<TE>   "A bright fluorescent light shines on him 24 hours a day so that he
can be constantly observed via a video camera at a monitor watched by
guards," it said. In addition, "guards routinely wake him up throughout
the night by opening a steel partition to look directly into the cell."</TE>
<TE>   But the lawyers said they were more concerned with the ramifications
that such harsh treatment could have on the outcome of his case. The
restrictions and oversight mean that on occasion, the only way they can
talk to their client is through the food slot in the door to his cell,
they said.</TE>
<TE>   And though he has the right to talk confidentially with his lawyers to
discuss legal strategy, guards hover so close that they can hear every
word, his lawyers contend. Moussaoui's guards also "routinely search
through materials given to him by his counsel," including those clearly
marked "attorney/client privileged," even when he objects, the court
papers said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Moussaoui's protests, one jail official even insisted on
reading an early draft of the motion filed Friday challenging his
conditions in prison.</TE>
<TE>   "How can you have attorney-client privilege when every time he takes
notes on what we discuss with him, they read the notes?" Dunham asked.
"The conditions here are worse than those provided military captives at
Guantanamo Bay" in Cuba.</TE>

<HD>Custody Hearing for 'Boy Genius' Is Postponed</HD>
<DH>Court: The Colorado child, 8, was taken from his mother after he
attempted suicide.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BROOMFIELD, Colo.
</DL>
<LD>The fate of an 8-year-old boy whose IQ test scores earned him the
label "Boy Genius" remained unclear Friday, when a hearing to decide his
custody was continued until next month.</LD>
<LD>   Elizabeth Chapman, the boy's mother, attended the closed hearing at
Broomfield District Court, about 40 miles north of Denver. She has
admitted she falsified records that established her son Justin's
remarkable mental abilities and confessed she coached the boy on an IQ
test in which he scored 298-plus, the highest mark ever recorded.</LD>
<LD>   That test and other intelligence assessments led to Justin's being
hailed as "the greatest genius to ever grace the Earth" by an expert in
Denver who specializes in identifying profoundly gifted children.</LD>
<TE>   The Chapmans, who moved here from New York state last summer, became
celebrities in the world of hyper-intelligent children. Justin had
already taken college classes, been the subject of a BBC documentary and,
at age 7, scored a perfect 800 on the math section of the SAT and 650 on
the verbal section.</TE>
<TE>   Chapman told the Rocky Mountain News that she began to rig tests in
order to boost Justin's reputation. In the case of the SAT, Chapman said
she copied the score from the test of a neighbor's son. She also admitted
she made up IQ results from a test Justin took at age 3 and that he
studied a test booklet for the IQ test on which he scored 298.</TE>
<TE>   The facade surrounding the boy's gifted status began to crumble after
he was hospitalized in November following an apparent suicide attempt.
Officials from Broomfield County's children's services office removed
Justin from his mother's home, and she was charged with neglect.</TE>
<TE>   A psychological evaluation conducted at the time of his
hospitalization concluded that Justin's "recent suicidal gesture
exemplifies his inability to continue the existence that has been
assigned by his mother, the gifted community and most likely by himself."</TE>
<TE>   Chapman, 29, arrived at the courthouse for the early-morning hearing.
She was hustled into the closed session and the courtroom door and
corridor were guarded by police.</TE>
<TE>   After the hourlong proceeding, a court officer announced that the case
had been continued until May 10.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Hoffman, director of court services, would not disclose what
took place during the hearing but said the boy's grandparents had been
listed as interested parties in the case. Hoffman also said the boy's
father, James Maurer, who lives in North Carolina, admitted to creating
an "injurious environment" for his son, identical to the admission
Chapman made in court last month. Justin's parents were never married and
they did not live together after his birth.</TE>
<TE>   Chapman and her attorney Paul Dugas declined to comment after the
hearing. The boy remains in foster care, Hoffman said.</TE>
<TE>   According to Ed Lederman, a Denver divorce lawyer, Friday's
developments put Justin's future more in control of social services.</TE>
<TE>   "Now they've got control over the father," Lederman said of Maurer's
concession. "Once that admission is made, the father has essentially
ceded control to the state. Otherwise, the father could ask for custody
immediately. The upshot is he's taking responsibility for the environment
in which the child was raised."</TE>
<TE>   Justin's maternal grandparents had previously indicated they would
seek custody of him. Friday's proceedings do not automatically mean the
grandparents are seeking custody but could simply indicate they are
seeking legal standing in the court to be able to attend hearings and
obtain court materials.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be that the grandparents are just keeping in the loop,"
Lederman said. "Or it could be that social services wants the child to
reside with a family member. We don't know if the grandparents intervened
or social services contacted them. But once the injurious circumstances
are found, the court places the child using the standard of best interest
of the child."</TE>

said that the buyer, Richard J. Rotenberg, was the son of a partner in
the Minneapolis law firm where Samuel Maslon, the home's original owner,
was also a partner. Rotenberg learned about the property through a son of

Telemundo's other local station, KWHY-TV (Channel 22). The information

<LD>Neutra house--An article in Thursday's Southern California Living
section misrepresented the relationship between the sellers and the buyer
of a house designed by Richard Neutra in Rancho Mirage. It incorrectly
said that the buyer, Richard J. Rotenberg, was the son of a partner in
the Minneapolis law firm where Samuel Maslon, the home's original owner,
was also a partner. Rotenberg learned about the property through a son of
a partner in the firm and purchased it from Maslon's heirs.</LD>

<LD>Telemundo sale--A story in Thursday's Business section said that
NBC would sell KVEA-TV (Channel 52) in Los Angeles after acquiring the
Spanish-language network to comply with Federal Communications Commission
ownership restrictions. NBC rather intends to divest itself of
Telemundo's other local station, KWHY-TV (Channel 22). The information
was incorrect in the FCC's initial announcement approving the deal.</LD>
