<LD>ABC's first version of "The Bachelor" concluded in April, but like so
many contestants on unscripted programs, the show's first namesake
subject won't go away quietly.</LD>
<LD>   Alex Michel--the 31-year-old Harvard-educated management
consultant who had the task of choosing a prospective mate from among
25 women while cameras rolled--will extend his 15 minutes of fame by
hosting "The Bachelor: Special Edition," a repeat of the show on
ABC's sister cable network, ABC Family, from Aug. 11-16.</LD>
<LD>   Michel, who by all accounts is now pursuing a show-business
career, will augment the initial episodes (ABC calls this an
"enhanced-viewing experience," a fancy way of saying dressed-up
reruns) by "revealing what he was really thinking" during the taping.</LD>
<TE>   ABC has plenty riding on the show, with a sequel planned for fall
as well as "The Bachelorette," featuring Trista Rehn--the runner-up
from the original series--sifting through 25 male candidates. Rehn
lists her occupations as pediatric physical therapist and dancer for
the NBA's Miami Heat, but as with Michel, leaves the obvious
unstated--"aspiring television star."</TE>

<TE>   Inside Story</TE>
<TE>   Filmmaker Ernest Dickerson is talking about heroes, namely Lloyd
Newman and LeAlan Jones. As teenagers, the two young men became the
youngest recipients of the coveted Peabody Award after detailing
their lives inside an infamous south Chicago ghetto for a National
Public Radio documentary produced by reporter David Isay.</TE>
<TE>   "It lit a spark," Dickerson said of the boys' story. "I was
totally blown away by it. I just felt it gave a very interesting
insight into the hopes and the minds of a lot of people in that
neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   Dickerson, who began his career 20 years ago shooting Spike Lee's
film-school dramas, chose to make his directorial debut with "Our
America," the docudrama based on the boys' story. The film, which is
based on NPR tapes and the book "Our America: Life and Death on the
South Side of Chicago," by Newman and Jones with Isay, premiered
Sunday on Showtime.</TE>
<TE>   "Our America" tracks the boys' experiences from the time they were
recruited by Isay in 1993 to record their day-to-day lives in the Ida
B. Wells housing project in south Chicago, through the resulting
national fame and suspicion from their neighbors, who felt the
reports portrayed the community too negatively.</TE>
<TE>   In preparing to shoot the film, Dickerson reviewed some of the
unedited tapes the boys made. He recalled one scene in which Jones'
mother speaks dispassionately to her son about the disappearance and
probable death of his father.</TE>
<TE>   "She says, 'I think it was God's will.... My fate was decided long
before I came on this Earth,' " Dickerson recalls. "That's indicative
of the attitudes [in this community] .... They feel they don't have
the power to effect change in their lives."</TE>
<TE>   In another scene, the boys chastise a friend for selling drugs.
"Lloyd says, 'I bet I'll see you begging for a dime in 10 years.' The
boy says, 'I'm not going to be alive in 10 years. Nobody's going to
be alive in 10 years,' " Dickerson said. "An attitude like that robs
you of a future."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to their friends and relatives, Newman and Jones
managed to leave the ghetto to attend college. Both eventually
graduated.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really fascinated by ... what they were able to do and how
they kept at it," he said. "It gave them a way out of that
neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gross-Out</TE>
<TE>   Subversive comic Andy Dick was at it again on Thursday night at
the Key Club, grossing out a crowd of fans who packed the Hollywood
nightspot to see his infamous cabaret show.</TE>
<TE>   The performance featured a naked, tattooed woman; a large man
known as "Big Fat Paul" who appears on stage staggering drunk after
Dick introduces him as his Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor; and onstage
antics that cannot be described here. The show also gave Dick a
chance to premiere songs from his forthcoming rock debut, a 10-track
record on which Dick lampoons his drug problems, his sobriety and
stints he spent in drug rehab.</TE>
<TE>   The record, which also features a watercolor portrait of Dick by
his friend Marilyn Manson and guitar work by Smash Mouth's Greg Camp
and former Foo Fighter Franz Stahl, debuts Aug. 20.</TE>

<HD>For the Love of the Sea</HD>
<DH>With the popular Beercan sailboat races, it's not whether
you win or lose, it's enjoying the experience</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET EASTMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's the most easygoing of sailboat races. The course isn't
demanding, winning or losing doesn't mean much, and the trophies are
engraved glass mugs or squished Bud cans mounted onto a piece of
wood.</LD>
<LD>   No wonder Beercan regattas are so loved by sailors and those who
cheer them on that there is usually at least one every summer,
wherever there's a boating club willing to organize one.</LD>
<LD>   A no-spinnaker rule makes the Beercans even more laid back in some
harbors. The large headsail, which billows out in front of the boat,
can obscure views in a crowded race. Its replacement, the smaller jib
sail, is easier to see around and maneuver from side to side,
although its size can also make it harder to capture the wind. Using
the jib takes the pressure off crews who don't want to work too hard,
but allows others to test their tactical skills, if they choose to.</LD>
<TE>   The Balboa Yacht Club launched its Beercan Regatta more than 50
years ago so members could have a relaxing sail in Newport Harbor and
not care who finished first. Since then, sailboats have created a
postcard image on Thursday evenings from mid-May until the end of
August by lining up in the part of Newport Bay that separates Balboa
Peninsula from Balboa Island. The volunteer race committee classifies
about 40 boats by size and staggers their start time, with the larger
A-class boats leaving first at 6 p.m., to avoid trampling the smaller
ones.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to guess who will be the real winner of Balboa's series,
which ends Aug. 29. Will it be the skipper who posts the most wins
over the 15-week season? The hundreds of yacht club members and their
guests, dressed in tank tops and tennies, who chow down on barbecue
and toast the sunset after the race? Or student sailors--sometimes in
boats borrowed from Orange Coast College's respected sailing
program--who test their skills in a calm harbor? It all depends on
what the Beercan Regatta means to the players.</TE>
<TE>   It's a race to John Mack, 65, who sails a 36-footer named
Michegaas--Yiddish for "crazy idea"--with co-owner Joe Greenblatt and
a steady crew of six men. Mack has been competing in Balboa's
Beercans for 25 years and has taken home trophies for doing well
during one of the four months of the regatta, but never for the full
season.</TE>
<TE>   He's determined, though, to show off his team's prowess: "This is
a race where we can have fun, but we're serious, and we want to win."</TE>
<TE>   His crew members hope to place in the top of their class, but to
do so, they'll have to improve their performance during the final
five races since they're in the middle of a pack of eight now.</TE>
<TE>   "We were pretty sloppy at the beginning of the season," Mack says.
Once, the crew lost track of the start sequence, missed taking off
with the C-class and spent the rest of the hourlong race trying to
catch up.</TE>
<TE>   As three boats were rounding the final marker, there were nonstop
directions to the Michegaas crew and shouts to the other boats, which
were just an arm's length away on both sides, to "Stay clear!"</TE>
<TE>   Dennis D'Alessio, owner of the banana-colored Salty Dog, doesn't
care who wins. He has boxes of painted trophies with toy sailboats on
top, and he doesn't want any more.</TE>
<TE>   "Our race is to get to the party at the [Balboa Yacht] club," says
D'Alessio, who publishes a national directory for the marine industry
with his brother, Richard, and says the only stress they have with
the Beercans is leaving work on time to meet their crew.</TE>
<TE>   Although most skippers restrict the number of people weighing down
the boat, the 47-foot Salty Dog is the place for a deck-full of
singles "to hang out, meet and date," says D'Alessio. Finding crew
isn't difficult. An hour before the race, people plead their way on
board, sometimes waving a six-pack of beer as enticement.</TE>
<TE>   "We go for comfort," says D'Alessio, 37, who has been racing in
Beercans since he was 12, first in Marina del Rey and for 20 years in
Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Many inexperienced sailors get their start competing in these more
casual regattas, and that's their main benefit, says Mary Longpre, a
Balboa Yacht Club member who volunteers at youth and adult races. "A
lot of guys in the important races like the America's Cup grew up
competing in Beercan races," says Longpre, who has been skippering
Queen of Hearts, a 20-footer, and Valentine, a 30-footer, with an
all-female crew in Balboa's regatta for three decades.</TE>
<TE>   The first lessons every new sailor should learn? "Have fun," says
Longpre, 59, whose husband, Bob, taught her the sport. "But be safe
and respect the camaraderie. A good sailor will drop out of a race to
help a fellow competitor who's in trouble."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Balboa Yacht Club's Beercan races begin at 6 p.m. on Thursdays
through Aug. 29 in Newport Harbor. Good public viewing points are at
the Balboa Fun Zone area on the Balboa Peninsula or the sidewalk
aligning South Bay Front on Balboa Island.</TE>
<TE>   The Balboa Bay Club, which is open to yacht club members and their
guests, is at 1801 Bayside Drive, Corona del Mar, (949) 673-3515,

<LD>THE HERMIT'S STORY</LD>
<LD>   Stories</LD>
<LD>   By Rick Bass</LD>
<TE>   Houghton Mifflin</TE>
<TE>   180 pages, $22</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Men and women reaching blindly for love, stumbling into and
through intimacy, finding their way when the ground on which they've
built their lives becomes liquid under their feet: This terrain of
exposed human emotions is staked out by Rick Bass in his strong,
gorgeously crafted collection "The Hermit's Story." Through these
rustic tales, Bass ("Colter" and "Where the Sea Used to Be") brings
us deep into nature, where ice, snow and fire, wolves and coyotes
endanger our lives, yet where swans and deer, ice-crusted lakes and
hidden caves mark the entrance to a mystical understanding. Bass
shows us, through crystalline images of the physical world, an
intangible kind of grace--the blessings nature bestows when we're
least expecting them.</TE>
<TE>   The title story describes the dog-trainer Ann returning a dozen
speckled German shorthair pointers to their owner, Gray Owl, in the
wilds of Saskatchewan, having completed a summer and autumn's worth
of training them. While trying out the hunting dogs' new skills, Gray
Owl and Ann become lost, drifting off course by as much as 10 miles.
Knowing they'll have to hunker down for the night, Gray Owl
investigates a frozen lake as a source of water for the dogs. "He
kicked once at the sheet of ice," Ann tells us, "the vast plate of
it, with his heel, then disappeared below the ice." Ann crawls out on
the lake, attempting a desperate rescue mission, only to find Gray
Owl standing safely below the ice on solid ground. The lake had
frozen on its surface, but the water below the ice had drained away,
leaving a protected refuge.</TE>
<TE>   Ann, Gray Owl and the dogs survive the night in this under-the-ice
burrow with "the hot muck of the earth's massive respirations
breathing out warmth," both trapped and protected by the ice, and
eventually make their way to the shore under this frozen shield. The
two find extraordinary beauty and enchantment in their glacial
shelter. "The moonlight would strafe down through those rents in the
ice, and shards of moon-ice would be glittering and spinning like
diamond-motes in those newly vented columns of moonlight; and they
pushed on, still lost, but so alive."</TE>
<TE>   This is Bass at his finest: showing us elegance where fear usually
resides, demonstrating again and again that "the austere times were
the very thing, the very imbalance, that would summon the
resurrection of that frozen richness within the soil...." In Bass'
world of hardscrabble living, his characters are strong and
perceptive. "Living up here sharpens one's senses. The social senses
atrophy a bit, but the wild body becomes stronger." Yet, for all
their physical strength, the characters are just as lost to their
emotions, to the incessant pull of human longing and the need for
connection, as we are.</TE>
<TE>   "Swans" is a gorgeous love story of Billy and Amy, a gentle,
well-matched couple living in the mountain wilds. All his life, Billy
has worked in the woods, sawing down trees on his land "in the
bottoms;" he knows these woods as well as he knows himself and labors
daily to keep them just so. Amy is a baker and the smell of her bread
fills the mountain ridges. She bakes for Billy, for the neighbors and
for the swans who live on their pond. When the winter comes on harsh,
she lights fires around the pond to help the swans stay warm. The
couple's life and companionship are perfectly matched. "What it was
like was a balance; Billy's [and Amy's] life was wedged--as if stuck
in a chimney--between rise and fall, growth and rot." But change, as
nature always shows us, cannot be kept at bay. Billy's health begins
to fail, and we watch as this perfect balance slips and skids.</TE>
<TE>   With these stories as our guide, readers follow Bass deep into the
heart of the human wilderness. In "The Cave" a former miner revisits
the confined space of the mine with a new girlfriend along. The
entrance is so narrow, they must strip to fit through, and once
inside, are alternately lost and found in the scary, dark and complex
world of intimacy they find there.</TE>
<TE>   "The Fireman" tells of a remarried man, a volunteer firefighter,
who's trying to make his second family work. He uses the adrenaline
thrill of firefighting to keep distant any regret over his failed
first marriage and to resuscitate his second one. As long as
something keeps burning, he can avoid becoming weary of wedded life.
His community "becomes a tapestry, a weave of that which he has saved
and that which he has not--with the rest of the city becoming simply
all that which is between points, waiting to burn."</TE>
<TE>   An affirming, resounding collection, "The Hermit's Story" reveals
Bass as a master craftsman, sparkling in the diamond-motes of his
descriptions and the rawness of the human heart.</TE>

<LD>What animal is more afraid of you than you are of it? You'll often
hear it before you see it, and it grows a new rattle every time it
sheds its skin, which is one to three times a year. It's a
rattlesnake!</LD>
<LD>   Our regional rattlesnake is the Southern Pacific rattler. Adults
are 3 to 4 feet long, have cool, dry, diamond-patterned,
olive-gray-brownish-colored bodies, and are covered with scales.
Their heads are triangle-shaped with wide jaws and fangs. Rattles
used for making noise are at the end of their tails. Newborns are 10
inches long with a small, horny button on the tip of their tails.</LD>
<LD>   Rattlesnakes live in dry areas, making their homes in burrows,
rock crevices or caves. They eat lizards, ground squirrels, small
rabbits, rats, mice, birds and frogs. Rattlers are important because
they help to control the rodent population.</LD>
<TE>   Rattlesnakes try to keep a constant body temperature when active
by seeking cool or warm places in their environment, but can come out
day or night and are seen primarily from late spring through fall.</TE>
<TE>   Most rattlesnakes are shy. They strike in self-defense and will
leave when they feel safe. If you encounter a rattlesnake you should
give it the "right of way," stay alert, and watch where you put your
hands and feet. Wear sturdy shoes when out walking in grassy or rocky
areas. Don't depend on the rattle to warn you because it may be
missing or broken. Very few people are bitten by rattlesnakes, but
the bite from adults is painful and dangerous. If bitten, get medical
help immediately.</TE>
<TE>   The UCLA Stunt Ranch Reserve is a 310-acre, UCLA-managed
environmental studies field station that was homesteaded by the Stunt
family in 1885. It is home to a variety of animals including
rattlesnakes. To learn more, you can take part in a docent-led tour
of the reserve or participate in one of its K-12 environmental
programs led by the Cold Creek docents. Tours can be booked by
calling (818) 346-9675, Ext. 343. For free curriculum guides and more
information on the Stunt Ranch Reserve, go to
nrs.ucop.edu/reserves/stunt.html or call (310) 206-3887.</TE>

<LD>   --Genna, 7</LD>
<LD>   Westlake Hills Elementary</LD>
<TE>   Westlake Village</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   My favorite ride is Soaring Over California at Disney's California
Adventure. You get to see all the places over California like
snowboarders in Lake Tahoe, orange fields where you smell the
oranges, and the San Francisco Bay. It's a great experience.</TE>
<TE>   --Jonathan, 7</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   My favorite ride is the tour bus at Universal Studios Hollywood.
It makes me feel suspicious, afraid and dizzy. It makes me feel
suspicious because of the bridge. It makes me feel afraid because of
Jaws. It makes me feel dizzy because of the mummy's doom.</TE>
<TE>   --Charlene, 10</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   My favorite is at Knott's Berry Farm. Its name is Xcelerator. It
goes 80 mph. The whole thing is less than 20 seconds, though. It
makes me feel like I have shivers down my spine. I like this ride
because it goes super fast.</TE>
<TE>   --Matthew, 9</TE>
<TE>   Cerritos Elementary</TE>
<TE>   Cerritos</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   My favorite ride is the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland. It makes me
feel a little bit scared. I felt brave at the end because I made it
through. My favorite part is when I saw a lot of ghosts and when it
went a little bit down.</TE>
<TE>   --Sharon, 6</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   My favorite amusement park ride is Kong at Six Flags Marine World.
It does lots of different kinds of flips and rolls, including a
360-degree loop and a double upside-down corkscrew in the air. It's a
suspended coaster and has a big drop and goes up to speeds of 55 mph.</TE>

<HD>Anguish and Hope, Then the Miracle: No Bad News</HD>
<DH>After months of troubling events, one real-life drama plays
out to a much needed happy ending</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Their faces were on the front page of every newspaper in the country,
their words--one man's regret that he hadn't kissed his wife that
morning, another's request for a cold beer--led off every TV and
radio news program. The nine coal miners trapped for 72 hours in the
frigid, watery depths of a mine in Quecreek, Pa., were pulled not
only to safety early Sunday morning, they were drawn into the
thankful embrace of a nation passionately grateful for a story with a
happy ending.</LD>
<LD>   The rescue was dubbed by virtually everyone who spoke of it as a
miracle, an answer to a million prayers. "Thank you God," read a sign
stuck in the window of a nearby restaurant. Details of the men's
ordeal--how they tied themselves together so their bodies would all
be found, how they put wills and goodbye letters to their families in
a bucket, how they snuggled with each other to stay warm--were pored
over by Americans moved to tears and buoyed by a new sense of
elation--maybe, in a summer plagued by horrible news, things were
beginning to turn around.</LD>
<TE>   People trapped underground are always news. The attempted rescue
of spelunker Floyd Collins in 1925 became what is considered the very
first media frenzy. Almost 25 years later, coverage of efforts to
rescue a 3-year-old girl who had fallen down an abandoned well in San
Marino established the nascent KTLA-TV Channel 5 and introduced many
Angelenos to the power of TV news.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the media and the public have developed a standard
ritual of disaster and rescue--of vigil-keeping both physical and
electronic. "It's almost a genre," says Neil Gabler, cultural analyst
and author of "Life: the Movie." "People in dire circumstances, will
they survive, the families, the rescuers--Americans are used to that
convention. So this story would have been heavily reported anyway.
But there is no denying that Americans are pouring more into it
because of its context."</TE>
<TE>   Context being a month that has headlined child-rape and murder,
pederasty in the Catholic Church, multimillion-dollar book cooking in
the corporate sector and an ongoing war against terrorism. Context
being a year dominated by the maiming of the Pentagon and the
destruction of the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   "Confidence has been shaken in three pillars of American
life--religious, economic and government," says Gabler. "We really
need something that gives us some hope, some encouragement."</TE>
<TE>   Even something as relatively small and finite as the rescue of
nine men.</TE>
<TE>   The three-day vigil Americans kept as rescuers tried to gauge the
miners' whereabouts and then drill through the earth was a haunting
reminder of other recent days of waiting and watching--for news of
abducted children, for statements to be made after chief executives
and priests were led away in handcuffs, for the fires in the West to
burn themselves out, for the market to steady itself.</TE>
<TE>   It echoed even the days many spent in horrified prayer as
firefighters and rescue teams made dangerous forays into the blazing
wreckage of the World Trade Center. That the Pennsylvania mine was
just miles away from where United Flight 93 went down was not lost on
anyone--the local coroner expressed relief that this was one big
story he would not be part of.</TE>
<TE>   Only this time, there was good news, and only good news. Early
Sunday morning, as the men came up, muddy and shivering, to be
delivered to their weeping families, it was almost as if, through
some "Twilight Zone" twist, a handful of survivors from the Sept. 11
tragedy had finally been found.</TE>
<TE>   "We needed a happy ending," says Leo Braudy, a professor of
English at USC and author of an upcoming book on the history of
masculinity. "We'll take it where we can get it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hallmarks of a Drama</TE>
<TE>   Even without the context of recent events, the story had, from the
beginning, many hallmarks of cinematic drama.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very emblematic story," says Braudy. "Not Conan
single-handedly conquering everyone, but about men working with their
bodies. The community gathers, the governor comes down, the
calculations are made correctly and then the equipment works for
them, rather than them working for the equipment."</TE>
<TE>   The story line was adorned with gorgeous detail--two of the
trapped men were father- and son-in-law; the rescue efforts were
based in a church; the men communicated first by banging on pipes,
and when they could be heard, said they were fine but out of chewing
tobacco. When they emerged, they ran the gamut of male handsome--from
rugged, salt of the earth to the pinup good looks of Blaine Mayhugh.</TE>
<TE>   That it was coal miners lent an iconic status to the story and the
anxiety. Such mining films as John Ford's 1941 "How Green Was My
Valley," "Ace in the Hole" and "Matewan," even the pop hit "Big
John," mark the unique place in the landscape of the American
imagination. Coal mining, unlike so many industries, remains
untouched by the technological revolution. The actual work has not
changed for centuries. "It seems almost primitive," says Braudy.
"There they are, digging in the depths, wresting the fruits of the
earth with their hands."</TE>
<TE>   Like firefighters and police officers, coal miners are in physical
jeopardy every working day. The only thing that stands between them
and death is often their own physical wherewithal. The fact that nine
men could survive such hardship without technology or gear or even
food, says Braudy, makes their story even more compelling.</TE>
<TE>   "People are very anxious these days about what their bodies can
achieve without support, without technology," he says. "It makes
people feel better that these men survived with only the bodies God
gave them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Heroism and Endurance</TE>
<TE>   Beyond admiration for the sheer physical nature of the work, the
danger coal miners face--the very real possibility that, in a moment,
their lives could be obliterated by a ton of falling rock--has been
used in film and literature to illustrate the vagaries of fate, the
heroism of endurance and, occasionally, the corruption of mine owners
and the media.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Men Banded Together</TE>
<TE>   The rescue in Pennsylvania certainly bore out the first two
themes. The real story, says Gabler, is how the men banded together,
literally. "That scene, of them all tied together, was nonexistent in
American culture pre-9/11," he says. "Americans are always
negotiating between individuality and community. But here, they were
working together, huddled together."</TE>
<TE>   That image, of men huddled together for warmth in a cold dark cave
surrounded by ever-rising water, is the stuff of nightmares--studies
show about a third of Americans are claustrophobic and as the hours
stacked up, it was very easy to empathize almost physically with the
strain of being trapped underground. Although the events mercifully
lacked the circus atmosphere pilloried in Billy Wilder's dark 1951
"Ace in the Hole" (later renamed "The Big Carnival"), CNN and other
outlets provided ongoing, you-are-there reports that reminded many
Angelenos of their first encounter with live TV news coverage.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't help but think of the Kathy Ficus case," says Bob
Flannes, a Laguna Beach resident. "It was 1948 and so most of us
didn't have TVs but the bars did and I remember standing around
watching KTLA for hours. It was the first significant coverage of a
local news event."</TE>
<TE>   The little girl did not survive her fall down the abandoned well,
which made Sunday's outcome even more momentous.</TE>
<TE>   Flannes watched the story unfold on CNN and he was certain the men
were dead. "On the third day, I thought there was no chance. To get
all nine of them back, that's a miracle."</TE>

<LD>Benjamin Lopez sat at a table in the courtyard of the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art, watching people take their seats for the Friday
night jazz performance. A slight man with a nervous smile, Lopez is
the visitor services manager at the museum--a job that keeps him in
the background, people-watching.</LD>
<LD>   In his four years at the museum, Lopez has seen thousands of
singles pass through the galleries; one eye on the art, another on
fellow museum-goers.</LD>
<LD>   "Gallery tag" is how he refers to the deliberate dance between
singles. Mostly, he sees it in the modern and contemporary wing.
"Maybe modern art is more conducive to that sort of thing," he said.</LD>
<TE>   At the Museum of Contemporary Art in downtown L.A., guards refer
to it as "browsing."</TE>
<TE>   "It's like watching the Discovery Channel--the mating rituals,"
said Marisela Norte, a longtime MOCA employee. The rituals she has
observed begin with a glance, a smile. Then, there's tag as the
singles follow each other through the galleries. Possibly, there'll
be pithy observations about art. "Next thing you know, it's coffee."</TE>
<TE>   In a city where chance encounters between strangers are as rare as
rain, the museum is a casual space for the not-so-casual encounter.
It's less conspicuous than a bar prowl, the lighting is better, and
there's no risk of being asked to dance. The museum is also a house
of mirrors: visitors looking at art, and each other, as they
themselves are on display, watched by guards.</TE>
<TE>   At times, what the guards see--the singles' scene at the
museum--resembles a Saturday night at a Hollywood bar.</TE>
<TE>   "You see people dressed for the hunt: a lot of skin, the right
sunglasses," said Norte, adding that the shades stay on for
clandestine viewing of others.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent afternoon, she led an unofficial tour of the museum,
weaving through visitors watching the Warhol on the walls. The first
stop was Warhol's 1965 "Kiss," a double, black-and-white image in a
free-standing frame of two people kissing. The erotic image needed
little explanation. "A lot of people hang out at this one," she said,
before briskly advancing to the next room.</TE>
<TE>   "In this gallery you can walk around and, not hunt, but you know
...." she said. She pointed to a soup-can painting. "Everyone wants
to see that." She had noticed one man lingering recently in front of
that canvas. "I wasn't sure if he was captivated by the painting or
the woman looking at the cans."</TE>
<TE>   There's little action around the disaster paintings, Norte said as
she walked past them, arriving at another people-catcher: a row of
pop icons near the exit. "Somewhere between Mick Jagger and
Mapplethorpe is your last chance," she said. "If you don't say hello
at this point, that's it."</TE>
<TE>   It does take gumption, and a certain leap of faith, to make a
move. That cute single may be part of a couple strolling the rooms at
different paces. And pickup lines resound in the quiet galleries.</TE>
<TE>   For those content simply to view the chase, the best seat is the
information desk at front. It's a prime vantage point for observing
who's arriving, who's lingering and who's leaving together. Often,
the lunch restaurant in the courtyard outside is the next step.</TE>
<TE>   "Singles meet at the museum all the time," said head waiter Larry
Zeno. "I see the results. People come for drinks or coffee, [and]
leave together." He added singles are easy to spot because of "the
way they make eye contact with other people."</TE>
<TE>   For a voyeur, the action is cinematic. "You see two people on the
opposite ends of the room, and then you see them at the cafe later,"
said the MOCA staffer. "It's become my Robert Altman movie."</TE>
<TE>   The scene at LACMA on a recent Friday: about 200 people on folding
chairs or crowded around the bar, watching a contemporary jazz band,
and one another.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely a singles scene," said Sean Martin, one of the
bartenders mixing apple martinis. "You see the jazz cats and the
women all dolled up."</TE>
<TE>   Max Draitser, a 28-year-old (single) attorney, observed from the
edge of the crowd while he waited for a couple of friends. Meeting
other singles, he said, takes a concerted effort. "It doesn't happen
casually in L.A.," he said. "Historically, this has been a singles
scene," he added about the LACMA courtyard. And although he had come
for the jazz and a meeting with friends, he had his eyes open. "You
always wonder if someone's single," he said.</TE>
<TE>   One volunteer at the event, Sheila Gonzaga, a public affairs
consultant in her mid-30s who was manning an information desk,
recently began dating someone she met at a museum event. He brought
her a glass of champagne, "and we talked from there."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike San Francisco and New York, this city doesn't offer many
alternatives to bars for singles, Gonzaga said. Friends have told her
the supermarket is a lively pickup scene but, she said, "I have never
had luck at the Ralphs. Maybe I'm focusing too much on the condiments
or picking a really good lettuce."</TE>
<TE>   The museum, she said, is much better.</TE>
<TE>   As a volunteer at the museum, Gonzaga often tries to persuade her
philistine friends to come along to events there.</TE>
<TE>   "When I find out someone is recently single, I sell it to them,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   And her pitch?</TE>
<TE>   "An environment that allows for stimulating conversation.
Psychological candy as much as eye candy," she said. "A lot of really
interesting, good-looking people."</TE>
<TE>   The final sell: "Just pretend you're going to a bar."</TE>
<TE>   Like LACMA, many museums become part-time bars as they host social
events--membership parties, jazz nights and film nights--to draw a
younger crowd. And just as those events can be a pretext for getting
people past the ticket booth, art frequently becomes the pretext for
bringing people together, said Brian Langston, marketing director for
the Orange County Museum of Art in Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "At our hipper openings, there's a lot of, for lack of a better
term, hooking up," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After all, conversation starters line the wall.</TE>
<TE>   Some visitors will be attracted to the same work of art. Or,
Langston said, "mutually revolted by something, and that's common
ground, too."</TE>
<TE>   And, for people on the prowl, it's less obvious.</TE>
<TE>   "When you go to a bar, it's not to have a drink. It's not to play
darts. And everybody knows that," Langston said. "When you go to a
museum, you can at least conceive of yourself, and be seen as, going
there for something else."</TE>
<TE>   Langston is philosophical about museum encounters. "Part of what
makes a museum a profound place is, it's a town square. If they're
coming to meet other people, that's just fine," he said. "I don't
think that's tacky or tawdry."</TE>
<TE>   Ellen Brill browsed around the MOCA store before meeting a couple
of friends.</TE>
<TE>   "You feel less intimidated to talk to people if you have a common
interest," she said. Art "is a universal language, like music. You
can turn around, and ask [others] if they like the show."</TE>
<TE>   Connections made, the museums have occasionally become a backdrop
for unfolding romance. Art lovers Heidi Toll, 35, and Daniel
Cunningham, 31, had been amused by the white billboards with cryptic
messages, scattered around the city like art labels, an ad campaign
created by TBWA/Chiat/Day Los Angeles to promote MOCA.</TE>
<TE>   So when Cunningham, who works in real estate, decided to propose,
he enlisted the museum staff to display a mock billboard on the side
of the MOCA ticket office. He lured Toll with the ruse that they were
seeing an exhibition, but she learned his real intent when she saw
the oversize billboard, with the words: "Marriage Proposal. Man on
knee, woman crying, platinum and carbon. A gift forever. Courtesy of
the Museum of Contemporary Art, 2001."</TE>
<TE>   She said yes, and on Saturday, the two were married at the
Wilshire Ebell Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   On a conference call, the couple said those coming upon the
proposal by chance were unsure if it was art or life.</TE>
<TE>   Both, Cunningham said.</TE>
<TE>   "We became a piece of art," he said. "Very conceptual," she added.</TE>

<HD>The Real Deal in Furniture These Days? It's Plastic</HD>
<DH>Design: The synthetic material has evolved along with the
many mass-produced yet stylish products it has inspired over the
years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN KLAGES</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL>MILAN</DL>
<LD>You would think it were some sort of wonder material. The way hotshot
European designers and furniture manufacturers have taken up with
plastic over the last decade--each year more jubilantly--it would
seem as though this couldn't be the stuff of Tupperware and ordinary
life.</LD>
<LD>   And the answer is: It isn't ... and it is.</LD>
<LD>   The plastic that is being molded into "designer" furniture these
days, such as at Milan's furniture fair this spring, represents some
of the most cutting-edge advances in science and technology to hit
this segment of the furniture world since its heyday in the 1970s.</LD>
<TE>   It was then that manufacturers such as Kartell of Italy started to
harness the molding process and more complex plastics to create
stylish synthetic furniture that could be mass-produced.</TE>
<TE>   (By definition, just about any synthetic, nonmetallic material
that can be molded or shaped is a plastic--and that would include
nylon, acrylic, polycarbonate and a whole slew of poly-this or
-that.)</TE>
<TE>   But the oil crisis (most plastics being petroleum-derived) dealt
fantastic plastic an image problem that way outlasted any shortages.
And although Kartell and Magis, another important Italian plastic
product maker, never stopped experimenting, there was no groundswell
of interest in chic plastic furniture, particularly among American
consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Fast forward to the late '80s and early '90s.</TE>
<TE>   And add big-name designers Philippe Starck and Ron Arad to the
picture.</TE>
<TE>   On a mission to bring good design to the masses, Starck created
several high-style plastic chairs for Italian manufacturers, who were
able to bring them to market for around $150 apiece.</TE>
<TE>   Arad, working with Kartell, performed similar magic with his
Bookworm bookshelf--originally done in steel as limited-edition
furniture, now refashioned in affordable plastic.</TE>
<TE>   The design world stood in awe. Consumers ate it up. And a plastic
revival was born.</TE>
<TE>   These days, everybody who's anybody in international design is
doing something groundbreaking in plastic seating, tables or even
cabinetry.</TE>
<TE>   But the plastic they're working with "has evolved drastically"
from the 1970s, according to Ivan Luini, president of Kartell US
Inc., whose sales are booming this side of the Atlantic. And now in
the retail business as well, Kartell will have six namesake stores
selling high-design plastic furniture in the U.S. by year's end, with
talk of two more stores in the works. (Kartell's collection already
is available here at a number of stores.)</TE>
<TE>   "There are plastics now that were not available back then," Luini
continues. Such as: a kind of polypropylene (normally hard and dense
like wood) that feels cushy like foam, but isn't. Last spring in
Milan, Kartell introduced a spongy plastic chair made from the
techno-polymer.</TE>
<TE>   And there are new production techniques too.</TE>
<TE>   "What I am impressed with in what a company like Magis does or
what Kartell does, is that they are using plastic as a noble
material"--not as a cheap substitute for something else, says Alan
Heller, the uncommon American doing designer plastics.</TE>
<TE>   The molten material allows for shapes and designs that simply
could not be done in any other material, says Heller, whose New
York-based company works with Italian maestro Mario Bellini and other
top European designers to create Modern plastic furniture.
Manufacturing is done in Iowa and Italy.</TE>
<TE>   But nodding again to his counterparts overseas, Heller credits the
Italian manufacturers for "experimenting with all different sorts of
processes" to mold, blow and even spin plastic to new levels of chic.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the Italians were the first to produce plastic
furniture by injection molding, so that a chair or table is formed in
one sleek, seamless piece. The process is a careful choreography
between hot molten plastic and the rate at which it is injected into
a big steel-and-aluminum mold--too slow and the plastic will dry
before it reaches the edges of the mold; too fast and it will be
uneven.</TE>
<TE>   Rotational molding (previously used to make dolls and soccer
balls) is one of the most recent triumphs of the Italian furniture
world. It allows for the mass production of large plastic furniture
that is hollow and therefore less costly and cumbersome. In a
technique similar to the one used to make hollow chocolate Easter
eggs, plastic powder is dispersed by centrifugal force through a hot
mold that rotates randomly on several axes. After a matter of
minutes, the powder evenly coats the walls of the mold--and a chair
or sofa is sprung free, holding secret its empty inside.</TE>
<TE>   It was Heller, though, that pioneered the gas-molded plastic
chair, using a process previously wedded to the making of small
components and plastic bottles.</TE>
<TE>   Simply put, it is "injection molding with gas technology,"
explains Heller. The gas "pushes" the molten plastic out of certain
parts of the mold, creating vacuous tubes that are both lightweight
and strong.</TE>
<TE>   The result: Heller's now-iconic Bellini chair (introduced in
1998), a Minimalist beauty with delicate legs of
fiberglass-reinforced polypropylene. Bellini used the new technology
as part of the design process.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line for most consumers is a lot simpler than all of
this, though. It is the fact that plastic is cheap.</TE>
<TE>   Combined with creative technology and design minds that are eager
to push the limits, plastic has opened up the chic world of European
design to the Average Consumer of Average Pocketbook.</TE>
<TE>   And that, quite frankly, is noblest.</TE>

<DH>Literacy: More children ages 5 and younger are being read
to--a practice that experts say gives them a head start in life.</DH>

<LD>If you're wondering whether it pays to read aloud to preschoolers,
listen to this: "I'm A-S-H-L-E-Y and I'm 4. One, two, three, four."</LD>
<LD>   That's how Ashley Davis introduced herself at a recent Tuesday
morning story time where she and her grandmother, Rose Torigian, are
regulars. They go to the read-to-me hour at the Borders bookstore in
Northridge, where 30 or more kids and grown-ups crowd the children's
department. There are thousands of other programs like it in stores,
libraries and day-care centers around the country.</LD>
<LD>   Encouraging family members to read to toddlers, babies and even
unborn infants has turned into a national cause in recent years.
Everyone from doctors to celebrities is pushing the idea with
favorite projects and national ad campaigns. A new government report
suggests those efforts might be making a difference. The annual
survey on America's children issued this month by the Federal
Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics shows that 58% of
preschoolers 5 and younger are being read to on a regular basis by
grown-ups in the family. That is 5 percentage points higher than in
1993. The survey is based on household interviews and represents a
cross-section of economic, ethnic and education levels.</LD>
<TE>   "It seems so obvious that you should read to your children," Gina
Eckstein-Green, mother of Gibson, said at story hour in Northridge.
"Gibby" is a 2-year-old who already has his own library card and
burns through three books a night with his mother.</TE>
<TE>   What is obvious to some parents, however, is sometimes news to
others. Overworked parents and those who barely speak English or are
short on reading skills of their own are much more likely to send
their kindergarteners off to school with little experience with
books, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Some reading experts, although encouraged by the findings in the
new government report, say it is more optimistic than other published
studies on children's literacy. Even if more children are being read
to, nationwide reading scores for primary school-age children have
not improved significantly in the last decade. For example,
California's youngest students have made strides in the last three
years but remain far behind national averages on standard tests.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Tralease, a Massachusetts-based author and lecturer on
reading, is among those who say their experience in the field
suggests there is a long way to go. His latest project is to push for
an ad campaign about the harsh effects of failing to help children
learn.</TE>
<TE>   "Like the smoking campaign that gave us death-bed confessionals,"
he says. "Learn-to-read ads have to get mean, down and dirty. If your
child can't read he'll fail in school, he's more likely to drop out,
he'll probably end up in jail."</TE>
<TE>   Tralease travels the country drilling parents and teachers on how
to make words and stories a priority for their children. Fewer trips
to the video store, more time in the public library would help, he
says. But the basic problem is harder to fix. As a rule, children's
literacy levels reflect their parents' income brackets. "The number
of words that a 4-year-old knows varies tremendously from one
economic group to another," says Tralease, adding that studies show
that children from wealthy families are likely to have more than
three times the vocabulary of children from low-income families.</TE>
<TE>   To close the gap, Tralease advises that parents who aren't able to
give their children everything to read to them about everything.
That, or listen to books on tape with their children. Either way, he
urges, "bring the book home and turn the pages with your child. If
there aren't any books in the house it's kind of hard for a kid to
learn how to read."</TE>
<TE>   If more toddlers are getting exposure to new words and stories at
an early age, Tralease gives credit to an army of experts and
volunteers bent on improving standards. Everyone from First Lady
Laura Bush to Hollywood producer Rob Reiner with his celebrity
friends, Jamie Lee Curtis and Maria Shriver, promote reading
programs. Pediatricians are starting to assess the learning abilities
of toddlers as part of wellness care and to hand out free children's
books in the waiting room.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe all these programs together are having an effect," says
Suzanne Flint, director of Reach Out and Read, a national program
with 110 doctors offices involved in California. "The range of
different approaches allows fewer people to fall through the cracks."</TE>
<TE>   Progress may be slower than some advocates wish, but it is
radically different from earlier decades. In the 1920s, Flint says,
parents were warned against teaching their toddlers to read at all.
"The idea was to respect the limits of 'neural ripening' and hold
back until the child is at least 6. That, or risk causing brain
damage."</TE>
<TE>   Attitudes spun around in the '60s when Project Head Start, the
government-funded program for underprivileged children, emphasized
"reading readiness" for preschoolers. Libraries took up the campaign
and Carla Hayden found her true calling. She is the incoming
president of the American Library Assn. with 66,700 members, and the
director of the 21-branch public library system in Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still a children's librarian at heart," Hayden says. She
began her library career 23 years ago and caught the trends as they
came along. "The '70s brought on a revolution in reading," she
remembers. "The idea was, children need to be ready to learn when
they start school. Big picture books with simple stories came into
fashion for 3- and 5-year-olds. The big thing then was to get
children away from their parents to teach them. There were lots of
tears."</TE>
<TE>   Research in the '80s brought more fine-tuning. "The concept of the
parent as the first teacher became important," Hayden says.
Mommy-and-me story time and reading-with-grandparents programs
started up in public libraries.</TE>
<TE>   Emotional ties were added to the formula in the '90s after studies
showed that parents bond with their children when they hold them in
their lap, read to them and talk to them about the story.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea became, 'It's never too early,' " says Hayden. "We had
to have parents and children together at story time. There were basic
issues, like changing diapers."</TE>
<TE>   At the higher end of the economic scale, children's bookstores
have become a new kind of social club for kids. Los Angeles now has
no fewer than six, with puppet shows, story hours, music and crafts
dates to fill up the weekly calendar. "California is unique for the
number of children's bookstores," says Tracy van Straaten of Simon &amp;
Schuster. "There is one children's bookstore in New York City."</TE>
<TE>   There are around 5,000 children's books published every year, and
board books for toddlers are a growing niche, Van Straaten says.
Sandra Boynton's "Moo Baa La-La-La" has sold more than a million
copies. She has three other mega-sellers.</TE>
<TE>   Ian Falconer's first picture book, "Olivia," introduced a
precocious piglet and sold more than a million copies. He has
followed it up this spring with two more adventures, both of them
board books. "It's to reach a younger audience," says Van Straaten of
the switch. "The board books are for Olivia's younger siblings."</TE>
<TE>   Tralease sees better days ahead. "It takes a generation to bring
about a cultural shift," he allows. "We got hundreds of thousands of
people off cigarettes, but it didn't happen overnight. Now we've got
the first generation of families--even at-risk families--reading with
their kids. That's a big plus."</TE>

<HD>Shoveling Guilt Onto the Working Mom's Pile</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you're a mom reading this at work and your baby is in child care
right now, brace yourself for more bad news from the front lines of
the battle over working mothers.</LD>
<LD>   A new analysis of the most comprehensive child-care study ever
conducted suggests that young children of mothers who work full time
wind up intellectually behind those whose mothers work less or not at
all.</LD>
<LD>   The news puts moms "between a rock and a hard place," admits
researcher Jeanne Brooks-Gunn of Columbia's Teachers College, the
lead author of the report.</LD>
<TE>   It is, indeed, more grist for the guilt already felt by working
mothers. I remember my own desperate search for reassurance, when I
went back to work after my first child. I'd sit at my desk and
anxiously tally the hours my 6-month-old spent with me and with the
sitter--subtracting for naps, adding for middle-of-the-night
feedings--until I had convinced myself that I was spending more time
with my baby than a stranger was.</TE>
<TE>   I'm only glad I didn't know then what research shows now:
Full-time work by mom in the first nine months of a baby's life can
stall the young child's intellectual development.</TE>
<TE>   Other studies have made similar findings, but attributed the
deleterious effects to factors such as a bad home environment,
insensitive mothers or inadequate child care.</TE>
<TE>   This analysis controlled for those factors and still found that
the children of mothers who work full time in their babies' first
nine months score lower at age 3 on school readiness measures than
the children whose mothers stayed at home.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, it might be the mother's absence, not the child's
home life or the day-care setting, that is apt to lower a child's IQ.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers analyzed data from a three-year child-care study
of 1,000 families in 10 cities. The good news is that children of
mothers who worked part-time, or who delayed full-time work until
their children were 12 months old, scored the same on tests of school
readiness as the kids of nonworking moms. The negative effects showed
up only among children whose mothers worked more than 30 hours a week
by the time the child was 9 months old. The bad news is, that's most
of us.</TE>
<TE>   Today, more than half of all mothers are back at work before their
babies are 3 months old. In the study sample of white, mostly
middle-class families from around the country, 55% of the mothers
were working full time by their children's third month and 71% by the
sixth month. Three-quarters of the mothers of 9-month-olds had gone
back to work full time.</TE>
<TE>   At 3 years old, the children of those working mothers scored an
average of 6 points lower on tests that measured such things as their
knowledge of colors, letters, numbers and shapes, and their facility
with abstract reasoning.</TE>
<TE>   That's considered a significant difference in social science
terms, one that evidence shows could correspond to lagging
development through a child's elementary years. "From a policy
perspective, it's a concern because you're talking about millions of
children possibly falling behind," explained Brooks-Gunn.</TE>
<TE>   But what does that really mean to working moms? Not much, unless
we're trying to get the kid into a preschool that treats kindergarten
readiness tests with the same import colleges treat the SAT.</TE>
<TE>   I suspect my kids started school behind. I was one of those
mothers who had to return to work when each of my three babies was 6
months old. My youngest still recalls feeling bewildered on her first
day of school when everyone else could write their names "and I was
wondering what all those squiggles were." That sixth-grader is now
near the top of her class. Same kid, same school, same working mom.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks-Gunn agrees that "individual parents shouldn't be hugely
concerned" by a 3-year-old's low score. "There's so much change that
happens over time, and with high-quality child care and a good,
sensitive mother, the difference essentially disappears."</TE>
<TE>   But while the campaign to expand and improve child-care options
has been heating up in recent years, the notion of supporting mothers
in their efforts to be "good, sensitive parents" hasn't gotten as
much attention.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to be "sensitive" to a youngster's needs when you're
stressed out from a long day at work, a grueling commute and the
pressure of trying to cram laundry and cooking and grocery shopping
into the too-few hours you have with your baby.</TE>
<TE>   The study's authors have heard from hordes of angry mothers since
it was published earlier this month in a child development journal.
"They say 'I don't like this study. It puts the burden on us,' " says
Brooks-Gunn, a working mother who was back on the job by the time her
son--now 12--was 3 months old. "I understand how they feel. But the
reality is the burden is on [working mothers], even though the
majority don't have the option not to work.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of saying 'I feel terrible. I feel guilty,' maybe they
can take these results and advocate for [national] family leave
policies that create more options for mothers of babies. Every other
industrialized nation has done it. Why can't we?"</TE>
<TE>   And support may come from surprising quarters, according to one of
the study's least-publicized findings.</TE>
<TE>   Child care in this country is an emotional issue and mothers are
assigned to one of two camps--those who work and dump their kids on
someone else, and those who stay home and tend their children full
time.</TE>
<TE>   But the researchers discovered, to their surprise, that one-third
of the nonworking mothers studied put their babies in day care for
long periods of time. "I was so shocked, I had somebody recheck the
numbers," said Brooks-Gunn.</TE>
<TE>   "These are mothers who don't work but have their kids in child
care [an average of] 18 hours a week by the time their babies are 12
months old. Who are these women? I'm really curious about that, but
we haven't studied it enough to know."</TE>
<TE>   Does that suggest that divisions between us are easing; that
working moms seeking better child care can find allies now among
stay-at-home mothers? Maybe ... or maybe it just confirms what most
mothers know: Raising children is demanding work, and every mom needs
a break sometimes.</TE>

<DH>Part 2 / The story so far: Jason has accidentally broken
Old Crabby's window.</DH>

<LD>Old Crabby stood with her arms akimbo, glaring at Jason.</LD>
<LD>   "I didn't mean to do it," he mumbled.</LD>
<LD>   "That won't fix my window," she snapped. "What do you intend to do
about it?"</LD>
<TE>   Jason shuffled his feet. "I'll find a job and earn some money,
somehow."</TE>
<TE>   Old Crabby shrugged. "I bet if I want my window fixed, I'll have
to give you a job myself."</TE>
<TE>   She jerked her head toward the door. "Come on in. I pay $2 an hour
to anyone under the age of 10. You must be how old now ... 7 ... 8?"</TE>
<TE>   "Almost 9," said Jason, following her inside.</TE>
<TE>   Old Crabby's living room was dark and crowded with furniture. She
disappeared through a doorway at the far end of the room and came
back carrying a cloth and a tin of what looked like butter.</TE>
<TE>   "Here," she said. "You can start by polishing the piano. Take a
dab of this beeswax on the cloth and rub it on the wood."</TE>
<TE>   She added sternly, "And don't let the wax get on anything but the
wood or I'll boil you in oil!"</TE>
<TE>   Jason scowled and scooped some of the wax onto the cloth and began
to rub it on the piano.</TE>
<TE>   He thought of the fun his friend Pete was having at camp while he
was stuck inside doing grubby work for Old Crabby. The beeswax
smelled like honey and as he rubbed it into the wood he could see the
colors begin to deepen and glow.</TE>
<TE>   He started working around the pedals, then up the legs until he
got to the keyboard with its row of white and black keys.</TE>
<TE>   His elbow brushed one of the keys and a wonderful, bell-like sound
filled the room. It was the most beautiful sound he'd ever heard. He
wiped his hands with the clean edge of the cloth and touched another
key. Another wonderful sound, deeper this time.</TE>
<TE>   He ran both hands up and down the keyboard, from high sweet notes
down to rumbling sounds of thunder.</TE>
<TE>   Old Crabby's voice made him jump. "What is that caterwauling? That
is not what I'm paying you for."</TE>
<TE>   Jason grabbed up his cloth and began polishing again.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't want to lose this job and never be able to touch that
piano again.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday: Will Old Crabby fire Jason?</TE>
<TE>   Mary Louise Downer agrees with the Scottish historian and essayist
Thomas Carlyle, who said more than 100 years ago, "Music is well said
to be the speech of angels." This story will be on The Times' Web
site at www.latimes.com/kids.</TE>

<HD>Sabotaging Security for a Buck</HD>
<DH>Industry urged computer exports that would aid nuclear
proliferation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY MILHOLLIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The scandals on Wall Street have taught us that industry tells lies,
that our government does not protect us from those lies and that the
result can be bad for our pocketbooks. The same process can also
increase the nuclear threat to our nation.</LD>
<LD>   In a report scheduled for release this week, the U.S. General
Accounting Office concludes that the Bush administration made a
dangerous mistake on nuclear arms proliferation.</LD>
<LD>   According to the GAO, the administration improperly relied on
false industry data to lower the barriers on the export of the United
States' most powerful computers--machines that could be used to build
the most fearsome weapons that terrorists could get their hands on.</LD>
<TE>   The report shows how a computer industry lobbying group co-chaired
by an official of Unisys Corp. duped the White House at the expense
of the nation's security.</TE>
<TE>   In August 2001, the group wrote a letter asking the government to
make it easier to export powerful computers to countries such as
China, India, Russia and Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is important to national security. The GAO writes that
the "availability of overall computing power to a nuclear weapon
design program is critical" and that powerful computers "would be of
significant use to China's designers in examining likely gaps in
their nuclear weapon science."</TE>
<TE>   The industry's letter claimed that U.S. controls had to be
weakened to keep American firms competitive. Why? Because a new
generation of computer servers was about to hit the market. Each
would contain 32 of the new Itanium chips, made by Intel Corp.</TE>
<TE>   By early 2002, these servers would be marketed by companies all
over the world. The new computers would do 190 billion operations per
second, more than twice as many as computers formerly controlled for
export from the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, according to the group, unless the government raised the
control level for U.S.-origin computers to 190 billion, U.S.
companies might lose business to foreign competitors.</TE>
<TE>   The claim was bogus.</TE>
<TE>   The GAO interviewed 10 companies that the industry cited as ready
to sell these computers in 2002. It found that nine "would not
introduce these servers in 2002 or had no plans to manufacture these
servers due to the lack of software and a market for such powerful
servers."</TE>
<TE>   Only one was ready: Unisys. No foreign company was, and no other
American company was. Thus, no American firm ever risked losing
business, and the whole case for weakening controls was a sham.</TE>
<TE>   Why, then, did our government agree?</TE>
<TE>   That's what's frightening. Our federal watchdogs, which are
supposed to guard us against terrorists and the spread of the bomb,
swallowed this industry fable whole, without so much as a cautionary
sniff.</TE>
<TE>   The decision "was based not on an independent analysis but rather
on information provided by industry," writes the GAO. Officials at
the Commerce Department, which is in charge of finding out what is
really available from foreign competitors, admitted they didn't even
try. "Industry," they told the GAO, "made its case informally."</TE>
<TE>   The GAO found that the officials had relied on nothing more than
the letter from the computer industry lobbying group.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, this is not the first time the U.S. has lowered
computer controls. The Clinton administration did so a number of
times without justification and got hammered by the GAO for decisions
that "lacked empirical evidence or analysis."</TE>
<TE>   The reason this keeps happening is simple: campaign money.</TE>
<TE>   The computer industry shells out millions of dollars annually to
both political parties. It expects, and gets, something in return.</TE>
<TE>   How does this sellout harm us?</TE>
<TE>   First, it sabotages our fight against terrorism. We can't ask our
allies to keep dangerous equipment away from terrorists and the
countries that support them if we don't control our own sales. In
fact, the GAO found that we unilaterally lowered our controls without
the consent of our partners in the only international pact--the
Wassenaar Arrangement--that tries to confine computer sales to
responsible buyers. All the other countries in this pact still
control computers at much lower operating levels, which makes the
United States a rogue exporter, as well as a unilateralist.</TE>
<TE>   Second, the new computers are highly potent. The GAO found that
they were more powerful than the machines now performing 98% of the
Pentagon's military computing functions. And sending them off to
places such as Pakistan, where they could boost the production of
nuclear warheads, only increases the number of nukes that we have to
worry about going astray.</TE>
<TE>   As for Unisys, it can't be expected to use restraint. Before the
Gulf War, it sold Iraq's interior ministry an $8-million computer
system specifically capable of tracking the Iraqi population, which
could still be helping Saddam Hussein stay in power.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to change the rules came three months after Sept. 11,
which means that, despite all the brave words, money was more
important than security to the White House.</TE>

<HD>The Hero Rides Back Into Town</HD>
<DH>Macho men find new appreciation in times of peril.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES P. PINKERTON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They roped themselves together so they would be found together. That
is, they would live or die as a band of brothers, under 240 feet of
Pennsylvania limestone.</LD>
<LD>   So how did those nine trapped coal miners survive in the cold
water, in the darkness, for 77 hours?</LD>
<LD>   "At any certain time, maybe one guy got down, and then the rest
pulled together," recalled one of the rescued miners Sunday. "And
then that guy would get back up. It was a team effort."</LD>
<TE>   When the drillers broke through, one of the miners shouted:
"There's nine men ready to get the hell out of here. We need some
chew."</TE>
<TE>   Chewing tobacco?</TE>
<TE>   That's men for you, fraternal enough to save lives, macho enough
to be jaunty in the face of death, manly enough to be politically
incorrect.</TE>
<TE>   Male virtues and values have never really changed, but after
decades of disdain, Americans are seeing the natural ways of men in a
new and more positive light.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the fate of manual labor and danger. The kind of mostly
testosteronal toil that digs up coal or merely wears out one's back
has been on the downswing for a long time.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 134.1 million Americans with jobs in June 2002, barely more
than a quarter of them could be called blue-collar. Employment in the
coal industry has plummeted; just 37,663 coal miners made their
living working underground in 2000, down 90% from half a century ago.</TE>
<TE>   As the economy shifted from industrial to informational, much of
the culture shifted too.</TE>
<TE>   The media celebrated new kinds of heroes, Wall Streeters,
dot-commers, TV-talkers.</TE>
<TE>   And yet many of those with the softest hands never lost their
atavistic yearning to recapture the sweaty, risky ways of the past.
That's why books such as "Young Men &amp; Fire," by Norman Maclean, and
"The Perfect Storm," by Sebastian Junger, became bestsellers.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, postindustrial men--and yes, a fair number of women--have
gotten into the act themselves, forsaking their keyboard careers for
a wild ride on the far side. But then came the real thing.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 11, Americans were reminded of the value of valor.</TE>
<TE>   Why would firefighters, overwhelmingly male, go running up the
stairs of the World Trade Center when everybody else was running
down?</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Springsteen, on the cover of this week's Time magazine, is
releasing an album centered on the events in the Twin Towers: "The
disorientation on that staircase, the load on your back, the
heaviness of the equipment, the sense of duty, of responsibility." He
wondered about those heroes, and then he wrote songs celebrating
them.</TE>
<TE>   Thus the paradox of our present moment. On the one hand, economic
trends diminish blue-collar work. And yet on the other hand, even as
the blues fade away, the culture lionizes them and their qualities.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the news media depend on them for ratings-drawing drama.</TE>
<TE>   Where would local and cable news be without cops chasing crooks
and emergency workers rescuing miners?</TE>
<TE>   But for all the coverage, most Americans--including this American,
who sits in an office risking little more than a paper cut--are left
to wonder about the deep wellsprings of courage and determination
that bubble up in men.</TE>
<TE>   One window into that world is the new movie "K-19: The
Widowmaker," the mostly true story of a Soviet submarine that nearly
sank in Arctic waters in 1961, saved only by the self-sacrifice of
seven crewmen.</TE>
<TE>   What made those sailors so brave?</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the film, Harrison Ford, who plays the boat's
skipper, offers a toast and an explanation. "When the time came, it
was their duty, not to a method, or to the state, but to us, their
comrades."</TE>
<TE>   So maybe it's that most ancient of attributes, male bonding, that
even today makes men into brothers, and then into heroes. It's
tragic, perhaps, that we need such men, but it's a good thing that we
have them.</TE>

<HD>Honest Portrayals of Sept. 11 Risk Pain and Anger</HD>
<DH>Filmmakers with integrity will not sugarcoat their
memorials.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVEN ROSENBAUM</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is one certainty the first anniversary of Sept. 11 will bring:
a plethora of memorial films and TV specials built around the
still-stunning images from that day.</LD>
<LD>   And there will be a second level of films that use the imagery not
just to retell the story but to explore ideas and attitudes in an
attempt to get below the surface of the initial horror.</LD>
<LD>   Here is another certainty: As filmmakers veer from the familiar
news images and begin to explore the deeper aspects of the event, we
will be accused of exploiting the nation's pain and sensationalizing
a tragedy.</LD>
<TE>   In turn, we will argue that we are making films in the hope and
expectation that we can stir emotions and raise new ideas and
perspectives as we revisit the past.</TE>
<TE>   In an assault where almost 3,000 people died and tens of thousands
more were victims, it's not an inappropriate question to ask whether
filmmakers have any special responsibility to heed the sensitivities
of the survivors and the memories of the dead.</TE>
<TE>   But as a filmmaker who has made television documentaries and a
feature film about the events and aftermath of Sept. 11, the more
time I spend immersed in the awful material, the more I realize that
we need to be extraordinarily careful before we sanitize the images
out of a misplaced concern at giving offense.</TE>
<TE>   We filmmakers are not the custodians of the official story, but
storytellers who use our medium to express the truth as we see it.
The moment we become politicians, we give up our claim to honest,
creative expression.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the decision the producers of HBO's "In Memoriam"
made to air footage of people jumping from the burning buildings was
initially decried. However, those who saw the film recognized that it
provided for the first time a true sense of the horrors of that day.
Indeed, what we learned from "In Memoriam" was that, while we had
been deluged with information about Sept. 11, the depth of our
knowledge was surprisingly shallow.</TE>
<TE>   We're only just beginning the process of uncovering the detail of
what happened, through the individual stories of bravery, shock,
despair and recovery.</TE>
<TE>   And that detail matters because it changes our perspectives in a
very real way. It replaces the theoretical horror of the event with
powerful images, sounds and emotions.</TE>
<TE>   As we've sifted through thousands of hours of footage for our own
film, the bromides about bravery become the specifics of personal
decisions that meant safety or danger.</TE>
<TE>   Presenting all the chaos and shock of the environment in which
those decisions were made was the only way viewers could understand
those choices.</TE>
<TE>   It would be simple as filmmakers to take the easy way out, to
create broad-stroke, glowing tributes to the fallen, airbrushed with
the appropriate reverence. But that would be the ultimate disservice
to the victims and their survivors.</TE>
<TE>   It is the heart-rending pictures from World War II, from
remarkable filmmakers like George Stevens, that have kept alive the
valor of the soldiers and the suffering of the victims.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, feature films like "Saving Private Ryan" and "Schindler's
List," with their graphic, uncompromising imagery, have only served
to heighten our regard and sympathy for the protagonists.</TE>
<TE>   So, as filmmakers, we owe it to our own artistic integrity not to
compromise when confronted with the prospect of hurting someone's
feelings or the idea of going too far. If we push the envelope by
being true to our craft, that is not simply a hazard of the path we
have chosen but the only way that the real story--messy, disjointed,
inspiring, embarrassing--gets to be told.</TE>

<LD>Thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of
thy neighbor by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord God.</LD>
<LD>   --Ezekiel 22:12</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   The Bible be damned is the considered judgment of the U.S.
Congress. Not that the legislators spelled out such a proclamation,
of course, but that is the spirit with which our leaders have made
their latest offering at the temple of the money changers.</TE>
<TE>   By pushing through a credit card industry-backed bankruptcy bill
that punishes victims of usury paying almost 30% interest, the
Beltway boys and girls have again made it clear who butters their
toast: the same CEOs who have expressed shock and dismay with each
revelation of abusive business practices in their ranks.</TE>
<TE>   The timing is also peculiarly callous. With our "jobless recovery"
and the stock market slide, escalating health-care and drug costs,
bankruptcies like that of WorldCom and thousands of layoffs, many
American workers will soon find that their government has just made
it much harder for them to receive the fresh financial start that
centuries of law have established as a necessary tool of a
functioning free market.</TE>
<TE>   Those currently facing ruin caused by an unexpectedly long period
of unemployment, a death in the family, divorce or some unforeseeable
disaster have caught a slight break in that final passage of the
legislative "reform" may have been delayed--not by moral concern but
rather because members of the House are eager to depart for their
summer vacations.</TE>
<TE>   When they return after Labor Day, however, the bill is almost
certain to be sent for approval to the president--whose top campaign
contributor was MBNA, a major purveyor of credit cards. In the next
few weeks, consumers should examine this legislation, which the media
have until recently ignored, and then they should set a fire under
the people who claim to represent them.</TE>
<TE>   President Clinton vetoed similar legislation for being too hard on
consumers with low and moderate incomes.</TE>
<TE>   No belt-tightening has been applied to Chapter 11, the portion of
the bankruptcy law that large corporations employ. The end result is
that a company like Enron gets to protect the wealth of its top
people while its fired workers and money-losing investors find it
hard to obtain relief.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps this would have been more acceptable if consumers received
some compensating protections. The legislation does nothing to cap
the exorbitant credit card interest rates that banks now legally
charge, nor does it curtail blatantly deceptive marketing tactics
designed to trap in debt the young, the desperate and the gullible.</TE>
<TE>   When organized crime engages in practices like these, it is called
loan sharking and is punishable as a felony. Banks don't break
kneecaps; instead they recruit the government as a debt collector for
greedy money lenders who make unwise loans.</TE>
<TE>   Banks have been completely irresponsible in their loan policies.
When consumers started borrowing less, the banks flooded the market
with tricky offers of "debt consolidation," low-interest starter
loans and "convenience checks." This aggressive marketing appealed
largely to people who could not afford to carry more debt--something
a lender is supposed to factor into its calculations before handing
over money.</TE>
<TE>   Then, with their customers squeezed by ever-higher interest rates
allowed in the small print--even as the prime rate was shifted far
downward--the profits of banks' credit card operations soared. Now,
still making out like bandits, these lenders want the government to
strong-arm their debtors.</TE>
<TE>   The money changers who, in the words of the folk song, rob you
with a fountain pen instead of a gun are legal and have bought off
the leaders of both parties to make the law a servant of their
avarice. Take the case of Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), who last year was
complaining publicly about the banks' credit card rip-offs. Yet he
now hails this atrocious bill as "a victory for women" because he
managed to soften language that would have allowed those
successfully sued by abortion clinics to avoid financial
responsibility. What a crock! Are women not debtors?</TE>
<TE>   We are a nation that rose up to smash the indentured servitude,
debtors prisons and poorhouses that were the hallmark of the king of
England's oppression. If the banks want to make bad loans with their
own money, that is their business, but they should not be allowed to
rely on the power of the state to force payment. As those melodramas
that were the hallmark of the early American theater established, the
sheriffs should be protecting destitute widows, not tossing them out
on the street.</TE>
<TE>   Congress and the president have made a big deal about this being
one nation under God, but what sort of God do they have in mind?
Certainly not the one speaking in Ezekiel 18:8, which defines the
just soul as "he that hath not given forth upon usury ... that hath
withdrawn his hand from inequity." Amen.</TE>

<HD>He's Got a Beef --and a Pig and a Chicken</HD>
<DH>A reader wonders if all that stuff flying out of big rigs
carrying animals on the freeways is a health hazard.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's bad enough that beleaguered Southern California motorists must
tolerate jackknifed big rigs, police pursuits and slow-moving
tourists in barge-sized RVs. Now a reader suggests an even more
repulsive nuisance plaguing our freeways.</LD>
<LD>   Brian Persson, a Los Angeles-area contractor, wrote to Behind the
Wheel to complain that he often finds himself stuck in traffic behind
hulking big rigs packed with livestock. And the stuff that flies out
of these rigs doesn't exactly smell like baby's breath, he said.</LD>
<LD>   Persson asks what rules govern truckers who let that foul
discharge loose all over the freeways.</LD>
<TE>   Question: "I wonder how many illnesses (be they temporary or
worse) result from these trucks."</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Granted, animal waste can be offensive to the olfactory
nerves, but health officials say there is little chance of
contracting an illness--such as E. coli--from flying freeway dung.</TE>
<TE>   "You can never say never, but I'm unaware of any cases of
transmission that way," said the Los Angeles County public health
director, Jonathan Fielding, who couldn't help laughing at the
question.</TE>
<TE>   The state Vehicle Code prohibits truck drivers from spilling
material onto the freeway. The only two things permitted to fall from
trucks are clear water and feathers from live birds.</TE>
<TE>   But a California Highway Patrol officer, Greg Williams, said the
CHP can't be expected to cite every trucker hauling a cow that forgot
to go before it left.</TE>
<TE>   "These animals are not potty-trained," said Williams, who patrols
the Bakersfield area. "If you want a steak tonight, someone has to
haul the cattle by truck."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, California earned the dubious distinction of
being named the state with the nation's worst roads. Even Arkansas
boasts smoother thoroughfares, according to a study by Transportation
California, a coalition of road builders, labor unions, and asphalt
and pavement suppliers.</TE>
<TE>   Burt Shapiro of Hollywood believes the work crews that dig up
streets to make underground repairs are partly to blame for the sorry
condition of local roads.</TE>
<TE>   Q: "Why can't all construction workers who cut into the street be
required to repair the street to at least the same quality it was
before their work?"</TE>
<TE>   A: Believe it or not, Burt, work crews are required to do just
that. At least that's the policy in the city of Los Angeles,
according to Robert Bowen, assistant director of the city's Bureau of
Contract Administration. Bowen's department oversees the private
contractors and utility companies that tear up city streets to make
repairs.</TE>
<TE>   When one of these crews repairs a street, it embeds a metal tag in
the asphalt to identify the company or utility that did the work. If
someone complains about shoddy roadwork, city inspectors use those
tags to identify the responsible party and order fixes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tom Kendall of Calabasas wrote to say he had been cited for
speeding in southern Utah. He was caught zipping along at 93 mph in a
75-mph zone. No doubt Tom was trying to get back to sunny California
at the time and he just couldn't help the heavy foot.</TE>
<TE>   Now Kendall wants to know if that ticket will tarnish his driving
record in California.</TE>
<TE>   Q: "I'd like to know if Utah routinely turns over traffic
violations records to the California DMV. If it does not, then that
is the end of my concern in this matter."</TE>
<TE>   A: Sorry, Tom, but traffic violations that occur in most states
will haunt you wherever you go in the country until the fine is paid.
Most states are members of the Driver License Compact, an agreement
between states to share such information.</TE>
<TE>   Even Utah, the state that boasts an onion as its official
vegetable, participates in the compact. And, yes, your insurance
company has access to that information.</TE>
<TE>   If you would like to attend traffic school to wipe the ticket from
your record, you must check with the authorities in Utah to see what,
if any, schools they will let you attend in California. Each court
handles such matters differently.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rodney Fayton of the San Fernando Valley wrote to say that he has
long wondered how the state decides which destinations are emblazoned
on freeway signs.</TE>
<TE>   Q: "Why do so many northbound freeway interchange signs around Los
Angeles say Sacramento? Granted Interstate 5 goes there, but aren't
there closer places, such as San Fernando Valley or Santa Clarita,
that would be more useful?"</TE>
<TE>   A: For this question, the traffic wonks at the California
Department of Transportation cited the state Traffic Manual, a
document the size of the Old Testament that regulates the size,
color, height, width and placement of every freeway sign.</TE>
<TE>   The manual says freeway signs should include the names of "distant
major destinations (control cities) for long trip orientation." In
addition, those "distant major destinations" should remain consistent
throughout the freeway route, according to the manual.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A previous Behind the Wheel column discussing the rules of
carpooling failed to mention that motorcycles and clean-air vehicles
in California are permitted to use the diamond lanes, regardless of
how many passengers are on board.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of clean-air vehicles--electric or natural gas-powered
cars--state lawmakers offered the exemption as an incentive to get
more motorists to drive clean, green, commuting machines.</TE>
<TE>   Federal transportation officials say motorcycles are permitted in
carpool lanes because it is safer to keep two-wheeled vehicles moving
than to have them travel in stop-and-go traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Several motorcycle riders wrote to complain that most motorists
don't realize that in California motorcycles are also permitted to
"lane split," or to ride in between cars. They say drivers often
curse, make obscene gestures or crowd motorcyclists who practice this
maneuver.</TE>
<TE>   Motorcyclist Julie Dobyns, who described herself as a law-abiding
driver of a 1997 Ducati, suggested the animosity comes from motorists
who "dislike the fact that someone is moving through traffic when
they are not."</TE>
<TE>   Or perhaps it comes from motorists who dislike being stuck in
traffic near trucks loaded with reeking livestock.</TE>

traffic in Southern California, write to Behind The Wheel, 202 W. 1st
Street, Los Angeles, CA 90012, or send an e-mail to behindthe

<LD>   "Austin Powers in Goldmember" shagged a swaggering $76.6 million
in its opening weekend and Thursday evening preview. The third
installment of the Mike Myers comedy series was the fifth-biggest
opener of all time, third-biggest opening of 2002, the biggest July
opening and the largest for a comedy.</LD>

<LD>The other night I had a terrible dream. I'd gone to see "Austin
Powers in Goldmember," but instead of showing the movie, the theater
just ran one long Taco Bell commercial. Some people would say I
wasn't dreaming.</LD>
<LD>   It's the height of the summer movie season, a season when movies
are products created to sell other products. According to Newsweek,
"Scooby-Doo" got a green light when Warner Bros.' consumer products
division told the studio's film executives the movie could bring in
$30 million in profits from stuffed animals and coloring books alone.
The abysmal movie did so well the studio's already commissioned a
sequel.</LD>
<LD>   At a time when familiarity trumps originality, every studio is in
the franchise business. Twentieth Century Fox, which has "X-Men 2"
due next summer, is at work on "Alien vs. Predator," based on the
earlier films and a popular video game. Paramount, which will shoot a
second installment of "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider" this fall, is gearing
up for a new installment of "Indiana Jones" and even trying to turn
Michael Caine into a franchise, remaking "The Italian Job" (1969) and
"Alfie" (1966).</LD>
<TE>   Disney has "The Santa Clause 2" and a "Shanghai Noon" sequel,
"Shanghai Knights," due out later this year, with sequels to "The
Jungle Book" and "Coyote Ugly" in the works. Universal is doing a new
version of "The Incredible Shrinking Man" (1957), as well as sequels
to "Pitch Black," "The Fast and the Furious" and "Meet the Parents."
Sony has a new version of "I Spy" coming, plus sequels to "Charlie's
Angels," "XXX" (in the works before the first one is released), "Bad
Boys" and "Spider-Man," which already has a release date--May 7,
2004--before a script has even been finished.</TE>
<TE>   Warner Bros., home to the "Harry Potter" series, is brimming with
sequels and remakes, including "The Matrix Reloaded," "Analyze That,"
"Cats and Dogs 2," "Batman vs. Superman," "Westworld" and (gasp!)
"Starsky and Hutch." Even Miramax's Harvey Weinstein, once the king
of independent film, has been buying up youth-oriented bestsellers
left and right, hoping to generate a trilogy like "The Lord of the
Rings," the smash hit that Weinstein sold off to New Line in return
for a piece of the profits, while Miramax's Dimension division gets
ready to release "Spy Kids 2."</TE>
<TE>   The only problem is that the studios have been churning out so
many sequels and remakes that they're running low on available
product. I recently intercepted a memo commissioned by a producer
with close ties to several studios whose researcher has just dug up a
long list of new possibilities. Try to guess which one is an actual
development project. (Answer at column's end.)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dear Boss:</TE>
<TE>   Just as we thought, the pickings are slim. Warners is already
remaking "The In-Laws" and has a guy writing an "Ocean's Eleven"
sequel (I hear it's a low-budget thing where they rob a card club in
Gardena); Paramount is doing "The Stepford Wives," and MGM is working
on a new installment of "The Thomas Crown Affair." We're scraping the
bottom of the barrel, but here are a few possibilities:</TE>
<TE>   "The Seventh Sense": An inside-Hollywood comedy, the seventh sense
being the sinking feeling you get in your tummy when you know your
movie's going to bomb before it comes out. (Elie Samaha could handle
the financing.) The main story focuses on Bruce Willis as he tries to
figure out who persuaded him to do "Bandits" and "Hart's War." We've
already got some great footage of Bruce dangling an MGM marketing
executive out of a 10-story window. There's also a great running gag
where we see Eddie Murphy at the press junket for "The Adventures of
Pluto Nash," trying to count how many movies he made between the time
it was shot and finally reached the theaters.</TE>
<TE>   "Munsters Inc.": Here's a timely remake: Desperate to boost its
fourth-quarter earnings, a scandal-plagued oil company hires Herman,
Lily, Grandpa and Eddie Munster as sales reps to scare people into
buying more Lincoln Navigators. (Note to product-placement team: One
of those Navigators goes to me if we get this off the ground.) Our
plan is to go hip-hop with the casting: Shaquille O'Neal was born to
play Herman, Macy Gray is perfect for Lily, Bow Wow could do Eddie in
his sleep and, for Grandpa, we're negotiating a computer-generated
comeback deal with the Redd Foxx Estate.</TE>
<TE>   "The Last, Last, Last Action Heroes": Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sly
Stallone and Steven Seagal play semiretired CIA operatives working as
airport security screeners who stumble onto a hostage drama at the
McDonald's at LAX's Terminal One. With nothing more at their disposal
than Southwest Air luggage carts, security wands and a big bag of
frozen potatoes, they rescue a diabetic preschooler from his dad,
who's in a suicidal funk after the breakup of his marriage and
feeding his son Cinnabons by the dozen. (This is a part we should
obviously offer to Billy Bob Thornton right away--maybe we can get
Angelina Jolie to do a cameo as his ex.) The marketing potential here
is enormous: PMK says we could easily get a Modern Maturity cover
story with this lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "Eight": If Universal can do another Hannibal Lecter thriller we
can pull off a sequel to "Seven." Morgan Freeman returns as a psychic
detective tracking a serial killer with psychic powers who has an
especially deadly modus operandi--he's been bumping off telephone
psychics with consecutive 8's in their phone numbers. I don't know
about you, but I see 8's in our future, as in an $88-million opening
weekend! A bonus: When we release our DVD with all the outtakes and
extras, we can give it a classy marketing hook by calling it "8 1/2."</TE>
<TE>   "Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia": Sam Peckinpah was run out
of town for making this grisly revenge saga back in 1974, but now
that "Austin Powers" can do dozens of excrement, flatulence and penis
jokes and still get a PG-13, this is the perfect time for a remake.
The story revolves around a hustler who goes grave-digging after a
wealthy Mexican man offers a $1-million reward for the skull of the
interloper who seduced his daughter. We've got Benicio del Toro on
board as the hustler and a video director with the perfect resume to
film someone driving around with a severed head in his front seat--he
shot Marilyn Manson's music videos.</TE>
<TE>   "My Big Fat Greek Murder Mystery": There's no time to lose on this
sequel--the original is still doing amazing business. On the rebound
from a disastrous marriage, Nia Vardalos is a frumpy Greek detective
hired by a wealthy gubernatorial candidate (Jesse Ventura is
available!) whose campaign is going so badly that he becomes the
leading suspect when the incumbent governor dies after eating a
poisoned chicken wing at a political fund-raiser. Fueled by huge
portions of dolmas and tzatziki made by her Old World mother (once
again Lainie Kazan), Nia falls madly in love with her client, getting
him off the hook on the murder rap, even though he eventually goes to
jail for using an illegal feta cheese tax shelter.</TE>
<TE>   "Married to the Gay Mafia": A remake of Jonathan Demme's quirky
1988 thriller "Married to the Mob," this comedy chronicles the
misadventures of a homophobic Hollywood talent agent who wakes up one
day to discover that his hot new client is not only gay, but also
madly in love with him. When the agent (Charlie Sheen) discovers that
every other gay agent in town is putting the moves on his client
(Rupert Everett, of course) he's forced to spend a verry long, hot
weekend at a rave party in Palm Springs trying to keep him out of the
rival agencies' clutches.</TE>
<TE>   (Answer: The real sequel project is "Bring Me the Head of Alfredo
Garcia.")</TE>

<HD>On Central Avenue, Music Rises Again</HD>
<DH>Top players and overflow crowds at weekend event revive the
Los Angeles street and its glorious past.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Central Avenue was the powerful spine of an energetic, world-class
entertainment center for the first half of the 20th century in Los
Angeles. Overflowing with theaters, restaurants, nightclubs and
bistros, it was the showcase arena to experience the art of Louis
Armstrong, Art Tatum, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Jelly Roll Morton
and other jazz legends.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday and Sunday, the Avenue came vibrantly alive again, as
it does each year with the arrival of the Central Avenue Jazz
Festival. In a four-block location, directly in front of the Dunbar
Hotel--once the home-away-from-home of Ellington, Armstrong, Basie,
Lena Horne, Billy Eckstine and others--aural visions of past glories
simmered through the air via festival performances ranging from
Central Avenue veterans Teddy Edwards, Gerald Wilson, Gerald Wiggins
and Ernie Andrews to Latin jazz all-stars Justo Almario and the Banda
Brothers and the blues stylings of Roy Gaines.</LD>
<TE>   Sunday afternoon's program kicked off with the high-powered
improvising of trumpeter Oscar Brashear, followed in close order by
Larry Nash's Jazz Symphonics. Pianist Nash's ensemble, touching as
many familiar jazz items as possible, played several medleys that
shifted, without a break, from one jazz classic to another; the
presence of tenor saxophonist Ricky Woodard and trumpeter Bobby
Rodriguez guaranteed a string of swinging solo segments. And when
singer Spanky Wilson joined the ensemble, her let-it-all-hang-out
blues numbers brought several wildly gyrating dancers to the front of
the overflow crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Almario's group--essentially Tolu without drummer Alex
Acuna--featured the leader's extraordinary versatility on tenor and
alto saxophones, shifting from hard-driving, straight-ahead jazz
improvising to riff-driven flights over foot-tapping salsa rhythms,
enhanced by the brilliant conga drumming of Francisco Aguabella.</TE>
<TE>   The rarely acknowledged Gaines, who once ran the now-defunct South
Central blues club Gainesville, cranked up the musical wattage with a
galvanizing set of vocals and guitar specials.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, roaring to a climax, the Gerald Wilson Orchestra
spectacularly called up echoes of a time when the sounds of big jazz
bands could be heard along the length of Central Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   The festival, positioned in the Central Avenue Jazz Park, across
from the Dunbar, was filled with an audience that flowed out onto the
surrounding streets, lined with savory food stands and colorful
collections of clothing and art. One observer, gleefully digging the
sounds, the atmosphere and the overall vibe, noted, "Man, this is the
only really authentic jazz festival in L.A." On a sunny, summer
afternoon, in a spot resonating with jazz history, listening to
marvelous music, who could disagree?</TE>

<DH>The surging wave in young female singers: a rock
sensibility, emotional honesty and self-written songs</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's easy to miss how unusual singer-songwriter Avril Lavigne looks
in the cover photo of her hit debut album, "Let Go."</LD>
<LD>   The 17-year-old Canadian stands in the middle of a busy street,
her dirty-blond hair looking a bit stringy. She's engulfed by an
oversized black jacket and baggy pants that drape in rumples over
black running shoes, a bit of a wide belt peeking out where the
jacket has fallen slightly open. Her expression is nonchalant,
perhaps even bored.</LD>
<LD>   This is not your normal teen pop star. She looks way too normal.
No cleavage, no provocative poses, no coiffed hair, no buffed-out bod
squeezed into skintight duds.</LD>
<TE>   "I've been in situations, working in the studio where somebody
wanted my songs to be more pop-influenced," says Lavigne (whose last
name is pronounced Luh-VEEN). "Or at photo shoots where they wanted
me to look all cute, because so many people have sold so many records
that way."</TE>
<TE>   But Lavigne has sold an impressive 700,000-plus records her own
way. In its seven weeks in stores, "Let Go" has been holding steady
in the top five of the sales chart behind blockbusters from the Dave
Matthews Band, Nelly and Eminem.</TE>
<TE>   Some have suggested that her popularity, in tandem with that of
Michelle Branch and Vanessa Carlton, two other young women who write
most of their own songs, signals that young listeners finally have
outgrown the prefab teen sex kittens and are searching out music with
more substance.</TE>
<TE>   "There are only so many dance-oriented videos you can absorb
without beginning to look very closely at the quality of the songs,"
says Jeff Pollack, one of the nation's leading radio consultants.
"The truth is, all three of these young women have made really
compelling pop records with songs you turn up the radio to hear when
they come on. That says a lot more about the songs than it does about
their age. They sound poised, sophisticated and they're not lyrically
silly.... These are just pop records without the 'teen' attached to
it."</TE>
<TE>   A&amp;M Records President Ron Fair has been on both sides of the
fence, having signed and produced Christina Aguilera and 21-year-old
Carlton, whose debut album, "Be Not Nobody," has sold more than
500,000 copies in four months.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened in the teen pop wave is that a small group of
producers and writers wrote the majority of the hits for 'N Sync,
Backstreet Boys, Britney [Spears] and 98 Degrees, and there was a
sameness to it," Fair says. "With radio, once they feel a certain
sound is working with listeners, they'll really pound it. It's a
vicious circle. That sound becomes saturated, then one day, it is no
more.</TE>
<TE>   "Along come Vanessa Carlton and Michelle Branch, who are doing
something different, something that's coming from more of a rock
place," says Fair. "What that indicates to me is that the kids are
open to a voice of someone who's writing their own songs, expressing
their own thoughts, and they express a different kind of vibe than,
'Here I am dancing with my midriff showing.' "</TE>
<TE>   That vibe wouldn't fly with Lavigne's skate-punk attitude.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like taking crap from people, and I don't like people
bossing me around," she snaps with pride. "I go with my gut, and I've
had to do that a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Lavigne's music certainly is a far cry from that of the Britneys,
Cristinas and Mandys who in recent years have dominated radio, MTV
and most media coverage of pop music made by young women.</TE>
<TE>   Forget the choreography-ready production numbers composed by a
staff of professional songwriters hired to concoct fantasy images of
glamour to sell to young music fans.</TE>
<TE>   In their place are down-to-earth songs written by Lavigne and
several collaborators expressing her frustration at a boyfriend's
two-faced personality (her hit single, "Complicated"), her yearning
to feel special ("Anything but Ordinary") or a new spin on the old
rich girl-poor boy theme ("Sk8er Boi"). Catchy pop-rock verses often
explode into punk-tinged choruses lacerated by slashing electric
guitars.</TE>
<TE>   The speed at which "Let Go" has taken off has surprised even those
who were anticipating good things from Lavigne.</TE>
<TE>   "We really expected this to be a slow build, and I approached it
that way," says Arista Records President Antonio "L.A." Reid, who
signed the singer. "There was not a lot of hype or huge expectations
out of the gate. I had confidence that she'd build over time, but to
have an immediate explosion the way she has absolutely has been a
surprise."</TE>
<TE>   One reason might be the welcome alternative Lavigne and her
kindred spirits provide. They say they're hearing expressions of
relief from young fans, as well as from their parents.</TE>
<TE>   "I get a lot of comments from younger people like 'Thank you for
just being yourself,' " says Branch, 21, whose album "The Spirit
Room" has passed the 1-million sales mark and has been on the Top 200
chart for nearly a year. "They can tell when something has been
polished and is trying to be marketed toward them. Kids are a lot
smarter than people think."</TE>
<TE>   So far, Lavigne, whose own musical tastes run to the Goo Goo
Dolls, System of a Down and Blink-182, has no problem with
representing the voice of the "real" teenager.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't feel like a burden--I think it's awesome," she says.
"I'm a normal teenager. I've been through being mad at my parents,
mad at boys, and a lot of people can relate to that. I just write
honest stuff, and a lot of people have been through the same stuff I
have. Every teenager has."</TE>

<DH>Movies* In 'Full Frontal,' Oscar-winning director Steven
Soderbergh goes no-frills, indie-film style. Except for the movie
stars.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN MAYNARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Steven Soderbergh calls "Full Frontal" a "movie about movies for
people who love movies." The 38-year-old director of blockbusters
such as "Erin Brockovich" and "Traffic" returns to his roots to make
an unofficial sequel to his seminal indie smash "sex, lies, and
videotape" (1989), "only in the karmic sense."</LD>
<LD>   Shot on the fly in 18 days, the film came in at a budget of $2
million and employed eight simple rules for its cast, including scale
pay; no hair, makeup or craft services; and to be prepared to be
filmed at any time.</LD>
<LD>   Set in one 24-hour period around L.A., "Full Frontal" is an
ensemble piece shot on digital video about seven dysfunctional
characters all somewhat associated with the making of a slick
Hollywood romance shot on 35-millimeter film called "Rendezvous." Of
course, this time around Soderbergh gets to have it both ways;
naturally there's more interest in experimental self-reflection when
Julia Roberts is in on the navel-gazing. Without giving too much
away, here's a basic primer to decoding the mysteries of this A-list
art flick.</LD>
<TE>   Film School 101: Not only does Soderbergh employ the moves of any
self-respecting indie, such as jump cuts, long master shots,
intertitles and naturalistic dialogue, he also references the whole
auteur canon. There's a Richard Lester-style fragmented narrative and
camera zoom-ins. Also a nice inclusion of an Italian poster of
Godard's "Contempt." David Duchovny's kinky film producer comes on
like a john straight out of Bunuel's "Belle de Jour." It's pure
Fellini to have all the characters collide in a confined space at the
end. And the film's tag line, "Everybody needs a release," is
straight out of Cassavetes. ("I gotta have some kind of release,"
says a horny Seymour Cassel to a gaggle of frustrated housewives in
"Faces.")</TE>
<TE>   The Sex Files: Roberts may have joked in interviews that this was
his "little nudie movie," but the only such moment here comes from
the man who played a certain agent named Mulder. Apparently the shot
of Duchovny was taken from far enough away that the film wasn't
slapped with an NC-17 rating, like, say, Ewan McGregor's entire
oeuvre sans "Star Wars" movies.</TE>
<TE>   I Hate Being Typecast: Actors moan they're not given room to
stretch, but clearly Catherine Keener and Roberts don't mind. This is
Keener's third brittle entertainment exec ("Death to Smoochy" and the
upcoming "Simone") this year; for Roberts, as Francesca, an actress
playing a lovelorn magazine writer, Roberts proves once again her
fondness for playing variations of herself ("Notting Hill,"
"America's Sweethearts").</TE>
<TE>   "Full Frontal" and "Day for Night" Are Hardly Night From Day: Not
only are both Soderbergh's and Truffaut's comic films about
moviemaking, but Roberts wears an identical shag wig to the one worn
by Jacqueline Bisset. And both actresses play actresses who throw
diva hissy fits over craft services. Bisset's character demands real
country butter, while Roberts' fusses over the celery in her tuna
salad sandwich. Plus we couldn't help but notice that Jacques
Davidovici's lush classical interludes are tres reminiscent of
Georges Delerue's score in the 1973 film.</TE>
<TE>   Minority Report: Blair Underwood plays an insecure TV actor named
Nicholas (played by an actor named Calvin) who is transitioning into
features. Clearly, he didn't have to do much research; Underwood
first found fame in the 1986-94 series "L.A. Law." In a sharp rap to
celebrity reporter Roberts, Calvin takes Hollywood to task for being
too timid to cast African Americans as romantic leads. At one point,
he complains that even Denzel Washington can't get any loving from "a
pretty woman under the pelican moon," a direct jab at the on-screen
platonic relationship between Roberts and Washington in "The Pelican
Brief" (1993).</TE>
<TE>   Lucky Seven: Nicholas' first feature role is playing the
obligatory black sidekick opposite Brad Pitt in a cop action flick.
Not only does Pitt play himself, but the director of the movie within
the movie is David Fincher, with whom Pitt worked on "Seven" and
"Fight Club." Throughout "Full Frontal," there are also various Los
Angeles Magazine covers that feature Pitt striking various vanity
poses wearing a T-shirt that bears Fincher's name.</TE>
<TE>   Director's Cut: Movies about moviemaking often feature the
directors as co-stars. In "Day for Night," Truffaut plays the
film-within-a-film's lenser fittingly as a beleaguered insomniac. In
"Contempt," Godard shows himself as Fritz Lang's assistant. But
Soderbergh's not as interested in star time. Playing himself, he
appears only briefly in one scene with a small black box covering his
face.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, That's Terence Stamp: You might not notice him skulking
around in the background, but the handsome British actor makes a
cameo reprising the role of Wilson for the first time--the petty
criminal character first appeared in Ken Loach's "Poor Cow" (1967)
and resurfaced more than 30 years later in Soderbergh's "The Limey"
(1999). Now he's back for equally dubious reasons, but it takes
multiple viewings of "Full Frontal" to figure out what they are.</TE>
<TE>   No, That's Not Harvey Weinstein: That potty-mouthed Diet Coke
guzzler may look like the head of Miramax, but he's actually played
by dead-ringer Jeff Garlin, who also plays Larry David's agent on
HBO's pseudo-reality sitcom "Curb Your Enthusiasm."</TE>
<TE>   Executive Decisions: Mega-producer Jerry Weintraub (who produced
Soderbergh's "Ocean's Eleven") plays Jerry, the owner of Los Angeles
Magazine, who summons employee David Hyde Pierce to the actual
publication's offices. Nathalie Seaver, a former Showtime vice
president turned dress designer, cameos as herself selling a fancy
frock to a masseuse (Mary McCormack) from her own 3rd Street
boutique.</TE>
<TE>   The Great Imitator: Nicky Katt's hilariously self-absorbed actor
playing Hitler in a community theater production called "The Sound
and the Fuhrer" is a direct nod to Charlie Chaplin's "The Great
Dictator." So is Keener's unraveling, power-mad careerist, especially
when playing with an inflatable globe while firing her employees.</TE>
<TE>   Reel Love: Art imitates life in two of "Full Frontal's" romantic
pairings. You can't help but think that Soderbergh used off-screen
flame Jules Asner from E! as the inspiration for Francesca, the
celebrity reporter. And Roberts seems to be poking fun at herself
when her character falls for a regular-guy movie techie played by
Brad Rowe. Rowe looks like a cute cross between Brad Pitt and
Roberts' new cameraman husband Danny Moder. Moder worked behind the
scenes on "Full Frontal"; he actually met Roberts on the set of "The
Mexican" (2000), which co-starred Brad Pitt.</TE>

<HD>As Trust Ebbs, Picture Darkens</HD>
<DH>With news broadcasts sending dire messages that shake our
sense of security, it's hard to know who or what to believe in
anymore.</DH>

<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK--Johnny Carson found stardom in the 1950s as host of a game
show called "Who Do You Trust?"</LD>
<LD>   Now questions of trust are back in force, all over television. Who
do you trust? These days, you could lose big playing this game.</LD>
<LD>   That's the message of TV: Stay on highest alert or risk losing
your retirement, your child, your country, your life. With titles of
summer shows like "Dog Eat Dog" and "Fear Factor," how much clearer
could it be? Makes you long for TV of bygone days, when the picture
seemed much brighter.</LD>
<TE>   Remember a few years ago, when business coverage had everyone in a
lather? Back then, TV's real-life equivalent of "Sex and the City"
was the red-hot exhibitionism of Nasdaq and the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   In that exploding market--and the dot-com mania driving it--biz TV
was like an ongoing Dow Jones telethon, with Maria Bartiromo, instead
of Ed McMahon, at the tote board to salute each stratospheric spike.</TE>
<TE>   Now biz TV keeps a running tally of the villains and victims of
corporate corruption. Quaint notions of "trust" are plaintively
recalled by analysts pondering when investors might regain their
confidence in the market and get back in. Then up pops another pack
of scoundrels.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just not stopping! One after another!" marveled a CNN anchor
last week as she led into a story on the arrests of the founder of
bankrupt Adelphia Communications Corp. and two of his sons for
allegedly plundering the company's treasury.</TE>
<TE>   "One after another!" echoed the correspondent.</TE>
<TE>   The day after that, media giant AOL Time Warner disclosed that the
feds had begun an investigation of accounting practices by its
America Online division--home of the "nicest, kindest, most patient
people I know," according to those perky AOL commercials that seem at
odds with the financial troubles consuming the company.</TE>
<TE>   And don't forget the Martha Stewart mess. Here she is on TV every
day dispensing tips on how to live a perfect, ordered life. But with
the feds probing her affairs for evidence of insider trading, can you
really trust her to tell you how to make a scrumptious cherry
clafouti?</TE>
<TE>   Such psychic undertow has become a given in dealing with life, and
all the more so in the new age of terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   While no one can tell you where or when terrorists will strike
next, you are expected to be ready when it comes--and to keep a wary
eye on the people you socialize and work with in the meantime.</TE>
<TE>   Who do you trust? Your leaders, with their inconclusive updates?</TE>
<TE>   But dreadful as it is to contemplate, the threat of another
terrorist attack has been upstaged for many parents by the threat of
their own child's abduction--the ultimate betrayal of trust within a
civilized society.</TE>
<TE>   Never mind the FBI says kidnappings are rare and, lately, getting
rarer. Viewers have been chilled by coverage of Samantha Runnion, the
5-year-old who was abducted outside her Orange County townhouse and
found dead a day later. Of Cassandra "Casey" Williamson, the
6-year-old suburban St. Louis girl who was snatched from her father's
home and found dead a few blocks away. Of Elizabeth Smart, the
14-year-old Salt Lake City girl who disappeared in June and hasn't
been seen since. And of others.</TE>
<TE>   Child after child, the coverage takes on a dismaying sameness,
dominated by images of stern, determined-looking lawmen and shattered
parents. And, of course, by snapshots and home video--each victim's
private innocence gone public.</TE>
<TE>   But the summer's most wrenching amateur video exposed more than
memories. It threatened to undo one of the few shreds of comfort
resulting from Sept. 11: a heightened trust in public servants.</TE>
<TE>   Over and over, you have seen that footage of a white policeman in
Inglewood slamming a handcuffed black teenager against his patrol
car. Other amateur video of cops clashing with suspects has surfaced
since.</TE>
<TE>   Were these police, unwittingly captured on camera, justifiably
performing a difficult job, as police were honored for doing after
Sept. 11? Or were they stars of ugly sequels to the video of black
man Rodney King beaten at the hands of white Los Angeles cops a
decade ago?</TE>
<TE>   Who do you trust? Can you even trust your own eyes? You watch
enough TV, you start to see things.</TE>

<LD>   Local H Auctions a Private Concert</LD>
<LD>   Chicago rock duo Local H may have stumbled on the next phase in
pop music careers: private concerts auctioned to the highest bidder
over EBay. Scott Lucas and Brian St. Clair have promised to play in
the high bidder's home, backyard, garage or any other location on a
mutually convenient date.</LD>
<TE>   The group, whose last album "Here Comes the Zoo" drew 3 1/2 stars
from Rolling Stone, is best known for its song "Bound for the Floor
(The Copacetic Song)." It listed a minimum bid of $500 for a
performance anywhere in the continental U.S. and, when the auction
closed on Friday, the band had received 81 bids with a high offer of
$9,701. Because of the offer's success, Local H took the unusual step
Friday of premiering its latest video, "Four Hands on the Bible," on
EBay, where it could be downloaded on the auction page.</TE>
<TE>   Concert auctions aren't for everyone, however. A Georgia band, the
Liquor Sisters, posted a similar offer recently, with bidding
starting at $1. The auction closed Sunday without a bid.</TE>

<TE>   Latino Film Festival Announces Winners</TE>
<TE>   Eduard Mignona's "La Fuga" (The Escape), the story of inmates
who've escaped from a Buenos Aires penitentiary, walked off with
awards for best picture and script on the closing night of the sixth
annual Los Angeles Latino International Film Festival.</TE>
<TE>   The screenplay for the Argentine feature was written by the
director and Graciela Maglie and Jorge Goldemberg.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil's Luis Fernando Carvalho beat out Mignona for best director
honors. His "Lavoura Arcaica" (To the Left of the Father) tells of
the struggle between tradition and freedom in a family of Lebanese
immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Nicaragua's "El Chogui," Felix Zurita's story of a young Mexican
who emigrates to the United States, was voted best documentary.</TE>

<TE>   San Jose Symphony  to File Chapter 11</TE>
<TE>   The 123-year-old San Jose Symphony, one of the oldest orchestras
west of the Mississippi, has announced plans to file for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection next month.</TE>
<TE>   Plagued by management and financial troubles, officials decided to
shut down the band in June--leaving San Jose as the largest U.S. city
without a symphony orchestra. It was a blow for a city that has long
sought the major-league cultural status of nearby San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Though Silicon Valley was riding high during the dot-com boom, the
number of subscribers declined over the last decade. According to the
North Carolina-based Nando Times, the symphony is more than $3
million in debt. Its only assets are its sheet music, acoustic shell
and office equipment worth a total of $300,000 by the most upbeat
estimates. The bankruptcy filing will permit management to come up
with a proposal for payment of creditors. Remaining assets will then
be used to form a new symphony. According to interim chairman Jay
Harris, a new orchestra won't emerge until there is funding for a
year, a reserve for three to six months, and a considerable
endowment.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit Symphony Gives Boost to Minorities</TE>
<TE>   The Michigan-based Sphinx Symphony is composed of black and Latino
professional musicians--ethnic groups representing only 3% of the
musicians in American orchestras. In a move sure to boost exposure
for Sphinx players and deliver a larger audience, the Detroit
Symphony Orchestra is throwing more weight behind the group.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning with the Sphinx competition for African American and
Latino string players in February, the Detroit Symphony and resident
conductor Thomas Wilkins will accompany the top three senior division
laureates in the finals concerts. The orchestra, which normally
commands $160,000 for its services, will perform for free.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Detroit Free Press, the symphony will also
continue to let Sphinx use its Orchestra Hall at no cost and to
contribute marketing and promotional support. The goal: incorporating
more music by minority composers and expanding opportunities for
African American musicians.</TE>
<TE>   Though the group's budget has grown from $80,000 to $600,000 last
year, Sphinx is at a crossroads. A three-year grant from Texaco is
coming to an end, and turmoil on Wall Street doesn't help.</TE>

<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Actress Gong Li ("Farewell My Concubine," "Raise the Red Lantern")
has been selected to head the jury at this year's Venice Film
Festival, running Aug. 29 to Sept. 8. She won the best actress award
at the festival in 1992 for Zhang Yimou's "The Story of Qiu Ju." ...
Telemundo, now part of NBC, will join in the broadcast of next year's
Golden Globe Awards, with NBC's version in English and Telemundo
offering a Spanish-language translation.... Alex Cambert, a former
Telemundo correspondent, will report on entertainment and lifestyle
trends for ABC's "Good Morning America".... Australian-born Sarah
Wynter ("The Sixth Day") has signed on as the new female lead for the
second season of the Fox series "24." ... The Cult singer Ian Astbury
will handle most of Jim Morrison's vocal duties when surviving
members of the Doors reunite for a show Sept. 6 at California
Speedway in Fontana.</TE>

<KH>Pop Music Review</KH>
<HD>Different Drummers, but the Same Message</HD>
<DH>With its unifying spirit, Christian music easily hops genre
lines, as shown by the wide range of acts at the occasionally
inspiring Fish Fest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a coin toss which sight was the bigger eye-opener at Sunday's
Fish Fest in Irvine: silver-haired adults bopping and singing along
to a crunching rap-rock band, or spiky-haired kids in hip-hop outfits
dreamily swaying to '70s-rooted pop balladry.</LD>
<LD>   But so it goes in the world of contemporary Christian music.
Perhaps more striking than any of the 10 individual acts that
appeared on two stages over nearly seven hours at the event put on by
Christian radio station the Fish, KFSH-FM (95.9), was the way this
community has united disparate groups to an extent that the secular
pop world still can't match.</LD>
<LD>   That's because in Christian music, message always supersedes the
medium. So whether it was South Africa's the Benjamin Gate pounding
out punk-metal, Ohio's Relient K thrashing out punk-pop, Southern
California's Pax 217 grinding out rap-rock or Nashville-based
headliner Michael W. Smith crooning ballads of praise, the audience
of about 14,000 that nearly filled Verizon Wireless Amphitheater
drank it in with democratic enthusiasm.</LD>
<TE>   The breadth of the musical spectrum on display also made it seem a
lifetime ago that contemporary Christian music regarded the beat as a
tool of darkness. While Smith's soaring songs of worship harked back
to those days when nearly all Christian music floated along on a
gentle folk-pop cloud, the rest of the performances showed a
Christian equivalent to virtually every sound that exists in secular
pop.</TE>
<TE>   The overall batting average in terms of gripping artistry is
little better or worse than in the wider pop universe. Only Relient K
and singer-songwriter Jennifer Knapp offered much to anyone looking
for lyrical sophistication.</TE>
<TE>   Australia's Newsboys give a pretty electrifying performance, but
even the passion lead singer Peter Furler exhibits on stage can't
fully compensate for over-generalized expressions that leave many of
their songs too vague.</TE>
<TE>   Where most of the other performers were likewise content to praise
God or celebrate their faith in the most general terms, Knapp looked
at specific faces of the struggle to understand the meaning of
spirituality.</TE>
<TE>   Relient K, on the other hand, brought a refreshing sense of humor
while offering low-key messages of ethical and moral integrity, bound
up in energetic, melodic punk with enough Offspring-like hooks to
give the band a real shot at airplay on modern-rock radio.</TE>

<HD>'Bernarda Alba' Doesn't Always Make Its Point</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Consider it a happy coincidence that the locally based Aeolian Ballet
Theatre performed a dance adaptation of "The House of Bernarda Alba"
just after a production of Federico Garcia Lorca's play of the same
name opened at the Mark Taper Forum.</LD>
<LD>   Garcia Lorca's portrait of oppression in a family of women has
inspired dance dramas from a host of choreographers, including Alvin
Ailey and Kenneth MacMillan. The uneven, one-hour Aeolian version,
Sunday at the University of Judaism, didn't challenge these
heavyweights, but it did highlight the things that dance can do
better than spoken drama (depict shared, unexpressed feelings), and
also what it can't (explain why a man would plan to marry one sister
while sleeping with another).</LD>
<LD>   Those who'd seen the Taper staging could more easily penetrate the
plot confusions in the adaptation by choreographer Adonis
Daukayev--and also appreciate his best ideas.</LD>
<TE>   In the play, for instance, Pepe is a key character much talked
about but never seen. Daukayev, however, placed him powerfully front
and center, dancing the role with strong technical and expressive
skills.</TE>
<TE>   The choreographer proved less successful at giving each woman a
distinctive dance style and, despite the heroic energy of the
talented Cindy Ricalde, tuned the matriarch of the title into a
florid, wicked stepmother role.</TE>
<TE>   Part of his problem is that, except for a dreary fate trio,
Daukayev reserved toe shoes for a lyric duet between Pepe and the
doomed, adulterous Adela. But Maria Serafica danced listlessly
here--her most powerful moments came in scenes of anger and
rebellion. And the lack of pointe choreography restricted the other
women's interpretive options.</TE>
<TE>   Amanda Mazzer, Angelina Mia, Catherine Haugland and Lara Ramirez
completed the cast, dancing to taped music by six composers, plus
folk songs.</TE>
<TE>   No further performances are scheduled, but Channel Islands Ballet
has announced its own "Bernarda Alba," scheduled for late September
in Thousand Oaks.</TE>

<HD>A Soulful Duet in 'Sweet Old Song'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHELLE MALTAIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The creation of music and art might well serve to keep nonagenarian
Howard "Louie Bluie" Armstrong's body and mind sharp, but his love
for and from life partner Barbara Ward tends his soul.</LD>
<LD>   "Sweet Old Song," which airs at 10 tonight on KCET, explores their
collaboration in life and art. A bit uneven, the "P.O.V." film
doesn't clearly demonstrate on which path the director means to take
the audience, and the chronology of Armstrong's life and career
before Ward entered his life isn't really clear. But like Armstrong,
it is held together by Ward.</LD>
<LD>   With seemingly disparate threads of music, art and love, she acts
as a seamstress weaving this patchwork quilt of history, each panel
representing different aspects of his life--family, the Old South,
history, romance and the reality of aging.</LD>
<TE>   Armstrong, recognized as a national treasure by the National
Endowment for the Arts in 1990, is celebrated by jazz and blues
aficionados for his exuberant style. He breathes creativity,
composing poetry, drawing effortlessly and sawing on his fiddle with
the same skill as he did as a youth. Proficient in 22 instruments, he
is the lone survivor of the black string band genre that flourished
before World War II. His repertoire is a blend of swing, blues,
country and spirituals that these traveling bands played.</TE>
<TE>   In helping Armstrong to keep memories alive by drawing on the
past, literally and figuratively, Ward encourages him to return to
LaFollette, Tenn., his childhood hometown. The journey brings
memories both bitter (his brother's death and pervasive racial
discrimination) and sweet (the embrace of the community and his
enduring love of family).</TE>

<HD>AOL, AT&amp;T Reportedly Working to End Venture</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>AOL Time Warner Inc. and AT&amp;T Corp. have temporarily suspended
registering shares of their entertainment venture for a possible sale
to the public while they consider alternative ways to unwind the
partnership, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar
with the matter.</LD>
<LD>   AT&amp;T wants to sell all or part of its 27.6% stake in Time Warner
Entertainment to help raise money and trim debt. AOL Time Warner
Chief Executive Richard Parsons has said he wants to disband the
venture to help simplify the financial structure of the world's
largest media company.</LD>
<LD>   Putting off the share registration gives the companies time to
negotiate a restructuring of the joint venture that probably will
result in an initial public offering of AOL's cable-television
systems, the Journal said.</LD>
<TE>   The companies last month hired Bank of America Corp. to appraise
the venture, created in 1993. Analysts have estimated that the AT&amp;T
stake may be worth as much as $10 billion to $11 billion.</TE>
<TE>   AOL spokeswoman Tricia Primrose said discussions with AT&amp;T are
continuing and declined to elaborate. AT&amp;T spokeswoman Sue Fleming
declined to comment on the report. Time Warner Entertainment owns
most of AOL Time Warner's cable-TV systems, the Warner Bros. movie
studio and the HBO pay-TV network.</TE>
<TE>   New York-based AOL Time Warner has management control of the
partnership. AT&amp;T started the process of dissolving the venture in
February 2001, when it took steps to register Time Warner
Entertainment shares for sale to the public because it wasn't
satisfied with AOL Time Warner's offer to buy the stake.</TE>
<TE>   Parsons has said an initial public offering of AT&amp;T's stake would
be a "sub-optimal" outcome. Selling shares in the venture isn't an
attractive option now because of an unfavorable market for IPOs and
cable systems, investors have said.</TE>
<TE>   On the New York Stock Exchange, AOL Time Warner rose 68 cents to
$11.58, while AT&amp;T rose 60 cents to $9.74.</TE>

<DH>Media: In a 60-minute showdown, the board of Bertelsmann
gutted its CEO's Internet strategy, forcing his exit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHUCK PHILIPS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was during a secret meeting Friday at a posh hotel in Guetersloh,
Germany, that media magnate Thomas Middelhoff realized he had lost
control of Bertelsmann.</LD>
<LD>   The sun was shining as Middelhoff approached the hotel in a
limousine with the wife of Reinhard Mohn, whose powerful family is
the largest shareholder in the privately held corporation, industry
sources said. But the mood quickly grew dark as Middelhoff entered
the suite where Bertelsmann's supervisory board had holed up to
confront him about his future at the media giant.</LD>
<LD>   Over the next hour, the supervisory board informed Middelhoff that
they opposed his long-standing plan to take Bertelsmann public. They
also rejected Middelhoff's proposal for the Mohn family to dilute its
75% stake in the Bertelsmann Foundation, which holds a majority of
Bertelsmann's stock, and significantly reduce the family's control
over the 167-year-old company.</LD>
<TE>   In less than 60 minutes, the board gutted Middelhoff's entire
strategic plan to meld the Internet with more traditional media, such
as publishing and music, and divest some of the family's smaller
businesses. After catching his breath, the stunned 49-year-old
Bertelsmann chairman and chief executive immediately offered to quit.
The supervisory board accepted his resignation, sources familiar with
the situation said.</TE>
<TE>   By late Saturday the terms of Middelhoff's exit had been worked
out, and early Sunday morning the Mohn family had signed off.</TE>
<TE>   "Thomas Middelhoff will leave the company," read a statement
released from the company's Guetersloh headquarters. "The separation
resulted from differences of opinion between the Chairman and the
Supervisory Board on the future strategy of Bertelsmann AG and on
cooperation between the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board."</TE>
<TE>   Middelhoff was replaced by 59-year-old Gunter Thielen, a loyal and
conservative veteran who has worked for Bertelsmann for more than two
decades, including running its Arvata publishing unit, the company's
oldest business.</TE>
<TE>   Middelhoff's ouster, after four years as Bertelsmann's CEO,
stunned many executives in his own company--as well as many rival
executives.But sources close to the Mohn family say a showdown
between Middelhoff and the family has been brewing for nearly six
months over the future of the company.</TE>
<TE>   Middelhoff could not be reached on Monday. A Bertelsmann
spokesperson declined comment.</TE>
<TE>   But sources say Middelhoff and the Mohn family have been sparring
privately for months. In the spring, Middelhoff initiated discussions
with Reinhard Mohn to persuade the family to dilute its 75% stake in
the Bertelsmann Foundation to 50.1%. If the Mohn family relaxed its
control of the company, Middelhoff reasoned, he would be able to move
faster to build Bertelsmann into an even bigger global media force.</TE>
<TE>   During his tenure Middelhoff turned Bertelsmann from a
conservatively run family business into the fifth-largest media
company in the world, with $20 billion in sales. He bought American
publishing giant Random House and control of RTL, Europe's largest TV
broadcaster. He also bought Napster Inc., with plans to develop a
legal version of the controversial music file-sharing system, which
has been shut down by a federal court.</TE>
<TE>   But by early summer, as the stock of AOL Time Warner Inc. and
Vivendi Universal continued to sink, the Mohn family began to get
cold feet about Middelhoff's grand plans. Indeed, many of his highly
touted online aspirations, including his vow to launch a legal
version of Napster, had bottomed out. The Mohn family began to
privately question Middelhoff's plan to seek a stock market
listing--to help raise cash for even more acquisitions, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks ago, the Mohn family grew even more agitated after
learning that Middelhoff had instigated a fight between Bertelsmann's
executive board and the supervisory board over corporate governance
issues. The executive board sided with Middelhoff's plan to assume
more power--an idea rejected by the higher-ranking supervisory board.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after the meeting, the supervisory board appealed to
Reinhard Mohn, 81, a fifth-generation member of the founding
Bertelsmann family, to remove Middelhoff and replace him with
Thielen.</TE>
<TE>   By late Thursday, the members of the supervisory board had made up
their minds: Middelhoff, who still had five years left on his deal
and a contract guaranteeing him a post at Bertelsmann until he was
70, was to be fired, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Then on Friday, Middelhoff agreed to resign.</TE>
<TE>   Several of Bertelsmann's U.S. executives were in shock Monday and
said they had no idea what would happen next at the company.</TE>
<TE>   Last year Middelhoff opened the way for a public offering by
trading 25% of its shares with Belgian investment firm Groupe
Bruxelles Lambert for control of RTL.</TE>
<TE>   But on Monday, sources close to the situation suggested that
Bertelsmann is likely to block Middelhoff's dream for a public
offering by buying back the shares from GBL.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Voices Support for Brazil</HD>
<DH>Latin America: Upbeat comments come after Treasury
secretary O'Neill says he wouldn't endorse new aid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. government said Monday that there is "strong international
support" for Brazil in any talks the country has with the
International Monetary Fund--a day after Treasury Secretary Paul
O'Neill said he wouldn't endorse new aid to the troubled economy when
he visits next week.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neill's comment Sunday that the U.S. had no plans for new aid
triggered a 5.4% decline in the Brazilian real, the currency's
biggest one-day drop since January 1999. The real closed at 3.175 to
the dollar, after dropping as much as 8.9%. The price of Brazil's
benchmark 8% bond also tumbled. Stocks firmed, however.</LD>
<LD>   Brazilian markets have been pummeled by investor jitters over the
implications of October's presidential election for Latin America's
largest economy and its delicately balanced debt load. The prospect
of Brazil's adding to its debt, which has tripled since 1995, has
shaken investor confidence that the government can refinance its
borrowings.</LD>
<TE>   Brazil said it would send a team to the U.S. today to start talks
with the IMF over extending funds to the country. Investors have said
Brazil may seek up to $20 billion in new financing to help it defend
its currency.</TE>
<TE>   Finance Minister Pedro Malan said he expected an agreement with
the IMF soon, saying he had "no doubt that international support for
Brazil is there."</TE>
<TE>   Friction between O'Neill and the Brazilians wasn't resolved by the
latest, more upbeat comments from the Treasury.</TE>
<TE>   Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, through the Foreign
Relations Ministry, demanded that O'Neill retract remarks that
foreign aid to the country may end up in Swiss bank accounts.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill said in a TV interview Sunday that Brazil, Argentina and
Uruguay need "to assure that, as assistance money comes in, that it
does some good and doesn't just go out of the country to Swiss bank
accounts."</TE>
<TE>   Brazilian Foreign Relations Minister Celso Lafer said in a
statement Monday, "Brazil as a sovereign state cannot accept the
remarks made by O'Neill."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. ambassador to Brazil, Donna Hrinak, was scheduled to meet
with Lafer on Monday night, said Ines Lima, a presidential
spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury spokeswoman Michele Davis said, "Brazil has demonstrated
its ability over time to use international assistance effectively."</TE>
<TE>   She said the department had not received any request for an
apology or a retraction.</TE>

<HD>Budget Group Seeks Bankruptcy Protection</HD>
<DH>Travel: The car rental agency is the second to file for
Chapter 11 since November amid the sector's slowdown.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Budget Group Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection Monday as a slump
in airport car rentals after the Sept. 11 attacks doomed an attempt
to stem losses.</LD>
<LD>   Cendant Corp., the parent of rival Avis, reportedly was
considering buying Budget through bankruptcy proceedings.</LD>
<LD>   Budget spokeswoman Kimberly Mulcahy said an announcement is
expected soon.</LD>
<TE>   Daytona Beach, Fla.-based Budget, which gets about half its U.S.
revenue from rentals at airport locations, listed $4.04 billion in
assets and $4.33 billion in debts in Chapter 11 papers filed in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del.</TE>
<TE>   Airline passenger traffic, or miles flown by paying customers,
remained as much as 14% lower at some major U.S. airlines in June
compared with a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic also had declined in 2001 because of a slowdown in
business travel.</TE>
<TE>   Airline executives have said some travelers have switched to
driving their cars or taking trains for shorter distances.</TE>
<TE>   "The impact of Sept. 11 and the continued recession in the travel
sector" left the company with debts "greater than our operations can
reasonably support," Budget Chief Executive Sandy Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   Budget became the second car rental company to file for Chapter 11
since November, when ANC Rental Corp., the parent of Alamo Rent-A-Car
and National Car Rental, asked for bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   Class A shares of Budget, which reported $2.43 billion in fiscal
2000 sales and a $604.6-million loss, fell 2 cents, to 13 cents, in
over-the-counter trading.</TE>
<TE>   Budget said it has obtained a $100-million line of credit to
continue operations during the bankruptcy process and a $750-million
loan to upgrade its rental fleet.</TE>
<TE>   New York-based Cendant, the world's largest hotel franchiser,
declined to comment. Shares of Cendant rose $1.20 to $14.25 in New
York Stock Exchange trading.</TE>

<HD>Dynegy to Sell Gas Pipeline to MidAmerican</HD>
<DH>Deals: It is the second time this year the unit of Warren
Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has snapped up assets from a
cash-strapped energy merchant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dynegy Inc. agreed to sell a natural-gas pipeline for $928 million to
MidAmerican Energy Holdings, a unit of Warren Buffett's Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. that has been buying energy assets.</LD>
<LD>   MidAmerican also agreed to assume $950 million in debt to acquire
the 16,600-mile Northern Natural Gas pipeline system, which runs from
Texas to the Great Lakes, the companies said.</LD>
<LD>   Dynegy acquired Northern from Enron Corp. for $1.5 billion in cash
and $950 million of assumed debt. It is selling assets after energy
trading declined and credit dried up. The purchase is the second this
year for MidAmerican, which paid $960 million to Williams Cos. in
March for the Kern River gas pipeline.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Dynegy, which have fallen 97% in the last year, rose 52
cents to $1.20 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
Berkshire Hathaway shares rose $4,655, or 7.3%, to $68,305.</TE>
<TE>   "This will cut Dynegy's cash flow and earnings, but right now,
it's about survival for them," said Reed Wasden &amp; Associates analyst
Aaron Tyler, who rates Dynegy shares "hold" and owns none.</TE>
<TE>   Buffett represents a "shrewd new player" among pipeline owners
exploiting "fire sales" by companies that need to raise cash, said
Carol Freedenthal of Jofree Energy Consulting of Houston. Northern
Natural can deliver 4.3 billion cubic feet of gas a day and has links
with other U.S. pipelines.</TE>
<TE>   MidAmerican is "getting some marvelous assets at great prices,"
Reed Wasden's Tyler said, which had valued the pipeline system at
$2.5 billion. "It gives them a nice presence in the natural-gas
business."</TE>
<TE>   Given "current market conditions for fixed assets, we believe we
received a fair price for the pipeline," Dynegy spokesman Steve
Stengel said. Dynegy had said Northern Natural would contribute $90
million a year to its earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy is trying to raise $2 billion after the company's cash flow
dwindled and its credit rating was cut to junk by Standard &amp; Poor's.
The Houston-based company canceled a $325-million bond offering by
its Illinois utility last week.</TE>
<TE>   Standard &amp; Poor's said the sale wouldn't affect Dynegy's credit
rating for now because the transaction "relieves some near-term
liquidity issues."</TE>
<TE>   S&amp;P put Northern Natural Gas debt on CreditWatch with positive
implications, reflecting MidAmerican's higher credit rating.</TE>
<TE>   "This could really pull Dynegy out of the fire," Tyler said. "They
may be getting enough cash for them to survive the next year and a
half." He had expected Dynegy to get $650 million from selling a
non-controlling 50% stake in Northern Natural, as the company had
announced in May.</TE>
<TE>   Stengel said the 100% sale of Northern Natural "doesn't change our
strategy at all. We are continuing with the other elements of our
capital and liquidity plan."</TE>
<TE>   Elimination of the Northern Natural debt will leave Dynegy with a
$300-million maturity in November and no other significant loans
maturing until May, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Cash from the sale may make it easier for Dynegy to keep a
controlling interest in other businesses it sells, Tyler said. "This
really puts them in a much better position to sell stakes in other
assets," he said. "If you're going halves with Dynegy, you're going
to want to know your partner will still be around."</TE>

<HD>Judge Seeks Specifics in First Alliance Suit</HD>
<DH>Courts: Complaint must be rewritten to explain claim
against Prudential and First Union.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First Alliance Corp. customers who claim Prudential Financial Inc.
and Wachovia Corp.'s First Union helped the mortgage lender deceive
them must add more specifics to their lawsuit, a federal judge ruled
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   At a hearing in Santa Ana, Judge David O. Carter told the
plaintiff's attorney, Richard Scruggs, to submit a new complaint that
details how the First Alliance mortgage customers learned of the
fraud they claim was committed by Prudential and First Union.</LD>
<LD>   First Alliance, formerly one of the nation's largest lenders to
people with spotty credit, agreed in March to pay as much as $60
million to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that it deceived
borrowers. First Alliance targeted customers with poor credit
histories and failed to give accurate information about the costs of
their loans, the agency charged in its 2000 lawsuit.</LD>
<TE>   "We are very confident" we can rewrite the complaint to Carter's
specifications, said Scruggs, a Mississippi lawyer who helped
negotiate a settlement in 1998 between state attorneys general and
tobacco companies.</TE>
<TE>   First Union and Prudential couldn't immediately be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   The consumer suit, filed in February by First Alliance customers,
says the financial service companies extended lines of credit to
First Alliance when the mortgage company engaged in predatory
lending. The plaintiffs, who plan to seek class-action status, are
asking for unspecified damages.</TE>
<TE>   The FTC settlement doesn't prevent customers from pursuing suits
against First Alliance's bankers, who funded the mortgages and
bundled them for sale as securities.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine-based First Alliance filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection in 2000. The company blamed the bankruptcy filing in part
on "unwarranted negative publicity." First Union is a unit of
Wachovia. Shares of its Charlotte-based parent rose $1.82 to $35.25.
Newark, N.J.-based Prudential shares rose $1.94 to $32.20, both on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Ex-GE Exec Accused of Insider Trading</HD>
<DH>Probe: Charges stem from conglomerate's purchase last year
of Heller Financial. A second man surrenders to federal authorities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former General Electric Capital Corp. executive and a kung fu
instructor have been charged in an insider-trading scheme stemming
from General Electric's purchase last year of Heller Financial Inc.,
federal prosecutors said on Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Anthony Chrysikos, 39, of Edgewater, N.J., a former vice president
of finance in the aircraft services division of General Electric
Capital Corp., surrendered on Friday and was released on a $350,000
personal recognizance bond. GE Capital is a unit of Fairfield,
Conn.-based General Electric Co.</LD>
<LD>   The other defendant, Michael Martello, 35, who was living in
Taiwan at the time of the alleged scheme, surrendered to federal
authorities on Monday and was expected to be arraigned in federal
court in Manhattan.</LD>
<TE>   If convicted, both men face a maximum sentence of five years in
prison on one conspiracy count and 10 years in prison on each of four
securities fraud counts.</TE>
<TE>   GE Capital announced a $5.3-billion cash tender offer for Heller
Financial's stock on July 30, 2001. Heller Financial is a commercial
lender based in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint alleges that Chrysikos, who had been a member of the
GE Capital deal team involved in the Heller Financial transaction,
tipped off Martello. Martello allegedly purchased Heller Financial
call options before the deal was publicly announced and later sold
them at a $157,259 profit.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office said he did
not know the relationship between the two men.</TE>
<TE>   The two defendants were named in a related civil suit filed by the
Securities and Exchange Commission in March.</TE>

<HD>L.A. May Aid Crenshaw Project</HD>
<DH>Development: Officials propose $42.2 million in public
funds to rebuild Santa Barbara Plaza.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles city and redevelopment officials are proposing to
contribute $42.2 million in public funds to help a private developer
transform the Crenshaw District's tattered Santa Barbara Plaza into a
retail and residential complex.</LD>
<LD>   The aid package, which is considered crucial to any development of
the 22-acre property, is scheduled for a vote Wednesday before the
Community Redevelopment Agency's Board of Commissioners. If approved,
the proposal would go to the City Council for a final decision.</LD>
<LD>   The $125-million project, located immediately to the west of
Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, is
called Marlton Square. It would include 140,000 square feet of new
retail space in addition to 140 single-family homes, 180 affordable
senior apartments and a small park.</LD>
<TE>   Securing the infusion of public investment is necessary to make
Marlton Square, particularly the retail portion, financially viable,
said Christopher Hammond, chief executive of Los Angeles-based
Capital Vision Equities, which is developing the project in a joint
venture with an investment firm owned by football star Keyshawn
Johnson. The $42.2 million in public investment in the project
includes more than $30 million in federal government housing grants
and loans in addition to other forms of financial assistance.</TE>
<TE>   "The question we have received constantly is 'Where is the
subsidy?' " said Hammond, whose firm developed nearby Chesterfield
Square.</TE>
<TE>   Marlton Square is the most recent in a string of redevelopment
proposals for the Santa Barbara Plaza property. In late 1999, the
redevelopment agency pulled the plug on a development proposal by
former basketball star Earvin "Magic" Johnson, whose development firm
built the successful Magic Johnson Theatres adjacent to the property.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Johnson's proposal, which was said to have suffered from a
lack of political support, the project now up for consideration has
the backing of Mayor James K. Hahn's office and that of Councilman
Mark Ridley-Thomas, who represents the area.</TE>
<TE>   "Both offices are very eager to see this happen," said Jonathan
Kevles, deputy mayor for economic development. "The project as
currently envisioned speaks to a lot of needs in the community. That
type of development will be much welcomed in the community and will
be economically viable."</TE>
<TE>   Capital Vision Equities has teamed with the Lee Group, a housing
developer, to build the for-sale housing portion on the southern part
of the site and is working on a final agreement with another
developer for the retail complex, which would face Martin Luther King
Jr. Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   The Marlton Square proposal also calls for creating a retail
promenade along Marlton Avenue, which separates the development site
from the mall and the Magic Johnson Theatres, to create a stronger
connection among the retail centers, Hammond said.</TE>

<HD>Firms' Internal Memos Posted on New Web Site</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The publisher of a profane Web site that skewers troubled companies
launched a new online service Monday showcasing the correspondence of
top executives and managers.</LD>
<LD>   InternalMemos.com is the brainchild of Philip J. Kaplan, a
wisecracking high-tech contractor who touched a nerve in May 2000
when he launched a sarcastic Web site ridiculing dead dot-coms.</LD>
<LD>   The name of Kaplan's original site, which attracts as many as 4
million visitors per month, is a vulgar twist on the high-tech
magazine Fast Company, which hailed the rise of dot-coms in the late
1990s.</LD>
<TE>   Kaplan is taking a more straightforward approach with
InternalMemos.com. The site contains about 800 memos sent to him
during the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   Access to one or two memos each day is free. Kaplan intends to
charge a $45 monthly subscription to view all the material at
www.internalmemos.com. Subscribers willing to pay $75 per month will
get unlimited access to InternalMemos and Kaplan's popular Web site
focusing on failed companies.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's free sample featured a note from KFSO Communications
advising its employees not to destroy any internal records from Jan.
1. 1997, through July 1, 2002, at the request of Kinko's.</TE>
<TE>   Kaplan eventually hopes to post thousands of memos ranging from
highly sensitive information to mundane material like the menu in the
corporate cafeteria. "I'm more interested in quantity than quality,"
Kaplan said Monday.</TE>

<HD>Merrill Pressed by Enron</HD>
<DH>Probe: The brokerage upgraded energy trader's stock in
exchange for investment banking deals, Senate aides say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Enron Corp. pressed Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. to upgrade its investment
recommendation on the energy trader's stock in 1998 in exchange for
investment banking business, Senate investigators said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Merrill changed its Enron analysts, and its rating on Enron's
stock was upgraded from "neutral" to "accumulate." Enron included
Merrill as a co-manager of a $750-million equity offering from which
Merrill had been excluded, Senate aides said, citing internal memos,
e-mails and interviews.</LD>
<LD>   Merrill said it earned $40 million to $50 million in fees,
investigators said.</LD>
<TE>   "It is clear that your responsive message was appreciated by the
company and any animosity in that regard seems to have dissipated in
the ensuing months," the firm's investment banking division wrote
Jan. 18, 1999, to its president, Herb Allison, according to a copy of
the e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations is looking
into the role financial institutions played in the collapse of the
largest energy trader. Enron's dealings with Merrill will be
discussed at a committee hearing today.</TE>
<TE>   The e-mail's stated purpose was to update Merrill's "relationship
with Enron since you spoke to their CEO Ken Lay last spring regarding
our difficult relationship in research."</TE>
<TE>   Schuyler Tilney, head of energy investment banking at Merrill and
an author of an April 1998 memo asking Merrill's management to
intervene with Enron, will invoke his 5th Amendment right not to
speak, committee staff said.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill spokesman Bill Halldin said the firm's research was never
compromised. Allison "was not asked to do anything related to our
research," Halldin said of the contacts with Lay.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill analyst Donato Eassey said that the subcommittee was wrong
to allege any connection between the firm's investment banking
business and his rating on Enron's stock. Eassey was among the first
analysts to downgrade Enron, dropping it to a "neutral" in August
1999 when former CEO Jeffrey Skilling resigned. "People thought I
overreacted," Eassey said.</TE>
<TE>   "For the story to come out the way the Senate is trying to spin it
is just frustrating," Eassey said. "I'm ticked."</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Justice a few weeks ago informed Tilney and
Robert Furst, a former Merrill investment banker also called by the
subcommittee, that the department was conducting a criminal
investigation into Enron's dealings, the subcommittee staff said.
After that, both decided not to testify. Merrill has said it is
cooperating with the probe and the company hasn't been informed it is
a target.</TE>
<TE>   Among the issues being examined by the Justice Department is
examining a transaction in which Enron sold an interest in barges in
Nigeria to an offshore company established by Merrill Lynch,
according to the brokerage and Senate sources. Investigators are
trying to determine whether the transaction allowed Enron to
artificially inflate its profits, the sources said Monday, speaking
on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   The three barges in Nigeria are used to generate electricity.
Enron asked Merrill Lynch in December 1999 to invest $7 million in
them so that Enron's African division could record a $12-million gain
on the transaction and meet its earnings target, according to the
subcommittee investigators. Enron gave Merrill Lynch a guarantee that
it would arrange the resale of the brokerage firm's interest in the
barges at a profit within six months, the investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   "It appears that Merrill Lynch, like other financial institutions,
... knowingly participated in deals that were used to make Enron's
financial position appear more robust than it actually was,"
subcommittee chairman Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) said in a statement.
"Merrill's desire to make money from Enron and stay in Enron's good
graces apparently superseded professional responsibilities and
reputational and financial concerns."</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch spokesman William Halldin said the brokerage firm
"believes its dealings with Enron ... were appropriate and proper
based on what we knew at the time."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Merrill Lynch said it had placed Tilney on
administrative leave for his decision not to testify before Congress.
Furst, a former managing director of Merrill Lynch in Dallas, will
testify voluntarily, his attorney Ira Sorkin said Monday.</TE>

<HD>M&amp;F Settles Investors' Suit</HD>
<DH>Courts: Billionaire financier Ronald Perelman agrees to
cancel the sale of his stake in Panavision.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ronald Perelman canceled the $128-million sale of his stake in
movie-camera maker Panavision Inc. to another company he controls,
settling investor claims that he arranged the deal to get out of a
bad investment.</LD>
<LD>   M&amp;F Worldwide Inc., which is controlled by the billionaire
financier, agreed to return the 83% stake in Panavision and debt that
Perelman sold it in exchange for $90.1 million in cash and stock he
valued at $48 million, M&amp;F officials and shareholders said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   M&amp;F shares rose $1.17, or 28%, to $5.27 in New York Stock Exchange
trading Monday. The shares have risen 21% over the last 12 months.</LD>
<TE>   "This was an absolutely ludicrous transaction that had to be
stopped," said Mario Cibelli, a money manager for Robotti &amp; Co.,
which held more than 50,000 M&amp;F shares as of May and was among the
investors who sued. "It's been a long, painful road, but the
shareholders have finally prevailed."</TE>
<TE>   Perelman decided to pay back the money to licorice supplier M&amp;F,
of which he owns 53%, and take back the Panavision shares to end more
than two years of litigation over the acquisition, M&amp;F officials
said. Other M&amp;F shareholders argued in their suits that the buyout
was designed to bail the billionaire out of his Panavision
investment.</TE>
<TE>   "This litigation has made it impossible to pursue certain
strategic initiatives at Panavision," said Howard Gittis, M&amp;F's chief
executive.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Woodland Hills-based Panavision last traded at $2.74 on
Thursday. The New York Stock Exchange said Monday that it is moving
to delist the shares.</TE>
<TE>   A one-week trial was held in January in Delaware Chancery Court
before a tentative settlement was reached that would have given
disgruntled M&amp;F stockholders a $2.15 per-share dividend to drop the
suit. Judge Leo Strine Jr. rejected that plan as inadequate and trial
resumed July 9.</TE>
<TE>   Investors who alleged the Panavision purchase unfairly diluted
M&amp;F's value called the settlement a victory for the company's
shareholders. They claimed in the suit that Perelman leaned on M&amp;F's
board to buy his stake.</TE>
<TE>   "It tells independent directors that they have to be truly
independent and do what's best for all shareholders," said Daniel
Breen III, president of Furtherfield Partners, an M&amp;F shareholder who
sued over the Panavision deal. Furtherfield Partners is a hedge fund
that holds more than 50,000 M&amp;F shares.</TE>

<HD>Qwest Revision May Take Months</HD>
<DH>Telecom: CEO says the firm, which has admitted to
misstating results, will not be able to meet an August deadline.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A day after Qwest Communications International Inc. admitted
misreporting at least $1.16 billion in revenue, the phone company
said Monday it may take months to restate its financial reports.</LD>
<LD>   The improper bookkeeping, which will force restatement of
financial results for 2000 and 2001, heightened fears that the
Denver-based carrier may be felled by its $26 billion in debt.</LD>
<LD>   Investors sent the company's shares down as much as 26% during
Wall Street's big rally Monday but reversed course enough for the
stock to close at $1.49, down 1 cent. About 46.5 million shares
changed hands, more than triple the stock's average daily volume on
the New York Stock Exchange.</LD>
<TE>   Richard Notebaert, who replaced longtime Chief Executive Joseph
Nacchio last month, said in a conference call that the company
improperly accounted for sales of telecommunications capacity on its
fiber-optic network from 1999 through 2001 and also made mistakes
recording equipment sales and accounting for certain expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Notebaert said the company's review won't be completed for several
months and that Qwest would not issue restated financial reports
until then.</TE>
<TE>   The company plans to announce its second-quarter results Aug. 8,
as planned, but Notebaert and Qwest Chief Financial Officer Oren
Shaffer will not sign off on the company's financial statements by
Aug. 14, as required under new federal rules.</TE>
<TE>   Notebaert said the two executives would notify the Securities and
Exchange Commission that they could not comply because of the pending
restatements and ongoing investigations into the company's accounting
practices.</TE>
<TE>   "Qwest needs to come clean, and it's in the process of coming
clean with the government investigators and investors," said Scott
Cleland, CEO of Precursor Group, an independent research firm. "Qwest
has a good new management team, but they're going to need some luck
and goodwill from investors, the government and the banks to weather
this storm."</TE>
<TE>   Cleland and others say the telecommunication firm's biggest
worries are its more than $26 billion in total debt and the growing
possibility of defaulting on some requirements under key bank
agreements, which require Qwest to maintain a certain ratio of debt
to EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the accounting errors involve the company's QwestDex
Yellow Pages unit, which Qwest plans to sell to help reduce debt. If
the expected restatement significantly changes the financials at
QwestDex, Qwest may not get the expected price of $8 billion to $10
billion for the unit and so will have less cash to pay down debt.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a company that is not going out of business, but it's a
matter of whether the company is worth enough to support the debt,"
said analyst Richard Klugman of Jefferies &amp; Co., which downgraded the
stock to "sell" Monday. Jefferies does not have investment banking
business with Qwest. Klugman said he has a small, passive investment
in the firm.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Qwest executives acknowledged that they are talking
with the company's "financial partners," but they would not discuss
whether the coming financial restatements would trigger more onerous
requirements from the banks.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest said that it incorrectly accounted for fiber-optic capacity
sales to other carriers under long-term contracts, a type of
transaction that has come under fire as a way for telecommunications
firms to inflate revenue.</TE>
<TE>   In cases involving Enron Corp., Global Crossing Ltd. and others,
investigators believe the companies engaged in roughly equivalent
capacity "swaps" with each other, giving both firms a "sale" even
though neither company collected additional cash.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest officials would not characterize the problems with its
capacity sales, except to say that the misstatement involved about
$1.16 billion in revenue from 1999 to 2001, representing about 18% of
the company's capacity sales during that period.</TE>
<TE>   The company and its new auditor, KPMG, also discovered bookkeeping
problems involving the sale of equipment and the purchase of certain
services from other carriers.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest once was primarily a long-distance provider, but it became
the dominant local phone service provider in 14 Western states when
it bought US West in 2000. That deal has provided Qwest with a steady
flow of cash in the midst of cratering prices for long-distance
service and plummeting demand for high-volume data connections.</TE>

<HD>Industry Icon Key Matchmaker in Merger of Northrop, TRW</HD>
<DH>Aerospace: Simon Ramo, 89, saw benefits of the marriage
early on.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The $7.8-billion merger between Northrop Grumman Corp. and TRW Inc.
had all the players typical in a big corporate deal: Wall Street
bankers, lawyers and top corporate executives.</LD>
<LD>   But a key role in orchestrating the deal was played by someone
unrecognized as being a power broker, a man--many years older than
Pope John Paul II--who until recently was known for his violin
playing and as an architect of the nation's first intercontinental
ballistic missiles.</LD>
<LD>   Simon Ramo, 89, who co-founded TRW in the 1950s, is credited with
helping bring together Northrop Grumman and TRW, making him one of
the oldest matchmakers in corporate America.</LD>
<TE>   After more than four months of wrangling, Northrop and TRW struck
a friendly deal earlier this month to create the nation's
second-largest military contractor. It culminated Northrop's
remarkable transformation from a struggling bit player to a defense
industry powerhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Ramo retired from TRW nearly a quarter century ago. But executives
and directors for both Northrop and TRW, most of whom spoke on
condition they not be identified, said Ramo was instrumental in
working behind the scenes to bring the haggling companies together,
often acting as the "sounding board" and ultimately a key source of
intelligence for both sides.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop Chairman Kent Kresa was coy about Ramo's exact role, but
acknowledged that Ramo "certainly understood the importance of the
marriage" and "he talks to a lot of people and he's involved in
everything."</TE>
<TE>   Ramo declined to comment about the scope of his involvement,
saying only that "acquisitions and mergers are always under
discussion."</TE>
<TE>   "I know a lot of people in the industry. Many of them worked for
me, so when they call and ask for advice, I give it to them," Ramo
said.</TE>
<TE>   Ramo was far more engaged with the deal than he will publicly
acknowledge. In fact, it was Ramo's urging that prompted Northrop and
TRW to begin talking about a possible merger as far back as six years
ago, sources familiar with the process said. He arranged the first of
many meetings between TRW and Northrop.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, in more recent discussions, Ramo wasn't shy about giving
advice to TRW directors looking for guidance on how they should
respond to Northrop's offer, predicting at the onset in late February
that Northrop might have to raise its bid to $60 a share to get the
deal done. After initially offering $47 a share, Northrop raised the
bid three more times, to $53, then $58 and finally to $60.</TE>
<TE>   Former TRW executives say Ramo began to believe more than a decade
ago that TRW was becoming a marginal player in the defense industry
as consolidation created a handful of powerful behemoths and as TRW
became distracted with diversifying into automotive parts and other
commercial endeavors.</TE>
<TE>   "He had the idea of breaking TRW into pieces and merging the
defense business with Northrop," a former executive said. "He didn't
lose sight of it even after all this time."</TE>
<TE>   The idea became particularly attractive to Ramo in the last year,
according to sources, partly because of Ronald Sugar, who worked at
TRW for 20 years and eventually headed the company's space and
defense electronics business in Redondo Beach before bolting to
Litton Industries Inc. after he had been passed over for TRW's top
job. When Northrop acquired Litton last year, Sugar became Northrop's
president, making him the likely successor to Kresa.</TE>
<TE>   Ramo has told close friends that he considers Sugar his top
"prodigy," a remarkable statement considering that some of the more
notable names in aerospace have worked for Ramo at one time or
another, including three heads of NASA.</TE>
<TE>   Ramo's associates and former employers say it's not surprising
that Ramo would have been so engaged in the merger despite his age.
"He kept an active interest in what we were doing and he still does,"
said Edsel D. Dunford, who was TRW's president in the early 1990s.
"He still visits TRW operations to look at specific projects. He's
mind is very sharp."</TE>
<TE>   Ramo has also kept up physically, although he gave up tennis two
years ago after his longtime partner couldn't play anymore. He also
stopped playing the violin, a casualty of arthritis that hindered the
kind of finger dexterity that once allowed Ramo to play quartets with
professionals and a duet with Jascha Heifetz.</TE>
<TE>   But age hasn't stopped Ramo from going to his West Hollywood
office from his Beverly Hills home daily, working the telephones and
meeting key industry officials for lunch at the Four Seasons Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Top TRW executives fly into Los Angeles four times a year to meet
with Ramo, who shares his thoughts about the industry and the
company, often espousing what some younger executives would consider
grandiose ideas. Making the list of those going to the meetings is
considered a hallmark of success at TRW.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was first introduced, I was prepared to provide a lot of
input but I found out quickly he prefers to provide the input,"
Dunford said.</TE>
<TE>   Ramo's comments are legendary for capsulizing some of the more
complex ideas into off-the-cuff witticisms. During a series of key
experiments of ballistic missiles in the 1950s at Cape Canaveral,
Fla., at which Ramo and Air Force Gen. Bernard Schriever were
observers, test rockets kept blowing up on their launching pads. When
at last one missile rose about 6 inches before toppling over and
exploding, Ramo reportedly beamed and said: "Well, Benny, now that we
know the thing can fly, all we have to do is improve its range a
bit."</TE>
<TE>   Ramo co-founded the predecessor to TRW in 1953 with a Caltech
classmate, Dean Wooldridge, setting up the business in a Los Angeles
barbershop. In an unprecedented move, the Pentagon awarded a contract
to the fledgling firm to oversee development of the nation's
ballistic missile system, the most ambitious military program at the
time.</TE>
<TE>   Ramo and Wooldridge were featured on the cover of Time magazine in
April 1957, shortly before they would merge their operations with
auto parts maker Thompson Products Inc. to create TRW.</TE>
<TE>   With the exception of the auto parts business, which Northrop
intends to sell or spin off, Northrop does not plan to keep the TRW
moniker for the remaining businesses.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview recently, Ramo said he didn't care much for the
irony of him helping bring together the deal that would eventually
bring to an end the name he created. "I have no emotional attachment
to the name," said Ramo, the "R" in TRW. "I'm kind of happy with the
deal because the two together is more capable and worth more than if
they were separate. Names come and go."</TE>

<LD>The Treasury Department sold $16 billion in three-month bills at a
discount rate of 1.68%, up from 1.66% last week. An additional $16
billion in six-month bills was sold at a rate of 1.69%, up from
1.675%.</LD>
<LD>   The new discount rates understate the actual return to
investors--1.712% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,957.50, and 1.727% for a six-month bill selling for $9,914.60.</LD>
<LD>   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield
for one-year constant-maturity Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable-rate mortgages, fell to 1.88% last
week from 1.97% the week before.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of Exult Inc. lost more than half their value after the
Irvine-based company said it will ask the Securities and Exchange
Commission for information about an accounting method.</LD>
<LD>   Exult, an operator of human resources departments for large
companies, said it will ask the SEC whether it should start
percentage of completion accounting, without describing the method.</LD>
<LD>   The company said it is unable to estimate the effect of this
accounting method on financial results. Spokesman Javier Mendoza said
he had no further comment.</LD>
<TE>   Exult shares fell to as low as $2.59 in extended trading. The
stock had closed up 39 cents at $4.60 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, Exult reported a second-quarter net loss of
$4.5 million, or 4 cents a share, compared with a year-ago loss of
$20.3 million, or 23 cents, on a 57% jump in revenue to $100.9
million.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The chief executives of J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. and Citigroup Inc.
said they were unaware of offshore units central to a U.S. Senate
probe into their banks' ties to energy trader Enron Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Citigroup Chairman and CEO Sanford "Sandy" Weill and J.P. Morgan
CEO William Harrison said they had no personal knowledge of offshore
entities that congressional investigators allege were used by the
banks to assist Enron's deceptive accounting.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has accused
Citigroup and J.P. Morgan of providing Enron with $8.5 billion in
loans disguised as commodity trades conducted through offshore firms
such as Delta Energy and Mahonia Ltd.</LD>
<TE>   The deals allowed Enron to artificially inflate cash flow and hide
debt, which boosted its share price and ultimately led the stock to
crash and the company to collapse in December.</TE>
<TE>   The banks' shares rose after being battered early last week on
concerns the companies would be held liable for deals they set up for
Enron. J.P. Morgan stock rose 12.8%, or $2.85 a share, to $25.10,
while Citigroup stock finished up 8.4%, or $2.57, at $33.31, both on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<LD>United Airlines plans to stop issuing paper tickets in the U.S. by
July 2003 and worldwide by January 2004 to cut costs at the world's
second-largest carrier.</LD>
<LD>   From Thursday until July 2003, customers in the U.S. who ask for
paper tickets and are eligible for an electronic version will have to
pay a $20 fee, the UAL Corp. unit said. Customers outside the U.S.
won't be charged the fee. United's action follows a similar move last
month by AMR Corp.'s American Airlines, its larger rival.</LD>
<LD>   About 70% of United's tickets already are issued in electronic
form, a spokeswoman said.</LD>

<HD>Rebound Has a Down Side: Mortgages Likely to Jump</HD>
<DH>Dollar gains against euro, yen, indicating foreign shift
back into U.S. equities.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street's rebound Monday was broad and deep, adding to many
analysts' confidence that stocks have reached at least a temporary
bottom.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of smaller companies and technology issues posted some of
the day's best gains, catching up to blue chips, which had sparked
the market's turnaround last Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   But what was good for stocks was bad for Treasury bonds and gold,
as some investors yanked money from those traditional safe havens in
favor of equities.</LD>
<TE>   Experts warn potential home buyers and homeowners hoping to
refinance that if Treasury bond yields continue to resurge, mortgage
rates are almost certain to rise as well. Average 30-year home loan
rates fell to 6.34% last week, the lowest in a generation.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday the 10-year T-note yield, a benchmark for mortgages,
jumped to 4.55% from Friday's 4.38%, as some investors cashed out of
bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Shorter-term Treasury yields, which on Friday traded at their
lowest levels since at least the 1970s, also rocketed. The 2-year
T-note yield jumped to 2.39% Monday from 2.22% Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury yields have plunged over the last 10 weeks as the stock
market has dived. Government securities were viewed by many investors
as the safest place to stash cash as shares crumbled.</TE>
<TE>   But bond pros have warned that Treasury yields had gotten so low
they were at risk of serious whiplash if and when the stock market
began to recover and fear levels receded.</TE>
<TE>   A buyer of a five-year T-note on Friday locked in an annualized
yield of just 3.39%. By Monday's close, the yield on newly purchased
bonds had soared to 3.58%.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody who bought a five-year Treasury note as a long-term
investment last week had to have a few screws loose," said John
Lonski, economist at Moody's Investors Service in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Though some of the buying of recent weeks may have been from
long-term investors, the Treasury market also has been riled by
short-term traders riding the rally as far as it would go, analysts
say.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the stock market's woes have left many companies unable to
issue bonds. With a dearth of supply in the corporate bond arena,
Treasuries attracted money that might otherwise have been earmarked
for corporate issues.</TE>
<TE>   But if the slide in stock prices has been halted, more money is
likely to exit the Treasury market in search of higher-return
options, Lonski and others say.</TE>
<TE>   "If the equity market continues to recover, bond yields are going
to move higher," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He estimated that the 10-year T-note yield could rise back above
5% for the first time since June 10, if the Standard &amp; Poor's 500
stock index rebounds another 10% to 15%.</TE>
<TE>   James Glassman, economist at J.P.Morgan Chase Securities New York,
noted that the drop in Treasury yields as stocks have tumbled has
cushioned the economy by bolstering the housing market.</TE>
<TE>   But if equity prices rebound, he said, the economy won't need as
much help from housing.</TE>
<TE>   "If stocks' losses are going to be recovered, then we don't need
interest rates this low," Glassman said.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the key question is whether the stock market can
sustain its turnaround. Trading volume Monday was below recent peaks,
which disappointed some analysts who were looking for a tidal wave of
buying interest.</TE>
<TE>   But laggard sections of the market picked up steam, indicating
that investors were looking far and wide for bargains.</TE>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 600 small-stock index jumped 5.6% Monday, a
slightly better gain than the blue-chip S&amp;P 500's 5.4% advance.</TE>
<TE>   And many beaten-down technology stocks soared. The Nasdaq 100
index, home to the some of the nation's biggest tech names, jumped
6.5%.</TE>
<TE>   It still trails the gains that blue-chip indexes have racked up
since July 23, when most indexes hit their lows in the latest
sell-off.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts have been encouraged by the rebound in the dollar over
the last week. On Monday the dollar jumped to 119.79 yen from 118.85
on Friday, and now is the highest since July 5.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar also gained against the euro, which fell to 98.1 cents
Monday from 98.8 cents Friday.</TE>
<TE>   A strengthening dollar suggests that foreign investors are moving
capital back into U.S. equities. The dollar's weakness since April
has been attributed in part to concerns that foreign investors were
losing faith in U.S. assets.</TE>
<TE>   Glassman said the dollar got a boost from the U.S. House of
Representatives' vote on Saturday to give President Bush authority to
negotiate broad new trade agreements.</TE>
<TE>   "Outsiders felt the U.S. was heading down a protectionist path,"
Glassman said. But that view may have changed with the House vote, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Gold prices eased Monday, reflecting falling fear levels.
Near-term gold futures slid 90 cents to $302.40 an ounce in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Among Monday's market highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Blue chips leading the Dow's 447.49-point, 5.4% gain, to
8,711.88, included General Electric, up $2.65 to $30.45; Honeywell,
up $2.47 to $33.12; 3M, up $5.81 to $126.66; and Procter &amp; Gamble, up
$3.02 to $87.22.</TE>
<TE>   * Bank stocks were strong. Citigroup jumped $2.57 to $33.31 and
J.P. Morgan gained $2.85 to $25.10.</TE>
<TE>   * In the tech sector IBM rose $4.78 to $71.18, Intel added $1.08
to $18.89 and Brocade Communications was up $2.13 to $18.67.</TE>
<TE>   * Among retail shares, Sears rose $2.58 to $49.75, Target gained
$2.29 to $35.29 and Best Buy was up $3.19 to $32.35.</TE>
<TE>   * Home builders soared despite the risk that mortgage rates may
increase. Lennar surged $3.73 to $52.45 and KB Home rose $4.17 to
$47.80.</TE>
<TE>   * Falling gold prices failed to scare some investors away from
gold mining stocks. Barrick Gold jumped 84 cents to $14.75 and Agnico
Eagle leaped $1.23 to $11.34.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Adobe Systems Inc. and rival Macromedia Inc. have agreed to settle
patent lawsuits between the firms.</LD>
<LD>   Terms were not disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   A federal jury on May 10 ordered Adobe to pay Macromedia $4.91
million for patents covering computer graphics and sound-systems
software.</LD>
<TE>   A separate jury on May 2 returned a $2.82-million verdict against
Macromedia for infringing Adobe's patent to organize tools on a
computer screen.</TE>
<TE>   The patent cases between the companies began two years ago when
Adobe sued Macromedia in federal court in Delaware. Macromedia filed
its own patent-infringement suit last year against Adobe in federal
court in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Adobe shares rose $1.12 to $25.61 and Macromedia shares rose 82
cents to $8.05, both on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi May Cut Paris, N.Y. Jobs</HD>
<DH>Media: Staff reductions to trim costs are urged by
management consultants who were hired by firm's recently ousted CEO.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CORIE BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an effort to cut costs, financially strapped Vivendi Universal
may eliminate more than half of its 200 staff positions in New York
as well as reduce by 25% the 370 staff positions at the French
utility and media conglomerate's Paris headquarters.</LD>
<LD>   "We have, over the past few months, been studying ways in which to
develop Paris and New York into a more efficient organization," said
a Vivendi spokesperson, who verified that the proposed staff cuts
were recommended by management consultants hired by former Chairman
Jean-Marie Messier. Exactly which jobs would be eliminated and when
have not been announced.</LD>
<LD>   After Messier moved from Paris to New York a year ago, he hired
Constantin Group to analyze the need for two separate corporate
staffs. But by the time the management consultants finished their
report this month, Messier had been ousted by the Vivendi board and
new Chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou had made it clear he would stay in
Paris. Vivendi shares have fallen more than 70% as the company
struggles under a $19-billion debt burden.</LD>
<TE>   In all, Vivendi plans to cut 230 jobs, according to sources
familiar with the company's plans--100 positions in Paris and 130 in
New York.</TE>
<TE>   The single largest New York department is human resources,
followed by the aviation staff, which manages the company's fleet of
private planes. The next largest staff handles information
technology.</TE>
<TE>   Teams of lawyers, accountants and investor relations and
communication specialists also are based in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The management consultants did not review staffs at either of
Vivendi's American entertainment companies, Universal Studios Inc.
and Universal Music Group.</TE>

<HD>WorldCom Hires Turnaround Experts</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Long-distance phone company also says it soon will
transfer customers of its wireless business to rival carriers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WorldCom Inc. on Monday added two turnaround specialists to its
executive team to help the phone company recover from the nation's
largest bankruptcy filing.</LD>
<LD>   In other developments Monday, WorldCom said it soon will transfer
its wireless customers to other carriers, and said its two stocks
would be removed from the Nasdaq stock market as of the opening of
trading today.</LD>
<LD>   The Clinton, Miss.-based company, which filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection July 21, said shares representing its MCI
consumer long-distance telephone business will trade under the new
symbol MCWEQ, and the core WorldCom shares will trade as WCOEQ.</LD>
<TE>   To help turn the telecommunications giant around, WorldCom hired
Gregory F. Rayburn as chief restructuring officer, and John S. Dubel
as chief financial officer. Both men are executives at the
restructuring firm AlixPartners and, pending U.S. Bankruptcy Court
approval, will report to John W. Sidgmore, WorldCom's chief executive
since the ouster in April of longtime CEO Bernard J. Ebbers.</TE>
<TE>   "Their task will be to support our efforts to emerge from
reorganization as quickly as possible with a healthy business,"
Sidgmore said. He said the pair will negotiate with creditors,
evaluate proposals, distribute key information to stakeholders and
review the potential sale of assets.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Bankruptcy Court named 15 members Monday to the primary
creditors' committee in the WorldCom case. The committee, which will
help make critical decisions about restructuring proposals, is
dominated by holders of WorldCom bonds, but also includes
representatives from hedge funds, bond trustees, insurance companies
and creditors representing suppliers.</TE>
<TE>   Sidgmore told the group he will work with them "to put together a
plan that's totally believable and powerful."</TE>
<TE>   In a separate development, WorldCom said it has signed agreements
to transfer customers of its wireless business to rivals AT&amp;T
Wireless Services Inc., Verizon Wireless, Alltel Corp. and another
carrier that will be determined later.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom, which resells service from other carriers under its own
brand name, said in June that it would leave the business, which was
not profitable. The company struck the deals before its bankruptcy
filing, and said it will receive a small amount of money in the
transactions.</TE>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WellPoint Health Networks Inc., the biggest health insurer in
California, agreed to pay $9.25 million to settle allegations that
its Blue Cross of California unit cheated Medicare, the Justice
Department said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Federal officials said Blue Cross falsified information so the
government would believe the company performed more audits of
Medicare reports than it did.</LD>
<LD>   WellPoint, which was a Medicare contractor, audited reports that
health-care providers submitted to the Medicare program between 1990
and Nov. 30, 2000.</LD>
<TE>   The allegations were part of a whistle-blower lawsuit filed by
former Blue Cross auditor Vipul Vaid.</TE>
<TE>   "We cooperated fully with the government and decided to settle
this matter to avoid prolonged litigation regarding a business we no
longer operate," said Thomas Geiser, Blue Cross of California's
general counsel.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Thousand Oaks-based WellPoint fell 5 cents to $71.50 on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Williams Blames Quarterly Loss on Trading Decline</HD>
<DH>Earnings: Energy trader had warned last week that its
credit problems were squeezing its once-profitable business.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cash-strapped energy conglomerate Williams Cos. on Monday reported
the large quarterly loss it had warned of last week, and blamed it on
a devastating decline in its marketing and trading unit.</LD>
<LD>   Williams shares dropped to less than $1 last week as investors
feared the asset-rich company did not have enough money to avoid
bankruptcy. Williams warned it was facing the massive quarterly loss
on July 22.</LD>
<LD>   John Olson, an analyst with Houston investment bank Sanders Morris
Harris, said Williams is by no means out of the woods yet.</LD>
<TE>   "We got a difficult earnings report, about in line with
expectations, but everyone is waiting on pins and needles to see what
happens on Thursday morning," Olson said.</TE>
<TE>   That is when a $450-million bank debt is due--and that amount is
about all that Williams said it has in cash on hand. It is
negotiating a secured financing agreement for about $1.2 billion,
after failing last week to land an unsecured credit line of about $2
billion.</TE>
<TE>   The Tulsa, Okla.-based energy and pipeline firm reported a
second-quarter net loss of $349.1 million, or 68 cents a share,
compared with a profit of $339.5 million, or 69 cents a share, a year
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' stock closed up nearly 88%, gaining 93 cents at $1.99 on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' financial problems have caused a severe slowdown in its
trading business, and are partly to blame for an industrywide drop in
wholesale power and natural gas deals.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street analysts, expressing fears it might be forced into
bankruptcy, have used quarterly earnings conference calls as an
opportunity to grill other trading houses about their financial
exposure to Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Energy traders have been pulling back their positions with
Williams and Dynegy Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Williams said on Monday that it would delay its scheduled
conference call until later this week.</TE>
<TE>   Woes in the power trading business were evident in the results
from Williams' energy marketing and trading business, which reported
a second-quarter loss of $497.5 million compared with a profit of
$262.2 million for the same period last year.</TE>
<TE>   The company blamed the loss on a "significant decline" in the
value of controversial mark-to-market contracts and the need for
higher credit and liquidity reserves.</TE>
<TE>   Its energy services business fared slightly better. The division,
which includes its natural gas exploration and transportation
business as well as its refining and retail operations, posted a
profit of $131.8 million, compared with $263.9 million during the
same period last year.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' pipelines unit, a key backbone, posted a second-quarter
profit of $156.7 million against $181 million a year earlier. The
drop was attributed to retirement costs and construction fees on
projects that have since been abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding special items, the company posted a recurring loss in
the quarter of 34 cents a share. Analysts polled by Thomson First
Call expected the company to post a loss on average of 38 cents.</TE>

<HD>European Stocks Extend Rally</HD>
<DH>Investments: Surge is led by the insurance sector as buyers
take advantage of bargains.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>European stocks posted their biggest one-day percentage gain in at
least 15 years Monday as investors extended the rally that began late
last week and plowed money back into equities.</LD>
<LD>   "There's a feeling that maybe we're building a bottom," said David
Thwaites, a European equities strategist at BNP Paribas.</LD>
<LD>   The FTSE Eurotop 300 index rose 5.9%--beating its previous record
one-day percentage gain of 5.8% set in October 1987. That reflected
gains in markets across the Continent: The main German share index
soared 7.9% while France's CAC-40 index jumped 7.0% and the Italian
MIB-30 index rose 4.6%. In London, the FTSE-100 index jumped 4.6%.</LD>
<TE>   European markets, taking their lead from Wall Street, had plunged
sharply in recent weeks as accounting worries, profit concerns and
deteriorating investor sentiment combined to knock down stock prices.
But a feeling that stocks have been beaten down to bargain levels
began to take hold on both sides of the Atlantic last week, and
European markets were off and running Monday before the rally got
underway in New York.</TE>
<TE>   However, analysts said the news from Europe's corporate community
was still not completely positive. " ... there's not much confidence
about the outlook [for corporate earnings]," said Thwaites. Big oil
companies BP and Repsol, Italy's No.2 bank Sanpaolo IMI, and Europe's
biggest car maker Volkswagen are among the firms reporting today.</TE>
<TE>   Insurers dominated the blue chip leader board as the sector, which
has been battered by worries over its solvency, rode the market
bounce. Auto makers and media companies also were up strongly.
Volkswagen gained 9.6% and BMW rose 8.7%, while French advertising
group Havas surged 7.8%.</TE>

<HD>Junk Bond Default Rate Headed Higher</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News, Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The global junk bond default rate is likely to end the year at a
higher-than-forecast 8.8% after companies missed payments on a record
$42.6 billion of debt in the second quarter, Moody's Investors
Service said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Forty-two companies defaulted on their debts in the second
quarter, Moody's said. The rating company in April predicted the
default rate would end the year at 7.4%.</LD>
<LD>   In the first half, companies with $76 billion of bonds outstanding
failed to pay interest or declared bankruptcy, leaving the default
rate at 10.3%, Moody's said. The rate, which doesn't include this
month's record bankruptcy filed by WorldCom Inc., is expected to
decline in the next six months as the economy improves, increasing
companies' ability to pay their debts, Moody's said.</LD>
<TE>   Junk bonds have returned negative 9.1% this year, including
interest, and last week suffered their worst week in nearly 11
months, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. reported.</TE>
<TE>   Among the largest first-half defaults: cable operators NTL
Communications Inc., with $8.5 billion of bonds, and Adelphia
Communications Corp., with $6.9 billion; telecom operator Global
Crossing Ltd., with $3.8 billion; and retailer Kmart Corp., with $2.5
billion.</TE>

<LD>Even success stories like teen hit machine Britney Spears and
blockbuster writer John Grisham weren't enough to save Thomas
Middelhoff, the head of the conglomerate Bertelsmann, from being
fired Sunday. From Vivendi Universal's Jean-Marie Messier to Deutsche
Telekom's Ron Sommer to AOL Time Warner's Robert W. Pittman, global
boardrooms are deciding--to borrow the title of Grisham's first
novel--that it's A Time to Kill.</LD>
<LD>   European business titans like Messier and Middelhoff wanted to
emulate, even surpass, their aggressive American brethren, creating
big digital media empires that would ride the Internet wave to
prosperity and turn them into celebrities. But conservatism is the
new/old style as companies retrench.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the purging is as symbolic as it is practical. Consider
Messier. In France, he became cultural public enemy No. 1 when he
moved to New York and touted the American business model.</LD>
<TE>   Messier transformed a water utility company into a media titan
worth about $50 billion at its peak, with Universal Studios and USA
Networks among its holdings. No one could really figure out the value
of the empire constructed by Messier because it became impossible to
get an overview of his various acquisitions. But the $17.1 billion in
company debt that Messier accumulated during his buying spree loomed
ever larger.</TE>
<TE>   No sooner did the board of directors in Paris force Messier's
resignation than Sommer and Middelhoff came under scrutiny. After
Sommer initiated a deal to buy VoiceStream in 2000 and invested
heavily in online services, Deutsche Telekom stockholders saw
continuation of a share price plunge that had started earlier that
year. The German firm suffered losses of more than $3 billion in
2001.</TE>
<TE>   Middelhoff never put Bertelsmann into massive debt, but he
purchased Napster, a blunder that made his other questionable
Internet investments look good by comparison. Middelhoff also adopted
the United States as his home, calling himself "an American with a
German passport." He didn't even want Bertelsmann referred to as a
German company. But the family that has a controlling interest in
Bertelsmann rejected the idea of taking the company public and
possibly losing control.</TE>
<TE>   Though Americans have a higher tolerance for corporate
swashbucklers than Europeans, the fall of Pittmann certainly shows a
new desire to respect business fundamentals like making money.</TE>
<TE>   It's fair to wonder whether the backlash might end up going as
overboard as the grandiose pronouncements about new business models
did in the 1990s. Capitalism requires risk-taking and innovation. But
a breathing spell is certainly in order. Not every day at the stock
market is supposed to be a Grisham-like thriller.</TE>

<LD>The Central Asian republics that once were part of the Soviet Union
keep marching backward politically, jailing opposition leaders or
forcing them into exile, guarding against independent media that, no
matter how irritating they are to the powerful, are a bulwark of
democracy and a voice for those ruled.</LD>
<LD>   The latest blast of bad news came this month from Kazakhstan. The
government sentenced opposition leader Mukhtar Ablyazov to six years
in jail, claiming he abused his power and conducted "illegal
entrepreneurial activity" as energy minister from 1997 through 1999.
Don't believe it.</LD>
<LD>   Ablyazov's conduct as minister did not trouble Kazakhstan
President Nursultan A. Nazarbayev a bit until November. That's when
Ablyazov announced the formation of a new political movement calling
for greater democracy and business freedom.</LD>
<TE>   The ruling regime arrested Ablyazov in March, shortly before
jailing another leader of his Democratic Choice for Kazakhstan party,
Galymzhan Zhakiyanov, a former regional governor now facing similar
abuse-of-power charges.</TE>
<TE>   Nazarbayev is one of a number of autocratic rulers hoping to
leverage his support for the U.S. war against terrorism, so the U.S.
will turn a blind eye as the clamps on potential political opponents
are tightened. Kazakhstan recently signed an agreement allowing U.S.
military aircraft to land at the airport in Almaty, the capital, in
an emergency.</TE>
<TE>   In Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan's next-door neighbor, a Western diplomat
said U.S. envoys repeatedly had told President Islam Karimov that he
must loosen the reins of repression. Karimov, like Nazarbayev, was
perfectly happy running his fiefdom as part of the Soviet Union. When
the Communist nation collapsed a decade ago, both men kept their firm
grip on power. The United States is trying to foster a climate for
independent media in both Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, a difficult but
necessary task.</TE>
<TE>   In Almaty, the editor of a newspaper whose stories angered
Nazarbayev supporters was threatened and her offices were firebombed.
Rather than look for the real arsonists, police said they would
charge the paper's publisher with the crime. Last week, the company
that published the newspaper was ordered to close. The company's
lawyer called the ruling "a political decision."</TE>
<TE>   The last decade has seen encouraging increases in political
freedom in large areas of East Asia and Latin America. In Central
Asia, Afghanistan is trying to rebuild a shattered nation, erecting
new buildings and new democratic institutions.</TE>
<TE>   Such neighbors as Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan have far more natural
resources than Afghanistan, plus roads, schools and government
agencies for everything from agriculture to telecommunications. What
they need is political openness. The United States and its allies
should push the autocratic rulers in that direction.</TE>

<LD>It hasn't been easy restoring reason to California's primary election
mess. State Sen. Ross Johnson (R-Irvine) proposed in February moving
the first round of balloting for state and local offices from early
March to the first week in September. But county and state election
officials balked. They said a September primary did not leave them
enough time to prepare for the general election.</LD>
<LD>   They had a point. The counties must meet a number of legal
deadlines for distribution of the statewide ballot pamphlet and
sample local ballots, and for mailing out absentee ballots.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson changed his bill, SB 1975, to call for an early August
primary. If 25 other states can hold their primaries in August and
September, why not California? But the election officials dug in
their heels.</LD>
<TE>   Now Johnson has proposed moving the state primary to early June,
where it was for more than half a century. Secretary of State Bill
Jones says he can support that. But county registrars of voters
remain stubbornly opposed to separate state and local primary
elections in presidential years because of the cost, an estimated $40
million statewide.</TE>
<TE>   If money is the only remaining concern, then the state should be
willing to pick up some or all of the cost. State and federal
governments already are spending millions to help the counties buy
modern voting machines, a reaction to the Florida voting snafu.
Johnson still hopes to negotiate an August date. He should continue
that effort.</TE>
<TE>   The bill passed the Senate in May and won approval of the
Assembly's Elections Committee. It awaits a crucial hearing and vote
in the Appropriations Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Presidential politics caused this mess. With its traditional June
ballot, California became irrelevant to the nominating process as
other states voted earlier. The Legislature moved the primary to
March 26 in 1996, but other states skipped ahead. California moved
again, to the first week in March, in 2000. Once again, others
leapfrogged. In 2004, the primary season will start even earlier in
many states.</TE>
<TE>   The only way out is to separate the state and national primaries
in presidential years, holding a presidential primary at the whim of
the political parties and balloting for state and local offices in
June or later.</TE>
<TE>   This year, California's primary was the first in the nation, on
March 5. The turnout was a record low. Nearly five months later, the
general election is still--absurdly--more than three months away.
That's no way to treat a voter.</TE>

<LD>Re "State Budget Talks Going Nowhere, Slowly," July 28: If you or I
repeatedly failed to do our job, we'd be fired. If we knew that a
problem was likely to arise, we'd be expected to anticipate it and
deal with it so that our task would be completed on time. For well
over 20 years, passing a state budget has been a problem, but once
again the governor and state elected officials (Republican, Democrat
and other) have failed to learn from the past--and have thus failed
to get their job done.</LD>
<LD>   Let's fire as many of them as possible in November. They couldn't
handle energy contracts in 2001, they couldn't handle the Oracle
debacle and they can't handle the budget, again. Surely we can do
better. We can't do much worse.</LD>

the Middle East and terrorism in general--I have not felt as good as

to preserve it, jibe with bombing innocent people to avenge a
terrible wrong? Where does civilization begin in its creative efforts

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Bush Seeks to Limit Malpractice Suits," July 25: Jamie Court,
executive director of the California-based Foundation for Taxpayer
and Consumer Rights, is dead wrong in opposing President Bush in his
effort to cap exorbitant malpractice settlements. Court states, quite
dramatically, that Californians are paying with their lives for the
malpractice caps that were put in place years ago and that the
California health-care system is a "death trap."</LD>
<LD>   Did he notice that the Las Vegas trauma unit was closed recently?
Doctors are voting with their feet and leaving states like Nevada
that have allowed the attorneys to run wild for too long. It is the
people of Las Vegas who are paying with their lives today because
people like Court are holding up long-overdue changes in malpractice
regulations.</LD>
<LD>   The law of supply and demand is at work here, and the supply of
doctors is running out.</LD>
<TE>   Joe Fiore MD</TE>
<TE>   San Diego</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Times reported that Bush is proposing a nationwide standard to
ease the malpractice crisis currently at critical levels in 12
states, based upon the model of California's successful Medical
Injury Compensation Reform Act of the past 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   As a practicing obstetrician for more than 25 years, I have been a
part of that system here in California and have watched company after
company leave California and have seen my malpractice premiums
increase annually to the point where soon (if there is no reform ) it
will not be economically feasible to practice obstetrics in
California for myself and thousands of other OB/GYNs as well.</TE>
<TE>   Some colleagues are paying more than $100,000 per year. Court,
whom you quoted as saying such a move "will turn aspects of the
health-care system into an even bigger death trap," is, in my
opinion, out of touch with the reality of the situation. If
malpractice tort reform doesn't occur across the United States,
including improvements here in California, pregnant women, for
example, will have to travel perhaps many, many miles to find
obstetrical care, if any at all. Court needs to go no further than
the nearest practicing obstetrician to get a reality check on the
current crisis.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Jonathan Turley's July 26 commentary, "Betcha Can't Sue Just One,"
while tongue-in-cheek, is nevertheless a sad commentary. With
asbestos and tobacco legislation as backdrops, the looming fast-food
litigation shows that our legal system is mutating into a
lottery-ticket sham: buy a ticket/join a lawsuit and hope for a big
jackpot/award (most of which goes to the barker/lawyer).</LD>
<LD>   Juries of economic illiterates dutifully award these jackpots,
ignorant of who actually pays (after defendant firms pass along the
cost in higher prices)--we do. So class-action tort lawyers become a
quasi-governmental agency: They impose taxes on the public and use
the courts as their personal tax collectors, amassing CEO-level
wealth while most plaintiffs typically get pennies on the dollar. And
some actually call this a system of justice?</LD>

<LD>   Wonder why travel is down? Wonder why sales of many items are
down? Wonder why entertainment attendance is down? For many of us,
especially seniors, our so-called "discretionary" spending is tied up
in medical expenses. The costs of medical care, prescriptions and
insurance are skyrocketing as the quality of care goes down. It was
enjoyable to get in the traveling we did while we were able to afford
it, and for this we are very thankful. I am sorry for those who
cannot do so now.</LD>

<LD>James Pinkerton's Republican ideology has led him down the
well-trodden path that all conservatives must, and do, eventually
self-immolate on: that of denial and rationalization. However,
"Nobody Knows? Who Knew?" (Commentary, July 23) is fraught with the
now-revealed but, in actuality, always-there revelations that the big
boys of industry, finance and government know exactly what is going
on. After all, they knew just when to jettison their stock and obtain
the mountains of lucre that now cushion their fall from grace.</LD>

<LD>Re "We Want It Bigger, Better and With an Attitude," Commentary, July
25: I fully agree with Norah Vincent's statement that when
considering a replacement for the World Trade Center, size matters.
In the mid-1930s, Frank Lloyd Wright was proposing a mile-high
building in Chicago, a city where I have lived and practiced
architecture for most of my life. Although it was never built,
Chicago has never shied away from the skyscraper, its own invention.</LD>
<LD>   Today, New York is "America's City" and should think big. I would
propose a 150-story building, 1,750 feet high, about one-third of a
mile. Its long axis should run east and west and it should be clad in
mirror glass, with visually minimum divisions--one large mirror,
which would reflect the real hero of Sept. 11, New York City itself.</LD>

<TE>   Some questions for Vincent: If the World Trade Center towers were
rebuilt, who would lease space in them? Who would apply to work
there? What insurance company would insure them? Rebuilt towers would
be perceived as a challenge, and the challenge would be accepted.
Next time, the terrorists will smuggle in a suitcase nuke to bring
them down.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps after our government becomes serious about taking out
terrorists we can begin to think about what to build there. After
scores of terrorists die, brought down by unknown assassins. After
the nations that support terrorism no longer exist. After our borders
are secured. After the dozens of terrorist cells still operating in
this country are wiped out. After we stop issuing visas to citizens
of terror-supporting nations, and after we revoke the visas of all
citizens of those nations.</TE>

<HD>To Beat Davis, Simon Should Take On Immigration Issue</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just as Steve Lopez showed courage in writing about how the Catholic
Church leadership has betrayed millions of Catholics, he now is
showing formidable bravery in bringing up the issue of excessive
immigration into California, a very politically incorrect topic ("The
Immigration Bomb: Bill Simon, Are You Listening?" July 26). Having
left California in large part because of the smog, the population
explosion and the automotive nightmare, I can only applaud his good
sense in the face of California's insanity.</LD>
<LD>   When back in the once-Golden State recently I was appalled at how
much worse everything had gotten in just one year. There has to be
recognition that the state has become an ecological and demographic
catastrophe. That Bill Simon cannot, under these circumstances, be
elected against Gov. Gray Davis is evidence of the stupidity of the
Republican Party generally and of Simon in particular.</LD>
<LD>   Norman Ravitch</LD>
<TE>   Savannah, Ga.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lopez, as usual, is right on. The 200-pound gorilla in our living
room is illegal immigration, and politicians are terrified of taking
it on, lest they lose the Latino vote. What they don't seem to
realize is that Latino voters are just as concerned about overcrowded
schools, closed trauma centers, polluted beaches, housing shortages
and freeway traffic as anyone else. They are aware that these
problems are increased by overpopulation.</TE>
<TE>   If Proposition 187 had been enforced in accordance with the will
of the voters, these problems would have been greatly diminished. But
that's dead, thanks to our current governor's decision not to appeal
it to the Supreme Court on behalf of California voters. Instead, our
state Legislature has thrown out the welcome mat, offering illegals
benefits including in-state college tuition, while U.S. citizens from
other states have to pay the much higher out-of-state rate. Very few
politicians of either party have the courage to call this the
insanity it is. If Simon took on this issue, he could win.</TE>
<TE>   Cleo Sopp</TE>
<TE>   Whittier</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lopez feigns to offer up a wedge issue on a silver platter to the
failing Simon campaign. But what he is really doing is succumbing to
the litany of media sensationalism. Here's a news flash: California
is not overpopulated! In fact, the East Coast is far denser, given a
similar geographic area.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of relying on flawed logic, i.e., our housing shortage is
caused by a contemporary surge in immigration, Lopez should look
toward Proposition 13 and the tax revolt as the sources of his
frustration. Californians have unwittingly created an incentive for
cities and counties to favor commercial construction at the expense
of housing, with property taxes that go directly to Sacramento. A
decrease in services is the natural outcome when a citizenry wants a
high level of services without having to pay for them. What
California needs is a reassessment of how it chooses to structure its
finances.</TE>

<HD>Calif. Blue Cross Settles Medicare Fraud Suit for $9.25
Million</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Blue Cross of California and its parent company, Wellpoint Health
Networks Inc., have agreed to pay $9.25 million to resolve a
whistle-blower lawsuit accusing Blue Cross of defrauding the Medicare
system, the U.S.Justice Department said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The alleged abuses occurred during the 1990s while Blue Cross was
operating under contract with the federal government to process and
audit Medicare claims in the state.</LD>
<LD>   A former company auditor, joined by the Justice Department,
accused Blue Cross of lying about how much time it spent auditing
claims by hospitals and other medical providers.</LD>
<TE>   One of the criteria used by the government to evaluate Blue Cross'
performance was how well it served as a government watchdog, spotting
fraudulent claims.</TE>
<TE>   "This settlement demonstrates that the government will continue to
aggressively pursue health care fraud not only by providers, but also
by intermediaries or other contractors who submit false or fraudulent
information to Medicare," said Assistant Atty. Gen. Robert McCallum.</TE>
<TE>   In settling the lawsuit, Blue Cross admitted no wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   "The company has always had comprehensive guidelines for ethical
conduct and has consistently communicated to its associates and other
constituents a strong commitment to ethical behavior at all levels,"
Thomas Geiser, the company's general counsel, said.</TE>
<TE>   Geiser said Blue Cross sold off the unit that processed Medicare
claims in 2000, before the lawsuit was filed.</TE>
<TE>   "We cooperated fully with the government and decided to settle
this matter to avoid prolonged litigation regarding a business we no
longer operate," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The case was handled by the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles
and the U.S. Department of Justice.</TE>

<HD>C. James Carrico, 67; 1st Doctor to Treat Wounded President
Kennedy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dr. C. James Carrico, the first physician to tend President Kennedy
in a Dallas emergency room immediately after he was mortally wounded,
died of colon cancer Thursday at his home in Greenbank on Whidbey
Island, Washington. He was 67.</LD>
<LD>   The Pasadena-born Carrico, who was president-elect of the American
College of Surgeons at the time of his death, was a first-year
surgical resident on Nov. 22, 1963, when Kennedy was rushed into
Parkland Memorial Hospital.</LD>
<LD>   As the first doctor to see Kennedy, Carrico inserted a tube into
the barely breathing president's trachea. Carrico stayed at Kennedy's
side for 25 minutes until a colleague pronounced the president dead.</LD>
<TE>   When asked by the Warren Commission why Parkland's emergency
doctors did not further examine Kennedy after he died, Carrico
replied: "We felt that a complete examination would be carried
out--and no one had the heart, I believe, to examine him then."</TE>
<TE>   Although conspiracy theorists contend that Abraham Zapruder's home
movie of the assassination shows Kennedy jerked violently in two
directions, indicating that he was struck by bullets fired from two
directions, the Warren Commission concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald
was the lone assassin.</TE>
<TE>   Carrico believed that the Warren Commission findings were
accurate.</TE>
<TE>   "My bias is that the medical evidence in the Warren Commission
report indicates both bullets appear to have come from the same
place," he told Associated Press in 1975. "The fact that the
president moved in two different directions is not surprising.
Considering the impact of the missiles on his brain and nervous
system, trying to guess what happened from his movements is almost
impossible."</TE>
<TE>   Carrico revealed during his testimony that he had written a letter
to be read by his children when they were older describing how he
felt that day.</TE>
<TE>   It was, he told the commission, "just a little homespun
philosophy. I just said that there was a lot of extremism both in
Dallas and in the nation as a whole, and in an attitude of extremism,
a warped mind can flourish much better than in a more stable
atmosphere."</TE>
<TE>   Carrico moved to Seattle in 1974 and became chief of surgery at
Harborview Medical Center, a county teaching hospital he helped turn
into a Level 1 trauma center.</TE>
<TE>   In 1983, he became chairman of the University of Washington
Medical School's surgery department and stepped down seven years
later to accept a similar job at his alma mater, the University of
Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. He retired in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Carrico, who was the top graduate in the 1961 class of the
University of Texas Southwestern, was twice named distinguished
alumnus of the University of North Texas, from which he received a
bachelor's degree in chemistry. He also served as chairman of the
American Board of Surgery and was a former president of the American
Assn. for the Surgery of Trauma.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Sue; two daughters, Ellen Telaneus of
Denton, Texas, and Amy Molloy of Portland, Ore.; a son, Christopher
of Hampshire, England; two siblings, and six grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Wallace Carroll, 95; Persuasive Editor, Among Best of His
Era</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wallace Carroll, the longtime editor and publisher of the
Winston-Salem Journal and Sentinel, has died. He was 95.</LD>
<LD>   In failing health for several months, Carroll died Sunday at a
retirement community in Winston-Salem, N.C.</LD>
<LD>   Carroll, one of the most respected newspaper editors of his era,
was the author of an editorial credited with helping persuade
President Johnson to pursue peace negotiations in Vietnam.</LD>
<TE>   The editorial in early 1968 carried the headline "Vietnam--Quo
Vadis?" ("Vietnam--Where do we go?"). He wrote that while "there is
no short and easy road out of Vietnam ... we must now see that we
cannot allow Vietnam to become the be-all and end-all of our national
policies."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll sent a copy to his friend Dean Acheson, a former secretary
of state and close advisor to Johnson. Acheson took it to the White
House and watched Johnson read it, and said that Carroll's views also
reflected his own. The editorial also clearly reflected declining
public support for Johnson's policies.</TE>
<TE>   Within two weeks, Johnson announced that he would not seek
reelection and that he would seek peace with North Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   The Washington Post would later comment that Carroll's "eloquent
argument" changed Acheson's views and, subsequently, U.S. policy.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Milwaukee, Carroll began his journalism career with United
Press after he graduated from Marquette University.</TE>
<TE>   Sent to London by United Press in the late 1920s, he spent much of
the next decade covering the major events in Europe, the hunger
marches brought about by the worldwide depression, the rise of
fascism and the Spanish Civil War.</TE>
<TE>   He reported from London in the early days of the war and from the
Russian front in 1941.</TE>
<TE>   After the U.S. entered the war, Carroll returned to London to run
the U.S. Office of War Information and also was an advisor to Supreme
Allied Cmdr. Dwight D. Eisenhower on psychological warfare.</TE>
<TE>   In his memoir "Deadline," James Reston, longtime columnist and
Washington bureau chief of the New York Times who knew Carroll in
Europe, noted that the propaganda section had a significant role in
deceiving the Nazis into believing an invasion of Europe was imminent
while Eisenhower was actually preparing a landing in North Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll detailed his wartime activities in his book "Persuade or
Perish," published in 1948.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, he went to Winston-Salem as the executive editor of
the Journal and Sentinel.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Wicker, who worked for Carroll at Winston-Salem years before
he would become a leading reporter and columnist for the New York
Times, said Carroll had exacting standards.</TE>
<TE>   "I was working on the desk as a copy editor," Wicker recalled,
"and I wrote two headlines with grammatical errors and they appeared
on the same page. Carroll had pinned those headlines on the bulletin
board the next day with a note that read, 'These are the last
headlines of this kind that will appear in the Winston-Salem
Journal.' And they never did again."</TE>
<TE>   In 1955, Carroll left Winston-Salem to take a post as news editor
in the Washington bureau of the New York Times under Reston.</TE>
<TE>   In his memoir, Reston wrote that "Carroll could have edited
Lincoln's Gettysburg Address and improved it."</TE>
<TE>   Reston also noted that "Carroll ... had a way of getting his
reporters to write leads that combined the professional with the
personal. He and Allen Drury ... once combined on a lead paragraph
still remembered: 'Arthur Miller revealed to a congressional
committee today a past filled with Communist connections and a future
filled with Marilyn Monroe.' "</TE>
<TE>   Alvin Shuster, a former foreign editor and now the senior
consulting editor at the Los Angeles Times, worked as deputy editor
to Carroll in the New York Times' Washington bureau for several
years.</TE>
<TE>   "Wally was one of the best and nicest editors in the business,"
Shuster said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "He had intelligence, common sense, great contacts everywhere and
a wit that no one could match. It took all of his skills and humor to
manage a staff of immense talent and to stand between that staff and
an often demanding New York office."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll left the New York Times in 1963 to return to Winston-Salem
as publisher of the Journal and Sentinel.</TE>
<TE>   He oversaw the paper's steady growth and, on the editorial side,
used the paper as an instrument of change, advocating busing to
integrate schools in the mid-1960s.</TE>
<TE>   In 1971, the Journal and Sentinel was awarded the Pulitzer Prize
for Public Service for its coverage of environmental issues
associated with strip mining in North Carolina and Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll retired in 1973, but remained active as a writer and
lecturer at Wake Forest University.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll's wife, Margaret, died in 2001. He is survived by four
children, John S. Carroll, editor of the Los Angeles Times; Margaret
Carroll, Rosamond Carroll and Patricia Carroll; four grandchildren;
and two great-grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Services are scheduled for 11 a.m. Wednesday at Highland
Presbyterian Church in Winston-Salem.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll loved classical piano and, in lieu of flowers, the family
suggests that contributions be made to the Wallace Carroll Endowed
Scholarship in Piano, North Carolina School of the Arts, c/o Sarah M.
Turner, Director of Donor Communications, 1533 S. Main St.,
Winston-Salem, N.C. 27127-2188. Checks may be payable to the NCSA
Foundation Inc.</TE>

Representatives from 1977 to 1993 and who was known for his work on
tax, labor and trade matters, died Sunday at his home in Oberlin,
Ohio. He was 70 and had heart ailments.</LD>
<LD>   Pease was a newspaper executive and state legislator before
winning election to Congress in a district that included an area west
of Cleveland containing the cities of Lorain, Elyria and Oberlin.</LD>
<LD>   He served on the Budget and Ways and Means committees. He
sponsored legislation that gradually reduced itemized deductions on
those with incomes of more than $100,000; a modified version became
law.</LD>
<TE>   On trade issues, he was a major force behind legislation making
imports to the United States contingent on improved labor and wage
standards abroad.</TE>
<TE>   He did not seek reelection in 1992 for health reasons, and in 1993
President Clinton appointed him to the board of the National Railroad
Passenger Corp. He also taught political science part time at Oberlin
College.</TE>
<TE>   Pease was a native of Toledo and an Army veteran. He was a
journalism graduate of Ohio University, where he also received a
master's degree in government. He won a Fulbright scholarship to what
is now the University of Newcastle upon Tyne in Britain.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in the 1950s, he held positions at the weekly Oberlin
News-Tribune, including co-editor and publisher. He also served in
both houses of the Ohio Legislature.</TE>

<LD>Dozens of Los Angeles police officers armed with high-powered rifles
swarmed through the downtown offices of the Los Angeles Times on
Monday evening after a man ran into the newspaper's offices claiming
to be carrying a bomb and threatening to explode it.</LD>
<LD>   At 9:45 p.m., after negotiating with the man for more than an
hour, police arrested him without incident. There was no bomb or
weapon in the black book bag he carried, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Police received a call at 5:40 p.m. from the man, saying he was in
The Times' building and had an "explosive device," police said. The
man had entered the parking garage on 2nd Street and told a guard he
had a "trigger device" tucked inside a book bag, pLt. Horace Frank
said.</LD>
<TE>   Police would not identify the man, but said he was about 25 and
was neither a current nor former employee of The Times.</TE>
<TE>   All employees had been evacuated, and several city blocks were
sealed off around the building, across the street from City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   By 8:30 p.m., the Los Angeles Police Department had contacted its
criminal conspiracy unit and the FBI. Soon after, SWAT officers had
entered the building to negotiate with the man.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Butler, 46, who has worked as a security guard at The
Times for eight years, said he had just returned from a break when a
man walked into the garage and confronted him.</TE>
<TE>   " 'When I straighten my leg, it's gonna blow,' " Butler quoted the
man as saying.</TE>
<TE>   Butler said the man, who claimed that someone had stolen his idea
for an all-black show, told him, "You don't want to die."</TE>
<TE>   After reaching a hallway in The Times' building, the man crouched
and repeatedly warned security guards that he had a bomb.</TE>
<TE>   Times employees produced the newspaper from its Olympic plant a
few blocks away, and the company's facilities in the San Fernando
Valley and Orange County.</TE>

<HD>LAPD Says Evidence Destroyed</HD>
<DH>Crime: Authorities no longer have DNA samples in at least
1,100 sexual assault cases, a report says. Ignorance of updated law
is blamed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT and STEVE BERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Police Department accidentally destroyed biological
evidence in at least 1,100 sexual assault cases since 1995, police
officials acknowledged Monday.</LD>
<LD>   A representative for the department told the City Council's Public
Safety Committee that detectives ordered DNA evidence destroyed for
cases more than 6 years old because they were unaware the statute of
limitations for rape was lengthened in 2001 from six years to 10
years.</LD>
<LD>   "Clearly this is unacceptable," said Laura Johnson, of LAPD's
support services division. "We have started intense training with
detectives."</LD>
<TE>   The problem came to light in April, when the district attorney's
forensic science director complained that evidence in as many as
4,000 sexual assault cases in Los Angeles County may have been lost
or destroyed by law enforcement over the last six years.</TE>
<TE>   Although law enforcement officials disputed the report at the
time, City Council members ordered LAPD officials to look into the
matter and report back. On Monday, Johnson told city officials that
the LAPD is continuing to review cases to determine the exact number
of cases affected.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have a real good number on it," Johnson told the
committee.</TE>
<TE>   Council members said they were dismayed.</TE>
<TE>   "What essentially has happened here is the ability to use DNA
evidence to make at least 1,100 cases has been lost forever," said
Councilman Jack Weiss, a former federal prosecutor and member of the
Public Safety Committee. "Each of these cases represents a real
victim of a violent crime who, as things stand right now, is unknown
and has been forgotten by the criminal justice system."</TE>
<TE>   The new state statute permits prosecution of certain sex offense
cases within 10 years of the offense or within one year from when a
suspect is identified, whichever is longer. The extended statute of
limitations doesn't apply unless the DNA is analyzed within two years
of the offense.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Lisa Kahn, who heads the district attorney's
forensic unit, said that provision makes it imperative that police
analyze DNA evidence promptly.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to have the ability to do it within a week of the time of
the incident," Kahn said.</TE>
<TE>   In April, Kahn informed law enforcement officials that she
believed that the LAPD and the Sheriff's Department were no longer
storing evidence on as many as 3,000 to 4,000 unsolved sexual assault
cases. She said she based those numbers on state crime statistics and
the average clearance rate for sex offenses.</TE>
<TE>   She also said that in applying about two years ago for state funds
to perform DNA tests on cold cases, the LAPD and the Sheriff's
Department said that they had preserved evidence in 2,000 unsolved
slayings involving sexual offenses and rapes. Kahn said that agencies
should have had evidence for about 6,000 cases.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Zavalo, head of the sheriff's evidence unit, could not be
reached Monday. In April, he said evidence can be destroyed only with
approval from investigating officers.</TE>

<HD>Duress Rejected as Motive for Murder</HD>
<DH>Court: State justices rule that threat of death is not a
reason to kill someone else. Gang prosecutors applaud the decision.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a decision applauded by gang prosecutors, the state Supreme Court
ruled Monday that fear for one's life does not justify killing an
innocent person.</LD>
<LD>   " 'The person threatened with his own demise ought rather to die
himself, than escape by the murder of an innocent,' " the high court
ruled, quoting 19th century common law commentator William
Blackstone.</LD>
<LD>   The justices' ruling rejects a duress rule adopted by New York,
Texas and other states, as well as by most European countries.</LD>
<TE>   Monday's ruling stems from the 1994 murder of Margaret Armstrong
in a camp near Eureka. In May 1999, Robert Neal Anderson was found
guilty in her slaying. He appealed, contending that he was forced to
help commit the crime by his co-defendant, Ron Kiern, who threatened
his life.</TE>
<TE>   "It confirms what we have always believed had been the law in
California," said Moona Nandi, the deputy attorney general who
represented the state in the appeal.</TE>
<TE>   The opinion, with one justice dissenting, states that a person
should choose to resist rather than kill, and seek an alternative to
murder.</TE>
<TE>   That point is especially important because it will stop gang
members and terrorists from escaping criminal liability when claiming
coercion led to murder, Nandi said.</TE>
<TE>   "If duress is recognized as a defense to the killing of innocents,
then a street or prison gang need only create an internal reign of
terror and murder can be justified," according to the opinion.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Pugsley, professor of criminal law at Southwestern
University School of Law, agreed that the decision is not a departure
from existing law, but may have unfortunate ramifications.</TE>
<TE>   "It puts the person who's claiming duress in a tragic situation,
especially if the threatener carries out on his threat," Pugsley
said. "It's a difficult situation, but I don't see how the law could
concede on that point."</TE>
<TE>   The opinion was written by state Supreme Court Justice Ming W.
Chin. The dissenter was Justice Joyce Kennard, who held that the
duress should be a potential defense in noncapital murder. Kennard
said Anderson had failed to prove his life was in danger.</TE>

<HD>Judge OKs Synagogue Construction</HD>
<DH>Court: Ruling allows work to resume in Hancock Park. City
had issued a cease-and desist order.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURA LOH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge ruled Monday that construction may resume on a
synagogue in Hancock Park, dealing the city a setback in a
long-running legal battle that has pitted Los Angeles' zoning powers
against an Orthodox Jewish congregation's religious rights.</LD>
<LD>   City officials issued a cease-and-desist order last month after
neighbors complained about Rabbi Chaim Rubin's plans to replace a
3,700-square-foot property housing Congregation Etz Chaim at 3rd
Street and Highland Avenue with a structure more than twice its size.
Most of the house had been demolished when the work was ordered
stopped.</LD>
<LD>   Neighborhood homeowners, some of whom have opposed the
congregation's activities for decades, said the work appeared to
violate a 2001 federal court settlement between the congregation and
the city to maintain the property as a residence in exchange for
permission to conduct limited religious services in a residential
zone.</LD>
<TE>   In response, the congregation asked U.S. District Judge Harry L.
Hupp, who has presided over the group's lawsuit against the city, to
lift the stop-work order, arguing that it had abided by a city-issued
permit to renovate and enlarge the house.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Azad, a lawyer for Congregation Etz Chaim, told the judge
Monday that the city has been bending to the political will of the
Hancock Park Homeowners' Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy City Atty. Tayo Popoola denied that charge, saying the city
is only trying to protect its interests and uphold zoning laws.</TE>
<TE>   "We go by the law and the facts," Popoola said in an interview
after Monday's court hearing. "As far as our office is concerned,
political considerations are not involved.</TE>
<TE>   "If the city were responding to pressure from the homeowners'
association, we wouldn't have signed the [2001 federal] settlement
agreement in the first place," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Popoola argued in court that the congregation had tried to
circumvent the agreement by keeping the city attorney's office in the
dark so that it could build what amounts to a "mansion" that would
attract "gawkers and would-be worshippers."</TE>
<TE>   The plans were submitted to the city Department of Building and
Safety, which issued a permit for the work.</TE>
<TE>   The judge said Monday the congregation was not obligated to give
separate notice to the city attorney's office. It would have been up
to building and safety officials to consult with city counsel if
there was a question about whether the plans were in violation of the
settlement, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, you will have a larger building than you thought you would,"
Hupp said to Popoola, "but it's a building that you approved."</TE>

<HD>Good News, Bad News as the Sequoia Blaze Continues</HD>
<DH>Disaster: Officials say they are unable to assess situation
in one remote area of the forest. But there's no threat to historic
giant groves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A blaze in Sequoia National Forest continued to burn Monday, running
up a rugged canyon east of the Kern River so remote firefighters
could not even get in to assess the situation.</LD>
<LD>   "It's running and torching and crowning up through that basin,"
said Jim Paxon, spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service. "It's dense
timber and brush. It's steep ground. Fire is going to get big in that
area .... We can't even give you an estimate."</LD>
<LD>   The good news, however, is that the fire, which has covered at
least 73,000 acres, has moved away from the giant Sequoia groves,
pushing north and east from the stately trees.</LD>
<TE>   The fire's western front, the side closest to the ancient groves,
is contained.</TE>
<TE>   Further north, firefighters battling a blaze near the Oregon
border wore black mourning bands on their badges in memory of three
firefighters who were killed Sunday when their truck pitched off a
steep mountain road and rolled down 800 feet.</TE>
<TE>   Those three were among 19 firefighters who have died this year, 18
battling blazes in one of the West's worst fire seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Seven firefighters have died in California alone. In addition to
the three killed Sunday, a firefighter died of a heart attack in
Riverside and three were killed when their plane crashed near Walker,
Calif.</TE>
<TE>   Those killed Sunday were identified as Heather DePaolo, 29, of
Redding; John Self, 19, of Susanville; and Steven Oustad of Westwood,
51. A memorial service was held Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   One of the injured, Alex Glover, 19, of Susanville, was released
from the hospital Monday. The other injured firefighter, Ryan Smith,
20, remained hospitalized in satisfactory condition, officials said.
Forest service officials and the California Highway Patrol were
investigating the accident.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, officials said the 1,650-acre Stanza fire was 20%
contained Monday. More than 500 firefighters battled that blaze,
which began after a lightning strike July 22.</TE>
<TE>   On the lines of the McNalley fire in the Sequoia National Forest,
five firefighters have been injured since Friday.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, one firefighter broke his ankle and another was
airlifted to Bakersfield after suffering heart problems. On Sunday a
firefighter received a concussion in a fall. Countless others have
been struck with heat exhaustion and dehydration.</TE>
<TE>   More than 2,200 people are battling the Sequoia blaze, which
officials say was started July 21 when a Bakersfield woman, Peri
VanBrunt, let her campfire burn out of control.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said they had no estimate for when the fire would be
contained.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of the community of Ponderosa were allowed back into
their homes Monday, although another town was still closed to all but
fire traffic.</TE>
<TE>   "We're back to the basics of firefighting," said Paxon, the Forest
Service spokesman. "It's a very, very slow, methodical, tedious
process."</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in California, a 1,000-acre fire burned near the
mountain town of Julian in eastern San Diego County.</TE>
<TE>   The fire was moving toward Banner Queen and Scissors Crossing,
small communities that were being protected by firefighters.</TE>

<HD>Indians' Casino Control Upheld</HD>
<DH>Court: Judge rejects challenge to state's refusal to allow
slot machines that are not on tribal land.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Boosting the already expanding Indian casino industry, a federal
judge on Monday upheld a California ballot measure that granted
tribes a monopoly on slot machines and other Nevada-style games of
chance. U.S. District Judge David F. Levi of Sacramento rejected a
lawsuit by four Bay Area card rooms challenging the state's right to
allow highly profitable slot machines and other Nevada-style casino
games on Indian reservations, while denying them to card rooms not on
tribal land.</LD>
<LD>   By rejecting the one legal challenge to Indian casino gambling in
the state, Levi's decision solidifies the tribes' position and could
help accelerate the expansion of their operations. California's
tribal casinos don't reveal their gross income from gambling, but
outside experts say it could be $4 billion a year, a sum that
approaches the take on the Las Vegas Strip or in Atlantic City.</LD>
<LD>   Levi acted on a lawsuit filed by four Bay Area card rooms led by
Artichoke Joe's in San Bruno. The card rooms sued Gov. Gray Davis,
who negotiated the compacts permitting gambling on reservations, and
the U.S. Department of Interior, which signed off on the agreements.</LD>
<TE>   After the Legislature approved the compacts, voters ratified them
in the form of Proposition 1A in March 2000. Approved by more than
64% of voters, the measure amended the California constitutional
prohibition against "Nevada-style" casinos, granting Indians a
monopoly. The tribes, which have become the state's top campaign
donors in recent years, spent $24 million to ensure passage of the
ballot measure, which had limited political opposition.</TE>
<TE>   "The grant of an economic monopoly to any group presents serious
questions that should cause careful consideration and hesitation,"
Levi wrote in the 97-page opinion. "Important questions" related to
gambling can be debated, the judge added. But, he concluded: "Where
the political branches and the people of California have adopted a
policy that does not violate either federal law or the U.S.
Constitution, that policy is entitled to prevail."</TE>
<TE>   Levi rejected the card clubs' argument that the compacts violated
the constitutional guarantee of equal protection by granting rights
to Indians that are denied to non-Indians. The judge also held that
the state complied with the federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of
1988, and rejected the card clubs' claim that the federal act says
Indians could operate only those games permitted elsewhere in the
state.</TE>
<TE>   Tribal representatives hailed the ruling; attorneys for the card
rooms vowed to appeal to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.</TE>
<TE>   "If tribes can have a monopoly on casino gaming, why not a
monopoly on car dealerships or gas stations?" asked Bo Links, one of
the card rooms' lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   Davis called the ruling "a victory for California voters who
overwhelmingly passed Proposition 1A," adding that the decision
"protects" more than 200,000 jobs in the casino industry.</TE>
<TE>   "We're thrilled that the judge upheld the overwhelming will of the
electorate," said Mark Macarro, chairman of the Pechanga Band of
Luiseno Mission Indians. Macarro was the main television spokesman
for Proposition 1-A and Proposition 5, a 1998 initiative pushed by
the tribes that was struck down by the state Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Macarro said Monday's ruling provides the tribes with legal and
economic stability, making it easier for them to attract investment
capital which in turn could help them finance casino expansions and
public works improvements.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the frustrating things for the tribes has been an
inability to plan and know where they stand," added Jerome Levine, an
attorney representing the tribes in the case. "It has impaired their
ability to get financing."</TE>
<TE>   Major Southern California card rooms and race tracks did not join
the suit. They are seeking legislative solutions to what they see as
their declining market share as Indian casinos expand in the Palm
Springs area and in more rural parts of San Diego County.</TE>
<TE>   The Bay Area card rooms felt more threatened. Although the card
rooms did not name any tribes in their suit, the action was prompted
in part by a effort by the Lytton Band of Pomo Indians to buy a card
club in the East Bay city of San Pablo, and turn it into a full
casino. The Lyttons are a landless group of roughly 45 members, whose
rancheria had been located in Sonoma County, north of San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   In order to proceed with its casino development, the tribe must
negotiate with Davis. The governor put talks on hold pending the
outcome of the lawsuit. Levi did not rule directly on the legality of
the Lytton band's plan. But Tony Cohen, attorney for the Lytton band,
said the judge's ruling opens the way for the tribe to press Davis to
negotiate.</TE>
<TE>   Tribes and other backers of ballot measures approved by voters in
1998 and 2000 had contended that gambling would remain in rural areas
where most reservations are located, and discounted opponents' claims
that in time, casinos would open in urban areas.</TE>
<TE>   The band's attempt to move into an urban area may be a first, but
may not be the last. Other small groups of Native Americans, many in
urban counties, are petitioning the federal government seeking to
reconstitute themselves as tribes.</TE>
<TE>   Davis and his aides negotiated the compacts in a series of
marathon, contentious and closed sessions held in his office and at a
hotel across from the Capitol in September 1999. At the time, Davis
said it would allow for a "modest" expansion of gambling that would
permit Indians to operate 45,000 slot machines. The nonpartisan
Legislative Analyst's Office concluded that that the hastily drawn
compact could permit 113,000 slot machines--more than any state other
than Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   Since March 2000 when voters approved Proposition 1-A, operators
have more than doubled the size of their casinos. At least seven
tribes operate casinos with 2,000 highly profitable slot machines,
the maximum number allowed to any one tribe under the compacts.
Altogether, 46 tribes operated 40,883 slot machines as of the state
Department of Justice's most recent check in November. That's more
than twice the 19,137 in use after voters approved Proposition 1-A.</TE>
<TE>   Slot machines are by far the houses' biggest source of revenue.
With each machine bringing in between $100 and $300 a day,
California's tribal casinos are making between $1.5 billion and $4.4
billion a year off their slot machines alone. By comparison, the Las
Vegas Strip's take is $4.5 billion a year, and Atlantic City's is
$4.2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "This year will be the year that California gambling will be
bigger than the Las Vegas Strip," said professor I. Nelson Rose, of
Whittier Law School in Costa Mesa and a gambling expert. "It will
still be a few years before California passes all of Nevada."</TE>
<TE>   Rose predicted that if Levi's decision is affirmed on appeal, the
ruling could have an impact on other states such as Arizona and
Connecticut where tribes have broader rights to operate gambling than
do non-Indians. "It is a clean win for the tribes in California,"
Rose said.</TE>

<HD>Arson Murders Resulted From Hotel Rivalries, Officials Say</HD>
<DH>Crime: Three men are charged in May 4 deaths of a Hollywood
Hills family, found in blaze.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A business rivalry over control of an alley separating neighboring
hotels in Studio City was the motive for a quadruple homicide,
authorities alleged Monday as three men were charged with capital
murder.</LD>
<LD>   Pravin Govin, 33, the owner of the Studio Place Inn, his brother
Victor Govin, 35, and Carlos Amador, 25, each were charged with four
counts of murder for setting a blaze at a Hollywood Hills home on May
4 that killed the family of a business rival. Each is charged with
murder for financial gain, arson murder, murder during a robbery and
multiple murder.</LD>
<LD>   They also were charged with one count each of first-degree
robbery, first-degree burglary, arson and use of a handgun to commit
the crimes.</LD>
<TE>   An attorney for the victims has said $3,000 to $4,000 in hotel
cash receipts were missing from the home.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said they will decide later whether to seek the death
penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Found in what was left of the Lakeridge Drive home were the
charred remains of Gita Kumar, 42, who with her husband owned the
Universal City Inn next-door to Govin's hotel; her son, Paras, 18;
her daughter, Tulsi, 16; and her mother-in-law, Sitaben Patel, 63.
Interim Los Angeles Police Chief Martin Pomeroy said Monday that an
"ongoing dispute between the Govins and the Kumars," whose
neighboring hotels are in the 10700 block of Ventura Boulevard, was
the apparent motive for the slayings.</TE>
<TE>   Tests still are being conducted to determine the cause of death,
LAPD Robbery-Homicide Capt. Jim Tatreau said.</TE>
<TE>   "The nature of the dispute that we know of, and we're not saying
that is the entire motive for this crime, [involves] some land that
the two hotels apparently shared," Tatreau said.</TE>
<TE>   Tatreau said the men were involved in setting the fire, which was
discovered by Gita Kumar's husband, Harish "Harry" Kumar, about 11:15
p.m. after he drove the short distance from the Universal City Inn.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said a battle evolved over an alley shared by the
facilities. Plans by both men to expand may also have played a role
in the dispute, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Six days after the blaze, the city Planning Commission was to hear
Kumar's plan to level his 40-room hotel for a 65-room, three-story
structure.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Szabo, a press deputy for Los Angeles City Councilwoman Wendy
Greuel, said her staff was interviewed by police detectives about the
zoning and land-use issues surrounding the two hotels and the request
to expand the University City Inn. Detectives told them not to
discuss it publicly, Szabo said.</TE>
<TE>   Govind Patel, a relative of Kumar, said Gita Kumar and the Govins
had argued over the alley and land that divided their properties. The
family businesses were in competition to join a major chain, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was more than the land," Patel said. "It looks like
jealousy. Gita and Harish were doing much better" with their
business, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Patel said both Indian-immigrant families had socialized at events
involving the local Indian community.</TE>
<TE>   The Govins "came to [the] funeral," he said. "It's a shock to
everyone."</TE>
<TE>   Harish Kumar, 47, told investigators he returned from a trip to
Bakersfield to find his house in flames. Unable to enter the
smoke-filled home to reach his wife of 20 years, his mother and
children, he called 911. Firefighters arrived three minutes later and
found him screaming on the front lawn. Investigators found the bodies
in one room.</TE>
<TE>   "It was apparent that it was a homicide," Tatreau said.</TE>
<TE>   "That made it particularly disturbing," he continued, "in that it
wasn't an accidental house fire, which is tragic enough, but that
this was an intentional act."</TE>
<TE>   Pravin Govin was convicted of burglary in 1992 and in 1995 of
assault with a firearm.</TE>

<HD>MTA Survey Finds Most Riders Happy</HD>
<DH>Transportation: Rail passengers rate their service higher
than those who travel by bus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most riders are satisfied with their bus service, but rail passengers
seem even happier, MTA officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   A survey of 43,000 weekday passengers conducted from June to
December 2001 by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority found that
56% ranked their travel on buses as "good" or "very good," compared
to 78% who gave subways or light rail the same high ratings. Overall,
69% of those polled believed that bus service was improving.</LD>
<LD>   The survey, the first since 1996 and the largest ever conducted by
the MTA, also found that Latinos use public transportation more than
any other ethnic group, constituting 58% of bus riders and 41% of
rail passengers.</LD>
<TE>   Bus riders also tended to be female, poorer and less educated than
rail passengers, the survey showed. The median family income for bus
riders is $13,000, compared to $22,000 for rail riders. Nearly
one-quarter of rail riders reported an annual family income of more
than $50,000, while one-third of bus riders had household incomes of
less than $7,500 a year. Results of the survey will be used for the
MTA's long-range planning and service scheduling, said Jesse Simon,
planning manager for the transit agency.</TE>
<TE>   Rider advocates say service is getting better, but much more work
remains.</TE>
<TE>   "People seem happier now," said Bart Reed, executive director of
the Transit Coalition, a group based in Sylmar. He added that since
the MTA began replacing its old diesel fleet with new,
natural-gas-powered coaches, bus travel has become more pleasant.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Mann, past co-chairman of the Bus Riders Union and current
member of the group's planning committee, said too many buses are
still overcrowded and running behind schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been some improvement, but it's not good enough," Mann
said. "I'm still late for work, I still can't get a seat."</TE>
<TE>   To conduct the survey, MTA employees hopped onto buses and trains
selected in random clusters throughout Los Angeles County. They
handed every passenger a one-page questionnaire with a Spanish
version on the reverse side.</TE>
<TE>   Of the roughly 320,000 questionnaires distributed on weekdays, the
MTA received 31,000 responses from bus riders and 12,000 from rail
passengers. The margin of error, Simon said, is plus or minus 1%. A
follow-up telephone survey of 2,500 bus and 1,000 rail passengers was
also conducted.</TE>
<TE>   MTA bus drivers were rated as "good" or "very good" for their
knowledge of routes by 81% of passengers. Fewer riders--58%--gave the
drivers the same rankings for courteousness.</TE>
<TE>   The greatest sources of rider unhappiness stemmed from service
frequency and punctuality. About one-quarter of riders thought that
frequency and punctuality were "poor" or "very poor" and one-third
rated them as "fair."</TE>
<TE>   Virtually across the board, respondents were more satisfied with
rail than bus service. A greater percentage of riders found rail to
be clean, on-time and less crowded.</TE>
<TE>   The survey also found that the typical rider walked to bus or
train stops and rode transit for about an hour. Two-thirds of riders
transferred to another bus or train, and more than 70% rode five or
more days per week. Bus riders are also more transit-dependent, with
about 75% saying they don't have access to a car, while 50% of rail
riders do.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, the MTA asked riders similar questions but many of those
responses cannot be compared because of differences in wording, Simon
said.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the 1996 survey showed 65% of riders believed bus
service is "good" or "very good." But respondents could choose only
from four categories that also included "fair" and "poor.</TE>
<TE>   This year's riders were given a fifth category--"very poor"--to
consider.</TE>

<HD>Success Rate in INS Cases Declines</HD>
<DH>Report: A drop in convictions won by federal prosecutors in
Southern California counters national trend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHELLE MUNN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Southern California's success rate for prosecuting people charged
with immigration violations has declined significantly in the last
four years, according to a research organization.</LD>
<LD>   About 77% of the immigration cases brought in Southern California
federal court last year resulted in convictions, down from 89% in
1997, the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse
University said in a report released Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Nationally, the trend was toward more successful prosecutions.
About 87% of such cases across the country ended in convictions last
year, up from 77% nationally four years earlier.</LD>
<TE>   Among the 94 immigration districts in the United States, the
Southern California district--a narrow swath extending along the
Mexican border--ranked 80th last year in the percentage of successful
prosecutions.</TE>
<TE>   That put the Southern California district slightly behind the
Central California district, which includes Los Angeles and Orange
County. The Central California district was ranked 77th, with a
conviction rate of 79%.</TE>
<TE>   Cases are prosecuted when the Immigration and Naturalization
Service refers them to the U.S. attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California last year, the U.S. attorney's office
prosecuted 99.7% of the cases referred by the INS, compared with 93%
nationally, the Syracuse University group reported.</TE>
<TE>   The report comes at a time when the INS, a controversial agency
for years, has come in for an unusual amount of criticism.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has proposed moving the agency into the Department
of Homeland Security, which his administration is seeking to create.</TE>
<TE>   The House voted to move only the INS's law enforcement functions
and to leave its offices in charge of immigration services in the
Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate has not acted on the bill.</TE>
<TE>   "Some say INS stands for 'Ignoring National Security,' " Rep. F.
James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.), chairman of the House Judiciary
subcommittee on immigration, said when the House first proposed
splitting the INS into two pieces last April. "It's hard to argue
with that."</TE>
<TE>   Russell Bergeron, an INS spokesman in Washington, said the
changing nature of immigration cases in Southern California has
accounted for at least some of the decline in the rate of successful
prosecutions there.</TE>
<TE>   Cases for smuggling illegal aliens and possessing counterfeit
immigration documents take longer to build and are more likely to
fail, Bergeron said.</TE>
<TE>   The Southern California U.S. attorney's office declined comment.</TE>
<TE>   Pete Nunez, a former San Diego district attorney and President
Reagan's immigration czar, was surprised that the Syracuse University
report showed such a low success rate for Southern California
immigration prosecutions.</TE>
<TE>   "A U.S. attorney isn't going to accept a case for prosecution
unless they think they can win it," Nunez said.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually the conviction rate in any attorney's office is 99%."</TE>

<LD>A jury was seated Monday in the Compton Superior Court trial of a
46-year-old woman who is HIV-positive and accused of engaging in
prostitution.</LD>
<LD>   Panchita Hall was charged under a 1988 state law that requires
convicted prostitutes who have been informed that they are
HIV-positive to be charged with a felony upon their next arrest.</LD>
<LD>   Hall has six convictions for prostitution since a court-ordered
test in 1995 found she had HIV, records show.</LD>
<TE>   Opening statements begin today. A felony conviction carries a
three-year sentence, but a prosecutor plans to ask for an enhanced
sentence of as much as nine years. Hall's trial is expected to last
three days.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 21-year-old Mission Viejo woman accused of planting razor blades
and other sharp objects at playgrounds in south Orange County pleaded
not guilty Monday to the 18 counts filed against her.</LD>
<LD>   Appearing in a blue jail jumpsuit with her hair tied back in a
ponytail, Lori Elizabeth Fischer looked down throughout the hearing
at South Justice Center in Laguna Niguel, where she has been charged
with multiple counts of assault with a deadly weapon and attempted
child abuse.</LD>
<LD>   Fischer has undergone psychological testing, but her attorney has
not said whether mental issues will be a part of her defense.</LD>
<TE>   Fischer allegedly buried nearly 200 nails and razor blades at
parks in Foothill Ranch, Laguna Beach, Laguna Niguel and Mission
Viejo from April until June, when she was arrested. The incidents
prompted deputies, assisted by metal detectors, to do overnight
surveillance and parents to complete their own inspections of
playgrounds before allowing children on slides and swings.</TE>
<TE>   Fischer was arrested at Vista del Lago Park in Mission Viejo after
police watched her leave seven minutes after she entered the park.
Police, who had combed the park two hours earlier, found nails there
after she left.</TE>
<TE>   Police reportedly found a diary that appeared to have chronicled
her alleged crimes. In a jailhouse interview with The Times, Fischer
described herself as an outcast and said she found solace in her
walks at parks at night.</TE>
<TE>   Fischer, who is being held in lieu of $500,000 bail, faces up to
12 years in prison if she is convicted. A pretrial hearing is
scheduled for Sept. 9.</TE>

<HD>Smog-Credit Trader Under Investigation</HD>
<DH>Environment: AQMD launches probe of key middleman, but
officials insist there has been no adverse effect on the Southland's
air quality.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY POLAKOVIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles region's beleaguered smog-credit trading program is
under a legal cloud as investigators probe a Pasadena broker that
several businesses say cheated them during transactions intended to
clean the air.</LD>
<LD>   The South Coast Air Quality Management District, which manages the
program, has launched an investigation, although district officials
insist there has been no adverse effect on air quality.</LD>
<LD>   The regional office of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,
which regards the credit-trading program as a potential model for
pollution reduction efforts nationwide, is also looking into the
matter.</LD>
<TE>   The complaints about the program stem from a market-driven
pollution cleanup program set up nine years ago that placed 300 of
Southern California's major polluters into an emissions
credit-swapping bloc.</TE>
<TE>   Now, some participants in the program contend in lawsuits that a
key middleman in the program defrauded them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of like disbelief," said attorney Malcolm C. Weiss of
Los Angeles, who represents Aera Energy LLC, which says it lost
credits valued at more than $4 million in today's market. "We
entrusted our property to somebody who was supposed to assist the
company and apparently has misplaced it or is unwilling to account
for the property."</TE>
<TE>   Commenting on the EPA's investigation, Jack Broadbent,
administrator for air programs in California, said the agency "is
clearly concerned about this. There's enough of these [allegations]
that it's causing us concern, and we're going to look at this."</TE>
<TE>   Broadbent added, "We need to decide if the integrity of the
program was affected or if there are any air quality implications."</TE>
<TE>   At stake are millions of dollars in pollution credits, which can
be bought and sold in the Regional Clean Air Incentives Market, or
RECLAIM. Companies count the credits as assets, and their circulation
is crucial to business expansion.</TE>
<TE>   Air quality officials say the program helps stimulate
technological innovations and low-cost smog reductions in the most
polluted region of the country.</TE>
<TE>   The availability of the credits allows companies that buy them to
avoid more costly pollution reduction measures. The credits are sold
by firms that have cut their emissions below what is required by law.</TE>
<TE>   The program has been slow to deliver emission reductions, and last
summer was sideswiped by the state's power crisis, which pushed the
price of credits beyond the reach of many participating companies.</TE>
<TE>   At the center of the current controversy is Anne Sholtz, a former
Caltech economist and an architect of the RECLAIM program who
established an Internet-based auction house where buyers and sellers
can swap pollution credits.</TE>
<TE>   Sholtz is president of Automated Credit Exchange, which handled
about 8% of the pollution-credit exchanges in RECLAIM last year,
according to AQMD records.</TE>
<TE>   The exact amount of money in dispute is not clear because the
value of the credits fluctuates on the open market. So far this year,
a nitrogen oxide pollution credit in Los Angeles trades for an
average of $3 per pound, according to the AQMD.</TE>
<TE>   Three businesses that enlisted Sholtz or her company to conduct
pollution-credit swaps during the past year charged that they lost
millions of dollars in credits. Their allegations are contained in
lawsuits filed in Los Angeles and the Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview from her Pasadena office, Sholtz said the disputes
arose from "a few accounting problems" that have since been corrected
with new safeguards. She said she and her company have been honest
brokers in the pollution-credit trading market.</TE>
<TE>   "There are allegations that are completely false, and there are
things people don't understand about what was going on, and we showed
them what was going on. It's not as deep or involved as you might
think. There's a lot of stuff floating around out there that's
absolutely false," Sholtz said.</TE>
<TE>   In one case, InterGen Energy Inc., a Massachusetts-based power
producer, says it paid Automated Credit Exchange $4 million to
purchase 237 pounds of emissions credits for a power plant proposed
near Palm Springs. But the company alleges that Sholtz's firm did not
deliver the credits and broke an agreement to refund all of the
money. InterGen filed a lawsuit in October, and in April a U.S.
District Court judge in Riverside issued a $4.3-million judgment on
behalf of the power company.</TE>
<TE>   Competitor's Allegations</TE>
<TE>   In court records, attorney Howard Madris of Los Angeles,
representing Automated Credit Exchange's parent company, maintains
that InterGen was seeking to put Automated Credit Exchange out of
business to benefit a competitor, Coral Energy. Coral, like InterGen,
is affiliated with Shell Oil Co., and trades energy credits, making
it a "direct competitor" with the exchange, the court documents show.</TE>
<TE>   In another case, San Jose-based Calpine Corp. announced last week
that it was restating its earnings for 2001 after it learned that
"emissions reduction credits it purchased in 2001 were not
available."</TE>
<TE>   The company said its earnings were reduced by $11.5 million, or 3
cents per share. Officials at Calpine said they sued the Automated
Credit Exchange in March, alleging negligence and breach of contract,
but settled the case for an undisclosed amount.</TE>
<TE>   The Automated Credit Exchange's parent company, Delaware-based
EonXchange, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in May.
According to court documents, EonXchange replaced Sholtz &amp;
Associates, which was doing business as Automated Credit Exchange.
Records indicate that EonXchange is run by three members, including
Sholtz and her mother.</TE>
<TE>   The AQMD issued Sholtz a notice of violation in May 2000, alleging
that the Automated Credit Exchange "knowingly made" a "false
statement" to air-quality officials regarding the purchase price of
106,050 emissions credits for Chevron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Wyman, one of Sholtz's attorneys, said the dispute is a
misunderstanding over dates when credits transferred. He said in an
October 2000 letter that the "allegation is false" and the mistake
was "completely inadvertent."</TE>
<TE>   But the AQMD disagreed and levied a $1,000 fine against Sholtz.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Wallerstein, executive officer for the AQMD, said alleged
problems at the Automated Credit Exchange have not harmed air
quality.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever may have gone on here does not affect air quality. We
are the keeper of the records, [and] we know precisely how many
credits there are, and there are only the amount of credits
prescribed under the RECLAIM rules.</TE>
<TE>   "This is simply a matter of an allegation of potential fraud
between parties trading credits," Wallerstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Wallerstein said the allegations are serious enough
that, to ensure the integrity of RECLAIM, the AQMD has launched an
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that the credit program, from an air quality
perspective, has operated properly, but we cannot ensure that there
isn't some fraud at some point in time between parties in terms of
financial transactions," Wallerstein said. "If there are, we will
prosecute them under the full extent of the law."</TE>

<CX>   Calpine earnings--A story in Tuesday's California section about
allegedly fraudulent transactions associated with an air pollution
trading program incorrectly reported that Calpine Corp. had announced
the previous week that problems with the program caused the company
to revise its earnings downward. In fact, Calpine announced the
$11.5-million earnings revision in March, when it said it also had
noted the change in its annual report.</CX>

<HD>Would Sale of O.C. Register Silence Libertarian Voice?</HD>
<DH>Media: Newspaper has helped shape course of national
politics. Board pondering options.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MARTELLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Early next month, descendants of R.C. Hoiles--the one-time newspaper
publisher and a standard-bearer for libertarianism--will gather for
what could become a watershed moment for Orange County's famously
conservative character.</LD>
<LD>   On the agenda: The possible sale of Freedom Communications, the
privately held company through which Hoiles' descendants run the
Orange County Register, 27 smaller daily newspapers, 37 weeklies and
eight television stations.</LD>
<LD>   At issue is a desire by some of Hoiles' descendants--led by
grandson and Freedom board member Tim Hoiles--to earn more income
from their holdings. Options to be discussed at the Aug. 10-11
meeting include leaving things as they are, arranging a partial
buyout of the cash-hungry heirs and selling the company, which is
estimated to be worth up to $2 billion.</LD>
<TE>   Such a sale would end nearly 70 years of Hoiles family ownership
of the Register, just two years after the heirs of Harry Chandler
made a similar decision and sold Times-Mirror Co.--publisher of the
Los Angeles Times--to the Chicago-based Tribune Co.</TE>
<TE>   There's more at stake, though, than the possibility of another
family-owned newspaper being gobbled up by a chain.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, political and academic observers say, the Register
has represented the philosophical heart of its core readership, a
symbiotic relationship that has not only brought riches to Hoiles and
his descendants, but helped shape the course of national politics.</TE>
<TE>   As the Chandlers used The Times to push a business and development
agenda in the early years of Los Angeles, Hoiles used his paper to
spread his brand of libertarianism.</TE>
<TE>   He positioned the Register as a bulletin board and bully pulpit
for libertarian and conservative causes, helping launch grass-roots
political efforts in the 1950s and 1960s that fueled the presidential
bids of Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think you can underestimate their role in helping shape
the political culture of the region," said Lisa McGirr, a Harvard
history professor who has studied the rise of conservative politics
in Orange County. "The Register really helped introduce many people
to conservative politics and ideas. It helped shape a relatively
unformed dissatisfaction with American liberalism into a right-wing
ideology."</TE>
<TE>   The paper has evolved in the years since Hoiles' death in 1970,
and the news pages no longer sound the libertarian or conservative
clarion call. The editorial pages, though, remain staunchly
libertarian. "We believe in a very consistent point of view, that we
would always do our best to foster discussions about what it would
mean to be free," publisher Chris Anderson said Monday. "So we're not
very popular in some of the views that we would take. People would
see them as rather liberal."</TE>
<TE>   He cited the paper's support for decriminalization of drugs and
prostitution, for ending the U.S.-led trade embargo of Cuba, and its
recent criticism of the detention of hundreds of foreign-born U.S.
residents in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terror attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The company even has a staff philosopher: Tibor Machan, a noted
Hoover Institution research fellow and business ethics professor at
Chapman University, advises the chain on public policy issues.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the Freedom chain's editorial viewpoint would stay
libertarian under new ownership is a matter of debate. Anderson
declined to speculate, but outside experts say newspaper chains in
recent years have often left local editorial voices intact when they
take over. Gone are the days of newspaper barons like Pulitzer and
Hearst, who insisted on a uniform message.</TE>
<TE>   "Typically, most chains allow the local unit a great deal of
autonomy," said Dave Demers, author of "The Menace of the Corporate
Newspaper: Fact or Fiction" and a professor at Washington State
University. "They know their operations are different and the local
politics vary, so they will allow the local publisher and editor to
set that general framework for editorial policy."</TE>
<TE>   Tony Fellow, who teaches American media history at Cal State
Fullerton and USC's Annenberg School of Communications, agreed. "I
think the bottom line for any newspaper is to make money through ad
revenues and enlarging circulation," he said. "People still want that
hometown newspaper that reflects the community. It behooves the new
owners to continue the newspaper's [viewpoint.]"</TE>
<TE>   Yet the community the Register serves has been evolving rapidly.
Where the area was once dominated by farmers and transplanted
engineers from the Midwest, fresh waves of immigration have made the
county increasingly diverse both ethnically and politically.</TE>
<TE>   Despite increases in numbers of Democrats over the years,
Republicans dominate the county's electoral life, and they are in
turn heavily drawn from the conservative wing of the party.</TE>
<TE>   "Orange County is so unique and the Register, for all its ups and
downs, has matched that uniqueness," said Lois Lundberg, chairwoman
of the Orange County Republican Central Committee from 1976 to 1985.
"I would hate to see it become a standard thing that could be from
any city. I would hope that they do not sell it. I consider it a
valuable service to the Republican Party and politics."</TE>
<TE>   The Register's political character reflects the thinking of
Hoiles, who passed his philosophy on to his sons and successors as
publisher, Clarence and Harry Hoiles, both deceased. The current
generation of owners now numbers more than 80.</TE>
<TE>   Hoiles, born in 1878 in Alliance, Ohio, studied engineering in
college but quickly entered the newspaper business through his
brother, Frank, who owned the daily Alliance Review. Eventually, the
brothers became partners but fell out over politics, according to a
history published on Freedom's Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Hoiles published several small Ohio newspapers until 1932. He then
left the business for three years, devoting himself to reading
political and philosophical tracts by Ayn Rand, John Locke and Henry
David Thoreau, among others.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Hoiles got back into newspapers by buying the Santa
Ana Register in 1935, his view of the world was anchored in the
libertarian perspective, where the concept of personal freedom
trumped all.</TE>
<TE>   Education was not the government's business, according to this
philosophy. Private initiative was good and unfettered free markets
were part of the natural order of things. Communism was evil and
Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his liberal descendants were a danger
to America.</TE>
<TE>   Hoiles' philosophy became his paper's philosophy, and together
they emerged as the flagship for libertarianism and Western-style
conservatism, building a like-minded electorate through proselytizing
and exposing readers to heavy doses of conservative viewpoints.</TE>
<TE>   "Hoiles was an extreme maverick," said McGirr, author of "Suburban
Warriors: The Origins of the New American Right." In the 1950s and
1960s, "what the paper did was serve as a community bulletin board
for conservative networking and conservative ideas ... and letting
people know what was going on."</TE>
<TE>   Key, she said, was the "Clearinghouse," a regular page of
submissions from readers and politicos in which the conservative
issues of the day were argued, and movements organized.</TE>
<TE>   The Register was one of the few American newspapers to oppose the
federal government's internment of Japanese Americans during World
War II. Such a move, Hoiles argued, fell outside government's
authority.</TE>
<TE>   In the Cold War years, Hoiles' paper was one of the few places
where the John Birch Society--generally dismissed as part of the
political fringe--was granted space to promote its viewpoint.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Barbaro, president of the Orange County Democratic Party,
grew up in Garden Grove during that era, and remembers the Register
as the cement in the local conservative culture.</TE>
<TE>   Barbaro's family moved to Orange County in 1954, and Barbaro--then
a conservative--recalled a political atmosphere of rabid
anti-communism fueled in part by the Register. One of his high school
teachers, he said, was dismissed for assigning students to read Karl
Marx's "A Communist Manifesto" along with Goldwater's "The Conscience
of a Conservative."</TE>
<TE>   "In those days, Orange County was the ultimate 'conscience of the
conservative,' " he said. "We were Goldwater."</TE>
<TE>   Barbaro's politics shifted to the moderate center when he attended
college in the 1960s--he calls himself a "Truman Democrat"--but he
believes the Register is still important to local conservatives'
self-identity.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the Register [editorial page] is the embodiment of the
ultra-right wing, knee-jerk fundamentalist Republican," Barbaro said.</TE>
<TE>   Politics aside, the Register has been a successful business. It is
the dominant journalistic voice in Orange County, with a daily
circulation of about 320,000, fourth largest in the state.</TE>
<TE>   A big change came to the Register in the mid-1970s, after Hoiles'
death, when the news pages began embracing the more detached approach
of mainstream journalism, said Fred Smoller, a political science
professor at Chapman University.</TE>

<HD>Supervisors to Vote on Online Sex Offender Map</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County residents may soon be able to log onto home
computers and view an online map showing where convicted sex
offenders live, officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who proposed the map, said such
information would be useful to parents during "a critical time when
we have predators taking advantage of innocent children."</LD>
<LD>   The Board of Supervisors is scheduled to vote on the proposal
today, and a majority of Antonovich's colleagues said through aides
that they support the idea.</LD>
<TE>   The proposal calls for a map showing the general locations of the
nearly 18,000 convicted sex offenders living in the county.</TE>
<TE>   Symbols would mark 225 "high risk" offenders who have been
convicted of sexual assault or assault with intent to rape.</TE>
<TE>   Symbols on the Map</TE>
<TE>   Other symbols would show the locations of parks and schools.</TE>
<TE>   Antonovich said he expected the map to be on the county's Web site
within a month and to cost about $48,000 to establish and maintain.</TE>
<TE>   Under Megan's Law, named for a 7-year-old New Jersey girl who was
raped and killed by a paroled sex offender, information about sex
offenders is available via computer at sheriff's stations and on
postings at some pools and parks.</TE>
<TE>   Under an order proposed by Supervisor Gloria Molina in 1998, Los
Angeles County residents are informed by mail or door-to-door visits
when a "high-risk" offender relocates or is identified on their
block.</TE>
<TE>   "This site would really add to what the county is already doing,"
said Miguel Santana, a spokesman for Molina.</TE>
<TE>   State law prohibits placing the names and addresses of sex
offenders on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   But it allows the public to get the names at local police and
sheriff's stations.</TE>
<TE>   Antonovich said he hopes parents will use the Web site to learn of
sex offenders in their neigh- borhoods and then go to local sheriff
and police stations to "find the exact location, photograph and rap
sheet of these individuals."</TE>
<TE>   Antonovich said he wasn't worried that residents would use the map
to find and harass convicted sex offenders.</TE>
<TE>   "I would rather err on the side of the child's safety," Antonovich
said.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego County established a similar site July 1.</TE>
<TE>   It received 304,000 hits that first day.</TE>
<TE>   Officials there attributed the interest to publicity surrounding
the abduction and slaying of 7-year-old Danielle van Dam and said
that, on average, 70,000 hits are still logged on the site daily.</TE>
<TE>   Effort in San Diego</TE>
<TE>   Last year, no more than 300 people entered San Diego sheriff
stations to look up information on sex offenders in their area, said
a spokesman for the San Diego County sheriff.</TE>
<TE>   Molina and Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke said through
representatives that they support the proposal.</TE>

<HD>6 Alleged Gang Members Held in Pair of Shootings</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Six suspected gang members from Pacoima were arrested in connection
with a pair of shootings that left one man dead and another with
possible brain damage, Los Angeles police said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Five men--Alberto Ramos, 25; Aurelio Aguirre, 18; Ivan Franco, 20;
Jose Angulo, 21; and George Andrade, 23--were being held on suspicion
of killing Efrain Rivera, 22, of Pacoima on Sunday, Det. Frank Bishop
said.</LD>
<LD>   A sixth man, 24-year-old Guillermo Magallanes, was arrested on a
parole violation and may face additional charges in the shootings,
Bishop said.</LD>
<TE>   Rivera was pumping gas at a Pacoima station in the 12000 block of
Van Nuys Boulevard about 1:20 p.m. Sunday when a white sport utility
vehicle pulled up, Officer Jack Richter said. One of the SUV's
occupants apparently argued with Rivera before several shots were
fired, Richter said.</TE>
<TE>   Rivera was hit at least once in the chest and died later at an
area hospital, Richter said.</TE>
<TE>   About four hours later, near Carl Street and Pala Avenue, the same
vehicle was spotted at the scene of another shooting, Bishop said. In
the second incident, about 30 shots were fired, and one man was hit
in the head, Bishop said.</TE>
<TE>   The injured man, who was not identified, is expected to live, but
faces the possibility of permanent brain damage, Bishop said.</TE>
<TE>   The suspects are expected to be arraigned today.</TE>

<HD>Simon's Aid to Parents</HD>
<DH>Election: Gubernatorial candidate proposes child-care tax
breaks for parents, as well as for businesses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr. on Monday proposed
a tax credit for parents to offset the cost of child care, and a tax
break for businesses that provide day care to employees' children.
The cost to the state, he said, would be nothing.</LD>
<LD>   Like his earlier proposal to cut California's capital gains tax,
Simon said, the tax breaks for child care would stimulate business,
making up for the lost revenue.</LD>
<LD>   "To the extent you can encourage people to come to work because
the employers can give them some form of child care, that in turn
will encourage businesses to thrive," Simon said.</LD>
<TE>   "So, ultimately, there may not be any impact at all."</TE>
<TE>   Simon announced the proposed tax breaks at a day-care center near
Skid Row as toddlers played in a sandbox behind him.</TE>
<TE>   Women a Priority</TE>
<TE>   It was the first of several Simon events this week that his
campaign has designed to appeal to women.</TE>
<TE>   California women have strongly favored Democrats in recent
elections, so Simon strategists have made it a priority to win them
back.</TE>
<TE>   Simon will hold a forum in the Bay Area this week to discuss
business issues with female entrepreneurs. He'll stage a similar
event in Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   In laying out his proposals, Simon accused his Democratic rival,
Gov. Gray Davis, of neglecting the needs of working parents.</TE>
<TE>   "Why has our governor chosen to ignore the plight of California's
families for these last 3 1/2 years?" Simon asked. "Why does Gov.
Davis' proposed budget package make fewer parents eligible for
child-care assistance?"</TE>
<TE>   Rita Saenz, director of the state Social Services Department, said
Simon's remarks were misleading because Davis had increased
child-care spending since 1999 by 62% to $2.8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Salazar, a spokesman for Davis' reelection campaign, said
Simon "has no idea what he's talking about."</TE>
<TE>   He cited Davis' approval of tax incentives similar to those
proposed Monday by Simon.</TE>
<TE>   "Those of us who--unlike Mr. Simon--can't afford British nannies,
know that Gov. Davis has significantly increased funding for
child-care services for low-income working families," Salazar said.</TE>
<TE>   He also challenged the premise that Simon could provide new tax
breaks at no cost to the state--at a time when California faces a
budget gap of nearly $24 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "He's asking us to just take it on faith " Salazar said.</TE>
<TE>   In his one-page package of child-care proposals, Simon offered few
details.</TE>
<TE>   The list did not include the tax break for employers, but Simon
described it during his visit to the day-care center.</TE>
<TE>   He said employers would get a tax deduction for providing "certain
types of child care" but did not specify what types of care or how
much the deduction would be.</TE>
<TE>   Details Are Fuzzy</TE>
<TE>   Simon did not say how much the tax credit would be for parents
whose children receive child care, or how the state would determine
eligibility.</TE>
<TE>   Simon also said he would reduce the regulatory burden on
child-care providers without compromising safety, but he did not
specify what rules he would scrap.</TE>
<TE>   He called for consolidating state child-care programs under the
Department of Education.</TE>
<TE>   Simon also proposed expanding the number of parents receiving
child-care subsidies by providing less to families with higher
incomes. "There is no excuse for not exploring innovative ways to
provide more care with the same amount of money," he said.</TE>

<HD>A 5-Year-Old's Words, an Officer's Art</HD>
<DH>Crime: A child witness' description led to the arrest of a
suspect in the Samantha Runnion kidnapping-murder. Experts say kids
can be reliable observers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE ANTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the hours after Samantha Runnion's kidnapping, police fanned out
in the hunt for clues. When Michael Streed was called in, he armed
himself with a pencil, a pad of paper and the memory of a 5-year-old
witness to the crime.</LD>
<LD>   "I was nervous, just sick to my stomach knowing this girl was out
there," said Streed, 44, an Orange Police Department patrol officer
and one of only a handful of trained police sketch artists in
Southern California. "I just wanted to do the best job I could."</LD>
<LD>   Streed's drawing of the suspect--a Latino male with slicked-back
black hair and a mustache--was based solely on the description given
by a 5-year-old girl named Sarah, who was with Samantha when she was
snatched from outside her Stanton condo July 15.</LD>
<TE>   "It was the only link we had to try to track this man down,"
Orange County Sheriff Mike Carona said.</TE>
<TE>   Four days later, 27-year-old Alejandro Avila was in jail, charged
with kidnapping, sexual assault and murder. Sarah's detailed
description--and the sketch it produced--is likely to be a key piece
of evidence as Avila goes to trial.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the sketch led to tips that led to Avila.</TE>
<TE>   "If any hero comes out of this, it's her," Streed said of Sarah.
"She showed a lot of bravery, a lot of poise and presence of mind.
She's an average 5-year-old with above-average skills."</TE>
<TE>   Eyewitness identification is far from a perfect police tool. But
experts who study the psychology of human memory say that
descriptions provided by children aren't any better--or worse--than
those given by adults.</TE>
<TE>   "I would much rather have the observation of a 5-year-old who was
paying attention than a 20-year-old who wasn't paying attention,"
said Robert William Shomer, a psychologist who has worked as an
expert witness in more than 300 criminal trials.</TE>
<TE>   One advantage children have is that their description of events
and suspects are less likely to be cluttered by bias or fear.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a lot of people make too big a deal of problems with
children as eyewitnesses," said former FBI agent Kenneth Lanning, a
consultant on crimes against children. "There is an unbelievable
honesty and a lack of any kind of slanting ... with a child."</TE>
<TE>   What's crucial, Lanning and others said, is that the child is
interviewed correctly with open-ended--not leading--questions.</TE>
<TE>   Studies show that child witnesses are much more susceptible to
suggestion than adults. If interviewed by authorities not trained in
pulling unbiased information out of children, anything can happen,
experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "That's how you end up with a zillion people at the McMartin
Pre-School saying, 'I was abused,' "--something prosecutors never
proved, said Elizabeth Loftus, a leading expert on memory and a
psychology professor at the University of Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The 1980s McMartin case, in which workers at the Manhattan Beach
school were accused of molesting dozens of children, ended in the
acquittal and dismissal of charges after the longest trial in the
nation's history. The case changed how children are interviewed by
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest thing is to make people comfortable with you so that
they will be comfortable in accessing their memory," Streed said.</TE>
<TE>   Trained in the forensic interviewing of children, Streed sat in a
small chair for two hours questioning the soft-spoken, 3-foot
witness. "I have a lot of faith in the ability of kids to recall
things and give truthful testimony," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But studies also show that children as young as 6 have already
developed a "cross racial deficit"--a handicap in accurately
describing people who are not of their own race.</TE>
<TE>   Sarah, who is of Korean heritage, described a man whom authorities
labeled an "Americanized Hispanic."</TE>
<TE>   "Kids have less experience with a broad range of racial
differences," said Roy Malpass, who runs the Eyewitness
Identification Research Laboratory at the University of Texas at El
Paso.</TE>
<TE>   "But if a kid comes from a neighborhood where half the population
is Asian and half the population is Hispanic, she probably knows the
difference."</TE>
<TE>   The 2000 Census depicts the area around the Smoketree Condominiums
where Sarah lives as a microcosm of multiethnic Southern California:
56% white, 22% Asian and 28% Latino.</TE>
<TE>   "She was able to describe for us a Korean accent, an English
accent and a Hispanic accent," Carona said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there are hurdles to overcome with children, experts say.
Child witnesses have less developed cognitive skills.</TE>
<TE>   Because of that, they have a harder time specifying
characteristics such as height, color and age.</TE>
<TE>   "In general, we're much more accurate identifying people who look
just like us--not just in regards to race and culture, but age,"
Shomer said. "Kids will be much more accurate describing other kids,
rather than adults."</TE>
<TE>   In the recent kidnapping of 14-year-old Elizabeth Smart, Salt Lake
City police say they've been unable to assemble a composite sketch of
the suspect because her 9-year-old sister can't sufficiently describe
his face.</TE>
<TE>   But Sarah could, and authorities credit her with giving them a
huge leg up in making a quick arrest in the Runnion case.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got to thank Sarah," Carona said. "She is an incredible
witness."</TE>

<LD>California has added new power plants that can produce enough energy
to operate about 3 million homes, state officials said, but a
financial slump has them worried about future energy supplies.</LD>
<LD>   Plants built since May 2001 produce 4,100 megawatts, said Steve
Larson, executive director of the California Energy Commission, the
agency that licenses and approves new power plants.</LD>
<LD>   The commission expects to gain 3,600 megawatts from plants
scheduled to be running by next summer, Larson said, and 2,400
megawatts are expected the following year.</LD>

<LD>The bodies of a mother and father who drowned with four of their
children during a family outing here tested positive for
methamphetamines, toxicology test results showed Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "There wasn't enough methamphetamine for an overdose, but it was
enough to affect their judgment," said Margaret Soliz of the Kern
County coroner's office. "There was a fair amount in their system."</LD>
<LD>   Officially, Martin and Charlotte Skaggs drowned, but
methamphetamine intoxication was a contributing factor, Soliz said.
The two, both 45, had previous drug convictions, Kern County
sheriff's investigators said.</LD>
<TE>   The parents and their children--Melanie, 10; April, 8; Lindsey, 7;
and Travis, 5--died July 2 during a family outing at Lake Isabella.
They were wading on a shallow sand bar in an area where the bottom
falls away sharply, authorities said. Investigators called their
deaths a tragic accident.</TE>

<LD>With 61 killings so far this year, compared with 47 in the same
period last year, Oakland is mirroring a countrywide rise in crime
after years of declines, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   At this pace, the city could have more than 100 murders by year's
end for the first time since 1995, officials said. Mayor Jerry Brown,
who joined in a recent march of 4,000 people demanding an end to the
violence, plans to ask the City Council today for $40 million to $50
million to add 100 officers to Oakland's streets over the next five
years. The money would come from increased parking and hotel taxes.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A state commission can grant emotional-distress awards to housing
discrimination victims, the California Supreme Court has ruled.</LD>
<LD>   The court upheld an order from the Fair Employment and Housing
Commission that landlord Nancy Konig pay Sheryl Annette McCoy $10,000
for unjustly refusing to rent a duplex unit. The commission said
Konig's refusal to McCoy, who is black, had been racially motivated.
Konig appealed, arguing that only courts can make emotional-distress
awards.</LD>
<LD>   The commission has awarded emotional-distress damages to housing
and labor discrimination victims since 1992. In its 6-1 opinion
Monday, the Supreme Court said the Legislature had given the
commission such power.</LD>

<HD>County to Seek Tax Hike for Hospitals</HD>
<DH>Health: L.A. supervisors want to keep emergency rooms open.
Taxpayer group is opposed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI and GARRETT THEROLF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County supervisors are expected to do something today
that few politicians enjoy--ask voters to help them raise taxes.</LD>
<LD>   With the board expected to place on the November ballot a tax to
maintain emergency room services, the supervisors are making a
calculated gamble: That the pain of being identified with a tax hike
pales in comparison with the problem of slashing the part of their
sprawling system that is used by all classes of voters, not just the
poor and uninsured.</LD>
<LD>   The political risk for the supervisors is low. All five ran
unopposed in the past election cycle, and no incumbent elected
supervisor has been beaten at the polls since 1980. But backers and
opponents of the tax say the stakes are high.</LD>
<TE>   Proponents describe the tax as the last chance to save a fraying
emergency network that treats thousands annually but is threatened by
the closing of public hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   "Every man, woman and child is one drunk driver away, one gunshot
away, one stabbing away from a trauma center," said Supervisor Zev
Yaroslavsky, who is proposing the tax.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope people who are normally averse to taxes will see the
wisdom of this investment."</TE>
<TE>   Jon Coupal does not. The head of the anti-tax Howard Jarvis
Taxpayers Assn. says supervisors need to cut instead of add taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "California and Los Angeles go way beyond federal requirements in
terms of general assistance and health care," Coupal said. "The
question becomes, in times of budgetary restraints, why are you
providing more health care than required by law?"</TE>
<TE>   "The reaction of most taxpayers," he concluded, "is, if this is as
much of a priority, why don't you reshuffle what you already have?"</TE>
<TE>   The reshuffling has already begun. Supervisors cut $150 million
earlier from their health budget this month to take the first bite
from a projected $800-million deficit caused by a loss of federal
aid.</TE>
<TE>   But when the health department listed what else would have to be
cut to balance the books this fall, the board balked. The list
included reducing Olive View-UCLA Medical Center in Sylmar and
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center near Torrance to outpatient clinics.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, a majority of supervisors have said in interviews that
they are willing to ask voters for more money. The proposed annual
assessment of three cents per square foot of developed property would
generate an estimated $175 million for emergency services and
combating bioterrorism.</TE>
<TE>   That would not solve the county's financial difficulties, but
supervisors hope it would encourage Sacramento or Washington to
provide more money by demonstrating that county taxpayers are willing
to make a sacrifice.</TE>
<TE>   The supervisors have limited choices on the health front. Put
simply, they can either cut services--something they have long
resisted--or find new money.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors could dip into their reserves, where they have an
estimated $500 million for one-time emergencies, or borrow money, but
both of these alternatives have drawn sharp criticism from financial
experts. They could try to persuade Sacramento or Washington to help,
but both capitals are wrestling with their own budget deficits.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 13, the 1978 anti-tax ballot measure that capped
property tax increases, leaves counties with few options for
generating money. So counties raise funds by adding other taxes.
Those taxes can take the form of the parcel tax proposed by
Yaroslavsky, which must be approved by two-thirds of voters.</TE>
<TE>   Or they can be some form of a sales tax, such as the fee state
Sen. Gloria Romero (D-Los Angeles) has proposed levying on all
alcohol sales in the state.</TE>
<TE>   That bill would generate as many as $700 million for emergency
health services statewide but it is unclear whether it would pass the
Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   Since Proposition 13, Los Angeles voters have shown a willingness
to pay more taxes for specific public services. They twice approved
half-cent sales taxes for public transportation, and also agreed to
pay a parcel assessment of about $19 per parcel to expand parks.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles' proposed health tax, also to be assessed per parcel,
is similar to one passed by Alameda County voters in the 1980s. That
parcel tax amounts to $23.94 per average single-family home and funds
Alameda County's emergency medical system.</TE>
<TE>   Voters "tend to find dedicated taxes more attractive than general
taxes," said Bill Carrick, a veteran political consultant based in
Los Angeles. "We've never had, in L.A., an overwhelming public
sentiment against dedicated taxes."</TE>
<TE>   Though public sector unions are expected to push forcefully for
the tax, there is some opposition. Supervisor Mike Antonovich has
blasted the measure, and is instead proposing that taxpayers be
allowed to voluntarily contribute money to health care.</TE>

<HD>State Buys Rail Land for Riverfront Park</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEORGE RAMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State park officials took over ownership Monday of 10 acres of
railroad land along the Los Angeles River for $8.2 million, clearing
another hurdle in the campaign to create a riverfront state park in
northeast Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement cheered officials and others who have argued for
several years that the site, dubbed Taylor Yard, was unsuitable for
commercial use, especially since Cypress Park and other northeast
communities need more open space and parks.</LD>
<LD>   "This is big for us," said Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg (D-Los
Angeles), who has supported an urban park along the river. "This is
another step in creating a state park that will meet the needs of
underserved communities like Cypress Park and Elysian Valley."</LD>
<TE>   In December, the state acquired 30 acres from Union Pacific
Railroad for $22.5 million in Proposition 12 funds. The latest
acquisition, also paid for by the 2000 state park bond measure, makes
the 40 acres the state now owns a complete parcel.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the state Department of Parks and Recreation,
prompted by area residents and activists, are considering another
Union Pacific property, a 62-acre site along the north side of the
Los Angeles River.</TE>
<TE>   Talks about that parcel have yet to begin in earnest, but
Goldberg, in whose district the park would be located, said she
thinks the state can persuade the railroad to sell that parcel too.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because these communities are underserved [with park space],
we aren't going to settle for just 40 acres," she said. "We want the
whole ball of wax."</TE>
<TE>   State parks officials used Monday's closing of escrow on the 10
acres to underscore Gov. Gray Davis' commitment to creating urban
park space. A new park at Taylor Yard is part of Davis' plan to
acquire 6,230 acres across California for new state parks, they say.</TE>
<TE>   "The residents there have made it very clear that they need
parkland and this is part of the governor's urban park commitment,"
said Roy Stearns, a state parks spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   December's announcement of the first Taylor Yard purchase was
coupled with a $36-million purchase of 32 acres near Chinatown, known
as the Cornfield, for parkland and open space.</TE>

<HD>Woman, 18, Says She Was Drugged and Gang-Raped</HD>
<DH>Hearing: College student testifies four Valley men, one an
acquaintance, forced themselves on her at a Simi Valley home. Defense
argues that the sex was consensual.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An 18-year-old college student testified Monday that she was drugged
and gang-raped by four San Fernando Valley men at her Simi Valley
home earlier this year.</LD>
<LD>   Eyeing her alleged attackers across the courtroom, the woman told
a judge she became groggy and weak after drinking a glass of water
allegedly spiked with the drug Ecstasy.</LD>
<LD>   She said she heard one of the men tell his friends, "I think she's
ready." Then she felt two men pick her up and drop her at the edge of
her bed.</LD>
<TE>   Thirty minutes later, she testified, she awoke to find one raping
her and another trying to force her to orally copulate with him.</TE>
<TE>   "I could hear people talking and laughing," the woman testified.
"It was like I couldn't feel my body."</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey Pineda, Brian Jafari, Yan Karim, all 20, and Dejon Lee,
22, face charges of forcible gang rape, rape with the use of drugs,
robbery and related allegations that could send each to prison for
more than 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for the four men, who were arrested by Simi Valley
police about an hour after the alleged assault and are now free on
$250,000 bail each, say their clients are innocent.</TE>
<TE>   During a preliminary hearing that began Monday in Ventura County
Superior Court, the defense tried to depict the Jan. 11 sexual
encounter as consensual and suggested the victim was lying.</TE>
<TE>   The woman, who was on the witness stand for several hours,
repeatedly told Judge Donald Coleman that she never consented to sex
with the defendants and did not agree to be drugged.</TE>
<TE>   According to her testimony, the woman knew Pineda, a North
Hollywood resident, and had invited him to the house in Simi Valley
where she rented a room.</TE>
<TE>   Pineda showed up with the co-defendants, residents of North
Hollywood and Studio City, sometime after midnight, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Although they had not been invited, the woman let Pineda's friends
into the house, she testified. The men drank shots of rum in the
kitchen, and she drank one shot and a glass of water, she said, and
they all went upstairs to watch a movie in her bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   About 20 minutes later, she testified, her vision became blurred
and she began to feel weak. She told the judge she remembers Pineda
saying, "I think she's ready," and then moving her to the end of the
bed where someone removed her shirt.</TE>
<TE>   That was at 3 a.m., she said, testifying that the next thing she
remembers is glancing at the clock at 3:33 a.m. and realizing that
two men were sexually assaulting her.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember begging Jeff to make them stop," she said, telling the
judge her pleas were ignored.</TE>
<TE>   She testified that she remembers Pineda later congratulating and
thanking her "for helping out his friends." She also said that before
he left, Pineda told her she owed him $20 "for the Ecstasy they'd
used."</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers questioned the woman, who now lives out of state,
late into Monday evening.</TE>
<TE>   During a tense and emotional cross-examination, she admitted to
once having sexual relations with Pineda, but denied that she
intended to have sex with him or his friends that night.</TE>
<TE>   At one point Monday, the woman acknowledged locking her bedroom
door after the four men went inside. It was a detail defense lawyers
seized on while challenging her credibility.</TE>
<TE>   But the women insisted that it was not her intent to lock her two
roommates out so she could engage in group sex.</TE>

<LD>You look around at the people in the big hotel meeting room--and it's
a nice room, with Danish and coffee laid out at the back, and
microphones and video screens set up in front--and you figure one of
two really, really serious things is going to happen here:</LD>
<LD>   Either someone like action star Casper Van Dien is going to kick
down the door and spray the room with an atomic flame-thrower,
shouting, "Die, you scum!"</LD>
<LD>   Or everyone in here is going to wind up running the country.</LD>
<TE>   Which is better? You're the American voter--you decide. But before
you choose option A and turn the dial to "scorch," read on.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More than 100 people signed up for this one-day campaign training
seminar in Los Angeles, the last of three across the nation's time
zones, from Washington, where the seminaristas were young, Ivy-ish
overachievers, to Chicago, where they were likely to be coglets in
the perpetual motions of Democratic machine politics.</TE>
<TE>   Here in L.A., Republicans outnumbered Democrats, and most of them
were not long out of school, working on farm teams at policy or
nonprofit jobs, and peering over the fence longingly into the land of
the political majors.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't boot camp for some tattooed fringe-fest in the Idaho
panhandle, but because Americans regard politics as an almost equally
unseemly pursuit, the people in this room were certainly not normal.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Schnur is co-director of the seminar. You may have heard of
him--a postgraduate spinmeister in Pete Wilson's office and a
Republican strategist at the front of the Rolodex. He told the group
more than once that "you are not normal because you care" about the
substance and the mechanics of politics.</TE>
<TE>   When Schnur said his ideal</TE>
<TE>   TV schedule would be "Inside Politics" for 23 hours a day, with
one hour for "The West Wing," they loved it--loved what would be most
Americans' idea of torture.</TE>
<TE>   That's how deep the gulf is. The seminar's higher purpose was, as
Schnur said, "to make people care more and make more people care"
about politics. "Care" is an Olympian standard when barely a third of
people even registered to vote bother to.</TE>
<TE>   Like the tread-depth on my tires, politics is something to be
ignored until it's a problem, by which time it's probably too late.
The archetypal, awful American voter was a prospective juror in
Oliver North's trial in the Iran-Contra scandal. In the most
egregious political scandal since Watergate--and don't bother
e-mailing me about Monica-gate--this woman found the news
"depressing" and Iran-Contra in particular "boring," and if her
mother even mentioned anything about the news, "I always tell her to
get out of my room, I don't want to hear it."</TE>
<TE>   E.J. Dionne's classic book</TE>
<TE>   "Why Americans Hate Politics"--which should be the homework for
this seminar--answers its own question: because politics isn't about
voters; it's about politicians.</TE>
<TE>   If voters don't see anything they want on the shelves, they don't
shop.</TE>
<TE>   You want an example?</TE>
<TE>   The campaign time spent on a flag-burning amendment--it was
insulting. How many flags do you burn every week? Is it on your to-do
list of weekend chores--"burn American flag,"</TE>
<TE>   or "Go find someone burning American flag and stop him"?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This was a shop-class seminar, not a philosophy class.</TE>
<TE>   It profiled hypothetical candidates, their strengths and their
skeletons, talking through scenarios of how a campaign handles that
sort of thing. For $40--$5 an hour, the rest underwritten by the Pew
Charitable Trusts--these folks got the absolute best there is of
campaign spinners and rainmakers, hacks and flacks, networking and
contacts.</TE>
<TE>   But it didn't, it really couldn't, get to the deeper matters of
why this matters, and the consequences when it doesn't. How come so
many candidates seem alike? Why are campaigns so long? So expensive?
And why does all this expenditure of energy and money get so little
response?</TE>
<TE>   I was discouraged. Even the cookie in my box lunch, which had
looked to be chocolate chip, turned out to be raisins--yet more
political feint and fakery, I thought.</TE>
<TE>   I cheered myself up by talking to the bright-eyed class star,
Misti Hiltner. She is 26, from Seattle, and a graduate student in
atmospheric sciences at UCLA, which makes you think she might have
gone to the wrong seminar until you hear her talk passionately about
progressive politics and Latino politics and environmental justice.</TE>
<TE>   "What I found so wonderful about this, if I am ever involved in
politics, one of the issues I hope for is that we wouldn't have to be
so partisan, especially on the environmental issues I'm concerned
about.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing I liked about this seminar was it's not too idealistic,
mixing in this is the practical part of politics and how you can
remain, sort of pure, I guess. If I'm ever going to have a life in
politics, what's it going to be like? And I think this helped.</TE>
<TE>   "There are good ways to run a campaign and bad ways to run a
campaign, like negative ads. . . . I don't think it has to be that
way. I would hope that it doesn't have to be that way."</TE>
<TE>   Thanks, Misti. I needed that.</TE>

<LD>A would-be assassin who aimed to crash an explosives-packed car into
members of Afghanistan's national leadership was foiled when
officials arrested him after a traffic accident in Kabul, the
capital, national television reported.</LD>
<LD>   The report cited a statement by the Afghan intelligence service
and did not identify the suspect, nor say how investigators learned
of his alleged plan to ram the car into a vehicle or vehicles
carrying government members.</LD>

<HD>Russians' Conflict With Chechens Reignites</HD>
<DH>War: Battle erupts near border with Georgia, which Moscow
blames for letting rebels cross.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Open warfare flared in the mountains of Russia's rebellious republic
of Chechnya on Monday as helicopter gunships chased down a band of
rebels holed up in a gorge near the Georgian border. The battle
appeared to be the first major firefight in the region since last
year.</LD>
<LD>   Russia and Georgia traded accusations over the cause and conduct
of the fighting. Russia blamed Georgia for permitting the fighters to
cross into Chechnya; Georgia accused a Russian gunship of violating
its airspace and strafing its territory.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, the United Nations announced that it was suspending
relief efforts in Chechnya after the kidnapping of a Russian aid
worker. U.N. spokeswoman Viktoria Zotikova said Nina Davidovich,
director of the Russian nongovernmental organization Druzhba, had
been missing since last Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   The mountain battle began Saturday after 60 rebels affiliated with
warlord Ruslan Gelayev entered Chechnya from bases in Georgia's
lawless Pankisi Gorge, Russia said. Russian officials claimed that
the fighters had been surrounded.</TE>
<TE>   At least seven Russian servicemen and nine rebels died in the
fighting, Russian authorities said. Such officials, however, often
understate their losses and exaggerate rebel casualties.</TE>
<TE>   Shalva Londaridze, chief of the Georgian Border Guards press
service, insisted that no border crossings were detected either by
Georgian border guards or by monitors from the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, who are keeping an eye on the
tense region. He said the fighters engaging the Russians were based
in Chechnya near the mountain village of Itum-Kale.</TE>
<TE>   "A border crossing by a group of Chechen fighters from Georgia to
Russia simply did not take place," Londaridze said by telephone from
the Georgian capital, Tbilisi. "Even the OSCE is positive about it."</TE>
<TE>   Sergei Yastrzhembsky, one of Russian President Vladimir V. Putin's
top advisors on Chechnya, accused Georgian officials of telling
"elementary lies." And Defense Minister Sergei B. Ivanov said: "We
can see perfectly well that large gangs of terrorists remain on the
territory of Georgia. Georgia as a state cannot do anything about
them.... In order to find an ultimate solution to the problem, I
personally do not see any other solution ... except using the Russian
armed forces. Commando units, first and foremost."</TE>
<TE>   Some Russian officials accused Georgian border guards of accepting
bribes to let the rebels cross. Pressing the point, Russian officers
paraded two captured rebel fighters before TV cameras.</TE>
<TE>   "Indeed, the Georgians helped us," said a handcuffed prisoner
whose name was given as Arsan Rakhimov. "They helped us on their own
territory. I do not know what they did it for--for money or not. But
the head of our group walked up to one of their border guards and
talked to him.... They let us through freely."</TE>
<TE>   The latest Chechen war began nearly three years ago when rebels
staged an incursion into the neighboring republic of Dagestan, and
after a series of apartment bombings blamed on the rebels prompted
Russian forces to reenter Chechnya. Russia seized control of most of
the territory by the spring of 2000 and declared victory.</TE>
<TE>   The conflict has since become a war of attrition with the rebels,
who set off mines and launch hit-and-run attacks nearly daily,
killing about a dozen Russian servicemen a week. The official Russian
death toll recently topped 4,000; unofficial counts are much higher.</TE>
<TE>   Observers and some government officials noted that the current
flare-up served all sides.</TE>
<TE>   The escalation was useful "for the separatists, who need to show
that they are still in fighting form, and for the [Russian] military,
which is not hurrying to bring the anti-terrorist operation to an
end," said Edi Isayev, spokesman for Russia's special envoy to
Chechnya. "And it's useful for Georgia to again officially declare
that there are no rebels on their territory."</TE>
<TE>   Alexander Golts, a military analyst with the magazine Yezhenedelny
Zhurnal, said the Russian brass needs to blame the Georgians for the
presence of Chechen rebels despite repeated assurances that they have
been wiped out.</TE>
<TE>   "Both Georgian and Russian authorities do not want to look
unprofessional and do not want to sound like they are good for
nothing," he said. "They face a dilemma: either to tell the truth and
look like complete idiots, or to cheerfully lie and blame everything
on the neighbor. But whatever they say, the war goes on."</TE>
<TE>   Russian officials assert that normal life is resuming for Chechen
civilians, who are returning to their former homes. But aid workers
say that Russian officials have been forcing refugees to return by
discontinuing food deliveries and dismantling their tents.</TE>

<HD>'Circles' Round Up Support for Venezuelan President</HD>
<DH>Latin America: In wake of April's coup attempt, civilian
groups take on the task of defending Hugo Chavez from those who still
seek his ouster.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>Lina Ron hardly seems the heart of a revolution.</LD>
<LD>   The chain-smoking widow lives in a tunnel beneath a busy Caracas
street. Her ill-fitting clothes swallow her slight frame. Her only
visible weapons are two cellular phones that ring incessantly.</LD>
<LD>   Nevertheless, Ron represents the fundamental building block of
President Hugo Chavez's controversial attempt to transform Venezuelan
society, alleviating the poverty that afflicts 80% of the population.</LD>
<TE>   The 40-year-old former student organizer runs the country's
largest and most powerful Bolivarian Circle, one of thousands of
grass-roots groups named after 19th century South American liberator
Simon Bolivar.</TE>
<TE>   Originally, the groups were supposed to foster community
development and teach the fundamentals of Chavez's so-called
Bolivarian Revolution. But since the coup attempt in April that
briefly forced Chavez from power, many circles--especially those in
Caracas, the capital--have taken on the task of defending Chavez from
those who continue to seek his ouster.</TE>
<TE>   Some circle members boast openly of being armed, while others,
like Ron, only hint darkly at the bloody consequences that could
result from any effort to dislodge the embattled president.</TE>
<TE>   At least some of the groups have spun out of control.</TE>
<TE>   "If there are any problems, there will be blood on the streets,"
said Jorge Barreto, a circle member who patrols near Chavez's
official residence and claims to have a 9-millimeter pistol close at
hand.</TE>
<TE>   The radicalization of the circles has led to fears of a far more
deadly confrontation than the April 11 coup, when military officers
and a coalition led by one of the country's top business groups
briefly seized power.</TE>
<TE>   At least 17 people were killed during an exchange of gunfire
between pro- and anti-government forces before Chavez was returned to
office 48 hours later by loyal troops and massive street
demonstrations.</TE>
<TE>   Despite appearances, Ron is a firebrand who only recently was
released from prison on charges that she incited a riot during a
demonstration in February. Ron, who claims to coordinate "thousands"
of other circle members, said the coup alerted the poor to the
dangers facing the president.</TE>
<TE>   "Chavez is loved and admired by the people. He will be defended to
the death," Ron said recently as she sat outside her home and
headquarters, a subterranean passageway that leads to a parking
garage beneath Venezuela's Central Bank.</TE>
<TE>   In response to the circles, neighborhood groups in wealthier
sections have also begun arming themselves, according to some
reports. Weapons sales have increased since the coup.</TE>
<TE>   The growing hostility is another demonstration of the continuing
polarization in Venezuelan society and the threat of a further
explosion of violence.</TE>
<TE>   "The circles are nothing more than a facade," said Liliana
Hernandez, a member of the opposition Justice First party. "They are
armed groups supporting Chavez."</TE>
<TE>   Chavez's revolution has never been well-defined. Part populism,
part socialism, part direct democracy, it has deeply divided
Venezuelan society, pitting unions, clergy, media and business
against Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   He has courted close relations with Cuba's Fidel Castro and Iraq's
Saddam Hussein in an attempt to create a political bloc opposed to
the United States and its globalization efforts. His fiery rhetoric
and four-hour-long speeches have infuriated the opposition, though he
has toned down his language since the coup.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, he began encouraging the creation of the circles as a
way to promote civic participation, to get small groups of citizens
directly involved in the government. The idea was that citizens would
apply for government funding to build sewers, to electrify rural
communities and to form employment cooperatives.</TE>
<TE>   But like nearly everything else in Chavez's revolution, the
circles themselves are ill-defined. There is a registration process,
but not all the circles participate. There is a guidebook--62 pages
long and filled with colorful graphics and vaguely spiritual
exhortations to seek "the most pure of the human race"--but it has
not been distributed to all the groups.</TE>
<TE>   Even the national coordinator admits to not knowing how many
circles exist or how many people they contain. Some estimates put the
number of participants at more than 450,000.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody can get together and call themselves a Bolivarian
Circle," said Rodrigo Chaves, a surgeon who gave up his lucrative
practice to coordinate the circles. "We are trying to put together a
national registry now."</TE>
<TE>   It is clear that at least some of the circles are engaging in
activities on the margin of the law.</TE>
<TE>   Some call themselves warriors for Chavez, patrolling the grimy
streets around the pale yellow presidential palace in downtown
Caracas with radios to quickly mobilize the faithful.</TE>
<TE>   These self-styled soldiers say they have contingency plans to
flood the city center with Chavez supporters and quickly gain access
to homemade weapons depots to confront any attempt to force Chavez
from power.</TE>
<TE>   Other groups have seized abandoned buildings, stripping them of
doors, windows and building materials to give to the poor. They boast
of clearing neighborhoods of drug dealers and gang members by beating
them with whips and sticks.</TE>
<TE>   It is also clear that other groups--perhaps the majority of the
estimated 8,000 circles nationwide--are doing exactly what they are
supposed to do, mobilizing poor communities to educate their
residents, provide job training and improve their standard of living.</TE>
<TE>   More than $500 million in government funds is available to the
circles to help them achieve their projects, as long as they have a
legal and accountable nonprofit structure in place.</TE>
<TE>   Adriana Pena is a 36-year-old graphic designer who lives in the
poor interior state of Guarico. She began to operate one of the
circles only after the coup, when she realized that Chavez's reforms
were in danger of being usurped.</TE>
<TE>   She gathered together other middle-class professionals and created
a salon of sorts, going to poorer neighborhoods and teaching classes
using books she had at home.</TE>
<TE>   The only thing she teaches, she said, is that the poor have a
right to participate in democracy. There is no instruction on how to
be communists, or how to revolt against the rich.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to help them understand the revolution," she said. "They
are poor, with a low academic level."</TE>
<TE>   The best and worst of the groups can be seen in the blocks
surrounding downtown Caracas, a collection of crumbling high-rises
and cracked streets as grimly urban as anything in the movie "Blade
Runner."</TE>
<TE>   In one abandoned building, Yasmin Manuitt teaches ceramics classes
for children and has built concrete facades for local businesses that
make them look, incongruously, like the dwarfs' cottage in "Snow
White."</TE>
<TE>   The 39-year-old navy veteran patrols the streets in a camouflage
jacket and cap and black high heels, and carries a radio that keeps
her in contact with other "guardians" of Chavez's revolution.</TE>
<TE>   She claims no special political loyalty to Chavez, though she
supports the goal of his reforms.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to help any one person," she said. "We want to help
everyone."</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, Barreto, one of Manuitt's friends, strolled along an
abandoned street where gang members once congregated.</TE>
<TE>   Barreto, also a veteran, patrols the area around the National
Pantheon, where Venezuela's heroes are buried. He said he doesn't
seek violence but is ready for it.</TE>
<TE>   He said Chavez has finally given him, and the rest of the poor, a
measure of power.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been humiliated for years. It's hard to buy a home. It's
difficult to raise our children," he said. "We are prepared and we
are ready.... If they kill one of ours, we'll take out one of
theirs."</TE>
<TE>   There are no signs that the circles are organized paramilitary
groups, training for armed combat.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, those who boast of being armed seem more like militia
members, ready to sally forth with their own pistols and rifles to
support Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   But that, say opposition members, is what makes them even more
dangerous. With little order or discipline imposed from above, the
circles are a wild card in any confrontation between those for and
against Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   "We call them circles of terror, or circles of criminals. They ...
impose the idea in the poor that they must take up arms," said
Hidalgo Valero, an ex-colonel in the National Guard arrested recently
after leading a parade against Chavez of former military officers.</TE>
<TE>   Even Chavez government officials acknowledge that some of the
circles are unruly. National coordinator Chaves, for example, called
Ron's circle a disappointment because of its focus on defending the
president.</TE>
<TE>   Chaves said most of the circles concentrate not on politics, but
on improving their communities. They build community centers, promote
local commerce and educate one another in a country that has long
skimped on services for the poor.</TE>
<TE>   After 40 years of corrupt political rule, Chaves said, the circles
represent the best chance to reform Venezuelan society from the
ground up.</TE>
<TE>   "Venezuela is a garden that was destroyed," Chaves said. "You
can't expect all of our tomatoes to be beautiful and shiny right
away."</TE>

<HD>Latin America's Indigenous Saint Stirs Anger, Pride</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>When the Vatican gave approval last year for Juan Diego
Cuauhtlahtoatzin to become the Americas' first indigenous Roman
Catholic saint, many of Mexico's 10 million Indians welcomed the
honor as holy vindication of their struggle to overcome centuries of
racism and gain recognition as first-class citizens.</LD>
<LD>   But when the church unveiled its official portrait of the 16th
century Chichimeca Indian, racial pride turned to puzzlement and, for
some, to anger.</LD>
<LD>   The portrait shows a light-skinned, full-bearded man who looks
more like one of the sword-wielding Spanish conquistadors who
subjugated the Aztec empire. It appears on millions of posters,
stamps and wallet-sized prints distributed in advance of Pope John
Paul II's arrival here today to canonize Juan Diego.</LD>
<TE>   "This is disturbing," said Fausto Guadarrama, a Mazahua Indian,
author and devout Catholic. "First we win a moral victory. Then we
get this image with Western features. Are they trying to conquer us
again through this image?"</TE>
<TE>   In a country where religious symbols carry enormous power, the
mixed signals about Juan Diego illustrate Catholicism's uneasy
relations with native Americans and, more broadly, its difficulties
in the quest for souls among non-European cultures around the world.
In Mexico, the church's mission is complicated by a shortage of
priests, the spread of Protestantism and an armed Indian revolt.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's scheduled saint-making Mass at the Basilica
of Guadalupe here is a landmark in the Catholic missionary effort, and
it touches the core of Mexico's identity.</TE>
<TE>   According to legend, Juan Diego was a Catholic convert in 1531, a
decade after the Spanish conquest, when the mother of Jesus appeared
before him as a dark-skinned Indian. When the local Spanish bishop
demanded proof of the apparition, it was on Juan Diego's rough cloak
that the heavenly lady, the Virgin of Guadalupe, miraculously
imprinted her image.</TE>
<TE>   Despite doubts by many scholars that Juan Diego ever existed, the
cult of Guadalupe flourished. In a masterstroke of religious
syncretism, Spanish missionaries spread the story of her apparition
to convert Mexico's indigenous tribes from their devotion to the
Aztec mother-goddess, Tonantzin, to the Virgin Mary.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Mexicans are overwhelmingly Catholic and mestizo, of mixed
Indian and Spanish blood, and the Virgin of Guadalupe is their
patron. But Catholicism is losing ground to other Christian
denominations, especially among Mexico's full-blooded Indian
minority. Wednesday's canonization of Juan Diego is a timely chance
to shore up the faith.</TE>
<TE>   The church is also struggling to come to terms with an often
violent Indian-rights movement led by Zapatista rebels, whose armed
uprising in the mid-1990s won support from some priests in defiance
of the Catholic hierarchy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pope's Imperative</TE>
<TE>   Reaching Mexico's Indians is so important to the 82-year-old John
Paul that he ignored Vatican advice to cancel the journey for the
sake of his fragile health. His 11-day pilgrimage, which took him
Monday from Canada to Guatemala, ends here Thursday when he beatifies
two indigenous Catholic martyrs of 1700, placing them a step from
sainthood.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's and Thursday's papal Masses are a "recognition of
Indians as peoples," Mexico's Catholic bishops said in a pastoral
letter, adding that the honored figures "can help us recapture the
Indian origins and roots of our people."</TE>
<TE>   Millions of Mexicans plan to line the pope's motorcade route and
follow the Masses on television. Large delegations are arriving here
from Indian communities in Mexico's rural south, including native
dancers in feathered headdress who will perform in the basilica.</TE>
<TE>   The ceremonies "will further the evangelization of the Indians,
because the Indians want a brother in heaven, someone to protect
them," said Father Humberto Medina, a mestizo Catholic priest who
ministers to indigenous people in Oaxaca state.</TE>
<TE>   But Indian leaders are divided on the utility of elevating Juan
Diego and the two martyrs. Critics of the church call the gestures a
belated outreach to an indigenous world that Catholic missionaries
have never fully penetrated.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Big Catholic Population</TE>
<TE>   Mexico has the largest Catholic population of any country except
Brazil. Yet many rural communities still speak Indian languages and
mix Catholic rituals with indigenous traditions passed from their
ancestors. About 10% of Mexico's 100 million people call themselves
Indians.</TE>
<TE>   None of the Mexican church's 132 bishops are Indians. Its priests
are spread so thin that indigenous Catholic communities see them as
seldom as twice a year. As in Africa, the church's requirement of
clerical celibacy makes it hard to recruit priests among Indians,
whose culture views celibate adults as incomplete.</TE>
<TE>   Until recent decades, the Catholic hierarchy rarely spoke out
against the bias and neglect that condemn many indigenous communities
here to high rates of illiteracy and infectious disease and to a
gnawing poverty rare in modern Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Evangelical Protestant missionaries have filled the vacuum,
bringing doctors and schools to indigenous villages and distributing
Bibles translated into most of Mexico's 62 Indian languages. Their
preaching against alcoholism has improved lives and won converts.</TE>
<TE>   "Other religions put more emphasis on vital questions, and they're
gaining followers," said Msgr. Hector Gonzalez, Catholic archbishop
of Oaxaca.</TE>
<TE>   According to census figures, 7.3% of Mexicans over age 5 are
Protestants, up from 4% in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   The Catholic response to this challenge has been inconsistent.
Inspired by the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s, reformers in the
church tried to incorporate customs of native peoples into Catholic
life in Latin America, Asia and Africa, much as the early Spanish
missionaries did here. But John Paul has moved to rein in that
effort.</TE>
<TE>   One reformer, Bishop Samuel Ruiz, built the Native Church of San
Cristobal de las Casas. Since 1995, his diocese in Chiapas has
ordained more than 340 deacons and recruited about 8,000 catechists,
nearly all of them Maya Indians, to help priests minister to remote
villages.</TE>
<TE>   In February, two years after Ruiz's retirement, the Vatican
suspended the ordination of new deacons in the state of Chiapas.
Vatican officials viewed the Native Church as a political base for
armed Zapatistas and worried that married deacons were taking over
the functions of the clergy. Indeed, many married deacons have begun
a campaign to become full-fledged priests.</TE>
<TE>   John Paul's elevation of Juan Diego is part of his effort to
reassert control over missionary efforts and side with the
downtrodden without endorsing armed revolt, Vatican watchers say. It
fits with his campaign to diversify the pantheon of Catholic saints
to include more non-Europeans.</TE>
<TE>   "The church's intent is a clear option for the poor," wrote
columnist Hector Zagal in the newspaper Reforma. "The great saint of
Mexico will be an Indian, who in these times of neoliberal economics
would be selling gum on the street and would be written off as an
idler by the bourgeoisie."</TE>
<TE>   But what prayers can Juan Diego answer?</TE>
<TE>   Despite his Vatican-certified capacity to perform miracles, many
wonder whether the new saint can really stop Indians from leaving the
church or achieve a stronger version of the watered-down Indian
rights bill passed by the Mexican Congress last year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not for lack of a saint that Indians are converting to
Protestantism," said Roberto Blancarte Pimentel, a sociologist at the
Colegio de Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Skepticism Among Some</TE>
<TE>   Guadalupe Espinosa, an Indian rights activist named for the
dark-skinned virgin, called the hoopla over Juan Diego a
"smokescreen" to obscure the drive by Indian communities for
political autonomy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nonsense to think that no one is going to mistreat us just
because we have an indigenous saint," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Such skepticism is fed by dismay over the official portrayal of a
pale-faced Juan Diego by what many Indians believe is still a
Eurocentric church. Their criticism has put the hierarchy on the
defensive. Cardinal Norberto Rivera, archbishop of Mexico City, now
says the church would be willing to endorse any other "dignified"
portrait of Juan Diego on posters and icons distributed in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   The larger-than-life official image that will hang in the basilica
Wednesday was chosen, church leaders say, because it is a copy of the
earliest known portrait of the saint. An anonymous artist painted the
portrait in the 18th century based on oral descriptions handed down
from Juan Diego's time.</TE>
<TE>   "During the Spanish colony, Indians were often painted to look
European, to enhance their status," said Elio Masferrer, an
anthropologist and historian. "That was racist thinking. The curious
thing is that today's church hasn't corrected it."</TE>

<HD>Beijing Invites Input on Olympics</HD>
<DH>Planning: Government asks residents to vote for a site
design, although a winner has already been chosen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHING-CHING NI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>It's not every day that the Chinese government asks its citizens for
their opinion. But the 2008 Olympic Park will be the face of the
nation when those Summer Games begin, and Beijing wants to project a
fair and open bidding process.</LD>
<LD>   So it invited members of the public to view the site plan
competition last week and pick out their favorite. Never mind that a
winner has already been chosen.</LD>
<LD>   Officials call it a preliminary draft. They say they expect much
more fine-tuning and incorporation of the people's vote. But most
Beijing residents are skeptical that they could actually change the
government's mind.</LD>
<TE>   "I didn't like anything I saw," admitted Fan Jun, 34, a
construction company manager. "The park should be more modern and
progressive so foreigners don't think we are still old-fashioned and
backward."</TE>
<TE>   Chinese leaders appreciate that psychology. They have made it
their paramount priority to seize the Olympics as a golden
opportunity to champion a rising nation and its unparalleled economic
prowess.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike with any other previous host country, China's Olympic
infrastructure must be built virtually from scratch. That enables
Beijing to dangle billions of dollars' worth of potential projects,
from stadiums to expressways, before businesses from around the
world.</TE>
<TE>   Almost half of the contestants bidding for the design of the
estimated $23-billion project covering 2,800 acres in the northern
section of the Chinese capital were foreigners--including the winner.</TE>
<TE>   The government took the liberty of hiring a jury of professionals
and choosing a preliminary winner before opening the "competition" to
the public.</TE>
<TE>   Last weekend, San Francisco's Sasaki Associates unveiled its
winning design along with about 55 other proposals now available for
Beijingers to inspect.</TE>
<TE>   When finished, the site will blossom into a mega-plex with several
sports stadiums, cultural exhibition areas, entertainment complexes,
sightseeing facilities, hotels, conference centers and a meandering
lake. Sasaki pocketed $250,000 for its design. But the firm stresses
that the competition was only for the general layout of the site. The
look of the buildings has yet to be finalized.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of residents have surveyed the exhibit, but few seem to
understand they have at least the symbolic power to veto the
government's choice.</TE>
<TE>   "Why are they asking us to vote? I thought they already had a
winner," said Li Jian, a nurse.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't see any sign telling us where to drop off the ballot,
and no one explained to us how the vote works," said fellow nurse Bao
Li as they looked around, confused.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, most people couldn't even find the winning proposal in a
maze of three-dimensional villages and Technicolor blueprints. Others
searched for something more Space Age, or more striking like the
Sydney Opera House or the Hong Kong Convention Center, where the 1997
ceremony for the territory's hand-over from British rule was
broadcast around the world.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all so abstract, I find it too hard to choose," Li Minglei,
a 29-year-old Beijinger, said as he left the museum without casting
his vote.</TE>
<TE>   Design professionals are no more pleased with the outcome of the
competition.</TE>
<TE>   Their biggest concern is that the judges overlooked the entries
that support putting a stadium on the northern end of a central axis
that bisects the imperial city. They believe it's the best way to
visually emphasize the linkage between such masterpieces as Tiananmen
Square and the Forbidden City.</TE>
<TE>   But the panel of local and internationally renowned judges leaned
instead toward preserving this geometric tradition by leaving it
open.</TE>
<TE>   That, critics say, ignores an imperial legacy that shares the same
planning concept as Washington, where Capitol Hill, the Washington
Monument and the Lincoln Memorial line up.</TE>
<TE>   "Without a structural anchor, the city's spine simply vanishes
like a railroad without a station," said Peng Peigen, an architecture
professor at Beijing's Qinghua University who also submitted a
proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "Old Beijing was built on the central axis; without the axis there
is no Beijing," said Chin Pai, an architect who works with Peng.</TE>
<TE>   But the winner doesn't endorse that concept.</TE>
<TE>   "Our idea was people, not buildings or objects, would be at the
center of the axis," said Dennis Pieprz, lead designer of the Sasaki
model, which lets the spine disappear into a forest park. "The axis
will be strongly defined through landscape elements. We think it's a
more subtle point."</TE>
<TE>   As the architects cross swords on design philosophies, ordinary
folks couldn't resist scratching out their own humble frustrations at
the exhibit's opinion booth.</TE>
<TE>   "The winning plan is way too mediocre," one viewer wrote. "I'm
very disappointed," wrote another. "Let's pick someone else!"</TE>
<TE>   Others painstakingly scribbled down their own ideas no matter how
amateurish or absurd.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the winning plan, but how about making the lake look more
like a dragon?" one person wrote, referring to Sasaki's layout. "A
dragon should have eyes. How about adding two pagodas?"</TE>

<HD>Powell Begins Push on War's 'Second Front'</HD>
<DH>Southeast Asia: U.S. fears a terrorist influx but hopes
region can be model of moderation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia</DL>
<LD>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell began a six-nation tour of
Southeast Asia on Monday, visiting countries with significant Muslim
populations that have become a top priority--and a growing source of
concern--in the U.S. war on terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Powell's mission is to press for tougher action and new
cooperative pacts in the "second front" in the counter-terrorism
campaign, U.S. officials say.</LD>
<LD>   With Al Qaeda operatives and associates active in several
Southeast Asian nations, the Bush administration fears that the
region will be exploited by extremists looking for new recruits and
new arenas in which to operate.</LD>
<TE>   But U.S. officials also see hints of political change that could
lead Southeast Asia--with encouragement and stronger American
involvement--to emerge as a new model for the 50-plus nations of the
Islamic world.</TE>
<TE>   "Southeast Asia is one of the regions most vulnerable to
terrorism," said an administration official traveling with Powell who
requested anonymity. "But Southeast Asia could also be the hope of
the future for Islam, because Islam in this region is not unitary or
monolithic."</TE>
<TE>   At his first stop, in Bangkok, Thailand, Powell told Thai
television Monday that increasing U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia
is a key goal of President Bush's foreign policy and that the U.S.
would act as a "stabilizing presence" in collaboration with its
regional friends.</TE>
<TE>   Four countries--Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and
Singapore--are now considered particularly important in the war on
terrorism. Al Qaeda operatives or supporters have been found in each
since Sept. 11. Powell is stopping in all four nations, as well as
Thailand and Brunei, this week.</TE>
<TE>   Underscoring U.S. concerns about extremism in the region,
Indonesia's largest Islamic organization came out Sunday in support
of suicide bombings as "a last resort, to fight for the truth or to
further religious principles."</TE>
<TE>   Nahdlatul Ulama, a traditionally moderate group with about 30
million members that was once headed by former President Abdurrahman
Wahid, made the statement in reaction to Palestinian suicide bombings
in Israel. More militant groups in Indonesia, the most populous
Muslim nation, have long justified suicide attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, regional intelligence agencies have also
discovered a sophisticated extremist network in Malaysia, Singapore,
Indonesia and Muslim areas of the southern Philippines that was
plotting to blow up Western embassies and attack U.S. naval vessels.</TE>
<TE>   The network's long-term goal was to oust secular governments and
create a massive Islamic theocracy in Southeast Asia. Its members had
close ties to Al Qaeda, including terrorist training in Afghanistan,
authorities say.</TE>
<TE>   The network, Jemaah Islamiah or Islamic Group, is a loosely
organized movement with disparate cells. Launched in the mid-1990s,
it has been based here in Malaysia, where Powell arrived late Monday.
It has been directed by Indonesian cleric Riduan Isamuddin, alias
Hambali, according to members arrested this year in Malaysia.</TE>
<TE>   Hambali, the subject of an international manhunt, allegedly hosted
two of the Sept. 11 hijackers and had a follower provide housing for
Zacarias Moussaoui, the so-called 20th hijacker, who is facing trial
in Virginia on charges of conspiring to commit terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Malaysia is particularly important, U.S. officials say, because it
is one of two or three modern Muslim states struggling to become
democracies while retaining a strong Islamic identity. That
combination is rare in the vast Islamic world, stretching from
Morocco in northwest Africa to Indonesia on the Pacific Ocean.</TE>
<TE>   "Malaysia stands in a class with Turkey," said the administration
official. "It is a flawed democracy with real issues, but people do
have the ability to channel their aspirations through the ballot
box."</TE>
<TE>   If Malaysia is eventually successful in creating a modern Islamic
democracy, "it will be one of the most important developments in the
Muslim world," the official added. "If we had our way, this would be
the future."</TE>
<TE>   But Jemaah Islamiah reflects Southeast Asia's vulnerability to
networks that can drift among countries struggling with internal
problems, U.S. officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "The geography is porous, so if conditions tighten up in one area,
they can go to the next without much trouble," the Bush official
said. "All have significant or majority-Muslim populations, many
going through economic or political crises" that can be exploited.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesia, an archipelago of more than 13,500 islands, is led by a
weak government struggling to make the transition to democracy and
put down multiple separatist movements. The Philippines is fighting
Muslim militants such as the Abu Sayyaf group. Malaysia has detained
at least 60 alleged extremists under the country's internal security
act since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Even Thailand has been battling a Muslim insurgency in the
southern province of Songkhla. And in December, orderly Singapore
uncovered a plot by Jemaah Islamiah to drive bomb-laden trucks into
the U.S., British, Australian and Israeli embassies. Thirteen alleged
cell members were arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of Jemaah Islamiah members have since been arrested in
various Southeast Asian nations.</TE>
<TE>   "The governments of Southeast Asia were clearly surprised by
Singapore and Malaysia as well, at the extent of what some of the
terrorist links were," said a senior State Department official who
briefed reporters traveling with Powell on Monday. "There is a new
consciousness in Southeast Asia, and we want to try to help them
encourage the implementation of that effort."</TE>

<DH>Suicide bombers are not deranged, psychiatrists say. Under
group pressure, they see logic and a 'higher purpose' in their
actions.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The list includes architects and drifters, engineers and poets,
teenagers and middle-aged men, a 30-year-old woman, an 18-year-old
girl, and, every week it seems, someone else, someone different.</LD>
<LD>   "You hear people say that these are all desperate people, or poor
people whose families need the money," said Rohan Gunaratna, a
terrorism specialist at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.
"This is nonsense."</LD>
<LD>   Long before the recent rash of suicide bombings in Israel,
psychiatrists, terrorism specialists and others were searching for
clues to what prompts people to strap on explosives and annihilate
themselves in a crowded street or cafe.</LD>
<TE>   Experts examined psychological profiles. They interviewed Sri
Lankan separatists and imprisoned Palestinian militants. They studied
the mass suicide at Jonestown, Guyana, in 1978 and the Japanese
kamikaze missions of World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Their emerging understanding contradicts the notion that suicide
bombers are deranged fanatics. The evidence is just the opposite:
They tend to be free of obvious mental illness. Many are competent,
successful, even loving and loved.</TE>
<TE>   What, then, triggers their awful acts?</TE>
<TE>   Most have fallen under the influence of an extreme group, whether
it be Al Qaeda, Hamas or the Tamil Tigers of Sri Lanka, experts say.
Like a cult, the group demands absolute obedience and promises
immortality to the most devoted.</TE>
<TE>   Conditions of chronic conflict and bloodshed endow suicide with a
sinister logic. When death seems pervasive and unavoidable, whether
in Sri Lanka or a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, members of the
group come to value its survival above their own. They become
willing, even eager, to sacrifice their lives for a greater cause--a
psychological response found not just in terrorist cells, experts
note, but among soldiers in wartime.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the suicide terrorist sees his mission as acceptable,
logical, even noble. "It can be perceived as a very idealistic act,"
said psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton, a visiting professor at Harvard
Medical School and an author who has studied cults and suicide.</TE>
<TE>   "They believe there's a higher purpose, that in some way they are
bringing about a purification, a perfection. They are destroying the
world to save it."</TE>
<TE>   A common trait of nonpolitical suicides--people who take their own
lives without harming others--is a feeling of isolation or
disconnectedness from the world.</TE>
<TE>   Suicide terrorists are anything but isolated. Often, they have
connected with others deeply, and it's this affiliation that helps
prepare them to take their own lives, said Clark McCauley, a
psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania who studies terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the group that's abnormal and extreme," McCauley said. "The
bombers themselves are psychologically as normal as you and I."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Wake-Up Call</TE>
<TE>   Americans confronted the horror of suicide attacks on April 18,
1983, when a Shiite Muslim truck bomber attacked the U.S. Embassy in
Beirut, killing 63 people. Six months later, another truck bomber
killed 241 Marines on a peacekeeping mission in Lebanon.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, more than 300 men, women and children have blown
themselves to pieces in suicide attacks around the world. Those
carried out by Palestinians in Israel have received the most
publicity, but two-thirds of the attacks occurred in Sri Lanka, where
Hindu separatists have been waging a guerrilla war for 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   The best evidence that these terrorists are mentally competent is
the planning and patience required for many of their missions.</TE>
<TE>   The Sri Lankan woman known as Dhanu who killed former Indian Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 prepared for months, performing several
practice runs, according to Gunaratna, the terrorism expert.</TE>
<TE>   Dhanu, a member of the Tamil Tigers separatist group, got so close
to Gandhi that she was able to reach out and touch him before pulling
a cord beneath her dress and ending both their lives, witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   Another Tamil bomber, Babu, worked for many months to infiltrate
the household of Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe Premadasa before
killing him in a 1993 suicide attack.</TE>
<TE>   Wafa Idris, a Palestinian woman who blew herself up in Jerusalem
in January, killing an 81-year-old man, was a volunteer paramedic who
had founded a women's relief group to assist victims of the conflict
with Israel. She was not known as an Islamic extremist.</TE>
<TE>   The 19 hijackers who carried out the Sept. 11 attacks on the U.S.
stayed in touch and under cover for many months before executing
their well-coordinated plan.</TE>
<TE>   Some attended flight schools and spent hours practicing on flight
simulators.</TE>
<TE>   Their leader, Mohamed Atta, grew up in a middle-class Egyptian
family and appeared to have a promising career ahead of him as an
architect and urban planner. Ziad Jarrah, another of the suicide
pilots, was educated, well-off and said by his Lebanese family to be
planning to get married.</TE>
<TE>   These did not appear to be mentally unbalanced people, researchers
say. Indeed, crazed loners are not likely to be selected for suicide
missions.</TE>
<TE>   "The crucial quality that recruiters look for is mental
stability," said Jerrold Post, a psychiatrist at George Washington
University who recently completed a study of 35 Palestinian militants
in Israeli jails, several of whom had recruited suicide attackers.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to levelheadedness, terrorist organizations look for a
willingness to conform and obey.</TE>
<TE>   Those qualities are not hard to find, research shows. Regardless
of education or background, most people have a tendency to follow
instructions, especially when given by an authority figure who
promotes a larger cause.</TE>
<TE>   In a series of now-famous experiments during the early 1960s,
psychologist Stanley Milgram showed how this instinctive obedience
can lead people to cross an ethical line. The authority in this case
was a scientist; the larger cause, a learning experiment in which
electric shocks would be used to "teach" word associations to a
middle-aged man (an associate of Milgram's who was not actually being
shocked).</TE>
<TE>   The participants began by delivering mild shocks, then gradually
increased the voltage. By the end, 60% were delivering 450-volt
blasts--even when the "victim" screamed for them to stop.</TE>
<TE>   This is the same principle on which many terrorist groups operate.
They begin by asking members to take small risks and gradually up the
ante, said the University of Pennsylvania's McCauley.</TE>
<TE>   The Baader-Meinhof gang in Germany, the Marxist Red Brigades in
Italy and the Symbionese Liberation Army of California included
middle-class, well-educated people who graduated from protest to
murder under the sway of impassioned leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Such groups demand total commitment and fealty. "Commanders in
Hamas"--the Islamic resistance movement in Gaza and the West
Bank--"are commanders in every way," an imprisoned terrorist told
researchers working with Post, the George Washington University
psychiatrist. "A commander's orders are absolutely binding and must
not be questioned in substance."</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the Tamil Tigers, Post said, "there's almost a
chemical connection that seems to develop between the personality of
the leader"--the reclusive Velupillai Prabhakaran--"and those of the
followers. It's as if the followers merge with each other and with
what the leader says."</TE>
<TE>   In an eerie echo of Jonestown, Prabhakaran's acolytes are said to
wear cyanide containers around their necks in case of capture.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Suicide as a Statement</TE>
<TE>   The latter 20th century offers many examples of suicide as a
political or religious statement, however eccentric or inscrutable.
In Northern Ireland in 1981, 10 prisoners starved themselves to death
to protest British rule. In 1978, more than 900 American followers of
People's Temple leader Jim Jones poisoned themselves on his orders at
the Jonestown compound in Guyana.</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago, Marshall Applewhite and 38 of his followers in the
Heaven's Gate cult killed themselves in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   They expected to shed their earthly bonds and travel to a "next
level" of existence on a spacecraft they believed was shadowing the
Hale-Bopp comet.</TE>
<TE>   Many commentators have cited Christianity's taboo against suicide
as a protection against such extremism. In Christian teaching, to
kill oneself is to sinfully reject God's gift of life. Yet the ban
was imposed in the 5th century partly to halt an epidemic of suicide
among early Christians, according to Jaroslav Pelikan, a Yale
University expert on the history of the faith.</TE>
<TE>   In those early centuries of the church's history, many believers
saw suicide as a means to prove their faith, cleanse themselves of
sin and leave the pain of this life for the bliss of the next. The
popularity of suicide among some groups prompted St. Augustine to
remark that "to kill themselves out of respect for martyrdom is their
daily sport."</TE>
<TE>   In Islam, too, strong prohibitions against suicide coexist with a
rich history of martyrdom. The Persian Assassins of the 11th century,
sometimes called the Muslim Hashshashin, were said to smoke hashish
before carrying out suicide assassinations. In the Iran-Iraq war of
the 1980s, Iranian children as young as 14 and unarmed were sent into
battle. Some reportedly had "keys to paradise" hanging from their
necks.</TE>
<TE>   Groups that sponsor suicide attacks invoke both the future world
and the ancient one to recruit and inspire. After Sept. 11,
investigators found letters in Arabic believed to have been written
by Atta, the presumed ringleader. The letters emphasize the
importance of "obeying 100%"; instruct the attackers to be
courageous, "as our predecessors [were] when they came to the
battle"; and promise that "paradise has been decorated for you with
the best of its decorations and ornaments."</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to accept for outsiders, but from the bombers' point of
view, they don't actually die in a suicide attack--they become
immortal," said Gunaratna, whose recent book, "Inside Al Qaeda,"
details the ideological indoctrination that occurred at Osama bin
Laden's training camps. "It's not the end, but the beginning. You are
surviving in a way; you are being granted an eternal life."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bonding as Soldiers</TE>
<TE>   In their willingness to sacrifice all for their group, suicide
bombers have something in common with traditional soldiers, say
researchers who have studied heroism in combat.</TE>
<TE>   If a war becomes sufficiently destructive and prolonged, troops
lose faith that they will survive, said David Marlowe, former chief
of military psychiatry at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research
in Silver Spring, Md. The question becomes not whether one will die,
but how. Under these conditions, small groups of soldiers forge an
often-unspoken pact to do anything for the good of their comrades.</TE>
<TE>   "It creates a kind of bonding between members, a love that
transcends anything you've ever known," Marlowe said. "You come to
the absolute belief that the noblest and most important thing you can
do is die for the others."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most vivid example of suicide attacks committed for
comrades and country was those by Japan's kamikaze squads in World
War II. In their oral history, "Japan at War," Haruko Taya Cook and
her husband, Theodore Cook, interviewed several former members of
Japan's "special attack corps," who survived because their missions
were canceled or foiled.</TE>
<TE>   One of them, Yokota Yutaka, recalled the words his Naval Academy
commander used to recruit suicide attackers: "If there be any among
you who burn with a passion to die gloriously for the sake of their
country, let them step forward."</TE>
<TE>   Yutaka said that all but 120 of the 2,000 young men in his academy
volunteered. On April 20, 1945, Yutaka climbed aboard a motorized
suicide torpedo, said goodbye to his comrades in arms and awaited the
order to launch. It never came.</TE>
<TE>   "I was ordered to come back in," he said. "That was the moment I
really wanted to die."</TE>
<TE>   Post, the George Washington University researcher, found a similar
yearning among the Palestinian militants he studied. One of them is
serving 26 life terms for his role in several suicide bombings. In a
prison interview, the man recalled learning from a confederate that
another suicide attack was in the works:</TE>
<TE>   "I asked him what it was all about, and he told me that he had
been on the wanted list for a long time and did not want to get
caught without realizing his dream of being a suicide bomber.... I
remember that besides the tremendous respect I had for him and the
fact that I was jealous of him, I also felt slighted that he had not
asked me [to join him]."</TE>
<TE>   People who have witnessed or been subjected to violence are
particularly susceptible to this call to immortality, researchers
say. The families of Palestinian suicide bombers often cite motives
of revenge for a father or brother killed or beaten by Israeli
soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   In Sri Lanka's contested territory, the 19-year civil war has left
very few people untouched by violence. The tragedy and nearness of
death are such that even children become fatalistic, according to
Margaret Trawick, an anthropologist at Massey University in New
Zealand who lived in Sri Lanka during the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Based on conversations with a dozen girls and young women who
belonged to the Tamil Tigers, Trawick concluded that joining the
group is itself a kind of suicide gesture: "They have no ideology but
for the words 'I want to fight.' ... Most expect to die in battle,
and many will die in just that way. They think their lives are
unimportant, and they think the same of their deaths. They seek no
fame, they ask no voice. They do wish to be remembered."</TE>
<TE>   So, for that matter, does the person who jumps off a bridge,
psychiatrists say. If there's a common thread connecting all
suicides, perhaps it is that desire: to have done something
memorable, whether for an audience of one or two or for the entire
world.</TE>
<TE>   In his 1990 book, "The Savage God," the British poet and literary
critic A. Alvarez, a failed suicide himself, writes that suicide is
"a closed world with its own irresistible logic. Once a man decides
to take his own life, he enters a shut-off, impregnable but wholly
convincing world where every detail fits and each incident reinforces
his decision."</TE>
<TE>   Once a member of Hamas or the Tamil Tigers has begun to consider a
suicide attack, the same kind of hermetic logic applies, experts say.
Only by destruction can the world be renewed; only by killing can the
group live; only by leaving the world can you leave a mark on it.</TE>
<TE>   "I think in this sense," said Lifton, the Harvard psychiatrist,
"all suicide has to do with making a lasting statement one could not
make in life."</TE>

<TE>   Suicide Through the Ages</TE>
<TE>   Suicide attacks have riveted public attention since the Sept. 11
hijackings and a rash of bombings in Israel recently. But martyrdom
and suicide attacks have been used for centuries.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Sicarii, Israel, 1st Century</TE>
<TE>   Extremists among the Zealots, a Jewish sect opposed to pagan Rome,
become known as Sicarii (from the Greek sikarioi or `dagger men').
The Jewish historian Josephus says the Sicarii used the mountaintop
fortress of Masada as a base and committed suicide in AD 73 rather
than surrender to Roman soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Hashshashin, Northern Persia, 11th century</TE>
<TE>   The Hashshashin, a Shiite Muslim sect, wage a campaign of suicide
attacks on Christian Crusaders. Lone fighters attack their targets
with daggers, knowing they themselves face certain death.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kamikaze Pilots, Pacific Theater, World War II</TE>
<TE>   Japanese pilots make suicidal crashes into enemy targets, usually
ships. Kamikaze (`divine wind') attacks sink 34 vessels and damage
hundreds. At Okinawa in 1945, more than 1,000 suicide pilots kill
nearly 5,000 U.S. service personnel.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Embassy Bombing, Beirut, April 18, 1983</TE>
<TE>   Sixty-three people, including the CIA's Middle East director, are
killed and 120 injured when a suicide attacker uses a 400-pound truck
bomb to destroy the U.S. Embassy in Beirut. The radical Islamic Jihad
claims responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Marine Barracks Bombing, Beirut, Oct. 23, 1983</TE>
<TE>   Simultaneous truck-bomb attacks on American and French compounds
in Beirut kill 241 American service members and 58 French troops.
Islamic Jihad again claims responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Airport Attacks, Rome and Vienna, Dec. 27, 1985</TE>
<TE>   Arab suicide squads attack U.S. and Israeli check-in desks at
airports in Rome and Vienna simultaneously. The machine-gun and
grenade attacks by Palestinians of the Abu Nidal group kill 20
people, including five Americans.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tamil Tigers, Nelliyadi, Sri Lanka, July 5, 1987</TE>
<TE>   The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam carry out their first suicide
bombing, killing 40 troops at an army camp in northern Sri Lanka.
Since then, the Tigers have launched about 250 suicide missions. The
hundreds of fatalities include former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Attack on Israeli Soldiers, Beit Lid Junction, Israel,</TE>
<TE>   Jan. 22, 1995</TE>
<TE>   Suicide attackers detonate two bombs back to back at a bus stop
crowded with Israeli soldiers returning from weekend furloughs. The
explosions kill 21 soldiers and one civilian and injure more than 60.
The bombing marks the beginning of a wave of suicide attacks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bombing of the U.S. Destroyer Cole, Aden, Yemen,</TE>
<TE>   Oct. 12, 2000</TE>
<TE>   Seventeen American sailors are killed and 39 injured when suicide
attackers maneuver an explosives-laden skiff to within feet of the
Cole during a refueling stop in the Yemeni port of Aden. U.S.
officials suspect Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Suicide Hijackings, Sept. 11, 2001</TE>
<TE>   Two hijacked airliners crash into the twin towers of New York's
World Trade Center, sparking an inferno that causes the massive
office towers to collapse. A third hijacked plane strikes the

Washington, crashes into a field in rural Pennsylvania, apparently
after passengers overpowered the hijackers. Thousands are killed this
day.</TE>

<HD>Power Plants Put on Hold</HD>
<DH>Energy: Lower demand, changing circumstances have companies
pulling back from crisis plans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Power companies have delayed or canceled more than half the new
plants proposed during California's energy crisis, citing lower
demand, falling electricity prices, Wall Street's reluctance to
finance projects and stifling regulations.</LD>
<LD>   Since 2000, energy producers have pulled the plug on power plants
that would have generated nearly 3,000 megawatts of power--enough to
light up 2.2 million homes, according to the state Energy Commission.
Adding in projects that have been delayed, the total is closer to
20,000 megawatts, federal regulators say.</LD>
<LD>   Following the severe shortages of 2000-2001, a burst of
construction provided large amounts of needed power to the state. But
the slowing economy, conservation and plentiful hydroelectric power
have turned the shortage into a glut.</LD>
<TE>   The glut, combined with questions over the energy sector's
credibility in the wake of the Enron Corp. scandal, has regulators,
industry executives and consumer groups fearful that another crisis
is a few years away.</TE>
<TE>   "We're at a crossroads right now," said Suzanne Garfield, a
spokeswoman for the California Energy Commission. "There's been a lot
built but a lot more is needed. We need to retire many old plants,
and imports are decreasing as nearby states use more of their own
power."</TE>
<TE>   As a result of the Enron scandal, much of the energy sector has
come under a harsh spotlight, and companies now find themselves
unable to access the financial markets for capital.</TE>
<TE>   The industry's struggles are evident at Redlands, Calif. There, at
AES Corp.'s Mountainview facility, a few workers stand watch over a
foundation where 500 laborers once toiled over what was to have been
an $800-million power-generating plant.</TE>
<TE>   AES poured more than $100 million into the project before the
firm's own retrenchment and the unwillingness of Wall Street to
provide financing forced it to suspend work two months ago on the
plant, designed to provide power for 800,000 homes.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Woodruff, an AES regional manager, blamed restrictions
imposed by Gov. Gray Davis' rescue plan, especially the state's
refusal to let AES and other power sellers strike supply deals
directly with large business users.</TE>
<TE>   The Mountainview plant in Redlands is "pretty much a ghost town
now," said David Kehnes, project manager for Arlington, Va.-based
AES, which still operates a smaller plant nearby. "And we're a
skeleton crew."</TE>
<TE>   Similar scenes are apparent throughout the industry, eight months
after the collapse of Enron started a landslide loss of faith in U.S.
business practices.</TE>
<TE>   UC Irvine professor and energy commentator Peter Navarro says the
energy companies, having manipulated the energy market, badly
overestimated demand, buried themselves in debt to build new plants
and were surprised when the economy slowed.</TE>
<TE>   "The mind set was that these higher prices would last forever,"
Navarro said. "But when prices fall to a third of where they'd been,
Wall Street figures out pretty quickly you don't have cash to service
your debts.</TE>
<TE>   "This could turn what looked like a 5-year glut of power into
probably a 2-to-3-year glut," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Announcing Monday that a big new Monterey County plant had come on
line, Gov. Gray Davis boasted that California had added 4,165
megawatts of in-state power since last summer, enough to power more
than 3 million homes. But the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
said this month that the net addition will be closer to 3,100 by year
end because some existing plants will be decommissioned.</TE>
<TE>   At a U.S. Senate energy committee meeting last week, FERC Chairman
Pat Wood said projected construction of crucial generating and
transmission infrastructure has "dropped off dramatically" as
corporate downgrades by bond analysts "dramatically escalate the cost
of credit in this industry."</TE>
<TE>   Power generators such as AES are "in the throes of a costly boom
and bust cycle," testified Larry Makovich, a senior consultant at
Cambridge Energy Research Associates. He estimated that since the
start of the year power plants capable of producing nearly 82,000
megawatts have been canceled or postponed across the nation.</TE>
<TE>   While no one is predicting anything like the shortages and soaring
prices seen in 2000 and 2001, California still must depend on having
manufacturers voluntarily cut production to get by on the hottest
days, as happened July 10.</TE>
<TE>   To Mirant Corp. executives, that shows "there's a current
supply-demand imbalance" in California, spokesman David Payne said.
For that reason, he said, the company fully intends to build a
530-watt Contra Costa plant originally set to open in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   But Mirant, whose bonds are categorized as junk by Moody's
Investors Service and Standard &amp; Poor's, delayed the plant as part of
a $2-billion cut in capital spending this year to shore up its
balance sheet. A separate Mirant proposal to build another large
plant at its Potrero facility in Northern California has been held up
for years by permit disputes, Payne said.</TE>
<TE>   Calpine Corp., a San Jose-based power plant builder with a once
fast-growing trading arm, was hit early by the credit and liquidity
crisis created by the downfall of Enron, the largest of the energy
traders. Calpine's money woes appear to have stabilized, but not
before it slashed its plant-building budget and significantly slowed
many projects.</TE>
<TE>   In California, Calpine opened three major power plants and four
smaller "peaker" units in the last year. But completion of three more
big power plants capable of generating has been pushed back several
months into 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Company spokesman Bill Highlander said the delays in California
are the result of the state's tortuous permitting process as well as
Calpine's financial woes.</TE>
<TE>   Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said complaints about regulations
and permits in the state are nothing new, adding that the fact that
companies are scaling back nationwide shows the problems aren't
specific to California. Long-term power contracts with producers,
though much criticized, will assure a supply of electricity no matter
what happens, and Davis' plan authorized the state itself to build
plants if private power proves insufficient, Maviglio said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the biggest problem for power generators is the current
unwillingness of Wall Street to finance them--a problem that is
undeniably fearsome.</TE>
<TE>   At a briefing for investors Friday, Fitch analysts noted that debt
defaults by corporations, which in the 1990s had been running less
than $10 billion a year, zoomed to $28 billion in 2000. Defaults hit
$78 billion in 2001 and $50 billion through the first half of 2002.</TE>
<TE>   High on the ratings firm's watch list these days is the energy
industry, where credit downgrades have outpaced upgrades by 18-1 so
far this year.</TE>
<TE>   Fitch managing director Richard Hunter said the "heady cocktail"
of lower prices, a credit crunch, Enron-style sham deals and
potential litigation is exerting "extreme stress" on the industry.</TE>
<TE>   One hopeful sign in California is that most of the proposed plants
have only been delayed and not canceled outright, according to Bob
Aldrich, a state official who keeps a running tab on the power-plant
situation.</TE>
<TE>   But at the same time, the uncertainty is aggravated by the fact
that many power concerns are under investigation for the allegedly
phony deals that critics say upset the energy markets and contributed
to California's crisis in 2000 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "My industry's so demonized. I feel like the new tobacco," said
Mark Byron, Dynegy Inc.'s California director of retail energy
services until he was laid off in June. The energy industry "is an
ocean of ex-employees," Byron said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to state probes, investigations are under way by FERC,
the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the Commodities Futures Trading Commission--all of which provides
fodder for those who contend the industry should never have been
deregulated in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't need to rely on these companies [and] after what they
did to us in 2001, we should not rely on them," said Douglas Heller
of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica.
"We must remember that these companies failed California long before
they failed their shareholders."</TE>

<HD>Renewed Optimism Sends Stocks Soaring</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Key market indexes post 5% gains but some
experts warn rally could prove fleeting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN and JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks soared Monday, lifting key indexes by more than 5% for the
day, as the panic to exit the market in recent weeks gave way to a
rush to get back in.</LD>
<LD>   Many investors apparently returned from the weekend more certain
that Wall Street's devastating summer decline has run its
course--though analysts cautioned that isn't a foregone conclusion.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average zoomed 447.49 points, or 5.4%, to
8,711.88, its third-biggest one-day point gain ever. Broader market
measures also rocketed.</LD>
<TE>   Added to the gains recorded late last week, the blue-chip Dow has
risen 1,009 points in four sessions.</TE>
<TE>   For professional money managers and small investors alike, the
rally that started last Wednesday has been a welcome relief, after 10
weeks of nearly relentless selling tied in part to the financial
scandals that have tainted corporate America.</TE>
<TE>   Yet many experts are reluctant to declare the end of the
28-month-long bear market--the worst in a generation--which drove
major indexes to five-year lows last week.</TE>
<TE>   "The market made a bottom last week. Whether it will hold--whether
it will be the bottom--ultimately that will depend on the economy,"
said Rod Smyth, chief investment strategist at Wachovia Securities in
Richmond, Va.</TE>
<TE>   In Europe, stocks also rallied sharply Monday, with key indexes
posting their biggest one-day gains in 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   On Wall Street, analysts said the market got a lift from a rebound
in the dollar's value against the euro and the yen, suggesting that
global investors are shifting money back to the U.S. The dollar had
plunged with U.S. share prices from May through mid-July as many
foreign investors sold American holdings.</TE>
<TE>   "The dollar depreciated too rapidly based on the assumption that
the stock market would continue to fall and that a 'double dip'
recession was in the works," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at
Wells Fargo in Minneapolis. "Traders overreacted and assumed the
worst case, and now they are back-tracking."</TE>
<TE>   The sense that Wall Street's summer sell-off has finally exhausted
itself began to take hold last Wednesday, when the Dow leaped 488
points after Congress reached a deal on a landmark corporate reform
bill.</TE>
<TE>   Over the weekend, institutional and foreign investors were cheered
by the surprise House vote on Saturday giving President Bush broader
authority to negotiate trade pacts with other nations.</TE>
<TE>   Those developments helped break through the gloom that has
dominated trading on Wall Street since May, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Many investors have worried that the U.S. economy would fall back
into recession. But those fears also have been receding in recent
days.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Marder, Los Angeles-based market strategist at Ladenburg
Thalmann Asset Management, noted Monday that some of the strongest
stock sectors were those in economy-sensitive sectors.</TE>
<TE>   The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index jumped 73.13,
points, or 5.8%, to 1,335.25.</TE>
<TE>   But Marder also noted that trading volume Monday was below recent
peaks, suggesting some investors were reluctant to join the fray.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts also warned that much of Monday's surge may have been
tied to short-term trading tactics employed by professional
investors.</TE>
<TE>   Many institutional investors, such as hedge funds and computerized
"program traders," could see from the opening bell Monday that the
market rebound that started Wednesday still had legs--and they
weren't going to be left behind, said Hank Camp, founder of the
program-trading research and consulting firm HL Camp &amp; Co. in Palm
Beach, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Hedge funds make massive bets on stocks, bonds, currencies and
other financial instruments, often using borrowed money to get the
most bang out of their investment picks.</TE>
<TE>   In program trading, money managers have their computers programmed
to automatically place buy and sell orders whenever stocks and/or
stock-futures prices hit certain levels. Some hedge funds employ
program trading as part of their strategy.</TE>
<TE>   In many cases, both hedge funds and program traders also "short"
stocks--that is, they sell borrowed shares with the hope that prices
will fall, so they can buy them back later at cheaper prices and
pocket the difference.</TE>
<TE>   When they repurchase shares to close out their transactions, it's
called covering. Short covering was a key driver behind Monday's
surge, with traders scrambling to avoid seeing their short-selling
profits shrink or vanish as the market moved higher, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "These institutions are not taking any chances on losing their
paper profits, so they're covering," Camp said.</TE>
<TE>   Though investors may feel whipsawed by recent gyrations, financial
analysts called Monday an example of how people can miss dramatic
gains by being on the sidelines even for one day.</TE>
<TE>   "We have one client who said, 'Don't buy until we see three up
days in a row,' " said Laura Tarbox, a financial planner in Newport
Beach. "Well, she's missed out on 15% worth of upside."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Tarbox cautioned, "It's yet to be seen whether this rally
can be sustained. I certainly hope so, because we've been counseling
people to hang in there for so long."</TE>
<TE>   Since their spring 2000 peaks, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 and the
Nasdaq are down 41% and 74%, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Though many analysts blame hedge funds and other fast traders for
the market's recent swings, some say corporate earnings and the
economy still are fundamental question marks facing investors.</TE>
<TE>   Major blue chip companies are expected to show about a 1% overall
gain in second-quarter profit once all have reported, said Chuck
Hill, research director at Thomson First Call in Boston. That would
be the first year-over-year gain since the fourth quarter of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts' estimates for the third quarter are falling rapidly,
Hill said. Since July 1, profit growth projections for this quarter
have slowed from 16.6% to 13.1%.</TE>
<TE>   "The pattern has changed," Hill said. "We're telling people to
enjoy the second-quarter numbers, but don't enjoy them too much."</TE>
<TE>   Smyth said he expects the stock market to "chug along" during the
summer. "If in September and October it looks like we're headed back
to recession, I have a feeling we're headed back through the lows,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Aug. 14 deadline for top corporate executives to
verify their financial statements is "bound to bring out some more
revelations" over the next two weeks, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In spite of the market's recent turbulence, some financial
advisors say investors are taking it in stride.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Grover, district manager at the Riverside office of
money-manager Waddell &amp; Reed Inc., said Monday that its individual
clients weren't rushing back into stocks because "very few of our
clients had gotten out of the market."</TE>
<TE>   They've generally stayed the course by investing steady amounts
into mutual funds, and had grown "very unhappy" with the sinking
value of those funds, Grover said.</TE>
<TE>   But on Monday, "their mood was positive, upbeat, and they're glad
things seem to be turning around," Grover said. "They're saying it's
about time."</TE>
<TE>   Individual investors are definitely looking at the market with
renewed optimism in recent days, reported Charles Schwab &amp; Co., the
big discount brokerage house.</TE>
<TE>   "They're walking in with checks and starting to buy again," said
Schwab spokesman Morrison Shafroth after a spot check of several
branches. And at some of Schwab's telephone-ordering centers, calls
from investors Monday jumped about 50% from their daily levels in
mid-July, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Clients are feeling more confident about the direction of the
market," Shafroth said.</TE>

<HD>Davis' Parole Policy Raises Questions</HD>
<DH>Justice: The governor's reluctance to release killers is
prompting protests by legislators, convicts' families and judges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER WARREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some convicts go to prison and hang on to their criminal ways. Others
wallow in bitterness, counting their days of confinement. Then there
are the exceptions--inmates like David Ramos.</LD>
<LD>   Convicted of murder for giving a ride to a killer, Ramos has been
locked up for 21 years. It has not been wasted time. He has mastered
two trades, earned a college degree and, most exceptionally, taught
more than 1,000 prisoners to read.</LD>
<LD>   That record was enough for the state parole board. In January, its
members--a famously cautious group--congratulated Ramos and declared
him ready to go home.</LD>
<TE>   In most states, that would have been it. Ramos, 40, would have
packed his belongings and walked out the prison gate. But in
California, an unusual law gives the governor a say over his fate.
And Gov. Gray Davis said no.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling was not a surprise. Since taking office, Davis has
rejected freedom for 108 killers approved for release by his own
parole board--a record that makes him far less forgiving than his GOP
predecessor, Pete Wilson. Just two murderers have been released by
Davis, both of them battered women who had shot their abusers.</TE>
<TE>   That pattern has drawn praise from victims' advocates but also
criticism from legislators, inmates' families and a growing group of
judges. Two cases testing the extent of the governor's power over
parole await action by the state Supreme Court, perhaps as early as
this fall.</TE>
<TE>   California is one of only three states--along with Oklahoma and
Maryland--that give governors veto power over parole. Some say such
authority provides society an extra measure of protection. But many
national parole experts say granting this power to an elected
official is bad public policy, politicizing the task of deciding
which inmates are rehabilitated and should go free.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, as in California, governors in Oklahoma and Maryland have
taken rigid stances on parole. Oklahoma's Gov. Frank Keating even
vowed, like Davis, that during his tenure murderers "will not be
released. Period. Exclamation point."</TE>
<TE>   "It's inevitable," said Gail Hughes, executive director of the
Assn. of Paroling Authorities International. "If governors release a
murderer, they appear soft on crime and risk another Willie Horton
ruining their political future."</TE>
<TE>   Horton is the Massachusetts murderer who raped a woman while on a
weekend furlough allowed when Michael Dukakis was governor of the
state. In the 1988 presidential race, then-Vice President George Bush
used the Horton episode to bash Dukakis, contributing to the
Democrat's defeat.</TE>
<TE>   Other high-profile cases in California--including the kidnapping
and murder of a Petaluma 12-year-old, Polly Klaas, by a repeat
felon--underscored the Horton lesson for elected officials: You can't
be too tough.</TE>
<TE>   "No politician ever gets in trouble for not letting a prisoner
out," said Susan Estrich, who was Dukakis' presidential campaign
manager and now teaches law at USC. "The political risk is all in one
direction."</TE>
<TE>   The governor's deputy press secretary, Byron Tucker, said such
political perils have no bearing on the governor's parole decisions.
Despite Davis' 1999 vow that no murderer would go free on his watch,
the governor judges each inmate on the evidence, Tucker said.</TE>
<TE>   He added, however, that Davis evaluates eligible prisoners with
the feelings of crime victims foremost in his mind: "For them, there
is no parole from the loss of their loved ones," Tucker said.</TE>
<TE>   Paroles are handed down by the nine-member Board of Prison Terms,
appointed by the governor. Each year the board holds about 3,100
hearings for murderers, rapists and kidnappers who have served their
minimum terms and become eligible for parole. A much smaller number
of inmates convicted of more heinous killings are ineligible for
parole or on death row.</TE>
<TE>   Board members grant or deny parole on the basis of careful study
of the crime, the inmate's behavior while incarcerated and reports
from prison psychiatrists. The law suggests that parole must be
granted unless the review shows the prisoner remains dangerous, but
the board's discretion is broad and parole grants are rare. Today,
about 1% of those evaluated are cleared for release.</TE>
<TE>   California's governor was brought into this process through a 1988
ballot initiative, Proposition 89. The measure was pushed by former
Gov. George Deukmejian, a Republican angered by his inability to
prevent the release of a murderer and rapist named William Archie
Fain.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 89 passed with 55% of the vote, and its sponsor in the
Legislature, former Sen. Daniel Boatwright (D-Concord), said it has
protected Californians from the release of dangerous criminals.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Davis is doing exactly what the people want him to do,"
said Boatwright, now a lobbyist. "It's better to err on the side of
caution."</TE>
<TE>   Victims' rights advocates agree and say that, whether it's
politics or principles driving Davis, they applaud him: "A lot of us
who have been victims feel that, if you take a life, why is it OK for
you ever to walk the streets again?" said Maggie Elvey of Crime
Victims United.</TE>
<TE>   The initiative's chief opponent was a Roman Catholic priest and
inmate advocate named Paul Comiskey. He warned that the measure would
have "a chilling effect on anybody getting out." Comiskey, now a
criminal defense lawyer in Sacramento, believes that prediction has
been borne out, noting that paroles dwindled under Wilson before
Davis shut the cell door almost entirely.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor picks his appointees for the parole board, and yet,
even in the rare cases when they find someone suitable for release,
he vetoes it," Comiskey said. "If that's not politics, what is?"</TE>
<TE>   Wilson was the first California governor to use the new veto
power. A Republican who signed laws that toughened criminal
sentencing, Wilson was no softie when it came to parole. But in his
last three years in office, he allowed 25 murder convicts to go free
under Proposition 89.</TE>
<TE>   "We looked at these cases very carefully, because a life was taken
and you can't take that lightly," Wilson said in an interview. "I was
very tough. But there were cases where people did not represent a
threat and showed true remorse."</TE>
<TE>   Those who know David Ramos believe he fits that description. They
say it is hard to imagine an inmate who has better fulfilled the
goals of the penal system: punishment, atonement and preparation for
life on the outside.</TE>
<TE>   Though he was convicted of murder, his role had been driving the
killer to the crime scene, not wielding a weapon. And though Ramos
says he is remorseful and takes full responsibility for the victim's
death, his public defender blames himself for the conviction, saying
he bungled the case.</TE>
<TE>   "I have been haunted by this, and will continue to be until we get
a governor who is not a moral coward and will do the right thing,"
said attorney Bernard J. Rosen, now in private practice in Santa
Monica. "David's life has just been thrown away. And yet he's managed
to stay positive and do amazing things in prison."</TE>
<TE>   The murder took place in March 1981, taking the life of a retired
Coast Guard chief named Febrillium Ponce. Ponce's wife, Joan, had
hired Thomas Gomez to murder her spouse for $10,000, court documents
say. Gomez, 19, shot Ponce in the parking lot at Harbor College in
Wilmington.</TE>
<TE>   Ramos was 19, had no criminal record, was attending night school
and had just enlisted in the Army. Prosecutors labeled him a
co-conspirator, saying he had given Gomez, his brother-in-law, a ride
to the scene of the crime, and stood to collect $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   Joan Ponce did not implicate Ramos when she confessed, and her
daughter testified that Ramos had sat with her watching TV while the
other two plotted the crime in another room of their home. A judge
initially dismissed the case against him, citing insufficient
evidence. Prosecutors refiled charges, and the case went to trial.</TE>
<TE>   Rosen said he made "every mistake in the book" defending Ramos.
Like Ponce and Gomez, Ramos was found guilty of first-degree murder.
The sentence: 26 years to life.</TE>
<TE>   At his parole hearing in January, Ramos said he had overheard
Gomez and Ponce talk of the killing, but never thought they were
serious. He said he believed Gomez planned to use a gun to scare
Ponce because Ponce had been beating his wife.</TE>
<TE>   At the January parole hearing, prosecutors said Ramos should serve
more time. But Los Angeles Police Det. Larry Kallestad, who
investigated the case, believes Ramos deserves parole, calling him
"an immature teenager who believed he was playing a game."</TE>
<TE>   Ramos, however, made no excuses. "I take full responsibility for
my actions," he told the board. "I am in no way trying to hide or
diminish my role in any way."</TE>
<TE>   The hearing outlined Ramos' near-perfect prison record, marred
only by a 1990 fight in which he was attacked by a mentally ill
inmate. He receives exceptional reviews from correctional counselors
and psychiatrists, and was praised as a hero by prison authorities
for rescuing a supervisor who had fallen into an excavation hole.</TE>
<TE>   Most unusual, however, has been Ramos' work teaching illiterate
inmates to read.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997 he was named tutor of the year by the group California
Literacy, chosen not just from among the few prisoners who teach
reading, but from among 13,000 Californians who donate time to the
cause. "This is someone whose dedication truly stood out," the
selection panel said.</TE>
<TE>   The January parole hearing was the fourth for Ramos, and the
chairman was a hard-liner, Tom Bordonaro. A former Republican
assemblyman from Paso Robles, Bordonaro wrote a law that toughened
sentences for criminals who use guns. He also has experienced
violence in his own life; his sister was shot and killed by a drug
dealer.</TE>
<TE>   But he and a deputy parole commissioner, meeting to review the
case, decided that Ramos had excelled in prison and deserved to be
freed. "Congratulations," he told the inmate. "Just keep doing what
you're doing and ... hopefully, it will stick."</TE>
<TE>   For five months, the parole grant did stick, surviving the board's
administrative review. Then it landed on the governor's desk. On June
21, Davis rendered his verdict. Though praising Ramos'
accomplishments behind bars, Davis concluded the inmate had
"participated in a grave crime" and had "actually regressed" by
expressing a "denial of culpability."</TE>
<TE>   "I believe Mr. Ramos remains a danger to public safety at this
time," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   In a telephone interview from Avenal State Prison, Ramos said he
had expected the governor to block his release. Though his large
extended family in Los Angeles has been devastated by the news, he is
taking it well, hoping that action by the state Supreme Court may
ultimately lead to freedom.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys in here are pretty upset, because they figure if
somebody like me can't get out, then they certainly won't get out,"
Ramos said. "But hope springs eternal."</TE>

<LD>   Next came Jennifer Wright, mother of three, strangled in her
bedroom.</LD>
<LD>   Then Andrea Floyd, silenced the same day she asked for a divorce.</LD>
<TE>   Then came Marilyn Griffin, who was stabbed 50 times and set on
fire.</TE>
<TE>   A string of wife killings, four in six weeks, all allegedly
involving U.S. soldiers stationed at Ft. Bragg, has sent the Army's
top brass on a distressing search for what went wrong.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, commanders said the deaths had nothing to do with the
line of work--three of the four suspects are Special Forces soldiers
recently back from Afghanistan. They also said the men didn't know
one another.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no linkage we could find," said Col. Tad Davis, garrison
commander at Ft. Bragg, who called the killings "an unexpected
sequence of events."</TE>
<TE>   But local authorities said all the cases came with warnings.</TE>
<TE>   "Each of these couples were having serious friction," said Lt.
James E. Black of the Cumberland County sheriff's office. "There were
definite signs."</TE>
<TE>   A high-ranking army chaplain now fears there could be a
"contagion" at the country's largest Army base, home to 45,000
soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been in this business for more than 20 years and never seen
anything like this," said Lt. Col. Glen Bloomsprom, head of the
Army's family ministry office. "Maybe one of these guys heard about a
murder and that put the idea in his head. You see that a lot with
suicides."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the cause, the toll is steep: four Army wives dead, two
highly trained soldiers lost to suicide, two others in jail and nine
children without parents.</TE>
<TE>   Army officials say the deaths are leading them to reexamine their
domestic violence programs, which have been expanded in recent years.
Already there is a host of services, from couple counseling to
confidential chaplain visits to upbeat, we're-not-here-to-blame
therapy sessions called "marriage enrichment seminars."</TE>
<TE>   "There's so much support here," said one officer's wife who asked
not to be quoted by name. "That's why this is shocking. These women
must have felt so alone."</TE>
<TE>   The vast Ft. Bragg military installation, located in central North
Carolina, has three gas stations, nine schools, 308 miles of paved
road and 55,000 personnel, including civilians. It's the heart of a
larger military community that includes thousands of Army families
and retirees, surplus stores, gun shops and fluttering flags just
about everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Few people had paid attention to the rash of killings until the
Fayetteville Observer published a story Friday pointing out that all
had allegedly been carried out by local soldiers. That drew the
attention of the national media--and Pentagon generals.</TE>
<TE>   "Undoubtedly, it's raised command's interest," said Bloomsprom,
the high-ranking chaplain. "All of us are extremely sad because we
could have prevented this."</TE>
<TE>   The incidents began on June 11, police said, when Sgt. 1st Class
Rigoberto Nieves, a solider in the 3rd Special Forces Group, shot his
wife in the head with a .40-caliber pistol and then fatally shot
himself. They had been arguing all night, neighbors said. Nieves had
just returned from Afghanistan two days before. He had asked to come
back early to "resolve" personal issues, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks later, Jennifer Wright vanished. Her husband, William, a
wiry master sergeant in the 96th Civil Affairs Battalion, said he had
no idea what happened. He returned from a stint in Afghanistan in
May.</TE>
<TE>   On July 19, Wright confessed to strangling his wife and burying
her on the base near a firing range, police said. The two had been
married 14 years, with three children, though Wright had moved out
and was living in the barracks.</TE>
<TE>   That same day Sgt. 1st-Class Brandon Floyd, a member of the elite,
top-secret Delta Force, shot his wife in the head during an argument.
Then he turned the gun on himself. Andrea Floyd had asked for a
divorce shortly before the killing, said Black.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon Floyd was a triathlete and a football star, "one of those
all-American types with everything going for him," Black said. He had
returned from Afghanistan earlier this spring.</TE>
<TE>   Floyd was set to be buried in Arlington National Cemetery until
the secretary of the Army postponed the funeral on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth Ft. Bragg killing, which did not involve a Special
Forces soldier, occurred on July 9. Police said Sgt. Cedric Ramon
Griffin of the 37th Engineer Battalion stabbed his estranged wife 50
times, then set her body on fire. Griffin lived with another woman,
who was pregnant, and he and his wife had a long history of marital
problems, police said. He confessed after he was arrested, police
said.</TE>
<TE>   Studies have shown that military couples have a higher rate of
domestic abuse, sometimes two to five times that of the general
population. But military officials and Special Forces veterans doubt
that it was work that drove the men to allegedly kill their wives.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think our jobs create unique problems that would make
someone do this," said retired Air Force Col. John Carney, head of a
Special Operations college scholarship fund. " ... There's more
stress for all of us these days."</TE>
<TE>   Black, who has thick folders on his desk detailing the murder
cases, said: "These soldiers left with problems and they came back
with problems. Marital issues don't disappear just because you go off
to Afghanistan."</TE>

<HD>Officials Blame Lettuce in E. Coli Outbreak</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Contaminated lettuce apparently caused an E. coli outbreak that
sickened at least 29 people in Washington state, federal health
officials said in warning consumers nationwide to avoid romaine
lettuce packed by Spokane Produce.</LD>
<LD>   The problem: The lettuce was sold under several different brand
names, and the Food and Drug Administration doesn't have a complete
list and isn't sure whether other states received shipments, said FDA
acting commissioner Lester Crawford.</LD>
<LD>   The FDA urged all consumers to throw away 5-pound bags of "Romaine
Toss" sold by Spokane Produce, and to ask grocery store produce
managers whether smaller packages of romaine came from that company.</LD>
<TE>   The unusual consumer warning followed an episode at a Washington
cheerleading camp in which 29 people became sick with E. coli,
including a teenager whose kidneys were so damaged that she is on
dialysis, the FDA said.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors are investigating 16 more people who didn't attend the
camp but may have E. coli linked to the lettuce, Crawford said.</TE>

said they were disappointed they hadn't been contacted by the mining
company that sent them underground.</LD>

<LD>Firefighters went door-to-door deciding which homes they could save,
and residents packed up photo albums and other important materials as
an explosive wildfire led to evacuation warnings for 17,000 people in
southwestern Oregon.</LD>

Siskiyou National Forest.</LD>
<LD>   The fire continued to push south on a course to link up with the

<LD>A Massachusetts teacher who asked her pupils to bring a book to class
about their Christmas traditions violated a student's rights when she
stopped her from reading a passage on the birth of Jesus Christ
because it was religious, according to a federal lawsuit.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit accuses the Leominster Public School District and some
of its officials of violating 7-year-old Laura Greska's right to free
speech and her exercise of religion, according to a complaint filed
by the American Center for Law and Justice.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit contends the second-grader's teacher told students to
bring a book to class about their Christmas traditions. The teacher,
however, stopped Laura Greska from reading "The First Christmas," a
book that details the birth of Jesus, the lawsuit claims.</LD>

<HD>Bush Assails Welfare Plan</HD>
<DH>Politics: The president calls the Senate reform measure a
'retreat from success.' He wants tougher employment rules for
recipients.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHARLESTON, S.C.</DL>
<LD>President Bush insisted on tougher work requirements for welfare
recipients Monday, denouncing the Senate Democrats' welfare reform
bill as "a retreat from success" riddled with "loopholes."</LD>
<LD>   Bush all but threatened to veto that bill, which the Senate
Finance Committee approved last month.</LD>
<LD>   His remarks set the stage for a potential end-of-session showdown
with a looming deadline for Congress to extend the landmark 1996 law,
which ended lifetime entitlements to welfare benefits. The current
legislation expires Sept. 30.</LD>
<TE>   The Republican House reauthorized the 1996 law in May, imposing
stiffer work requirements for welfare recipients and providing more
money to support programs that promote marriage.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush's uncompromising tone here toward the Senate Democrats'
alternative highlighted the chasm between the two parties on how to
further reform the nation's $16.5-billion welfare program.</TE>
<TE>   While Republicans are declaring the 1996 reforms a resounding
success and are clamoring for more stringent rules, many Democrats
want to soften some of the policies that President Clinton signed
into law six years ago. The Senate bill, for instance, would provide
billions of dollars more for child care than the House version.</TE>
<TE>   Because of such differences, it is not certain that Congress will
be able to pass a new welfare bill. If an impasse arises, lawmakers
probably would extend current policies until they are able to agree
on a plan.</TE>
<TE>   The welfare speech was part of a weeklong campaign by the
president to prod the Senate into passing some of his pet bills,
including legislation granting him greater freedom to negotiate trade
pacts.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Bush will sign a corporate responsibility reform bill,
which contains some tough measures against dishonest business
executives that he initially had resisted. But given the public
outrage over the rash of corporate accounting scandals, Bush was not
about to veto such a popular bill.</TE>
<TE>   "Tomorrow, I'm signing a good bill," Bush announced here, adding
that its message to corporate executives is clear: "If you're a CEO
and you think you can fudge the books in order to make yourself look
better, we're going to find you, we're going to arrest you and we're
going to hold you to account."</TE>
<TE>   On welfare reform, Bush backs the House bill, which would require
recipients to work 40 hours a week. At least 24 hours a week would
have to be spent in actual employment; the remaining 16 hours could
be used for education, job training and a variety of family
activities.</TE>
<TE>   Under the current law, 30 hours of work are required, but even
that requirement's reach is limited.</TE>
<TE>   Bush called the Senate bill "a retreat from the success" and said
it would "hurt the very people we're trying to help," in part because
it contains "so many work exceptions that it will result in many
fewer welfare recipients moving from welfare to work."</TE>
<TE>   For instance, he said, the Democratic bill would allow recipients
to meet work requirements even if they spent "their entire five years
... on welfare going to college."</TE>
<TE>   Bush also expressed his unhappiness over the bill's allocation of
only one-third of the $300 million that he sought for programs that
promote marriage.</TE>
<TE>   "That doesn't make sense to me," Bush fumed. "As a matter of fact,
some of the money that they believe ought to be spent on so-called
family building will go to programs that have nothing to do with
promoting marriage."</TE>
<TE>   Bush insisted that the 1996 legislation was "a true success
story," even though many social activists have criticized it for
being unnecessarily harsh, especially on women and children.</TE>
<TE>   The president said that as a result of the reforms, 5.4 million
fewer Americans are living in poverty, including 2.8 million fewer
children.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Siegel, spokesman for Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), who is
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, disputed Bush's criticism
of the panel's bill.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a bipartisan bill that includes a broad range of ideas
supported by Senate members of the president's own party," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Following his remarks before several thousand people at West
Ashley High School, Bush attended a fund-raiser for Mark Sanford, a
former congressman who is running for governor against incumbent Jim
Hodges, a Democrat, in what is expected to be a close contest.</TE>
<TE>   The event raised $1 million for Sanford's campaign and $200,000
for the state Republican Party.</TE>

come in for a drubbing by potential presidential candidates. Gore not
at conference.</DH>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A parade of potential Democratic presidential candidates Monday
faulted the Bush administration's handling of the economy, seeing it
as an opportunity for the party's success in November's congressional
elections and the 2004 race for the White House.</LD>
<LD>   One by one, Sens. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, Joseph I. Lieberman
of Connecticut and John F. Kerry of Massachusetts picked apart
President Bush's response to the corporate accounting scandals that
have roiled Wall Street and sent shivers through the voting
public--70% of whom own stock, according to the most recent surveys.</LD>
<LD>   But perhaps the strongest criticism, and certainly the critique
presented with the most passion, was leveled by a Democrat currently
considered a possible presidential candidate at some point after the
2004 campaign: Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York.</LD>
<TE>   "This administration is all blame and no game plan," she said in a
crowd-pleasing 40-minute attack. "They don't come up with new ideas;
they just come up with new P.R."</TE>
<TE>   She and the others spoke to the Democratic Leadership Council, a
centrist group holding an annual conference that attracted 700
people, roughly half of them elected officials.</TE>
<TE>   Missing was Al Gore, who served as vice president under Clinton's
husband and narrowly lost his bid to succeed him in the 2000 race.
Gore, who is mulling another presidential run in 2004, cited a
scheduling conflict--a pressing deadline for finishing a book due out
in November. He and many of the same group spoke to a Democratic
audience in Florida in April.</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic Leadership Council is well-known within the party,
but little-known outside it. While the council does not control
significant organizational or financial resources, it has played an
important role in providing candidates a platform for their ideas and
in promoting centrist credentials. Bill Clinton's successful race to
the Democratic presidential nomination effectively began in a May
1991 speech to a council convention where he sketched out what became
his "third way" agenda.</TE>
<TE>   The group strongly supported Gore as he defeated former Sen. Bill
Bradley (D-N.J.) for the 2000 nomination. But Gore's embrace of a
more liberal message in the general election campaign alienated most
council members, and most of its leaders are cool toward a second
Gore candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   Privately, many would prefer that Lieberman, Gore's 2000 running
mate, seek the nomination. But with Lieberman's status uncertain, the
group currently resembles a jockey without a mount.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman previously said he would not run if Gore does. But
lately, he has seemed to give himself some wiggle room on that
pledge. He has said he would hope Gore would decide by the end of the
year, suggesting he might go ahead and declare his candidacy if Gore
hasn't.</TE>
<TE>   At the leadership council gathering, he also took steps to
distance himself from Gore. He said in interviews that he believed
Gore made a mistake with his populist rhetoric during the 2000
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hopeful that Al will not run that kind of campaign" if he
seeks the nomination again, Lieberman said on CNN on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The leadership council meeting took place as leading
Democrats--after holding much of their political fire for months
after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks--have begun to more freely
criticize on an array of issues. Indeed, Kerry, a decorated veteran
of the Vietnam War, devoted most of his address to a sharp critique
of Bush's handling of the anti-terrorism campaign, and he encouraged
his fellow Democrats not to shy from discussing the performance of
the commander-in-chief.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the gyrations of the stock market, fueled by one report
after another of corporate accounting misdeeds, have given Democrats
new ammunition to aim at Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   "When it comes to the economy, and the current crisis in
confidence, the president and his Republican friends in Congress have
responded with timidity instead of toughness, with obsolete ideas and
outdated ideologies, and with special favors for special interests,"
Lieberman said.</TE>
<TE>   He added: "This administration has no growth strategy, except
their one-note plan that could fit on the back of a shampoo bottle:
'Cut taxes, increase spending, borrow. Repeat.' "</TE>
<TE>   Daschle and Kerry sounded similar notes.</TE>
<TE>   "The economy is in trouble, and there is no economic leadership
coming from the White House today," Daschle said. "We are the ones
providing true economic leadership."</TE>
<TE>   Kerry focused on the return of a federal budget deficit after
surpluses had marked the last years of Clinton's White House tenure.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has blamed the deficits on an economic recession that began
in early 2001, the economic effect of the Sept. 11 attacks and the
costs of the war in Afghanistan and the anti-terrorism campaign. But
Democrats put much of the blame on the $1.35-trillion, 10-year tax
cut that Bush pushed through Congress in the spring of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "In the span of a year, this administration has turned fiscal
responsibility on its ear," Kerry said, adding, "They have no
domestic agenda besides a tax cut."</TE>
<TE>   Scheduled to speak to the leadership council convention today are
two other prominently mentioned contenders for the 2004 Democratic
nomination next: House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt of
Missouri and Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina.</TE>

<HD>Drug Benefit Stuck in Senate</HD>
<DH>Medicare: Democrats, hoping to fulfill a key campaign
promise and end an impasse, offer a slimmed-down bill that includes
means testing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Senate has reached a make-or-break stage in its debate on
providing a prescription drug benefit under Medicare, as Democrats
pushed Monday to build support for a stripped-down plan that could
rescue the issue from legislative oblivion.</LD>
<LD>   A compromise that would target benefits to the poor and those with
high drug costs has won support from key Democratic
lawmakers--including Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota. The proposal
represents a retreat from Democrats' traditional insistence on making
Medicare benefits universally available--a significant concession
aimed at attracting GOP support.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal is estimated to cost about $395 billion over 10
years.</LD>
<TE>   But leading GOP senators immediately criticized the plan as too
little coverage for too much money. And proponents of the last-ditch
compromise conceded they had not yet secured enough votes to pass the
measure, which may be put to the test as early as today. If it fails
and no other alternative emerges in the next day or so, the Senate's
long and much-ballyhooed debate on prescription drug relief is likely
to collapse with no bill enacted.</TE>
<TE>   Under Senate rules, a 60-vote majority is needed to pass any
prescription drug bill. Last week, a $594-billion, seven-year
Democratic plan to provide benefits through Medicare garnered only 52
votes; a $370-billion, 10-year Republican plan that would provide
benefits through private insurers drew only 48 votes.</TE>
<TE>   In the week since those votes, lawmakers have become increasingly
concerned about political fallout if they come up empty-handed on an
issue that both parties have made a staple on the campaign trail for
years.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Democrats are especially worried about failing to deliver
on one of their top priorities because the GOP-controlled House
managed to pass a prescription drug bill--albeit one Democrats
consider inadequate.</TE>
<TE>   The House bill would provide about $310 billion for drug coverage
over 10 years. The new drug benefit would be provided not through
Medicare but through subsidies to private insurers that offer
benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Although there may be growing political will to compromise, the
philosophical differences over how to deliver the benefits are hard
to bridge, and potential costs are high. The search for alternatives
keeps bumping up against the same obstacles: Democrats are wary of
supporting any bill that scales back coverage too far or relies on
private insurers; Republicans are wary of spending too much.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is expected to come to a head today or Wednesday because
Daschle has said he wants to finish the debate so the Senate can move
onto other matters before it adjourns for its summer recess on
Friday. Barring a breakthrough on some other front, Daschle is
expected to push for a vote on the new compromise.</TE>
<TE>   Backed by Sens. Bob Graham (D-Fla.) and Gordon Smith (R-Ore.), the
plan would provide complete drug coverage only for Medicare
beneficiaries with annual incomes that do not exceed 200% of the
poverty line ($23,880 a year for couples).</TE>
<TE>   More-affluent Medicare beneficiaries would qualify for full drug
coverage only after their annual out-of-pocket drug expenses exceeded
$3,300. Those who don't fall under the low-income or "catastrophic"
coverage would get relief through a discount card, which could save
them 20% or more on prescription drugs.</TE>
<TE>   The focus on low-income elderly is a departure for Democrats. They
traditionally oppose any form of means testing in Medicare, fearing
it would stigmatize the program as a form of welfare.</TE>
<TE>   But last week's debate demonstrated that Democrats could not win
passage of a universal benefit under Medicare, and many have
concluded that half a loaf would be better than none.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a significant down-payment which will help millions of
senior citizens who need help the most, and protect all senior
citizens against catastrophic drug costs," Kennedy said.</TE>
<TE>   The result is an ironic policy twist: Democrats are supporting an
alternative that would provide full benefits to fewer people than the
defeated Republican alternative. Proponents of the GOP plan, which
would make all Medicare beneficiaries eligible for drug coverage but
provide the benefits through private insurers, derided Graham's
alternative, saying it would provide inadequate coverage for more
money.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) called it "a pig with lipstick."</TE>
<TE>   "It's really a cop-out," said Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine).
"There is no reason to abandon comprehensive coverage."</TE>
<TE>   But Democrats resist the GOP alternative's private-sector delivery
system because they fear that insurance companies will not reliably
provide coverage to people in rural states and other less-profitable
regions. And they fear it is the first step toward a broader GOP
effort to privatize Medicare.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of the Graham-Smith alternative say they hope to draw
support from some Republicans facing reelection. But it was a big
blow when Snowe and other centrist Republicans came out against the
bill Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to get this if you don't have someone like Snowe," said
a senior Democratic strategist. "The Republicans are dug in."</TE>
<TE>   According to Families USA, an organization favoring a drug
benefit, the average annual cost of prescriptions for seniors more
than doubled from 1992 to 2000, from $558 to $1,211.</TE>
<TE>   Prescription drugs are not covered by Medicare, the federal health
insurance program for senior citizens and the disabled, in part
because they were not as big a part of health care in 1965 as they
are now--especially in the treatment of chronic diseases.</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Chooses Lawyer to Run City's Schools</HD>
<DH>Education: At the Justice Department, Joel Klein led the
effort to break up Microsoft. Now he will head a troubled system with
a million students.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg on Monday named Joel Klein--the
former Justice Department prosecutor who led the legal battle to
break up Microsoft Corp.--as chancellor of the nation's largest
public school system.</LD>
<LD>   Klein, who ran the Justice Department's antitrust division for
nearly four years but has limited education credentials, will begin
overseeing the city's troubled public schools and its 1.1 million
students within several weeks.</LD>
<LD>   His appointment continues a trend of big cities appointing
non-educators to run public school systems. In recent years, Chicago
hired Paul Vallas, the city's budget chief; former Colorado Gov. Roy
Romer was chosen to head the Los Angeles Unified School District; San
Diego picked former U.S. Atty. Alan Bersin; and, before Klein, New
York had turned to Harold Levy, a former Wall Street banker.</LD>
<TE>   Critics said it isn't yet clear that noneducators can overcome the
deep-seated problems of illiteracy, eroding discipline and shrinking
budgets in public school systems. Bloomberg and others, however, say
public schools need the managerial savvy and no-nonsense approach of
business experts.</TE>
<TE>   "We think this trend, of hiring nontraditionals to run school
districts, is a very good idea," said Dan Katzir, managing director
of the Broad Foundation in Los Angeles, which has a national program
that trains future school superintendents. "Many of the nation's
largest school districts have annual budgets that approach those of
Fortune 500 companies, and they deserve the same kind of high-level
managerial skills."</TE>
<TE>   Most observers here reserved judgment. "Hopefully this very
nontraditional choice will help us make the New York schools the best
in the country. We'll have to wait and see," said Randi Weingarten,
president of the United Federation of Teachers.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference at Tweed Courthouse in lower Manhattan, the
new home for the city's school administration, Bloomberg predicted
Klein's appointment would be a turning point in efforts to better
manage the city school system's $12-billion annual budget. "We need
somebody with intelligence, we need somebody that is innovative, we
need somebody with impeccable integrity, we need somebody with
management skills," he said. "We have found exactly that person in
Joel Klein."</TE>
<TE>   Anticipating questions about Klein's education experience--which
consists of a brief stint as a New York public school math
teacher--Bloomberg added: "The real issue is, can he manage people?
He managed six or seven hundred lawyers. That's probably like herding
cats, and if he can do that, he can certainly do this."</TE>
<TE>   The surprise announcement ended a difficult search process for
Bloomberg, who recently won near-total control of the public schools
in a hard-fought battle with the teachers union, community groups and
the state Legislature. To his obvious surprise, he was turned down by
several prominent candidates for chancellor in recent weeks. Klein, a
55-year-old native New Yorker who attended public schools in Queens
and Brooklyn, was not thought to be at the top of the mayor's list.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, a search team had screened more than a dozen people,
including Vallas, who took a rival offer to run the Philadelphia
school district. Bloomberg's deputies also interviewed Stanley
Brezenoff, a former official in Mayor Edward I. Koch's
administration; Vincent Grippo, a local school superintendent from
Brooklyn; and Cleveland schools chief Barbara Byrd-Bennett.</TE>
<TE>   Klein, whose children attended private schools, said he was up to
the challenge of revitalizing a school system that is plagued by an
exodus of experienced teachers, plunging test scores and huge budget
cutbacks. He grew up in a public housing project in Queens, before
attending Columbia University and Harvard Law School. After leaving
the Justice Department, he most recently headed the U.S. operations
of Bertelsmann AG, the German media conglomerate.</TE>
<TE>   "I pledge to do all that I can to give each child in the city of
New York a first-rate education and the keys to unlock what this
magnificent world has to offer," he said. "I know personally what it
is like to look into the eyes of an infant and be filled with hopes
and dreams. So I want to commit today to all the parents of New York
City that I will be your special ally."</TE>
<TE>   Klein's chances of doing that may have been increased by
Bloomberg's victorious battle to gain control over--and
accountability for--public schools, something none of his mayoral
predecessors have been able to do for 30 years. On July 1, the state
Legislature approved a major restructuring that gave him
unprecedented power to determine public school budgets and also
eliminated the politically powerful Board of Education. Under the new
plan, Bloomberg appoints eight of the 13 members of a Panel for
Educational Policy, who serve him in an advisory capacity.</TE>
<TE>   Levy, who was appointed chancellor in 2000, during former Mayor
Rudolph W. Giuliani's last term, had similar ambitions to bring a
more businesslike perspective to a bureaucracy widely seen as bloated
and inefficient. But he had only limited success because Giuliani was
never able to win control of the city's school system, according to
longtime observers of the city's education system.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg has long said the chancellor's job requires a person
with superb managerial skills and great personal integrity, both of
which he said Klein displays.</TE>
<TE>   "He is absolutely incorruptible," the mayor said of Klein, who as
deputy attorney general in the Clinton administration from 1996 to
2000 blocked or altered 170 mergers. In 220 price-fixing cases he
prosecuted, 52 executives were sent to prison, corporations paid $1.7
billion in fines and individuals paid $21 billion in fines.</TE>
<TE>   Because he has no professional background in education, Klein's
appointment will take effect only when a waiver is granted. But
Bloomberg said that hurdle was a formality: "If the scholarship and
background requirements that Joel Klein has doesn't pass," he said,
"nobody would pass."</TE>

<HD>Passenger Train Cars Plunge Off Overheated Tracks</HD>
<DH>Accident: Ninety-seven people are injured, six seriously,
as the Chicago-to-Washington Amtrak Superliner derails in Maryland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHEN BRAUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KENSINGTON, Md.</DL>
<LD>An Amtrak Superliner train approaching Washington from Chicago
tumbled off heat-seared rails Monday, some cars plunging down an
embankment and injuring 97 passengers, six of them seriously.</LD>
<LD>   Many of the 164 passengers on the Capitol Limited left the crushed
train cars on their own, some limping with cuts and bruises, dragging
bags under a wilting sun. Rescue teams and passersby descended on the
toppled cars to aid others caught inside, using ladders and bare
hands to free those left immobilized.</LD>
<LD>   "It was so loud, you could hear the ground vibrate," said Kermit
Tyler, a neighbor who watched the engines clear the curving track,
then lurch to a halt as 11 rail cars trailing behind slid down a
shallow hill in a spray of gravel. Tyler ran to one capsized
double-decker car, helped a young girl out of a shattered window and
carried her to police just arriving on the scene. The girl suffered
only minor injuries, Tyler said.</LD>
<TE>   Rail and safety officials said late Monday that they were focusing
on the possibility that the curved rails might have been weakened by
the 97-degree heat. A train engineer reportedly radioed concerns
about heat stress on the track just before the accident, but an
Amtrak official could not confirm that.</TE>
<TE>   Other officials said the engineer had tried to slow the train to
avoid a derailment seconds before the accident. Tyler, who witnessed
the wreck, said he heard the unmistakable sound of brakes squealing
before the rail cars lurched over the tracks.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just like the sound you hear before a car crash, only
louder," Tyler said. He said he watched in amazement as two of the
cars tumbled over "like toy trains," shearing away a stand of trees
and wedging in the tall grass.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board
examined the engine and downed cars Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   They are not expected to reach a conclusion for weeks, but Joe
McHugh, vice president of public affairs with Amtrak, said he was
optimistic that "we'll get a fairly quick read on what happened."</TE>
<TE>   One official said the circumstances of the Kensington derailment
were similar to an Amtrak derailment that killed four people and
injured more than 150 passengers on April 18 at Crescent City, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   In both accidents, the official said, the Amtrak engines and
baggage cars passed over the rails easily, but the cars trailing them
careened over the side.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators quickly blamed the Crescent City derailment on a
heat-stressed track, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz said that tracks affected by "sun
kinks" are blamed for dozens of minor train derailments that occur
during summer months or in warmer climates of the country.</TE>
<TE>   "That's one of the things rail line owners are supposed to take
into account when they lay track," Lopatkiewicz said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for CSX Inc., the freight rail line company that owns
the track used by the Amtrak train, said Monday that the bend in the
rail line was checked by inspectors for heat damage the day before
the accident.</TE>
<TE>   There was no evidence of weakening at that point, spokesman Dan
Murphy said. "We have heard speculation" about the heat stress
report," Murphy said. "Right now, it's just one of the pieces of the
puzzle."</TE>
<TE>   Murphy added that a 90-car freight train laden with nearly 900
tons of cargo had passed over the same track earlier in the day
without incident. And the Amtrak train did not appear to be speeding,
Murphy said, passing at about 60 mph over a curve with a speed limit
of 70.</TE>
<TE>   The Capitol Limited was traveling south in Montgomery County, Md.,
about three miles outside the District of Columbia, Amtrak officials
said, when it derailed about 1:55 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Colburn, 37, the owner of a discount tire store, said he
heard several loud booms, sounding "like a dump truck losing its
load."</TE>
<TE>   Although the engine stayed on the tracks, Montgomery County safety
officials said 5,000 gallons of fuel oil gushed into the grass around
the wreck, probably caused by shearing metal. A hazardous materials
team cordoned off the spill, but officials said it did not pose a
health threat.</TE>
<TE>   Three cars tumbled precariously near a row of houses. One
passenger told rescuers that in one of the heavily damaged cars, she
saw an elderly woman sail through the air and collide with another
passenger.</TE>
<TE>   Bruised and scraped, Robert Bailey, a Capitol Heights, Md.,
passenger, said he had to crawl out from a rail car that ended up
with its roof buried. Passengers in his car were "screaming and
hollering," Bailey said.</TE>
<TE>   "The trains started to lurch and started to fall off the track. We
landed on our side," said Paula Kolokowski, who had to flee a
sleeping car with her 13-year-old daughter. After one passenger
kicked out the window, the Kolokowskis climbed out the side of car
and shimmied to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   In another car that shuddered to a stop closer to the track,
passengers were "actually pretty calm," said New Yorker Sean Hill.
People were frightened, he said, but "there weren't that many serious
injuries I could see."</TE>
<TE>   Four of the most seriously injured passengers were taken by
ambulance to Suburban Hospital. A nursing official there said two
patients, an 81-year-old North Carolina woman and a 71-year-old
woman, were in serious condition with unspecified injuries. Two other
passengers complaining of chest pains were also admitted for
observation.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank God we had no fatalities," said Robert Allwang, operations
chief for the county's fire and rescue services.</TE>

<HD>Man Charged in Vigilante-Type Shooting at Boys in Baltimore</HD>
<DH>Crime: The defendant allegedly was upset at the three
selling drugs on his front steps. Judge cites prior conviction in
denying bail.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>A man charged in a vigilante-style shooting for allegedly opening
fire on three boys believed to be selling drugs was denied bail
Monday by the same judge who prosecuted him on a manslaughter
conviction in the 1970s.</LD>
<LD>   During a hearing, District Judge H. Gary Bass told defendant
Williams Banks, 60, that although his prior conviction was
inadmissible, it was enough reason to deny him bail. Bass wouldn't
discuss details of the former case.</LD>
<LD>   Police said Banks returned home Sunday to find three boys--ages
11, 15 and 18--selling drugs on his front steps.</LD>
<TE>   When Banks asked them to move, the boys became irate, yelling
insults, said police spokeswoman Sheri Albrecht. Banks went inside
his home, came out with a .38-caliber handgun and started shooting,
Albrecht said.</TE>
<TE>   Banks called police after the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   He gave them his gun when they arrived and told them he was tired
and just wanted the boys to get off his steps, according to a police
report.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors said Banks and the three youths had run-ins before.</TE>
<TE>   Police identified the three as Dominique Byrd, 11; William James,
15, and Berry Bolling, 18.</TE>
<TE>   Byrd was released Sunday from the hospital and Bolling on Monday.
James remained hospitalized in good condition Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Bolling had been convicted last month on charges of drug
possession.</TE>

<HD>Beached Whales Returned to Ocean</HD>
<DH>Environment: Thanks to volunteers, 46 of the 55 mammals are
successfully rescued. They are likely to return to Cape Cod.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENNIS, Mass.</DL>
<LD>More than 50 pilot whales beached themselves here on Cape Cod on
Monday before hundreds of volunteers converged in a rescue effort
that returned 46 of them to open waters. But nine of the highly
social marine mammals died or had to be euthanized due to trauma or
injury.</LD>
<LD>   As rescuers tagged and measured two of the casualties on Chapin
Beach, Sallie K. Riggs, president of the National Marine Life Center
in nearby Buzzards Bay, called the event "a significant mass
stranding" as well as a successful recovery effort.</LD>
<LD>   "To get 46 animals back in the ocean is 46 success stories," said
Riggs, who noted there was "a high probability" that the whales would
return within 24 hours.</LD>
<TE>   The appearance of the 1- to 2-ton black sea mammals--which often
travel in groups of up to 100--marked the largest beaching of pilot
whales in at least a decade.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, when a dozen pilot whales stranded themselves on
Nantucket, the event was considered noteworthy, Riggs said. All the
whales in the Nantucket beaching died.</TE>
<TE>   Pilot whales take their name from their habit of following one or
two dominant members of their pod, said Tony LaCasse of the New
England Aquarium in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   "Commonly, the leaders are mature females," LaCasse said, "a good
matriarchy."</TE>
<TE>   If the leader takes a wrong turn, grows disoriented or becomes
ill, the entire pod follows for reasons marine scientists do not
fully understand. As the tide went out early Monday, the lead whales
directed the pod to a shallow, sandy beach at the elbow of Cape Cod.</TE>
<TE>   The sight was "absolutely amazing," said 42-year-old Bobby MacAri
of Canton, Mass., who was vacationing on the Cape. MacAri said he
went out for a pre-breakfast walk and saw "just a big, black pile" of
whales, "like something you have never seen before."</TE>
<TE>   Soon he joined about 400 other volunteers who had formed a bucket
brigade to keep the whales doused with saltwater. Many draped the
whales with wet towels or blankets; some used shovels to try to dig
the whales out from the thick sand where they were stuck.</TE>
<TE>   "It was unbelievable," said Brian Malone, a police officer who
also serves as a natural resources officer here. "People were
bringing wet sheets and all kinds of things to keep the whales cool."</TE>
<TE>   By midday, with the tide rising, volunteers were able to ease most
of the whales back into deep water.</TE>
<TE>   Some in the makeshift rescue crew were called up from the Cape Cod
Stranding Network, a group of volunteers trained to respond to mass
beachings, said Connie Merigo, head of the New England Aquarium's
rescue unit. Merigo said the rescuers paid careful heed to the large
cluster of toothed, predator mammals that feed largely on squid and
smaller fish.</TE>
<TE>   "The difficulty with these animals is that they are very dangerous
when they start to thrash," Merigo said. "When they thrash their
flukes [or tails], you are talking about a couple of tons of
momentum."</TE>
<TE>   Because they are accustomed to the buoyancy of the sea, the pilot
whales swiftly "become stressed and go into shock" when they surface
on dry land, Merigo said.</TE>
<TE>   Adult pilot whales can measure 15 to 25 feet in length. From
colonial days until the early 1900s, Cape Codders hunted these
mammals for the oil contained in their heads.</TE>
<TE>   "They actually drove them onto the beaches," LaCasse said.</TE>
<TE>   Some volunteers speculated Monday that a lightning storm may have
left the whales disoriented. Others suggested that the lead whale or
whales may have been ill.</TE>
<TE>   Katie Touhey, head of the Cape Cod Stranding Network, said she
hoped the beached whales would not return, as often happens.</TE>

<HD>Vinland Map Authenticity Questioned</HD>
<DH>Cartography: Parchment on N. American chart may be real,
but ink may be fraud, studies find.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two new studies released Monday provide contradictory evidence about
the authenticity of the controversial Vinland map, considered by some
to be the oldest map of North America.</LD>
<LD>   One study, conducted by researchers at the Smithsonian
Institution, shows that the parchment on which it is drawn is old
enough to be genuine. But the second study by British researchers
suggests that the ink is of modern origin.</LD>
<LD>   The Vinland map purportedly dates from about 1440--50 years before
Columbus discovered the New World--and accurately shows the North
American coastline around Hudson Bay and the Gulf of St. Lawrence. It
has long been claimed as proof that Scandinavian sailors Bjarni and
Leif Eriksson were the first Europeans to visit the New World.</LD>
<TE>   That claim has subsequently been upheld by the discovery of
pre-Columbian Norse settlements in the region, but the validity of
the map itself has been continually questioned--and many experts now
believe it to be a sophisticated forgery.</TE>
<TE>   The dating of the parchment provides the strongest evidence yet
that the map might be genuine, said Jaqueline S. Olin, who recently
retired from the Smithsonian Center for Materials Research and
Education. "It's nice now to know what the date of the parchment is,
and it raises questions about how a forger would have gotten access
to parchment" from the correct time period, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're pretty confident that the parchment is from the 15th
century," added retired physicist Douglas Donahue of the University
of Arizona. "That's the only conclusion we can really make from
this."</TE>
<TE>   Little is known about the history of the map before its purchase
by a New Haven antiquities dealer in the early 1950s. Financier Paul
A. Mellon purchased the map in 1958 for $1 million and donated it to
Yale University, where it now resides. Its value is currently
estimated to be about $24 million.</TE>
<TE>   Questions immediately arose about its authenticity, and Yale
commissioned noted chemist Walter C. McCrone, who died just last
week, to examine the document. Using a microscope, he concluded that
the ink contained a titanium dioxide mineral called anatase, which
was not used in ink before the 1920s. On the basis of this finding,
he labeled the map a forgery.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1990s, however, physicist Thomas Cahill of UC Davis
used newer techniques to study the ink and concluded that McCrone had
misidentified the mineral he saw under the microscope. Cahill and his
colleagues reported only trace amounts of anatase on the map, adding
they had found similar amounts on authentic documents from the same
period.</TE>
<TE>   In the first of the new studies, Olin received permission to cut
off a small fragment of the map parchment and subject it to
radiocarbon dating, which was performed by Donahue and chemist Garman
Harbottle of Brookhaven National Laboratory. The team reports in the
August edition of the journal Radiocarbon that the parchment was made
in AD 1434, plus or minus 11 years.</TE>
<TE>   That dating is considered particularly interesting because the map
had previously been linked through a variety of indirect evidence to
the Roman Catholic Church's Council of Basel, which was convened from
1431 to 1449. Olin argues that a putative forger was unlikely both to
have realized the significance of that date and to have obtained
parchment of the correct age.</TE>
<TE>   Critics, however, note that a Swiss mill is known to have produced
significant quantities of parchment for the Council of Basel, and
that a sample of that material could have been obtained.</TE>
<TE>   In the second study, reported in the July 31 issue of the journal
Analytical Chemistry, chemists Robin J. H. Clark and Katherine Brown
of University College in London used a newer technique called Raman
spectroscopy to examine the ink on the parchment. They conclude that
a forger used two separate preparations to give the appearance of
authenticity.</TE>
<TE>   Medieval inks were generally made from an iron gallotannate
compound. As this material ages and erodes from the parchment, it
turns the parchment brittle and leaves behind a yellow after-image.</TE>
<TE>   Clark and Brown concluded that the alleged forger simulated this
process by first drawing the map in a yellowish ink containing
anatase. A second ink containing carbon was then applied on top of
the yellow lines. As the carbon ink slowly flakes off, it exposes the
yellow lines, which give the appearance of aging. The carbon ink, in
contrast, would not have produced a yellow stain as it aged.</TE>

<LD>They should have held this Angels-Red Sox series a few blocks down
Katella Avenue, at Disneyland's Haunted Mansion. Starting Friday the
13th.</LD>
<LD>   Other teams--the Chicago Cubs, and every squad in Cleveland come
to mind--suffer bad breaks or stretches of futility. The Angels and
Red Sox are defined by them.</LD>
<LD>   These are teams whose failures are so deeply ingrained it only
takes the mention of select names to make fans cringe. Ask a Red Sox
follower if he's still haunted by the thoughts of Babe Ruth, Bucky
Dent or Bill Buckner, or an Angel fan if he can forget Donnie Moore,
Dave Henderson or Gene Mauch.</LD>
<TE>   It's fitting that their two darkest moments are linked: the Angels
were one strike away from the World Series in 1986 when Henderson
homered off Moore; that was the year the ball and the world
championship dribbled between Buckner's legs.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox haven't won a World Series since 1918, the year before
they traded Babe Ruth. The Angels are still waiting for their first
playoff series victory.</TE>
<TE>   Put them together and it's like Charlie Brown pitching to
Shleprock.</TE>
<TE>   Take the first run of the game for each team Monday. You had to
feel for the pitchers. Tim Salmon reached first on an error by Boston
third baseman Shea Hillenbrand, scoring on Garret Anderson's double.
And Boston's first base runner, Manny Ramirez, was safe after he hit
a weak grounder that somehow stayed fair inside third base before
coming to a halt. He came around to score two batters later.</TE>
<TE>   It turned out to be an entertaining game, won by the Angels with
two runs in the bottom of the eighth for a comeback, 5-4, victory.</TE>
<TE>   The franchises might have unfortunate histories, but these two
teams are good.</TE>
<TE>   In 2002 the Angels and Red Sox are battling for division crowns,
fighting for the wild-card spot should they fail and grappling with
the specter of past failures.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, they won't admit that last part. They prefer to sail along in
blissful ignorance. They even dare to tempt the ghosts.</TE>
<TE>   Did Benji Gil really light a cigar after the Angels beat the
Mariners on Sunday and tell reporters that he was "trying to get into
smoking shape for when we win the pennant"?</TE>
<TE>   Didn't Boston ace Pedro Martinez challenge the Curse of the
Bambino last year when he said "Wake up the Bambino--I'll drill him
in the..."?</TE>
<TE>   Foolish mortals. All you can do is light a candle for their poor,
ignorant souls.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez won't acknowledge the supernatural.</TE>
<TE>   "Are there curses around here?" he said before Monday night's
game. "Where, in Anaheim? I thought we were supposed to have angels
around here.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody's carrying a curse around here. I'm not. Don't ask me."</TE>
<TE>   "It's in your mind. In your coconut head ... cabeza de coco."</TE>
<TE>   He also said that--what a minute, did he just insult me in two
languages? That's a first. Anyway, not long after he said he didn't
believe in curses, he knocked on wood while discussing his pitching
success. Talk about mixed messages.</TE>
<TE>   When a reporter told him about the legend that Edison Field (nee
Anaheim Stadium) was built on an Indian burial ground, Martinez said:
"Maybe wake them up. They could give me a hand."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not afraid of that ... dead is dead."</TE>
<TE>   Just know this: Martinez hurt his shoulder shortly after he balked
at the Babe's legacy, and now he has to take the mound on the spirits
he challenged.</TE>
<TE>   As for Molina, he said Monday that he was joking about that
pennant-practice thing. He said he often smokes stogies (he prefers a
Padron anniversary series cigar) after games, even losses, and that
"There's still way too much baseball to be played for anybody to
celebrate."</TE>
<TE>   Too late. You shouldn't tempt fate--don't even try to coax a smile
from her. If fate has a sense of humor, how come the Angels never get
to laugh last?</TE>
<TE>   Their newest solution is to avoid discussing the curse in the
hopes it goes away.</TE>
<TE>   "I've heard it more in the past," Gil said. "This year, we don't
talk about it. You can say there's luck. You can make your luck, some
people say. I think it's just a matter of us, keep on playing the way
we've been playing."</TE>
<TE>   Manager Mike Scioscia knows the Angels haven't won a thing yet. He
doesn't mind if his players talk playoffs, as long as they realize
that they will reach them by their actions and not their words.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, there's no gag order. "Guys are free to say
whatever they want," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   It's good to see he's such a believer in First Amendment
principles.</TE>
<TE>   "We know there are going to be baseball playoffs," Scioscia said.
"Well we hope. Certainly it's our goal to be in them. Our message is
clear. We know the challenge ahead of us. There's a huge challenge
ahead before we even get to the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia makes a good point. With labor talks unsettled there
might not be any postseason this year. Wouldn't it be something if
the Angels and the Red Sox were both leading their divisions, with
the injury to Yankee closer Mariano Riviera potentially unlocking the
door to the World Series, and a strike wiped out the playoffs?</TE>
<TE>   With these two teams in the mix, it's almost inevitable.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>John Olerud's run-scoring single in the eighth inning sent the
Seattle Mariners to a 4-3 victory over the Detroit Tigers Monday
night at Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   Edgar Martinez hit a two-run homer, and Bret Boone tied it with a
sixth-inning single as Seattle rallied from a 3-0 deficit. The
Mariners remained percentage points behind the Angels for first place
in the American League West.</LD>
<LD>   Mark McLemore drew a leadoff walk in the eighth, stole second and
went to third on catcher Brandon Inge's throwing error. Olerud
followed with a single to center off Julio Santana (3-3) to score
McLemore with the go-ahead run.</LD>
<TE>   Arthur Rhodes (7-2) worked out of a jam in the eighth to get the
victory in relief of starter Freddy Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   Kazuhiro Sasaki got two outs for his 27th save in 31 chances,
striking out Inge with a runner on to end it.</TE>
<TE>   Rhodes came on after Garcia walked Damion Easley to start the
eighth. Bobby Higginson singled, but Randall Simon grounded into a
double play. Rhodes struck out Robert Fick to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners tied it, 3-3, in the sixth with an unearned run.
McLemore singled, went to second on Inge's passed ball and scored on
Boone's single to center that chased Jose Lima.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners ended a 16-inning scoreless drought in the fourth on
Boone's walk and Martinez's sixth homer of the season, his second in
three games.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle outfielder Ichiro Suzuki is in an 0-for-13 slide after
going 0 for 4.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 8, Oakland 6--Lee Stevens hit a three-run home run to
highlight a five-run seventh for the Indians, who rallied from
deficits of 5-0 and 6-3 to win at Oakland. The A's have lost five of
six, dropping four games out of first place in the AL West.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing by three going into the seventh, Milton Bradley hit a
two-run single with the bases loaded and Stevens gave Cleveland the
lead with his home run off reliever Mike Magnante (0-2).</TE>
<TE>   New York 9, Texas 2--Orlando Hernandez pitched six impressive
innings and Rondell White hit a two-run homer as the Yankees won at
Arlington, Texas. Jorge Posada homered, drove in two runs and reached
base four times for the Yankees, who have won 16 of their last 22 at
The Ballpark in Arlington.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez (6-3) threw five shutout innings before Carl Everett's
solo homer in the sixth. He gave up five hits, struck out five and
walked none. Ranger starter Kenny Rogers (11-6) got off to a shaky
start against his former team and lost his sixth consecutive decision
to the Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 4, Toronto 1--Paul Byrd threw his fourth consecutive
complete game as the Royals won at Kansas City, Mo. Carlos Beltran
homered and drove in three runs for the Royals, who snapped a
six-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 6, Baltimore 1--Paul Wilson pitched eight strong innings
to snap a personal 12-game winless streak as the Devil Rays won at
St. Petersburg, Fla.</TE>

<HD>Ortiz Has Two Heroes to Admire and Emulate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ramon Ortiz pitches against his baseball hero tonight. He hopes to
pitch in front of his first hero during the winter.</LD>
<LD>   Ortiz, nicknamed "Little Pedro" because his slight frame and
lively fastball evoke comparisons to fellow Dominican Pedro Martinez,
starts against Martinez and the Boston Red Sox tonight. In their only
previous meeting, two years ago, Ortiz pitched what he calls "the
best game I've pitched in the majors," a two-hitter in a 2-1 victory.</LD>
<LD>   His biggest fan will be back home in the Dominican Republic, where
his father is seriously ill with emphysema. Every two weeks, as soon
as he gets his paycheck, Ortiz remits money to the Dominican to pay
for his father's medical care.</LD>
<TE>   "My father is my life," he said. "My family is my life."</TE>
<TE>   Doctors have told his father that he could live for months or
years, Ortiz said, depending in part on whether he stops smoking. So
that his father could see him pitch, and because he is too weak to
travel, Ortiz pitched one game in the Dominican's last winter league
season.</TE>
<TE>   He hopes to do it again this winter. However, the four-year
contract he signed in March--one that could be worth $11.65
million--forbids him from pitching winter ball. Ortiz said he hopes
the Angels will waive the clause so he can pitch one game in front of
his father. General Manager Bill Stoneman said he would not discuss
the issue publicly but would be happy to do so with Ortiz.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz has blossomed into one of the top pitchers in the American
League, and Martinez has taken notice. Martinez, a three-time Cy
Young Award winner, said Ortiz need not try to be like Pedro.</TE>
<TE>   "He can do it better. He has the tools," Martinez said. "Pretty
soon, he'll realize he wants to be him and become better than me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Catcher Bengie Molina completed a strenuous workout and is
scheduled to play for Class-A Rancho Cucamonga tonight. If Molina
reports no discomfort Wednesday, the Angels plan to activate him
Thursday, after the minimum 15-day stay on the disabled list. The
Angels expected him to sit out at least one month and possibly two
when he suffered a partially torn hamstring July 16.</TE>

<HD>Persistent Angels Still Not at a Loss</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Led by Erstad, Salmon and Anderson, they rally
from one-run deficit in eighth inning to beat Red Sox, 5-4.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With second place staring at them from the scoreboard and Pedro
Martinez staring at them from the visiting dugout, the Angels blitzed
their way to 5-4 victory Monday, holding on to first place in the
American League West with a lightning rally in the eighth inning.</LD>
<LD>   The Seattle Mariners had won. The Boston Red Sox were six outs
away from beating the Angels, with Martinez scheduled to pitch
tonight. The Angels could have lost their lead in the West Monday and
lost their lead in the wild-card race tonight.</LD>
<LD>   Not this time, not this team. In a matter of minutes--a home run
by Darin Erstad, a triple by Tim Salmon, a sacrifice fly by Garret
Anderson--the Angels turned what would have been a painful one-run
defeat into a victory before a spirited crowd of 27,929 at Edison
Field.</LD>
<TE>   Scott Spiezio had three hits, including a home run, and the unsung
bullpen combined for three scoreless innings, as the Angels retained
the AL West lead by percentage points over the Mariners and increased
their wild-card lead to two games over Boston.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' chances appeared slim and grim in the eighth inning,
with the Red Sox leading, 4-3, and Erstad leading off. Erstad, in a
horrific slump, had not hit a home run at Edison Field in one year
and three days.</TE>
<TE>   But he did just that, off Boston reliever Alan Embree, after
making outs in 32 of his previous 35 at-bats. Salmon followed with a
drive that crashed high off the right-field wall and rolled away from
right fielder Trot Nixon. By the time Nixon recovered and returned
the ball to the infield, Salmon had hustled all the way to third
base.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson then reached out and poked a two-strike pitch into
right-center field--not very pretty, and not very deep, but plenty
effective. Center fielder Johnny Damon had to run a long way to get
to the ball, then dive to catch it, so Salmon tagged and scored the
winning run without a slide.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Schoeneweis, who pitched to one batter and got a double play
in the top of the eighth inning, earned the victory. Troy Percival
worked the ninth for his second save in two days and 24th of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels enjoyed something of a home-field advantage, rare when
the Red Sox and their legion of followers visit usually placid Edison
Field. The home fans actually sounded as if they took offense to
those among them rooting on the Red Sox.</TE>
<TE>   The Angel fans booed Boston superstar Nomar Garciaparra, just
because he was the Boston superstar. As soon as Boston fans offered a
round of applause after home runs by Brian Daubach and Shea
Hillenbrand, the Angel fans responded with a round of boos.</TE>
<TE>   The Angel rally saved starter Aaron Sele from taking the defeat.
Sele did what he says he always tries to do, pitch well enough to
keep his team in the game. He gave up four runs and seven hits in six
innings, including Daubach's two-run homer in the fourth inning and
Hillenbrand's solo shot in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels scored single runs in each of the first three innings
against Boston's Casey Fossum, making his first start of the season.</TE>
<TE>   In the first inning, Anderson doubled, extending his hitting
streak to 15 games and driving home Salmon.</TE>
<TE>   In the second, Speizio homered.</TE>
<TE>   In the third, David Eckstein singled, stole second base, took
third on a ground out by Erstad and scored on a ground ball by
Salmon.</TE>
<TE>   Fossum pitched six innings, giving up three runs and five hits.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad and Troy Glaus each reported for early batting practice,
but the work did not resolve the slump of Glaus. He went hitless in
four at-bats; he is in a five-for-37 (.135) skid and is batting .191
over the past two months.</TE>
<TE>   Glaus, who has one home run this month, visibly expressed his
frustration in the first inning. With Anderson on second base and two
out, Glaus flied out, then slammed his bat to the ground before
running the ball out.</TE>

<HD>Stewart Quits Brewers' Job</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Milwaukee Brewer pitching coach Dave Stewart resigned Monday, saying
he planned to care for his mother and spend more time with family.</LD>
<LD>   "This is what my gut was telling me to do," Stewart said. "After
sitting around and really evaluating the things that are
important--or should be important--most of those things I've bypassed
for better than half of my adult life.</LD>
<LD>   "I just woke up one day and decided to do something different."</LD>
<TE>   The 45-year-old Stewart was in his first season as the Brewers'
pitching instructor.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Castro, Milwaukee's bullpen coach since 1991, will take over
as pitching coach for the remainder of the season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago White Sox traded catcher Sandy Alomar Jr. to the
Colorado Rockies for a minor league pitcher. Alomar, 36, who was
batting .287 with seven homers and 25 runs batted in, was traded for
right-hander Enemencio Pacheco.</TE>
<TE>   It will be the fourth major league team for Alomar, the most
valuable player of the 1997 All-Star game. The 12-year veteran played
for the Cleveland Indians before signing with the White Sox on Dec.
18, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Pacheco was signed by Colorado as a non-drafted free agent Jan.
15, 1997. In Class A this season, he is 2-2 with six saves and a 3.16
earned-run average in 51 1/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Roger Clemens was back with the New York Yankees after a
rehabilitation stint in the minors, but the team isn't sure when he
will be activated from the 15-day disabled list. Clemens threw in the
bullpen before Monday night's game against the Texas Rangers and said
the strained right groin that sent him to the disabled list July 13
feels better.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees said Clemens will throw from the mound again today and
then they will decide whether Clemens needs another rehab start, or
if he's ready to take his turn in the rotation Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Texas Rangers released pitcher Dave Burba, a day after he had
a late-game meltdown, and recalled right-hander Joaquin Benoit from
triple-A Oklahoma. Burba gave up seven runs and seven hits in
one-third of an inning in the Rangers' 12-2 loss to Oakland on
Sunday. He was 4-5 in 23 games with the Rangers, and had given up
eight runs in 5 1/3 innings since moving to the bullpen July 16.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brewer catcher Raul Casanova and right-hander Nick Neugebauer were
sent on minor league rehabilitation assignments to triple-A
Indianapolis. Casanova, 29, has been on the disabled list since May
17 because of a torn elbow ligament. Neugebauer, 22, has been on the
disabled list since May 8 because of a strained right rotator
cuff.... The Baltimore Orioles put pitcher Jason Johnson on the
15-day disabled list because of right shoulder tendinitis and
recalled right-hander John Stephens from triple-A Rochester.... Pete
Coscarart, who battled baseball over pension rights for veteran
players, has died. He was 89.</TE>

produced one last memorable shot.</LD>
<LD>   The best two players of their generations were simply the best
Monday night as Woods made nine birdies in 16 holes and carried his
62-year-old idol to a 3 and 2 victory over Sergio Garcia and Lee
Trevino in the Battle at Bighorn.</LD>
<LD>   The only disappointment was the way it ended, with Woods making a
3-foot par putt to halve the hole and win the match. It was the only
hole won by a par.</LD>
<TE>   This was more like the Battle of Birdies.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen anything like it," Woods said. "You had to make
birdie to win the hole. That was incredible."</TE>
<TE>   Nicklaus had his moments, too.</TE>
<TE>   The Golden Bear, in what might have been his last performance
before a national television audience of this size, knocked down the
flag with a 7-iron on the ninth hole for a tap-in birdie that sent
the gallery into a frenzy.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't the 1972 U.S. Open, where Nicklaus produced the
signature shot of his career by hitting the stick on the 17th at
Pebble Beach. Still, Trevino has seen enough of Nicklaus to know what
was coming.</TE>
<TE>   "Jack loves to knock it stiff when he's got all the people
watching," Trevino said.</TE>
<TE>   Woods was so dominant that he was nine under through 16 holes and
didn't even get a chance at two birdie putts inside 10 feet.</TE>
<TE>   "I did all right," Woods said in mock understatement. "I broke 80,
didn't I?"</TE>
<TE>   That's something he couldn't say in the third round of the British
Open, where he had an 81 in raging wind and rain. The only element
Monday were temperatures that topped out at 107 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Nicklaus had not played with Woods since the first two rounds of
the 2000 PGA Championship at Valhalla, where Woods went on to win in
a playoff for his third out of four consecutive majors.</TE>
<TE>   "I know now that I have no business playing on the regular tour,"
Nicklaus said. "If you see the way Tiger and Sergio play, there's no
such thing as a par-5 anymore. My partner was great. And I like to
win."</TE>
<TE>   So does Woods, who came out with a focus that belied the
hit-and-giggle event. Garcia is the only player to have beaten Woods
in the Battle at Bighorn, and Woods seemed bent on gaining some
revenge in the middle of a team event.</TE>
<TE>   It all led to a far more compelling match than last year, when hot
blasts of desert wind, ridiculously tough conditions and an
alternate-shot format guaranteed a snoozer in a mixed-team match
featuring Woods and Annika Sorenstam against David Duval and Karrie
Webb.</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't the only difference.</TE>
<TE>   The conversation was off the charts, most of it thanks to the
Merry Mex. Trevino started gabbing from the moment he arrived on the
practice range.</TE>
<TE>   Woods spoke volumes with his clubs. He got off to a blazing start
by hitting his approach to six feet for birdie on the first hole,
then making a 15-footer for birdie on No. 2.</TE>
<TE>   "If he keeps doing that, there's no sense putting the lights up,"
Trevino said to Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   Trevino must have wanted to see those lights, because he answered
with birdie putts of 10 and 15 feet on the next two holes to square
the match, and Garcia got in on the act with a 12-foot birdie putt on
the par-3 sixth hole for a 1-up lead.</TE>
<TE>   That was fleeting. Woods and Nicklaus won the next four holes, the
turning point coming on No. 8 when all four players had the hole
surrounded.</TE>
<TE>   Nicklaus went first, rifling a 2-iron into 12 feet. Woods hit
5-iron, and the ball stopped about 10 inches from going into the
hole.</TE>
<TE>   Trevino and Garcia both pulled their 10-foot putts to fall 1-down,
then Nicklaus contributed with a shot that brought out the loudest
roar of the match--a 7-iron that hit the flag and stopped a foot
away.</TE>
<TE>   Trevino and Woods slapped hands as the crowd roared.</TE>
<TE>   This time, there was plenty to applaud.</TE>

<HD>Painstaking Work Is the Key for Armstrong</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rob Fernas</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dale Robertson of the Houston Chronicle, on Lance Armstrong winning
his fourth consecutive Tour de France:</LD>
<LD>   "The reason Armstrong has become the world's most indomitable
cyclist and America's greatest athlete is two-pronged: He has both
the physiology and the passion for his chosen vocation.</LD>
<LD>   "Still, what truly distances Lance from the [pack] isn't just the
pleasure he gleans from being on his bike. All the lads love
cycling--and certainly the celebrity it buys them. What they don't
share is his love for suffering.... The more Lance hurts [and] the
more wasted he becomes, the happier he is."</LD>
<TE>   Second opinion: Skip Bayless of the San Jose Mercury News calls
Armstrong "a triumph of physical and mental stamina" but disagrees
with those promoting him as the world's greatest athlete:</TE>
<TE>   "Does Armstrong have great hand-eye coordination, body control or
running speed? No. You wouldn't bet a single franc on him in a
superstars competition against a man about his size."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who was the last golfer to win the first three legs
(Masters, U.S. Open, British Open) of the modern Grand Slam?</TE>
<TE>   Before his time: Though he never won a Super Bowl, George Allen
will be recognized as an innovator when the former Los Angeles Ram
and Washington Redskin coach is posthumously inducted into the Pro
Football Hall of Fame on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Allen was the first to conduct off-season minicamps, and it was
his idea to build Redskin Park, the league's first year-round
practice facility.</TE>
<TE>   "That alone sets him apart--that he would have the vision to have
an operation that would stand by itself," said Bubba Tyler, the
Redskins' longtime trainer. "The things we're doing today, we're
still doing because of George Allen."</TE>
<TE>   Helping hand: From Tom Fitzgerald of the San Francisco Chronicle:
"Former President Jimmy Carter says he gladly would help mediate the
labor dispute between baseball players and owners.</TE>
<TE>   "Look for former President Bill Clinton, in a similar gesture of
public service, to volunteer to mediate the WNBA labor dispute."</TE>
<TE>   More Fitzgerald: "Playboy will feature the women of Arthur
Andersen. First it was the women of Enron, now the women of Arthur
Andersen. Let's hope the WNBA doesn't go bankrupt."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1982, the Atlanta Braves returned
Chief Noc-A-Homa and his tepee to the left-field pavilion after
losing 19 of 21 games and blowing a 10 1/2-game lead. The mascot was
removed to allow for more seats. The Braves recovered to regain first
place.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Ben Hogan, in 1953. He didn't play in the PGA
Championship because of a scheduling conflict with the British Open.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Greg Cote of the Miami Herald, explaining his
preference for the NFL over college football:</TE>
<TE>   "Collegeheads sis-boom-bah over those wild, 45-42 WNBA kind of
scores, whereas I say that's what happens when you have two really
bad defenses populated by players who, a year from now, will fail a
Canadian League tryout and be the last persons on Earth lamenting the
death of the XFL.</TE>
<TE>   "College ball is Football Junior, an appetizer, an opening act,
the audition ... for the NFL."</TE>

<HD>Clippers Going Miles for Miller</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: They are trading their popular 20-year-old
forward for Cavalier point guard in four-player deal, a league source
confirms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Clippers have landed the standout point guard they so coveted
this off-season, but will pay a price for acquiring Andre Miller from
the Cleveland Cavaliers in a trade that will be formally announced
either today or Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Neither team would comment for the record Monday, but a league
source confirmed that the Clippers have agreed to send reserve
forwards Darius Miles and Harold Jamison to Cleveland to get Miller
and guard Bryant Stith.</LD>
<LD>   "There is nothing conclusive to report at this time, but we're
still working on it," said Joe Safety, Clipper vice president of
communications.</LD>
<TE>   Miller, the league's leader in assists last season with an average
of 10.9, will direct an offense that promises to be among the most
exciting in the NBA next season. Miller will have a great deal of
options with the Clippers, including Elton Brand at power forward and
center Michael Olowokandi.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, 26, is a Los Angeles native. He graduated from Verbum Dei
High and became a standout at the University of Utah before the
Cavaliers selected him eighth in the 1999 draft. In his first NBA
season, Miller earned first-team all-rookie honors.</TE>
<TE>   Like Brand, Corey Maggette and Lamar Odom, Miller is eligible for
a contract extension this summer. It was not known whether the
Clippers will give Miller that extension.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers also must re-sign Olowokandi, a restricted free agent
coming off his finest NBA season. Olowokandi averaged career bests of
11.1 points and 8.9 rebounds in 2001-02.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers were not eager to deal Miles, 20, who seemed poised
to move from an exciting substitute who thrilled crowds with
highlight-reel dunks to a dependable starter next season.</TE>
<TE>   "There has not been a trade completed yet," Jeffrey Wechsler,
Miles' agent told the Associated Press on Monday. "If a trade
involving Darius is completed, I'm sure he'll be very disappointed
for the fans of the Los Angeles Clippers."</TE>
<TE>   However, the Clippers had a wealth of talent up front, including
recent draft picks Chris Wilcox and Melvin Ely, but no one to direct
them from the point.</TE>
<TE>   Point guard Jeff McInnis is an unrestricted free agent, and the
Clippers do not wish to retain him. The team on July 18 signed point
guard Marko Jaric, their second-round pick in the 2000 draft.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, it was Miller or bust.</TE>
<TE>   Attempts to persuade the New Orleans Hornets to trade Baron Davis,
a former UCLA star, failed in the days leading up to the draft.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers' starting five figures to be Miller and veteran Eric
Piatkowski at the guards, Olowokandi at center and Brand and Odom at
forwards. Top reserves are expected to be guards Maggette, Keyon
Dooling and Quentin Richardson.</TE>
<TE>   Jaric, a member of the Yugoslav national team who has played in
Italy and Greece, is said to be among the best point guards in
Europe. At the moment, Jaric appears ticketed to become an
internationally experienced backup for Miller.</TE>
<TE>   Miles recently said he hoped to perform well enough at training
camp to force Coach Alvin Gentry to make him a starter.</TE>
<TE>   Miles excelled as a reserve, averaging 9.4 points as a rookie and
9.5 last season. He and Richardson were renowned around the league
for tapping their fists against their foreheads after making a big
play or shot. Neither player would explain the significance of the
gesture, although many fans copied it, particularly those who helped
the Clippers average a franchise record of 18,053 at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Jamison appeared in only 25 games last season.</TE>
<TE>   With McInnis at the point the last two seasons, the Clippers began
a turnaround from a 15-win season in 1999-2000 to 31 victories in
2000-01 and 39 last season--the team's best mark in almost a decade.
But the Clippers failed to advance to the playoffs for the fifth
consecutive season in 2001-02.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland made no secret of its desire to start anew. The
Cavaliers almost had a deal with the Clippers completed on the day of
the NBA draft, June 26, but talks collapsed late that night on a
proposed trade for Miller.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Karros Is Not Eager to Lose Playing Time</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First baseman Eric Karros has not been told that newly acquired
utility player Tyler Houston would be cutting into his playing time,
and Karros was surprised to hear Manager Jim Tracy say that the
Dodgers now have three players--Houston, Adrian Beltre and Karros--to
play two positions, third base and first.</LD>
<LD>   "I would be very shocked if I was in any kind of rotational system
unless my play warranted that," said Karros, the cleanup hitter who
is batting .285 with nine home runs, 18 doubles and 45 runs batted
in.</LD>
<LD>   "It depends on how all of us are doing, and that's fine, that's
the way it should be. I don't know if I'd go so far as to say we have
three guys for two positions, but at least we won't have to use
[catcher Paul] Lo Duca at first base in an emergency. And if me or
Adrian is struggling, we have another good offensive option to put
out there."</LD>
<TE>   Tracy hasn't specified how he will use Houston, who bats
left-handed and had four hits and four RBIs in his Dodger debut
Friday night against San Francisco. But he made it clear Houston will
get plenty of at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   There won't be a straight platoon at third because Beltre is a
superior defensive player and Tracy doesn't want to sacrifice defense
every time the Dodgers face a right-handed pitcher, which is most of
the time.</TE>
<TE>   Most likely, Houston will start two or three games a week at third
base and once every week to 10 days at first base, when the Dodgers
are facing a tough right-hander whom Karros doesn't match up well
against.</TE>
<TE>   "I know Adrian Beltre has made some errors, but he's also made
some great plays that not a lot of third basemen can make, and I have
to be mindful of that," Tracy said. "[Decisions] will depend on how
they match up with an opposing pitcher, and what lineup will be the
best on a given day."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers thought a bonus to the Houston trade was that the
former Milwaukee utility player has extensive experience behind the
plate and would give them the third catcher they've lacked this
season. But Houston has about as much interest in catching as he does
in re-signing with the woeful Brewers this winter.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't be excited about that," Houston said. "I worked all my
career to get out of that."</TE>
<TE>   An infielder in high school, Houston was the second player chosen
in the 1989 draft by Atlanta--as a catcher.</TE>
<TE>   "I always hated catching," Houston said. "I liked to use my
athleticism, I liked to hit, and catching took away both. My first
year [in the minor leagues] they sent me to Sumter [S.C.], the
hottest place on Earth. I was ready to give it up after one year."</TE>
<TE>   After five minor league seasons behind the plate, Houston evolved
into a utility player, and he hasn't caught in two years.</TE>
<TE>   When the Dodgers discovered Houston's distaste for catching,
utility player Mike Kinkade, who has some catching experience, began
catching bullpen workouts and sitting in on pitchers' meetings.
Kinkade, and not Houston, will be the team's emergency catcher.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Dan Evans addressed the Dodgers' two biggest
needs, boosting the bench and bullpen with the acquisitions of
Houston and Cleveland reliever Paul Shuey, who will join the team in
Cincinnati today.</TE>
<TE>   Evans didn't rule out the possibility of another deal before
Wednesday's nonwaiver trading deadline, but didn't expect to pursue
one.</TE>
<TE>   "You really never know what is going to come up from other clubs,
what names might become available, but we're just going to be good
listeners the next couple days," Evans said. "I don't want to say
we're done, because you never know when the right situation will come
up."</TE>

<HD>Just Getting in the Swing Is a Victory</HD>
<DH>Tennis: After missing 14 months to battle a form of
leukemia, Corina Morariu makes her return to the court, losing in
doubles at La Costa.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL DWYRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CARLSBAD</DL>
<LD>When the four doubles players were ready to take the court, she was
introduced first. When she walked out, she smiled a lot.</LD>
<LD>   All of that was as it should be.</LD>
<LD>   Opening day at the Acura Classic at La Costa Resort and Spa wasn't
the usual uneventful Monday on the Women's Tennis Assn. circuit. This
Monday was Corina Morariu day.</LD>
<TE>   For the casual follower, there are familiar elements to this
story. An athlete, in the prime of her life and the height of her
career, is stricken with a life-threatening disease, beats it and
embarks on the comeback trail.</TE>
<TE>   That's the quick version. It doesn't come close to capturing the
months in a hospital, battling a form of leukemia that doctors
estimate is curable about 60% of the time, leaving that dreaded 40%
hanging over your head. It doesn't describe the chemotherapy that
left her so weak for so long that she couldn't hold a tennis racket,
much less swing it. Nor does it take time to elaborate on having her
brother shave her head because the clumps of hair that were falling
out from the chemo were getting all over the bed.</TE>
<TE>   "He left a little spiky thing at the front, thinking that that was
pretty funny," Morariu said recently. "We took pictures and made the
most of the situation."</TE>
<TE>   Nor does the quick version of this story capture the outpouring of
affection that came Morariu's way from fellow competitors.</TE>
<TE>   Just weeks after Morariu was diagnosed and hospitalized in early
May 2001, Jennifer Capriati won the French Open and dedicated the win
to Morariu, holding up a sign to tell the world. Lindsay Davenport
wore a necklace with a "C" on it at Wimbledon. Lisa Raymond and Renee
Stubbs, the No. 1 doubles team in the world, kept sending her gifts
in the hospital. And Kimberly Po, the tour veteran from Rolling
Hills, got on a plane in Paris just before playing in the French and
flew back to visit Morariu in the hospital in Florida for a few days.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't imagine what strength I got from those things," Morariu
said here Monday.</TE>
<TE>   So it came to pass that, 14 months after her life as she knew it
came to a screeching halt with the diagnosis in a Miami hospital,
Morariu stepped back onto a tennis court, with Po as her partner, for
a women's pro tour match.</TE>
<TE>   The temperature was in the mid-'80s, the sky bright blue and
scattered occasionally with clouds. The swaying palm trees around the
stadium court framed colorful flags at the top of the bleachers that
represented the countries of the players in this event. An estimated
1,500 people, a bit larger than a normal Monday afternoon tennis
crowd, were there to watch.</TE>
<TE>   Morariu and Po were given a wild-card entry into the doubles draw,
something that may not be necessary much longer for a player with
Morariu's credentials. The former No. 1 doubles player in the world
brought to the La Costa center court a resume that included two Grand
Slam event titles--Wimbledon with Davenport in 2000 and an Australian
Open mixed with Ellis Ferreira in 2001. The Australian title came
just four months before Morariu started getting nosebleeds and
feeling weak and, in two days, went from an active player to a cancer
patient.</TE>
<TE>   On the court, a fairy tale didn't come to pass. Morariu and Po
lost to a very good team of Chanda Rubin and Meghann Shaughnessy,
6-2, 3-6, 7-5.</TE>
<TE>   For most of the match, Morariu was the best player on the court,
but rust showed at key times, even though she has had some match play
over the last three weeks as a member of the Philadelphia Freedom of
the Word Team Tennis League.</TE>
<TE>   Serving for the match at 5-4, she lost at 15 when Shaughnessy,
overwhelmed by a tough first serve into her body, fought it off and
somehow lofted a winning lob to the backhand corner of the court on
break point. Then, on match point, Morariu let a midcourt floating
lob get too low and had her topspin backhand catch the net.</TE>
<TE>   So it was over for her at the Acura Classic, but it also was just
beginning again for this 24-year-old from Boca Raton. She said she
never felt tired during the hour-and-a-half match, was pleased with
the way she played and the way she moved, and was eager to get to
Manhattan Beach next week for both singles and doubles.</TE>
<TE>   "This is all bonus time for me now," she said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the key evening match, Mary Pierce was upset by Greta Arn, 3-6,
6-3, 6-4. "When it started getting darker I was having trouble seeing
and I had a hard time judging the ball," said Pierce.... No seeded
player was scheduled to play Monday, but one was eliminated, anyway.
No. 4 Monica Seles suffered a foot injury in practice and withdrew,
heading home to Florida but saying she hoped to be ready for
Manhattan Beach next week.... Another surprise was the 6-1, 7-6 (4)
victory by 17-year-old American Ashley Harkleroad over Italian
veteran Rita Grande. Grande kept slicing and getting to the net and
making winning volleys. But Harkleroad persevered, broke Grande's
serve at 4-5 of the second set and then survived a case of the nerves
when she went from 6-0 in the tiebreaker to 6-4. Grande bailed her
out by slapping an easy forehand service return five feet past the
baseline on Harkleroad's fifth match point. Harkleroad was ranked No.
226 going into the match, Grande No. 36.</TE>

<LD>   What: "A City on Fire: The Story of the '68 Detroit Tigers"</LD>
<TE>   Where: HBO, tonight, 10</TE>
<TE>   This excellent HBO documentary covers a 14-month period that was
one of the most explosive times in American history. It begins with
the devastating Detroit race riots of 1967 and concludes with the
Tigers winning the 1968 World Series.</TE>
<TE>   The documentary is about how a baseball team helped reduce racial
tensions in a wounded city.</TE>
<TE>   The 1967 riots erupted following a police raid at the Blind Pig, a
black nightclub. The riots lasted a week, 10 city blocks were burned,
43 people died and 2,500 stores were burned down or looted.</TE>
<TE>   Damon Keith of the Michigan Commission on Civil Rights says,
"People were not sane about this thing. They were just taking all of
their frustrations out about the housing and the police brutality,
lack of education, jobs and things of that sort. So you had all these
pent-up emotions that erupted and nothing could stop it."</TE>
<TE>   The riots ended only after President Johnson ordered 5,000 federal
troops into Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers missed out on the World Series in 1967 on the last day
of the season, when they lost the second game of a doubleheader
against the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   But in 1968, the Tigers got off to a great start, captivating the
city's black and white communities. The Tigers won the American
League by 12 games. They won the World Series after trailing the St.
Louis Cardinals, 3-1. In Game 1, the Cardinals' Bob Gibson had a
Series-record 17 strikeouts. In Game 7, left-hander Mickey Lolich
beat Gibson on two days' rest.</TE>
<TE>   Lolich and Gibson are among those who appear in the documentary.
Others from the Tigers include Willie Horton, Gates Brown, Earl
Wilson, Al Kaline, Bill Freehan, Jim Northrup and announcer Ernie
Harwell. Others from the Cardinals include Tim McCarver and Lou
Brock.</TE>
<TE>   Given the combination of the Tigers' amazing season and the
concurrent social unrest, this well-produced documentary presents a
compelling slice of American history.</TE>

<HD>Hubbard Punished by Panel</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Racetrack executive fined $750,000 and his
company $2.25 million in 2001 prostitution scheme.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a settlement agreement announced Monday, the Indiana Gaming
Commission has fined casino and racetrack executive R.D. Hubbard
$750,000 and his company, Pinnacle Entertainment of Glendale, $2.25
million in reaction to a golf tournament last year at which
high-rollers were entertained by at least eight imported women who
have been labeled prostitutes.</LD>
<LD>   At a meeting in Indianapolis, the commission also ordered that the
Pinnacle-owned Belterra Casino, near Cincinnati, be closed for gaming
for a 66-hour period in early October.</LD>
<LD>   Hubbard, former chairman of Hollywood Park Race Track before it
was sold to Churchill Downs, resigned as chairman of Pinnacle in
April and in recent months has sold about $7 million worth of his
stock in the gaming company.</LD>
<TE>   The commission also cited Hubbard for "pressuring" casino
employees to issue gambling chips to the golfers without proper
documentation.</TE>
<TE>   A gaming commission spokeswoman said that the vote on the
sanctions against Pinnacle was 4-1, with one voting "present." The
vote on the penalties against Hubbard was not available.</TE>
<TE>   Asked to comment, Theodore Nicholas, one of Hubbard's attorneys
said: "I prefer not to say anything now, because I have not fully
discussed this with my client."</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas was one of two attorneys representing Hubbard at Monday's
meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Lee, who took over as chief executive at Pinnacle when Paul
Alanis resigned in April, could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The fine against Pinnacle was said to be a record penalty for the
Indiana Gaming Commission, which oversees 10 riverboats in the state.
The commission was alerted to the hiring of the prostitutes after two
former Belterra employees filed sexual-harassment lawsuits against
the casino. The sexual-harassment suits are not directly related to
the golf tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Hubbard, 67, breeds and races thoroughbreds and quarter horses and
owns Ruidoso Downs, a quarter horse track in New Mexico. He has
applied for a license to build and run a racetrack-casino in Hobbs,
N.M. There are two other applicants, and a decision on the license is
expected in late August.</TE>
<TE>   Pinnacle, formed after Churchill Downs bought out Hollywood Park
in 1999, owns casinos in the U.S. and Argentina and has two card
clubs in California, one on a lease arrangement with Churchill at
Hollywood Park and the other in Compton.</TE>
<TE>   The Indiana commission said that one of the reasons for the hefty
fine was that "neither Pinnacle nor Belterra reported in a timely
fashion to the commission the fact that the golf classic and
surrounding events had transpired." The commission reported that on
successive nights two entertainers, Howie Mandel and Waylon Jennings,
had their performances interrupted at Belterra because of the noise
coming from a nearby room where the golfers were being entertained.
The commission also said the women were flown to Indiana on a private
airplane leased by Pinnacle.</TE>

<HD>Iverson Cleared of Most Charges</HD>
<DH>Jurisprudence: After conflicting testimony, only one
misdemeanor count remains against the 76er guard.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROB FERNAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Allen Iverson was cleared of all criminal charges except one
misdemeanor count at a hearing Monday to see if the Philadelphia 76er
guard should stand trial for storming into his cousin's apartment
with a gun and threatening two men while looking for his wife.</LD>
<LD>   A charge of making terrorist threats was the only count left
standing by Philadelphia Municipal Court Judge James DeLeon after a
six-hour preliminary hearing. The prosecution's case was damaged by
conflicting testimony from witnesses.</LD>
<LD>   Iverson, 27, among the NBA's most talented and popular players,
was arrested earlier this month on 14 felony and misdemeanor charges,
including felony weapons, trespass and conspiracy offenses. They
carried a maximum sentence of 70 years.</LD>
<TE>   Cathie Abookire, a spokesperson for the Philadelphia district
attorney's office, disagreed with the judge's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "The evidence was more than ample to hold the case for trial," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Abookire said a judge will schedule a preliminary hearing Thursday
on the remaining charge.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, the 76ers said, "We continue to support Allen and
we look forward to the resolution of the remaining issue in this
matter so that both Allen and the 76ers can return their full focus
where it properly belongs: on the basketball court."</TE>
<TE>   DeLeon's ruling followed testimony from Iverson's two
accusers--Charles Jones, 21, and Hakim Carey, 17--and his cousin,
Shawn Bowman, 21. Carey said he did not see a handgun tucked in
Iverson's waistband, contradicting statements he gave police. Carey
said Jones told him to tell authorities he had seen a gun.</TE>
<TE>   Bowman testified that two days after the July 3 incident, Jones
told him there was no gun.</TE>
<TE>   "I reached a decision that it was not probable that [Iverson] had
a gun," DeLeon said. "It sounds like you had a relative looking for a
relative at the house of a relative."</TE>
<TE>   With that, the judge perhaps put in perspective a case that many
believed has received undue attention from the media and law
enforcement because of Iverson's celebrity.</TE>
<TE>   In the days leading up to Monday's hearing, some veterans of the
criminal justice system questioned whether Iverson's case would have
ever gotten to court if not for the media putting intense pressure on
authorities handling the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "When all eyes are on a case, the prosecution goes to great
lengths to make sure there's not a perception that they're being more
fair to Iverson than to the guy on the street," defense attorney
Brian McMonagle told the Philadelphia Inquirer.</TE>
<TE>   "But in so doing, you end up being unfair to him.... There was
more manpower used in this case than I've seen in most homicide
cases."</TE>
<TE>   While many similar cases are handled by a single detective, the
investigation into Iverson's case at one point involved five
detectives. Frank Keel, a spokesman for Philadelphia Mayor John F.
Street, told a sports radio show he was concerned some detectives may
have been "overzealous about nailing Allen Iverson."</TE>
<TE>   Questions also have been raised about the way the largely white
media has handled a case involving a famous black athlete with a
criminal past.</TE>
<TE>   Iverson was arrested and convicted in a 1993 bowling-alley brawl
in Virginia, and he was arrested in 1997 after he was found to be in
possession of a handgun and a small amount of marijuana in a car he
owned.</TE>
<TE>   Writing in the Chicago Sun-Times last week, columnist Michael Eric
Dyson said white writers don't like Iverson because of his cornrows,
tattoos, and the fact he supposedly is the "anti-Jordan."</TE>
<TE>   Iverson, Dyson wrote, is the victim of "unfair hype" and quoted
black writer Larry Platt as saying Iverson is unfairly criticized by
the mainstream media because he is his own man and "unwilling to sign
on to [white society's] assimilation script."</TE>
<TE>   Iverson, the NBA's most valuable player in the 2000-01 season and
a three-time league scoring champion, was accused of throwing his
wife, Tawanna, out of their home and later barging into Bowman's West
Philadelphia apartment in the early hours of July 3.</TE>
<TE>   Under questioning Monday by Iverson attorney Richard Sprague,
Bowman testified that Iverson paid rent at the apartment and had
permission to enter at any time. Therefore, DeLeon ruled, Iverson was
not trespassing when he entered the apartment with his uncle, Gregory
Iverson, 39.</TE>
<TE>   All but the misdemeanor charge was dismissed against Gregory
Iverson as well.</TE>

<LD>Amid the likelihood that the baseball players' union will set a
strike date at some point next week, the resumption of bargaining
negotiations in New York on Monday failed to produce a breakthrough
on the key issue of revenue sharing.</LD>
<LD>   The sides met twice for a total of about 3 1/2 hours, but neither
side would characterize the status of their discussions about revenue
sharing, which involve the amount to be shared and the method of
distribution.</LD>
<LD>   The union did make a benefit plan proposal that was "positively
received" by management, according to Rob Manfred, baseball's lead
labor lawyer.</LD>
<TE>   "We'd had enough discussions that we knew where they were coming
in, and it was within the range we expected," Manfred said, which
would suggest, at the least, that one more secondary issue is off the
table.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, responding to a suggestion made by Al Kaline
during Hall of Fame festivities in Cooperstown, N.Y., 40 members of
the Hall sent a letter to Commissioner Bud Selig saying that another
work stoppage would be a "terrible mistake" and urging him to agree
to impartial mediation.</TE>
<TE>   "To protect the game we all love and have given so much to, we
suggest you agree to a qualified mediator that will allow you to find
the common ground necessary to avoid a work stoppage," the players
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Selig, in a statement, thanked the players but said the best way
to settle the issue is through collective bargaining.</TE>
<TE>   Former President Jimmy Carter recently volunteered to serve as a
mediator, a role that has never proved beneficial during baseball's
long and troubled labor history. Former President Bill Clinton
volunteered the services of nationally known mediator William J.
Usery during the 1994-95 dispute, but Usery was unable to solve the
problems that produced a 232-day strike. Selig and union leader Don
Fehr met privately in Cooperstown on the weekend, but neither would
reveal what they discussed.</TE>

<KH>AROUND THE NBA</KH>
<HD>Instant Replay Wins Approval</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The NBA approved the use of instant replay Monday, only months after
several controversial last-second calls in the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   Beginning with the 2002-03 preseason, referees will automatically
review any shot that goes in with no time left on the clock in any
quarter or overtime. They will also be able to use video to determine
if a player had his foot on the three-point line or out-of-bounds
line.</LD>
<LD>   Recommended by the league's competition committee last month, the
NBA's Board of Governors approved the move last week.</LD>
<TE>   There were several last-second shots last season that helped
precipitate the move.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's any one event that drove this decision,"
Stu Jackson, the NBA's vice president for basketball operations,
said. "There have been a number of instances where, quite frankly,
for any human being it would have been impossible to determine
whether the shot got off in time."</TE>
<TE>   In an April playoff game between the Hornets and the Orlando
Magic, Charlotte's Baron Davis banked in a shot that clearly beat the
buzzer after the Hornets inbounded with 0.7 seconds left and the
score tied.</TE>
<TE>   Referee Bernie Fryer waved the shot off while it was in the air,
saying the officiating crew had discussed beforehand that no player
could catch, turn and shoot in that amount of time.</TE>
<TE>   The Hornets went on to beat the Magic in overtime, but the episode
showed that the league needed to address its policies regarding
rulings on last-second shots.</TE>
<TE>   In the New Jersey Net-Indiana Pacer series, Reggie Miller forced
overtime in Game 5 with a shot that left his hand after the clock
reached 0.0 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   And in Game 4 of the Sacramento King-Laker series, a 30-footer by
Samaki Walker to end the first half was allowed even though it left
his hand too late.</TE>
<TE>   "The officials themselves are very much in favor of an
instant-replay system," Jackson said. "The overwhelming majority of
officials are in favor of the system."</TE>
<TE>   Replay will not be used to determine whether the clock started on
time.</TE>
<TE>   This was an issue in March, when Cleveland's Lamond Murray made a
three-pointer at the buzzer to give the Cavaliers a 100-97 win over
New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   There were only 0.5 seconds left on the clock when Andre Miller
inbounded the ball, and Murray was able to catch it and shoot it
before the buzzer sounded.</TE>
<TE>   Replay will also not be able to determine whether or not a foul
call was correct, only whether it occurred before time expired.</TE>
<TE>   For any reviewable call to be overturned, officials will need to
have "clear and conclusive" evidence. The league said the reviews
will take two minutes or less.</TE>
<TE>   The officials will use video provided by the game's telecast. If a
game is not televised, Jackson acknowledged the possibility of
inconsistencies.</TE>
<TE>   "We're mulling that over as we speak," Jackson said. "Maybe we
can't review during those games. What we could do is use the in-arena
feed."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 76er forward Derrick Coleman was arrested when police
said he refused to take a breath test for alcohol after being stopped
for driving about 100 mph in Farmington Hills, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   The speed limit on Interstate 696 in the Detroit suburb is 70 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman, 35, who was alone in the vehicle, was taken into custody
about 3:30 a.m. Saturday by officers who suspected the Detroit native
had been drinking alcohol, Farmington Hills Police Chief William
Dwyer said.</TE>
<TE>   "They smelled the odor of alcohol," Dwyer said. "They gave him a
sobriety test that indicated that he had been drinking, and he told
them that he had had some champagne."</TE>
<TE>   Coleman was arrested after he refused to take a breath test, Dwyer
said, and blood tests for alcohol were taken after police received a
court order. Results were expected in about a week, Dwyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman was ticketed for operating a vehicle under the influence
of liquor and refusing to take a breath test, Dwyer said. He posted
bond and was released.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Coleman turned himself in after a warrant for his arrest
was issued in North Carolina on charges of driving with a revoked
license and using an out-of-state license while his North Carolina
license was revoked.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman, who played for the Charlotte Hornets at the time, had his
license revoked because he refused to take a sobriety test after a
car accident the previous October.</TE>
<TE>   He was acquitted on drunk driving charges in that accident.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Terry Porter, a 17-year NBA veteran who played last season for the
San Antonio Spurs, joined the Sacramento Kings as an assistant coach.
Porter, who played under King Coach Rick Adelman in Portland,
replaces Pete Carril, who became a special assistant to Geoff Petrie,
team president of basketball operations last month.... The Golden
State Warriors promoted Otis Smith to director of basketball
operations. For the past 2 1/2 years, Smith, who once played for the
Warriors, was the director of community relations.</TE>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Raimondas Rumsas, the little-known Lithuanian cyclist whose
third-place Tour de France finish was considered a breakthrough, was
suspended by his team Monday in Paris after French police detained
his wife on suspicion of carrying doping products.</LD>
<LD>   Rumsas' finish remained in place Monday pending the results of an
investigation and drug test results, a Tour official said.</LD>
<LD>   His wife, Edita, is to appear before a judge in the eastern town
of Bonneville today, said Christian Lothion, of the judicial police
in Lyon.</LD>
<TE>   "We seized an enormous amount of products," Lothion said, adding
they included the injectable form of the performance-enhancing
substance EPO and testosterone.</TE>
<TE>   It was not immediately known whether the products had anything to
do with Rumsas.</TE>
<TE>   He finished 8 minutes, 17 seconds behind Lance Armstrong, who won
his fourth straight title. Joseba Beloki of Spain was second.</TE>
<TE>   The Tour's vice president, Daniel Baal, said Rumsas was tested at
least once during the Tour, and that the results of tests carried out
through last Wednesday had come back negative. Tour officials were
still waiting for the results of tests carried out over the last four
days, Baal said.</TE>
<TE>   Tennis</TE>
<TE>   Lleyton Hewitt, the world's No. 1 tennis player, lost to Felix
Mantilla in the first round of the $2.95-million Tennis Masters
Canada tournament at Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Mantilla, 27 of Spain, who has struggled this year to remain
ranked in the top 50, pulled off the 2-6, 6-4, 6-3 upset.</TE>
<TE>   "I am surprised because in the last month I wasn't playing so
well," Mantilla said. "This is a special win for me--maybe the best
win of my career."</TE>
<TE>   Pete Sampras and South African Wayne Ferreira were to play the
last match Monday night but it was postponed until tonight because of
the rain.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Martin rallied for a 3-6, 7-6 (4), 7-5 victory over Greg
Rusedski in the first round. In another early match, unseeded
Guillermo Canas of Argentina upset 10th-seeded Roger Federer of
Switzerland, 7-6 (10), 7-5.</TE>
<TE>   Andre Agassi withdrew from the tournament, claimed a lower back
and hip injury and was fined $80,000 by the ATP Tour for taking a
week off for the second time this season.</TE>
<TE>   Hockey</TE>
<TE>   The Columbus Blue Jackets re-signed left wing Geoff Sanderson to a
one-year contract and agreed to multiyear deals with center Espen

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Diego Charger General Manager John Butler has been diagnosed with
lung cancer and started chemotherapy, a team spokesman said Monday
night.</LD>
<LD>   New Coach Marty Schottenheimer broke the news to the players at a
meeting, at Butler's request, spokesman Bill Johnston said.</LD>
<LD>   Butler, who turns 56 on Aug. 13, didn't immediately return a call
to his home and Schottenheimer was in a meeting and unavailable for
comment.</LD>
<TE>   Butler was diagnosed a few weeks ago, Johnston said. Butler quit
smoking during last season, Johnston said.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, the Chargers said that during Butler's
chemotherapy, "he is tending to business as usual and wants everyone
in the Chargers family to do the same. While he is grateful for the
kind thoughts and interest, he wants the entire organization to
remain focused on bringing a world championship to San Diego."</TE>

<TE>   Coach Mike Martz announced the signing after the second of two
practices. Earlier this week, he named Faulk team captain.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to make sure Marshall finishes his career as a Ram,"
Martz said. "The impact he's had not just on this team but this
entire organization is pretty extreme."</TE>

<TE>   Receiver Michael Westbrook will need surgery on his broken right

<HD>Pouting Fans Miss the Point of Clipper Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Darius Miles has been the high-haired, rim-rattling,
ceiling-scrapping symbol of the young and fun Clippers.</LD>
<LD>   Which makes it only right that he be traded to the Cleveland
Cavaliers for Andre Miller.</LD>
<LD>   It's time for the organization to go from young and fun to smart
and serious.</LD>
<TE>   It's time to trade dunks for defense, aerials for assists, flash
for focus.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the Clippers were cult heroes.</TE>
<TE>   Today, they are contenders.</TE>
<TE>   It should be difficult for even their most trendy fans to argue
with the merits of such a transformation, although many will
understandably try.</TE>
<TE>   Miles was a favorite. He was the future. He was flying into the
stands, dancing on the press table, blocking shots, drawing crowds.
All this, and he wasn't yet old enough to purchase the sort of
beverage with which he was frequently toasted.</TE>
<TE>   Many today will clench their fists and pat their headbands and
wonder, how could the Clippers do this?</TE>
<TE>   Easy. Ordinary. Like trading frappachino for Folgers.</TE>
<TE>   Enough of the cute, the Clippers said. It's time for something
more solid.</TE>
<TE>   Miles may never be strong enough to play effectively inside, and
hasn't worked hard enough to make an impact outside.</TE>
<TE>   If he becomes a superstar, it will only be with a drastic change
in body type or work habits. By the time that happens, the Clipper
momentum here could be lost.</TE>
<TE>   Push aside the bobble head doll long enough to check out these
statistics.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers didn't beat a playoff team in the final 30 days of
the season. They were 5-12 against the Western Conference in April.</TE>
<TE>   They collapsed despite having a hot center, one of the game's best
young power forwards, and one of its best sixth men.</TE>
<TE>   They collapsed because, quite simply, nobody held them together.</TE>
<TE>   By many accounts, Miller is that person.</TE>
<TE>   He played for a team that couldn't shoot straight, yet led the
league in assists. He looks to pass first, score second, yet still
averaged more points--16.5--than all but one Clipper.</TE>
<TE>   The best thing about his game was oddly illustrated during the
Rookie All-Star game in 2000. While completing a layup, he banked the
ball instead of dunking it. The crowd booed.</TE>
<TE>   Clipper fans should cheer.</TE>
<TE>   A team in need of a fundamentals role model has one. A team that
needs more local flavor will be led down the court by a kid who grew
up in Watts and led Verbum Dei High to a state championship before
leading Utah to the national championship game.</TE>
<TE>   There are some kinks, of course. With the Clippers, aren't there
always?</TE>
<TE>   Last year Miller, who averaged 37 minutes per game, allegedly
complained about playing so much.</TE>
<TE>   Considering Elton Brand also averaged 37 minutes, let's hope that
Miller was misunderstood.</TE>
<TE>   There was also talk that Miller was not critical enough with his
slacker teammates, another charge which will hopefully prove lame.
The Clippers need a vocal leader in his position, although perhaps
somebody not quite as vocal as his predecessor.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, some would say that the best thing about Miller is that he
is not Jeff McInnis, who draped himself over the team like a burlap
sheet.</TE>
<TE>   McInnis, for all his ability, was sharp-tongued and annoying both
in the locker room and on the court. If nothing else, Miller's
influence will be more like a down comforter.</TE>
<TE>   Who knows, maybe he can even get some consistency out of Lamar
Odom.</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, yeah, the Clippers know. You wanted them to trade Odom, not
Miles.</TE>
<TE>   And, yeah, that trade perhaps could have been done on draft day.</TE>
<TE>   But then it would have cost the Clippers a draft pick. This trade
did not cost them a draft pick, allowing the Clippers to keep big
guys Chris Wilcox and Melvin Ely.</TE>
<TE>   With Odom's history of off-court problems, trading him is not
going to be as easy as trading Miles.</TE>
<TE>   The Clipper fans are just going to have to hope he stays straight.</TE>
<TE>   Just as they must hope that a contract is settled soon with
Michael Olowokandi.</TE>
<TE>   With Miller, the Clippers may not be as hip, but their future has
more hop.</TE>

<HD>On Her Terms</HD>
<DH>Returning from major knee surgery, Davenport is not all
about No. 1</DH>

<DL>PALO ALTO</DL>
<LD>The rest of her life beckoned.</LD>
<LD>   A life without endless travel and endless practice and endless
battles with Serena and Venus Williams, who, Lindsay Davenport
admits, are so strong and fast and clever that it was getting to be
that maybe her best shot at beating the top two ranked women's tennis
players in the world was "to hope they made a lot of errors."</LD>
<LD>   Selling real estate. That wouldn't be bad, Davenport thought as
she sat with her crutches beside her, looking at the Pacific out the
windows of her Laguna Beach home. That might be easier than beating
Serena and Venus. But Davenport, 26, isn't ready for easy yet.</LD>
<TE>   She is tiptoeing back to the WTA Tour after undergoing complicated
surgery on her right knee in January.</TE>
<TE>   In her first tournament since limping off a court in Munich,
Germany, last January, Davenport made it to the semifinals of the
Bank of the West Classic at Stanford last week. She beat Anne Kremer
and Jelena Dokic and lost to Kim Clijsters in a three-set match that
Davenport led, 6-4, 4-2.</TE>
<TE>   What is clear is that Davenport's extraordinary ability to hit a
clean, hard, flat, penetrating ground stroke was untouched by her
surgery. What Davenport needs now is to gain strength and fitness.
"No matter how hard you work," Davenport says, "there's nothing that
can get you in tennis shape except playing tennis matches."</TE>
<TE>   So that's what Davenport is going to do. She is playing in the
Acura Classic at La Costa this week and in Manhattan Beach next week.
Her immediate aim is to just play and see what happens. "Talking
about winning the Open or beating Venus and Serena, I don't even
listen to that," Davenport says. "My focus now is to get better day
by day."</TE>
<TE>   Her future aim is to be totally fit for the start of 2003, to be
positioned physically and mentally to win more Grand Slam titles.
Davenport has one each of the Wimbledon, Australian and U.S. Open
trophies.</TE>
<TE>   Had she decided that her body had handled enough stress and
strain, and that 10 years of being a tennis pro was plenty, Davenport
could have used this injury as a convenient career-ender. She would
have left on top, having finished 2001 ranked No. 1. She would have
accomplished more than anyone had expected of the clumsy, pudgy
teenager who arrived on the circuit with gorgeous strokes and no idea
how to move her 6-foot-2 body.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had a lot of time to think," Davenport says. "What I am
absolutely sure of is that my desire to play tennis is as strong as
ever. I'm looking at this time off as a blessing in a way. I'm so
much fresher now. This might actually prolong my career because I
feel ready to play another two or three years."</TE>
<TE>   While Davenport and Martina Hingis, rehabilitating a serious ankle
injury, have been out of tennis, Venus and Serena Williams have taken
over. The sisters played each other in the finals of the French Open
and Wimbledon. Serena is ranked No. 1. Venus is No. 2. They have
found no one but each other to push them.</TE>
<TE>   Talented players such as Jennifer Capriati and Amelie Mauresmo
have dismissed the Williams' accomplishments as the sad result of
Davenport and Hingis being missing. In her nine months away from the
tour, Davenport became the hope of jealous players and unappreciative
fans who think she can break the Williams' logjam at the U.S. Open..</TE>
<TE>   "That's asking a bit much," Davenport says. "Venus and Serena are
playing great tennis. I hope I can. I don't know how long it will
take though. This is all new."</TE>
<TE>   Davenport had plenty of time to think after five holes had been
drilled into her knee because the cartilage was pretty much gone and
bone was rubbing on bone. There was plenty of time to consider a life
that didn't include taking her body on long, pounding runs across
hot, hard tennis courts all summer or the slippery grass in June or
the sticky, sluggish clay of April and May or the unforgiving indoor
surfaces of January and February.</TE>
<TE>   There was lots of time to dream about a life that didn't include
an airplane ride 40 weeks a year, one minus the rigid schedule of
hitting, running and lifting, one that instead might be filled with
childish games with a young niece or a romp in the yard with the
dogs. Or whatever, whenever. A life without the discipline of clean
living and days with precious little rest.</TE>
<TE>   "I only thought about that for a second," Davenport says. "Maybe
not even that long."</TE>
<TE>   Davenport had just wiped away a few tears and applied a smile that
wouldn't go away.</TE>
<TE>   She had played, and won, her first tennis match since Nov. 2.
Kremer, the beaten opponent in the second round of the Bank of the
West Classic, said with some awe that, "Lindsay doesn't seem any
different now than before."</TE>
<TE>   But Davenport is different.</TE>
<TE>   While she didn't win a Grand Slam last year, Davenport finished
the 2001 season with a spirited European vacation. Davenport won
three consecutive tournaments and flew home giggling because the WTA
rankings listed her as No. 1 for the season. If her right knee ached
and if she had to forfeit her last match because of the pain in her
knee, Davenport felt sure it would heal with rest.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't. It hurt after Davenport practiced for 10 or 20 minutes.
It hurt when she walked and even more when she ran. The holidays
passed and the knee didn't stop hurting. Doctors had told Davenport
to rest the knee and she did, and so what?</TE>
<TE>   "The pain wasn't going away," Davenport says. An MRI the first
week of January showed serious damage. In the only way Davenport can
describe her injury, "the bones were knocking together in the bottom
right part of my knee. The cartilage had fractured."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Richard Steadman performed surgery in Colorado and told
Davenport a simple truth: "It was going to take me a long time to
recover and there was no way to shorten the recovery," Davenport
says.</TE>
<TE>   "Nine and a half weeks on crutches. Putting my leg in this machine
that massaged my knee eight hours a day. I hated that machine, seeing
my knee atrophy and starting to work to get it back. I couldn't
drive. Everything that Dr. Steadman said was true."</TE>
<TE>   But she never paused to feel sorry for herself. "Lindsay made up
her mind to come back and never once did I have to push her," said
Robert Van't Hof, Davenport's coach and chauffeur and workout partner
and motivator. "In fact, more than once I had to slow her down."</TE>
<TE>   Davenport appeared in perfect physical shape last week. "You look
great, Lindsay," became a happy refrain around Stanford's Taube
Tennis Center. Davenport rolled up her sweats to show how muscle tone
is still missing from her right knee. But not much.</TE>
<TE>   However, that doesn't mean it's fair to expect Davenport to do
what no one else has done--stop the Williams train.</TE>
<TE>   "Venus and Serena are playing great tennis," Davenport says. "I
want to beat them. I think I have the game that can do it. But it's
not all up to me. It's up to everybody to get better. Venus and
Serena are challenging everybody and I know I want to accept the
challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "All I know is that I still love the game, the competition of it
all. I want to push myself. No matter how long a person plays, your
career is going to be a very short period of your life and I want to
make that period last."</TE>
<TE>   So she's back. On her terms. Not desperate to be No. 1, but
determined to win another Grand Slam tournament. Not seeing herself
as some savior, just back playing the game of her life.</TE>

<HD>Cardinals Win Rolen Sweepstakes</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Phillies finally unload All-Star third baseman,
sending him to St. Louis in a five-player deal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Scott Rolen should be much happier in his new red uniform.</LD>
<LD>   The slugging third baseman was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals
in a five-player deal on Monday, ending a seven-year tenure with the
Philadelphia Phillies that ended miserably.</LD>
<LD>   The Phillies get third baseman Placido Polanco, pitcher Bud Smith
and reliever Mike Timlin for the three-time Gold Glove winner, minor
league pitcher Doug Nickle and cash.</LD>
<TE>   "We are very pleased and excited to add Scott Rolen to our
lineup," Cardinal General Manager Walt Jocketty said in a statement.
"He is an All-Star, a proven run producer and an excellent defensive
player."</TE>
<TE>   Rolen, 27, is expected to join the Cardinals for tonight's game at
Florida. He becomes part of a powerful lineup that already features
Jim Edmonds, Albert Pujols and J.D. Drew.</TE>
<TE>   Rolen, who made his first All-Star team this season, is batting
.259 with 17 homers and 66 runs batted in. He goes from the
last-place Phillies to the first-place Cardinals, who lead the
National League Central by five games over Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Rolen had been the subject of trade rumors since rejecting a
10-year contract extension last November that could've been worth up
to $140 million. He signed an $8.6-million, one-year deal in January,
but made it clear he wanted to become a free agent after this season.
That decision forced the Phillies to make a move or risk losing him
for only two picks in next June's amateur draft.</TE>
<TE>   "I regret the outcome," Phillie General Manager Ed Wade said. "We
were very serious about the offer we made."</TE>
<TE>   Rolen did not sign an extension with the Cardinals, so he remains
eligible for free agency. However, he has said that he is interested
in signing a long-term deal with St. Louis. In the last five years,
the Cardinals traded for potential free agents Edmonds and Mark
McGwire and convinced them to stay.</TE>
<TE>   Polanco, 26, is hitting .284 with five homers and 27 RBIs. He
batted .307 last season and .316 in his first full year, in 2000.
Wade said he'll play third base and bat second in Philadelphia's
lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, who pitched a no-hitter in his rookie season last year, was
sent to triple-A Memphis on July 20 after going 1-5 with a 6.94
earned-run average in 11 appearances, including 10 starts. The
22-year-old left-hander was 6-3 with a 3.83 ERA in 16 games last year
and will report to triple-A Scranton Wilkes-Barre.</TE>
<TE>   Timlin is 1-3 with a 2.51 ERA in 42 appearances and is holding
righties to a .197 average. The 36-year-old right-hander is in the
final year of a contract that is paying him $5.25 million this
season.</TE>
<TE>   The deal was Wade's biggest since he traded Curt Schilling to
Arizona for first baseman Travis Lee, and pitchers Vicente Padilla,
Omar Daal and Nelson Figueroa in July 2000.</TE>

<HD>Bighorn Might Never Recover From His Visit</HD>

<DL>PALM DESERT</DL>
<LD>During the middle of my practice round Sunday on the Canyons Course
for Monday night's "Battle at Bighorn," some joker screamed "fore!"
while hitting into our threesome.</LD>
<LD>   I guess that was better than the authorities yelling, "Get off the
course, you jerk," but I'll tell you what, I let Tiger Woods have it
when he drove up in his cart, and while he just gave me a big grin
and apologized, his ball had hit the other fairway and it was obvious
he hadn't recovered from his British Open flop.</LD>
<LD>   That's why I played on, for the good of Tiger, leaving behind a
divot trail for him to follow in his engagement with Sergio Garcia. I
didn't think it would help Jack Nicklaus or Lee Trevino, though,
because they're a lot older and don't hit the ball as far as Tiger
and I do.</LD>
<TE>   Now don't get me wrong, I have nothing against old men playing
golf; it gets Sports Editor Bill Dwyre out of the office.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IN A span of nine holes, and a great Sunday afternoon on a great
golf course, I ran into Tiger, then a little later The Bear. Now
nothing against the slugs I was playing with, sports PR specialist
Steve Brener and Associated Press golf writer Doug Ferguson, but I
wish my dad could have lived long enough to brush shoulders quite by
accident with the two greatest golfers in the last 40 years. He loved
the game of golf, looked a lot like Jack, and swung the club like
Dwyre.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ANYONE WHO watched this same TV show a year ago with Annika
Sorenstam and Karrie Webb, playing like two bowlers who had just been
given golf clubs for the first time, had to appreciate the fact
organizers gave up on the idea of trying to convince people that
women play exciting golf. I know Bighorn owner R.D. Hubbard went
ahead and invited women to his golf tournament in Indiana a few
months ago, but from what I understand, it wasn't to play golf.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE GENERATIONAL gap in golf could be measured here easily in
driving yards. On the third hole Monday, Jack hit a driver 252 yards,
and Tiger hit his 327. Jack cranked it on the next hole 263 yards, so
Tiger hit his 330.</TE>
<TE>   Trevino said he got Tiger, however, telling Tiger that he couldn't
hit his two iron longer than Trevino's driver. "Got him by six
yards," Trevino said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TIGER BIRDIED nine of the 16 holes played, and because of two
birdie putts by Jack, Tiger never got the chance to putt out two
other birdie opportunities, which tells you what an incredible show
Tiger put on. "I think I did all right," smirked Tiger.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IN RESPONSE to a question about a plaschke column earlier this
week that suggested Tiger hadn't given any assistance to an
African-American golfer on a satellite tour, Tiger indicated he
hadn't read the column. I probably shouldn't offer any further
comment at this time.</TE>
<TE>   However, he did say, "I have never been asked for money to support
them. My foundation has helped junior golf ... we're about
education--not to become the best golfers in life. But to give them
hope."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TIGER MADE himself available to the Japanese media Sunday for more
than an hour to announce he will play in Japan. Woods reportedly will
receive a $2-million appearance fee for going to Japan, which raises
the question, how much would it be worth to the Dodgers for me not to
appear at their games?</TE>
<TE>   When asked what baseball position he would play, he told the
interviewer he'd be a pitcher. "It's a dream job. You get four days
off to play golf." I wonder if he'd demand a private plane for his
pleasure like another pitcher we know.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AFTER A three-year run in this oven, the made-for-TV event is
moving to The Bridges at Rancho Santa Fe just outside San Diego. I'm
told Phil Mickelson is a member at The Bridges. Next year, it might
be exciting to pit Mickelson against Tiger, giving Mickelson an
eight-up lead with nine to play and see if Mickelson closes him out
or chokes. It'd be compelling TV.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   76ER COACH Larry Brown, here for the golf, was asked by a reporter
whether he had heard about the Clippers' trade that has Darius Miles
going to Cleveland for Andre Miller and said, "Not Darius Miles."</TE>
<TE>   I also gathered by his comments that he doesn't think Clipper
owner Donald Sterling will pay Michael Olowokandi, Miller, Lamar Odom
and Elton Brand. He sounded like he knew what he was talking about.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AL MICHAELS, doing the broadcasting here for ABC, played the
Canyons Course on Sunday, but refused to divulge his score. I'm
guessing then it was higher than the mid-day temperature here.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AT DEL MAR on Sunday Ryan Leaf proved to be both a real winner and
real loser again. Leaf apparently won the trifecta in the ninth race,
which paid $546.40 for a $1 bet. Now most gamblers will play only $1
trifecta tickets to try to avoid the IRS, which requires a gambler to
sign for any payoff over $600. Leaf, however, played a $3 trifecta
ticket, which meant a payoff of $1,639.20. But when he was asked to
sign for the payoff, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune, Leaf
became upset and said: "Do you know who I am?"</TE>
<TE>   All together now: "The biggest stiff in NFL history."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes from a chat with Judd Swarzman at the
Battle at Bighorn:</TE>
<TE>   "My aunt, Doris Swarzman, for whatever reason, just loves your
column and she's a Dodger, fan, too. She's 94, has never been married
and..."</TE>
<TE>   How about if I fix her up with a Grocery Store Bagger I know?</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After evaluating 57 players in 37 matches over two years, Tracy Leone
finally made up her mind Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The former women's world champion and now coach of the United
States under-19 women's national team selected 18 players to compete
in the first FIFA Under-19 Women's World Championship in Canada next
month.</LD>
<LD>   The roster, which features four Californians, has six college
sophomores-to-be, eight incoming college freshmen, three high school
seniors-to-be and one surprise.</LD>
<TE>   The surprise is Ashlyn Harris, a 16-year-old from Satellite Beach,
Fla., who is the youngest player selected and also the team's backup
goalkeeper. If starting goalkeeper Megan Rivera is injured or ill,
Harris will be playing in the world championship.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very difficult roster to pick because we knew we had
more than 18 players who could help us," said Leone, who as Tracy
Bates was a member of the U.S. team that won the first FIFA Women's
World Championship (now the Women's World Cup) in China in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans begin play against England in Victoria, Canada, on
opening day of the Aug. 17-Sept. 1 tournament. They also play
Australia on Aug. 19 and Taiwan on Aug. 21 in the first round of the
12-nation event.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 37 preparatory and qualifying games the U.S. played during
the last two years, 17 were full internationals, and the U.S. went
15-1-1, outscoring opponents, 93-18.</TE>
<TE>   The full roster:</TE>
<TE>   Goalkeepers: Harris and Rivera. Defenders: Jessica Ballweg, Rachel
Buehler (Del Mar), Keeley Dowling, Kendall Fletcher and Amy Steadman.</TE>
<TE>   Midfielders: Lori Chalupny, Sarah Huffman, Manya Makoski, Jill
Oakes (West Hills), Leslie Osborne and Annie Schefter.</TE>
<TE>   Forwards: Megan Kakadelas (Carlsbad), Heather O'Reilly, Lindsay
Tarpley, Kelly Wilson and Angela Woznuk (El Cajon).</TE>
<TE>   WUSA All-Star Game Set</TE>
<TE>   The Women's United Soccer Assn. (WUSA) announced that the league
would stage its first All-Star game Sept. 21 at PGE Park in Portland,
Ore.</TE>
<TE>   The city is one of several being considered for an expansion
franchise by the eight-team league, said Tony DiCicco, the WUSA
commissioner and former world championship and Olympic gold
medal-winning coach of the U.S. women's national team.</TE>
<TE>   South African Cutbacks</TE>
<TE>   Two teams from South Africa's Premier Soccer League went out of
business Monday when the league bought and closed the Free State
Stars and Ria Stars to reduce its size from 18 teams to 16.</TE>
<TE>   Both teams had been struggling financially, and the reported
$785,000 that each received for folding, plus what they can receive
from the sale of their players, will relieve their debts. The move is
intended to ease scheduling problems and make the league more
competitive.</TE>
<TE>   Kubala Honored</TE>
<TE>   Hungarian-born Ladislao Kubala, who achieved fame as a player and
coach in Spain, was honored posthumously by FIFA.</TE>
<TE>   World soccer's governing body awarded him its Order of Merit for,
in the words of FIFA President Joseph "Sepp" Blatter, "the
distinguished services that he gave to football during his long
career."</TE>
<TE>   Kubala, who died in May at 74, scored 256 goals in 329 games for
Barcelona and helped the Catalan club win four Spanish league
championships, five Spanish Cups and two European Fairs Cups before
retiring in 1962.</TE>
<TE>   He coached Spain's national team from 1969 to 1980, producing a
record of 31-21-16, and also coached the national teams of Saudi
Arabia and Paraguay.</TE>
<TE>   Korea's Lee Signed</TE>
<TE>   Lee Eul-Yong, whose play in midfield helped South Korea earn
fourth place at the World Cup, signed a one-year contract with
Trabzonspor in the Turkish league.</TE>
<TE>   Lee, 26, scored one of South Korea's goals in a 3-2 loss to Turkey
in the game for third place and impressed Trabzonspor Coach Samet
Aybaba, who acquired him from Puchon of the K-League. Terms of the
contract were not revealed.</TE>
<TE>   Argentine to Coach Armenia</TE>
<TE>   Argentine Coach Oscar Lopez, who last season led Pyunik Yerevan to
the league and cup double in Armenia, Monday was named coach of the
country's national team.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement was made by Ruben Airapetyan, the oil tycoon
recently elected president of the Armenian soccer federation.</TE>
<TE>   "I came to the conclusion that Armenian coaches are just not
capable of achieving anything worthwhile in the international arena,"
Airapetyan said.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez, 65, might not have any better luck.</TE>
<TE>   Starting in September, Armenia will play Spain, Northern Ireland,
Ukraine and Greece in its qualifying group for the 2004 European
Championship in Portugal.</TE>

Houston in the race for the Western Conference title, the Sparks will
be trying to keep their record at home against the Eastern Conference
perfect. (The Sparks are 5-0 against the East at Staples Center this
season.) Spark guard Mwadi Mabika doesn't have the name recognition
of All-Star most valuable player Lisa Leslie, but she edged ahead of
Leslie as the team scoring leader after her 22-point performance in
the victory over Indiana Sunday. Mabika ranks seventh in the WNBA at
16.4 points a game. Leslie is eighth at 16.3. Miami, fifth in the
Eastern Conference, has lost three of its last four games, but the
victory was over New York. The Sparks have never lost to Miami, but
escaped with a 69-65 victory over then-winless Miami in May even

<HD>Stevens' Meet Jeopardized</HD>

<DL>DEL MAR</DL>
<LD>The future for Hall of Fame jockey Gary Stevens at the Del Mar meet
is in question after he took off his mounts Monday and Wednesday and
his agent said that he wouldn't be able to honor stakes commitments
here and at Saratoga this weekend.</LD>
<LD>   "Gary banged up one of his knees in the starting gate [last
weekend]," Craig O'Bryan, Stevens' agent, said. "He's supposed to see
the doctor Wednesday. But as far as anything else, I just don't know.
I know he won't be riding anymore this week and he'll miss the mounts
on Macho Uno and Investor's Dream this weekend."</LD>
<LD>   Stevens, 39, was scheduled to ride Macho Uno in the $750,000
Whitney Handicap at Saratoga on Saturday and was to be back at Del
Mar on Sunday to ride Investor's Dream in the $250,000 San Diego
Handicap.</LD>
<TE>   Stevens' arthritic knees have caused him much pain for years. He
underwent surgery to have a cyst removed from his right knee in 1999.
He announced his retirement in December of that year, but returned to
riding in October 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens rode only 74 times--winning five races--at the Hollywood
Park meet that ended July 21. Since Del Mar opened last Wednesday, he
has had a win.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens was to have ridden two horses here Monday. One of them,
Smart Lacy, was picked up by Kent Desormeaux, who rode the filly to
victory in the third race. Pat Valenzuela replaced Stevens on
Calista's Star in the seventh-race feature and finished third.
Desormeaux won that race with Serene In Seattle.</TE>

<HD>Mankamyer Nominated for Presidential Role</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. Olympic Committee's policymaking Executive Committee on
Monday nominated Colorado Springs real estate broker Marty Mankamyer
to be USOC president through 2004.</LD>
<LD>   Mankamyer, 68, the USOC's secretary, has served as acting
president since late May, when Sandra Baldwin resigned after
acknowledging discrepancies in the depiction of her academic
background on her USOC biography.</LD>
<LD>   Mankamyer prevailed Monday over Paul George, a USOC vice president
long active in the administration of winter sports, and Larry Hough,
a businessman who served as USOC treasurer in the early 1980s. The
counts from Monday's voting were not disclosed. Hough was eliminated
first, two sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.</LD>
<TE>   If confirmed by a majority of the USOC's 123-member board of
directors, Mankamyer would serve the remainder of what had been
Baldwin's term, through 2004. She has pledged to serve only the 2 1/2
years, no more. Confirmation is by no means assured. The USOC is
political, and as Mankamyer said Monday with a laugh, "It's not over
till the fat lady sings."</TE>
<TE>   The board will cast its ballots by mail. Ballots must be returned
by Aug. 14. The key constituency shapes up to be voters from what are
called NGBs, or "national governing bodies," the agencies that
oversee Olympic sports in the U.S.; under the USOC's complicated
weighted voting system, the NGBs control 50.1% of the votes.
Mankamyer is due to take part in a conference call with interested
NGB officials later this week.</TE>
<TE>   Mankamyer's base of support in the process to replace Baldwin has
been athletes and ex-athletes now serving in USOC positions--just as
it was for Baldwin. Mankamyer also has a unique ability to reach out
to NGB affiliates because she is, as she proudly calls herself, a
"soccer mom" who was long active in the U.S. soccer federation.</TE>
<TE>   Also in Mankamyer's favor is a point that speaks directly to the
USOC's political nature. If elected president, that would create a
vacancy at secretary--an appealing post from which to launch a 2004
presidential campaign.</TE>

<HD>It's a Big Mistake to Miss Catchings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The WNBA's rookie class of 2002 has been living up to expectations.</LD>
<LD>   The Connecticut quartet of Sue Bird (Seattle), Swin Cash
(Detroit), Asjha Jones (Washington), and Tamika Williams (Minnesota)
is accounting for 16.7% of their teams' points, rebounds and assists.</LD>
<LD>   The Mystics' Stacey Dales-Schuman has been a terrific complement
to Chamique Holdsclaw. Nikki Teasley, Tamara Moore, Felicia Ragland
and Kayte Christensen are making solid contributions in Los Angeles,
Minnesota, Seattle and Phoenix.</LD>
<TE>   But Tamika Catchings is the best of them all, even if the
Connecticut rookies are more high-profile.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Catchings isn't getting her due because she plays in Indiana
on a young team clawing for a playoff spot. Or because she missed
last season after tearing ligaments in her right knee during her
senior season at Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe people simply expect her to be good because her father,
Harvey, played 12 seasons in the NBA for Philadelphia, New Jersey,
Milwaukee and the Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   No matter, the 6-foot-1 Catchings, 23, has been a marvel.</TE>
<TE>   She is the top rookie scorer (17.7) and rebounder (8.2). Her 3.4
assists average is third among rookies, behind Bird and Teasley. She
was an Eastern Conference All-Star.</TE>
<TE>   And she doesn't rest on defense. Last week against Minnesota, she
became only the second WNBA player, and the first in four years, to
record nine steals in a game.</TE>
<TE>   But the best indicator is her impact on the team.</TE>
<TE>   With eight games left, the 10-14 Fever has already tied the team
record for wins in a season and has a realistic chance of stealing
the fourth playoff spot in the balanced East.</TE>
<TE>   So why isn't Catchings as celebrated as others in this year's
rookie crop?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," Indiana Coach Nell Fortner said. "If you can't see
it watching her play, I don't know what else it's going to take. She
does it in every phase of the game, on both ends of the floor.</TE>
<TE>   "Have enough people had a chance to see her? Probably not....
She's impressive enough that, in every city we've been in, she's
creating a buzz. I wish we would have won a little more, our record
was a little better. Maybe more folks would take notice."</TE>
<TE>   Catchings' response to her lack of national attention is a shrug
and a smile.</TE>
<TE>   "It's more important for me to help this team get into the
playoffs," she said. "Getting rookie of the year is not my main
concern.</TE>
<TE>   "I know my time will come, so I'm not tripping on people not
knowing who I am. Having sat out all last year--a couple of years
actually--and the players they're hyping are the ones who just came
out of college that came into the WNBA and are producing, it's one of
those things you take in stride."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps. But watch her unquenchable thirst for the game, her
relentless pursuit of rebounds, how more teams are resorting to the
clutch-and-grab form of defense to try and stop her--and then
consider how much better Catchings will be with more experience.</TE>
<TE>   Unless something drastic happens, Catchings should be a sure thing
as the league's top rookie when postseason awards are handed out.</TE>
<TE>   That's saying something in a rookie class this talented.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Portland's Jackie Stiles, last year's rookie of the year, is
having a sophomore season to forget.</TE>
<TE>   She was sabotaged first by bursitis in her right heel, which
sidelined her for 11 games. She has a bad right wrist that will
require surgery after the season, and her shoulder is giving her
problems as she tries to compensate for the wrist. Her aching feet
have taken away some quickness and jumping ability, making Stiles
easier to defend.</TE>
<TE>   A 15-point-per-game scorer last year, Stiles has averaged 5.1
points in 15 games. She has been spending more time on the bench as
Coach Linda Hargrove tries to maneuver the Fire into the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been a very challenging time," Stiles said. "I've never
been in this position; I never missed a game in college so this is
the first time I've had major injuries. I overcome something and I
get hit by something else.</TE>
<TE>   "But the team is playing great. I could have easily quit and had
surgery now, but I think maybe I can make some small contribution to
the team. And I spent a lot of hours in rehab just to get the few
minutes I get.</TE>
<TE>   "I love the game, I love to play, and I don't want to take the
easy way out. I want to do what I can to help."</TE>
