<HD>Hall Finds No Humor in 'Improv' Edit</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A little not-so-funny business is surrounding NBC's "Diet Coke With
Lemon Celebrates 40 Years of Laughter: At the Improv"--and not just
that title. The special, scheduled to air Tuesday at 8 p.m., is
planned as a tribute to the legendary Improv comedy club, where
comedians such as Richard Pryor, Robin Williams, Jerry Seinfeld and
Billy Crystal worked early in their careers.</LD>
<LD>   Jay Leno, Kevin Pollack, D.L. Hughley and Jay Mohr are among top
comedians who performed fresh stand-up material for the program
during a taping last month. But one participant isn't laughing.</LD>
<LD>   Arsenio Hall, who is featured prominently in ads and press
material for the show, said he was informed by producers last week
that he was being edited out because his material was too
"outrageous."</LD>
<TE>   "I didn't use any vulgarity or anything," Hall said. Among his
targets were James Brown, Anna Nicole Smith, Elvis Presley and Verne
Troyer, who plays Mini-Me in the "Austin Powers" films.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to Hall's ire is the fact that he had already performed
much of the material on "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno" and had
received a congratulatory call from NBC Entertainment President Jeff
Zucker. "I feel frustrated," he said. "I did two days of work for
this, and now my contribution is gone."</TE>
<TE>   An NBC spokeswoman said that every performer was being edited to
"some extent," and Hall was expected to appear. "There seems to be
some misunderstanding," she said.</TE>

<HD>Fund-Raiser to Benefit Lula's Dancers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Haithman</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On Saturday when the members of Lula Washington Dance Theatre take
the stage at the Orpheum Theater downtown, they'll be performing to
put a new roof over their heads.</LD>
<LD>   The company has been in a long-running legal battle with the city
of Los Angeles and the Community Redevelopment Agency over the fate
of its earthquake-damaged former studio on West Adams Boulevard. It
wanted to rebuild, but the city had a pending development option on
the property and, in the meantime, the dancers have been stuck in
cramped rental space. Last spring, LWDT pooled federal funds
originally earmarked for renovation of the old studio, and corporate
and foundation grants--to the tune of about $1.5 million--to purchase
and begin renovation on new digs on Crenshaw Boulevard.</LD>
<TE>   Now, says company executive director Erwin Washington, Lula's
husband, more money is required to get the onetime office building
into move-in condition. The completed project will cost $500 million;
the company hopes the fund-raiser will bring in about $20,000 to
allow construction, halted due to lack of funds, to start up again.
That money, however, will only last about three weeks: "$350,000 is
what we need for raw, rough renovation; we can phase the rest in over
time," Erwin Washington said. Saturday's program includes signature
company works, appearances by Lula Washington's Youth Dance Ensemble
and Young Drummers of Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Snoop Dogg Pledges a No-Joint Effort</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You might be able to imagine Garth Brooks without his cowboy hat or
Britney Spears without the bare midriff ... but Snoop Dogg without a
joint in his hand? It may be a pipe dream, but the chronic king of
hip-hop has announced that he is abstaining from marijuana as well as
alcohol.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm 30 years old now," the rapper told BET in a recent interview.
"Three kids. A wife. A mom. Brothers. Artists. Family. Friends. They
all need me. They depend on me. I've been leading [homeboys] off the
cliff for five, six years. So now I'm going slow."</LD>
<LD>   This is shocking news considering that Snoop was named the 2002
Stoner of the Year by High Times magazine and has made a habit of
openly toking before, during and after his concerts and interviews.
He has been, arguably, the most public pothead performer since Bob
Marley.</LD>
<TE>   On the Internet, the surprise announcement has been met with
consternation and intense skepticism by the rapper's fans. They need
not fear that the rapper is adopting a completely ascetic life:
Thursday night, Snoop will perform at a Los Angeles club to celebrate
the release this week of "Girls Gone Wild Doggy Style," which teams
the rhyming lothario with the video and DVD franchise built on
capturing footage of young women exposing themselves in public.</TE>
<TE>   Will Snoop be sneaking a puff at the club event when no one is
looking? If so, it wouldn't surprise High Times entertainment editor
Steve Bloom, who says it's possible that the announcement is not a
true change of heart. The rapper was fined and placed on probation
for a pot offense in Ohio last year.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the biggest, baddest pot smoker out there, and maybe he's
just stepping back because it got too hot," Bloom said. "Maybe he
really has decided he wants to take a break or not smoke anymore. But
all this could be a smokescreen."</TE>

<HD>Playboy Unveils Satellite Radio Show</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Carney</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Picking up the argument that indignant readers of the magazine have
made for four decades--it's not just the pictures--Playboy Radio
debuts Tuesday as a new channel on XM Satellite Radio.</LD>
<LD>   " 'It's not just about the visuals.' That's been the joke about
the magazine forever," said Scott Barton, national public relations
director for the Playboy Entertainment Group. "Sex is all in the
mind. You don't need to see it to get the information or intent."</LD>
<LD>   Weekdays from 4 to 7 p.m., the new channel will air "Night Calls,"
the radio version of the live phone-in program that has run on
Playboy's cable TV channel for eight years. According to its program
guide, "On this carnal call-in show, you can share your wildest
sexperiments on the air with our lusty late-night hosts Juli Ashton
and Tiffany Granath."</LD>
<TE>   "It's an opportunity for mature adults to talk openly and
spontaneously about anything sensual," Barton said, and will also
include demonstrations and adult-film star interviews. The live radio
show is separate from the twice-monthly television show, and the rest
of Playboy Radio's schedule during the week will feature repeats of
previous "Night Calls" radio programs.</TE>
<TE>   The service, the first premium channel XM has offered since it
launched in September 2001, costs $2.99 a month on top of XM's
regular monthly fee of $9.99. XM, like its only competitor in the
industry, New York-based Sirius, beams signals from satellites to
subscribers' receivers nationwide, offering 100 channels of music,
news, sports and information, with a programming diversity not
available on most terrestrial radio--akin to the difference between
cable and broadcast television. XM has about 140,000 subscribers.</TE>

<HD>Rowdy Ozzfest Does Justice to Metal's Icon</HD>
<DH>The crowd of 43,000 fans shows noisy appreciation for the
younger bands as well as to Ozzy Osbourne and his well-known family.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFF BOUCHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Ozzfest is a county fair with a county jail attitude. It's a
loud, gritty, exhausting, decadent affair that inspires fans of both
genders to strip their shirts, bob their heads at
vertebrae-threatening velocity and bark at the moon. Or, since it
starts at 9 a.m., the sun.</LD>
<LD>   The show, of course, takes its name from Ozzy Osbourne, the
British metal hero who was born during the Truman administration and
has become the most unlikely pop culture sensation of the 21st
century. Like the Cher of the occult rock scene, Osbourne has gone
from afterthought to beloved iconic elder because of the unscripted
and gloriously odd MTV reality series "The Osbournes."</LD>
<LD>   The question at the Glen Helen Blockbuster Pavilion in Devore on
Saturday was whether the 43,000 fans would find Osbourne's rock show
equally as entertaining, especially after thunderous sets by System
of a Down, P.O.D. and even the cartoonish Rob Zombie.</LD>
<TE>   The answer, as is so often the case in these settings, was in the
lighters. The dense crowd that jammed the front seats and the vast
lawns of this desert venue produced enough candle-power with their
Bics during Osbourne's set to skew any local global warming surveys
that might have been underway.</TE>
<TE>   Even Ozzy (think how many lighters he has seen held aloft) looked
impressed, although he never stopped exhorting the crowd to cheer
louder. "I can't heeeaaaar you," he screeched again and again, often
adding his favorite f-word to the phrase for emphasis. If you closed
your eyes, he sounded like a salty-mouthed grandmother making a long
distance call.</TE>
<TE>   It is both easy and risky to mock Osbourne these days. He has
always been a blue-collar metal hero, known for his unpretentious
personal manner and devotion to the genre's requisite standards of
sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. His legendary excesses, however, have
left the 53-year-old in a fragile state, with shaking hands and stage
maneuvers that resemble nothing so much as light-impact aerobics in a
physical therapy ward.</TE>
<TE>   Osbourne came armed Saturday with two hand-held water cannons that
he used frequently to douse the fans in the pit. With the elaborate
water guns, his black costume and feeble menace, he looked like
nothing so much as one of the harmless villains from the 1960s
"Batman" television show. Adding to that illusion were his brawny
bandmates, the lead henchman being guitar master Zakk Wylde, whose
stage prowl and intense solos helped Osbourne fill out the stage for
the rear of the sold-out crowd.</TE>
<TE>   No matter that Osbourne is not as robust as in his Black Sabbath
days, his Halloween songbook of "Paranoid," "Iron Man," "Mr. Crowley"
and the rest clicked strongly with the crowd, which skewed young and
made clear--through interviews, their cheering decibels and T-shirt
logos--that they were in the house to see System of a Down, P.O.D,
Adema and the younger bands.</TE>
<TE>   The graybeard Ozzy fans in the mix brought a sense of amused
bewilderment about their idol's transformation via TV into a new type
of rock star. Todd Winters shuttled his two wide-eyed sons, ages 12
and 9, in from Dana Point for the show. "We drove by Ozzy's house
last week in Beverly Hills just to see it too," Winters said. "I've
always loved Ozzy. I saw him 25 years ago in concert. It is kind of
weird to see what's happened with the show."</TE>
<TE>   The audience of the MTV show is by no means colossal (the show,
with its 7.8 million viewers, is dwarfed by even middling hits on the
network), but its valued demographic, critical acclaim and just plain
weirdness have made it a pop culture touchstone of the moment. It's
also made celebrities out of the rocker's brood: son Jack, daughter
Kelly and wife Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon Osbourne is the metal matron not only of the TV show but
also of her husband's career and Ozzfest, which was launched seven
years ago. The formula for the festival was ingenious: Young metal
bands still adored Osbourne and the Black Sabbath legacy, so Ozzfest
would unite them under his banner. It also meant Ozzy would be
performing for larger crowds, giving him an infusion of relevance
and, with those young fans, perhaps a new market for his catalog.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to respect Ozzy and Sharon as business people," said
Marky Chavez, lead singer of Adema, the young Bakersfield band that
made it as a main stage performer this tour. "There's always going to
be baby bands that want exposure and that people want to come see.
And there's people who want to see Ozzy because of what he's done in
all entertainment fields. I hope I can look back on my career and say
I've done what he's done."</TE>
<TE>   A major theme of the day was the health of Sharon Osbourne, who
would typically have been a major presence at this key Southern
California date. She is recuperating from surgery related to her
recently diagnosed colon cancer, and her health was the topic of
wildly divergent rumors and heartfelt expression of support both in
the audience and backstage.</TE>
<TE>   "She has good days and she has bad days," guitarist Wylde said
backstage as he waited for a daylight performance by his own band,
Black Label Society. "That's what cancer is. Ozzy missed a few shows
but then Sharon sent him back out. If he didn't do this, if he didn't
perform, he would just sit at home and worry about her. And probably
get wasted just to get his mind off of it all."</TE>
<TE>   Wylde said the success of the TV show has only shown the world the
Ozzy he has called friend since the 1980s--a funny fellow who has a
hard time dealing with his kids and pets but also happens to be a
rock star. "The thing is, Ozzy always gets nervous when things go
well. He thinks something is always going to screw him up. The show
has been great, but now, with this ..."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly Osbourne said Saturday that her mother was improving. "She's
doing fine, things are going well," she said, before hustling off to
prepare for her own moment on the Ozzfest stage. She had been
performing the song "She Is Beautiful" on the main stage during the
daylight set with young metal singer Andrew W.K., and her arrival on
stage about 4:30 brought many of the milling fans to their feet.
Ozzfest, post-"The Osbournes," is as much about gawk as rawk when it
comes to the first family of metal.</TE>
<TE>   After Kelly's vamping performance, it would be five hours before
that other cast member of "The Osbournes" arrived on stage. The time
was filled with music that veered wildly across the metal landscape.</TE>
<TE>   There were also acknowledgments throughout the day to Dave
Williams, lead singer of Drowning Pool, whose body was found last
month on the band's tour bus in Manassas, Va. The 30-year-old Texan's
official cause of death is pending, but many in and around the
Ozzfest village chalked it up as another casualty of rock excess. A
poster of the charismatic singer was affixed to a speaker stack on
the main stage, offering a somewhat sobering juxtaposition to the
many songs celebrating booze, drugs and nihilism.</TE>
<TE>   The most powerful and memorable musical moments clearly belonged
to System of a Down and P.O.D. The latter, the San Diego quartet that
mixes punk and thudding metal with nuances of reggae and hip-hop, was
a fresh change with its uplift and willingness to eschew the heavy
metal tough talk without sacrificing an ounce of musical power.</TE>
<TE>   For its hit, "Youth of the Nation," the band surrendered part of
the stage to youngsters from the crowd to chime in on the chorus, and
lead singer Sonny Sandoval, beaming, carried one young boy on his
shoulders as he performed the sensitive song that was inspired, in
part, by the spate of school shootings in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   System of a Down followed with its singular brand of mad sonic
collage. Chants, rants, sound effects, howls and shards of music go
into the mix, and manic lead singer Serj Tankian seemed at times like
an Armenian-heritage version of Frank Zappa with his surreal humor,
musicianship and, well, impressive beard. They sang of chop suey, sex
and tapeworms, they performed chunks of songs by Dire Straits and
Madonna (honest), and proudly displayed their anti-war politics and
disdain for the CIA.</TE>
<TE>   The show's finale, Osbourne himself, was preceded by a truly funny
five-minute video spoof showing the game veteran offering
pornographic advice in a Miss Cleo-like costume and interacting, via
clever edits, with Madonna, Jennifer Lopez, the cast of "Sex and the
City" and others.</TE>
<TE>   The bombast of his biggest songs filled the night, and he
predictably mooned the crowd and collected bras tossed to his feet.
But the real Ozzy of 2002 came through when the singer apologized for
any lapses in his performance. "My old lady's not in the house," he
said of his ailing wife, and he seemed suddenly not the madman in
black, but the family man dealing with heartache. When he sang "Mamma
I'm Coming Home" a few minutes later, you got the feeling he wanted
to do exactly that.</TE>

and directed by Robby Henson, and starring Oscar-winner Billy Bob
Thornton, was about to be orphaned.</LD>
<LD>   Thornton plays a small-town Louisiana sheriff in "The Badge," a
movie that originally was to be a theatrical film. Instead, it shows
up Saturday at 8 p.m. on Starz. The name-rich cast includes Patricia
Arquette, William Devane, Jena Malone, Thomas Hayden Church, Tom
Bower, Julie Hagerty, Sela Ward, Rick Dial and Hill Harper.</LD>
<LD>   "The Badge" was made a week or so before Thornton went to work on
last year's "Monster's Ball," said Henson. In both films, Thornton
plays a Southern lawman who confronts his own bigotry.</LD>
<TE>   "There are differences," said Henson. "Mine is more of a
traditional leading-man role: He tells jokes in the beginning,
struggles and rights his boat. Even though he has demons, they're not
as dark as in 'Monster's Ball.' "</TE>
<TE>   The story opens as a woman in a red dress dashes across a highway
at night, causing an 18-wheeler to jackknife and spill its load of
shoes. Notified of the wreck the next day, Thornton, as Sheriff Darl
Hardwick, sets about distributing the footwear to local folks. Then
his deputies find the woman face down in the swamp, and there is
speculation that she may have been alive while the sheriff was
passing out shoes. At the morgue, the medical examiner finds that
"she" is a "he"--with a bullet in his back. Enter Arquette as a New
Orleans stripper who says she's the wife of the victim.</TE>
<TE>   Henson said Starz was the white knight for "The Badge," his second
theatrical film. "After [original producer] Propaganda Films went
bankrupt during post-production of the film, and it was kind of
orphaned, Starz stepped in and has been very good for the film. Lions
Gate has the theatrical and home video rights."</TE>
<TE>   "We are always on the lookout for quality films," said Stephen
Shelanski, vice president of program acquisitions, planning and
scheduling for Starz Encore Entertainment. He saw "The Badge" at a
Los Angeles film showcase, he said, and "within a day, we had the
deal done."</TE>
<TE>   "We were convinced this was a high-quality film. It also has a
strong supporting cast.... We can bring these films to a much broader
audience than would see them in theaters."</TE>
<TE>   Although the Starz Encore channels are less well-known to most
viewers than premium channels such as HBO and Showtime, those
channels and their corporate siblings have considerable international
reach.</TE>
<TE>   Starz Encore reaches around the globe. Founded as Encore Media
Corp. in 1991 by John J. Sie, who is still chairman and chief
executive, and renamed Starz Encore in 1999, the company is the
country's largest provider of cable and satellite-delivered premium
channels through its 15 domestic channels, most of them digital.</TE>
<TE>   As Encore Media, Sie's company was the first in the industry to
offer a premium subscription video-on-demand service. Revenue growth
for the company increased from $640 million to more than $863 million
from 1999 to 2001.</TE>
<TE>   A Rising Star</TE>
<TE>   Sie, who came to the United States from Shanghai when he was 13,
rose to prominence as senior vice president at media tycoon John
Malone's Jerrold Electronics, where he helped develop interactive
television.</TE>
<TE>   He went on to Showtime and TCI before heading up Starz Encore, a
subsidiary of Malone's Liberty Media Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Headquartered in Englewood, Colo., Starz Encore owns Starz, which
is in 14 million homes, and Encore, "nearing 20 million homes," said
Marc McCarthy, executive director of communications; as well as Black
Starz and Starz Cinema. Starz and Encore are available to analog
subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, top-ranked HBO/Cinemax claims 38 million
subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   Sie's company also offers satellite and digital cable subscribers
the genre channels Love Stories, Action, Mystery, Westerns, True
Stories, Starz Family and WAM for children. Its MOVIEplex is a
sampler offering films grouped by daily themes from the digital movie
channels.</TE>
<TE>   Starz Encore also offers Starz on Demand, a premium subscription
video-on-demand service. In August, Starz Encore teamed up with
DirecTV and TiVo to test the service over satellite.</TE>
<TE>   Starz Encore Entertainment, a division of Starz Encore Group,
finances and produces films (such as "Skins" and "Tortilla Soup") and
documentaries (including "Hopalong Cassidy: Public Hero No. 1") and
the series "The Directors." Movies made under the Starz Pictures
banner include "Funny Valentines," "Bruno" and "Relative Values."</TE>
<TE>   Its International Channel Networks provides movies, news, sports
and general entertainment in 26 Asian, European and Middle Eastern
languages to subscribers in the United States and Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   Encore International Inc., an affiliate of Starz Encore, was
founded in 1995 to develop programming and channels for international
distribution, with a focus on Asia. EI is 90% owned by Liberty Media
Group and 10% by Sie's JJS II Communications LLC.</TE>
<TE>   Through an agreement with China Central Television, EI supplies
programming that airs daily in prime time on CCTV's general
entertainment network.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange, Chinese programming from CCTV is shown on Starz
Encore's International Channel here.</TE>

<LD>MTV's "Video Music Awards" set a ratings record for the cable network
Thursday, averaging an estimated 11.9 million viewers--the largest
audience in the annual showcase's 19-year history.</LD>
<LD>   Tune-in for the awards was good enough to easily surpass all the
broadcast networks (who almost uniformly aired reruns) for the night,
even though MTV is available in fewer homes.</LD>
<LD>   The awards have clearly become an event, with the number of
households watching roughly nine times what MTV has attracted on an
average night this summer. The rating also represented a 5% increase
over last year.</LD>
<TE>   According to breakdowns from Nielsen Media Research, nearly
two-thirds of those viewing the awards fell into the 12-to-34 age
bracket, which represents MTV's core audience.</TE>
<TE>   Jimmy Fallon of "Saturday Night Live" was the awards show's host.</TE>

<HD>TV Networks Believe There's Gold in Them Thar Hillbilly
Shows of Yesteryear</HD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Days after CBS disclosed it was planning a new reality series
inspired by "The Beverly Hillbillies," Fox said is borrowing the
concept of another classic rural sitcom, "Green Acres," for a show of
its own.</LD>
<LD>   A Fox spokesman said the network is developing a reality series
that, similar to the original "Green Acres," turns the idea of "The
Beverly Hillbillies" on its head by transplanting upper-crust
yuppie-types from the big city to a rural setting and surrounding
them with farm animals and plain folks with drawls.</LD>
<LD>   Cameras will follow members of an erstwhile high-society family,
cut off from their luxury cars, health clubs and bank accounts, as
they move into rustic new digs, go about finding work, buy groceries
and generally hobnob with the hoi polloi.</LD>
<TE>   Last month, CBS said its talent scouts were fanning out across the
backwoods of America in search of a rural family willing to move into
a Beverly Hills mansion for a separate show tentatively titled "The
Real Beverly Hillbillies."</TE>
<TE>   The "Green Acres" reality concept has been in development for
several weeks by Bunim-Murray Productions, which makes MTV's "The
Real World," Fox spokesman Scott Grogin said.</TE>
<TE>   Fox said the project was still in its early stages, with no time
frame set for actual production or launch.</TE>
<TE>   Also unknown is whether the series will even use the name "Green
Acres," as neither Fox nor Bunim-Murray owns rights to the title.
"Green Acres," which aired from 1965 to 1971, starred Eddie Albert
and Eva Gabor as a highly successful Manhattan lawyer and his
glamorous wife who give up their cosmopolitan life and penthouse
apartment to live on a farm near the fictional small town of
Hooterville.</TE>
<TE>   The show was closely intertwined with "Petticoat Junction,"
another rural sitcom created in the wake of the success of "The
Beverly Hillbillies"--which was about a backwoods family from the
Ozarks who strike oil and move their household into a Beverly Hills
mansion next door to a greedy banker.</TE>
<TE>   All three series aired on CBS during the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Fox also reported that "The Rats," a made-for-TV movie
about rats invading the Big Apple, will make its belated debut this
month.</TE>
<TE>   The movie about an invasion of lab rats into the sewers of New
York will finally see the light of day on Sept. 19, a year and two
days after it was originally set to debut, according to Fox
spokeswoman Julie Verville.</TE>
<TE>   But in an acknowledgment that all is not the same in New York, the
network edited out two background scenes showing the twin towers that
were destroyed in the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The major networks went to uninterrupted, around-the-clock news
coverage in the days after the attacks, preempting all other
scheduled shows.</TE>
<TE>   "The scenes were edited out to make [the movie] more current,"
Verville said. "There was nothing happening to the World Trade
Center. Sensitivity was also a factor, but it was also to bring it up
to date."</TE>
<TE>   Fox's decision to delay the debut of "The Rats," shot in March
2001, for more than a year was less a product of concerns over taste
and suitability and more due to scheduling issues, Verville said.</TE>
<TE>   "We just didn't have a time slot up until this point," she said.</TE>

<KH>An Appreciation</KH>
<HD>Celebrating Hampton's Incredible Vibe</HD>
<DH>The jazz vibist was the distinct voice of a generation.
Even in the last stages of his life, he reveled in his art.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Lionel Hampton gave his last performance in Los Angeles--a 90th
birthday celebration in 1998 at the Ford Amphitheatre--his
indomitable spirit was still willing, even though his familiar,
high-spirited physical vigor had been dimmed by a series of strokes.
But no matter. Though he had to remain seated to play his vibes and
was clearly incapable of whipping off the lightning-fast runs that
had been his stock in trade for nearly seven decades, his remarkable
sense of swing was still present in every modest note he played.</LD>
<LD>   Someone once said that Louis Armstrong only had to play one note
to define what the sense of swing was all about. The crispness of his
articulation, the urgency of the tone, the anticipatory feeling of
propulsion with which he finished the note--they all contributed to
the lift and movement essential to the almost indescribable feeling
we know as swing.</LD>
<LD>   Exactly the same can be said of Hampton, who died Saturday in New
York City at 94. His mastery of swing was never more apparent than it
was on that cool October night in 1998. Distressing as it was to see
him debilitated, one knew that so long as he could hold a vibes
mallet, the resulting sound would be well worth hearing--as it always
had been, from the first day in 1930 when Hampton played the
instrument, virtually on the spot, in a Louis Armstrong recording
session.</LD>
<TE>   As a drummer, Hampton knew mallet instruments such as the
vibraphone have limited resources for tonal variation. Their
effectiveness lies in the articulation with which they are played, as
well as the inherent drive that gifted artists bring to the
instrument.</TE>
<TE>   That's not easy. The best evidence of its difficulty is in the
relatively small list of high-level jazz vibists who have evolved
over the century-long history of jazz. Mention Hampton, Red Norvo,
Milt Jackson, Terry Gibbs, Bobby Hutcherson and Stefon Harris, and
you've covered most of the major names. There have been others, such
as Cal Tjader and Roy Ayers, but only a few artists who define the
genre.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't matter whether Hampton was playing within the
Swiss-watch perfection of a Benny Goodman small ensemble,
energetically leading his own roaring big band--an artistic incubator
for players ranging from Clifford Brown and Dexter Gordon to Quincy
Jones and Betty Carter--or simply reliving his past hits for
audiences who couldn't get enough of "Flyin' Home" or "Hamp's Boogie
Woogie." The results were always the same: an incomparable blend of
accessibility and artistry.</TE>
<TE>   Hampton was a defining voice for a generation of musicians who
understood that it was possible to entertain without sacrificing
one's quest for inventiveness. And he did so with consummate skill.</TE>
<TE>   It was typical of Hampton that, when I spoke with him prior to the
1998 performance, he preferred to concentrate upon the hot band he
was bringing to the Ford, enthusiastically lauding its "great trumpet
section," its "great high-note lead trumpet player," its "great tenor
player."</TE>
<TE>   "Believe me," he said, "it'll still have all the juice."</TE>
<TE>   Left behind in his exhilaration over the music was any sense of
remorse over the strokes he had recently suffered, or the
catastrophic New York City apartment fire that had destroyed so many
of his treasured possessions.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the dozens of marvelous recorded performances, that
is the Lionel Hampton I prefer to remember: the Hampton who was still
capable and still captivated by the music in the final stages of his
life; the Hampton who was always thrilled by new players, new music
and new possibilities; the Hampton who never stopped celebrating the
joy and the wonder of making jazz.</TE>

<LD>There's a downside to writing columns at home instead of at a
newspaper. To many people that means you're not really working and
have time to schmooze on the phone.</LD>
<LD>   The very idea.</LD>
<LD>   When several of these thoughtless, gabby types called one day last
week, for example, I gave each the same terse response: "Can't talk,
I'm watching baseball."</LD>
<TE>   Well ... somebody has to do it.</TE>
<TE>   With Friday's strike deadline looming, I spent hours absorbing
baseball the way a squirrel gathers nuts for winter and a bear
fattens up for hibernation. Taking no chances, I was storing memories
to see me through a potentially barren fall, for no one knew then if
the game's obscenely rich owners and their kadzillionaire slaves
would break their impasse.</TE>
<TE>   Their window of opportunity narrowed Friday morning, their Rolexes
winding down suspensefully as cable's news channels awaited the
results of their talks, even staking out Wrigley Field in Chicago to
see if the St. Louis Cardinals would arrive for their scheduled game
with the Cubs.</TE>
<TE>   By now you know what happened. A strike was averted. So the
baseball season goes on, along with the joy in watching much of it on
TV.</TE>
<TE>   What I would have missed most are those sweetheart telecasts of
the Atlanta Braves on TBS. What I would have missed least are ESPN's
bobble heads. Don't care much for some of the Great Vin's patter,
either.</TE>
<TE>   TBS is cable's idiot savant. It's freakish that Atlanta's
Superstation would execute baseball telecasts so expertly, because
the rest of its TV schedule is utterly mundane. For a true view into
its rerun-laden soul, observe that vast library of violent,
smash-'em-up, police-chase footage that it draws on incessantly to
fill time during Braves rain delays.</TE>
<TE>   Years of watching the Braves on TV, though, have made them my
favorite, and the likable, refreshingly unslick TBS broadcast crew of
Pete Van Wieren, Skip Carey, Don Sutton and Joe Simpson my favorite
announcing team. These low-key mavens are not only smart, funny and
chatty, but effortlessly so, with ex-major leaguers Sutton and
Simpson notably astute about baseball's finer points without being
repetitive or arcane.</TE>
<TE>   They avoid irritating gimmicks and wear extremely well. They also
call games fairly despite their acknowledged Braves bias and, as a
wonderful bonus, never usurp play on the field. The purpose of a
baseball telecast is baseball, right? On TBS, the game, not the
announcing team, is star.</TE>
<TE>   Compare that with the personality-driven credo at ESPN and ESPN2
that--surely a management decision--often requires that extraneous
shtick be used to eclipse what happens on the field. The offenders
range from Chris Berman, who often treats baseball as Muzak for his
monologues, to even Jon Miller, whose ample talent is compromised in
his role as point man for ESPN comedy routines inside the booth. If
only his sidemen were as amusing as he.</TE>
<TE>   In this loopy universe, even former Reds great Joe Morgan, one of
TV's best baseball minds and an able communicator, is cast as
comedian. The problem is that Morgan is as funny as a bean ball. Even
more painfully awkward is Tony Gwynn, still a work in progress behind
the mike after his magnificent career with the San Diego Padres.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, ESPN too often is where the action isn't. Its
announcers recently became fixated on the spiky hairstyles of one
team's players, and for half an inning the cameras devoted more time
to these guys in the dugout than to the game.</TE>
<TE>   When ESPN telecast a recent Braves loss to the Dodgers, moreover,
it missed Atlanta shortstop Rafael Furcal starting an extraordinary
double play by knocking down a hot shot behind second and feeding
Keith Lockhart from the ground. Where was ESPN? Showing viewers a Vin
Scully retrospective.</TE>
<TE>   Remember, it's the game, stupid.</TE>
<TE>   As for Scully, the Dodgers' widely adored radio-TV voice is
unquestionably as meticulous at his craft and as knowledgeable about
baseball as anyone in the business. Like the Braves announcers, he's
also extremely fair and as apt to praise opposing players as Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   But c'mon, haven't you had it up to here with those cutesy
cutaways to kids in the stands, on Fox Sports Net 2 and UPN 13, so
that Scully can coochy coo them from the booth? As in, "Oh, bless
your heart" or "Oh, yes, it's thumb-sucking time on the old
plantation." Aaarrrggghhh!!! All right, he likes kids. Message
received.</TE>
<TE>   Although his veteran radio partner, Ross Porter, is renowned for
pouring on meaningless trivia, Scully is equally guilty. He just
packages it more elegantly.</TE>
<TE>   But be honest, don't you find his celebrated glibness with
literary references more than a little mannered, as if he had written
down and numbered them for use in specific situations?</TE>
<TE>   When I first moved to L.A., I wondered why Dodger announcers
worked solo, when so many other teams used twosomes in the booth. The
answer, of course, is that farce would result should Scully and
Porter ever work together. Just imagine:</TE>
<TE>   Vin: Shawn Green really hammers it, and it's gone! Or as Margaret
Mitchell would say, "Gone With the Wind."</TE>
<TE>   Ross: Did you know, Vin, 17 major leaguers have mothers named
Margaret?</TE>
<TE>   Vin: And Green crosses home, as if told by Thomas Wolfe, "Look
Homeward, Angel."</TE>
<TE>   Ross: A wolf has never bitten a Dodger, Vin. No wolverine bites
either.</TE>
<TE>   Vin: I'd like to take a bite out of that little darlin' sitting
with her dad eating her ice cream cone. Isn't she great. As great as
Gatsby.</TE>
<TE>   Ross: Only three National League southpaws have eaten ice cream in
West Covina, Vin. Not one of them has a brother named Hercule.</TE>
<TE>   Vin: Agatha Christie wouldn't like that, as the pop-up will end
the inning.</TE>
<TE>   Ross: A few National League umpires call their dads pop, Vin, but
interestingly, not one of them says papa, poppie or popsie.</TE>
<TE>   Vin: Speaking of Papa Hemingway ...</TE>

<HD>Series Pays Tribute to a Pioneering Cast of Latino Actors</HD>
<DH>Television* Turner Classic Movies launches Hispanic
Heritage Month today with a weekly schedule of films as well as
interviews with the performers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Thank god for these wonderful actors like Jennifer Lopez, Andy
Garcia, Jimmy Smits and Antonio Banderas whom we have today," says
Luis Reyes, author of "Hispanics in Hollywood."</LD>
<LD>   "But contrary to popular belief," he adds, "Hispanics have been
part of the Hollywood film industry since the beginning."</LD>
<LD>   Cable's Turner Classic Movies is shining the spotlight on these
Latino pioneers with its Hispanic Heritage Month film series. Every
Monday throughout the month will be devoted to Latinos who worked in
front of and behind the camera.</LD>
<TE>   The festival will also feature interstitial interviews with Rita
Moreno, Ricardo Montalban, Maria Conchita Alonso, as well as Reyes,
who will talk about the myths of Latinos in Hollywood. The actors
will discuss their own careers, role models and compromises they had
to make.</TE>
<TE>   Among the Latino actors highlighted in the festival are Rita
Hayworth ("The Lady From Shanghai," "You Were Never Lovelier"),
Montalban ("Fiesta"), Lupe Velez ("Mexican Spitfire's Baby"), Moreno
("West Side Story"), Anthony Quinn ("The Guns of Navarone"), Jose
Ferrer ("Moulin Rouge," "I Accuse"), Cesar Romero ("Vera Cruz") and
Dolores Del Rio ("The Fugitive," "More Than a Miracle").</TE>
<TE>   Veteran Latino performers, says Reyes, "did not work in a vacuum.
They were stars themselves, as well as working with other established
stars. Ramon Novarro, his 'Ben-Hur' (1926) helped saved MGM from
bankruptcy."</TE>
<TE>   The festival also illustrates how actors such as Anthony Quinn,
who won two supporting-actor Oscars, for "Viva Zapata!" (1952) and
"Lust for Life" (1956), expanded their range by playing everything
from Italians to Greeks to Arabs. "He is the most successful Hispanic
actor of his generation because of the length of his career," Reyes
says. "He started in 1936 and he played every ethnicity, and then
there was the international significance of his career."</TE>
<TE>   Ferrer, who was born in Puerto Rico, was the first Latino actor to
win a best-actor Oscar, for playing the tragic French title character
in the 1950 film "Cyrano de Bergerac."</TE>
<TE>   "He was a well-established actor, director and producer on
Broadway before that," Reyes says. "With 'I Accuse!' [Sept. 30], he
is also the actor and director of this film. He's playing a French
Jew who is accused of treason and the cover-up that resulted from it.
And in 'Moulin Rouge' [Sept. 9], he played French painter
Toulouse-Lautrec, and he was nominated for an Oscar for that as
well."</TE>
<TE>   Alonso says she never had a role model growing up in Venezuela. "I
liked Goldie Hawn a lot," she says, laughing. As far as Latino
performers, "I just enjoy Rita Hayworth's beauty and her softness in
the way she acted. I loved Carmen Miranda, though her life was very
tragic. She was always trying to have fun; she was so wild and
crazy."</TE>
<TE>   The festival features two of the colorful Brazilian-born Miranda's
later films, "A Date With Judy" and "Nancy Goes to Rio" (both on
Sept. 23).</TE>
<TE>   Reyes is pleased that the festival is shining a spotlight on the
comedic actress Lupe Velez, who began working in films during the
silent era and was briefly married to "Tarzan" star Johnny
Weissmuller.</TE>
<TE>   Her "Mexican Spitfire" movies, Reyes says, "are kind of late in
her career. It was almost like she was a sitcom star. She was a
spitfire in her own way. She did have that exaggerated personality,
so they did a series around the personality she created."</TE>
<TE>   Latino actors, though, were more often than not cast in
stereotypical roles, in part because Hollywood would import actors
from Mexico and Spain and then didn't know what to do with them.</TE>
<TE>   "They were kind of pigeonholed for the most part in these
stereotypical roles, much like Penelope Cruz today," Reyes says. "She
is an actress who plays any role in Spain. They bring her here and in
'All the Pretty Horses,' what did she play? A virginal senorita. In
another film, she played a prostitute. So it took her a while to get
to 'Vanilla Sky.' "</TE>
<TE>   A lot of roles for Latinos dried up in the 1970s and '80s with the
demise of the western film genre. "Westerns always had Latinos in
them," Reyes notes. "Either they were banditos or the California
noblemen. There was always a role for them in westerns."</TE>
<TE>   The evening of Sept. 30 is devoted to work by Latinos behind the
camera, including cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa ("Night of the
Iguana"), composer Lalo Schifrin ("Sol Madrid"), production designer
Pato Guzman ("The In-Laws") and director Raoul Walsh ("The Naked and
the Dead").</TE>
<TE>   Reyes says Figueroa once told him of an encounter in Mexico City
he had with artist Diego Rivera. "He was at an art exhibit," says
Reyes. "He went up to Diego Rivera and said, 'My gosh, I am in awe of
your murals and paintings.' Diego told him, 'I am in awe of you
because you make murals and paintings that move.' "</TE>
<TE>   "Hispanics in Hollywood" begins Monday at 5 p.m. on TCM with "The
Lady From Shanghai" with Rita Hayworth, followed by "Fiesta" with
Ricardo Montalban at 6:30 p.m., "Mexican Spitfire's Baby" with Lupe
Velez at 8:30 p.m., "Mexican Spitfire at Sea" with Velez at 9:45
p.m., "Forever, Darling" with Desi Arnaz at 11 p.m., and "You Were
Never Lovelier" with Hayworth and Xavier Cugat at 12:45 a.m.</TE>

<HD>Second Time's the Charm for Juana Molina at McCabe's</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERNESTO LECHNER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four years ago, a visibly distraught Juana Molina took the stage of
McCabe's for what would be a disastrous U.S. debut. The
comedian-turned-singer and KCRW-FM favorite opened the show with an
out-of-tune guitar, forgot the lyrics to some of her songs and looked
so out of control that the resulting performance evoked a combination
of pity and morbid fascination. The following morning, Molina vowed
never to perform live again. A few months later, she packed her bags
and returned to her native Argentina.</LD>
<LD>   And yet there's a happy ending to this story. Determined to turn
music into her full-time occupation and fighting Argentina's public
opinion, which still refuses to see her as anything other than an
actress, Molina recorded two new albums, released them independently,
became a cult sensation in Japan and returned to the scene of the
crime Saturday for a surprisingly self-assured performance at a
sold-out McCabe's.</LD>
<LD>   Backed with subtle precision by guitarist Fernando Kabusacki and
multi-instrumentalist Alejandro Franov, Molina was in complete
control of her whimsical, highly poetic material.</LD>
<TE>   Molina is still a shy performer, but her newly acquired musical
knowledge and years of practice have had a liberating effect. "El
Perro," a slice-of-life vignette about an annoying dog, incorporated
her obvious comedic gifts into her music, with hilarious results.
Molina's performance was an uplifting affair, proving that her desire
to grow as a musician has allowed her to overcome all obstacles.</TE>

<HD>If It's September, This Must Be Premiere Time</HD>
<DH>Television* Although cable has altered the competitive
climate, executives are loath to tinker with the only rollout routine
they trust.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Today is Labor Day, which means, as always, that the leading
broadcasters are a few weeks away from unleashing a major programming
blitz, ringing the dinner bell and hoping viewers dutifully return.</LD>
<LD>   Never mind that network executives have pontificated for years
about the need to retain viewers during the summer, the value of
viewing the TV season as a 52-week proposition, and how they can no
longer afford to hang out a "Gone fishin' " sign from Memorial Day
through Labor Day, letting cable channels lure away viewers. Forget,
also, those frequent cries of frustration from producers concerned
that their shows will get lost amid the avalanche of new shows all
debuting at the same time.</LD>
<LD>   Programmers responded to the what-to-do-during-the-summer
conundrum this year by offering a slightly larger assortment of
unscripted shows, with "American Idol" and "Dog Eat Dog" emerging as
hits, just as "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire," "Survivor" and "Fear
Factor" did in summers past.</LD>
<TE>   That was summer, however, and this is now. All told, 30 prime-time
series will make their debut on the broadcast networks before
September is over, with 18 of them arriving the week of Sept. 23--a
period that marks the official start of the television season. More
than twice that many existing shows will also come back that week
with new episodes.</TE>
<TE>   Whether this approach--born in the 1950s, when the schedule
coincided with the major auto makers' introduction of their fall
lines--still makes sense today is open to debate, but for a variety
of reasons the template is difficult to alter, the habit hard to
break.</TE>
<TE>   "Television has very strong patterns that have been there for
decades, and they're still locked into them," said Herb Schlosser, a
former president of NBC Entertainment and consultant to Salomon Smith
Barney in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "If the networks were smart, you wouldn't have 18 shows premiering
in one week, because there's too much clutter," added Chuck Bachrach,
executive vice president for media and programming at the Los
Angeles-based ad agency Rubin Postaer and Associates.</TE>
<TE>   Yet while the crush of shows might sound like madness, executives
insist there is method to it.</TE>
<TE>   For starters, viewing levels do rise substantially in the fall, as
the weather cools, daylight saving time ends and kids go back to
school. Based on Nielsen Media Research data, the percentage of homes
using television (what television executives refer to as HUT levels)
increases by more than 10% from summer to fall.</TE>
<TE>   That trend holds among teenagers and young adults, key
demographics that are generally more elusive and particularly
attractive to advertisers. "They're just not as available in the
summer," said WB Entertainment President Jordan Levin.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, despite the competitive logjam, network officials say
the idea of a "premiere week" creates a sense of excitement among
viewers, collectively promoting network television.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the swallows coming back to Capistrano," said Preston
Beckman, Fox's executive vice president of strategic program
planning. "The viewing public is still conditioned to believe the
networks are bringing out their shows the last few weeks in
September."</TE>
<TE>   Networks have experimented with spacing their premieres, but in
most instances, the strategy hasn't paid off. In addition,
programmers fear that holding a show back might allow rivals to
establish a toehold they might not gain otherwise--a concern for Fox,
which will delay several series because of prime-time preemptions due
to its coverage of the major league baseball playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a risk of someone getting attached to a competing show
before you get started," said David Poltrack, CBS' executive vice
president of research.</TE>
<TE>   "In most cases, when people have tried [starting early], it hasn't
really worked.... Premiere week really signals the beginning of the
fall schedule to the viewer and creates an event out of the beginning
of the season."</TE>
<TE>   Other considerations play a part. The major networks need to
repeat their most popular shows for economic reasons because they pay
for two broadcasts of each episode and usually don't turn a profit
until the second airing.</TE>
<TE>   The networks must also plan how they deploy fresh episodes around
"sweeps" periods--monthlong rating surveys conducted in November,
February and May that are vital to local TV stations, which rely upon
those results to negotiate advertising rates. Because most shows
produce 22 to 26 episodes a year, and the season officially runs 36
weeks, allocating a dozen episodes to those three months leaves only
10 to 14 to be strewn across the balance.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, there's an emphasis on firmly planting programs
before November, when the sweeps competition becomes fierce as
high-profile specials and movies get thrown into the mix.</TE>
<TE>   "You become a slave to the sweeps, and the momentum you need to
get the November sweeps set up," Levin noted.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, there is the question of how the media covers the
horse-race aspects of the TV industry. Executives say it is important
to jump out of the starting gate--similar to the fascination with
opening-weekend box office in the film business--given that series
are frequently proclaimed hits or flops after one or two telecasts, a
perception that can be hard to shake.</TE>
<TE>   Network officials nevertheless concede that the scheduling game
continues to change. Cable networks, which once waited until the
major networks were in reruns to counter with original series and
movies, have become more aggressive in taking on broadcasters. HBO,
for example, launched the miniseries "Band of Brothers" last
September and will begin the fourth season of "The Sopranos" on Sept.
15, going into the teeth of the network Sunday-night lineups.</TE>
<TE>   With the plethora of choices available, some also suggest the
traditional handicapping of prime-time matchups--wondering how a
certain CBS drama, say, will perform head to head against an NBC
sitcom--has been rendered moot.</TE>
<TE>   "It just feels like there are no rules any longer," said Brad
Grey, whose company produces "The Sopranos." "It's the whole
500-channel universe theory come home to roost. That cliched
competition that we were all so used to has changed."</TE>
<TE>   For the networks, however, a few rules still apply.</TE>
<TE>   "God created premiere week for a reason," Fox's Beckman said,
adding that after experimenting with alternatives, "everyone has
found religion."</TE>

<HD>Globe's 'Pericles' Is a Weird and Wild Ride</HD>
<DH>A mad jumbling of elements renders one of Shakespeare's
final plays a fun if inconsistent observation on life.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SAN DIEGO--If the novelist John Irving, who likes to populate his
works with dancing bears, mutilation scenes and other oddities and
crudities, were to try his hand at Shakespeare, the result might look
like the Old Globe Theatres production of "Pericles," which opened
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Except for the dancing bears it's all here: a jumble of plot
lines, inconsistencies and improbabilities, and a good bit of fun,
poignancy and pathos amid some sharp observations about life in the
trenches.</LD>
<LD>   A fisherman looks at some snared flotsam and remarks, "Here's a
fish hung in the net like a poor man's right in the law." How true.</LD>
<TE>   But anyone trying to find something larger, something cohesive,
has a daunting task. Not for nothing has the Old Globe never before
done "Pericles," one of Shakespeare's last plays.</TE>
<TE>   Director Darko Tresnjak has given the play some tweaking and some
sight-gag enhancements and done the bawdyhouse scene as comically
X-rated as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Wynn Harmon, as Pander the brothel-keeper, is dressed in fright
wig, costume and makeup straight from Michael Keaton's title
character in "Beetlejuice."</TE>
<TE>   Tresnjak asks us to go with the flow of the play, which is funny
and weird, if lacking in tension. It's difficult to care where these
folks are going, but the ride is interesting.</TE>
<TE>   The evening's labor begins with prince Pericles in flight to avoid
the wrath of the King of Antioch. Pericles has figured out that the
king and his daughter are engaging in merry incest.</TE>
<TE>   Thus begins an odyssey of shipwrecks, attacks by pirates,
encounters with nobles of other lands, a marriage, a birth, a
shipboard death, some treachery, some loyalty and, when the plot
stalls, some supernatural intervention.</TE>
<TE>   As Gower the narrator, Ned Schmidtke is a charming mix of grace
and goofiness. But in his epilogue, about all Gower can muster is a
saw about virtue triumphant.</TE>
<TE>   The part of Pericles is not much of a grabber but Michael James
Reed soldiers on dutifully. Anna Belknap is a gem as Pericles'
long-lost daughter, Marina, who is sent to a brothel but defends her
virginity.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Janasz is superb as the moral center of the play, the
truth-telling Helicanus. And Dara Fisher is suitably slutty as the
Bawd who tells Marina: "You are light into my hands, where you are

<HD>Mizeranydance a Marvel for Its Moves Alone</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A locally based modern dancer of high technical and expressive
authority, Michael Mizerany also choreographs intimate, elliptical
dance dramas about the conflict between innate individual needs and
oppressive societal norms.</LD>
<LD>   Enlisting 10 members of what he calls Mizeranydance, the two-act
"Edgewalkers" represented Mizerany's largest-scale exploration of
this theme to date. In its premiere Friday at the L.A. Theatre
Center, it also contained some of his best dance ideas and worst
dramatic strategies.</LD>
<LD>   Wedding sci-fi mysticism to sleazy soap opera, the delirious plot
took bisexual Jeff Bulkley from the corseted, closeted 19th century,
where the only sex seemed to be furtive gay encounters, through a
time portal borrowed from "Star Gate" into a facsimile of
contemporary West Hollywood. Here the underdressed women's corps
collectively ravished him, Mizerany repeatedly seduced him, and
nightclub emcee Brian Pelletier behaved as if auditioning for a road
company of "Cabaret."</LD>
<TE>   Enter Stephanie Scott as Bulkley's 19th century fiancee, intent on
reclaiming him, and no wonder: As the only halfway straight male in
two centuries, he justified her desperation, as well as the jealous
anger of gun-toting, lip-syncing transsexual Lisa Gillespie.</TE>
<TE>   As this story doubled back on itself, Mizerany's show-biz routines
proved ever more smirky and faceless and his dramatic episodes
increasingly dogged and repetitive. His timidity also undercut the
depiction of contemporary freedoms--the way he nervously covered
himself with a small volume of Walt Whitman in his brief flash of
nudity, for example, or his use of an expurgated version of
"Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered" to accompany the big homosexual
bedroom scene.</TE>
<TE>   So why care or even watch? Because the serious dances themselves
were so well made and admirably executed that it became possible to
enjoy them as pure movement expression without reference to their
overwrought pretexts and one-note characterizations. If you could
forget the ideas and focus on the moves, you could see genuine talent
well on the way toward a breakthrough.</TE>
<TE>   Those endless passages in which Scott literally threw herself at
Bulkley, for instance, went nowhere emotionally but displayed her
inexhaustible daring and his partnering prowess with great
choreographic surety. Similarly, all the dropped trousers and
pantomime foreplay of Mizerany's sex scenes betrayed his impressive
ability to convey erotic heat, energy and deep need abstractly
through convulsive gymnastic action and bold athletic interplay.</TE>
<TE>   Even when physicalizing extreme 19th century rigidity, Mizerany
managed to keep his dancers looking mobile and even enviably pliant.
And from Scott, in an impossibly obnoxious clinging-vine role, he
inspired a performance rich in nuance and unstinting in commitment.
Nearly every character wanted and used Bulkley one way or the other,
but only Scott made you believe she loved him.</TE>
<TE>   For all of Bulkley's reliability as a dancer, "Edgewalkers" left
him a sexual doormat all evening long and Mizerany gave himself all
of two expressions: sour when wearing a shirt and smug after taking
it off. Miscast as a transsexual, Gillespie always seemed just
another woman obstructing a male love affair--and Mizerany's
insistence on her lip-syncing ballads instead of dancing them added
one more disastrous miscalculation.</TE>
<TE>   Shannon Harris, Paige Blend, Jessica Harper, Sara Storrie and
Laila Abdullah completed the cast. Recorded Bach and Bartok
accompanied the 19th century scenes while everything from show tunes
to Big Bad Voodoo Daddy reinforced Mizerany's confused celebration of
modern freedoms.</TE>
<TE>   His program synopsis spoke of "the biases of the 19th century"
following Bulkley and "threatening to destroy" his newfound "love,
sex and acceptance in the 21st century." In fact, Mizerany
choreographed a far different story--one about a mindless wimp who
found love and sex in both centuries but ended up as easily
manipulated by his boyfriend in the present as his girlfriend in the
past.</TE>

<HD>Giving Its Regards to New York</HD>
<DH>With an eye on Sept. 11 anniversary, the Great American
Concert salutes the Big Apple with music from on and off Broadway at
the Hollywood Bowl.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The theme of this year's Great American Concert at the Hollywood Bowl
over the weekend was "New York, New York"--perhaps inevitable, given
the upcoming anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   There were only brief allusions Friday night to the terrible event
itself, in conductor John Mauceri's opening remarks, in a reprise of
the short threnody "September 11, 2001" that Jerry Goldsmith dashed
off for the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra last year, and in the appearance
of the singing New York City Police Officer Daniel Rodriguez.</LD>
<LD>   Rodriguez's avocation as a concert singer has soared in the past
year, the circumstances of which lent a mildly tasteless irony to his
opening number, the self-congratulatory "This Is the Moment" from
"Jekyll &amp; Hyde."</LD>
<TE>   However, Rodriguez is clearly a gifted tenor, and his talent
within the pops idiom is indisputable. He continued with
"Shenandoah," "The House I Live In," and "Into the Fire" from "The
Scarlet Pimpernel," a song that has a much more sobering meaning in
this context.</TE>
<TE>   (By the way, is there some reason why Rodriguez's songs were the
only ones whose composers weren't listed in the program? Frank
Wildhorn, who wrote the music for "Jekyll" and "Pimpernel," is
clearly the Rodney Dangerfield of Broadway songsmiths.)</TE>
<TE>   After intermission, a trio of musical-theater stars sang New York
songs, as well as a couple of Broadway numbers that are only
marginally Gothamish ("Being Alive," for example--rumors are that it
is possible to be alive outside New York City).</TE>
<TE>   Judy Kaye's rendition of Cole Porter's relatively obscure "Down in
the Depths on the Ninetieth Floor" was a gem, and Davis Gaines
stylishly gave his regards to Broadway.</TE>
<TE>   Rebecca Luker appeared to forget a lyric during "Autumn in New
York," and her voice generally didn't seem quite at home in this
material.</TE>
<TE>   Mauceri delivered lighthearted comments on New York and L.A. with
a flair that would fit the Leno or Letterman shows. The Hollywood
Bowl Orchestra sounded bracing in the suite from "Ragtime," the theme
from "Laura" (with 90-year-old composer David Raksin taking a bow),
the prelude from "North by Northwest," the mambo from "West Side
Story" and the John Williams "Liberty Fanfare" that accompanied the
evening's fireworks.</TE>

<HD>Circling Wagons in Defense of Alien 'Crop' Theory</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I can well understand the fair critique Kenneth Turan made of "Crop
Circles: Quest for Truth" ("Humorless 'Crop Circles: Quest for Truth'
Finds Only Believers," Aug. 23). However, having conceptualized and
arranged financing for this film that producer-director William
Gazecki assumed control over and radically changed, I want to respond
to Turan's complaint that the filmmaker relied too heavily on "true
believers" and did not adhere to the journalistic practice of letting
"each side of an issue have its say."</LD>
<LD>   Fair enough, given the mistaken subtitling of the film as "Quest
for Truth," which it never was supposed to be. Rather, the intention
was to celebrate this awesome phenomenon, in the course of which the
audience would come to see that, indeed, it is a real mystery.</LD>
<LD>   That aside, it would in fact be impossible to present what Turan
missed, because there is no evidence-based "other side." The people
who claim to have created crop circles as hoaxes never have made any
explanation of how they do complex formations--they merely claim that
they do and that's that. To have had any of these people or those who
sympathize with them speaking in the film would not have served to
present anything to grapple with.</LD>
<TE>   But what could have been done in much more detail, in order to
squelch troublemaking, unfounded hoaxer claims, was to have given so
much evidence of what could not be hoaxed that faking all circles
would have been seen as the impossible thing it is.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to what was presented in the film--laboratory analysis
that reveals biological and chemical changes to the crop, the
presence of bends in brittle plants, the complex supra-human geometry
with which formations are designed, the fact that many of them are
next to well-traveled roads and public gathering places and yet
people never are caught making formations--here are some other
omitted or barely touched-on indications of crop circles that can't
be done by people:</TE>
<TE>   * The absolutely parallel, carpet-like lay of the stalks.</TE>
<TE>   * Lays made up of innumerable parallel bundles of several strands
wrapped by pieces of straw.</TE>
<TE>   * Single stalks, which somehow have not been affected by the
energy, left standing in downed crop.</TE>
<TE>   * Tightly woven features like nests and tents, plus basket weaves
and half-tone effects.</TE>
<TE>   * Adjustments for hilly terrain so patterns are symmetrical from
the air.</TE>
<TE>   * The failure of electronic and magnetic equipment inside and
above circles.</TE>
<TE>   * The fact that it would take surveyors days to lay formations
out.</TE>
<TE>   * Downed crop in lines far too narrow for people to pass through.</TE>
<TE>   * Circles that are in the middle of fields, with no means of
access.</TE>
<TE>   The mind of humanity being met by something like itself does not
fall in any known category for identification in our world, and so it
is natural to be skeptical about the otherworldly nature of this
phenomenon. But to close one's eyes to overwhelming evidence that
indicates the formations are outside human bounds is something else
again.</TE>
<TE>   Having been hooked by the genuineness of the circle phenomenon
years ago, and believing them to be humanity's greatest hope for
changing its mind-set at a time when we have become so dangerous to
ourselves, I was grateful that the film's shortcomings did not pop
Turan into the skeptics camp. In addition to letting readers know
that the formations "look lovely and amazing from the air," and that
the film is "interesting in spite of itself," kudos for his having
the chutzpah to say, "Frankly, some of these crop patterns are so
amazing that alien assistance seems a distinct possibility."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed.</TE>
<TE>   Suzanne Taylor was one of the executive producers of "Crop
Circles: Quest for Truth." A resident of Los Angeles, she is the
founder of Mighty Companions Inc., a nonprofit organization dedicated
to encouraging the awareness of humanity's oneness. She can be

<LD>Ajittery hand-held camera moves through the shadowy alley, then
closes in on a clutch of rough young men negotiating a drug deal. The
deal goes bad. A fight breaks out and the police rush in. And Keith
Frazier (played by Brian Gross) lands in jail.</LD>
<LD>   This is not your average Animal Planet family fare, but tonight
the channel goes gritty long enough to set up the premise of a new
movie, "Hope Ranch" (8 p.m.).</LD>
<LD>   Bruce Boxleitner stars as a former police officer and rancher,
J.T. Hope, doing conscience duty--taking on Keith and two other
three-time juvenile losers, Ernesto and Booker (J.D. Pardo and
Richard Lee Jackson), who are facing incarceration as adult
offenders. Hope has a unique antidote for bad habits and bad
attitudes: a 2,000-acre ranch run by two ranch hands: wisecracking
Shorty, delightfully played by Barry Corbin ("Northern Exposure"),
and gruff tough-guy Colt, played by Lorenzo Lamas ("Renegade").</LD>
<TE>   When the three delinquents are forced to trade a jail bunk for a
bunkhouse, they pout and balk. But when they're made to don western
wear, work 12-hour days and toe the line according to major domo
Shorty, they rebel, only to be knocked back in line by Colt.</TE>
<TE>   This being Animal Planet, the teens have to dodge "cow pies," muck
out the barn, grapple with calves, try to stay in the saddle, face
lizards, rats and one nasty rattler, all while nursing an assortment
of bruises, cuts and painful blisters.</TE>
<TE>   "Hope Ranch" is a classic fish-out-of-water tale, a juvenile "City
Slickers" meets "Scared Straight," replete with city-versus-country
one-liners. Colt: "There are only two kinds of music: country and
western." Booker shoots back: "Where I come from, there are only two
kinds of music: hip and hop."</TE>
<TE>   The jokes and tenderfoot mishaps played out against the great
outdoors carry along the entertaining, if predictable, story,
although the idea that these hard cases could be redeemed in two
weeks requires considerable artifice and contrivance.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the final period of Lionel Hampton's long life, after a series of
strokes that left his performance ability and speech impaired, he
maintained a fierce desire to stay in the swim of the musical life.</LD>
<LD>   He kept active in the last five years of his life by touring and
playing the role of a wise elder in jazz, and an important part of
that annual regimen took him to Moscow, Idaho, every February to
preside at the Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival.</LD>
<LD>   In the wintry landscape of a small university town in western
Idaho, Hampton was king. He had visited for a week each year since
1987, when the music school at the University of Idaho was named
after Hampton, and he took over steering an on-campus festival whose
roots date back 30 years. A $60-million Lionel Hampton Jazz Center,
to include his archives, is in the building process, slated for a
2006 opening.</LD>
<TE>   The de facto head and organizing force of the festival is the
university's Lynn J. Skinner, but Hampton was very much the smiling
epicenter. Photographs of his early visage loomed over the stage, and
a life-size bronze of the man and his vibes stood, sentry-like, in
one corner. In the four, long evening concerts in the university's
Kibbie Dome, Hampton would perch in an overstuffed chair by the
stage, egging on the parade of musicians, both the famous as well as
budding winners of the festival's large student competition (up to
15,000 students descend for the festival). Occasionally, Hampton
would sit in on a tune with top-drawer house bands, such as 1997's
ensemble band that included Hank and Elvin Jones, saving his own
official performance for last.</TE>
<TE>   Hampton's name was enough to bring to Moscow a stellar cast of
jazz players, which in recent years has included Ray Brown, Joe
Lovano, Diana Krall, Conte Candoli, Roy Hargrove, Abby Lincoln (who
memorably sang Hampton's classic ballad "Midnight Sun" to him onstage
a few years ago), and countless others.</TE>
<TE>   The Moscow trips also included a day trip to the town of Lapwe, on
the Nez Perce Reservation. In a touching musical exchange from a few
years back, Hampton and a roster of visiting musicians performed for
schoolchildren, with a display of Native American dance in return. On
the way back to Moscow, the festival entourage would stop at the Nez
Perce Casino for lunch and some slot-machine action, and Hampton
would have a close encounter with lady luck.</TE>
<TE>   At this year's festival--Hampton's final public
performance--infirmity reportedly kept Hamp's playing from the
nimbleness of his pre-stroke years, and sometimes he had to get lyric
cues from his drummer when singing his signature "What a Wonderful
World." But age and declining health would not keep Hampton from the
festival.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, in an interview at his New York apartment, Hampton
visibly warmed when I mentioned his annual Moscow retreat. He seemed
most excited about the educational prospect of the Moscow operation:
"We have a great group of music teachers there, to vocalize and
synthesize things, to get as much training in jazz as possible. They
help to keep the jazz going. This is the only art form that is truly
American.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that we should teach our kids good ideas and [emphasize]
advancement. I think that we should adhere to a pulse, if it's a good
pulse, and see that we take care of things the folks care about."</TE>

<LD>The headline on Robert Hilburn's Aug. 26 review of Bruce
Springsteen's Forum concert was "Rock, With Respect." Hilburn ended
his piece by pointing out that the Boss chose the Forum over the
newer Staples Center because the older venue better suited
Springsteen's blue-collar tradition.</LD>
<LD>   What I would like to know is, in this time of poor economic
conditions and widespread layoffs, how many blue-collar folk were
able to afford the tariff of a ticket that sold for $75, not
including Ticketmaster's "convenience charge"?</LD>
<LD>   Much has been said about the patriotic tone of Springsteen's
latest album. That isn't new. The patriotism card was played when the
last E-Street collaboration was released back in 1984. The Boss is
one of those artists who, in writing about the people and landscape
of this country, evokes a certain sentiment for all things American.</LD>
<TE>   What is unfortunate is the fact that Springsteen, as an artist,
has also allowed himself to be sold as a man of the working class,
drawing on images of Woody Guthrie barnstorming through America on
the rails during this country's worst economic period of the 20th
century. Springsteen has added to this mystique by recording Guthrie
tunes and evoking the lead character, Tom Joad, from John Steinbeck's
novel "The Grapes of Wrath," another work of art depicting the
downtrodden of America's Great Depression.</TE>
<TE>   The difference between Guthrie and Springsteen is as wide as the
mighty Mississippi. For all the concerts, records and radio shows
Guthrie did, he remained a man of the people up to the day he died.
Springsteen, on the other hand, has chosen the path of crass
commercialization, taking more than the lion's share of concert
ticket sales, not to mention the revenue from the sale of
snappy-looking T-shirts. He and his family are ensconced in a
$13-million mansion in New Jersey. He continues to own a home in one
of California's priciest and exclusive areas.</TE>
<TE>   Yet he and his minions of journalist supporters continue to spread
the gospel of the Boss being one of us. The last I looked, those
factory workers, waitresses, truck drivers and other assorted
blue-collar folk weren't able to afford a garage in the Boss'
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   It can be argued that Springsteen is merely enjoying the fruits of
his labors. This is something that any person is entitled to in the
USA, and I wouldn't argue that. What is objectionable is the
blindness to the fact that a false image has been milked for all it's
worth--and that such an artist is exploiting his fans, unless one
doesn't believe that paying $75 to stand some 80 yards away from the
stage and stare at the collective backs of the people in front of
them is excessive.</TE>
<TE>   Springsteen is doing what countless other artists have done in
recent years: Take the money and run.</TE>
<TE>   How many commercials for cars, food and athletic shoes have
30-second musical sound bites by artists who once professed not to
trust anyone over the age of 30 and who called for a revolution?</TE>
<TE>   A major music magazine that had John Lennon on its debut cover now
sports such revolutionary headlines as "Summer Style Issue."
Unfortunately, if Springsteen is supposed to evoke the continued
Everyman concept that rock once had, then rock is deader than
Lennon--and we are all slightly less for allowing that to happen.</TE>
<TE>   John Zavesky is a freelance writer who has recently completed a
novel about the 1953 Los Angeles mayoral election. He lives in Los

<LD>   Pop Culture, Big Business,</LD>
<LD>   and the End of White America</LD>
<TE>   By Leon E. Wynter</TE>
<TE>   Crown</TE>
<TE>   288 pages, $25</TE>
<TE>   Move over, Tom Friedman! Another prophet has arrived to sing the
praises of the profit motive. Leon E. Wynter, a familiar voice on
National Public Radio and a former Wall Street Journal columnist, has
some good news. Despite the incendiary subtitle promising (or
threatening) "the end of white America," Wynter proclaims the end of
racism and the triumph of something he calls "transracial America."</TE>
<TE>   What Wynter means by "the end of white America" is the end of an
era when "whiteness" was assumed to be the norm and automatically
conveyed privilege. Indeed, as Wynter illustrates with a quote from
the writings of Benjamin Franklin, whiteness was always a rather
dubitable term, referring to something existing more in the eye of
the beholder than in reality. "In Europe," Franklin observed, "the
Spaniards, Italians, French, Russians and Swedes are generally of
what we call a swarthy complexion; as are the Germans also, the
Saxons only excepted, who with the English make up the principal body
of white people on the face of the earth."</TE>
<TE>   Despite this privileging of "whiteness," Wynter argues, black
people have always been central to American culture, even before
"White America" was prepared to admit it. Then, in the late 1970s and
early 1980s, corporate America (from Hollywood to Wall Street, from
Madison Avenue to the malls and chain stores) began to discover that
a transracial approach was the profitable way to go. Although
businesses had long been familiar with the idea of targeting specific
ethnic markets, they learned that black, brown and multiracial images
are more effective than all-white ones in selling their products to
everyone.</TE>
<TE>   Color sells, whether it's Michael Jackson singing the praises of
Pepsi or--the ad that Wynter singles out as a crucial turning
point--football player Mean Joe Green accepting a frosty Coke from a
cute little white kid.</TE>
<TE>   Among the many stories Wynter tells is a tale of three cosmetics
lines. In 1991, Maybelline launched a makeup line aimed at
dark-skinned women. It was marketed primarily through black and
Latino media and displayed separately from other Maybelline products.
Revlon followed suit with a line of its own targeted at the same
market. But Cover Girl took a different approach, simply adding the
darker colors to its main line. It was this tack that proved the most
profitable. White women liked the darker shades, while black and
Hispanic women "didn't want to be separated out from the main brand."
Separate displays for two kinds of makeup were also more expensive,
cutting into profits. And it turned out that many women not only
liked to see women of their own color in ads, but also responded
favorably to the beauty of models of other shades.</TE>
<TE>   What makes color such a hot selling point? According to Wynter,
what American consumers want is something "real," and "real" means
urban, multiracial, multiethnic. And for at least the last two
centuries, black Americans have been a central part of American
cultural reality, no matter how much they were slighted or ignored in
the political realm. Wynter treats us to a brisk romp through the
history of popular culture, from minstrel shows, ragtime, blues, jazz
and the fusion of black and Jewish sensibilities in Tin Pan Alley, to
the rise of rock 'n' roll, disco and hip-hop.</TE>
<TE>   (One correction that should be made: the composer of "Dixie" was
not Stephen Foster, but Daniel Decatur Emmett.)</TE>
<TE>   There's no doubt, black American culture is "real" and central to
American culture. But no culture is a monolith, and black experience
has been as complex, rich and varied as any other. Wynter doesn't
seem too worried about which aspects of black culture are picked out
by the media as "authentic" specimens of "reality." He compares the
"materialism and self-centered nihilism" of rock 'n' roll in the
1950s to the ethos of rap/hip-hop, which he describes as even more
"violent in its selfish nihilism, predatory in its sexuality, and
absolutely preening in devotion to brand-name materialism." It
doesn't seem to disturb him much that violence, misogyny and
crassness are considered tokens of authenticity these days, rather
than kindness, wisdom, sensuality or generosity.</TE>
<TE>   Wynter is so excited by the fact that white stockbroker types go
around echoing black lingo they've picked up from beer commercials,
one wonders if he fails to see that make-believe street smarts and
fake downward mobility do nothing to arrest the truly serious matter
of the widening gap between rich and poor. Sure, it's nice that not
all the rich are white, and not all the poor are black, but that
doesn't solve the worsening problem of economic injustice.</TE>
<TE>   To be fair, Wynter acknowledges that cultural success is not the
same as economic, political and social betterment.</TE>
<TE>   But as a child of that commercial culture, he seems to feel
greater trust in the marketplace than perhaps it merits. Then again,
traditional leftists can take heart from his report on the latest
generation: the old black-white race dichotomy is not an issue to
them; the only dichotomy they know is the one between rich and poor.
Can socialism--or, at very least, trade unionism--be far behind?</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, Wynter urges his fellow black Americans that the time
has come to stop thinking like a low-status minority and recognize
that they are part of the majority. This can be done, he believes, by
elevating "individual identity a little bit higher than group
identity, as every other group in the United States slowly but surely
does." Quibble though one may with some of its assumptions, this
intelligent and invigorating portrait of an emerging transracial
America is one of those books that helps you see what has been
staring you in the face.</TE>

<HD>Hangin' Ten Before 6</HD>
<DH>Early risers hit the surf at Huntington Beach in the hours
before duty beckons</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the predawn darkness of Huntington Beach, with only the lights of
the pier to guide them, the surfers come. It's quiet this early, no
crowds, no rowdy hot doggers breaking the calm. Just the dawn patrol,
a community of early risers who are drawn to the ocean as surely as
the moon draws at the water.</LD>
<LD>   Smooth and glassy at 5, 5:30, 6 a.m., when the patrol begins to
arrive, the water takes on the deep lavender shade of the sky and
this early, before the winds kick in, the waves hold an ideal shape.
No chop, no mushy whitewater.</LD>
<LD>   The couple of dozen surfers who make up Huntington's morning
regulars mostly come to beat the crowds, and the clock. Many have
morning jobs and soon, morning classes, so they rise when most others
are catching the tail end of a deep sleep. It's a great way to begin
the day, they say, making their outlook more positive.</LD>
<TE>   "I like to watch the sun come up," says professional surfer and
Huntington Beach native Danny Misken. And what better place to see
the sun burst through with shades of pale yellow and orange
reflecting in the tide? "I'm out there every morning," Misken says.
"There are about 20 or 30 of us there--come rain, snow or hail,
whatever. We call the others fair-weather surfers."</TE>
<TE>   Some among the hard-core dawn patrol have been known to head to
Trestles in south Orange County as early as 4 a.m. to surf by only
the light of a full moon. They pick their way through the rocky
shoreline and then paddle into the darkness for the best point break
around.</TE>

<LD>Parents were faced with several daunting tasks when terrorists
attacked the Pentagon and the World Trade Center.</LD>
<LD>   They had to quell their children's fears as well as try to explain
the philosophical and historic aspects of a situation that they, in
many cases, didn't understand themselves.</LD>
<LD>   As the world focuses on the first anniversary of those attacks,
about 20 books for children of different ages will be in stores to
help kids work through the disaster and its aftermath.</LD>
<TE>   Picture books for young children usually make their points through
allegory. The titles for older children mirror the range in the adult
book market, from oral histories to spiritual anthologies on coping
with loss.</TE>
<TE>   * For young children</TE>
<TE>   "And God Cried Too: A Kid's Book of Healing and Hope," by Marc
Gellman (Harper Collins). This is a "why bad things happen to good
people" parable to help children deal with loss and fear. The attack
on America and its aftermath are the setting for several chapters.</TE>
<TE>   "Fireboat: The Heroic Adventures of the John J. Harvey," by Maira
Kalman (Putnam). The true story of a 70-year-old fireboat brought
back from the scrap yard to help fight the World Trade Center fires.</TE>

8-year-olds.</TE>
<TE>   "9/11: A Book of Help" (Cricket Books). Children's authors offer
ways to digest tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a Big, Beautiful World Out There," by Nancy Carlson
(Viking). The message is that kids will miss the good aspects of life
if they hide from the things that scare them, like fierce dogs or bad
news on TV.</TE>
<TE>   "Bravemole," by Lynne Jonell (Putnam). A parable of Sept. 11, with
brave moles attacked by dragons.</TE>
<TE>   "Even Firefighters Hug Their Moms," by Christine Kole MacLean
(Dutton). A tribute to rescue workers that shows no one is macho all
the time.</TE>
<TE>   "September 12th: We Knew Everything Would Be All Right" by
first-graders at the H. Byron Masterson Elementary School in Kennett,
Mo., (Scholastic). Essays and illustrations that express the
children's faith in the future.</TE>
<TE>   * For middle-schoolers and teens</TE>
<TE>   "Understanding September 11: Answering Questions About the Attacks
on America" by Mitch Frank (Viking). Current history, explained for
middle-school students.</TE>
<TE>   "The Day Our World Changed: Children's Art of 9/11" (Abrams).
Seventy-five works by children, 5-18 years old, all from the New York
area, were selected for the book and accompanying juried exhibition,
scheduled to open Sept. 11. Commentary by the children about their
art is included.</TE>
<TE>   "A Nation Challenged: A Visual History" (Scholastic). A young
reader's edition of the coffee-table size New York Times book that is
similar, but more effective than its bloated parent. It is designed
to help children comprehend how and why the attacks occurred while
teaching them about how the U.S. responded.</TE>
<TE>   "Let There Be Light: Poems and Prayers for Repairing the World,"
by Jane Breskin Zalben (Dutton). Collection of prayers from various
faiths, plus inspirational quotes.</TE>
<TE>   "With Their Eyes: September 11th--The View From a High School at
Ground Zero," compiled by Annie Thoms (Harper Collins). Students at
Stuyvesant High School, the public school for intellectually gifted
students that lies in the shadow of the World Trade Center, share
their thoughts about the day they say they'll never forget.</TE>
<TE>   "The Day the Sky Fell: A History of Terrorism," by Milton Meltzer
(Landmark Books). An examination of the historical context of
terrorism by the author of nearly 100 young adult books about history
and social issues.</TE>

<LD>Working Underwater</LD>
<LD>   Have you ever been underwater? It is fun to swim and play in a
pool or at the beach. But did you know that some people work
underwater? These people are professional divers. The divers build
piers (the places where the ships stay while visiting a port), and
lay underwater telephone lines, sewer lines or oil pipelines. The
work is sometimes dangerous and must be done in all kinds of weather.</LD>
<LD>   Divers need special clothing, helmets and tools to work
underwater. They wear waterproof diving suits, a lead weight belt and
shoes with lead soles to keep them from floating to the top. Divers
are also known as "hardhat divers" because of the heavy
copper-and-brass helmets they must wear. The helmets weigh from 33 to
55 pounds, but underwater, they feel lighter. The divers breathe air
through a special hose attached to the helmet. Divers use valves on
their helmets to control how much air they have to breathe.</LD>
<TE>   A diver has an assistant, called a "tender," who stays in the boat
and talks to the diver with an underwater phone. The tender ties
tools to a rope and sends them down to the diver. The tender must be
sure that the diver has a steady supply of air. When the diver is
finished working, the tender helps him back into the boat.</TE>
<TE>   You can learn more about divers at the Los Angeles Maritime
Museum. When you visit, you will see all of the special clothes and
tools, and learn about many famous divers who have worked in
California. For more information, visit www.lamaritimemuseum .org or

<TE>   "Jimmy Dabble"</TE>
<TE>   by Frans Fischer</TE>
<TE>   Jimmy comes from a poor farm family. He makes friends with the
farm animals. Then his world-traveling grandma appears. She shows him
some books about a knight, a princess and a mysterious forest. The
book makes him curious about the forest near the farm, so he wanders
off into it where he meets Beebo.</TE>
<TE>   Beebo is a strange creature--a cross between a hippo and a monkey,
with a wild imagination. He gives Jimmy ideas about running the farm,
such as blowing bubbles into the pigs' mud to give them a bubble
bath. And he tells Jimmy to give the cows chocolate so they will
produce chocolate milk.</TE>
<TE>   One day the bank threatens to take the farm away from Jimmy's
family, so it is up to Jimmy and the animals to save the day. They do
some funny and creative things to save the farm.</TE>

<HD>The Hand of God and Theirs</HD>
<DH>In building the cathedral, workers put their skills to the
test. For some, it was faith that pulled them through.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HILARY E. MacGREGOR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five hundred years from now when people stand and marvel at the
soaring adobe-colored structure at Temple and Grand in downtown Los
Angeles, they will learn the names of Jose Rafael Moneo, the cathedral's
architect, and Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, the man who conjured it to
life.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps they will even take away the name of sculptor Robert
Graham, who built the 25-ton Great Bronze Doors, or John Nava, who
designed the tapestries that line the nave.</LD>
<LD>   But visitors of the future will never hear of Juan Hernandez, a
carpenter from Mexico who worked on the Our Lady of Angels Cathedral
for five years, or Eleazar "Chay" Contreras, the layout
superintendent who plotted the angles of the cathedral in
three-dimensional space, or Dana Baker, a marble mason who laid
stones in the floor, and granite in the baptistery. Nor will they
learn the names of Charles Coury, who hid scriptures in the rafters,
or Dennis Paoletti, who calculated the way sound will reverberate
through the basilica, or Francis Krahe, whose lighting turns the
cathedral at night into a giant lantern.</LD>
<TE>   No one has exact numbers, but C. Terry Dooley, senior vice
president of Morley Construction, who worked at the cathedral for six
years, estimates that 2,000 people worked on the $200-million
cathedral complex downtown from start to finish.</TE>
<TE>   These are some of the invisible ones, whose hands laid the stones,
poured the concrete, placed the alabaster in the windows, laid the
wires. But unlike the theaters, apartments, casinos and malls that
are their livelihood, some craftsmen and construction workers also
invested something of themselves in this cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   Dooley said the workers' tangible investment in the building was
part of Moneo's plan. When the contractor proposed casting the
adobe-colored concrete off-site, and transporting it downtown--which
would have been easier--Moneo called the idea "an abomination."</TE>
<TE>   "I want to see the hands of the workers," Moneo told them.</TE>
<TE>   Some of these artisans and tradesmen believe God chose them for
this job. Others prayed for guidance on the site, as the enormity of
the task withered their courage. Still others found
themselves--unexpectedly--caught under the spell of the sacred space.</TE>
<TE>   Those who worked on it like to say--although they are not strictly
correct--that there are no right angles in this cathedral. There are
certainly few.</TE>
<TE>   All the points of the structure, every corner, every wall of every
chapel, the baptismal, the floor, was ultimately measured from a
single point at the corner or Temple and Grand using a piece of
computerized surveying equipment called a digital theodolite. The
tool used lasers projected into space to plot the corners of the
building.</TE>
<TE>   Contreras was the layout superintendent on the project. In order
to construct the 800-plus angles, he plotted more than 11,000 points.
"We have to shoot the three dimensional point coordinates into the
middle of gravity so we can build to that point," said Contreras, a
slight man with bright eyes, fine features and a boyish enthusiasm
that makes even his most esoteric point sound fascinating.</TE>
<TE>   Last Tuesday morning, he pointed with pride at some of the
sharpest corners, the difficult angles, the canted slope of the
chapels of the ambulatory and the radiating web of floor stones.</TE>
<TE>   Everything that followed--the placement of wooden forms built by
carpenters, the pouring of concrete by laborers--depended on
Contreras having perfectly plotted the points. If a wall was off by
even an inch, workers had to fight the tiny error from floor to
roofline or the corner had to be remade. "The work was so intense,"
Contreras said. "There were instances on the job site when I looked
up at the sky and I said, 'Help me, God.' I had this responsibility.
I really didn't want to make an error. I believe God helped me and
there it is."</TE>
<TE>   The hours were crazy. The concrete had to be poured in the inky
blackness of early morning--at 2:30 or 3 a.m.--to keep the water
below 70 degrees and ensure hundreds of years of durability. Riding
high on the building, as the sun rose over the city, were some of the
best times for Contreras.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, it was great," Contreras said. "There were moments when you
were up in the sky and you could see all the downtown high rises, and
the mountains, and it just felt like you were going to heaven."</TE>
<TE>   Through months of taking measurements and calculating points,
Contreras eventually came to understand in his bones the symbolic
language of the building, just as Moneo hopes visitors will. It
happened one day inside the cathedral, as Contreras plotted the axes
of the church, and the floor stones that radiated from the altar. "I
realized it was a cross," Contreras said. "Then I would think, when I
was working at the back of the church, I am working on His right
foot.... Just by knowing I worked on the cathedral, to me it was like
a gift of God. Like I was born to be building His house."</TE>
<TE>   Dream Job</TE>
<TE>   Juan Hernandez, 50, is a carpenter, like his father, his
grandfather, and his great-grandfather before him. Like Jesus.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez worked on the cathedral site longer than any other
workman. He was known for the cowboy-shaped hard hat he wore on the
job; the cardinal liked to tease him about it. Hernandez grew up in
San Miguel de Allende, just blocks from that city's colonial
cathedral. His ancestors built furniture, cabinets, guitars and
pianos, and so has he. For Hernandez, who is Catholic, this was the
job of a lifetime. "I never understand the mind of the Lord, what he
has prepared for me," Hernandez said. "But I know he wants me here,
that he chose me to be here. This was like the culmination of my
career."</TE>
<TE>   The job strained every skill he had. Hernandez worked on many
walls in the cathedral, including the main northeast wall and the
Guadalupe chapel. None of the forms he built had square angles; all
were mitered.</TE>
<TE>   Over five years, as his life changed dramatically, the cathedral
offered him solace and strength. His wife  grew ill. He would leave
her in the morning, knowing as he left, that she might not be alive
when he returned. On those days, he would try to be the first person
in the building, and he would pray. When the sun came up, he thanked
God for a new day. Sometimes he got to see the sun set, and he
thanked God for that too. Sometimes he sang as he worked, happy just
to be alive. Working on the cathedral was peaceful, he said, and he
would have done it for free.</TE>
<TE>   Last spring , when the worst finally happened, his work was a
salvation.</TE>
<TE>   "She died on a Friday night," he said. "Monday, I was ready for
work," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "My children, my grandchildren, they will know, my father, my
grandfather worked there," Hernandez said.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it is a minor thing I did. It's like the sand of the sea,
of the seashore. But little by little you make the big picture. I am
one of those particles of sand. But I am there."</TE>
<TE>   Craftsmen Remembered</TE>
<TE>   Mike Flucke, an executive with Benson Industries of Portland,
Ore., which handled the alabaster and glass, often talked to his
workers of their historical role. "Five hundred years from now," he
would tell them, "people will look back and wonder about the
craftsmen, just as we look at the cathedrals of Europe, and wonder
about their craftsmen."</TE>
<TE>   Flucke has visited museums to see the ropes, pulleys and ramps
medieval builders used to erect their monuments. Many of them, he
said, weren't so different than what was used on this project. His
men, who built the steel that held the windows, and placed the
alabaster in the lantern where the cross hangs, sometimes had to
scramble as many as eight stories of scaffolding to start their work
day.</TE>
<TE>   "We were up there in the middle of space," said Al Galvan, who was
in charge of the huge concrete cross that dominates the east wall of
the cathedral, and is surrounded by veined alabaster that glows at
night like a giant beacon. "We had to use a lot of imagination, a lot
of new techniques. We had new ways of doing things."</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Lohr, 53, is a partner in Carnevale &amp; Lohr, the company that
installed the stone flooring, the altar, the baptismals, the
fountains in the plaza, the courtyards and mausoleums. Lohr oversaw
40 to 45 men for almost two years. Lohr is Lutheran, but his company
has worked on about 20 Catholic churches over the last two decades.
The cathedral, he said, was a humbling project. At times he became
overwhelmed by the magnitude of the job and the timetable. He would
ask God to help him get from one day to the next. He discovered in
himself a new kind of perfectionism. Sometimes, after a long day,
he'd be on his knees until 9 p.m., ripping out stones that weren't
perfectly laid. "Because when you are working on a cathedral, doing
work for the church, for God, it has to be right."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Beaming Inspiration</TE>
<TE>   Those who raise their eyes to the geometric beams that crisscross
the ceiling will be looking at one of the cathedral's secrets.</TE>
<TE>   Craftsmen who work on them often hide their signatures in rafters.
But in July, Charles Coury, manager of the WoodCeilings Inc., the
company that made the ceilings, had an inspiration. He wrote to the
cardinal: "We would like to staple a Bible verse to the hidden inside
portion of one of the 'logs' in order to honor the Lord and
acknowledge the privilege we have felt working on this project." He
asked the cardinal to select a verse, if he thought it was
appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal was delighted. "You are most likely the first
supplier on the Cathedral Project who has made such a magnificent
request, and I commend you for it!" Mahony wrote back, and chose
five.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Tyler, WoodCeilings co-owner, chose four more. The nine
verses are clustered in the rafters nearly 100 feet above the altar.
Matthew 7:8 is directly over the altar, in a spot where the logs
intersect: "In my house, says the Lord, everyone who asks, receives;
and the one who seeks, finds; and to the one who knocks, the door
will be opened."</TE>
<TE>   The scripture project pulled the little company together;
employees signed each scripture card before it was laminated and
stapled to a log. Now the scriptures are a secret, known to only a
few.</TE>
<TE>   "To walk through and look up and know that one of my prayers is up
there, one of the scriptures that I personally selected, it is a
wonderful, thrilling, humbling thing," Tyler said. "There are few
times in your life when you are part of a great work. This is one of
them."</TE>

<HD>A Controversy Is Coined Over Series of Quarters</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINDA HALES</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It started out as a two-bit tussle out on the Great Plains. But now
the design of the 2003 Missouri quarter has become a cause celebre on
the sidewalk outside the Treasury Department.</LD>
<LD>   Missouri artist Paul Jackson held aloft a 4-foot, quarter-shaped
placard there recently in a protest he calls Quartergate. The pale
gray watercolor showed 19th century explorers Lewis and Clark
paddling a canoe down a river, with the St. Louis Gateway Arch in the
background. The design was one he offered up for his state's coin,
which will be the 24th collectible in the U.S. Mint's commemorative
series. That series began in 1999 and continues through 2008.</LD>
<LD>   Jackson, 34, thought he had produced a winner after he entered it
in what turned out to be a nonbinding contest sponsored by Missouri
First Lady Lori Hauser Holden in 2001. Missourians voted 2 to 1 for
his design, Jackson says, and it was among five finalists sent by
Gov. Bob Holden to Washington more than a year ago. But any
celebration was short-lived.</LD>
<TE>   As Jackson and other artists across the country have discovered,
the Mint is under no obligation to use or even honor the artistic
integrity of such submis- sions. Under the provisions of the 50 State
Quarters program, the Mint asks state governors to drum up ideas in
the forum or contest of their choosing. But government engravers
alter and recompose the concepts pretty much as they please. And they
put their own initials on the completed work.</TE>
<TE>   "The Mint is a sovereign entity," Jackson says. "They answer to no
one."</TE>
<TE>   That's how Maine's magnificent Mount Katahdin was reduced to a
molehill on that state's quarter, also due out next year. That design
was superseded by a coastal scene, but Maine's prized three-masted
windjammer, Victory Chimes, was turned into a two-master that looked
suspiciously like the Pride of Baltimore. That's also how, in the
still-unfinished selection process for Missouri, Jackson's canoe was
turned into a clunkier keelboat carrying five more people. And the
arch was manipulated in such a way that the drawing looked like seven
men in a basket.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, who runs an art gallery in Columbia, Mo., is appalled at
such artistic tampering. "We want to bring public attention to what
the Mint is doing with state quarters," he says. "The goal for
artists and schoolchildren is to have your artwork represent your
state pride on the back of your quarter."</TE>
<TE>   He and colleague Scott Miller, 35, a Columbia Web designer, have
taken their campaign on the road. With the support of nine artists in
six states, they are pressing not just for Jackson's design, which
they had printed on quarter-size stickers, but also for the larger
issue of "state artists for state quarters."</TE>
<TE>   The Mint says Jackson is simply confused about the process. It
says it strives for collaboration. Governors are asked to solicit
concepts or even written themes. A handful are submitted to the Mint,
which turns them into "original, coinable and appropriate designs."
That leaves the Mint free to use an artist's work as inspiration
only. The Mint is required to run its versions by the Commission on
Fine Arts and a Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee. The
Treasury secretary rules twice--before and after governors sign off
on what the Mint sends forward.</TE>
<TE>   "Artists are being blindsided by the Mint's staff," complains
Charles Atherton, secretary of the fine arts commission. He is
disturbed that the commission never gets to see the artists' original
work and has resorted to checking numismatic Web sites to find out
what the artists produced. Even after the commission weighs in, he
notes, changes have intruded on whatever artistry remained.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some serious artists involved in this," Atherton says,
"It's pretty good stuff. The government ought to respect the original
artists' integrity when they can."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, he did not approve of Jackson's design. The arch was
just right, but the canoe was all wrong, he says. But so was the
Mint's keel, which would not have plied the Mississippi River.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson is convinced that "something will happen" as a result of
his campaign. In fact, the process for 2004 was altered in February
after the Missouri controversy erupted. A Mint spokesman says that
for that year's quarters, governors will be asked to provide one to
five "acceptable finished designs." If the Mint determines that they
are coinable, the state will be allowed to forward them to the fine
arts commission, the citizens' group and eventually the Treasury
secretary.</TE>

<HD>Goodbye Candy, Hello Soy Bars</HD>
<DH>Way before the soda ban, some L.A. schools had started to
banish high-fat snacks</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GAYLE POLLARD-TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There should be a sign on the front of Edison Middle School. A big
red circle, filled with stacks of candy bars and bags of chips,
slashed with a big red line, the universal sign for "Don't Even Think
About It."</LD>
<LD>   Well in advance of last week's decision to ban soda sales on
campuses of the Los Angeles Unified School District, starting in
2004, plans were laid at Edison to ban not only sodas, but the
junkiest of junk foods from campus.</LD>
<LD>   Potato chips, 15 fat grams per serving, were pulled from the
student-run store. Candy bars, with as many calories as a Lean
Cuisine dinner and triple the fat, banished. Big bottles of soda, 20
ounces of empty calories, vanished.</LD>
<TE>   Empty soda machines stand silent in the playground of this
South-Central campus, the first but not the last among L.A. public
schools to expel sodas and a good share of junk food. Students
returning to Venice High School on Tuesday will find neither sodas
nor high-fat snacks in the vending machines. Monroe High School in
the San Fernando Valley is moving in the same direction.</TE>
<TE>   "They took away our candy, our chips, our favorites," Blanca
Machuca, 12, says as she nibbles on a chocolate chip cookie, allowed
at Edison because the snack has half the fat calories of her favorite
chocolate candy.</TE>
<TE>   "They" are the principal, Faye Banton, teachers and parents. They
exorcised the high-fat goodies in January in the hope that students
will turn to more nutritious varieties and vitamin-rich fruit drinks,
nonfat milk or water.</TE>
<TE>   When the LAUSD board voted last week to give middle and high
schools two years to quit selling carbonated soft drinks to students
during school hours, the motion didn't include kicking out junk food.</TE>
<TE>   At Edison, science and health teacher Lilra Brown needs no
instruction from downtown. "Thirty percent of our children are
overweight," Brown says. She also worries about the connection
between bad grades, low test scores and poor nutrition.</TE>
<TE>   She coordinates a grant from the Linking Education Activity and
Food, or LEAF, state program, designed to help fund nutrition and
fitness education for kids. In the L.A. district, Venice and Monroe
were also awarded LEAF grants. Combined, the three grants total
$750,000.</TE>
<TE>   LEAF coordinators at all three schools want students to eat
healthier. They know students won't give up snacking at school, so
they are focusing on making healthier choices available.</TE>
<TE>   When the bell rings at Edison signaling the morning nutrition
break, many of the 1,600 students sprint to the school store on the
edge of the playground. Pulling dollars out of pockets, they line up
for T.G.I. Friday's potato-skin snack chips with cheddar and bacon.
No respectable health food store would offer them, but they're on the
shelves because they contain less fat, less sugar, less salt and
fewer calories, though not by much, than the popular Flamin' Hot
Cheetos they replaced.</TE>
<TE>   The students also favor the intensely hot Poore Brothers habanero
potato chips, which got the nod because they are low in saturated
fat. Grandma's cookies, in oatmeal and raisin, peanut butter, and
chocolate chip are all for sale--again, not classic health food, but
with some redeeming ingredients. Instead of candy bars, students can
choose Rice Krispies Treats or Chewy granola bars or trail
mix--though few do.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not used to this stuff," says Christopher Thompkins, 13. The
eighth-grader was unhappy when the junk food disappeared, especially
Doritos. He eats the healthier chips because, "There's no other
choice. I've got to get used to it."</TE>
<TE>   Amber Patterson, 12, dives into the baked chips, citing a goal
popular with many girls: "I'm trying to lose some weight."</TE>
<TE>   Since the change, sales have dropped from $1,000 a day to about
$500, according to Aura Barrera, the school's financial manager,
reducing the profits that pay for band instruments, dance costumes
and other student activities. That money will have to be made up
somehow, but the middle school won't take the hit that some L.A. high
schools will--some take in as much as $80,000 per year from the sale
of sodas and junk food to pay for pep rallies, dances and other
events.</TE>
<TE>   At Edison, school administrators say there is a healthy
consequence from the change. More students eat the lunch offered by
the school. The meal count has risen from 555 a day to about 800,
according to cafeteria manager Addie Sandville, suggesting that some
children deprived of their favorite snacks will choose to eat
whatever is available. In a couple of weeks, sales representatives
for vendors will be on the Edison campus to offer a menu of healthy
snacks. Students will pick the tastiest ones for sale in the school
store.</TE>
<TE>   At Venice High School, sodas should be missing from the 22 vending
machines by the time students arrive for class Tuesday. This purge
has been a long time coming.</TE>
<TE>   It started with a request for juice. Three years ago, a frustrated
student approached his health teacher, Jacqueline Domac. Could the
vending machines stock "pure" fruit juice? The teacher followed up
with the school's financial manager. No way. Switching from soda to
juice would have violated the school's exclusive contract with
Coca-Cola. Domac says the soda company gave the school $3,000 a year
for that guarantee, which worked out to $1 per student.</TE>
<TE>   Undeterred, her students circulated a petition two years ago.
Finally, Coke added two juice products: Minute Maid orange and apple
juices. Victory. Or so the kids thought until filmmakers from Paris,
working on a documentary about commercialism, visited the campus last
spring. While escorting the French filmmakers, the students came to
an unsettling realization: the juice was in short supply.</TE>
<TE>   Out of nearly 200 slots, there were 100% juice drinks in only
four, Domac says. "Always at the bottom."</TE>
<TE>   And, the student-activities fund lost money every time a student
chose juice instead of soda. The school received 15 cents on each
juice sale; 36 cents on each soda sale.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, the school came to an agreement with a new vendor. The
vending machines will be stocked with water, juice and sports
drinks--as they will be at all LAUSD secondary schools by 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Domac, who coordinates the LEAF grant for her campus, said she's
determined to see better quality snacks in the vending machines.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning this fall, none of the snacks sold on campus can have
more than 35% fat or 10% saturated fat per serving. The sugar content
also must be less than 35% of the total weight of the item.</TE>
<TE>   What will 3,000 hungry kids munch on?</TE>
<TE>   "We'll fill the vending machine with tons of things," Domac says
"We are looking at Nutrigrain cereal bars, Nature Valley bars and
Genisoy bars. Popcorn and certain cookies also qualify.'' So will
dried fruits and nuts, granola, a veggie alternative to cheese puffs,
various energy bars and some other organic and soy products.</TE>
<TE>   Over at Monroe High School in North Hills, the vending machines
are still stocked as usual, but negotiations are underway to change
that. "We're giving Coke the benefit of the doubt," says Lisa Jones,
the school's LEAF coordinator. "We're meeting again on Sept. 12, and
we want the vending machines changed completely from soda to water
and juices."</TE>
<TE>   "We see kids eating Doritos, a Coke and a Snickers bar for lunch,"
she says. Breaking that habit while those snacks are sold on campus
is a losing proposition, so Jones is working on introducing better
choices. She served soy chips, protein bars, vegan chocolate chip
cookies, veggie burgers and juice at a health fair last year.</TE>
<TE>   She also tried an experiment to convince students that what they
eat matters.</TE>
<TE>   "We fed them a nutritious breakfast before they took the
standardized tests. We served string cheese, a peanut butter and
jelly sandwich, juice and milk to send the message that what you put
in your body really does matter in what you can do."</TE>
<TE>   The school's test scores rose. And, while many things contributed
to that success, Jones wants a healthy breakfast to get some of the
credit.</TE>

<LD>I hop onto the bus. Maybe this is the day my luck will change. My
foster family can't keep me any longer.</LD>
<LD>   Once a year, throwaway kids like me go to the Adoption Fair
Picnic. People who might want to adopt a kid come to the picnic too.
They look us over while we play.</LD>
<LD>   They usually go for the youngest ones. I've gone to the Adoption
Fair year after year. Never been chosen. I'm 10. Too old.</LD>
<TE>   But today I have my good-luck stone. It's gray with a white stripe
down the middle. My mama and I picked it up on the beach one special
Saturday when I was 3. "Keep this, Deon," she said, "and think of me
when you look at it."</TE>
<TE>   I do. Every time.</TE>
<TE>   Now the bus stops at Hilltop Hall. It's a group home for kids who
don't have any other place to stay. The housemother there is Mrs.
Moss. I always liked her. Now she's helping little kids climb onto
the bus.</TE>
<TE>   My breath catches in my throat when I see the first kid. He looks
like my little brother, who got adopted 2 years ago. I haven't seen
him since. The family moved away.</TE>
<TE>   This little kid stumbles when he's beside my seat. I catch him
before he crashes.</TE>
<TE>   "Ho, Little Dude," I say. "You almost got your face rearranged."</TE>
<TE>   "No lie," he says, showing gaps in his teeth when he grins.
"Thanks."</TE>
<TE>   He slips into the seat beside me. Then he says, "Know what I want
when I get adopted? 'Star Wars' sheets for my bed."</TE>
<TE>   If he thinks he's going to get adopted today, he's headed for a
letdown.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday: Will Little Dude be disappointed at the Adoption Fair
Picnic?</TE>

<TE>   Mary Daegling first learned about adoption fairs when she read
about them in a story in the newspaper. This story will be on The

<HD>Early Exposure to Pets May Put Leash on Allergies</HD>
<DH>Immunology* A study asserts that children who are around at
least two dogs or cats by age 1 have a 75% lower risk than those who
aren't.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DELTHIA RICKS</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Exposure to at least two dogs or cats in the first year of life may
drastically reduce the risk of allergies, including reactions to
molds, grasses and pollen, scientists report in an unusual line of
research published last week.</LD>
<LD>   The team of Georgia scientists pursuing this seemingly offbeat
path of research says it now has some fairly solid leads on how
animals help ward off allergies, including those known to trigger
asthma.</LD>
<LD>   "We started this research almost 14 years ago, looking at all of
the factors that cause allergies," said Dr. Dennis Ownby, a professor
of pediatrics and medicine at the Medical College of Georgia in
Atlanta.</LD>
<TE>   Ownby and his team report the results of their investigation in
the Aug. 28 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Assn. In the
study, allergies--or the lack of them--were studied in nearly 500
healthy children born between April 15, 1987 and Aug. 31, 1989.</TE>
<TE>   A key in the research was to pinpoint the amount of exposure
children had by age 1 to cats and dogs, the most common house pets.
Those with exposure to at least two dogs or cats had a 75% lower risk
of allergies. The study found that just one pet didn't confer
protection.</TE>
<TE>   Ownby theorizes that exposure to the protein byproducts of a
certain class of bacteria known as gram-negative explains why some
children have such a dramatically lower risk of serious allergies.
Gram-negative bacteria include E. coli and other organisms that can
be found in animal feces.</TE>
<TE>   Pets lick themselves and spread the byproduct of the bacteria on
their fur. Bacterial byproducts are transferred to children who pet,
kiss or hug the animals, Ownby said.</TE>
<TE>   "We think that something related to the cat/dog exposure forces
the immune system away from the predisposition to allergic
reactions," Ownby said. Such exposure, he added, also minimizes the
effects of other potential allergens, such as molds, pollens and
grass. Prior studies in Europe showed that children who grew up on
farms and were in the constant presence of animals tended to have
fewer allergies.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Marianne Frieri, director of allergy and immunology at Nassau
University Medical Center in East Meadow, said that although the
premise of the study is intriguing, more research needs to be done.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very much aware of the paradoxical effect here," said
Frieri, referring to animals as a source of protection, especially in
the face of medicine's long-standing insistence on shooing animals
away from allergic children.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want anyone to get the notion that they can now go out
and buy 10 cats," Frieri said. "The issue here is exposure in the
first year of life."</TE>
<TE>   Experts agree that the new study provides a foundation to move an
esoteric scientific notion called the hygiene hypothesis from a good
idea into provable theory. The decade-old hypothesis suggests that
modern environments have become "too clean."</TE>
<TE>   According to the theory, the immune system, primed throughout
evolution to fight scourges since eliminated by antibiotics and
vaccines, now like a turncoat responds with allergies and asthma.</TE>
<TE>   "It has only been within the past few years that we have seen a
few well-designed studies that begin to fit [the hygiene hypothesis].
We think ours is one," Ownby said.</TE>

<HD>Vitamins May Keep Arteries Repaired</HD>
<DH>Cardiology* Findings about angioplasty patients expand on
study involving B-12, B-6 and folic acid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA KELLY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>A six-month regimen of folic acid, vitamin B-12 and vitamin B-6 can
help prevent reoccurrence of arterial blockage in patients who have
undergone coronary angioplasty, a study has found.</LD>
<LD>   The findings, reported last week in the Journal of the American
Medical Assn., are an extension of a clinical trial that examined
effects of the vitamin combination on treating heart disease.</LD>
<LD>   The treatment apparently works by lowering levels of homocysteine,
an amino acid long implicated in heart attacks.</LD>
<TE>   Dr. Guido Schnyder, an assistant professor in the cardiology
division at UC San Diego, and his colleagues conducted both studies.</TE>
<TE>   The earlier study, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine
in November, involved 205 patients who were given either the vitamin
combination of folic acid, vitamin B-12 and vitamin B-6 or a placebo
for six months.</TE>
<TE>   During that period, the patients who took the vitamin combination
showed a 48 percent reduction in the development of restenosis, or
re-narrowing of the vessel, compared to patients who received the
placebo.</TE>
<TE>   In the new study, Schnyder added 348 patients and extended the
follow-up observation period from six months to one year.</TE>
<TE>   "It was important to follow these patients for another six months
because that's the time frame in which restenosis typically occurs,"
he said. "We've now shown that the vitamin combination didn't just
delay the development of restenosis, it prevented it."</TE>
<TE>   Schnyder also expanded the study's focus to look at the patient's
need for repeat angioplasties or heart bypass operations. He said the
vitamin regime decreased by 38% the need for repeat angioplasties or
heart bypass operations.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Robert Bonow, chief of cardiology at Northwestern Memorial
Hospital in Chicago and president of the American Heart Assn., said
the study offers more evidence that B vitamins are important in
maintaining healthy blood vessels. More research is needed though, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have a small trial like this, it's always nice to have
confirmation by another group," Bonow said. "I think it's very
interesting and it needs to be followed very carefully."</TE>
<TE>   The study was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation and
Swiss Cardiovascular Center and the University Hospital in Bern,
Switzerland.</TE>

<HD>There Was Something Infectious About Mary</HD>

<LD>If the woman in this picture has a sour expression, who can blame
her? For 26 years, she was held captive on a small island in New
York's East River.</LD>
<LD>   Health officials kept her there because they said she was making
people sick--a charge that the woman, Mary Mallon, viewed as utterly
outrageous. She'd never hurt a fly, she insisted. She'd merely tried
to earn a living as a cook.</LD>
<LD>   Mary Mallon was the original "Typhoid Mary," one of the first
identified healthy carriers of a disease. She moved from job to
job--common for women in domestic service at the start of the 20th
century--and, oddly, wherever she went, people fell ill.</LD>
<TE>   Judith Walzer Leavitt, professor of the history of medicine at the
University of Wisconsin in Madison, says Mallon was an Irish
immigrant who came to the U.S. as a teenager in 1883, earned her
living as a cook in the households of affluent New York families and,
in the summer of 1906, was hired to cook for a family vacationing in
Long Island. During those months, six people in the household fell
ill with typhoid fever.</TE>
<TE>   The life-threatening disease, with symptoms such as high
temperature, weakness and stomach pains, still infects millions in
the developing world. But in turn-of-the-century America, it was no
longer the scourge it had once been. Health officials knew the
disease was caused by contaminated water and had done much to clean
up the supply.</TE>
<TE>   But people still got it--maybe 5,000 a year in New York. This,
Leavitt says, is where carriers like Mary came in.</TE>
<TE>   Not that she was suspected at first. No one knew about "healthy
carriers" of diseases in those days. (The very idea that germs caused
disease was still pretty new.) When the owners of the vacation rental
hired sanitary engineer George Soper to investigate, he explored many
avenues before he homed in on Mallon. "He looked at the shellfish the
people were eating, looked in the community to see if anyone else was
sick, tested the water--all the usual things," says Leavitt.</TE>
<TE>   Then someone mentioned the cook that had been hired--and as Soper
delved into her history, he noted the suspicious trail of typhoid
cases she left in her wake.</TE>
<TE>   As Leavitt recounts in her book, "Typhoid Mary: Captive to the
Public's Health" (Beacon Press, 1997), Soper traced Mallon, who was
working in a posh Park Avenue brownstone in New York. He approached
her, told her he suspected she was making people sick, and asked her
for samples of her feces, blood and urine.</TE>
<TE>   Understandably, Mallon went after Soper with a carving fork and
kicked him out of the house.</TE>
<TE>   But health authorities eventually apprehended Mary--and got their
samples. The samples came up positive for Salmonella typhi, the
bacterium that causes typhoid fever when it gets into the human gut.</TE>
<TE>   The New York City health department banished her to live in a
cottage on North Brother Island--and continued to periodically test
her feces for S. typhi.</TE>
<TE>   The infection, they found, persisted.</TE>
<TE>   Mallon, through all this, was totally indignant. She insisted that
she'd never had a bout of typhoid fever. But clearly, sometime in her
past, she had been infected, maybe suffering only very mild symptoms.
While most infected people eventually kill off the microbe, a
few--maybe 3%--are healthy but carry the germ forever, potentially
contaminating the food that they handle. (Modern studies show that
the bacteria can form a tough coating over the surface of gallstones,
perhaps explaining why some folks become carriers.) Mallon was held
captive with no due process and received a hearing only after the New
York American, a local Hearst newspaper, got hold of the story in
1909 and made much of it.</TE>
<TE>   She lost that hearing--and went back to her island.</TE>
<TE>   Later, she was released on the condition that she never hold a job
as a cook again. But cooking paid more than other domestic jobs, and
after four years she adopted an alias and went back to her old
profession.</TE>
<TE>   All was revealed after another outbreak of typhoid occurred in the
hospital where she was working. Mallon was shipped back to her
island--this time until her death in 1938.</TE>
<TE>   As for the phrase "Typhoid Mary," it quickly transmogrified from a
phrase pertaining only to Mallon to one used by public health workers
to refer to any healthy carrier of disease. Today the phrase is much
more metaphorical, referring to someone who brings trouble wherever
they go. And we all know one or two of those.</TE>

<HD>Like a Ballerina, but With a Shimmy</HD>
<DH>Add yoga and pop, and a dance is routine no longer</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIN CHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In my earliest memory of ballet class, I am sprinting out of a dance
studio and into my mother's arms. I am 5 years old, and the clingy
tights, constricting leotard and competitive brunette with a perfect
bun are too much for me to handle. Nestled in my mother's arms, I
decide I've had enough of ballet.</LD>
<LD>   Then one recent day I was cruising the Internet and stumbled onto
a description for a class called "yoga booty ballet." My childhood
experience aside, this sounded like something too intriguing to pass
up.</LD>
<LD>   Co-taught at Swerve in Los Angeles by friends Gillian Marloth and
Teigh McDonough, the class mixes plies, pop music and yoga--without
the tutus or Tchaikovsky. Instead, Marloth and McDonough, who
co-founded Swerve a year ago, focus the 90-minute class on
cardiovascular endurance using dance steps and yoga positions that
increase flexibility.</LD>
<TE>   At the class I attended, about 30 sweaty women thrust out their
backsides, as if imitating a kind of hyperactive hokeypokey step. At
first, I was a bit self-conscious, but soon I joined the others. "Let
your butt blossom out,'' Marloth said into a headset. "Shimmy,
shimmy, shimmy!" Packed together on a hardwood floor, we went
barefoot and stared into a wall of mirrors at our contorted bodies.
Colorful Chinese paper lanterns swayed above us as traffic hummed by
on 3rd Street. When the music switched from Dirty Vegas to
India.Arie, we formed ovals with our arms and cast our right legs
skyward into arabesques.</TE>
<TE>   The ballet moves made every muscle in my body work. My calves
screamed as we hoisted our bodies up on the balls of our feet for a
series of releves. My inner thighs grew taut as I molded my legs into
wide diamonds for grand plies. Even my thumbs got a workout as I
adjusted them during a passe.</TE>
<TE>   "Feel like a ballerina," said Marloth, who sported pigtails. "Feel
like a swan."</TE>
<TE>   With my wobbly, rectangular-shaped body, I felt more like a lame
duck. But it didn't matter. There were no teachers glaring at your
feet to see if you were in perfect first position. Now 36, Marloth
began studying classical ballet at age 9 in hopes of adding grace to
her figure-skating routines. McDonough, also 36, started ballet
lessons at age 5--like me--only she stuck with it until her early
20s. The two met as fine arts students at UC Santa Barbara. After
graduation, both left L.A. to pursue acting--Marloth in New York and
McDonough in Chicago. They returned in the mid-'90s.</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago, as an instructor teaching body sculpting, step
aerobics and other classes at Crunch Los Angeles, Marloth dreamed up
what would become yoga booty ballet. "I woke up one morning and said,
'Class, we're going to do something different.'' Marloth says the
name of the class is to get across the idea of a ballet-yoga hybrid
that emphasizes the "reshaping of the rear end."</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to evolve athletics into something more of a
spiritual pursuit and a creative relief," Marloth says. "The goal was
to make movement into art for people."</TE>
<TE>   The class became a hit at Crunch, and McDonough eventually joined
Marloth as a teacher. They took the concept with them when they
opened Swerve. Both still do occasional acting--McDonough also works
part-time as a personal trainer--but they focus their energies on
teaching at Swerve.</TE>
<TE>   Their efforts have pushed some participants toward a further
exploration of dance. Felicia de Jesus, 35, of Hollywood Hills
returned to formal ballet classes after just one month of taking yoga
booty ballet. But she keeps coming back to the class because,
compared to classical ballet, "this is just more fun and multiracial
with music like hip-hop," de Jesus said. "I grew up with Zoot suits
and low riders. I can't relate to Tchaikovsky."</TE>
<TE>   Though the class won't train people for the Kirov Ballet, it does
incorporate genuine ballet movements, even while eschewing the barre.
And it does highlight the breathing movements and body poses of
kundalini and hatha yoga.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, some ballet purists frown upon the idea of
injecting ballet into the fitness mainstream. Nadezhdav Koscuik, a
longtime instructor of Russian classical ballet who is co-artistic
director of the Westwood Dance Studio, says that if people really
want to get fit, they should stick to the traditional methods of
practice and technique-building. "Don't make a goulash out of
movement," she says. "There's zero benefit."</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, welcome the fusion of the modern and classical.
"Ballet is at the core of every movement system,'' says Yuri
Smaltzoff, 64, a former professional dancer with the Stuttgart Opera
House in Germany and various international dance companies. "It's
only now consciously being brought to the attention of people that we
have some points in common," said Smaltzoff, who runs Ballet &amp; Dance
Art in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   When I returned to yoga booty ballet for a second class, musician
Lucius Oliver provided a motivational accompaniment by pounding away
on a Middle Eastern drum called a doumbek.</TE>
<TE>   Three days a week, Oliver participates in the class, changing his
beat as students alter their steps. His high-energy drumming kept us
synchronized.</TE>
<TE>   After an hour of shaking and flexing our bodies, we unrolled teal
and purple mats yoga mats. Oliver soothed us with gentle clangs on a
Tibetan singing bowl as we eased into the relaxation and breathing.</TE>
<TE>   I felt so relaxed during the yoga portion that my heart rate
dropped to 55 beats per minute, down from a high of 147 while we
danced. For most of class, my heart rate stayed slightly below my
target zone. But as I rolled up from the yoga mat, I got a nice
surprise when I glanced at my heart rate monitor. All that movement
had burned off 590 calories. And it actually had helped me enjoy
ballet.</TE>

<HD>Canada Cracked Down on Herb</HD>

<AU>LINDA MARSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While the debate continues to rage in the United States about the
safety and regulation of ephedra, the Canadian government tackled the
issue in January when health officials recalled hundreds of
ephedra-based products, calling them "a serious risk to health."</LD>
<LD>   Canada allowed some previously approved over-the-counter cold
remedies containing ephedrine, a synthetic form of ephedra, to remain
on the market.</LD>
<LD>   But regulators cracked down on many unapproved ephedra diet pills
and energy boosters, many of which were imported from the United
States and sold clandestinely at fitness centers, health food stores
and other outlets.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike the U.S., Canada requires any product, including dietary
supplements, that claim a health benefit, to undergo the same
regulatory process as a prescription drug; in other words, a product
must be shown to be safe and effective before it can be sold.</TE>
<TE>   "We consider 'energy boosting' to be a health claim," says Ryan
Baker, a spokesman for Health Canada, that country's equivalent of
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.</TE>
<TE>   "If a product is used to enhance metabolism, lose weight, increase
energy or have a bodybuilding effect, then it's a drug," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, Health Canada issued a consumer warning about certain
ephedra products in June 1997, motivated in part by the expectation
that the FDA was planning to sharply curtail sale of preparations
containing ephedra.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the U.S. government subsequently backed off, "we
continued to monitor the situation," says Micheline Ho, a regulatory
manager for Health Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Growing reports of serious adverse side effects in Canada and the
U.S., which ranged from dizziness and headaches to heart attacks and
stroke, prompted Health Canada to issue another consumer alert in
June 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "We did look at what was happening worldwide, but other countries,
like England and Australia, have tight controls on these products,"
says Ho. "Only the U.S. was having similar problems."</TE>
<TE>   Following the June 2001 action, more unauthorized ephedra products
showed up for sale in Canada. "There was an increase in serious
adverse reactions, such as heart attacks and even deaths in young
people who were using ephedra for weight loss," says Ho, explaining
why Health Canada pulled these products off the market earlier this
year.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scientists learned more than a decade ago that eating nuts lowers the
risk of heart disease, and since then a number of studies have shown
that almonds, walnuts and peanuts help lower the amount of
artery-blocking LDL cholesterol in the blood. The trouble is, nuts
are also high in calories--and that has kept many experts from urging
Americans to eat more nuts.</LD>
<LD>   But Canadian researchers decided to look at whether exchanging
nuts for some other healthful snack would be worthwhile. The results
came out strongly in favor of the nuts.</LD>
<LD>   For three months, 27 volunteers, whose average age was 64,
consumed the same amount of calories. For one month, their daily diet
included a two-handful dose of almonds; another month, they ate a
daily snack of a handful of almonds and half of a low-fat,
whole-wheat healthy muffin; and during the third month, they had the
full muffin snack every day and no nuts. The subjects had a two-week
period between the months, during which they resumed their usual
diets.</LD>
<TE>   After one month of eating the full portion of almonds, the
subjects' LDL, or so-called bad, cholesterol decreased by 9.4% on
average. One month after eating the half-dose of almonds and half a
muffin, their LDL cholesterol dropped by 4.4%. There was no change in
their cholesterol levels after a month of snacking on the healthy
muffin and no nuts. None of the men and women gained or lost a
significant amount of weight on any of the three diets.</TE>
<TE>   The unsaturated fats in nuts have been given most of the credit
for lowering cholesterol, but Dr. David J.A. Jenkins, director of the
Clinical Nutrition and Risk Factor Modification Center at St.
Michael's Hospital in Toronto, says that the vegetable protein in
almonds may also be cholesterol-lowering. (Almonds have as much
protein by weight as they have fat.)</TE>
<TE>   What's not healthful, says Jenkins, the lead author, are nuts
roasted in hydrogenated fats and coated with salt.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadian government and the Almond Board of California funded
the study.</TE>

<TE>   Knee Surgeons Can Now Take a Backdoor Approach</TE>
<TE>   Surgeons who reconstruct the knee's posterior cruciate ligament,
which helps give the knee stability, may risk injury to the major
blood vessel at the back of the knee.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, surgeons have avoided the artery by getting to the
back of the knee from the front. However, that requires that the
transplanted tendon make a U-turn around the back of the leg bone.
Over time, the pull on the tendon causes it to stretch, and the knee
often becomes less stable.</TE>
<TE>   A new, more direct route--from the back of the knee--may help
solve the problem. "It's a straight shot to insert the new tendon
within the thighbone," says Dr. Mark D. Miller, co-director of sports
medicine at the University of Virginia Health System. He has done
about 100 reconstructions using the direct, back-to-front technique.
Because the tendon doesn't have to make that U-turn, it's stable
immediately after surgery and for years, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Surgeons using the new technique learned that the artery is
protected because it is pushed away from the site of the graft along
with the muscle that lies next to it during the operation. After the
reconstruction is complete, the muscle and artery slide back into
place.</TE>
<TE>   To prove that this is what happens, Miller injected barium into
the knee arteries of eight cadavers on which he did PCL operations.
When the area was viewed on X-rays, it was obvious that the knee
artery had been moved aside by about half an inch.</TE>

<TE>   There's an Exam to Detect Oral Cancer? No One Told Me</TE>
<TE>   Most people know about screening for breast, colon and prostate
cancer. But when it comes to oral cancer, which accounts for 3% of
all malignancies, few people are aware that there's a simple,
inexpensive and painless way to detect the disease. Even worse,
researchers say, most doctors and dentists don't routinely offer the
exam.</TE>
<TE>   During a free three-day oral cancer screening led by the New York
University College of Dentistry, interviewers asked people to
complete a survey about lip and mouth cancer. They found that
although 66% of the 803 participants had heard of oral cancer, only
39% had known there was an exam to detect it.</TE>
<TE>   The survey revealed that 75% of those who showed up realized that
tobacco is a risk factor, but only 25% were aware that frequent
alcohol consumption also increased their risk. And only 25% knew that
excess sun exposure was a risk factor for lip cancer. The American
Cancer Society recommends an annual oral cancer exam for everyone 40
years of age and older. The exam is a simple visual examination of
the tongue and lips and the mucous membranes of the mouth, with
palpation of the lymph nodes of the face and neck by a physician or
dentist. Although mouth and lip cancers are curable when diagnosed
early, more than half are diagnosed in a late stage. That's a
shocking statistic considering that oral cancer is relatively easy to
spot--85% of the cancers are visible.</TE>

<TE>   Gene Pair Makes Some Fetuses Susceptible to Mother's Smoking</TE>
<TE>   Children exposed to cigarette smoke often have asthma and an
increased sensitivity to environmental pollution. Now researchers
have found in a study of nearly 3,000 children that some of them are
genetically susceptible to the harmful effects of smoking even while
in the womb.</TE>
<TE>   USC researchers found that, among children whose mothers smoked
while pregnant, those with a particular genetic pattern were more
likely to have asthma and wheezing than children who didn't have the
gene variation. And the children who had been exposed in utero were
nearly four times more likely to be taken to the emergency room for
breathing difficulties than children who didn't have the genes.</TE>
<TE>   In the study, researchers took DNA samples from a cheek of each
child and examined them for a combination of genes that normally
direct the body to produce an enzyme that helps the lungs protect
themselves from pollutants. Children with one particular pair of
genes--known as GSTM1 null genotype--can't produce the enzyme.</TE>
<TE>   More than 45% of the children had inherited copies of that gene.
When exposed in utero, they had twice the risk for wheezing with
exercise. They were also twice as likely to have wheezing that was
serious enough to require medication for relief as children without
those genes.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers also found that children who had the genotype that
enabled them to produce the protective enzyme had no increased risk
of respiratory problems even though their mothers smoked while
pregnant. Although more research is needed to confirm these findings,
the researchers say, being able to identify those at high risk of
asthma could lead to helpful preventive steps. For now, Dr. Frank D.
Gilliland, professor of preventive medicine at Keck School of
Medicine says, "The best prevention is to have women quit smoking as
part of planning a family."</TE>

<HD>Simpler Car Seats Aim for Safety</HD>
<DH>Transportation* Starting this month, new autos must include
a built-in system that helps drivers install a child carrier quickly
and correctly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARI ROAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Protecting children in cars has come a long way from a few decades
ago when kids sat unrestrained without as much as a seat belt.</LD>
<LD>   But many parents still complain that today's child safety seats
are difficult to use, and federal studies show that the vast majority
are used incorrectly.</LD>
<LD>   This week, the federal government is taking a step toward
addressing those issues with new requirements intended to make car
seats easier to use.</LD>
<TE>   The law requires car-seat makers to produce seats with metal
fittings that snap or hook into short metal anchors in the car.
Automobile makers must install the anchors in the right and left
sides of rear passenger seats of all cars, minivans and light trucks
manufactured starting this month. The system, known as Latch (short
for Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children), should help adults
install a car seat quickly and correctly--words that, in the past,
have rarely been used to describe car-seat installation.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the easiest system to get your kid in," says Ellen Martin
of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. "You don't
need a PhD to get the seat in. It's not foolproof, but we think it
will save lots of lives."</TE>
<TE>   According to the federal government, 80% of child safety seats are
used incorrectly. Until now, the likelihood that a car seat would
protect a passenger in an accident depended largely on an adult's
ability to use the seat belts. The Latch system seats snap into place
and should not move more than an inch forward or sideways. In
forward-facing car seats, a tether at the top of the car seat helps
hold the seat tightly in place so that a child's head won't move too
far forward during a crash. The system may prevent 50 deaths and
3,000 injuries per year, according to Martin. Last year, 649 children
younger than 5 died in car crashes.</TE>
<TE>   "This should provide more consistency and something that will be
easier for people, on the whole, to learn about," says Stephanie M.
Tombrello, executive director of SafetyBeltSafe USA, a Torrance
nonprofit organization dedicated to child passenger safety.</TE>
<TE>   Tombrello, however, is critical of the government's decision to
allow car-seat manufacturers to produce two different kinds of Latch
restraint systems. One has a flexible lower anchor that uses a hook
attached to a length of belt webbing that is tightened like a seat
belt. The other type is a rigid anchor that clamps onto the car's
anchor. The flexible anchor allows room for error, she says.</TE>
<TE>   "The rigid anchor is much less likely to cause problems," she
says.</TE>
<TE>   The new car seats are expected to cost at least $10 more than
current car seats, with the rigid lower anchor seats costing the
most. Families with older cars and car seats still may use those
seats, but there are ways to retrofit both cars and car seats to the
Latch system.</TE>
<TE>   Some older car seats can be retrofitted with lower anchor
attachments that will work in new-model cars with the Latch anchors.
Retrofit kits can be found in many child specialty stores, such as
Toys R Us. Parents should make sure they buy a kit that will fit the
particular car-seat brand and model, Tombrello says.</TE>
<TE>   For families with older cars without the Latch anchors, the
Latch-equipped seats can still be installed using the seat belts. You
may also be able to add a tether anchor mounting in an older vehicle
by requesting a kit from your vehicle's manufacturer. However,
Tombrello says she does not believe that the majority of auto makers
are providing retrofitting kits. Consumers can find more information
on the Latch system at SafetyBeltSafe's Web site, www.carseat.org.</TE>
<TE>   Older car seats are still safe when used properly, safety experts
say.</TE>

<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's the food that helps you feel full with just a few calories and
is good enough at lowering cholesterol to earn a heart-healthy claim
from the Food and Drug Administration. Take another look at fiber, a
natural ingredient in berries, beans and bran that deserves a central
place in any healthy diet.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Dietary Guidelines, which provide a blueprint for
healthful eating and activity, recommend consuming a variety of
fruit, vegetables and whole-grain products daily. Not only do foods
such as this help your digestive system, they also generally have few
calories and quickly fill you up so you don't overeat. They're also
rich sources of vitamins, minerals and dietary fiber. Plus, they're
generally low in fat and provide energy through complex
carbohydrates, which increase blood sugar levels slowly and more
evenly, resulting in less need for insulin than refined carbohydrates
and highly processed foods.</LD>
<LD>   For these and other reasons, the National Cancer Institute, the
National Academy of Sciences, the American Institute for Cancer
Research and the American Heart Assn. also recommend eating plenty of
fiber-rich foods daily.</LD>
<TE>   Need more of an incentive? Studies suggest fiber may help reduce
the risk of obesity and may, in conjunction with a low-fat diet, help
control high blood pressure. Soluble fiber--think oatmeal--helps
whisk cholesterol from the blood. Insoluble fiber--think bran and
other whole grains--helps move food more quickly through the
intestine and appears to help prevent the initial occurrence of
colorectal cancer.</TE>
<TE>   There are limits to fiber's magic, however. Two recent, large
clinical trials found that a high-fiber diet did not prevent the
recurrence of colon polyps.</TE>
<TE>   In choosing fiber sources, the real McCoy is generally better.
There's no evidence that taking fiber supplements such as Benefiber
or Metamucil provides the same wide-ranging health benefits as eating
a variety of high-fiber foods, which also contain a slew of healthful
phytonutrients.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on your current diet, you may need to work a little to
meet the recommended 25 to 35 grams of fiber per day. But if you're
willing to add beans and whole-fiber cereal to your daily intake,
it's not tough to reach the goal. Here's what you need to know:</TE>
<TE>   * Read the fine print. A package of multigrain JJ Flats Breadflats
lists unbleached, enriched wheat flour as the first ingredient. But
scan the nutrition facts label and you'll learn that one serving has
less than a gram of dietary fiber--no better than a saltine. That's
because wheat flour, enriched flour and degerminated corn meal are
not whole grains. Aim instead for products that list whole wheat,
whole cornmeal, whole oats, whole rye, cracked wheat, whole barley,
bulgur, brown rice, popcorn, oatmeal or graham flour as the first
label ingredients.</TE>
<TE>   * Breakfast like a whole-fiber champion with whole-grain cereals.
Just eating a bowl of the right cereal can get you halfway to your
daily goal. Half a cup of General Mills Fiber One has 14 grams of
fiber. Eat a cup of Kellogg's Raisin Bran, Post's 100 Percent Bran or
Post's Shredded Wheat 'N Bran and you'll get 8 grams of fiber--eight
times the amount found in the same amount of corn flakes. Can't
stomach a whole bowl of high-fiber bran cereals? Mix one-quarter cup
on top of your regular cereal for a fiber boost. And don't forget
oatmeal. About one cup of cooked oatmeal will give you 2 grams of
soluble fiber and two grams of insoluble fiber.</TE>
<TE>   * Reach for the beans. They're loaded with fiber, up to 17 grams
per cup, another boost toward that daily goal. A few good options:
hummus, a Middle Eastern favorite made from garbanzo beans (6 grams
of fiber per half-cup); baked beans (6.5 grams per half-cup) or a
bean burrito (about 6 to 8 grams of fiber) with a corn tortilla (for
an extra gram of fiber).</TE>
<TE>   * Eat a baked potato. A medium baked potato with the skin provides
5 grams of fiber.</TE>
<TE>   * Switch from white bread to whole wheat. Just that one change
alone will give you up to 2 grams more fiber per slice.</TE>
<TE>   * Snack on berries. A cup of raspberries (8 grams of fiber) has
four times more than a slice of whole-wheat bread. Blackberries are a
close second, with 7 grams per cup.</TE>
<TE>   * Rate your fiber intake. Log on to the American Institute for
Cancer Research Web site at

<HD>A Tug of War in a Larger Battle</HD>
<DH>Ephedra is now under intense scrutiny. Its fate could
affect other supplements.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINDA MARSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wes Siegner is trying to save ephedra, the herbal stimulant that is
under attack from a chorus of critics who say it is dangerous to your
health. Even opponents of the lobbyist marvel at his victories so
far, but it is looking more and more as if he is fighting a losing
battle.</LD>
<LD>   Siegner's task grew more difficult last month with news of a
federal investigation of Metabolife International, a leading seller
of ephedra in the United States. The fate of Metabolife, and of
ephedra generally, is likely to influence the broader debate over the
effectiveness and safety of herbs, sports drinks, diet pills and
hundreds of other products for which Americans spend about $4.2
billion annually.</LD>
<LD>   "Siegner's job is to protect the industry, and thus far he's
succeeded," says Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of Public Citizen's
Health Research Group, a consumer watchdog group in Washington, D.C.,
that has called on the Food and Drug Administration to take ephedra
off the market. "But time is running out."</LD>
<TE>   The anti-ephedra forces are gaining momentum as government
regulators, health officials, scientists and consumer groups push for
tougher regulation of the herb or its removal from the market
altogether. These critics, including the influential American Medical
Assn., say ephedra, the active ingredient in hundreds of energy
boosters and diet products, is a health hazard. They cite evidence
linking it to heart attacks, strokes, seizures--and more than 100
deaths.</TE>
<TE>   Seven states have already enacted tough new rules regarding the
sale of ephedra products. The Canadian government in January issued a
national recall of supplements containing ephedra. The National
Football League and the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. have
outlawed the use of performance-enhancing supplements that contain
ephedra, partly due to safety concerns.</TE>
<TE>   The growing number of serious medical problems linked to the
herbal stimulant, ranging from dizziness, headaches, heart
palpitations and high blood pressure to heart attacks, seizures,
strokes and death, threatens not only to derail ephedra but to engulf
the entire dietary supplement industry. The FDA alone has received
reports of nearly 1,400 incidents since 1993. Poison control centers
nationwide collected 9,000 more during the same period.</TE>
<TE>   And then, in last month the Justice Department launched a criminal
probe into whether executives at San Diego-based Metabolife
International made false statements about the existence of 13,000
consumer complaints of serious health problems, at least 80 of which
included deaths, seizures, heart attacks or other medical
emergencies.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA has sought unsuccessfully for years to obtain these
reports, which Metabolife refused to provide until the government
opened its investigation. In the jargon of health regulators, such
incidents are commonly referred to as "adverse events."</TE>
<TE>   Siegner, a lanky man with a plaintive face, looks more like the
high school biology teacher he once was than an Ivy League-educated
lobbyist whose role is to rebut the arguments of scientists and
politicians alike. Although he says he has no need to take ephedra,
he would do so "in a heartbeat." In conversation, the 50-year-old
Buffalo-born lawyer never strays far from his essential--and,
clearly, well-practiced--message.</TE>
<TE>   "Adverse events don't prove causality," he says. "These are a
random set of events that happened to people who happened to be
taking ephedra."</TE>
<TE>   When millions of people use a product--any product--the law of
averages dictates that a certain percentage of them will have heart
attacks, strokes and seizures, which may or may not be linked to use
of the product. Only a rigorous scientific study, say experts, in
which one group is taking the supplement and another is using a
placebo or dummy pill, can prove a direct connection. Otherwise the
evidence is circumstantial.</TE>
<TE>   The Metabolife investigation "makes the situation more difficult,"
says Siegner, who contends that it diverts attention from the more
important issue of ephedra safety. Siegner has led the industry's
so-far effective campaign to keep ephedra products on the market by
raising doubts about the link between ephedra and medical problems,
and by challenging industry critics at every turn. Even though
doctors still aren't sure if ephedra is dangerous, the supplement
makers that Siegner represents contend that these products are safe
when used as directed on the label.</TE>
<TE>   But critics point to the mounting evidence of serious side
effects. This has prompted some lawmakers, such as Sen. Richard
Durbin (D-Ill.), to push for stricter regulation of dietary
supplements, which could hurt the industry by squeezing out smaller
companies, driving up prices and curtailing availability of products.
"The existing laws simply do not address the current dietary
supplement situation," he said at a congressional hearing last month,
"and our government shouldn't just stand by as more and more
Americans unwittingly risk their health and even their lives."</TE>
<TE>   So far, Siegner and the supplement industry have managed to blunt
many government efforts to restrict the availability of ephedra,
including repeated attempts by the FDA to regulate the herb over the
last five years. Efforts by Siegner and the Dutko Group, a
high-profile Washington, D.C., lobbying group, along with nearly $4
million in contributions to both the Democratic and Republican
parties and to Washington politicians during the past decade, have so
far largely thwarted attempts at stricter regulation.</TE>
<TE>   "Wes has handled a very difficult and complicated set of issues
very well," says Loren D. Israelsen, executive director of the Utah
Natural Products Alliance, an industry trade group in Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   Siegner, whose specialty is product-liability cases, was hired in
1997 as a lobbyist for the American Herbal Products Assn., a trade
group whose members include such industry heavyweights as Herbalife,
Nature's Way and Weider Nutrition. The Ephedra Education Council, the
industry's public relations arm, was formed later by a consortium of
ephedra makers, including Rexall Sundown, General Nutrition Cos. and
Twin Laboratories.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, when the FDA sought to limit dosages of ephedra and
require warning labels on products, Siegner helped persuade Congress
to order a General Accounting Office audit. The GAO concluded that
the FDA's proposed rules were based on only 13 cases of adverse
events, and that the data in those reports were too sketchy to blame
them on ephedra, scuttling any regulatory action.</TE>
<TE>   Since passage of the Dietary Supplement Health Education Act in
1994, supplement makers have not had to prove that their
products--herbal or otherwise--are safe and effective before they put
them on the market. The law, in effect, mandates that the FDA assume
that supplements are harmless until proven otherwise, according to
Christine L. Taylor, director of the FDA's Office of Nutritional
Products, Labeling and Dietary Supplements in Rockville, Md. To
remove a supplement from the market, the agency must demonstrate that
it is dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   After the release of the GAO report, the FDA asked UC San
Francisco researchers to review 140 adverse-event reports received by
the agency between June 1997 and March 1999. In an article published
in the New England Journal of Medicine in December 2000, they
concluded that 87 of the medical problems reported, including 10
deaths, 17 strokes and seizures, and 13 cases of permanent
impairment, were likely caused by supplements containing ephedra.</TE>
<TE>   In response, the Ephedra Education Council gathered its own panel
of prominent research scientists to look at the product's safety
data. The group concluded that the "available information" did not
demonstrate a causal relationship between ephedra and serious medical
emergencies when the herb was used in the industry's recommended
individual dosage of 25 milligrams, and no more than 100 milligrams a
day.</TE>
<TE>   "Scientific evaluations will differ, but the experts are not all
that far apart," says Siegner. "They're just telling different
versions of the same story."</TE>
<TE>   Critics contend, however, that these dueling experts muddy the
scientific waters and allow sales to continue, raising the risk of
more deaths and disability.</TE>
<TE>   "The industry will stop at nothing to cripple the proceedings and
delay any regulation regarding ephedra," says Bill J. Gurley, a
pharmaceutical scientist at the University of Arkansas for Medical
Sciences in Little Rock. "But what they effectively do is prolong the
inevitable."</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Gurley and other researchers at the University of
Arkansas analyzed 20 ephedra products, including Xenadrine,
Metabolife, Ripped Fuel and Natural Trim. They found that the vast
majority of products contained pharmaceutical-grade synthetic
stimulants, such as ephedrine, pseudoephedrine and norephedrine,
which could be dangerous when combined with ephedra. They also found
that the amount of active ingredient in half the supplement products
was at least 20% more, or less, than listed on the label. And the
amounts varied on different lots of the same products.</TE>
<TE>   The study appeared on the Internet site of the American Journal of
Health-System Pharmacy a few days before its print publication in May
2000. Siegner placed three calls to the journal's editor, C. Richard
Talley, and showed up unannounced at the journal's Bethesda, Md.,
offices.</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted to present evidence to convince me not to publish the
paper," Talley recalls. "But it was too late; it was already on the
Internet."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the incident, Siegner says the journal article was
"littered with inaccuracies." Although the editors invited him to
write a letter of rebuttal for publication, he says he didn't do so
because "it wasn't possible to address all of them in a brief letter
to the editor."</TE>
<TE>   As debate continues over who's right about ephedra safety, the
federal government has stepped in to try to clarify matters. The U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services in June asked researchers at
Rand Corp., an influential think tank based in Santa Monica, to
review 1,300 ephedra-related medical emergencies. The Rand report is
expected to be released this fall, after which the federal health
agency will determine if additional research is needed.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Siegner says the FDA "is now headed in the right
direction."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the only thing experts do agree on is that there's no way
to gauge the true magnitude of the problem. Because ephedra is a
dietary supplement, not a drug, there is no formal mechanism to
report adverse reactions, and companies are not obligated to inform
the FDA of complaints.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers say that people are also less likely to associate side
effects, such as dizziness, nausea or headaches, with dietary
supplements than they are with prescription or over-the-counter
medications.</TE>
<TE>   Little wonder the FDA estimates that fewer than 1% of adverse
events from supplement usage are officially reported. Public
Citizen's Wolfe contends that the 100 deaths in FDA files are "the
tip of the iceberg."</TE>
<TE>   "There is political pressure on the FDA from Congress, which
supports the industry's argument that there's no proof of harm and
that it's all a coincidence," says Dr. Neal L. Benowitz, a professor
of medicine at UC San Francisco who has studied FDA reports on
ephedra. "But how much more proof do you need before you do something
to protect public health?"</TE>
<TE>   Siegner, however, says that judgment is premature. "The body
counts," he says, "are meaningless unless we show scientifically
there is a connection."</TE>

<LD>Question: What do you recommend as the absolute best no-frills
workout for quick weight loss?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Your ideal weight loss exercise must burn calories but
also be something you will do consistently. (My adrenaline gets going
when I skydive and rock climb, but I don't do these sports enough to
burn off a ton of fat.) The best workout varies by person: We should
all cross-train and do what suits our bodies best. But here are some
suggestions for a fast calorie burn.</LD>
<LD>   Running: It burns a lot of calories (eight to 15 per minute) and
requires relatively little skill and minimal equipment (a good pair
of running shoes). Even at a relatively slow pace, you'll burn a
respectable number of calories. If you run faster, do interval runs
(increase your speed periodically to get your heart rate up) or run
up hills, you'll melt away calories even more quickly.</LD>
<TE>   Walking: Although its calorie burn (four to six per minute) seems
modest, walking is an extremely effective weight-loss tool. You can
go for miles without pooping out or getting injured. The National
Weight Control Registry, a collaborative venture between the
University of Colorado and the University of Pittsburgh, found that a
majority of people who successfully lose weight and keep it off burn
about 1,000 calories a week by walking. Also, there's no equipment
needed except a high-quality pair of walking shoes.</TE>
<TE>   Resistance training: Besides burning six to eight calories per
minute, lifting weights revs up your metabolism so you burn more
calories even when you're at rest. For every pound of muscle you pack
on to your frame, you'll burn an additional 30 calories per day. Not
only is regular weight training the definitive body sculpting and
metabolism-boosting activity, it helps preserve and build bone
density, thereby preventing osteoporosis.</TE>

<LD>   Background: This national nonprofit group provides education and
support for parents of children with learning disabilities or other
special needs. The Web site is an all-purpose resource, with advice,
interactive tests and helpful phone numbers.</LD>
<TE>   What works: Discovery Tool is a detailed self-questionnaire that
can help parents decide if a child has a physical or mental handicap
or would benefit from a visit to a professional. At a minimum, the
test will give parents a good idea of how problems are diagnosed.
Also, the site's glossary of terms cuts through child-development
jargon, which can be eye-glazing. It's reassuring to know, for
example, that a "failure to thrive" refers to children who are very
small for their age. The definition pages will help consumers
understand how child psychologists think, dividing the boy's or
girl's world into cognitive function, sensory skills, social
development, and so on. And, by punching in a ZIP Code, parents can
locate nearby seminars and services.</TE>

<HD>Womb Theory Challenged</HD>
<DH>Research questions idea that much of adult health is set
before birth and calls studies linking newborn weight, high blood
pressure flawed</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMMA ROSS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>The rapidly emerging theory that adult health is set to a significant
degree before birth, by conditions in the womb, is getting its first
major challenge with new research questioning the validity of some
evidence supporting the idea.</LD>
<LD>   In a critique published last week in the Lancet medical journal,
scientists conclude that the reported link between low birth weight
and higher blood pressure later in life, an early cornerstone of the
theory, may not be as strong as previously thought. Because of flaws
in the studies, it may not exist, the report said.</LD>
<LD>   The theory, known as the fetal origins of adult disease
hypothesis, postulates that when a fetus is undernourished, it
diverts resources to areas it really needs at the time, such as the
brain, at the expense of organs it will need later, such as the
lungs.</LD>
<TE>   Proponents believe that may permanently change the baby's
structure, functioning and metabolism, setting it up to be more
vulnerable than normal to the development in adulthood of heart
disease and related disorders such as high blood pressure, stroke and
diabetes.</TE>
<TE>   The concept first emerged in 1986, but it has gained recognition
among scientists in the last five years and has become a hot area of
medical research. The field had its first international research
conference last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Surprisingly, this hypothesis doesn't seem to have gone through
[rigorous scrutiny] very much. It seems to have been adopted very
widely, very rapidly without too much in the way of critical
appraisal," said Oxford University scientist Rory Collins, one of the
lead investigators in the new analysis.</TE>
<TE>   The critique involved a reanalysis of 103 studies that examined
birth weight and blood pressure.</TE>
<TE>   The larger studies showed a weaker link between blood pressure and
birth weight than the smaller studies did.</TE>
<TE>   One problem is that smaller studies are more likely to find more
extreme results and positive results are more likely to be published.
That means published evidence from the small studies might
overestimate the true effect, Collins said. To counter that
possibility, the new analysis gave more importance to the larger
studies.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of the fetal hypothesis have estimated that a 2.2-pound
higher birth weight is typically associated with a 2-to 4-point lower
blood pressure.</TE>
<TE>   After re-weighting the studies to eliminate any bias introduced by
publishing only the small studies with strong results, the new
analysis concluded that the 2.2-pound extra birth weight was linked
to about a half-point lower blood pressure.</TE>
<TE>   The earlier studies also adjusted their statistics to take into
account the current weight of the patients when they had their blood
pressure measured as adults. That obscures the real relationship
between birth weight and blood pressure, Collins said.</TE>
<TE>   "When we removed the adjustment for current weight, the
relationship appeared to disappear," Collins said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a serious concern when something that is considered by the
proponents to be their best evidence appears to have such serious
problems," he said. "That's certainly not to say there's nothing in
it, but it may mean that the strength of any association is much less
than had been claimed, if at all."</TE>
<TE>   Collins said other aspects of the theory should be similarly
studied to prevent research money being wasted on dead ends.</TE>
<TE>   Most proponents of the fetal theory said the new analysis was
constructive criticism, but did not accept the interpretation. "The
four largest studies completely dominate, and effectively they chuck
away all the evidence apart from those," said Chris Martyn, an
epidemiologist at Southampton University in England who conducted
some of the studies that were reanalyzed.</TE>
<TE>   "The four largest studies used the most primitive methods--people
were asked to remember their birth weight and their most recent blood
pressure measurement," he said. "If you weighted the studies not by
their size but by their quality, you might come up with a completely
different answer."</TE>
<TE>   Proponent Kent Thornburg, director of the Heart Research Center at
Oregon Health Sciences University, added that since experiments in a
variety of animal species show a clear correlation between elevated
blood pressure and fetal undergrowth, he has no doubt that the
correlation is genuine.</TE>

<HD>With Each Advance in Parkinson's, a Question</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOEL HAVEMANN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>People who study brain disorders say they know more about Parkinson's
disease than just about any other. That's a tribute to the brain's
awesome complexity. The long list of unanswered questions about
Parkinson's is growing shorter at an agonizingly slow pace.</LD>
<LD>   To researchers, each unanswered question is a challenge. They know
that Parkinson's cascade of symptoms--tremor, bad posture and
slowness of movement for starters--occurs because certain nerve cells
in the brain die. But no one knows what kills them, and whoever finds
the answer will become rich and famous. Whoever finds a way to stop
the process, thereby curing the disease, will become 10 times more
so.</LD>
<LD>   But to patients, the unanswered questions are a source of
continual frustration and unease. I know. I've had the disease for a
dozen years, and I've studied it about as carefully as a layman can.
And I still have great difficulty making choices about the proper
course of treatment.</LD>
<TE>   When, for example, should we start taking levodopa? This is the
drug that helps the brain make dopamine, the chemical that the dead
brain cells no longer manufacture. Dopamine is a critical part of the
circuits in the nervous system that enable ordinary movement.</TE>
<TE>   One school of thought is that levodopa, although it makes us feel
good now, is bad for our long-term health. The more we take it, the
less effective it becomes and the worse the side effects grow. After
some amount of total use, levodopa does more harm than good. If this
view is right, we should abstain from levodopa until Parkinson's
symptoms make us barely able to function.</TE>
<TE>   Another view, held by equally eminent scientists, is that levodopa
does no long-term damage and may even do good. True, its bad side
effects ultimately overtake its benefits. But the timing depends on
Parkinson's natural destruction of brain cells, not on how much
levodopa has been swallowed. If this view is right, it doesn't matter
how much levodopa we take during Parkinson's early phases. In fact,
if we refrain from taking levodopa too long, we'll suffer some
problems (muscle deterioration, for example) that cannot be reversed
when we finally take levodopa.</TE>
<TE>   Who's right? Darned if I know. Thirty of the world's leading
Parkinson's experts convened a meeting in Paris in 1998 to cut
through the uncertainty and develop a consensus that would guide
neurologists as they advise their patients. But the consensus
conference couldn't reach a consensus. The majority view was that
levodopa is not harmful in the long term and that it should be used
to preserve quality of life while the quality of life is still worth
preserving. But there was plenty of disagreement. Three eminent
American specialists, for example, said they had seen no proof that
levodopa does not kill cells in the substantia nigra, the portion of
the brain where dopamine is produced.</TE>
<TE>   In my uncertainty, I try to take enough levodopa to keep
functioning--but no more. Sometimes I skimp too much. When that
happens at work, I close the door to my office and shake in private
until my next levodopa pill kicks in. If it happens while I'm driving
and there are no other drivers with me who can take the wheel, I pull
off the road and walk until I steady down.</TE>
<TE>   Sooner or later, the pills can no longer lift us out of total
misery. What do we do then? The best answer as of today: See a brain
surgeon. But don't expect any easy choices. Uncertainty likewise
clouds the decisions about whether and when to undergo any of the
available brain surgeries.</TE>
<TE>   One kind of surgery aims at masking Parkinson's symptoms after the
pills no longer do the job. An electrode is lodged in one of several
parts of the brain, along a neural circuit that is overactive in
Parkinson's. From the electrode, a wire runs under the skin to a
pacemaker that is implanted under the collarbone. A magnet passed
over the pacemaker can turn the electrode to high, low or off,
depending on the need. Each jolt of electricity delivered by the
electrode has the effect of short-circuiting part of the overactive
circuits and restoring them to normal.</TE>
<TE>   The operation seems to work pretty well--when it works. Two of my
friends found themselves much more mobile after the operation was
performed on one side of their brains. But as with all surgeries,
particularly in the brain, there are dangers. As it happens, both of
my friends tried the same operation a second time, on the other side
of the brain. Both of them suffered bleeding within the brain, and
one had to stay in the hospital for several weeks to recuperate.
Another operation, at once more experimental and more familiar, holds
the potential to cure the disease. Living brain cells from an aborted
7-week-old fetus are injected into the damaged part of the brain and,
if all goes well, make themselves at home and replace the cells that
have died.</TE>
<TE>   This operation, which ran afoul of the anti-abortion movement, is
all but impossible to get today in the United States. But during the
Clinton administration, the government approved two trials of the
procedure, with half of the participants receiving fetal cells and
the other half, a control group, undergoing a sham operation in which
no cells were actually delivered. The participants were told that
those who underwent the sham operation could get the real thing when
the trial was over. (Dr. Curt Freed, the lead researcher for this
trial, has written a lively account of fetal transplantation, called
"Healing the Brain.")</TE>
<TE>   In keeping with Parkinson's treatments, the trial yielded mixed
results. The good news is that the fetal cells took hold in most of
the patients. The bad news is that for a few, the cells took hold
with a vengeance and manufactured too much dopamine, which left these
patients with writhing motions (called dyskinesias) that they
couldn't easily control.</TE>
<TE>   One of these five is George Doeschner. He got the sham operation
the first time and chose to get the real thing when the trial was
over. Although he was judged to have a dopamine surplus after the
real operation, he was able to return to his job as an electrician in
downtown New York office buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Last Sept. 11 found him on the 34th floor of the first of the two
World Trade Center towers to be struck by hijacked jets. Despite his
"disability," he walked down 33 flights of stairs to safety before
the tower collapsed. Now, nearly a year later, he's still working,
and a couple of months ago he had his first job back in the financial
district. "From where I was working, I had a great view of the hole
in the ground," he said. "It was spooky."</TE>
<TE>   And the trial produced a further ambiguity.</TE>
<TE>   Although the fetal cells thrived in nearly all of those who
received them, they seemed to relieve the symptoms only of those 60
and younger. Doeschner was 55 when he had the operation, but I'm now
59. Does that mean I have to move fast or it will be too late to
benefit from this form of treatment? I think not; I suspect that the
magic 60-year-old line was a product of the trial's design, not of
any magical change that occurs in Parkinson's brains at age 60.</TE>
<TE>   But the 60-year threshold introduces a new uncertainty. On the one
hand, I'd like to wait as long as possible to get this operation.
That might give researchers time to figure out what kind of cells to
use (brain cells grown from stem cells may work better than fetal
cells), how many of them to use and exactly where to put them. On the
other hand, I don't want to wait so long that the fetal cells won't
relieve my symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   Which is the right course? Darned if I know.</TE>

<HD>Soda Ban: A Drop in the Bucket</HD>
<DH>Nutrition* Experts laud the L.A. school district's decision
but say it alone won't prevent obesity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BENEDICT CAREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They can leave kids wired and nutritionally starved, filling them
with calories without suppressing appetite. Soft drinks and school
have never been an ideal mix, many nutritionists and educators say,
and the Los Angeles Unified School District board's decision last
week to ban soda sales at all district schools was long overdue.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the ban by itself, slated to begin in January 2004, will go
only so far to curb what public health officials say is an epidemic
of childhood obesity. "The vote was a triumph, and we're delighted
with it," said Dr. Francine Kaufman, director of the endocrinology
division at Childrens Hospital in Los Angeles and chairwoman of a
county task force to combat childhood obesity. "At the same time, we
have a lot more to do. I consider this a first baby step."</LD>
<LD>   The prevalence of obesity among children has more than doubled
since 1980, to about 12% nationwide, and the rate may be more than
twice that in low-income areas of Los Angeles, county officials
estimate. Heavy adolescents are much more likely than their peers to
become obese as adults, research shows, and this puts them at high
risk of developing type 2 diabetes, a progressive condition that can
lead to vision problems, heart disease and a shortened life
expectancy.</LD>
<TE>   For all that, researchers have been at a loss to identify any one
trend or eating habit that accounts for the increase. "There's a risk
of oversimplifying as soon as you pull out one food and say that's
responsible," said Barbara Schneeman, a nutrition professor at UC
Davis who has served on the federal government's dietary guidelines
panel. "It's a matter of total lifestyle, of changing not only what
we eat but how we live."</TE>
<TE>   Federal regulations already prohibit schools participating in the
National School Lunch Program, which provides meals to low-income
students, from selling or serving so-called junk food during school
breakfast and lunch hours. Districts in Oakland, New York City and
Texas also have restrictions in place on soda sales.</TE>
<TE>   But so far there's little evidence that these measures have had
any impact on kids' health. "The bans are simply too new," said
Adrienne Sobolak, a spokeswoman for the Texas Board of Education,
"and no one's done any studies, as far as we're aware."</TE>
<TE>   Appointed in January by the Board of Supervisors to study
childhood-obesity prevention, the county's Task Force on Children and
Youth Physical Fitness last week recommended that the county
undertake a campaign that goes far beyond banning soda sales. Among
the recommendations:</TE>
<TE>   * Increase the amount of time devoted to physical education. Gym
classes have been shortened or cut at many schools, and often kids
who do have regular P.E. find themselves in classes of 50 or more,
the task force reports.</TE>
<TE>   * Create partnerships among parks, communities and schools to make
more space available for recreation. In L.A. County, 25% of parents
with kids under age 5 say they don't have access to safe playgrounds,
according to a recent Los Angeles County health survey.</TE>
<TE>   * Improve the quality of foods eaten at school lunch. According to
a report released last week by the Physicians Committee for
Responsible Medicine, a public advocacy group, nine out of 10 of the
nation's largest school districts are failing to provide
nutritionally optimal meals. In the study, dietitians analyzed menus
from 15 days at each school, rating the food according to government
guidelines on the availability of fruit, vegetables and lower-fat
meals. Out of a possible 100 points granted for high nutrition
standards, Fort Lauderdale's school district led the group with 85;
New York came in at 70; and Los Angeles scored in the middle of the
pack, at 60. Many kids who are entitled to a free school lunch even
leave campus to eat at fast-food outlets, or just grab a snack and
soda from nearby vending machines, teachers say.</TE>
<TE>   Going after sales of those soft drinks made a good first target
for a simple reason: sugar. About 33% of the artificially added sugar
teenagers consume comes from carbonated drinks, according to the U.S.
Department of Agriculture. And when sugar is consumed in liquid form,
it adds calories without putting much of a dent in appetite,
researchers say.</TE>
<TE>   "Consuming liquid calories may increase how much we eat later in
the day, whereas getting calories from solid food reduces what we eat
later," said Megan McCrory, a nutrition researcher at Tufts
University. "You're much better off getting sugar calories in an
apple, or even a piece of candy, than from a sweetened drink."</TE>
<TE>   In one study, researchers in Georgia examined detailed food and
drink diaries kept by 323 healthy adults for a week. Drinking
unsweetened coffee and tea or diet soda did not affect the overall
amount of food the men and women ate. But on days when they drank
sweetened drinks they tended to consume more calories, the diaries
showed. Eating a 100-calorie solid snack can cut down on the calories
consumed at the next meal by more than half; after drinking 100
calories, many people will eat as much as 9% more than usual at their
next meal, McCrory said.</TE>
<TE>   This relation holds true for most sugar-sweetened drinks, not just
soda pop. In one of the most widely cited studies linking sweet
drinks and obesity, doctors at Children's Hospital in Boston
monitored the health and diets of 548 sixth-and seventh-graders for
about two years. In this age group about one in 10 children become
overweight enough to cause doctors concern. After controlling for the
students' age, body shape and other factors, the researchers reported
that each additional sweetened drink consumed daily increased that
risk by about 60%. The drinks that had this effect included not only
sodas but fruit punch, lemonade, Kool-Aid and sugar-sweetened iced
tea.</TE>
<TE>   "The message is: Energy is energy; calories are calories," said
Dr. Mayer Davidson, director of the clinical trials unit at King-Drew
Medical Center in Los Angeles. "There's no difference whether you're
getting them from a Coke or a flavored fruit drink."</TE>
<TE>   The district's new policy will allow sales of water, milk,
beverages with at least 50% fruit juice, and sports drinks with less
than 42 grams of sugar per 20-ounce serving. Board members debated
whether milk sales should be banned as well: an 8-ounce serving of 2%
milk has 5 grams of fat and 120 calories; flavored milks have about
50 more calories. But the drinks are also a rich source of calcium.</TE>
<TE>   "Ideally we would like to get all junk food out of the schools,"
said Kaufman, "but the political process is incremental."</TE>

<HD>Strong Bones Have Another Ally: Vitamin K</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA URSELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is not just calcium-rich milk and dairy foods that count in the
fight against osteoporosis, new research shows. Vegetable oils,
liver, cauliflower and cabbage are also a vital part of a sound
nutritional battle plan.</LD>
<LD>   These foods are rich in vitamin K, a seldom-mentioned vitamin that
scientists say aids in building strong bones and that may help
protect against the threat of osteoporosis.</LD>
<LD>   Just as our body produces some vitamin D--also needed for strong
bones because it helps with calcium absorption--most of our body's
vitamin K needs are met by bacteria in the intestines that produce
this vitamin. What we don't get naturally must come from regular
dietary sources. (The minimum daily requirements of vitamin K for
adults is 65 micrograms for women and 80 micrograms for men.) But
most Americans' intake of vitamin K is low or average; when intake is
less than 50 micrograms a day, signs of inadequacy in bone health
begin to show.</LD>
<TE>   New research suggests that one reason many Americans get
insufficient amounts of vitamin K may be linked to plant oils. These
vegetable oils, including canola, soy and sunflower, should supply up
to a third of our daily needs. But Americans' intake of these oils
often comes from a hardened form of oil found in fast food, baked
goods such as cookies and crackers, and vegetable margarine. The
hardening process alters vitamin K, making it no longer available to
the bone, says Sarah Booth, an assistant professor at Tufts
University who heads the school's Vitamin K Research Laboratory.</TE>
<TE>   To boost your intake of vitamin K, it's best to avoid eating too
many processed foods and margarine and to ingest oils in their pure
form--in salad dressings, for example. Foods richest in vitamin K are
green vegetables such as broccoli, spinach, kale, cabbage and
lettuce. Liver, oats and lentils provide smaller amounts of this
vitamin.</TE>
<TE>   Besides increasing your intake of vitamins and minerals, you may
also want to avoid certain foods to help strengthen your bones. While
whole-grain cereals are believed to offer many health benefits,
unprocessed bran--which is often added to cereals--is not advisable.
This is because whole-grain fiber contains substances called phytates
that have been shown to reduce the body's ability to absorb and make
beneficial use of calcium.</TE>
<TE>   Enzymes in yeast used for baking bread destroy most of the
phytates, as do food-processing methods that require heat, such as
those used to make high-fiber whole-grain breakfast cereals. In raw
bran, however, the phytates are still active and may potentially
compromise calcium levels. Oxalic acid, a plant chemical present in
rhubarb, has similar calcium-binding effects.</TE>

facilities' credit and revenues at risk</DH>

<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The nation's commercial airports, already reeling from a drop-off in
travel spurred by a prolonged recession and the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks, are bracing for another downturn as the beleaguered airline
industry restructures.</LD>
<LD>   The recent bankruptcy filing by US Airways Group Inc. and the
threat of similar action by United Airlines parent UAL Corp. may
place improvement projects and some airports' credit at risk. And
revenue sources that airports rely on, such as passenger concessions,
could be reduced as airlines further reduce capacity.</LD>
<LD>   At Los Angeles International Airport, where passenger totals are
at six-year lows, officials are concerned that United again will cut
its schedule. The carrier, the airport's largest tenant, canceled 40%
of its flights at LAX last fall and has said it won't add any back
until more people start flying.</LD>
<TE>   Elk Grove Township, Ill.-based UAL generates about 20% of LAX's
aviation revenue through landing fees and rent for space in Terminals
6, 7 and 8 and maintenance and cargo facilities. Under a use
agreement with the city, which is similar to those at other airports,
United would be responsible for these fees even if it filed for
bankruptcy protection. The airline pays the airport $42 million a
year in landing fees and rent.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts called this long-accepted tenet of airport finance
into question recently: "Under a Chapter 11 bankruptcy scenario, a
terminal lease would be considered ... [a] contract that [a] debtor
airline would have the option to either accept or reject as it
reorganizes," analysts for Moody's Investors Service wrote in a May
report.</TE>
<TE>   Recent announcements by US Airways, AMR Corp.'s American Airlines
and Continental Airlines Inc. that they will cut their winter
schedules threaten to hammer concession and parking revenue just as
many airports are initiating million-dollar facility upgrades to meet
federal security mandates.</TE>
<TE>   "Our concern doesn't lie so much in terminal rents and landing
fees as it does on concessions and parking if fewer planes and fewer
people are flying," said Karen Sisson, chief financial officer for
Los Angeles World Airports, the city agency that operates LAX.</TE>
<TE>   Concession revenue--the airport agency's second-biggest money
maker after aviation revenue, which includes terminal rents and
landing fees--fell 35% last year and is expected to be down 30% this
year. Security costs, meanwhile, are projected to nearly double to
$68 million this fiscal year, which began July 1, from $35 million
last year.</TE>
<TE>   If United announces additional cuts, LAX officials would do what
they did after Sept. 11--slash expenses and tap the agency's healthy
reserves, Sisson said. But that would not be easy because the airport
agency's $790-million budget for this fiscal year already is
incredibly tight, she added.</TE>
<TE>   Even with these worries, LAX is more fortunate than airports that
rely heavily on a single airline to generate traffic.</TE>
<TE>   "LAX is in an enviable position given its modest amount of debt,
diversity of carriers and high amount of origin and destination
traffic compared to other hub airports," said Dan Champeau, a
managing director at Fitch Ratings, which rates airports' ability to
service debt.</TE>
<TE>   LAX's $234 million of general revenue bond debt currently carries
an investment-grade rating of Aa3 by Moody's.</TE>
<TE>   A large number of travelers who pass through LAX are entering or
leaving the system, not catching other flights like passengers at
major connecting hubs such as Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.
This makes LAX less vulnerable to ups and downs in the airline
industry.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Southern California's regional airports said their
reliance on a number of airlines to provide service--10 carriers fly
out of John Wayne Airport and six use Burbank Airport--will help
shelter them from the airline industry's ongoing financial
difficulties.</TE>
<TE>   But hub airports that rely on one carrier for much of their
passenger traffic and revenue, such as San Francisco International
Airport, may need to issue more bonds to cover costs and are more
likely to pay higher interest rates and insurance premiums for this
debt.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's revised the outlook for SFO's bond debt to negative
following the terrorist attacks after United, which accounts for 47%
of the facility's passengers and 50% of its landing fees, cut its
schedule there. But the facility's new international terminal, which
opened in December 2000, should generate traffic and help SFO bounce
back, said airport spokeswoman Kandace Bender.</TE>
<TE>   Denver International Airport also is a major United hub--the
airline and its express partners account for 62% of the airport's
passengers. DIA officials recently conducted a "financial stress
test" to determine how DIA would weather a United bankruptcy. The
experiment assumed that the nation's second-largest carrier would cut
20% of its schedule at DIA.</TE>
<TE>   "The test found that revenue would be down," said Chuck Cannon, an
airport spokesman. "But not to the point where we couldn't meet our
obligations for operations and maintenance and the debt service on
almost $4 billion in bonds."</TE>
<TE>   But other United hubs, like Chicago's O'Hare, already are
suffering. United and American announced last month that they can no
longer afford to invest in a long-awaited $3.6-billion terminal
project there, forcing officials to postpone it.</TE>
<TE>   The two carriers, which control more than 85% of O'Hare's flights,
said they hoped to regain financial health by the time a separate
$6.6-billion plan to build two new runways and reconfigure others
gets underway.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at some major hubs are looking for an upside to the
airlines' financial problems. At Philadelphia International Airport,
where US Airways controls more than 65% of the gates, officials have
speculated that a move by the carrier to cut its schedule might allow
competitors to enter the market and lower prices.</TE>
<TE>   Passengers at Philadelphia paid fares that were 21% higher than
the national average in the third quarter of 2001, according to the
Transportation Department.</TE>
<TE>   Low-cost carriers may benefit from the industry turmoil by filling
abandoned slots at airports, analysts say. This is certainly true at
LAX, where Southwest Airlines has made it no secret that it needs
additional space to ease crowding in Terminal 1.</TE>
<TE>   Since the terrorist attacks, lines to board the discount carrier
often stretch to Terminal 2 and beyond. US Airways has 10 flights a
day out of Terminal 1. If the carrier cuts service, its gates surely
would be filled, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   This ever-present demand for air service historically has helped
airports survive the cyclical nature of the airline industry. For
example, Houston George Bush Intercontinental and Newark Liberty
International airports, longtime Continental hubs, are thriving,
about a decade after the carrier emerged from bankruptcy, said Kevin
Carney, vice president and senior credit officer at Moody's.</TE>
<TE>   "Since deregulation in 1978, over 125 airlines have filed for
bankruptcy, but we've never seen an airport bond default," said
Fitch's Champeau. "The overall demand for air travel has always been
there, and will continue to be there at some base level, no matter
which airlines are operating."</TE>

<HD>Bertelsmann May Shed Napster, Book Site</HD>
<DH>Media: The German group is seeking to scale back on
money-losing online ventures after CEO's ouster, sources say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MERISSA MARR</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>German media group Bertelsmann is looking to sell or shut its book
business Bol.com and pull the plug on music service Napster in a
clampdown on loss-making ventures, sources close to the company said
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Bertelsmann has held talks with online companies including
Seattle-based retailer Amazon.com Inc. about Bol.com as it seeks to
scale back online operations after the ouster of Chief Executive
Thomas Middelhoff, the sources said.</LD>
<LD>   Privately owned Bertelsmann's new CEO, Gunter Thielen, has been
reviewing the sprawling online businesses that were so heavily
championed by Middelhoff, in a bid to concentrate on profitable
operations.</LD>
<TE>   Bertelsmann's owners installed Thielen last month as they sought
to steer the group on a more conservative path after Middelhoff's
aggressive expansion aimed at propelling the group into the ranks of
global giants such as AOL Time Warner Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Sources familiar with the situation told Reuters in July that
Napster could be among the first casualties and Bol.com's future was
also hanging in the balance. Sources said on Sunday that Bertelsmann
was closing in on a decision on their future.</TE>
<TE>   "Bertelsmann is not happy with Bol.com, and I would expect some
kind of decision on its future soon," one source said. "Napster's
future is still also extremely uncertain."</TE>
<TE>   Bertelsmann's DirectGroup division, which houses the e-commerce
businesses, confirmed it was considering strategic options of
non-core operations but declined to comment specifically on Bol.com
or Napster.</TE>
<TE>   DirectGroup stomached some $125 million in Internet start-up
losses in the second half of last year. As losses continued, Thielen
replaced the head of the division, Klaus Eierhoff, with Bertelsmann's
former Chief Operating Officer Ewald Walgenbach.</TE>
<TE>   Other operations under Walgenbach's spotlight include online
bookseller Barnes&amp;Noble.com. The future of Bertelsmann's music
operation BeMusic also has come into question.</TE>
<TE>   It is not the first time Bol.com has come under review. Last year
Bertelsmann closed a number of its loss-making operations, but the
online book retailer still has struggled to make a mark.</TE>
<TE>   The writing also has been on the wall for Napster since
Middelhoff's sudden departure, sources said. The former CEO had been
one of the few supporters within Bertelsmann of the U.S. Web service
that once had 60 million followers.</TE>
<TE>   Middelhoff had wanted to relaunch Napster as a legitimate online
music subscription service and agreed to buy its assets out of
bankruptcy. However, the service has been embroiled in a legal battle
with the major music groups.</TE>
<TE>   Sources close to the firm said the timing of any shut-off of
funding to Napster would depend in part on U.S. judicial
developments.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in the Bertelsmann empire, the group also is looking to
sell its publishing arm BertelsmannSpringer and is in talks with
potential buyers, sources familiar with the situation say.</TE>
<TE>   Bertelsmann is expected to focus instead on core assets including
television, book publishing and music. The group owns pan-European
broadcaster RTL Group and the world's leading book publisher, Random
House.</TE>

<HD>Trial Over Rights to Herceptin Nears End</HD>
<DH>Drugs: Jury may get case this week. But Chiron- Genentech
patent fight could continue for years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two of the nation's largest biotechnology companies, Genentech Inc.
and Chiron Corp., are locked in a dispute over rights to one of
Genentech's most successful products, the breast cancer drug
Herceptin.</LD>
<LD>   Chiron is suing Genentech in federal court, claiming it holds a
critical patent on the technology behind Herceptin. The stakes are
huge. Chiron is asking for as much as 30% of Herceptin sales until
its patent expires in 2005. That could total more than $300 million.</LD>
<LD>   The trial, which began Aug. 6 in Sacramento, is expected to go to
the 10-member jury this week. If the jury finds that South San
Francisco-based Genentech willfully violated Emeryville, Calif.-based
Chiron's patent, it can triple damages.</LD>
<TE>   The case underscores the importance of patents in the
biotechnology industry. San Diego patent lawyer James McClain said
biotech companies often depend on one or two drugs that take many
years and millions of dollars to develop. Patents give biotech
companies a monopoly that protects such enormous investments.</TE>
<TE>   Given the stakes, companies often choose to battle in court rather
than agree to share intellectual property rights, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "No side can afford to lose valuable rights to an invention,"
McClain said.</TE>
<TE>   For Genentech, the suit is the second in as many months to
question the company's business tactics.</TE>
<TE>   Genentech is appealing a $500-million judgment against it by a
jury that found it cheated City of Hope National Medical Center in
Duarte out of royalties. That verdict was reached in June.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute between Genentech and Chiron is rooted in a scientific
race during the 1980s to discover the molecular cause of breast
cancer. In 1984, David B. Ring and Arthur F. Frankel, then scientists
at Cetus Corp., developed a mouse antibody that targeted a protein
associated with human breast cancer. Chiron acquired Cetus in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Chiron did not develop a drug based on the development. But it
diligently pursued a patent for it. The patent was issued in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge William B. Shubb ruled in pretrial proceedings
that Genentech infringed Chiron's patent. Jurors must decide whether
Chiron's patent is valid.</TE>
<TE>   Genentech claims that the Chiron patent is invalid because the
discovery it covers is not useful or well described, two important
tests. Chiron's mouse antibody, if used in people, would be destroyed
by the immune system as a foreign invader before it could attack
cancer cells, Genentech said.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, Genentech said Cetus' 1984 patent application does
not identify the human breast cancer protein as Her-2. Chiron amended
its application to mention the term Her-2 in 1995, the same year
Genentech scientists described Her-2 in a paper published in Science.</TE>
<TE>   Genentech said Herceptin, an antibody that is part human, part
mouse, was invented by Genentech scientist Axel Ullrich and UCLA
scientist Dennis Slamon. It works by blocking a protein found in 30%
of breast cancers. Hailed as a breakthrough while still in
development, it galvanized an activist movement of breast cancer
patients demanding access to the experimental drug. Herceptin
launched in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Genentech spokeswoman Sabrina Johnson said Genentech did not draw
on work by Chiron.</TE>
<TE>   "We developed a cancer-fighting treatment entirely independently
of what they did," she said. "We think Chiron's claims are a bit
questionable."</TE>
<TE>   But Chiron attorney Nancy Koch said it was no secret that
scientists from Cetus were working on a breast cancer antibody. The
Cetus scientists published some of their findings, making them
available to others.</TE>
<TE>   Chiron said Genentech improved the Chiron antibody but did not
invent it any more than improvements in telecommunications dislodge
Alexander Graham Bell as the inventor of the telephone.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is that without our invention, their drug does
not work," Koch said.</TE>
<TE>   Any verdict is likely to face an appeal that will drag the dispute
on for years. And Chiron has filed a second Herceptin suit against
Genentech involving another patent. That case should go to trial next
year.</TE>
<TE>   The Patent and Trademark Office, meanwhile, is reviewing a
challenge to Chiron's patent from Genentech.</TE>
<TE>   Genentech told the patent office that two scientists from the
University of Pennsylvania, Jeffrey A. Drebin and Mark Greene,
discovered the breast cancer antibody before Ring and Frankel. The
university filed a patent application in the research in 1985, but no
patent was issued.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge, known as an interference proceeding, could take
several years to resolve, and there is no way to predict the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   However, a judge in the federal patent suit ruled that the
Drebin-Greene intellectual property was not relevant because it dealt
specifically with rat antibodies and rat breast cancer tumors.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Gregory G. Hollows, in a written decision, noted Genentech
paid the University of Pennsylvania millions for intellectual
property rights two years after Herceptin launched. He suggested that
the deal was little more than a legal maneuver.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless Genentech is now in the business of saving our rodent
cousins from breast cancer," he wrote, one can infer that Genentech
licensed the university's intellectual property to "attack with
impunity Chiron's patents."</TE>

<HD>Germans Mull Over Anti-Fraud Measures</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Steps that may be proposed would check the
accuracy of financial statements.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>The German government is weighing measures to give financial services
regulators more powers to combat accounting fraud, a Finance Ministry
spokeswoman said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The moves are designed to prevent scandals such as those involving
WorldCom Inc. and other U.S. corporate giants.</LD>
<LD>   Finance Minister Hans Eichel will announce a range of possible
measures to shore up investor confidence in a speech to the Frankfurt
Stock Exchange on Tuesday, ministry spokeswoman Elke Pedack said,
confirming a report in the Der Spiegel news weekly.</LD>
<TE>   The proposals would give the Federal Institute for Federal
Services Supervision a key role in checking on the accuracy of
companies' financial statements, she said. She gave no other details.</TE>
<TE>   According to Der Spiegel, the institute is to be upgraded into a
German version of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which
watches over Wall Street firms.</TE>
<TE>   Eichel's plans would give regulators the power to send auditors to
sift through the accounts of companies suspected of making inaccurate
financial statements, the magazine wrote in an article to be
published today.</TE>
<TE>   Firms also could be ordered to ditch external auditors not seen as
independent, the magazine said.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. government responded to the accounting scandals at
telecommunications firm WorldCom and energy trader Enron Corp. with
tighter regulations that oblige top executives of companies listed on
the stock markets to vouch for the accuracy of their firms' accounts.
Offenders could face up to 20 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC last week rejected an appeal from German firms listed on
the New York Stock Exchange for an exemption from that requirement.</TE>
<TE>   German officials and the European Commission argue that the U.S.
has no right to impose the rules on foreign companies. German firms
say the regulations also could create legal conflicts.</TE>

<HD>Cadbury, Nestle May Try to Divide Hershey</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Britain's Cadbury Schweppes was reported to have held talks with
Nestle about teaming up in a bid for Hershey Foods Corp., but sources
close to the matter on Sunday downplayed talk of a joint bid.</LD>
<LD>   Both the Business newspaper and the Mail on Sunday said Cadbury
and Nestle have discussed plans to link up and divide Hershey's
assets between them.</LD>
<LD>   Cadbury declined to comment on the reports. Sources close to the
situation said that though the existing relationships between Cadbury
and Hershey meant there probably would be talks between the British
firm and Nestle, it was unlikely the two were close to making any
deals.</LD>
<TE>   The Business newspaper said the talks centered on Nestle acquiring
most of Hershey, with the British confectionery and drinks group
picking up its own brands that are licensed to Hershey in North
America.</TE>
<TE>   However, one source close to the firm pointed out that Cadbury
believes that the rights to its brands revert to it if Hershey is
sold, so there is no need for the company to cut a separate deal to
get them.</TE>
<TE>   "Cadbury would get its own brands back automatically if there is a
change of control" at Hershey, the source said.</TE>
<TE>   The situation is similar to that of Nestle, which says the U.S.
rights to its KitKat brand revert to it if Hershey is sold.</TE>
<TE>   Banking sources told Reuters that Cadbury had retained investment
bank Goldman Sachs to advise it in respect to the Hershey sale.</TE>
<TE>   However, sources close to the company said it was never Cadbury's
intention to take part in competitive bidding for the whole of
Hershey, but rather to pick up the pieces that Nestle might have to
divest in order to get regulatory approval for a takeover of Hershey.</TE>
<TE>   Switzerland-based Nestle spent last week playing down speculation
it could overpay for Hershey. On Friday, Chief Executive Peter
Brabeck rejected reports he would pay $12 billion for the American
chocolate icon.</TE>
<TE>   Brabeck also highlighted potential regulatory hurdles in the event
of any takeover of Hershey as a combined Nestle-Hershey business that
would hold more than half of the U.S. chocolate confectionery market.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Exec at Enron Amassed Wealth in Virtual Obscurity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN K. STACK and NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>He stays inside these days, deep within the great postmodern box of a
mansion he built when the millions were still rolling in. Those days
are over--now a uniformed guard paces the smooth driveway and
photographers gawk from the sidewalk, eager for a glimpse of his thin
frame.</LD>
<LD>   Michael J. Kopper has reinvented himself more than once. College
classmates remember him as a middle-class kid from New York's Long
Island with a Gatsby-esque hunger for opulence. He studied and
eventually became an ambitious banker. He came to Houston seeking the
fast riches promised by Texas lore and got what he was after in the
elite ranks of Enron Corp.</LD>
<LD>   As an executive at the energy giant, Kopper staked out a
profitable piece of middle ground: He was important enough to get in
on the deals and low-profile enough to slip unnoticed through the
labyrinthine passages of complicated financial manipulations. He was
loyal, he kept his mouth shut, and he made a fortune.</LD>
<TE>   Kopper's most recent metamorphosis came this month, when he
strolled into a federal courtroom and pleaded guilty to money
laundering and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. In a bid for a
lighter sentence, Kopper agreed to turn over $12 million in
ill-gotten riches and give federal prosecutors the information they
need to go after Enron's top executives.</TE>
<TE>   The plea bargain casts a formerly anonymous executive as one of
the most crucial figures in Enron's spectacular swan dive, one who is
expected to play a major role as the investigation moves forward and
in any eventual trials.</TE>
<TE>   The morning he entered his plea, a somber Kopper told the judge he
has sought treatment for stress and anxiety. Around here, he's
unlikely to garner much sympathy. Kopper has pointed fingers at his
friends, his co-workers and Andrew S. Fastow, the boss who made him
rich. Moreover, he has confessed to helping himself to millions of
dollars he didn't earn.</TE>
<TE>   "If I saw him outside the house," huffed a neighbor who asked not
to be identified, "I'd roll down my window and say, 'Hey, some of us
work for a living.' "</TE>
<TE>   Kopper grew up in Woodmere, N.Y., and studied economics at
Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pa., before transferring to Duke
University. The young Kopper was embarrassed by his middle-class
roots, said Susan Hoke, a classmate from Muhlenberg. When she visited
his family's Long Island home, he took her on a sightseeing tour of
wealthier parts of town.</TE>
<TE>   "He would say, 'This is where I want to live someday.' He thought
he was poor," Hoke told the Morning Call in Allentown. "He was always
very motivated by money, always kind of knew how to get ahead without
doing a lot of work."</TE>
<TE>   After Duke, Kopper crossed the Atlantic to earn a graduate degree
from the London School of Economics. He came home to New York and
started his career working for a Canadian-based bank. In 1994, he
moved to Houston to work for Enron's finance division.</TE>
<TE>   At Enron, Kopper appears to have been neither well known nor well
liked. A few former co-workers said he was brilliant, articulate and
arrogant, but most never heard of him until the troubles began.</TE>
<TE>   A lawyer for Kenneth L. Lay, who as chairman and chief executive
was the company's guiding spirit, says Lay never clapped eyes on
Kopper until the pair appeared before Congress in February.</TE>
<TE>   "He wasn't one of these people that everybody in the building
knew," a former Enron employee said. "I don't even remember seeing
him in the elevator. The people making deals were off on their own."</TE>
<TE>   It was the complex financial webs he spun with Fastow, Enron's
chief financial officer, that fueled Kopper's exuberant rise to
riches--and that could still land him in prison when he is sentenced
in April.</TE>
<TE>   At first blush, Kopper and Fastow have little in common. But to
hear Kopper tell it, they were bound by a sacred mutual interest:
money.</TE>
<TE>   Federal investigators allege that Fastow masterminded a series of
schemes to make fortunes from Enron's outside partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   Enron used the partnerships to keep debt off its books. Companies
do not have to report a partnership's assets or debts on their
balance sheets as long as at least 3% of each partnership is owned by
outside investors.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, authorities allege, Fastow began taking the equity share
reserved for outside investors for himself--loaning money to Kopper
and other friends, who invested in the partnerships and paid
kickbacks to Fastow.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow has denied wrongdoing through his attorney, but Kopper
admitted in his plea agreement that he reaped millions in investment
gains and management fees while hiding Fastow's conflicting roles.
Kopper admitted scouting investors for his boss and ferrying money
between Fastow and would-be investors.</TE>
<TE>   The partnerships made Kopper and Fastow rich, and they took their
families, friends and colleagues along for the ride, according to
documents filed with Kopper's plea deal.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of a partnership called Chewco, for example, Kopper
and his domestic partner, William Dodson, invested $125,000 and
reaped a return of $10.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Kopper also invested in RADR, an off-the-books deal created to
hide the sale of California wind farms, federal investigators allege.
It was an effective foil--hoodwinked regulators continued to send
Enron big payments for which the company no longer qualified.</TE>
<TE>   Another partnership, Southampton, appears to have been created
primarily as a vehicle to enrich Kopper and Fastow, as well as their
families, friends and colleagues, according to court filings.
Southampton was named after the neighborhood Fastow and Kopper called
home at the time of its creation.</TE>
<TE>   The money appears to have helped finance a lavish lifestyle for
Kopper and Dodson, a former executive at Continental Airlines Inc.
The couple kept a stable of four BMWs. They gave thousands to gay and
lesbian causes and put in appearances at high-dollar fund-raising
dinners and cocktail parties. They contributed generously to overcome
conservative opposition to granting insurance benefits to same-sex
partners of Houston city employees. They donated to advocacy group
Human Rights Campaign. They also gave $1,000 each to President Bush's
1999 campaign.</TE>
<TE>   They lived first in Southampton, a densely wooded historic enclave
near Houston's Museum District. As the couple's wealth grew, they
sold their starter place to Joan and Carl Fastow. Andrew Fastow
loaned his parents $850,000 to buy the home.</TE>
<TE>   When it came time to build a home befitting their swelling
bankrolls, Kopper and Dodson bought a corner lot in one of Houston's
wealthiest ZIP Codes, razed the old house and set about erecting a
building unlike any other on this strip of colonials. The result is a
looming chunk of marble and stucco--all squares and clean angles,
fringed with bamboo, with a swimming pool, glass staircase and
$1.4-million price tag.</TE>
<TE>   The house was still under construction when curious neighbors
invited the pair to the annual block party.</TE>
<TE>   Kopper and Dodson skipped the party but telephoned from England to
thank the new neighbors for the invitation--a gesture deemed classy
by residents of Ella Lee Lane, a street heavy with the sort of
claustrophobic opulence created when sprawling homes are planted on
snug urban lots.</TE>
<TE>   By last year, the couple had moved into their designer home. But
they never really got a chance to know their neighbors. By the time
this spring's block party rolled around, Kopper and Dodson had been
driven underground by scandal.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel sorry for them. They just keep to themselves," neighbor
Cathy Oliver said. She's never laid eyes on Kopper, she said, and
caught a glance of Dodson just once, when he opened the door for a
pizza delivery.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they're basically in prison in that house."</TE>

<HD>Growth Funds Try to Mount Comeback</HD>
<DH>Stocks: Heavy tech holdings hammered large-cap category.
Many managers now stress diversity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the height of the bull market, mutual funds that focus on
large-capitalization growth stocks were the center of the fund
universe, the "must own" category for millions of Americans.</LD>
<LD>   Many investors still own one or more of these funds. But the
severe losses the category has suffered over the last 2 1/2 years
have a lot of people questioning what went wrong--and whether they
should stay put.</LD>
<LD>   In the late 1990s, large-cap growth meant the biggest companies in
the fastest-growing, most exciting industries. And nothing was more
exciting to Wall Street in that period than technology.</LD>
<TE>   As large-cap growth fund managers loaded up with tech shares, the
average total return on the funds topped 25% in 1997, 1998 and 1999.</TE>
<TE>   But since the tech stock bubble burst in March 2000, losses for
the average large-cap growth fund have piled up at a 26.6% annualized
rate, according to data tracker Morningstar Inc. That is far worse
than the 16.6% annualized loss rate in that period for the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 index, the principal benchmark of the biggest U.S. stocks.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the most popular large-cap growth funds at the market
peak in March 2000 have been among the worst performers on the way
down: 11 of the 15 biggest funds, by assets, at the market peak have
lost more than the category average since then, Morningstar data
show.</TE>
<TE>   The annualized loss rate of the Janus Fund, for example, was 28.4%
between March 31, 2000, and Aug. 23. The fund's assets have slumped
from $49.1 billion at the peak to $17.2 billion now.</TE>
<TE>   Fidelity Aggressive Growth, the ninth-biggest large-cap growth
fund in March 2000, has lost an annualized 48.6% since then,
according to Morningstar. The Putnam New Opportunities fund's loss
rate has been an annualized 36.9%.</TE>
<TE>   In part, large-cap growth funds were victims of their own success.
As money poured in from investors dazzled by the sector's high
returns, the funds bid up prices of big-name growth stocks that
already were arguably inflated.</TE>
<TE>   "Large-cap growth got so big that the funds almost had to be in
the most liquid stocks," said Jonas Max Ferris, editor of the Web
site Maxfunds.com, which covers the fund industry.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately for the funds and their shareholders, the most
liquid stocks of the era included not only technology titans such as
Cisco Systems Inc. and Intel Corp., but also such subsequently
scandal-tainted names as Enron Corp., WorldCom Inc. and Tyco
International Ltd.</TE>
<TE>   Too Much for Too Long</TE>
<TE>   Though fund-industry analysts say large-cap growth managers can't
be blamed for their style of investing being out of favor since March
2000--since all investing styles have up and down cycles--it's clear
that many funds remained too concentrated in technology and telecom
stocks for too long, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   "You wonder how hard these funds were even looking at what they
were buying," Ferris said.</TE>
<TE>   The Denver-based Janus funds became closely associated with tech
shares during the market boom, and paid the price when the sector
busted.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the Janus funds took on a substantial amount of risk to
earn such high returns in 1998 and '99, and the managers were not
quick on the trigger in taking gains and selling out," said Brian
Portnoy, a Morningstar analyst who covers Janus.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Steve Oristaglio, deputy head of investments at
Boston-based Putnam Investments, said growth-stock funds at his firm
became "highly focused on tech and telecom. We believed the build-out
was going to be faster than what has transpired, and we thought the
economy would be stronger."</TE>
<TE>   Scott Schoelzel, who manages the Janus Twenty fund, acknowledged
that tech stakes hurt many of his firm's growth funds, but he said
it's easy to second-guess managers after the fact.</TE>
<TE>   "With the benefit of 20/20 hindsight today, it's true that Janus
and its shareholders would have benefited from diversification away
from tech and telecom earlier in the cycle," he said. "We, like most
other fund families, would still be down but it may have mitigated
some of the downturn."</TE>
<TE>   Some large-cap growth funds that took a more sober view of the
valuations on tech stocks and other large-cap leaders in the late
1990s have recorded relatively modest losses since the market peak.</TE>
<TE>   The American Funds group's Growth Fund of America has lost 16.7%,
annualized, since March 2000, according to Morningstar.</TE>
<TE>   Individual investors who poured billions of dollars into large-cap
growth funds in the late 1990s and much of 2000 bear part of the
responsibility for what followed, said Phil Edwards, head of fund
analysis at Standard &amp; Poor's in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "People had a short-term perspective, thinking the bull market
would go on forever," Edwards said. "A lot of people didn't really
realize what they were buying. They were just chasing performance,"
in turn pumping more air into the growth-stock bubble.</TE>
<TE>   Investors plowed $224 billion into large-cap growth funds during
1999 and 2000, awarding the category 62% of total net stock fund
inflows in that period, according to data tracker Financial Research
Corp.</TE>
<TE>   In the last year and a half, by contrast, investors have redeemed
more from the funds than they've added.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking for Recovery</TE>
<TE>   How soon might large-cap growth funds stage a significant
recovery?</TE>
<TE>   Two factors will determine performance, analysts note: First is
the broad issue of whether the next market advance will be led by
big-name stocks (as opposed, say, to smaller stocks).</TE>
<TE>   Second is the issue of industry sector leadership within large-cap
growth, and how well portfolio managers pick winners and avoid
laggards and losers.</TE>
<TE>   The list of large-cap growth funds' favorite stocks already has
been altered dramatically compared with the favorites of March 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Technology stocks comprised 15 of the 25 largest holdings of
large-cap growth funds in March 2000, according to Morningstar.</TE>
<TE>   Now, there are just six tech stocks on the top-25 list: Microsoft
Corp., Intel, Cisco, AOL Time Warner Inc., Dell Computer Corp. and
Applied Materials Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Though tech may still be the single biggest sector weighting for
many large-cap growth funds, managers have better diversified their
portfolios, boosting their holdings of big-name stocks in such
industries as health care, financial services, retail and consumer
products.</TE>
<TE>   At Putnam, Oristaglio said the funds' managers in the late 1990s
"had been focused too much on momentum factors and not enough on
valuations. It's a flaw we feel we've corrected."</TE>
<TE>   In June, Putnam hired Brian O'Toole from Citigroup Asset
Management as its new chief of large-cap growth investing. O'Toole's
team oversees the firm's Voyager, Growth Opportunities and New
Opportunities funds.</TE>
<TE>   O'Toole said he is emphasizing companies with steady earnings
growth--the hallmark of growth companies--but is more careful about
focusing on the true bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   "Investors found out that, yes, earnings count. It's not just cash
flow," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Putnam also is emphasizing actual or "reported" earnings when
evaluating companies and stocks, rather than "operating" earnings,
which are results excluding so-called one-time charges, O'Toole said.</TE>
<TE>   Reported earnings are less susceptible to manipulation, he said.</TE>
<TE>   O'Toole said Microsoft, retailer Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc. and
financial services firm Northern Trust Co. exemplify the type of
companies he likes. He believes that his criteria would have kept
stocks such as Lucent Technologies Inc. and Tyco out of the
portfolios before the shares got clocked.</TE>
<TE>   At Janus, fund managers see better growth opportunities in
health-care and insurance stocks such as Tenet Healthcare Corp.,
American International Group Inc. and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. All
three are among Janus' leading holdings firm-wide as of its latest
portfolio reports.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Solid Stock Pickers</TE>
<TE>   For large-cap growth fund investors who are trying to decide
whether to stick with a fund that has performed worse than the
category average since the market peak, analysts suggest looking at
what's in the portfolio now, and at the manager's longer-term record.</TE>
<TE>   Alfred Harrison, who has drawn investor ire for betting on Enron
and Tyco in his Alliance Premier Growth fund, is one manager who
deserves investors' faith, S&amp;P's Edwards said.</TE>
<TE>   "[Harrison] is a great manager with a good long-term record. He
had a bad year but that doesn't mean he had a frontal lobotomy,"
Edwards said.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts also say that Fidelity OTC fund manager Jason Weiner
and Fidelity Growth Company fund manager Steven Wymer also are solid
stock pickers who should be given the benefit of the doubt, despite
their funds' recent results.</TE>
<TE>   Van Kampen Emerging Growth fund, whose assets swelled to about $19
billion in spring 2000, probably got more "hot money" than manager
Gary Lewis could deftly handle, said Morningstar analyst Robert Gynn.</TE>
<TE>   Gynn said Lewis has had 13 years at the helm--most of them
successful--and he said the fund is more nimble now at around $7
billion in assets. Despite the losses since March 2000, Lewis'
10-year record is near the top of the large-growth-fund class,
according to Morningstar.</TE>
<TE>   Still, analysts say the urge to bolt a cold fund is
understandable.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of Vanguard U.S. Growth, which replaced longtime
advisor Lincoln Capital with a team from Alliance Capital in June
2001, shareholders are in a tough spot, said Morningstar analyst
Christopher Traulsen.</TE>
<TE>   "They endured a couple of brutal years of losses that were not
Alliance's fault, and now this must feel like salt in the wounds," he
said, noting that the fund is down 31.5% year to date. "But it's far
too early to pass judgment on Alliance," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Vanguard spokesman Brian Mattes said the fund's new advisors
deserve at least three years before their performance can be judged
fairly.</TE>
<TE>   In general, investors may regret giving up on large-cap growth
funds at this point, some analysts say. The risk is that investors
could be selling low after buying high if they came into the funds in
1998 or 1999.</TE>
<TE>   With the funds' more diversified portfolios, investors in
large-cap growth now own a broader swath of the nation's most
successful companies, experts note.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Time to Get Out?</TE>
<TE>   However, in cases where fund losses can be pinned squarely on poor
stock picking in recent years, some analysts say there's reason for
investors to consider jumping ship.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Bertelson, manager of Fidelity Aggressive Growth, has been
"a consistent underperformer" since taking over in early 2000,
according to Jim Lowell, editor of the independent Fidelity Investor
newsletter in Needham, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   Although Fidelity measures the fund against mid-cap stock indexes,
its assets ballooned under previous manager Erin Sullivan, and
Morningstar labels it large-cap growth.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of the benchmark used, Bertelson has sustained deep
losses each year at the helm.</TE>
<TE>   Fidelity takes exception to the criticism Bertelson is getting.</TE>
<TE>   "He took over this fund at the exact moment the market went into
an unprecedented decline, and for 2 1/2 years he has faced tremendous
challenges," said Fidelity spokeswoman Anne Crowley in Boston. "It's
a very aggressive fund, by its own mandate, in a very conservative
market."</TE>
<TE>   As for Janus funds, Morningstar's Portnoy said the structure of
Janus Twenty, which typically holds just 20 to 25 stocks, might make
it tricky for manager Scott Schoelzel to steer a comeback. For
instance, Portnoy said, selling large chunks of stock without
depressing the market price is an "art form."</TE>
<TE>   But Portnoy said he would stick with the flagship Janus Fund,
whose manager Blaine Rollins has done well over the longer term.</TE>
<TE>   Schoelzel said he doesn't think the Janus Twenty fund's focused
style will impair its performance, and he noted that the fund ranks
in the top third of the Morningstar large-cap growth category year to
date (the fund is down 21.2%).</TE>
<TE>   One analyst said he is skeptical about active management overall
when it comes to large-cap growth funds.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really a question of whether any manager can consistently
outperform the large-cap indexes, which are made up of stocks that
are so heavily covered on Wall Street," said Daniel Wiener, editor of
the Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors newsletter in Potomac,
Md.</TE>
<TE>   Wiener said he opts for the Vanguard Growth Index fund, which
tracks the growth segment of the S&amp;P 500--and has beaten
three-fourths of its category peers over the last five years.</TE>

<HD>Enron Was a Drag on Janus</HD>
<DH>Investing: Ill-fated energy trader was a key holding of
several of the mutual giant's funds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Technology stocks have been the main drag on large-cap growth funds
over the last two years, but Enron Corp. also helped weigh the funds
down: Enron was the 25th-largest holding of large-cap growth funds
overall as of March 31, 2000, according to Morningstar Inc.</LD>
<LD>   At year-end 2000, as the energy trader's shares were peaking,
Enron was a key holding of several Janus funds. The stock was listed
among the top 10 holdings of the flagship Janus Fund, Janus Mercury
and Janus Growth and Income.</LD>
<LD>   Some fund-industry analysts say portfolio managers should have
been more dubious of highflying Enron well before its December 2001
bankruptcy, even if they could not have detected alleged accounting
fraud at the company.</LD>
<TE>   Janus, in particular, "knew the [Enron] upper management very well
and trusted it enough to become the largest shareholder," said Brian
Portnoy, a Morningstar analyst who covers the Janus fund family.</TE>
<TE>   "Plenty of other fund shops never liked the smell of Enron,"
Portnoy said. "It's one thing to invest and another thing to back up
the truck. The experience sullies Janus' reputation at the end of the
day as a research shop."</TE>
<TE>   On its Web site, Janus acknowledges it could have asked more
questions about Enron.</TE>
<TE>   "We should have probed more deeply into the reasons behind CEO
Jeff Skilling's unexpected departure," the firm said, although some
Janus managers did dump the stock when Skilling left abruptly in
August 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "Our biggest mistake, however, was in not pressing management
harder about Enron's complex and obscure accounting methods," Janus
said. "On several occasions, these methods were discussed during our
meetings with Enron, and we were assured they were legitimate."</TE>

<HD>Dockworkers Walk Out of Contract Talks</HD>
<DH>Ports: West Coast shipping lines prepare for immediate
slowdowns as labor agreement expires.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Union negotiators for West Coast dockworkers walked out of contract
talks with major shipping lines Sunday, opening the door to a work
slowdown at ports from Long Beach to Seattle as early as Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   After extending it for two months, the union allowed the labor
contract covering 10,500 members to expire at 5 p.m. Sunday, setting
the stage for job actions.</LD>
<LD>   "It means we are not bound by any agreement and we can
legitimately take job actions any time we feel like it," said Steve
Stallone, chief spokesman for the International Longshore and
Warehouse Union. A full strike is at least two weeks away, however,
because union rules call for balloting by mail.</LD>
<TE>   Stallone said union officials would make no decisions until
Tuesday, when negotiators return from Labor Day rallies planned along
the coast.</TE>
<TE>   The employers group is bracing for immediate slowdowns at the 29
ports along the coast, according to a statement from the Pacific
Maritime Assn., which is negotiating for the union carriers.</TE>
<TE>   It said that similar slowdowns were staged during the last round
of negotiations five years ago but that the stakes are higher now
because of enormous growth in foreign trade.</TE>
<TE>   Before talks began in May, PMA President Joseph Miniace warned
that employers would lock out union workers if they attempted to slow
down the movement of goods.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday he laid the blame for any future disruptions at the
union's feet.</TE>
<TE>   "The union just fired the first shot," Miniace said.</TE>
<TE>   "They opened the door to work slowdowns, which we have said time
and again will not be tolerated."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has indicated that it would invoke the
Taft-Hartley Act to force union members back to work for 80 days in
the event of a strike.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, each side blamed the other for the breakdown in
negotiations in San Francisco, which came after several days of
promising discussions on health benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Stallone said negotiators planned to sign a tentative agreement on
benefits Sunday morning but balked when employers wanted to change
the language on arbitration.</TE>
<TE>   The employers group, however, said talks disintegrated when the
union refused to compromise on the introduction of labor-saving
technology.</TE>
<TE>   The union is at odds with shippers over the introduction of new
technology, which operators say will boost profitability and
competitiveness but which ILWU officials claim is a pretext for
outsourcing union jobs to lower-paid contractors.</TE>
<TE>   ILWU members are among the highest-paid union workers in the
nation.</TE>
<TE>   The talks have been seen as crucial because the ports involved,
including Long Beach and Los Angeles, represent some $300 billion in
U.S. trade annually.</TE>
<TE>   Last month the White House said it would consider intervening to
prevent a strike. Such a suggestion angered union officials, who
accused the Bush administration of siding with port employers and
undermining the ILWU's bargaining position.</TE>
<TE>   Union workers authorized their negotiating committee last month to
call a strike vote for ports.</TE>

<HD>Oil Prices May Jump Unless Production Rises</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Crude oil prices will jump in the last quarter of the year, crimping
a recovery in the world economy, unless OPEC agrees to increase
production, oil traders and analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   Oil inventories in the United States, the top energy consumer, are
1.5% below year-ago levels as the fourth-quarter peak in demand
nears. Brent crude oil has risen 38% to $27.47 a barrel this year,
buoyed by OPEC supply curbs and concern that supply may be disrupted
should the U.S. attack Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   "The market is slowly tightening up," said Leo Drollas, deputy
director of the Centre for Global Energy Studies, which was founded
by former Saudi oil minister Sheikh Zaki Yamani. "With no change in
output, we are looking at an average of more than $29 a barrel in the
fourth quarter."</LD>
<TE>   The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets Sept.
19 to consider its first output increase for two years. OPEC has cut
its official output to the lowest since 1991 to bolster prices and
respond to slowing demand.</TE>
<TE>   OPEC Secretary General Alvaro Silva, in Johannesburg for the Earth
Summit on sustainable development, on Friday said the group will
"maintain stability" in oil markets, seeking to dispel concern of a
shortage should the U.S. attack Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   OPEC's oil price recently fetched $26.53 a barrel, within the
group's target range of $22 to $28 and more than an average since
1997 of about $20.40. Oil provides as much as 95% of OPEC members'
foreign exchange earnings.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Energy Department, in its most recent outlook, said OPEC
needs to pump more this year to prevent its oil price from surging
above $28, equating to at least $30 a barrel in New York.</TE>

<HD>Wall Street's Eyes on New Economic Data</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters, Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. markets are closed for the Labor Day holiday today. When trading
resumes Tuesday, Wall Street will be watching the week's data on the
manufacturing sector, car and truck sales, and employment, which are
expected to show the economy avoided a contraction in August.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, investors and others will get a reading on the state
of U.S. manufacturing, which makes up one-sixth of the economy, when
the Institute for Supply Management releases its monthly
manufacturing index.</LD>
<LD>   In July the index fell to 50.5, its lowest level since January.
Analysts expect the index to come in at 51.6 for August.</LD>
<TE>   Wednesday, August car sales and truck sales roll in. The figures
provide a gauge of consumer spending.</TE>
<TE>   Economists watch consumer spending closely because it makes up
two-thirds of economic activity. In recent months, consumers have
continued to spend freely, with robust July auto sales and new-home
sales hitting a record.</TE>
<TE>   August unemployment figures will be released Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "The health of the labor market is critical input into the whole
issue of consumer spending," said Bruce Simon, chief investment
officer of Glenmede Trust Co., which manages $14 billion in assets.
"That is one of the key factors in support of the modest rebound
we're experiencing."</TE>
<TE>   For August, economists are expecting the unemployment rate to be
unchanged from the 5.9% level set in July and expect 37,000 jobs to
be created.</TE>
<TE>   There are some indications that business spending on equipment and
software has stopped declining. A Commerce Department report Thursday
on July factory orders probably will show a 4.7% rise.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vodafone Group may make an unsolicited cash offer for SFR, the French
mobile phone company controlled by Vivendi Universal, by the end of
the month, the Financial Times reported, without citing anyone.</LD>
<LD>   The offer may be about $12.4 billion, the paper cited unidentified
analysts as saying. Vodafone would probably use a $10.65-billion
unused bank facility to fund the purchase, the paper said.</LD>
<LD>   Vodafone, which last week agreed to buy Vivendi's stake in Vizzavi
for $140.1 million in cash, wants to gain control of SFR because
France is the only big European market where it does not have a
controlling stake in its mobile operations, the paper said.</LD>

more than $50 billion, put a dozen remaining businesses, including
Portland General Electric and the Transwestern Pipeline Co., up for

<KH>EXECUTIVE ROUNDTABLE</KH>
<HD>Narrowing Criteria Will Simplify Hunt for Acquisitions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Executive Roundtable is a column by TEC International, an
organization of more than 7,000 business owners, company presidents
and chief executives. TEC members meet in small peer groups to share
their business experiences and help one another solve problems in a
round-table session. The following question and answer summarize a
discussion at a recent TEC meeting in Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   Question: We recently decided on acquisition as a long-term growth
strategy. We have a general idea of the kind of company we'd like to
acquire, but we're not sure whom to approach or how to approach them.
What do you recommend?</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Answer: Before worrying about where to look or how to approach
them, first get clear on what you're looking for. Acquisitions
involve complex, time-consuming deals. If you go chasing deals
without any parameters to limit the scope of your search, you're
likely to grab at the first opportunity that comes down the pike. In
doing so, you greatly increase your chances of making a deal that's
bad for you and your business.</TE>
<TE>   Terry Gambill, president of the mergers-and-acquisitions
consulting firm Terry Gambill and Associates in Geneva, Ohio, has
acquired more than 20 companies and product lines. He recommends
developing a one-page "acquisition criteria sheet" to guide your
search for acquisition candidates. Start by identifying who you are
as a business, what you do and where you do it. Then list your
company's core competencies, the things you do that give you a
distinct advantage over your competitors. Finally, describe how your
company is financed and how you intend to fund the acquisition.</TE>
<TE>   Next, list in bullet-point fashion the primary characteristics of
the company you're looking for. This should include the type and size
of business, where it could (or should) be located, whether you want
to buy part or all of the business and whether you want to acquire
people, places or things or stand-alone business units. If you can't
fit this information on one sheet of paper, you haven't clearly
defined your acquisition criteria. Sharpen your pencil and try again.</TE>
<TE>   When creating the sheet, make your criteria narrow enough to keep
you away from diversionary acquisitions but not so conservative in
size and scope that you eliminate all candidates. Also, don't
underestimate the size of the company you think you can acquire. It
takes the same amount of management time and professional fees to do
a $10-million deal as a $1-million deal.</TE>
<TE>   Why go to all this trouble? Because a well-crafted acquisition
criteria sheet keeps you focused on the right candidates. It lets
your management team know exactly what you're looking for (so they
don't bring you inappropriate opportunities) and helps you approach
potential sellers by showing why you have an interest in their
particular business.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most important, it keeps you from chasing after deals that
never should have come to you in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you go into acquisition mode, all kinds of opportunities
will suddenly present themselves," Gambill explains, "and you can't
afford to waste time looking into every potential deal that comes
your way. The one-page criteria sheet serves as an effective first
screen. When something lands on your desk, simply pull out your sheet
and run down the list. Within 30 seconds you can tell whether the
opportunity might be worth pursuing."</TE>
<TE>   Once you have clear, concise acquisition criteria, you can turn
your attention to finding potential candidates. At this stage, keep
your eyes and ears open because acquisition candidates can turn up in
many different places. Start by going up or down the vertical
integration chain in an industry that interests you.</TE>
<TE>   For example, if you want to buy retail lumberyards, develop a
relationship with a lumber wholesaler. The wholesaler can tell you
about the company where the partners are looking to retire or the
struggling firm that just laid off 20% of its work force.</TE>
<TE>   Customers or distributors often can point you in the right
direction. Ask them, "What other products or services would you like
us to provide for you, and what companies do you know that provide
them?" Check in with your vendors. They will know which firms in your
industry might make likely candidates for acquisition. Take the top
salespeople in your industry to lunch or dinner. They often have
insight and information on where promising opportunities lie.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, don't overlook the Internet, where a growing number of
sites list businesses for sale. Many of these focus on
mom-and-pop-type businesses, but several offer information on
mid-market companies. Most of these sites will let you search by
category and/or region, and many allow you to sign up for e-mail to
notify you of new businesses for sale. Some charge a fee for their
services; others are free.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, get out and press the flesh. Make yourself visible at
trade shows and industry gatherings. Let people know that you're
looking, and news of opportunities will find its way to you.</TE>

<HD>Gamers Go for Custom Looks</HD>
<DH>Some are paying big bucks to have PCs that are powerful and
eye-catching</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATT SLAGLE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>These 21st century hot rods have exotic electronic components,
plastic windows, fancy lacquered paint jobs and neon lights that
pulsate to music.</LD>
<LD>   They also have price tags in the thousands of dollars.</LD>
<LD>   In one of the personal computer industry's few robust niches, a
handful of companies are turning a profit selling expensive,
custom-made PCs and accessories to wealthy, elite gamers.</LD>
<TE>   "Games certainly are the most demanding [on computers], short of
decoding the human genome," said Michael Gartenberg, research
director at Jupiter Research.</TE>
<TE>   All computers basically use the same parts, be they hard drives,
processors or memory chips. In gaming computers, though, everything
is installed by hand and fine-tuned for maximum performance.</TE>
<TE>   These souped-up machines use the fastest memory chips and arrays
of high-capacity hard drives. Tiny fans and water-cooling systems
rapidly dissipate heat, the nemesis of speedy computer parts. A
powerful graphics card costing as much as $400 directs the on-screen
action.</TE>
<TE>   Kelt Reeves, who formed Falcon Northwest Computer Systems about 10
years ago when Id Software Inc. released the iconographic game
"Doom," is widely considered the creator of the gaming computer
market.</TE>
<TE>   Ashland, Ore.-based Falcon Northwest began by building a few
high-end systems for gamers wanting the three-dimensional world of
demons and weapons to run smoothly.</TE>
<TE>   With today's games striving for photo-realism, there's plenty of
demand for more power.</TE>
<TE>   "Business is phenomenal," Reeves said. "It's more than we can
handle, actually."</TE>
<TE>   Aesthetically, tricked-out neon lights and windows that let you
see the computer's innards are another source for bragging rights,
and the demand for beauty as well as brawn is growing, Reeves said.</TE>
<TE>   That's especially true for affluent gamers who prefer exotic
computers costing between $2,500 and $10,000, he said. Each Falcon
aluminum case is unique, featuring custom graphics and 15 coats of
baked-on automotive-grade paint.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, every bit of wiring and circuitry is meticulously threaded
around the motherboard to the power supply, disk drives and other
parts.</TE>
<TE>   Those newer to gaming or without the large bank accounts tend to
buy Falcon Northwest's beige gaming machines, which sell for less
than $2,000. The more expensive computers outsell the cheaper models
4 to 1, Reeves said, declining to release sales figures.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are hobbyists who build their own gaming rigs, part by
part. The specs on Kevin Atkison's latest computer could just as
easily be for some newfangled street cruiser: Blue neon light tubes,
Corsair XMS 3200 DDR memory and a GeForce 3 video card, all wrapped
in a shiny aluminum Lian Li case with a clear plastic side window for
easy viewing.</TE>
<TE>   The 22-year-old Phoenix resident was among the thousands who
recently hauled their systems to QuakeCon 2002, the gamer festival
held in the Dallas suburb of Mesquite, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Like many, Atkison opted to buy the parts separately and build his
machine at home--for a little more than $1,500.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just to show off your stuff," he said, flipping open the
front glass panel to access the disk drives.</TE>
<TE>   For others, the less it looks like a computer, the better.</TE>
<TE>   While others strained to lug their computers in the line entering
QuakeCon, Melinda Buckley of Valdosta, Ga., pulled hers with a cord.</TE>
<TE>   The computer was built to look like a miniature World War II troop
transport truck: a camouflage tarp over the truck bed, wheels,
headlights made of two flashlights, and painted green plastic toy
bricks holding it together.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to do more stuff," she said. "Brake lights, and if I can
find a motor powerful enough, a remote control."</TE>
<TE>   Roger Kay, an industry analyst with technology research firm IDC
in Framingham, Mass., estimates that gaming computer companies
accounted for less than 1% of the 15.5 million home computers sold in
2001.</TE>
<TE>   Still, with their relatively high costs, companies such as Falcon
Northwest and Alienware are padding their bottom lines while the
commodity PC industry experiences lackluster sales.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the current slump in consumer PC sales, Gartenberg
believes that bigger players such as Hewlett-Packard Co. and Dell
Computer Corp. may try to cash in on the high-profit gaming computer
market.</TE>
<TE>   Wooing customers won't be easy, though.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tough market," Gartenberg said. "It's a core audience that
installs a new operating system as a form of social entertainment. If
you don't cut the mustard, you're called on it right away."</TE>

<HD>Google Jumps to No. 4 in Popularity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Search engine Google took a big jump up in popularity last month.
Reston, Va.-based ComScore Media Metrix reported that Google
(www.google.com) was the fourth-most popular Web destination among
Internet users in the United States in July, with an estimated 37.5
million visitors from home and work.</LD>
<LD>   Google climbed two spots from its June ranking, bumping aside the
Web networks of media conglomerates Primedia Inc. (its best-known
site is About.com) and Terra Lycos, the previous No. 5 and No. 4 in
ComScore's list. But the long-standing top three Web
properties--those of AOL Time Warner Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Yahoo
Inc.--remained far above Google, with audiences of 98 million, 89.8
million and 83.4 million, respectively, in July.</LD>
<LD>   Google doesn't have AOL, MSN or Yahoo's advantage of being the
default home page for Internet providers and Web browsers, nor does
it offer their breadth of services. And yet "it's essentially become
a household brand," said ComScore senior manager Max Kalehoff.
ComScore's rankings are based on a sampling of Internet users who
agree to install its monitoring software on their computers.</LD>

<HD>Sony, Nintendo Expect Bumper Year in Europe</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sony Corp. and its Japanese video games peer Nintendo Co. reiterated
their expectations for a bumper year in the European market, hinting
that business may be even better than forecast.</LD>
<LD>   Sony Computer Entertainment said it expected to ship 5.8 million
PlayStation 2 consoles in the second half of 2002 in regions of
Europe, Australia and the Middle East that use the PAL-TV format. The
shipments will bring the total installed base to 14 million units in
the region.</LD>
<LD>   At a parallel event in London, Nintendo said it had sold 1 million
of its GameCube consoles to consumers in Europe in the 11 weeks since
the European launch in early May.</LD>
<TE>   The company added that it expects to have shipped 3 million
GameCubes to resellers in Europe by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Sony, which launched its Play- Station 2 one year before Nintendo
introduced its similarly featured GameCube, is market leader with 33
million units sold around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Nintendo gave a global outlook that was a notch up from its last
forecast in May. It expects to have sold 16 million GameCubes by the
end of its fiscal year in March 2003. Seven million of those will
have been sold in the United States, 5 million in Japan and 4 million
in Europe, a spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   Nintendo had said in May that its target was to sell 12 million
GameCubes in the current financial year on top of the 3.8 million
sold the year before.</TE>

<HD>Mighty Ericsson's Descent Is a Blow to Swedish Ego</HD>
<DH>Telecom: 'For many it's hard to believe in the future,'
says a union representative. The company has been battered by the
industry's steep downturn.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARL RITTER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>STOCKHOLM</DL>
<LD>Two years ago, LM Ericsson was Sweden's biggest business, the main
private employer, foreign exchange earner and bulwark of the stock
exchange. Shares of the wireless equipment company, the world's
largest, traded at $24 apiece.</LD>
<LD>   Ericsson shares now trade at 73 cents on Nasdaq, and company
executives on an eight-nation tour are hard pressed to sell newly
issued shares priced at just 40 cents.</LD>
<LD>   The downfall has wiped out nearly a decade of growth and burned
thousands of investors. It has been painful not only for the
126-year-old firm and its employees but also for Swedes accustomed to
basking in the image of their nation as a technology leader.</LD>
<TE>   "It's so gloomy it's almost unbelievable," Ericsson Chief
Executive Kurt Hellstroem said recently as he and Chairman Michael
Treschow launched a promotion to sell $3.2 billion in new shares to
current Ericsson investors in Europe and the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The company hopes the stock issue generates cash to reduce debt
and finance restructuring, including massive layoffs that will chop
Ericsson's work force to 65,000 by the end of 2003, down from a peak
of 107,000 early last year.</TE>
<TE>   Executives believe they can reposition the firm to weather the
telecommunications recession and to grab new business when the market
finally turns around.</TE>
<TE>   "We are the main player. We're going to be the last one to give
up," Hellstroem insisted in an interview at the company's
flat-roofed, utilitarian headquarters on Telefonvaegen--Telephone
Street--where an early 20th century corner phone booth serves as the
lone reminder that Ericsson helped shape the industry.</TE>
<TE>   Ericsson began as an engineering workshop in downtown Stockholm,
manufacturing and repairing telegraph equipment. It produced its
first telephone in 1878.</TE>
<TE>   These days, Ericsson has a rich basket of patents and contracts
and is the market leader in wireless network equipment--including
base stations, routers and other equipment used to transmit data
between wireless devices--which represent 90% of sales.</TE>
<TE>   But like Motorola Inc., Nortel Networks Ltd., Lucent Technologies
Inc. and other beleaguered rivals, Ericsson has been hurt as
"third-generation" mobile services have failed to meet expectations.
Nokia Corp. of Finland, the world's No. 1 maker of mobile handsets,
is turning a profit but also announced job cuts recently.</TE>
<TE>   Orders at Ericsson have declined sharply since 2000 as debt-ridden
network operators have delayed upgrades. The collapse of WorldCom
Inc., a major buyer of networking gear, hasn't helped.</TE>
<TE>   Ericsson lost $2.3 billion last year, its first loss ever. Then,
excluding the better-than-expected operations of a joint handset
venture with Sony Corp., Ericsson lost $765 million in the first half
of 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "If the current situation holds up and they can't reverse the
outflow of cash, the company will go bankrupt fairly quickly," said
analyst Richard Windsor of Nomura Group.</TE>
<TE>   Ericsson's credit rating recently was reduced to junk status by
Moody's Investors Service and Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. That will raise
interest payments by about $16 million a year. Ericsson is carrying
$22 billion in short-term debt.</TE>
<TE>   Uncertainty is noticeable within the company.</TE>
<TE>   "For many it's hard to believe in the future," said Anna-Karin
Mattsson, a union representative at a business unit that laid off 650
workers this year. "The company leadership is trying to show the
bright spots that do exist. But many are just waiting. They say, 'I
made it this time, but what happens next time?' "</TE>
<TE>   "We definitely think they have a good future ahead of them even if
the next year and a half is going to be tough and they have a lot to
prove," said Per Lindtorp, an analyst with Hagstroemer &amp; Qviberg.</TE>
<TE>   Until a couple of years ago, Ericsson was considered untouchable.
It accounted for one-fifth of Sweden's gross domestic product, and it
had avoided being bought by global competitors, unlike such large
Swedish companies as car makers Volvo, now owned by Ford Motor Co.,
and Saab, now held by General Motors Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Ericsson has a smaller market capitalization than Swedish
fashion retailer H&amp;M, and the entire Swedish telecom industry is
about to be eclipsed by the forestry sector in export value terms.</TE>

<HD>Webcams Add Live--but Jerky--Video to Messages</HD>
<DH>Internet: Images from Yahoo and Logitech products usually
look more like photos than a real-time feed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANICK JESDANUN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When sending an instant text message on the Internet just won't do,
try flashing some video instead. With a Webcam and the right
software, friends and colleagues can see you live.</LD>
<LD>   Instant messaging programs have long come with the ability to send
documents, photos and video files. Live audio also was possible. Now,
there's live video.</LD>
<LD>   Yahoo Messenger now offers built-in live video, and an add-on is
available from Logitech for AOL Instant Messenger and MSN Messenger.
Both products are free.</LD>
<TE>   Don't get your hopes up, though.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the time, the video looks more like a series of photos,
even when using high-speed connections on both ends. It's even worse
when one side is using a dial-up connection.</TE>
<TE>   The exception: the "Super Webcam" mode that comes with Yahoo
Messenger version 5.5, released in mid-August.</TE>
<TE>   Both sender and recipient must have broadband, and even then, they
must be direct connections unencumbered by security firewalls or
gateways known as proxies. The best way to know is to try.</TE>
<TE>   If you do get Super Webcam to work, you'll get pretty decent
moving images. I got up to 10 frames per second on a screen 5 inches
across and 3 1/2 inches wide--not bad given the technical
limitations.</TE>
<TE>   The frame rate for normal mode, available since last summer's
release of version 4.1, is less than one per second, meaning the
video comes across stilted and jerky.</TE>
<TE>   The software is fairly easy to use. Just select "Invite to View My
Webcam" and enter the user name of the person you're trying to
contact. The software will automatically configure your settings and
determine whether you can run Super Webcam.</TE>
<TE>   The recipient must accept the invitation and can lodge a complaint
with the click of a link.</TE>
<TE>   The feature could use better integration with text messaging. It
would be nice to have video and text together in the same window.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Instant Messenger and MSN Messenger do not have native live
video support (though Windows Messenger for Windows XP does). So
Logitech, which includes Webcams in its product portfolio, developed
the IM Video Companion to fill the void.</TE>
<TE>   Performance is so-so. The video stutters clumsily even when both
sides have broadband.</TE>
<TE>   Video comes across as a text message encouraging me to "Click to
see my video." Clicking on the link takes me to Logitech's Web site,
where I can view the stream. Better integration between text, audio
and video would be nice.</TE>
<TE>   Logitech lets you send the same video stream to multiple AOL and
MSN users at once or stop a feed to specific users you've already
invited. Yahoo also permits multiple users, but they must all be on
its system.</TE>
<TE>   The Logitech software works with non-Logitech cameras, though
older and cheaper ones may not be compatible. It needs MSN Messenger
4.0 or AOL Instant Messenger 4.7 and up.</TE>
<TE>   Yahoo's video feature works with Windows 98 and up and most
standard Webcams.</TE>
<TE>   Neither works with Macintosh computers.</TE>
<TE>   With Yahoo's Super Webcam, you might be able to make out some
facial expressions and gestures. Barely.</TE>

<HD>United Airlines' Parent May Pick CEO Soon</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Reports over the weekend mention three possible
candidates to head UAL Corp., which has been searching for almost a
year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The top job at UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines, might not seem
like a plum assignment with the company facing possible bankruptcy,
involved in a bitter fight with its unions and in danger of losing a
huge federal loan guarantee.</LD>
<LD>   But numerous executives would like the chance to fix the ailing
airline, which has been looking for a new chief executive for almost
a year. Over the holiday weekend, reports surfaced that a CEO would
be named soon, perhaps as early as today.</LD>
<LD>   There was wide disagreement over who would get the job. The online
edition of the Wall Street Journal quoted unnamed sources saying
Glenn Tilton, vice chairman of ChevronTexaco Corp. and acting
chairman of struggling Dynegy Inc., has the backing of the UAL board
to become chairman, president and CEO. The newspaper also reported
that a meeting of the board was scheduled for today.</LD>
<TE>   In the meantime, Business Week magazine, also citing unnamed
sources, reported that the top contenders are John Walker, CEO of
Weirton Steel Corp. and a UAL director since March, and Michael
Durham, who was chief financial officer of American Airlines in the
early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Company officials did not return calls seeking comment. UAL board
members were told to keep quiet and said they could not confirm
whether a board meeting was scheduled for today.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not supposed to say anything," said board member John Van de
Kamp, former California attorney general.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Line Pilots Assn. also was unable to confirm whether the
naming of a new CEO was imminent, even though one of its members sits
on the board of the 55% employee-owned UAL.</TE>
<TE>   "That is the kind of stuff he has not been sharing with us," said
union spokesman Herb Hunter on Sunday. "He said that until the
company makes a statement he would have no comment."</TE>
<TE>   UAL, which lost an industry record $2.1 billion last year, is
seeking deep concessions from its workers. But its unions have said a
permanent CEO needs to be named before negotiations can begin.</TE>
<TE>   Interim CEO Jack Creighton, who said this summer that the nation's
second-biggest airline faces bankruptcy if it doesn't cut costs
drastically enough to win a $1.8-billion federal loan guarantee, took
over last year when James Goodwin resigned under pressure.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, UAL fell 18 cents to close at $2.87 in New York Stock
Exchange trading. The stock has lost 90% of its value this year.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to get moving forward, the sooner the better," said
Hunter. "We are like a ship without a rudder."</TE>
<TE>   Tilton, 53, was chairman and CEO of Texaco before the company was
sold to Chevron in 2001. He began his career with Texaco in 1970 as a
sales trainee.</TE>
<TE>   In early 2001 Tilton became chairman of the board and CEO of
Texaco, but before the end of that year the company merged with
Chevron and he was named vice chairman. He was named to the board of
the troubled Dynegy in January and became interim CEO in May. San
Francisco-based ChevronTexaco holds a 26.5% stake in Dynegy.</TE>
<TE>   Walker was named CEO of Weirton in January 2001 and then set upon
leading the seventh-largest U.S. integrated steel producer through a
financial restructuring that eliminated jobs and reduced debt at the
partly employee-owned company.</TE>
<TE>   Durham was an executive with reservations system Sabre Holdings
Corp. but left the company shortly before it was spun off from AMR
Corp.--owner of American Airlines--in 1999. He set up a Dallas-based
consulting firm called Cognizant Associates.</TE>
<TE>   Durham is a director at Hotwire.com, an online travel reservations
company partly backed by major airlines and Texas Pacific Group, an
investment firm.</TE>

<HD>Bank Discovers a Niche in Asset-Backed Bonds</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>ALEKSANDRS ROZENS</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>At a time when many companies are finding it harder to sell bonds,
one New York investment firm aims to help turn fashion logos and drug
patents into a way to raise cash more cheaply.</LD>
<LD>   Some companies can still sell corporate bonds even if it means
paying more to investors to compensate for perceived risk in a
post-Enron era. But banking boutique UCC Capital, with the help of a
General Electric Co. unit, hopes to help other cash-hungry companies
raise money selling bonds backed by income from trademarks, licensing
fees and patents.</LD>
<LD>   Using capital from GE EMX, UCC hopes to make as much $500 million
in loans to companies that put up as collateral their regular income
from patents or from the licensing of fashion logos. It will then
bundle the loans into bonds.</LD>
<TE>   The key to UCC's strategy is a practice used in the U.S. housing
market over the last two decades in which mortgage lenders raise
money by bundling regular home loan payments into bonds and selling
them on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the next evolutionary step in intellectual property
securitization," said UCC founder and president Robert D'Loren, who
sees his company exploiting a unique niche.</TE>
<TE>   "We have filled a void that's been in the middle market lending
and investment banking business for the last two or three years,"
D'Loren said. "Given the recent consolidation in investment banks and
finance companies, we have positioned ourselves to fill the gap with
a better lending model."</TE>
<TE>   Loans made by UCC are expected to range from $30 million to $50
million but have no set limit.</TE>
<TE>   UCC said it hopes to underwrite $400 million to $500 million in
loans by next summer and twice that amount in the following year. UCC
may retain the loans, which are expected to have 7-to 10-year terms,
or sell them as a so-called asset-backed bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Shoe company Candie's Inc. recently completed a $20-million bond
by pooling and selling regular income from licensing its name to
handbag and eye-wear makers. UCC structured the deal and it was sold
to an insurance company.</TE>
<TE>   Using the asset-backed bond market, D'Loren said, a company can
issue debt three to five credit-rating notches above the rating on
its own corporate debt.</TE>
<TE>   This is important because a higher rating cuts the cost to a
company for raising money, and bonds backed by a regular cash flow
can get a higher rating.</TE>
<TE>   For example, a company with a triple-B rating could raise money
through the sale of debt rated single-A, saving the company 2.5
percentage points on the loan rate, D'Loren said.</TE>

<HD>In Baseball, Union Retains Its Clout</HD>
<DH>Labor: Latest agreement with team owners once again shows
the strength of the Major League Players Assn.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Across the country, peanuts and Cracker Jack will be served today.
Fresh lines of chalk will separate the field of play from foul
territory. And the national anthem will blare out of loudspeakers as
hundreds of thousands of fans sing along.</LD>
<LD>   The Major League Baseball Players Assn. may have helped save the
remainder of the 2002 season by agreeing to increased revenue sharing
and a luxury tax, but it retains its clout as one of the nation's
most powerful brotherhoods, capable of bringing the 126-year-old
national pastime to a halt.</LD>
<LD>   "Clearly they're the most successful union in post-World War II
America, if you measure success by the enormous gains it's made for
its members," said Chuck Korr, a professor of history at the
University of Missouri at St. Louis who recently published a book on
baseball's labor history.</LD>
<TE>   The union's strength is drawn in part from skilled leadership from
veterans of the United Steelworkers of America union and an unusual
degree of cohesiveness among the ranks, a unique formula that makes
the most of collective bargaining. It also helps that the game's
superstars have shown an unparalleled willingness to put their
astronomical salaries on the line and go to bat for their brethren at
the bottom of the pay scale.</TE>
<TE>   Since the union's early days, minimum player salaries have
increased from $13,500 to $200,000. Average salaries have skyrocketed
from $24,909 in 1969 to $2.34 million. Players have prevailed in each
of the eight work stoppages since 1972.</TE>
<TE>   That record of success makes the players union the envy of the
U.S. labor movement. Nationwide, the proportion of workers
represented by unions has dropped from one in three in 1955 to one in
eight today.</TE>
<TE>   A full assessment on how well the players union fared in Friday's
agreement won't be possible for several years.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think [Friday's deal] says anything at all about the
strength of either side," said Leonard Koppett, a member of the
writers wing of the Baseball Hall of Fame and author of "Koppett's
Concise History of Major League Baseball." "If it turns out to be
very disadvantageous to one side or the other, then we'll be able to
say somebody lost."</TE>
<TE>   Korr said both sides were able to prevail by avoiding a potential
devastating strike. The union "got what was acceptable to them at no
cost. I don't see how anybody can call that losing."</TE>
<TE>   Relations between the union and the team owners weren't always
adversarial. In its early days, the Major League Baseball Players
Assn. acted more as an advisor than an adversary. When it was formed
in 1954, its main purpose was to allow players to work with team
owners in administering the players' pension fund.</TE>
<TE>   (The first attempt by players to organize came as early as 1885,
but owners were able to suppress that and several subsequent
attempts.)</TE>
<TE>   The climate changed by 1965, when five veteran players--including
19-game winner Jim Bunning of the Philadelphia Phillies--began
searching for a strong leader.</TE>
<TE>   "Baseball was increasingly turning to corporate ownership--CBS had
bought the Yankees--and we knew we needed representation," said
Bunning, now a Republican senator from Kentucky.</TE>
<TE>   In 1966, the players found it in Marvin Miller, chief economic
advisor for the United Steelworkers of America, and Dick Moss, the
union's associate general counsel. Miller became executive director
of the Major League Baseball Players Assn. and Moss its general
counsel.</TE>
<TE>   "We started working in some pretty primitive times," Moss said.
"The minimum major league salary was $6,000, and had been for 20
years. The spring training allowance was $25 a week, and had been for
20 years."</TE>
<TE>   In just one year, Miller and Moss persuaded team owners to double
the minimum salary to $12,000. But Moss was amazed by the lack of
respect the owners had for players.</TE>
<TE>   "The owners' most frequent line to the players was, 'If you don't
like it, go find something else to do,' " Moss said. "In some cases,
they'd tell the white player, 'Go drive a truck,' and if it was a
black player, it was, 'Go pick cotton.' "</TE>
<TE>   That attitude only helped foster solidarity among players.</TE>
<TE>   In 1969, the union won the right for players to seek an
independent arbitrator to settle their grievances. It proved a
critical breakthrough for the union because it allowed players to
break free from the major instrument of their angst--the reserve
clause, which allowed team owners to unilaterally renew a player's
contract year after year. The only stipulation was that the player's
salary couldn't be cut by more than 20%.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis Cardinals outfielder Curt Flood challenged the reserve
clause in 1970 by filing a $4.1-million antitrust lawsuit against
Major League Baseball. The players union backed him.</TE>
<TE>   "He claimed [baseball owners] were in violation of antitrust laws
by denying him the right to seek gainful employment where he wanted,"
Korr said. "He lost at every level, but he energized the players. He
turned it into an 'us' versus 'them' situation."</TE>
<TE>   So in 1972, when team owners tried to reduce their payment to the
players pension fund by $500,000, the players decided to fight back.</TE>
<TE>   That first strike lasted about a week, wiping out 60 to 80 games.</TE>
<TE>   "The owners settled by giving the players everything they asked
for," Korr said. "It showed the players they could win."</TE>
<TE>   The players won another important battle in 1973 when they gained
the right to seek raises from an independent arbitrator, and then
free agency in 1976. The victories would help pave the way for
competition between teams and ultimately led to today's
multimillion-dollar salaries.</TE>
<TE>   "With arbitration and free agency, the baseball players have dealt
from a position of strength," said Richard Berthelsen, general
counsel of the NFL Players Assn. "Every subsequent bargaining has
been about what, if anything, will the players give back? That's why
they always win."</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, owners tried to do away with the free-agent bidding
system and salary arbitration. Players responded by going on strike,
a 232-day ordeal that resulted in the cancellation of the World
Series. As usual, they prevailed. The National Labor Relations Board
ruled the owners were committing unfair labor practices, and a
federal judge ordered them to restore free-agent bidding and salary
arbitration.</TE>
<TE>   "The strikes have never been over something the players wanted,"
Koppett said. "It has always been to prevent the owners from taking
away something the players have. In wars--and these labor things are
wars--the country that's defending its homeland always has an
advantage over the invader."</TE>
<TE>   This dispute was different. Players had agreed to a system that
included revenue sharing and a luxury tax in their last contract.
This time, the sides were haggling over the numbers that would be
attached to such a system. That kind of disagreement is easier to
resolve.</TE>
<TE>   "The basic factor here is there is no philosophical war," said
Bill Gould, a labor law professor at Stanford Law School and former
chairman of the National Labor Relations Board. "There is just a
question of dollars and cents."</TE>

<HD>Most Whistle-Blowers See Retaliation, Survey Shows</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Most employees who expose workplace wrongdoing face some form of
retaliation, and many still lack the legal right to protect
themselves, says a report released Sunday by a whistle-blower
advocate organization.</LD>
<LD>   About half the whistle-blowers who responded to a survey by the
nonprofit National Whistleblower Center in Washington said they were
fired after reporting unlawful conduct. Most of the others said they
faced on-the-job harassment or unfair discipline.</LD>
<LD>   The report recommends that Congress pass legislation to protect
all government and private-sector whistle-blowers from reprisals in
the same way that existing laws shield from retaliation victims who
report discrimination based on race or sex.</LD>
<TE>   A patchwork of more than a dozen federal laws now allows
whistle-blowers to fight employer reprisals in certain cases, such as
airline safety and nuclear power plant violations. Legislation passed
in July protects employees who report financial misconduct at
publicly traded companies.</TE>
<TE>   Workers who expose many other types of abuse--election fraud,
campaign finance abuse, obstruction of justice, witness intimidation
and the like--remain without legal recourse if an employer decides to
retaliate, the report said.</TE>

<HD>The Power to Change the World</HD>
<DH>A hydrogen-based system replacing our reliance on oil would
revolutionize society.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEREMY RIFKIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For years, experts have been saying we have only 40 or so years of
cheap, available crude oil left. Now some of the world's leading
petroleum geologists are suggesting that global oil production could
peak and begin a steep decline as early as the end of this decade,
sending oil prices through the roof. Increasing tensions between the
West and Islamic countries, where most of the world's oil is
produced, could further threaten our access to affordable oil.</LD>
<LD>   In desperation, the United States and other nations could turn
increasingly to dirtier fossil fuels--coal, tar sand and heavy
oil--which would only worsen global warming and imperil the Earth's
already beleaguered ecosystems.</LD>
<LD>   There is a better way to go: hydrogen power.</LD>
<TE>   Weaning the world off oil and turning it toward hydrogen, however,
will require a concerted effort by industry, government and local
communities on a scale comparable to the efforts in the 1980s and
1990s that helped create the World Wide Web.</TE>
<TE>   Hydrogen is the most basic and ubiquitous element in the universe.
It is the "forever fuel," producing no harmful carbon dioxide
emissions when burned and giving off as byproducts only heat and pure
water. All that needs to be done is to extract hydrogen from various
elements so that it is useable in fuel cells.</TE>
<TE>   The commercially usable hydrogen currently being produced is
extracted mostly from natural gas. However, renewable sources of
energy--wind, hydro, photovoltaic, geothermal, biomass--are
increasingly being used to generate electricity locally, and in the
future that electricity will in turn be used to electrolyze water and
separate out hydrogen that can be used to power fuel cells.</TE>
<TE>   Commercial fuel cells powered by hydrogen are just now being
introduced into the market for home, office and industrial use. The
major auto makers have spent more than $2 billion on development of
hydrogen cars, buses and trucks; the first mass-produced vehicles are
expected to be on the road in just a few years.</TE>
<TE>   Exactly how soon we will all be driving hydrogen cars will depend
on a number of factors, including the price of oil on world markets,
the availability of hydrogen refueling stations and numerous other
technical questions in the manufacturing process itself.</TE>
<TE>   Even given these stumbling blocks, many energy experts believe
that over the next several decades hydrogen fuel cells will become
our best source of energy. And the rise of this source of power would
open the way for fundamental changes in our markets and political and
social institutions, just as coal and steam power did at the
beginning of the Industrial Age.</TE>
<TE>   The hydrogen economy would make possible a vast redistribution of
power. Today's centralized, top-down flow of energy, controlled by
global oil companies and utilities, would become obsolete. In the new
era, every human being could become the producer as well as the
consumer of his or her own energy--so-called "distributed
generation."</TE>
<TE>   When millions of users connect their fuel cells by hooking into
existing power grids, using the same design principles and smart
technologies that made possible the Web, they can begin to share
energy peer-to-peer--creating a new, decentralized form of energy
use.</TE>
<TE>   In the hydrogen fuel cell era, even the automobile itself would be
a "power station on wheels" with a generating capacity of 20
kilowatts. Since the average car is parked most of the time, it could
be plugged in, during nonuse hours, to the home, office or the main
interactive electricity network, providing premium electricity back
to the grid.</TE>
<TE>   When the end users also become the producers of their energy, the
only role remaining for existing power plants is to become "virtual
power plants" that can manufacture and market fuel cells, bundle
energy services and coordinate the flow of energy over the existing
power grids.</TE>
<TE>   Hydrogen would dramatically cut down on carbon dioxide emissions
and mitigate the effects of global warming. And because hydrogen is
so plentiful and exists everywhere, every human being, once we all
become masters of the technology, could be "empowered," resulting in
the first truly democratic energy regime in history.</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere would hydrogen energy be more important than in the
developing world.</TE>
<TE>   Incredibly, 65% of the human population has never made a single
telephone call, and one-third has no access to electricity or any
other form of commercial energy.</TE>
<TE>   Lack of access to energy, especially electricity, is a key factor
in perpetuating poverty around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Conversely, access to energy means more economic opportunity. In
South Africa, for example, for every 100 households electrified, 10
to 20 new businesses are created.</TE>
<TE>   Electricity frees human labor from day-to-day survival tasks. In
resource-poor countries, simply finding enough firewood or dung to
warm a house or cook meals can take hours out of each day.</TE>
<TE>   Electricity provides power to run farm equipment, operate small
factories and craft shops and light homes, schools and businesses.</TE>
<TE>   As the price of hydrogen fuel cells and accompanying appliances
plummets with new innovations and economies of scale, cells will
become more available, as was the case with transistor radios,
computers and cellular phones. The goal ought to be to provide
stationary fuel cells for every neighborhood and village in the
developing world.</TE>
<TE>   The road to global security lies in lessening our dependence on
Middle East oil and making sure that all people on Earth have access
to the energy they need to sustain life. The hydrogen economy is a
promissory note for a safer world.</TE>

of the World Wide Energy Web and the Redistribution of Power on

<HD>Out-of-Sync Work Shifts, Out-of-Sync Families</HD>
<DH>Child care is a pressing need for those with odd work
hours.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSALIND CHAIT BARNETT and CARYL RIVERS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We hear a lot about how Americans are overworked and expected to
commit to long hours on the job. But little attention has been paid
to another issue that is just as important as how long they work:
when they work.</LD>
<LD>   Irregular work schedules, mandatory overtime and untraditional
work shifts are affecting the lives of millions of working Americans.</LD>
<LD>   About 40% of full-time employees work nontraditional shifts, and
at least 7 million mothers of children under the age of 15 work
nonstandard hours.</LD>
<TE>   These numbers are projected to increase sharply as U.S. job growth
occurs in areas that rely on shift workers--personal services and
health care. And, with globalization, many white-collar workers will
find themselves working odd hours.</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly, financial services and communications personnel,
computer systems engineers, lawyers, managers and other support
personnel are working in shifts because they have to be available at
all hours to serve clients around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Although fewer Americans are working the standard 9-to-5 workday,
the world remains structured as if they were. Meeting the needs of
children is a huge challenge because the parents are out of sync with
the timetable of the larger society.</TE>
<TE>   Parents must grapple with arranging off-hours child care and
finding adult-supervised activities for their school-age children
when school is out and they, the parents, are still at work.</TE>
<TE>   The after-school hours can be a special problem. Supervised
after-school programs for school-age children are all too rare.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, between 2 million and 6 million youngsters under 13
regularly care for themselves, and 44% of families do not have any
regular after-school care for their children.</TE>
<TE>   Research tells us that children can be at risk if left to their
own devices after school. Between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m., crime and
engagement in other undesired behavior among teenagers go up. The FBI
reports that about 29% of all juvenile offenses occur on school days
between 2 p.m. and 8 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Some couples cope by working opposite shifts, but this juggling
puts additional strain on these families. Harriet Presser of the
University of Maryland reports that divorce rates are high among
split-shift couples.</TE>
<TE>   This is a problem that can't be solved by individual families. All
our social institutions have to be revamped to meet the realities of
the new economy.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, we have a comprehensive model for dealing with these
problems.</TE>
<TE>   The armed services have 24-hour child care, transportation systems
and health care for their personnel, creating a system that operates
around the clock, just as their people do.</TE>
<TE>   Why not take a page from their book and create a system that
actually works for the real lives of civilian Americans?</TE>

<LD>When my mother was growing up as the child of Italian immigrants in
Yorkville, Ohio, she would sometimes go to bed at night with a
burning cross glowing on a nearby hill. She quickly learned that the
crosses were torched by the local Ku Klux Klan chapter for the
benefit of all the immigrant families--a reminder of their tentative
existence in their new country.</LD>
<LD>   The burning cross--taken from ancient Scottish clans--remains as a
virulent symbol of hate and division. This was evident in California
when two people were charged Aug. 19 with the hate crime of burning a
6-foot cross on the lawn of a Lompoc police officer. Like many
states, California has criminalized cross-burning.</LD>
<LD>   However, the future of this law and similar laws across the
country will soon be addressed by the Supreme Court. In Black vs.
Virginia, a convicted KKK member is seeking to protect this vile
practice. And he happens to be right.</LD>
<TE>   In 1998, KKK Grand Wizard Barry Elton Black of Johnstown, Pa., was
prosecuted for burning a 30-foot cross on the property of a willing
owner in Virginia. As in 12 other states and the District of
Columbia, Virginia outlawed the burning of crosses used "with the
intent of intimidating any person or group of persons." In the
ultimate example of circular language, Virginia limits the crime of
cross-burning to such intentionally intimidating acts but then states
that the burning of any cross is "evidence of an intent to
intimidate."</TE>
<TE>   The curious language was an attempt to get around a 1992 case in
which the Supreme Court struck down a St. Paul, Minn., ordinance that
criminalized the "placing on public property ... of a burning cross"
as well as other hate symbols. In this case, racist teenagers had
burned crosses on the lawn of a black family as well as across the
street. While the court agreed that the law was unconstitutional, it
fractured on the reason why.</TE>
<TE>   Confusion has reigned among the states since the decision. Courts
in Maryland, New Jersey, South Carolina and Virginia have struck down
laws prohibiting cross-burning, while courts in Florida, Washington
and California have upheld them.</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, plaintiff Black is the unwanted bill that
periodically comes due for the enjoyment of free speech. It is one of
the great ironies that our most valued constitutional right often
depends on the protection of our least valued speech. In the 1st
Amendment, the majority is denied the right to choose between types
of speech, even when the message is intended to show contempt or
hatred of the majority. This is why the burning of a flag is both an
unspeakable outrage and a protected right.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, from the very beginning of the republic, citizens have
yielded to the temptation to silence obnoxious or unwanted speech.
Even President John Adams, heralded in a recent book as the very
progenitor of liberty, used the Sedition Act to ruthlessly prosecute
political rivals who criticized the government.</TE>
<TE>   The most potent speech is often found in the display of symbols.
Symbolic speech, such as the burning of a flag or a cross, is
intended to convey an instant message to supporters and opponents
alike. It has been such symbols that have attracted the greatest ire
of the majority.</TE>
<TE>   During the Red scare, the government arrested people for
displaying a red flag. During the Vietnam War, the government cracked
down on the wearing of black armbands by peace protesters. In more
recent years, efforts were made to prohibit the showing of a swastika
in a Jewish neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Black and his small cadre of racists gathered on private property
to light a cross and stoke their inner demons. Whatever danger they
represent to our social harmony, suppressing them represents a far
greater danger for our democracy. We are left with an American
paradox.</TE>
<TE>   Black is allowed to struggle each day to keep hate alive, while
those he condemns work to protect his free speech. That is our own
symbol on the hill, as personified by Black's ACLU attorney, David
Baugh, who is African American.</TE>
<TE>   Virginia Atty. Gen. Randolph Beales in the Black case has stressed
that there is no intrinsic value in the burning of crosses. Adopting
the label du jour, Beales has declared cross-burning to be "domestic
terrorism" and stated that it is "intolerable in any free society."
Yet what is intolerable in a free society is the denial of freedom.
It is not that cross-burning has social value. It is the right to
speak freely that has social value.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Good storytellers have always seemed like natural charmers, but now
there is hard science to prove it.</LD>
<LD>   New genetic research that traces the roots of spoken language back
to a "Linguistic Eve" in Africa shows how genes may have conferred a
romantic evolutionary advantage.</LD>
<LD>   The finding, published last month in the British science journal
Nature, shows how a single genetic mutation occurring between 50,000
and 100,000 years ago might have left some early humans better able
than others to spin engaging stories and sing beautiful songs. That
prowess, in turn, would have made them more likely to acquire sexual
partners and spread their genes, says the study's lead author, Svante
Paabo, a researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary
Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.</LD>
<TE>   The study supports a novel theory by Richard Klein, an
archeologist at Stanford, that the emergence of behaviorally modern
humans was set off by a major biological change, most probably the
acquisition of genetic traits giving humans the ability to exert the
sort of fine control over throat and mouth muscles that is needed for
rapid speech.</TE>
<TE>   The new study--the product of an interdisciplinary team of
archeologists, linguists, geneticists and biologists put together by
the Planck Institute--promises to foster warmer feelings between
long-feuding social and natural scientists.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few decades, the dramatic growth in human scientific
knowledge has cowed many academics, leading them to retreat into
ever-narrower and more isolated disciplines.</TE>
<TE>   The Planck Institute has been impressively bucking this trend,
encouraging researchers to ask ambitious questions and answer them
using both intuition and science.</TE>
<TE>   In so doing, the institute has kept alive the spirit of its
namesake, Max Planck. The German physicist, who lived from 1854 to
1947, once said: "Over the entrance to the gates of science are
written the words: Ye must have faith. It is a quality which the
scientist cannot dispense with."</TE>
<TE>   Planck was a polymath. For instance, drawing from his knowledge of
music (he was a pianist with perfect pitch), he came to see that the
motion of electrons through atoms bears less resemblance to the orbit
of planets around the sun, as he had first thought, than to the
trajectory of notes and harmonies in a musical score.</TE>
<TE>   Paabo's study of language and culture exemplifies that sort of
broad, interdisciplinary inquiry. It's a reminder that sometimes
razing scientific walls can hasten the pace of scientific discovery.</TE>

<HD>More Charity, Less Overhead</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Somewhere along the road, the fund-raising run for charity veered off
course.</LD>
<LD>   The races started as a fun way for people to do good. Runners paid
an entry fee that went to the charity and got a free T-shirt.
Nonprofits quickly realized they could make more money if the runners
signed up relatives, friends and co-workers to "sponsor" them in the
race.</LD>
<LD>   Then along came Dan Pallotta, the promoter who created the
fund-raiser extravaganza concept in 1993. His multiple-day walks for
charity and camping trip/bike rides came with traveling tent cities,
good meals and hot showers, some in such exotic locations as Alaska
and Africa.</LD>
<TE>   Pallotta TeamWorks events swept the United States, bringing in
hundreds of millions of dollars until Pallotta last month abruptly
closed the doors to his Los Angeles-based company amid complaints
from nonprofits that the organizer--a private for-profit company--was
getting too much of the money.</TE>
<TE>   Some of these charitable groups sound a bit disingenuous,
especially after they happily took money from Pallotta events during
years of questions about how much of donors' money was swallowed up
by event expenses. Pallotta's answer: You can't look at what percent
goes to charity; you have to look at how much total goes to charity.</TE>
<TE>   Most nonprofits found the situation perfectly acceptable until
they saw their own bottom lines suffering--such as when the 1997
Florida AIDS ride not only showed a miserable 12% going to charity
but raised a disappointing $134,000.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is it correct to solely blame Pallotta's company.
Participants' eyebrows should have gone up at the descriptions of his
events. "Three dinners, four lunches, four breakfasts, mobile hot
showers on tractor trailers ..." and far more, boasts his Web site,
www.pallotta teamworks.com.</TE>
<TE>   Take a look at the finances for the 2001 AIDS rides. Of the $18.8
million that donors gave, only $4 million eventually went to charity,
whereas $6.6 million went to "participant support"--more than a
third. Other outlays include marketing and administration.</TE>
<TE>   Should Pallotta TeamWorks go away permanently, it would leave
behind a legacy of costly, misleading fund-raisers.</TE>
<TE>   Even the venerable Arthritis Foundation has held "Joints in
Motion" runs and walks in such locales as London and Paris. The
foundation says it has no documents breaking down the expenses but
that these three-to-five-day jaunts take up about a quarter of the
money raised. Such events blur the line between charity and
donor-subsidized mini-vacations.</TE>
<TE>   Fund-raisers, even for-profit fund-raisers, should hold to the
basic outlines for charities set out by the Better Business Bureau
that call for 65% of the money to go toward charitable activities.
Charities and event participants alike should be able and willing to
tell donors upfront how much of the money will go to good works.</TE>
<TE>   If fund-raising doesn't get back on track, nonprofits will have to
shoulder some blame for public apathy to their appeals.</TE>

<LD>One rarely noted blessing of Labor Day and summer's unofficial end is
the changed definition of what's news and, therefore, what's on the
nation's chatter agenda. People return to work and school these days
and to doing what's more likely to matter than sitting on a beach
worrying whether they set the air conditioner too low back home.</LD>
<LD>   As recently as last week came reports that more states now were
allowing legal trust funds for pets; news that 1992's devastating
Hurricane Andrew was even stronger than thought; and the revelation
of a very, very long-awaited decision that Earth's earliest known
asteroid impact probably occurred 3.5 billion years ago, give or
take.</LD>
<LD>   More than 15 states now recognize legal trust funds for pets,
averaging $25,000, in the event of their owner's death. (Yes, we know
some believe no one can own any living thing.) No states recognize
pet bequests to owners.</LD>
<TE>   To be honest, no one knows exactly how strong Hurricane Andrew was
in August 1992 because it blew away south Florida's wind-measuring
instruments. Which makes it possible for experts to announce without
great fear of contradiction that its winds were not merely 145 miles
an hour but probably way over 155. This no doubt brings inner peace
to those who collectively suffered more than $25 billion in losses.</TE>
<TE>   About the meteorite, geologists say it was 12 miles wide or maybe
30, and erased global land life, which explains the absence of
Daytimer entries back then.</TE>
<TE>   August was also a tough time to be wildlife this year. Experts
(who else could get away with this stuff?) began poisoning Maryland
ponds and lakes to kill all northern snakehead fish, described as
voracious predators from China that threaten native fish. No
spokesmen extolled immigrant snakehead family life or aquatic
ambition, rising from lowly pond alien to alpha fish.</TE>
<TE>   October and November have always been very bad months to be a deer
in Wisconsin. This year, add August. State, uh, experts--creating a
cure without a recovery--ordered the extraordinary slaughter of
25,000 deer because some might have contagious chronic wasting
disease. Feel better?</TE>
<TE>   On the brighter side of summer's news, LifeGem Memorials of
Chicago says it has perfected a procedure to turn cremated human
remains into diamonds that can be worn by survivors. A full carat of
pressured ashes costs $22,000.</TE>
<TE>   But after today, we can no longer talk about such things.</TE>

<HD>Bush's Never-Ending Deficit-Spending</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush's economic policies have been a disaster for the
country. "Federal Deficit Grows Deeper Than Expected" (Aug. 28)
points out the mounting deficits resulting from his ill-advised
policies. Bush inherited a nearly $300-billion surplus and in only 18
months turned it into a $165-billion deficit, an astounding negative
$465-billion turn in the wrong direction. And now his
smoke-and-mirror policies say his economic programs are going to
produce a surplus in 2005--a projection not supported by fact.</LD>
<LD>   Bush's forecasts are wrong, as the article's graphics clearly
illustrate. Ronald Reagan cut taxes in 1981 while projecting a
surplus, and massive deficits were the results--$3 trillion worth,
still costing taxpayers a $200-billion yearly debt service. The
country might live with short-term deficit spending to speed up the
economy now, but Bush's long-term massive deficit spending
projections are bad for the country because they create uncertainty
for both investors and the financial markets.</LD>
<LD>   Bush has created a big financial mess for America, and I hope he
plans to clean it up himself without trying to blame it on someone
else.</LD>

<LD>I believe that the beaches on the California coastline should belong
to the public (editorial, Aug. 28). I believe that even if you have
beachfront property you should not get your own strip of beach; this
would mean that because I have property in an urban neighborhood, it
entitles me to my own private sidewalk. The bill to accept the access
ways should be passed, but instead of letting the taxpayers handle
the responsibilities, let the beachfront property owners pay.</LD>

<LD>Cardinal Roger Mahony's personal tour of the Cathedral of Our Lady of

Shares His Delight at a Dream Made Manifest," Aug. 28). With each of
Mahony's breathless descriptions, I was taken back to Jackie
Kennedy's gushy televised tour of the White House during her stint as
first lady. In a city plagued by a host of human tragedies resulting
from poverty, among other ills, it's comforting to know that someone
like Mahony can still find a place for high camp.</LD>

<LD>Re "Luggage Quiz for Air Travelers Ends Today," Aug. 29: James Loy of
the Transportation Security Administration announced that questions
to passengers about their luggage could be dropped. Loy stated that
the questions had never resulted in stopping a terrorist act.</LD>
<LD>   There is no way he could know that. The very fact that the
questions were asked may have prevented terrorists from even trying
to give a passenger something to carry. Although now everyone knows
that passengers should not accept anything from a stranger or let
their luggage out of their control, that may not be the case a few
years from now.</LD>
<LD>   At the very least, there should be large signs at airports saying
that passengers should alert authorities if they have been given
something by a stranger or if their bags have not been under their
control.</LD>

<LD>When my husband shot this photo in 1997, he composed the shot
purposely so that it looked as if the Statue of Liberty was taller
than--and was overlooking--the city. His concept was, "What's more
important? Liberty, or the modern world's representative of wealth
and power?"</LD>
<LD>   Of course, today that picture is not only a historic one but one
that truly makes us take a look at where our priorities stand. On
that horrible Sept. 11 morning, my husband and I awoke to the
horrific scenes on television. As we stood in front of our set,
unable to believe what we were seeing, the second plane slammed into
the tower. My husband muttered words that I will never forget. He
said, "Somewhere in the world, people are laughing." As we approach
the one-year anniversary of Sept. 11, I hope that our country has
become more of a nation of pride and confidence in ourselves and in
our neighbors.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Let Genius Soar Above Tragedy," Commentary, Aug. 28: Michael
M. Berger was right on the mark when he described New York as a
metaphor for all that is America. The rebuilding of the World Trade
Center must command awe from all those who will view it, whether from
street level or peeking through the clouds as the old towers did when
one approached New York by air on an overcast day.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly engineering and architectural details can be updated to
prevent another 9/11 tragedy from having such consequences as those
that felled the towers. The Frank Lloyd Wright building that Berger
said was conceived as being a mile high was to be 528 stories and
called the Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   The greatest memorial to those who perished on 9/11 should be a
working building of great significance, not just something that could
be seen in Albany or Sacramento.</TE>

<TE>   Television showed it in greater detail, but those who saw the
apparently imperishable World Trade Center towers flame and fall in
person--as I did--are surely joined spiritually to those who
witnessed such epochal events as the burning of Rome and the fall of
Troy. Berger continues the same blind rush to the monumental as the
misguided plans underway to carve up Washington's National Mall with
a World War II memorial worthy of Albert Speer. In his call for a
monumental memorial commensurate with the scale of the attack, its
target and the number of lives lost, Berger neglects to consider that
all genuine tragedy is intimate. Architect Maya Lin understood this
when she submitted her proposal for Washington's Vietnam Memorial, a
simple chevron cut into the earth. It establishes an immediate,
tactile connection with all those who contemplate the names of the
fallen incised in black granite.</TE>
<TE>   So too should the WTC memorial be an intimate refuge, its
centerpiece the vertical beam removed from ground zero, unspeakably
profound and eloquent in its violent deformation and unwillingness to
fall. Perhaps it should be joined by something on the order of
Hiroshima's "Peace Bell," to be rung twice each Sept. 11 by an honor
guard, at the precise moment the airliners plunged into each tower.
The tragedy reminded a nation that had long disdained it as some kind
of alien planet that New York differs from their communities only in
scale. To emphasize that difference would be regressive, so let the
memorial be on a human scale that every visitor can carry home.</TE>

<LD>Joseph McCluskey, 91, the bronze medalist in the 1932 Olympics in Los
Angeles who held a record 24 national running titles, died Saturday
at his home in Madison, Conn., of causes associated with aging.</LD>
<LD>   In 1932, McCluskey captured the Olympic bronze medal in the
3,000-meter steeplechase, a 7 1/2-lap race that requires a runner to
leap over water and three other hurdles every lap.</LD>
<LD>   At the time, he was a junior and track star at Fordham University.
McCluskey also competed in the 1936 Olympics and qualified for the
1940 Games that were canceled because of World War II.</LD>
<TE>   Between 1930 and 1948, running mostly under the banner of the New
York Athletic Club, McCluskey earned his titles in track and road
events ranging from 3,000-meter steeplechases to 15-kilometer runs.
He earned more than 100 trophies and 500 medals, coached track for
the New York Athletic Club, and competed in masters events until he
was 85.</TE>
<TE>   After serving in the Navy during World War II, McCluskey became a
stockbroker. He was elected to the National Track and Field Hall of
Fame, and to the Fordham and N.Y. Athletic Club halls of fame.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Glenn E. Watts, 82, the president of the Communications Workers of
America who led the union through the breakup of the AT&amp;T Bell
telephone monopoly, died Friday in Washington, D.C., of complications
following surgery.</LD>
<LD>   The North Carolina native attended Wilson Teachers College, and
first went to work for the Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Co. in
1941. He worked his way up through the union ranks from local
president to national secretary-treasurer and then president from
1974 until retiring in 1985.</LD>
<LD>   CWA President Morton Bahr said that Watts "presided over the
Golden Age of workers in the Bell system. But when the big breakup
came, Glenn had the vision to help guide us toward the many changes
we would have to make in the new Information Age."</LD>
<TE>   A friend of President Carter, Watts joined him at a meeting with
Egyptian leader Anwar Sadat as part of Carter's Middle East
peacemaking process. In 1985, Watts established a cultural center in
Jerusalem that encourages understanding between Jewish and Arab
members of Israel's labor federation.</TE>

<HD>Paul Tripp, 91; Father of 'Tubby the Tuba'</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paul Tripp, the actor, director, writer and lyricist who taught
generations of children about orchestral instruments with his
imaginative "Tubby the Tuba," and about history and literature with
his early children's television show "Mr. I. Magination," has died.
He was 91.</LD>
<LD>   Tripp died Thursday in Manhattan of causes associated with aging.</LD>
<LD>   "Tubby" is the indelible story of a lonely, hapless little tuba
who wanted his own melody but was assigned to limit himself forever
to "oompah, oompah." Derided as clumsy and overweight by the other
instruments, he wanders off to the riverbank, meets a helpful
bullfrog who teaches him an "oompah" melody, and then delights the
rest of the orchestra with his new tune.</LD>
<TE>   The moral and musical tale, often compared with a classical 1936
Prokofiev work, "Peter and the Wolf," was first recorded by Tripp in
1945. It has been re-recorded over the decades, selling more than 8
million copies.</TE>
<TE>   'I Liked the Story'</TE>
<TE>   The little saga has been performed live by orchestras around the
world conducted by such legends as Eugene Ormandy, Leonard Bernstein
and Arthur Fiedler. Translated into 30 languages, it has been
narrated by Danny Kaye, Jose Ferrer, Carol Channing, Peter Ustinov
and other actors and by the chef Julia Child, as well as by Tripp
himself.</TE>
<TE>   A "Tubby the Tuba" recording was nominated for a Grammy in 1966,
and a 1983 animated film was nominated for a short subject Oscar.</TE>
<TE>   "Some said it taught people music appreciation," the
then-octogenarian Tripp told the Bergen (N.J.) Record a few years
ago, when "Tubby" celebrated its 50th anniversary. "All I know is, I
liked the story and saw no reason why Tubby and I couldn't continue
for a long while."</TE>
<TE>   Tripp, a native New Yorker whose father was a singer and actor,
was an accomplished actor when "Tubby" emerged to point him toward
children's educational entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   He made his Broadway debut in "Cyrano de Bergerac" in 1936. Four
years later, Tripp was performing in George Kleinsinger's opera
"Victory Against Heaven," when he persuaded the composer to
collaborate on his concept of "Tubby."</TE>
<TE>   The work was barely finished when Tripp was drafted in 1942,
serving in the Army Signal Corps during World War II. Before being
ordered to the China-Burma-India theater, he directed an Army
production, "The Army, Play by Play."</TE>
<TE>   After the war, "Tubby" proved so successful that it became Tripp's
natural entree to the new medium of television.</TE>
<TE>   In 1949, he launched his first children's show, "Mr. I.
Magination," riding into living rooms on a toy train and wearing
engineer's striped overalls. The CBS show lasted three years and
earned him a Peabody award.</TE>
<TE>   Tripp--the creator, producer, director, writer and star--and his
magic train would whisk viewers to Imagination Land with its
intriguing cities Ambitionville, Inventorsville and I-Wish-I-Were
Town.</TE>
<TE>   A lifelong history buff, Tripp contrived his programs from stories
in history and literature, introducing tykes to Rip Van Winkle,
President Lincoln, sharpshooter Annie Oakley and circus impresario
P.T. Barnum, among others.</TE>
<TE>   'I Wasn't a Do-Gooder'</TE>
<TE>   Joining Tripp in multiple roles for each half-hour episode was a
small stock company, including his wife, actress Ruth Enders, and
then-beginning actors Walter Matthau and Richard Boone.</TE>
<TE>   "I never considered it educational," Tripp said on the show's 50th
anniversary, echoing his "Tubby" comments. "I wasn't a do-gooder. I
just loved imparting information to people."</TE>
<TE>   Tripp went on to produce and star in "On the Carousel," another
CBS children's educational variety program, from 1954 to 1959,
earning an Emmy. Later, he starred in a third children's show, the
birthday-themed "Birthday House" for NBC from 1963 to 1967.</TE>
<TE>   The prolific and eclectic entertainer wrote and published about
600 songs and wrote more than 30 record albums for children,
including "Story of Celeste," "Pee Wee the Piccolo" and "Good Night,
Dear Lord," recorded by Johnny Mathis.</TE>
<TE>   Tripp also wrote four children's books, including "The Strawman
Who Smiled by Mistake" in 1967 and "The Little Red Flower" in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   He rarely ventured into Hollywood, except for the 1966 feature
film "The Christmas That Almost Wasn't," about a purported hijacking
of Santa Claus. The film, directed by and starring Rossano Brazzi,
marked the film debut for Tripp, who also starred as well as wrote
the script and lyrics.</TE>
<TE>   Tripp's love of history placed him in several adult stage plays
that also told fact-based stories. He played Ben Franklin, for
example, in a touring company of "1776" that appeared at the Pasadena
Civic Auditorium in 1971. He also toured in a one-man stage
production of "Will Rogers, U.S.A." in 1974 and, in 1980, performed a
PBS one-man show on Thomas Edison.</TE>
<TE>   The entertainer acted on several of the early live-television
drama anthologies, including "Studio One," "Kraft Television Theater"
and "Philco Playhouse."</TE>
<TE>   Tripp attended what is now the City College of the City University
of New York and studied law at Brooklyn College.</TE>
<TE>   Widowed in 1999, Tripp is survived by a daughter, Suzanne Jurmain
of Los Angeles; a son, David of Stuyvesant, N.Y.; and two
grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Clashing Philosophies Finally Bent to Achieve Accord on
State Budget</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A two-month-long deadlock over a new $98-billion California budget
inconvenienced elderly and disabled people, crimped vendors who sell
to the state, and left some college students wondering about their
state assistance.</LD>
<LD>   But after weeks of negotiations, the standoff ended in the closing
hours of the legislative session, after Democrats agreed to drop
their plans to dramatically increase taxes on smokers and Republicans
abandoned their calls for $4 billion in spending cuts. To secure the
deal, Republicans signed off on $2.4 billion in new revenues and
Assembly Democrats agreed to $1.2 billion in spending reductions
above what the state Senate approved in June.</LD>
<LD>   For both parties, those were hard compromises that challenge not
only their vision of the current budget but also their longer-view
notion of what California needs to prosper.</LD>
<TE>   Republicans, who have little direct influence over life in the
Capitol because Democrats enjoy commanding majorities in both houses
of the Legislature, want to cut spending as a way of bringing the
state's programs in line with tax collections.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats generally approach the problem from the opposite
position, preferring to increase taxes to help bridge the state's
year-after-year shortfalls.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Republicans succeeded in blocking some new taxes
sought by Democrats--for now.</TE>
<TE>   And Democrats may have signaled one aspect of their long-term
approach by approving a bill in the Senate that would allow the Davis
administration to triple car fees without legislative approval. Gov.
Gray Davis would not say Sunday what he would do if the bill reached
his desk. The Assembly did not consider the bill before adjourning
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Davis Plans More Cuts</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who has been criticized by Democrats and Republicans for
not playing a more active role in resolving the budget dispute, said
he plans to make additional cuts to the spending package before he
signs it, perhaps by Thursday. Paychecks for elected officials and
legislative staff and payments to vendors that were delayed because
the state was without a budget are expected to go out within a week
after Davis signs the budget.</TE>
<TE>   The governor added that this year's deadlock reflected deeply felt
positions of the two parties, making it difficult for him to
intercede and more appropriate for Assembly Democrats to take the
lead role in the talks. Davis is running for reelection against
Republican Bill Simon Jr., and the long standoff in Sacramento also
loomed as a potential campaign issue in which Davis stood to lose far
more than Simon.</TE>
<TE>   "What Republicans wanted was a reduction in programs Democrats
care deeply about," Davis said. "That required a different strategy."</TE>
<TE>   The Senate approved a budget in June, soon after it was brought to
the floor. That relatively swift approval was not repeated in the
Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   There, Republicans mounted a unified stand against the
multibillion-dollar tax package endorsed by Democrats. As the weeks
dragged on, frustrations grew among legislators. News accounts
highlighted the effects of the standoff on poor people and others;
some Assembly members were urged by constituents to halt the long
talks.</TE>
<TE>   Political and constitutional factors, however, combined to make
resolution difficult. California is one of three states that require
a two-thirds vote of the Legislature to approve a state budget. In
the state Senate, Democrats hold enough seats to pass a budget with
just one cooperating Republican; in the Assembly, four Republicans
are needed.</TE>
<TE>   Jean Ross, executive director of the California Budget Project,
which weighs the impact of budget decisions on low-and middle-income
Californians, said that helped drag out the negotiations. "The level
of diversity and division you have in California, and thus the
Legislature, makes it difficult to reach an agreement," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In the Assembly, Republican leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks accused
Democrats of ignoring GOP warnings for years of the dangers of
overspending. Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City) voiced
frustration over Republicans' refusal to compromise on their position
of no new taxes.</TE>
<TE>   To Democrats' dismay, GOP legislators banded together this year
and refused to negotiate with their liberal counterparts without the
blessing of Cox, who found the leverage he needed to secure a variety
of concessions from Democrats, including $1.2 billion in spending
reductions over what the Senate approved. They include additional
reductions to state agencies and departments, funding public schools
at the minimum level required by law, and an early retirement program
to dwindle the number of state bureaucrats.</TE>
<TE>   "The unique thing this year is that we had four members who said
we will not go up on this budget until you tell us this is the best
we're going to do," Cox said.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats won approval of last year's budget by sidestepping GOP
leaders and convincing the minimum number of Republicans to bolt from
their caucus and vote for the budget. Observers cite Cox's leadership
and a recent redrawing of legislative districts that made most seats
safer for incumbents as reasons the strategy failed this year.</TE>
<TE>   "In the end, the Democrats had to try to negotiate," said Kevin
Gordon, executive director of the California Assn. of School Business
Officials. "It comes down to a new reality, which is picking off a
couple of Republicans isn't as effective of a tool as it once was."</TE>
<TE>   Foiled in their attempts to sidestep the GOP leadership, Democrats
eventually agreed to cap spending next year so that it does not
exceed revenues, which would set the stage for a multibillion-dollar
reduction in state spending. The cap addresses a Republican concern
about the threat of future deficits, which prior to the agreement
reached Saturday were expected to total $45 billion over the next
five years.</TE>
<TE>   Another feature of the deal is the elimination of 1,000 vacant
state positions from the books next year on top of the 6,000 that are
expected to be eliminated this year to save more than $300 million.
Republican lawmakers have made an issue in recent years that "phantom
jobs" continue to haunt state payrolls.</TE>
<TE>   Having responded to some of the GOP's biggest concerns, Democrats
then turned to securing the support of key Republican members who
agreed to meet with them--with the blessing of their own party
leadership. To win the backing of Assemblyman Keith Richman of
Northridge, who was one of four Republicans to vote for the budget
Saturday, Democrats agreed to let voters decide whether they want to
earmark 3% of the general fund each year to pay for infrastructure
projects. The proposal received a chilly reception from certain
Democrats and labor groups, but it nonetheless cleared the
Legislature on Saturday night after a flurry of action.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate Appropriations committee agreed just before 10 p.m. to
consider the constitutional amendment.</TE>
<TE>   Looking dazed, some with their heads propped on their hands,
members listened to Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon) and committee staff
try to explain how the fund created by the measure would be affected
by fluctuating state revenues and ballot measures pending before
voters.</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't know exactly what we're talking about," said Sen.
Betty Karnette (D-Long Beach).</TE>
<TE>   Tobacco Tax Fails</TE>
<TE>   Democrats found the fourth Republican vote they needed after they
agreed to drop their plans to hike state excise taxes on tobacco to
$3 per pack. The change appeased Assemblyman Mike Briggs (R-Fresno),
who said he would not vote for a budget that contained new taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Briggs said he also liked changes Democrats made to a plan by
Davis to suspend for two years businesses' ability to deduct
so-called "net operating losses" to raise $1.2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The plan was modified to let companies claim 100% of the losses
when the suspension ends, as opposed to a scheduled 65%. Advocates
for the poor contend that the change will translate into a tax cut
for California corporations that will eventually exceed $300 million
a year.</TE>
<TE>   The suspension is one of six so-called "revenue enhancements" that
Republicans signed off on to raise $2.4 billion. Other proposals
include suspending a teacher tax credit and increasing withholding on
stock options and bonus payments from 6% to 9.3%.</TE>
<TE>   The concession angered Assembly conservatives who blasted the deal
during a Saturday night debate on the spending package, which cleared
the house on a vote of 54 to 26.</TE>
<TE>   "This budget is not a compromise. This budget is a con job," said
Assemblyman Jay LaSuer (R-La Mesa). "Smoke, mirrors, tax
increases.... It's all here."</TE>
<TE>   Wesson, by contrast, saw the blend of additional revenues and
trimmed services as evidence of success, both for the Legislature and
for his leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman John Campbell, the Irvine Republican who handles
budget matters for his caucus, described the leadership decision to
accept the compromise less as a victory for either side than as a bow
to the inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point we have to say, can we justify holding this
position, or do we need to move?" he asked. "We decided we needed to
move."</TE>

<HD>Funding Set, L.A. Unified Plans to Build</HD>
<DH>Education: District gets $468 million from state agency to
put toward plans to build 79 schools, expand 60 others and enlarge 19
playgrounds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOUG SMITH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the first time in decades, the Los Angeles Unified School
District has money in the bank to fund a significant portion of its
massive school construction needs.</LD>
<LD>   The district's building plans were elevated from theory to reality
last week when a state agency voted to commit the remaining $468
million from the 1998 state school bond to Los Angeles. That,
combined with local bond funds, is more than half the money needed to
complete the 158 projects--new schools, expanded campuses and play
areas--underway or planned.</LD>
<LD>   For district officials, the vote by the State Allocation Board was
a happy ending to a battle against smaller districts around the
state. Two years ago, a Superior Court judge ruled that the state
could not distribute the money to other districts that had less
pressing needs but got applications in ahead of Los Angeles Unified.</LD>
<TE>   But the district still has an enormous classroom shortage that can
be overcome only if voters approve future bond authorizations,
officials say. A $13-billion state bond and a $3.35-billion local
bond will be on the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   If either bond should fail, the district would have to seek other
sources of money, from developer fees to loans secured against the
general fund. At worst, construction plans would have to be
abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell you, there are tough consequences if we don't pass this
bond," said district Supt. Roy Romer.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the 158 projects planned in the next five years are fully
funded, but others are only funded partially or not at all and still
require appropriations from the new bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Those projects will accommodate enrollment growth over the next
five years and do away with forced busing to relieve overcrowding.</TE>
<TE>   The plans for the number and types of projects have been in flux
for several years. Now, they call for 15 high schools, five
continuation high schools, seven middle schools, 26 elementary
schools and 26 primary centers for kindergarten through third grade.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, 60 other campuses, mostly elementary schools, would
be expanded and the playgrounds at 19 would be enlarged.</TE>
<TE>   Construction is underway on a handful of the projects, and the
pace will pick up dramatically by the end of this year. The schedule
calls for completion of seven projects at the end of this year, 52
next year, 65 in 2004 and 19 in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the new schools are to be in the most crowded areas of the
city, including central and South Los Angeles and the east San
Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   While they are supposed to get the most schools, these areas also
face the greatest risk because more of the unfunded projects are in
those highly urbanized areas, where the lack of vacant land slowed
down the planning.</TE>
<TE>   A community activist who has raised concerns about the pace of
school construction in South Los Angeles praised the district's
effort with the applications.</TE>
<TE>   "Our concern has always been for the equity of the allocation, not
just for South L.A., for East L.A. and for the east Valley," said
Karen Bass, executive director of the Community Coalition.</TE>
<TE>   "We're really excited that the district qualified for so much
money. We hope some of the projects are ones from the areas we feel
are most critically in need."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time it is completing the current 158 projects, the
district also is planning 140 to 160 additional schools needed to
achieve Romer's long-range goal of eliminating year-round schools.</TE>
<TE>   Those projects would require billions of dollars more. The
district has earmarked $1 billion from the November bond for future
projects, and expects about $650 million from the new state bond.</TE>
<TE>   District officials said they had not yet developed contingency
plans for the possible defeat of either or both bond measures.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many scenarios that it's kind of hard to figure,"
said Beth Hamby, director of grants and funding for facilities.</TE>
<TE>   In either case, the district or the state would put the measure on
the subsequent ballot, leaving open the possibility that the money
would come later.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever happens, efforts are proceeding on designs, environmental
studies and land acquisition for all 158 projects, using money
remaining from Proposition BB, the district's 1997 bond.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to be out of money and unable to go forward on
election day," Hamby said.</TE>
<TE>   The State Allocation Board's vote Wednesday brought to $693
million the total apportioned to the Los Angeles district from
Proposition 1A, the 1998 state bond.</TE>
<TE>   The path was a circuitous, however. The district soon fell behind
in planning the schools because of management lapses and the
difficulty of securing environmentally clean land in urban Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Other districts were rapidly exhausting the money when a group of
Los Angeles civil rights activists filed a lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   A judge ruled that the law required the State Allocation Board to
use a priority system ensuring the remaining $750 million went to
districts with the greatest need.</TE>
<TE>   Under formulas established to implement the ruling, Los Angeles
Unified would have qualified for every application it could prepare
by July.</TE>
<TE>   Though its critics scoffed at the idea the district could process
so many applications in time, it came through with applications for
$916 million, far more than the amount available.</TE>
<TE>   "This thing is like preparing for D-day," Romer said. "We've been
putting a lot of things in place to really do this construction
right, in large volume, on time. We now have the capacity to do it.
That's why this money from the state is very important."</TE>

<HD>Term Limits Hinder Legislative Diligence</HD>
<DH>Capitol: The session ends on a green note as lawmakers'
inexperience and special interest money color the results.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>In the building where the biggest issues facing California are
weighed, inexperience was evident, campaign money was ever-present
and decisions important and petty emerged from the chaos that marked
the close of the Legislature's two-year term.</LD>
<LD>   When all actions are tallied, the production of the session that
ended Sunday shortly past midnight likely will match that of recent
years. There were bills on vital issues ranging from school
construction and renewable energy to water delivery, recycling and
mass transit. But to Capitol veterans, the scene seemed haphazard,
rushed, increasingly partisan and perhaps overly influenced by
special interests.</LD>
<LD>   "Everybody here is on a learning curve," said Assemblyman Bill
Leonard (R-San Bernardino), serving out his 24th and final year in
the Legislature.</LD>
<TE>   Four years ago, lawmakers elected with Gov. Gray Davis reveled in
a $13-billion budget surplus. There was so much money that they were
able to expand health care for poor people, give public school
teachers big raises, provide college grants to all needy and
deserving high school graduates, rebuild aging freeways and cut
taxes.</TE>
<TE>   As Davis and most of the Legislature run for reelection, lawmakers
find themselves staggering, hit first by the energy crisis that
dominated 2001, then by the constraints of a record budget shortfall
this year of nearly $24 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "Liberals are frustrated. Conservatives are angry. Everybody is
cranky," said outgoing Assemblyman Kevin Shelley (D-San Francisco).</TE>
<TE>   In what many see as indicative of a new seat-of-the-pants
Legislature, lawmakers repeatedly bypassed the spirit if not the
letter of their internal rules. They convened perfunctory hearings on
significant policy matters late at night and performed a procedure
called "gut and amend," in which legislators hijack one another's
bills, remove the original content and substitute new language, often
dealing with entirely different subject matter.</TE>
<TE>   Late-night end-of-session deals have always been a part of
Sacramento. But the sheer number put together in the closing days
this year is evidence, some say, that the traditional legislative
process is simply too complex and laborious in a term-limited era.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, the procedure was used to insert language that had been
months in the works, as with SB 800, negotiated by Assemblyman
Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento). The bill forged a compromise
between builders and trial lawyers to establish new guidelines
governing lawsuits over construction defects. Steinberg hopes the
measure, once signed by Gov. Gray Davis, will help spur construction
of more affordable housing.</TE>
<TE>   At other times, majority Democrats invoked the legislative process
to jam bills past protesting Republicans, such as the Senate's
approval of a bill allowing the Davis administration to raise the
so-called car tax by as much as $3.9 billion without a vote of the
Legislature. That measure died as part of a budget compromise reached
late Saturday night, two months after the constitutional deadline for
having a spending plan in place.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem with the gut-and-amend process," said Sen. Steve
Peace (D-El Cajon), "is there's no public engagement between the
houses in which the public can observe what the differences are."
Peace is leaving the Legislature after 20 years because of term
limits.</TE>
<TE>   The solution could be as simple as a basic civics lesson. Perhaps,
Peace mused, lawmakers could buy placemats sold in the basement gift
shop that detail "how a bill becomes a law."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the real story of how a bill becomes a law is nuanced.</TE>
<TE>   Take, for example, SB 1078. It began as a minor measure by Sen.
Jim Battin (R-La Quinta) dealing with a few rural schools. It ended
up being an effort by Sen. Byron Sher (D-Stanford) to require that
private utilities obtain at least 20% of the electricity they sell
from wind, solar, geothermal or other renewable energy sources.</TE>
<TE>   The Assembly initially approved Sher's version of the bill Tuesday
night, then rescinded its action. Modesto-area lawmakers wanted to
amend it to ensure that it would cover a trash-burning power plant in
their hometown operated by Covanta Energy of New Jersey, even though
garbage combustion does not typically fall within the definition of
renewable energy. Once amended, the bill was sent on its way. Davis
has said he will sign the measure.</TE>
<TE>   Placemats sold in Capitol gift shops don't discuss the influence
of campaign donations. But legislators know that when candidates
raise and spend $3 million or more for a job that pays $99,000 a
year, campaign donations are vital.</TE>
<TE>   "People got involved in politics because they care," said Sen.
Ross Johnson (R-Irvine), first elected in 1978. "But they immediately
learn that caring isn't enough. Caring doesn't get [election] mailers
out, or produce a survey of voters."</TE>
<TE>   August is the month when the fate of hundreds of bills is decided.
It's also prime fund-raising time, especially in an election year.
Virtually every lawmaker seeking reelection--and some who have no
election or are prevented by term limits from running again--held
Capitol area fund-raisers, charging a minimum $1,000.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City) raised at least
$114,000 in August. Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San
Francisco) raised at least $80,000. No legislator came close to
matching the fund-raising prowess of Davis, who took in more than
$3.5 million in the first 29 days of the month.</TE>
<TE>   More than a few legislators, and many lobbyists, talk about
diminished ethical standards.</TE>
<TE>   "When I got here, it was distasteful," said Assemblyman Rod
Pacheco (R-Riverside), a former Riverside County deputy district
attorney who is leaving after serving his maximum six years in the
lower house. "Now it is fetid."</TE>
<TE>   Leonard tells of hearing newer members joke about how taking a
particular position might alienate one political action committee or
another. He tells of having to cut off discussion by clumsy interest
group representatives who tie policy positions to campaign donations.</TE>
<TE>   "People are new and lines get pushed more," said Assemblyman Dean
Florez (D-Shafter). "The boundaries seem to stretch."</TE>
<TE>   Florez presided over more than 100 hours of early summer hearings
into the Davis administration's failed $95-million computer software
contract with Oracle Corp.--capped by a revelation that shortly after
the deal was consummated, an Oracle lobbyist handed a $25,000 check
to a Davis aide who worked on the matter.</TE>
<TE>   The most significant piece of legislation to emerge from those
hearings was a bill requiring that sales representatives of private
vendors doing business with the state disclose details of their
activities in public reports, much as lobbyists have done for
decades. The bill died without a hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Campaign donors don't always win. Burton started out the final day
of the session by proclaiming that the entertainment industry, which
has been a generous donor to his and many other California
politicians' campaigns, was too arrogant in its demand for an
$80-million tax break.</TE>
<TE>   "The sponsors keep coming up like they are entitled to something
instead of asking for something," Burton bellowed. "You're going to
take what we give you." Which on this day was nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Big-time financial industry lobbyists fared better. For the second
year running, they persuaded moderate Assembly Democrats to side with
Republicans and kill legislation by Sen. Jackie Speier
(D-Hillsborough) that would have granted Californians greater privacy
over their financial affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Deriding the lower house as "Romper Room," Speier scoffed at
last-minute maneuvers in which the bill's foes tried to hijack her
legislation, water it down, then vote for it, hoping to convince
voters that they supported greater privacy rights. The issue will
live on.</TE>
<TE>   A select few lobbying groups consistently seem to win when it
counts.</TE>
<TE>   The Assembly took time out to offer a fawning tribute and
resolution to perhaps the most powerful nonelected person in
Sacramento, Don Novey. Novey is outgoing president of the California
Correctional Peace Officers Assn., a 26,000-member union and one of
the biggest campaign donors in California.</TE>
<TE>   In its first bill of the year, the Legislature in January approved
with only one no vote and Davis signed into law the guards' new labor
pact, which granted them a pay increase of as much as 37% spread over
the next five years. On the last day of the legislative session, a
Senate resolution extending the life of a legislative committee that
holds oversight hearings into the California Department of
Corrections died in the Assembly, without notice or debate.</TE>

<HD>Witness Mistakes Costly for Accused</HD>
<DH>Law: Inconsistencies in victim's statements don't prevent
the lengthy jailing of man.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an era when death row inmates are being exonerated by DNA
evidence, the 89 days Louie Gomez spent in County Jail for a crime he
did not commit may not sound like much.</LD>
<LD>   It took the justice system that long to recognize troubling
inconsistencies in the robbery case against Gomez, and for the
victim's identification of him to fall apart, costing the Los Angeles
man two jobs and three months of his life.</LD>
<LD>   "I told them, 'I'm not a thief.' They didn't believe me," Gomez
said. "They were wrong, but as long as the lady said it was me,
that's all it took."</LD>
<TE>   The case, which ended in Gomez's exoneration on Aug. 8,
illustrates how vulnerable people can be to mistaken identification
by witnesses. Misidentification is the leading cause of wrongful
convictions, said UC Irvine professor Elizabeth Loftus, who has
researched the topic extensively.</TE>
<TE>   Of 110 people nationwide exonerated by post-conviction DNA
testing, about three-fourths were wrongfully convicted due to witness
misidentification, Iowa State University professor Gary Wells said.
Yet the system continues to rely on eyewitness testimony, which is
often flawed because the memory is unpredictable.</TE>
<TE>   "While these DNA exoneration cases have gotten strong attention
focused on the problem of human memory, we still have a ways to go,"
Loftus said.</TE>
<TE>   The risk of misidentification increases if the suspect is a
different race from the victim, if the witness is under stress or if
the upper part of the face is concealed. And as soon as a
misidentification is made, it tends to stick, Wells said. "It becomes
the memory," he said. "And there's nothing that can really reverse it
in their mind."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Lilia Javier says she still believes it was Gomez who
pushed something sharp against her ribs April 8 in a grocery store
parking lot on Huntington Drive in Los Angeles. Javier said she is
upset that Gomez was declared innocent and released from jail. "But
what can I do? Nothing."</TE>
<TE>   The night of the robbery, Javier told police that she was tying
her daughter's shoes when a man said, "Don't talk," grabbed her purse
and ran away. She yelled for help, and a security guard called
police. While Javier waited, Gomez walked by, heading to a nearby
house where he worked caring for an elderly woman. Javier said he was
the thief, and her brother grabbed him, according to the police
report.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Police Department Officers Sean Dempsey and Edward
Rubio arrived. The radio call had described the robber as a Latino,
25 to 30 years old, with a mustache and a thin build and wearing a
black jacket. Gomez was 44, had a mustache, weighed 165 pounds, and
was wearing a blue jacket.</TE>
<TE>   Javier told police that Gomez was the one who stole her purse,
which had $150 in cash and her driver's license. Another witness told
the officers that she did not get a good look at the suspect, but
that Gomez matched her description of the man she saw run away, the
report said. Gomez had only 30 cents in his pockets. Police could not
find the purse, despite a search.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't confident either way," Dempsey said. "I felt like there
was a possibility it was him, but I didn't know for sure."</TE>
<TE>   At the station, Gomez told police he had just taken a break from
work to buy a can of beer at a nearby liquor store. He was adamant
about his innocence. Police arrested him.</TE>
<TE>   Dempsey later said he noticed that Gomez walked with a limp, even
though Javier said the robber ran from the scene. He also said later
he was struck by the fact that Gomez did not flee, as most street
robbers do, but was spotted as he walked by the scene of the crime.
Neither of those observations were in the police report.</TE>
<TE>   Before deciding to book Gomez, the watch commander called up the
suspect's criminal record, discovering three old misdemeanor
convictions on drug charges and a burglary arrest from 1975.</TE>
<TE>   The conclusion that Gomez was the right suspect was confirmed by
prosecutors, who filed charges. Bail was set at $35,000, far beyond
Gomez's means. "I couldn't believe it," Gomez said later. "I was
shocked, and I was mad."</TE>
<TE>   Gomez said he kept thinking police would realize they were
mistaken and would let him go. Before his arrest, Gomez had been
living with his 73-year-old mother and paying the bulk of the rent on
their Los Angeles house. He was earning about $1,570 per month at his
two county jobs, as a truck driver and a caretaker, and had received
a paycheck the day of his arrest, according to court files.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge George G. Lomeli presided
over the Gomez preliminary hearing on April 22. The only witness to
testify was Javier, who said that she saw the upper half of the
suspect's face, including the nose, eyes and forehead. When she was
asked to identify the robber, Javier pointed to Gomez. Based on
Javier's testimony, Judge Lomeli ruled that there was enough evidence
for Gomez to go to trial.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after the court hearing, Gomez rejected a deal offered by
prosecutors of six months in jail, rather than the five-year prison
term he was facing if convicted. "That would be like admitting I was
guilty," Gomez said. "I was innocent."</TE>
<TE>   Gomez's lawyer, Deputy Public Defender John Alan, wrote a memo to
prosecutors arguing that it was a case of mistaken identity. In his
memo, he asked the district attorney's office to reevaluate the case
and release his client on his own recognizance.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe a strong argument can be made for your office not
pursuing this case to trial," he wrote. Alan noted that Gomez did not
have the victim's purse, that he was employed, that he readily agreed
to wait for police and that the suspect only saw part of his face.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Patricia Redifer said that
when she read the memo, she called the investigating officer and
reexamined the booking photograph to see if Gomez had a distinctive
appearance. Redifer said she had questions, but did not have time to
sit down with the witnesses because of her heavy caseload.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is scheduling," she said. "There are just so many
hours in the day that I can spend doing things like additional
investigation." She concluded Gomez was probably guilty. After all,
the victim identified him twice. "This sort of thing haunts me,"
Redifer said, stressing that she was not speaking on behalf of the
office. "I empathize with Mr. Gomez, and I regret it deeply that I
did not have the information to free him." Deputy Dist. Atty. Dmitry
Brodsky saw Alan's memo when the case was assigned to him for trial.
Primarily based on Alan's memo, Brodsky offered to dismiss the
charges if Gomez passed a polygraph test. On the advice of his
attorney, Gomez said he declined because Alan could not be present
during the test and prosecutors would not agree to an examiner
outside of LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   Brodsky interviewed Javier on July 5, on the day of trial. She
told him that she "was not 100% sure" that Gomez was the robber,
according to court papers. Javier acknowledged that when Gomez took
his hat off, he looked too old. And contradicting her testimony at
the preliminary hearing, Javier said she only saw the suspect's face
from his chin to his nose, and did not see his eyes. She told Brodsky
that the mustache was the only particular thing about the suspect's
face.</TE>
<TE>   That same day, Dempsey, the arresting officer, shared his thoughts
with Brodsky about how unusual it was for Gomez to have returned to
the scene of the crime and to not have run away before police
arrived. He also mentioned his earlier observation about Gomez's
limp. Brodsky checked with a court clerk who confirmed that Gomez
walked with a limp.</TE>
<TE>   Brodsky said he made up his mind to dismiss the case, and Gomez
was freed that day.</TE>
<TE>   "Based on the fact that I had reasonable doubt, I certainly did
not want to proceed with the case," he said. "My job is to do what's
just. It's better to release 100 guilty than to convict one
innocent."</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 8, four months after Gomez was arrested, Superior Court
Judge Rand Rubin granted the defense's motion to declare him
factually innocent.</TE>
<TE>   Gomez said the time in jail was terrible. He knew his family did
not have the money to get him out on bail, so he just stayed in his
cell, kept to himself and prayed. He missed scheduled surgeries for a
heel spur and a hernia, and it took him two months just to see a jail
doctor. "It's awful, compared to the way we live," he said. "It
changed my life."</TE>
<TE>   Gomez lost both his jobs when he was in jail, and he has not been
able to find a new job since being released. He has applied for
public assistance to help his mother, who relied on her other
children while he was behind bars. But Gomez said he does not fault
Javier. "She wasn't lying, she just thought it was me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Head Deputy Dist. Atty. Lauren Weis said there is no excuse for
what happened to Gomez. "I can only tell you that our lawyers are
extremely overworked," she said. "Sometimes things slip through the
cracks."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Dempsey still isn't sure of Gomez's innocence or
guilt. "He got his day in court, and he was cleared," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Alan sees it differently.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm mad at the police for not having enough sense to believe that
this guy might be innocent and instead operating on auto pilot ...
and the district attorney's office for ignoring my memorandum," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Fans Go to Bat for State Control of Baseball</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATT MORRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sure, they're not striking this time. But what about the next time
big league baseball goes into a strike snit?</LD>
<LD>   A quartet of California baseball fans--some love the Mets, some
love the Dodgers--think they have the answer. They've begun the
process toward circulating a statewide initiative for the state to
buy all five California pro baseball teams and have them run by a
state Department of Baseball. And they're hoping every other pro
baseball state will follow suit.</LD>
<LD>   ASAP, the Assn. to Save the American Pastime, wants the state to
authorize issuing $2 billion in general obligation bonds to "take
control, including ... through eminent domain, of the five Major
League Baseball teams located in the state of California ... and
operate and manage such teams."</LD>
<TE>   Which means every Californian would own a piece of the Padres,
Angels, Dodgers, A's and Giants.</TE>
<TE>   The group's leader, Nick Morosoff, who came west from New York 10
years ago, said ASAP is a foursome of baseball fans frustrated with
the dysfunction of the nation's game.</TE>
<TE>   "We firmly believe certain goods and services are so dear to the
people that responsible government should be responsible if the
private sector displays itself unable to offer [those services] in
such a manner that they be continuously available; then it's the
government's responsibility to step in and operate the system
itself."</TE>
<TE>   If you hadn't guessed by now, Morosoff is a lawyer, and he and his
friends came up with the idea after some heated baseball discussion
over beers--or maybe they were gin and tonics.</TE>
<TE>   The parallel he draws is to parks: "If we wouldn't let labor
disputes shut down Yosemite, we shouldn't let labor disputes shut
down Fenway Park or Dodger Stadium."</TE>
<TE>   The state has about a month to analyze the lengthy and
legalistically detailed ballot proposal before Morosoff and his pals
can begin collecting the 490,000 signatures they'd need to get this
on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   And as angry as fans are, Morosoff thinks the eminent-domain
estimate for all five teams might go as low as $1.25 billion total.
"Part of the owners' strategy is, 'Oh, we're so poor,' " he says.
"What's fair value for a team losing money?"</TE>
<TE>   Bush Had On His West Coast Face</TE>
<TE>   When political reporters recently made much of the fact that
President Bush had not mentioned struggling GOP gubernatorial
candidate Bill Simon Jr. in two public appearances in California--but
had touted California Republican Reps. Richard Pombo and Doug
Ose--White House political operative Karl Rove insisted by way of
explanation that it's because Bush draws a "bright line" between
campaign events and official ones. Simon aides said it's because
Pombo and Ose are incumbents.</TE>
<TE>   But an Associated Press search of White House archives showed that
... well, maybe it's a West Coast thing. At three
government-sponsored appearances in North Carolina between Jan. 30
and July 25, Bush had warm words onstage for Senate candidate
Elizabeth Dole who, like Simon, is a wannabe but not yet an
office-holder.</TE>
<TE>   Apropos of Bush's California hopscotch, the Stockton Record
reported that the city spent a hefty bit of change sprucing up for
the First Visitor, the first president to come to Stockton in half a
century: roughly $10,000 for planting flowers, painting railings and
tidying up the Civic Auditorium, on top of the cost of extra police
and overtime, Secret Service requests for carpeted walkways, a
temporary lounge with couch and cable TV, and extra phone lines.</TE>
<TE>   While Bush was in Stockton, he sang the praises of his agriculture
secretary, and the San Francisco Chronicle said Bush declared, "It
made sense to find someone from this part of the world ... so I
picked a lady from Compton, Calif.--Ann Veneman."</TE>
<TE>   Veneman grew up on a Ceres peach farm; Compton's most lucrative
crop has been rap.</TE>
<TE>   Burton Hurtin' Without His Mojo</TE>
<TE>   California Senate leader John Burton is losing his Mojo.</TE>
<TE>   Not the preternatural lost-and-found mojo powers of Powers, comma,
Austin, as in the film, but rather his good Republican right arm,
Redding state Sen. Maurice Johannessen.</TE>
<TE>   Johannessen's nickname is Mojo--Mo for Maurice, jo for
Johannessen. Got it? But Mojo will have to go-go, forced out this
year by term limits. Johannessen has given the liberal Burton a vital
vote to pass a state budget these two years past, making both men the
subject of many "Mojo" jests.</TE>
<TE>   This, of course, has not gone down well with Johannessen's
conservative colleagues, who booted him out of their club (the Senate
Republican caucus) and stripped off his virtual epaulets.
(Johannessen, who insisted he had his party leaders' blessing,
responded to the schoolyard tactic with a schoolyard response:
"Nah-nah nah-nah nah-nah."</TE>
<TE>   This probably won't happen next year when Grass Valley Republican
Assemblyman Sam Aanestad is expected to succeed Johannessen.
Aanestad's stuck to the party line like flypaper, leaving people
wondering what Burton will do for support on his right flank.</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * It's almost always dangerous to label anything the first, the
biggest, the best and the like, so take this as a challenge rather
than as a fact: Democrat Gerrie Schipske, running in the 46th
Congressional District against Republican incumbent Dana Rohrabacher,
says her campaign has politics' oldest volunteer: 94-year-old Ruth
Darling, who was born well before women got the vote, and who cast
her first presidential ballot for Franklin D. Roosevelt when he ran
against incumbent President Herbert Hoover in 1932. Can anyone top
that?</TE>
<TE>   * A series of e-mails titled "Reasons to Secede From Los Angeles"
lists among its complaints Reason No. 9, that at a hearing of a Los
Angeles City Council planning and land-use committee, a board member
of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. was treated in a "rude, insolent
and brusque manner." Fair enough, but what does this have to do with
secession? Doesn't everybody get treated in that fashion by the
bureaucracy, regardless of ZIP code?</TE>
<TE>   * They're nonpartisan races, but that's not stopping the Orange
County Republican Party: In a total of six nonpartisan elections
around the county, it is endorsing the candidates who are registered
Republicans: for Irvine mayor and two City Council races; two Garden
Grove City Council seats; and a Superior Court judgeship.</TE>
<TE>   * Right county, wrong lawyer: It isn't Sacramento County's D.A.
who's endorsing Gray Davis, as this space noted last week, but a
Sacramento County deputy D.A. who's endorsing the governor. The D.A.
herself, Jan Scully, is a Bill Simon supporter.</TE>
<TE>   * What a difference a few months make: In the March primary for
Orange County clerk-recorder, Irvine attorney Bruce Peotter's ballot
designation was "corporate clerk." Now, after fighting with officials
over trying to make himself a "corporate clerk-recorder" on the
November ballot, he's settled for "recording documents executive."
His opponent, Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly, is a "mayor/businessman."</TE>
<TE>   You Can Quote Me</TE>
<TE>   "If you put this in Judeo-Christian terms, we would have to
preserve every site where anyone ever prayed."</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Republican Assemblyman John Campbell, objecting to a
measure approved by his colleagues that would give California's
Native Americans a chance to protect their sacred sites.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Separated at birth, yet again: White House Press Secretary Ari
Fleischer, left, and Rich Perelman, left in photo at right. Perelman
was one of the people behind an unsuccessful bid to get the Summer
Olympics back in Los Angeles in 2012. Fleischer hopes to help his
boss, President Bush, land another four years in Washington.</TE>

<HD>Program Gives Writers a Professional Polish</HD>
<DH>Education: Already selective to a rare degree, the classes
at UC Irvine will get more so with new novels by graduates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The Lovely Bones" by Alice Sebold has sat atop the bestseller lists
for weeks, a rare literary novel that is a hit with the masses.</LD>
<LD>   Glen David Gold received a $700,000 advance for his novel "Carter
Beats the Devil," and it was optioned this year by Tom Cruise's
production company for $200,000.</LD>
<LD>   Maile Meloy's short-story collection, "Half in Love," was the
featured review in the New York Times Book Review, a distinction in
itself.</LD>
<TE>   What these authors have in common is that they are recent products
of UC Irvine's graduate program in creative writing. Long considered
one of the best writing programs in the country, its graduates have
had a string of successes that has brought the program to even
greater prominence.</TE>
<TE>   UC Irvine's reputation is expected to be enhanced further when
Pulitzer Prize-winner Michael Chabon, one of the program's best-known
graduates, comes out with his children's novel "Summerland" next
month. Then, around Christmas, comes the release of the Spike
Lee-directed film "The 25th Hour," based on the novel of the same
name by UC Irvine writing grad David Benioff, who also wrote the
screenplay.</TE>
<TE>   Applications to the class entering this month were up 43%, and
that was before the recent flood of successes. "I'm sort of
shuddering in my boots about what will happen next year," said
Michelle Latiolais, co-director of the program.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the sudden boost, it was nearly impossible to get one
of the six slots that open each year in the two-year master's of fine
arts program. Last year, 327 people competed for the six openings,
meaning only 1.8% were admitted.</TE>
<TE>   Those numbers make it more difficult to get into than Harvard's
law or medical school, people close to the program like to say. It is
nearly twice as hard to get into UC Irvine's program than the
nation's oldest and best-regarded creative-writing program, the Iowa
Writer's Workshop at the University of Iowa, which annually enrolls
25.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last seven years, only two admitted to UC Irvine's
graduate writing course decided to go elsewhere, said novelist
Geoffrey Wolff, who heads the program.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think a credit from there guarantees anything, but
certainly if I see the name 'Irvine' on a submission letter, it gets
my attention," said New York literary agent Henry Dunow, who
represents Sebold and fellow UC Irvine grad Aimee Bender.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the best known writer to come out of UC Irvine is Richard
Ford, class of 1970, who received a 1996 Pulitzer Prize for his novel
"Independence Day," the second half of a saga that started with "The
Sportswriter."</TE>
<TE>   But it was Chabon who brought the program national attention. "We
owe him," said Oakley Hall, co-director of the program for 21 years.
When Hall retired in 1990, Thomas Keneally, the Australian author of
"Schindler's List," took over the program.</TE>
<TE>   UC Irvine students write a novel or short-story collection for
their master's thesis, and often, these turn into books. The story of
Chabon, a 1987 graduate, though, is legendary. He gave his thesis to
his professor, who sent it to an agent in New York without telling
Chabon. Publisher William Morrow paid Chabon a $155,0000 advance for
"The Mysteries of Pittsburgh" at a time when first novelists were
lucky to receive $7,500. Chabon has gone on to write "Wonder Boys"
and won a Pulitzer for "The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay."</TE>
<TE>   As word of Chabon's deal spread, applications to the program
doubled. "It caused a lot of New York interest for people in our
program," Hall said. "A lot of people got published on his
shirttails. In their crass way, [publishers and agents] were looking
for another Michael."</TE>
<TE>   UC Irvine writers like Louis B. Jones and Jay Gummerman developed
strong literary reputations, and other alums' books crowded into
bookstores and received promising reviews. Some landed on bestseller
lists, such as Whitney Otto's "How to Make an American Quilt" and
Aimee Bender's "An Invisible Sign of My Own" and "Girl in the
Flammable Skirt."</TE>
<TE>   But in the last year or so, UC Irvine writers began hitting the
bestseller lists regularly and gaining attention, starting with
Gold's "Carter Beats the Devil." Charmaine Craig's "The Good Men"
crept onto the list, and so did "The Color Midnight Made," by Andrew
Winer. Phil Hay wrote the screenplays for "crazy/beautiful," which
starred Kirsten Dunst, and "The Tuxedo," starring Jackie Chan,
scheduled for release this fall.</TE>
<TE>   Along came Benioff, selling his novel to Lee. Much to his
surprise, because he hadn't planned on writing for movies, he has
sold four screenplays for millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   But in terms of combined literary and commercial success, the
topper has been Sebold, whose book has been the surprise publishing
success of the summer.</TE>
<TE>   However, anyone who becomes a writer to get rich has been reading
too much science fiction.</TE>
<TE>   "My own feeling is: If your highest aspiration is to be on the
bestseller list or earn a large chunk of change, you're not going to
go to a [graduate creative-writing] program," said Nicholas Delbanco,
director of the graduate program in creative writing at the
University of Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the spike in applications at UC Irvine hasn't increased
the quality of the pool, Wolff and Latiolais agreed.</TE>
<TE>   But exposure to its graduates' books has brought talented writers
to UC Irvine. "Michael Chabon is the reason I went to UCI," Benioff
said. "I was living in Wyoming before I went to grad school. I loved
'The Mysteries of Pittsburgh.' The back of the book said he went to
UCI. I had literally never heard of Irvine."</TE>
<TE>   Finding out that the man in charge of the program was Wolff,
author of the "Duke of Deception," the memoir of his con man father,
only gave him greater encouragement to apply.</TE>
<TE>   All 12 students in the program receive about $1,200 a month and
teach undergraduate composition, which allows them to spend time
doing what writers do. They are accepted on the basis of a work of
fiction they have submitted, and that they have been out of school,
trying to make it as writers.</TE>
<TE>   The centerpiece of the program is the weekly three-hour workshop
where students' work is evaluated by professors and the 11 others in
the program.</TE>
<TE>   'Writing Comes First'</TE>
<TE>   Sebold, at first put on UC Irvine's wait list, had written two
unpublished novels when she came to Irvine. She found its program
like being in a writers colony. "To be in atmosphere where writing
comes first, it reinvigorated me. It was a lovely, false world to
live in for a few years."</TE>
<TE>   The subject that is not discussed during the program is the
business end of publishing. "We have connections for them when
they're ready," said Latiolais, a novelist and graduate of the
program. "But the thing that is going to make the boat float is the
writing, not the connections." All this success might make people
think that somehow there is a formula to success that UC Irvine has
discovered. That's not true, those who have gone through it insist.</TE>
<TE>   "Go to the library and ask where [creative-writing] dissertations
are," Gold said. "You will find more names you don't recognize than
you thought imaginable. These were good students, who did good work.
It doesn't mean you've heard of them. It's a pathway and it's had
increased success lately, but it's not a magic pill."</TE>

<HD>Housing a Growing Concern</HD>
<DH>Ventura County: As the percentage of people able to afford
a home shrinks, planners seek solutions. A conference on the issue is
scheduled for Sept. 13.</DH>

<LD>When nearly 150 families showed up at a July meeting to vie for one
of two Habitat for Humanity homes being built in Oxnard, Annette
Hauchin saw firsthand how desperately the county needs more
affordable housing.</LD>
<LD>   The executive director of the local Habitat for Humanity chapter
said she has seen the number of people seeking assistance double in
the last two years, as housing prices have soared.</LD>
<LD>   In July, the median price of a Ventura County home was $331,000,
while the median household income for fiscal 2001-2002 was $74,700,
according to statistics from the UC Santa Barbara Economic Forecast
Project and DataQuick Information Services, which monitors completed
home sales.</LD>
<TE>   In June, statistics showed that 33% of county residents can afford
to buy a home.</TE>
<TE>   While that's higher than neighboring counties such as Santa
Barbara, where the housing affordability rate dips to 18%, it is
significantly lower than the national average of 55%, according to
UCSB economic analysts.</TE>
<TE>   Frustrated by the county's low housing affordability rates and
what they call an ongoing regional housing crisis, three private
nonprofit developers plan to hold a daylong conference Sept. 13 to
address the problem.</TE>
<TE>   Cabrillo Economic Development Corp., Housing Opportunities Made
Easier and the Ventura County Economic Development Assn. will jointly
host the event, which will be held at the Clarion Hotel in Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   Conference organizers plan to press community leaders and interest
groups to find solutions to the housing crunch.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a growing recognition of the severity of the regional
housing crisis," said conference coordinator Jennifer McGovern. "And
we hope to raise public awareness while there's still time to do
something."</TE>
<TE>   When Ventura County voters passed strict slow-growth provisions in
1998, requiring a majority of voters to approve any new development
of open spaces between cities, some opponents of the law predicted
that it could contribute to the region's housing crisis by limiting
the availability of land on which affordable housing could be built.</TE>
<TE>   But Rodney Fernandez, executive director of the Cabrillo Economic
Development Corp., said the SOAR law just means that cities need to
explore new strategies to solve the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "SOAR keeps getting a bad name, but I don't think that's fair,"
Fernandez said. "To me, the real challenge is providing a better mix
of housing. SOAR says build within the boundaries, and the housing
being built doesn't meet people's needs. Part of the challenge is to
get different interest groups to roll up their sleeves and figure out
how to make this work."</TE>

<TE>   Some of the proposed strategies, such as building higher-density
and mixed-use projects as well as redeveloping abandoned properties
into affordable housing, already have been used in the county.
Habitat for Humanity, for example, recently converted an abandoned
senior living center in Thousand Oaks into a four-bedroom,
single-family home.</TE>
<TE>   Such redevelopment is probably one of the easiest ways to get more
affordable housing while limiting urban sprawl, said Dan Hamilton,
director of economics at the UCSB Economic Forecast Project.</TE>
<TE>   McGovern said one of the conference's four workshops will focus on
such "smart" land-use planning principles as allowing for higher
density and mixed-use developments. Another workshop will discuss new
financing tools, such as housing trust funds or the combination of
employer down-payment assistance programs with secondary loans from
local governments.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers said they hope to turn the housing conference, the
first one in the region, into an annual event.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's enough examples in other communities where this
has been done well, and we need to avail ourselves of those
examples," Fernandez said. "The key is to have the right people
around the table."</TE>
<TE>   More than 10,000 invitations were sent to people in the community,
he said. About 150 people have signed up, and Fernandez said
organizers hope to get at least 300 to attend.</TE>
<TE>   The conference costs $95 per person for those who register before
Tuesday, or $115 after. For more information, call Cabrillo Economic
Development Corp. at 659-3791.</TE>

<HD>Farmers Hope Working With Kids Bears Fruit</HD>
<DH>Food: To help keep Ventura County's agricultural tradition
alive, growers are reaching out to interest new generations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although she is new to farming, Ojai apple grower Esther Wachtell
wanted her grandkids to know something about the traditions of
Ventura County agriculture and the workings of the harvest.</LD>
<LD>   So, as creator of Eve's Apples, she supplied a little temptation.</LD>
<LD>   Money. Five dollars an hour, to be exact.</LD>
<TE>   With that, she put five of her grade-school-age grandchildren to
work last month sorting, sizing and shipping the Crimson Galas that
sprout every summer in a 10-acre orchard at her Oak Knoll Ranch.</TE>
<TE>   "I certainly would like them to understand the opportunities
[provided by] farming," said Wachtell, who with her husband, Tom,
gave up city life in Los Angeles seven years ago for ranch life in
the bucolic Ojai Valley. "And I hope they will cherish that, protect
it and take care of it."</TE>
<TE>   She is not alone. On the farm and in schools, a growing number of
Ventura County youngsters are the focus of efforts to demonstrate the
significance and value of the county's oldest and most prominent
industry.</TE>
<TE>   Those efforts mirror state and national trends that show a growing
interest at high school and community colleges in agriculture, a
movement that experts say is fueled by new technology in the
industry.</TE>
<TE>   Locally, those efforts include an educational campaign by the
Hansen Trust--which helps support and sustain local agriculture--to
get young people to understand the importance of farming so that as
voting-age adults they can help ensure that it continues to hold its
own against suburban sprawl.</TE>
<TE>   At its historic Santa Paula farm, the trust hosts teacher
workshops, student career days and a hands-on learning center
designed to let youngsters know where their food comes from and how
vital agriculture is to the local economy.</TE>
<TE>   On a more intimate level, family farmers such as Wachtell are
handing down their own lessons of the harvest, often as a way of
priming younger generations to become involved in the family business
so they can take over when the time is right.</TE>
<TE>   Wachtell said that is not necessarily her goal. But she said she
wouldn't mind if one or more of her grandchildren decided to follow
in her footsteps.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, I've put so much of myself into this place, I'd
like to keep it in the family," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Keeping the farm in the family can be a tricky proposition,
however.</TE>
<TE>   California FarmLink, a Sonoma-area nonprofit dedicated to
preserving family farming, said many growers lack information about
how to keep their land in agricultural production while planning for
retirement.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the challenges facing family farmers as they
attempt to transfer land and business operations from one generation
to the next.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Schwartz, FarmLink's executive director, said those issues
have become more pressing as California's farmers, on average, get
older and it becomes increasingly difficult for young farmers to
break into the business.</TE>
<TE>   His group holds workshops throughout the state to provide
information and technical assistance to those who want help planning
for the transition.</TE>
<TE>   "You have a lot of families out there saying, 'Who is going to
take over the farm?' " Schwartz said. "The message we try to get
across is that succession planning for family farmers is something
that needs to start early."</TE>
<TE>   It is a lesson Leavens Ranches has taken to heart.</TE>
<TE>   That's why the prominent Ventura County family that owns the
business launched "Camp Mary" a few years ago. It's a summertime
effort to educate the youngest generation about farming, family
history and the business workings at the lemon and avocado ranch.</TE>
<TE>   The first program, named after one of the senior family members,
was held two years ago. The second was held in July, when more than a
dozen Leavens offspring descended on the family farm near Santa Paula
for a two-day primer.</TE>
<TE>   The youngsters learned to identify pests and how they affect
fruit. They explored the intricacies of fruit DNA and toured
packinghouses. They were even tested on the material, just to make
sure they were paying attention.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt they ought to know what the farm is really about, how it
works," said Carolyn Leavens, who along with other senior family
members brought the idea to life.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to stay in agriculture, and they'll be the ones making
the decisions before too long," she said. "If we don't educate the
next generation, they're going to get bored and lose interest. And
the upshot is, they not only lose interest, they lose the farm."</TE>
<TE>   At the Oak Knoll Ranch, the lessons aren't quite so structured.</TE>
<TE>   But on the opening day of the apple harvest, grandsons Jake
Schine, 10, and Bradley Schine, 8, were learning plenty just the
same. The boys are from Los Angeles. Jake is the veteran of the
bunch, having been the first of Wachtell's grandchildren to man the
apple operation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lot of fun," said the fifth-grader, washing apples and
placing them on a conveyor belt that takes them to be polished and
sorted by size. "I like the feeling of being here and helping. It
doesn't feel like work, not when you're having fun."</TE>
<TE>   This summer's harvest drew the 9-year-old grandson of one of
Wachtell's neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   It even attracted the two sons of one of Wachtell's distributors,
Camarillo entrepreneur Mark Monro, who runs a company called Fresh
Success.</TE>
<TE>   "I want them to learn where their food comes from and to
experience working at an early age, to see what it's like," said
Monro, watching his boys, Spencer, 12, and Brennan, 10, on the
assembly line. "I can't think of a better setting for them to start."</TE>
<TE>   For Wachtell, the lessons go beyond wanting her grandchildren to
know where their food comes from.</TE>
<TE>   She wants to instill lessons in how to live healthy lives and
cultivate food in environmentally responsible ways. She wants them to
have an appreciation for the natural process of food production and
for all the people involved in delivering crops from the fields to
the dinner table.</TE>
<TE>   And she wants them to know all of this even if they have no
desire, when they grow up, to work the family farm.</TE>
<TE>   "They will definitely have memories," Wachtell said. "I think that
as grandparents, our real job is to enrich our grandchildren with
this whole panorama of memories that they will be able to draw on the
rest of their lives."</TE>

<HD>Campers Flee Fire in Azusa Canyon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fire forced about 8,000 campers to evacuate the Angeles National
Forest on Sunday as flames consumed more than 10,000 acres of craggy,
scrub-rich terrain in Azusa Canyon.</LD>
<LD>   The blaze began at about 12:35 p.m., leapfrogging across
California 39 north of East Fork Road. Speeding north, the so-called
Curve fire burned around, not through, the Crystal Lake recreation
area, its visitors center, store and other structures spared.</LD>
<LD>   No injuries were reported, but U.S. Forest Service officials said
one of its abandoned cabins and another unidentified building were
burned.</LD>
<TE>   The fire's pace slowed slightly by nightfall, but agency officials
said that erratic winds had kept firefighters from containing it and
that it could reach big-horned sheep habitat if it continued.</TE>
<TE>   Forest Service officials have not pinpointed the blaze's cause,
but they said hot weather and dry conditions primed the region for
such an incident.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really cooking out there," spokeswoman Susie Wood said.</TE>
<TE>   Forest Service officials in the San Bernardino National Forest,
where a blaze has burned since Thursday in Lytle Creek Canyon near
Wrightwood, spent most of Sunday fielding calls from locals who
mistook smoke from Los Angeles County for more trouble nearby.</TE>
<TE>   "You could judge how far the smoke had traveled by the location of
the calls," Forest Service spokeswoman Karen McKinley said. "When
fires move and eat up that much acreage that quickly, you know you've
got a situation."</TE>
<TE>   The Lytle fire was 61% contained by Sunday evening and the Forest
Service expects to have it fully contained on Friday, McKinley said.
But even at reduced strength, it still threatens the Cucamonga and
Sheep mountain wilderness areas and spotted owl habitat, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department is still working to
identify a burned body discovered in the fire. Officials have
concluded that incendiary materials found separate from the body are
probably the remains of a portable methamphetamine lab, but have not
determined whether they contributed to the fire.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters' progress on the Lytle blaze was delayed somewhat to
accommodate the police investigation, McKinley said.</TE>
<TE>   In a third patch of Southern California, a fire charred 30 acres
of dry scrub in Castaic, but no homes were threatened. The blaze was
30% contained by Sunday evening.</TE>
<TE>   Two hundred firefighters responded to the fire, which started near
the Golden State Freeway and Lake Hughes Road, said Supervisor Gary
Wise of the Los Angeles County Fire Department.</TE>

<HD>Canine Greeting Turns Bears Away</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: Trained dogs are used at a private camp to drive
the larger creatures from human habitat and safely back into the
forest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORAH SULLIVAN BRENNAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>FOREST FALLS, Calif.</DL>
<LD>The team of dogs yapped and barked, straining at their leashes as
they clambered toward the dining hall at Forest Home camp, tucked in
a wooded canyon in the San Bernardino Mountains. A chewed up soda cup
offered a sign of their quarry: a black bear, following the scent of
food.</LD>
<LD>   The Karelian bear dogs and their handlers with the Utah-based Wind
River Bear Institute were guiding camp officials through an exercise
in bear shepherding, a method of rousting bears from human habitat
and back into the wild.</LD>
<LD>   The strategy is designed to protect campers from the animals, and
to protect the animals from their own bad habits of food thieving and
dumpster diving, which can lead to death. "Tuffy, you got anything?
Fancy, you got anything?" Wind River's director, biologist Carrie
Hunt, called to the five surging dogs. But their howls died down,
signaling a cold trail.</LD>
<TE>   Hours into their rounds, it was the first night in a week that the
pack had turned up no ursine intruders. Yet the failure to spot a
bear may have suggested the success of the patrols. The bears may be
learning they're not welcome at the Christian camp, which has
operated for more than 60 years in Forest Falls at the base of the
San Bernardino Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   "We teach the bears that if they're in a developed site, they're
going to be asked to leave," Hunt said. "And if they leave, all goes
well. And if not, we're going to be barking and yelling ... at them."</TE>
<TE>   Bears have been ubiquitous visitors to Forest Falls for years, but
officials say they've been even bolder this summer in their forays
into the community, which sits on a road to Big Bear Lake.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been more bears, and they've been much more
aggressive," said Eric Sweetman, a fire prevention officer for the
U.S. Forest Service. "They've been more apt to ignore people to get
the food they need to get. And they're starting to break into autos
now."</TE>
<TE>   One plucked a cake off a picnic table at the Big Falls picnic
area, Sweetman said. Another recently stole a backpack from hikers in
the nearby Alger Creek campground. In August, a mother bear and her
cub knocked over a halogen lamp and set fire to a house they were
ransacking, incinerating themselves and leaving a local family
homeless.</TE>
<TE>   Wildlife officials said it's unclear if the bears' aggressiveness
stems from increased familiarity with humans or from desperation for
food, driven by this year's record drought.</TE>
<TE>   Wildlife biologist Doug Updike, who runs the Department of Fish
and Game's bear program, said he hasn't correlated rainfall with bear
behavior, but said that "intuitively it makes sense that during
drought years you would expect ... a higher number of interactions
between people and bears, because bears would be drawn into areas
where the grass is greener, literally."</TE>
<TE>   Dave Noble, Forest Home's director of operations, said bears
started making frequent appearances at the camp about 15 years ago.
Trouble began in 1989, when a bear entered a tent where a counselor
and kids were sleeping and bit the counselor's foot. The injury was
minor, but the bear was branded a hazard and killed by hunters under
a state permit.</TE>
<TE>   The incident sparked what Noble called a "community uprising"
among residents. About 400 of the 1,600 residents of the community of
Forest Falls signed petitions of protest against the bear's
destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Stung by the censure, camp officials took precautions against bear
attacks. They forbade food in tents or cabins and installed a
bear-proof trash compactor and trash cans. They hired a private
ranger and night watch guards to protect campers and ward off bears.
When Noble heard of a camp dog at a site in the Sierra Nevadas that
chased off wandering bears, he wondered whether a similar strategy
could work at Forest Home.</TE>
<TE>   That led him to the nonprofit Wind River Bear Institute. Hunt had
pioneered bear shepherding techniques using Karelian bear dogs. The
animals, resembling a compact Husky with a raccoon-like mask, are
considered intelligent and very loyal. They have thick black and
white fur.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of hunting bears, Hunt's dogs drive them from an inhabited
area back into the forest, much as a border collie steers cattle.
Upon encountering a bear, the dogs bark and chase the animal,
establishing a bear-free boundary at the site.</TE>
<TE>   The dogs have helped train bears to avoid people at national parks
and wilderness areas throughout the United States and Canada.
Eighteen Karelian bear dogs now work at those sites. Forest Home is
only the second California site to use the dogs in bear management,
and the first private institution to use them, Hunt said.</TE>
<TE>   Kate McCurdy, a former bear biologist with Yosemite National Park,
said Hunt's dogs helped clear a popular campground in Tuolumne
Meadows of long-standing problem bears.</TE>
<TE>   "We were really skeptical that just the experience of having dogs
barking at you would be enough to scare bears off, but they learned
really quickly that if you come into a campground, something scary
was going to happen," McCurdy said.</TE>
<TE>   The institute provided a bear dog to Forest Home's first ranger,
who bought it from the camp when he left the job last year. Hunt
recently brought a team of five bear dogs to the camp to work with
the new ranger, Chris Thornton, who will get his own puppy from the
next litter.</TE>
<TE>   The dogs have improved, but not eliminated, the camp's bear
problems. Indeed, during Hunt's recent visit to Forest Home a bear
rummaged through a cabin. Noble said the camp will always exist near
bears, but will labor to keep them in their proper place. "We want
people to be able to come to our camp and experience nature, but we
want them to be able to do it safely," he said.</TE>

<HD>Schools Chief Keeps Them Coming Back</HD>
<DH>Education: Yolanda Benitez, Ventura County's first Latina
superintendent, has gotten many ex-students to return as teachers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A second-generation Mexican American whose mother picked crops to
support her family, Rio School Supt. Yolanda Benitez is hard at work
planting her own seeds in this tiny Ventura County farming community.</LD>
<LD>   Through the years, Benitez, a whirlwind of energy at 51, has
prodded, encouraged and cajoled at least 25 former students and
acquaintances to become teachers and work in her district. One of
four Latino superintendents in the county, Benitez is a role model
and a reminder to the children of El Rio that their lives can reach
beyond the fields, supporters say.</LD>
<LD>   The 4,000 students in Rio's three elementary schools and one
junior high are 80% Latino. When Benitez joined the district in 1995,
the nearly all-white faculty and staff hardly reflected the student
body. Today, 76 of the district's 178 teachers are Latino.</LD>
<TE>   With a mix of enthusiasm and unwavering optimism packed into her
slight, 5-foot-2 frame, Benitez loves to preach the gospel of
education and self-confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "They can do anything they want to do," Benitez says of her
students. "Anything is possible for them, regardless. They've heard
too many times, 'You can't, you can't, you can't.' "</TE>
<TE>   Supporters say Benitez's passion is infectious.</TE>
<TE>   "She's such a go-getter. She'll fight for children all the way,"
said April McCarthy, who worked as an instructional assistant in the
Rio School District for 23 years.</TE>
<TE>   McCarthy met Benitez in 1995 as a member of the California School
Employees Assn. negotiating team.</TE>
<TE>   "She was such a pest. I was working on [a teaching degree] then,
but she was pushing it to go a little faster," McCarthy said.</TE>
<TE>   McCarthy, 47, grew up in El Rio, a sliver of a town wedged between
Oxnard's suburban sprawl and the bone-dry Santa Clara River. She
attended its public schools and will teach in her own classroom for
the first time this month at Del Rio School.</TE>
<TE>   "She kept telling me I was a natural and she wanted me to be a
schoolteacher in her district," said McCarthy, who attended college
part time for 11 years. "Every time she would come on campus, she
would say, 'This is my future teacher, this is my future teacher.' "</TE>
<TE>   Benitez lived part of her childhood in the garage of her aunt's
house in El Monte. Her father, whom she has met only once, abandoned
her family the day she was born in Santa Paula. Her mother, Maria
Benitez, sorted walnuts and picked crops to support Yolanda and her
older brother, Refugio.</TE>
<TE>   Benitez said she always wanted to be a teacher but received little
encouragement from those she encountered in school in the 1950s. "You
Mexicans will never get anywhere," she remembered a teacher telling
her while accusing Yolanda of cheating.</TE>
<TE>   Yet there was her sixth-grade teacher, whose name she has since
forgotten, who said, "Leave her alone; she's a smart kid."</TE>
<TE>   For the young self-starter, who earned straight A's on her report
cards, that was all the encouragement she needed. The words left a
lasting impression on Benitez.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I want to take the chance and have a negative
impact on a kid. Think about how many kids are destroyed by negative
comments," Benitez said. "Kids need someone to reaffirm their
dreams."</TE>
<TE>   After graduating from Rosemead High School, Benitez attended Cal
State Los Angeles on a federal scholarship intended to encourage
students to become bilingual teachers. She taught in public schools
in Los Angeles and Riverside before becoming a principal in Fillmore.
After an eight-year run as an assistant superintendent in Port
Hueneme, she was hired at Rio as the county's first Latina
superintendent.</TE>
<TE>   Benitez, who is married and has three adult children, seldom
strays from her self-imposed schedule of visiting a school four days
a week and reading to a class. She greets kids and teachers alike,
with hugs, and addresses them as "mijo" and "mija," Spanish terms of
endearment for "my daughter" and "my son."</TE>
<TE>   "I need to see children," Benitez said. "That's what it's all
about."</TE>
<TE>   Caroline Ramirez, 25, who grew up in El Rio and attended its
public schools, returned last year as a substitute science teacher
after graduating from Seattle University. Benitez was a family friend
who encouraged Ramirez's interest in teaching even as she transferred
from Boston University to Seattle to be closer to home.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I saw her at family events, she told me she wanted me
to come back," Ramirez said. "She thought it was amazing that someone
went to a school like that [Boston University] and wanted to come
back."</TE>

<TE>   "Every time I saw her at family events, she told me she wanted me

disrespect shown by some of her high school students, she sought
Benitez's advice.</TE>
<TE>   "She taught me to stand up for myself," Ramirez said. "She told me
to take it to the dean and be proud of what I'm doing. She said,
'Don't allow them to make you stop. You are the person who's heading
the classroom ... let them [students] know that.' "</TE>
<TE>   Benitez, who says she would like to run for public office someday,
has her detractors. They say she tries to advance her career and
political ambitions at the expense of students and the small
community of 9,100 residents.</TE>
<TE>   "She has created a power base that is strictly for
self-promotion," said Ron Mosqueda, a member of the Rio school board
who is often at odds with Benitez. "There is a gap. She doesn't have
the closeness with the community she once had. She's lost touch."</TE>
<TE>   But Frances Contreras, director of special projects for the Rio
School District, said such talk is nonsense. Contreras points out
that Benitez is a champion of bilingual education, important to El
Rio's Spanish-speaking residents.</TE>
<TE>   "She keeps her political activities separate," said Contreras, who
met Benitez 16 years ago when Contreras was a teacher in Santa Paula.
"When I read about it in the paper, that's when I find out. She keeps
it really clean."</TE>
<TE>   Contreras, 49, said she would not be where she is today without
Benitez, who persuaded her to move into school administration.</TE>
<TE>   First-grade teacher Margarita Mosqueda, 30, who is not related to
the school board member, met Benitez four years ago when the
superintendent visited UC Santa Barbara, where Mosqueda was a
student, to recruit future teachers. It was a meeting that changed
her life.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason that I'm still at Rio is because of her," Mosqueda
said. "I don't see Latina superintendents around that much. I can
totally relate to her. This is for me. It's home."</TE>

<HD>Major Legislative Bills Await Action by Davis</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The state Legislature acted on hundreds of bills in the final days
before adjournment early Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to issues that received extensive debate--proposals to
give farm workers arbitration rights, for instance, or bills imposing
new rules regarding the privacy of certain consumer
information--scores of others sailed through with little public
notice.</LD>
<LD>   Among the bills that were acted upon in the session's closing
hours and that await action by Gov. Gray Davis are:</LD>
<TE>   FINES--SB 807 by Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) would increase by
$200 the fines for many traffic violations, including reckless
driving and driving under the influence. The revenue would be
distributed to county doctors, trauma centers and hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   DEATH--AB 1421 by Assemblywoman Dion Aroner (D-Berkeley)
implements a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that mentally retarded
criminals cannot be put to death but can be sentenced to life behind
bars without parole. The bill creates a new defense, under which
prosecutors must prove that a defendant is not mentally retarded.</TE>
<TE>   INSURANCE--SB 1427 by Sen. Martha Escutia (D-Whittier) would
extend until 2007 an experimental car insurance program in Los
Angeles and San Francisco under which low-income drivers can obtain
minimum coverage policies at cheap rates. The bill would reduce the
annual costs for such a policy in Los Angeles from $450 to $347 and
from $410 to $314 in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   SEGWAY--SB 1918 by Sen. Tom Torlakson (D-Antioch) would legalize
the use on sidewalks of a two-wheeled electric vehicle called the
Segway Human Transporter, made by a New Hampshire company and capable
of speeds up to 20 mph.</TE>
<TE>   WAL-MART--AB 551 by Assemblyman Lou Papan (D-Millbrae) would
prohibit Wal-Mart from acquiring a small industrial bank in Orange
County, an acquisition that, if allowed, would enable the giant
retailer to process customer credit and debit card payments instead
of using the systems of other banks. Federal law prohibits retailers
from operating banks, but sponsors of the bill claim a loophole in
state law would allow Wal-Mart to buy the bank.</TE>
<TE>   WATER--SB 482 by Sen. Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa Monica), would help
clear the way for the transfer of water conserved by Imperial Valley
farmers to San Diego. The bill changes the legal protection of
several bird and fish species along the Colorado River to ease the
transfer, which is a key element of California's plan to satisfy a
federal order that it use less Colorado River water.</TE>
<TE>   HELMETS--SB 1924 by Sen. Jack O'Connell (D-San Luis Obispo) would
require children younger than 18 to wear a helmet when riding
scooters, skateboards and in-line or roller skates. The parents of
violators would be liable for a $25 fine.</TE>
<TE>   JUNK FAXES--AB 2944 by Assemblywoman Christine Kehoe (D-San Diego)
deletes a state law that allows companies to send unsolicited faxes
so long as they include a phone number or address by which receivers
can request a halt to the faxes. The bill allows a tougher federal
law, which bans companies from sending unsolicited advertising by fax
without permission, to take effect.</TE>

<HD>What Took So Long to Get a Budget? Blame Everyone</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>George Skelton</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO</LD>
<LD>   Inept. Irresponsible. Inexcusable.</LD>
<LD>   Stubborn. Shameless.</LD>
<TE>   Chaotic. Cowardly.</TE>
<TE>   This certainly does not exhaust the list of apt pejoratives for
our Legislature and governor. Let's just say the elected
representatives failed miserably in performing what annually is their
most important task: enacting a timely state budget.</TE>
<TE>   Timely, so that school districts, county hospitals, food vendors
and service centers for the disabled, for example, don't have to
spend their summer agonizing about when--and how much--they'll be
reimbursed. Or worrying about how to plan because the state Capitol
is numbed in gridlock.</TE>
<TE>   Vacillating.</TE>
<TE>   Arrogant.</TE>
<TE>   Pathetic.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, 62 days into the state's fiscal year--and 77 days after
the Legislature's constitutional deadline--the Assembly
anticlimactically passed a $98-billion state budget Saturday night.
The Senate passed a budget June 29 and went on vacation for a month.</TE>
<TE>   It's the 13th time in 16 years that a budget has not been enacted
until after the start of the new fiscal year, July 1.</TE>
<TE>   Whose fault is this? Practically everybody's.</TE>
<TE>   Minority Republicans whined all summer that the Democratic
governor refused to negotiate with them. They were right.</TE>
<TE>   One theory is that covering a $24-billion budget shortfall would
be so ugly that Gov. Gray Davis decided to stay out of the picture as
long as possible.</TE>
<TE>   He also wanted to avoid the cheap shots of Republicans during an
election year. He didn't, of course.</TE>
<TE>   Another theory is that Davis--unlike predecessor Pete
Wilson--really isn't versed in budget details and might embarrass
himself. He might also give away the store to Republicans, aides
reportedly felt.</TE>
<TE>   Yet another: If Davis reinstated the old "Big 5" meetings with the
two party leaders from each house, he'd have to spend quality time
with volatile, salty Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San
Francisco), his nemesis.</TE>
<TE>   There's probably some truth to all these conjectures.</TE>
<TE>   "As for [my being] missing in action, the media puts too much
emphasis on meetings," Davis told reporters Sunday. He did, after
all, propose one budget in January and revise it in May, offering tax
increases and spending cuts. And billions in budget-balancing fund
transfers and borrowing gimmicks.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, a governor should not have to baby-sit a Legislature. A
Legislature should be capable of writing and passing bills, even
budgets. It's the governor's job to sign or veto them.</TE>
<TE>   But in the real world of term limits, with legislative neophytes
licensed as leaders, a little hand-holding by the chief executive
usually is prudent and productive.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, when the governor is invited to intrude into the
legislative process, this is his priceless opportunity to fill a
power vacuum created by term limits. What Pat Brown or Ronald Reagan
wouldn't have given for such openings!</TE>
<TE>   Besides, what matters most in any Capitol is to matter--to be
relevant, to be in the game. Davis never gave Republicans that
opportunity. Neither did Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City)
until the end.</TE>
<TE>   Remember the Assembly lineup: Democrats 50, Republicans 30. Budget
votes needed: 54.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans don't know what they want, Democrats whimpered for
months. They have no end-game.</TE>
<TE>   It's true, the GOP mantra quickly got tiresome and trite: "We
don't have a revenue problem, we have a spending problem." The
Republicans' problem was that they refused to follow up their
rhetoric with enough proposed spending cuts to balance the budget.</TE>
<TE>   But the reason Democrats could not understand what the GOP wanted
is because they never listened. What the Republicans wanted were
face-saving outs. Wesson finally wised up.</TE>
<TE>   The single biggest contributor to budget gridlock was the
Republican fear of voting for a tax increase. It wasn't so much
ideological as political: They were deathly afraid of getting beaten
in some future GOP primary.</TE>
<TE>   Won't vote for a tax increase? Fine. Increase tax revenues by $2.4
billion and call it "revenue enhancements." Bingo: Four GOP votes.</TE>
<TE>   Insist on "restructuring" state spending to avoid future deficits.
Fine. Then create a commission "to address structural budget
problems."</TE>
<TE>   Need the vote of Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge)? Place
on the 2004 ballot his proposal to divert more general-fund money
into building projects.</TE>
<TE>   Legislators won't make the last $750 million in spending cuts?
Fine. Shovel off the dirty work to Davis. Call the cuts
"unallocated."</TE>
<TE>   Somebody please explain why these innovative solutions could not
have been dreamed up two months ago.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, the most pleasing word that describes the Legislature
is "adjourned."</TE>

<DL>EL DORADO HILLS, Calif.</DL>
<LD>An El Dorado County wildfire that destroyed a house grew by several
hundred acres Sunday and threatened at least 30 other homes, forcing
nearby residents to evacuate.</LD>
<LD>   A 15-year-old boy remained in El Dorado County's juvenile hall in
connection with the 700-acre wildfire.</LD>
<LD>   A second boy, also 15, was released to his family Saturday after
being questioned by authorities, said Lt. Kevin House of the El
Dorado County Sheriff's Department.</LD>
<TE>   At least one of the boys was playing with matches when the fire
ignited around 2:30 p.m. Saturday amid heavily forested canyons
between El Dorado Hills and Rescue, House said. He declined to
release the boys' names. The boy in custody had not been charged with
any crime Sunday morning.</TE>
<TE>   The Hickok Fire was 30% contained by Sunday at 11 a.m., with 570
firefighters working to protect homes, said Ken Vogele, a spokesman
for the California Department of Forestry.</TE>
<TE>   The fire crackled through trees about 40 miles east of Sacramento.</TE>

<HD>Hunters Mourn Lack of Quarry</HD>
<DH>Outdoors: Nearly 100 try their luck on first day of dove
season near Lancaster. But most find few birds and some look for a
second chance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dove season began Sunday with a promise from the state Department of
Fish and Game that the hunting would be "the best in years." Tell
that to Luis Ovies.</LD>
<LD>   Ovies sat on a camp seat, with a lone mourning dove in his cooler,
wondering where the birds were. He lives in North Hollywood and was
among about 100 hunters who were in the brush before sunrise Sunday
to try their luck at the Antelope Valley Sportsman's Club, west of
Lancaster.</LD>
<LD>   As a kickoff to the fall wing-shooting season, hunters in 38
states had the rare opportunity this year to devote the three-day
Labor Day weekend to the dove: scouting on Saturday and hunting
Sunday and today.</LD>
<TE>   In California, dove hunting is permitted through Sept. 15 then
picks up again for 45 days, beginning Nov. 9. Each year, about
120,000 hunters kill about 1.8 million doves in California, according
to a state survey.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if I got one, I go home and I'm happy," Ovies said.</TE>
<TE>   Factor in the cost of his membership at the club and his hunting
license and that one palm-sized bird he shot was probably worth more
than $250 a pound.</TE>
<TE>   "This is kind of like Vegas," said the club's owner, David
Whiteside. "You know when you go, you're going to lose money. And
then once in a while, you win. And it's wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   Driving through an old almond orchard Sunday, where in past
seasons doves have roosted in the trees like ornaments on a Christmas
tree, Whiteside observed, "This is a honey hole and there's nothing."</TE>
<TE>   Whiteside stocked his 1,250-acre ranch with 400 chukars, or
red-legged partridges, to keep hunters from getting too frustrated.</TE>
<TE>   A hunter for more than 40 years, he has his ideas why doves are
less plentiful this year. In the spring, just as their eggs would
have been hatching, a freeze hit the Antelope Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The cold stopped Whiteside's pear and plum trees from bearing
fruit for the little birds to eat. Drought kept down the sunflower
crop and other tasty weeds.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe the doves were pestered by starlings, which eat dove eggs
and commandeer nests for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "If I knew the real answer, I'd write a book and charge somebody
to buy it," Whiteside said.</TE>
<TE>   He hopes that, by the second half of dove season, birds from the
San Joaquin Valley will have migrated south to his land. The state
fish and game department singled out the San Joaquin area, as well as
parts of the Sacramento and Imperial valleys, as particularly
promising for hunters this year.</TE>
<TE>   In the Imperial Valley, a state-funded program that planted wheat,
barley and other grains on otherwise idle farmland attracted "scads
of dove," said La Velle Lesicka of Desert Wildlife Unlimited. Money
for such planting programs comes from the $6.55 stamps that hunters
must stick to their general hunting licenses before they are
permitted to shoot certain birds.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds, if not thousands, of hunters came out to the Imperial
Valley for the season's first day, Lesicka said. Many junior hunters
killed the state limit of 10 birds, and "it was nice to see these
people out who hadn't been out in a long time."</TE>
<TE>   The state Department of Fish and Game posts hunting regulations on
its Web site, www.dfg.ca.gov.</TE>

<HD>Car Painter Earned His Stripes</HD>
<DH>Exhibit: Campus show honors Von Dutch, whose work attracted
a cult following.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Today, the stripes that emphasize an automobile's shape are made of
stick-on tape.</LD>
<LD>   But in the 1950s and '60s, an ill-tempered Southern Californian
with an outlaw imagination pinstriped original designs by hand and
turned pinstriping into an art form.</LD>
<LD>   This week, the first solo art show devoted to that car-culture
pioneer--the late Von Dutch--opens on the Cal State Northridge
campus. The irascible Dutch would have hated the show, or any
exhibition honoring him, his admirers say.</LD>
<TE>   One of a trio of high-impact, lowbrow artists--along with Ed "Big
Daddy" Roth and Robert Williams--Von Dutch was a master machinist, as
well as a creative artist, said Al Quattrocchi, 42, whose Tornado
Design acted as curator for the show with the Copro-Nason Gallery of
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think he was a trained artist, but his dad was an artist,
a craftsman, and Dutch had the hand skills," said Quattrocchi.</TE>
<TE>   The co-curator compares Dutch with Leonardo da Vinci, another
artist-tinkerer with great hand skills who built original machines.
In addition to the idiosyncratic vehicles Dutch constructed from
spare parts, he also built a steam-powered TV set and a coin-operated
guillotine.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a Ford engine in his garage that he would fire up to
sharpen pencils," Quattrocchi said.</TE>
<TE>   Born near Watts in 1929, Dutch, whose given name was Kenneth
Howard, was the son of a popular sign painter. His father, Wally
Howard, pinstriped flower carts at the Farmers Market and created the
famous Western Exterminator logo--a top-hatted man hiding his mallet
from the feisty rodent at his feet.</TE>
<TE>   Smitten with motorcycles, young Howard showed a precocious gift as
both mechanic and painter. He renamed himself Von Dutch because it
had a memorable Prussian ring to it. He created a logo for himself--a
bloodshot eyeball with wings.</TE>
<TE>   So original and mesmerizing was his pinstriping--often featuring
caricatures inspired by the client--that soon people were lining up,
cash in hand, to have their cars and motorcycles "Dutched." In the
1950s he charged $10 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Titled "Von Dutch: An American Original," the show opens Tuesday
and continues through Oct. 5 in the art galleries on the Northridge
campus.</TE>
<TE>   Billed as "the most comprehensive collection of original works by
Von Dutch ever assembled," the exhibit includes auto bodies ablaze
with his signature painted flames, a pinstriped child's rocking
chair, handmade guns and knives, macabre paintings, his hybrid
"Kenford" truck, comics-inspired signs and a hand-painted hi-fi
console.</TE>
<TE>   Dutch, who died in 1992 at 63, was a link between the on-the-road
ethos of the Beats and the counterculture of the 1960s and '70s,
especially the art of Zap and other underground comics. A blue-collar
icon, he won a new generation of fans when Vin Diesel wore a Von
Dutch shirt in the 2001 street-racer movie "The Fast and the
Furious."</TE>
<TE>   Like the 1993 group show titled "Kustom Kulture" at the Laguna Art
Museum, which included Von Dutch work, the new exhibit is full of
testosterone and references to the car culture born in Southern
California just as surfer culture was.</TE>
<TE>   Although not as well-known as "Big Daddy" Roth, whose Rat
Fink--the anti-Mickey Mouse cartoon character--sold 1 million
T-shirts, Dutch has always had collectors. The actor Nicolas Cage is
one of them now.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the material in the show came from Jim and Danny Brucker,
who hired Dutch to work on their collection of movie cars in the
1970s</TE>
<TE>   Dutch was always a curmudgeon and serious beer drinker and did not
become less so as he grew older.</TE>
<TE>   According to a friend and fellow artist, Bob Burns, Dutch lived,
until his death, in a locked compound in Santa Paula near the
Bruckers' cars, "mostly running everyone off, especially those
wearing any kind of uniform or carrying a clipboard." He once shot at
a visitor because the visitor was from Cleveland, recalled Burns, who
described Dutch as "really eccentric-amundo!"</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody who knew him, or who even spent five minutes with him,
has some crazy tale," said Aaron Kahan, 35, a designer at Tornado and
the nephew of Robert Williams. His father's car was pinstriped in
1966 by Dutch.</TE>
<TE>   Dutch antagonized many of his former friends. Kahan said he heard
a classic Dutch tale from John Parker, who worked for legendary
motorcycle restorer Bud Ekins, as Dutch had.</TE>
<TE>   Once when Ekins was away, the story goes, Dutch got into Ekins'
garage and made a mess. Parker tried to eliminate any evidence of
Dutch's unwanted visit, but Ekins knew instantly on his return that
Dutch had been there.</TE>
<TE>   The reason? Ekins fed a large number of stray cats, and the
condition of the cats gave Dutch away.</TE>
<TE>   "Dutch had trimmed all the whiskers off the cats to make striping
brushes," Kahan explained.</TE>
<TE>   People who knew the Kustom Kulture artists say Dutch wasn't the
self-promoter that some others were, nor did he seem to care about
money. Although he would have hated the term, his attitude toward art
and money was downright romantic.</TE>
<TE>   In 1965, Dutch told a magazine writer, "There's a 'struggle' you
have to go through, and if you make a lot of money it doesn't make
the 'struggle' go away. It just makes it more complicated. If you
keep poor, the struggle is simple."</TE>
<TE>   As for his work: In the year he died, Dutch lettered a sign, which
is in the Northridge show, urging viewers to "use any of my stuff you
want to. Nothing is original. Everything is in the subconscious, we
just 'tap' it sometimes and think we have originated something."</TE>
<TE>   As to copyrights and patents, Dutch said, they "are mostly an ego
trip."</TE>

<HD>Santa Ana Project Turns Spotlight on Big Developer</HD>
<DH>Urban renewal: Michael Harrah, credited with helping
revitalize downtown, had operated quietly until he planned a 37-story
office tower.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H.G. REZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He owns much of downtown Santa Ana, where he has quietly saved old
buildings and helped fuel an urban renaissance. But few in town knew
Michael Harrah, the 6-foot-6
biker-turned-stunt-pilot-turned-millionaire developer.</LD>
<LD>   Until he tried to put up an office building. A really big office
building.</LD>
<LD>   Harrah owns or co-owns about 50 buildings, worth more than $212
million. Their combined total of more than 2 million square feet
house art galleries, restaurants, a performing arts center, parking
lots and office buildings.</LD>
<TE>   Harrah, 51, has built a real estate fiefdom in the heart of Santa
Ana. In the process, he has given the city a respectability it has
not enjoyed since the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of these buildings were 100% vacant and ready for
demolition. Nobody wanted to invest in downtown--until Mike Harrah
came along," said City Councilman Jose Solorio.</TE>
<TE>   Now, downtown Santa Ana is an acclaimed arts and culture center.
Galleries, studios and theaters attract patrons from throughout
Southern California to buildings Harrah saved from either the
wrecking ball or blight.</TE>
<TE>   The Masonic Temple, built in 1930, was boarded up for almost a
decade, slowly falling apart before Harrah turned it into a
performing arts center with three theaters and restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   One street over, the two-story Santora Building, built in the
1920s in the Spanish Colonial Revival style, was destined to be an
indoor swap meet until Harrah bought and restored it. It now houses
galleries, art studios and a restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Harrah took a gamble on Santa Ana at a time when things could not
have looked bleaker for the city and Orange County. He began buying
properties at bargain prices after the county filed for bankruptcy in
1994--the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   Harrah's low-profile business style kept him out of the spotlight
until last year, when he revealed plans for One Broadway Plaza, a
37-story office tower on the edge of downtown that would be Orange
County's tallest building. The $90-million project would add 650,000
square feet to his holdings. Overnight, Harrah became the target of
criticism and curiosity.</TE>
<TE>   Even critics expect the project to be approved by the Planning
Commission, despite objections from the Santa Ana Historical
Preservation Society. The group says the proposed 493-foot building
violates the city's Midtown Specific Plan, which limits new
structures to three stories or 35 feet, and says it will destroy the
character of the historic Broadway Corridor, lined with homes and
buildings more than 50 years old. The project also would require
demolition or removal of a historic apartment building--the kind of
structure Harrah once was known for saving.</TE>
<TE>   The bickering over One Broadway Plaza has put a spotlight on
Harrah.</TE>
<TE>   Many want to know more about the oversized millionaire--Harrah
weighs 300 pounds--with the ZZ Top beard and a preference for jeans
and boots over business suits. Among other intriguing details: Harrah
flies his own Cobra attack helicopter in stunts for movies like the
latest "Austin Powers" sequel and "The Siege."</TE>
<TE>   "Folks are curious about who he is. Mike isn't seen much in
public. A lot of people don't know what he looks like or who he is,"
said preservationist Tim Rush.</TE>
<TE>   But even while criticizing Harrah, Rush and others express
grudging admiration for what he has accomplished in Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   "He came in and rehabbed downtown when everyone [else] was running
away from it," Rush said.</TE>
<TE>   The son of a machinist and a teacher, Harrah was raised in
Whittier. He attended Cal State Long Beach, studying architecture,
but did not graduate. Instead, he went to work as a carpenter. By the
time he was 25, he had made $3 million with his own company building
apartments in Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   By 1985, Building Design and Construction magazine ranked his
company as the 20th-largest construction firm in the nation. Harrah
went on to develop a resort at Lake Havasu, making millions in the
process, all before he was 35.</TE>
<TE>   "I was buying boats, motorcycles, planes and vintage cars by the
dozens. I was making a lot of money," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But a bad business deal in Lake Havasu, he says, pushed him into
bankruptcy in 1990. "I went down pretty hard. I owed people $20
million," he said. And he wound up moving "from my house in Newport
Beach to renting a bedroom from my mother-in-law in Garden Grove."</TE>
<TE>   Harrah is coy when it comes to talking about how he emerged from
bankruptcy. But five years after going broke, he turned his attention
to Santa Ana, convincing investors and lenders there were millions to
be made by redeveloping downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Rueben Martinez, owner of a well-known bookstore in downtown Santa
Ana, said Harrah is "the most unforgettable character I've ever met."</TE>
<TE>   Several people said Harrah's handshake is good enough to seal a
business deal. That was the case with Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   Harrah asked him to move into one of his buildings. But when he
said how much he wanted in rent, Martinez replied, "I sell books, not
diamonds."</TE>
<TE>   "He grinned and cut the rent in half. Then he dropped the keys in
my hand and said I could move in any time I wanted," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Harrah is not without his detractors, however. Critics like
attorney Barry Jensen complain that city officials never say no to
Harrah.</TE>
<TE>   Jensen lives in French Park, a neighborhood that would be in the
shadow of One Broadway Plaza. Its residents have been among the more
outspoken opponents of Harrah's project.</TE>
<TE>   Jensen and others believe the city gave in to Harrah when it
issued a demolition permit for the Yale Apartments, built in the
1930s. Though dilapidated, the buildings are on the city's historic
register.</TE>
<TE>   The apartments are in the middle of the proposed One Broadway
Plaza. Initially, Harrah was ordered to repair the buildings, which
were then occupied. Records show that Harrah failed to act on the
order, and the city attorney's office filed a misdemeanor complaint
against him in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   But Harrah produced an engineering report that showed the
buildings needed expensive repairs to make them safe.</TE>
<TE>   City Atty. Joseph W. Fletcher said Santa Ana accepted the
engineering report submitted by Harrah without an inspection by a
city engineer. With the buildings deemed unsafe, Harrah was ordered
to vacate the apartments and was issued a demolition permit, Fletcher
said.</TE>
<TE>   The buildings, however, still stand. Harrah has extended an olive
branch to preservationists by offering to give the empty, boarded-up
buildings to anyone who has a place for them.</TE>
<TE>   Harrah also attracted scrutiny--this time from the federal
government--when questions arose about invoices he submitted in 1998
totaling at least $80,000. The invoices were for work done on a
building owned by Harrah and leased to the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development.</TE>
<TE>   Jensen said he turned copies of the invoices over to HUD after the
documents were dropped off at his home by someone he declined to
identify. He said that the companies did not exist and that their
addresses were mail boxes, not offices. A GSA spokeswoman would not
confirm that an inquiry was underway, but sources said federal
investigators have interviewed at least one witness.</TE>
<TE>   Harrah admitted in an interview that the addresses on the invoices
were mail drops and that the companies were using his general
contractor's license. But he said that the companies are
subcontractors he owns, and that he formed them for tax purposes on
the advice of his accountant.</TE>
<TE>   He appears unruffled by the allegations of wrongdoing. He has his
eye on other properties and plans to move from Newport Beach to
French Park, just blocks from his office.</TE>
<TE>   When reminded that French Park residents have been among his
harshest critics, Harrah joked, "If you can't beat 'em, join 'em."</TE>

<HD>With Sea Breeze Cut Off, Temperatures Soar</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A potent high-pressure system cut off the air-cooling Southern
California sea breezes Sunday, sending temperatures soaring across
the Southland.</LD>
<LD>   Triple-digit readings were recorded from the San Fernando Valley
to San Bernardino County, with record highs for the day set in
Chatsworth, 111, and Riverside, 112.</LD>
<LD>   Forecasters said scorching weather was not unusual for this time
of year, and expected more heat before a cooling trend and possible
showers later this week.</LD>
<TE>   Forecasters said a high-pressure system hovering over the
Nevada-Arizona border was responsible for the heat wave.</TE>
<TE>   "This high pressure is bringing in some good hot temperatures,"
said Stuart Seto, a weather specialist for the National Weather
Service.</TE>
<TE>   "The unusual thing about this high pressure is that it is off to
the Southwest ... and it's cutting off our sea breeze."</TE>
<TE>   Some Labor Day weekend early birds awoke to temperatures in the
90s. By midafternoon, it was 107 in Burbank, 106 in Van Nuys, 101 in
Lancaster and 94 in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's top reading of 101 degrees in downtown Los Angeles was
nine degrees below the record for the date, set in 1955.</TE>
<TE>   People seeking relief flocked to parks and beaches across the
region.</TE>
<TE>   Crowds estimated at 200,000 visited beaches from San Pedro to
Marina del Rey--the biggest turnout of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a beautiful day, and busy," said David Story, a
lifeguard captain for the Los Angeles County Fire Department.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the hottest day, but the combination of the weather and
the holiday is giving us the biggest crowds of the season."</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, a 38-year-old man from the Foothill Ranch area
apparently died of heat-related problems while hiking in 109-degree
heat at Modjeska Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   The hiker, Michael Curtin, was found by a mountain biker near
Modjeska Grade Road and Santiago Truck Trail at 1:20 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The bicyclist, who is a physician, tried to revive him but was
unsuccessful, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   He "tried to do what he could but he passed away," said Sheriff's
Lt. Dave Wilson. "He had a bottle of water with him but he still
passed away."</TE>
<TE>   Forecasters expect slightly lower temperatures today, and about a
10-degree cooling trend starting Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   By Wednesday, a low-pressure system could bring showers,
forecasters said.</TE>

<HD>Speakers Say Iran Ignores Killings</HD>
<DH>Human rights: Group meeting in Costa Mesa wants regime to
take responsibility for deaths of an estimated 30,000 political
prisoners.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hamid Ershad didn't need to see the video playing before a shocked
crowd of 300 at an Iranian human rights conference in Costa Mesa on
Sunday. He witnessed the horrors being shown on the screen firsthand:
the mob violence, the stonings, the whippings.</LD>
<LD>   When he lived in Tehran, Ershad was thrown into jail in 1974. He
was released during the 1979 revolution but said Islamic radicals
were about to throw him in jail again and torture him--or worse--when
he fled to the United States.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, Ershad joined others for the Mission for Establishment
of Human Rights in Iran conference hoping to raise awareness about
ongoing rights violations in Iran, even at a time of supposed reform.</LD>
<TE>   "A lot of people don't know what is still going on there," said
Ershad, 54, who lives in Venice Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The conference focused on the massacres of the Islamic regime in
Iran in the summer of 1988, when human rights groups estimate that
30,000 political prisoners were killed. The organizers pointed out
that many in the administration of President Mohammad Khatami held
positions of power during those massacres and have yet to denounce
them.</TE>
<TE>   "Why is the West trying to appease a regime responsible for the
massacre of thousands of people?" asked Mohammad Parvin, the founder
of the group that held the conference. "Have we heard even one word
from [Khatami] condemning stoning? The number of people stoned to
death has been heightened under Khatami."</TE>
<TE>   A keynote speaker at the conference was Rep. Loretta Sanchez
(D-Garden Grove), who promised to fight against warming relations
with Iran if it means ignoring human rights abuse. "We know human
rights are abused in Iran, and it must stop," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez also demanded accountability for the massacres. "The mass
murder of thousands of political prisoners in 1988 must be recognized
by the world as a crime against humanity," she said.</TE>

<LD>Tap water in Santa Fe Springs was deemed safe to drink after a liquid
detergent that had contaminated the system was flushed out, officials
said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Officials turned off the city's water supply and left notices
warning people not to drink the water at about 3,500 homes and
businesses in a 2-mile-square area after the substance spilled into
the system Friday afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   The detergent, typically used to treat metal parts, can cause
nausea and diarrhea but did not cause any illnesses, said Fire
Department Battalion Chief Scott Goodwin.</LD>
<TE>   A private firm and the county health department tested the water
before the state Department of Health Services declared it safe about
11:30 p.m. Saturday, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials were still investigating the cause of the spill.</TE>

<HD>Street Fair Is Right Up Kids' Alley</HD>
<DH>Events: Orange food festival expands its youth activities
in an effort to shed its 'beer bust' image.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mike Turner was happy Sunday to see that, along with the ice-cold
beer, the Orange International Street Fair was well stocked with
exciting activities for his young children, including face-painting,
a bounce house and a petting zoo.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a mini fair within the fair, and that's good because this
event has gotten so big over the years," Turner said, happy to see an
expanded children's area.</LD>
<LD>   After his 4-year-old daughter, Caitlyn, had her face painted, the
32-year-old father from Orange headed for the beer line--his favorite
booth when he first came to the fair as a bachelor 12 years ago--to
counter the 92-degree heat and 41% humidity.</LD>
<TE>   Turner's experience was just what fair organizers were aiming for
when they planned the 30th annual fair, which attracted about 700,000
people Friday, Saturday and Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The fair, which includes dozens of stands selling foods from
Germany, Norway, Polynesia, Denmark, Mexico and elsewhere, had gotten
a reputation as a "beer bust," said fair President Marsha Zembower.
The expanded children's area was an effort to change that image, she
said, and next year it will be three times larger.</TE>
<TE>   "People seem to have found the children's area, and they are
thrilled," Zembower said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like an old-fashioned fair."</TE>
<TE>   Local nonprofits that run the booths rely on the proceeds to
bolster their coffers, and some of their representatives said Sunday
that the new attractions were great for business. Fair organizers
said about 125 nonprofits participated this year.</TE>
<TE>   Cathy Seelis, executive director of the Friendly Center, said she
noted a slightly smaller crowd than in years past, but a thirsty
crowd still eager to buy her tacos and beer.</TE>
<TE>   Proceeds from the family resource center's booth--expected to be
about $35,000--constitute an important part of the center's $400,000
annual budget.</TE>
<TE>   The center, in Orange, provides emergency food and other
assistance to the needy.</TE>
<TE>   "This is our largest fund-raiser. It is very important to our
budget. Besides, it gives us an opportunity to do outreach in the
community," Seelis said.</TE>

<HD>Pressure Fails to Break Through Water Impasse</HD>
<DH>Resources: San Diego County, Imperial Valley officials must
strike a deal by Dec. 31. Cuts in Colorado River 'surplus' could
affect millions.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Despite the intervention of legislators and other high-level state
officials, the water district here has failed to break an impasse
between arid San Diego County and water-rich Imperial Valley that
threatens the supply for all of Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   Unless the San Diego County Water Authority and the Imperial
Irrigation District can reach agreement by Dec. 31, the U.S.
Department of the Interior has threatened to reduce the amount of
"surplus" water the state receives from the Colorado River.</LD>
<LD>   The cutback could initially be offset by water in storage. But it
could quickly lead to a severe reduction in water for the six
counties and 17 million people served by the Los Angeles-based
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California.</LD>
<TE>   In a response made public Saturday night, officials of the
Imperial Irrigation District rejected as inadequate a revised
proposal by San Diego to buy some of the Imperial Valley's enormous
annual allocation from the Colorado River.</TE>
<TE>   The San Diego revision called for providing $135 million to the
Imperial Valley at the beginning of the 75-year deal; allowing a
five-year period before farmers have to allow land to go fallow; and
helping the farmers pay the cost of restoring the Salton Sea.</TE>
<TE>   But Imperial Irrigation District officials said the proposal would
provide no new money, just accelerated payments; could damage the
Salton Sea; and would not come close to offsetting the effect on the
area's agricultural economy of letting fields go fallow.</TE>
<TE>   Although California water disputes tend to be measured in decades,
this one appears headed for crunch time.</TE>
<TE>   Imperial Irrigation District Director Andy Horne said that the San
Diego proposal--billed as a sweetened revision of a tentative
agreement reached in 1998--would leave the district vulnerable to a
bill of hundreds of millions of dollars for environmental damage to
the Salton Sea.</TE>
<TE>   A reduction in water use in the Imperial Valley would mean less
runoff to replenish the sea and thus an increase in the salinity
level, which could kill vast numbers of birds and fish. Under state
and federal laws, much of the burden of repairing such damage could
fall on the Imperial Irrigation District because it is profiting from
the water sale.</TE>
<TE>   Horne and other directors also oppose the requirement in the
proposal that farmers let as much as 10% of the district's 500,000
acres go fallow to save water for San Diego. The proposal would leave
the district and the Imperial Valley "holding the bag for the
socioeconomic and environmental mitigation costs," Horne said.</TE>
<TE>   Horne was involved in two days of negotiations last week in
Sacramento arranged by Assemblyman Bob Hertzberg (D-Van Nuys).</TE>
<TE>   Legislators and Davis administration officials, including
Resources Agency Secretary Mary Nichols, urged the Imperial Valley to
reach an agreement with San Diego to help the state meet the Dec. 31
deadline.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday night, after a six-hour closed board meeting, the
Imperial district had its lawyer, John Carter, send a letter to the
general manager of the San Diego County Water Authority branding the
San Diego proposal unfair and far below what is needed to keep the
Imperial Valley economy from being ravaged as land goes fallow.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Dennis Cushman, assistant general manager of the San Diego
agency, found the letter encouraging. "We read their response as
'Let's talk,' " he said Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Horne said the San Diego offer would only shift around money from
the 1998 agreement and would not provide any additional money. San
Diego disagrees. "In our view, we put a very generous offer on the
table," Cushman said.</TE>
<TE>   Maureen Stapleton, San Diego County Water Authority general
manager, is set to go to El Centro this week to address a session of
the Imperial County Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   California for several years has enjoyed "surplus" water from the
Colorado River beyond its assured allocation, under a maze of
agreements involving the seven states that depend on the river.</TE>
<TE>   The Metropolitan Water District has received about 800,000
acre-feet of surplus water a year, enough for 1.6 million families.
The surplus water is in addition to the assured allocation of about
550,000 acre-feet. The surplus water belongs in large part to Arizona
and Nevada, which have pressured the federal government to wean
California away from receiving the surplus water. But the Clinton
administration brokered a deal among Western states giving California
15 years to learn to live without surplus water. But the other states
set a number of deadlines, including Dec. 31.</TE>
<TE>   Because Imperial Valley farmers were taking water from the
Colorado River long before the Metropolitan district was created, the
Imperial district gets approximately 3 million acre-feet of water
each year, making the desert bloom with a $1-billion agricultural
economy.</TE>
<TE>   A bipartisan succession of state and federal officials have said
that voluntary sales of water from Imperial Valley to the coastal
regions are key to California's learning to live within its
allocations.</TE>

<HD>Santa Ana Zoo's Big Game Plan</HD>
<DH>Parks: Facility launches campaign to vie for visitors,
raises funds to add more animals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lost in the shadows of nearby amusement parks, the little-known Santa
Ana Zoo is launching an aggressive campaign to let folks know that
Mickey Mouse isn't the only animal in Orange County worth checking
out.</LD>
<LD>   Along with a new children's area featuring farm animals, and plans
for an exotic jaguar exhibit, the city zoo has hired a new
fund-raiser to publicize the small park and raise the millions of
dollars needed to bolster its modest collection of animals.</LD>
<LD>   The push comes as the Santa Ana Zoo at Prentice Park celebrates
its 50th anniversary and just months after it regained the national
accreditation it was stripped of by the American Zoo and Aquarium
Assn. in 2000 because of delayed maintenance and improvements.</LD>
<TE>   "We are one or two exhibits away from being a primary
destination," said Ron Glazier, the zoo's director.</TE>
<TE>   While optimistic, Glazier realizes he faces a mammoth task.
Tourists and Orange County residents have an abundance options when
it comes to spending their money and free time, from Disneyland and
Knott's Berry Farm to the local beaches and shopping malls.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana's small animal park also is between two of the country's
largest and most popular zoos--the San Diego Zoo and the Los Angeles
Zoo, both of which are just a daytrip away.</TE>
<TE>   Statistics also show that the Santa Ana Zoo's annual attendance
and membership pale in comparison to similar-sized zoos nationwide,
and to many zoos in California.</TE>
<TE>   In a county of 3 million people, the Santa Ana Zoo has just 4,500
members even though a $39 tax-deductible membership, which allows a
family free admission for a year, costs less than a single ticket to
Disneyland.</TE>
<TE>   John Floyd, the zoo's new fundraiser, accepts this challenge as he
begins to promote the zoo to the community and to potential corporate
donors. Although Floyd started three months ago, his job really began
in late August with the park's annual Zoofari, the zoo's big
$150-a-plate fundraiser.</TE>
<TE>   Floyd, a North Carolina businessman who honed his fund-raising
skills last year during a stint at United Way, hopes to create a buzz
by publicizing the construction of the zoo's new children's area,
which is scheduled to begin in this month. The exhibit will include
rare breeds of farm animals such the Navajo-Churro sheep, Oberhasli
goat and unusual breeds of swine, cattle, geese and turkeys.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to show people what a gem this is," Floyd said. "I've
been talking to people about my new job and some of them don't even
realize there is a zoo in Santa Ana. I think there is room for a lot
of improvement."</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana has owned and operated the zoo ever since citrus grower
Joseph Prentice willed the land to the city half a century ago. Under
the terms of the gift, the city agreed to always maintain 50 primates
on the property.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the main zoo has been known for years as monkey row
because of its silver langur, lemurs, brown-headed spider monkeys and
their cousins. In all, the zoo now has 276 animals.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids like it. They get to run around. But really, you have to
admit, that there isn't much more here than a bunch of monkeys," said
Felice Jackson, a Tustin mother of three.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson and other parents say they often chose the zoo because,
with a $5 admission for adults and $3 for children and seniors, it's
less expensive than other attractions. It's also easier to get to and
offers a train ride and other kid-friendly accommodations.</TE>
<TE>   Evelina Madrazo, who took her niece to the zoo on a recent day,
said her favorite part is the aviary, complete with a running brook,
luscious plants and roseate spoonbills.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a little peace in the middle of a hectic county, a hectic
world. It'll be nice to have a few more animals here," she said. "But
this is just a little oasis that isn't far from home."</TE>
<TE>   Glazier said that despite the lack of animals, the zoo attracts
parents because they don't have to push strollers up and down hills
as they do at the Los Angeles and San Diego zoos, and parents are
never too far away from their cars.</TE>
<TE>   Glazier estimates that about one-third of the park's visitors come
from Santa Ana, one-third from surrounding cities and the rest from
other parts of Southern California. The zoo is conducting a more
thorough survey of its visitors, which officials hope will guide
their campaign to improve the park's appeal.</TE>
<TE>   About 760 people visit the Santa Ana Zoo daily, and park officials
expect that number could spike when the new children's zoo area opens
in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Administrators at other California small and modest-sized zoos
said that without rotating exhibits and other programs, it's
difficult to increase attendance.</TE>
<TE>   Jeanette Gulledge, marketing director for the Oakland Zoo, said a
campaign to increase membership could pay off. As in Santa Ana, she
said, many people from more affluent suburbs did not want to come to
Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Two membership drives later, though, the membership roll has
doubled to 22,000 families. An intense drive to promote the Oakland
Zoo's education programs brings in 4,200 visitors a year alone, she
said. The Oakland Zoo's yearly attendance is 500,000.</TE>
<TE>   "You really have to work closely with the city officials to
promote a zoo. It really pays off," Gulledge said.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Ana Zoo attracts 276,000 visitors a year, fewer than
many zoos of similar size. About 450,000 people visit the Santa
Barbara Zoo annually, which has 541 animals. While Santa Ana has
4,500 members, Santa Barbara has 12,000.</TE>
<TE>   One likely reason for Santa Ana's low attendance is due to the
competition: The San Diego Zoo is home to 4,000 animals and attracts
3.4 million people each year; the Los Angeles Zoo, with 1,013
animals, attracts 1.7 million people annually.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Santa Ana Zoo can do better, Glazier said, and will
benefit from improvements that followed the loss of accreditation in
2000. The city pumped $1.5 million into the facility for such
improvements as a redesigned entrance, a remodeled commissary and
animal kitchen, a new staff locker area, quarantine facility and
veterinary clinic, and repaved walkways and parking.</TE>
<TE>   Even with such efforts, Ralph Waterhouse, director of the Chaffee
Zoo in Fresno, said Santa Ana's facility will probably always
struggle if it competes for visitors with Mickey Mouse.</TE>
<TE>   "You have incredible competition there, and that may discourage
people from becoming members," Waterhouse said. "Here in Fresno, it's
not like that. I think [Santa Ana is] doing a great job considering
that."</TE>

<HD>Commissioned Works Don't Soar to New Cathedral's Heights</HD>
<DH>Building design takes visitors on a spiritual voyage;
artwork helps little on this journey.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The works of art commissioned for the Cathedral of Our Lady of the
Angels don't begin to approach the pungent complexity of what the
building's celebrated Spanish architect has attempted. Jose Rafael
Moneo's cathedral design creates a powerful experience for a visitor;
the lackluster art mostly just describes it.</LD>
<LD>   The Archdiocese of Los Angeles hired Father Richard S. Vosko, a
priest and educator in Albany, N.Y., as art consultant to the
project, with a $6-million budget for the first phase. Three major
commissions dominate his cathedral program.</LD>
<LD>   Vosko took his first cue from Moneo, who employs an abstract
building vocabulary. Moneo's magnificent design could be described as
a narrative of transformation. A visitor goes on a spiritual voyage.
Powerful intangibles of space, light and interval are manipulated to
create drama, amplitude, serenity.</LD>
<TE>   The path begins with the mundane beauties of the street outside
and arrives at a dynamic, radiant space within the cathedral. At
journey's end, an enormous concrete cross thrusts into the church
interior, visually projected through a translucent membrane of
glowing alabaster. The cross is at once symbolic and structural.</TE>
<TE>   The three art commissions denote this voyage. A plaza fountain and
waterfall by painter and installation artist Lita Albuquerque (in
collaboration with architect Robert Kramer) indicate a spiritual
presence outside the church. Sculptor Robert Graham's enormous bronze
doors mark the dramatic start of the pilgrimage. Painter John Nava's
gathering of tapestry saints in the nave shows what happens at its
completion.</TE>
<TE>   But the difference between Moneo's design and the artists' is the
difference between the physical embodiment of abstract ideas and a
textual representation of them. The art reflects the stylistic
pluralism of international art. But it also clings to a failed idea
in 1980s multiculturalism--one that reduces art's subject to a
simplistic description of audience diversity.</TE>
<TE>   Albuquerque's project is incomplete, but it is currently composed
of a flat, disk-shaped fountain, which stands waist-high and seems to
hover in space before a waterfall cascading down a wall. You can put
your fingers in the tabletop water, in subtle anticipation of the
baptismal motif celebrated inside the cathedral on Nava's biggest
tapestry.</TE>
<TE>   The scheme is uncomfortably similar to Maya Lin's 1989 design for
the Civil Rights Memorial at the Southern Poverty Law Center in
Montgomery, Ala. The stone's color is different, but the pleasant
composition is the same. It could almost have been ordered from a
catalog--which isn't what one wants from a major commission.</TE>
<TE>   In place of Lin's listing of key events in the civil rights
movement, across which sheets of water flow, Albuquerque's circular
marble table is etched with the phrase, "I shall give you living
water," in the 37 languages of L.A.'s Catholic parishioners.</TE>
<TE>   This dull type of by-the-numbers, demographic representation
continues in Graham's doors, which create a protective impression of
fortress. Through sheer mass, entrance into the cathedral is marked
with a sense of great occasion.</TE>
<TE>   Nested within them is a pair of smaller, user-friendly doors,
decorated with 40 obscure pre-Christian symbols, as well as 15
castings of historical images of the Virgin Mary, as represented in
the New World. Their Spanish Colonial sources range from the
elaborate Cuzco School in Peru to a simple Mexican ex voto (a
devotional painting on tin).</TE>
<TE>   High above, standing on a golden plinth before a curved golden
wall, a figurative sculpture represents Our Lady of the Angels--the
newest New World Mary. Larger than life, she's dressed in a
Japanese-style robe, arms open in a gesture of welcome. The style is
a graceful blend of focused realism and idealization. Mary's a
forceful Everywoman, which emphasizes her humanity, but she's
monumental too.</TE>
<TE>   The design's most compelling feature is a cone-shaped cut made
through the curved wall behind her. Looking up, you see the lower
portion of the cone as a projection that becomes the crescent moon
beneath Mary's feet--a common symbol of her divinity. The cone's
angle continues in diagonal lines cut into the huge bronze doors.
This pattern is a graphic signifier of radiance, but it's too flimsy
to overcome the austere massiveness of all that dark bronze.</TE>
<TE>   The upper portion of the cone cuts through the golden wall behind
Mary, forming her halo. The mystical ring of light is created by
vivid blue sky. Graham has daringly borrowed this idea from no less
than Leonardo da Vinci's "The Last Supper," where Jesus' head is
framed with a painted "halo" of sky. But Graham makes the concept
real, not an illusion, reinventing a stale spiritual symbol through
ephemeral natural beauty. The effect is magical.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, Nava's tapestries are reticent in the extreme. Woven in
Belgium, their pale, dappled tonalities--taken from photographs of
Jerusalem stone--create a coy illusion of fresco. They defer so much
to Moneo's architectural environment that you almost wonder why
they're present.</TE>
<TE>   The figures, most dressed in historical garb, are obviously
contemporary men, women and children, drawn from various ethnicities
and all walks of life. (They also include what must surely be the
only representation of sneakers and Birkenstock-style sandals in the
long history of tapestry art. And no, Jennifer Jones does not play
St. Bernadette.) Symbolic role-playing, which casts living people as
historical dignitaries, was common in Old Master art--and among some
modern artists, such as Diego Rivera. The saintly procession
describes the highest potential for your own voyage through the
cathedral by depicting it in a pastiche on the surrounding walls.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the altar, seven tapestry panels attempt to relocate the
journey's end back in the everyday world. Their abstract pattern,
which is difficult to see unless you're up close, merges with a
street map of downtown L.A.--the Thomas Bros. guide to salvation.</TE>
<TE>   There's something almost Victorian at work in the cathedral's art
program--Mary as a fresh-faced girl, who's just stepped off Venice
Beach and pulled her hair back into a braid; a procession of saints
who range from John the Baptist in lion skins to the kid on your
street who's a skateboard fanatic. The art smuggles allegory back
into Moneo's modern architecture, from which it had been banished.</TE>
<TE>   This is where Vosko's program gets shallow, departing drastically
from Moneo's complex lead. Nava's multiethnic processional, Graham's
multi-paneled New World doors and Albuquerque's fountain of 37
languages simply aspire to document the Catholic community in all its
manifold variety.</TE>
<TE>   But art is never great simply because it represents community.
Instead, art is great when it creates community--when it acts as a
galvanizing force, bringing the infinite diversity of human beings
together in a cross-cultural act of astonishment and love. Passage
through Moneo's carefully articulated spaces physically embodies
spiritual mysteries associated with life, death and transcendence.
With the exception of Graham's evocative halo, which works much like
Moneo's concrete cross piercing an alabaster membrane, the art is
stuck in allegorical representations of them.</TE>
<TE>   The result is self-defeating. If you already believe, the art is
superficial. If you don't, there isn't much to see.</TE>

<LD>From Cardinal Roger M. Mahony rehearsing before a TelePrompTer to
engineers adjusting the flow of a waterfall, last-minute preparations
were being made Sunday for today's dedication of the new Cathedral of
Our Lady of the Angels.</LD>
<LD>   The $200-million, 12-story cathedral and conference center
overlooking the Hollywood Freeway will become the mother church of
the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles, the nation's largest.</LD>
<LD>   Pope John Paul II's ambassador to the United States, Apostolic
Pro-nuncio Gabriele Montalvo, and 10 U.S. cardinals arrived over the
weekend.</LD>
<TE>   They were expected to join nearly 700 bishops, priests and deacons
and more than 2,000 major donors, including business executives and
figures from the entertainment world, at the three-hour dedication
Monday. Also attending will be artists and sculptors who designed and
crafted the cathedral's works of art, along with representatives of
construction workers and local parishes.</TE>
<TE>   Others expected include the Spanish architect, Jose Rafael Moneo,
who designed the cathedral; the executive architect, Leo A. Daly; and
executives of Morley Construction Co.</TE>
<TE>   The service, which is to begin at 10 a.m., is by invitation only.
The cathedral will be open to the public Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the weekend, workers were positioning chairs in some of
the chapels, testing the public address system and polishing large
glass panes etched with the names of those who contributed. Across
the 2.5-acre plaza, other workers were busy getting the conference
center's gift shop and cafe ready.</TE>
<TE>   Among those preparing for the big day was Mahony, who was using
TelePrompTers Friday to read his inaugural homily in the
58,000-square-foot cathedral, which was empty except for a few
workers.</TE>
<TE>   "Every minute there's something new, and something changed from
the minute before," said an archdiocese spokesman, Tod Tamberg.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony, the archbishop of Los Angeles who has overseen the
cathedral's planning and construction, was scheduled to host a dinner
Sunday night for 10 of his fellow cardinals and 56 bishops at his
residence on the cathedral grounds. Mahony and his auxiliary bishops
gave them a personal tour of the cathedral Sunday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, demonstrators were expected to gather nearby
just off the cathedral grounds for candlelight vigils. Some,
including members of the Catholic Worker, which operates a downtown
soup kitchen that serves the poor, said they would protest the
cathedral's cost.</TE>
<TE>   Others were expected to remind the church of its failure to
protect minors from sexually abusive priests and bishops. But another
group, El Sembrador, a Latino Catholic evangelization group, said it
would be on hand to lend its support to Mahony and the church.</TE>
<TE>   Noel Diaz, director of El Sembrador, said members would carry
signs that read: "Cardinal Mahony, Our Prayers Are With You."</TE>
<TE>   Police planned to close off Temple Street between Grand Avenue and
Hill Street from 1 a.m. to 8 p.m. today. The block of Temple directly
in front of the cathedral plaza has been designated for television
broadcast trucks. Hill Street and Grand Avenue will remain open, but
there will be one less lane on Hill for through traffic. Chain-link
fences were erected Sunday around the county buildings across Temple
from the cathedral.</TE>

<LD>Two priests have been disciplined for not telling the Bridgeport
Roman Catholic Diocese they knew the whereabouts of a former
clergyman accused of sex abuse.</LD>
<LD>   Father David Howell of Norwalk and Father Gerald Devore of
Stamford admitted they knew former priest Laurence Brett was living
on the Caribbean island of St. Martin, the diocese said in a
statement.</LD>
<LD>   Brett, 65, has been accused of abusing two dozen children in
Connecticut, New Mexico, California and Maryland. He disappeared in
1993; he was found recently on St. Martin by newspaper reporters.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The largest team of investigators since the FBI began checking for
anthrax at the former headquarters of the National Enquirer descended
on American Media Inc.'s offices, beginning a 12-hour shift, police
officer Jeff Kelly said.</LD>
<LD>   Officials wouldn't say how many people were in the Boca Raton
building or if any evidence had been found since crews in protective
gear reentered the building Friday for the first time since last
fall's contamination. The investigation will continue until Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   The teams hope to find a letter or package that carried the
anthrax bacteria into the building and fatally infected photo editor
Bob Stevens. FBI investigators also want to compare anthrax spores
with spores found in letters sent to the Washington offices of Sens.
Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont and Tom Daschle of South Dakota.</LD>

<HD>Football Team Courted on 2 Fronts</HD>
<DH>New Jersey: Hopewell voted against funding the sport at its
high school. Then private money was raised to field a squad. Then
there was a lawsuit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ZUCCHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOPEWELL, N.J.</DL>
<LD>It's almost football season, and the Hopewell Valley High Bulldogs
are hard at it, grunting and sweating through drills on a
sun-scorched field in their glimmering new gold-and-black jerseys and
helmets.</LD>
<LD>   The team will soon go head-to-head with the Princeton High Tigers,
the Lawrence High Cardinals, and its fiercest competition, a team
called HOV.</LD>
<LD>   That would be Honor Our Vote, a group of angry Hopewell Township
taxpayers that is determined to kill off the first football team at
the high school in 70 years. Saying the new team violates a school
budget vote last year in which residents rejected football 2 to 1,
the group has filed a formal complaint with a state judge asking him
to shut down the Bulldogs.</LD>
<TE>   The team was born this summer after a group of parents calling
itself HIKE--Hopewell Involved in Kids Enrichment--raised $69,044 and
received school board approval for the sport. HIKE says it will pay
the full football budget for the first two seasons, 75% the third
year and half the fourth year.</TE>
<TE>   HOV responded with the legal complaint, touching off a battle as
bruising as anything on the gridiron. Each side has fielded lawyers,
Web sites, fund-raisers and a barrage of letters to the editor.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is the fundamental purpose of public education in a
nation where high school football is a cherished institution but
where the interests of taxpayers often trump the most hallowed
traditions.</TE>
<TE>   The taxpayer group says the township can't afford football, which
it says fosters an unhealthy jock culture, detracts from academics
and girls' sports, and can cause serious injuries. A local newspaper
has called the group "class snobs."</TE>
<TE>   The parent group says it is unfair to deny the sport to boys who
are desperate to play and eager to learn sportsmanship and teamwork
at a school where the last varsity football team was snuffed out by
the Depression in 1932. With more than 1,000 students, Hopewell
Valley was the state's largest high school with no football team.
Once a rural area near Princeton and Trenton, the township now is a
growing, well-to-do suburb.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of a snobby thing--they're afraid of a 'football
mentality,' " said Kaye Yeisley, the mother of 6-foot-2, 240-pound
James, 15, jersey No. 51 in your program, as she watched her son
labor through practice.</TE>
<TE>   "They can get pretty nasty, especially if you're not in that
Hopewell clique," Cherie Stevulak, mother of Stephen, 14, jersey No.
35, said of the taxpayer group. "They think football players are
dummies."</TE>
<TE>   Mary Ellen Curtin, an HOV founder and the mother of two young
girls in the school system, says the group has been unfairly
characterized as mean-spirited and anti-egalitarian. She calls
herself a "football atheist."</TE>
<TE>   "It's more acceptable in American society to say you don't believe
in God than to say you don't believe in football," Curtin said.</TE>
<TE>   In a 10-page treatise she wrote for her group's Web site, Curtin
listed her personal objections to football: It already has been voted
down. It robs girls' sports of resources. It's dangerous. And it's
too costly.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a deep concern about football's effect on academics and
its social aspects, where it can foment jocks-versus-geeks kinds of
divisions," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Caught in the middle is the school board. Board President Sally
Turner said the April 2001 budget ballot, in which voters rejected
football along with lacrosse and freshman softball, applied only to
the 2001-02 school year.</TE>
<TE>   "We have every legal right to do what we've done," she said. Asked
why opponents want to kill a team paid for by private funds, Turner
replied: "You'd have to ask them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A 'Constitutional Issue'</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Dutko, a retired cabinetmaker and co-founder of HOV, said
even a privately funded football program eventually could cost
taxpayers $300,000 to $400,000 for a new field, lights, bleachers,
referees and so on. He called the dispute a "constitutional issue,"
saying the school board had thumbed its nose at voters.</TE>
<TE>   "The board has violated the democratic process," said Dutko, who
has put six children through the school system.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a World War II vet, and a lot of my buddies died fighting for
democratic rights. Now an elected school board is denying those
rights."</TE>
<TE>   Dutko said he doesn't hate football. "I love the game. I watch pro
football every Sunday," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A New Jersey administrative law judge will rule on the HOV
complaint, which was referred by the aptly named Bureau of
Controversies and Disputes of the state education department. After
hearing arguments by both sides, the judge will make a recommendation
to the state's education commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish they'd rule right now, because we haven't done anything
wrong," said Kris Kley, treasurer of the parent group. "It's not like
we're asking for a rifle club."</TE>
<TE>   Kley, a mother of two grade-school boys, said her group is holding
an auction and a carwash to raise more money.</TE>
<TE>   The group's Web site features a "Myths vs. Facts" feature that
says football is not too expensive, not too dangerous, doesn't
require a new stadium or lights, and fosters school spirit,
self-esteem and discipline.</TE>
<TE>   The team is considered "sub-varsity" because it is open only to
ninth-and 10th-graders. It will play afternoon home games on an
unlighted Pop Warner field owned by the township.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Dave Caldwell, a special education teacher who was pulling
new practice uniforms and helmets out of boxes on the field last
week, said his players keep asking him why the taxpayer group is
trying to kill off their nascent team.</TE>
<TE>   "I just tell them we have thousands of people who do support us,
so let's just focus on the positive," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Few Vets on Team</TE>
<TE>   Of the 52 boys who have joined the team, Caldwell said, only 17
have ever played organized football. On the other hand, he has two
300-pounders, a 225-pound wrestler at fullback and a playbook with a
few simple formations.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's just say I'm prioritizing right now," Caldwell said.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Zsenak, 15, a tight end, said the controversy is the main
subject of discussion at the dinner table and on the practice field.
"Some of the guys say these people are nuts," he said of the taxpayer
group. "Maybe it's just people who don't have kids in the school
system and don't want to pay anything."</TE>
<TE>   Takis Tzetzos, 15, a 6-foot-3, 290-pound tackle, said players are
trying not to think about the possibility of being shut down.</TE>
<TE>   "We just want to play," he said, "and maybe win enough games to
prove these people wrong."</TE>

<HD>Blood Supplies Free of West Nile, Officials Say</HD>
<DH>Health: Possibility virus was transmitted during transplant
investigated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Health officials said Sunday that they believe the nation's blood
supply is safe from West Nile virus, even though they are
aggressively investigating what might be the first known transmission
of the disease through tainted blood or tissues.</LD>
<LD>   The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta
was rushing blood and tissue specimens Sunday from various donors to
a laboratory in Fort Collins, Colo., to try to determine whether a
woman who died Aug. 1 in a Georgia car accident was a carrier of the
West Nile virus and, if so, how she contracted it.</LD>
<LD>   The woman donated four of her organs. One of the recipients, a
71-year-old man, died Thursday of encephalitis, a swelling of the
brain that is the most severe of the virus' possible symptoms. Two
other recipients appear to have encephalitis, and the fourth has a
fever, CDC officials said.</LD>
<TE>   James Hughes, director of the CDC's National Center for Infectious
Diseases, said Sunday that the organ donor received numerous blood
transfusions before she died. He said the CDC hopes to determine
whether she contracted West Nile virus from those transfusions.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, he said, the CDC and health officials in Georgia and
Florida are trying to determine whether the four transplant
recipients have the virus and, if so, how they contracted it. So far,
only one of the organ recipients has a confirmed case of the disease.
But the man who died Thursday also tested positive for exposure to
flavivirus, the family to which West Nile belongs, Hughes said.</TE>
<TE>   All 638 known cases of West Nile in the United States this year,
including 31 deaths, are believed to have resulted from mosquito
bites.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes said blood banks have been ordered to withdraw all blood
products from donors whose blood was transfused into the Georgia
woman. A Georgia health official said some of those products already
have been transfused into other people. Investigators have obtained
specimens from about two-thirds of the donors involved.</TE>
<TE>   If it turns out that West Nile virus was transmitted by blood or
tissue products, the CDC will work with researchers to develop a
"rapid, sensitive and specific" test for West Nile virus in blood,
Hughes said.</TE>
<TE>   No such test currently exists.</TE>

<HD>Cutting Taxes During Wartime Defies American Tradition</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald Brownstein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Is America at peace or at war? The Bush administration seems to want
it both ways.</LD>
<LD>   Vice President Dick Cheney spent last week warning that the United
States faced a mortal threat from Iraq and strongly suggesting the
nation would soon have to mount a full-scale war to depose Saddam
Hussein. That followed months of President Bush
asserting--correctly--that America is already in a state of war
against international terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   But, as the New Republic recently reported, Mitch Daniels, the
administration's shrewd budget director, took a very different tack
on PBS' Charlie Rose show the other day. Defending the $1.35-trillion
tax cut Bush pushed through Congress last year, Daniels argued that,
"Americans are being taxed at the highest peacetime rates in
history."</LD>
<TE>   So which is it, wartime or peacetime? Daily life may still feel
like peacetime. But the federal budget is definitely moving toward a
wartime footing. After Sept. 11, Bush proposed and Congress approved
a rapid increase in defense spending; by the middle of this decade,
Bush wants to spend over $100 billion a year more on the Pentagon
than President Clinton proposed in his final budget.</TE>
<TE>   A war in Iraq would add to those costs. The last war against
Hussein cost about $60 billion. Lawrence J. Korb, an assistant
secretary of Defense for manpower under President Reagan, says a
second Gulf War wouldn't cost as much initially because it would
probably require fewer troops.</TE>
<TE>   But an unexpectedly long war would increase the financial (not to
mention, human) cost. And, Korb notes, the cost of reconstructing a
post-Saddam Iraq would add to the final bill--to the point where he
believes a second war in the Gulf would ultimately cost as much as
the first.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the cost of hardening American defenses against
terrorism. This year, Bush is seeking $38 billion in federal spending
for homeland security, about double the amount two years ago.
Thumbing through the national strategy for homeland security the
White House published this summer, it's clear the administration
envisions those numbers rising further.</TE>
<TE>   The plan is filled with big-ticket ambitions: developing "smart
borders," "recapitalizing" the Coast Guard, inventing a new
generation of vaccines and massively increasing federal support for
local emergency agencies. None of that will be cheap.</TE>
<TE>   Why then does Daniels want to pretend the nation is at peace?
Because the administration is engaged in a project unprecedented in
American history: trying to cut taxes in wartime. In all previous
conflicts, Washington has raised taxes to pay for the war. Americans
may have grumbled, but they have unfailingly accepted that burden as
the contribution they make to support those on the front line.</TE>
<TE>   The first income tax was imposed to pay for the Civil War. To fund
World War I, the top income tax rate was increased from 7% to 77%. In
World War II, the income tax was deepened and broadened. Washington
hiked the top rate to 91% and exposed more Americans than ever before
to the tax by limiting deductions and exemptions. Before the war,
just 4 million Americans paid income taxes.</TE>
<TE>   By 1945, the number was 43 million. Income taxes rose again for
the wars in Korea and Vietnam. That's how ordinary Americans
contribute when their neighbors are under fire.</TE>
<TE>   Compare that to Bush's posture today. Even after 9/11 precipitated
all of these huge new costs, he's rejected all calls to delay the
further installments of his tax cut due in 2004 and 2006. Instead,
he's pushing to make the tax cut permanent (in a bit of fiscal
legerdemain, Congress voted to let it expire after 2010).</TE>
<TE>   And now, he's mulling a new wave of tax cuts aimed at investors,
including increased deductibility for stock market losses, reduced
taxation on corporate dividends and possibly a cut in the tax rate on
capital gains--a proposal his campaign rejected through the 2000
election for fear it would be seen as benefiting the wealthy. Just
the capital gains cut could cost an additional $50 billion over 10
years.</TE>
<TE>   All of this comes against the backdrop of what might be the most
rapid deterioration in the government's balance sheets in the
nation's history. When Bush took office, the nonpartisan
Congressional Budget Office projected that Washington would run
surpluses totaling $5.6 trillion from 2002 through 2011. Last week,
the CBO reported that the tax cut, the war and the recession have
shriveled the cumulative surplus over that period to just $336
billion. Siegfried and Roy or David Copperfield couldn't make the
money disappear that fast.</TE>
<TE>   And even that bleak figure understates the damage. The CBO
estimate assumes the tax cut expires in 2010. If it's extended, the
agency calculates the government would take in nearly $700 billion
less through 2012--enough to push Washington into the red over the
full decade.</TE>
<TE>   All of these figures would look far worse if Congress and Bush
weren't tapping the funds raised for Social Security to run the rest
of government. Remember the lockbox? In 2000, Bush, Al Gore and both
parties in Congress pledged to set aside the surplus in Social
Security to pay down the national debt. Now, the operating portion of
the federal budget has fallen so deeply into the red that Washington
through this decade will have to divert more than $2 trillion in
taxes raised for Social Security to fund general government
operations, everything from education to homeland security to
defense.</TE>
<TE>   That broken promise means the Social Security money isn't
available to pay down the debt.</TE>
<TE>   When Bush took office, the CBO projected that the United States
could pay off virtually all of the publicly held federal debt--for
the first time since Andrew Jackson's administration in the 1830s--by
this decade's end. Its latest figures show the federal debt will
remain above $3 trillion through at least 2011.</TE>
<TE>   More debt means higher federal interest costs ($1.3 trillion more
in the next decade alone, the CBO calculates). In time, that will
mean higher taxes on our children.</TE>
<TE>   This is a form of generational robbery. It's bad enough when we
choose to cut taxes on ourselves rather than lighten the burden of
debt on our children. But it's breathtaking to pass on to our
children, through a larger national debt, the cost of defending our
country. Are we really that much more selfish than the generations of
Americans who paid their fair share to defend freedom every time it
was threatened before?</TE>

<HD>U.S. Drug Operation Funded Terrorist Groups in Middle East,
Authorities Say</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>For the first time, federal authorities have amassed evidence that an
illegal drug operation in the U.S. was funneling money to Middle East
terrorist groups such as Hezbollah, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Evidence gathered by the Drug Enforcement Administration since a
series of raids in January indicates that a methamphetamine drug
operation in the Midwest involving men of Middle Eastern descent has
been sending money to terrorist groups.</LD>
<LD>   "There is increasing intelligence information from the
investigation that for the first time alleged drug sales in the
United States are going in part to support terrorist organizations in
the Middle East," DEA chief Asa Hutchinson said Friday.</LD>
<TE>   DEA officials said the men, most of whom were indicted on drug
charges after their January arrests, were smuggling large quantities
of the chemical pseudoephedrine from Canada into the Midwest.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the smuggling mainly went through Chicago and
Detroit, and involved men with ties to Jordan, Yemen, Lebanon and
other Mideast countries. There is no evidence that any money was
connected to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Pseudoephedrine is used in some popular cold and allergy
medications. It is an essential ingredient in making methamphetamine.</TE>

<HD>Cathedral Embodies Spiritual Journey</HD>
<DH>Design: Our Lady of the Angels reflects the city's effort
to find a communal identity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Austere and slightly atavistic in its mysticism, the new Cathedral of
Our Lady of the Angels is a landmark of remarkable architectural
intelligence.</LD>
<LD>   Designed by the Spanish firm Jose Rafael Moneo Architects, with
Los Angeles-based Leo A Daly Architects, the cathedral will be
unveiled at an elaborate dedication today. The grandeur of its
interior will instantly make it the city's most glorious public
space. In its beauty, it is the equal of the Getty Museum's
celebrated glass rotunda. In its heroic scale, it embodies L.A.'s
slow shift from a place of stubborn individualism to one that is
struggling to find its communal identity.</LD>
<LD>   The design's power stems from its aura of timelessness. Few
structures have been able to express the long arc of architectural
history--from antiquity through classical Modernism--with such
crystalline clarity.</LD>
<TE>   Fewer still have sought to create such a seamless spiritual
journey from outer to inner worlds. That Moneo accomplishes this feat
in a city known for its relentless obsession with the future verges
on the miraculous.</TE>
<TE>   Moneo has said that his design was influenced by the traditional
cathedral plazas of his native Spain, as well as of South America.
The complex is divided into two main components, stretching out over
an entire city block from Grand Avenue to Hill Street and between
Temple Street and the Hollywood Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   The cathedral stands at the block's southwest corner. The long,
low form of the two buildings that house the cathedral offices,
meeting rooms and residence anchor the block's eastern edge.
Together, the two structures frame a vast plaza, creating a sacred
precinct that seems almost archaic.</TE>
<TE>   Normally, such traditional plazas are rooted in the life of the
city. In Venice, Italy, for example, pedestrians weave their way
through a maze of narrow alleyways before they reach San Marco
Square. Once you step through its arcades, the sense of openness is
explosive.</TE>
<TE>   Moneo's plaza, by comparison, seems to have crashed down from a
distant world. There is a pedestrian entrance on Temple Street, but
most visitors probably will arrive by car, quickly dip into the
parking lot and rise to the dazzling plaza by escalator. The streets
and the freeway below are irrelevant.</TE>
<TE>   Civic leaders have touted the cathedral as a major addition to the
cultural corridor flowering along Grand Avenue. In fact, the
cathedral, oriented toward its cloistered plaza, virtually ignores
Grand. Seen from the avenue, its heavy, block-like forms have a
tendency to fade into the inferior 1960s-era Modernist buildings that
surround it. The saw-tooth pattern of its massive clerestory window,
meanwhile, gives the facade an introverted quality, as if it were
oblivious to the natural order of daily life.</TE>
<TE>   Yet that indifference to context is also quintessentially Los
Angeles. It represents accepted wisdom about how to create public
space in a suburban landscape without a true sense of center, whose
communal tissue remains, to a large degree, its freeways and shopping
malls. Most architects, when faced with such realities, have simply
walled themselves off from them. The result is often a place like the
Grove at Farmers Market--a new high-end, open-air mall--or CityWalk:
faux urban fragments embedded in a sea of parking. Richard Meier's
Getty Center, modeled on Italian precedents, is effectively the
same--a vision of cultural purity perched on a bucolic mountaintop.</TE>
<TE>   Moneo's best work tends to be rooted in the historical context of
his native Europe. In the 1986 National Museum of Roman Art in
Merida, Spain, for example, the structure's blank, brick form rests
gently on top of the Roman ruins. In Murcia, the delicately rendered
facade of his City Hall annex building, completed in 1999, faces a
brooding Baroque cathedral. Such works create a palpable tension
between new and old.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the cathedral, withdrawal becomes a virtue. Moneo's
interest is not in themed environments. Nor is it in local
architectural traditions. His aim is to create an inner voyage, one
that draws you away from the commercial pollution and visual noise of
contemporary urban life and into a more contemplative world.</TE>
<TE>   That journey is breathtaking, and it begins at the plaza.</TE>
<TE>   The first stop is a small entry court, which is set slightly below
plaza level at the edge of Temple Street and in front of the parish
buildings. The court breaks the rhythm just as you enter the plaza,
framing a view of one corner of the cathedral's facade.</TE>
<TE>   From here, the cathedral becomes a composition of dynamic planes,
its forms folding back to heighten the play of light and exaggerate
the building's upward thrust. A thin plane of concrete folds across
the top to hold the eye. An immense cross, fashioned out of concrete
and glass, breaks through the cornice line.</TE>
<TE>   Once you've caught your breath, you must choose one of two broad
stairways. One leads to the cathedral doors, the other to the center
of the plaza. Venture onto the plaza, and the facade seems to flatten
out, becoming more stoic and imposing. The effect gives the expansive
outdoor plaza, shaded by a few scattered palms, a calculated air of
tranquillity.</TE>
<TE>   The main path, however, runs along the plaza's edge, to the
church. Across the threshold, a long ambulatory leads alongside the
main worship space toward the back of the structure. The walls
converge slightly, creating a forced perspective, a visual trick that
makes the space seem longer than it is.</TE>
<TE>   It is here that Moneo's mastery of composition and form reaches
its peak. A row of chapels stretches out to the right, shielding the
view of the main worship space. The walls dividing the chapels have
an asymmetrical rhythm--some close together, others farther
apart--that gives them a musical aura. Slots between the chapels
allow for carefully framed views into the main sanctuary. Light
filtering through the enormous alabaster clerestory spills down into
the chapels from above.</TE>
<TE>   But this is only a tease. Once you reach the back of the
ambulatory, you turn abruptly, and the entire cathedral suddenly
opens up to you. The room is built at the scale of the city. Above
the altar, the cross-shaped window reappears, its concrete-and-glass
form breaking through the facade in a sort of spiritual epiphany.</TE>
<TE>   If this sequence of spaces has an architectural equivalent, it is
Frank Lloyd Wright's 1905 Unity Temple in Oak Park, Ill. But Wright's
version is much more compact. Visitors enter and turn abruptly, then
suddenly turn again, before slipping into the sanctuary. In Moneo's
cathedral, that experience is carefully drawn out so that it takes on
a different meaning. The architecture is measured to the pace of the
mind's eye, and with each step you are forced to make a mental
adjustment, as if purging yourself of trivial distractions.</TE>
<TE>   That sense of displacement comes to a halt in the main sanctuary.
The floor is slightly raked and the walls open up toward the altar.
The effect is the reverse of that in the ambulatory, shortening the
distance to the altar, and locking you in your place. Muscular
concrete pillars that house the chapels rise up on either side.</TE>
<TE>   The crushing weight of the pillars embodies an idea of permanence
that is a bold challenge to L.A.'s faith in a disposable, consumer
society. But Moneo also softens this effect, and the space has an
ethereal, otherworldly quality. The room's asymmetrical forms seem to
carve through space. The polished concrete surfaces--stained a sandy
yellow--are silky to the touch. Above, the patterned wood surface of
the ceiling sags down like the belly of a whale, which helps give the
room an unexpected warmth.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, this was still too much aloofness for archdiocese
officials, who have cluttered the space with unfortunate details in
an effort to bring it back down to earth. The chandeliers, in
particular, are atrocious. Their ornate bronze fixtures nearly
destroy the visual lines of the interior. The John Nava-designed
tapestries should have reinforced the abstraction of the
architecture. Instead, they fight with it. It's best to ignore them.</TE>
<TE>   Upon leaving this room, Moneo eases you back into the world. A
secondary ambulatory leads along a tranquil garden, which is visible
through an 80-foot-long window. The campanile rises in the
background, punctuating the view. Stepping back out onto the plaza,
the bustle of life begins to overtake you again. Sounds of the
freeway float up from below. California's harsh, golden light shakes
you from your reverie.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Moneo's architecture has left a lasting mark. If it
struggles to find its place in the city, its intent is to offer a
refuge from it. The relentless flow of Los Angeles' sprawling
landscape is momentarily lessened. In its place is a monument to
spiritual communion that certainly ranks among the great
architectural achievements in recent American history.</TE>

<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>After this country's first steps toward political union, the new
Cabinet is mapping out an ambitious plan for economic unity, senior
government officials said Sunday, including a new currency and a
banking system aimed at persuading foreigners and Afghan emigres to
bring and keep their money here.</LD>
<LD>   The details and timing of the new afghani remain a secret, but a
high-ranking government official said the national currency would
replace a hodgepodge of new and old Afghan notes and reduce the need
for the welter of foreign currencies--U.S. dollars, Pakistani rupees
and Emirati dirhams--now used for major transactions.</LD>
<LD>   Currently, the nation is limping along without a formal banking
system and with business and consumer transactions carried out
exclusively in cash. Visitors are forced to bring large amounts of
paper money because credit cards aren't accepted and checks can't be
redeemed. A law being drawn up would pave the way for banks to open
for business.</LD>
<TE>   "One of the main reasons we are undertaking the exercise of
introducing the new afghani is to reform the banking system. This
will be the main focus of a lot of attention in the next few days,"
said Omar Samad, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry.</TE>
<TE>   "The process will take time ... before all the old money is
collected and exchanged with new money," Samad said. "You will
obviously need to keep the economy going at the same time. We do not
want anyone inside or outside of Afghanistan who may hold large, huge
reserves of afghanis to cause any kind of [speculative] mishap."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the country is struggling from day to day to pay its
employees. Finance Minister Ashref Ghani has warned that if
international donors fail to live up to pledges of $1.8 billion in
aid this year he might be forced to cut back the nation's already
minuscule $460-million annual budget.</TE>
<TE>   "Under this kind of system, you divide a limited pie among a large
number of claimants, none of whom is satisfied," Ghani, 53, a former
World Bank social scientist who has also taught at Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore, said in an interview Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Vowing to balance the budget without borrowing or printing extra
currency, he said that he will make further spending cuts if the
promised aid fails to materialize in time.</TE>
<TE>   Over the long term, Ghani is confident that, with a responsible
economic policy, Afghanistan can generate enough revenue from mining,
oil and gas production, and agriculture to prosper and significantly
improve the health and well-being of its people. It's the country's
immediate needs, amid the chaos and devastation resulting from
decades of war, that concern him.</TE>
<TE>   "Afghanistan was freed from a reign of terror due to a partnership
of Afghans and the coalition," he said, referring to the U.S.-led
effort that drove out the hard-line Islamic Taliban regime last fall.
"Rebuilding Afghanistan is also an issue of partnership with the
international community. Redevelopment and prosperity can only be
achieved through this partnership."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most pressing reason for fiscal stability is to make
the currency uniform. In some parts of the country formerly
controlled by the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance, one version of the
afghani circulates that is worth approximately 80,000 to the dollar.
In the south, where a different, government-produced afghani
circulates, its official value is closer to 40,000 to the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   The two bills are virtually identical, but Afghans by necessity
have learned to look carefully to see the subtle differences. Only
foreigners, it appears, sometimes make costly mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   Another problem with the current cash mixture is that there is no
way for the central bank to determine how much national currency is
in circulation.</TE>
<TE>   "We have several currencies, not a single one," a government
source said. "Our currency has lost its value and the respect of the
people."</TE>
<TE>   Because they have so little value, the current bills are also
cumbersome to use. The biggest bill in circulation, a 10,000-afghani
note, is worth only 25 U.S. cents, and a stack of them worth $100
would snugly fill a school lunch box.</TE>
<TE>   The source said the current plan is to have the currency float
freely and not be pegged to either the dollar or the euro. This
source said the currency would be backed by Afghanistan's
reserves--which include $200 million in gold held by the U.S. Federal
Reserve Bank in New York plus additional gold and hard currency
inside Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   But the source said confidence in the currency would spring not so
much from the reserves as from the "prudential fiscal management" of
the new government, which has pledged to be open and accountable in
all its financial dealings.</TE>
<TE>   "Currency is psychology," the source said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a package of banking legislation is being drafted that
will permit the licensing of new private banks, and two international
banks will be invited to set up shop in Afghanistan, Ghani said. Half
a dozen banks have been proposed.</TE>
<TE>   A banking system both fuels and lubricates an economy. The
availability of credit is a major factor in economic growth and
opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   Samad, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund stand ready to help create the Afghan
banking system.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan is also joining a worldwide funds-transfer system for
banks, known as SWIFT, that will allow normal bank transfers to the
country for the first time since the Taliban took over in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   This, in turn, will allow better-off Afghan families in exile to
come home, secure in the knowledge that they will be able to receive
remittances from friends or relatives overseas, said Noorullah
Delawari, a former California banker who is now an advisor to the
central bank.</TE>
<TE>   A retired Afghan American executive from La Canada Flintridge, who
for years directed the international banking division of Lloyds Bank
California in Los Angeles, Delawari returned to Afghanistan earlier
this year after more than three decades abroad with the hope of
establishing his own commercial bank.</TE>
<TE>   Upon learning that the banking laws were not yet written, he
allowed himself to be drafted as an advisor to the Finance Ministry.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a privilege to be able to come here and do things which are
significant," said Delawari, 58.</TE>
<TE>   One potential source of liquidity for the new banking system is
the wealth of Afghan citizens who are now abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Delawari estimated that about 200,000 Afghans remain in Pakistan
in part because they receive remittances totaling $30 million to $40
million a month from relatives in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   If reliable banks opened in Afghanistan capable of receiving
international transfers, he said, those people would feel free to
leave Pakistan and relocate permanently in their native land,
bringing their relative wealth--desperately needed at home--with
them.</TE>
<TE>   Rumors are already circulating on the streets here in the capital
about the imminent introduction of a new currency. Abdul Mobin,
plying his trade among the other denizens of the money-changing
district in the main bazaar, expressed skepticism about the
government's ability to carry off this conversion.</TE>
<TE>   "I am 100% confident they can't do it right. There is no good
information system or transportation. And people have no education
about how to manage money," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Mobin said, Afghanistan's "enemies" would work to undermine
the country's monetary stability. The afghani lost 5% of its official
value against the dollar Sunday, and Mobin said it is not unusual for
it to fluctuate wildly.</TE>
<TE>   But he had a gloomy prediction for the new currency, whenever it
is issued.</TE>
<TE>   "It will lose value.... We don't have an economy. We need to have
an economy to have a stable currency," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On the table in front of him, Mobin had a stack of afghanis about
3 feet high and 2 feet wide.</TE>
<TE>   "You see that mountain of money?" he asked. "It is not even worth
$1,000."</TE>

<HD>Refugee Sues Australia Over Detention Fees</HD>
<DH>Immigration: Man denied asylum is billed $14,250 for stay
in holding facility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD C. PADDOCK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SYDNEY, Australia</DL>
<LD>Shahid Qureshi paid a big price when he sought asylum in Australia.</LD>
<LD>   For six months, the 27-year-old Pakistani was locked up at a
detention center in Melbourne. He slept on an old mattress in a small
room with three other men. The entrance to the room had no door, and
guards came in frequently during the night to shine a flashlight in
his face and make sure he was still there. As many as 70 detainees
shared three showers and four toilets.</LD>
<LD>   When Qureshi was released on a temporary visa, the Australian
government presented him with a bill for his stay: $14,250.</LD>
<TE>   Making matters worse, the terms of his visa prohibit him from
working in Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Qureshi, a member of a militant Muslim group who claims he would
face persecution if he was sent back to Pakistan, filed suit against
the Australian government last Monday in Melbourne contending that
the bill, which he can't possibly pay, is an illegal tax and an
unjust confiscation of property.</TE>
<TE>   "No rational person would pay anything to be treated like that,"
said Julian Burnside, one of Qureshi's attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit is the first test of the government's practice of
billing all asylum seekers for the costs of their stay in detention.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike other countries, Australia has a policy of locking up any
asylum seeker who arrives without proper documentation. Since 1999,
when Iraqis and Afghans began, the government has incarcerated 9,400
asylum seekers, some of them for years. Of these, 8,000 have been
granted asylum.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say payment is normally waived for those who are granted
asylum. But asylum seekers who are denied entry to Australia are
billed for the costs of their detention, their legal proceedings and,
in many cases, their air fare home.</TE>
<TE>   During the last three years, according to the Immigration
Department, unsuccessful asylum seekers have been charged a total of
$18 million for their detention. Some have received bills for
$100,000 or more. That doesn't include the tab for court cases and
appeals, which can easily exceed $10,000.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say they do not really expect the asylum seekers to
pay, but those who don't will never get permission to come back to
Australia.</TE>
<TE>   "If they should ever wish to return to Australia, they would have
to pay that debt before they could get a visa," said Steve Ingram,
spokesman for Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock.</TE>
<TE>   Australia's system of mandatory detention for asylum seekers,
including children, has been widely criticized.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, Australia refused to let the Norwegian cargo ship
Tampa land with 433 asylum seekers it had picked up at sea after
their boat started sinking. Instead, the Australian navy shipped them
to a detention center on the remote South Pacific island of Nauru,
where most of them remain today.</TE>
<TE>   The government calls its strategy the "Pacific Solution" and says
its harsh approach has been successful in keeping asylum seekers out
of the country. No refugee boat has reached Australia since last
year.</TE>
<TE>   Qureshi's case is somewhat unusual. He arrived legally by airplane
in February 1998 on a student visa. After it expired, he stayed in
Australia illegally. He was detained in March 2001 and sent to the
Maribyrnong detention center in Melbourne.</TE>
<TE>   He applied for asylum, saying that as a member of the banned
Sipah-e-Sahaba group he would face persecution if he returned to
Pakistan. His application for asylum was denied and he appealed the
decision.</TE>
<TE>   Because he arrived in Australia legally, he was released while his
case was on appeal. As he left Maribyrnong last September, he was
handed the bill for his six-month stay.</TE>
<TE>   Qureshi's lawyers hope to put the government's treatment of
detainees on trial. They plan to present evidence of the conditions
in Australia's six detention centers to show that they are no better
than "an institutionalized system of abuse," said Josh Bornstein, one
of Qureshi's attorneys. "In Australia, a convicted pedophile is
treated more favorably than an asylum seeker who has committed no
crime," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Qureshi's attorneys declined to allow him to be interviewed. His
lawsuit contends that he was kept in a dormitory room that was too
small to accommodate the four people it held.</TE>
<TE>   The detainees had no privacy. Throughout the night, the lawsuit
alleges, guards came in every half-hour and shined their light in the
detainees' faces. Guards were aggressive and insulting, the lawsuit
contends. Toilets were often broken, and detainees sometimes had to
wait two hours for a shower.</TE>
<TE>   Qureshi was charged the equivalent of $79 a night for his stay.
For the money, Bornstein said, a guest could get better
accommodations at a top Melbourne hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Government officials defend the practice of billing asylum seekers
for their detention, saying that it is required by a 1979 law. "We
have an obligation to recover money for the taxpayers," said Ingram,
the minister's spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Ingram said the price of $79 a night is reasonable. Detainees get
three meals a day, medical treatment and the use of exercise
facilities, he noted.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Explosive devices killed at least five people and injured at least 20
others Sunday in three incidents in and around Kabul, the Afghan
capital.</LD>
<LD>   Three Afghans were killed and at least 17 hurt near Bagram air
base, north of here, when an antitank mine destroyed an ambulance.
The vehicle had been sent to collect the body of another Afghan, who
had just been killed when an antipersonnel mine detonated.</LD>
<LD>   The four people killed near Bagram had been working for the Afghan
Mine Clearance Planning Agency. Noor ul-Haq, the agency's deputy
director, said he suspected that someone planted the mine recently
because it went off on a road that was frequently used by his and
other agencies.</LD>
<TE>   There are still millions of undetected mines in Afghanistan, the
legacy of 10 years of Soviet occupation, later bloody internecine
fighting and six years of war between the Taliban and the opposition
Northern Alliance.</TE>
<TE>   The strategic air base, which serves as the main U.S. military
headquarters in Afghanistan, is heavily mined.</TE>
<TE>   An explosion in Kabul killed one person and injured three others,
including a British peacekeeper on patrol, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The device was in or under a four-wheel wooden pushcart when it
went off in front of the ruined former Soviet Embassy in the
southwestern part of the city, District Police Chief Gul Rahman said.</TE>
<TE>   The afternoon blast instantly killed one Afghan man. Two Afghan
civilians on bikes were hurt.</TE>
<TE>   One British peacekeeper who was passing in a patrol car at the
time of the explosion was hit in the wrist with shrapnel, said Maj.
Steve Odell, a spokesman for the International Security Assistance
Force. His injury was described as minor.</TE>
<TE>   Several foreign bomb disposal experts examined a crater in the
road left by the blast, but had not determined the explosion's cause.</TE>

<HD>Fox Extends Hand to Opposition in Mexico</HD>
<DH>Politics: In annual speech to nation, president shares
credit with rivals in Congress for successes but says, 'there is
still much to do.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Warning that Mexicans are growing impatient with democracy, President
Vicente Fox opened a new legislative session Sunday night with an
offer to work more closely with opposition parties that control
Congress and have blocked parts of his reform agenda.</LD>
<LD>   In his second annual Informe, the equivalent of a U.S. State of
the Union address, Fox said all political parties share credit for
his administration's gains--the relative stability of Mexico's
economy; advances against crime, corruption and poverty; and the
opening of the government to greater public scrutiny.</LD>
<LD>   But he acknowledged falling short of goals to make Mexico safer,
more prosperous, less corrupt and better educated--campaign promises
that two summers ago helped him end 71 years of authoritarian rule by
the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.</LD>
<TE>   "I know that Mexico demands better results. I know there is still
much to do," he said. "The conquests of democracy are gradual. They
are not achieved at once."</TE>
<TE>   The speech, carried live on national television, traditionally
takes stock of the president's achievements and spells out his goals.
In Fox's case, it was an opportunity to build bridges to his
adversaries.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike his predecessors from the PRI, who ruled with legislative
majorities, Fox has been thwarted by Congress. He is criticized for
failing to work hard enough at forging alliances with lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   The cost has been high. Congress ripped apart his attempt to
overhaul Mexico's ineffective tax system before passing a measure but
cutting by half the revenue he hoped to raise. Lawmakers watered down
his proposal to expand the rights of the country's 10 million
Indians, halting a peace process to end the 8-year-old Zapatista
uprising in southern Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Those battles, according to opinion surveys, have left Mexicans
feeling that their popular president is losing control of events.</TE>
<TE>   In recent days, the Mexican leader has adopted a more conciliatory
strategy. On Saturday, he held his second meeting of the week with
leaders of his own pro-business National Action Party, the PRI and
the leftist opposition Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD. The two
opposition parties together form majorities in the Senate and Chamber
of Deputies.</TE>
<TE>   All sides at the session said they agreed to seek consensus on
Fox's proposals, including a bill to open part of the
state-controlled electricity sector to private investment. That
proposal is at the top of his agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Fox told lawmakers Sunday that he was open to criticism of his
proposals in "constructive discussion." He warned against partisan
feuding as Congress approaches midterm elections next summer.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a citizenry that is getting impatient with the lack of
agreements ... that doesn't want confrontations," Fox said. "The
country faces challenges that exceed the capacity of any isolated
political force. Its transformation is possible only with the
participation of all of them."</TE>
<TE>   Scattered boos and hisses greeted parts of the speech, especially
a promise to protect Mexican farmers against newly subsidized U.S.
agricultural exports.</TE>
<TE>   "From lie to lie," read one banner unfurled by legislators. "The
countryside is still waiting."</TE>
<TE>   But there was also warm applause, and a measured formal response
by PRI Congresswoman Beatriz Paredes, speaker of the Chamber of
Deputies. While criticizing some presidential proposals, she said the
conflict between Fox and Congress is not insurmountable. "In Mexico,
there is no crisis of governability," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Fox and some PRI leaders have found common ground on the
electricity reform bill, isolating the smaller PRD in opposition to
it. PRD legislators walked out of the chamber during Paredes' speech,
protesting a deal between Fox's party and the PRI to allow only the
PRI to respond.</TE>
<TE>   Although Fox remains one of the few popular presidents in Latin
America, with a 61% approval rating, the euphoria among Mexicans over
his election has long given way to disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   Fox's bold promises to create 1 million jobs and expand the gross
domestic product by 7% each year have fallen victim to the U.S.
economic downturn. Tens of thousands of jobs have disappeared, and
Mexico's economy remains as flat as a tortilla.</TE>
<TE>   Fox insisted Sunday night that his administration is on track. He
was able to boast of 4.9% annual inflation, low interest rates and a
strong peso--an enviable record compared with the financial turmoil
unsettling much of Latin America. But he admitted that, under newly
refined measurements, 54% of Mexico's 100 million people live in
poverty--more than the previously accepted figure of 40%.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials, he said, have arrested the kingpins of
five major drug cartels, busted 20 kidnapping gangs and disciplined
10,500 corrupt public servants.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, he said, his administration has made public spending
more transparent, freed more than 1,500 unjustly held prisoners,
given the public greater access to secret government files, and
appointed a prosecutor to review disappearances of anti-government
activists in the 1970s and 80s.</TE>
<TE>   Fox promised that his anti-corruption drive would not become a
political "settling of scores" against the PRI.</TE>

<HD>Criticism of Israeli Army's Killing of Civilians Comes From
All Sides</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Even the Jewish nation's president wonders if
soldiers have become 'trigger-happy.' Defense minister orders probe
into airstrike.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>The killing of Palestinian children and other civilians in a string
of Israeli army operations unleashed unusual criticism Sunday of both
the military tactics employed in Israel's war with the Palestinians
and the political strategy guiding them.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli President Moshe Katsav wondered aloud if some of his
nation's troops had become "trigger-happy" after two incidents in
four days prompted statements of regret from the army for the deaths
of civilians.</LD>
<LD>   "The question as to whether the [army] was trigger-happy must be
examined," Katsav said during a tour of an Israeli Arab elementary
school on the first day of the school year. "If the army reaches the
conclusion that this was the case, it will decide what to do.... But
it would be hasty to draw conclusions now."</LD>
<TE>   Katsav's post is largely ceremonial, but his comments--coming from
a member of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's right-wing Likud
Party--were significant.</TE>
<TE>   Israel reoccupied the West Bank this year after a spate of suicide
bombings that claimed the lives of dozens of Israelis. Tanks and
troops control most Palestinian cities and enforce severe limitations
on Palestinians' ability to move about freely.</TE>
<TE>   By at least one measure, Israeli tactics have been successful.
Violence against Israelis has dropped off markedly, Defense Minister
Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said Sunday. Nearly four weeks have passed
without a suicide bombing, and no Israelis have been killed by
Palestinians inside Israel's borders in the same period.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's operations are at least partially responsible, according
to Ben-Eliezer and a number of military analysts. The house arrest of
hundreds of thousands of Palestinians and the actual arrests of
thousands more, plus the continued policy of hunting and killing
militants, have hindered efforts by Palestinian groups to mount new
attacks, the analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   "The pressure that Israel is applying on the ground has led to
fewer attempts to carry out attacks," Ben-Eliezer told Sunday's
Cabinet meeting, adding, however, that "the situation on the ground
is still not quiet."</TE>
<TE>   Another possible factor: Several key Palestinian figures,
including the new interior minister, have urged radical factions to
hold off attacks inside Israel for the time being, as Palestinians
engage in a wider debate over the direction of the struggle for
independence.</TE>
<TE>   At least publicly, the Islamic movement Hamas--responsible for
most suicide bombings--has made it clear it will not heed that call.
It has rejected any cease-fire and threatened to exact revenge for
recent killings by Israel. Still, there has not been a successful
bombing since a Palestinian Hamas member killed nine people when he
blew himself up on a bus in northern Israel on Aug. 4.</TE>
<TE>   But in its pursuit of suspects, the Israeli army has become
overzealous, Palestinians and some Israelis charged Sunday. In the
weeks since Aug. 4, 40 Palestinians have been killed, according to
the Palestine Red Crescent Society; the Israeli newspaper Haaretz
reported Sunday that about three-quarters of those were civilians.</TE>
<TE>   The figure includes five people killed Saturday in the West Bank
village of Tubas when Israeli combat helicopters fired missiles at a
car containing men suspected of planning terrorist attacks. Instead
of the intended target, two children and two teenagers were killed,
as well as one low-level gunman. (Palestinian hospital officials
Saturday identified the two teens as members of a militia. On Sunday,
they said the two apparently were friends of a gunman but did not
themselves appear on any Israeli wanted list.)</TE>
<TE>   Ben-Eliezer on Sunday ordered an investigation into the Tubas
airstrike. Few army-led investigations have resulted in the
prosecution or punishment of soldiers or officers.</TE>
<TE>   Early Sunday, four more unarmed Palestinians were killed by troops
in disputed circumstances near the southern West Bank city of Hebron.
The army said it was acting on information that an attack on a nearby
Jewish settlement was imminent, but Palestinians said the men were
killed in cold blood.</TE>
<TE>   The four men were shot in an orchard run by Jewish settlers. The
army said the men were attempting to infiltrate the settlement. Wire
cutters and a saw were found on the bodies, but no guns, the army
said.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians, however, said the men worked at the local quarry. A
co-worker, Ishaq Halika, said he saw soldiers round up the four men
and march them away. He heard screams, he said, and their bodies were
found later.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, an Israeli tank shell killed a Palestinian mother,
her two grown sons and a cousin in the Gaza Strip. On July 23,
Israeli warplanes dropped a 1-ton bomb on a Gaza City neighborhood,
killing the leader of Hamas' military wing and 14 other people,
including nine children.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian officials said the Israeli actions were clearly aimed
at derailing tentative steps toward ending the region's deadliest
violence in years. Many of the Israeli raids have occurred at times
of relative quiet and when there were hints of progress in efforts to
defuse tensions.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, Ben-Eliezer has met with senior Palestinian
security officials, and the two sides reached an initial agreement
for Israeli withdrawal from some parts of the West Bank and Gaza in
exchange for Palestinian steps against suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   But Sharon and the army undermine those contacts, Palestinian
Information Minister Yasser Abed-Rabbo said Sunday, demanding an
immediate halt to the talks in the aftermath of the new killings.</TE>
<TE>   Nahum Barnea, the dean of Israel's political columnists, used
unusually harsh terms to accuse the army's leadership of reckless
arrogance in no longer taking care not to harm civilians, women and
children. He said bellicose statements from the army's chief of
staff, Lt. Gen. Moshe Yaalon, are eroding the army's credibility and
discipline.</TE>
<TE>   "What is the use of heating things up by means of proactive
military operations?" Barnea asked on the front page of Israel's
largest-circulation newspaper, Yediot Aharonot. "The Palestinians
will respond with a wave of terror attacks, and in the midst of the
blood bath we will never know whether they intended to end terrorism
or not."</TE>

<HD>88 Dead After South Korea Typhoon</HD>
<DH>Asia: The death toll mounts as soldiers and disaster
officials search for the missing and begin cleaning up Rusa's damage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>The National Disaster Prevention Headquarters announced today that a
powerful typhoon that slammed into South Korea over the weekend left
more than 88 people dead and 70 missing.</LD>
<LD>   Word of the higher toll came as soldiers and disaster officials
struggled against mountains of mud and swollen rivers in an attempt
to find missing people who were reported swept away by the water or
buried in landslides.</LD>
<LD>   The disaster agency also said in a statement that property damage
so far stood at $262 million and that 27,474 people remained
evacuated from their homes.</LD>
<TE>   Typhoon Rusa--the Malay word for deer--dumped up to 36 inches of
rain over the weekend in eastern and southern South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   The typhoon left the peninsula Sunday afternoon, moving across the
east coast without causing further damage.</TE>
<TE>   Wind gusts of up to 127 mph had ripped up trees and knocked down
7,800 electricity poles, causing a blackout for 1.16 million
households. About 240,000 homes still did not have power Sunday, and
140,000 homes remained without telephone service.</TE>
<TE>   Parts of a field hockey stadium and other facilities built for the
Sept. 29-Oct. 14 Asian Games were wrecked. The games, Asia's
Olympics, are to be held in the southern port of Pusan, South Korea's
second-largest city.</TE>
<TE>   More than 17,000 houses and buildings were submerged, forcing
27,474 residents to take shelter at public buildings and schools.
Some began returning to mud-covered homes Sunday as rains subsided.</TE>
<TE>   Floods inundated 12,621 acres of farmland.</TE>
<TE>   President Kim Dae Jung convened an emergency Cabinet meeting
Sunday and ordered the government and military to mobilize personnel
and equipment for rescue and repair.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-disaster officials began clearing roads and railways that
were cut off by floods and landslides. Parts of three rail lines and
three highways remained closed late Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "Reports of casualties are coming in from everywhere. Considering
past typhoon damages, we believe the death toll would hover over
100," said a disaster official.</TE>
<TE>   Local media reported higher tolls, with up to 132 people dead or
missing.</TE>

<HD>Ousted Reformer Sweeps Back in Japan Election</HD>
<DH>Governorship: Easy win by Yasuo Tanaka deals blow to
assembly that kicked him out of office.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALERIE REITMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Ousted Gov. Yasuo Tanaka won his job back Sunday in a landslide
victory in Nagano prefecture, sending a message to political
opponents that residents of the central district want to limit public
works spending, the lifeblood of many Japanese communities.</LD>
<LD>   In an election widely watched in Japan and abroad, the
reform-minded Tanaka handily defeated five challengers to regain the
clear-glass governor's office he built at prefectural headquarters
after his election in 2000. The transparent walls were his metaphor
for the open government he wanted to create.</LD>
<LD>   But Tanaka lasted only 20 months before the local assembly
overwhelmingly voted "no confidence," kicking him out of office in
July. The 46-year-old Tanaka, a well-known author and playboy, had
little managerial experience, and his autocratic style didn't sit
well with the assembly in this consensus-oriented nation.</LD>
<TE>   Playing host to the 1998 Winter Olympics left the mountainous
prefecture staggering under a huge debt. Tanaka maintains that
additional projects such as unnecessary dams are compounding that
burden and compromising the future of the nation as well as the
prefecture. Earlier this year, he canceled two previously authorized
dam projects in Nagano, throwing the local assembly into a tizzy and
leading directly to his ouster.</TE>
<TE>   But whether the five dozen members of the assembly will accept the
voters' mandate to work with Tanaka is not yet clear. If they balk,
it may simply mean more political gridlock or even another
no-confidence vote. The assembly members do not face election again
until the spring.</TE>
<TE>   Tamotsu Shimozaki, leader of the assembly's largest faction, told
reporters Sunday that he hoped "Tanaka will prefer fair prefectural
politics through dialogue."</TE>
<TE>   Minoru Morita, a well-known political commentator, said Tanaka's
"energy and wisdom convinced the people in Nagano that he's
reliable."</TE>
<TE>   "He overpowered the assembly" by winning the election, Morita said
in a television interview. "The situation is the same as before the
no-confidence vote, but what's different is the assembly has lost its
power now."</TE>
<TE>   In an acceptance speech Sunday night, Tanaka vowed to continue
administrative reforms.</TE>
<TE>   "Today marks a major step to change Japan," he said.</TE>

<HD>Send U.N. Inspectors, Powell Says</HD>
<DH>Iraq: Secretary, declaring he's backed by Bush, appears to
contradict Cheney on need for arms searches. Policy experts see a
picture of discord.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SONNI EFRON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In a new sign of disarray within the Bush administration on Iraq
policy, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell on Sunday appeared to
contradict Vice President Dick Cheney by saying that America's "first
step" should be sending United Nations weapons inspectors back to
Baghdad.</LD>
<LD>   Cheney declared last week that it would be futile to return
inspectors to a country that has thwarted them for years. He argued
that what is needed is a preemptive military strike, not preventive
diplomacy.</LD>
<LD>   The apparent Powell-Cheney dispute came against a background of
escalating disagreement and uncertainty among senior members of
Congress, Republicans as well as Democrats, over whether to go to war
with Iraq. Foreign policy experts from previous administrations have
also joined the debate.</LD>
<TE>   Both Powell and Cheney claimed to speak for President Bush.
Confusion over the president's real intentions seemed to mount
further Sunday with a report in Newsweek magazine that Bush had not
told Cheney to rule out U.N. weapons inspectors and had not meant to
slam the door on diplomatic options.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has insisted that he has not made up his mind whether to
invade Iraq. But a chorus of foreign policy experts warned Sunday
that the administration's perhaps deliberate ambiguity on its war
plans is creating an image of internal discord.</TE>
<TE>   "What you have here is an administration where all the top people
are fighting for the president's ear, attention and views--and the
president isn't letting them know what he thinks. He remains AWOL on
this whole issue," said Ivo Daalder, a senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution think tank.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of a consistent message about the president's plans
"confuses Congress, the allies, the American public and even the
Republican Party, which is at loggerheads about whether and how to
move forward," Daalder said.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Holbrooke, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
called this a "summer of disarray" in the Bush camp.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of making the case unambiguously with a single group of
people singing from the same song sheet, they're singing at least, at
minimum, different lyrics to the same music," he said on "Fox News
Sunday." "They're undermining their own case, first by the disarray
... and secondly by their failure to recognize that they must seek
international approval [for military action against Iraq] through the
U.N. Security Council."</TE>
<TE>   And former Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger, who served
under the current president's father, noted a "disconnect" between
the vice president's assertion that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
poses an imminent threat of nuclear blackmail and the president's
insistence that he has not made up his mind to act.</TE>
<TE>   Eagleburger joined the growing group of advisors to the senior
Bush who are cautioning the junior Bush against taking military
action without allies and without exhausting diplomatic options.
Speaking on "Meet the Press," he questioned why, if the Bush
administration has compelling evidence that Hussein will soon have a
nuclear weapon, it has been unable to convince its allies.</TE>
<TE>   Also Sunday, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tarik Aziz said Iraq
would not allow the U.N. weapons inspection team headed by Hans Blix
back into Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a nonstarter because it's not going to bring about a
conclusion," Aziz said on "CNN's Late Edition With Wolf Blitzer."</TE>
<TE>   "We do not trust that Mr. Blix and his group are going to bring a
conclusion within a reasonable time so that the United States and
everybody in the world should know there are no weapons of mass
destruction in Iraq," Aziz said. "Is the return of inspection going
to stop the American attack on Iraq? There are doubts about that."</TE>
<TE>   Aziz repeated his invitation--already spurned--to allow members of
Congress accompanied by experts to inspect any suspected weapons
sites.</TE>
<TE>   House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) dismissed that
invitation.</TE>
<TE>   "Apparently, he would rather have amateurs than professionals,"
Armey said. "We need to have trained inspectors in there."</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials have worried that asking the U.N.
for yet another round of inspections in Iraq could ensnare the United
States in a technical morass that would resolve nothing but would
merely give Hussein more time to develop nuclear and other weapons of
mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   But former National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski said
Aziz's stance would make it easier for the United States to bring its
case before the U.N., which would almost certainly take the position
that Hussein would have to permit inspections. If he refused,
Brzezinski said, the U.S. might consider a total embargo of Iraq,
like the one mounted against Cuba in 1963, and, failing that,
military action.</TE>
<TE>   Powell, in an interview with the BBC, appeared to be signaling
that the U.S. would make one last attempt to force Iraq to comply
with the U.N. Security Council, which has designated Blix its chief
inspector.</TE>
<TE>   "The president has been clear that he believes weapons inspectors
should return," Powell said. "Iraq has been in violation of many U.N.
resolutions for most of the last 11 or so years. And so, as a first
step, let's see what the inspectors find. Send them back in. Why are
they being kept out?"</TE>
<TE>   A White House spokesman insisted that there was no conflict
between Powell's and Cheney's views and that the Bush administration
position is to demand "unfettered" inspection of facilities where
Iraq might be producing weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   "It's what we've been saying all along," said spokesman Scott
McClellan.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the torrent of unsolicited advice to Bush from across the
political spectrum, a consensus appeared to emerge Sunday that the
president needs to do a better job of making his case to the public,
to Congress, to U.S. allies and to the world.</TE>
<TE>   Powell acknowledged the necessity of addressing international
concerns, saying: "The world has to be presented with the
information, with the intelligence that is available. A debate is
needed within the international community so that everybody can make
a judgment about this."</TE>
<TE>   Holbrooke said the United States needs a fresh resolution from the
U.N. to replace the 12-year-old measure that authorized the use of
force to evict Iraq's army from Kuwait in the Persian Gulf War. But
he said a new resolution should mandate "airtight, no-notice,
anywhere, any time inspections" and should authorize "any means
necessary" to enforce them.</TE>
<TE>   Holbrooke called it unlikely that Hussein would agree to such an
airtight clause. He said that if inspectors go in, "sooner or later
he will violate it ... and then we'll have the cause for war."</TE>
<TE>   Newsweek described a videoconference last week in which Bush,
Cheney and White House Chief of Staff Andrew H. Card Jr. discussed
the speech the vice president was about to give to the Veterans of
Foreign Wars convention in Nashville. In that discussion, the
president reportedly did not include rejecting arms inspectors among
the points the vice president would make.</TE>
<TE>   The magazine said administration officials later worried that
Cheney's public rejection of inspectors made the president look
duplicitous in saying he has made no decision.</TE>

<HD>Online Bullies Give Grief to Gamers</HD>
<DH>Internet: Troublemakers play to make their peers cry,
driving away customers and profit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Kurt Frerichs comes home from a long day of fixing computers, he
likes to eat dinner with his family, tuck his 2-year-old daughter
into bed and settle in front of his PC with a steaming cup of black
coffee to inflict nonstop misery on his fellow man.</LD>
<LD>   The 25-year-old technology consultant relishes the indiscriminate
slaughter of other players in online games, heaping scorn on his
victims and exploiting programming bugs to his advantage.</LD>
<LD>   Frerichs is what the online world calls a griefer--someone who
plays to make others cry. They stalk, hurl insults, extort, form
gangs, kill and loot. Although a tiny percentage of the millions who
play online games, griefers are prolific in sowing distress and
driving away thousands of paying customers.</LD>
<TE>   As a result, the habits of griefers such as Frerichs have become
an obsession for Sony Corp., Microsoft Corp. and Electronic Arts Inc.
as the companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars building
online games they hope will stir up mass-market interest.</TE>
<TE>   To these companies, online games stand as a rare specimen--the
profitable Internet business. Titles such as "EverQuest," "Ultima
Online" and "Dark Ages of Camelot" may have only a few hundred
thousand subscribers each, but they consistently make money.</TE>
<TE>   And the financial stakes are about to become much bigger. U.S.
revenues from these games are expected to grow from $300 million to
$1.8 billion by 2005.</TE>
<TE>   There are about 1 million online game players in the U.S. and
millions more overseas, particularly in South Korea, where there are
several million players.</TE>
<TE>   The game makers fear that virtual saboteurs will jeopardize the
rise of online games by scaring away customers willing to spend $10
to $14 a month and are devoting significant resources to finding ways
to stop the online mayhem.</TE>
<TE>   Called persistent world or massively multiplayer games for their
ability to accommodate thousands of simultaneous players, the games
started decades ago as simple text-based games. As personal computers
grew more powerful, these games acquired graphics that evolved into
rich, immersing, fantastical worlds. Players can acquire virtual
jobs, adopt pets, marry and own property.</TE>
<TE>   At their genesis, these games were meant to be online Camelots
where players adhered to a code of honor, but instead they quickly
descended into anarchy. Stealing, killing, taunting and other forms
of bad behavior against online characters mushroomed overnight.
Experienced players would stalk novice players, called newbies, and
kill them repeatedly.</TE>
<TE>   For a griefer, it's not the killing that is fun, because combat is
inherent in many of these games. It's the misery it causes other
players.</TE>
<TE>   "Griefers feed on the negative reactions of the people they kill,"
said Frerichs, who savors his evil online persona and saves every
nasty e-mail he gets from the people he has antagonized. "There's
nothing sweeter than when you kill someone and they spout insults at
you for hours. That's when you know you got him. It sounds really
cruel, but it's fun."</TE>
<TE>   Frerichs has received messages from parents of players, pleading
him to play nice with their children, who are driven to tears by his
antics.</TE>
<TE>   Whereas Frerichs is motivated by a desire to role-play an evil
persona, most griefers tend to be teenage boys who find it fun to see
how far they can push social limits.</TE>
<TE>   "I get off on causing other people grief," said Robert L. Lee, a
16-year-old in Omaha who plays "Ultima Online." "It gives me a
feeling that I am on a higher level than they are. I find griefing
way more fun than" killing online characters.</TE>
<TE>   Often, the griefers' characters adopt offensive screen names. The
griefer's arsenal of annoyance is large and varied.</TE>
<TE>   Lately, "ninja stealing" has become especially rampant. A griefer
waits around while another player slays a monster. Once the monster
drops dead, it often gives up weapons, coins or other desirable
items. Before the player can pick up the spoils, the griefer snatches
the items and runs away.</TE>
<TE>   Another common tactic is to lure a batch of monsters toward
unsuspecting players. Monsters, which are run by computer programs,
are generally instructed to kill the nearest players they see. By
brushing past other players, the griefer can essentially trick the
monsters into attacking someone else.</TE>
<TE>   Griefers also can form a virtual mafia, blocking access to
desirable areas of the game and demanding bribes. They also run
cartels by hoarding game components, such as eye of newt or red hair
dye, and charging inflated prices.</TE>
<TE>   Often, though, simple mischief is at the root of grief play.</TE>
<TE>   "We once had this roving band of thugs who were all craftsmen,"
said Richard Garriott, who created "Ultima Online" two decades ago
and is now creative director for game developer NCSoft Corp. in
Austin, Texas. "They would run up to a player with a supply of
lumber, rapidly build large pieces of furniture and drop them all
around the player. All these objects prevented them from moving. So
it was a sort of trap behavior."</TE>
<TE>   Not all grief play is as harmless.</TE>
<TE>   "There are all kinds of virtual assaults where people are
basically confronted in ways they didn't think were possible. Sexual
stuff, racial stuff. You name it, and it's happened," said Gordon
Walton, who was head of online services for "Ultima Online" and is
now executive producer at Electronic Arts for an upcoming game
targeted at mainstream players called "The Sims Online."</TE>
<TE>   Walton considers the examples so offensive, "I don't even tell my
wife about them. They're beyond obscene."</TE>
<TE>   The anonymity of Internet communication often encourages people to
cut loose and say things they wouldn't in real life, said Patricia T.
O'Conner, co-author of "You Send Me," a book on online writing.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of the anonymity that online writing affords, people get
away with behavior they couldn't in the real world. What's the worst
that could happen?" O'Conner said.</TE>
<TE>   Very little, as it turns out. Game developers can hand out
warnings, suspend players for a few days or in the most severe cases
ban them from playing the game.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, online games are ripe for all manner of antisocial
behavior online.</TE>
<TE>   But online games also are mirrors, however distorted, of the real
world, where evil coexists with good and every classroom has its
bullies. In that sense, griefers are part of an inevitable part of
the virtual ecosystem, Garriott said.</TE>
<TE>   There is even a school of thought that griefers play a vital role,
sniffing out technical bugs in the game and lending games a sense of
flesh-and-blood tension.</TE>
<TE>   "When we get together with old friends from these games, we don't
talk about the goody-two-shoes, we talk about the characters who made
our lives hell," said Rick Costa, a longtime player of online games
who considers himself a "goody-goody." "They're kind of a force of
nature, and you remember them."</TE>
<TE>   Most game companies, however, don't make such distinctions between
good grief and bad. Now online games have safe zones where players
can't be harmed and name filters that reject obscene or graphic
names.</TE>
<TE>   But as quickly as developers build fixes, griefers find ingenious
ways around them.</TE>
<TE>   The result is an endless cat-and-mouse game that, although fun for
griefers, has become tremendously costly for game developers.</TE>
<TE>   Sony's customer service manager, Alan Crosby, estimated that each
of his 60 customer support staff members spends an average of one
hour out of an eight-hour shift dealing with grief-related activity.</TE>
<TE>   Game developers are trying to attract new players. Microsoft, for
example, is building a network to bring players of its Xbox game
console online. Sony also is weaning its PlayStation 2 users toward
online console games. Electronic Arts is taking its popular computer
game franchise, "The Sims," online this holiday season in hopes of
introducing casual game players to subscription-based online games.
And Lucasfilm Ltd.'s video game subsidiary, LucasArts, is building a
"Star Wars" online game called "Galaxies" due out next year.</TE>
<TE>   "These games have the potential to bring in a lot of new players
who have never played online games," said Schelley Olhava, a senior
analyst with technology consulting group IDC. Olhava estimates that
U.S. revenues from online games will reach close to $2 billion over
the next three years.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, game developers are working to thwart griefers' pursuits.
Microsoft's Xbox Live service, for instance, will give players the
ability to shut out people who are offensive, so although the
offender can be seen, he or she can't be heard. Other games, such as
"The Sims Online," are building rooms where players must have
invitations before they can enter.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to take a whole new generation of players online who
have never been there before," said Cameron Ferroni, director of
content services for Microsoft's Xbox. "We want to make sure everyone
has a good experience."</TE>
<TE>   Try as they will, though, game companies are likely to find that
it is as difficult to eradicate griefers as it is to eliminate crime
in the real world.</TE>
<TE>   Said Frerichs, the computer consultant griefer: "Everybody needs a
bad guy."</TE>

<HD>Who You Calling 'Hon'?</HD>
<DH>Baltimore's love affair with its quirky greeting is being
tested by a changing population, overexposure and, now, a lawsuit
over its use.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHEN BRAUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>It is a simple pleasantry, bandied on row house stoops and in hair
salons and greasy spoons, a glottal Chesapeake endearment that has
come to embody the off-kilter charm of this harbor city. For years,
out of shared instinct and habit, Baltimoreans have addressed
customers, strangers and each other as "hon."</LD>
<LD>   In a tough town that cherishes its idiosyncrasies like dueling
scars, the word has taken on a life of its own. "Hon" has become
Baltimore's winking tribute to itself, a greeting that has cropped up
in films, inspired a restaurant and beauty pageant, and been
unofficially appended to one of its highway welcome signs.</LD>
<LD>   But there is gathering discontent in the Land of Hon. The greeting
sometimes comes off as a barb, curdled by class, racial and gender
differences.</LD>
<TE>   It is now at issue in a lawsuit filed against the Maryland State
Police by a suburban Baltimore computer systems analyst who claims
that a female state trooper went ballistic, arresting and mistreating
him, after he called her "Hon" during an August 1999 traffic stop.
When word of the lawsuit surfaced this summer, the "hon" case became
a sensation on television news and radio talk shows.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the city's blue-collar bastions, where the word is
inescapable, some residents are beginning to bridle at the
pervasiveness of Hon Culture. The city's demographics are changing.
Affluent newcomers are replacing retiring working stiffs. Old
neighborhoods are transforming. The gap between them extends even to
their use of "hon"--between those who have used the greeting since
childhood and those who have appropriated it as part of their new
scenery.</TE>
<TE>   "It's habit with me," said Frank J. Iula Jr., the analyst who is
suing Trooper Kelly Austin in Baltimore County Circuit Court for
wrongful arrest--the charges against him were dropped. "I call
everyone 'hon.' I even call my son 'hon.' "</TE>
<TE>   Stopped for going 78 mph in a 55-mph zone, Iula said, he stepped
out to hand Austin his license and registration. When ordered back
into his car, he said, "Look, hon, I'm trying to explain myself."
Austin, Iula said, was enraged. When he called her "hon" again, she
handcuffed and arrested him.</TE>
<TE>   Austin declined to comment, but Maj. Greg M. Shipley, state police
spokesman, said Iula "was not arrested for calling her 'hon' or
anything else. He was legitimately stopped for violating the speed
limit and failing to obey three orders from a police officer to
return to his car."</TE>
<TE>   Shipley and Iula's lawyer, J. Wyndal Gordon, disagree over whether
police have a legal basis to arrest people for failing to obey orders
to return to their cars. But of one thing Gordon and Iula are
certain: the power of a pleasant word to get under a trooper's skin.</TE>
<TE>   "I said 'hon' and all hell broke loose," Iula said. In a court
deposition in March, Austin explained her reaction to the word. "You
do not address people [that way]. You address people by their title."
When Iula called her "hon," she added: "I interrupted him and said
that he could address me as 'trooper.' "</TE>
<TE>   Most Baltimoreans seem to maneuver through their daily "hon"
exchanges without incident. The endearment is now so knitted within
the fabric of everyday life here that it has become inspiration for
entrepreneurs, artists and urban guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   A Baltimore restaurant, Cafe Hon, sponsors an annual Hon Fest--a
pageant for ladies sporting bush-sized beehive hairdos. Last month,
film director John Waters imported Hon Culture to Broadway in a
musical version of "Hairspray," his nostalgic paean to the tacky
travails of 1950s-era Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's "Hon Man," an anonymous mischief-maker who has spent
a decade adding "Hon" to a "Welcome to Baltimore" sign erected on the
Baltimore-Washington Parkway just south of the city. His placards are
quickly torn down by authorities, leading him to tape up new ones
within hours.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Hon' is Baltimore," said the retired cab driver, who declines
to reveal his name in print. "It's what you always hear in the
blue-collar neighborhoods. It's a nicety, you know? Now who can have
a problem with that?"</TE>
<TE>   Yet even in the harbor-side neighborhoods where "hons" fill the
air like gulls swarming above the docks, some Baltimoreans would just
as well declare a "hon" moratorium.</TE>
<TE>   "I get offended when I hear it," confided hairdresser Jaye
Marquez, 36, as she waited out the end of her shift at Hair Systems
Ltd. in Highlandtown. "It sounds like the old Baltimore to me, and I
don't want any part of it."</TE>
<TE>   Highlandtown, an east Baltimore enclave of working-class families
near the freight docks, could well be Hon Central.</TE>
<TE>   Hair Systems customer Al Bruno, 80, does not break stride--even
behind a walker--as he regales Marquez and stylist Trish Freyer with
a double dose of the usual. "Hi, hon; hi, hon," Bruno said with a
wave, nearly tipping over the massive black toupee he had just
readjusted on his pate.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Marquez, Freyer likes being called "hon." "I say it a lot,
but that's just the way I was raised, hon."</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore's city officials have spent a decade wooing more
affluent newcomers, whose seeming eagerness to fit in sometimes leads
them to overuse the greeting.</TE>
<TE>   These days, those celebrating Hon Culture the loudest often are
entrepreneurs hoping to make money at it or mockers drawling with
detached amusement.</TE>
<TE>   "I use it all the time, hon," said Pat Moran, Waters' longtime
casting director. Since the 1970s, Waters' films--such as "Pink
Flamingos"--have satirized and celebrated Hon Culture. Moran once
gently mocked the word's usage, but it now is anchored in her
vocabulary. "It has to be natural. A hon is a hon is a hon, hon."</TE>
<TE>   On the north side of town in Hampden, another working-class
bastion, Denise Whiting runs Cafe Hon. Plastic menus are printed with
photos of a bewigged Whiting and contestants in Hon Fest, the beauty
contest she sponsors each June in her backyard. About 500 people
attend, many sporting "appropriate big hair" and spouting Baltimore's
pronounced dialect--"hayme" for home, "far" for fire, "chimley" for
chimney.</TE>
<TE>   Celebrating Hons is "my way of honoring and appreciating what
Baltimore is about," Whiting said.</TE>
<TE>   But former Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke cautions that the city's
hon fixation leaves out a large swath of the city's majority-black
population.</TE>
<TE>   Schmoke, the town's first black mayor, has a vivid childhood
recollection of watching a white waitress address his aunt--a proper
North Carolina school administrator--as "hon": "Here's my aunt,
someone known as 'Doctor' or 'Mrs.' in her own community, and this
lady calls her 'hon.' It struck us all as being a put-down, even if
it wasn't intended that way."</TE>
<TE>   "Such traditional Southern interactional styles," explained North
Carolina State University professor Walt Wolfram, an expert in the
South's dialects, "get very tricky across race, gender and age lines.</TE>
<TE>   "Depending on the timing and situation, a woman might have the
right to use it, but a man might not. Then there's the question of
how blacks feel when it's used by whites and the other way around.
Class is a factor. At the core are issues of local identity and how
people want to be viewed and how other people want to view them."</TE>
<TE>   Iula said he takes no offense when a woman calls him "hon," and he
says none is meant when he offers his salutation. Gordon, a
successful black lawyer, added that he long has been called "hon" by
white courthouse workers and always shrugs it off. "It's a figure of
speech. Nothing more."</TE>
<TE>   That figure of speech managed to pin Schmoke at the center of an
uncomfortable tug of war in the mid-1990s, when a faction of
political officials intervened in Hon Man's skirmishes over his
signs. One state legislator threatened to hold up $1 million in
highway funds earmarked for the city unless Schmoke agreed to allow a
"hon" placard to remain permanently affixed to the highway sign.</TE>
<TE>   The sign is actually just outside the city. But Schmoke saw no
humor in Hon Man's antics, telling him so during a private meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "The mayor's got a lot more to do than worry about some screwball
putting up a sign," huffed Hon Man.</TE>
<TE>   Now 67, he started his crusade on a lark, then kept at it. It took
cancer to finally force Hon Man off the road in January. Then, two
weeks ago, feeling better, he threw a few posters in the trunk of his
car, lined them with adhesive tape and drove down the parkway. It is
what he does.</TE>
<TE>   "The traffic was pretty thin, so why not?" Hon Man recalled. When
he finished, he stood back and admired his handiwork. Then someone
honked. "Somebody," he said, "obviously likes being called 'hon.' "</TE>

<HD>Big Money Streams Into House Contests</HD>
<DH>Elections: The parties are on course for record spending.
About 40 races hold balance of power.</DH>

<DL>MONTGOMERY, Ala.</DL>
<LD>In a hotel ballroom in this sleepy state capital, hundreds of the GOP
faithful have paid up to $1,000 each to eat lunch and hear Vice
President Dick Cheney give a fill-in-the-blank campaign speech.</LD>
<LD>   On this summer day, Cheney is extolling Mike Rogers, the
Republican candidate running here to keep an open House seat in the
party's column.</LD>
<LD>   At stake, Cheney warns, is nothing less than who runs the American
government and the fate of President Bush's war on terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   Even before the main course arrives--a form of beef--Rogers' aides
spread word that the event has raked in $200,000 to help the state
legislator in a tight matchup against conservative Democrat Joe
Turnham. Before leaving, Cheney also poses for snapshots with donors.
The price: $1,000 a click.</TE>
<TE>   For the Bush White House, such rituals are by now routine. In all,
Cheney has raised money for 31 House candidates nationwide, and Bush
for an additional 11.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic leaders also have been blitzing the country to shake
down donors and pump up candidates. The intensity of the duel
reflects the House's narrow partisan divide: Republicans control the
chamber by the slimmest margin since the 1950s. A Democratic gain of
just six seats would end eight years of GOP rule.</TE>
<TE>   With Labor Day marking the start of the stretch drive in an
election year, the field of battle is taking shape in House
races--and a gusher of party and special-interest money is flowing
into crucial television advertising.</TE>
<TE>   Although all 435 House seats are up for election, only about 40
are considered truly competitive. If Republicans hang on to their
narrow majority, Bush will retain the power to move much of his
agenda through Congress in the second half of his term, even if
Democrats keep the Senate. But if Democrats grab the House while
holding onto the Senate, the party can seize the legislative
offensive.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows that better than Rep. Richard A. Gephardt of
Missouri, who as the Democratic House leader reluctantly saw
Republicans lay claim to the speaker's gavel in January 1995. Ever
since, he has fought to get it back, chipping away at the GOP's
majority in the last three elections.</TE>
<TE>   In a swing through the Northeast, upper Midwest and Southwest last
week, Gephardt hammered on themes he hopes will carry Democrats to
power: preventing the privatization of Social Security, guaranteeing
a prescription drug benefit for the elderly under Medicare and
punishing a GOP leadership he said was in thrall to "extreme
right-wing special interests."</TE>
<TE>   In a telephone interview from Arizona, where Democrats are seeking
to win two newly created seats, Gephardt noted that modern political
history shows that the president's party traditionally loses House
seats in midterm elections. And surveys, including a new Times Poll,
show many voters are fretting about pocketbook issues and fear the
country is headed down the wrong track.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got a general climate in the economy and the country that
will have voters looking for change when they hit that button in the
voting booth" on Nov. 5, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Republican National Committee Chairman Marc Racicot acknowledged
Sunday on CBS' "Face the Nation" that the GOP had to "swim against
the tide of history" to make gains in this midterm election, but he
insisted the party is poised to knock off some Democrats for enough
seats to retain power.</TE>
<TE>   One thing that could work in the Republicans' favor is the debate
over a possible U.S. attack on Iraq. Rep. Thomas M. Davis (R-Va.),
chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said
Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press" that the focus on Iraq "sucks the
oxygen out of some of the other issues in the campaign."</TE>
<TE>   On the domestic front, Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) said the
GOP could claim credit for passing a raft of bills in the House on
issues such as prescription drug benefits, corporate accountability,
tax cuts and homeland security.</TE>
<TE>   "Our candidates have good things to talk about. You put the
calculus together, and I think we're in pretty good shape," Hastert
said.</TE>
<TE>   But he acknowledged the partisan dogfight will continue until
election day.</TE>
<TE>   Independent analysts Stuart Rothenberg and Charlie Cook, two
leading House election monitors, agree that neither party seems
poised to rack up major gains.</TE>
<TE>   Rothenberg said his head tells him Republicans could pick up a
seat or two, but his gut predicts the Democrats will eke out gains.
But he is unsure whether the Democrats will reach their magic number
of plus-6. Cook said the GOP's fate depends on whether a souring
national mood curdles into an anti-incumbent backlash.</TE>
<TE>   Amid this uncertainty, there is one constant: the importance of
money. Experts predict fund-raising totals for 2002 campaigns could
well break records set in 2000, with many of those dollars being
poured into a tiny number of districts.</TE>
<TE>   For example, in the liberal suburbs north of Washington, Rep.
Constance A. Morella (R-Md.) and a pack of Democratic challengers
raised $5.9 million through June, making it the country's most
expensive House campaign so far. By year's end, the campaign in
Maryland's 8th Congressional District could approach the record $11
million raised and spent two years ago when Adam B. Schiff
(D-Burbank) ousted GOP Rep. James E. Rogan.</TE>
<TE>   Money is swamping other contests as well. Some of it goes directly
into campaign war chests and is limited by federal law. But much of
the spending is fueled by unregulated donations--known as soft
money--to the parties, a practice that will be curbed after the
fall's elections by the new federal campaign law. In the meantime,
soft money is alive and well.</TE>
<TE>   Data from the Campaign Media Analysis Group, compiled by
University of Wisconsin researchers, also show that interest groups
such as the AFL-CIO, the Business Roundtable and the Sierra Club have
launched their own TV ads targeting battleground races. The two
parties are doing the same through state committees.</TE>
<TE>   In California, the only House race analysts see without a
prohibitive favorite is the contest for the seat that Rep. Gary A.
Condit (D-Ceres) lost in his party's primary.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, four races--in Connecticut, Mississippi, Pennsylvania
and Illinois--pit GOP and Democratic incumbents against each other
because of redistricting. In a smattering of other districts in
several states, vulnerable incumbents face serious challengers.</TE>
<TE>   And in roughly 20 races, retirements and redistricting have left
seats open for either party to claim. One is the newly created 3rd
Congressional District in Nevada, which includes the southern half of
the casino strip in Las Vegas, the nation's fastest-growing
metropolis in the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   There, Democrat Dario Herrera, a liberal county commissioner, and
conservative Republican state Sen. Jon C. Porter have each raised
$1.3 million as of June 30, and the money has continued to flow
since. Herrera is heavily backed by Democratic Party coffers and
organized labor, while Porter has leaned on Republican leaders and
corporate political action committees. The gambling industry has
given to both candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Herrera stresses such issues as dwindling retirement savings amid
corporate scandals, the soaring cost of prescription drugs and the
environment--specifically, the nuclear waste dump the government
plans at nearby Yucca Mountain. Of his opponent, Herrera said: "He's
taken $70,000 from the House political leadership, who were leading
the fight for the Yucca Mountain dump."</TE>
<TE>   Porter asserts that Herrera is too liberal and, like his GOP
counterparts in other swing contests, warns that a Democratic victory
would be a defeat for Bush.</TE>
<TE>   In Alabama's 3rd Congressional District, which a Republican
incumbent is leaving to run for governor, Democrat Turnham is at
pains to avoid appearances with the party's leaders--though he
welcomes their money.</TE>
<TE>   Turnham, a former state party official and son of a state
legislator, stresses his conservative credentials and his distance
from Washington. He describes himself as a "pro-gun, pro-life,
pro-God, pro-pledge Democrat."</TE>
<TE>   Even before Cheney brought in the big bucks in August, Rogers had
raised more than $700,000 by June 30--nearly double Turnham's
$410,000 at that point.</TE>
<TE>   Turnham has tried to turn that gap to his advantage. At a
breakfast with senior citizens the day of the Cheney-Rogers luncheon,
he mocked the $1,000 photo ops.</TE>
<TE>   "A photograph with me is free, but a kiss will cost you a dollar,"
he told the 100 or so seniors. "If we kiss about a half-million
folks, we'll catch up in this fund-raising game."</TE>
<TE>   Later, Turnham said the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee "has been very engaged in this race--they see it as one of
the winnables." That's just what the Democratic state Legislature had
in mind when it redrew the district to include more pro-Democratic
neighborhoods and towns.</TE>
<TE>   At the Cheney event, Rogers reminds the crowd that no national
Democrats have stumped in the district for Turnham.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't have a single Democratic Party leader they can bring
into Alabama that would be more of a help than a hurt."</TE>

<HD>Public Still Backs Military Move on Iraq</HD>
<DH>Foreign affairs: But that majority support by Americans
will hold only if the U.S. first gets the support of resistant
allies, survey finds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOYLE McMANUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>After weeks of debate in foreign-policy circles, a solid majority of
Americans continue to support military action to remove Saddam
Hussein from power in Iraq, The Times Poll has found.</LD>
<LD>   But most of those who support a strike against Iraq also want the
United States to win support from allied nations before launching
military action, the poll shows.</LD>
<LD>   That poses a potential problem for the Bush administration, which
has met resistance from such allies as Britain, France and Germany to
its calls for forceful action to overthrow Hussein.</LD>
<TE>   Still, the poll suggests that President Bush starts with a broad
base of support from the American public as he makes the case for
toppling Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   The poll found that 59% of Americans believe the U.S. should take
military action to remove Hussein from power; 29% were opposed; and
12% were unsure.</TE>
<TE>   An even larger majority, 64%, said they would support a ground
attack on Iraq if Bush decided to launch one, with 28% still opposed.</TE>
<TE>   However, 61% of those who support military action said they
believe the United States should attack Iraq only if the
international community supports the move.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we ought to get rid of Saddam Hussein, but it would be a
terrible mistake to do it unilaterally," said Dewey Paugh, 65, a
retired U.S. Postal Service manager in Columbus, Ga., who was one of
the respondents to the poll. "I think it would just about ruin us in
getting any help in the war on terrorism from the Arab nations."</TE>
<TE>   The poll also found that support for war with Iraq might drop
significantly if U.S. forces suffered significant casualties. When
asked whether they would support a ground attack on Iraq if
casualties were high, 45% said yes; 41% said no.</TE>
<TE>   The poll's findings suggest that public support for military
action against Hussein has diminished somewhat over the last six
months. After Bush denounced Iraq as a major threat to U.S. security
in his State of the Union address in January, The Times Poll and
other surveys found that more than 70% of the public backed military
action.</TE>
<TE>   But even at 59%, the level of support for military action--before
the president has decided to send troops into battle--is
unprecedented, public-opinion experts say. Ever since the first
opinion surveys were taken in the years before World War II, polls
usually find most of the public opposed to military action before it
begins.</TE>
<TE>   "This is more conceptual support for military operations than we
ever saw in the 1990s, when the Clinton administration was
considering intervention in the Balkans," noted Andrew Kohut of Pew
Research Center for the People and the Press. "One of the real
legacies of the Sept. 11 attack is that people are willing to accept
the idea of preemptive military action."</TE>
<TE>   Kohut said the poll's finding that most Americans want global
support for any military action fits a more traditional pattern. "The
public doesn't like the idea of going it alone," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Bush has a lot to work with here in terms of potential public
support ... but it's not a done deal. He's going to have a hard time
holding it if he doesn't have allied support, if he doesn't get
support from Congress, if he doesn't touch all the bases."</TE>
<TE>   The Times Poll also found that 60% of the public believes Bush is
considering an attack against Iraq because he genuinely believes
Hussein is a threat to U.S. security, against 27% who say the
president is acting for political motives.</TE>
<TE>   And a large majority, 79%, said they believe Hussein supports the
Al Qaeda terrorist group that launched the Sept. 11 attacks on the
World Trade Center and the Pentagon. The Bush administration has
charged that Hussein is linked to Al Qaeda, although little specific
evidence of a connection has surfaced.</TE>
<TE>   The poll found that 77% of the public believes that U.S. military
action against Iraq is likely in the next year--and 66% believe that
if a war occurs, it will increase the likelihood of terrorism against
Americans. Among those who support military action against Iraq, 61%
believe it will increase the risk of terrorism but are apparently
willing to run the added risk.</TE>
<TE>   One of those is Kammi Vaux, 25, a financial counselor in Ogden,
Utah. "I support going after Saddam Hussein," she said. "I think we
should have handled it years ago." Asked whether she believed the
U.S. should wait for support from other countries first, she said:
"I'd like to, but I don't think it's going to happen. And if it
doesn't happen, I still think we should go ahead."</TE>
<TE>   The Times Poll also asked Americans how the events of Sept. 11 had
affected their lives--and most respondents said, in effect, "not
much."</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether their lives had changed, 47% said no; 36% said they
had changed a little; and only 16% said they had changed a lot.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether life had returned to normal, 68% said yes; 14% said
their lives hadn't changed in the first place; 13% said their lives
have begun returning to normal; and 5% said they were still having
difficulty getting back to normal.</TE>
<TE>   A large majority, 64%, said they expect more terrorist attacks in
the United States within the next six months.</TE>
<TE>   Eighty-three percent said they are confident that the military can
protect the country from terrorist attacks, and 68% said they are
confident that the proposed Department of Homeland Security can
protect the country.</TE>
<TE>   But respondents are divided over whether the Bush administration
has responded clearly to the challenge of terrorism. Only 38% said
Bush has "formulated a clear policy," while 55% said they thought the
administration was "reacting to events as they happen."</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, the public's response to that question divided
along partisan lines: 61% of people who identified themselves as
Republicans said Bush had responded with a clear policy, while only
22% of Democrats agreed.</TE>
<TE>   The public is also divided over whether the threat of terrorism
justifies restrictions on traditional civil liberties. Overall, 49%
said they believe some civil liberties should be surrendered, while
38% think the government may go too far in restricting liberties.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Times Poll, directed by Susan Pinkus, interviewed 1,372 adults
nationwide Aug. 22-25. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus
3 percentage points.</TE>

<TE>How the Poll Was Conducted</TE>
<TE>The Times Poll contacted 1,372 adults nationwide by telephone Aug.
22-25. Telephone numbers were chosen from a list of all exchanges in
the nation. Random-digit dialing techniques were used so that listed
and unlisted numbers could be contacted. The entire sample was
weighted slightly to conform with census figures for sex, race, age,
education and region. The margin of sampling error for the entire
sample is plus or minus 3 percentage points. For certain subgroups
the error margin may be somewhat higher. Poll results can also be
affected by other factors such as question wording and the order in
which questions are presented.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>BY NEWSDAY IN PREDICTED ORDER OF FINISH BY DIVISION</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK JETS</LD>
<LD>   Coach: Herman Edwards, second season.</LD>
<LD>   Last season's record: 10-6, third in AFC East. Lost to Raiders in
wild-card round.</LD>
<TE>   Who's in: CB Donnie Abraham (Buccaneers), CB Aaron Beasley
(Jaguars), LB Sam Cowart (Bills), DT Josh Evans (Titans), SS Sam
Garnes (Giants), DE Larry Webster (Ravens), DE Steve White
(Buccaneers).</TE>
<TE>   Who's out: DT Shane Burton, CB Marcus Coleman, LB James Farrior,
CB Aaron Glenn, S Chris Hayes, G Kerry Jenkins, G David Loverne, DE
Rick Lyle, DT Steve Martin, DE Eric Ogbogu, T Ryan Young.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Huge turnover on the defensive side, where the Jets now
have six new starters. However, if Cowart can stay healthy, he'll
have a huge impact. The defensive line now has depth that has been
missing for several seasons. Offensively, the big question is the
line. But with three Pro Bowl-caliber starters in Kevin Mawae, Jason
Fabini and Randy Thomas, it's still better than most. Vinny
Testaverde's still got the big arm, and Curtis Martin is still a top
runner.</TE>
<TE>   Parting shot: Super Bowl or bust.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MIAMI DOLPHINS</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Dave Wannstedt, third season with Dolphins.</TE>
<TE>   Last season's record: 11-5, second in AFC East. Lost to Ravens in
wild-card round.</TE>
<TE>   Who's in: DT Larry Chester (Panthers), P Mark Royals (Buccaneers),
RB Ricky Williams (Saints).</TE>
<TE>   Who's out: DE Lorenzo Bromell, T Spencer Folau, TE Hunter Goodwin,
RB J.J. Johnson, DE Kenny Mixon, RB Lamar Smith, S Brian Walker.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The Williams trade provides a huge upgrade on offense.
He's the Dolphins' best running back since Larry Csonka. Jay Fiedler,
coming off preseason hip surgery, needs a big season to keep his job
over Ray Lucas. The defense is one of the quicker ones in the NFL,
but tends to lose steam in the latter stages of the season and into
the playoffs. The defensive line is average, the linebackers are
slightly better and the secondary is solid.</TE>
<TE>   Parting shot: Even Williams won't be able to get Miami over the
playoff hump.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Bill Belichick, third season with Patriots.</TE>
<TE>   Last season's record: 11-5, first in AFC East. Won Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Who's in: TE Cam Cleeland (Saints), TE Christian Fauria
(Seahawks), S Chris Hayes (Jets), WR Donald Hayes (Panthers), CB Tom
Knight (Cardinals), DE Rick Lyle (Jets), DT Steve Martin (Jets), LB
Ryan Phillips (Colts).</TE>
<TE>   Who's out: QB Drew Bledsoe, CB Terrell Buckley, LB Bryan Cox, WR
Terry Glenn, DT Brandon Mitchell, TE Jermaine Wiggins.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: There's no quarterback controversy now that Bledsoe is
gone. But that still doesn't answer the question whether Tom Brady is
a one-season wonder, a franchise-caliber passer or something in
between. The guess here: something in between. Belichick is clearly
moving toward a short passing game with the influx of tight ends,
including first-round pick Daniel Graham. The defense is not super
talented, but is extremely well coached.</TE>
<TE>   Parting shot: Belichick caught lightning in a bottle last season
and won't repeat the feat any time soon.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   BUFFALO BILLS</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Greg Williams, second season.</TE>
<TE>   Last season's record: 3-13, fifth in AFC East.</TE>
<TE>   Who's in: QB Drew Bledsoe (Patriots), LB London Fletcher (Rams), K
Mike Hollis (Jaguars), S Billy Jenkins (Packers), TE Dave Moore
(Buccaneers), LB Eddie Robinson (Titans), T Trey Teague (Broncos).</TE>
<TE>   Who's out: S Keion Carpenter (Falcons), LB Sam Cowart (Jets), DE
Phil Hansen, CB Ken Irvin, QB Rob Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Bills made tremendous strides in the offseason with the
acquisition of Bledsoe and Fletcher, important players for each side
of the ball. Bledsoe is a major upgrade for the passing game, but
he'll need help from an anemic running game. The defense continues to
be outmatched at the point of attack.</TE>
<TE>   Parting shot: Bills will be one of the NFL's most improved teams,
but let's not give them too much credit.</TE>

<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>1 PITTSBURGH--If quarterback Kordell Stewart can maintain his Pro
Bowl pace and running back Jerome Bettis stays sound--he says his
injured groin has mended--the Steelers could be Super Bowl-bound.
Special teams problems persist, even though Coach Bill Cowher has
hired a new assistant to run the show.</LD>
<LD>   2 NEW ENGLAND--The biggest test for quarterback Tom Brady will be
how he handles the success of last season. He has yet to miss a
workout in two years and, because of his dedication, received a prime
parking spot at training camp. That's a very good sign.</LD>
<LD>   3 CLEVELAND--Tim Couch made major strides in 2001 and could emerge
as one of the league's elite quarterbacks, provided he gets some help
from an offensive line that has been inconsistent. The addition of
rookie running back William Green could take some heat off him.</LD>
<TE>   4 DENVER--Mike Shanahan slid from genius to just another guy last
season when his offense sputtered and wheezed to a No. 22 ranking.
But Shannon Sharpe is back, as is an uninjured Ed McCaffrey, and
they, along with Rod Smith, will give quarterback Brian Griese lots
of options. With Terrell Davis gone, rookie running back Clinton
Portis needs to learn how to hang onto the ball.</TE>
<TE>   5 MIAMI--For the first time in 25 years, the Dolphins have a
running back, Ricky Williams, who scares a defense. Now, they need to
establish a consistent passing game that will open things up for
Williams. Second-year receiver Chris Chambers is in line for a big
year.</TE>
<TE>   6 BUFFALO--The Bills have flipped over quarterback Drew Bledsoe,
but the Patriots must have known something before letting him go to a
division rival. What Bledsoe could really use is an every-down
running back. Tackle Mike Williams, the No. 4 pick, could be one of
the stars of this draft.</TE>
<TE>   7 OAKLAND--The aging Raiders are running out of time. They won't
get many more good years out of Tim Brown, Jerry Rice, Rich Gannon,
Bill Romanowski, Lincoln Kennedy, Trace Armstrong, et al. It remains
to be seen if Bill Callahan has the attention of this team the way
Jon Gruden did. Callahan's a nice guy, but that rarely gets the job
done.</TE>
<TE>   8 INDIANAPOLIS--No doubt Tony Dungy will fix the Colt defense, but
this team's success hinges on quarterback Peyton Manning and running
back Edgerrin James returning to form. Manning threw 23 interceptions
last season, and James is coming off a knee injury that forced him to
miss last season's final 12 games.</TE>
<TE>   9 NEW YORK JETS--Quarterback Vinny Testaverde is talented and
capable of inspiring those around him, but he's on the downslope of
his career. Running back Curtis Martin is coming off his best season,
and he's among the league's elite. Can Herman Edwards pull together a
defense that features three new starters in the secondary?</TE>
<TE>   10 TENNESSEE--The Titans had far too many penalties last
season--enough to suggest that Coach Jeff Fisher had lost control of
the team--and injured running back Eddie George was tentative and all
too catchable. Fisher is a good coach--the Titans have won 61.3% of
their games in the last five years--and quarterback Steve McNair
looked great for long stretches last season.</TE>
<TE>   11 CINCINNATI--Running back Corey Dillon looks more complete every
year, and he has the best stiff-arm in the business. The Bengals
don't have much else going for them, though. Jon Kitna and Gus
Frerotte are not the types of quarterbacks who keep defensive
coordinators up nights.</TE>
<TE>   12 SAN DIEGO--The Chargers made the right move, handing the
quarterback job to Drew Brees, but the transition will take time.
Marty Schottenheimer has the respect/fear of his players, and that's
a good start.</TE>
<TE>   13 KANSAS CITY--Quarterback Trent Green led the league last season
with 24 interceptions and the Chiefs haven't done much to improve at
receiver. Johnnie Morton is a proven No. 2 receiver; now he's the top
target.</TE>
<TE>   14 JACKSONVILLE--Losing receiver Keenan McCardell should hurt the
Jaguars, who desperately need quarterback Mark Brunell and running
back Fred Taylor to stay injury free--and both are injury-prone. The
offensive line surrendered a franchise-record 63 sacks last season
... then lost Pro Bowl tackle Tony Boselli to Houston in the
expansion draft.</TE>
<TE>   15 BALTIMORE--Neither Chris Redman nor Jeff Blake inspires much
confidence at quarterback, and there's no quality backup to running
back Jamal Lewis in case his surgically repaired knee gives way. The
Raven defensive line, once huge with Sam Adams and Tony Siragusa, is
suddenly small and movable.</TE>
<TE>   16 HOUSTON--There is Super Bowl-type enthusiasm surrounding this
team, and No. 1 pick David Carr is a top-shelf celebrity in his new
hometown, but the Texans will be hard pressed to win more than five
games this season.</TE>

<HD>Spiezio Keeps on Making a Big Name for Himself</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every game day, Scott Spiezio wanders over to the bulletin board and
checks the lineup to see if his name is there. After six months and a
barrel-full of runs batted in, he might take it for granted.</LD>
<LD>   Spiezio was at first base Sunday, as he has been much of this
season. He homered and matched his career-high with RBIs, as the
Angels kept pace in the American League West with a 9-3 victory over
the Baltimore Orioles in front of 24,592 at Edison Field.</LD>
<LD>   Yet, there will remain a bit of insecurity on Speizio's part.</LD>
<TE>   "I have never felt that this job was mine," Spiezio said. "I hoped
it was and begged for it. But every day, I look to see if I'm
playing. That will never change. I'm feeling more comfortable that my
name will be there. But there were too many years where I would look
at it, hoping and begging that it was there."</TE>
<TE>   The begging can stop.</TE>
<TE>   Even for those arriving late to the Angels' season, Spiezio's
performance was hardly a surprise on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   He has gone at this pace all season and seems to be picking up
speed. He has driven in 20 runs in the last 21 games.</TE>
<TE>   "We all knew Scott was capable of putting up the numbers, given
the chance," Darin Erstad said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Spiezio had about as much a chance of filling Mo Vaughn's
cleats at first base as he did filling his plate following Vaughn in
a post-game meal line. Yet, with a month to go, Spiezio has a
career-high 69 RBIs, four more than Vaughn, who was traded to the New
York Mets during the off-season.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to compare myself to Mo," Spiezio said. "I think as
far as a career, he has me crushed."</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio, though, has filled the Vaughn void, especially in the
clutch. His three-run homer in the second Sunday erased a 1-0
deficit. His RBI single fueled a five-run eighth that put the Angels
28 games above .500 for the first time in franchise history.</TE>
<TE>   More important, they stayed 3 1/2 games behind Oakland in the AL
West and 2 1/2 games ahead of Seattle in the wild-card race. The
Angels have seven games left with the Athletics and six with the
Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   "We have shown we can play with both Oakland and Seattle, so that
doesn't worry us," Spiezio said.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels were 7-2 against the Athletics and Mariners in July.
But this is September, a month that has traditionally rained for 30
days and 30 nights on the Angel parade.</TE>
<TE>   There was a taste of that Sunday, as Troy Glaus left the game
after being hit by a pitch in the eighth inning. He was diagnosed
with a bruise on his left elbow, but was sent to UC Irvine Medical
Center for precautionary X-rays. The Angels are already playing
without Tim Salmon and starting pitcher Aaron Sele.</TE>
<TE>   That is the type of bad luck that has made September a burial
ground for Angel hopes in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Since winning their last division title in 1986, the Angels have
had a winning record in September only twice. The Angels were 6-21 in
September last season.</TE>
<TE>   "There is more confidence with this team," Manager Mike Scioscia
said. "I think last year, our pitching got a little taxed. Our
bullpen was having to pick up games in the fifth or sixth inning
constantly last season."</TE>
<TE>   Angel starting pitching was less of a question mark this season,
with the acquisition of Sele and Kevin Appier. First base, however,
was a multiple-choice pop quiz ... as in who's going to provide some
pop.</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio has helped answer that by hitting .330 with runners in
scoring position.</TE>
<TE>   "What I've done this season is more about how guys are getting on
base in front of me and giving me the chance," Spiezio said. "I'm
still going to go over and check the lineup card every day. I'm not
taking anything for granted."</TE>

<HD>Frustrated Lackey Gets Lesson in Composure</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Angel rookie pitcher John Lackey got a lesson Sunday, but not in
pitching.</LD>
<LD>   Lackey was breezing along, in total control, through five innings.
Yet, that would have been a surprise to anyone who arrived in the
sixth inning. Lackey looked flustered and frustrated, mostly by the
calls of home plate umpire Bill Miller.</LD>
<LD>   Lackey hit Mike Bordick to start the inning and, one out later,
gave up a double to Jerry Hairston. Lackey then thought he had struck
out Chris Richard ... twice ... but Miller called both pitches balls,
loading the bases.</LD>
<TE>   After the walk, Lackey threw his arms in the air in a
what's-it-going-to-take pose and stepped toward home plate. Miller
took two steps toward the mound and shouted at Lackey.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't anything big," Lackey said. "He was just showing how
unhappy he was with the way I reacted. It wasn't right what I did. I
apologized."</TE>
<TE>   Lackey still picked up the victory, making his record 7-3 since
being called up from triple-A Salt Lake City. But it wasn't easy, as
the Angel bullpen labored.</TE>
<TE>   Reliever Brendan Donnelly, who was brought in after the Orioles
loaded the basses in the sixth, walked Tony Batista, the first batter
he faced, to force in a run. It was the first inherited runner he has
allowed to score this season, having stranded 21 before Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Weber and Scott Schoeneweis also had rough patches, allowing
the Orioles to cut the Angel lead to 4-3. The situation was such that
Manager Mike Scioscia called on closer Troy Percival in the eighth
inning for only the third time this season.</TE>
<TE>   Percival got one out to end the inning and the Angels scored five
runs in the bottom of the eighth for some breathing room. Percival
retired the side, striking out two, in the ninth for his 32nd save.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Adam Kennedy had been in this position before and found himself on
the bench.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels had two runners on and a left-hander reliever was
summoned from the bullpen. Two months ago, Scioscia would likely have
used a right-handed pinch hitter.</TE>
<TE>   This time, Kennedy stayed in the game and smacked Buddy Groom's
0-1 pitching into the right-field seats.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to be able to prove [Scioscia] right," Kennedy said.
"He has Benji Gil on the bench and he has a lot of thunder in his
stick. It has to be a tough decision."</TE>
<TE>   It's a little easier one these days. Kennedy hit .404 in August,
the highest monthly average by an American League player this season.
He is hitting a team-high .318 this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tim Salmon, who has missed 19 games with a bruised left hand, took
early batting practice and hit in the batting cage during the game
Sunday. He will take batting practice Tuesday and said he could

<LD>The Oakland Athletics' 18-game winning streak is the longest in the
major leagues in nearly 50 years, dating to the New York Yankees'
18-game streak in 1953. But a recent labor accord between baseball
and its players could set into motion another significant victory for
the A's.</LD>
<LD>   At least that's the opinion of Skip Bayless of the San Jose
Mercury News, who believes Oakland owner Steve Schott will be able to
move the A's to an as-yet-to-be-built ballpark in San Jose because
baseball owners have agreed to put off contraction.</LD>
<LD>   Bayless writes that owners will be forced to move the Montreal
Expos to Washington because a suitable owner cannot be found to take
the Expos off the hands of the owners, who are running the team this
season. Schott will then be free to move the A's out of Network
Associates Coliseum, gaining an advantage over other small-market
owners that Bayless refers to as "Bud's Duds."</LD>
<TE>   For what it's worth: The A's won 17 games in a row in 1931, when
they were based in Philadelphia and managed by Connie Mack, the last
man to wear a suit while directing his team from the dugout.</TE>
<TE>   Those A's were led by Lefty Grove, who was 31-4 with a 2.06
earned-run average, and outfielder Al Simmons, who led the American
League with a .390 average. Despite winning 107 games, the A's lost
the World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals, four games to one.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Since the Washington Senators moved to Arlington,
Texas, in 1972, the last major league team to relocate, how many NFL
teams have moved?</TE>
<TE>   Goofy situation: Colorado State defeated Colorado for the third
time in four seasons, leading Ram Coach Sonny Lubick to say after
Saturday's 19-14 victory over the seventh-ranked Buffaloes, "I know
one thing, those people in the other locker room, they respect
Colorado State. Maybe the Mountain West Conference isn't such a
Mickey Mouse league after all."</TE>
<TE>   Add Colorado: The Buffaloes have lost four consecutive season
openers for the first time since 1938-41, which prompted this from
Coach Gary Barnett: "Unfortunately, I have some experience in this.
I'd sort of like to get rid of that."</TE>
<TE>   More labor woes: The NHL's agreement with its players ends in two
years. When Commissioner Gary Bettman asked union chief Bob Goodenow
if he wished to begin talks now and avoid the rush, Goodenow
declined.</TE>
<TE>   Adrian Aucoin, a New York Islander defenseman, offered this
prediction for September 2004:</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think both parties have even come close to hammering out
anything. It would be nice to see some kind of progress, but it's
like they have to wait for a deadline to get anything done."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Six teams, seven moves.</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders moved to Los Angeles and back to Oakland. The Rams
moved to St. Louis. The Colts moved to Indianapolis. The Browns moved
to Baltimore (and became the Ravens). The Cardinals moved to Phoenix.
The Oilers moved to Nashville (and became the Titans).</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Former baseball commissioner Fay Vincent still
doesn't trust Commissioner Bud Selig: "He was the ringleader of the
group that tried to get me out. He told me he wanted to break the
union. I said he couldn't do it. I was right."</TE>

<LD>   What: "Hey Rookie, Welcome to the NFL"</LD>
<LD>   Where: ESPN, Tuesday, 5:30 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   This one-hour documentary provides a revealing look of what it is
like to be a young man trying to make it in the NFL. Six rookies are
followed by NFL Films from draft day to mini-camps to training camp
to exhibition games.</TE>
<TE>   Four are well known--No. 1 overall pick David Carr, third pick
Joey Harrington, fourth pick Mike Williams, a 370-pound offensive
tackle from Texas selected by Buffalo, and tight end Jeremy Shockey
of Miami, the New York Giants' first pick.</TE>
<TE>   The other two are not as well known. One is Jeff Hatch, a likable
character who is an offensive tackle from Penn. The other is Josh
Robinson, a defensive back trying to make the Baltimore Raven roster.</TE>
<TE>   While Carr, Harrington and Williams are flown to New York and put
up in upscale hotels for the draft, Hatch watches the draft at home
with his family. He keeps telling himself he's a fifth-round pick. He
is ecstatic when the New York Giants make him the 78th pick overall
in the third round.</TE>
<TE>   The camera is rolling when Hatch gets a call from Giant Coach Jim
Fassel. Hatch is so excited he can barely speak. At one point, he
laughs out loud. "No, sir, I am not drunk," he says.</TE>
<TE>   After the call, Hatch says, "I feel elation, amazement and now
it's like, welcome to the NFL."</TE>
<TE>   Hatch's unbridled emotion is a highlight of this excellent show.
Unfortunately, Hatch is hampered by a back injury during training
camp.</TE>
<TE>   Shockey, a holdout, flies from Miami to New York and then travels
by limousine to the Giant training camp in Albany, N.Y., after
signing. He arrives at 4 a.m. and can't find a hotel room, so he
sleeps in the car.</TE>

<HD>Nomo Is on Pace to Remain the Ace</HD>
<DH>Baseball: In Brown's absence, Dodger right-hander steps up
again as a staff leader in 2-1 win over Astros.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>While Kevin Brown wallows in the bullpen, trying to regain the form
that made him one of baseball's most dominant pitchers, Hideo Nomo
continues to prove the Dodger staff is not without an ace.</LD>
<LD>   Nomo gave up one run and five hits in seven innings, striking out
eight, and closer Eric Gagne survived a harrowing ninth as the
Dodgers defeated the Houston Astros, 2-1, Sunday before 28,891 in
Minute Maid Park.</LD>
<LD>   Shortstop Cesar Izturis hit a two-run double in the second inning,
third baseman Adrian Beltre made a potential game-saving catch in the
ninth, and a highly questionable decision by Houston Manager Jimy
Williams backfired, helping the Dodgers improve to 26-11 in one-run
games.</LD>
<TE>   The Dodgers stayed within six games of Arizona in the National
League West and moved two games ahead of San Francisco in the
wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   With a three-game series against the Diamondbacks beginning
tonight in Phoenix, the Dodgers have a chance to alter the landscape
of the division.</TE>
<TE>   "We've talked a lot about the wild card, but what's wrong with
looking at the division?" Manager Jim Tracy said. "Why be satisfied
with the wild card? Let's shoot a little higher."</TE>
<TE>   The mood in the Dodger clubhouse would not have been so upbeat had
the Astros' ninth-inning rally not fizzled. After Dodger left-hander
Jesse Orosco struck out the dangerous Lance Berkman to end the
eighth, Jeff Bagwell opened the ninth with a single off Gagne, and
Jason Lane beat out a sacrifice-bunt attempt for a single.</TE>
<TE>   Up stepped Orlando Merced, and just about everyone in the park
expected a bunt. But Williams shunned the sacrifice, and Merced
struck out.</TE>
<TE>   Geoff Blum, who homered in the second inning, followed with a
popup down the left-field line. Beltre, at the end of a 90-foot
sprint, made an over-the-shoulder basket catch in front of the short
fence in foul territory for the second out. Gagne then struck out
Gregg Zaun for his 46th save in 50 chances.</TE>
<TE>   "I did not think Adrian Beltre would get to that ball," Tracy
said. "I don't know if you can make a better catch when you have one
step to go before your quadriceps smashes into [the wall]. That was a
huge out."</TE>
<TE>   Added Gagne: "I thought that ball was in the stands. I didn't even
look at it. It was a great catch. It helps a lot when you can get a
free out like that."</TE>
<TE>   Another superb start from Nomo didn't hurt. There was speculation
in mid-May that Nomo, who was 2-5 with a 3.91 earned-run average in
his first eight starts, would be demoted to the bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   But since a lengthy chat with Tracy and pitching coach Jim
Colborn, who stressed the importance of working ahead in the count,
Nomo has gone 11-1 with a 3.12 ERA in his last 21 starts, 17 of which
have resulted in Dodger victories.</TE>
<TE>   "I've run out of adjectives to try to describe the job Nomo has
done for this club all season long," Tracy said. "He showed up in
spring training as a guy we were hoping would give us some innings as
a No. 3 or 4 starter, but you can make an argument for this guy being
the ace of many staffs in our league."</TE>
<TE>   Nomo's forkball was especially effective Sunday, not so much
because the pitch resembled a thigh-high fastball on approach before
darting down toward hitters' ankles as it reached the plate.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo (13-6) did a masterful job of setting up his out pitch by
throwing first-pitch strikes to 17 of 27 batters and working ahead in
the count. That enabled him to expand the strike zone and induce more
defensive swings.</TE>
<TE>   "In May, we talked about his inefficiency when it came to throwing
strikes early in the count," Tracy said. "It's obvious how much more
effective he is when he throws early strikes, and today's performance
is indicative of everything I've been talking about."</TE>
<TE>   Nomo had virtually no margin for error.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers are 22-10 against left-handed starters, and it
appeared they might fatten up on Astro left-hander Carlos Hernandez
when they scored two runs in the second inning Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Beltre, who had three hits, sparked the rally with a bloop single
to left, Eric Karros drew a one-out walk, and backup catcher Chad
Kreuter bunted for a single to load the bases.</TE>
<TE>   Izturis, who is batting .320 from the right side, lined a two-run
double into the right-field corner for a 2-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo and the Dodger bullpen made those two runs stand up, though,
and the Dodgers won for the 13th time in 17 games.</TE>
<TE>   "All of our starting pitchers are throwing the ball well, and
fortunately I've stayed injury free," Nomo said through an
interpreter. "Kevin Brown has been hurt, and I can't cover what Kevin
means to this team. But at the same time, we've been playing well and
pitching well."</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Gagne Embraces Pressure of the Race</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>The calendar Sunday turned to September, a month when the tension of
the pennant race is more palpable, when every game, every at-bat,
every pitch, is more magnified for those in contention.</LD>
<LD>   It is not a time for the timid, nor would it seem to be a time for
a closer who has not experienced intense pennant-race pressure. But
if anyone doubts how Dodger reliever Eric Gagne will respond, they
should have seen the gleam in his eye Sunday as he envisioned a
month's worth of high-stress situations.</LD>
<LD>   "I can't wait," said Gagne, who passed his first September
test--barely--with his 46th save in Sunday's 2-1 victory over the
Astros. "This is what it's all about. Every game, every time you step
on the mound, it counts."</LD>
<TE>   Gagne, in his first season as a closer, believes the last five
months have prepared him for anything he might face in September and
possibly October.</TE>
<TE>   He retired three in a row after giving up two singles to lead off
the ninth inning Sunday. He escaped a bases-loaded, no-out jam in St.
Louis on July 5 and a runner-on-third, no-out jam in Baltimore on
June 9.</TE>
<TE>   "People say it's different in the playoffs, and it might be,"
Gagne said. "I've never been to the playoffs, and I couldn't say, yes
or no. But I think I'm ready. Stuff has happened, and I've dealt with
it pretty well. There's no reason to think that's going to change."</TE>
<TE>   Mental toughness is usually the determining factor in whether a
player wilts or thrives in September and October, and Dodger pitching
Coach Jim Colborn believes Gagne ranks high in that department.</TE>
<TE>   "He's shown me more already than I ever thought he would show, so
I won't be surprised by anything he does," Colborn said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brian Jordan started in left field Sunday after missing all but
one game since Aug. 9 because of a protrusion in his lower back, and
Manager Jim Tracy said he will remain there on a regular basis,
provided he is physically sound and productive.</TE>
<TE>   That means Marquis Grissom, who is batting .308 in his last 22
games and played an integral part in the Dodgers' August surge, when
they went 18-10, will return to the bench except against left-handed
starters.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan batted fifth Sunday behind Adrian Beltre, going hitless in
four at-bats, but Tracy hopes he evolves into the kind of consistent
cleanup batter the Dodgers have lacked most of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope he forces my hand so strongly that there's absolutely no
question he needs to be the guy hitting behind Shawn Green," Tracy
said. "But it's not fair to fire him into that spot when he just got
off the disabled list."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After going 8-1 with a 2.90 earned-run average in April and May,
Kazuhisa Ishii is 5-8 with a 6.14 ERA in the last three months, a
skid that resulted in the left-hander being skipped in the rotation
in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Walks have been Ishii's biggest problem--he leads the major
leagues with 100 of them, 18 more than the next highest pitcher--and
Ishii needs to improve his control when he starts against Arizona
Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to concentrate on my form," Ishii said. "The walks don't
bother me as long as we win games I pitch."</TE>

<LD>   Picture your favorite millionaire backup shortstop airing public
grievances Saturday as Michigan players at midfield mobbed the
non-scholarship kicker who defeated Washington on a last-second field
goal before a crowd of 111,491.</LD>
<LD>   Imagine next week's popularity polls had hard ball gone on strike:</LD>
<TE>   68: Underwater yoga.</TE>
<TE>   69: Women's professional bowling.</TE>
<TE>   70: Major League Baseball.</TE>
<TE>   The college kids, mind you, put on these Michigan-Washington shows
without a month of Cactus League warmups. All the games count, every
single second, which explains how Washington could be eliminated
(likely) from the national title chase before the start of fall
semester.</TE>
<TE>   College football has its problems, for sure, but they're mostly
the fault of grown-ups, which leads us to tonight's arrival of Auburn
for a weekend-capping matchup with USC at the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   The plus-side news is that Auburn hasn't been on NCAA probation
since getting whacked with a "lack of institutional control" charge
back in 1993, yet Southeastern Conference schools treat possible
recidivism the way recovering alcoholics handle sobriety--one day at
a time.</TE>
<TE>   A recent enterprise series in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution
chronicled what coaches from 10 other major conferences have been
saying for years, that the SEC is loaded with cheats.</TE>
<TE>   All conferences have their rule breakers, yet nothing compares to
the depth of corruption in the SEC, mainly because football in the
South is so important nothing stands in the way of winning.</TE>
<TE>   More remarkable than Steve Spurrier's on-the-field accomplishments
in 12 years at Florida was the fact he did it without ever receiving
an NCAA violation after inheriting a program on probation for
"unethical conduct."</TE>
<TE>   Roy Kramer, the SEC's recently retired commissioner, was an
unprecedented power broker whose television deals made the SEC the
nation's wealthiest conference in the 1990s, but that cash only
fueled the pursuit of players--by whatever means necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee went on probation in 1991, and it was only recently
revealed that former quarterback Tee Martin, who led the Volunteers
to the 1999 national title, received money funneled by a
sportswriter.</TE>
<TE>   Auburn took its hit in 1993. Alabama scored the daily double,
following its 1995-96 violations with a recent sanctions slap that
prohibits bowl participation this year and next. Georgia,
Mississippi, Kentucky and Mississippi State have all been behind NCAA
bars.</TE>
<TE>   The Journal-Constitution reported that only the dedicated work of
a compliance officer kept Alabama from getting shut down under the
NCAA's "Death Penalty."</TE>
<TE>   For what it's worth, the NCAA took another recent swing through
Mississippi State, which prompted Coach Jackie Sherrill to utter,
"I'm not going to jump off a 50-foot cliff because somebody is coming
to talk to our players. I know how I've conducted myself and how I've
operated."</TE>
<TE>   The latest SEC scandal was the whopper of all whoppers, three
schools charged with trying to ply a Memphis high school coach with
cash to deliver a player, Albert Means, to their respective schools.
The irony? Means was a bust.</TE>
<TE>   The root of this SEC evil, of course, is money. Six of the
nation's 20 millionaire coaches work in the SEC. The conference went
from sharing $16.5 million in revenue in 1990 to $78.1 million last
year.</TE>
<TE>   Frankly, there is no incentive to not cheat. Hal Mumme left
Kentucky on probation and Kentucky cut him a severance check for $1
million.</TE>
<TE>   Going on probation after winning a national title is seen by many
in the South as the price of doing business.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Slive, formerly of Conference USA, has replaced Kramer as SEC
chief with a mission to clean up Dodge City.</TE>
<TE>   Slive should take the "scared straight" approach, you know, bring
in someone from Southern Methodist to tell the league what can happen
to a football program gone afoul.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC is too much of a money monster to ever go the way of the
Southwest Conference, which was condemned and then closed, but it
never hurts to retell cautionary tales.</TE>
<TE>   See, it's not that football doesn't matter everywhere else in the
country.</TE>
<TE>   In the South, it just matters more.</TE>
<TE>   Weekend Wrap</TE>
<TE>   Conference of the week award: Mountain West. How's this for
knocking on the bowl championship series door: Colorado State defeats
Colorado (Big 12) nine days after beating Virginia (Atlantic Coast).
Air Force does a 52-3 fly-over on Northwestern (Big Ten).</TE>
<TE>   Next up for Colorado State is UCLA (Pacific 10). The Mountain
West's problem rests in being the seventh-best conference in a
six-conference monopoly, the 63-school strong BCS. And you thought
Augusta National was exclusionary. The champions of the non-BCS
conferences (Mountain West, Mid-American, Conference USA) have no
guaranteed access to the four big-money BCS bowls and instead have to
be ranked high enough to earn one of two at-large bids. FYI: It
hasn't happened in the BCS' four-year history. The only way the
Mountain West can make its case for inclusion is to schedule BCS
schools--and beat them. Not a bad start.</TE>
<TE>   Where are they now? J.P. Losman completed 13 of 23 passes for 183
yards and two touchdowns in Tulane's victory. Hmmm, the name rings a
bell, but....</TE>
<TE>   Joe Paterno vs. Bobby Bowden update: The legendary Penn State
coach earned his 328th victory to keep his all-time major college
lead to three over the legendary Florida State coach (Hey, it's the
closest thing we've got to Sosa-McGwire).</TE>
<TE>   Duke ends 23-game losing streak with victory over East Carolina.
What now? Well, the school with maybe the best chance to eclipse
Northwestern's major college record of 34 is ... how about
Northwestern? Saturday's loss to Air Force was the Wildcats' seventh
in a row dating to last year.</TE>
<TE>   Kudos to Tyrone Willingham on winning his first game at Notre
Dame, but let's not make room in the trophy case yet. Former Irish
coaches Joe Kuharich, Gerry Faust and Bob Davie--legends none--all
won their debuts too.</TE>

<KH>NFL PREVIEW 2002</KH>
<HD>Lone Star</HD>
<DH>As he nears the end of his career, Cowboys' Smith is poised
to become the league's all-time leading rusher.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>Dallas Cowboy running back Emmitt Smith is a mere 540 yards from
breaking Walter Payton's all-time rushing record, just a few good
games away from immortality.</LD>
<LD>   And at least one football fan out there couldn't give a hoot.</LD>
<LD>   "I was watching some reporters talking about whether [Smith] was
the greatest back in NFL history, and I felt like throwing a rock
through my TV," said William Sanders, whose son, Barry, abruptly
retired from football in 1999 after 10 seasons and 15,269 yards
rushing--1,457 shy of Payton's mark.</LD>
<TE>   "I guarantee you this," Sanders continued. "Put Emmitt Smith in
that Detroit system with that line and those quarterbacks, and
there's no way he could do what Barry did."</TE>
<TE>   Smith, in his 13th season, has heard similar comments. He knows,
he knows--he's nowhere near the running back of Jim Brown, doesn't
have half the highlight tape of Gale Sayers, couldn't hold Sanders'
Gatorade cup ...</TE>
<TE>   "According to the world, the media, the naysayers, my career was
over a while ago," said Smith, 33. "But that's just the way it is
sometimes. I know the insides of the game and I know what it takes to
be successful."</TE>
<TE>   Smith was the second of six running backs selected in the first
round of the 1990 draft, a group that also included Blair Thomas,
Darrell Thompson, Steve Broussard, Rodney Hampton and Dexter Carter.
Not only has Smith outlasted them all, he has rushed for 1,726 yards
more than their combined career total.</TE>
<TE>   Lost in all those yards is the fact Smith wasn't the player the
Cowboys wanted most in that draft; defensive lineman Ray Agnew was,
but he had already been selected by New England when Dallas' No. 17
pick came around. The Cowboys were already loaded with running backs,
so Smith was something of a peculiar pick, especially because the
knock on the University of Florida junior's speed.</TE>
<TE>   Concerned he might be criticized for taking another running back,
then-coach Jimmy Johnson trotted out Cowboy scout Walt Yowarsky to
explain the pick to reporters, a highly unusual move. Yowarsky, the
most vocal Smith backer in the organization, was delighted when the
Cowboys had a chance to get him.</TE>
<TE>   "If I could have done back flips I would have done them," Yowarsky
said.</TE>
<TE>   Smith rushed for 937 yards as a rookie, the only sub-1,000-yard
season of his career. He's won four rushing titles, was a key
component on three Super Bowl teams, and--although he might not have
made the All-VCR team with dazzling cutbacks and dizzying spins--he
established himself as the league's premier operator in tight spaces.
Give him a hint of daylight and it's a first down. Along the way,
he's done an amazing job of avoiding huge hits. As much as anything,
that accounts for his longevity. Considering the average NFL career
lasts about three seasons, Smith is as much survivor as superstar.</TE>
<TE>   Payton once said: "I want to set the record so high that the next
person who tries for it, it's going to bust his heart."</TE>
<TE>   Smith has worked heart-busting hard his whole career. It didn't
hurt, of course, that for much of it he was surrounded by future Hall
of Fame players Troy Aikman and Michael Irvin, five Pro Bowl
offensive linemen, a Pro Bowl tight end in Jay Novacek and a Pro Bowl
fullback in Daryl Johnston.</TE>
<TE>   "Daryl and I share a very special bond because we've been together
a long time," Smith said. "When I was out of place, he was in the
right place to recover fumbles. When I needed to get from the right
side to the left side, he made the key block for me to do that. He
has sacrificed his body for me for a lot of these yards;
three-fourths, if not 90% of my yardage."</TE>
<TE>   Whereas Aikman, Johnston and Irvin have retired to the broadcast
booth, Smith is still churning away, one of the last reminders of the
glory days in Dallas. This spring, with last season's 5-11 record
still fresh in his memory, he wrote a letter to his teammates
advising them of the dedication they would need to exonerate
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to give them some insight on what it's going to
take, how hard we're going to have to work, how committed we're going
to have to be to win another Super Bowl," he said.</TE>
<TE>   If the Cowboys don't win one this season, Smith probably will not
get another chance with them. His age is starting to show. Next
season, he will be a 34-year-old back who counts $10 million against
the salary cap. As it is, he's coming off a 1,021-yard season, his
least productive since his rookie year--and he needed 331 yards in
the final three games to get there. His three touchdowns last season
marked the fewest of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, his understudy started to creep into the spotlight.
Troy Hambrick rushed for 579 yards at an average of 5.1 yards a carry
(third-best in the league among running backs with 100 carries or
more), and established himself as the team's back of the future.</TE>
<TE>   Smith has been straddling the future and past. Out of respect for
Payton, who died of cancer in November 1999, he has made a sincere
effort to keep in close touch with the family of the Chicago Bear
star. Last month, he received the "Spirit of Sweetness" Award and
broke down during his acceptance speech.</TE>
<TE>   Smith had a long talk with Eddie Payton, Walter's brother, at that
banquet. The two spoke about life, family and golf--Eddie is the golf
coach at Jackson State--but little about football.</TE>
<TE>   "It would mean a lot less to us if some jerk broke [the record],
somebody that was not representative of what my brother was all
about," Eddie Payton said. "Emmitt's pretty much a clone of the
Payton family. You feel a sense of pride when people talk about the
record and compare the two."</TE>
<TE>   Smith also spent some time at the banquet with Walter Payton's
son, Jarrett, a running back at the University of Miami. The two met
at a charity golf tournament and quickly bonded.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a really cool guy," Jarrett recalled. "I was a little
nervous about approaching him, sort of anxious. But when I told him
who I was, he just smiled and asked me to sit down."</TE>
<TE>   Even before they met, Smith had Jarrett on his radar screen,
thanks to a phone call he received from Walter in the months before
his death.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'E, I want you to do me a favor,' " Smith said. "I said,
'What is it? Anything you want.' He said, 'I just want you to talk to
my son, Jarrett. I just want you to talk to him and be there for him
as much as you possibly can.' And I said, 'Wow, OK, I'll do that.
That's no problem.' "</TE>
<TE>   William Sanders remembers an entirely different phone conversation
he had with Payton.</TE>
<TE>   "Walter called me just before he passed, and he thought Barry was
going to get it too," he said. "He wanted me and him and Jim Brown to
be there when Barry broke his record. It made me feel good that he
wanted to be there. I think Walter recognized what Barry had done
with the kind of team he was with."</TE>
<TE>   Smith has always praised Sanders, and, in years past, said that he
too thought Sanders would break the record. He recently said he
wished the younger Dallas defensive players could face Sanders just
once and try to keep up with his physics-defying moves.</TE>
<TE>   "That's poetry in motion," Smith said. "He's good--very good."</TE>
<TE>   But, barring a strange twist, the record will soon be Smith's. And
if some people think the star on his helmet looks more like an
asterisk, well, that doesn't bust his heart.</TE>

<HD>Gordon Has an Easy Time in Winning Southern 500</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First he couldn't win. Now Jeff Gordon can't seem to lose.</LD>
<LD>   Gordon, who ended a 31-race winless streak with a victory at
Bristol, Tenn., last week, made it two in a row Sunday when he won
the NASCAR Winston Cup Southern 500 at Darlington, S.C., Raceway for
a record-tying fifth time.</LD>
<LD>   "Man, what fun we're having right now!" he shouted after taking
the checkered flag.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike last week, when he had to bump his way past Rusty Wallace
three laps from the finish, Gordon put together a dominating run and
his No. 24 Chevrolet was hardly challenged as he led the final 64
laps.</TE>
<TE>   He beat rookie Ryan Newman to the finish line by 1.734 seconds--a
distance greater than a football field--to win consecutive races for
the 15th time in his career.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon has won the Southern 500 five times, tying Cale
Yarborough's record for wins in the prestigious race that is run on
NASCAR's oldest speedway.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just thrilled because this is a historic race track, the
race has so much prestige, it's just a special, special day for us,"
Gordon said. "We couldn't believe we were in victory lane last
Saturday and we can't believe we're here now."</TE>
<TE>   Gordon, who also has a victory in the spring race at Darlington,
won for the 60th time in his career.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Elliott finished third in a Dodge, Winston Cup points leader
Sterling Marlin was fourth in a Dodge, and Dale Jarrett brought his
Ford across the line in fifth.</TE>
<TE>   The finishing order tightened up the points race and made Gordon a
legitimate threat for his fifth Winston Cup title. With his victory,
the defending champion moved into second place in the standings with
3,314 points, 95 behind Marlin.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Five-time Formula One champion Michael Schumacher set a record for
most victories in a season with a win in the Belgian Grand Prix at
Spa-Francorchamps.</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher won his 10th race this season, starting from the pole
position in his Ferrari to complete the 44-lap race on the scenic
4.327-mile track in 1 hour 21 minutes 20.634 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "It very much looked like the perfect race," Schumacher said. "I
was just enjoying myself, drove for fun this afternoon."</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher holds records for most victories in one season, most
Grand Prix wins (63), and most championship points (923).</TE>
<TE>   Rubens Barrichello, driving in Ferrari's backup car, finished
second, nearly two seconds behind Schumacher. BMW-Williams' Juan
Pablo Montoya was third, nearly 20 seconds behind.</TE>
<TE>   Barrichello clinched second place in the drivers' championship
with 51 points, extending Ferrari's dominance this season.</TE>
<TE>   Montoya added four championship points and has 44.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bruno Junqueira, hoping he still has time to get back into the
CART championship chase, led from start to finish in the inaugural
Shell Grand Prix of Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Junqueira had to hold off a late charge by Target/Chip Ganassi
Racing teammate Scott Dixon, who could only try to pressure the
leader into a mistake.</TE>
<TE>   The strategy didn't work as Junqueira's Toyota-powered Lola
crossed the finish line 0.282-seconds--about three car-lengths--ahead
of Dixon's.</TE>
<TE>   Junqueira was asked if team owner Chip Ganassi ordered Dixon to
stay behind his teammate, whose second victory of the year and third
of his CART career moved him into second place in the standings
behind Cristiano da Matta, who finished third.</TE>
<TE>   "In CART, there are no team orders," Junqueira said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ricky Carmichael swept the AMA 250cc U.S. Motocross Championship
season, winning the season finale at Steel City Raceway in Delmont,
Pa., for his 12 victory in 12 events.</TE>
<TE>   The Honda rider is the first to win every event in an AMA
Motocross series. He also moved into first place on the career 250cc
victory list with 28, passing Bob Hannah. James Stewart won the 125cc
division on a Kawasaki. It was his 10th victory of the year, a 125cc
season record.</TE>

<LD>   Wottle Wins 800;</LD>
<LD>   Seagren Defeated</LD>
<TE>   Dave Wottle, in his typical come-from-behind style, barely won the
800 meters, then raised questions by failing to remove his trademark
cap during the medal ceremony. Four years after U.S. sprinters Tommie
Smith and John Carlos raised their fists in Black Power salutes on
the victory stand, Wottle said he wasn't protesting anything. "I just
forgot to take my hat off," he said. "And I'm in the ROTC [at Bowling
Green University]. I want to apologize to the American people."</TE>
<TE>   Forced to vault with a pole he hadn't used until two days before
the final because his controversial fiberglass Cata-Pole had been
declared illegal, Bob Seagren finished second in the pole vault. It
was the first time in the Summer Olympics that the United States had
failed to win the gold medal in the pole vault. The winner was East
Germany's Wolfgang Nordwig, a leader in the protest against the
Cata-Pole. Nordwig had vaulted with the new, lighter poles earlier in
the season but didn't adjust to them.</TE>

<HD>Cap Nearly Keeps the Lid on His Feat</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Dave Wottle is the last U.S. runner to win the men's 800 meters in
the Olympic Games, but he might be remembered as much for the cap he
wore as for his thrilling, come-from-behind victory in the 1972 Games
in Munich.</LD>
<LD>   Wottle, a 52-year-old Ohio native, began wearing a cap in the
summer of 1971 to help keep the sun out of his eyes while he ran.</LD>
<LD>   "The cap acted as a sun visor," said Wottle, the dean of
admissions and finance at Rhodes College in Memphis since 1983. "It
was a practical thing to wear."</LD>
<TE>   Wottle was regarded as a miler entering the 1972 Olympic trials in
Eugene, Ore., but the then-Bowling Green junior shocked himself and
those in attendance when he tied the world record of 1 minute 44.3
seconds in the 800.</TE>
<TE>   "I really ran the [800] as a speed workout before the 1,500,"
Wottle said. "I didn't even know what the world record was before the
race."</TE>
<TE>   After missing 2 1/2 weeks of training with tendinitis in his left
knee a month before the Games, Wottle started tentatively in the
Olympic final and trailed the leaders by 10 meters after the first
200.</TE>
<TE>   He moved into sixth place after 600 meters and figured he was
running for the bronze medal as he entered the home straightaway
trailing the Soviet Union's Yevgeny Arzhanov and Kenya's Mike Boit
and Robert Ouko, all of whom were favored.</TE>
<TE>   " 'I'm going to try and get the bronze,' " Wottle said to himself.</TE>
<TE>   "Then after passing [Ouko]," he added, "I thought I had a chance
at the silver. I didn't think about the gold medal until 15-20 meters
to go when I could see that Arzhanov was really tiring."</TE>
<TE>   Wottle passed a stumbling Arzhanov just before the finish line,
and both were credited with times of 1:45.9.</TE>
<TE>   "I ended up getting a perfect race thrown at me," said Wottle, who
later apologized for forgetting to take off his cap on the medal
stand during the playing of the national anthem. "They all went out
so fast that they came back to me at the end."</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>1 PHILADELPHIA--Quarterback Donovan McNabb nearly got the Eagles to
the Super Bowl last season, and the addition of wide receiver Antonio
Freeman helps. Linebacker Jeremiah Trotter will be missed.</LD>
<LD>   2 SAN FRANCISCO--If he keeps his head, receiver Terrell Owens is
one of the best players in the game. Quarterback Jeff Garcia is
coming off his second-consecutive Pro Bowl season, and Garrison
Hearst and Kevan Barlow power the league's No. 2 rushing offense.</LD>
<LD>   3 ST. LOUIS--Running back Marshall Faulk is going for his
fifth-consecutive season with 2,000 or more total yards--an NFL
record--and ultra-sharp quarterback Kurt Warner is over his thumb
injury. Ram linebackers are fast, but are they too light to stop the
run all season?</LD>
<TE>   4 TAMPA BAY--Jon Gruden no longer has to fight for control, so now
we'll really find out how skilled he is as a coach. Same goes for Rob
Johnson, who probably will wind up as the starting quarterback. But
how long can the Buccaneers go before Warren Sapp tears them apart?</TE>
<TE>   5 GREEN BAY--Brett Favre is still one of the best quarterbacks in
football but he has no receivers. Maybe Terry Glenn can help, but he
hasn't done much of anything this summer. Defensive end Joe Johnson
adds a run-stopping presence to a defense that had 52 sacks, third in
the NFL, last season.</TE>
<TE>   6 WASHINGTON--Will Steve Spurrier's system work in the NFL? It has
looked incredible in the exhibition season, which means, well, not
much. If Spurrier can squeeze big-time production out of those
quarterbacks--and cope with pesky owner Dan Snyder--he deserves every
dime of his $5 million-a-year salary.</TE>
<TE>   7 CHICAGO--The Bears have an overachiever in quarterback Jim
Miller and a great backup in Chris Chandler, who has shown flashes of
excellence when he's not hurt. They also have a great running back in
Anthony Thomas, last season's rookie of the year. What they don't
have is a home field in Chicago. Those trips to Champaign could
become a grind.</TE>
<TE>   8 NEW ORLEANS--The Saints were a mess at the end of last season,
turning on each other in the locker room and quitting on the field.
Jim Haslett has cleaned house and is left with a team that has the
talent to be competitive.</TE>
<TE>   9 DALLAS--Dave Campo won't get the chance to coach his
third-consecutive 5-11 team; he'll get canned before he gets that
far. So there's a lot of incentive for him to win now. Emmitt Smith
will steal the headlines by claiming the league's all-time rushing
record, but Cowboy coaches will be more concerned with whether Troy
Hambrick is ready to take the torch.</TE>
<TE>   10 SEATTLE--New conference, new stadium, new quarterback, same old
problems--too few good receivers, a spotty offensive line, not enough
production from the defensive ends, and lots of breakdowns on special
teams. The Seahawks are in trouble if quarterback Trent Dilfer
doesn't bounce back from his knee injury.</TE>
<TE>   11 ATLANTA--There's no question about quarterback Michael Vick's
raw skills, but what is not known is whether he can hold up over an
entire season. The plan calls for running backs Warrick Dunn and T.J.
Duckett to relieve much of the pressure by putting defenses on their
heels.</TE>
<TE>   12 NEW YORK GIANTS--Two seasons removed from the Super Bowl, the
Giants are stuck in neutral. They have a few outstanding
players--Tiki Barber, Michael Strahan, Jason Sehorn--and a lot of
unproven ones. Quarterback Kerry Collins can be good when he holds
onto the ball, but he fumbled 23 times last season.</TE>
<TE>   13 MINNESOTA--Receiver Cris Carter is gone, which might not be a
bad thing, considering he was very talented but even more divisive.
Quarterback Daunte Culpepper took a step back in 2001 after a great
rookie season, and he'll be taking a lot more steps back if that
offensive line doesn't come together. By the way, where's Bryant
McKinnie?</TE>
<TE>   14 ARIZONA--Coach Dave McGinnis deserves a lot of credit for
getting seven victories out of the NFL's youngest team, one with a
quarterback who too often tries to jam passes into tight spots and a
defense that collected only 19 sacks. Receiver David Boston is
impressive, but opposing defenses can key on him.</TE>
<TE>   15 CAROLINA--First-year Coach John Fox knows defense, which is
good news for a team that finished last in total defense and last
against the pass in 2001. But knowing defense doesn't necessarily
translate into a vast improvement on that side of the ball. Fox can
take solace in this: the Panther offense is bad too.</TE>
<TE>   16 DETROIT--A lot of people think Joey Harrington was the best
quarterback in the draft and a steal with the No. 3 pick. Marty
Mornhinweg did a nice job of making adjustments as the roof was
caving in last season; he definitely improved as a coach.</TE>

<HD>Patience Is the Key for Fans of Texans</HD>

<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>The traffic jam stretched for miles, clogging this city worse than a
dozen jackknifed trucks. Some people turned around and drove home.
Others shelled out $100 for motel rooms--only so they could use the
parking that went with them--then walked the rest of the way. Most
Houston Texan fans inched along, many needing three hours to reach
Reliant Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   The prevailing opinion: It took six years to get the NFL back,
what's a few more hours? That type of patience will come in handy for
Houstonians this season.</LD>
<LD>   Because the Texans are going to stink.</LD>
<TE>   If his team wins five games, Dom Capers should be coach of the
year.</TE>
<TE>   This is no secret to folks in the organization, even though they
were giddy after grabbing several big-name players in the expansion
draft. Capers and General Manager Charley Casserly know perfectly
well this is a throwaway season.</TE>
<TE>   And losing, after all, is in their best interest. Just think, next
year's draft is going to be loaded with good quarterback prospects,
and the Texans--assuming they lose enough--will have 15 draft picks.
They already have their quarterback, David Carr, so they could trade
away a high selection to a quarterback-needy franchise for more picks
in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Putting together a successful expansion franchise is, at best, a
three-year process. Capers knows this, even though he was Carolina's
coach when the Panthers reached the 1996 NFC championship game in
their second season.</TE>
<TE>   Back then, Capers and then-general manager Bill Polian infused the
roster with young players on offense and thirtysomethings on defense.
That defense led the way, adding new chapters to the careers of
seasoned veterans such as Sam Mills, Brett Maxie, Carlton Williams
and Greg Kragen.</TE>
<TE>   But that defense looked a lot older the third season, and the
offense wasn't good enough to make up the difference. Besides, the
offense had its own problems, including an incident in which
quarterback Kerry Collins allegedly used a racial epithet to describe
a teammate, and the ensuing fight that ripped the team to pieces.</TE>
<TE>   Since their glorious second season, the Panthers have not had a
winning one. History will remember Carolina as a franchise that won
right away by focusing on the now, to the detriment of the future.</TE>
<TE>   The Texans are determined not to do that. In the meantime, though,
there figures to be some serious growing pains. They are the youngest
team in the league and could start as many as five rookies on
offense. The cornerstones of their offensive line, tackles Tony
Boselli and Ryan Young, are injured and will not be available until
at least October. Steve McKinney was a good guard in Indianapolis,
but here he's the center, a position he's never played. The receivers
and running backs are nothing special. Aside from Carr--who has
looked remarkably sharp--the most effective offensive threat has been
kicker Kris Brown, a colossal bust in Pittsburgh last season.</TE>
<TE>   The No. 1 priority for the Texans this fall should not be winning
games, but keeping Carr whole and healthy. With that offensive line,
he'll get plenty of cardiovascular work. No more five-step drops.
Heard of the Texas two-step?</TE>
<TE>   So what are the good people of Houston to do?</TE>
<TE>   Suffer with a smile.</TE>
<TE>   They have done that before. After the 1978 and '79 seasons, when
the Oilers came within a victory of the Super Bowl, only to lose the
conference title games at Pittsburgh, the Houston fans showed their
loyalty. A crowd of 50,000 gathered for a rally at the Astrodome in
the wee hours of the morning when the Oilers returned home from the
first loss. The next year, the crowd swelled to 70,000, with
thousands more milling around in front of the stadium, unable to get
inside.</TE>
<TE>   During the festivities the second year, Coach Bum Phillips stood
on a giant flatbed truck at midfield, grabbed a microphone and
supercharged the crowd with this now-famous promise: "Last year, we
knocked on the door. This year, we banged on the door. Next year,
we're going to kick the SOB in."</TE>
<TE>   The Oilers reached the door the next season and found it
padlocked, losing to the Raiders in the first round. Phillips was
fired, and the "Love Ya Blue" era was history.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips, who lives on a ranch 90 miles from San Antonio, says
those two rallies were the highlight of his coaching career.</TE>
<TE>   Oiler fans endured a lot of frustration and embarrassment, from
the penny-ante wranglings of team owner Bud "Bottom Line" Adams; to
the run-and-shoot days, when the Oilers reached the playoffs a
league-best seven consecutive seasons but never got past the second
round; to Jerry Glanville leaving tickets at will-call for Elvis.</TE>
<TE>   The Texans have a grace period. This year, Reliant Stadium is the
star. The place cost $446 million, features a grass field, and has
the NFL's only retractable roof. It's a big reason Houston joined New
York, San Francisco and Washington as a U.S. contender for the 2012
Olympic Games. (Houston and Washington were eliminated from
contention last week.) The Astrodome sits right next to Reliant, and
the old place looks sad, like a weather-beaten tool shed behind a
glittering palace.</TE>
<TE>   Texan officials are preaching patience and they have a receptive
audience. Houston fans are football savvy; the clear-headed ones know
the team won't win right away. Then again, their patience isn't
bottomless. The Astros' attendance skyrocketed when they moved into a
new stadium, but has dropped the last two seasons. The Rockets sold
out their home court for six consecutive seasons, but have been last
or next to last in attendance the last two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   For now, Houston fans will do just about anything for their new
NFL team, including wading through traffic for three hours to see an
exhibition game. And it may stay that way. As long as this franchise
lays the groundwork to do what the Oilers couldn't.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere out there, a door needs kicking.</TE>

<HD>Mariners Finally Go on Offense</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the Seattle Mariners tied a major league record with 116
victories last season, their longest winning streak was a team-record
15 games.</LD>
<LD>   So all they can do is shake their heads in admiration at what the
Oakland Athletics are doing.</LD>
<LD>   "What have they won--18 in a row or so?" Mariner Manager Lou
Piniella said after Seattle's 9-4 victory over the Kansas City Royals
on Sunday at Seattle. "Tip your hats to them."</LD>
<TE>   Dan Wilson homered and drove in three runs as the Mariners broke
out of their hitting slump. They scored only eight runs in their
previous five games--four losses, including two to the Royals.</TE>
<TE>   Desi Relaford and John Olerud each had three hits for the
Mariners, who have fallen into third place in the American League
West, six games behind Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   They are 2 1/2 games behind the Angels in the wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   The Safeco Field crowd of 45,461 let out a collective groan when
the scoreboard posted Oakland's comeback victory over Minnesota
during the seventh inning.</TE>
<TE>   The defending division champions have 25 games left, with six each
against Oakland and the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Piniella doesn't know if the Mariners can catch the A's, but he
knows they're going to try their hardest.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to start winning with some consistency," he said. "Right
now, the only way we're going to get back in it is to win some
ballgames."</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 7, New York 6--Rookie Josh Phelps doubled twice and drove
in three runs to help the Blue Jays beat David Wells at Sky Dome.</TE>
<TE>   Vernon Wells tied a career high with four hits for the Blue Jays,
who won three of four from the AL East leaders. Phelps had eight hits
in 14 at-bats and drove in 10 runs in the series.</TE>
<TE>   With the score tied, 4-4, in the seventh, Jayson Werth singled
against Wells (15-7) for his first major league hit. Wells then
walked Shannon Stewart before Dave Berg hit a tiebreaking single to
center.</TE>
<TE>   Wells followed with a run-scoring single against Ramiro Mendoza
and Phelps had a run-scoring double, giving Toronto a 7-4 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 7, Detroit 0--Mark Buehrle (17-9) pitched a seven-hitter
to become the first White Sox left-hander with 17 victories since
1985. He struck out four and did not walk a batter in his fourth
career shutout and second this season.</TE>
<TE>   The White Sox have won a season-high five in a row and seven of
nine. The Tigers have lost four in a row and 10 of 11. It was also
their seventh loss in a row at home.</TE>
<TE>   Britt Burns was the last left-hander to win 17 games for Chicago,
going 18-11 in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 7, Cleveland 1--Manny Ramirez and Brian Daubach hit
consecutive home runs and Tim Wakefield pitched seven strong innings
at Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox won for only the third time in eight games.</TE>
<TE>   Wakefield (8-5) did not give up a hit until Matt Lawton led off
the fifth inning with his 15th homer to make it 7-1.</TE>
<TE>   The knuckleballer gave up three hits, walked two and struck out
six to win for the fifth time in seven starts since July 23.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 8, Texas 3--Jared Sandberg and Randy Winn homered at
Arlington, Texas, and the Devil Rays completed only their second
series sweep this season.</TE>
<TE>   The Devil Rays won the first three games of the season against the
Detroit Tigers. Their last road sweep came July 27-30, 2000, at
Kansas City.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>Over and over again, the ball left Miguel Tejada's bat and landed in
the left-field seats. Each time, the Coliseum crowd cheered wildly as
Tejada screamed with joy and pumped his arms while rounding the
bases.</LD>
<LD>   The televisions in the Oakland clubhouse played only one program
after the Athletics won their 18th consecutive game--and every time,
Tejada was the star.</LD>
<LD>   Tejada hit a dramatic three-run homer after the A's blew a two-run
lead in the ninth inning to beat the Minnesota Twins, 7-5, Sunday and
extend baseball's best winning streak in 49 years.</LD>
<TE>   "Every year, I take all my tapes back home [to the Dominican
Republic], and I show them to my dad," Tejada said. "This one might
break. I'm going to watch it every day."</TE>
<TE>   The first game-ending homer of Tejada's career extended the
majors' longest winning streak since 1953, when the New York Yankees
also won 18 in a row, on a day it seemed certain to end when the
Twins hit three solo homers in the top of the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   "This thing has a life of its own," Oakland Manager Art Howe said
of the longest streak in franchise history, besting the 17-gamer by
the 1931 Philadelphia A's. "I can't say I'm surprised by anything
that happens. We sort of blew that game, but Miggy found a way to get
it for us anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Matthew LeCroy, Corey Koskie and Mike Cuddyer homered for
Minnesota in an improbable rally that ruined the complete-game hopes
of Mark Mulder and sent the Coliseum into stunned silence.</TE>
<TE>   But in the ninth, Ramon Hernandez walked and Ray Durham singled
against closer Eddie Guardado (1-3). Pinch-hitter Olmedo Saenz struck
out, setting the stage for Tejada's homer.</TE>
<TE>   "While I was running, I looked up and I saw my dad [in a luxury
box]," Tejada said. "He was jumping. It was funny to see him jumping.
That's where I pointed."</TE>
<TE>   At Howe's urging, Tejada stepped out of the dugout moments later
for a curtain call.</TE>
<TE>   "I threw a fastball low, but it caught too much of the plate, and
he reached down and got it," Guardado said. "As soon as he got it in
the air, I knew it was gone. What are you going to do? Tejada is an
All-Star."</TE>
<TE>   Tejada also hit a two-run homer.</TE>
<TE>   "MVP. Period. Three letters describe that guy," said A's closer
Billy Koch (7-2), who gave up Cuddyer's go-ahead homer but got the
victory. "I don't think there's any other choice. If he wasn't on
this team, where would we be?"</TE>
<TE>   By sweeping AL Central-leading Minnesota, the A's won their ninth
consecutive series.</TE>
<TE>   When ace Barry Zito goes for his 20th win today against Kansas
City, the A's have a shot to tie the league record of 19 consecutive
victories set by the White Sox in 1906 and tied by the Yankees in
1947.</TE>
<TE>   Nail-biters have been a rarity during the streak for the A's,
baseball's best team in one-run games. The A's hadn't even trailed in
any ninth inning during their streak until Sunday, and they've
outscored their opponents, 122-48.</TE>
<TE>   "You touch them, you burn yourself," said Torii Hunter, who broke
up Mulder's shutout bid with a score-tying, two-run homer in the
sixth. "You can't play those guys. They're so unbelievable. You can't
take those guys light, even with a 5-4 lead in the bottom of the
ninth."</TE>
<TE>   The Twins lost their fourth in a row, but their division title is
all but assured.</TE>
<TE>   When the A's visit the Metrodome next weekend, it might be another
playoff preview for two teams that probably would meet in the first
round if Oakland holds off the Angels and Seattle for the AL West
crown.</TE>

<HD>It's Serena's Show for Everyone to See</HD>
<DH>U.S. Open: Williams takes center stage and defeats
Bedanova, 6-1, 6-1, in only match that is completed on rainy day.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Serena Williams apparently is bent on a self-styled mission to save
the U.S. Open from the back pages, boredom and a financial hit.</LD>
<LD>   She went three for three Sunday. Williams saved a dreary day from
a total wash, as she was the only player to record a victory at the
rain-plagued National Tennis Center. The No. 1-seeded player was
equal parts efficient and devastating, serving eight aces and hitting
35 winners, defeating No. 20 Daja Bedanova of the Czech Republic,
6-1, 6-1, in the fourth round.</LD>
<LD>   Williams did not face a break point and dropped only five points
on her serve, including one in the 18-minute first set.</LD>
<TE>   Maybe the U.S. Tennis Assn. can give Williams a bonus for speedy
work. The whopping 41 minutes she spent on Arthur Ashe Stadium
counted as a day session, meaning that officials won't have to give
spectators a free ticket next year.</TE>
<TE>   That hardly seems equitable. The USTA is said to be rethinking the
policy, according to David Newman, managing director of marketing and
communications. Wimbledon's policy is a full refund for play less
than an hour and a 50% refund for play more than an hour and less
than two.</TE>
<TE>   Play on the other courts started later, and last year's finalist,
Pete Sampras, found himself in big trouble in the first set against
Greg Rusedski of Britain, facing a 5-2 deficit. Later, with Rusedski
serving at 5-3, Sampras saved two set points when Rusedski netted a
volley and double-faulted.</TE>
<TE>   The rain started falling lightly just after Sampras broke in that
game, and the match was suspended on the changeover when it was clear
the court was too slippery to continue.</TE>
<TE>   Daniela Hantuchova, the 11th-seeded player from Slovakia, was not
as fortunate. She was leading No. 8 Justine Henin of Belgium, 6-1,
and was in the third game of the second set when she went sprawling.
Hantuchova went running for a wide forehand and slipped on the
baseline. Her feet went out from under her and she tried to break her
fall with her right hand and injured her thumb, giving Henin a 2-1
lead in the second.</TE>
<TE>   Looking teary-eyed, the 19-year-old called for a trainer and put
ice on the hand. Later, when the match was suspended, Henin was asked
whether the court was slippery.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a little bit," Henin said.</TE>
<TE>   One by one, matches were suspended. The USTA waited a few more
hours to finally cancel the night session, a fourth-round match
between No. 4 Lindsay Davenport and No. 13 Silvia Farina Elia of
Italy, calling it off at about 9:45 (Eastern time).</TE>
<TE>   So, after all the inaction, it was all about Serena, the reigning
French Open and Wimbledon champion. She once joked about her "daily
dose of me," and it was certainly fitting Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Williams landed on the front page of the Daily News with this
headline: "German pursued her around globe. NAB SERENA STALKER."
There was a shot of Williams hitting a backhand, wearing her slightly
more demure pink top and black skirt and an insert picture of alleged
stalker Albrecht Stromeyer of Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Local police arrested him here over the weekend. This is his third
incident with law enforcement authorities this year, including
Wimbledon.</TE>
<TE>   Here, he was charged with three misdemeanor counts of stalking.
Bail was set at $3,000, and the 34-year-old from Frankfurt remains
incarcerated at Rikers Island.</TE>
<TE>   At Wimbledon, Serena appeared unaffected by the controversy.
Although she has had a personal bodyguard since the European spring
clay-court season, her coach and father, Richard, is increasingly
concerned.</TE>
<TE>   "She's only 20 and she acts like it doesn't bother her," Richard
Williams said. "This guy is getting braver and braver. He's not going
to stop. The NYPD did a marvelous job. But it wouldn't surprise me if
he came back."</TE>
<TE>   Tour officials said Serena would not answer questions about the
issue but there was some confusion when she was asked about the
threat. She said she was taking it seriously and could not relax.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently Williams thought the question was about the level of
competition, not the stalker.</TE>
<TE>   "No, I definitely did not take that meaning," Williams said in a
statement released by the tour. "I was referring to the threat of the
competition at this tournament. It's amazing how words can get
twisted around."</TE>

<HD>National Stage for Trojans</HD>
<DH>College football: No. 20 USC opens season tonight against
Auburn with prime-time pressure to produce.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Returning USC to national prominence was one of Coach Pete Carroll's
primary goals when he was hired before the 2001 season.</LD>
<LD>   The nation, and Trojan fans expecting improvement over last
season's 6-6 finish, will gauge Carroll's progress tonight when the
No. 20 Trojans play Auburn in a prime-time opener at the Coliseum.</LD>
<LD>   It might not be Monday Night Football in the traditional NFL
sense, but Carroll and his players intend to shine in the spotlight.</LD>
<TE>   "For this one night, they can live the dream a little bit," said
Carroll, who was an NFL head coach for four seasons and an assistant
for 12.</TE>
<TE>   USC quarterback Carson Palmer expects an eventful evening. The
fifth-year senior, who is on pace to become the school's all-time
leader in passing yards, said the Trojans must ignore distractions
and concentrate on execution after three weeks of training camp.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to control your adrenaline a little bit because it seems
like it's been so long since you last played," Palmer said. "You
can't worry about all the hype, Monday night football, a national
television audience and all that.</TE>
<TE>   "You just need to focus on what you need to do."</TE>
<TE>   For the Trojan offense, that means establishing a rushing attack
to complement offensive coordinator Norm Chow's multiple-set passing
scheme.</TE>
<TE>   Senior transfer Justin Fargas will not play because of a hamstring
strain, so senior tailbacks Malaefou MacKenzie and Sultan McCullough
will get the majority of carries. They will run behind a mostly
experienced line determined to erase memories of last season's
embarrassing 87.7-yard rushing average.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to be better," junior tackle Eric Torres said.</TE>
<TE>   "We worked hard in the off-season, and we know the O-line has to
come through."</TE>
<TE>   Senior Kareem Kelly and junior Keary Colbert are veteran receivers
with speed. Mike Williams, a 6-foot-5 freshman who will back up
Kelly, also is a playmaker.</TE>
<TE>   Senior kicker David Davis made 15 of 18 field-goal attempts last
season.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to put some drives together whether we get points out of
them or not," Palmer said. "We need to move the chains and get some
confidence going early."</TE>
<TE>   Auburn, making its first trip to California since 1936, finished
7-5 overall and 5-3 in the Southeastern Conference last season. The
Tigers upset Florida, which was ranked No. 1 at the time, but lost
their chance for an SEC title by losing three of their last four
conference games. Auburn finished its season with a 16-10 loss to
North Carolina in the Peach Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Tommy Tuberville, under pressure despite a 21-15 record over
three seasons, brought in new coordinators this season. Bobby Petrino
was the offensive coordinator for the Jacksonville Jaguars, Gene
Chizik the defensive coordinator at Central Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Running back Carnell "Cadillac" Williams, a 5-11, 202-pound
sophomore, is Auburn's main threat on offense. Williams missed all or
parts of six games last season because of injuries but still gained
614 yards and averaged 5.1 yards a carry.</TE>
<TE>   Tuberville was cautious with Williams during training camp,
holding him out of one scrimmage and giving him only a few carries in
another.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not an impressive player until you've watched him for about
a quarter or tried to stop him if you're a defensive coordinator,"
Tuberville said. "What you see is what you get out of him every day.
There is no cruise control."</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Cobb, a sixth-year senior, beat out sophomore Jason
Campbell to become the Tigers' starting quarterback, but Tuberville
probably won't hesitate to turn to Campbell if Cobb struggles. Cobb
passed for 1,165 yards and seven touchdowns in seven games last
season. Campbell threw for 1,117 and four touchdowns in nine games.</TE>
<TE>   Kicker Damon Duval is a preseason All-American who also punts.</TE>
<TE>   Linebackers Karlos Dansby and Dontarrious Thomas and tackle
DeMarco McNeil lead a defense that features typical SEC speed.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll believes his players are ready for the challenge after a
training camp characterized by numerous hamstring and foot problems.
Auburn is the first opponent on a 12-game schedule regarded as one of
the nation's toughest.</TE>
<TE>   "We've worked extremely hard to get to this point," Carroll said.
"Now I just want to see what happens, what we look like and see what
kind of form or shape our team is going to take when we get out
there."</TE>

Bhutto's final two applications to run for Parliament in October,
prompting scattered protests and insistence from Bhutto that she
would campaign anyway.</LD>
<LD>   The government has said Bhutto will face arrest if she returns,
and it was unclear whether she would end her self-imposed exile in
London and the United Arab Emirates.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said Bhutto could not run because of convictions in
absentia on corruption charges. About 2,000 people protested in
Larkana, her hometown, and about 500 in Karachi, the biggest city.</LD>

<HD>Chinese Find a Tempest in Political Tea Leaves</HD>
<DH>Asia: It's still anybody's guess whether President Jiang
will stay or go, because the Communist Party's inner workings are
shrouded in secrecy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>If drinking tea is China's favorite activity, then reading the leaves
may come in second.</LD>
<LD>   That propensity was on display last week after the ruling
Communists finally announced, following much delay, that they would
convene their party congress Nov. 8--a highly anticipated event that
could see the first orderly turnover of power in modern Chinese
history.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of quashing all the political speculation triggered by the
delay, setting the date has pushed the rumor mill here into
overdrive.</LD>
<TE>   Observers--who were already busy parsing every word out of Chinese
officials' mouths, pondering their silences and poring over articles
in the state-run media--next tried to divine the reason for the
relatively late start of the congress, which is held once every five
years.</TE>
<TE>   Some deduced that President Jiang Zemin had succeeded in a
last-minute backstage bid to stay on as party chief, rather than cede
the spotlight as expected to a new generation of leaders. Others were
sure it meant exactly the opposite.</TE>
<TE>   In truth, only Jiang and the tiny inner circle of China's top
leaders know what the pre-scripted outcome of the 16th Communist
Party Congress will be.</TE>
<TE>   And that, perhaps, points to the real lesson to emerge from all
the conjecture: Despite two decades of monumental social and economic
change, with China opening up to the likes of Ikea, the Internet and
international investment, politics at the very top remains stuck in
time. Today's party machinations are as shrouded in mystery as the
palace intrigue of the country's imperial past, impervious to
concepts of public accountability and transparency.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a dangerous way to deliberate a nation's future [and] is
the reason why it is difficult to imagine how China can continue to
make progress into the modern world, much less the democratic world,"
said Orville Schell, a veteran Sinologist at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   This is not to say that governance in China hasn't changed at all
over the years.</TE>
<TE>   At the grass-roots level, the Communist regime trumpets its
experiment in village democracy, in which China's 1 million villages
are supposed to choose their own leaders in free and fair elections.
Although the experiment hasn't been as successful as the government
likes to make out--corruption, party supremacy and even strong-arm
tactics sully the record--some progress has been made in prying open
the previously private dealings of local officials.</TE>
<TE>   At least one province, the free-wheeling, economically advanced
Guangdong, is trying to open some of its provincial-level affairs to
public consultation and review.</TE>
<TE>   And at the pinnacle of power, the days of Mao Tse-tung and Deng
Xiaoping, men who could spark mass movements or set policy with a
single phrase or speech, are over. Jiang, albeit China's No. 1
leader, belongs to a collective of seven senior officials who rule by
consensus as the standing committee of the Politburo.</TE>
<TE>   But their workings--which determine the domestic agenda and
foreign policy of the world's most populous nation--still take place
in secret.</TE>
<TE>   No free press or public watchdog group tries to uncover what goes
on in Zhongnanhai, the government compound in the center of Beijing.
There was a flicker of greater openness in the late 1980s, but it was
extinguished by the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.</TE>
<TE>   Right after that traumatic event, Jiang became the party's general
secretary, then cemented his position as top dog after Deng's death
in 1997 by engineering the removal of two rivals at the 15th
Communist Party Congress that year.</TE>
<TE>   November's conclave was to be the 76-year-old's swan song as party
chief and was meant to usher in China's so-called "fourth generation"
of leaders, including the man widely believed to be in line to take
over, Vice President Hu Jintao.</TE>
<TE>   That the succession may not be proceeding as smoothly as
originally hoped could stem partly from the fact that there is no
blueprint for such a major transfer of power in the 53-year history
of the People's Republic.</TE>
<TE>   "The proliferation of speculation that has centered around the ...
succession issue suggests how poorly structured the Chinese Communist
leadership is in terms of well-established procedure," said Schell,
"especially when it comes to leadership succession issues."</TE>
<TE>   And any procedures that have been laid out "are almost never
followed," he added. "The rule of man trumps the rule of law."</TE>
<TE>   For the laobaixing, China's ordinary folk, the only thing to do is
to wait and to read the tea leaves as best they can.</TE>
<TE>   Recalling the Kremlinology in the days of the Soviet Union,
observers here pay great attention to all sorts of details: who
receives which dignitary, who shows up for which public functions,
what order they stand in for official photographs--even their facial
expressions. (Smiling? Scowling?)</TE>
<TE>   Much of the political speculation revolves around the
government-controlled media, the platform on which past power
struggles have often taken place.</TE>
<TE>   A spate of articles in recent months lionizing Jiang has been
taken as evidence of an attempt on his part, or by his backers, to
garner enough support for him to stay in power. So has what appears
to be an official ban, in force since the spring, on using the phrase
"fourth generation" in describing Hu and other younger leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Such acts of omission and commission feed the rumor frenzy--which,
analysts point out, the leadership could always dissipate with a
clear word or announcement if it chose. That Jiang or his peers
haven't could itself be a sign.</TE>
<TE>   "If everything is on track for Hu to take over, why doesn't Jiang
counter the rumors by saying that everything will be going according
to plan?" said Lucian Pye, an expert in Chinese politics at MIT.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that he has not said that makes it more likely that
there will be a change in plans. Jiang probably is happy with the
rumors because they are one way of preparing public opinion for a
change in plans."</TE>
<TE>   But rumor can cut both ways in the will-he-won't-he guessing game.
Some analysts read newspaper articles extolling Jiang last week as
sounding more like preparation for a send-off than a signal that he
will stay.</TE>
<TE>   And not all dissent has been drowned out.</TE>
<TE>   A recent essay in an influential magazine cast aspersions on
Jiang's leadership by citing all the serious social ills, such as
endemic corruption and the widening disparity in income, that have
arisen during his tenure.</TE>
<TE>   Other critics have attacked Jiang from both the right and left,
including liberals who feel he hasn't been progressive enough, and
unreconstructed Marxists who accuse him of betraying the Communist
Party's roots by allowing entrepreneurs to join.</TE>
<TE>   Some of these critiques have made their way onto the Internet,
whose zooming popularity in China has given political players a new
tool for putting out their viewpoints.</TE>
<TE>   But without an independent press and less biased sources of
information, it's tough for observers to wade through all the
speculation and sniping and figure out who has the upper hand.</TE>
<TE>   As long as the dealings of China's top leaders remain wrapped in a
tight cloak of secrecy, nothing definite can be known about the
upcoming potential leadership reshuffle until the party congress
closes and the new lineup is announced.</TE>
<TE>   "As the big leaders slug it out in the back room," Schell said,
"the public is left to listen to rumors and to wonder.</TE>
<TE>   "This is why opposite rumors and scenarios for the future are
almost equally plausible," he said. "Or equally incredible."</TE>

<HD>Military Action May Get Peace Movement Rolling</HD>
<DH>Activism: It's unlikely that Democrats, not wanting to look
soft on terrorism, will buck the White House's war. So, grass-roots
groups are starting to organize.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHANNA NEUMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>As the debate over President Bush's plans for Iraq grows louder in
Washington, the voice of the nation's peace movement has been muted.</LD>
<LD>   Far from the mainstream, often connected only by the stealth power
of the unseen Internet or the quiet muscle of community activism, the
peace lobby--robust during the Vietnam War and highly visible during
the 1991 Persian Gulf War--has been on the sidelines of public
debate.</LD>
<LD>   Secretaries of State and other guardians of the foreign policy
establishment have taken to the editorial pages of the nation's top
newspapers to argue strategy, tactics and consequences. Commentators
have accused each other of conspiracy to either foment or slow war,
while agreeing that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is an evil force
whose ouster would be universally applauded.</LD>
<TE>   But the peace movement has been under the radar.</TE>
<TE>   "The debate has been fueled by disagreement within the Republican
Party," said Peter Lems of the American Friends Service Committee in
Philadelphia. "People are saying, 'Not now,' or 'Don't do it alone.'
Now comes the debate over whether war is just. That's the challenge
for the faith community, to speak out, to unify and find our voice."</TE>
<TE>   The effort of faith-based antiwar groups and grass-roots community
organizers to protest a proposed war in Iraq is complicated by the
relative silence of most Democrats. Facing reelection contests and
hoping to take political advantage of an uncertain economy, they are
reluctant to look soft on the fight against terrorism. So while
Democrats duck, local organizers are trying to muscle up opposition
to the White House war against Iraq from the grass roots.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Under the Radar'</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't been hearing much about the grass roots," said Jeff
Guntzel, co-coordinator of Voices in the Wilderness, a Chicago-based
activist group. "But a lot's been happening under the radar."</TE>
<TE>   An Internet-based group called moveon.org--born during President
Clinton's impeachment trial with a mission of encouraging Congress to
censure the president and then move on to other business--has
embraced the cause.</TE>
<TE>   In Senate offices across the country last week, Americans who had
embraced moveon.org's cause came to press the case against war in
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   In the offices of Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), Norman Tate, an
86-year-old from the small fishing village of Port Clyde about an
hour from the state Capitol in Augusta, talked about the antiwar
movement during the Vietnam conflict, recalling that it took eight
years of organizing and the lives of 58,000 Americans to stop the
war.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very moving," said Eli Pariser, who organized the
nationwide senatorial outreach for moveon.org and estimates that more
than 5,000 people participated.</TE>
<TE>   Plans are underway for a day of resistance against the possible
war. There are Internet petition drives and postcard campaigns. There
are alternate events planned to commemorate Sept. 11 ("We grieve the
loss but speak for peace, not war," is how one participant put it),
and calls for a day of protest Oct. 7, the anniversary of the
beginning of the U.S. bombing of Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   But activists admit that marshaling a country against war will not
be easy. "People are overwhelmed with so many issues," said Gordon
Clark, who is organizing a mass protest of civil disobedience called
a Pledge of Resistance. "We think it is really picking up steam now."</TE>
<TE>   Grass-roots organizers also note that the protests have so far
been muted in part because of several important changes in a new
generation's approach to activism.</TE>
<TE>   The first is an emphasis on individual effort, not mass rallies.
"A 500,000-person protest against the Gulf War and a 100,000-person
protest against the war in Afghanistan didn't bring about policy
change," said Micah White, who with a handful of students at
Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania runs the Internet site
www.why-war.com. "That has been acknowledged by people within the
antiwar movement."</TE>
<TE>   A related change, White noted, is that opponents plan to "put
their bodies on the line," traveling to Iraq to witness war and
report their observations--much as American Adam Shapiro did in going
to the West Bank on behalf of the pro-Palestinian group International
Solidarity. Shapiro ended up spending a night in Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat's then-blockaded Ramallah compound.</TE>
<TE>   "We will definitely be seeing that tactic here," agreed Guntzel,
of Voices of the Wilderness.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   An Advance Team</TE>
<TE>   "A large group will go in advance of any attack in Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   Guntzel noted that many protesters come from the ranks of the
anti-globalization movement, eager to torpedo policy on the front
lines. "They have ushered in a new style of protest," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Then too, there is the Internet, which links activists in
different states behind shared goals, crossing political, geographic
and economic distinctions. "There is less and less meeting in church
basements," said Lems of the American Friends Committee. "Now we're
doing more online. It's a more potent tool."</TE>
<TE>   But perhaps the greatest strategic advantage of the peace lobby in
rallying public opinion against war in Iraq is the 11 years of
sanctions imposed on that country after the Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unlikely that Bush could have picked a worse target for his
second step," said White, one of the Swarthmore students fomenting
against war.</TE>
<TE>   "People have been refuting the arguments behind the sanctions on
Iraq for many years."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats voting against war in Iraq after Hussein invaded Kuwait
in 1990 argued that the U.S. government should give sanctions a
chance to work, that it should let economic pressure force the Iraqi
leader's hand.</TE>
<TE>   Now, says Guntzel, who has a new Internet site at
www.iraqpeaceteam.org, "a dozen years and many thousand senseless
deaths later we know that sanctions are war. And we know that an
economic war can be just as deadly as a war fought with armies."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>PITTSBURGH STEELERS</LD>
<LD>   &lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;</LD>
<LD>   &lt;/TABLE&gt;</LD>
<TE>   Coach: Bill Cowher, 11th season.</TE>
<TE>   Last season's record: 13-3, first in AFC Central. Lost to Patriots
in AFC championship game.</TE>
<TE>   Who's in: LB James Farrior (Jets), K Todd Peterson (Chiefs).</TE>
<TE>   Who's out: K Kris Brown, G Roger Duffy, WR Troy Edwards, LB Earl
Holmes, WR Bobby Shaw, CB Jason Simmons.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Steelers were a surprise team last season, as quarterback
Kordell Stewart came into his own. The defense, while not the "Steel
Curtain," played in typically smothering fashion, allowing an average
of only 230 total yards a game and giving up more than two touchdowns
in a game twice. But Jerome Bettis remains a question mark because of
his knees and groin problems of years past, and the receiving game is
still not complete, in spite of Plaxico Burress' improvement. Even
so, the Steelers are better than most.</TE>
<TE>   Parting shot: Give the Steelers the benefit of the doubt,
especially with a coach such as Cowher. But there isn't much room for
error now that the Browns are legit.</TE>
<TE>*--*
CLEVELAND BROWNS</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Butch Davis, second season.</TE>
<TE>   Last season's record: 7-9, tied for third in AFC Central.</TE>
<TE>   Who's in: DT Damian Gregory (Dolphins), S Robert Griffith
(Vikings), LB Earl Holmes (Steelers), DE Kenard Lang (Redskins), G
Barry Stokes (Packers), T Ryan Tucker (Rams).</TE>
<TE>   Who's out: G Jeremy McKinney, OL Roman Oben, TE O.J. Santiago, LB
Wali Rainer.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Davis brought a sense of respect last season, and the
Browns even flirted with the idea of a playoff run midway through the
season. The key this season is the continued improvement of Tim Couch
and the emergence of rookie running back William Green. If they play
as advertised, this could be a special season. And if the Steelers
stumble, Cleveland could sneak in as the AFC North divisional winner.</TE>
<TE>   Parting shot: Could the Browns be this season's version of the
Patriots?</TE>
<TE>*--*
BALTIMORE RAVENS</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Brian Billick, fourth season.</TE>
<TE>   Last season's record: 10-6, second in AFC Central. Lost to
Steelers in playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Who's in: QB Jeff Blake (Saints).</TE>
<TE>   Who's out: DT Sam Adams, DE Rob Burnett, QB Randall Cunningham, FB
Sam Gash, QB Elvis Grbac, S Corey Harris, WR Qadry Ismail, WR Patrick
Johnson, WR Jermaine Lewis, G Leon Searcy, TE Shannon Sharpe, LB
Jamie Sharper, DT Tony Siragusa, CB Duane Starks, DT Larry Webster, S
Rod Woodson.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Just take a look at the "Who's in, Who's out" lists above
and you'll know what to expect: not much. Chris Redman takes over at
quarterback after Grbac quit the NFL. About the only big-time player
left on offense is RB Jamal Lewis, who is coming off a knee injury.
Ray Lewis leads a defense ravaged by free agent losses and salary cap
cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Parting shot: Two seasons ago, the Ravens were the most dominant
team in football. This season, they'll be lucky to win six games.</TE>
<TE>*--*
CINCINNATI BENGALS</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Dick LeBeau, third season.</TE>
<TE>   Last season's record: 6-10, tied for fifth in AFC Central.</TE>
<TE>   Who's in: CB Jeff Burris (Colts), QB Gus Frerotte (Broncos), DE
Eric Ogbogu (Jets), WR Michael Westbrook (Redskins, injured).</TE>
<TE>   Who's out: TE Marco Battaglia, SS Chris Carter, TE Tony McGee, WR
Darnay Scott, S Darryl Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Corey Dillon is one of the best running backs in the
game. Peter Warrick is an emerging receiver. The offensive line isn't
bad. But quarterback continues to be a weakness for the Bengals, and
the defense is barely above average. What's it all mean? Another
dismal season for this dismal franchise.</TE>
<TE>   Parting shot: It's a wonder Bengals fans still bother showing up.
They haven't had a team worth rooting for in 13 seasons.</TE>

<BD>BY NEWSDAY IN PREDICTED ORDER OF FINISH BY DIVISION</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>TENNESSEE TITANS</LD>
<LD>   Coach: Jeff Fisher, ninth season.</LD>
<LD>   Last season's record: 7-9, tied for third in AFC Central.</LD>
<TE>   Who's in: FB Greg Comella (Giants), S Lance Schulters (49ers) and
C Jeff Smith (Jaguars).</TE>
<TE>   Who's out: S Blaine Bishop, CB Michael Booker, DE Josh Evans, LB
Greg Favors, DT Jason Fisk, CB DeRon Jenkins, G Bruce Matthews, LB
Eddie Robinson, WR Chris Sanders.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The Titans were favored by many to go to the Super Bowl
last season, but flubbed the opportunity because of injuries and
inconsistency. But if quarterback Steve McNair and running back Eddie
George hold up this season, there should be a turnaround. The Titans
still have a solid roster, and don't forget about defensive end Jevon
Kearse, one of the most feared pass rushers in the game.</TE>
<TE>   Parting shot: When you play in a division with Houston and
Jacksonville, you're already ahead of the game. Look for the Titans
to edge Indianapolis for the divisional crown.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   INDIANAPOLIS COLTS</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Tony Dungy, first season with Colts.</TE>
<TE>   Last season's record: 6-10, fourth in AFC East.</TE>
<TE>   Who's in: DT James Cannida (Buccaneers), LB Greg Favors (Titans),
CB Walt Harris (Bears), WR Qadry Ismail (Ravens), G Jim Pyne
(Eagles), TE Jermaine Wiggins (Patriots).</TE>
<TE>   Who's out: Coach Jim Mora, CB Jeff Burris, S Chad Cota, TE Ken
Dilger, WR Trevor Insley, G Steve McKinney, WR Jerome Pathon, RB
Dominic Rhodes (injured), DT Mike Wells, WR Terrence Wilkins.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Dungy inherits one of the league's most prolific
offenses, but the big challenge is adding a defense to match. It will
take some time, because the Colts simply don't have the horses.
Anything will be an improvement over last season, when the Colts were
pushed around just about every week.</TE>
<TE>   Parting shot: Colts should have a nice bounce-back season with
Dungy, whose defensive scheme will help make up for a lack of talent.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   JACKSONVILLE JAGUARS</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Tom Coughlin, eighth season.</TE>
<TE>   Last season's record: 6-10, tied for fifth in AFC Central.</TE>
<TE>   Who's in: DE Stalin Colinet (Vikings), WR Patrick Johnson
(Ravens), TE Pete Mitchell (Lions), DT Tim Morabito (Panthers), G
Chris Naeole (Saints).</TE>
<TE>   Who's out: CB Aaron Beasley, T Tony Boselli, LB Kevin Hardy, K
Mike Hollis, WR Keenan McCardell, LB Hardy Nickerson, DT Seth Payne,
C Jeff Smith, DT Gary Walker, DE Renaldo Wynn.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Coughlin didn't handle his salary cap situation several
seasons ago, and it became so unwieldy that he had to go through a
wholesale roster purge in the off-season. That means there isn't much
left, other than quarterback Mark Brunell and running back Fred
Taylor. In fact, Coughlin said he had more pure talent in 1995, when
the Jaguars were a first-season expansion team.</TE>
<TE>   Parting shot: Coughlin got a contract extension in the off-season,
but a 3-13 record might mean curtains.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   HOUSTON TEXANS</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Dom Capers, formerly a head coach for the Carolina
Panthers.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Considering the Texans are a first-year expansion team,
they have a decent amount of talent that features former Jet
cornerbacks Aaron Glenn and Marcus Coleman, kick returner Jermaine
Lewis, receiver Corey Bradford and linebacker Jamie Sharper.
Quarterback David Carr, the first overall pick out of Fresno State,
seems to have a bright future ahead. That said, this will be a
difficult season for the Texans, who already have significant injury
problems along the offensive line. The long-term prospects appear
bright, but there will be the usual growing pains that every
expansion franchise experiences.</TE>
<TE>   Parting shot: One thing you can say for the Texans--at least
they're not the Lions.</TE>

<BD>BY NEWSDAY IN PREDICTED ORDER OF FINISH BY DIVISION</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>OAKLAND RAIDERS</LD>
<LD>   Coach: Bill Callahan, first season.</LD>
<LD>   Last season record: 10-6, first in AFC West. Lost to Patriots in
second-round playoff game.</LD>
<TE>   Who's in: DT Sam Adams (Ravens), DT John Parrella (Chargers), LB
Bill Romanowski (Broncos), CB Terrance Shaw (Patriots), S Rod Woodson
(Ravens).</TE>
<TE>   Who's out: Coach Jon Gruden, DT Grady Jackson, QB Rodney Peete, S
Marquez Pope, DT Darrell Russell (suspension), CB Terrance Shaw, LB
William Thomas, G Steve Wisniewski.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The loss of Gruden is huge, but Callahan is fortunate to
inherit a veteran team that can help ease the transition. Jerry Rice
and Tim Brown still get it done, and Rich Gannon remains an efficient
and elusive quarterback. The defense is iffy, although the
acquisition of Adams and Parrella will help against the run. The rest
of the division is beatable, so Oakland should manage to repeat as
AFC West champs. They don't get very far in the playoffs, though.</TE>
<TE>   Parting shot: This thirtysomething team keeps getting older.
That's not the way championships are won.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SAN DIEGO CHARGERS</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Marty Schottenheimer, first season with Chargers.</TE>
<TE>   Last season's record: 5-11, fifth in AFC West.</TE>
<TE>   Who's in: TE Stephen Alexander (Redskins), LB Donnie Edwards
(Chiefs), DT Jason Fisk (Titans), G Bob Hallen (Falcons), C Cory
Raymer (Redskins), KR Tamarick Vanover (free agent).</TE>
<TE>   Who's out: Coach Mike Riley, LB Gerald Dixon, WR Jeff Graham, LB
John Holecek, TE Freddie Jones, DT John Parrella.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Schottenheimer inherits a decent young team that has
quarterback Drew Brees at the helm and running back LaDainian
Tomlinson anchoring the rushing attack. The receivers are only
average, but the line is decent. The defense is better than most, and
Junior Seau is still at the top of his game. A cushy early schedule
should get the Chargers out of the gate quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Parting shot: Looking for a surprise team this season? How about
the Chargers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DENVER BRONCOS</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Mike Shanahan, eighth season with Broncos.</TE>
<TE>   Last season's record: 8-8, third in AFC West.</TE>
<TE>   Who's in: T Blake Brockermeyer (Bears), DT Lional Dalton (Ravens),
S Izell Reese (Cowboys), T Ephraim Salaam (Falcons), TE Shannon
Sharpe (Ravens).</TE>
<TE>   Who's out: CB Eric Brown, RB Terrell Davis (injured), QB Gus
Frerotte, FB Howard Griffith, DT Leion Lett, LB Bill Romanowski, FB
Detron Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The Broncos sustained a major blow when Davis went down
with his latest knee problems, although there is depth at running
back with tailbacks Olandis Gary and Clinton Portis, and fullback
Mike Anderson. Quarterback Brian Griese is coming off an ineffective
season, and his leadership is being questioned. The defense, which
was so-so last season, hasn't gotten appreciably better.</TE>
<TE>   Parting shot: If Griese doesn't show improvement, this could be
Steve Beuerlein's team before long.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   KANSAS CITY CHIEFS</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Dick Vermeil, second season with Chiefs.</TE>
<TE>   Last season's record: 6-10, fourth in AFC West.</TE>
<TE>   Who's in: K Morten Andersen (Giants), WR Marc Boerigter (CFL), WR
Johnnie Morton (Lions), T Willie Roaf (Saints).</TE>
<TE>   Who's out: WR Derrick Alexander, LB Donnie Edwards, K Todd
Peterson, T Victor Riley.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Vermeil came out of retirement a second time and quickly
realized he had another massive rebuilding project. Only this time,
he doesn't have Kurt Warner to do the heavy lifting. Quarterback
Trent Green was horrible last season, and the nasty holdout of tight
end Tony Gonzalez didn't help matters. The defense is decent, but
needs to be better.</TE>
<TE>   Parting shot: Vermeil could have walked off into the sunset with a
Super Bowl trophy under his arm. Instead, he's headed for more
misery.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Officials at Boron High have decided to drop the school's varsity
football program for the 2002 season because of a lack of
participation.</LD>
<LD>   Boron, which finished 1-9 last year, had only 11 players out for
the varsity team this season. Coach Todd Fink said the team will play
a junior varsity schedule.</LD>
<LD>   Four years ago, Boron defeated Redlands Arrowhead Christian, 21-6,
in the Southern Section Division XII championship game. Two years
ago, the Bobcats reached the quarterfinals of the playoffs after
winning the Desert Mountain League title.</LD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Arkansas State or Louisiana State, Virginia Tech still dominated.</LD>
<LD>   The No. 16 Hokies followed a season-opening laugher against
Arkansas State with an impressive 26-8 victory against No. 14
Louisiana State on Sunday at Blacksburg, Va., using an opportunistic
defense.</LD>
<LD>   "If you can play defense and get a few points off your kicking
game and let your offense keep getting better, that's a good plan,"
Coach Frank Beamer said after only his fourth victory against a top
15 team in 25 tries.</LD>
<TE>   The Hokies (2-0) managed only 231 yards, but gave up only 214 and
scored when a 17-yard punt return by DeAngelo Hall set up a 27-yard
touchdown drive and a blocked punt set up a 29-yard touchdown march.
Their third touchdown, after a 58-yard drive, was set up by an
interception.</TE>
<TE>   All three touchdowns came on the ground, with Lee Suggs, who
gained 89 yards in 23 carries, scoring from six and two yards and
Kevin Jones scoring from the two as the Hokies loaded the line
against the Tigers and challenged them to try to stop the tailbacks.</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky 22, No. 17 Louisville 17--Taylor Begley kicked three
field goals and the Wildcat defense dominated the Cardinals and
quarterback Dave Ragone at Louisville, Ky.</TE>
<TE>   Jared Lorenzen passed for 195 yards and a touchdown as the
Wildcats ended a three-game losing streak to the Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   Ragone, touted as a Heisman Trophy candidate, spent most of the
game on the run from Kentucky's pass rush. He was sacked three times,
completed 14 of 39 for 193 yards and had a touchdown pass and an
interception.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals managed only 248 yards against a Kentucky defense
that ranked 109th in the nation in yards allowed last season.</TE>
<TE>   Hawaii 61, Eastern Illinois 36--Timmy Chang passed for 374 yards
and three touchdowns as the Warriors defeated the Panthers Saturday
night in Honolulu in the season opener for both teams.</TE>
<TE>   Chang, who sat out most of last season after suffering a wrist
injury in the third game, completed 19 of 30 passes, including
scoring passes of 13, 59 and 19 yards.</TE>

<HD>Minnesota Lineman Hall Is Shot to Death</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brandon Hall, a 19-year-old redshirt freshman at Minnesota, was shot
to death early Sunday, hours after playing in his first college game.</LD>
<LD>   Hall, a reserve defensive lineman, died after a dispute between a
group of players that included Hall and three other men near a
downtown Minneapolis bar, police said.</LD>
<LD>   "To the best of my knowledge, Brandon Hall was an innocent
victim," Minnesota Coach Glen Mason said.</LD>
<TE>   The 6-foot-5, 270-pound Hall made one tackle in the Golden
Gophers' 42-0 season-opening victory over Southwest Texas State on
Saturday night at the Metrodome.</TE>
<TE>   About 2 a.m. Sunday, Hall was with some teammates about eight
blocks northwest of the stadium when they were contacted by another
player who claimed he was robbed by three men, police spokeswoman
Cyndi Barrington said. The players found the men and confronted them.</TE>
<TE>   As the players approached, the three men began walking away and
got into a parked van, Barrington said. One of the men then got out
of the van and walked toward the players.</TE>
<TE>   "At that point, someone in the group said, 'He's got a gun! He's
got a gun!' and they scattered," Barrington said. "But the suspect
was still able to take a shot."</TE>
<TE>   A handgun was recovered and the three men were arrested, but they
had not yet been charged.</TE>
<TE>   Mason canceled Sunday's practice and said he wasn't sure when the
team would meet again. Athletic Director Joel Maturi said counselors
would be available to the players.</TE>
<TE>   "These are all things that none of us have been taught to deal
with," Maturi said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee linebacker Kevin Burnett probably will be sidelined the
rest of the season after tearing a ligament in his left knee Saturday
during the Volunteers' 47-7 season-opening victory over Wyoming.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Phillip Fulmer said that a precise diagnosis had not been
made, but team doctors suspected a torn anterior cruciate ligament.
An MRI was scheduled for today, and Fulmer said Burnett might have
surgery within three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "That's another tough loss to our football team," Fulmer said.</TE>
<TE>   The Volunteers lost another defensive starter two weeks ago when
senior end Constantin Ritzmann tore the ACL in his left knee.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   North Carolina's inexperienced defense got even thinner when
starting end Eric Davis was lost for the season after tearing a
ligament in his left knee.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-3, 268-pound senior made his first start Saturday night in
North Carolina's 27-21 loss to Miami (Ohio) and had recovered a
fumble in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Davis was injured midway through the third quarter when his left
foot stuck in the soggy ground and his knee buckled as he was being
blocked by two Miami players.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Starting cornerback Toure Francis of Clemson probably will be
sidelined the rest of the season because of a torn knee ligament.</TE>
<TE>   He will undergo an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the
damage to his ACL.</TE>
<TE>   Francis played 12 snaps against Georgia on Saturday night before
injuring the knee.</TE>

<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DEL MAR</DL>
<LD>Given his first chance at a marathon distance in this country Sunday,
Delta Form showed why he is a six-time winner in his native South
Africa.</LD>
<LD>   Given an impeccable ride by new jockey Goncalino Almeida, the
6-year-old gelding and 20-1 shot threaded his way through a bulky
field to defeat The Tin Man and eight others and win the $250,000 Del
Mar Handicap.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by movie producer Gary Barber, Barry Irwin and Jeff Siegel's
Team Valor, and trained by Jenine Sahadi, Delta Form not only earned
his second victory in his fifth U.S. start, but also set a course
record for 1 3/8 miles on the turf. His time was 2:12.15, eclipsing
the mark of 2:12.32 set by Arbiter on July 25.</LD>
<TE>   Almeida, who took over for Mike Smith on the Australian-bred when
Smith stayed with The Tin Man, had worked Delta Form six days earlier
and went into the Grade II feeling he had a legitimate chance.</TE>
<TE>   "I rode this horse with a lot of confidence today because of
Jenine," Almeida said. "When I worked him for her, she just said to
me, 'You know this horse, you ride him.' When a trainer says that to
you, your confidence goes way up. You can ride your race and not have
to worry about a lot of instructions. If you have that confidence,
you can do many things. I'm happy for Jenine. She trusts me and I'm
glad she got rewarded for it."</TE>
<TE>   This was the second stakes win of the day for Team Valor. Earlier
at Woodbine in Toronto, their 2-year-old, Added Edge, won the
$100,000 Silver Deputy Stakes.</TE>
<TE>   Making his first start since winning Hollywood Park's American
Handicap on July 4 and in his first race beyond 1 1/8 miles, The Tin
Man, who was very wide early, opened up a half-length lead in the
stretch, but was caught late. He finished a length in front of 8-1
shot Blue Steller.</TE>
<TE>   Blue Steller was one of two horses that trainer Bobby Frankel ran
in his quest to win the Del Mar Handicap for a third consecutive
year. The other was Dance Dreamer, who finished eighth as the 5-2
favorite.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wayne Lukas says Orientate is the best sprinter in the country and
it's hard to argue with the hall-of-fame trainer.</TE>
<TE>   The 4-year-old son of Mt. Livermore won his fourth in a row,
beating 19-10 second choice Aldebaran by 2 1/4 lengths in the
$250,000 Forego Handicap at Saratoga.</TE>
<TE>   Disproving the notion that he needs the lead to himself to run his
best race, the 9-5 favorite dispatched of 2001 Breeders' Cup Sprint
winner Squirtle Squirt through rapid fractions (21 2/5 and 44 1/5 for
the half-mile), drew clear and was never challenged. Squirtle Squirt
faded to fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Orientate, owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis, won for the ninth time
in 18 starts and is now four for five at Saratoga.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he went to the head of the class today," said Lukas after
Orientate completed the 6 1/2 furlongs in 1:15 3/5 under jockey Jerry
Bailey. "We could very easily train this horse to the Breeders' Cup
[Sprint on Oct. 26 at Arlington Park] and that would be my first
choice right now, but I may feel differently in a few weeks."</TE>
<TE>   If Orientate does run again before the Breeders' Cup, Lukas
mentioned Belmont Park's $300,000 Vosburgh on Sept. 21 or the
$250,000 Phoenix Breeders' Cup on Oct. 5 at Keeneland.</TE>

<TE>   Genuine Strawfly, an 8-1 shot, beat 7-10 favorite Tres Seis to win
the $219,403 All American Derby at Ruidoso Downs.</TE>

<LD>Horse racing fans will have plenty to pay attention to on this
holiday with interesting races everywhere from Del Mar to Saratoga
and many places in between.</LD>
<LD>   Congaree's owners hope a new rider--Mike Smith--will get their
horse back in the winner's circle after consecutive flops in
California and Kentucky. Congaree takes on five others in the
$250,000 Del Mar Breeders' Cup Handicap at one mile.</LD>
<LD>   Saratoga wraps up another successful meet with an 11-race program,
headed by $100,000 Saranac, a Grade III at 1 1/16 miles on the turf;
Philadelphia Park offers the $500,000 Pennsylvania Derby featuring
the return of Harlan's Holiday and even River Downs gets into the act
with the $200,000 Cradle Stakes for 2-year-olds at 1 1/16 miles.</LD>
<TE>   The River Downs race is part of a national pick three. The $1
minimum wager asks bettors to select the winner of the Cradle, the
$150,000 Arlington Matron at Arlington Park and the $125,000 Solana
Beach Handicap at Del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   There's also a significant quarter horse race. What is arguably
the best field ever assembled at Ruidoso Downs will compete in the
$2,050,000 All American Futurity.</TE>
<TE>   The field for the 440-yard Grade I is topped by the Dutch Masters
III-owned entry of Flys R Streakin and Meteoric, Rainbow Futurity
winner First To Flash and AB What A Runner. Race of the day: The
seventh at Del Mar is a wide-open turf marathon (1 3/8 miles) and
drew a full field of 10.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Warren Stute. The trainer, who will turn 81 on Sept.
30, continues to win at a high percentage and his win with 11-1 shot
Miss Houdini in Saturday's Del Mar Debutante came 51 years after he
won the inaugural Debutante with Tonga.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Scott Lake. Unless he wins the seventh today with
Thuderello, America's second-leading trainer in terms of victories
will finish 0-for-Saratoga.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four using Special Matter, Taormina
and Gypsy Road in the seventh, singling Kela in the eighth,
Swordfish, Balenos and Infinite Faith in the ninth and Golden Cortez,
Pacific Colony and Magnetic Hill in the 10th.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 1/69. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $4.20/$405. Total money bet: $598.</TE>

<HD>Sauers' Third Win Has a Sweet Reward</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Gene Sauers won what might have been the last Air Canada
Championship, closing with a two-under 69 on Sunday for a one-stroke
victory over Steve Lowery at Surrey, Canada.</LD>
<LD>   The 40-year-old Sauers, who hasn't had a full PGA Tour card since
1996, finished with a 15-under 267 for his third tour victory and
first since 1989. The 13-year gap between wins is the third longest
in tour history.</LD>
<LD>   Lowery, who finished second to Joel Edwards last year, shot a 68,
missing an eight-foot birdie putt on the final hole.</LD>
<TE>   Sauers, who came into the week 217th on the money list after
playing only three events this year, earned $630,000, his biggest
payday ever and almost as much as he made in the last eight years.</TE>
<TE>   He might not get a chance to defend the title, with the future of
the event in doubt. Air Canada's four-year sponsorship ended this
week.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Patricia Meunier-Labouc won her first LPGA Tour title, shooting a
five-under 67 for a two-stroke victory in the State Farm Classic at
Springfield, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   Meunier-Labouc, playing her second season on the LPGA Tour after
winning five times on the Ladies European Tour, had an 18-under 270
total on the Rail Golf Course and won $165,000. Se Ri Pak and Mi Hyun
Kim tied for second at 16-under 272.</TE>
<TE>   Emilee Klein played her way onto the U.S. Solheim Cup team,
closing with a 69 to tie for fourth at 15 under with rookie Beth
Bauer (67) and Laura Davies (67).</TE>
<TE>   Klein, who began the week 13th in the race for the 10 automatic
spots, jumped to 10th, with the top 11 earning shots because No. 5
Dottie Pepper is sidelined by a shoulder injury. Patty Sheehan
completed the squad by adding Kelly Robbins and Pat Hurst as
captain's picks.</TE>
<TE>   Juli Inkster, Laura Diaz, Rosie Jones, Michele Redman, Cristie
Kerr, Meg Mallon, Beth Daniel, Wendy Ward and Kelli Kuehne also
earned automatic spots on the U.S. team for the Sept. 20-22 matches
against Europe at Interlachen in Edina, Minn.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bob Gilder shot a four-under 67 in a head-to-head duel with John
Bland to win the Allianz Championship by one stroke at West Des
Moines, Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   Gilder had to make a four-foot putt on 18 to secure his third
victory on the Senior PGA Tour this year. He came back from two
strokes down with eight holes to play and finished at 13-under 200.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Bjorn ended his 18-month title drought by winning the BMW
International Open at Nord-Eichenreid, Germany, with a 24-under 264.</TE>
<TE>   Track and Field</TE>
<TE>   Coby Miller won the 100 meters at an international meet in Padua,
Italy, finishing in 10.10 seconds. Olympic pole vault champion Stacy
Dragila won the women's event with a leap of 15 feet, 1 3/4 inches.</TE>
<TE>   Amer Garcia defeated fellow Cuban Yoel Hernandez in the 110-meter
hurdles, clocking 13.37. Astrid Kumbernuss of Germany won the women's
shotput with a throw of 63-9.</TE>

<BD>BY NEWSDAY IN PREDICTED ORDER OF FINISH BY DIVISION</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>PHILADELPHIA EAGLES</LD>
<LD>   Coach: Andy Reid, fourth season.</LD>
<LD>   Last season's record: 11-5, first in NFC East. Lost in NFC
championship game to the Rams.</LD>
<TE>   Who's in: LB Shawn Barber (Redskins), S Blaine Bishop (Titans), RB
Dorsey Levens (Packers), LB Levon Kirkland (Seahawks).</TE>
<TE>   Who's out: LB Mike Caldwell, C Bubba Miller, S Damon Moore, G Jim
Pyne, LB Jeremiah Trotter.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Eagles need second-year WR Freddie Mitchell, their 2001
first-round pick, to improve and make the passing game more
effective. Untested Barry Gardner and Kirkland fill the void left by
Trotter, who bolted the Eagles after a bitter contract dispute. RB
Duce Staley is healthy again, and needs to take the heat off QB
Donovan McNabb.</TE>
<TE>   Parting shot: Eagles take the next step after a terrific 2001
season. It's on to San Diego. It's on to the first Super Bowl win in
franchise history.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DALLAS COWBOYS</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Dave Campo, third season.</TE>
<TE>   Last season's record: 5-11, fifth in NFC East.</TE>
<TE>   Who's in: DT La'Roi Glover (Saints), LB Kevin Hardy (Jaguars), QB
Chad Hutchinson (free agent), CB Bryant Westbrook (Lions).</TE>
<TE>   Who's out: TE Jackie Harris, S Izell Reese, C Mark Stepnoski, S
George Teague, WR Rocket Ismail (injured).</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Cowboys need to settle on a permanent quarterback. Quincy
Carter gets the nod for now, but the team is also high on Hutchinson,
who has given up his pursuit of a baseball career. The defense
emerged last season, finishing fourth overall, and influx of free
agents Hardy, Glover and Westbrook, as well as drafting of S Roy
Williams, should help. The rushing offense remains solid with Emmitt
Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Parting shot: The passing offense was last in the NFL in 2001.
Even with a modest improvement, the Cowboys could get back to at
least .500.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WASHINGTON REDSKINS</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Steve Spurrier, first season.</TE>
<TE>   Last season's record: 8-8, second in NFC East.</TE>
<TE>   Who's in: LB Jessie Armstead (Giants), WR Jacquez Green
(Buccaneers), OL Rod Jones (Rams), G David Loverne (trade, Jets), QB
Shane Matthews (Bears), LB Jeremiah Trotter (Eagles), QB Danny
Wuerffel (trade, Texans), DE Renaldo Wynn (Jaguars).</TE>
<TE>   Who's out: Coach Marty Schottenheimer, TE Stephen Alexander, QB
Tony Banks, LB Shawn Barber, QB Kent Graham, LB Robert Jones, DE
Kenard Lang, C Cory Raymer, G Dave Szott, WR Michael Westbrook.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Spurrier comes to the NFL after a brilliant career at
Florida, but will his pass-oriented system work at the next level?
The defense showed remarkable improvement over the second half of
last season. LaVar Arrington had a monster season and is ready to be
a star.</TE>
<TE>   Parting shot: Spurrier earned a reputation for creating
championship teams with mediocre quarterbacks. If he can do that with
the Redskins, he's a genius.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NEW YORK GIANTS</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Jim Fassel, sixth season.</TE>
<TE>   Last season's record: 7-9, tied for third in NFC East.</TE>
<TE>   Who's in: TE Jeremy Shockey (first-round draft choice).</TE>
<TE>   Who's out: K Morten Andersen, LB Jessie Armstead, T Lomas Brown,
FB Greg Comella, TE Howard Cross, S Sam Garnes, WR Joe Jurevicius, G
Glenn Parker, G Ron Stone.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: After a host of free-agent losses--some of the driven by
the salary cap, others by choice--Fassel is left with inexperience at
several positions. Johnnie Lynn takes over for John Fox as defensive
coordinator, although the Giants plan will use largely the same
scheme. Chemistry an issue after off-season spat between Michael
Strahan and Tiki Barber over Strahan's contract negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Parting shot: Too much roster turnover, not enough help from
outside.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>GREEN BAY PACKERS</LD>
<LD>   Coach: Mike Sherman, third season.</LD>
<LD>   Last season's record: 12-4, second in NFC Central. Lost to Rams in
second-round playoff game.</LD>
<TE>   Who's in: WR Terry Glenn (trade, Patriots), DE Joe Johnson
(Saints).</TE>
<TE>   Who's out: WR Corey Bradford, S LeRoy Butler (retired), DT Santana
Dotson, LB Bernardo Harris, RB Dorsey Levens, WR Bill Schroeder, DE
John Thierry.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Huge turnover at receiver, as Packers take a chance on
mercurial Glenn, who flamed out in New England. The good news: Brett
Favre can make any receiver look good. The addition of Johnson to
defensive line is very promising; he's as solid as they come. The
Packers need to make up for the loss of Butler, who retired because
of a shoulder injury.</TE>
<TE>   Parting shot: Sherman kept this team together in remarkable
fashion last season. He wins the division this time around and hopes
for home-field advantage throughout playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CHICAGO BEARS</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Dick Jauron, fourth season.</TE>
<TE>   Last season's record: 13-3, first in NFC Central. Lost to Eagles
in playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Who's in: LB Mike Caldwell (Eagles), QB Chris Chandler (Falcons),
DT Jason Wiltz (Jets).</TE>
<TE>   Who's out: RB James Allen, T Blake Brockermeyer, CB Walt Harris,
QB Shane Matthews, S Tony Parrish, QB Danny Wuerffel.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The addition of Chandler makes the quarterback situation
tenuous. Jim Miller is the starter, but for how long? Bears were one
of the biggest surprises last season, but won't have the element of
surprise. The run defense was terrific last year (second overall),
but pass defense was woeful (29th). Brian Urlacher has quickly become
a star; Ray Lewis might be the only one better on defense.</TE>
<TE>   Parting shot: It'll be hard to duplicate last season, especially
with an almost quarterback controversy on their hands. At least their
division isn't overpowering.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MINNESOTA VIKINGS</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Mike Tice, first season.</TE>
<TE>   Last season's record: 5-11, fourth in NFC Central.</TE>
<TE>   Who's in: WR Derrick Alexander (Chiefs), S Ronnie Bradford
(Falcons), K Doug Brien (Buccaneers), DE Lorenzo Bromell (Dolphins),
LB Henri Crockett (Falcons), DE Kenny Mixon (Dolphins), P Kyle
Richardson (Ravens), DE Chuck Wiley (Falcons).</TE>
<TE>   Who's out: Coach Dennis Green, K Gary Anderson, G Brad Badger, P
Mitch Berger, WR Cris Carter, DE Stalin Colinet, S Robert Griffith,
LB Ed McDaniel, WR Jake Reed, S Orlando Thomas, LB Kailee Wong.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Tice wasted no time in remaking the roster, especially on
defense, by bringing in a host of free agents. This team is still a
threat offensively, although not like before, because Carter's
retirement means there's no threat opposite Randy Moss. But Daunte
Culpepper is an elite quarterback, and the team is high on
second-season running back Michael Bennett.</TE>
<TE>   Parting shot: This will be a better team than last season, and
might even surprise a few people along the way. Playoffs? It's not
impossible.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DETROIT LIONS</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Marty Mornhinweg, second season.</TE>
<TE>   Last season's record: 2-14, fifth in NFC Central.</TE>
<TE>   Who's in: LB Jeff Gooch (Buccaneers), WR Az-Zahir Hakim (Rams), QB
Joey Harrington (first-round pick), S Corey Harris (Ravens), WR Bill
Schroeder (Packers).</TE>
<TE>   Who's out: QB Charlie Batch, LB Stephen Boyd, WR Herman Moore, WR
Johnnie Morton, DE Tracy Scroggins, TE David Sloan, CB Bryant
Westbrook.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The Lions were lucky to avoid becoming the first team in
NFL to go winless in a 16-game season. Quarterback is the key issue,
as the Lions have two young ones in Harrington and Mike McMahon, The
running game is mediocre, which makes it even tougher on the passer.</TE>
<TE>   Parting shot: There are high school coaches better than
Mornhinweg.</TE>

<LD>TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS</LD>
<LD>   Coach: Jon Gruden, first season with Buccaneers.</LD>
<LD>   Last season's record: 9-7, third in NFC Central.</LD>
<TE>   Who's in: TE Marco Battaglia (Redskins), TE Ken Dilger (Colts), G
Kerry Jenkins (Jets), QB Rob Johnson (Bills), WR Joe Jurevicius
(Giants), Keenan McCardell (Jaguars), T Roman Oben (Browns), RB
Michael Pittman (Cardinals).</TE>
<TE>   Who's out: Coach Tony Dungy, CB Donnie Abraham, WR Reidel Anthony,
LB Jamie Duncan, RB Warrick Dunn, LB Jeff Gooch, WR Jacquez Green, G
Randall McDaniel, TE Dave Moore, DE Steve White.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Gruden inherits a perpetually underachieving team from
Dungy. He needs to manage his quarterback situation closely, although
an upgrade at wide receiver help Brad Johnson. The defense can be
intimidating, but proved vulverable in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Parting Shot: Gruden brings a fresh new attitude with him, and
that's good for the Buccaneers. It's also good that they move to the
NFC South, because they can easily sweep the division.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NEW ORLEANS SAINTS</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Jim Haslett, third season.</TE>
<TE>   Last season's record: 7-9, tied for third in NFC West.</TE>
<TE>   Who's in: LB Bryan Cox (Patriots), CB Ken Irvin (Bills), DT Grady
Jackson (Raiders), WR Jerome Pathon (Colts), WR Jake Reed (Vikings),
T Victor Riley (Chiefs), TE David Sloan (Lions).</TE>
<TE>   Who's out: G Tom Ackerman, QB Jeff Blake, TE Cam Cleeland, WR
Albert Connell, DT La'Roi Glover, DE Joe Johnson, G Chris Naeole, T
Marcus Price, T Willie Roaf, CB Fred Weary, RB Ricky Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Saints made several bold moves, notably the trade of
Williams to Miami. Deuce McAllister takes over full-time at running
back, but durability is a question. QB Aaron Brooks was inconsistent
last year after a remarkable run in 2000. The free-agent losses of
Johnson and Glover are a huge setback for the defense.</TE>
<TE>   Parting shot: If Brooks returns to form and McAllister stays on
the field, Saints get back to the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ATLANTA FALCONS</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Dan Reeves, sixth season with Falcons.</TE>
<TE>   Last season's record: 7-9, tied for third in NFC West.</TE>
<TE>   Who's in: RB T.J. Duckett (first-round pick), RB Warrick Dunn
(Buccaneers), WR Jeff Graham (Chargers), LB John Holecek (Chargers),
S Keith Lyle (Redskins), DE John Thierry (Packers), CB Fred Weary
(Saints).</TE>
<TE>   Who's out: S Ronnie Bradford, QB Chris Chandler, LB Henri
Crockett, CB/KR Darrien Gordon, G Bob Hallen, WR Tony Martin, DE
Chuck Wiley.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Michael Vick was handed the starting job after Chandler
was released, but it's uncertain whether he's ready for full-time
duty. Vick is gifted, but showed a penchant for running too often
last season. The running back situation should be interesting,
because Dunn and Duckett figure to share time. If handled right, it
will be a dynamic combination. The defense, pushed around last
season, should improve under new coordinator Wade Phillips.</TE>
<TE>   Parting shot: As Vick goes, so go the Falcons. He's a work in
progress, so it'll be another year or two before they start winning
again.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CAROLINA PANTHERS</TE>
<TE>   Coach: John Fox, first season.</TE>
<TE>   Last season's record: 1-15, fifth in NFC West.</TE>
<TE>   Who's in: KR Michael Bates (Redskins), DT Shane Burton (Jets), CB
Terry Cousin (Dolphins), LB Mark Fields (Rams), LB Brad Jackson
(Ravens), RB Joe Montgomery (Giants), QB Rodney Peete (Raiders), DE
Julius Peppers (first-round pick), RB Lamar Smith (Dolphins).</TE>
<TE>   Who's out: Coach George Seifert, RB Tshimanga Biakabutuka, CB Doug
Evans, WR Donald Hayes, CB Jimmy Hitchcock, RB Richard Huntley, DT
Jason Peter.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Fox inherits a woeful team, and it won't get better
overnight. QB Chris Weinke had a brutal rookie season and figures to
get marginally better, but the lack of a running game won't make it
any easier.</TE>
<TE>   Parting shot: Fox brings an electricity to the defense. Too bad he
can't throw passes.</TE>

<TE>   Who's in: LB Jamie Duncan (Buccaneers), WR Troy Edwards (trade,
Steelers), WR Terrence Wilkins (trade, Colts).</TE>
<TE>   Who's out: LB Mark Fields, LB London Fletcher, WR Az-Zahir Hakim,
T Rod Jones, DL Sean Moran, T Ryan Tucker.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Rams breezed through the regular season and conference
playoffs before running into the Patriots, whose superior game plan
paved the way to one of the biggest Super Bowl upsets ever. St. Louis
still has the talent to go a long way in the playoffs, although
defensive coordinators will almost certainly copy Bill Belichick's
strategy of making Kurt Warner throw and punishing the receivers.
Marshall Faulk is the game's most complete back, but his creaky knees
are always a concern.</TE>
<TE>   Parting shot: With San Francisco nipping at their heels and
Faulk's health an issue, Rams don't make another Super Bowl run.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Steve Mariucci, sixth season.</TE>
<TE>   Last season's record: 12-4, second in NFC West. Lost to Packers in
first-round playoff game.</TE>
<TE>   Who's in: DE Sean Moran (Rams), S Tony Parrish (Bears), G Ron
Stone (Giants).</TE>
<TE>   Who's out: TE Greg Clark, G Ray Brown, S Lance Schulters.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: With salary cap problems finally out of the way, the
49ers are deservedly optimistic about their chances. Quarterback Jeff
Garcia is one of the NFL's most productive, if unheralded, passers.
He had 32 touchdowns and only 12 interceptions last season. Running
back Garrison Hearst was last season's comeback player of the year,
and wide receiver Terrell Owens is one of the most dangerous, if
tempestuous, players in the game. The defense has improved
dramatically, but needs to take another step.</TE>
<TE>   Parting shot: With a few breaks, not to mention a win or two over
St. Louis, the 49ers can win the West.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SEATTLE SEAHAWKS</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Mike Holmgren, in his fourth season with Sea- hawks.</TE>
<TE>   Last season's record: 9-7, second in AFC West.</TE>
<TE>   Who's in: CB Doug Evans (Panthers), DL Brandon Mitchell (Patriots)
and QB Mark Rypien.</TE>
<TE>   Who's out: TE Christian Fauria, QB Brock Huard, KR Charlie Rogers,
DE Michael Sinclair, RB Ricky Watters, T Todd Weiner.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Trent Dilfer's preseason knee injury was a huge blow.
He'll be back at some point, but Matt Hasselbeck is the man for now.
Not a comfortable feeling for Seahawks fans, because Hasselbeck was a
major disappointment last season. The Seahawks need running back
Shaun Alexander, who had a breakout season in 2001, to have another
strong showing. The defense is solid, but nothing great. Another
factor is the Seahawks' move to the NFC West, where difficult games
with St. Louis and San Francisco await.</TE>
<TE>   Parting shot: If Seahawks fizzle this season, Mike Holmgren might
be out of a job.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ARIZONA CARDINALS</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Dave McGinnis, third season.</TE>
<TE>   Last season's record: 7-9, tied for third in NFC East.</TE>
<TE>   Who's in: TE Freddie Jones (Chargers), CB Duane Starks (Ravens).</TE>
<TE>   Who's out: CB Corey Chavous, CB Tom Knight, WR Rob Moore, RB
Michael Pittman.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: As usual, the Cardinals have nothing going for them. Jake
Plummer enters yet another critical season that might determine
whether he's back next season. Running back Thomas Jones was handed
the starting job after Pittman left for the Buccaneers. And the
defense continues to battle the perennial problems of lack of talent
and depth. About the only positive on this team is the offensive
line, which features mammoth guard Leonard Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Parting shot:  The Cardinals are now NFC West fodder.</TE>

<HD>Buccaneers Cut Buckley</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers waived cornerback Terrell Buckley and put
defensive end Marcus Jones on injured reserve Sunday when the team
reduced its roster to the opening day limit of 53 players.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Jon Gruden also said reserve defensive end Ron Warner was
put on a reserve list after being suspended for four games by the
NFL.</LD>
<LD>   The Buccaneers did not disclose why the second-year pro, who spent
all of last season on Tampa Bay's practice squad, was suspended.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not allowed to talk about that. It's a confidential policy,"
Gruden said. "All I can say is he's been suspended by the
commissioner for four games, and his future with the Buccaneers will
be addressed after that."</TE>
<TE>   Buckley, who has 41 interceptions in 10 seasons with Green Bay,
Miami, Denver and New England, signed a one-year contract a week
before training camp. His chances of making the team were weakened by
the development of young cornerbacks Tim Wansley and Corey Ivy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carolina Panther starting quarterback Chris Weinke could be
replaced by 14-year veteran Rodney Peete after struggling in the
exhibition season, Coach John Fox said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wide receiver Sylvester Morris, Kansas City's first-round draft
pick in 2000, was put on injured reserve and will sit out the season
for the second year in a row.</TE>
<TE>   The Chiefs also put wide receiver Marvin "Snoop" Minnis, their top
pick in 2001, on the physically unable to perform list.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kicker Ola Kimrin, who had a 65-yard field goal during Thursday
night's exhibition game against the Seattle Seahawks, was among 18
players cut by the Denver Broncos.</TE>
<TE>   Kimrin's field goal was two yards longer than the league record of
63, which is shared by the Broncos' Jason Elam and former New Orleans
Saint Tom Dempsey. Exhibition games do not count in the league record
book.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Oakland Raiders released veteran linebacker Greg Biekert and
16 other players. The Raiders had asked the 10-year pro to take a pay
cut of $1.5 million from the $2.5 million he was scheduled to make
this season, and Biekert wasn't willing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Wright, who started five games at quarterback over the
last two seasons, and kicker Tim Seder were among 18 players cut by
the Dallas Cowboys. Also cut was Woody Dantzler, who could end up on
the five-man practice squad.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Running back Robert Edwards took a big step in his comeback from a
devastating knee injury three years ago by making the Miami Dolphins'
roster.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards was one of three running backs kept by the Dolphins as
they cut 11 players to reach the regular-season limit of 53.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former UCLA running back Skip Hicks, claimed off waivers by the
Titans nearly a year ago, was released by Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The nephew of Hall of Fame linebacker Dick Butkus, who played with
the Chicago Bears, was cut by the team. Luke Butkus, a rookie
free-agent center from Illinois, was among 18 players released.</TE>

<LD>Lindsay Tarpley's unassisted golden goal in the 109th minute gave the
United States a 1-0 victory Sunday over host Canada in the inaugural
FIFA Under-19 women's world championship title match at Edmonton,
Canada.</LD>
<LD>   The game winner, in front of 47,784 at Commonwealth Stadium, was
made possible by a relentless Tarpley on a broken play at the mouth
of the Canadian goal.</LD>
<LD>   "I just know we kept trying to plug away and find different ways
to score and we finally put it in the back of the net," Tarpley said.</LD>
<TE>   Megan Kakadelas began the play with a cross pass from the left
wing to Heather O'Reilly, who directed the ball into the middle of
the penalty area to an oncoming Tarpley.</TE>
<TE>   A Canadian defender rejected Tarpley's first touch but she was
able to regain control and her shot sailed past Canadian goalkeeper
Erin McLeod and into the left side of the net.</TE>
<TE>   It was the sixth goal of the tournament for Tarpley, the U.S.
captain and North Carolina freshman, and she finished third in
tournament scoring.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S., which finished the tournament with a 6-0 record, scored
26 goals and gave up two. Both were tournament-best marks.</TE>
<TE>   In the consolation match, Germany defeated Brazil, 4-3, on penalty
kicks after a 1-1 tie.</TE>
<TE>   Lazio Fans Rampage</TE>
<TE>   Hooliganism reared its ugly head outside of Rome's Olympic Stadium
on Sunday, but not because of a loss on the field. Fans of Lazio were
upset at a loss taken by their favorite team's roster.</TE>
<TE>   Three police cars were set on fire, three rival fans were stabbed
and stadium offices were ransacked during a rampage that was fueled
by the announced transfer of the team's top stars--captain Alessandro
Nesta to AC Milan and Argentine striker Hernan Crespo to Inter Milan.</TE>
<TE>   While stadium officials estimated $200,000 worth of damage, only
one Lazio fan was arrested (on charges of pillage and devastation)
and others were under investigation for their respective parts in the
ruckus, which began outside of the stadium after the "friendly" 2-2
tie between hometown Lazio and league champion Juventus.</TE>
<TE>   Junior Sidelined</TE>
<TE>   The acquisition of Nesta made the loss of Roque Junior a tad more
palpable for AC Milan.</TE>
<TE>   Junior, a Brazilian defender who helped lead his country to the
World Cup championship in June, will be sidelined for three months
after shoulder surgery, the Italian club announced.</TE>
<TE>   Playing for AC Milan, Junior injured the shoulder in an aerial
collision against Slovan Liberac on Aug. 14 in a Champions League
qualifier. Junior was initially diagnosed and treated in Milan but,
at his request, underwent surgery in Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   A Fast Start</TE>
<TE>   While Real Madrid fans eagerly anticipate the arrival of Brazilian
striker Ronaldo, Valencia began its Spanish league title defense with
a 2-0 victory at Mallorca.</TE>
<TE>   Valencia, which won its first championship in 31 years last
season, got goals from Uruguayan midfielder Gonzalo de Los Santos and
Spanish international Ruben Baraja.</TE>
<TE>   Real Madrid, meanwhile, opens league play today against Espanyol
at Santiago Bernabeu stadium, three days after winning the European
Super Cup in Monaco over Feyenoord, 3-1.</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo is expected to be at the game, but not play, after his
$46.3-million transfer from Inter Millan.</TE>

<LD>Is anyone out there telling the truth?</LD>
<LD>   When it comes to the sale and transfer of players at the highest
levels of the game, the depressing answer to that question appears to
be a resounding, "No!"</LD>
<LD>   Just look at the whole sorry saga of Brazil's Ronaldo, the equally
deplorable case of Colombia's Faustino Asprilla, and the devious
deliberations involving Italy's Alessandro Nesta, to take but three
current examples.</LD>
<TE>   In each instance, either the players themselves, their agents or
the presidents and the management of the clubs involved, showed
repeatedly that there is a vast difference between what they say and
what they do.</TE>
<TE>   Is it any wonder, therefore, that the media is cynical and that
fans simply don't know whom to believe?</TE>
<TE>   Here's a closer look at the three cases. Unfortunately, they
feature no sex and no videotape, only lies.</TE>
<TE>   Bad Example 1: Ronaldo</TE>
<TE>   One week after scoring twice for Brazil in its World Cup final
victory over Germany, Ronaldo--he of the strange haircut, goofy teeth
and bad attitude--had this to say:</TE>
<TE>   "Real Madrid is a great team, one of the most important in the
world, but it has its players and I'm already part of a team at
Inter. For a long time now, President [Massimo] Moratti has had
confidence in me, and I am totally loyal to him."</TE>
<TE>   One month later, Ronaldo's agent, Alexandre Martins, reiterated
that the Brazilian would honor his commitment to Inter Milan even
though Martins himself was trying to negotiate a deal with Real
Madrid.</TE>
<TE>   "He is an Inter player and will remain an Inter player 365 days a
year for four years," Martins said Aug. 7. "He has a contract that he
wants to respect and, therefore, he will continue to work with
Inter."</TE>
<TE>   That statement was palpably false because talks between the clubs
continued in the background until the deal collapsed Aug. 25. At
least that's what reporters were led to believe.</TE>
<TE>   "There is now no time to restart negotiations," Jorge Valdano,
Real Madrid's sporting director, told a Spanish television
interviewer that day. "The transfer deadline expires in a week [Aug.
31] and there is no chance of concluding a deal by then.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what might happen in six months or a year, but on
this occasion the negotiations are definitively closed."</TE>
<TE>   That sounded like the last word, especially when Moratti
underlined it three days later.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as Ronaldo is concerned the situation is quite simple," he
told Italian television last Tuesday. "He is and will be part of
Inter. [He] is staying with us. The issue is already closed."</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, shortly before the midnight trade deadline, Ronaldo,
25, was sold by Inter Milan to Real Madrid for $46.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   In the future, a large grain of salt is recommended when
attempting to swallow anything said by Ronaldo, Martins, Moratti or
Valdano.</TE>
<TE>   Bad Example 2: Asprilla</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the English third division team Darlington were
justifiably excited when they learned that two-time Colombian World
Cup star Asprilla was going to join the club.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to work with the team and help it gain promotion,"
Asprilla, 32, said when introduced to fans Aug. 25.</TE>
<TE>   A few days later, Asprilla failed to turn up for his physical and
George Reynolds, the club's chairman, said the Colombian had
abandoned England for the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   "We made him a fantastic offer and I thought it was all in place,"
Reynolds told Britain's Sky Sports. "I'm absolutely devastated.</TE>
<TE>   "We're friends. I wined and dined him.... We offered him 20% of
the gate receipts, plus salary, plus a car, plus a flat [apartment]
rent-free.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll never talk to him again; he's completely sunk me."</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Asprilla apologized, but said no agreement had been
reached.</TE>
<TE>   "I traveled 20,000 miles with the intention to play for
Darlington," he told Sky Sports. "We never agreed on a deal.</TE>
<TE>   "What Darlington offered me [a reported $26,420 a week], was very
good, but it wasn't enough to live on here."</TE>
<TE>   Either the cost of living has reached stratospheric levels in
England or someone is not telling the truth.</TE>
<TE>   The latter seems more likely. Asprilla's agent, Jairo Pachon,
admitted Saturday that the striker had received another offer, from a
wealthier club in Dubai.</TE>
<TE>   Bad Example 3: Nesta</TE>
<TE>   Alessandro Nesta is widely regarded as one of the best defenders
in the world, a centerpiece of Lazio and Italy's national team.</TE>
<TE>   As such, he has been coveted by wealthier clubs in Italy and
abroad, but Sergio Cragnotti, Lazio's president, has long insisted
that he would not part with Nesta, at least not for anything less
than the world-record price for a defender of $47 million that
Manchester United paid in July for Rio Ferdinand.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Nesta would cost more than that, certainly nothing less,"
Cragnotti said July 23.</TE>
<TE>   The asking price appeared to deter prospective buyers and by Aug.
8 Cragnotti said that Nesta, 26, was no longer for sale.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no intention of getting rid of him," he told Italy's ANSA
news agency.</TE>
<TE>   But talks were in progress and only ended (apparently) Aug. 11,
when Lazio refused AC Milan's offer of $25.2 million for Nesta.</TE>
<TE>   "The negotiations are considered closed," AC Milan said then.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Lazio sold Nesta to AC Milan for $30 million, thus
making a mockery of all the previous statements.</TE>
<TE>   Added Intrigue</TE>
<TE>   The coming days could bring more intrigue and obfuscation.</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo's move to Real Madrid left Inter Milan with enough cash to
buy Argentina national team striker Hernan Crespo from Lazio for $26
million. Lazio paid a then-world record $54.1 million for Crespo only
two years ago, which leaves Cragnotti with some explaining to do.</TE>
<TE>   Lazio's fans certainly are not happy. They rioted in Rome on
Saturday after the sale of Nesta and Crespo.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Real Madrid striker Fernando Morientes was supposed to
be involved in the Ronaldo deal, moving to Inter Milan as part of the
Ronaldo purchase price and then being sold to Barcelona. But that
fell through.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Morientes is rumored to be heading for Tottenham Hotspur in
England. Or perhaps to Manchester United, which also wants another
striker.</TE>
<TE>   It sounds believable. Or at least as much as anything in soccer is
believable these days.</TE>

<LD>The mobility of Colorado State quarterback Bradlee Van Pelt will pose
an early test for the UCLA defense Saturday, especially for middle
linebacker Marcus Reese and free safety Matt Ware.</LD>
<LD>   Both Bruins are experienced, but primarily at other positions.
Reese played mostly weakside linebacker as a frequently used reserve,
and Ware was a freshman All-American cornerback.</LD>
<LD>   Furthermore, Reese's availability is in doubt because he has a
concussion. Veteran reserve Dennis Link and freshman Justin London
will fill in if Reese can't play.</LD>
<TE>   Whoever is in the middle will have to tackle bruising Ram tailback
Cecil Sapp in addition to helping contain Van Pelt. Sapp rushed for
80 yards in Colorado State's upset of No. 7 Colorado and 178 in a
season-opening victory over Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   Van Pelt, a senior from Santa Barbara San Marcos High, ran for the
winning score against Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Snow, UCLA's defensive coordinator, plans to use a nickel
package more often than last season, when he usually left linebackers
Robert Thomas, Brandon Chillar and Ryan Nece in the game on passing
downs.</TE>
<TE>   But a lack of depth at linebacker, combined with the development
of reserve defensive backs Matt Clark and Jibril Raymo, has made him
reconsider.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA did not practice over the weekend to help players recover
from the minor bumps and bruises of training camp. They had meetings
Saturday morning and took Sunday off.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins, who do not begin fall classes until Sept. 23, practice
today at 3:45 p.m. All practices are closed to the public, a policy
Coach Bob Toledo implemented last season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Several Bruins are on the preseason watch lists for major awards.</TE>
<TE>   Ware and Ricky Manning Jr. are on the watch list for the Jim
Thorpe Award, annually given to the nation's best defensive back.</TE>
<TE>   Defensive tackle Rodney Leisle and offensive tackle Mike Saffer
are on the watch list for the Outland Trophy, given to the nation's
top lineman.</TE>

<LD>   Tonight, 5</LD>
<LD>   TV--Channel 7.</LD>
<TE>   Radio--KMPC (1540).</TE>
<TE>   WHEN USC HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Carson Palmer is at the controls of a spread offense
and will throw often to running back Malaefou MacKenzie and receivers
Kareem Kelly and Keary Colbert. Tailback Sultan McCullough, who
suffered an abdominal injury last season, rushed for 1,163 yards two
years ago and is a breakaway threat. Auburn has plenty of speed on
defense. Tackle DeMarco McNeil anchors the line and Karlos Dansby and
Dontarrious Thomas are outstanding linebackers.</TE>
<TE>   WHEN AUBURN HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore Carnell Williams is regarded as one of the top young
running backs in the nation. Last year, he set a school record by
carrying 41 times against Georgia. Sixth-year senior Daniel Cobb will
start at quarterback with sophomore Jason Campbell ready to step in.
USC sophomore end Kenechi Udeze and sophomore tackle Shaun Cody lead
a young but experienced defensive line. Darrell Rideaux and Ronald
Nunn are untested at cornerback. Safety Troy Polamalu anchors the
secondary.</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO USC VICTORY</TE>
<TE>   1. Trojans must establish running game: USC averaged 87.7 yards a
game in 2001. The line needs to open holes that will subsequently
open the passing game.</TE>
<TE>   2. Contain Auburn running back: Carnell Williams averaged 5.1
yards a carry in 2001 and is primed for a big year.</TE>
<TE>   3. USC's corners must prove they are not liabilities: Darrell
Rideaux and Ronald Nunn are likely targets for Auburn offensive
coordinator Bobby Petrino.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Derek Graf persevered through four injury-plagued years, hoping to
start one day on the offensive line for USC.</LD>
<LD>   Graf, a fifth-year senior who is the son of former Trojan guard
Allan Graf, might get an opportunity tonight if freshman Fred Matua
is held out because of a bruised right knee.</LD>
<LD>   Graf worked throughout training camp as a backup to center Norm
Katnik but practiced with the first-unit offense at guard after Matua
was injured Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   If Matua starts, he would be the first true freshman to start an
opener on USC's offensive line since Travis Claridge in 1996. USC
Coach Pete Carroll said Matua's status for Auburn would be a
game-time decision.</TE>
<TE>   Graf said he would be prepared if called upon.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't matter where you play on the offensive line, you have
to be ready to step up when you're needed and wherever you're
needed," Graf said.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope Freddie is OK. But if they need me, believe me, I'm
ready."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A crowd of about 70,000, including nearly 10,000 Auburn
supporters, is expected at the Coliseum for tonight's game.</TE>
<TE>   Four Navy F-18 jets will fly over the stadium at the conclusion of
the national anthem. One of the pilots will be Marc Preston, a punter
for the Trojans in 1988 and 1989.</TE>
<TE>   There also will be a fireworks show after the game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's game is USC's first against a Southeastern Conference
opponent since Auburn defeated the Trojans, 16-7, in the 1987 Citrus
Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   USC is 13-10-1 against SEC schools but is 0-5-1 in its last six
games against that conference's teams. The Trojans' last victory over
an SEC team came Sept. 12, 1981, when they defeated Tennessee, 43-7,
at the Coliseum in USC's season opener.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC players are wearing football-shaped stickers on their helmets
emblazoned with GOUX, in honor of legendary Trojan assistant Marv
Goux, who died in July of cancer.</TE>

<HD>A Ton of Bricks</HD>
<DH>Williams is cornerstone at St. John Bosco</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Imagine a brick hitting you at nearly 20 mph.</LD>
<LD>   Imagine that brick weighing 205 pounds.</LD>
<LD>   Derrick Williams, the muscular running back at Bellflower St. John
Bosco High, is that brick. And he can run away from defenders as
easily as run over them.</LD>
<TE>   But Williams doesn't mind running over them.</TE>
<TE>   He is a shade under 6 feet, and ran the 40-yard dash in 4.5
seconds at the Nike camps over the summer.</TE>
<TE>   "Those aren't made-up times by a high school coach," said Kiki
Mendoza, who is Williams' coach at St. John Bosco. "He's got power,
but when the moment calls for it, he is very elusive too. He can
shake anybody out there."</TE>
<TE>   He is not only the cornerstone of St. John Bosco's team, but also
its program, a star player with a 3.4 grade-point average and a
blue-collar work ethic. As a freshman, Williams was selected by
Mendoza as the focal point of the program, from student to athlete to
good citizen.</TE>
<TE>   "I take that as a challenge to inspire other players and to be
more of a leader," Williams said. "My teammates understand. They know
I don't act all big-headed like I'm bigger than them. Some of them
looked up to me, and I was surprised because I was so young, but I
wanted to step up and be more of a leader to the team."</TE>
<TE>   As foundations go, Williams is rock solid.</TE>
<TE>   "We built an entire football program around him, and I'm not
embarrassed to say that," Mendoza said. "We had heard a lot about
him. We were running the option at the time and thought he was going
to be our quarterback, but we had some injuries, and we went to the
principal and told him we wanted to bring a freshman up to varsity,
that he's physical enough, strong enough, tough enough, the whole
bit."</TE>
<TE>   Principal Bill Goodman was unsure and wanted to wait to ensure
that Williams could handle it in the classroom. When a progress
report came back, Williams had a 3.5 GPA. He performed well in
limited play in three nonleague games, and then started three Serra
League games. Mendoza said Williams rushed for 147 yards against
Santa Margarita, 135 against Anaheim Servite and 102 against Santa
Ana Mater Dei.</TE>
<TE>   Williams gave up basketball and concentrated on football and
baseball--he is also an outstanding center fielder and hopes to spend
his summers in the minor leagues while in college--but he had hernia
surgery before his sophomore season. After recovering, he sat out
more of the season because of a sprained ankle.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, in a different situation and if he hadn't gotten hurt his
sophomore year, Derrick would be the most talked-about player out
there," Mendoza said. "People don't give him the respect he deserves.
He doesn't have Hershel Dennis [the graduated running back at Long
Beach Poly] numbers, but he's on a team that hasn't been as good as
the Polys and Los Alamitoses of the world, so his numbers aren't as
inflated.</TE>
<TE>   "Did I tell you that he benched 380 pounds in our last test day?"</TE>
<TE>   Last season, Williams rushed 110 times for 765 yards and 10
touchdowns despite sharing the carries with Terrence King, who rushed
55 times for 430 yards and five touchdowns, and Albert Butler, who
rushed 69 times for 485 yards and three touchdowns. All averaged more
than seven yards per carry and all return this season.</TE>
<TE>   Largely comprised of juniors a year ago, St. John Bosco (6-5)
finished over .500 for the first time since 1996--the last season it
won a playoff game--and qualified for the playoffs for the first time
since 1997. The Braves lost to Division I finalist Huntington Beach
Edison in the first round, 56-34.</TE>
<TE>   For Williams, it was good to play a full season without injury.
Now, colleges such as UCLA, USC, Colorado and Arizona are knocking at
his door. Some are interested in him as a cornerback, but most want
him to run with the ball. Last season, for the first time, he played
offense and defense.</TE>
<TE>   "As a runner, I think I bring a combination of speed and power,"
Williams said. "Not only can I run away from you, I can run over you
too. I like to mix it up."</TE>

<LD>Consider it the constant reader's equivalent of the Thomas Guide.
Just as few could wade through those hundred pages of ice
cream-colored maps and emerge functionally L.A. literate, no one will
be able to read "Writing Los Angeles: A Literary Anthology" from
cover to cover in one, or even a dozen, sittings. And the reason is
the same: Los Angeles occupies too large and complicated a space, on
both the geographic and the cultural landscapes, to be understood
quickly, or possibly ever.</LD>
<LD>   In a way, this city defies anthology. Even as editor David L. Ulin
diligently sifted through something like 10,000 pages of various
manuscripts before selecting close to 900, L.A. refused to serve up
any sort of overall "urban narrative"--that oblique term so beloved
of book reviewers and conference participants. Yes, there were
themes--boosterism and bashing, exile and discovery, the 40 shades of
light, the destructive natural forces, the dislocating size of the
city--but no cohesive tale of how the city came to be and what it
means ever emerged.</LD>
<LD>   Ulin wasn't surprised. For him, and for many of those who actively
ponder the meaning of this city, the space where the narrative thread
should be is the narrative thread.</LD>
<TE>   "You have to let go of certain preconceived notions of order. It's
a paradox--the disorder is the order," says Ulin. "L.A. literature is
an anti-canon canon. There will probably never be the Great L.A.
novel, because there is no central narrative. L.A. writers don't
identify themselves as L.A. writers. And that's a good thing, a
liberating thing. It gives writers, and everyone, a freedom that you
don't see in other cities."</TE>
<TE>   Ulin is quite familiar with L.A. writers. Aside from being one
himself--he has contributed to this newspaper among other
publications--and teaching the craft at local colleges, he has spent
much of the past four years attempting to chart and then illuminate
his vision of this city's literary innards.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, he published a collection of contemporary local writers
called "Another City: Writing From Los Angeles" (City Light Books).
So it wasn't surprising that the folks at Library of America turned
to him for the L.A. version of collections that thus far include New
York, baseball and sea writing.</TE>
<TE>   For nine months, he and a team of editors and researchers pored
over novels and nonfiction works, thumbed through old copies of Life
and Look and the American Mercury magazine. They talked to writers
and teachers and readers of all sorts and finally came up with works
from 78 authors.</TE>
<TE>   "My mantra during the whole process was a line from Joan Didion,
which, of course, I am now going to quote incorrectly," says Ulin.
"For a while, the lack of narrative here bothered her. And then one
day she was driving somewhere when she realized that narrative is
sentimental."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the contributors to this non-sentimental endeavor are
Angelenos, but many are not even American. The table of contents
reveals many "usual suspects" -- Helen Hunt Jackson, Aldous Huxley,
James M. Cain, Raymond Chandler, Nathanael West, Didion, Charles
Bukowski, Carolyn See, Mike Davis--but others are a surprise. H.L.
Mencken is there and Edmund Wilson, Tennessee Williams, Simone de
Beauvoir, Umberto Eco, Jan Morris, John McPhee and a host of
contemporary writers including Sandra Tsing Loh and Ruben Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   The overriding theme of L.A. writing, Ulin says, is chaos. But in
a good way. And the book reflects this. There is no one, or two, or
17 ways to describe the kinds of pieces Ulin chose. They are ordered
chronologically, which reveals some interesting trends. Toward the
middle, a Chandler story is followed by an excerpt from John Fante's
"Ask the Dust," and another from West's "The Day of the Locust,"
which, in turn, is followed by a story by E. Scott Fitzgerald. The
years 1938-40, Ulin says, produced some of the most iconic L.A.
fiction.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the anthology's pieces are fiction, some are non, and some
hover above the line between. There are pointed political and
cultural analyses, poetic diatribes and footnoted histories. There
are also (and these may alone be worth the $40 cover price) wonderful
journal excerpts from the likes of David Hockney, Christopher
Isherwood and De Beauvoir, all describing an outsider's budding
relationship with a city that, at first, makes no sense at all.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood makes its presence known, in story and excerpt, but not
too much and that is intentional. Ulin doesn't find the "Hollywood
Novel" particularly useful. "It served for too long as too much of a
filter," he says, "and a way to just write off L.A."</TE>
<TE>   What he wanted to do is include as many parallel narratives as he
could in the hopes that the final product would reflect the city that
he sees around him. "I wanted to paint a portrait of the city using
words," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A noble goal, and not at all as easy as it sounds. When writing
about Los Angeles, it is easy to go to extremes. To rhapsodize or
vilify, with bougainvillea-tinged prose or the snarky wit of a
squinting East Coaster. It's easy because in Los Angeles there are
many extremes--there is the desert, there is the sea, there are
mountains, and a sky huge and changeable.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood cannot be ignored and then there's oil money and real
estate and car culture, religious extremism and conservatism of every
kind, a border as porous as pumice and more foreign-born citizens
from more countries than in any other city in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Despite all that, the lives most people lead here are less about
Los Angeles and more about the ordinary events of living. The fiction
and nonfiction that reflects this is, in Ulin's opinion, more genuine
"L.A. writing" than some fevered attempt to capture the city in all
its grit and glory.</TE>
<TE>   "I think most people's focus is much narrower than that," he said.
"The real literature is individual stories about individual
lives--how do you get through the day? I don't' think about it as
necessarily writing about L.A. It's about capturing the ordinariness
of living here. That within this landscape something else, something
specific, is unfolding."</TE>
<TE>   Ulin is sitting in a sleek-chic Thai restaurant on a stretch of
Pico Boulevard not particularly known for sleek-chic restaurants. For
several blocks east and west, many of the signs are in Hebrew; across
the street is an establishment called the Nut House and a discount
emporium. The restaurant is right around the corner from his house.
When his mother, who lives on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and is
not a huge fan of L.A., first visited him and his wife here, she took
one look around and said, "You've moved to Brooklyn in the '40s."</TE>
<TE>   Ulin has walked here through the white August glare, and as he
enters the restaurant, he begins scribbling something on a memo pad,
a transition he has been grappling for while writing his next book,
which will be about earthquakes. A native New Yorker, he has lived in
L.A. for 11 years. Although this is a long time in L.A. years, Ulin
says he still considers himself an outsider, will probably always
consider himself an outsider. "But I'm a lifer," he adds.</TE>
<TE>   The outsider perspective is very important to the literary life of
Los Angeles. For years, almost a hundred of them in fact, Los Angeles
has allowed writers from other places to explain the city to the
world. You can see this in the collection--how many of the pieces
seem revelatory, as if the city were being seen for the first time.
But this, Ulin says, is changing and you can see that too--the
contemporary authors are almost all natives, or lifers, exploring
what lies beneath the skin of more sightseeing accounts.</TE>
<TE>   "We are moving from a literature of exile to a literature of
place," he says. "We are no longer dependent on outsiders to tell us
who we are. More people who have grown up here are writing about
that. And people who came here from other places no longer lament
what they left behind. It is less of a frontier."</TE>
<TE>   He was struck, however, by how many of the "outsider" accounts
followed a progression toward fondness. So many begin with the
acknowledgment that the city is ugly or unknowable or insane but by
the end, opinions are invariably revised, softened. L.A. as ultimate
seductress.</TE>
<TE>   Those who live here, however, seem less concerned with pinning
down the nature of their city. And that can only be a good thing.
"Los Angeles," says Ulin, "doesn't obsess about itself."</TE>
