<LD>AT THE SKY'S EDGE</LD>
<LD>   Poems 1991-1996</LD>
<LD>   By Bei Dao</LD>
<TE>   Translated from the Chinese</TE>
<TE>   by David Hinton</TE>
<TE>   New Directions: 224 pp., $15.95</TE>
<TE>   I reviewed Bei Dao's collection of poems "Old Snow" upon its
publication in 1991--when the shock waves of Tiananmen Square still
reverberated in the West, accompanied by unforgettable images of the
young student protestors. Bei Dao, who'd been a leader of the
underground protest movement, a radical journalist and poet in his
native country, happened to have been outside of China when
government tanks crushed the rebellion.</TE>
<TE>   In exile, he was made an instant international martyr, and his
poetry was translated into 25 languages. I remember trying to read
the poems in "Old Snow" dispassionately and succeeding, at least to
this degree: I recognized a genius "beyond" the topical. A powerful
sense of his Whitman-like rhetorical immensity coupled with a
passionately eccentric sensibility won out: I felt certain that his
poems would last as poems, as distinguished by their literary
substance and style rather than their historical relevance.</TE>
<TE>   After reading "At the Sky's Edge," his second retrospective volume
(with a superb, thought-provoking foreword by Michael Palmer), I feel
happily reconfirmed in my earlier judgment. These poems of the early
'90s rely on a hyperactive surrealism uniquely his ("huge breasts on
a waitress/strawberry ice cream"), growing wiser in "Advertising":</TE>
<TE>   A dictator freshly-elected by the newspapers</TE>
<TE>   waves warm greetings ...</TE>
<TE>   ... now's the time a flower shop opens</TE>
<TE>   or in a more reflective vein in "The Next Tree":</TE>
<TE>   where is it wind comes from</TE>
<TE>   we count days and nights passing</TE>
<TE>   inside poppy seeds....</TE>
<TE>   come, you barbarians</TE>
<TE>   please join this legend ...</TE>
<TE>   becoming a tiger in a foreign land.</TE>

<TE>   TWICE REMOVED</TE>
<TE>   Poems</TE>
<TE>   By Ralph Angel</TE>
<TE>   Sarabande Books: 74 pp., $20.95</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Angel's poems are deceptively quiet, deceptively calm.
Beneath their carefully constructed surfaces, they are wild, even
intimidating. The power of restraint in poetry cannot be
overestimated. The cliche of Emily Dickinson's little white dress (on
display at her house in Amherst) beneath which beat the heart of an
anarchist-visionary ("My life had stood, a loaded gun") should stand
as provocative reminder of both the hidden and overt volatilities of
language. Angel usually relies on the force of the implicative, but
when he lets loose, as in "Half Circle," the reader knows it:</TE>
<TE>   A rock's thrown</TE>
<TE>   through the window.</TE>
<TE>   A man's beaten in the hall.</TE>
<TE>   The same young woman, night to night,</TE>
<TE>   sleeps against your door.</TE>
<TE>   These poems burn from within. Listen to the lyrical authority of
the following lines: "To give birth to ourselves each day makes this
death/an act of will, and stopping here to say goodbye is all too
sadly/telling."</TE>
<TE>   The word "telling" on a line by itself is pure Angel: It sends up
the idea of "telling," isolating the narrative impulse, orphaning it,
while still allowing it to chime in off-rhyme with "will." This is a
brilliant sight gag about poetry. Knowledgeable, musical, parodic,
cockily singing to the all-powerful Invisible. If this is an Angel,
it's Lucifer, the one who got away.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE LOVE-TALKERS</TE>
<TE>   An Erotic Fable</TE>
<TE>   By Gail Wronsky</TE>
<TE>   Hollyridge Press: 140 pp., $23.95</TE>
<TE>   One has to have stockpiled a freezerful of sang-froid to title a
book "The Love-Talkers"--chilling out evocations both of soft-core
porn and sex therapy guides. These dream pieces are so naively and
quixotically amorous that they operate like little peep-shows of the
author's imagination (both fleshly and spiritual)--in prose so
unabashedly "purple" that the reader risks contracting violet
fingertips from turning pages.</TE>
<TE>   Gail Wronsky, an acclaimed poet, has somehow given birth to a
completely new form here: half prose, half poetry, a drifting hybrid
of myth and priapic fantasy, it could be called a roman de lala.</TE>
<TE>   "In Mexico City, it rained. It rained on the cobblestone pavement
of Coyacan. It rained on the Churrabusco. It rained on Frida Kahlo's
houses--the blue one in Coyoacan and the strange studio Rivera had
built for her ... in San Angel."</TE>
<TE>   "Around a corner, they entered a corridor of serpents' heads, just
eye-level. 'Quetzalcoatl,' said Felix, 'the wind.'"</TE>
<TE>   "'Let's have a baby,' said Lara, suddenly.... They were deep in
the tunnels under the covered Olmec pyramid in Cholula--the one
Cortes had thought ... was a hill."</TE>
<TE>   Wronsky climbs every mountain--and every pyramid, hill and fleshy
bump. The girl can't help it.</TE>

<HD>Return to the Scene of a Crime</HD>
<DH>RED WATER: A Novel, By Judith Freeman, Pantheon Books: 336
pp., $24</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET FITCH</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It must be every bride's nightmare--going home to meet your new
husband's seven other wives. But in Judith Freeman's fourth novel,
"Red Water," set in the Mormon West of the 1850s and '60s, it's only
to be expected. Emma Batchelor, English emigre and convert, marries
the charismatic John D. Lee, a real-life leader in the early church,
and moves to a remote settlement in the red lands of the Great Basin
in this tale of the sweat- and blood-soaked West.</LD>
<LD>   Moving fluidly backward and forward in time, the novel opens in an
especially solemn and graceful piece of writing with Lee's execution
by firing squad for a crime that is never directly addressed. His
mysterious crime hangs over the rising action like the threat of a
winter storm.</LD>
<LD>   The rest of the novel is divided into three sections, each
narrated by one of Lee's wives, all historic personages who left
diaries and writings for Freeman to mine: Emma, whose marriage taps
deep reserves of strength, resourcefulness and faith; child bride
Ann, who prefers mountains and animals to the charms of domestic
life; and Rachel, a bitter, self-righteous woman who delivers the
harshest portion of the novel.</LD>
<TE>   "Red Water" gives us a fascinating view of plural marriage on the
frontier, where "for better or for worse" certainly provided both
extremes. As well, it provides a fascinating look into Mormonism's
unique beliefs and practices and a thumbnail history of the church's
early days, embodied in the man, Lee. Called "Father" by his wives,
he personifies the red lands that are the backdrop to the novel.
Oversized and dangerously unpredictable, he is capable in leadership,
swathed in charm, steeped in avarice, bubbling with sexuality,
stalwart in faith and violent to his fingertips.</TE>
<TE>   The first clue to the mystery of Lee's crimes comes when,
wondering at the size of Father's herds, new bride Emma is told he
acquired the animals after the "Indian Depredation," in which a wagon
train from Arkansas was brutally attacked by Indians at a place
called Mountain Meadow. Luckily, Father and other Saints (members of
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Mormonism's name for
itself) saved some of the children and industriously collected the
animals that escaped the slaughter. However, she is warned not to
inquire further.</TE>
<TE>   Gradually, the more sinister involvement of the Saints is
revealed: The Indians weren't all Indians, many were Mormon men. And
when, after three days of siege, the Arkansans were persuaded by the
Saints to surrender in exchange for safe escort out of Mormon
territory, they were slaughtered, shot or clubbed to death by their
"saviors," who helped themselves to the spoils.</TE>
<TE>   "Red Water" is a brave book for Freeman, who was raised a Mormon,
as the church hierarchy has long denied responsibility for this
chapter in its history. To her credit, Freeman never divorces the
violence of that event from the violence and persecution against
Mormons in the church's early days or from the intrinsic violence of
life on the land, with its brutal climate and inhuman demands on its
settlers. She helps us understand the mind-set of a besieged nation
and the more subtle politics of a theocratic society.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the power of the book is muted somewhat by its split focus:
the human story of the frontier polygamous family versus the moral
story, the blood guilt of the Mountain Meadows massacre.</TE>
<TE>   The story of the massacre's aftermath disrupts the rich unfolding
action of the intra-familial drama. An eyewitness report among the
voices narrating the book could have knit it more closely into the
family story. Then Emma's dilemma--whether she can still love Lee and
her church in the face of growing knowledge of his murderousness and
its complicity--would have been heightened and the two story lines
better integrated. (Although Ann in the third section is revealed to
have had certain firsthand knowledge of the event, it arrives too
late in the tale to heighten the drama of Emma's decision.)</TE>
<TE>   The drama of the polygamous family, with its rich fabric of
sexuality, faith, filial loyalty, rivalries and alliances, is by far
the more engaging story line. Unfortunately, Ann's section bleeds off
much of the tension built up for the family saga, as it takes place
after the dissolution of the family and concerns a hunt for a stolen
horse. It seems a slice out of a different book, perhaps one written
by Cormac McCarthy.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, it does give the reader a bit of a breather
before the book takes its final desperate plunge, as the widowed
Rachel struggles to make a living from the land for herself and her
dependents in the face of increasing pressure from the church and
encroaching Navajo.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever its flaws, "Red Water" delivers an unforgettable portrait
of the unceasing labor, passion and danger of frontier life,
recalling the best of Willa Cather. Freeman makes vivid the ferocity
of purpose it took to wrest a living from a wild red land and makes
inevitable the intensity of life among people who try. In particular,
her evocation of the Great Basin, its harsh landscape of red rock and
twisted cypress and winters that come like an apocalypse, forms the
perfect stage for this drama of love and faith and greed at the edge
of wilderness.</TE>

<HD>Cornering the Market in Chutzpah</HD>
<DH>PUBLIC INTELLECTUALS: A Study of Decline, By Richard A.
Posner, Harvard University Press:  408 pp., $29.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RUSSELL JACOBY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Did you know that if I were writing this review for big bucks, it
would be better--at least according to Richard Posner? Posner adores
the free market; his only regret is that salaried teachers like
myself escape its beneficial imperatives. Posner is a judge on the
U.S. Court of Appeals; he is a well-regarded professor at the
University of Chicago Law School and an author who writes with
astounding energy on an astounding number of topics. He has published
books--just to stick to the A's--on aging, AIDS and antitrust law.
Recently he has tackled former President Bill Clinton's impeachment
and the 2000 Florida election debacle. Associated with a movement
that applies economics to law, Posner belongs in the front ranks of
legal thinkers in the United States today--and perhaps the qualifier
"legal" suggests a specialization he has increasingly abandoned.</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, in his latest book he assumes the role of wide-ranging
social critic. Posner was "surprised" by the "low quality" of public
commentary on the Clinton impeachment by philosophers, historians and
law professors. The discussion was no better on the Microsoft
antitrust case, in which he served as mediator. This spurred him to
consider the nature of "public intellectuals," which, he claims, "has
never been studied systematically before." With his usual industry
and boldness, Posner seeks to remedy this deficiency and explain the
sorry state of public intellectuals.</TE>
<TE>   What is a public intellectual? (Disclosure alert: Posner credits
me, in my "The Last Intellectuals," with coining the term, and I
marginally figure in his book.) Standard accounts trace the term
"intellectual" to 1890s France, when writers such as Emile Zola
protested the framing of Alfred Dreyfus; they were "the
intellectuals." In the course of the 20th century, especially in the
United States, intellectuals migrated into expanding universities and
became specialists and teachers; they were still intellectuals, but
they addressed themselves to colleagues and students. Only a few of
them, the "public intellectuals," continue to court a wider educated
audience on political and cultural matters.</TE>
<TE>   To Posner, the Dreyfus case was almost the last time intellectuals
got things right. He knows why. Once upon a time intellectuals plied
their trade in a market that adjudicated by ignoring defective goods
and rewarding quality. Intellectuals were essentially independent
producers with something to sell--their words. Inasmuch as public
intellectuals are now largely tenured professors, they escape the
dictates of the market; they can write (and talk) trash in public and
still pick up their checks from the bursar.</TE>
<TE>   Posner seeks to substantiate this proposition by case studies
illustrating the defective quality of contributions of public
intellectuals and by a series of tables, graphs and equations
demonstrating an inverse relation between public attention and real
scholarship. Pos- ner (or his assistants) have counted up the number
of media "hits" and scholarly citations for more than 500
intellectuals to show that intellectuals pay for public attention by
diminished professional legitimacy. In the service of this argument,
he has collected a dizzying amount of miscellaneous data. Wannabe
public intellectuals can pick up career tips. To gain media
attention, "other things being equal" it is better to be alive than
dead. Take note, students: Being dead can reduce your media attention
by a whopping 30%.</TE>
<TE>   To follow Posner as he picks fights with everyone from Stephen Jay
Gould to Gertrude Himmelfarb and Richard Rorty is worth the price of
admission; he is a formidable critic of academic pretense and sloth.
Yet too much of this book is pure bravado. Posner wants to prove that
not only can he draw upon technical articles on "restaurant pricing"
and supply bristling formulas on the benefits of market regulation
and the costs of divorce, he can also discuss Shakespeare, Dickens or
T.S. Eliot with the best of them--and best them. Irving Kristol
opined that the later poetry of Eliot, such as "Four Quartets," is
"much superior" to his earlier work. This judgment, Posner sniffs,
"raises a question whether Kristol is a serious reader of modern
poetry."</TE>
<TE>   Nor is Posner above playing both sides. He makes much of the
erroneous predictions and hyperventilated idiom of public
intellectuals, complaining, for instance, that the rhetoric about the
Clinton impeachment by Princeton University historian Sean Wilentz
was typically hysterical and uninformed. (Posner legalistically
thinks the impeachment crisis was about the obstruction of justice by
Clinton.) Yet Posner himself (in Harper's magazine) defended the
Supreme Court's decision in the Florida election on the grounds it
resolved a "dangerous" crisis. "Instability" threatened the republic.
This sounds like the rhetoric Posner detests in others.</TE>
<TE>   Sticking with Posner is sometimes exhilarating, but don't look out
the window. His book is a house of cards constructed in midair.
Though Posner laments a declining quality of public intellectual
work, he provides no base line for his judgment. Apart from frequent
references to George Orwell, he does not even make a stab at
indicating when it was higher. Of course, as a partisan of
"measurement and objective evaluation," Posner must be stumped by the
impossible task of statistically proving that intellectuals once saw
further and thought better. When? He cannot say.</TE>
<TE>   Posner is a smart man bewitched by two ideas, specialization and
the free market. Together, he believes, they can clean up
intellectual pollution. For Posner intellectual specialization is
next to godliness. It would be nice if he ducked into an academic
department to check out what its excellent specialists are up to. On
occasion he gets a glimpse and recoils. He takes up Wayne Booth and
Martha Nussbaum as two public intellectuals delivering imperfect
wares. Yet by their lucidity and range, he notes, they are "not in
the mainstream of contemporary literary studies" which is generally
composed of opaque and unappetizing fields like subaltern studies and
deconstruction that "largely disable the practitioners ... from
communicating outside their immediate circle." Posner, who prides
himself on his rigor, fails to draw the conclusion. He does not
recognize here his own ideal, insular specialists who have lost touch
with English.</TE>
<TE>   The second idea is the rationality of the free market for
resolving intellectual debate. Posner thinks the market is not too
strong but too weak, exacting no financial penalties from tenured
public intellectuals who depart from their accredited fields to
deliver substandard goods. In the name of the free market, he outdoes
Marx, who believed that intellectuals were lackeys of the
bourgeoisie; Posner wishes it were so. Not the economic noose but its
slackness bothers Posner. But does he really believe that the market
can winnow out imperfect ideas and writings? "The Protocols of the
Elders of Zion," a famous anti-Semitic text, is considered one of the
bestsellers of all time. Thoreau once remarked that he had a thousand
volumes in his library, mostly unsold copies of his own books. Are
these examples of market rationality?</TE>
<TE>   Does Posner believe that the free market can resolve a public
controversy about, say, impeachment, war or intelligence testing?
Apparently he does. Or does he? Consider his discussion of Gould's
"The Mismeasure of Man," a book that contests the racial and genetic
basis of intelligence. Posner won't buy it, but many have. Gould is a
best-selling Harvard professor published by a commercial press. The
market has spoken. Posner should be pleased, but he isn't. He returns
to his first idea. In writing about intelligence, Gould has stepped
outside his expertise. Posner admits this is not obvious. "Since
Gould is a biologist, he may seem to have been writing within his
field. The appearance is deceptive. He is a paleontologist and not an
expert on the problem of intelligence." Moreover, Gould's belief that
distilling intelligence into a number like IQ exemplifies a
"reification" is nonsensical. Posner knows why; Gould is straying
again. "'Reification' is a philosophical rather than a scientific
concept ... so we should not expect Gould to be able to handle it
deftly."</TE>
<TE>   Posner might be vulnerable to an antitrust action: cornering the
market in chutzpah. Gould cannot understand IQ or philosophy (outside
his field). Nussbaum cannot understand women in Africa (outside her
field). Several hundred law professors protested the Clinton
impeachment, but they were out to lunch, since "few were experts on
impeachment." In an open letter, 50 Nobel science laureates objected
to the proposed national antimissile defense. Guess what? Appearances
again mislead. Half the signatories were either biologists or
chemists, and many others were "in branches of physics unrelated to
the science involved in trying to shoot down missiles."</TE>
<TE>   Who decides when Gould transgresses? When professors of
solid-state physics mistakenly address physics of motion? When
professors of torts erroneously take up constitutional law? Herein
the last card: Judge Posner judges. Posner decides who has the proper
credentials. Want to discuss T.S. Eliot's poetry in public? Judge
Posner will inspect your license in his chambers.</TE>
<TE>   But what exactly are Posner's credentials that allow him to airily
decide which physics professors are allowed to speak on military
defense and which philosophy professors on Africa? He has opinions on
everything but seems to lack, well, professional training on all
things. He wants everyone to stay within his or her own field, while
he lords over the estate. If the babble of public intellectuals
irritates him, perhaps he should practice what he preaches and clam
up. If he insists on adding to the din, his beloved market should
shock him with sales figures. Don't buy this book. If you must
examine this maddening and provocative work, peruse it in a store or
borrow it from a library. Posner may get the message: His cure for
intellectual irresponsibility is worse than the disease.</TE>

<LD>   There is something quaint about epistolary novels in the age of
e-mail. The "killer app" has not only shrunk our sense of time but
also atrophied the muscle that allows us to write or read the
1,000-word artifacts formerly known as letters. And yet Israeli
author David Grossman's "Be My Knife" may be the strangest saddest
love story ever told.</LD>
<LD>   Like many love stories, this one begins on a playground. At a
school reunion, Yair sees Miriam at a distance, a tall dark-haired
woman with a face from the '50s, standing next to her powerful
husband, Amos, who is entertaining the crowd. In the midst of the
hilarity, Miriam hugs herself, retreating into a private place. That
simple motion, seen only by Yair, leads to his first letter. "Don't
worry," he writes, "I don't want to meet you in person or interfere
with your day-to-day life in any way, but I would like you to agree
to receive my letters ... if you are the woman I saw, hugging herself
with a slightly crooked smile, I think you'll understand."</LD>
<TE>   Miriam understands. In return, she receives hundreds of pages of
letters from Yair, and except for the occasional quotation from her
replies, we see only his correspondence. "I need a real partner for
an imaginary journey," he writes to her, inviting her on a voyage of
the mind. True to this vow, over nine months, the two meet strictly
through the confessional of the letter, "like two people who inject
themselves with truth serum and at long last have to tell it, the
truth. I want to be able to say to myself, 'I bled truth with her,'
yes, that's what I want. Be a knife for me, and I, I swear, will be a
knife for you: sharp but compassionate."</TE>
<TE>   Bleed truth Yair does, and the sight is not a pretty one. Veteran
of a dozen adulteries, Yair refuses to meet Miriam, not only to avoid
the pitfalls of sex but also out of discomfort with a body that is
out of proportion to his soul, "some kind of hybrid between a sulky
marabou and a Jew." He is a former 8-year-old who tried to commit
suicide by buckling his father's belt tightly around his heart. He is
"a devoted family man" who nevertheless writes two, three, sometimes
five letters to Miriam in a day, writing at his kitchen table,
writing in his car as he sits outside Miriam's house one night,
smoking furiously until the passion moves him to run seven times
around her sleeping bungalow like Joshua around Jericho. Miriam is
not an uncomplicated woman--schoolteacher, wife to an understanding
husband, mother to a 10-year-old boy who suffers from an illness that
has deprived him of speech and left him with fits and rage. And yet,
she is a woman of uncommon imagination. In one of the letters that
Yair quotes back to her, she recalls: "You wanted to wake up without
your memory, after an accident, or an operation, and start
remembering our story, step by step, and tell it to yourself from the
beginning, without knowing for even one moment whether you were the
man or the woman in the story."</TE>
<TE>   "I never imagined," Yair writes in one of his early letters, "that
meeting a stranger's language could be as exciting as the first touch
of her body, and her smell, and the texture of her skin and hair and
beauty marks." Exciting it is, given the always exquisite language
Grossman attaches even to Yair and Miriam's ugliest confessions. And
yet, with all the possibilities of e-mail and phone sex, there is
something piercingly sad about Yair's search for a 19th century
epistolary solution, the distance, the refusal to substitute this
writing therapy with physical contact. In real life, Yair confesses,
he is a dealer of rare and used books. "I thought I finally found my
vocation," he writes to Miriam in his last letter, "working with
books, searching to find for people the stories from their childhood
that they loved. What could be more suitable for me? Apparently it
isn't. I am only almost happy here. It is still a secondhand
pleasure."</TE>
<TE>   One has to squint fairly hard to see the usual obsessions of
Grossman, who hitherto has chosen more clearly Jewish and Israeli
topics--the Six-Day War, Palestinians, the Holocaust--for his novels
and nonfiction. And yet, as "Be My Knife" moves inevitably away from
Yair's letters to a denouement of frightening honesty, it locates
itself in a non-Keatsian country, where truth is not always beauty
but the bitter fruit of a tree sitting in a promised, unattainable
paradise.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In March 1919, Adolph Zukor and William Randolph Hearst, the nation's
two most powerful media barons, one in moving pictures, the other in
newspapers, announced a joint venture. Hearst was going to build a
motion picture studio in New York and produce features based on
stories from his Cosmopolitan magazine. Zukor would release them.
Suspecting that his partner, at age 56, might need some assistance in
his new career as film producer and studio owner, Zukor offered to
help. Hearst turned him down. "Making pictures," he wrote Zukor, "is
fundamentally like making publications.... I think I have learned
various things in the publishing business that will be of value in
the motion picture business."</LD>
<LD>   Hearst had been telling stories with pictures since 1887, when he
took over as editor of his father's San Francisco Examiner. He had
converted a moribund newspaper into the most vibrant paper on the
West Coast by outbidding his rivals for their top reporters and
editors and signing up the nation's best artists to illustrate their
work. He would follow the same path in moving pictures.</LD>
<TE>   His first step, after announcing his agreement with Zukor, was to
offer fabulously inflated contracts to Frances Marion, who until then
had been Mary Pickford's screenwriter, and Josef Urban, the
distinguished Austrian artist and architect who was chief designer
for both the Metropolitan Opera and Ziegfeld Follies. With Urban
designing his sets and Marion writing the scripts, Hearst's
Cosmopolitan Productions quickly established itself as one of the
nation's premier studios. An early film, "Humoresque," based on a
Fanny Hurst short story, won the Photoplay Gold Medal for best
picture in 1920.</TE>
<TE>   Hearst had not entered the business to make his companion, Marion
Davies, a star. Still, by the early 1920s, she was appearing
regularly in his films, several of which not only did well at the box
office but also were warmly received by critics not on the Hearst
payroll. Even though Orson Welles admitted that his cinematic
creation, opera singer Susan Alexander, bore "no resemblance at all"
to movie star Marion Davies, it has been difficult not to see
Davies--and Hearst, her champion and producer--through the distorting
lens of "Citizen Kane."</TE>
<TE>   Of all the elements in Hearst's vast media empire--which by the
late 1930s included 26 newspapers in 18 cities, 13 magazines, wire
and feature services, radio stations, a newsreel company and a film
studio--his career in moving pictures is least understood. In "Hearst
Over Hollywood: Power, Passion, and Propaganda in the Movies," Louis
Pizzitola attempts to recount the history of Hollywood as impacted by
Hearst's presence and power while "telling Hearst's life story from a
Hollywood perspective." If Pizzitola had stayed within the boundaries
of this project, his book would have been much more successful--and
useful--than it is. Even so, he has been able to fill in many of the
gaps in our knowledge, especially in regard to Hearst's involvement
in moving pictures before 1919.</TE>
<TE>   It is apparent from the opening pages that Pizzitola has done a
prodigious amount of research. His first chapter begins with a
discussion of Tammany Hall corruption. Hearst is introduced on Page 8
as "one of the most prominent allies of Tammany Hall." From there
Pizzitola makes his way to the Dewey Theater, which was operated by a
Tammany stalwart, to a Hannah Willson, who, in 1895, lived with her
daughters behind the theater and, according to Pizzitola, ran a
brothel. Willson's daughter, Millicent, would later marry Hearst.
Pizzitola's evidence that the future Mrs. Hearst grew up in a brothel
owned by her mother is attributed to a "preponderance of
circumstantial evidence" and an untitled 1913 "broadside" written to
smear Hearst. What does any of this have to do with the story of
Hearst and Hollywood? I'm not sure. But it is a fit beginning for
what turns out to be more an indictment of Hearst than a case study
of his association with Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   It is, of course, not difficult to condemn Hearst on any number of
counts, especially after he veered to the hard right in the middle
1930s to become one of this nation's most vicious Red-baiters and an
unabashed Hitler supporter. But Pizzitola also attempts to prove that
Hearst was a bootlegger, that he informed on Zukor during a Federal
Trade Commission investigation of Paramount for antitrust violations,
that he was an "organizer of organized crime" in Chicago and that he
so disappointed his own mother that "in one of her final and most
severe acts of scorn," she banned his wife from visiting her
deathbed.</TE>
<TE>   Pizzitola never allows a paucity of evidence to interfere with his
crusade. He is committed, as others have been, to branding Hearst as
an anti-Semite. But instead of digging up direct evidence, he
stretches credulity by engaging in tortured exercises of guilt by
association. He ties Hearst to rabid anti-Semites such as out-of-work
screenwriter Paul Schofield, who, according to Pizzitola, declared in
an open letter that American writers should "not stand by and give up
their livelihoods for [Jewish refugee] writers who 'are AWOL from
concentration camps.'" Hearst never met Schofield, never corresponded
with him, never employed him in any capacity and never referred to
him or his work. How then does Pizzitola connect the two? Schofield,
we are told, claimed in a letter to Westbrook Pegler that his
neighbor, Adela Rogers St. Johns, a Hearst reporter, was an "ally."
Schofield's views, Pizzitola also tells us, were cited without
attribution in an anti-Semitic tract self-published by a radio
broadcaster who had once worked for Hearst.</TE>
<TE>   Like Hearst at his worst, Pizzitola can see only one side of the
story--his. Evidence that might contradict his interpretation is
ignored or dismissed. In the midst of his indictment of Hearst as an
anti-Semite, Pizzitola acknowledges that the Hearst papers in 1941
condemned Charles Lindbergh's accusations that American Jews were
"pressing" the country into war. Pizzitola dismisses the editorial
attacks on Lindbergh's anti-Semitism by alleging that Hearst only
authorized them "after receiving heavy pressure" from a financial
advisor. Surely Pizzitola knows Hearst was beholden to no
one--certainly not one of his employees--when it came to setting his
editorial policies.</TE>
<TE>   Many of Pizzitola's claims are simply ludicrous. Though dozens of
editorials, letters, memoranda and the evidence assembled by every
one of Hearst's biographers attests to his visceral disgust with
President Herbert Hoover and his tepid attempts to rescue the nation
from the Depression, Pizzitola declares, without providing any
documentation at all, that the reason Hearst finally broke with
Hoover was because the president turned down an invitation to visit
San Simeon and meet Davies.</TE>
<TE>   The problem isn't that Pizzitola hasn't done his research but that
he doesn't know what to do with it. He has, no doubt, spent years on
this project, traveled to archives in dozens of cities, interviewed
scores of individuals whose parents or grandparents knew Hearst and
read tens of thousands of pages from Hearst's papers and the industry
trades. But he isn't skeptical enough of his sources and doesn't wish
or know how to place them--and Hearst--into any larger historical
context.</TE>
<TE>   He makes much, for example, of an agreement negotiated in
September 1934 between officials from Hearst's newsreel company and
Ufa, a German film company, giving the International Film Service
access to Ufa news films and vice versa. A similar deal was
negotiated at the same time with a British film company. There was
nothing unusual in either deal and nothing particularly sinister in
making an agreement with a German company in 1934. Such deals were
commonplace before November 1938 and Kristallnacht. This is not to
say that Hearst did not use every means at his disposal to boost
Hitler. But he did so publicly, in signed editorials on his front
pages, not in secret backroom deals, as Pizzitola implies.</TE>
<TE>   Pizzitola acknowledges in his preface that he has not set out to
write a definitive biography. What he gives us instead is a skewed,
selective tour of Hearst's life and work. He is, unfortunately, so
focused on convicting Hearst of a lifetime of high crimes and
misdemeanors that he ends up undermining his own analysis and
distracting himself from what might have been a magnificent--and much
needed book--on Hearst and moving pictures.</TE>

<DH>As the first recipient of a Martin Scorsese fellowship,
Katherine Lindberg found she didn't have to fight quite so hard in
Hollywood.</DH>

<AU>DIANNE BATES</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Martin Scorsese hasn't forgotten the valuable lessons he learned from
those who served as his mentors at the beginning of his filmmaking
career.</LD>
<LD>   Well-guarded industry doors flew open when his protege,
31-year-old writer-director Katherine Lindberg, mentioned that
"Martin" told her to call.</LD>
<LD>   "Rain," the first feature film by Lind- berg, the first graduate
recipient of the Martin Scorsese Young Filmmaker Fellowship
established at New York University, premiered at the recent Sundance
Film Festival. The film might be called Midwestern noir and offers a
stark examination of a small group of people whose lives are
intertwined with murder, mystery, sex and small-town isolation. The
executive producer is, you guessed it, Scorsese.</LD>
<TE>   The mentor relationship between the director and Lindberg was
established after the award and intensified during the often arduous
script development process.</TE>
<TE>   Scorsese, speaking by phone from New York City, where he is
editing "Gangs of New York" for release next summer, gave credit to
several early influences on his own career, one from film school and
another a legendary producer of B-movies.</TE>
<TE>   "My teacher-student relationship really began with an NYU
professor named Haig Manoogian," Scorsese said. "He was very
inspirational and pushed me through making my short films and my
attempt at a first feature, which eventually became a film titled
'Who's That Knocking at My Door.'</TE>
<TE>   "Roger Corman saw it when it had a short release in Los Angeles at
the old Vagabond Theater under a different title. I always felt that
Corman's group was sort of a university of its own. There were a
number of people that Corman put through his process. Monte Hellman,
[Francis Ford] Coppola. I think Coppola considers Corman even more of
a mentor. He did a lot of work there. [Peter] Bogdanovich's first
film, 'Targets,' which is a wonderful film."</TE>
<TE>   Corman gave Scorsese "Boxcar Bertha" to direct, with a shooting
schedule of 24 days. "His form of mentoring was very strong and
directional. He said, 'We're making an exploitation film. It's to be
shot in four six-day weeks in Arkansas for this amount of money.
There's got to be a certain amount of violence and a certain amount
of sexuality.' He would even go page by page and show us exactly
where these elements should come in.</TE>
<TE>   "You learned the discipline of making a film on schedule, and
delivering that film, [cutting a reel a day], delivering the rough
cut and getting it out," Scorsese said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the most exciting thing that could have happened to me at
the time," he admitted. "I couldn't have made 'Mean Streets' without
Roger Corman and the people he introduced me to. There were a couple
of people, one called Paul Rapp, who helped me put together 'Mean
Streets' afterward."</TE>
<TE>   Mentoring is not just about teaching and learning from an
established pro. It's also about that magic Rolodex filled with
important contact numbers. Lindberg and undergraduate award recipient
Kevin Jordan met with Scorsese, and both expressed an interest in
going to Morocco, where he was filming "Kundun." They were there for
six weeks, shadowing Scorsese and taking notes.</TE>
<TE>   "They observed the shooting and basically behaved as if they were
in a classroom, which is good," Scorsese says. "I think they had
access to other people on the crew--particularly the producers and
particularly Roger Deakins, who was an extraordinary director of
photography. They asked those people questions. Each film has its own
problems that are very, very specific to that particular production
and story. This ['Kundun'] is the one they happened to catch.
'Casino' would have been something different.</TE>
<TE>   "Katherine Lindberg actually met ['Rain' producer] Jordi Ros, who
was one of the Disney executives, when he came down to watch some of
the shooting."</TE>
<TE>   After reading the treatment for 'Rain,' Scorsese helped finance
the script with funds left over from the Disney "Kundun" deal, but
says his expertise in funding film projects is minimal.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not really a producer in this way," he said, laughing. "It's
hard for me to figure out how pictures get financed because there's
so many ways these days. I'm just trying to hang onto my own
[projects]. You have to credit Jordi Ros for staying with it ['Rain']
and getting people who read scripts at Disney to get behind it. They
liked it very much and thought it was very interesting. Then he left
Disney but stayed on board as a producer. In the meantime, I more or
less mentored the script. Jordi was able to get Lolafilms in Spain
interested in the financing. I think that's when things really
started to come together."</TE>
<TE>   Scorsese isn't particularly interested in what people think
"plays" at the box office these days. "I'm more interested,
particularly in Katherine's case, in the idea of a new voice. A new
way of seeing things and telling a new story. A story told with
pictures and sound through a new experience. I saw something there
that I thought was really interesting to pursue. We tried to support
that vision. I don't want other people coming in and interfering with
that vision. Not that there are people around looking to tear it
apart or interfere unnecessarily. You have to be careful with the
word 'interfere.'"</TE>
<TE>   Scorsese is quick to point out that an old dog, no matter how
famous or established, can still learn new tricks. "I hope that when
I go through this process with the younger filmmakers that I can
learn too. Being around the younger sensibility that has energy and a
whole life and work ahead of them is a good thing. I don't know in
the future how much more I can do, because I primarily need the time
for my own films, but I found 'Rain' to be a particularly rewarding
process for me."</TE>
<TE>   Lindberg knows she was fortunate to have attracted Scorsese's
attention.</TE>
<TE>   The New Mexico native was on her way to a career in the theater
when she took some film production courses at NYU and got hooked on
filmmaking. She had already won some awards for her short films
before receiving the Scorsese fellowship.</TE>
<TE>   The idea for "Rain" came to her during down time on the "Kundun"
set. "I've always been interested in the criminal mind, particularly
criminal women. I knew from the beginning that the lead character was
a woman who was going to kill her husband. I also knew she wasn't
going to leave. This wasn't going to be a road movie. I began with
that and then began filling in the blanks. The entire story
surrounded this one character [played by Melora Walters] and her
inability to leave a place."</TE>
<TE>   When asked if mentor Scorsese allowed her to follow her creative
voice, she was quite adamant. "Absolutely," she said. "Ultimately
there were editorial decisions that we differed on, and he always
made it very clear that it was my film and my choice. My lessons to
learn, so to speak. "Martin's generosity and support has so far
surpassed anything I could have imagined or dreamed of. For example,
when I was out in California, I was able to have meetings with Jordi
Ros set up through Martin's office. Any executive, at Martin's
request, will take a meeting with a complete unknown. Jordi
ultimately became the producer, so the effect was very direct."</TE>
<TE>   Lindberg hopes the relationship continues.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's not only a lifetime resource for me, but for other
filmmakers as well. His gift is not only to general audiences, but to
filmmakers too. I pray to God that someday I will have the amount of
energy that he has now. I hope someday that I get to a point in my
career where I can help someone who's just starting out. Having
someone look at your scripts and take an interest in your work is
invaluable."</TE>
<TE>   Especially when that person is Martin Scorsese.</TE>

<LD>Chalk it up to the luck of the Irish and a lot of hard work. The
Celtic Arts Center, one of Los Angeles' longest-lived culturally
specific arts organizations, had fallen on some hard times. The
group's Hollywood venue burned, it lost a beloved company leader, and
its ranks had dwindled.</LD>
<LD>   But now the Celtic Arts Center is making a comeback, launching its
first full theater season in its new Valley home, with a revitalized
and fast-growing membership to boot. According to the center, the
roster has rebounded from fewer than 70 to more than 300, and it's
still climbing.</LD>
<LD>   On top of that, the organization has now scored the kind of
artistic coup that would be the envy of venues many times its size,
securing the rights to a play by Marie Jones, best known for the
Tony-nominated Broadway and West End hit "Stones in His Pockets."</LD>
<TE>   Opening this weekend is the L.A. premiere of Jones' "A Night in
November," performed by Northern Irish actor Marty Maguire and
directed by Tim Byron Owen. The Celtic Arts Center's theater season
will continue with "The Secret Life of Constance Wilde" by Thomas
Kilroy, "The Lonesome West" by Martin McDonagh and a one-act play
festival.</TE>
<TE>   The stroke of good fortune of getting the rights to "A Night in
November" is not lost on those in charge at the Celtic Arts Center in
the Valley Village neighborhood of L.A. "She's a produced playwright
on Broadway, nominated for three Tony Awards last year," says
artistic director Barry Lynch, an actor who was one of the center's
founding members. "We're a 49-seat theater in Valley Village,
California--not even Los Angeles. It's Valley Village, California!"</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, it didn't hurt that Maguire and Jones were friends.
"She gave me my first professional acting job in 1986," Maguire says.
"I auditioned at Marie's company, Charabanc Theatre in Belfast, and
that was the start of my relationship with her.</TE>
<TE>   "I think because it was me who was performing it, Marie gave her
blessing," he continues. "[She was] considering bringing back 'A
Night in November' with a huge star. But God love Marie, she's kept
her feet on the ground. It went from being maybe Kenneth Branagh to
me, in a little theater, which was incredibly generous."</TE>
<TE>   It was generous and also shrewd. The Belfast-born Maguire was
clearly poised to bring much of his own life experience to the piece.
A panoramic solo with more than 20 characters, the play focuses on
the humble life of an Everyman civil servant in Northern Ireland and
the personal transformation he undergoes when confronted with the
bigotry and hatred of his countrymen before embarking on an odyssey
to America.</TE>
<TE>   "This man echoes everything I've always felt about Northern
Ireland, how futile it is that people are murdering each other over
religion and politics," Maguire says. "It's one guy's discovery that
even though he's a Northern Irish Protestant, why can't we all just
be Irish people and stop killing each other?"</TE>
<TE>   The Belfast-born Jones' work as an actress and writer has long
been known in Northern Ireland, but it was only with the hit "Stones
in His Pockets" that she broke through to more widespread recognition
as a playwright. First staged at the Lyric Theatre in Belfast,
"Stones in His Pockets" won not only Tony nominations, but also
London's Olivier Award for its West End production.</TE>
<TE>   Maguire has followed Jones' recent fame, even as he's continued to
dream of performing her work himself. The actor, who moved to L.A. in
1989, has long been working as "a typical bartender-actor" at a place
called Ireland's 32 in Van Nuys, often organizing pub theater and
staged readings there.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, when a critic friend brought Jones' "A Night in
November" to Maguire's attention, he couldn't resist giving it an
outing. "Over the last couple of years, I've done maybe six or seven
performances of it," he says, "but always dreaming of the day when I
could do a proper production."</TE>
<TE>   One of the people who caught one of Maguire's pub readings was Tom
Hayden, who invited the actor to perform the work as a fund-raiser
for his unsuccessful campaign for Los Angeles City Council in the
last election. That's where the Celtic Arts Center's Lynch and Owen
first saw Maguire perform the piece.</TE>
<TE>   "I was invited to see a reading in an old abandoned bank building
on skid row," Lynch recalls. "I'm not usually a fan of one-person
shows, but I was just so completely blown away by not only the
material, but by the actor.</TE>
<TE>   "What attracted me most about this play was that through the years
I've seen many plays that portrayed the Catholics to be bad guys and
tons of plays that portrayed the Protestants to be the bad guys, and
in this play there is no bad guy," Lynch continues. "This play is
just about a man who wants to belong, a man who wants to be a part of
something, a man who just wants to be."</TE>
<TE>   The material also has personal resonance for Lynch, a former
member of New York's Circle Rep who has been with the Celtic Arts
Center since it began in the mid-'80s. "I had one grandfather who was
born in Derry, in the north of Ireland, who was a Protestant, and the
other side of my family was Catholic," he explains. "I have a strong
identification with the two sides."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the play's underlying ecumenism struck home. "My mom
would pray in any building," Lynch says. "She'd go into a synagogue
as fast as she'd go into a Protestant church as fast as she'd go into
a Catholic church. It didn't matter. And this play is about a man who
says finally it doesn't matter."</TE>
<TE>   Lynch and Owen were touched by Maguire's performance. "I said we
would really love to do this play and we're going to do everything we
can to get the rights, not expecting to get them," Lynch recalls.
"Tim Owen went through a lot of different channels. They pursued it
and pursued it. Finally she said, 'OK, I'll give you a six-week run,'
and we were just ecstatic."</TE>
<TE>   The timing was also right, in terms of the renaissance of the
Celtic Arts Center. Only six months earlier, the organization had
undergone a key change due to the terminal illness of former
executive director Sean Walsh. "We started reorganizing about a year
and a half ago when Sean Walsh found out he had cancer," explains
executive director Thom MacNamara. "When Sean passed away, the board
voted me in, and my first big project was to find a new venue."</TE>
<TE>   After locating the current site, MacNamara spearheaded the
conversion of the space, a former furniture outlet store, into a
multiuse arts and community center, suitable for the center's varied
programming of theater, music, dance, spoken word and more.</TE>
<TE>   "We had generous donations from Sony, some individuals who gave us
some start-up money, and one man who gave us his Home Depot credit
card. And we had some very skilled people who knew what to do,"
MacNamara says. "There's a new wooden floor that is dancer friendly
and they built everything from scratch."</TE>
<TE>   Lynch helped with the actual building, as he had with the center's
old home on Hollywood Boulevard. "This is the second time I've walked
into the space on day one and built that place from scratch," he
recalls. "Something magical happens when you do it from scratch. It's
yours, and when you walk on the stage, it's familiar and everyone
knows it. You have an investment."</TE>
<TE>   Building the theater itself was a labor of love, just as
rebuilding the Celtic Arts Center has been, particularly in a city as
geographically and culturally diverse as Los Angeles. "L.A. is not
like most cities where you have central locales where specific ethnic
groups gravitate to," Lynch says. "To attract the community was a
little more difficult out here, but we've done it. We have a strong
base. We've got a lot of spirit. And we've got a lot of tradition.</TE>
<TE>   "We have outgrown the space we're in now, in one year," Lynch
continues.</TE>
<TE>   "It's phenomenal. In my wildest imagination, I didn't know it
would grow this fast. Why? Because I think there's a need in people
to belong, the same as in 'A Night in November.' We need to have
community."</TE>

<HD>Debate in the Delta</HD>
<DH>Who was the king of blues singers? An exhaustive new set
makes the case for obscure Charley Patton.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Almost everything about pop music is subject to debate--from naming
the best Beatles album to figuring out whether Jackie Brenston's
"Rocket 88" or the Crows' "Gee" was the first true rock 'n' roll hit.</LD>
<LD>   It has long been possible, however, to take comfort in at least
one certainty: Robert Johnson was the king of the Delta blues
singers.</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to a small but enormously influential body of work in the
late 1930s, Johnson, the illegitimate son of a Mississippi
sharecropper, helped inspire generations of blues and rock musicians,
from Muddy Waters to the Rolling Stones. The latter's version of
Johnson's "Love in Vain" is a masterpiece of romantic anguish.</LD>
<TE>   Bob Dylan even toasted Johnson, who died in 1938 at age 37, by
featuring a Johnson album prominently in the cover photo of his 1965
album "Bringing It All Back Home."</TE>
<TE>   So why is there suddenly all this talk about Charley Patton?</TE>
<TE>   Dylan contributed to the buzz last fall by dedicating a song to
Patton in his Grammy-nominated "Love and Theft" album. He piqued
curiosity even more by declaring in an interview that if he were just
making records for his own pleasure, he would "only record Charley
Patton songs."</TE>
<TE>   Revenant Records, a tiny, Austin, Texas, label founded by the late
guitarist John Fahey, has now stirred the Patton fires further with a
seven-disc boxed set, "Screamin' and Hollerin' the Blues: The Worlds
of Charley Patton."</TE>
<TE>   The project seems absurdly ambitious at first glance--the
packaging is so lavish that the set weighs 7 pounds. The price is
equally hefty--about $175 in most stores.</TE>
<TE>   "Screamin'" contains not only all 50 or so recordings Patton made
between 1929 and his death from heart failure in 1934, but also
nearly a dozen more recordings he played on (or "possibly" played
on). There is also a disc devoted to some of Patton's peers
(including Ma Rainey and Furry Lewis) and followers (Howlin' Wolf,
the Staple Singers), as well as a paperbound copy of Fahey's 1970
master's thesis on Patton.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard not to be intrigued.</TE>
<TE>   Patton recorded with the same raw, primal approach as Johnson, but
seven years earlier. As you hear him drawing from the various pop,
folk and blues strains of the time, you get the sense of someone
instinctively trying to stitch together a new art form.</TE>
<TE>   "What Patton portrays brilliantly is the uncanny feeling that the
real forces controlling him are not forces outside himself, but dimly
beheld, obscure 'jinxes' which hang over him and cloud his thoughts
like a pall," Fahey wrote in his thesis.</TE>
<TE>   It sure sounds as if we've got another debate on our hands.</TE>
<TE>   The enthusiasm of Dylan and Fahey aside, Patton is little known
outside hard-core blues circles, partly because his music isn't as
easy to absorb as Johnson's and because it hasn't been promoted as
aggressively by a major label.</TE>
<TE>   A Grammy-winning, two-disc Johnson retrospective, "The Complete
Recordings," has sold more than 2 million copies since its release by
Columbia Records in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Patton recorded the bulk of his material in 1929 for Paramount
Records, which closed a few years later and sold Patton's original
recording masters for scrap. The material then went into public
domain, meaning any label could pick it up.</TE>
<TE>   That free access would seem to be a help in getting someone's
music exposed, but it has the opposite effect. No major label wants
to invest in re-releasing the old Patton records because budget
labels would be free to release the same material and profit from the
major label's promotion campaign. There's also the problem of sound
quality. Without the master recordings, labels would have to turn to
scratchy old 78s as source material.</TE>
<TE>   Patton's name has popped up enough in blues histories for
roots-minded music fans to search out his records on small, indie
labels, including Yazoo and Catfish, but Patton's vocals are
frequently so hard to decipher that most listeners probably just
wrote him off.</TE>
<TE>   Even on the new set, which benefits from sonic upgrading, it's
virtually impossible to follow Patton's vocals because of his
careless diction and tendency to drop syllables or even whole words.
Thankfully, the Revenant team includes lyrics as part of its
obsessive attention to detail, as well as detailed accounts of each
song.</TE>
<TE>   As folk-music scholar Dick Spottswood points out in one of the
set's historical essays, there is a strong sense of spontaneity to
Patton's recordings--as if they were always works in project with the
recording session version being no more definitive than the version
he might sing a week or year later in a club.</TE>
<TE>   Using the perspective provided by the set's essays, you can follow
Patton's musical path with far more ease and appreciation than
before--and it's a fascinating journey.</TE>
<TE>   Patton, who was born in rural Mississippi around 1890, was already
a popular entertainer throughout the Mississippi Delta by the time he
started recording for Paramount in June 1929. His first singles sold
so well in the South that he was brought back four months later to
record more songs.</TE>
<TE>   To avoid flooding the market with material by the prolific writer,
according to one account, Paramount released "Screamin' and Hollerin'
the Blues," a single from that first session, under the name the
Masked Marvel. It was part of an advertising campaign that offered
buyers a free record if they could identify the mystery singer. The
only clue was that he was an exclusive Paramount artist.</TE>
<TE>   Although it was easy for anyone familiar with the Paramount roster
to identify the man behind the raw, robust vocals on the single, the
facts of Patton's personal life remain pretty much a mystery.</TE>
<TE>   After being enthralled by Patton's music, Fahey, a much respected
guitarist with a great love of American roots music, went to the
Delta in 1958 in hopes of finding out more about Patton.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the information Fahey relays in his thesis has been
challenged by others who also went to Mississippi in search of
answers. There is debate over everything from the spelling of
Patton's first name--Charlie or Charley? Both spellings are found on
his records and even on his death certificate.</TE>
<TE>   There's also debate over his birthplace and even his heritage. In
the only existing photo of him, Patton has strong white features that
separate him from most other Delta blues artists.</TE>
<TE>   David Evans, who wrote one of the set's essays, believes Patton
was one-quarter white, one-quarter to one-half Native American and
the remainder African American.</TE>
<TE>   Patton's background can't compete with the folklore surrounding
Johnson--including the pact Johnson supposedly made with the devil
that gave him special musical powers. With up to eight wives,
however, Patton was clearly no slouch himself in the notoriety
department.</TE>
<TE>   However, it's the music that ultimately matters most--and that is
showcased spectacularly in "Screamin' and Hollerin' the Blues."</TE>
<TE>   "High Water Everywhere," one of an astonishing 24 songs recorded
during the October 1929 sessions, is the tune Dylan specifically
salutes with "High Water (for Charley Patton)," on "Love and Theft,"
and it is probably Patton's most celebrated recording.</TE>
<TE>   Long before signing with Paramount, Patton was a charismatic
entertainer, who relied on show-biz flair and even comedy as much as
songwriting to win audience favor. Much like Jimi Hendrix decades
later, Patton frequently delighted crowds by playing the guitar
behind his head or between his legs.</TE>
<TE>   By the time of "High Water Everywhere," however, one senses an
increasing element  of commentary and personal observation in his
music.</TE>
<TE>   "High Water Everywhere" reflects on the suffering caused by the
massive Mississippi River flood that devastated parts of Mississippi
and Louisiana in 1927. Unlike earlier folk and blues narratives about
tragic events, Patton injected a greater sense of personal emotion
into the recording.</TE>
<TE>   As Spottswood points out in the set, "No longer just a blues
entertainer, he becomes a sanctified preacher delivering an
impassioned sermon, with snapped bass strings and thumbed guitar box
to emphasize the text and underscore the tension."</TE>
<TE>   Patton was so moved by seeing the wrath of the flood that he wrote
"High Water Everywhere" in two parts. In the first, he expresses
helplessness. In the second, he is shaken by the devastation: "Oh,
woman, children sinkin' down. Lord have mercy! I couldn't see nobody
... wasn't no one to be foun'."</TE>
<TE>   In the same October sessions, Patton also recorded "I Will Not Be
Moved," a declaration of religious faith that years later was adapted
by civil rights protesters: "I'm on my way to glory/I shall not be
moved." He too sang happy songs, lustful songs, heartbreak songs--all
in the spirit of ultimate self-affirmation that is at the heart of
the Delta blues style.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson most certainly benefited from listening to Patton. By
adding polish, intensity and discipline to his own recordings,
Johnson speaks more directly and clearly to today's audiences, but
it's no longer possible to start your investigation of the Delta
blues singers with Johnson. Patton's body of work is simply too
substantial.</TE>
<TE>   So, who was the original king of the Delta blues?</TE>
<TE>   That's now open to debate.</TE>

<HD>A One-Two Punch Line</HD>
<DH>A British duo re-creates another pair's sketches while
showing how two people create humor. Get it?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA ISENBERG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Sean Foley and Hamish McColl, known collectively as the Right Size,
can turn almost anything into comedy. Two balloonists crashing
through a villager's roof in the far frozen north of England. Two
middle-aged golfers who disappear behind a sofa. Two vaudevillians
who can't leave the stage. Two complete strangers trapped in a
bathroom together for 25 years.</LD>
<LD>   But when it came to performing as Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise,
arguably the most famous of all British comedy duos, the Olivier
Award-winning Right Size drew the line. They'd be impertinent but not
impersonators. Besides, nobody could really re-create the comedy of
the late Morecambe and Wise, who at their peak in 1977 reached
one-half of the U.K.'s population with their Christmas show.</LD>
<LD>   Producer David Pugh, however, is not an easy man to turn down. He
took Yasmina Reza's award-winning play "Art" around the world,
shepherding 27 English language productions to more than 5 million
people. Pugh thought if anyone could capture the spirit of Morecambe
and Wise, it would be the Right Size.</LD>
<TE>   Plenty of meetings, workshops and rehearsals later, the Right Size
is playing on the West End, reminding Britons of the comedy shows
they loved and reminding Americans that Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and
Costello, Burns and Allen, Rowan and Martin and the Smothers Brothers
had no monopoly on double acts.</TE>
<TE>   Directed by Kenneth Branagh and replete with such mystery guests
as Ralph Fiennes and Ewan McGregor, "The Play What I Wrote" has the
biggest advance for a play in West End history. Earlier this month,
it received four nominations for the 2002 Olivier Awards.</TE>
<TE>   With its silly songs, dances, ventriloquism and rat-infested
dungeon, "The Play What I Wrote" simultaneously captures the comedy
of both Morecambe and Wise and the Right Size. "While we're trying to
evoke the comic spirit of Morecambe and Wise, the boys are very
original artists in their own right," Branagh says. "We didn't want a
replay or an exercise in nostalgia."</TE>
<TE>   This is the 12th show in 14 years for "the boys," McColl, 39, and
Foley, 37, two actor-comics who first met in 1987 when both were
studying in Paris with the French comic Philipe Gaulier. For their
first show a year later, they made all the costumes and props. And
when the show's title was changed to "Que Sera" from "The Right
Size," the latter phrase wound up as the company's name, McColl says,
"since we liked everybody's aspirations to be the right size."</TE>
<TE>   While "The Play What I Wrote" marks their third appearance on the
West End, they are probably best known for their work in the
Edinburgh Fringe and smaller venues here and in other countries. In
India, where they performed in the dark for 40 minutes after a
Calcutta theater's lighting went out, a critic referred to their work
as "the most hilarious experience ever witnessed." A critic for
Edinburgh's Scotsman newspaper once suggested they be canonized.</TE>
<TE>   Onstage, Foley specializes in physical humor, while McColl plays
straight man, worrying aloud that he isn't funny enough. McColl's
character, who is also named Hamish, has made a scratchy record album
on which he recorded the one laugh he got years ago. But even as
Foley's character, who is also named Sean, plays that record for the
audience, his ribbing is still more benign than mean.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Right Size reflects the English music hall tradition
that spawned Morecambe and Wise, its humor is in many ways universal.
While there are such trademark gags in "The Play What I Wrote" as
Morecambe and Wise's catch phrases, twisted eyeglasses and funny skip
dances, the theater is filled with foreigners and young people who
have no idea who Morecambe and Wise were. "You might wonder about the
eyeglasses or things like that," McColl says, "but you're not going
to get robbed of a sense of understanding the piece."</TE>
<TE>   Branagh agrees, adding that "if you find people falling over
funny, no subtitles required. Partly because of their comedy
inflection, partly because of the way the boys play it, even if you
don't get the point of the joke, you can still get the intent from
the good-hearted, good-natured delivery. The audience feels safe."</TE>
<TE>   It's no doubt similar to what families here felt watching
Morecambe and Wise's television specials, which ran from 1961 to
1983. Moving from vaudeville to television, Morecambe and Wise
offered not just original puns, pratfalls, song and dance, but a
series of inane comedy sketches featuring such "mystery guests" as
Glenda Jackson, Andre Previn, John Gielgud, TV anchors and government
officials. Even the royal family would delay Christmas dinner until
the annual TV show ended.</TE>
<TE>   Pugh and his family watched them too, and several years ago, the
38-year-old theatrical producer began acquiring rights to the
Morecambe and Wise material. When he saw the Right Size's 1998 "Do
You Come Here Often?," an Olivier Award-winning play about two men
stuck in a bathroom for 25 years, he immediately called "the boys"
and took them to lunch.</TE>
<TE>   "The boys" weren't convinced. "We said no," McColl recalls,
"because in this country, Morecambe and Wise are an institution which
were supremely loved, still are remembered very fondly and repeated a
lot on television."</TE>
<TE>   Neither a bio play nor impersonating them sounded right either,
adds Foley. "And with their relationship to the British public,
people would just say, 'Well, you're not  Morecambe and Wise, and get
off the stage, please.'"</TE>
<TE>   But Foley and McColl too were fans, so they kept looking for ways
to bring them back. "When we hit on the idea of seeing them through
the eyes of another double act [like us]," McColl says, "that was
really the key. After that, we were able to escape the idea of
impersonation and address the wider issue of double acts in general:
how they operate, who does what, who thinks he's funny, who thinks
he's more important, who thinks he's less important. We've worked
together a lot, so it became something we were able to personalize."</TE>
<TE>   They set about "plundering this enormously rich treasure trove of
Morecambe and Wise material," McColl continues, "and sort of
cherry-picking what we felt best suited the contemporary audience,
our sense of humor and the shape of the piece." Pugh provided funds
for a workshop and the hiring of a third actor, Toby Jones, who plays
such roles during the show as producer Pugh and the "half-girl,
half-kipper" Daryl Hannah of "Splash" fame.</TE>
<TE>   Having decided they would benefit from outside direction, Pugh
brought them together with Branagh. Pugh had worked for Robert Fox,
producer of Branagh's 1982 London theatrical debut in "Another
Country," and recalled how the actor would do Morecambe impressions
backstage. Also aware that Branagh had an excellent Rolodex for
potential mystery guests, Pugh called and suggested the
actor-director meet with Foley and McColl.</TE>
<TE>   The team hit it off and began work. A script developed, drawing on
improvisation by McColl, Foley and Jones. Eddie Braben, 80, who wrote
for Morecambe and Wise, also contributed some new gags, McColl says,
"as well as gave his blessing to our putting a retread on some of the
old ones."</TE>
<TE>   "The Play What I Wrote" has the audience laughing from its opening
scene: two guys standing up in a bed singing about two guys standing
up in a bed singing. Early on, the versatile Jones appears as a
gun-toting member of the "Morecambe and Wise Appreciation Society
(Military Wing)," and there are show-stopping moments for chicken
impersonations and other sublimely ridiculous skits. In one of the
show's best and most poignant routines, McColl is consoled about his
ability to get laughs--the delayed laugh, the laugh of anticipation,
and the most sophisticated and no doubt valuable of them all, "the
inaudible laugh."</TE>
<TE>   The show got off to a slow start, with very low advances. But once
it opened and received unanimous raves from critics, says Pugh, box
office went from a $31,460 advance to $730,730 in 72 hours, toppling
a record held by Alan Bennett's "The Lady in the Van" with Maggie
Smith. The show recouped its investment in eight weeks, adds Pugh,
and advances now stand at more than $858,000.</TE>
<TE>   McColl takes particular pride in the audience not being able to
see "the join" between their material and that of Morecambe and Wise.
"The trick of the show is that so much of our stuff is written a la
Morecambe and Wise," Foley adds. "On first glance, people say, 'They
did that 20 years ago on TV,' and we say, 'We just wrote it six
months ago.'"</TE>
<TE>   Inspired by Morecambe and Wise's playlets, "The Play What I Wrote"
also features an overwritten, overacted play in period costume. Each
evening, an invited guest takes a role in the Bastille scene of "A
Tight Squeeze for the Scarlet Pimple," heralded as the first of 72
plays penned by McColl's character to be produced.</TE>
<TE>   Each guest enters to a sort of roast-cum-introduction. Minnie
Driver, for instance, was greeted with the question "Exactly what
have you done?" And when she replied that she'd been in 20 films,
Foley inquired if any of them had been developed.</TE>
<TE>   The Right Size is joined in the Bastille scene by Jones, a
rubber-faced actor just over 5 feet tall who writes many of his
lines. With Fiennes, the first mystery guest, Jones appeared in
bandages as "The English Patient" and came onstage talking about the
desert. With McGregor, he appeared in a kilt and sang songs from the
film "Moulin Rouge." Mystery guest Branagh was introduced as "the man
who thinks he's William Shakespeare," after which Jones came on
dressed as a knight, ranting about "the unleashing of the dogs of
war--the St. Bernards, the Dalmatians."</TE>
<TE>   Branagh says actors have called him to appear in the show, and
Pugh adds that nobody has turned him down yet.</TE>
<TE>   "We pay them epartment500 [$715] a performance," Pugh says, "and they all
want to do it. The Evening Standard said last week that of the 100
most chic things to be in 2002, No. 1 was to be a guest star in 'The
Play What I Wrote.'"</TE>
<TE>   U.S. audiences will possibly be able to judge for themselves. "Do
You Come Here Often?" played at P.S. 122, a performance space on New
York's Lower East Side, and Pugh says he's now speaking with
producers about bringing this show to America as well.</TE>
<TE>   "Morecambe and Wise did six spots on 'The Ed Sullivan Show' and
were a big success," Pugh says. "They were about to come to America
to perform when Eric had his first heart attack and that stopped
them. We'd love to go to New York, and we'd love to do Los Angeles.
Hollywood is a perfect place to get guest stars."</TE>

Felicitous Match-Ups</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Stan Getz would have been 75 on Saturday. But he never came close to
reaching that milestone, dying of cancer on June 6, 1991, in Malibu.
Sixty-four years may seem considerable for a jazz life, when one
considers the more brief spans of Charlie Parker, Lester Young and
John Coltrane, to name only a few. But few artists ever have enough
time, regardless of what they are allotted, to fully fill in the
details of their creative visions. Getz, perhaps more than some,
appeared to have difficulty reaching the potential of his enormous
natural gifts.</LD>
<LD>   That's not to say he wasn't successful. The tenor saxophonist
first came to the attention of the wider jazz audience with a single
remarkable solo on the Woody Herman Orchestra recording of Ralph
Burns' "Early Autumn." His improvisation, twining down from the upper
reaches of his horn, was an emotional revelation for many listeners,
a sweetly accessible connection with the then-newly arriving sounds
of bebop. Only barely out of his teens, Getz found his own synthesis
of Young and Parker, blending it into an instantly recognizable sound
and almost immediate jazz prominence.</LD>
<TE>   That sound and those sweet qualities were most often sustained,
throughout his career, in his ballad work. Anticipating the
anniversary, Verve has gathered a far-ranging collection of
performances in that genre into a single CD release, "Getz for
Lovers" (****). On Feb. 26, Verve will follow with "Getz Plays Jobim:
The Girl From Ipanema" (****), and on March 12 with "The Very Best of
Stan Getz" (****). All this material has been released in various
forms in the past by Verve, which has thoroughly mined its Getz
catalog, dating from the early '50s to the late '60s. But there's no
denying the appeal, and the usefulness, of the thematic collections,
given the atmospheric, mood-setting qualities inherent to Getz's
finer efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "Getz for Lovers" displays his superb balladry, with its
vocal-like phrasing and warm links with the melody, in songs such as
"I'm Glad There Is You," "But Beautiful," "Here's That Rainy Day" and
"Little Girl Blue." A few bossa nova numbers are added--an especially
lovely "Corcovado" with Joao Gilberto--and, less appealingly, a few
numbers are over-weighted with heavy string arrangements.</TE>
<TE>   The Jobim album includes selections from the five bossa nova
albums Getz recorded for Verve in the early '60s, among them the
breakthrough "Jazz Samba" and "Getz/Gilberto," winner of four
Grammys. The "Very Best" album takes a broader look, sampling tunes
from Getz's tenure at Verve.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Verve years obviously represented a major segment of
his life as an artist, Getz made many other recordings, before and
after. Many are available as catalog items--his Roost recordings, for
example, have been re-released by Blue Note, and post-Verve material
is available on Columbia and Concord, among others.</TE>
<TE>   Still, despite all the recordings, despite the occasional spikes
of success--most notably the bossa nova outings--despite his
acknowledgement as a major artist virtually from the time he passed
beyond his teens, there is a sense of unfulfillment in the Getz
catalog. Donald L. Maggin's penetratingly informative biography,
"Stan Getz: A Life in Jazz" (William Morrow), suggests, at least by
implication, that monstrous quantities of ego and
entitlement--supplemented by drugs and alcohol--may have been the
roadblocks that impeded Getz's progress toward a more productive and
fulfilling creative life. But that's only speculation, of course,
since others--Parker immediately comes to mind--were seemingly
undeterred by similar obstacles.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the music still remains. If it is not as good or as
expansive or as deep as it might have been, it still deserves an
honored position in the lexicon of jazz accomplishments. Presumably,
the 75th anniversary will trigger the release of Getz material from
other sources, but no advance notices have yet arrived. Stay tuned
for further developments.</TE>
<TE>   January is never an especially prolific month for new releases,
but a few attractive items have slipped through the post-holiday
haze.</TE>
<TE>   Toots Thielemans and Kenny Werner, "Toots Thielemans &amp; Kenny
Werner" (***1/2, Verve Records). Available Tuesday, the match-up of
harmonica master Thielemans and pianist Werner is their first
recording together, after years of scintillating live performances.
The encounter brings together an extraordinary amount of musical
firepower. Thielemans has recorded with an amazing array of artists,
from Joni Mitchell to Charlie Parker, provided the sound for numerous
films, television scores and commercials, and written music for
"Sesame Street" as well as "Midnight Cowboy." Werner is a gifted
educator, composer and orchestrator, as well as author of the
fascinating book "Effortless Mastery: Liberating the Master Musician
Within."</TE>
<TE>   But there's more. The material here is first-rate: a Michel
Legrand medley; a Frank Sinatra medley; a Bill Evans medley and a
Disney medley. As if that weren't enough, there are individual
entries from Herbie Hancock ("Dolphin Dance") and Chick Corea
("Windows") and a J.S. Bach Sicilienne. Add to that the fact that
describing this pairing as a duo severely understates what Werner
adds to the mix with his string synthesizer scoring, which--done with
the craft of a talented orchestrator--creates a lush and persuasive
cushion of sound.</TE>
<TE>   Still not enough? Add this: The playing by both artists is superb,
executed with mature craftsmanship, offered with rich and
illuminating emotion.</TE>
<TE>   John Scofield, "uberjam" (***, Verve Records). Also in stores
Tuesday. In the publicity material accompanying the album, Scofield
identifies himself by noting, "When confronted with the 'Who is John
Scofield?' question, I like to oversimplify it by saying that 'I like
rock and jazz.'" What's most interesting about that sentence, of
course, is the order of priority. Recent Scofield outings have verged
from one musical pole to another, sometimes emphasizing his
unquestioned jazz chops, sometimes moving dramatically in the
opposite direction. The emphasis here is apparent, with Scofield
insisting on his right to dwell in the land of funk and electronics,
and doing it with considerable style and no small measure of
creativity. But fans of Jim Hall and Joe Pass are directed elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Previte &amp; Bump, "Just Add Water" (***, Palmetto Records).
Drummer-composer Previte has been a staple of the New York
cutting-edge jazz scene for the past two decades. This latest effort,
which revives an ensemble from his first, mid-'80s recording, is a
marvelous catalog of Previte's engaging music. Fully capable of using
every avant-garde technique, he is also an inherent melodist and an
obvious lover of musical fun. As such, "Just Add Water" is filled
with consistently stylish, foot-tapping rhythms, entertaining
ensemble passages and some first-rate soloing from saxophonist Marty
Erlich and trombonist Ray Anderson.</TE>

<DH>A retrospective delves into the otherworldly work of the
late Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, who reveled in words.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN LETRAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This is one way to tell the story of artist Theresa Hak Kyung Cha:
She was born in Korea, raised and educated in California, and died
tragically, murdered in New York City, at the age of 31.</LD>
<LD>   But there is another way to tell it as well: Cha was a prolific
and talented Conceptual artist, ahead of the curve, and even though
her life and her career were cut short, she created a body of work
that continues to grow in impact and resonance.</LD>
<LD>   "Language," Cha once said, was "the common denominator" that
brought her multidisciplinary interests together. A retrospective
exhibition titled "The Dream of the Audience: Theresa Hak Kyung Cha
(1951-1982)," on view through March 10 at UC Irvine's Beall Center
for Art and Technology, documents the work Cha produced in film,
video, performance art and art books.</LD>
<TE>   Organized by the UC Berkeley Art Museum,  it is the most
comprehensive collection of Cha's works since a posthumous solo show
in 1993 at the Whitney Museum of American Art. The Beall is the
second in a six-stop tour that began in Berkeley and ends in Seoul.
Much of the work in this exhibition is drawn from the UC Berkeley Art
Museum's Theresa Hak Kyung Cha Archive, donated to the museum in 1992
by the artist's family.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always an interesting play of language in her work so you
can sense all the multiple meanings of words. She loved taking words
apart and putting them back together," said Yong Soon Min, a friend
of Cha and chairwoman of UC Irvine's studio art department. Min,
along with former Beall Center director Jeanie Weiffenbach, was
instrumental in bringing the show to Orange County. "She was
fascinated by language because of her experience as an immigrant."</TE>
<TE>   Fluent in Korean, French and English, Cha was born in Pusan, South
Korea. She moved with her family to San Francisco in 1964. Her
Catholic upbringing introduced her to Latin. In her works, Cha often
juxtaposed words from the languages she knew with images.</TE>
<TE>   Her 1976 installation "Amer," on display in the Beall show,
focuses on the letters found in the word "America." It may seem
incomplete in English, but in French, the term amer means bitter and
a mer means "to the sea." The visual banter of words and letters is
printed on the stars of an American flag with "AMER" hand-stitched on
one stripe.</TE>
<TE>   "This is telling in the way she works through signs and symbols we
take for granted," Min said. "It struck me because post 9/11 we see
flags everywhere, and here's a piece she did in 1976."</TE>
<TE>   Other pieces in the exhibition include art books Cha created out
of cloth, fiber and paper, and filled with poetry, rubber-stamped
words and Korean symbols. Her slide shows contained images of English
phrases rearranged into grammar trees. She stitched the words
"Repetitive Patterns" in stenciled letters over and over again on a
sheet of cloth. She even invents words such as "Videoeme," the title
of a video project that plays on the word vide, French for "empty."</TE>
<TE>   Most of Cha's work is text and image, in black and white.</TE>
<TE>   "Black and white is closer to how text [in] print looks, and since
language was such a strong element for her, she used black and white.
All of her printed matter was in black and white," Min said.</TE>
<TE>   Cha began studying at UC Berkeley in 1969 and eventually earned
four degrees: a bachelor's in comparative literature in 1973; a
bachelor's in art in 1975; a master's in art in 1977; and a master's
of fine art in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   "She is a unique figure in that she was very mature for her age
and intelligent and phenomenally well-read, so she was able to draw
from so many different sources early in her work. Her work was very
sophisticated and advanced," Min said.</TE>
<TE>   Cha's work reflects "the profound developments of her time and
place--including the radical changes in art--and her own cultural
displacement and alienation," said senior curator Constance M.
Lewallen of the UC Berkeley Art Museum.</TE>
<TE>   Cha studied at Berkeley during heady times. The campus was the
scene of Vietnam War protests and a hotbed of the liberation
movements among women, ethnic groups, gays and lesbians that resulted
in new academic departments in ethnic and women's studies.</TE>
<TE>   Cha's art touched on a wide range of disciplines including visual
and performance art, ethnic studies, Asian American studies, women's
studies, film, literature and linguistics.</TE>
<TE>   Times were changing in the art world too. The Bay Area Conceptual
art movement was in full swing, and the advent of videos fueled Cha's
enthusiasm for experimental work.</TE>
<TE>   Her influences included philosopher Michel Foucault, video artist
Bruce Nauman, French film theorists, Dadaism and the Russian
Constructivists. Her interest in language continued, but she also
developed an eye for film, spending three years as an usher and
cashier at the UC Berkeley Pacific Film Archive, where she watched
countless classic and avant-garde movies, and began developing her
own methods, constructing almost all her films and videos as a series
of stills.</TE>
<TE>   "Alternation and repetition of images and sound, simultaneous
narration, and live action are combined or isolated. These methods
intend to shift the chronology of events, to displace them spatially
and temporally," explained Cha of her film and video work in 1979,
the year she became a National Endowment for the Arts Visual Art
Fellow. "The images and language emerge from sources that are highly
personal ... to evoke other moments in the viewer's memory, that
bridges the viewer and myself."</TE>
<TE>   In 1980, Cha had her first exhibition as a professional artist in
a group show at the San Francisco Art Institute Annual. Her piece,
"Exilee," was a two-channel video projection of a series of
black-and-white still images produced to look like moving images.</TE>
<TE>   "She creates a strong sense of slowness of time, and there are
shadows that indicate the passing of time," Min said. "The piece is
very meditative and attempts to get the viewers to be much more aware
of a sense of passage and of time. The images are like traces of
memory."</TE>
<TE>   But it was Cha's first performance installation of "Other Things
Seen, Other Things Heard" at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art
the year before that caught the attention of San Francisco Bay
Guardian art critic Robert Atkins.</TE>
<TE>   "I left feeling suspended between consciousness and
unconsciousness, as if I had been dreaming someone else's dreams,"
Atkins wrote in his review. "This feat of near magic was accomplished
in a small, darkened rectangular gallery."</TE>
<TE>   What Atkins saw was a floor covered with sandy powder on one end
with a film projector casting grainy black-and-white images of
beaches and rocks on a wall. Live and recorded voices solemnly
chanted questions. Cha appears in front of the photographed images,
sitting meditatively, then dragging ropes tied to rocks with labels
such as "Redemption," "Forbidden" and "Abandoned" stenciled on them.</TE>
<TE>   Cha moved to New York in 1980, when she began working on her
unfinished film "White Dust From Mongolia." The Beall exhibition
provides extensive documentation of the work.</TE>
<TE>   In May 1982, she married photographer Richard Barnes. On Nov. 5
that year, she was on her way to meet Barnes in lower Manhattan at a
photo shoot at the Puck Building. But she never saw him. She was
raped and strangled by a security guard who worked there. He was
convicted, appealed, retried and convicted again in a case that was
drawn out for years.</TE>
<TE>   Some scholars say one of Cha's most important works came out
posthumously. A journal-style autobiographical book, "Dictee," was
published a few weeks after she was murdered. It is written in three
languages, and combines family history, stories of female martyrdom,
poetry and photographs. It was key in establishing Cha's reputation,
Min said.</TE>
<TE>   Now she is studied in university programs in linguistics at UC
Berkeley, art history at Hong-ik University in Seoul, film at
Claremont's Scripps College, women's studies at Portland State
University in Oregon, English at Temple University in Philadelphia,
English at the University of South Carolina and literature at Duke
University in North Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   "Her work became very influential after her death," Min said,
adding that Cha was highly prolific in the last 10 years of her life.</TE>
<TE>   "People appreciate her for her use of language, but as an artist
she was an incredibly rigorous, very detailed and thorough in
conveying ideas in her work. She was very demanding of herself, and
that level of strength can be seen in her work."</TE>

<LD>Sean Penn self-righteously accuses filmmakers outside his group of
aging Peter Pan clones of using their talents (presumably as well as
they can) to create films that make people feel better about
themselves, their future or to make them laugh--in short, to feel
good. He calls them liars ("Don't Get Him Started," by Rachel
Abramowitz, Jan. 6).</LD>
<LD>   He accepts large sums of money for work he apparently regards as
the best of a bad lot in order to maintain a lifestyle of the
"compound north of San Francisco" level, I assume, because he wants
himself and his family to feel good. This is integrity?</LD>
<LD>   Just because he likes to complain about movies he doesn't have the
technical skills, strong enough story lines or depth of talent to
make does not qualify as integrity, no matter how good he may be in
the somewhat limited niche he occupies.</LD>
<TE>   The filmmakers of the golden age were artistic adults who knew
that true creativity must eventually produce some form of new life,
and new life brings hope, and hope feels good.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately it comes down to the old joke "dying is easy, comedy is
hard," and underneath the multiple layers of rebellious filmmaker
hyperbole, we all know it.</TE>

<LD>After reading Stephen Farber's piece about the lack of a
quintessentially American movie this season, one immediately came to
mind ("In Search of a Truly American Film," Jan. 6). Although not a
current release, Philip Kaufman's "The Right Stuff" is about as close
as you can get.</LD>
<LD>   The story of the waning days of the jet age and the dawning of the
space age absolutely bubbles over with American-ness: the "root
weevils" of the press who provide the essential coverage to support
the funding decisions of the paranoid and opportunistic politicians
(no bucks, no Buck Rogers); the ambitious expatriate German rocket
scientists eager to prove the superiority of their uber-missiles
(because our Germans are better than their Germans); and the even
more ambitious adrenaline junkies known as test pilots who want to
get to the top of that pyramid (and have a good time doing it).</LD>
<TE>   What makes it most American, however, is that, all of the basic
human silliness aside, such a disparate group of individuals could
work together to achieve things that were only the wildest of dreams.
Kaufman shows us the human comedy, but he also shows us the two
things that make this possibly the quintessential American film: the
unique courage the astronauts displayed in climbing on top of angry
rockets to risk ghastly public death in pursuit of something much
greater than fame and fortune, and the countless people who gave
everything they had to get them into space and back.</TE>
<TE>   America, at its best, is about individuals of all types uniting to
do the Big Thing, to pull off the impossible. "The Right Stuff" is a
chronicle of one of those stellar times.</TE>

<LD>It's unfortunate that Aaron Landy, who makes some valid points about
media conglomerates and corporate advertising (Letters, Jan. 6), has
undermined his basic argument by lashing the critique to his stinging
opinion of "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring."</LD>
<LD>   If major corporations producing film franchises is "to culture
what chainsaws are to rain forests," as Landy asserts, then "The Lord
of the Rings" is that rarest of accomplishments: a brilliant
adaptation of what is arguably the literary masterpiece of the 20th
century and a project that could not possibly have been made with the
requisite sense of grandeur had it not had the wealth of corporations
behind it.</LD>
<LD>   It's possible greed was the motivating factor in getting the
trilogy green-lighted, but there can be little doubt that the
resulting films are the product of deep commitment and passion on the
part of everyone from director Peter Jackson and his magnificent cast
to the costumers, art department and, I suspect, even the grips.</LD>
<TE>   There is nothing inherently evil about epic filmmaking. When done
correctly, it creates the sort of magic that is the reason most of us
go to the movies. "The Fellowship of the Ring" is just such a film,
and, because its sequels were made simultaneously, a risky move
financially but a brilliant move from an artistic standpoint, I have
little reason to believe that "The Two Towers" or "The Return of the
King" will disappoint.</TE>
<TE>   Isn't it just possible that Kenneth Turan named "Fellowship" as
his top film of the year not because he was "bought" but rather
because he genuinely recognized it as a magical film that has finally
done justice to the genre of epic fantasy? From where I sit, it's not
only the best film of the year, but the best film I've seen in the
past decade. And nobody paid me a dime to write that.</TE>
<TE>   ALAN SANBORN</TE>
<TE>   Northridge</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So Aaron Landy found it disheartening that Kenneth Turan would
rank "The Lord of the Rings" as the best film of 2001?</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly, he never says why, other than proclaiming the movie
"dreck." Apparently, additional endorsements of the film by
respectable film critics were not cause for him to even momentarily
consider the possibility that they might all be responding to
something genuine. No, this critical collusion instead led Landy to
conclude that the writers are all corrupt. (Are all the others, not
cited, who loved the film also on the AOL Time Warner teat?)</TE>
<TE>   Landy forgets that Turan, painted in his unfocused tirade as
little more than a studio shill, was no friend of "Titanic," the
biggest financial blockbuster of them all. He ranked "Ratcatcher," a
Scottish film that barely saw the light of an American projector
bulb, as his top pick of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Strangely enough, Landy fails to note that the nearly unanimous
mediocre-to-negative reviews received by the recent "Harry Potter and
the Sorcerer's Stone" (including Turan's) did nothing to ensure that
movie's box office doom.</TE>
<TE>   DENNIS COZZALIO</TE>
<TE>   Glendale</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Having seen and thoroughly enjoyed "The Lord of The Rings," I had
some interest in reading Landy's letter. He wants to warn us of the
horrors of this film, which he describes as "dreck," but I was
confused.</TE>
<TE>   Does he critique the acting? No. What about the directing? No.
Maybe the writing? Again, no. Cinematography? No. In fact, Landy does
not fault anything at all associated with filmmaking. His beef is
with the ads and previews shown in front of the feature presentation.
What has one to do with the other?</TE>
<TE>   One is purely a marketing tool, while the other is the artistic
endeavor we paid to see. Is there anyone who does not know the
difference, and separation, of the two? There seems to be a movement
to end the practice of placing ads ahead of feature films, but
filmmakers should not be criticized for a distributor or studio
decision.</TE>
<TE>   Because Landy describes himself as a filmmaker, I sincerely hope
that any reviewer of his endeavors focuses on his work and not on the
marketing.</TE>
<TE>   MARK HARTZELL</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I completely agree with Landy. He is totally on target when he
says "an epidemic of monopolized culture is wiping out the arts
before our very eyes and nobody is talking."</TE>
<TE>   I have noticed for a long time the decline in the presentation of
movies and of the excessive abuse of advertisement imposed by theater
owners on a captive audience.</TE>

<DH>Inbal Dance Theater has a melting-pot style reflecting its
roots in ancient and modern Israel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICTORIA LOOSELEAF</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To Ilana Cohen, artistic director of Israel's oldest dance company,
Inbal Dance Theater, art, like life, is something that is "evolving
all the time." Having joined Inbal in 1963, 14 years after Sara
Levi-Tanai founded the troupe known for incorporating biblical themes
and an ancient dance language into modern dance moves, it is safe to
say that the Israeli-born Cohen has virtually grown up with the
group. At age 58, she is still dancing, still committed, she says, to
the notion that art as a way of life is also a way to promote
cross-cultural understanding.</LD>
<LD>   Cohen is intent on bringing that message with her as Inbal embarks
on a six-city, monthlong tour of the United States, with stops
including San Diego, Miami, Houston and Los Angeles. In its first
visit to the States since 1987, and its first to L.A. since 1973,
Inbal lands at the Skirball Cultural Center this week to participate
in a unique dance partnership with the Sherman Oaks-based,
American-Israeli Keshet Chaim Dance Ensemble.</LD>
<TE>   Titled "Shared Roots," the project (sponsored by the Skirball, the
Tel Aviv Los Angeles Partnership committee  of the Jewish Federation
and the city of L.A.) includes a series of workshops for Jewish and
non-Jewish students, a public lecture-demonstration by Inbal and a
dance workshop for educators led by New Yorker Ruth Goodman. In
addition, Keshet Chaim and Inbal (the name means cymbal or the
clapper of a bell) will work together, exchanging dances and creating
a joint work to end the series of public performances, highlighted by
each company's repertory, to be held at the University of Judaism on
Saturday and next Sunday. In turn, Keshet Chaim will tour Israel in
July with a series of performances, workshops and collaborations.</TE>
<TE>   Genie Benson, managing director of Keshet Chaim and a dancer with
that troupe, says a partnership was initially suggested in November
2000 by an Inbal board member. By May 2001, discussions were underway
to fund an exchange program for four or six dancers from each
company.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't want to have to pick and choose dancers," says Benson,
whose company numbers 26, "so we helped create a tour for Inbal,
hooking [L.A.] into it, which was also a way to help bring about the
residency."</TE>
<TE>   Picking a handful of dancers to bring to Los Angeles would, no
doubt, not have suited Cohen either. She is now able to bring all of
her 18 dancers.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen was Levi-Tanai's assistant for many years before taking the
helm at Inbal five years ago, although it has only been in the last
year that Levi-Tanai, now in her 90s, stopped attending rehearsals
because of ill health. Speaking from Houston through an interpreter,
Cohen recalled the changes in the company over the decades.</TE>
<TE>   "In the very beginning of Inbal, [the dancers] were strictly
descendants of Yemen--Jews who arrived in Israel from Yemen, with
dances strictly from Yemen. The word 'folk dancing' is very tricky
here. Even Sara didn't start with 'folk dancing,' but took movements
from folk and gave them her interpretation--taking subjects that are
biblical and developing on them a unique movement language." The
company adds balletic plies and leaps, for example, to more
traditional elements such as deep squats and indigenous music.</TE>
<TE>   "The generation after I joined the company," Cohen continues,
"Jews also came from Spain or from other North African descendants.
We even had a couple of Americans who joined the group. In the 1980s,
the changes [really] started--with the dancers and with the
acceptance of other cultures. Israel is a melting pot, and you have
Jews who came from all over the world. My dance group has been
inspired from [these] different elements, although the core of the
movement language is influenced originally from the Yemenite--this
core you can still see throughout our show."</TE>
<TE>   Cohen is referring to "The Story of Ruth" and "Sajarra," which are
being performed on the tour. The former depicts the biblical saga of
the widowed Ruth and her mother-in-law, Naomi, and the latter is an
exploration of changing traditions and the generation gap. Cohen
notes, "Although they are apart by years, you'll find the same
language of Inbal in both of them. My own choreography is reflecting
the next language of Inbal."</TE>
<TE>   Of "The Story of Ruth," the Jerusalem Post has written, "[It] is
not a folk dance nor even ethnic dance. It is art dance ... created
with genius." Another Israeli critic called "Sajarra," which means
twig, "one of Cohen's finest works."</TE>
<TE>   Cohen, whose choreography for Inbal dates to 1982, ascribes some
of the company's artistic growth to the fact that dancers today are
more technically capable, allowing, she says, for a more elaborate
movement language. In addition, although most of the dancers hail
from Israel, there are dancers from Russia and Libya, with Inbal also
boasting an Arab-Israeli member.</TE>
<TE>   "In the early days, the dancers weren't necessarily those with
more technique or education in dancing. They had a soul, a neshama.
It's what you are and what you have. In Hebrew, the root can also
mean breath--to breathe," Cohen adds. "What is significant throughout
the last 50 years is the connection between your soul and your body.
[It is] not only somebody who is moving through space; rather there
is an inner meaning or connection between your movement and your
soul."</TE>
<TE>   A connection is what Cohen also hopes to accomplish with "Shared
Roots"--that people will be able to see how art can connect various
cultures. "I present a lot of cultures and I [want] to demonstrate
how art can bring not only various diasporas of people together, but
also countries. Even Israel is still evolving, and Inbal is looking
for a way to express a culture that will present Israel in a true
way. Inbal is like a mirror or reflection of all the societies or
cultures in Israel."</TE>
<TE>   Eytan Avisar, 57, agrees. Born in Morocco and raised in Israel,
Avisar emigrated in 1972 to Los Angeles, where he founded Keshet
Chaim (rainbow of life) 11 years later. He suggests that a good way
to see the mosaic of Israeli dance will be Inbal's public lecture, in
which the company will demonstrate ethnic dances from, among others,
Kurdish and Persian communities. Avisar hopes too that the exchange
program will ultimately be a way to help keep Jewish dance alive.</TE>
<TE>   The Inbal tour took shape before the events of Sept. 11. Some
tours were canceled in the wake of the attacks, but Cohen, who lost a
brother to a terrorist act in Israel two years ago, is passionate
about the artist's obligation to perform, especially in such
situations.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a big, big sorrow to be in Israel and watch New York that
day. The pain was so tremendous [and] the feeling of participating in
others' sorrow was so immense. You couldn't find one person who
didn't shed tears, mostly because Israelis feel that on a daily
basis. It's not only that we wouldn't consider not coming--in spite
of that, we have to come. We must come. You have to go on. It's a
means of support that I will show by coming."</TE>

<DH>With 'Rose Red,' Stephen King creates the ultimate haunted
abode in what may be one of his last forays into our fears.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIM MURPHY</AU>
<BD>Time Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>A house, author Stephen King muses, is a place of shelter. "It's the
body we put over our bodies. As our bodies grow old, so do our
houses. As our bodies sicken, so do our houses." Then he wonders (and
the trouble always seems to start when King begins wondering): What
happens if mad people live inside a house? Does their madness creep
into the walls, the corridors, the very boards? "Isn't that in large
part what we mean when we say a place isn't quiet?" he writes. "We
say 'haunted.' But we mean the house has gone insane." Cut to a low,
looming shot of a house that just this morning looked friendly enough
and now, tangled in vines and a cold, rolling mist, stuck under a low
moon with a bunch of scared people inside, looks like it has
completely gone out of its mind.</LD>
<TE>   In "Rose Red," the ABC miniseries starting tonight, Stephen King,
the master of horror who has made a career out of everything from
ghost-infested hotels to man-eating plants to the devil himself,
takes on the defining metaphor of the genre, the granddaddy of all
spook generators, the haunted house. Airing over six hours tonight,
Monday and Thursday, "Rose Red" explores themes of fear and
obsession, of what happens when a dwelling (and the mandatory
associated turrets, gables, endless halls and dank back stairways) is
inhabited, and finally corrupted, by the passion, betrayal and
disappointment of those, living and not, who walk their corridors.</TE>
<TE>   In true King form, "Rose Red" also delivers, along with ethereal
glows in dark windows and closet doors that won't stay closed, plenty
of honest-to-goodness, tentacle-fingered spooks, fanged rats and
lunging, bloody hands--all with a dark, drippy "Twin Peaks" ambience
that Seattle, the setting for "Rose Red," seems born to deliver. For
those who demand technology with their poltergeists, Oscar-winning
visual effects supervisor Stuart Robertson (who helped create heaven
in 1998's "What Dreams May Come") helps director Craig R. Baxley
imagine with stunning precision what would happen if, say, a woman
who died in 1950 decided she wanted to scare the bejesus out of
somebody half a century later by looming out of a mirror, or if
somebody running away from a garden statue made the mistake of
turning back to look?</TE>
<TE>   But 21st century, computer-generated ghosts were not the point.
Not for King, and not for co-executive producer Mark Carliner, who
earlier teamed with King, Baxley, producer Thomas H. Brodek and
production designer Craig Stearns for the 1999 King miniseries "Storm
of the Century." "'Rose Red' is a fairy tale for grown-ups," Carliner
said. Not the Disney version of fairy tales, he hastens to add. The
other kind. The kind in which the woman in the forest just might put
Hansel and Gretel in her pot, or the shape greeting Little Red Riding
Hood from under the covers isn't Grandma. Think the brothers Grimm,
who penned the story of Snow White and her sister, Rose Red, that
King, subconsciously, Carliner believes, used as a name for his house
from hell.</TE>
<TE>   "Stephen King uses all the metaphors, all of the symbols in this
story: the evil spirit, the wicked witch, the doppelganger. What
makes Stephen King the world's best-selling author is he has truly
found a path into the collective unconscious," Carliner says. "All of
the essential ingredients of Grimm are the basic material. If you
think about it, Alice fell through a hole and ended up in Wonderland.
Our [characters], once they find they're trapped in Rose Red, they're
in kind of a weird and wicked wonderland."</TE>
<TE>   King, who returned to "Rose Red" as his first fiction project
after the June 1999 car accident that nearly killed him, must have
seen it as something of a swan song. Speaking over the holidays, as
his grandkids gathered around him at the King homestead in Maine, he
said he intends "Rose Red" to be one of his last horror projects, at
least, of the kind he's willing to publish. "When you get done, you
get done," he said simply.</TE>
<TE>   So a haunted house, a house with a mind of its own, that was
mandatory. For King, it was always mainly the house. He imagined a
house "that was bigger on the inside than on the outside. A house you
could get lost in." Hollywood, of course, has never wanted for
haunted house movies, from early classics such as James Whale's "The
Old Dark House" (1932) to the ill-advised 1999 remake of "The House
on Haunted Hill."</TE>
<TE>   What brought King to the table initially was Steven Spielberg, who
a few years ago approached King about working with him on a haunted
house project.</TE>
<TE>   "He called me up and said, 'I want to make the scariest ghost
story ever made,'" King recalls. "Then he told me his ghost
story--he's got one, and from the way he tells it, you get the idea
that he's told it at a lot of parties over the years--and I told him
mine, which is not anywhere near as good as his."</TE>
<TE>   (For the record, King's only real-life ghost story dates to a
Democratic Party fund-raiser years ago at a house in Bangor, Maine.
King went to the upstairs bedroom early to fetch his coat. "I'm bent
over the coats, and I'm rummaging through them, and I'm aware there's
a man sitting against the wall. An old man, tan, bald head, pinstripe
suit, red tie--I'm seeing everything. He's watching me, I mean, I got
the idea very clearly that he thinks I'm rifling through the coats
looking for something to steal. I said, 'Isn't it funny you can never
find your own coat?' I look up, and there's nobody there." Like most
ghost stories outside Hollywood, that's about the end of it. King
finds the coat, leaves the room alive.)</TE>
<TE>   After the you-show-me-your-ghost-story-and-I'll-show-you-mine
exchange, the two men settled on the 1957 Shirley Jackson novel "The
Haunting of Hill House," in which a researcher gathers a group of
psychics at an old house in an attempt to prove the existence of the
supernatural, as a point of departure. Both saw Robert Wise's 1963
film of the book, "The Haunting," as a benchmark of cinematic house
horror.</TE>
<TE>   But as the writing got under way, there was a parting of the ways:
Spielberg saw ghost stories one way, King saw them another. Spielberg
ended up at DreamWorks shepherding the 1999 remake of "The Haunting,"
starring Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta-Jones and produced and
directed by Jan De Bont ("Speed" and "Twister"). King did "Rose Red."
Both projects, like Jackson's novel, start with the idea of a house
that's gone bad. They feature an ensemble of characters (in "Rose
Red," they're psychics, in "The Haunting" remake, insomniacs) who
gather at the bad house and have the effect of stirring up the
house's worst traits.</TE>
<TE>   Spielberg had gone along with King's idea to use the Winchester
Mystery House in San Jose as a source of inspiration: a house built
room by room over decades by the heiress to the Winchester rifle
fortune, who was told by a psychic she'd die if the house was ever
finished. The main difference that emerged, as King tells it, was not
over the house, but over how the characters would confront the ghosts
inside it. "It went back and forth between us, and it became a kind
of struggle for the soul of this movie," King says. "In what he
wanted, there was a feeling, almost a kind of sense of derring-do. An
'Indiana Jones' kind of thing that I didn't really want in there.
Steven wanted these people to be heroic. I just wanted them to be
terrified."</TE>
<TE>   If the star was the house, the house had to be the first part
cast. After considering some of the grandest and spookiest houses in
America, the production team settled on Thornewood Castle, a
rambling, 27,000-square-foot Tudor Gothic mansion on the shores of
American Lake, south of Tacoma. The house had medieval stained glass
windows, gardens designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, the architect of
Central Park, and 12 chimneys. It also had an important quality in
King's mind. On a sunny morning, with the birds chirping in the
garden, the house has a warm, even cheerful feeling. But you wouldn't
necessarily want to be there on a moonless night.</TE>
<TE>   The stories of Thornewood Castle and Rose Red bear a remarkable
similarity. In King's screenplay, Rose Red is built in 1906 by
fictional Seattle oil magnate John Rimbauer as a home for his young
new wife, Ellen. Thornewood was built in 1909 by financial tycoon
Chester Thorne for his young wife, Anna. There is even a shared
legacy of tragedy: Thorne's young son died in Egypt, and there was a
suicide in a gun closet off a downstairs bathroom. The "Rose Red"
crew contracted with the present owners of Thornewood, now a
bed-and-breakfast, to pay for and oversee a massive $500,000
remodeling project to restore the house as closely as possible to the
original blueprints. Then, exteriors and some scenes--taking place in
the massive billiard room and two bedrooms--were filmed at the Tacoma
mansion.</TE>
<TE>   But even at 27,000 square feet, Thornewood wasn't big enough, not
for King's vision of a house that Ellen Rimbauer expanded
continuously until she disappeared in it in 1950--after which the
house kept growing, seemingly on its own, to sprawl over 133,000
square feet. Thornewood's interiors are huge, but not massively,
mind-numbingly huge. For that, the crew leased a series of large
abandoned hangars at the former Sandpoint Naval Station on the shores
of Lake Washington in Seattle. Inside the largest of them, Stearns
fashioned a cavernous great hall with fireplace, to King's
specification, "big enough to cook a moose in," carved columns,
sweeping staircase, dining hall and a doorway opening out to the
spooky solarium that is a trademark of all three "Haunting"-inspired
productions.</TE>
<TE>   So intertwined and intricately detailed are the sets that to walk
through them is to imagine oneself in the middle of King's
architectural nightmare. In Jackson's novel, Hill House's very
construction is part of what makes the house so easy to get lost
in--angles aren't true; lines aren't straight; the combination of so
many small fluctuations produces a huge distortion in the house
itself.</TE>
<TE>   In King's screenplay, the house perpetually adds to itself. It
gives birth to new dark chambers. Hallways that used to go one place
end up going someplace else. It is no surprise that over the years,
many visitors have simply disappeared. A key part of King's vision
was putting Rose Red right in the middle of downtown Seattle--near
what would today be 6th Avenue and Spring Street. No lonely house on
a hill, here, nor an isolated hotel like the one in "The Shining,"
cut off from civilization--and potential rescue--by a long snowy
road.</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted people trapped in a house right in the middle of the
city," Stearns says. "The idea that you look out the windows and see
the freeways, but you're still trapped in the house and there's
nothing you can do about it."</TE>
<TE>   In trademark King style, some of the characters in the house end
up loonier than the ghosts. That was part of the appeal for director
Baxley, who felt he'd been pigeonholed as an action director with
films such as "Action Jackson" (1988) and "Under Pressure" (1997). "I
wanted to stay away from the blood, the gore, the usual elements that
you would find in this genre," Baxley said. "What's unseen, what's
left to the imagination, is certainly more horrific and more
terrifying. We tried to make it a cinematic, stylish movie, and yet
be concerned with the characters. I didn't want to let the characters
get bigger than life. I wanted to keep them basically grounded in
reality. Make them real people."</TE>
<TE>   The cast is led by actress Nancy Travis (whose credits include
"Three Men and a Baby" and the short-lived TV series "Almost
Perfect") as Dr. Joyce Reardon, a paranormal psychologist who leads a
team of psychics to Rose Red in hopes of restoring her foundering
professional reputation with proof of supernatural phenomena.</TE>
<TE>   To lure them there, Reardon offers them $5,000 and her assurance
that the house has essentially been a "dead cell" since at least
1995, when its last victim disappeared. Rather quickly, the visitors,
played by Matt Keeslar (who plays the last surviving Rimbauer),
Kimberly Brown, Judith Ivey, Melanie Lynskey, Matt Ross, Julian
Sands, Kevin Tighe and Emily Deschanel, discover that Reardon's
assurances are less than reliable.</TE>
<TE>   As the history of the obsession of Ellen Rimbauer (played by Julia
Campbell) over the construction of Rose Red unfolds, so do the
stories of other obsessions: of psychology department chief professor
Miller (played by the late David Dukes, who died on a tennis court
the night before he was to film his death scene but whose part was
salvaged with the use of a death mask created earlier), bent on
discrediting Reardon; and ultimately, Reardon herself, who is
supposed to be the responsible adult in the party but who, by the end
of the third night, chillingly, isn't. Far scarier than the ghoulish
souls who periodically loom up in empty doorways is the realization
that the only person denying that there are ghosts around is off her
rocker.</TE>
<TE>   As the 1999 remake of "The Haunting" did, King and company's "Rose
Red" abandons the eerie black-and-white imagery, stark camera angles
and frightening hear-but-don't-show specters of the Robert Wise
classic--specters that may, after all, have been within the
supercharged psychic brains of Hill House's inhabitants. These ghosts
walk, talk and menace, thanks to elaborate, state-of-the-art,
computer-operated puppets created by Steve Johnson's XFX of Sun
Valley at an estimated cost of $150,000 apiece. Overall, the budget
came in at roughly $35 million, perhaps half of what the DreamWorks
feature film cost, partly because of inherent savings in special
effects for video, but mostly, Carliner says, because of the lack of
stars.</TE>
<TE>   "But I insisted that we get enough money to make the picture that
Steve sees in his head. And it worked. When Steve came out here and
walked on the set, he was like a kid. His eyes! He went out and
bought a camera so he could take pictures of it," Carliner says. "You
know, that's the reason Steve does it. It's not for the money. He
does it because it's fun."</TE>
<TE>   Fun--eclipsed by months of bone-searing pain--is what King
remembers of the latter development of "Rose Red," after a Dodge
minivan plowed into him as he walked along a road near his lake house
in western Maine.</TE>
<TE>   "On Friday, we had the big conversation, and he said, 'Call ABC
and tell 'em we'll do it,'" Carliner recalls. "And they said call
Craig Baxley and we were all going to get together and talk about it
on Monday. And then on Saturday he was hit. And then for six months
it was, 'Is he going to live?'"</TE>
<TE>   King started converting "Rose Red" from movie script to miniseries
as soon as he emerged from the haze and finished his nonfiction
memoir, "On Writing." "I was using the work as dope, basically,
because it worked better than anything they were giving me to kill
the pain," he said. "It was very difficult to push the pen 45 minutes
a day, but it was vital to get back to work, because you have to
break the ice somehow. You have to say, 'This is what I do.' I'm
either going to continue to work, or I'm not. You say, 'If I can do
this, maybe I can walk. If I can walk, maybe I can resume some kind
of human intercourse.' Work seemed like a logical place to start."</TE>
<TE>   So he worked. He got the script back from Warner Bros. (bought
there on Spielberg's behalf) and decided to retool it into a
miniseries. For a novelist, that was the best part, he says: turning
two hours into six. "My problem with scripts has never been not being
able to find enough material. My problem is getting 'em down to a
shootable length."</TE>
<TE>   But King these days is no longer a man with four or five new
horror novels knocking around in the back of his head--at least, not
that he plans to offer up for public consumption. "Rose Red" may be
the end of an era, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Like an accountant, King, 54, tallies the next projects he has
coming out: a book of short stories, due in March. Then in the fall,
the long-delayed novel "From a Buick Eight," postponed because it
involves a car accident and didn't seem appropriate before. The last
three novels in the "Dark Tower" series, to be completed in the
coming year. A limited series about a haunted hospital for ABC. "Then
that's it. I'm done," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Done what?</TE>
<TE>   "Done writing books." Or, at least, publishing books. (King can't
answer to what urges he'll give in to in private.) "You get to a
point where you get to the edges of a room, and you can go back and
go where you've been, and basically recycle stuff," he says. "I've
seen it in my own work. People when they read 'Buick Eight' are going
to think 'Christine.' It's about a car that's not normal, OK? You
say, 'I've said the things that I have to say, that are new and fresh
and interesting to people.' Then you have a choice. You can either
continue to go on, or say I left when I was still on top of my game.
I left when I was still holding the ball, instead of it holding me.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to finish up like Harold Robbins," King says of the
best-selling pulp novelist who, despite diminishing commercial
success, wrote into his 80s, even after suffering aphasia from a
stroke. Robbins died in 1997. "That's my nightmare." And you thought
it was a bogeyman in a closet.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Rose Red" airs tonight, Monday and Thursday at 9 on ABC. The
network has rated the first part TV-14 and the second two parts
TV-14V (may be unsuitable for young children).</TE>

<DH>It's time for developers of pedestrian retail 'experiences'
to face up to new urban realities. Reinvention, not nostalgia, is
needed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF</AU>
<BD>Times Architecture Critic</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The pedestrian shopping experience" has long been a particularly
gruesome feature of the American landscape. But in Los Angeles, such
developments are now spreading with the ferocity of an urban plague.</LD>
<LD>   Last fall, TrizecHahn, one of the country's biggest developers,
opened two new pedestrian malls: the flashy Hollywood &amp; Highland
complex along Hollywood Boulevard, and Paseo Colorado in Pasadena--an
ersatz Mission-style shopping district.</LD>
<LD>   In March, Caruso Affiliated Holdings will unveil the Grove at
Farmers Market on Third Street near Fairfax Avenue--a
650,000-square-foot, pseudo-traditional complex that will dwarf the
historic Farmers Market next door. The first phase of the proposed
770,000-square-foot Sunset Millennium retail and residential
development--which includes a pedestrian bridge that will span La
Cienega Boulevard--is under construction along Sunset Boulevard. And
the Mission-inspired West Hollywood Gateway is scheduled to open in
late 2003 at Santa Monica Boulevard and La Brea Avenue.</LD>
<TE>   In short, pedestrian "shopping experiences" are replacing the
traditional mall as a retail destination, and they are becoming a
central feature of L.A.'s urban experience--the 21st century's answer
to Main Street.</TE>
<TE>   That has spawned a growing debate about their impact. Opponents
have fought to scale back these projects, which they argue are
gargantuan, bottle up traffic and contribute to congestion.
Developers, eager to appease criticism and suck in more consumers,
argue that such pedestrian-friendly projects are a significant
improvement over the enclosed, hulking concrete structures that were
once the norm.</TE>
<TE>   The point, however, is that such mega-developments will not go
away. They are a logical outcome of the new global economy. And so
their problem lies in their dishonesty--not in their scale. Decorated
in saccharine images of the past, promising a kind of genuine urban
contact that they never deliver, they are the product of a culture
that equates marketing hype with truth. As such, the solution is not
a return to the past, but to create an architecture more firmly
rooted in present realities. And that would take a development
community willing to take some risk and commit to a higher degree of
creative intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   The notion of the pedestrian mall came to prominence in the 1970s,
when developers began to transform existing historic districts into
shopping complexes. Projects like San Francisco's Cannery development
in 1968 and Boston's Faneuil Hall in 1976--both housed in historic
brick structures--were championed as viable urban alternatives to the
traditional, enclosed suburban mall. The fact that they were still
glorified malls seemed beside the point. They were prettier than the
old concrete boxes.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, developers quickly ran out of historic buildings to
reconfigure, and they began searching for a new formula. The
breakthrough was the opening of San Diego's Horton Plaza in 1985.
Designed by the L.A.-based Jerde Partnership, Horton Plaza included
the usual combination of cinemas, retail chains and restaurants, but
set them around a central pedestrian street that tied into the
surrounding urban grid. The idea was to replicate the "feel" of a
real city, with its mix of architectural styles and sense of
congestion.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, that formula has become the norm among retail
developers. The worst of these clones are smothered in a veneer of
nostalgia--adding a layer of falsity that even Jerde's Horton Plaza
was careful to avoid. At the Grove, for example, tenants such as
Nordstrom and FAO Schwarz will be set along a brick-paved pedestrian
street that features a wrought iron bridge and ornate fountain that
evoke the kind of traditional city you see in animated Disney films.
In a gesture that has no small measure of irony, a trolley will run
along the street, a tribute to L.A.'s famed red cars, which were
dismantled during the 1950s, the last time the city had a viable
public transportation system.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, TrizecHahn's Hollywood &amp; Highland development seeks
to tap into surrounding Hollywood lore. Its circular pedestrian court
is decorated with massive columns and a portal copied from D.W.
Griffith's film "Intolerance." Jerde's West Hollywood Gateway,
meanwhile, is an even more predictable collage of abstract modern
forms with pseudo-Spanish flourishes.</TE>
<TE>   Such a slavish adherence to "contextualism" is often supported by
local review boards, which see it as a way of preserving a
community's character.</TE>
<TE>   But tinkering with cosmetic details is no real solution. When you
dig deeper, the underlying formula remains essentially the same. The
collage of images and superficial architectural styles cannot
disguise the monolithic scale. The so-called pedestrian streets are
in fact privately owned corporate zones, manipulated to keep you
focused on shopping and cleansed of unwanted distractions.</TE>
<TE>   To some, the answer is to return to the fine-grained urban fabric
of the historic city--the mix of small-scale businesses, busy
sidewalks and brick-clad buildings that has traditionally formed the
foundation of healthy urban life.</TE>
<TE>   The nostalgia such an attitude implies reveals a fundamental
misreading of Los Angeles' urban fabric. Sprawling and centerless,
the city is a surreal blend of urban and suburban forms. It already
accommodates a gamut of scales, from the fine-grained to the generic.
The addition of a new scale of development will not single-handedly
threaten its vitality.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood Boulevard is a case in point. That the scale of the
TrizecHahn development has transformed the strip between La Brea and
Highland is undeniable. What was once a seedy stretch is now a vast
tourist trap, ablaze in neon and video screens.</TE>
<TE>   The project's effect on the surrounding urban fabric is less
clear. A few blocks east, the blaze of light and commerce fades.
Costume shops, nightclubs, coffee shops and book stores replace the
Gap, Tommy Hilfiger and Banana Republic.</TE>
<TE>   The tension between these conflicting scales--the generic world of
corporate America and the fine-grained world of the independent,
idiosyncratic entrepreneur--will add to the boulevard's urban
complexity, and potentially save it from becoming a sterile tourist
zone, devoid of any human dimension.</TE>
<TE>   So the solution is not to eradicate the mall, but to reinvent it.</TE>
<TE>   With their faux public streets, cut off from the surrounding
cityscape and cloaked in a veneer of nostalgia, projects such as the
Grove contribute nothing of value to the public realm. The
assumption--a cynical one--is that a public starved for urban contact
will accept this theme-park version of reality as an adequate
substitute for the real thing.</TE>
<TE>   Such projects can make a drab, conventional mall like the Beverly
Center, opened in 1982, look good by comparison. Designed by Welton
Becket &amp; Associates, the center's hulking form--with its three floors
of shops, stacked on top of parking and wrapped in a streamlined
concrete skin--has often been compared to a beached whale.
Nonetheless, the design also has a clarity that can almost seem
refreshing by today's standards. Despite its limited architectural
ambitions, it is what the Modernists once referred to as an honest
building, a design that reflects its age and values.</TE>
<TE>   There are better options, however, than returning to such bland
precedents.</TE>
<TE>   In Europe and Asia, increasing numbers of architects are
reexamining the role of shopping in the post-industrial age. Daniel
Libeskind's planned 1.61-million-square-foot Westside mall in Bern,
Switzerland; Zaha Hadid's recently unveiled master plan for a
21-million-square-foot mixed-use development in Singapore; Coop
Himmelblau's proposed entertainment center in Guadalajara,
Mexico--such designs aggressively explore the clash between public
and private realms that is an inescapable aspect of the contemporary
urban condition.</TE>
<TE>   Stripped of nostalgic references, their dynamic, fragmented forms
are also honest representations of the contemporary condition. Such
work would fit neatly into L.A.'s best architectural traditions--its
ambivalence about the past, its ethos as a place of radical
experimentation pointed aggressively toward the future. Instead, the
conventional developer continues to recycle worn-out ideas, terrified
of taking risks with increasingly large sums of money. Even Jane
Jacobs, an ardent preservationist, understood how deadly such
formulas can become. "Cities," she wrote more than 40 years ago, "are
an immense laboratory of trial and error, failure and success."
Without that spirit of invention, Los Angeles is doomed to suffer
more blows such as these.</TE>

<DH>A MacArthur fellowship bestows something new upon David
Wilson's Museum of Jurassic Technology: a more secure future.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PAGEL</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three months ago, David Wilson's cell phone rang in the middle of a
meeting at his one-of-a-kind establishment, the Museum of Jurassic
Technology. He was talking planning with Kelly Coyne, the museum's
administrative director.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a pretty down period, and we were trying to figure out how
we were going to get through November," he says. "Financially, every
month is a juggling act. We get to places where we're OK for two or
three months but then it goes back to week-to-week.</LD>
<LD>   "I got a call and I didn't recognize the number. I wasn't in the
best of moods and I said to myself, 'Do I want to take this?' And
then this guy, Dan Socolow, comes on and identifies himself as the
director of the MacArthur Fellows Program.</LD>
<TE>   "The first thing he asks is 'Are you alone?' and then 'Can you get
alone?' So I went into the other room. He asked if I had ever known a
MacArthur fellow, and I answered, 'I guess I know some.' When he
said, 'Well, you know one better than you think you do,' I still
didn't have any idea of what he was leading up to. I thought he was
going to invite me to nominate someone. And then he broke the news."</TE>
<TE>   Along with 22 others, Wilson had been named to the 2001 class of
MacArthur fellows. He had gotten a "genius" grant, $500,000 out of
the clear blue.</TE>
<TE>   No stranger to the mysteries of the universe, Wilson is also
familiar with the power of understatement. Pocketing his phone, he
wrote a note to Coyne: "I think," he scribbled, "things are going to
be a little bit better next month."</TE>
<TE>   In 1981, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation started
giving money to artists and thinkers, scientists and dreamers, none
of whom had asked for it. Every year since then, 20 to 40
individuals, in fields that range from music to molecular biology,
architecture to agriculture, and poetry to primatology, get the same
sort of call that interrupted Wilson on Oct. 18.</TE>
<TE>   No applications are submitted (nominations are made and championed
via a series of confidential recommendations), and no strings are
attached. There are no restrictions on becoming a fellow, except that
nominees must be residents or citizens of the United States. The
$500,000 grant (before 2001, the amounts varied, with older fellows
receiving more money) is paid out over five years; checks go out
quarterly. Aside from occasional invitations to get together with
other fellows, that's it: money, free and clear.</TE>
<TE>   The process is famously confidential. Socolow's phone call was
Wilson's only direct contact with the foundation. Everyone involved
in the nomination, evaluation and selection of fellows is more than
circumspect about the details of the procedure. Instead, the
foundation relies on its mission statement as explanation: The grants
are intellectual seed money, long-term investments that reward past
accomplishments only in the sense that such achievements indicate a
recipient is likely to do bigger and better things with the freedom
provided by a bigger and better budget.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago painter Kerry James Marshall, who received a MacArthur in
1997, calls it venture capital: "It underwrites a five-year period of
research and development. It didn't change my approach to doing
anything; it just made it easier. It eliminated immediate commercial
concerns and let me take more chances."</TE>
<TE>   Wilson has barely settled into considering the effect of his
grant, but like Marshall, he sees it as an investment, and one more
bit of serendipity underpinning the Museum of Jurassic Technology.</TE>
<TE>   Getting a MacArthur, he says, "was a huge relief....But it's not
at all like winning the lottery--I mean, thank God, but it feels much
more like a continuation of the sort of short-handed process that has
been going on for 10 years, that has allowed us to get this far."</TE>
<TE>   On a typical day at the Museum of Jurassic Technology, 30 to 60
patrons leave behind the glaring sunshine and speeding traffic of
Venice Boulevard for the dimly lighted wonders of Wilson's galleries,
whose floor plan resembles an overpopulated rabbit warren. Visitors
are evenly divided between first-timers and repeat customers,
families and art students, from the hip to the nerdy. It's dark
inside, and before your eyes can adjust, your ears pick up all kinds
of sounds: jangling bells, rushing water, a barking dog, a
melancholic opera, and the soothing voices of men and women
explaining arcane subjects in trustworthy tones.</TE>
<TE>   One display outlines Donald R. Griffith's capture of a tiny South
American bat reportedly able to fly through solid objects. In 1952,
the eminent chiroptologist tricked the "piercing devil" by setting
up, in the jungle, massive lead walls that were invisible to the
bat's unique echolocation system. Another display contains a diorama
of Iguazu Falls, complete with circulating water. Viewed from the
side, the landscape looks like a model railroader's fantasy. But when
seen from the front, a ghostly suspension bridge spans the falls. A
nearby phone receiver conveys the story of Wilhelm Sonnabend, a young
structural engineer whose dream bridge collapsed into the chasm a day
before its completion in 1886.</TE>
<TE>   Several galleries are devoted to the intellectual adventures of
Anthanasius Kircher (1602-1680), a Jesuit scholar, inventor,
geographer, Egyptologist, astronomer and, among many other things,
proprietor of one of the first public museums. Other rooms, halls and
closet-sized spaces are dedicated to special exhibitions, including
"Garden of Eden on Wheels: Collections from L.A. Mobile Homes and
Trailer Parks" and "Tell the Bees: Belief, Knowledge and
Hypersymbolic Cognition."</TE>
<TE>   The museum's devious exhibits form labyrinthine stories in which
truth and fiction play cat and mouse. The charm of the place resides
in the homespun feel of the exhibits. Rarely is every one of them up
and running: burned-out light bulbs and malfunctioning mechanisms can
always be found, adding to the sense of adventure.</TE>
<TE>   "We think of ourselves as just another museum in a city full of
splendid museums," Wilson says. "All museums are different. All have
something to put into the world. We're an institution with a very
specific kind of thing that is sometimes complicated to put into
words. We have a program and we know our program is not for everyone,
but it seems to be for enough people to warrant our existence. And
that's basically how we see ourselves. As providing a service in
terms of fulfilling a certain kind of need in the culture."</TE>
<TE>   Admissions (suggested donations: adults $4, students and seniors,
$2.50), gift shop sales and a loyal core of about 500 members provide
a steady source of income. From 1989, when the museum opened to the
public, to 1999, when Wilson purchased the building, this more or
less covered the rent. Since then, it has paid most of the mortgage
($5,000 a month). Gifts and grants have also increased throughout the
1990s, paying the modest wages of a part-time staff of six and all of
the museum's operating expenses, which for the last few years have
ranged from $150,000 to $200,000 annually. Wilson, the founder and
director, does not draw a salary. His modest office is housed in a
weathered 1951 Spartanette trailer, built by J. Paul Getty's Spartan
Aircraft Co.</TE>
<TE>   Never one to put security ahead of growth, he has consistently
expanded the museum, often taking it to the brink of financial
disaster. In 1993, he doubled its floor space, breaking through an
adjoining wall to add a 1,600-square-foot building. A second
expansion, in 1995, added 2,000 square feet. And in 1999, with major
contributions from the Lannan, Bohen, Ahmanson and Ralph M. Parsons
foundations, the museum was able to purchase the 12,000-square-foot
structure in which it is housed. (Part of that deal involved selling
a 1,600-square-foot space to the Center for Land Use Interpretation,
a quirky information bureau that collects and disperses data about
the natural and not-so-natural landscape we live in.)</TE>
<TE>   When Wilson walks back to the museum from a nearby cafe, he
strolls in a relaxed manner, chatting casually about neighborhood
development and city governance. Once inside the front door, he picks
up the pace. Darting around corners, scampering down crooked
corridors and disappearing behind a sheet of plywood that covers a
hidden doorway, he leads a visitor on a whirlwind tour of the
museum's back rooms: cluttered workshops, temporary offices and raw
spaces still filled with the remnants of previous tenants.</TE>
<TE>   He also speaks more quickly, outlining plans with dizzying
swiftness. "We're thinking of going beyond adding more exhibition
halls to adding other kinds of experiences," he says. "Expanding the
nature of the experience rather than simply adding more of the same."</TE>
<TE>   The funds provided by the MacArthur Foundation will allow Wilson
to transform a cluster of large storerooms, and part of a mid-size
parking lot at the back of the property into an indoor-outdoor
garden. A former walk-in freezer will become a new 3-D exhibit.
Upstairs, he plans to convert several rooms of an old apartment into
a tearoom overlooking Venice Boulevard. Down the hall, the
construction of a 14-seat theater is awaiting its finishing touches.</TE>
<TE>   For the theater's lobby, which is still just a gutted apartment,
Wilson is commissioning L.A. artist M.A. Peers to paint portraits of
dogs from the former Soviet Union's space program. They will
complement a series of films he is producing in collaboration with
Olesya Turkina, curator of contemporary art and science at the
Russian State Museum, and Viktor Mazin, founder of the Freud Dream
Museum, both in St. Petersburg. The first film in the series has been
underway for years; the paintings simply a bright idea in need of
funding. The MacArthur will help make both a reality.</TE>
<TE>   "The garden is a relatively complex vision of things," Wilson
says. "But it's something we've been thinking about almost as long as
the museum has been here. We don't know if any of this is for sure,
but it certainly feels like some of it will now become possible."</TE>
<TE>   Artists, including Wilson, make up less than 5% of the 611
fellowships dispersed since 1981. What they do with the money seems
to follow a pattern that's mostly based on age and experience.</TE>
<TE>   Real estate is a common theme. Kerry James Marshall's grant of
$260,000 allowed him to purchase a studio four blocks from his home
on the south side of Chicago. Similarly, in 1989, pioneering video
artist Bill Viola used his to rent his first studio. Until then he
had been working out of his home in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   For sculptor Martin Puryear, who was also tapped in 1989, the
MacArthur provided stability when he was overseeing a major
retrospective of his work, starting a family and moving from downtown
Chicago to upstate New York. It permitted him to build a new home and
studio in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Artists who are further along in their careers usually pour the
money into whatever project they're working on. Seattle-based Gary
Hill was in Helsinki in 1998 when he got his call. "I was
dumbstruck," he says. But the grant didn't produce any dramatic
transformations. It simply filtered into his work, paying for better
equipment and materials, and providing a cushion from the fickle art
market. James Turrell, who has been transforming an Arizona crater
into a massive earthwork for 30 years, used the money to continue
construction on the project, which includes tunnels, chambers,
viewing platforms, even a small hotel.</TE>
<TE>   When legendary furniture designer Sam Maloof, who lives and works
in a home-studio he built in Rancho Cucamonga, got his award of
$375,000 in 1985, he felt that he was already working at full
capacity, with a crew of three and a secretary. So he donated $75,000
to the American Craft Council and set up a scholarship at Anderson
Ranch Art Center in Snowmass Village, Colo. Sales of his furniture
sustain it. "I already had the freedom," says the 86-year-old. "But I
was thrilled. I thought, 'Gosh, what's a woodworker doing in that
kind of company?'"</TE>
<TE>   Along with financial support, a MacArthur fellowship brings
prestige--which sometimes invites the jealousy of colleagues. Vija
Celmins, a realist painter who has lived in Manhattan since moving
there from Los Angeles in 1981, used her grant to buy a new car and
make a down payment on a house. She acknowledges the possible
downside.</TE>
<TE>   "I am happy to report that [the fellowship] hasn't ruined my
life," she says. "One of the problems is the 'genius' name. It's a
grandiose term; you think of Da Vinci and Michelangelo. I don't know
any geniuses. I don't think in those terms. It's irritating. It's a
generous prize, but I don't accept the term. [The award] is for
people who work hard. It gave me a certain amount of confidence, that
there were people out there who cared for my work. I just continued
what I was doing. I didn't quit. I didn't freak out. It really helped
out at the beginning. Now I'm in my last year and don't even think
about it."</TE>
<TE>   When the MacArthur Foundation named Wilson as a fellow, it put its
weight behind a project that, in his words, "never really made sense
in the normal way things make sense."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Denver in 1946, Wilson earned a bachelor's degree in urban
entomology in 1969 at Michigan's Kalamazoo College, where he met his
wife, Diana, at a square dance on the first day of school. (They have
been married 32 years and have a 14-year-old daughter, DanRae.) After
a brief stint in Chicago, they moved to Colorado, where Wilson, a
conscientious objector during the war in Vietnam, did alternative
service as an emergency room and mental ward orderly.</TE>
<TE>   Upon earning a master's of fine arts degree in film at CalArts in
Valencia, he did freelance special-effects work for the movie
industry, fabricating robotic devices that allowed cameras to get
shots from seemingly impossible positions. This allowed him the time
and money to make short art films, which he did throughout the 1970s.
"I loved the process of doing those," he says. "But I was conscious
[that I] was just kind of, I won't say biding time. But I absolutely
knew that this was not what it was all going to be about."</TE>
<TE>   The idea for the museum came to him in 1984. "It built slowly," he
says, "but it definitely erupted into consciousness in an absolute
single moment.</TE>
<TE>   "My background was very split between natural science on the one
hand, and display and presentation on the other. I had a terrible
time with that split for a very long time in my life--I'd say a
decade or 15 years, really, really struggling, knowing there was
something that I just wanted, needed to do that was going to bring
all of this together in some kind of meaningful way. And it actually
all just came together one Saturday morning."</TE>
<TE>   On that day, in his Silver Lake workshop, while looking through a
series of slides of displays at the Smithsonian, Wilson saw his
future. "I was just sitting there and it was just like somebody had
dropped a locomotive on me. It wasn't like being hit by a train, but
having one fall from the sky. All of a sudden the idea of what I
wanted to do just came with just such extraordinary clarity: that
more than anything in the world what I wanted to do was to have a
museum."</TE>
<TE>   He continues, "And so many aspects of the whole idea of the
museum, its relationship to the world, having a place open to the
public, and ideas for probably the first six or eight exhibits all
just fell into place. It's amazing how minds work--that kind of
eruption of all that material, which must have in some way been
there, simmering, entirely unknown to me.</TE>
<TE>   "When we opened," he says, "we didn't know if anybody would ever
come. And for a very long time, nobody did come. There were many days
when there were two or three people. If we would get 10 visitors,
we'd celebrate." Wilson often woke up in the middle of the night
wondering where he had put the "For Lease" sign that had been in the
window. He was sure he would have to give up the building, and he
didn't want to buy a new sign.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though the museum was costing Diana and me all of the money
we had, the whole of our life energies, there was never a sense that
it was a mistake. Even when it seemed absolutely certain that it was
all just going to come to nothing, it felt like it was going to be
the right thing to have done."</TE>
<TE>   The museum's seat-of-the-pants financing has done more than
determine the look, feel and flavor of its exhibits. "Clearly
economic necessity has shaped how we developed, what we were able to
do and not able to do," Wilson says. "Somehow it is obvious that we
didn't have money and we did it anyhow. And I think that that
actually has become, in an unspoken or almost unconscious way, an
important part of what our act is, in terms of putting things into
the world."</TE>
<TE>   Although not knowing where the money to pay next month's bills
will come from fills most of us with fear, Wilson seems to be
inspired by such white-knuckle uncertainty. In any case, putting
people in the presence of the unknown is one of the fundamental goals
of his museum.</TE>
<TE>   He says, "I've gotten a little touchy about the word 'wonder,' but
if [what you know about the world] doesn't come from amazement, it
lacks something. There's a kind of mental-scape and expansiveness
that comes from that extraordinary sense of not knowing. When folks
in the sciences talk about their moments of inspiration that seem to
come out of the blue, it seems to be very similar to people who
endure creative inspiration. It all has some kind of common well.
Whatever processes of mind those are, they allow us to know more than
we thought we knew or thought we could know. It always seems to be a
combination of knowing and not knowing, a crazy mixture that's a
great place to be. Not all of the time, but a great place to visit."</TE>
<TE>   Like his museum.</TE>
<TE>   More than anything else, the MacArthur has given Wilson a sense of
the future. "It's five years. For us, five years is a huge amount of
time. We have never known if we would be around more than a few
months in advance. Now we can kind of plan things, we can count on
being here down the line."</TE>
<TE>   He pauses, then elaborates. "We have come to trust whatever
mechanism it is that allows us to continue to be around. It's not as
if there's any rational reason to think that now it's more likely
that we're going to be around, with the possible exception of the
MacArthur. It's only that we have all come to see, you know, I don't
want to say miracles, but to see unexpected surprises happen so many
times that we just now function assuming that somehow things will
work out. It doesn't mean that you can sleep much better--but you do
assume you'll be here. And I think we actually do sleep better, and I
can't begin to explain why. Which doesn't mean that it all couldn't
fall apart next fall."</TE>

<HD>Rolling Stones Obsessives May Finally Get Satisfaction</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Satisfaction has long eluded Rolling Stones fans when it's come to
definitive, career-spanning hits collections and access to the wealth
of unreleased material in the group's vaults.</LD>
<LD>   Releases of vintage work from the Beatles, Bob Dylan, the Who and
others have enhanced the public legacies of legendary acts. But not
the Stones.</LD>
<LD>   Who wouldn't be intrigued by a collection of the band's '60s
appearances on BBC radio shows? Or unheard sessions from a 1964 visit
to Chicago's famed Chess studios? Or such notorious curiosities as
"Claudine Longet," the 1979 snipe at the singer who shot her lover,
skier Spider Sabich?</LD>
<TE>   All these items have been only rumors, except to the most diligent
bootleg collectors.</TE>
<TE>   But at least some of that seems set to change in conjunction with
the Stones' 40th anniversary celebrations this year, to be marked by
a fall concert tour.</TE>
<TE>   For years, any such discussions have been hamstrung by the fact
that the Stones' catalog is controlled by two entities. Everything
from the group's 1962 London beginnings through 1970's "Beggars
Banquet" and live "Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out" is owned by ABKCO, the
company headed by the band's late-'60s manager, Allen Klein.
Everything from 1971's "Sticky Fingers" on, though, is controlled by
the Stones themselves in conjunction with Virgin Records. In the
past, the two camps were unable or unwilling to coordinate their
efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Although representatives of the Stones, Virgin and Klein would not
talk on the record about plans, it appears steps have been taken to
overcome the hurdles, and plans are being made for several potential
projects.</TE>
<TE>   Foremost is a definitive collection of the band's best-known
songs, along the lines of the Beatles' "1," a phenomenal success
after its 2000 release. The biggest questions with this, sources
involved with the project say, is whether it would be one disc or
two, and what balance to have among selections from the band's
various eras. The bulk of the biggest Stones singles came in the '60s
and early '70s.</TE>
<TE>   "If they're going to follow the Beatles' formula for success, then
one CD should be it to keep the price attractive," says Pete Howard,
publisher and editor of the CD collectors monthly ICE. "However, Pink
Floyd has done well with a double-CD package now. And the Beatles had
just six or seven years of material to include, while the Stones have
four decades--though they haven't had many hits in the last couple of
decades."</TE>
<TE>   More tantalizing to the most serious fans, though, is the wealth
of unreleased material.</TE>
<TE>   A set of notes has been made by Virgin researchers highlighting
material available for either package in the mode of the Beatles'
three-volume "Anthology" series or as bonus tracks for reissues of
original albums. The notes also cover material from a never-released
live album of the band's 1972 tour to complete recordings of shows at
the El Mocambo club in Toronto (four songs of which appear on the
"Love You Live" album).</TE>
<TE>   The '60s vaults, as cataloged on various obsessive fan Web sites,
are even richer. In addition to the BBC tapes, there are such
intriguing recordings as "Pay Your Dues," a 1968 track featuring
music for what would become "Street Fighting Man" but with lyrics
about a Native American chief, and a 1966 tribute to actress Brigitte
Bardot.</TE>
<TE>   CUTTING EDGE: A planned teaming of Jay-Z with Fatboy Slim probably
won't work out for the "Blade 2" soundtrack, a project pairing top
rap acts with star electronica producers and DJs. But executive
producer Happy Walters--who did similar concepts with the rap-rock
teamings for "Judgment Night" and hard rock and techno acts for
"Spawn"--has instead hooked up Fatboy on a song with Eve.</TE>
<TE>   The track will join others pairing Mystikal and Moby, Redman and
the Gorillaz, Ice Cube and Paul Oakenfold, Mos Def and Massive
Attack, and Cypress Hill and Roni Size, among others, on the album
due March 26, with the movie premiering March 29. Eve, Mos Def and
the Roots will be among the album's representatives performing
previews of the project at a party hosted by basketball player
Rasheed Wallace during NBA All-Star weekend starting Feb. 8 in
Philadelphia, with a formal launch event planned for the
electronica-oriented Winter Music Conference in Miami, which starts
March 23.</TE>
<TE>   CRIME FIGHTERS: The folks behind the Fox network's "America's Most
Wanted" have gone to a surprising source in search of new theme
music--the duo They Might Be Giants, known primarily for snappy
alt-pop and obliquely intellectual lyrics, most prominently applied
in recent years to the Grammy-nominated theme song of Fox's comedy
"Malcolm in the Middle."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Glasser, post-production supervisor for "America's Most
Wanted," says TMBG was not brought in to do anything novel or flip,
but to create a theme instrumental that's stirring and memorable in
the tradition of the themes from "Peter Gunn" and "Dragnet," with
modern twists.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're looking for is something catchy and powerful, and they
have a wide range of dynamic musicianship," Glasser says. "We wanted
a theme song that would make the criminals shake in their boots, ring
fear in the hearts of evil-doers around the world."</TE>
<TE>   Co-Giant John Flansburgh believes he and his partner, John
Linnell, are up to the task, having in recent years created
news-related music cues for "Nightline" as well as Jon Stewart's "The
Daily Show," in addition to several jobs for Disney projects and a
current series of Diet Dr. Pepper commercials for television.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing about They Might Be Giants as a band is we're versatile
and people feel if they have a tough assignment we can dig in to pull
it off," Flansburgh says.</TE>
<TE>   "'America's Most Wanted' is a very singular show. It's not Jack
Webb, not a shoot-'em-up cop show. They've caught a lot of criminals.
We're happy to be doing our part."</TE>
<TE>   SMALL FACES: Mark Eitzel has three albums in the works--one of new
songs due in the fall, and two side turns. On the tentatively titled
"Mark Eitzel Singes the Sentimental Hits of the '40s, '50s, '60s,
'70s and '80s," the normally downcast singer tackles such hopeful
material as the Flamingos' "I Only Have Eyes for You," Andrea True
Connection's "More, More, More" and Anne Murray's "Snowbird," in
addition to Culture Club's "Do You Really Want to Hurt Me." Even
odder, Eitzel accepted an invitation to fly to Athens and record some
of his old American Music Club songs with a traditional Greek
rembetika-style band. Titled "The Ugly American," it will be released
in the fall by Greek label Hitchyke....</TE>
<TE>   Although they haven't made a group album in more than 30 years,
Texas troubadour trio the Flatlanders--Joe Ely, Butch Hancock and
Jimmie Dale Gilmore--have just signed a multi-album deal with New
West Records. The three are finishing the first new collection, due
in April.</TE>

<LD>   THE CHEMICAL BROTHERS</LD>
<LD>   "Come With Us"</LD>
<TE>   Astralwerks</TE>
<TE>   With 1997's invigorating "Block Rockin' Beats," the Chemical
Brothers proved that they can craft a hit single as well as any act
on the dance scene today. What the English electronic stars have yet
to establish is that they can sustain that skill for an album.</TE>
<TE>   They aren't alone; few of their peers have accomplished that feat.
But few artists have the reputation of Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons,
who have been anointed the leaders of an entire genre of music.</TE>
<TE>   As if aware that they needed to step up in order to meet those
expectations, they answer the challenge with an album that celebrates
all the diversity electronic music has to offer.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Chemical Brothers' fourth album (due in stores
Tuesday) is anchored by a memorable lead single--the pulsating conga
percussion and laser-like keyboards of "It Began in Afrika" have been
burning up the dance floors at raves and clubs around the world since
DJs got their hands on it last fall--the Chemical Brothers back up
the track with a collection of equally rewarding numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it's the dance-centric house of "Star Guitar," the
stuttering keyboards of the acid-propelled mini-drama "My Elastic
Eye," the Beatles-like psychedelia of "Pioneer Skies" or the surreal
dreaminess of the down-tempo "The State We're In" (with singer Beth
Orton), "Come With Us" creates an intoxicating netherworld of lush
soundscapes.</TE>
<TE>   "Come With Us" is an impressive achievement, a wholly dance album
that can appeal to listeners beyond the dance world. This time the
Chemical Brothers have truly earned their reputation as the best in
the business.--Steve Baltin</TE>
<TE>   **1/2</TE>
<TE>   DAWN ROBINSON</TE>
<TE>   "Dawn"</TE>
<TE>   Q</TE>
<TE>   After earning success and acclaim with notable funk-soul groups En
Vogue and Lucy Pearl, singer Dawn Robinson finally steps out solo.
But between echoes of her former projects and sops to modern pop,
this is not a terribly exciting new "Dawn."</TE>
<TE>   Mixing rock, R&amp;B, soul, hip-hop and funk in numbers ranging from
lively to leaden, these dozen tracks (in stores Tuesday) form the
usual package put together to demonstrate an artist's "uniqueness."
The album's mood shifts from celebratory ("Party, Party") to romantic
("Set It Off") to defiant ("Still") to inspirational ("Get Up
Again").</TE>
<TE>   Her greatest asset is her voice, an agile instrument that can coo
breathily or wail mournfully, but is most compelling when its sharp,
don't-give-me-any-grief edge is tearing off chunks of whoever has
wronged her. Not surprisingly, the collection's best moments come
with taut funk-pop that recalls En Vogue's respect-me-or-else hits.
In the accusatory "How Long," she even obliquely references that
group's 1990 smash "Hold On." But not even her singing can elevate
such tripe as the syrupy I'm-pregnant ballad "Our Child."</TE>
<TE>   Still, lyrical cliches could be forgiven if the production were
slightly more innovative--and that doesn't mean emulating 'N Sync
with the "Bye Bye Bye"-like kiss-off "Fed Up." Maybe a sense of
rehash was inevitable--after all, En Vogue was among the first to
stylishly blend classic R&amp;B with hip-hop, and Lucy Pearl elevated the
casual groove to pop art. Which was all the more reason to pay
attention to the details.-- Natalie Nichols</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   HANK WILLIAMS III</TE>
<TE>   "Lovesick, Broke &amp; Driftin'"</TE>
<TE>   Curb</TE>
<TE>   If Garth Brooks is the anti-Hank to country purists, then Hank
Williams' grandson must be the anti-Garth. The songs on the scrawny
upstart's second album (in stores Tuesday) are full of cheatin',
lyin', stealin', ramblin', gamblin', drinkin', smokin', tokin',
truckin', mama, prison, yodeling, moaning fiddle and weeping steel
guitar: all things mainstream country music tries desperately to
avoid now.</TE>
<TE>   That makes the man with the thin, nasal whine that's just like his
granddaddy's both a revivalist and a revolutionary, because he also
resurrects the notion of soul-deep remorse, something also in short
supply in the songs that reach country radio.</TE>
<TE>   He sounds like even more of a throwback than he did on his 1999
debut, "Risin' Outlaw," an album Williams has since disparaged. Yet
if his sophomore effort is more reflective of his vision, it still
doesn't present the full picture of a performer who's also capable of
hyper-charged punk-rock fury.</TE>
<TE>   The closest he gets here is in "Trashville," a chugging Southern
rocker that has more in common with Hank Jr. than Sr. He rarely
flashes the lyrical poetry that made Hank Sr. the hillbilly
Shakespeare, but he does extend the Williams legacy on alienation,
loneliness and heartache. --Randy Lewis</TE>
<TE>   In Brief</TE>
<TE>   **1/2 Nine Inch Nails, "All That Could Have Been,"
Nothing/Interscope. On this document from NIN's 2000 tour (in stores
Tuesday), the edgier songs gain some edge, but the more atmospheric
stuff loses atmosphere. So that's a push. Perfectionist Trent Reznor
is looser live but can't create the enveloping sonic spaces he gets
in the studio. So that's a push too. The set list, if heavy on 1999's
"The Fragile" album, is a career-spanning collection, but with no
real revisions or revelations, and Reznor's someone from whom we
should always expect revelations. So that's a minus. The companion
DVD, with more songs plus visuals, is probably a better buy. --Steve
Hochman</TE>
<TE>   **1/2 Citizen Cope, "Citizen Cope," DreamWorks. Clarence
Greenwood, a.k.a. Citizen Cope, tries too hard on this debut (due
Tuesday), with his street-life short stories and snapshots, going
heavy on biblical imagery (a confrontation with a Porsche-driving
devil in "Salvation"), eccentric characters (the street-hustler
portrait "200,000") and a wearily jaundiced vocal delivery. But the
balance of quiet despair and perpetual hope bespeaks experience,
echoed in the somber keyboard textures and understated rhythms.
Affectations and all, at his best he's a John Prine for the hip-hop
era. --S.H.</TE>
<TE>   ** Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan &amp; Party, "Body and Soul," Real World.
Recorded in Lahore shortly before the great qawwali singer's death in
1997, this set of four numbers (due Tuesday) was retrieved and mixed
at Real World. The sound, however, leaves something to be desired,
and Khan--despite the astonishing fluency of his melodic invention--
is a bit more subdued than usual. Any recording by this legendary
artist is worth having, of course, but qawwali fans should look to
his earlier work to experience the full, ecstatic eloquence of Khan's
vocal art. --Don Heckman</TE>
<TE>   *** Unwritten Law, "Elva," Interscope. This San Diego band has
been bouncing along the beaten path between power-pop and punk since
its '95 debut, "Blue Room." Its fourth release (due Tuesday) sees the
quintet continuing to buff the fuzz and fury with hooks, harmonies
and heartfelt expression. This effervescent collection has hit
potential, but unlike the offerings of many of Law's pop-punk peers,
it's never predictable. Tinges of '80s arena rock, metal and reggae
help make "Elva" a mature yet rompish ride.-- Lina Lecaro</TE>
<TE>   **1/2 State Property, "State Property," Roc-A-Fella/Def Jam.
Anchored by respected rapper Beanie Sigel, this sextet delivers a
debut collection (due Tuesday) that doubles as the soundtrack of the
film of the same name. The group relies on its most prominent member
to deliver its fiercest flows. Sigel, whose solo work has been wildly
inconsistent, regains his focus here, rocking ravenously over the
sinister beats from N-O Joe and Just Blaze. The feeble Freeway and
Beanie's other pals pale in comparison. --Soren Baker</TE>
<TE>   **1/2 Lil' Keke, "Platinum in Da Ghetto," In the Paint/KOCH. With
his first national release, this respected veteran Houston rapper
delivers largely upbeat, celebratory cuts that are difficult to
resist. Keke's energetic flows and bouncy beats will likely have
Southern deejays salivating, even though his lyrics are nothing
remarkable. It's more about mood than meaning with this album,
although he does offer some sage words to his son while the world
swirls around them. --Soren Baker</TE>

<HD>It's Elementary, Oscar</HD>
<DH>In a weak year, the obvious candidates are likely to be
nominated. Think 'Rings' and 'Beautiful Mind' for best film.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>Times Film Critic</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sherlock Holmes never tried his hand at Oscar prognosticating, but
indications are he would have had a flair for it. "When you have
eliminated the impossible," the great detective said, "whatever
remains, however improbable, must be the truth." As it was for the
sage of Baker Street, so it is with the Academy Awards 2002.</LD>
<LD>   For despite, or perhaps because of, this being an especially weak
year for the kinds of films Oscar voters favor, it is easier than
usual to discern what the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
is likely to do when it announces its nominees on Feb. 12. An
informal survey of veteran Oscar watchers revealed surprising
near-unanimity as to what those choices might be.</LD>
<LD>   Best Picture</LD>
<TE>   This category, always the object of intense interest, seems
especially clear. Two films are destined to be nominated and, more
than that, likely to fight it out for the actual award. One is "A
Beautiful Mind," a Ron Howard-directed look at what happens when a
genius goes mad; and the other is Peter Jackson's "The Lord of the
Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," whose co-front-runner status was
enhanced by a victory in the recent American Film Institute awards.</TE>
<TE>   Two other quite different films also seem likely for nominations.
"In the Bedroom," the kind of intense, adult dramas the studios seem
to have lost the knack for, would have been a long shot in any other
year, but not this one. Similarly, "Black Hawk Down," despite its
violence, benefits not only from Ridley Scott's panoramic direction,
but from a national mood that is as pro-military as it's been in
quite some time.</TE>
<TE>   As for the fifth slot, one of two films seems likely to fill it.
"Moulin Rouge" certainly has its passionate advocates, but it has no
lack of detractors either, although 20th Century Fox has been trying
to bolster its chances among older voters by prominently displaying
quotes from such venerable industry figures as Robert Wise and
Stanley Donen. Also on the rise is Robert Altman's amusing "Gosford
Park," which has been gradually gaining adherents.</TE>
<TE>   More remotely possible are Michael Mann's "Ali" and "Shrek," the
little cartoon that could, which would have been highly likely in
another year, but the existence of a first-time feature animation
Oscar may crimp its chances. As for David Lynch's "Mulholland Drive,"
its numerous critics' awards will likely not go far enough toward
making it palatable to the academy membership.</TE>
<TE>   The other categories should break down as follows:</TE>
<TE>   Best Director</TE>
<TE>   The voters seem poised to follow the best picture pattern, but
only up to a point. Scott's skill in "Black Hawk Down" will be
difficult to resist, as should the scope of what Jackson accomplished
with the J.R.R. Tolkien novel. Also likely are industry veteran
Howard and the even more veteran Altman. The fifth slot will be an
all-out tussle among three respected directors whose films might not
be in the best picture mix: Mann for "Ali," Baz Luhrmann for "Moulin
Rouge" and Lynch for "Mulholland Drive."</TE>
<TE>   Best Actor</TE>
<TE>   This may be the first year with two African American best actor
nominees, Denzel Washington for "Training Day" and the well-liked
Will Smith for his anti-charismatic performance in "Ali." Two other
slots will likely go to non-American actors, Tom Wilkinson for "In
the Bedroom" and Russell Crowe, West Virginia accent and all, for "A
Beautiful Mind." The fifth slot could be Gene Hackman for "The Royal
Tenenbaums" or Billy Bob Thornton in "Monster's Ball," with acting
branch favorite Sean Penn in "I Am Sam" a more distant possibility.</TE>
<TE>   Best Actress</TE>
<TE>   The same names come up again and again in this category: Sissy
Spacek for "In the Bedroom," Nicole Kidman for "The Others" (not
"Moulin Rouge"), Judi Dench for "Iris," Halle Berry for "Monster's
Ball" and, should enough people manage to see the film, the
remarkable Tilda Swinton for "The Deep End." If Swinton doesn't get
enough votes, Renee Zellweger has a shot for "Bridget Jones's Diary."
Naomi Watts has won a number of critics' awards for "Mulholland
Drive" and she could break through here as well.</TE>
<TE>   Supporting Actor</TE>
<TE>   This is where things get a little tricky. The only sure bets seem
to be Ben Kingsley as the anti-Gandhi in "Sexy Beast" and Jim
Broadbent as Dench's partner in "Iris." There will likely be some
nominations for "Lord of the Rings," with Ian McKellen's wizardly
Gandalf and Viggo Mortensen's magnetic Aragon the strongest
contenders. Similarly, a nomination should come out of "Ali," either
Jamie Foxx's exuberant Bundini Brown or Jon Voight's grave Howard
Cosell. And, if the films get seen, Brian Cox could be up for
"L.I.E.," Steve Buscemi for "Ghost World," or Tony Shalhoub for "The
Man Who Wasn't There."</TE>
<TE>   Supporting Actress</TE>
<TE>   As usual, a lot of British faces will be visible, led by Maggie
Smith, irresistible in "Gosford Park." Helen Mirren might also get a
nod for that film, although she had a better role in the regrettably
little seen "Last Orders." Kate Winslet is possible as the younger
Murdoch in "Iris," as is Australian Cate Blanchett, who was hard to
miss in "The Shipping News." The two likely American contenders are
Jennifer Connelly for "A Beautiful Mind" and Marisa Tomei reinventing
herself for "In the Bedroom."</TE>
<TE>   Adapted Screenplay</TE>
<TE>   A category with considerable riches this time around, extending
from "In the Bedroom," taken from a short story, to the children's
book-based "Shrek," the comic book-based "Ghost World" and the
play-based "Lantana." Other potential nominees include "Lord of the
Rings," "Iris," "Black Hawk Down" (although the film doesn't have a
"written" feel), "Bridget Jones's Diary," "The Shipping News" and "A
Beautiful Mind" (although the film veered considerably from the
book's nonfiction story.) Also worthy but perhaps too little seen is
"The Deep End," a film whose core novel, "The Blank Wall," was
previously made into the Max Ophuls-directed "The Reckless Moment"
half a century ago.</TE>
<TE>   Original Screenplay</TE>
<TE>   The possibilities here are certainly varied and mostly extend to
scripts written for or by auteur directors: Julian Fellowes for
Altman's "Gosford Park," David Mamet for his "Heist," Joel and Ethan
Coen for their "The Man Who Wasn't There" and director Wes Anderson
and actor Owen Wilson for "The Royal Tenenbaums." "Memento" is
another viable candidate for director-writer Christopher Nolan and
his brother Jonathan (who wrote the story). Also possible is the
downbeat "Monster's Ball," and, if the writers feel like venturing
onto foreign shores, the Bosnian "No Man's Land," which took home
best screenplay honors at Cannes and the recent European film
awards--and deserved them.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Story line: Los Angeles club legend records first album in his late
40s, and now follows it with a stellar effort that includes a
32-year-old track with cameos by blues legends Willie Dixon and
Sunnyland Slim.</LD>
<LD>   The goods: "Old Souls &amp; Wolf Tickets," just out on Rykodisc/Slow
River.</LD>
<LD>   The hero: Singer-songwriter Chuck E. Weiss, a native of Colorado
who began his career as a journeyman blues drummer, has been a
fixture on the L.A. music scene since the late '70s, when he cavorted
with buds Tom Waits and Rickie Lee Jones. It was Jones who made him a
15-minute celebrity in 1979 with her Top 40 hit, "Chuck E.'s in
Love." From 1981 to 1997, Weiss and his band the G-d Damn Liars
cooked up an electric blues tempest every Monday night at the
Central, which is now the Viper Room.</LD>
<TE>   The album: Weiss' 1999 full-length debut "Extremely Cool," which
was bankrolled by Waits and then picked up by Rykodisc for
distribution, received strong reviews and introduced this 40-year
music veteran to a national audience. (Let's not count 1981's "The
Other Side of Town," a collection of demo recordings.) "Old Souls" is
an even more impressive showcase for Weiss' skewed talents, from the
dada jump-blues of "Tony Did the Boogie Woogie" to the punch-drunk
sea shanty stumble of "Anthem for Old Souls" and the bittersweet
torch ballad "It Don't Happen Overnight." "I wanted this album to do
a couple more things than the last one," he says, "so I pulled out
some melodic tunes that you can hum along to."</TE>
<TE>   The awful truth: It took a pink slip to jump-start Weiss'
recording career. According to Weiss, his Central gig had become a
crutch. "I was really bummed for a while when I lost the Central
thing, but it forced me into recording. I resented [the club] for
ending it, but it was a definite blessing in disguise."</TE>
<TE>   Ain't entirely a C thang: Weiss credits Waits for helping get his
act in gear. "He was really a mentor, telling me what I needed to do
to get it done. It's kinda like Snoop and Dr. Dre!"</TE>
<TE>   Road show: Weiss, who plays the Viper Room in West Hollywood on
Thursday, hopes to take the G-d Damn Liars on the road. "It all
depends on how well the album's received. If it does well, that's
when the bookings come."</TE>

<HD>Her Private Happy Meal</HD>
<DH>Laurie Anderson was getting bored, so she took jobs at
McDonald's and elsewhere to prepare for 'Happiness.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEF WOODARD</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The weather outside is chilling, a typical mid-January day here. But
Laurie Anderson's loft feels like a creative refuge, an escape from
the outside world.</LD>
<LD>   Anderson has long called this TriBeCa building home and factory,
with its Hudson River view to die for. She happily gives a visitor a
tour, showing off a humble equipment station, with a keyboard, basic
mixing equipment and sound devices, and her headless electric violin.
She points to a few Line 6 sound processors with the proud grin of a
geek with a new toy. "These are great. Lou gave me them." Lou being
Lou Reed, her romantic other.</LD>
<LD>   This modest set-up, no more intricate than what you'd find in your
local cocktail lounge, is the cockpit for "Happiness," a new work
that Anderson will perform, in its premiere, at UC Santa Barbara on
Wednesday and Thursday, and then take to UCLA on Feb. 9. By her often
complex technological standards, the new solo work is a
soul-searching, minimalist statement--an evening-long piece that
interweaves songs and stories, accompanied by Anderson on violin and
keyboards.</LD>
<TE>   She is a native Midwesterner (born in Chicago; reared in Glen
Ellyn, Ill.) who came to New York City at 20 and made a name in the
performance art scene of the '70s. Her work, merging music, dance,
theater, art and technology, crossed over to the pop scene with the
fluke British hit "O Superman" in 1980. Hers is a friendly, quirky
aesthetic, which partly accounts for her high profile and longevity
in a field of one. She's the avant-gardist who came out of the cold.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson's lair is only 10 blocks from ground zero, and although
she was out of town Sept. 11, she says the event has radically
altered her viewpoint. Along with tales of her experiences trying out
various work situations (on an Amish farm and at a Manhattan
McDonald's) and Zen river-rafting, her reactions to it are woven into
"Happiness."</TE>
<TE>   When the compact and soft-spoken Anderson, 54, sits down for an
interview, she seems simultaneously present and lost in thought, the
same lucid yet dreamy quality that she often brings to her
performances. She chooses her studio's control room, which is packed
with sound equipment and the inevitable computer running the industry
standard Pro Tools recording program, but she points longingly out
the window, noting, "This view is more important than anything else
for me.</TE>
<TE>   Question: "Songs and Stories from 'Moby-Dick,'" your last work,
was a real production number, with props, technical elements, cast,
and all. Was it necessary for you to unplug after that, to scale
back?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Yes, I usually do something big and then something small.
I could not improvise in that piece, not at all. It was like I had to
get to a certain B flat at a certain time. I was always aware of the
machine I was part of.</TE>
<TE>   Also, it's really a big project trying to get that kind of
financing, commissions together. A lot of that is going around with
your hand out, saying, "Please, be interested in this," and doing
your dog and pony show, saying, "Oh, it's going to look like this and
this...." I just wanted to be on my own and see what happens. I love
making images. I do miss that. On the other hand, I really appreciate
the collaborative process [onstage] in this--it is so bare, there
really is a lot more real contact with the audience. I can really
feel it much more directly.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How did you start the process of working on "Happiness"?</TE>
<TE>   A: About eight months ago, I began culling stuff for it. I made
some weird trips, because I realized I was bored with what I was
doing. I needed another point of view. I needed to put myself in
uncomfortable places. So that's what I did.</TE>
<TE>   Another trip [is in] the piece called "The Green River." It was
supposed to be studying the work of the Dogen, the 13th century
Japanese Zen master who believed that mountains are aware. This was
supposed to be two weeks of total silence, canoeing in Utah. And then
our Zen teacher, each evening, would talk about the Dogen. I thought,
"Boy, that sounds good."</TE>
<TE>   I won't tell you the outcome, but it couldn't have been more
opposite than that. I realized that I run my life on expectations.</TE>
<TE>   It was going to be like a collection of those kinds of things.
Then came Sept. 11, and pretty much everything changed for me, on
just about every level of my life. It's very strange. I got back
about a week later and was here a few days and then in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Q: When you came back to New York, did you find a completely
changed city?</TE>
<TE>   A: Yeah. When I came back a week later, I stayed for a week. I
went down to ground zero every day, sometimes twice a day. It's about
10 blocks from here. I couldn't get into my place at first. It was
cordoned off. Then it was covered with journalists. I couldn't get
into the door without doing an interview for Japanese TV or somebody
else yelling, "You're Laurie Anderson, come over here." For a lot of
people who live in this neighborhood, they were out, for the second
plane, on Greenwich Street. That was the runway. That's something you
never forget. It comes down your street, goes around that apartment
building, takes a left and a right.... That made all the difference.
Your town, your street.</TE>
<TE>   My biggest reaction was a kind of awe at the beauty of things. I
saw it mostly as a kind of opportunity. There was a door that just
opened. What am I going to do? I have a chance now to look at things
differently. When something of that enormity happens, you do get a
chance to really live in the present for a while. Partially, it was
because nobody knew what would happen next. We're not good at making
those predictions.</TE>
<TE>   In my own relationships, I realized how much [I was] predicting
and rehashing. Even conversations weren't happening in the moment.
I'd be thinking about what I just said or thinking about what I was
going to say and not really realizing that I was talking to somebody
in real time. Real time became a big deal. It was suddenly much more
important.</TE>
<TE>   Already, I'd been colossally disappointed in my mode of working,
which again had to do with what I saw as expectations and
predictions.</TE>
<TE>   Q: As an artist, you felt there was a predictable pattern you were
slipping into?</TE>
<TE>   A: Oh sure. Many artists share that feeling, especially artists in
their 50s, I think. I was talking to some of those people--my
people--at a benefit the other night. We were talking about how you
start something and then people identify you with that, and you keep
doing it. It's hard to get that excited anymore.</TE>
<TE>   I don't feel that, the lack of excitement, or at least not often.
But I do know what they're talking about, when you say to yourself,
"Oh, should I do another one of those? What time is it?"</TE>
<TE>   Q: But it sounds like "Happiness" is a proactive response to that
feeling of being static. Is that the idea?</TE>
<TE>   A: Yeah. Also, there's a lot more personal stuff than I thought. I
was shocked when I heard the tape [of a work-in-progress run-through
in December]. "What, you're telling that story? Why would you want to
say that?" I've used a lot of experiences that I've had and
conversations that I've had in my work, but not quite like this.</TE>
<TE>   One of the pieces is called "A Story About a Story." It's about
when I broke my back when I was 12. It was always a story that I
would tell people if they asked what kind of childhood I had. I had
this sort of [she pauses] shtick, this version of what had happened.</TE>
<TE>   Then, when I started thinking about it, I realized I had forgotten
most it. I just remembered other things about it, like how silly the
doctors were, funny things, anecdotal things.</TE>
<TE>   But what I'd forgotten about was what it sounded like at night.
Burn victims were in the hospital. They put all the kids in the same
ward. They'd scream all night and then they'd die. It was the sound
of children dying. It was something that I'd put somewhere. It was
just too horrifying to remember.</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, I was telling that to someone, and probably
because of the images from the trade center, of people falling and
birds on fire, all this stuff came back to me.</TE>
<TE>   Part of ["Happiness"] is about the stories that you tell yourself,
or other people, about who you are.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You've often taken on different personas in your work. For
"Happiness," were you assuming different identities in search of
material?</TE>
<TE>   A: Well, not so much identities as just taking jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Were people aware of you being Laurie Anderson?</TE>
<TE>   A: Let's see, I was working in McDonald's on Canal Street. People
I knew came in. I was not disguising myself but just working in
uniform, with the little cap. I'd say, "Good morning, welcome to
McDonald's." I was about to [she winks] blow my cover, until I
realized that they didn't see me. I wasn't supposed to be there, so I
wasn't there.</TE>
<TE>   I didn't take it personally. I didn't say to myself, "Now, I'm
suddenly part of the service industry and I've become invisible."</TE>
<TE>   [But] I went in with a very cynical point of view. I was going to
look at mass production. How do you make something that appeals to a
lot of people, whether it's hamburgers, CDs or whatever. I make this
stuff in hopes that a lot of people like it.</TE>
<TE>   Also, I had some ideas about what a crummy job it would probably
be.</TE>
<TE>   I only worked there two weeks, so what do I know? But it was
absolutely the opposite of what I expected. People who worked there
were--and this is no joke--genuinely happy. Not to say anything about
McDonald's in general, but this one had that feeling of camaraderie
and fun. We were proud of what we doing. We were fast. We joked
around all the time.</TE>
<TE>   Q: It sounds like you miss it.</TE>
<TE>   A: I do. Also, I was able to give people exactly what they wanted.</TE>
<TE>   Q: That's a quality that you don't often get in the arts?</TE>
<TE>   A: No. It's very fluid. [In a gruff voice,] "That's not what I
ordered. I ordered an opera. This is a potato print."</TE>
<TE>   Q: You have carved out your own place in culture, touching on
elements of performance art and pop and new music and other things.
But there remains no easy explanation or categorization for what you
do. Is that actually a sign of success, from your viewpoint?</TE>
<TE>   A: You have to think about if you want to be pinned down as one
thing or another. It's hard to create an image that is so concrete
and stable. That takes PR people. Nobody's like that.</TE>
<TE>   I much prefer being able to flit around. It's just the way I am,
from the time I was 5, doing this, doing that. I always wanted the
freedom to change my mind and do different things.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, my parents always said, "You know what, you don't to
have to decide what you're going to be, ever. You can be something
different every day if you want."</TE>
<TE>   I'm just doing what they told me do: Do a little of this and a
little of that, don't get trapped.</TE>

<LD>   Frances FitzGerald is such an accomplished historian that anything
she writes about Vietnam is of great interest to me and others who
remember her 1972 classic, "Fire in the Lake." So her newest book,
"Vietnam: Spirits of the Earth," is important to those who have loved
that small country.</LD>
<TE>   "What struck me after my long absence was not so much how the
country has changed but the extent to which it has returned to
itself," she writes. FitzGerald first went to Vietnam in 1966 as a
journalist, and she reminds us that today, with its population
approaching 78 million, it remains one of the poorest and most
densely populated countries in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Americans who have returned to Vietnam often tell me how much the
country has changed: But that is because they spend time in Ho Chi
Minh City or Hanoi, not in the villages or near the rice fields. Cell
phones, Honda motorbikes and the flashy clothes of the young do not
tell the whole story.</TE>
<TE>   The old rituals persist: At a Vietnamese funeral, the mourners
leaving for the cemetery drop small gold papers so that the spirit of
the departed may find its way home. And to leave one's village is so
drastic and threatening that a bride on her journey to the groom's
village may take a talisman to ward off the evil spirits.</TE>
<TE>   FitzGerald reasons that although colonialism, war and revolution
have altered the shape of society and the way people think, Vietnam
has not changed as much as might be imagined--or as much as the
advocates of modernization, communist and non-communist, surely
hoped. The rites of ancestor worship are back, Buddhism is
flourishing and, to a lesser degree, so is Catholicism, she reports.</TE>
<TE>   Her text is divided into sections called "Mountains and Rivers,"
"Earth and Water," "Villages," "Families," "Women," "Buddhism" and
"Silk Robes and Cell Phones." There is an excellent chronology of
Vietnam's history, and Mary Cross' lovely photographs have
exceptionally interesting captions.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Page became famous in the pages of Michael Herr's
"Dispatches," in which he emerges as the lunatic orphan boy from
London who had worked in Laos and then drifted to Vietnam, where he
loved it. "He was twenty-three when I met him and I can remember
wishing that I'd known him when he was still young," Herr wrote. Few
expected Page, scarred and bent, to make it out of the war after
being wounded three times. But he did, half-dead, after the fourth
catastrophic injury to his brain.</TE>
<TE>   There are two new books by Page, whose name is already on eight
earlier ones. "The Mindful Moment," with his text, brings together
some of his harrowing pictures of the war and the rest from the
30-odd trips that he has made back, a man possessed. Some photographs
show the human wreckage of the war long after it was over, and they
take one's breath away. (I'm less interested in his writing than in
his photographs, which he will take as an insult.)</TE>
<TE>   The other book, "Another Vietnam," edited by Doug Niven, a fine
photo editor, and Chris Riley, presents photographs taken by the
Vietnamese we fought. Niven tracked down the old war photographers in
the north, and Page interviewed them.</TE>
<TE>   Many had poor equipment, and film was so scarce that one man was
able to shoot only 70 pictures during the entire war. They developed
film in bunkers or in the open air, using home-brewed chemicals. It
is astonishing and marvelous and wrenching to see their work.</TE>
<TE>   It is not the first time, however, that work by the photographers
with the "enemy" army has been published. In 1998, a book called
"Requiem" gave us the photographs of 135 men and women who were
killed doing their job. They died in the French war, the American war
and the Khmer Rouge attacks. "Requiem" was edited by Page, who had
the idea for the book, and by Horst Faas, the legendary Associated
Press photographer and bureau chief.</TE>
<TE>   No one else had ever thought of doing what they did. The
photographers were European, Vietnamese, Cambodian and, of course,
American. So much effort and so much love went into "Requiem" and
made it a masterpiece. "Another Vietnam" is a worthy reminder of Page
and Faas' great earlier effort.</TE>

<HD>The Lost Language of Cranes</HD>
<DH>THE BIRDS OF HEAVEN: Travels With Cranes, By Peter
Matthiessen, North Point Press: 350 pp., $27.50</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT FINCH</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the end of "The Birds of Heaven," the author stands in a savanna,
"staring at the first wild whooping crane born in the United States
in sixty years...." The moment represents the culmination of five
years of travel across four continents in pursuit of "the greatest of
the earth's flying birds," but it is a curiously subdued, even
ironic, triumph. The "wild" whooper chick is, in fact, the offspring
of pen-raised birds that are part of a nonmigratory flock
artificially and arduously established on the Florida peninsula,
which was never part of their natural range. Three weeks after the
sighting of this precarious symbol of ecological restoration, the
chick's decapitated and mangled body was found, the victim of a
bobcat.</LD>
<TE>   This scene encapsulates many of the sensibilities that inform this
latest book from Peter Matthiessen, whose body of work in the last
four decades is among the most impressive by any living American
writer. "The Birds of Heaven," like many of his best-known "nature
books" ("The Tree Where Man Was Born," "The Snow Leopard"), is
essentially a travel journal, chronicling his encounters with the
ever-shrinking remnants of Earth's wild places and pre-industrial
societies. His aim here was to see all 15 of the world's crane
species in the wild, birds that Matthiessen considers to be "umbrella
species," whose status is indicative of broad environmental health
and whose fate is thus linked to ours.</TE>
<TE>   In his work, Matthiessen has always been a romantic in impulse and
a realist in assessment. Though he claims at the outset that "a
curious optimism has opened in my heart like a strange blossom" for
the fate of Earth's wild creatures, the book as a whole does not bear
it out. There is a pervasive sadness even in its modest success
stories, a reluctant recognition of "the lengths to which man is
driven to salvage the last wild survivors of his own heedless course
on earth."</TE>
<TE>   Writing polemic and poetry at once is not an easy task, and
Matthiessen is at his best when writing about the cranes themselves.
His treatment of Japan's famous red-crowned cranes, for instance,
contains superb, luminous description that both demonstrates his
considerable literary powers and helps us understand why indigenous
cultures worldwide have made cranes symbols and heralds of the more
transcendent aspects of the human spirit:</TE>
<TE>   "Farther upriver, three red-black-white heads come up over a
snowbank on a bend. The heads turn in the shining light against a
dark background of steep wooded hillside already overtaken by
afternoon shadow. We are able to get closer, though not close.
Sun-silvered creatures, moving gracefully without haste and yet
swiftly in the black diamond shimmer of the Muri River--a
hallucinatory vision, a revelation, although what is revealed beyond
this silver moment of my life I do not know."</TE>
<TE>   In such passages, Matthiessen's prose rises to the lyric level of
Robert Bateman's exquisite and evocative paintings that accompany the
text. It also demonstrates nature writing's peculiar power to capture
and convey such "silver moments" of apprehension and identification
without explaining them, and thus to link our fate to that of Earth's
wild creatures with a persuasive power that no mere environmental
argument ever could.</TE>
<TE>   His optimism for preserving the world's cranes is guarded at best,
and the examples he offers are often problematical themselves. Of all
the Third World countries he visits, the small mountainous isolated
country of Bhutan best represents an oasis of ecological balance. But
this is largely the result of a government that he says "exercises
stiff control and keeps progress at bay to protect its people," a
political price that Matthiessen refuses to accept, even for the sake
of his beloved cranes. And though he takes heart from the tenacity by
which the more remote native cultures hang on to their traditional
land-based ways of life, it is clear that the most effective
preservation and restoration efforts have taken place in the Western
industrialized economies.</TE>
<TE>   In North America, for instance, conservation efforts in the last
century have brought the endangered sandhill crane's numbers back to
about 650,000 birds, making it by far the largest crane species. But
such progress takes an enormous amount of time, effort, money and
human meddling. Despite his love of unfettered wildness, Matthiessen
realizes that "the time is past when large rare creatures can recover
their numbers without man's strenuous intervention."</TE>
<TE>   If nothing else, one stands in awe of the author's stamina and
temerity in his global quest, but the book also contains many of
Matthiessen's characteristic virtues. As always, he has an impeccable
eye for recording the subtleties of landscape and weather, an
informed understanding of the broad cultural, historical and
political context of the places and people he encounters and an
extraordinary talent for serendipitous adventure. His novelistic eye
can capture the essence of a community's existence in a single stark
image, as when he describes the plight of overworked and ill-housed
sand miners in eastern China living in "a humble tent camp where
burned rice has turned cold in a black pot on a dead fire."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, "The Birds of Heaven" also exhibits some of the
pitfalls of a book that tries to cover so much ground and impart so
much information. After a while the surfeit of details begins to
obscure the narrative; the dozens of characters--biologists and
ornithologists, government representatives, local
conservationists--begin to blur in the reader's mind, and the
minutely delineated itinerary sometimes reads more like a roadmap
than a travel book.</TE>
<TE>   Curiously, the cranes themselves are oddly sidelined in the book's
initial chapters, serving more as searchlights that throw our
technological and anthropocentric global madness into stark relief.
His most lengthy and searing indictment is reserved for China and its
monumental Three Gorges Dam, "a grand folly of enormous cost," that
will destroy some of the most important remaining crane wintering
grounds and leave "social and environmental ruin in its wake." But
lest we feel too environmentally superior, he reminds us that "China
[is] the largest and most dangerous stepchild of the West's
unquestioning dream of progress as material consumption."</TE>
<TE>   In these passages, the book reads like a catalog of vanished and
vanishing superlatives: The Amur River, separating Siberia from
China, is "the largest free, wild, unbridged, undammed river left on
earth"; the arats, or Mongolian horsemen, are "the last true artisans
in an unlucky country"; even the cranes themselves are usually
introduced in elegiac terms, as when Matthiessen notes that the
Poyang lakes in eastern China contain "the last significant winter
flock of Siberian cranes, in effect, 99 percent of all G.
leucogeranus left on earth."</TE>
<TE>   So relentless are these litanies of disappearing, irreplaceable
natural treasures, so saturated is Matthiessen's book--in
places--with the inevitable sorrow of last things going and our
seemingly unstoppable rush to self-destruction that the reader is
grateful when Matthiessen attends to the birds themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The most powerful chapter in "The Birds of Heaven," as good as
anything Matthiessen has ever written, is "The Accidental Paradise,"
set on the Korean peninsula. Here his political passion and lyrical
powers combine to transcend the stated, or even the intended, aims of
the book. It begins in 1953, with the armistice at Panmunjom and the
establishment of the infamous DMZ, a heavily barricaded and fortified
buffer zone between North and South Korea that inadvertently created
"a no-man's-land several miles across and 149 miles long ... with
streams and springs that remained open all winter--the most fiercely
protected wildlife sanctuary anywhere on earth, and an accidental
paradise for the great cranes." Protected from shooting and the
encroaching development that has all but extirpated them elsewhere on
the peninsula, the magnificent and endangered red-crowned cranes
"know nothing of such man-made folly ... but they recognize a
sanctuary when they see one."</TE>
<TE>   A lesser writer might have been satisfied merely to have stumbled
on such a grand and stupefying irony, but Matthiessen is after
something deeper. There follows a wrenching account of the senseless
carnage of the Korean War, ending in a cry of despair: "In this
murderous epic when the human animal is destroying its own kind
almost everywhere on earth," he asks, "what hope can there be for
cranes and tigers?"</TE>
<TE>   The answer Matthiessen fashions is neither easy nor simple. For
once he ceases to castigate his own species and instead weeps for it.
He comes to a Zen-like acceptance of the futility of human striving
and a recognition that the great birds themselves are able to inspire
in us the saving spirit of reconciliation and dedication:</TE>
<TE>   "Watching these great and ancient birds flying the mists in a damp
winter cold where so many young soldiers quaked in fear and
wretchedness, watching them stalk silent fields laced with so much
human blood, one is beset by somber, confused feelings.... In the
dimming sun, we watched the birds drift down over the silent land. To
protect these cranes as harbingers of peace and morning calm--how
respectful that would be to the young soldiers on both sides who lost
their lives so horribly to no sane purpose."</TE>
<TE>   This is not hope so much as an intimation of redemption. The
profound and difficult lesson of "The Birds of Heaven" is to know
that whatever one does is likely to make no difference and that that
is the best reason of all to continue trying to do what is right.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From `The Birds of Heaven'</TE>
<TE>   On cloudless days in 1961, I rode atop the cargo of a truck bound
south across the desert from Khartoum to the villages of the blue
Nile, in the region of great swamps known as the Sudd. On the grassy
north-south track, as the truck rumbled past a drying slough in the
broad thornbush savanna, a wild two-note honking rose above the
clatter of the engine. On the bank, a legion of mighty birds--at
least two hundred--stood in sun-blazed ranks, bold white and gold and
chestnut wings set off by the dark slaty-gray body and long neck
topped by a red-black-and-white head crowned by a spray of elongated
feathers on the nape, like spun gold in the bright sun of
Equatoria--so vivid in their patterns, so astonishing, that even
today, the image of those birds opens like a bright flower in my
memory. (How wonderful it seems that even the boldest colors of
creation are never garish or mismatched, as they are so often in the
work of man.)</TE>

<LD>GOOD AS ANY</LD>
<LD>   Stories</LD>
<LD>   By Timothy A. Westmoreland</LD>
<TE>   Harcourt: 276 pp., $24</TE>
<TE>   Straw, the narrator of "Darkening of the World," one of the
stories that make up Timothy A. Westmoreland's impressive debut
collection, has a curious affliction: He can't sleep because he
continually laughs himself awake. His friend Pork, who owns a
dachshund named Heidegger, advises him: "You have fallen out of
Being.... Being with a capital 'B.'" Westmoreland's short fictions
are shaggy-dog stories full of startling, sage-like observations and
predicaments that are as improbable as they are deeply familiar. In
"Strong at the Broken Places," a dying man embarks on an unusual home
improvement project by ripping out his ceiling and jury-rigging a
planetarium. "Good as Any" tells of a man and his music-loving
English bull terrier, Rose Marie, whom he gets along with better than
the various humans in his life. Buckley Miller, the blue-collar New
England contractor of "They Have Numbered All My Bones," recalls his
first love at Columbia University and his recent ill-fated attempt to
sleuth her whereabouts at the Emily Dickinson homestead. And, in
"Winter Island," a rural community suffering a drought are surprised
to see what look like pigs flying away from a neighbor's failing
farm.</TE>
<TE>   Zeroing in on the surreal and the mundane, and as quietly intense
as they are exuberant, Westmoreland's stories have novelistic
momentum and heft; they're slices of life that, before our eyes,
evolve into stirring American landscapes.</TE>

<TE>   JUST LIKE BEAUTY</TE>
<TE>   By Lisa Lerner</TE>
<TE>   Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux:</TE>
<TE>   282 pp., $24</TE>
<TE>   The citizens of Deansville eat Krispee Stix at Just Like Meat
Planet restaurants, dance with abandon to the boroonga, listen to the
morning pollution report over breakfast and visit gastroenterology
salons with alarming frequency. In Deansville, "the boys are too busy
comparing the blades of their compact scythes and contestant damage
reports, and the girls are saving their romance for Electric
Polyrubber Man."</TE>
<TE>   Edie Stein is a 14-year-old Deansville resident gunning to take
the crown at the annual Feminine Woman of Conscience Pageant. Her mom
is a nightmare stage mother; her dad is a Willy Loman-like topiary
peddler. There's a plague of grasshoppers on the loose, and a roving
band of boys known as the Blowtorchers are doing unspeakable things
to pretty girls. Welcome to the way-out wacky world of "Just Like
Beauty," Lisa Lerner's rambunctious first novel, in which poor Edie
is forced to run the gantlet from one bizarre in-your-face episode to
the next.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Lerner's cleverness, we quickly recognize Deansville's
glaring turf as the increasingly over-familiar, dystopian Americana
distilled to perfection by fiction writers George Saunders and Donald
Antrim. Not that Lerner doesn't have her own devastating take on this
semi-futuristic territory. One just wonders how much off-the-wall is
enough and if DDT jokes really work in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   And even though Lerner is sly enough to nearly make us care about
Edie, "Just Like Beauty's" blaring pageantry rattles the windows:
It's like having 50 tap dancers high-stepping across your living
room.</TE>

<TE>   By Nega Mezlekia</TE>
<TE>   Picador USA: 256 pp., $23</TE>
<TE>   Nega Mezlekia left his native Ethiopia in 1983 and chronicled his
boyhood there amid upheaval and famine in the widely praised memoir
"Notes From the Hyena's Belly." In his first novel, Mezlekia returns
to his homeland but goes back even further, to the 18th century, when
Ethiopia was still Abyssinia.</TE>
<TE>   This is an Africa rarely glimpsed: not quite colonial and not yet
modern. Mezlekia's Abyssinia is both feudal and ancient, pagan and
biblical, and it often bears uncomfortable parallels to our own time.
His story is about a clandestine affair between a young court
entertainer named Gudu, born of slaves but with a precocious flair
for language, and Aster, the only daughter of the imperious Count
Ashenafi.</TE>
<TE>   Aster is rebellious, beautiful and endowed with strange powers: At
age 5, she walked through a solid wall; as a teenager, "she told
riddles that only the unborn could unravel, poems that only the dead
could compose." Mezlekia chronicles this potentially deadly romance
against a backdrop of rebellious vassals, court intrigues, military
muscle flexing, Inquisition-inspired intolerance and tantalizing
hints about Gudu's actual parentage. As Gudu rises to become a rebel
leader against the emperor, and Aster spends her days under house
arrest, we're reminded, in Mezlekia's seductive prose, of Herodotus
and his credulity-teasing sagas of love, bloodlines and power. "The
God Who Begat a Jackal" is a tall tale imbued with documentary detail
and the weight of history, and its story lines are as ancient as they
are timeless.</TE>

<LD>VIOLENCE, NUDITY, ADULT CONTENT</LD>
<LD>   By Vince Passaro</LD>
<LD>   Simon &amp; Schuster: 298 pp., $24</LD>
<TE>   Vince Passaro has been writing short fiction and essays for
magazines for a long time. This comes with a stylistic price tag, and
fans have wondered if he could keep it up for a longer work, say, a
novel. The answer is yes. This reader was dragged kicking and
screaming through "Violence, Nudity, Adult Content." Didn't like the
title, don't like novels about lawyers, besides which, most fiction
set in upper-middle-class New York presents all of the myopia and
none of the tender joys of that city. It turns out that "Violence,
Nudity, Adult Content" is not only a novel about urban rage, it's
also a novel about tenderness and where to find it.</TE>
<TE>   The curtain opens on two beleaguered archetypes of our time: the
overworked man, William Riordan, and the overworked mommy, his wife,
Ellie. Romance is a thing of the past. Everyone has forgotten why and
how they got into this rat race. Passaro takes time to describe the
lives of his main characters. He steps back in time to show Ellie and
William meeting and having children, so that our understanding of how
much their lives have changed is clear. So clear that we identify
with one or the other: the working woman thrown into full-time
motherhood or the overworked lawyer alienated in his own home.</TE>
<TE>   Then Passaro takes us deeper into their rage and fear. The deeper
he goes, the harder it becomes to identify with one or the other.
Passaro sneaks up on you with art, meaning--in the finest, most
useful sense of the word--confusion. There's another character in the
book, a young African American woman named Ursula, also full of rage,
who has been raped by two men, one black and one white. Our regular
guy, out-of-it lawyer William is given the case. He's got one other
he's working on, defending a very rich cross-dressing jerk who has
murdered his wife and driven the body (with his two young kids
sitting in the car) to a local dumpster. Ursula sends William regular
e-mails that tell her story and the story of the city: the oozing,
coagulating sex and fury of people living in codependent density,
where everyone has got to keep it together or the whole experiment
falls apart.</TE>
<TE>   William's wife gets sick of his absentee fatherhood. She's a
little hormonal from bearing two children in 21/2 years, so one night
she sticks a fork in his cheek. She asks him to leave. Then William
experiences several moral dilemmas, all job-threatening, should he
choose to do the right thing. He's Mallomar Man: together on the
outside, but mushy and sensitive on the inside. Passaro captures the
tiredness of his characters beautifully and also their animal panic.
The children of the cross-dresser beg William not to return them to
their father, even if he wins the case, and William finds a way. As a
reward for recovering his lost principles, he is allowed back into
the family fold (drawing blood with a fork is one of the lesser
crimes in the book).</TE>
<TE>   Passaro has a hard time creating different voices for his
characters. William is a self-conscious smart-aleck, and it's OK to
have one or two of those per book, but when all the characters share
that Woody Allen tone, it begins to look viral. It's a big nervous
breakdown of a book, and everyone feels better at the end, except, of
course, the murderer and the rapists. Which is as it should be.</TE>

<TE>   THE DEEPER WOUND</TE>
<TE>   Recovering the Soul</TE>
<TE>   From Fear and Suffering</TE>
<TE>   By Deepak Chopra</TE>
<TE>   Harmony Books: 206 pp., $16</TE>
<TE>   Put your assumptions aside for a moment and consider this man.
Deepak Chopra is in the business of comforting people. Many people
seek his advice. Chopra is a leader in a soul recovery movement that
has many leaders and followers. He teaches that we share a common
soul and that the answers we seek can be found inside of us. Nothing
new here. So not new, in fact, that it can feel a little
shrink-wrapped and processed when you read it. He offers tricks and
pathways for breaking through the cacophony of life to get to that
quiet place where all the answers supposedly are. This book,
unfortunately, was written, literally, the week after Sept. 11. One
wishes he had waited a little to watch how pain percolated through
us, but his intention was to speak to the question all religions
tackle: Why is there suffering? "The Deeper Wound" is meant to offer
a 100-step way of transcending fear-turned-anxiety-turned-anger into
compassion. Each step is a meditation, to be digested one per day.</TE>
<TE>   It's a different process, reading a book that is more about the
message than about the writing. There's so much less struggle than
there is with fiction or literature. Chopra is one of the clearer,
more practical New Agers writing today. He makes the message plain,
so that more than 10 people can absorb it. He has more humility than
most "I have the answer" yogis. So look at Chopra as a kind of
lullaby before bedtime. For grown-ups.</TE>

<HD>Evolution for Beginners?</HD>
<DH>WHAT EVOLUTION IS, By Ernst Mayr, Basic Books: 336 pp., $22</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAT SHIPMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1928, when the Cyclops Mountains of New Guinea were mostly
unexplored by Western scientists, an undaunted biologist named Ernst
Mayr undertook the first field survey of the indigenous birds of the
area. It was astonishing work for many reasons, not least because the
region was forbidding and remote and reportedly inhabited by
ferocious tribal peoples. That experience, and others to follow, gave
Mayr a grasp of the breadth and elegance of evolution in action few
could rival.</LD>
<LD>   By the 1930s and 1940s, Mayr, together with G.G. Simpson and
Theodosius Dobzhansky, was re-creating evolutionary theory and its
applications. By the 1960s, Mayr was writing classics of evolutionary
theory such as the one my generation cut its intellectual teeth on,
"Animal Species and Evolution." He has sorted out deeply tangled
taxonomic muddles, written wisely on the hows and whys of evolution
and illuminated many of the subtleties of evolution throughout his
career. At 97, Mayr is now the Grand Old Man of evolutionary theory
and the last living architect of the so-called new synthesis that
brought Darwinian theory--or more properly, theories, as he points
out--together with population genetics and paleontology.</LD>
<TE>   Thus it was with enormous anticipation that I opened "What
Evolution Is," Mayr's latest work. It is touted in its preface as "a
concise, reader-friendly account" of evolution. At this late phase of
his career (long may it continue), Mayr proposes to give us a book
meant for "anyone, biologist or not, who simply wants to know more
about evolution ... [for] those who accept evolution, but are in
doubt as to whether the Darwinian explanation is the correct one ...
And finally [for] creationists who want to know more about the
current paradigm of evolutionary science if for no other reason than
to be better able to argue against it." Mayr announces that the
existing volumes written by others are too specialized, "too
technical, and use too much jargon" (they are) and his book will be
different.</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, it is not. Mayr starts off well with a section called "What
is the evidence for evolution?" that is clearly written but does not
answer the question. Instead, he simply pronounces that the evidence
for evolution is "now quite overwhelming," refers readers to other
works where the evidence is actually discussed and reviews the types
of evidence that have been studied. Mayr's explanations and
definitions are deliciously concise. Of course, the shortcoming of
concise definitions is that they fail to provide operational criteria
that would let the reader actually use them. Still, Mayr's
explanations of the basic principles are admirably clear and that is
the first step to proposing and agreeing upon operational criteria.</TE>
<TE>   What of Mayr's avowed readership? All too often readers are
expected to take his word for it. Mayr pronounces that evolution is
"irrefutable" and that "there is no other natural explanation than
evolution for the facts presented [here]," assertions that are
unlikely to change the minds of those inclined to endorse
supernatural or godly explanations for the way things are on Earth.
For the non-specialist believer in evolution who wants to learn more
or hoping for clarity, there is a different problem. Mayr has a very
optimistic opinion of the knowledge of his readership, or else he
credits them with a great willingness to spend time with the glossary
and a good encyclopedia before reading on.</TE>
<TE>   In a brilliant section of the book, for example, in which Mayr
takes what we know of genetic variation and inheritance and boils it
down to 17 basic principles, the concepts are stated and explained in
a mere two pages with four figures. This is a tour de force: Every
biology teacher, every undergraduate in a biology class and
particularly every graduate student in an evolutionary discipline
must read and memorize these principles. But for the general reader,
they can be stiff going. Principle 16 reads: "A gene has a complex
structure, consisting of exons, introns, and flanking sequences (Fig.
5.4)." The inquisitive reader has perhaps never heard of exons,
introns or flanking sequences and finds these topics are not included
in the index or the glossary.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, too, this same reader does not know what a gene looks
like or how much of the more familiar DNA molecule a single gene
comprises. Turning dutifully to Fig. 5.4, the reader finds three
horizontally oriented strips colored in shades of gray and labeled
with the terms "upstream," "downstream," "Poly-A addition site,"
"initial transcript (pre-mRNA)," "5' Cap," "leader," "start codon,"
"stop codon," "trailer," "Poly-A tail." Yet none of these terms is
defined. The caption identifies the source of the figure and says:
"Structure of a eukaryotic gene, with its exons, introns, and
flanking sequences." This is not helpful to the uninitiated. In fact,
most of the figures have been borrowed from other
publications--something nearly everyone writing for a general public
does--but they are not well-explained and not always good
illustrations of the point.</TE>
<TE>   Less satisfying still is Mayr's presentation of a number of
specific topics, such as his capsule summary of the debate over the
dinosaurian origin of birds. It owes much to a minority view that has
been seriously undermined in recent years by the discovery of
numerous species of feathered dinosaurs. To discuss the evolutionary
origin of birds and not to mention these new finds is
incomprehensible. A chapter on human evolution is equally dated: Mayr
discusses none of the hominid species discovered after 1990, though
he acknowledges there have been at least six since 1994. There is no
earthly excuse for this, not even Mayr's dumbfounding assertion that
"no one has yet attempted to properly place them [the new species] in
a new hominid phylogenetic tree." (My friends and colleagues who have
been responsible for describing and naming these species will be
greatly disconcerted to know that the phylogenetic diagrams in their
papers in Nature, Science and similar journals do not constitute
proper attempts to construct a new phylogenetic tree for the
hominids.)</TE>
<TE>   The problem may be that Mayr relies particularly for his
information on a 1996 book about human evolution by a well-known
expert on fossil shells, Steven Stanley, and on a 2001 article by a
behavioral scientist who studies great apes, Richard Wrangham.
Wrangham and Stanley are able and well-respected scientists, but
their writings are not the best choices for breadth, balance of
coverage, or up-to-date accuracy about human evolution. As a result I
can't recommend it as an overview of human evolution.</TE>
<TE>   Does this mean that the book is a failure, the revelation of an
aging scientist who has lost his grip? Not at all. It is an excellent
book in its way, albeit one that is too technical for its intended
audience. Nonetheless, it is possibly the last book we will ever see
by this man who has an extraordinary grasp of the larger pattern of
evolution as we currently understand it. When Mayr was a German
student in the early 20th century, professors professed unchallenged,
and everyone else obediently believed the words of the great men. Now
Mayr--unquestionably a great man--attempts to follow suit and
convince by personal authority and assertion; this approach may not
sit well with 21st century readers.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Mayr has told us "what evolution is," as he has been
telling us for more than 60 years. I will not keep his book for his
summary of the evolution of specific groups, which is flawed, but for
this glimpse of how a great evolutionist sees the grand and
ever-changing scheme of life. For that alone, this book has earned
its place on my bookshelf, where it will stay within handy reach.</TE>

<DH>EUGEN WEBER KILLING THE SHADOWS, By Val McDermid, St.

Stories, By Frederick Forsyth, St. Martin's Press:  368 pp., $24.95</DH>

<AU>EUGEN WEBER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>   Mysteries, thank God, flourish in overtilled fields, along with
weeds and furze and compost puffs that encourage more to grow. The
lusher the gore and menace, the more appetizing the fare; and Val
McDermid serves plenty of both in a spicy sauce of suspense and
apprehension.</LD>
<TE>   In "Killing the Shadows," serial slaughterers and copycat killers
are on the loose in England, Scotland, Ireland and Spain. One
bloodthirsty loon among these birdwit nuts hunts down conspicuous
crime and mystery writers; and that draws Fiona Cameron into the
story because her lover, Kit Martin, a prominent thriller spinner, is
among those whom the maniac threatens.</TE>
<TE>   An academic psychologist, Cameron uses computer technology to
track serial offenders. Powerful new programs that crunch numbers
ever faster have accelerated criminal investigations. Cameron
harnesses them to meld crime linkage, psychological profiling and the
sort of geographical profiling that identifies clusters of crimes and
allows her to chart probable areas where perps live, work--and perp.
Her services were used but her advice ignored by London's
Metropolitan Police, which nowadays clears up only one-quarter of
crimes committed and obtains convictions on just 9% of those.</TE>
<TE>   Soured by British police bungling, Cameron vows to stay away from
them and keeps busy aiding Spanish cops in pursuing a murderous
crackpot in Toledo. But the threat to Kit's life summons all her
talents and wears down antipathy to police. Her quarry's slimy trail
will lead from London to Dorset to Edinburgh and to the Highlands
north of Inverness, where the explosive finale plays out.</TE>
<TE>   As old ads used to say (when it still needed saying), "Never
underestimate the power of a woman." Nor her determination either,
nor McDermid's tantalizing talents in defining a world of peremptory
laptops, chirpy cell phones and billowing faxes. My only criticism is
this cavil: that she afflicts her heroine with the specious notion
that "she deserved some sort of punishment for taking the life of
another human being," when some so-called humans are better dispensed
with.</TE>
<TE>   But that's small chiding beside the credit for a canny, varied and
tortuous voyage through the busy realms of computers and of the
people attached to them.</TE>
<TE>   Frederick Forsyth is the author of 10 page-turners that include
such bestsellers as "The Day of the Jackal" and "The Odessa File." He
also believes, like his namesake Federico Fellini, that reality
distorts. Forsyth's realities are false fronts: Apparent factuality
is there to ensnare; straightforward narrative decoys unwary readers
into authorial ambush.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Veteran," he offers not one more novel but five long short
stories cleverly crafted to string us along to the sting in their
tail. All, in other words, are about deception, concealment,
revelation. All but one are about scams--a term related to the
Indo-European root skam or skem, meaning "to hide." Forsyth's
characters hide their doings and deceptions or else they're blind to
misapprehensions of their own.</TE>
<TE>   The title story, about the killing of an elderly man on a London
street and how his murderers meet justice, is a model of the genre.
So is the second, about art scammers who are scammed. Two more--one
about an alleged miracle in Siena during the Renaissance, the other
about drug smugglers on a plane from Bangkok to Heathrow--although
piquant enough, are less substantial.</TE>
<TE>   The last story is a matter of taste. Played out in America's
mountain West, it begins in Gen. Custer's mid-19th century and ends
as a contemporary ghost-love story that testifies to the everydayness
of the uncanny. I didn't think I'd like it, but I did. And you might
too.</TE>
<TE>   Lucid, vivid and delightfully readable, Forsyth is a master
word-spinner and a master of meticulous detail, too. Aggressively
authentic, his details are sometimes irrelevant, used more to spin
out the story than to clue in the reader. But the long march from
scam to setup to comeuppance is worth it in the end, when the spell
lifts and the spin's betrayed.</TE>

<HD>Halliburton Rejecting Asbestos Settlements</HD>
<DH>Courts:  Company's reversal of strategy opens it to a new
round of lawsuits and investor jitters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since Halliburton Co.'s stock plunged by more than a third last month
in reaction to fears over its asbestos-related liabilities, the
oilfield services giant has been busy doing damage control, assuring
investors that it will maintain its aggressive stance on the lawsuits
and that it is adequately insured.</LD>
<LD>   Its latest effort, a conference call with investors Tuesday, sent
share prices up last week; Halliburton closed Friday at $14.34  on
the New York Stock Exchange, up 43%  for the week.</LD>
<LD>   But some analysts and plaintiffs' lawyers say they are not
convinced that the company's tough stance on injury and death claims
will keep the lid on its liabilities. Moody's Investors Service Inc.
also chimed in, cutting Halliburton's debt ratings two levels based
on the risk of increased asbestos costs.</LD>
<TE>   A close look at Halliburton's legal strategy shows that the
company is engaged in a high-stakes game of chicken that illuminates
Wall Street's growing nervousness about asbestos liabilities facing
hundreds of companies.</TE>
<TE>   By canceling settlements negotiated by Harbison-Walker
Refractories, with which Halliburton subsidiary Dresser Industries
shares liability, Halliburton has opened itself to a wave of new
litigation. Scores of previously settled cases have been refiled
against Dresser, with the added charge of breach of contract,
exposing the company to the risk of large jury awards.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, recent judgments totaling more than $130 million
have significantly raised Halliburton's profile among plaintiffs'
lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   Halliburton executives say the Dallas-based company settled 36,000
asbestos claims last year for slightly less than its average historic
cost of $750 each, that insurers picked up all but $220, and that the
management remained committed to fighting unreasonable settlement
demands.</TE>
<TE>   "We have got a strategy of being willing to take every single case
to trial if we have to, but last year ended up in trials that
concluded in verdicts in only 17," Chairman Dave Lesar said last
week. "We settle, on average, 140 cases in a positive way every day.
We don't put a press release out every time that happens."</TE>
<TE>   Although Halliburton wants investors to look at the company's
record, its unresolved claims, which totaled 274,000 at the end of
last year and climb by several thousand each quarter, are causing
jitters on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   "The risk of asbestos litigation ballooning out of control remains
substantial and the ultimate liability difficult to quantify," said
A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. analyst Poe Fratt. "High awards could
increase the rate of new claims, increase the settlement demands of
plaintiffs and increase the number of cases that are tried in courts
where the outcomes are extremely difficult to predict."</TE>
<TE>   Asbestos exposure doesn't threaten Halliburton's viability, USB
Warburg analyst James Stone said. "But we do understand where the
concern and the fear comes from, and we also understand the
reluctance of investors to make a bet on an issue that is so
difficult to game as asbestos."</TE>
<TE>   A previously settled case refiled against Halliburton's Dresser
Industries illustrates the source of some of the market's fears about
liability among corporate America.</TE>
<TE>   Trained as a mechanical engineer, Tom Hazen spent seven years in
the 1960s working in industrial plants, including a steel mill in
Fontana, where he believed he was  exposed to asbestos. Hazen later
earned an MBA and spent the next three decades as an executive with a
medical devices company. But in May 2000, doctors diagnosed advanced
mesothelioma, a fatal cancer of the lining of the chest cavity.</TE>
<TE>   Hazen, then 58, sued several companies, alleging that they shared
responsibility for exposing him to products that contained asbestos,
that they knew the products were unsafe and that they failed to warn
him. Those products included HW Castable 10, an industrial furnace
cement made by Harbison.</TE>
<TE>   Harbison and RHI,  the Austrian holding company that now runs it,
declined to comment on the case, as did Halliburton.</TE>
<TE>   Plaintiffs' lawyers said Harbison had maintained a low-profile in
asbestos litigation by settling such claims, as they did in Hazen's
case. Hazen got the  settlement proposal while he was in a hospital,
according to his wife and lawyer. He summoned a notary to his bedside
and signed it, agreeing to drop his lawsuit in exchange for a payment
he believed would help his wife  survive financially.</TE>
<TE>   "It was total relief for my husband that he was able to leave
something behind for us, and he died 24 days later," Sandra Hazen
said.</TE>
<TE>   But the company failed to live up to its end of the deal, she
said. In August, Sandra Hazen joined more than 100 other people suing
Harbison to recover asbestos settlements totaling $16 million, an
average of $147,000 per claim. Because Dresser Industries ran
Harbison as a division from 1967 to 1992, they also sued Dresser.</TE>
<TE>   "The question for Dresser Industries and its stockholders: Do they
want to pay the $16 million or do they want to risk going to a Texas
jury where we will seek not only that amount but the actual damages
in each case and punitive damages?" said Roger Worthington, a lawyer
representing Sandra Hazen and others.Last year, a deal broke down
that would have had Harbison indemnifying Dresser against asbestos
claims filed after 1992. Halliburton then took an active role in
defending 125,000 suits that name both companies, Halliburton said.
Those claims include as many as 2,500 in some stage of settlement.</TE>
<TE>   In a similar case, Halliburton is appealing a Texas judge's ruling
that Dresser must pay a set of settlements Harbison made with 100
asbestos claimants that total $35.7 million, an average cost per
claim of $357,000.</TE>
<TE>   "We obviously think we have a right to a trial," said Cedric
Burgher, Halliburton's vice president for investor relations. "If we
are going to enter into a settlement with anybody, we have a right to
negotiate ourselves." Burgher also said Halliburton had not seen
evidence of illness among the 100 plaintiffs.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs' lawyer said his clients are sick. "During the
pendency of this appeal, I will guarantee you that some of my clients
will die, never having gotten their compensation," said Glen W.
Morgan.</TE>
<TE>   Halliburton went to trial in 17 cases last year. The company
persuaded judges to throw out 35 cases before trial. Of the 17 that
went to trial, 11 ended with small or no judgments against
Halliburton. Two resulted in judgments of less than $5 million, which
Halliburton is appealing, along with the four market-shaking
judgments previously reported by the company.</TE>
<TE>   "We won most of those," Halliburton's Lesar said. "So anyone who
takes the large jury awards that we have under appeal and
extrapolates them to the entire claim pool is just doing it wrong."</TE>
<TE>   But the nature of Halliburton's asbestos exposure changed when it
took on the Harbison claims last year. Until then, most of
Halliburton's asbestos exposure was from the use of materials
containing asbestos on projects run by its construction unit.</TE>
<TE>   Juries tend to judge the manufacturers of asbestos products, such
as Harbison, more harshly than companies that were users of
asbestos-containing products, lawyers said. As such, the recent
verdicts may be more relevant than Halliburton's past experience.
Plaintiffs' lawyers said they are not sure  whether Halliburton is
factoring that into their evaluation of claims, noting that cases got
more difficult to settle after Halliburton stepped in.</TE>

<HD>Cranes Lift Upstart Above Competition</HD>
<DH>Machinery: By bidding low and building alliances, a Chinese
company has secured major contracts in American ports.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM REITERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Beneath autumn skies, a freighter carrying four of the world's
largest container-cargo cranes glided into San Francisco Bay,
squeezing under the Golden Gate Bridge en route to the docks of
Oakland.</LD>
<LD>   That day in the fall of 2000 was a spectacular, but not singular,
triumph for an upstart Chinese company that dominates manufacturing
of the most important piece of maritime machinery other than ships.</LD>
<LD>   Just two months earlier, the Shanghai Zhenhua Port Machinery Co.,
known in the industry as ZPMC, had secured a contract to provide as
many as 20 similar cranes to Long Beach for $143.5 million--the
port's biggest pact ever.</LD>
<TE>   ZPMC's ascendancy is remarkable, but the politically astute
company has left a wake of disputes from coast to coast, including
labor strife, litigation and claims of defects in the cranes.</TE>
<TE>   The story of ZPMC's rise illustrates the gathering, and at times
controversial, economic might of China, as it dominates new sectors
of global commerce. It also speaks to the intense worldwide
competition among ports that buy $1 billion in bigger and faster
cranes each year to help draw container-cargo trade in everything
from auto parts to athletic shoes.</TE>
<TE>   After being launched in 1992, ZPMC took just six years to become
the leading maker of ship-to-shore cranes, and the company has
remained at or near the top.</TE>
<TE>   In U.S. ports, where the company sold dozens of towering gantry
cranes for $5 million to $7 million, the formula for success was
simple: Bid low and build alliances.</TE>
<TE>   Using Chinese labor and its own fleet of delivery ships to cut
costs, ZPMC consistently underbid the competition by hundreds of
thousands of dollars or more to sell machines that look like giant
erector sets and hoist tons like toys.</TE>
<TE>   To gain entree to the American maritime fraternity and navigate
arcane bidding processes, ZPMC hired former port officials from Long
Beach and Vancouver, Canada, as sales consultants.</TE>
<TE>   ZPMC forged particularly close ties to the publisher of an African
American community newspaper in Oakland who once headed that city's
port commission. And the company sold its first cranes in Miami by
forming an unusual joint venture with the port's crane
concessionaire.</TE>
<TE>   But controversy accompanied the sales.</TE>
<TE>   In Florida, a competitor accused ZPMC of stealing its design, and
ZPMC's partner was indicted on unrelated corruption charges.</TE>
<TE>   In California, unions accused the company of stealing American
dock jobs and of unsafe labor practices such as wearing bamboo hard
hats. And state safety officials fined ZPMC for safety violations
after a young Chinese worker was killed in an accident.</TE>
<TE>   In both states, ports have grappled with worrisome and
time-consuming problems with the cranes, the most recent involving
bent crane legs and foundations in Long Beach and Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   ZPMC officials defend the quality of their cranes. And port
officials who have invested millions of public dollars in ZPMC cranes
tend to dismiss the problems. They praise the company's on-time
delivery record and low prices that one port engineer said make them
"look like heroes."</TE>
<TE>   "They made a lot of crane manufacturers wonder why they are in the
crane business," said Terry Smalley, head of the Port of Oakland's
crane unit, noting that one ZPMC bid was $1 million less per crane,
or almost 15% less than the closest competitor.</TE>
<TE>   The modern crane is an engineering marvel--a bridge-like steel
structure with powerful electric motors, hydraulic systems and
computerized controls that allow operators to pluck dozens of
containers an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Ports around the world have been ordering ever-larger cranes to
serve freighters that are too wide to navigate the Panama Canal. The
new cranes can weigh 1,000 tons or more and lift the equivalent of
several dozen luxury cars.</TE>
<TE>   In selling more than 200 ship-to-shore cranes and 300 smaller
rubber tire gantry cranes, ZPMC has become a recognized leader in an
industry once ruled by U.S. companies and later by Europeans,
Japanese and South Koreans.</TE>
<TE>   Although operators say ZPMC cranes are fast and productive, some
California mechanics say they have experienced problems with oil
seals, welds, gear boxes and hydraulic systems, and sometimes have
trouble getting spare parts. Even so, they say down time has not been
out of the ordinary.</TE>
<TE>   But the big question for many is how long the cranes will hold up.</TE>
<TE>   "The question is how could a Johnny-come-lately crane manufacturer
get the expertise and be selected," said a former ZPMC competitor,
Bill Reynolds of Harbor Industrial Services Corp. in Long Beach. "The
answer is they ... do not have the expertise. There are things about
ZPMC cranes that already are showing premature signs of failure.
[Cranes] should last 20 years, and many of us in the business think
they won't last 10."</TE>
<TE>   The idea of selling Chinese cranes in U.S. ports began 11 years
ago around a bridge table in the East Bay hills, said Frank Wan, a
former Chinese crane engineer and UC Berkeley business student. He
was discussing maritime affairs with attorney Thomas Berkley, a
former president of the Oakland port commission and a nationally
known maritime figure.</TE>
<TE>   "I said I was thinking we could work together to sell some
cranes," recounted Wan, who served as a ZPMC consultant in several
ports. "And he said it was a pretty good idea."</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, Wan met Berkley at his building in downtown
Oakland and was handed a key to his own office. Then he called a
relative who was a government official in Shanghai. "I told him an
American, Mr. Berkley, was willing to help us sell cranes in the U.S.
market," Wan said. "And he said ... we need a sales plan."</TE>
<TE>   By 1993, Berkley and Wan had helped sell two Chinese cranes to the
Port of Vancouver and Wan's relative had become president of the
fledgling company known as ZPMC. The majority of its stock was held
by government-controlled China Harbor Engineering Co. and two wholly
owned subsidiaries--one an engineering company, the other a
century-old port machinery plant in Shanghai.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Miami: A First Foothold</TE>
<TE>   ZPMC did not land its first U.S. sale until it teamed up with
Calvin Grigsby, a nationally known investment banker and major
Democratic Party donor.</TE>
<TE>   It was a natural match: Grigsby had worked for Berkley years
earlier during law school and considered him a role model as a
successful African American attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Grigsby also had strong ties to Miami-Dade County's Port of Miami.
He arranged port bond financing through his San Francisco company,
Fiscal Funding, and ran the port's crane operations through a
subsidiary, Fiscal Operations.</TE>
<TE>   He figured out that cranes could be fabricated almost anywhere
labor was cheap. So when the port wanted to buy more cranes, Grigsby
saw an opportunity. "I felt I could find somebody [to build the
cranes] and bid it myself," he said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Grigsby said he worked on deals with ZPMC and its parent company
while accompanying Commerce Secretary Ron Brown on a 1994 trade
mission to China.</TE>
<TE>   During bidding in Miami, records show, Grigsby listed himself and
others who managed the port's crane operations as lobbyists for a
ZPMC/Fiscal Funding joint venture. The dual role, Grigsby recalled,
wasn't a problem because "There's no such concept as conflict if
you're a private party."</TE>
<TE>   The Grigsby-led team prevailed with a low price of $24.7 million
for four cranes.</TE>
<TE>   "We have our friends who are helping us," Liu Qi Zhong, ZPMC's
deputy general manager, said by phone from Shanghai. "But basically
we won [contracts] through international bidding. We did not win a
single contract by political effect."</TE>
<TE>   After ZPMC won the contract, the port's project engineer, Blaise
Lionelli, went to Shanghai to check out ZPMC facilities along the
Yangtze River. The consultant found the engineering reassuring, but
in a February 1994 report he described the erection site as
"cluttered" and likened the pace to a "fire drill."</TE>
<TE>   The delivery of the first two cranes in 1995 did not inspire
confidence. A mishap in the Panama Canal caused salt water damage,
forcing ZPMC to replace 20 electric motors.</TE>
<TE>   Acrimonious disputes erupted that year.</TE>
<TE>   Kocks Crane &amp; Marine Co., a competitor, filed a federal lawsuit in
Pittsburgh, alleging that the ZPMC cranes were copies of six Kocks
cranes previously built for the port.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint, later dismissed because the judge ruled it was
filed in the wrong jurisdiction, included parts of a deposition by
Lionelli. He alleged that the ZPMC project manager told him that
Fiscal Operations had provided drawings to ZPMC and that Wan had
taken them to China.</TE>
<TE>   ZPMC officials denied stealing the plans and said their cranes
look like Kocks' because that's what the port specifications
demanded.</TE>
<TE>   Wan denied taking or transporting any Kocks plans. "I did take
five or six engineers to the Port of Miami, and we got on the cranes
and took pictures and a lot of measurements," he said in an
interview. "We did copy the Kocks design" and improved on it.</TE>
<TE>   In December 1995, Lionelli told port officials that the ZPMC
cranes had unapproved welds, instead of bolts, on a critical boom
support and that it could be dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   A port consultant concluded that the problem could reduce the
cranes' life expectancy by 40%, but ZPMC and a Shanghai university
study said the cranes were sound.</TE>
<TE>   Another problem surfaced in a February 1996 accident that caused
more than $150,000 in damage to one crane. While the operator was
lifting a container, the load tipped sharply and fell to the ground.
Consultants for the port and ZPMC said the probable cause was a
control system supplied by a ZPMC subcontractor, who rejected that
explanation.</TE>
<TE>   The port withheld $600,000 in payments to ZPMC because of the boom
support issue and problems with personnel elevators, brakes and
paint. The dispute has dragged on for more than five years, with port
officials rejecting ZPMC demands for payment and ZPMC suing.</TE>
<TE>   Port officials now say they are "comfortable" with the boom
supports, and ZPMC is completing what port officials call "warranty"
work at no charge.</TE>
<TE>   While the dispute played out, Grigsby, ZPMC's partner, was
indicted along with former port director Carmen Lunetta on federal
charges of misappropriating more than $1 million in port crane usage
fees. ZPMC was not implicated.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that prosecutors presented "substantial evidence of greed
and public corruption" at the port, the trial judge acquitted Grigsby
and Lunetta in June 1999 after concluding the allegedly stolen funds
were not the county's.</TE>
<TE>   Grigsby is no longer associated with ZPMC, which recently bid on
another Miami contract and came in $1.7 million a crane lower than
its competitor.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oakland:  A Surprising Find</TE>
<TE>   On April 1, 1998, officials from ZPMC and Oakland gathered in
Shanghai for a contract-signing ceremony for what they called the
world's four largest container cranes. Among the dinner speakers was
Mike Jordan, an engineering consultant who worked on the world's
first container crane four decades earlier in the East Bay.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1958, who would have believed that ... the Port of Oakland
would be buying cranes from a company in ... China," he said in
prepared remarks. "Four years ago when Oakland decided to purchase
cranes from ZPMC, we were anxious, very anxious."</TE>
<TE>   Like other U.S. ports, Oakland took precautions. Records show
officials put aside more than $1 million to have consultants oversee
ZPMC's design and fabrication of three cranes in the port's first
contract with the company in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Helping ZPMC prepare its $18-million offer for three cranes was
Berkley, Oakland's port commission president in the early 1980s.
Berkley's role was "very important, even critical," said his
associate, Wan. "If he says Oakland should purchase Chinese cranes,
his voice is 1,000 times stronger than anyone."</TE>
<TE>   Smalley, the port's crane chief, had never seen a bidder hire a
former commissioner. "I don't want to say they owe the contract to
him, but his efforts were pretty [helpful]," he said. "I think it was
shrewd."</TE>
<TE>   Berkley declined to discuss ZPMC, saying, "I find the job for
them, and they win or lose in public bidding."</TE>
<TE>   During the design phase, ZPMC's young and energetic engineers
lived in the Bay Area so they could work with port consultants and
staff. They set up shop at the Oakland Post, a community paper owned
by Berkley. They put in seven-day workweeks.</TE>
<TE>   In summer 1999, after the port awarded ZPMC a new contract for
four additional cranes at $6 million each and options for nine more,
port staff made a disturbing discovery. "We have seen ... unusually
high deflections in the sill beams of all three of our cranes,"
Smalley said. "The ends are bending down, causing the legs to bow.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen this before in a crane, but we've never had
cranes this big before," Smalley said. "Theoretically, it should not
bend."</TE>
<TE>   The sill beams form the foundation above the crane's train-like
gantry wheels. The bending, Smalley said, could thwart a rocker
device that equally distributes the crane's weight among its wheels.
He said repairs were made, and the port's consultant assured him that
the stress on the cranes is less than half the allowable amount.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan said his firm evaluated 10 of ZPMC's gantry cranes in the
state and found that the three Oakland cranes and one in Long Beach
had leg deflections of up to "a few inches."</TE>
<TE>   "I think [ZPMC] had some fabrication problems," he said. "But the
net result is a satisfactory crane, safe....The structural integrity
is as good as the specification requires."</TE>
<TE>   Does it pose any conflict to evaluate cranes that his company was
paid to help oversee during design and construction? "You can't talk
your way out of a structural failure," he said. "It's not as
conflicting as it appears."</TE>
<TE>   Ben Hoiland, the state-licensed crane surveyor who detected
deflections in a ZPMC crane at the Maersk Sealand terminal in Long
Beach in the summer of 2000, said measurements over time will show
whether the bowing is growing worse, posing any risk of collapsing
like a card table. "If this condition is as reported and if the
condition is dynamic, it is a major concern and needs to be addressed
and modifications need to be made," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Cal/OSHA said they were unaware of the Long Beach
crane deflections until an inquiry by The Times. They later heard
about problems with the Oakland cranes through an anonymous call a
year after the bending was discovered.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Fry, senior safety engineer with Cal/OSHA's crane unit in
Anaheim, said, "We don't like to see any deflection in them." But he
said the key question is whether the bending increases and whether it
is greater than allowed under the crane's engineering specifications.</TE>
<TE>   ZPMC officials said the California cranes are an isolated case.
"Those are allowable deformations and do not affect performance,"
said Liu, ZPMC deputy general manager.</TE>
<TE>   Maersk officials declined to comment. But Maersk and the Port of
Oakland have ordered more ZPMC cranes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach: A No-Bid Sale</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1990s, Long Beach was widely recognized as the
country's busiest container-cargo port. And it embarked on a
controversial plan to build a new terminal on the former Navy base
there for the fast-growing China Ocean Shipping Co., known as Cosco.</TE>
<TE>   Cosco needed to order cranes for the terminal but did not want to
be stuck with costly equipment if the deal was scuttled.</TE>
<TE>   Bowing to Cosco's wishes, the port agreed on Nov. 4, 1996, to
assume the crane contract if the worst happened. And it did: An
environmental lawsuit stalled development plans.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Cosco had signed a $31.6-million contract with
ZPMC for six cranes. So the port had to buy half a dozen ZPMC cranes,
without seeking competitive bids, selecting the manufacturer or
setting its own specifications.</TE>
<TE>   "The port probably could have said, 'Sorry, those are your
cranes,'" said Ari Steinberg, the port's senior crane consultant.
"But they are a valued tenant."</TE>
<TE>   In another twist, the port assigned five of the cranes to a Long
Beach terminal used by Cosco--and the sixth was sold to Maersk.</TE>
<TE>   When the cranes arrived in 1998, labor disputes flared.</TE>
<TE>   The International Longshoreman's and Warehouseman's Union Local 13
received a call from the terminal where the cranes were being
unloaded from a ZPMC ship.</TE>
<TE>   "I came out and saw 30 to 40 [ZPMC] crew, moving forklifts, moving
crates and unlashing, which is our work," recalled Joe Donato, then
Local 13 business agent.</TE>
<TE>   After a heated discussion, the Chinese workers returned to the
ship and the longshoremen went back to work. But similar disputes
arose later.</TE>
<TE>   ZPMC consultant James H. McJunkin, a Long Beach port director in
the 1980s and a former president of the California Assn. of Port
Authorities, attributed labor disputes to the company's "growing
pains" and inexperience in working at U.S. ports. "Los Angeles and
Long Beach have more militant unions than most ports," he added.</TE>
<TE>   In January 2001, Bay Area unions filed lawsuits alleging that ZPMC
had been violating labor and immigration laws while working on
Oakland's four new cranes. Union officials also said the Chinese were
violating safety rules by using bamboo ladders and hard hats.</TE>
<TE>   The suits were settled in April, with ZPMC admitting no wrongdoing
but agreeing to use its employees for only technical work. The
settlement also called for an undisclosed amount of restitution for
any Chinese workers who were paid less than prevailing wages and for
union ironworkers who were denied work.</TE>
<TE>   Records show that Cal/OSHA fined the company $7,435 in 1999 after
the death of a Chinese ironworker whose leg was pinned by a crane
trolley. ZPMC was fined $10,375 in January 2000 for violations such
as unsafe welding practices.</TE>
<TE>   "Our people only work when they feel it is safe," Liu said. "They
just have a different understanding and customs. We agree we have to
respect the local [safety] customs." The death, he said, was "a sad
story" and the only such tragedy involving ZPMC crane deliveries.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach sought bids in 2000 for one of the biggest crane
purchases anywhere. As many as 20 cranes were needed for the Pier T
Marine Terminal to be built on 375 acres of the former Navy base.</TE>
<TE>   But not many companies could fill such a large order. And the
contract called for penalties of up to $90,000 a day for late
delivery. Only two companies bid against ZPMC.</TE>
<TE>   Since its first U.S. contract, ZPMC had come far. It had 5,500
employees and a fleet of specially designed ships that could shave
hundreds of thousands of dollars off its transportation costs.</TE>
<TE>   When the Long Beach bids were opened, ZPMC, not surprisingly, was
the low bidder. The only surprise was that it was so close.</TE>
<TE>   Noell Crane Systems was about $4 million higher than ZPMC's
winning bid of $143.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Noell has started making some of its cranes in China to cut costs.</TE>

<HD>Enron Will Spur Reform but More Is Needed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES FLANIGAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some reforms of accounting and business practices will actually be
enacted, after all the shouting and congressional hearings about
Enron Corp. and its auditor, Andersen. But problems will persist
because the issues are far bigger and more complex than Enron.</LD>
<LD>   There will be a board set up by the government to oversee
accounting firms, said Arthur Levitt, former chairman of the
Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   Also, there will be a reform requiring companies to disclose more
information about their subsidiaries, a move aimed at preventing
companies from hiding debts and losses in secret partnerships.</LD>
<TE>   But no amount of accounting reform will prevent another Enron,
Levitt said. Enron is not an isolated case. "It is the result of a
cultural change in U.S. business, an erosion of business ethics,"
Levitt said after testifying before Congress last week.</TE>
<TE>   He was referring to the widespread corporate practice of stating
profits in the most favorable way to boost stock prices. That problem
has reached such extremes that it is undermining investor trust in
the stocks of U.S. companies and therefore hurting the whole economy.</TE>
<TE>   It happens in the best of companies. IBM Corp., for example,
reduced expenses and thereby increased reported profit two years ago
by recording a gain on a sale of property in its operating income
instead of as a one-time event, as accounting rules normally dictate.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1990s boom, the Internet-telecommunications pioneers,
Cisco Systems Inc., Nortel Networks Corp. and Lucent Technologies
Inc., shipped equipment to start-up telecom companies on essentially
free credit terms, but recorded current sales and profits from the
shipments. The big firms had to make massive write-offs and
restatements of previous year's results in 2000 and 2001 when the
boom ended.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's put things in perspective," says a businessman-investor,
who requests anonymity because he's involved with Silicon Valley
companies. "Enron lost almost $70 billion in market capitalization
[total value of its shares], Cisco has fallen $400 billion in market
cap. Enron is not the biggest problem."</TE>
<TE>   But Enron is different. It collapsed amid mounting evidence of
fabrication of earnings and subterfuge to hide the true state of its
finances from shareholders and investors.</TE>
<TE>   That has "seriously shaken" the investment managers of pension and
mutual funds, the $10-trillion mountain of capital that undergirds a
good portion of the U.S. and world economies, says Patricia
McConnell, senior managing director of Bear Stearns investment
banking firm.</TE>
<TE>   Investment managers are shaken because they missed the signals
that Enron was in trouble, and also because they fear that prices of
common stocks may be based partly on air.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stock Options Are Controversial Subject</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the Jerome Levy Economics Institute of Bard College issued
a report in the fall, before Enron fell, stating that profits of the
companies in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index have been overstated by
10% to 20% for two decades.</TE>
<TE>   The report focused in part on the accounting treatment of stock
options--a controversial subject in accounting and industry circles.
Companies grant options to employees as a form of compensation. But
they do not record the options' value as a cost, as they do with
salary and benefits.</TE>
<TE>   And companies do not add the optioned shares to total shares
outstanding on which earnings per share are calculated--although they
do report the added shares in footnotes in their annual reports. The
effect, critics say, is to artificially lower costs and boost
earnings per share.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Microsoft Corp., a firm that makes stock options a
key part of employee compensation, last year reported official
earnings per share of $1.45. But a footnote explains that if optioned
stock had been included, the earnings would have been $1.38 a share,
5% less.</TE>
<TE>   The difference is in accord with a Bear Stearns' finding that
earnings at the largest U.S. companies would have been 6% lower on
average if the value of options had been charged to earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Yet high-tech firms, in Seattle and Silicon Valley and elsewhere,
argue that paying in stock options helps conserve cash for young
companies that can't afford big salaries and do not wish to reduce
reported earnings on which stock prices are based. Employees,
especially many who grew rich at Microsoft, tend to agree.</TE>
<TE>   So there are rational arguments for options. "Stock options are
fine, but reporting their cost in earnings would not hurt the concept
and would make the accounts clearer and more trustworthy for
investors," says Michael Clowes, editor of Pensions and Investments,
a publication for the institutional investment community.</TE>
<TE>   The point is moot, however, because "no reform of stock options
accounting will be made. Congress would never pass such a measure,"
Levitt says.</TE>
<TE>   When he headed the SEC in the 1990s, Levitt tried to strengthen
accounting regulations, including a prohibition of the conflict of
interest inherent in the practice of accounting firms auditing
corporations' books while soliciting consulting contracts from them.
Congress not only refused Levitt's reforms but threatened to cut the
SEC's budget if he persisted--which says a lot about Congress'
professed zeal for reform today.</TE>
<TE>   But reforms will be made at this time. The investment community is
worried.</TE>
<TE>   "Standards have slipped," says Patricia J. Hughes, accounting
professor at the Anderson School at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "Companies today restate earnings from past years. They never used
to do that. It's a problem because it puts in doubt the basis for
investments made years before."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Demand to Separate Auditing and Consulting</TE>
<TE>   Problems are coming to a head. With global companies moving money
around at unprecedented speed, "financial engineering is outrunning
the accounting laws' ability to keep up," says Clowes, author of "The
Money Flood," a history of pension funds' rise to investment
importance.</TE>
<TE>   "Investment professionals don't trust the corporate accounts so
they are adding a risk premium to all their investments," says
economist Albert M. Wojnilower of Clipper Asset Management, a New
York investment firm.</TE>
<TE>   But Enron has delivered a wake-up call. Major investors may force
reform by insisting on rigorous accounting from auditing firms and
corporate boards. The nation's largest pension fund, the California
Public Employees' Retirement System, is "demanding that the SEC draw
a bright line for accounting firms to separate their consulting and
auditing functions," a spokeswoman says.</TE>
<TE>   It's a profoundly serious matter. Many countries are poor because
they do not have trustworthy investment markets capable of
distributing capital to businesses and families. The lesson of Enron
is that the trustworthiness of the vital U.S. market needs
protection.</TE>

<LD>How could other states amend their tax codes in a timely manner but
not California ["Tax Impasse Could Harm Retirees," Jan. 22]? There
was a compelling financial motive--loss of revenue.</LD>
<LD>   Federal law allows workers and retirees more tax-free savings and
freedom to move between plans without penalties. By stalling,
California has transferred money from taxpayers' pockets to the state
treasury. Does the governor intend to balance the state budget on the
backs of retirees?</LD>

<HD>In Enron's Aftermath, Investors Rethink Strategy</HD>
<DH>For Fund Managers, It's a New Bull Market in Skepticism</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The collapse of Enron Corp., which caught even many heavyweight
professional money managers by surprise and cost them billions, has
exposed the shortcomings of Wall Street's supposedly sophisticated
"buy side," critics say.</LD>
<LD>   "You would think that the mutual fund portfolio managers being
directly affected by this apparent fraud would be in the lead
screaming for reform" in accounting and other areas, said Mercer
Bullard, founder of Fund Democracy, a Chevy Chase, Md.-based company
that calls itself an advocate for investors.</LD>
<LD>   "The reason they're not is that they're probably embarrassed,
because active management failed to detect something that seems so
obvious now. It's a slap in the face to active management," Bullard
said.</LD>
<TE>   Many mutual funds, pension plans and other institutions invested
in Enron alongside the company's workers and retirees and other small
investors who in some cases saw their savings decimated.</TE>
<TE>   In the fourth quarter of 2000, when Enron shares were near their
peak, purchasers of the stock included the Alliance Premier Growth
fund, which bought 3.2 million shares; AXP New Dimensions, which
bought 2.4 million shares; and Vanguard U.S. Growth, which bought 1.6
million, according to mutual fund tracker Morningstar Inc. Prominent
funds that listed Enron among their top 10 holdings at year-end 2000
included the Janus Fund, Janus Mercury and Janus Growth &amp; Income.</TE>
<TE>   Even at midyear 2001, when the stock already was in decline, many
funds still held big chunks of Enron. AIM Global Infrastructure, for
example, had 6.9% of its assets in Enron as of June 30, according to
Morningstar; Turner New Energy &amp; Power Technology had 6.2%; and Stein
Roe Focus had 4.8%.</TE>
<TE>   The presence of so many big names reveals the level of groupthink
about the stock, and the general lack of original research in the
fund business, critics say. In the wake of the dot-com bust of 2000,
professional money managers should have exhibited more skepticism
about a highflier such as Enron, some say.</TE>
<TE>   Though numerous fund companies were hurt by Enron's plunge last
year, some commentators have skewered Janus Capital Corp. in
particular, noting that the firm's long-running advertising campaign
highlights its in-depth stock research.</TE>
<TE>   "Janus pretends to know more, to dig deeper. At least that's the
line the marketing department uses. But it doesn't seem like it would
have taken a whole lot of sleuthing to have known Enron wasn't all it
was cracked up to be," said Jonas Max Ferris, editor of Maxfunds.com,
a Web site that covers the fund industry.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the fund industry say numerous red flags were ignored
before Enron tumbled into bankruptcy, including a proxy statement
released in March 2000 showing that Enron's chief financial officer
stood to gain from the company's array of offshore partnerships, and
a Fortune magazine article in March 2001 questioning Enron's "opaque
accounting and dubious rationalizations" for its generous stock
valuation.</TE>
<TE>   "It drives me nuts that people say they didn't know Enron had
problems," said Sean Reidy, co-manager of the Olstein Financial Alert
Fund in Purchase, N.Y., a stock fund known for its research and for
its contrarian approach to investing.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the proxy statement indicating the CFO "may have
had somewhat of a divided interest," Enron had a rising debt load,
negative cash flow and a "belligerent" attitude when questions were
raised in conference calls with investors, Reidy said. "There wasn't
a smoking gun," he said. "But there were just too many question
marks, too many red flags."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most worrisome sign was that Enron was a business few,
if any, investors could make sense of, Reidy said.</TE>
<TE>   "I had neither the expertise nor the time to put into
understanding what the company does. All I know is it's not something
I wanted to be investing in."</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Veaco, a portfolio manager of the Beverly Hills-based
Clipper Fund, said his firm felt the same way. "We could never get
our arms around the company," Veaco said. "We couldn't grasp how they
were making money, and we try to be like Warren Buffett: We won't
invest in something we don't understand."</TE>
<TE>   Russ Kinnel, Morningstar's director of fund analysis in Chicago,
said it's reasonable to ask why other fund managers didn't follow the
same instinct.</TE>
<TE>   "The most galling thing is that here was a company putting out a
blizzard of confusing news and not going anywhere near full
disclosure, but these supposedly sophisticated fund managers were
investing anyway," Kinnel said. "The thing is, you don't have to buy
the stock, especially if you can't put a firm value on the company."</TE>
<TE>   Many Enron shareholders were simply playing the momentum game, say
money managers who never fancied the stock: As long as it was hot,
nobody seemed to bother to ask questions. That strategy worked like a
charm in 1999 and 2000, when the stock tripled in two years.</TE>
<TE>   "Enron is the pinnacle of the Internet era, capping the whole
thing off," said John Wakeman, vice president of research at fund
company T. Rowe Price Group Inc. in Baltimore. "The prevailing
attitude was, 'Just tell me the story and never mind the
fundamentals.'"</TE>
<TE>   Despite their supposed sophistication, portfolio managers have "a
long history of falling for a great story," Wakeman said. "Usually
it's a capital-intensive business where the 'sell side' cheerleaders
[brokerage analysts] are out in force."</TE>
<TE>   With Enron, the enticing story was about reinventing the energy
trading business via the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Some Insiders Call Criticism Overblown</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street's army of brokerage analysts has long been taken to
task for buttering up corporate managements with glowing reports to
help generate investment banking business for their firms, rather
than honestly critiquing stocks. Money managers--the "buy
side"--always have maintained that they aren't duped by analysts. But
the Enron tale suggests otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   "What this shows is that investors at all levels need better
discipline," Wakeman said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, even diligent scrutiny is unlikely to thwart outright
accounting fraud, experts note. "It's difficult even for auditors to
detect fraud if management really wants to hide something," Veaco
said.</TE>
<TE>   Some fund industry insiders say criticism over their Enron
investments has been overblown.</TE>
<TE>   Shelley Peterson, spokeswoman for Denver-based Janus, said her
firm sustained "very minimal losses" overall in its Enron holdings,
in part because it got in early, first buying shares in January 1999.
Janus was a net seller of the stock from March 2001 through
mid-November, when it sold its last shares, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, its Enron holdings couldn't have helped performance last
year, when Janus' diversified domestic stock funds lost an average of
24% on an asset-weighted basis--the worst performance among major
fund companies, according to investment firm Kanon Bloch Carre.</TE>
<TE>   But Peterson defended Janus' research, which, she noted, led the
firm to buy Enron early, well before there were indications that the
company was less than forthright.</TE>
<TE>   "Our research process is strong, but it's predicated on a company
not hiding information," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Other funds that had big stakes in Enron last year declined to
comment other than to say they have since sold the stock.</TE>
<TE>   Post-Enron, investors of all kinds have grown increasingly
skittish, and portfolio managers have become more leery about stock
stories, some say.</TE>
<TE>   "The good to come from all this is that as an industry we're
becoming much more independent and doing more critical thinking,"
said Bob Bilkie, portfolio manager at Sigma Investment Counselors in
Southfield, Mich., which handles private accounts.</TE>
<TE>   "The Enron disaster means you go through all your portfolios
looking for companies whose earnings are less than transparent or
whose income statements are so complex you can hardly figure them
out," Bilkie said. "You're going to see a lot less blind faith in
management going forward."</TE>
<TE>   Firms seen as having complex structures or aggressive accounting,
such as the conglomerate Tyco International Ltd., are feeling the
effects of a jittery market on their stock prices. Tyco's shares have
tumbled 24% this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever there's even a hint of possible obfuscation of financial
disclosures, the company is now punished," said Jim Lyon, portfolio
manager at investment firm Oakwood Capital Management in Century
City.</TE>
<TE>   He and Bilkie both said the market probably has overreacted in the
case of Tyco, where no evidence of impropriety has surfaced, and the
company has strongly denied that its accounting is aggressive. But
"people are going to shoot first and ask questions later. Everybody
is in survival mode," Bilkie said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Need for Greater Diversification</TE>
<TE>   He pointed to biotech giant Amgen Inc.'s release of quarterly
earnings last week as an example of a renewed sense of wariness among
investment pros. Bilkie said he will analyze the report more closely
than he might have six months ago, and he suspects competitors are
doing the same.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen said quarterly net income was reduced by a one-time charge
of 15 cents a share for unsuccessful drug collaborations.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to question whether that's really a one-time charge or the
cost of doing business in that industry," Bilkie said. "Either way, I
think it's still a good company with good long-term prospects, but I
basically have to figure out my own pro forma earnings for every
company."</TE>
<TE>   Lyon said the Enron collapse probably will reinforce the need for
greater portfolio diversification by fund managers and retail
investors.</TE>
<TE>   Another old-fashioned lesson reinforced by the blowup is that,
ultimately, valuations matter. Highly valued stocks, as measured by
price-to-earnings ratios and other yardsticks, may deserve to trade
at a premium to the market because of a superior business, but those
inherent lofty expectations carry downside risk: If the company
eventually disappoints, the market might crush the shares.</TE>
<TE>   Reidy said his fund looked at Enron last spring when the stock was
at $60 and trading for about 40 times earnings per share, but "we
determined that it's basically nothing more than a trading company,
and there's nothing stable about that kind of business."</TE>

<HD>Few Investors Can Live With Profiting From a Stranger's
Death</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: Four years ago, my father's financial advisor sold him two
viaticals--life insurance policies on terminally ill people--for
about $20,000. My father was 84 at the time, and the life expectancy
of the two people was supposed to be two years. Apparently, they're
still alive, and the investment has yet to pay off.</LD>
<LD>   My objective in writing to you is twofold. Please warn people that
this is not the most sound, practical or ethical way to make money.
We are distressed that we need to keep checking to see whether
someone has passed away to get Dad his funds.</LD>
<LD>   Secondly, is there a way to determine that this is a valid
investment--that the case numbers we are checking on are real people?</LD>
<TE>   Every time we call, we hear they are "in declining health." We
feel frustrated with the whole concept.</TE>
<TE>   Answer: A lot of people, including securities regulators, have
reservations about investing in viatical settlements.</TE>
<TE>   Viatical settlements allow the terminally ill to a receive a lump
sum that represents a portion of the face value of their life
insurance. In return, the investor who provides the lump-sum
settlement is named as the policy's beneficiary, so when the
terminally ill person dies the proceeds go to the investor.</TE>
<TE>   The investor might put up $70,000 and receive the proceeds of a
$100,000 policy, for example. This can represent a tidy return if the
terminally ill person dies within a couple of years--or a very poor
return if the person lives for a decade or more.</TE>
<TE>   Some people find the whole business ghoulish because investors
essentially are profiting by someone's death.</TE>
<TE>   Others point out that viatical settlements can be a godsend for
the terminally ill, but warn that this is area of investing that is
fraught with fraud and misrepresentation.</TE>
<TE>   For example, these are not "low risk," "safe" or "guaranteed"
investments, although they're often sold that way to unsuspecting
seniors.</TE>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission has warned that viatical
settlements can be risky investments, while the North American
Securities Administrators Assn. says viaticals are unpredictable and
not guaranteed.</TE>
<TE>   As you've discovered, it can be difficult to determine whether the
people whose life expectancy you're monitoring even exist.</TE>
<TE>   Even legitimate operations aren't going to tell you the names and
addresses of their terminally ill clients, lest you be tempted to
hurry their demise.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, regulation of viaticals in many states is spotty, at
best. Some regulators can't decide whether viaticals are an insurance
product or a security, which means it can be tough to figure out who
handles complaints, let alone to get any agency to act.</TE>
<TE>   California recently passed a law that made viaticals a security
and restricted to whom they could be marketed. Viatical investments
must be approved by the state before they can be sold to the average
investor.</TE>
<TE>   So if you're in California, you can direct your complaints to the
state's Department of Corporations (the number is in your local phone
book).</TE>
<TE>   In other states, you'll probably have to check with both
securities and insurance regulators to see whether they've had other
complaints about the company.</TE>
<TE>   You also might consider lodging a complaint against your father's
advisor, who should have thought twice, at least, about selling such
a risky investment to an 84-year-old man.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Enrolled Agents Can Handle Most Returns</TE>
<TE>   Q: I have just moved to the area and am getting my statements,
forms and receipts together to have my taxes prepared. In the past, I
have used a certified public accountant for my tax preparation and
have been happy with my tax refunds.</TE>
<TE>   However, I have been receiving a lot of mailings and letters from
enrolled agents, and I'm not familiar with them. What are the
advantages and disadvantages to using an enrolled agent as opposed to
a CPA?</TE>
<TE>   A: Unless you have a very complicated return, you may be just as
happy with an enrolled agent--and you'll probably pay less for his or
her services.</TE>
<TE>   Enrolled agents are tax specialists who are authorized to
represent taxpayers in audits and other Internal Revenue Service
matters. (In fact, only enrolled agents, CPAs and attorneys are
authorized to represent taxpayers before the IRS.)</TE>
<TE>   Many enrolled agents, in fact, are former IRS employees. All
enrolled agents have met experience and education requirements
designed to keep them abreast of changes in tax law.</TE>
<TE>   CPAs, of course, face even more rigorous testing and education
requirements, but not all CPAs specialize in tax preparation. Those
who do tend to charge more for a return than enrolled agents.</TE>
<TE>   That could be money well spent if you have your own corporation,
for example, or are dealing with complex investments, or simply like
the idea of having a high-powered pro do your return.</TE>
<TE>   But you may be paying more than you need to if you have a
relatively straightforward tax situation.</TE>
<TE>   Before you hire any tax professional, check their background and
credentials and make sure they're used to handling returns like
yours. To find an enrolled agent, go to www.naea.org  or call (800)
424-4339. To find a California CPA, go to www.calcpa.org.</TE>

<HD>IRS Cracks Down on Slavery Reparation Claims</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson has a simple message for all African
Americans: Don't be fooled. There is no tax break to compensate the
descendants of slaves.</LD>
<LD>   Tax frauds, ranging from bogus trusts to claims that Americans can
"untax" themselves by renouncing their U.S. citizenship, proliferate
during tax season, Internal Revenue Service officials said. But
they're multiplying at an alarming rate, spurring the IRS to action.</LD>
<LD>   So-called slavery reparation claims, for example, soared to 80,000
in 2001 from 13,700 the year before, the IRS said.</LD>
<TE>   The scam is most prevalent in the South--Georgia, Alabama,
Arkansas, Louisiana and Florida--but it's also ensnaring thousands of
people in every state, with growing numbers in California,
Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Indiana, IRS officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in April, the IRS will treat slavery reparation claims
like any other frivolous tax filing. That means taxpayers will get
just one chance to withdraw these claims before they're subject to a
$500 penalty.</TE>
<TE>   "We condemn those degenerates that would exploit a culture of
Americans that is the least deserving of any more hardships," said
Johnson (D-Texas), chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus. "And
we ask everyone to be alert and not get themselves in trouble. It is
important not to file false [tax] claims."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the IRS recently discovered 200 claims for
nonexistent reparations for Native Americans.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Using Church Groups</TE>
<TE>   The agency suspects that promoters are marketing these bogus
reparation claims through church organizations--a classic affinity
scam technique. In affinity scams, promoters try to catch victims off
guard by posing as a member of a trusted group.</TE>
<TE>   "Promoters are shamelessly preying on people," IRS Commissioner
Charles O. Rossotti said in a statement last week. "These snake-oil
salesmen build false hopes and charge people good money for bad
advice.</TE>
<TE>   "In the end, the victims discover their refund claims are
rejected, and their money and the promoters are long gone."</TE>
<TE>   Promoters of the slavery reparations scam commonly charge
taxpayers $50 to $100 to file a slavery reparation claim. However,
some charge a percentage of the supposed refund amount--a figure that
often amounts to thousands of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Rossotti said the IRS is attempting to get the word out in the
next few months, hoping that the warning will prevent taxpayers from
being taken in by the scam artists. As part of this outreach effort,
IRS officials are contacting church groups and senior citizen
organizations to explain the scam and discourage their members from
participating.</TE>
<TE>   The agency also is going on the offensive to ferret out reparation
claims that already have been filed. The IRS's 10 tax return
processing centers have been alerted to the signs of a false
reparation claim. The agency will penalize those who prepare, promote
and participate in the scams.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Offering 'Secret' Claim</TE>
<TE>   The scam usually works like this: Promoters contact African
Americans either in person or through advertisements, saying that the
government is paying slavery reparation claims of $40,000 to $80,000.</TE>
<TE>   Promoters urge these taxpayers to pay a fee and fill out forms to
claim credits for "black investment taxes," "black inheritance tax
refunds" or "reparations for African Americans."</TE>
<TE>   Taxpayers who ask why they've never heard of these breaks are told
that they're a "secret" provision in the tax code that the "IRS
doesn't want you to know about," IRS officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Federal tax law, however, does not allow for such reparation
claims and those who've made them have been penalized--sometimes
jailed, IRS officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Past enforcement actions have concentrated on the promoters, but
the IRS said it soon will start penalizing participants.</TE>
<TE>   For instance:</TE>
<TE>   * On Friday, Vernon T. James of Carrollton, Texas, was sentenced
to 78 months in prison and ordered to pay $1.2 million in restitution
for preparing 10 returns that fraudulently claimed the "black
investment tax."</TE>
<TE>   * Gregory Bridges, who told his Virginia clients they could take a
"black tax credit," was sentenced to 57 months in prison after being
convicted on 22 counts of filing false returns in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   * In 2000, the agency moved to seize a Florida preparer's assets
when she was discovered urging potential clients to deliver completed
tax forms and a $100 money order so she could file bogus reparation
claims on their behalf.</TE>
<TE>   Recognizing that the taxpayers filing these claims often were
victims themselves, the agency has been fairly lenient, IRS officials
said. Although the IRS generally fines taxpayers who refuse to
rescind frivolous tax returns, the agency didn't fine those making
slavery reparation claims unless they already had rejected two such
claims from the same taxpayer.</TE>
<TE>   But that leniency ends April 15. After that date, taxpayers will
get just one chance to withdraw slavery reparation claims before
they're hit with a frivolous filing penalty of $500, the IRS said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reparations Bill Stalled</TE>
<TE>   There is a historical premise for the reparation claims. Congress
passed a bill after the Civil War aimed at giving former slaves 40
acres of land and a mule to compensate them for their unpaid labor.
However, the bill was vetoed by President Andrew Jackson and never
became law.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the Congressional Black Caucus has had little success
in getting slavery reparations discussed, much less paid, Johnson
said. For the last 13 years, Rep. John Conyers (D-Michigan) has
introduced legislation to study slavery reparations, but the bill has
yet to make it out of committee hearings.</TE>

<HD>In Enron's Aftermath, Investors Rethink Strategy</HD>
<DH>Easy-to-Understand Firms Back in Vogue on Wall Street</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mutual fund managers with cash to invest had a choice in late July.
They could have paid about $28 a share for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts,
the fast-growing retailer of tasty, if not exactly healthy,
mass-produced pastries.</LD>
<LD>   Or they could have paid about $45 a share for Enron Corp., which
at that point still enjoyed a reputation as the premier U.S.
energy-trading firm.</LD>
<LD>   One basic argument against Krispy Kreme was that the share price
then was a lofty 70 times the 40 cents a share Wall Street expected
the company to earn in 2001. Enron shares, by comparison, were priced
at 26 times expected earnings for the year.</LD>
<TE>   Six months later, Krispy Kreme shares are up 39% and are sporting
a price-to-earnings multiple of nearly 90 based on 2001 profit
estimates. Enron, meanwhile, is all but finished as a going concern.</TE>
<TE>   Of all the lessons that the Enron saga ultimately may teach
professional and individual investors, the simplest may be about
simplicity itself: In the wake of the many investment disasters of
the last two years, easy-to-understand businesses--from doughnuts to
auto-parts retailing to Winnebagos--suddenly have enormous appeal.</TE>
<TE>   That's at least partly because investors whose portfolios have
exploded since 1999 are, in many cases, being forced to admit that
they didn't truly understand much of what they owned.</TE>
<TE>   Consider JDS Uniphase, now at about $7 a share. It was a market
star at $153 a share in 2000. But how many of its institutional or
retail investors then could detail why JDS' fiber-optic components
were better than its competitors', if they were?</TE>
<TE>   As for Enron, each new revelation suggests it was less an
operating business than a concept--and one that probably few
investors could have explained without help from an Enron senior
executive.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, onetime biotechnology industry darling ImClone
Systems has seen more than $4 billion of stock market valuation melt
away in six weeks as federal regulators refused to even accept its
application to market an anti-cancer drug that ImClone had touted as
a blockbuster.</TE>
<TE>   Investors who bought ImClone at $73 a share in December now are
holding stock worth $16.50 a share--and must be wondering whether
they really have a clue what ImClone is all about, given that
congressional committees, the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the Justice Department have launched investigations of the company.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, consider some of the names that have been on Wall
Street's leader board for most of the last 12 months, and are still
there:</TE>
<TE>   * Shares of H&amp;R Block, the tax-preparation and financial-services
giant that has long been a household name, hit a record high Friday,
at $46.26, and are up 128% over the last year.</TE>
<TE>   * Motorcycle leader Harley-Davidson recently reported a 26% jump
in fourth-quarter earnings, thanks to still-strong demand for its
bikes despite the economic recession. Its stock is up 25% over the
last year and is just below its all-time high.</TE>
<TE>   * Shares of auto-parts retailer AutoZone, the No. 1 player in that
industry, are up 142% over the last year on robust earnings gains.</TE>
<TE>   * IHOP Corp., the Glendale-based owner and franchiser of the
International House of Pancakes restaurant chain, has seen Wall
Street bid its shares from a low of $13.80 on March 10, 2000, to a
recent record high of more than $30. Coincidentally, March 10, 2000,
was the day the technology stock sector peaked, as measured by the
Nasdaq composite index.</TE>
<TE>   The companies above have nothing in common except for the relative
simplicity of their business models: Each can be described in a short
sentence. Each company also has products or services that an investor
can experience firsthand.</TE>
<TE>   It's true that, even at the height of the dot-com mania, some
non-tech simple concepts still played well with investors. It's also
true that the market's rally since September has been led by many
technology shares that had been beaten down to three-year lows in the
aftermath of the terrorist attacks. Technology may be a complicated
subject, but it doesn't take a genius to understand that some tech
companies will survive this recession and prosper.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the idea of owning something you can understand gains more
currency with every new stock blowup. "It's boring, but it's
profitable" is a line that no longer invites derision on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   That idea also dovetails with two trends that have dominated the
market for the last 22 months: the renewed appreciation for "value"
stocks, meaning those selling for low or reasonable price-to-earnings
ratios; and the revival of interest in lesser-known small and
mid-size companies, many of which had been virtually ignored by
investors in the late 1990s, when blue-chip names ruled the roost.</TE>
<TE>   (Small and mid-size companies also have benefited from the
troubles of some big-name companies whose businesses are fairly
simple, but whose execution has faltered badly in recent years--for
example, retailer Gap and soft-drink titan Coca-Cola.)</TE>
<TE>   Yet any stock or sector that enjoys sudden popularity risks
becoming caught up in the momentum game, wherein the shares are bid
higher by short-term players merely looking to ride the wave until it
crests. A legitimate question to ask about Krispy Kreme today is
whether a doughnut retailer merits a price-to-earnings ratio on par
with those afforded to some of the nation's most important tech
companies in their heydays of 1999 and early 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly, history may be repeating. There was an
"emerging-growth-stock" mania in the late 1960s which, like the
late-1990s tech mania, resulted in stratospheric share valuations for
companies that were largely built on dreams (in that period, many
were connected to the space program or to the fledgling semiconductor
industry).</TE>
<TE>   After those stocks collapsed between 1968 and 1970, many investors
fled to the perceived safety of established companies whose
businesses were easy to grasp and whose growth prospects appeared
stellar. They were the so-called Nifty Fifty stocks, also dubbed
"one-decision" stocks because institutional investors believed you
could buy them and forget about them for the next few decades.</TE>
<TE>   The Nifty Fifty included such names as Xerox, Polaroid, Avon
Products and McDonald's. Their reign lasted from 1970 to 1972, when
they peaked at huge valuations, then plunged in the 1973-74 bear
market, the worst decline since the Depression.</TE>
<TE>   So far, no one is calling Krispy Kreme or Harley-Davidson
"one-decision" stocks. But that also may be the good news about the
respect investors once again are showing for straightforward,
non-flashy businesses that stick to their knitting and deliver decent
growth: It may still be early in the game.</TE>

<LD>Enron Chief Resigns Amid More Revelations</LD>
<LD>   The continuing Enron Corp. scandal dominated the business
headlines. Congressional hearings opened, with executives of Enron
accounting firm Andersen pointing the finger at a fired partner for
destroying potentially revealing Enron documents in an apparent
attempt to keep them away from federal investigators.</LD>
<LD>   Enron Chairman and Chief Kenneth L. Lay was ousted amid continuing
allegations that he enriched himself while employees lost their life
savings due to the collapse of the company he helped build.</LD>
<TE>   The story also turned tragic as a former Enron vice chairman, J.
Clifford Baxter, was found dead, the victim of an apparent suicide.
Baxter had been a whistle-blower, raising concerns about questionable
financial dealings at the company.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan Says Economy Is Improving</TE>
<TE>   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan painted a somewhat
brighter picture of the economy's progress out of recession and said
the fiscal stimulus package that Washington is about to debate might
not be needed after all.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been signs recently that some of the forces that have
been restraining the economy over the past year are starting to
diminish and that activity is beginning to firm," he told the Senate
Budget Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Also adding to evidence of a recovery, a key forecasting gauge for
the U.S. economy posted its largest gain in almost six years in
December, suggesting the economy could emerge from recession within
the next three months.</TE>
<TE>   The Conference Board said its U.S. index of leading economic
indicators rose 1.2% in December after a gain of 0.8% in November.
The December rise was the largest since February 1996.</TE>

<TE>   Kmart Files for Bankruptcy Protection</TE>
<TE>   Kmart Corp., under pressure from suppliers who had begun to cut
off shipments of merchandise, became the largest retailer to seek
protection in bankruptcy court.</TE>
<TE>   The bankruptcy filing, which listed $16.3 billion in assets and
$10.3 billion in liabilities, is expected to eventually result in the
closure of hundreds of stores and layoffs for some of Kmart's
approximately 250,000 employees nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   The Troy, Mich.-based retailer said it secured $2 billion in
financing that will allow the company to operate while reorganizing
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.</TE>
<TE>   The widely anticipated filing was welcomed by analysts and some of
Kmart's vendors, whose support will be critical to the company's
turnaround efforts. Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc., Kmart's
best-known brand, said it was sticking by the retailer.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart said it planned to emerge from bankruptcy in 2003, and has
begun determining which of its approximately 2,100 stores should
close. Kmart has 164 outlets in California, about half of them in
Southern California. All of Kmart's stores continued operating,
although some shoppers complained that shelves were not properly
stocked.</TE>
<TE>   The company blamed the bankruptcy filing on increased competition,
poor holiday sales and the recession, a series of unsuccessful sales
and marketing initiatives and, most recently, an erosion of support
among its vendors. Kmart sought unsuccessfully to secure a bailout
from lenders, and the company suffered a particularly stinging blow
when Fleming Cos., its only grocery supplier, halted shipments after
Kmart failed to make a regular weekly payment.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Amazon.com Posts Its First Net Profit</TE>
<TE>   The Internet revolution, which promised to transform the way
consumers shop for everything from compact discs to cars, reached a
milestone when pioneering online retailer Amazon.com Inc. reported
the first profit in its seven-year history.</TE>
<TE>   In the last three months of 2001, the world's largest electronic
commerce company cleared $5 million, or 1 cent a share, contrasted
with a loss of $545 million, or $1.53 a share, in the same period a
year earlier. The profit was fueled by robust holiday sales as the
Seattle-based company sold $1.1 billion of books, videos, consumer
electronics and other merchandise in the fourth quarter, a 15%
increase from the year-earlier period.</TE>
<TE>   Although analysts say Amazon may post a loss in the upcoming
quarters, they add that the company's efforts to streamline its
operations and consumers' increasing willingness to shop online
appear to have put it on a trajectory toward sustained profit in the
coming years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AOL Unit Files Suit Against Microsoft</TE>
<TE>   An AOL Time Warner Inc. unit filed a civil antitrust suit against
Microsoft Corp., claiming the Redmond, Wash.-based giant's
monopolistic behavior nearly pushed AOL's Netscape Internet browser
out of the market.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit--filed by AOL subsidiary Netscape Communications Corp.
in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia--draws heavily
from federal court findings that Microsoft's business practices amid
the browser wars of the 1990s violated federal antitrust laws.</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge ruled in April 2000 that Microsoft used
anti-competitive means to thwart browser Netscape. A panel of seven
appellate judges upheld eight separate antitrust violations by
Microsoft a year later.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft officials said the complaint is merely a sign that AOL
is trying to compete with Microsoft in the courts rather than the
marketplace.</TE>

<TE>   Founding Scientist Resigns From Celera</TE>
<TE>   J. Craig Venter, the maverick scientist whose drive to crack the
human genome ignited one of the fiercest rivalries in modern science,
resigned from the company he helped launch, Celera Genomics.</TE>
<TE>   Venter's abrupt departure from the high-profile gene-mapping
company prompted speculation that he left under pressure from
Celera's parent, Applera Corp. No successor to Venter was named.</TE>
<TE>   Applera said Chairman and Chief Executive Tony White will assume
Venter's position as president until a replacement is found.</TE>
<TE>   Venter, who led Celera in a race against the publicly funded Human
Genome Project two years ago, leaves Celera as the company shifts its
focus from genomics, his specialty, to drug development, in which
Venter lacks expertise.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tyco to Split Into Four Units</TE>
<TE>   Tyco International Ltd., bowing to shareholder demands for greater
transparency in accounting, said it plans to split into four
companies and shed $11 billion in debt.</TE>
<TE>   The breakup reverses the strategy of Tyco Chief Executive Dennis
Kozlowski, who oversaw $64 billion in acquisitions and whose methods
were compared with General Electric Co. Kozlowski will head the
electronics and security-systems company that remains after Tyco
spins off its health-care, fire protection and flow control, and
financial services units.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco, which is based in Bermuda and run from Exeter, N.H., was the
subject of criticism from some analysts and investors who said the
company manipulated its accounting for acquisitions to mask slowing
growth in its business.</TE>
<TE>   Enron Corp.'s accounting lapses and failure may have forced Tyco
to take the steps to boost its stock price after losing $25 billion
in market value since December, investors said. Proceeds from
transactions and the sale of Tyco's plastics business will be used to
repay some of the company's $79 billion in debt.</TE>

<TE>   Mariah Carey Dropped by Record Label</TE>
<TE>   EMI Group dropped pop star Mariah Carey less than a year after
signing her to a blockbuster four-album contract worth more than $80
million.</TE>
<TE>   The termination of the pact, which will cost EMI an estimated $30
million in exit fees, follows a difficult year for Carey, who
suffered a nervous breakdown last summer before releasing her debut
album for the British music giant. But Carey's "Glitter" CD for EMI
was panned by critics and sold only about 2 million copies worldwide.
Her 1993 album, "Music Box," sold about 20 million copies for Sony.</TE>
<TE>   This marks the first time a major music corporation has decided to
cut its losses on an unprofitable superstar pact after one album.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Market Rallies to Post Weekly Advance</TE>
<TE>   The stock market rallied, posting its first weekly advance since
the first week of January for the three most widely followed indices.</TE>
<TE>   For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 0.7%, the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 rose 0.5% and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.4%.</TE>
<TE>   Last week's gains follow a decline that began in early January as
investors grew concerned that stocks had climbed too far on the
expectation an economic recovery was coming.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the dollar surged to a six-month high against the euro
on growing confidence the U.S. economy will recover from recession in
coming months.</TE>

<AU>STEVEN BARRIE-ANTHONY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At first I told myself that it couldn't be, it was the way the light
hit the cut, maybe my shampoo was too harsh, maybe, oh, I don't know,
maybe it's just my notoriously active imagination.</LD>
<LD>   Sitting in my dorm room watching "Saturday Night Live," I pointed
and told a friend, "It's thinning." He was supposed to say, "Oh,
Steven, that's ridiculous," but instead he forgot his lines and just
nodded and said, "Yep."</LD>
<LD>   But I still didn't believe it. At 20--no, it couldn't be. Maybe at
40 or even 30, little by little so I wouldn't even notice, after I
was married and happy and secure and loved.</LD>
<TE>   At home for winter break, I stood in front of the bathroom mirror.
I turned on all the lights--over the sink, the dome light, in the
hall--and then I opened my eyes and looked. There was no way around
it. My hairline was receding. Even the hair up on top wasn't as thick
as it used to be.</TE>
<TE>   I told my mom. Of course she disagreed, but my dad said, "Yeah, I
see what you mean."</TE>
<TE>   "Look," he said to my mom, "look where his hairline is, and on the
top of the head, this used to be a lot fuller, thicker." They got a
picture from high school, my senior portrait. Lo and behold, I had
more hair back then. Quite a bit.</TE>
<TE>   Darn, I thought. This is not what I need now. In the middle of
sophomore year, do I really need something to undermine my
confidence? Something to make me feel isolated, different?</TE>
<TE>   After a while I had to laugh. What the heck--there's nothing to do
but grin and bear it. But wait a second, I thought, and made a
beeline for the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   It turns out that hair loss in men is usually caused by a high
level of testosterone, the hormone that basically makes men men, so I
guess in a way that's a good thing. I disregarded all the Web sites
dedicated to wigs and hairpieces, hair implants and other drastic
plastic surgeries. But a few things seemed promising.</TE>
<TE>   First, Rogaine, the goop you spread on your scalp twice a day,
seems to make a difference for a lot of guys. But you have to do it
forever--or you lose all the hair you would've lost anyway. And being
a red-blooded American with a short attention span, I didn't think
doing that twice a day for the rest of my life would be doable.</TE>
<TE>   There must be a quick fix--this is the 21st century, folks!</TE>
<TE>   Finally, I came across what I thought I'd been looking for:
Propecia. It's a new drug, a relative of Proscar, which was
originally prescribed to treat prostate problems. If taken daily, it
apparently grows new hair and prevents continued hair loss in most
men. Wow, what a great deal, I thought--until I looked at the
possible side effects. Taking Propecia may produce "decreased sexual
desire, lowered [sexual] sensitivity, or decreased ejaculate ... "
read the hairloss.org Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Hmm, I thought, take that pill and I risk being bald and impotent.</TE>
<TE>   Just out of curiosity, I followed the chain of drugs. If I took
Propecia to halt hair loss, and Viagra to fix erectile dysfunction,
then I'd be as good as new, right? Possibly right--probably wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "The most common drug side effects of Viagra are headache,
flushing of the face, and upset stomach," reads the
mens-sexual-health.org Web site. Others include " ... temporary
changes in color vision ... eyes being more sensitive to light, or
blurred vision." In rare cases, you "may have an erection that lasts
many hours."</TE>
<TE>   So if I want to be totally intact, I'd have to take: Propecia for
hair, Viagra for sexual function, Pepto Bismal for my stomach and
Advil or Tylenol for my head. On top of that, I might be flushed,
have colored vision and never, ever, be able to be confident wearing
sweat pants in public. Sound like a good trade for a bit o' thinning
up on top?</TE>
<TE>   For me right now, a nice hat seems like the better solution.</TE>

<HD>Singular Commitment</HD>
<DH>Kourosh Larizadeh's interest in art by Mike Kelley is a
quintessential L.A. story.</DH>
<SE>The Collectors: One in an occasional series</SE>
<AU>SUSAN FREUDENHEIM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>High above the endless traffic of the Sunset Strip, up in the hushed
haven of the hills, Kourosh Larizadeh greets visitors at a locked
gate and, with a gracious wave of the hand, invites them into his
world. His house is modest yet elegant, a 1961 Modernist residence
with stone floors and expansive windows that open onto lush greenery.
Plain white walls and flowing spaces allow the home to easily
accommodate a lot of art, but no one could have expected it to become
the shrine to the multifarious works of L.A.-based artist Mike Kelley
that Larizadeh has made.</LD>
<LD>   In the middle of the living room, on a lushly colored Persian
carpet, a white blanket supports a pile of all-white objects: a
couple of pompoms, a mask, a holder for facial tissues, two plastic
urinals and lots of crumpled fabric. This work, titled "White,
Off-White, Off-Off-White," which Kelley made in 1999, is a
centerpiece of Larizadeh's collection. To explain its meaning is in
no way simple, as its emotional impact depends on the viewer's own
sensibility. Reactions could range from wonderment--"What is a urinal
doing in the living room?"--to an immediate recognition of the work's
layered art historical references.</LD>
<TE>   It is the latter that absorbs Larizadeh: The work is, in part, an
hommage to Marcel Duchamp, who in 1917 raised the ire of the art
establishment and forever turned the art world upside down by
exhibiting an inverted urinal as a sculpture. But "White,
Off-White's" overlapping objects also recall the imagery of Picasso's
early Cubist paintings, which shattered the flat plane of a canvas
into a fractured mosaic. The mask evokes the drama of performance art
that has radically changed the art world of the last few decades and
has been an important component of Kelley's work, and the
white-white-whiteness recalls Kasimir Malevich's 1918 abstract
painting "Suprematist Composition: White on White." These nods to
Malevich's purist sensibility and Duchamp's down-and-dirty irony
address an essential friction within 20th century Modernism.</TE>
<TE>   If it takes more than a moment to absorb this one object, the same
can be said of virtually all of the art installed throughout the
house, where Larizadeh lives alone. The bulk of it is by Kelley and
the rest by a small number of other closely related artists,
including Paul McCarthy--a sometime collaborator with Kelley and a
renowned artist in his own right--and Richard Hawkins, a former
student of Kelley.</TE>
<TE>   An early work by Kelley, an elaborate birdhouse, sits on a kitchen
counter; the dining room table is covered with an array of the
artist's works, a plaster body cast by Kelley and McCarthy titled
"Heidi Sick Girl Molds" from 1992 dominates a room off the front
hall. Kelley's art, which includes many objects drawn from daily
life, dominates every aspect of the residence to the point where it's
hard to tell whether a piece of fabric draped across a chair is part
of a work, or just a blanket. Or whether an ashtray is an ashtray or
a valuable sculpture.</TE>
<TE>   Larizadeh's commitment to Kelley is a quintessential L.A. story,
one in which a sophisticated immigrant from a different culture falls
in love with work by an artist born in working-class Middle America
who came to maturity in this mecca of creativity. It rep- resents a
crossing of cultures that can happen easily in our cosmopolitan city,
but that also seems unique. In this house, there is the feeling that
something important is happening; together, this collector and this
artist are preserving an important moment in history.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm completely letting my ego go out the door," Larizadeh says of
his full-fledged commitment to Kelley's work. "It's not to do with
me, it's about the artist. I don't care what people think about me;
they can come here and laugh. They can come here and say, 'Are you
crazy?' I don't care. I just do what I like to do.</TE>
<TE>   "I made up my mind that he's a great artist; he's almost 50 years
old, he's incredibly influential on younger artists, he's a leading
figure of his generation, and I just went full force."</TE>
<TE>   The relationship began innocently enough. In 1987, Larizadeh, a
recent immigrant to L.A., was buying art sort of randomly, mostly
work by younger local artists that he could afford. He bought one
work by Kelley but didn't hold on to it for long, selling it to buy
something he wanted more. At the time, Larizadeh was just 25--he's 39
now--and he was searching for some kind of meaning in life.</TE>
<TE>   He'd been born in Iran but sent off to English boarding school at
14. His family was, he says, "a big industrial family under the
shah"--Muslim, but not overly focused on religion. Everything changed
for the Larizadehs during the Islamic revolution in 1979; the entire
family fled to England, where Kourosh was already ensconced. For the
first time, Kourosh found himself feeling disenfranchised, both from
his home and from his religious upbringing. By the time he finished
college in 1983, he wanted to make a big break, and in 1985 he moved
to Los Angeles to help start up a private commercial bank with an old
family friend.</TE>
<TE>   Art soon became Larizadeh's calling card, although he was more the
quiet intellectual in his pursuit than the kind of social aspirant
that often inhabits the art world. He'd started dabbling at
collecting in London, buying a Calder gouache at auction, but in L.A.
he got serious.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after landing here, Larizadeh says, he read an article about
a group of up-and-coming artists--Lari Pittman, Mike Kelley, Jim
Isermann and others--all of whom were pushing the artistic envelope,
combining performance, tough psychological explorations with art
historical references. All of these artists were living in L.A., and
all were beginning to create a new definition for Los Angeles art
that has since become an international phenomenon.</TE>
<TE>   In the early '80s, many of these artists were showing at the
Rosamund Felsen Gallery, and by 1986, Larizadeh was a devotee. Taking
a giant step away from that first Calder gouache, Larizadeh began to
acquire whatever he could afford by these artists and others, trading
up and challenging his taste along the way.</TE>
<TE>   In late 1993, Kelley--just 39 at the time--was celebrated in a
major exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York
that later came to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. It was a
watershed moment for Larizadeh, who went to see the retrospective in
both cities.</TE>
<TE>   "When I saw that show, I decided that he's a very, very, very
important artist," Larizadeh explained as he gave a tour of his house
and collection recently. Speaking softly yet emphatically, he takes
pains to convey the power of his convictions. "At the time, there was
an art world recession, and I had begun questioning a lot of art and
what it meant. Because of the market, but also because of the art
that was being made in L.A. since the early 1980s, I really thought
that these artists represented the end of Modernism, the conclusion
of a great era that began in late 19th century France."</TE>
<TE>   Larizadeh stops himself to pull out a copy of a 1993 article in
Art and Auction magazine about Kelley by the critic Dan Cameron. "As
far as I'm concerned," Cameron wrote, "Kelley isn't just your
run-of-the-mill artist who happens to be showing at the Whitney. For
me, in a way that I'm not completely comfortable with, he's the only
artist that really matters."</TE>
<TE>   "At the time," Larizadeh says now, "I took [Cameron] literally.
Now, years later ... " his voice trails off ... "when you ask me how
many objects by Mike Kelley I have, I can't even say."</TE>
<TE>   In assembling such a focused and obsessive environment, Museum of
Contemporary Art chief curator Paul Schimmel says, Larizadeh's home
recalls other collectors of eras, such as the late 19th century
Symbolists, who made it stylish to turn a home into a gallery of
devotion.</TE>
<TE>   It is not uncommon for Kelley's work to inspire this kind of
devotion, says Patrick Painter, who since 1995 has been the artist's
primary representative on the West Coast and who has worked closely
with Larizadeh to acquire works. Admired by critics, curators and
collectors since the early 1980s, Kelley has a devout following,
particularly in Europe. Painter, whose gallery is in Santa Monica,
mentions the art-book publisher Benedikt Taschen as another collector
who buys Kelley's work in depth. "But Kourosh is doing it with a lot
less money," Painter says. "He's collecting periods that a lot of
people are overlooking, before the prices get ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   Ridiculous prices are in the eye of the beholder. A Kelley drawing
sells for about $5,000 and a major Kelley sculpture can go for
$200,000, Painter says. The most expensive are the works that he is
best known for, the "stuffed-animal pieces," which assemble varying
arrangements of used and often decrepit children's playthings, often
on baby blankets, evoking poignant images of innocence lost.</TE>
<TE>   These well-known pieces are not what Larizadeh collects, however.
He has early works from Kelley's student days as well as paintings
and assemblages from pivotal but often less famous developments in
the artist's career. And he has focused on one major all-encompassing
work that could likely keep him connected to Kelley for a lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993 in the Netherlands, Kelley first exhibited an ongoing
project called "The Uncanny," explorations into Sigmund Freud's
concept of "the uncanny"--mys- terious, undefinable, even frightening
feelings recalled in relation to experiences or objects. For Kelley,
this has meant tracking down and showing objects familiar from his
own childhood: his marble collection, for example. It has also
allowed him to exhibit a variety of seemingly random objects that
have powerful associations for the artist, which can vary from
pornography to bubble-gum cards.</TE>
<TE>   A major component of "The Uncanny" has turned out to be a
collection of collections, dubbed "The Harems." These, Larizadeh
explains, are "about many things, including memory and recollection,
confusion, horror, anxieties, repetition, hoarding and collecting."
Kelley continues to add to what has become a massive work--each
element contains an indeterminate number of pieces that the artist
says could continue to grow for the rest of his life. Larizadeh owns
the whole thing, and he estimates that the piece now consists of more
than 3,000 objects--all of them selected by the artist, none of them
handmade.</TE>
<TE>   Such a large quantity means, of course, that not all the elements
can be displayed at once; part of the work is in storage, and Kelley
is holding onto major portions, some for research for his art, such
as a group of postcards and comic books, some for daily use, such as
ashtrays he uses for company. He says he'll turn each component over
when he's finished with it. He's also holding onto a group of squeeze
toys, also part of "The Harems," whose noises he uses for music he
performs.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1999, I acquired Kelley's 'Harems' and 'The Uncanny,'"
Larizadeh wrote in a brief statement prepared for a visitor asking
about the collection. "Actually, this goes back to late 1997. Kelley
was visiting me and recognized a drawing of his from 1982-83, which
he remarked was meant to be part of a suite that had been purchased
by the Museum of Modern Art in New York. He wanted it for MOMA. I
said I would swap it with him for his "Six Bent Coat Hangers and One
Antenna Used to Break into Cars, (Harem No. 5)," found objects he had
recovered at the parking lots at Los Angeles airport. I had coveted
these for a very long time. He agreed. In April 1999, I purchased
everything else. It was a very complex transaction, all based on
trust and goodwill."</TE>
<TE>   Notable among the objects are piles and piles of church banners,
many of which are stacked in a front room at Larizadeh's house, only
a few of which are hanging on the walls. To Larizadeh, they represent
the hours of love and labor of their makers. He likes them for their
colors, the way they drape, and he can arrange them and rearrange
them as he likes. For Kelley, they are references to his Catholic
upbringing and have served as source material for banners he made
himself.</TE>
<TE>   For a collector, owning "The Harems" is both a dream come true and
a potential nightmare. Kelley is in charge, he can pass on what he
wishes, when he wishes. He can create a new collection of any scale
and Larizadeh has taken charge of preserving it all. It is a calling
that Larizadeh embraces, but he recognizes it requires a kind of
effort and accommodation not many people would so readily undertake.</TE>
<TE>   As the collection has grown, Kelley and Larizadeh have become
friends. In a conversation, Kelley called him "one of the few
collectors I know personally." Known for being extremely exacting
about how his work is represented and described, Kelley nevertheless
says, "I'm not all that social; I usually keep my distance from
collectors. They should be free to have their own desires about what
they get from the work."</TE>
<TE>   Larizadeh's interest and proximity--most of Kelley's patrons do
not live in Los Angeles--have brought them together, however. Kelley
likes the fact that Larizadeh often buys things that are not
market-driven, such as sculptures once used as props in performances,
often overlooked by collectors. "You can always tell the difference
between an investment collector and someone who's really interested
in the work," Kelley says. Often Larizadeh has asked the artist for
guidance on how to install works, only to be gently rebuffed, such as
when "White, Off-White" arrived at his house stuffed in two garbage
bags.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a really hard time letting himself organize it," Kelley
says. "He wanted me to come to his house and do it for him. I
refused." Kelley says he does not believe the arrangement of objects
in his works control their meaning. Kelley lets Larizadeh do what he
wants, and both artist and collector say they don't talk about the
work very much together. They share other interests, however.
Larizadeh is an avid EBay and thrift-store buff and has often sought
out obscure magazines and other objects he knows might interest
Kelley. He's even found church banners and offered them to the artist
for possible inclusion in "The Harems." Any decision about what is or
isn't art, however, is always up to Kelley. "I operate as a lowly
studio assistant," Larizadeh says.</TE>
<TE>   At Larizadeh's house, there is a kind of hushed reverence for the
work. Russell Ferguson, chief curator at the UCLA Hammer Museum,
calls Larizadeh "one of the most passionate and focused collectors in
Los Angeles." Although so much of the incidental space in his home is
devoted to art, Larizadeh often entertains visitors, both for study
reasons and for social events.</TE>
<TE>   He does this because he likes to share these works that have
rarely been seen. "It's a beautiful home, and a large proportion of
it is devoted to the work," Ferguson says. "He's getting a lot out of
these works on a daily basis."</TE>
<TE>   Ferguson and MOCA's Schimmel both point out that Larizadeh has
been very generous to the Los Angeles art community. Over the years
he has given major works to MOCA, many of them by Los Angeles
artists. At the end of last year, he made donations of 21 works to
MOCA, 11 to the Hammer, and an additional 15 to the Luckman Fine Arts
complex at Cal State L.A. None of these works is by Kelley, but they
include well-known as well as younger L.A. artists such as Jorge
Pardo, Chris Finley and Pentti Monkkonen.</TE>
<TE>   The gifts represent Larizadeh's commitment to L.A., both its
artists and its museums, but they are also a way for Larizadeh to
maintain focus in his holdings. As it did for many, the events of
Sept. 11 shook Larizadeh to the core. He says he was reminded of his
feeling of loss when his own country was taken over, and of his anger
at religious zealots. As a result, he has felt even more strongly
committed to his home of nearly two decades (he became a citizen in
1995). L.A.'s art--so foreign to the culture he grew up in--is at the
heart of his connection.</TE>
<TE>   "I began thinking about art now, and how a painting no longer
looks the same, since Sept. 11. But then, I thought, a true artist
always speaks the truth, and wars don't change that."</TE>
<TE>   Art, for Larizadeh, is the primary source of salvation and meaning
in life. He says he thinks about it even as he does his work as a
banker. He often looks at what he owns with fresh eyes and is always
willing to talk about it more, to explore it.</TE>
<TE>   To describe the relationship, he turns to a quote from Duchamp,
the ultimate conceptual artist, the man without whom no art would
look the same today.</TE>
<TE>   "Duchamp described the relationship between artist and viewer as
'one indefinitely stalled at the stage of courtship.' That is exactly
the relationship I have with Kelley's work. I never really understand
where they are from, and I think that's the seduction. If I were to
understand it, then I think I would lose my interest."</TE>

<DH>Depending on whom you ask, nonjudgmentalism is the root of
moral chaos or a treasured American virtue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>C. W. Meisterfeld doesn't want to sound judgmental, but, he says,
people are like dogs. Now, if Vince Lombardi or Martha Stewart had
posited this, it might be a condemnation. But the observation comes
from the "Dog Whisperer," and he's not judging; he's just stating how
things are. There's no good or bad here.</LD>
<LD>   The longtime Petaluma dog trainer believes that neither men nor
beasts can be their best--or even well behaved--if they are
constantly being judged. And since humans are the ones doing the
judging, the trick is to get them to shut it off. Wait a minute. Is
this really the "right" way to introduce a story about
nonjudgmentalism? Maybe it should (oh, no, "should" is a judging
word!) have started with the simple question: What is
nonjudgmentalism?</LD>
<LD>   In fact, "Blah, blah, blah, nonjudgmentalism" may have been just
fine too. Who's to judge?</LD>
<TE>   As "isms" go, "nonjudgmentalism" hasn't been around very long,
probably less than a decade, say linguists. It's not even in many
dictionaries. And yet within this short span, the word has penetrated
the culture. Everyone from the Birkenstock crowd to Brooks Bros.
types regularly invokes the principles of nonjudgmentalism for the
sake of tapping inner healing powers or improving the bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   "It really can mean the difference between a successful and an
unsuccessful business," said Hedria Lunken, a New York business
consultant who has worked with Fortune 500 companies. "If someone is
judging all the time, believe me, you're going to get employees who
shut up and just sit at their desks and do nothing."</TE>
<TE>   As it spread, nonjudgmentalism--the practice of and belief in
suspending judgment of others for the betterment of self and
society--has inspired, comforted, confused and angered Americans as
few other "isms" have. It has commanded praise for everything from
transforming business problems into "opportunities" to promoting a
more diverse, tolerant and multicultural society. To supporters, the
concept has great personal rewards as well. Stress reduction, a
release from fear-based living and a deeper connection to humanity
await those who can put aside their judgments.</TE>
<TE>   Few may believe this as heartily as Jon Schreiber, director of the
Breema Center just outside Berkeley, which promotes health and
wellness through stretch, movement and other body work. The center
believes being nonjudgmental--an act that mind and body must pursue
simultaneously--is essential for existing in the moment, a state that
fosters emotional, physical and spiritual well-being.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are nonjudgmental, you totally accept the other person
exactly as they are," said Schreiber, who offers a workshop called
"The Nonjudgmental Treatment," which through touch and relaxation
techniques promises to give balance to a person. "Most people have
never experienced even a moment of that because they are too closed
off and fearful of being judged."</TE>
<TE>   Still, nothing raises the hackles of some people faster than
nonjudgmentalism. To them, it symbolizes the threadbare moral
condition of the nation and threatens to rob citizens of their
ability to make clear ethical distinctions--a skill of fundamental
importance to a tolerant democratic society.</TE>
<TE>   Nonjudgmentalism is a bugaboo of sorts for modern times. In recent
weeks it has been blamed for the traitorous behavior of an American
Taliban soldier and, in part, the Enron scandal.</TE>
<TE>   "As a society, we seem increasingly incapable of sitting in
judgment of each other," wrote Robert Bartley in a Wall Street
Journal article about Enron. "What kind of behavior can an 'I'm OK,
you're OK' society expect from its professionals or business
leaders?"</TE>
<TE>   Nonjudgmentalism is largely a postmodern twist on an old
philosophical struggle that seeks to balance justice and compassion.
The debate over the two forces reaches back to the world's most
revered religious and historical figures, which helps explain some of
today's widespread acceptance--and confusion--over the concept.</TE>
<TE>   In Western culture, Jesus issued the most famous admonition
regarding judgment some 2,000 years ago: "Judge not, that you be not
judged." Most Americans, whether Christian or not, can quote this
excerpt from the Sermon on the Mount. Jesus' use of the word stood in
stark contrast to its role in the Old Testament, in which judgments
often presaged a harsh punishment from God.</TE>
<TE>   On its face, the passage from the Book of Matthew sounds like a
straightforward injunction against judging others--an interpretation
that is more in line with some present-day views. (Russian author Leo
Tolstoy favored abolishing judgment and criminal systems altogether.)
But according to biblical scholars, ending all judgments was not what
Jesus meant. What most don't know or forget is that two verses later,
Jesus added: "And why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye,
but do not consider the plank in your own eye?"</TE>
<TE>   "Jesus was not making a blanket statement against judgments,
against doing justice," said the Rev. Stephen J. Patterson, a
professor of the New Testament at Eden Theological Society in St.
Louis. "He is saying don't be a hypocrite."</TE>
<TE>   Centuries later, Abraham Lincoln, in his second inaugural address,
broadened the biblical usage of judgment to include an element of
compassion. In his speech, delivered about a month before the end of
the Civil War, Lincoln tried to quell hawkish Northern critics who
demanded severe punishment of the wayward South.</TE>
<TE>   "It may seem strange," Lincoln said in explaining that both sides
sought the same divine help, "that any man should dare to ask a just
God's assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other
men's faces; but let us not judge that we be not judged."</TE>
<TE>   The plea for mercy toward the vanquished South ultimately failed
to take hold, but the president's vision about judging others would
nevertheless leave a powerful cultural stamp. "Lincoln's words asking
that the nation 'judge not' may have been appreciated in the short
term and would be remembered in the long term," said Ronald C. White
Jr., author of the newly published "Lincoln's Greatest Speech: The
Second Inaugural" (Simon &amp; Schuster).. "But they were not acted
upon."</TE>
<TE>   It's upon this rich historical base that the modern-day notion of
nonjudgmentalism has been built. Beginning in the 1960s, when
American society was undergoing profound social and political
changes, the long-held notion of an objective truth fell by the
wayside.</TE>
<TE>   "Our culture started believing around this time that there is no
one reality," said Susan K. Perry, a Los Angeles-based social
psychologist. "I think that made people reluctant to express their
values and left them feeling, 'Who am I to judge?'"</TE>
<TE>   Thus, without a clear sense of right and wrong, "being judgmental"
soon took on an increasingly pejorative connotation. After all, the
damaging and often-cruel consequences of judging others were plain to
see. Judgments proclaimed that rock music was evil, long hair was bad
and people with dark skin were inferior.</TE>
<TE>   Psychotherapists and 12-step programs soon joined the cause,
arguing that judgmental words fuel addictive behavior. Whether it was
booze, drugs or gambling, the destructive behavior was driven in part
by the person seeking a refuge from relentless internal and external
judgments, therapists say. Furthermore, judgments were seen as
barriers to personal intimacy. When one partner labels the other as,
say, "defensive" or "selfish," he or she is discouraging the total
acceptance necessary for love.</TE>
<TE>   But social critics respond that the new brand of nonjudgmentalism
is self-indulgent nonsense. It's a conceit to say that people can
stop judging others altogether, and what's more, they shouldn't try.
Judgments must be made or moral chaos is the result, they argue in
the media.</TE>
<TE>   Critics pounced on the example provided by the parents of John
Walker Lindh, the young American who was called a traitor for
fighting with the Taliban. Boston Globe columnist Jeff Jacoby wrote:
"Devout practitioners of the self-obsessed nonjudgmentalism for which
the Bay Area is renowned, [his parents] appear never to have rebuked
their son or criticized his choices. In their world, there were no
absolutes, no fixed truths, no mandatory behavior, no
thou-shalt-nots. If they had one conviction, it was that all
convictions are worthy--that nothing is intolerable except
intolerance."</TE>
<TE>   Equally spirited attacks on the culture of nonjudgmentalism have
emerged from college campuses. Fred Baumann, a political science
professor at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, says he shares the
quiet campus with students, faculty and an amorphous entity he calls
"Camp Nonjudgmental."</TE>
<TE>   Nonjudgmentalists "operate in a schizophrenic manner," he said.
"They make the mistake of saying that not making judgments is the
same thing as being tolerant. It's not. If you want tolerance, you
have to think something is right. And that requires making
judgments."</TE>
<TE>   The hesitancy to judge has created a moral paralysis among some
students, said Robert Simon, a philosophy professor at Hamilton
College in Clinton, N.Y. Simon reports that as many as one-fifth of
his students, while well-meaning, ultimately refuse to morally
denounce the Holocaust, slavery and human sacrifice.</TE>
<TE>   (Curiously, many college professors note, students usually have
little trouble in harshly judging smoking, failing to recycle and
eating meat.)</TE>
<TE>   "I think sometimes students are just protecting themselves," said
Simon. "If they come out with a politically incorrect statement, they
can really get hammered."</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, advocates of nonjudgmentalism feel they are
being unfairly judged by their critics. Of course, people have to
make choices--what clothes to wear, what friends to have and so on.
But this is called "discernment" or "evaluation"--not judgment--said
dog trainer Meisterfeld and others. The way to distinguish them is
that none of them, except "judgment," carries a moral condemnation.
"If you go into a store to get tomatoes and you see one bad tomato,
you don't judge it," Meisterfeld said. "You just keep walking until
you get a good one."</TE>
<TE>   Whether it's the influence of Jesus or the postmodern movement, or
both, Americans are uncomfortable with judging others, discovered
Alan Wolfe, a sociologist at Boston College. The professor conducted
hundreds of interviews over several years in researching his books on
morality and found that Americans overwhelmingly regarded
nonjudgmentalism as a key national virtue.</TE>
<TE>   "It comes up spontaneously," said Wolfe, author of "Moral Freedom:
The Search for Virtue in a World of Choice." "People just say, 'I
don't want to be judgmental.'" Most of them also reported it was an
insight they'd come to on their own rather than through a specific
teaching.</TE>
<TE>   "My profession is no different," said Wolfe. "It's hard giving
someone a C or a D. Grade inflation is a classic case of
nonjudgmentalism."</TE>

<CX>   Hamilton College--A Jan. 27 Southern California Living story about
judging others mistakenly reported that one-fifth of students in
professor Robert Simon's classes at Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y.,
were unwilling to morally condemn the Holocaust. Although about a fifth
of Simon's students professed to be "nonjudgmental," only a small
fraction of them said they would not condemn the Holocaust.</CX>

<TE>   by Bill Peet</TE>
<TE>   A dog named Scamp wants to be a horse because everybody likes to
watch the horse down the road. Scamp thinks his owner likes the horse
more than him. Scamp is sad and decides to run away into the forest,
where he meets a witch.</TE>
<TE>   Scamp tells the witch he wants to be a horse, but the witch says
she knows something better than a horse--a whingdingdilly!</TE>
<TE>   She turns him into one. The whingdingdilly has zebra and elephant
legs, horns, a camel hump and a rhino nose.</TE>
<TE>   Read the book to find out what Scamp realizes in the end. I liked

<LD>I was rummaging frantically through my purse, searching for the pass
that would secure my admission to the parking lot at USC, where I was
scheduled--and running late--to speak. I came up empty, but breathed
a sigh of relief as I pulled up to the parking kiosk. "Thank
goodness," I said out loud, to myself. "The guard is black."</LD>
<LD>   From the backseat, a protest erupted. "Why does it matter?" my
10-year-old asked, her voice tinged with irritation. "What difference
does it make that the parking-lot guy is black?"</LD>
<LD>   I shushed her as I pulled up to his window, smiled and launched my
explanation: "No, I don't have the parking sticker they sent me. I
had it, but I lost it and ... well, I'm in a hurry. Maybe I'm on a
list or something?" I was not, but he scribbled a pass, taped it to
my windshield and waved me through. I smiled smugly at my daughter.
"That's why it matters," I said. "When I saw he was black, I figured
he would be nicer to me, more understanding than someone else might."
I was struggling to explain why that wasn't prejudice and didn't make
me racist as we hustled into the auditorium. The panel discussion I
was to lead--on affirmative action in college admissions--was about
to begin.</LD>
<TE>   I hustled my daughter off to the side and tried to banish her
questions from my mind, and I announced my topic to the crowd:
"Should Race Matter? How Much and Why?"</TE>
<TE>   We are fresh off a round of celebrations honoring the late Martin
Luther King Jr. and his "content of their character" vision. And we
are heading into Black History Month, with its focus on the color of
our skin as a central cultural connection. It is a paradox as rich
and tangled as this country's history of race relations.</TE>
<TE>   Can we judge one another without regard to color? Does ethnic
pride trump equality? Can we be both color blind and race proud? Have
we lost our zeal for integration in our zest to promote group
identity?</TE>
<TE>   Some would say we clearly have, that we've hyphenated ourselves
into a collection of tribal families; allowed our emphasis on
multiculturalism and diversity to overshadow our cultural kinship,
even threaten our national harmony.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever the benefits of the new separatism in promoting pride
and self-esteem, the overlay of anger and alienation that comes with
it is poisoning our lives," writes race scholar Tamara Jacoby in her
book "Someone Else's House: America's Unfinished Struggle for
Integration" (Free Press, 1998)</TE>
<TE>   But anger and alienation are not just the domain of those troubled
by our focus on ethnic pride. For too long, those of us poisoned by
ignorance of our culture carried our own burdens of pain and shame.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it is different for children these days. They have black
astronauts and scientists and presidential advisors. Their history
books are filled with references to African Americans we never heard
of when I was growing up and stories we were never told. They need
look no further for inspiration than the nightly news, at the success
of Colin Powell, Oprah Winfrey, Michael Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   But I can remember, as a child, sitting shamefaced among my white
classmates, as our American history lessons reduced my ancestors'
stories to footnotes, my would-be heroes to caricatures. The
sociologists can pooh-pooh self-esteem and race pride, but I still
recall how much it hurt to believe that I had come from a race of
people too simple and timid to stand up for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   And I remember when those shackles came off. Black History, 12th
grade. I had stumbled into the class, looking for a way out of
another semester of history that revolved around wars and dates. Much
of it was territory we had been through before. But this time, we
learned that Africa was more than a string of backward tribes, saved
from savagery by Europeans. And slaves were not the shuffling puppets
we'd been taught to imagine, but had fought for their freedom long
before the Civil War.</TE>
<TE>   Our history was not just Harriet Tubman and George Washington
Carver, but thousands of years of ingenuity and bravery and strength.
It seems so simple now, but the revelation sent my classmates and me
brimming with confidence and a sense of power into a still-hostile
world.</TE>
<TE>   And our history was not all we learned that semester, because the
unlikely instrument of our salvation was a blond woman wearing Earth
shoes and love beads, who moved through the class banging on our
desks, grabbing us by the shoulders, shouting when she thought we
were falling asleep.</TE>
<TE>   Before "Roots," before "Black is Beautiful" even, she preached
that knowledge is power, and self-knowledge makes you unconquerable.
She taught us about self-reliance and self-respect, using stories of
trials our ancestors faced. And she taught us about respecting
others, just as she respected us.</TE>
<TE>   And if I could learn from a white lady to honor my black history,
then just maybe my daughter and I were both right. Maybe race matters
plenty, and not at all. And maybe I could have gotten into that
parking lot even if a black man hadn't been at the gate.</TE>

<LD>Gospel Brunch</LD>
<LD>   The Ebell Club of Los Angeles was packed to capacity with the
overflow seated in the garden for the fourth annual Gospel Brunch to
benefit the "I Have a Dream" Foundation of Los Angeles and Pasadena.
More than 600 guests turned out for last Sunday's event, which
honored David E. Kelley's and Fox Television's "Boston Public" for
its realistic portrayal of an inner-city high school, and attorney
Barry Edwards, former chairman of the foundation board, whose efforts
have raised more than $1 million and who also helped develop a
relationship between IHAD and Sylvan Learning Centers.</LD>
<LD>   This year's event raised $800,000, thanks in part to response to a
challenge grant from the Whittier Family Foundation. The funds are
earmarked for the adoption of another first-grade class of "Dreamers"
in East L.A.</LD>
<TE>   The "I Have a Dream" Foundation was created in 1981, when New York
businessman Eugene Lang offered college tuition to a class of
sixth-graders in East Harlem. Ninety percent completed high school;
60% went to college.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1987, IHAD of L.A. has served more than 700 low-income
students in South-Central and Pasadena. "Our commitment is to help
only the neediest among us," said Harold C. Haizlip, executive
director of the foundation. "We find a school where 99% of the
families are at the lowest income level. Most people look at the
pathology of second-class citizens and don't have much hope for these
youngsters. I say it's just the circumstances of their birth ... it
shouldn't be a sentence for life."</TE>
<TE>   Marlene Canter and Kelly Goode Abugov co-chaired the event, which
was emceed by Lisa Gay Hamilton of ABC's "The Practice" and featured
performances by gospel singer Linda Hopkins and the God's Gift of
Light Choir from North Hollywood's First Baptist Church, directed by
Sharlia Boyer.</TE>
<TE>   Spotted in the crowd were "Boston Public" stars Kathy Baker and
Loretta Devine; Michelle Ruiz; Susan Medel; Beth Colt; Carol and
Chris McGuire; Linda Blinkenberg; Susan Sprung; Christopher Keyser;
Anne and Christopher Higgins; Win Rhodes; Arlo Sorensen; Rick
Greenthal; Portia Collins; Charles Fradin; Keith Gorham; Grant

<TE>   Steinway Spirit</TE>
<TE>   Three generations of the Steinway family were on hand for the
Spirit of Life Awards Dinner at the Beverly Hills Hotel to benefit
Music for Kids USA. Henry Z. Steinway, president emeritus of Steinway
&amp; Sons, whose great-grandfather founded the renowned American piano
company in 1853, was the honoree at the event, which was sponsored by
the International Foundation for Education &amp; Performing Arts.
Ironically, neither Henry nor his son nor grandson plays the piano.</TE>
<TE>   "Henry is the absolute icon of the piano-manufacturing world,"
said his longtime friend Roger Williams, honorary chairman of the
evening, who presented the award. "1955 was a very special year for
Henry and me," Williams recalled. "He became president of Steinway,
and I recorded 'Autumn Leaves.' Henry was a terrible pianist then.
Now, nearly 50 years later, things haven't changed. He claims he
doesn't play because he has two handicaps--his right hand and his
left hand!"</TE>
<TE>   Williams, the 2000 awardee, is a national music mentor for the
foundation project, which he named Music for Kids USA. Jazz pianist
David Benoit received the Music Mentor of the Year Award for his
hands-on participation in the foundation's programs, which bring
noted artists into Los Angeles public schools, provide scholarships
and pianos, and sponsor debut recitals for young musicians. Benoit
had to be in Ohio to conduct the Toledo Symphony. His wife, Kei,
accepted the award on his behalf. Event chairwoman Dana Broccoli also
sent regrets from London, where she's involved with the stage
production of "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang."</TE>
<TE>   Among attendees at the Jan. 19 event were Benoit's protege Andrew
Pae, a 13-year-old virtuoso from Anaheim Hills, who dazzled the
audience with excerpts from Mozart's Sonata 18 and Chopin's
"Fantaisie Impromptu"; recording artist Althea Waites, who played
Brahms' Rhapsody in B Minor, Opus 79; and Williams, who topped off
the program with "All the Things You Are" (a favorite of Polly
Steinway, Henry's wife of 57 years), followed by his signature piece,
"Autumn Leaves." All performed on the ornate Alma-Tadema Steinway, a
one-of-a-kind grand piano valued at $695,000. On display was a
chartreuse piano with glass keys created by artist Dale Chihuly for
the opening of the Winter Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Miniature mirrored grand pianos autographed by Henry Steinway and
filled with white roses centered the tables, where more than 200

<TE>   Community leaders gathered at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa to
preview a new exhibit, "Orange County 2002," which showcases capital
improvements being made by nonprofit groups in the area. Using
models, photographs and artists' renderings, organizations such as
Mission San Juan Capistrano, UCI Medical Center and Chapman
University are using the installations to tell the stories of their
proposed expansions.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to recognize nonprofits involved in major capital
campaigns for expansion, renovation or improvement," said Billur
Wallerich, director of community relations for South Coast Plaza.
About 100 guests gathered at Troquet restaurant Jan. 15 for a
cocktail reception celebrating the exhibit, which continues through
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Among the projects depicted is the proposed new UCI Medical Center
in Orange, which will begin construction in 2005. "We're raising a
total of $320 million--already we have $235 million from the state in
seed money," said Al De Grassi, a UCI Foundation board member. "This
show is really helping us get the word out."</TE>

<LD>It was Rachel's birthday.</LD>
<LD>   Her mother gave her the blue sweatshirt with a big teddy bear on
it that Rachel had wanted. Her brother Matt gave her a new journal to
write in.</LD>
<LD>   Then Rachel opened the envelope that said, "To Rachel from Dad."
There were two pieces of paper inside. One was a note.</LD>
<TE>   "Dear Rachel," the note said,</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sorry I have to be away on your birthday. I had Matt make up
a crossword puzzle to tell you where to find the special present that
I got for you.</TE>
<TE>   Happy birthday, Dad"</TE>
<TE>   "A crossword puzzle!" Rachel said. And she took it out of the
envelope. "But there aren't any clues on it."</TE>
<TE>   "I'll give them to you," Matt said.</TE>
<TE>   Rachel got a pencil.</TE>
<TE>   "Ready?" Matt asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," Rachel said.</TE>
<TE>   "First clue. Number 1, down." Matt said. "The room where cooking
is done."</TE>
<TE>   "That's easy," Rachel said. And she printed "k-i-t-c-h-e-n."</TE>
<TE>   "Right!" Matt said. "Next. Number 2, across. Where cans and boxes
of food are kept."</TE>
<TE>   Rachel frowned. She thought for a minute.</TE>
<TE>   Then she said, "Oh! I think I know!" She counted the spaces to see
if she was right.</TE>
<TE>   And then she printed p-a-n-t-r-y.</TE>
<TE>   "Good for you," Matt said. "That was a hard clue. Are you ready
for the next one?"</TE>
<TE>   Rachel nodded.</TE>
<TE>   "The shelf that is the opposite of top," Matt said.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't put the answer," Rachel said.</TE>
<TE>   "Why not?" Matt asked.</TE>
<TE>   "You didn't tell me where it goes." Rachel said.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh! Sorry," Matt said. "Number 3, down."</TE>
<TE>   Rachel printed the answer in the right place.</TE>
<TE>   "Next clue," said Matt. "Number 3, across. If it's not in front,
it's ..."</TE>
<TE>   "Behind!" shouted Rachel. And she put it in the puzzle.</TE>
<TE>   "Last clue," Matt said. "Number 4, across. Another name for hot
chocolate."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh! Oh!" Rachel jumped up and ran to get her special birthday
present. It was a necklace with a heart on it.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh my, how beautiful!" Rachel said. "I love it!"</TE>
<TE>   Do you know where Rachel found her present?</TE>
<TE>   Answers to puzzle: 1 down, "kitchen"; 2 across, "pantry"; 3 down,
"bottom"; 3 across, "behind"; 4 across, "cocoa."</TE>

<HD>When a Woman Blows the Whistle</HD>
<DH>Females may be treated more harshly by colleagues and the
public.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA BROTMAN</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sherron Watkins, Enron vice president of corporate development, wrote
a letter in August to Enron CEO Kenneth Lay warning that the company
could collapse under the weight of accounting and ethical
improprieties. Four months later, it did. The company now faces
criminal and regulatory investigation.</LD>
<LD>   With her now-famous letter warning precisely how Enron Corp. could
collapse, written four months before it did, Enron Vice President
Sherron Watkins joins the ranks of people who have seen wrongdoing
and blown a whistle on it.</LD>
<LD>   Some other prominent whistle-blowers have been women. Perhaps the
best known is Karen Silkwood. A lab analyst at a Kerr-McGee plutonium
fuel rod plant in Oklahoma, Silkwood accused the company of unsafe
practices. She was killed in a suspicious car accident in 1974, and
became a heroine to labor, feminist and environmental groups, and the
subject of a movie.</LD>
<TE>   Tammy Raynor was the central whistle-blower in a
licenses-for-bribes scandal in Illinois. A former driver's license
examiner, Raynor brought to light corruption in the secretary of
state's office. Since 1998, 40 people have been convicted of
wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   There is no correlation between taking this kind of stand and
gender, said Stephen Kohn, board chairman of the National
Whistleblower Center, a nonprofit advocacy organization that assists
whistle-blowers and one of the nation's leading legal experts on
whistle-blowing. "What motivates a whistle-blower is gender-neutral,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, it is more common for a whistle-blower to be a man, said
Lynne Bernabei, a Washington lawyer whose firm specializes in
representing whistle-blowers nationwide. Women, she said, are less
likely to reach professional positions high enough to be privy to the
kind of information that could make them whistle-blowers.</TE>
<TE>   "And women are much more cynical about the system," she said. "The
typical whistle-blower is a believer in the system.... Typically,
it's a white man who has been very much in the power structure and
who comes up against something he just can't stomach and believes
that if you just bring it to the proper people, it will be taken care
of. Then they get fired."</TE>
<TE>   Watkins was not fired from Enron; she remains vice president of
corporate development at the energy-trading firm. After the
licenses-for-bribes scandal broke, Raynor was appointed an
investigator with the secretary of state's inspector general's
office, with responsibility for evaluating commercial driver's
license facilities throughout the state and reporting any corruption.</TE>
<TE>   Gender differences often arise, however, in how a female
whistle-blower is treated, Kohn said. "You're going to face
retaliation, some form of professional or personal insult," whether
you are a male or female, he said. "But if you're a female, there's a
strong chance they will look at your appearance and your sex life,
and use that as a basis to insult you or issue derogatory statements.
That will not happen with a male."</TE>
<TE>   That's what happened to Linda Tripp, he said, the former Pentagon
assistant who secretly tape-recorded the confidences of her friend
Monica Lewinsky. Many people revile Tripp as a snoop and betrayer, he
said, but he considers her a whistle-blower, and an extremely
effective one.</TE>
<TE>   "Linda Tripp [brought about] an impeachment of a president, a
finding that a sitting president was in contempt of court, a
suspension of a president's license to practice law," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins' lawyer has hesitated to call her a whistle-blower, saying
that her actions could be seen as whistle-blowing or just doing her
job responsibly.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins wrote a seven-page letter detailing practices that she
warned could make Enron "implode in a wave of accounting scandals,"
and offering advice on how to resolve the situation.</TE>
<TE>   She sent the letter to Enron Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay,
anonymously at first and then acknowledging it as hers. Lay met with
her and a Houston law firm conducted a review, but the lawyers
decided that her allegations did not warrant further investigation.
Six weeks later, Enron filed for bankruptcy. The company now faces
criminal and regulatory investigation, and its practices are being
examined by six congressional committees.</TE>
<TE>   She never made the letter public. It was found by congressional
investigators going through Enron documents, and released by the
chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins' actions parallel those of other whistle-blowers, Kohn
said. "The fact that she went to the CEO is typical," he said. "She's
not disloyal; she wants to help the company. By taking it to someone
in the company, it's a way of satisfying both your moral sense of
right and wrong, and your loyalty to the company."</TE>
<TE>   Whistle-blowers generally fit two categories, Kohn said. "The
first is those who do it for a moral reason. They know something is
wrong and they can't live with themselves unless they do something
about it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The second is the unintended whistle-blower, who raises concerns
like a normal person would raise them, but because of the dysfunction
within the institution they raise concerns about, they get retaliated
against. And what often happens is, the two categories get merged."</TE>
<TE>   Whistle-blowers tend to have an independent moral structure, he
said, that makes them question superiors' assurances that the
company's actions are correct.</TE>
<TE>   How is Watkins' role likely to be judged? Kohn said it depends on
who is doing the judging and how they feel about the practices she
exposed. For example, the general public regards tobacco industry
whistle-blowers as courageous, he said, but tobacco company employees
consider them disloyal.</TE>
<TE>   Bernabei warned that even when whistle-blowers turn out to be
prescient in their warnings, they are rarely rewarded by their
institutions. "The reality is, nobody wants to say, 'You told us so;
you should be in a better position because you had wiser vision,'"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   But Charles Elson, director of the Center for Corporate Governance
at the University of Delaware, thinks that is exactly how Watkins
will be perceived. "She had the courage to come forward. She kind of
called it; that took a lot of guts. I would say someone like that
comes out a heroine, not a snitch."</TE>

<KH>OSAMA BIN LADEN</KH>
<HD>Yesterday's Hero Now a Mere Memory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ZAFFAR ABBAS</AU>
<BD>Zaffar Abbas is a Pakistani journalist who writes
regularly for The Herald, a monthly magazine, and reports for BBC
radio.</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD</DL>
<LD>Hero worship is part and parcel of the South Asian psyche, most
assuredly among Pakistani Muslims. But memories also tend to be short
here, and someone who looms larger than life one day can be all but
forgotten the next.</LD>
<LD>   Pakistan's history is rife with examples of such short-lived fame,
the most recent being the meteoric rise and fall of Osama bin Laden.
A month ago, the world's premier terrorist was hailed in the local
press as a true and righteous hero of the Muslim world. The media's
glowing tributes were echoed by many Pakistanis, for whom Bin Laden
represented the vanguard of a growing Islamic movement against
U.S.-led Western imperialism.</LD>
<LD>   But times have changed, almost overnight, and so has the Pakistani
media's depiction of the Saudi dissident-turned-holy warrior. Aside
from the occasional cartoon or passing reference in letters to
editors, Bin Laden commands little space in most local papers. When
his name comes up, it's usually in connection with the U.S. manhunt
for him and his Al Qaeda associates, with the odd writer or two
reveling in the fact that the Americans, with all their military
might and high-tech smarts, have failed to track him down.</LD>
<TE>   Few, today, are singing Bin Laden's praises. Nonetheless, to the
credit of his image-builders, no one has openly condemned him,
either. To date, not a single Urdu-language publication has called
him a terrorist.</TE>
<TE>   The image of Bin Laden as champion of Muslims is largely the
creation of the Pakistani media, particularly of the Urdu newspapers.
His was a household name in Pakistan long before people in the
West--even informed observers--knew who he was and what he stood for.
With an eye to the future perhaps, Bin Laden had long courted the
Pakistani press by shrewdly playing anti-American, pro-Islamic cards.
As far back as the mid-1990s, journalists from Pakistan were taken on
organized trips to Afghanistan to meet the Saudi dissident.</TE>
<TE>   Urdu-language publications in Pakistan soon started churning out
articles promoting Bin Laden as a devoted jihadi, or holy warrior,
who had chosen rags over riches in pursuit of the "just cause." Here
was a man, the Urdu press fawned, who fought alongside the Afghan
moujahedeen against Soviet occupation in the 1980s and was now
campaigning to rid Saudi Arabia of the U.S. troops based there since
the Persian Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   Washington's failed attempt in 1998 to eliminate Bin Laden by
raining Tomahawks on his camps in Afghanistan proved to be a blessing
in disguise for the Saudi dissident. Hamid Mir, editor of the Urdu
newspaper Ausaf, met Bin Laden several times over the last few years.
According to him, the 1998 attack was a key factor in the elevation
of Bin Laden to heroic status in Muslim societies where
anti-Americanism had taken root.</TE>
<TE>   A cartoon in a Pakistani newspaper aptly captured the rapidly
changing mood toward Bin Laden in Pakistan at the time. The first
half of the cartoon showed a mullah looking at a wall-mounted poster
that read "I love USA." The second half showed him adding two
letters, making it read, "I love USAMA."</TE>
<TE>   Bin Laden's manufactured image in the Pakistani press received a
major boost in the aftermath of Sept. 11, when Washington fixated on
Afghanistan and the Al Qaeda network. As thousands of Islamic
hardliners took to the streets in Pakistan in support of the Taliban
and Bin Laden, coverage in the Urdu-language press made for some
bizarre reading. Glaring contradictions were conveniently ignored.</TE>
<TE>   Although no Urdu newspaper accepted the U.S. line that Bin Laden
was behind the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, he
was still portrayed as the moujahedeen (Islamic warrior) who had
single-handedly taken on the world's only superpower. Several
newspapers devoted weekend editions to furthering Bin Laden's angelic
image, with features on his life and love for Islam and the way he
had sacrificed material pleasures to fulfill his mission.</TE>
<TE>   The hype was soon commercialized in the form of Bin Laden posters
and T-shirts, which were sold, along with Bin Laden books and
pamphlets, at makeshift stalls outside mosques. When Al Jazeera
television started broadcasting his recorded statements, Bin Laden
even gained cachet among Pakistan's Westernized elites, whose many
rich and educated women could be heard discussing his "cool" looks
and "profound" style of speaking, not to mention the "unfair" manner
in which the United States was conducting its war.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Laden's last recorded message, aired by Al Jazeera during the
U.S. bombing of Tora Bora, was joyously received by most Pakistani
newspapers. "I Am Alive" was the headline on the front page of the
Urdu daily Nawa-e-Waqt. The paper, however, ignored the media debate
on just when the videotape was made. During this time, flattering
stories about Bin Laden were usually accompanied by articles highly
critical of the U.S. role in the world, particularly in Islamic
countries. On Dec. 29, for example, two articles on Nawa-e-Waqt's
front page were headlined, "America--the World's Greatest Terrorist
Country" and "American Terrorism in the Light of Glaring Facts."</TE>
<TE>   But a paradigm shift took place with the defeat of the Taliban in
Afghanistan. The Islamist protest movement in Pakistan fizzled out,
and within no time the posters and T-shirts disappeared from markets.
Despite the best efforts of some local newspapers, people lost
interest in discussions about either Bin Laden or his once revered
mission. At most, the debate remained limited to the failure of the
U.S. to find its most-wanted terrorist.</TE>
<TE>   "It's quite understandable," said Mohammed Ramzan, an
Islamabad-based salesman, when asked about the changing attitude to
Bin Laden, that "if we can conveniently forget our own national
heroes over the years, Osama is still an outsider." As for Bin
Laden's message about America's dubious role in Islamic countries,
Ramzan believes it will leave a lasting impression.</TE>
<TE>   To some extent, the change in attitude toward Bin Laden was also
linked to the Pakistani government's crackdown on religious
extremists, which in the last few weeks has become more vigorous. Put
simply, these are not the best of times for Islamic conservatives in
Pakistan. The two-decade-old military-mullah alliance has fallen
apart, and the country's present military ruler, Gen. Pervez
Musharraf, is redefining the country's political ideology. Theocracy
seems to have no place in the new scheme of things. With the mullahs
themselves looking for a breather, little wonder that no one has the
energy or inclination to root for Bin Laden.</TE>

<BD>Neal Gabler, a senior fellow at the Norman Lear Center
at USC Annenberg, is the author of "Life the Movie: How Entertainment
Conquered Reality."</BD>
<DL>AMAGANSETT, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>More than 100 years ago, the "Great Commoner," William Jennings
Bryan, whipped the Democratic National Convention into a frenzy and
changed the party's politics for a generation when he declaimed
against Eastern bankers, "You shall not press down upon the brow of
labor this crown of thorns, you shall not crucify mankind upon a
cross of gold." Less than a decade later, President Theodore
Roosevelt inveighed against trusts that threatened to wrest power
from the people, and three decades after that, President Franklin D.
Roosevelt sneered at "economic royalists." This was the grand
rhetoric of class conflict. How long ago it was.</LD>
<TE>   Despite the sudden erosion of the budget surplus in the face of a
$1.3-trillion tax cut that largely favors the wealthiest Americans,
you don't hear that kind of talk anymore. You are far more likely to
hear dark warnings against invoking the issue of class. When Senate
Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) recently attempted to tie the
current recession to the tax cut, he got little traction in the press
or among the public. Similarly, when Republicans advocated dispensing
huge refunds to some of America's largest corporations to reimburse
them for the minimum corporate tax they had paid, while at the same
time opposing expansion of health benefits to unemployed workers,
there was an astonishing lack of umbrage. Not even the spectacle of
Enron executives enriching themselves while their employees watched
their life savings evaporate seems to have roused middle-class
Americans from their stupor. Whatever happened to good old-fashioned
class-based politics pitting haves against have-nots?</TE>
<TE>   The short answer is that class warfare has been steadily subverted
over the past 20 years by defenders of the status quo: Republicans
have chiefly led the fight, but so have some Democrats, captains of
industry, journalists, religious leaders, radio talk show hosts and
cable television babblers. They have waged this campaign on the
stump, in the media and, most effectively, in the popular culture.
What they have achieved amounts to a psychological revolution in
which Americans not only don't think in terms of class, they don't
even recognize any economic force beyond their own labor. Class
warfare has been destroyed through a kind of national brainwashing.</TE>
<TE>   This certainly isn't the conventional answer for why ordinary
citizens don't seem terribly exercised about seeing money that could
be used to finance schools, build roads or cure disease go instead to
buy another luxury car or yacht for a multi-millionaire. The usual
answer has been that a rising standard of living has neutralized
class consciousness. When it seems that everyone has a house, two
cars, three television sets and a closetful of designer clothes, no
one really begrudges the rich for having more. Trickle-down may or
may not be valid as an economic policy, but it has proved to be a
great psychological policy. So long as people feel better off than
they were, they apparently are in no mood to grumble over why they
don't have more of America's spoils.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is, the standard of living for the vast majority of
Americans hasn't risen all that dramatically over the last 20 years.
According to a recent Congressional Budget Office study, income for
middle-class families, adjusted for inflation, rose from $41,400 in
1979 to $45,100 in 1997, or just 9%. In other words, the average
American is only slightly better off now than he was then, despite
unprecedented economic growth during this period.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, one might understand the general reluctance to play the
class card if all Americans were in the same boat. But they aren't.
While the average American's income increased by 9%, that of the
wealthiest 1% rose 140% during the same period. Put another way, the
wealthiest now have 23 times more than the annual income of the
average American, up from 10 times more in 1979. Economic growth has
been a kind of zero-sum game, and the gap between the middle
class--no one even bothers to consider the poor--and the rich is
getting bigger and bigger. It is a state of affairs that should have
made Americans more class conscious, not less.</TE>
<TE>   There are more satisfying explanations for the end of class
warfare. For one, the United States is basically a conservative
country in which class antagonisms have always been more the
exception than the rule and in which practitioners of class warfare
have been routinely branded "socialistic" or "foreign." Bryan, after
all, lost three presidential elections to conservative opponents, and
FDR, whose platform was hardly rabble-rousing, was elected only after
President Herbert Hoover fiddled while America burned.</TE>
<TE>   Another explanation is that sectional, cultural or racial disputes
siphon off energy that might otherwise feed class conflict. One of
the great political achievements of conservatives over the last 30
years or so has been to tie social welfare to race rather than class.
As a result, poor and middle-class white Americans tend to neglect
their own interests in the belief that policies of equalization and
fairness are designed chiefly to aid minorities.</TE>
<TE>   There have also been changes in the economy that have sapped class
consciousness and thus class warfare. The decline of the trade-union
movement and the rise of white-collar and service jobs as a
proportion of the workforce have blunted the sense of a working class
with a distinct set of interests. More recently, the infusion of
ordinary Americans into the stock market has blurred the line between
labor and capital--between those who work and those who own--and has
consequently changed allegiances.</TE>
<TE>   But while these factors taken together provide a partial
explanation of why Americans don't engage in class warfare anymore,
they don't really explain why we dare not mention class disparities
in U.S. politics today. For that, you have to go back to the campaign
against class, a campaign that should rank among the most significant
political developments of the last quarter century but has been
little remarked upon.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation of this campaign is the American Dream, which is
one reason why populists have found it virtually impossible to
combat. The dream proposes that anyone in America can succeed by dint
of hard work. The opportunities are there; we simply have to seize
them. Thus, to talk in terms of class is, in a sense, to betray the
dream--the vital source of optimism in the nation. It is un-American.</TE>
<TE>   The corollary to our faith in social mobility has been a kind of
American Calvinism that has served the wealthy well. As Chauncey
Depew, a 19th-century apologist for untrammeled wealth, once put it,
the rich had become rich because they possessed "superior ability,
foresight, and adaptability." They deserved their wealth. This has
been the social gospel of American conservatism, and it was
essentially George W. Bush's pitch last year when he defended his
huge tax breaks: The rich deserve tax cuts because they pay more
taxes, and they pay more taxes because they have earned more. Without
coming right out and saying so, he was, like Depew, telling us, in
effect, that the rich were better than the rest of us: smarter,
tougher, harder working.</TE>
<TE>   The American Dream and its Calvinist corollary have existed since
the nation's beginning, and they didn't entirely foreclose class
warfare. Even as they endorsed the dream, populists argued that
mobility was predicated on opportunity, and that the system was
rigged by the plutocrats to deny the common man the means to the good
life so that plutocrats themselves could have more. As much as
anything, populism aimed to provide opportunities to make the
American Dream a reality for everyone. To the extent that class
warfare ever existed in this country, that was its rationale: not to
divide the pie evenly but to assure that everyone got invited to
dinner.</TE>
<TE>   If Americans believed there was systemic inequality, there could
be class warfare. What Reaganism did--and this may have been its
signal accomplishment--was convince the average American that equal
opportunity already existed, and that anyone who didn't succeed had
only himself to blame, not the inequities of the system. This was the
grand psychological transformation, and though it played on
Americans' predisposition both to credit and to reprove themselves
for their own situation, it succeeded largely by steadily redirecting
attention from the macro to the micro, from economics to anecdote.
While the macro story was that wealth was being massively
redistributed from the middle class to the upper class, the micro
story that Ronald Reagan and other conservatives--and even many
liberals, for that matter--kept pushing incessantly was that of the
small, intrepid entrepreneur who made a million dollars out of some
invention or brainstorm. There were literally thousands of these
stories--Reagan loved to tell the one about the fellow who reaped a
fortune by inventing a beer-can holder--and they had the advantage of
being media-friendly. What they suggested was that America had
reached the point at which you either decided to make a fortune or
you didn't, with the promise that your own windfall might be just
around the corner. This was the new economic myth that trumped
economic truth.</TE>
<TE>   But it wasn't only politicians and conservative pundits who
promoted the idea that class was earned not ascribed. Dozens of
movies, from "Rocky" to "Good Will Hunting" to "Ocean's Eleven" have
pushed it. Advertisements have pushed it by showing the ready
availability of material goods. How-to bestsellers have pushed it by
advising how easily one can accumulate wealth. The lore of Ralph
Lauren, Martha Stewart, Oprah Winfrey, Emeril Lagasse--of anyone who,
Alger-like, had risen from poverty to prominence--have pushed it. You
can't avoid it.</TE>
<TE>   It remains a potent idea, because people want to believe
it--certainly more than they want to believe that the U.S. economy
distributes its rewards unfairly. As Ronald Reagan no doubt realized,
it is also a lot easier to identify with a rich entrepreneur than to
understand the welter of statistics that show the more frightening
face of the economy. At the same time, having convinced people that
wealth is a function of brains and gumption, rather than of
inheritance or influence, conservatives effectively removed the rich
as a target of class warfare and replaced them with another target of
ideological warfare: government. By this new reasoning, when the
government claimed that it wanted to redress the inequities of the
economy, it was really just angling to take more money from its
citizens. Government, the only instrumentality that could possibly
remedy unfairness, was a lot easier to hate than a guy who invented a
beer-can holder or even a guy who invented a computer operating
system and became a billionaire.</TE>
<TE>   After 20 years of inspirational tales of wealth, and as many years
of government-bashing, this is where we find ourselves now. Most of
us believe fervently in the American Dream. Most of us believe that
the rich are deserving and that, with a few breaks, we might get
ours, too. Most of us believe that taxes are some kind of
confiscatory scheme rather than a tool for correcting an imbalance.
And most of us believe that to think in terms of class under these
circumstances is to deny the ideal of individual responsibility that
is the very basis of America. That's why the rich will keep getting
richer, the middle class will keep losing ground, the poor will keep
getting ignored, and no one will say a single word about it.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In Los Angeles, things that were very now then tend to be very then
now.</LD>
<LD>   It seems only yesterday--not nearly 16 years of yesterdays--since
I first stood in the forecourt of LACMA's new Robert O. Anderson
Building and experienced what was then touted as the strength, the
sheer boldness, of Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer's neo-Deco glass-block and
green-tile spectacle, and what were called its venturesome harmonies,
both of the exterior, with its 1920-30s architectural blend of
Miracle Mile, and of the interior, with its unloved 1960s William L.
Pereira museum galleries. "To greet this grand event with anything
short of slightly woozy enthusiasm would be off the mark," Times
critic William Wilson ululated.</LD>
<TE>   Now, in less than the age of the average Britney Spears fan, that
entire assessment has been obliterated because the board of the Los
Angeles County Museum of Art went unanimously berserk and voted to
tear down most of what remains--in the eyes of most of the world, a
pretty-darned-near-brand-new museum. All to make room for the
brainchild of that Britney Spears (or is it the Ani DiFranco?) of
modern architecture, Rem Koolhaas. The list price for his revision,
which is simply going to keep the rain off--not change the rather
mixed worth of the museum's present collection--is $200 million.
Wait! Board chairman Walter L. Weisman says it might come to $300
million--which means, bet on at least $400 million. But for the sake
of argument, let's call it $300 million. No wonder a few strained
voices gasped that this is a lot of money for a new roof over the
same familiar artifacts. Even if, as a Koolhaas roof, it's the
trendiest roof in the world, hovering over three new levels of
galleries, eateries, offices and work space.</TE>
<TE>   At the risk of being blasphemous, maybe there are better places to
put one-third of a billion donated cultural dollars than a new house
for an old art museum.</TE>
<TE>   Modernization by Metalith was the rage in this city. Just look at
the Staples Center, Walt Disney Concert Hall and the Cathedral of Our
Lady of the Angels. The idea was that if you drop a huge fortune into
a large, pretentious public building, our cultural, business and
social environments must correspondingly improve. More recently,
though, there breathed another idea--what some rashly called a new
maturity--bidding for appreciation and renewal of past architectural
resources, particularly in the city's downtown. This urban whimsy
couldn't help but sound vaguely Un-Angeleno, and the new LACMA
redesign plan puts it righteously behind us. Older buildings--even if
they're younger than our schoolchildren--once again are categorically
inadequate, ugly or morally deficient. The work of the architect of
that moment must fall before the vision of the man of this instant.
But even accepting that, might not there be more directly beneficial
ways to nurture our straightened local culture with such a flood of
money?</TE>
<TE>   Doug Stone, a spokesman for California public schools Supt.
Delaine Easton, notes that just $200 million, notwithstanding the
Belmont Learning Complex fiasco, could buy around 40 new schools for
the Los Angeles Unified School District. Of course, those who
distrust the LAUSD might argue that, compared with the garish splash
of a new museum, solving L.A.'sschool-expansion crisis for the next
30 years would be a wretched waste of money.</TE>
<TE>   But what if this so-far imaginary bequest were concentrated on
cultural education, on creating new generations of Angeleno creative
artists and art lovers? On, if you will, museum-content providers.
Ninety-one-million dollars would provide a music, arts, theater and
dance teacher at every school in the district, according to Stone.
Another $44 million would provide at least one arts textbook for
every one of the district's 750,000 students, as well as improved
classrooms, more arts supplies and "professional development for
teachers." This gets us to just $135 million, well under half of
Weisman's $300-million estimate for the Koolhaas roof. That $135
million also leaves, according to the board's own estimate, more than
enough of the overall proposed sum needed to rehabilitate and expand
the entire extant county museum.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the goal of the spending, you have to consider who it's
coming from; that is, the objectives of the donors. It appears that
certain high-rollers backing the Koolhaas proposal, seeking
posthumous homes for their own collections, are willing to dig deep
into their pockets for the new facility. But the more rank-and-file
prospective donors, who would contribute the bulk of the cost, might
do well to contemplate the the 1986 walls of LACMA's Times Mirror
Court, which bear the names of thousands of individual and corporate
givers who endowed the tentatively doomed Anderson building.</TE>
<TE>   One might well want a more enduring memorial. So, what about
endowing arts education, which has suffered enormously since the 1978
passage of Proposition 13? LAUSD spokeswoman Stephanie Brady notes
that the district is now planning its first high-school arts campus
on the site of the current administrative center at 450 N. Grand Ave.
"We're in year three of a 10-year recovery in arts funding," Brady
says. The new plant is expected to cost $30 million. Staffing will
cost millions more.</TE>
<TE>   Carl Selkin, dean of the School of Arts and Letters at California
State University, Los Angeles, suggests that such public schools and
other arts programs could be supported--and influenced by--a
nonprofit endowment institution. "What New York City did was to set
up a private, nonprofit educational foundation [that] support[s] the
arts in its schools." This in addition to that city's own,
long-established dedicated campuses--such as the High School for the
Performing Arts and the High School of Music and Arts--that graduate
thousands each year.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles, on the other hand, has long prided itself for its own
wealth of musicians and modern artists, while treating this affluence
of talent as a fortunate accident. Selkin says, "We must build an
infrastructure for the arts on the educational level. The proven
basic benefits include better school attendance and more student
involvement. And, in the end, you not only have far more artists
throughout this diverse community, you also have an expanded
community that appreciates and supports the arts. After all, tourism
alone can't sustain an artistic community."</TE>
<TE>   Neither, come to think of it, can museums.</TE>

<AU>SELIG S. HARRISON</AU>
<BD>Selig S. Harrison has reported on South Asia since 1951
and written five books on the region. He is director of the National
Security Project at the Center for International Policy and a senior
scholar of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>"If Pakistan is an ally of the United States of America ... good luck
to the United States of America."</LD>
<LD>   When Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh made this caustic
remark to an American journalist recently, he was sending multiple
messages to Washington. The most obvious one was that Pakistan
remains a hotbed of Islamic extremists, despite President Pervez
Musharraf's promised crackdown, and cannot be trusted. But at a
deeper level, his words also serve as a powerful reminder that Indian
anger over Pakistani provocations in Kashmir is directed not only at
Islamabad, but also at the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Behind the polite diplomatic exchanges now taking place between
New Delhi and Washington lies the Indian belief that America's
unconditional embrace of Musharraf since Sept. 11 has emboldened
Pakistani hawks to step up their pressure in Kashmir. More broadly,
in this view, U.S. military aid to Pakistan (some $7.3 billion over
the past five decades) has encouraged Pakistan to twist India's tail,
and there is no sign yet that Washington is ready for a showdown with
Musharraf if he fails to stop cross-border terrorism in Kashmir.</LD>
<TE>   If the United States wants to restrain Indian hawks and help
prevent another India-Pakistan war, the Bush administration should
send a threefold message back to New Delhi: first, that it regards
India, some seven times bigger than Pakistan, as the focus of U.S.
interests in South Asia; second, that it will gradually phase out
U.S. military cooperation with Islamabad now that the need for it is
declining; and finally, that it will make economic aid to Musharraf
conditional on an end to Pakistani army support for Islamic militants
infiltrating Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   Until Sept. 11, the White House was moving toward a long-overdue
reversal of Cold War policies, in which Washington either tilted
toward Islamabad or, at best, treated India on a par with
Pakistan--notwithstanding its superior size and its growing
importance to the United States as a counterweight to China in the
Asian balance of power.</TE>
<TE>   Since the World Trade Center and Pentagon tragedies, in the hopes
of getting military and intelligence cooperation in Afghanistan, the
United States has lionized Musharraf, showering him with a cornucopia
of economic aid--no strings attached--that has so far included $600
million in immediate cash infusions, $2.1 billion in projected grants
and credits, $1.5 billion in International Monetary Fund credits
(which had previously been blocked by the United States because
Pakistan had not met IMF criteria) and a rescheduling of $12.2
billion in Pakistan's debt to a U.S.-led consortium of aid donors
(including $3.75 billion owed directly to the United States). This
aid was possible only after sanctions imposed on Pakistan after its
1998 nuclear test were lifted in the wake of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   With budgetary sleight of hand, much of this economic aid can be
used to subsidize military spending. More important, Pentagon
statements increasingly envisage the establishment of permanent U.S.
military bases in Pakistan, closer Pakistani ties with the U.S.
Central Command, the supplying of spare parts and components for U.S.
weapons already in Pakistani hands and a possible resumption of
grants and sales of military hardware.</TE>
<TE>   To balance out its growing ties with Islamabad, the United States
is offering to sell sophisticated defense equipment to New Delhi.
Since India wants to get as much as it can while the getting is good,
New Delhi is not making a public fuss, for the moment, over the U.S.
embrace of Pakistan. If a U.S. military role there temporarily serves
Indian interests, New Delhi will swallow it. But the test in Indian
eyes will be whether Musharraf's crackdown on Islamic extremists
extends to Kashmir, and whether it will last or is merely a tactical
gambit.</TE>
<TE>   New trouble in Kashmir would quickly bring to the surface
sublimated Indian anxieties over a long-term U.S. military role in
Pakistan. In any case, Musharraf has strongly advised against such a
role, warning that Pakistani anger over U.S. policy in the Middle
East would make U.S. forces a divisive issue. To the extent that a
continuing U.S. military role is needed in Afghanistan to back up
peacekeeping forces, it can be adequately supported by the new U.S.
military base now being established in Kandahar.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon spin that the U.S. military role in Pakistan relates
only to the "war on terrorism" rekindles Indian memories of earlier
reassurances by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1954 that the
program of "limited" weapons aid to Pakistan then unfolding was
solely for use against communist aggression. By 1965, the United
States had provided $3.8 billion in military hardware to Pakistan.
This led the military dictator then ruling in Islamabad, Gen. Ayub
Khan, to launch cross-border raids in Kashmir that triggered a
broader war, in which Pakistan, predictably, relied primarily on its
U.S. planes and tanks.</TE>
<TE>   Just when India had begun to forgive and forget, the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan prompted the U.S. to supply Pakistan with
$3.5 billion in new weapons aid as a reward for serving as a
"front-line state." The nature of this aid package, with its F-16
aircraft and its heavy tanks, made clear that it was not intended for
use on the mountainous Afghan border but rather to bolster Pakistan's
balance of power in open-plains warfare with India. Additional U.S.
weapons were sent through Pakistan to the Afghan resistance forces.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to 1954, the United States did not even pretend in
1982 that its aid could be used only against the Soviet Union. In a
controversial speech on Oct. 10, 1984, U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan
Deane Hinton said that the 1959 U.S. mutual security treaty with
Islamabad left the door open for the United States to support
Pakistan in a war with India. Lawrence S. Eagleburger, who was
Undersecretary of State at the time, told me later that the United
States wanted to establish a "balance" between India and its smaller
neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   Against this background, India's current brinkmanship becomes more
understandable. New Delhi is not likely to pull back from the brink
unless the United States can get Musharraf to take meaningful steps
toward peace.</TE>
<TE>   The most important immediate step would be to stop infiltration by
Pakistani and Kashmiri Islamic militants into the India-controlled
Kashmir Valley. Pakistan's army would have to stop providing the
diversionary covering fire and logistical support that makes this
infiltration possible.</TE>
<TE>   Indian Interior Minister Lal Krishna Advani told a recent
off-the-record meeting in Washington that the cease-fire line should
be "adjusted" in key places where the terrain makes infiltration
easy. If Musharraf means business, he would agree to negotiations on
such changes. In return, New Delhi would not only have to withdraw
the forward deployments ordered after the Dec. 13 attack on the
Indian Parliament building but, equally important, negotiate with
insurgent groups on greater autonomy for Kashmir within India.</TE>
<TE>   Such negotiations would require Pakistani support for a cease-fire
between the Indian army and Kashmiri insurgents like the one proposed
in July 2000 by Hizbul Moujahedeen. Hizbul consists solely of
Kashmiris, not Pakistanis, and was sensitive to the mood of
war-weariness in the valley. But the group receives Pakistani weapons
aid, and when Islamabad objected to the proposal, Hizbul withdrew its
cease-fire offer.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its denials, Pakistan controls most Kashmiri insurgent
groups. On May 29, 1999, shortly after the Pakistani army launched
its offensive across the cease-fire line at Kargil, Indian
intelligence intercepted a revealing international telephone
conversation between then-Gen. Musharraf, who was in Beijing, and his
deputy, Lt. Gen. Mohammed Aziz. CIA sources have validated the
authenticity of the intercept. Nawaz Sharif, then prime-minister, had
expressed concern, Aziz said, that Kashmiri insurgent groups fighting
with the army might get out of hand and force an escalation, but that
"there need be no such fear, since we have them by the scruff of the
neck and whenever desired, we can regulate the situation."</TE>

<HD>CIA's New Celebrity Exposes Its Failings</HD>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>After a decade of relative anonymity, the CIA has suddenly been
thrust back into the spotlight. But can it stand the glare?</LD>
<LD>   When CIA agent Johnny "Mike" Spann was killed during the
Mazar-i-Sharif prison uprising last November, CIA Director George J.
Tenet seized upon his death to trumpet the CIA's key role in the war
effort. Already the agency has played a prominent role in
Afghanistan, where its agents have been helping the military to
identify targets. And in the end, nothing can be more central to the
war on terrorism than reliable intelligence that can detect and
destroy terrorist cells before they strike against the U.S. or its
allies.</LD>
<LD>   But even as the CIA touts its deeds, veteran CIA-watchers are
skeptical. Intelligence experts, along with a growing number of
former CIA operatives, point out that the agency was caught flat
footed by Sept. 11 and is using the war on terrorism as an excuse to
evade scrutiny. Ultimately, though, unless the CIA examines what went
wrong in its past, it will not be able to avoid disasters in the
future. The successful terrorist attacks revealed the agency's
weaknesses: Now it's time for reinvention.</LD>
<TE>   A common perception is that the CIA had a golden age during the
Cold War and now simply needs to return to its roots. But a look at
the history of the CIA suggests that it was never particularly
effective. The CIA grew out of the World War II Office of Strategic
Services, which was run by Gen. William "Wild Bill" Donovan. A Wall
Street lawyer, Donovan hand picked Ivy League graduates and Wall
Street figures to form an East Coast intelligence elite. Donovan
infused the group--which included future CIA directors Allen Dulles,
Richard Helms and William J. Casey--with a daredevil spirit of action
behind enemy lines.</TE>
<TE>   During the first half of the Cold War, the CIA continued in that
tradition, focusing on covert action abroad. Heeding George F.
Kennan's call to "fight fire with fire," the CIA recruited numerous
former Nazis, Ukrainian collaborators and other freebooters to carry
out paramilitary actions in Eastern Europe. Most of the agency's
planned actions failed, and many, including President Harry S.
Truman, expressed concern that the CIA had failed to get advance
information about even such large-scale actions as the 1948
Soviet-backed communist coup in Prague or the North Korean invasion
of South Korea in 1950.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA was undeterred. Under Allen Dulles' direction, the
organization focused on increasingly suspect actions, like installing
the Shah of Iran in power in 1953 and toppling the Guatemalan
government in 1954 to protect the United Fruit Co. Not until the Bay
of Pigs operation to oust Fidel Castro in Cuba was Dulles sacked for
his shenanigans, and then only because he had failed. During the
1960s, the CIA tried repeatedly to assassinate Castro. It plotted to
kill Congolese Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba in 1960. And in
Vietnam, the agency's Phoenix program was responsible for brutal
actions against suspected Viet Cong in South Vietnamese hamlets.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1975-76 hearings held by Idaho Democrat Sen. Frank
Church's Select Committee on Intelligence, the CIA's darkest secrets
were disclosed to an incredulous nation. Reforms grew out of the
hearings, including a ban on the CIA's involvement in assassinations
and domestic spying. Jimmy Carter's CIA chief, Adm. Stansfield
Turner, went further. He sacked many covert action analysts and
turned to an emphasis on using what is known as national-technical
means of verification. In other words, the CIA shifted to greater
reliance on high-tech gadgets and analysis, devoting fewer resources
to cultivating sources and on-the-ground observations. But while the
reforms may have eliminated some of the agency's most flagrant
abuses, they did little to improve its performance.</TE>
<TE>   On the eve of the collapse of the Eastern Bloc, the CIA was
producing documents stating that East German industrial production
exceeded West Germany's. Nor did the CIA have any inkling that the
Soviet Union was about to collapse. The West was about to achieve the
ultimate victory, but the CIA--created to help achieve that
victory--was AWOL. Matters did not improve in the 1990s. Under the
Clinton administration's CIA Director John M. Deutch, an MIT
academic, the emphasis on satellites and listening devices only
increased. Almost nothing was done to cultivate human intelligence
sources.</TE>
<TE>   No one would argue that the CIA should stop relying on technology.
But it desperately needs to refocus its energies on understanding
foreign cultures and languages. The red thread that runs through the
CIA's failures is an American arrogance of power that assumes
military power and technological wizardry alone can reshape the world
in our image. The truth is that the CIA has never paid much attention
to the environment in which it was operating. According to Thomas
Powers, who has written extensively about the CIA, it had no agent
inside the government in Hanoi, nor did it ever have a spy in the
North Korean government. It has never had a high-level spy in the
Saudi Arabian government. But, even more than penetrating
governments, the CIA needs to do painstaking, on-the-ground
intelligence work. Reuel Marc Gerecht, a former CIA operative, wrote
last year in the Atlantic magazine that the CIA has done next to
nothing to penetrate the Arab world on the ground. Instead, officers
remain cooped up in embassies and are ignorant of local languages.
The Bush administration will be hard pressed to make the necessary
changes, given that the current president's father helped shape the
agency that exists today.</TE>
<TE>   But the danger is that the CIA will continue to use the war on
terrorism to head off calls for any real reform. The worst possible
lesson that the CIA could take from Afghanistan is that it needs to
focus again on covert military action. If the CIA is to combat
terrorism, it needs to break with its past.</TE>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>As the Washington press has occupied itself looking for conflicts of
interest in the Enron scandal, another possible ethical issue--this
one involving Environmental Protection Agency head Christine Todd
Whitman--has gone largely unnoticed.</LD>
<LD>   EPA national ombudsman Robert J. Martin has accused Whitman of
trying to muzzle him at the very time he is challenging an EPA
agreement beneficial to a primary backer of Whitman's husband's
venture capital firm. Congress is likely to hold hearings on the
controversy in the coming weeks.</LD>
<LD>   In a Jan. 10 lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District
of Columbia, Martin, the EPA's public interest advocate, complained
that Whitman reassigned him in an attempt to eliminate his
independence within the agency. Martin alleges that Whitman's action
stems from his opposition to a pending agreement regarding a
Superfund site in Denver. The site is owned by Citigroup, which in
1995 spun off and today remains a principal investor in John
Whitman's company, Sycamore Ventures. Citigroup was also John
Whitman's employer from 1972 to 1987, and he and his wife own as much
as $250,000 in Citigroup stock.</LD>
<TE>   The agreement between the EPA and Citigroup--which was reached
before Whitman arrived at the agency--would limit the financial
titan's liability for cleaning up the Shattuck Chemical Co. Superfund
site to $7.2 million. EPA scientists have estimated the full price at
$22 to $35 million. Martin has separately concluded that a proper
cleanup of the Shattuck site, which contains a 15-foot mound of
radioactive soil and is located within blocks of homes and parks and
within range of the local drinking supply, would cost as much as $100
million. Limiting Citigroup's liability to $7.2 million could
therefore transfer up to $93 million of the cleanup's cost to
taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   The position of ombudsman was created in 1984 to help mediate
community concerns over Superfund sites. The ombudsman does not have
decision-making authority but acts as a kind of complaints
department--investigating issues raised by citizens, local
governments or companies dissatisfied with the EPA bureaucracy and,
when appropriate, advocating alternatives. In the Shattuck case,
Martin wanted to hold public hearings on the cleanup agreement and
testify before the federal judge who must approve or reject it. He
was prohibited from traveling to Denver by Gary Johnson, the EPA's
assistant inspector general, who would become his boss under the
reassignment proposed by Whitman.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers on Capitol Hill, including Republican Sens. Wayne Allard
of Colorado and Michael D. Crapo and Larry E. Craig of Idaho, oppose
the reassignment, fearing for Martin's independence. The senators,
along with a bipartisan group in the House of Representatives, urged
Whitman to delay the move until congressional hearings could be held.
Instead, she tried to transfer Martin over the Christmas recess.</TE>
<TE>   Now the reassignment has been delayed. U.S. District Judge Richard
W. Roberts has issued a temporary restraining order in response to
Martin's lawsuit that keeps the ombudsman in his job until Feb. 26
(when a fuller hearing will take place). The additional time gives
Senate and House members an opportunity to hold hearings, where
Whitman will no doubt be asked to explain her actions.</TE>
<TE>   EPA spokesman Joe Martyak denies any wrongdoing: "The conflict of
interest being proposed here simply doesn't exist, because she's been
up front about what her involvement is with Citigroup." The terms of
the EPA-Citigroup deal were first reached in December 2000, before
Whitman even took office, says Martyak, and her reassignment of the
ombudsman is a "totally separate decision" that will actually give
him greater independence.</TE>
<TE>   "I would add that she set a very high standard for ethical
responsibility in the state of New Jersey," says Martyak. "The way
she ran her administration there is just the way she's doing things
here at the EPA."</TE>
<TE>   But that is hardly reassuring. As New Jersey's governor, Whitman
abolished the environmental prosecutor's office as well as the public
advocate's office. She slashed enforcement budgets in favor of
corporate "self-audits," a voluntary approach that lets companies
grade their own performance. It was all in the name of declaring New
Jersey "open for business," as a Whitman slogan put it.</TE>
<TE>   One firm that benefited from that business-friendly climate was
Mail.com, an Internet company in which John Whitman held a 10% stake
and on whose board of directors he served. Mail.com won a $1.6
million grant from the New Jersey Commerce and Economic Growth
Commission in November 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Whitman denied having done anything unethical, noting that in
the current era of two-career households, such situations were not
uncommon. She did, however acknowledge that the situation "certainly
raises an issue that I think we're going to have to come to grips
with."</TE>
<TE>   Whitman's recent actions suggest she still hasn't "come to grips"
with the issue, that she has failed to grasp a crucial concept for
public officials: It's not just the conflict of interest that matters
but the appearance of a conflict.</TE>
<TE>   We can't know if Whitman's reassignment of the ombudsman was
intended to remove him from the Shattuck case. But the timing is
striking: She is muzzling Martin at the moment his actions could
interrupt a settlement extremely favorable to Citigroup. The
ombudsman has produced no evidence that Whitman intervened in order
to benefit the corporation. But the appearance of a conflict should
prompt her to stay at arm's length from anything having to do with
the settlement--including reassigning the deal's chief critic.</TE>
<TE>   Which points to the broader issues raised by Whitman's case. Like
top officials in all three branches of government, Whitman is a very
wealthy person with financial interests in a range of fields affected
by government actions. Unless we want to bar such persons from
government service outright, the nation must devise more meaningful
protections for the public interest.</TE>
<TE>   The federal Office of Government Ethics currently stipulates a
two-step process: an official must declare his or her financial
interests and shun "substantial participation" in decisions affecting
them. Whitman has listed her interests, and her spokesman attests
that she has also avoided participation in forbidden matters. But she
should go further.</TE>
<TE>   An official at the Office of Government Ethics points out that a
Cabinet secretary who wishes to go beyond the minimum standard can
issue a formal recusal letter, directing staff to isolate the
secretary from issues of personal financial sensitivity. Even better,
said the official, is for a secretary to put all financial holdings
into a blind trust, as Vice President Dick Cheney and Treasury
Secretary Paul H. O'Neill have done. Whitman has done neither of
these things.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, how Whitman conducts herself over the next month will
help decide whether the Bush administration, already having to
distance itself from the Enron scandal, will face a second
conflict-of-interest scandal. And both controversies illuminate a
larger question: Is ours a government of, by and for the people? Or
of, by and for the corporations?</TE>

<KH>RETIREMENT SAVINGS</KH>
<HD>401(k) Plans Need a Major Overhaul</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES H. SMALHOUT</AU>
<BD>James H. Smalhout is the author of "The Uncertain
Retirement" and a visiting fellow at the Hudson Institute.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Chalk it up to confusion. Enron employees at the bottom of the
corporate totem pole can be forgiven for being gullible enough to buy
piles of company stock for their 401(k) savings accounts. They, along
with many outside investors, were misled. But now comes word that
Kenneth L. Lay, the company's former chairman and CEO, also may have
been taken in: He apparently was buying Enron stock as recently as
August. The firm went bankrupt in December.</LD>
<LD>   That most inside the company were putting too many eggs in Enron's
basket isn't surprising. Studies show that workers invest, on
average, approximately one-third of their 401(k) pension savings in
the company that employs them and sometimes quite a bit more. UCLA
economist Shlomo Bernartzi, for example, has found that plans like
Enron's, which match some portion of worker contributions with
employer stock, tend to hold about 48% in the company's shares.</LD>
<LD>   In case anybody forgot, Yale University's James Tobin won a Nobel
Prize in 1981 for confirming one of the greatest investment
principles of all time: People need to spread their savings over a
broad market portfolio. Those who don't much care for the rough and
tumble on Wall Street should not invest in fewer stocks, Tobin
argued. They should put less money into their broadly diversified
portfolio and more into completely safe investments like U.S.
Treasury bonds.</LD>
<TE>   So, why don't folks diversify enough? Investors find it reassuring
to put their money into familiar companies, and the firm that's most
familiar of all is their employer. Bernartzi's research shows that
workers take it as a cue that employer stock represents a good
investment when the company contributes shares to their plans.
Nothing could be further from the truth in far too many cases. Buying
employer stock also can become a loyalty test, if workers think that
they can impress the boss or somehow avoid trouble by owning a piece
of the company.</TE>
<TE>   The view from Washington has been equally murky. Officials never
have been able to bring themselves to treat 401(k)s as retirement
plans. The government, instead, likes to think of them as
profit-sharing plans. Yet, 401(k)s have become the primary retirement
vehicle for almost 17 million people and, together with similar
arrangements, now cover about twice as many active workers as
traditional retirement plans that pay a monthly pension based on
earnings and length of service to a single employer. The newer
defined-contribution plans--401(k)s and others like them--also have
more assets.</TE>
<TE>   It all began when the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
(ERISA) first allowed companies to set up 401(k)s in 1974. That law
also revamped traditionally defined benefit pension plans after a
string of bankruptcies left many workers in those plans high and dry.
ERISA placed a 10% cap on "party-in-interest investments"--employer
stock and other securities issued by the company or its
affiliates--that traditional plans could hold.</TE>
<TE>   The rules now say that employers can't force their workers to hold
more than 10% of their 401(k) money in company stock. But the sky is
the limit on how much company stock workers "voluntarily" can put
into their 401(k)s. Most companies, including Enron, bar sales of the
stock they use to match worker contributions, at least until the
worker reaches the age of 50.</TE>
<TE>   Washington has seen this movie before. A string of scandals over
the years led to repeated calls to cap employer stock in 401(k)s.
Alarm bells went off after workers took big hits at companies like
Rite Aid, Morrison Knudsen Corp., Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp.,
Color Tile Inc., McKesson Corp., Ikon Office Solutions Inc. and, more
recently, at Lucent Technologies Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Companies may want to give their workers a piece of the action for
understandable reasons. Holding company stock, after all, could make
them better employees. But a primary pension plan is not the right
place for that. Congress gives up lots of tax revenue to encourage
companies to offer 401(k)s. If the purpose has become to provide
workers with a financially secure retirement, officials need to face
that fact, and higher standards of safety should apply.</TE>
<TE>   There's a deeper problem. America's financial markets are reputed
to be unmatched in their ability to channel capital to its most
productive uses. The rest of the world is voting with its pocketbook.
Trillions in foreign capital has been flowing to our shores for more
than a generation, and many countries are trying to imitate the
U.S.-market model.</TE>
<TE>   But the Enron fiasco, in part, directly threatens that incredibly
successful system. Holding vast amounts of company stock in private
pension plans traps that capital inside one firm. So, a big portion
of America's retirement savings can't flow to the best investment
opportunities available. That's what Enron's 401(k) and all
party-in-interest investments are really about: blocking the natural
flow of capital to its most productive uses. This and less extreme
examples not only can rob workers of a decent retirement, they also
can shortchange the rest of us. Our economy could produce lots of
extra things if more of America's retirement savings were unleashed
on truly promising new investments.</TE>
<TE>   Several European countries have relied on systems that pour
workers' retirement money into party-in-interest investments.
Germany, Sweden and Finland are among them, and they have paid a
price. Their stock markets--relative to the size of their
economies--are puny compared with ours. These countries now are
recognizing the error of their ways and recently set out to repair
the damage with tax changes and other reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Here at home, Washington has its work cut out for it.
Party-in-interest investments are also conflict-of-interest
investments: a license for companies to misdirect and even squander
whatever retirement money goes into them. The proposals under
consideration in Congress don't look so good against this backdrop.
Sens. Jon Corzine (D-N.J.) and Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) want to cap
employer stock in 401(k)s at 20%. Reps. Peter Deutsch (D-Fla.) and
Gene Green (D-Texas) would hold the limit to 10%. And the Bush
administration faces an unhappy choice between its justified
preference for the marketplace and its many friends in the business
community who, oddly enough, fiercely oppose change in this area.</TE>
<TE>   The Enron debacle has obscured some basic truths about today's
401(k)s. They can deliver modern pensions that travel well and retain
their value when workers move from job to job. And they also let
workers choose the level of investment risk in keeping with their
needs. But 401(k)s come with one tragic flaw and Washington doesn't
seem to have a clue about how to fix it. This is no time for more
confusion.</TE>

<HD>Will Rogers Didn't Leave His Park to Horses</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RUSTY AREIAS</AU>
<BD>Rusty Areias is director of the California state parks
department.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California is blessed with 267 state parks, highlighting the diverse
natural and cultural wonders of our state. Nowhere is this truer than
at Will Rogers State Historic Park in Pacific Palisades. Created as a
tribute to the popular American humorist, who established the ranch
in the 1920s, the park today attracts visitors from throughout the
nation while providing a quiet getaway for Southern Californians.</LD>
<LD>   The state parks department has operated the site for more than 50
years. Now, we are developing a new operating plan for it aimed at
doing a better job of highlighting Will Rogers' life. Millions of
dollars have been earmarked for renovation of historic structures,
particularly the main ranch house. We hope to reestablish some of the
vegetation as it was when Rogers and his family made their home
there.</LD>
<LD>   Our work is not without controversy. Over the years, the park has
allowed a horse boarding facility to be run on the property. At last
count, 45 privately owned horses were boarded at this public park. It
is this aspect of the park, and my department's efforts to change it,
that is causing quite a little fuss, as Rogers might have put it.</LD>
<TE>   I have ordered the temporary suspension of private horse boarding.
This follows years of problems arising from horses living permanently
at the park, including damage to historic buildings, compaction of
soil in corralled areas, erosion and pollution of the creek.</TE>
<TE>   Will Rogers' grandson has been critical of the state parks
department for providing this private benefit at a public park,
deeded by his family to the state in 1944. The boarding facility has
never supported itself financially and has caused an unreasonable
workload for park staff.</TE>
<TE>   This suspension will give us time to ascertain damage caused by
the horses to structures and vegetation and to measure pollution to
nearby streams caused by horse manure. We also want to determine if
boarding is compatible with park operations and, if it is, how many
horses should be allowed.</TE>
<TE>   A few of the people who are boarding their horses at the park say
the state has no right to make such a move. They have enjoyed this
privilege for so long that they now seem to consider it their
prerogative. If Will Rogers were alive today, they say, he would be
the first to object.</TE>
<TE>   Nonsense. Rogers loved horses, no question about it. But mostly he
loved people, meaning the public at large. When his widow left his
beloved ranch to the state, the gift deed required that the property
"be used exclusively as a public park and as a place of public
recreation in a manner not inconsistent with its maintenance as a
memorial and historical monument." Nothing was said about private
horse boarding.</TE>
<TE>   Does the state parks department think horses and equestrian
activities are an important part of the Will Rogers legacy?
Absolutely. Trail riding continues just as it does at scores of other
state parks. Polo matches will resume in the spring, as they do every
year. It is only private horse boarding that is being temporarily
suspended.</TE>
<TE>   We are convening a special advisory group to help develop a new
equestrian plan. Many interests will be represented, including
equestrian. The new plan could include overnight horse boarding. But
it also may include horses for rent by the public, occasional horse
shows or roping demonstrations and other public equestrian
activities.</TE>
<TE>   A ranger recently told me of a visitor to Will Rogers who had
hiked up to the historic barn above the ranch house. He saw the
boarded horses in the stalls, some of their names engraved on signs
attached to the doors, and the privately employed grooms working in
the area. He hurried away. He told the ranger that he thought the
area was private and off-limits to park visitors. No public park
should be perceived that way.</TE>
<TE>   Our vision for the park wants more people, not fewer, to enjoy the
park and to better understand what Will Rogers meant to this country.</TE>

<LD>You can smell it in the air. Like a fresh Texas oilfield, the
partisan sweat glands are pumping. Americans are mad, and somebody
better pay for this.</LD>
<LD>   I say, bring it on.</LD>
<LD>   The time is right for a partisan uproar. But for my money--and
yes, I owned shares in a mutual fund that lost on Enron, so I'm an
aggrieved party--this is a case where there are as many shortsighted
temptations as virtuous opportunities.</LD>
<TE>   Democrats may call the mess cronyism and grab a few swing voters
here and there by trying to place Enron at the doorstep of Kenneth
Lay's favorite politician, George W. Bush. But there is something
bigger at play.</TE>
<TE>   Remember, Al Gore didn't lose in 2000 because of the Supreme Court
or disputed ballots in Florida. He lost because of Ralph Nader and
2.9 million voters, nearly 97,488 of them in Florida, who felt things
were out of kilter between citizens and their government.</TE>
<TE>   Republican ambitions cannot ignore the discontent either. They
won't get far with their rising cries, "The Democrats cozied up to
Enron too." A Clinton rerun isn't going to draw many legitimately
dismayed Americans into the shelter of the GOP tent.</TE>
<TE>   If we're lucky, Enron will grow beyond being a scramble for the
scraps off the carcass. The result of that will only be some new and
incomprehensibly complicated accounting rules, a halfhearted reform
of campaign financing, a year of finger-pointing and perhaps the
welcome sight of a few spit-shined millionaires standing tall in
court.</TE>
<TE>   We'd be many times better off, those of us who aren't lobbyists or
lawyers, if the Democrats had the guts to draw the Republicans into a
face-off over principles. Of course this would require Democrats to
find some. But it would be about time. What does the Democratic Party
stand for, anyway, beyond GOP-lite or Bush-wrong?</TE>
<TE>   The business pages show that investors have been spooked about
high-flying conglomerates of all stripes. As usual, people are ahead
of their government. But is it enough to say, see, market forces will
take care of things? Or should we return to the founding principle of
free enterprise, which is, that self-governance legitimately places
the interest of consumers ahead of desires of producers?</TE>
<TE>   It was none other than economic theorist Adam Smith, hero to
conservatives, who warned that a nation built "for the sole purpose
of raising up a people of customers" would not be in the interest of
shopkeepers but merely "a nation whose government is influenced by
shopkeepers."</TE>
<TE>   Surely, Democrats cannot remain too timid to engage voters in a
debate about the nation's domestic purpose and how to achieve it. And
there is no irony in noting that such a foursquare confrontation also
might prompt Republicans to reflect on a dogma that sought to free
Americans from the heavy hand of self-serving government only to put
us under the heel of self-serving corporations.</TE>
<TE>   Enron is a scandal about ideals gone awry, about the dangers of
forgoing the protections of checks and balances in public affairs.
Bush's warm connections to Enron are fair game, but it's pipsqueak
politics to leave matters there. And Democrats, given their recent
record, have little standing when it comes to unsavory associations.</TE>
<TE>   The president deserves the respect accorded a family that has
devoted itself to public service like few others, father, son and
brother. He rates credit for directness. He's not for energy
companies in some secretive fashion. He's for them openly. Far from
shy, he's unabashedly for unrestrained business, Wild West
entrepreneurship, wealth without limits, resource development and
individual competition.</TE>
<TE>   Until we know differently, we should take him at his word when he
says he was outraged by Kenneth Lay's sneaky dealings. Few things
sting a proud man like being embarrassed by a friend. But we should
also listen to his words when he, on the same day, goes to bat for
the very ideal that encouraged Enron to happen: That government is
some "wacky" (his word) force and that business-still-knows-best in
domestic affairs.</TE>
<TE>   "And we don't need a lot of regulation either," he told machinery
company workers in West Virginia. "The federal government ought to be
wise about how we enforce standards but not over-regulate those who
are trying to create work."</TE>
<TE>   In any country, at any time, a company might cook its books. But
only here in this heyday of government-bashers and deregulation mania
could we have Enron.</TE>

<HD>An Endorsement That's Nothing to Crow About</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRANK del OLMO</AU>
<BD>Frank del Olmo is associate editor of The Times.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mexicans say that someone who makes promises they can't keep is puro
jarabe de pico. It means they speak nothing but syrupy phrases. An
earthy equivalent in this country would be to say they're just
shucking and jiving. Either description would aptly describe a recent
endorsement by the Mexican American Political Assn.</LD>
<LD>   MAPA used to be a real force in California, making endorsements on
behalf of a Latino minority that was still unsophisticated in the
ways of U.S. politics. Founded after World War II, MAPA's apogee was
in the 1960s, when it helped elect Ed Roybal, the first California
Latino in Congress, and was part of the coalition that helped elect
John Kennedy president and Pat Brown governor of California.</LD>
<LD>   It's been pretty much downhill for MAPA since. As the state's
Latino population has grown dramatically (Latinos are one-third of
California's 33 million residents), it also has grown more
diverse--so diverse that no one group can stake out political
positions on its behalf.</LD>
<TE>   So why does MAPA persist in trying?</TE>
<TE>   Cynics point to the ambition of a few MAPA leaders who want to use
a well-known name with an honorable history to promote their own
agendas. But the real reason is because political candidates who know
MAPA's time has passed still maneuver to get its endorsement in the
hope of swaying a few votes.</TE>
<TE>   The latest pol to try this is California Secretary of State Bill
Jones, who is fighting an uphill battle for the GOP gubernatorial
nomination against better-financed candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Although Jones is the only Republican who holds a statewide
office, he trails former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan in public
opinion polls. Worse, many of those same polls have Jones barely
outpacing businessman Bill Simon, the political neophyte who is the
third GOP candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Given Jones' increasingly desperate situation--the primary
election is just weeks away--it's understandable he would play up any
endorsement. But in trying to promote his backing by MAPA, Jones
stirred up a campaign flap that has served to remind everyone how far
MAPA's star has fallen.</TE>
<TE>   Jones and Riordan engaged in a war of press releases last week
that got attention only in the Spanish-language media. At issue was
how Jones got MAPA's endorsement.</TE>
<TE>   It happened by default. MAPA bylaws state that it endorses only
candidates who show up at its convention. Jones attended the meeting
earlier this month. Riordan, Simon and the man all three want to
defeat, Gov. Gray Davis, did not. What galls Riordan--who is courting
Latino voters--is that he tried to address the meeting via
closed-circuit television but was foiled by technical problems.</TE>
<TE>   By last week, when the Spanish-language daily La Opinion ran a
front-page article on the controversy, the Davis campaign was putting
out press releases quoting MAPA members who back the governor's
reelection.</TE>
<TE>   All of this led the newspaper's political editor, Pilar Marrero,
to archly conclude that "never has so much paper, and saliva, been
wasted arguing over something whose political significance is
uncertain."</TE>
<TE>   That is a polite way of saying MAPA's endorsement may not be worth
spit, or the paper it's written on.</TE>
<TE>   As the Latino population grows, Latino politics inevitably will
mature. Many organizations will emerge to promote Latinos' varied
interests. Already there are campaign volunteers and groups that
raise money for Latina candidates, for labor union candidates, for
pro-business candidates and even for non-Latino candidates.</TE>
<TE>   That's the way politics has evolved in this country since the days
of the Federalist Papers. It is the way I expect politics to continue
as more Latino citizens step into the arena.</TE>
<TE>   MAPA-istas can take great pride in the foundation their
organization helped build for such progress. But it's time everyone
gave up the pretense that MAPA's endorsement speaks for all Latinos.</TE>

<HD>Economic Fanaticism Is Bad for Seoul</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHALMERS JOHNSON</AU>
<BD> Chalmers Johnson is the author most recently of
"Blowback: the Costs and Consequences of American Empire" (2001, Holt
"Owl" Books).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The most dangerous kind of "jihadists" are not the religious ones.
Today, the economic fundamentalists--the contemporary American
free-market globalizers and the older Leninists--are the real
fanatics. Nothing, not even economic disaster, will dissuade them
from the belief that their doctrines are the absolute truth. The U.S.
Treasury and its puppet, the International Monetary Fund, fall into
this category.</LD>
<LD>   Unless South Korea resists such doctrinaire thinking, it is in
danger of repeating its own near-meltdown of 1997. That disaster, as
well as the financial crises of the past few years in Mexico,
Indonesia, Thailand, Brazil, Russia and Argentina, all occurred while
these countries were dutifully following the "Washington consensus."
This Anglo-American economic model, propounded by the U.S. Treasury
and the IMF, calls for opening foreign countries to international
capital while cutting back on wages, safety nets and services to
ordinary citizens.</LD>
<LD>   At the moment, the South Korean economy is growing better than
most economies worldwide, based on domestic sales and exports to
China. But some market analysts in Seoul, blinded by the Washington
consensus, want Korean firms to more closely adhere to U.S. standards
in corporate governance. If Korea follows this advice, it most likely
will be overcome again by economic chaos.</LD>
<TE>   The IMF's former managing director, Michel Camdessus, charged that
South Korea's 1997 economic crisis was caused in part by "crony
capitalism," by which he meant the East Asian model of close
collaboration between government, banks and big business to achieve
national economic goals and maintain high employment.</TE>
<TE>   But what exactly are U.S. standards of corporate governance? The
recent bankruptcy of the Enron Corp., the United States'
seventh-largest corporation before its collapse, offers insights into
the Anglo-American alternative. Enron made political contributions to
George W. Bush, three-fourths of the U.S. Senate and almost half of
the House of Representatives. Its actions may cheat its 4,000
employees out of their pensions. It may have colluded with its
accounting firm to cover up sham profits.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than "crony capitalism," the U.S. offers an example of what
should be called "organized crime." The remedy for crony capitalism
is effective law enforcement, not IMF demands that the interests of
foreign investors be protected before all others. But there is no
known remedy for American-style "organized crime," which suggests
that the U.S. days of economic hegemony may be numbered.</TE>
<TE>   Models do matter, but South Korea needs to develop an economic
model designed for its particular problems. South Korea needs to do
the following:</TE>
<TE>   It needs to ensure its ability to compete with China over the long
haul, because China can manufacture anything more cheaply than any
other nation; it needs to innovate products that are not only high
tech but that also create new standards and are thereby invulnerable
to reverse engineering; and it needs to become proficient in advanced
services, including architecture, medical education, business
planning, housing, fashion and entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea's most important long-term strategic problem is how to
cultivate the Chinese market. It can take advantage of the fact that
the Chinese do not hate Koreans the way they hate and envy the
Japanese.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, South Korea, in response to the nagging of its patron,
the U.S., abolished the main body for making economic policy. It also
loosened virtually all controls over financial institutions. The
result was a near-disaster for the economy. The immediate task is to
reverse these self-inflicted wounds.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea needs an economic planning body that will produce a
strategy for the difficult years to come and not simply please the
economic fanatics of the IMF.</TE>

<LD>It shouldn't be so hard to stop the mad--often illegal--rush to put
billboards on every available corner in Los Angeles. Given a magic
billboard-disappearing wand, most residents would know what to do
with it. The exceptions might be some of the members of the City
Council.</LD>
<LD>   Last week Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski introduced a motion to
permanently ban new billboards and to move against the thousands of
illegal signs around town. City Hall insiders give her proposal long
odds in the 15-member council, mostly because the billboard companies
have been generous campaign contributors in many local races.</LD>
<LD>   Miscikowski's motion would make permanent the city's temporary
moratorium on new signs unless neighborhoods, like sections of
Hollywood and the Sunset Strip, are part of a special
billboard-permit district. Her motion would also impose an annual tax
on each existing sign. Currently, the companies pay only a one-time
fee when the billboard goes up, while even dog owners pay yearly
licensing. And dogs, unlike billboards, don't usually generate
$50,000 a month or more for their owners.</LD>
<TE>   The new billboard funds would hire additional city inspectors.
There are now just four to police the nearly 10,000 billboards,
making timely action against the estimated 4,000 illegal signs nearly
hopeless. Inspectors are often outmaneuvered by billboard company
lawyers on the rare occasions the city brings action against an
illegal sign.</TE>
<TE>   City voters would have to ratify the billboard tax, which
Miscikowski hopes will be on the November ballot. The council
proposal is unrelated to the squabble in West Hollywood between the
developer of a large Sunset Strip project who plans billboards on his
property and a large billboard company that is financing
"grass-roots" opposition to this potential business competitor. That
battle is small potatoes compared with the stakes in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Five of Miscikowski's 14 colleagues, all council newcomers,
already stand with her. Another group, led by Mark Ridley-Thomas,
still backs the proposal that the previous council passed last year.
That plan, strongly endorsed by the advertisers themselves, would
allow dozens of lucrative new billboards to go up along local
freeways. In return, the industry would promise to remove possibly
1,400 less profitable signs along city streets.</TE>
<TE>   Ridley-Thomas' measure hasn't come to a vote in large part because
ordinance drafters are struggling to define a formula for the
exchange that does more than just reward the industry for ditching
small, low-profit signs.</TE>
<TE>   Miscikowski's plan is simpler and better for the city. The revenue
generated by the tax she proposes would enable the city to finally
identify and remove the illegal signs that trash city streets. No
behemoth signs would go up beside the freeways.</TE>
<TE>   The council could take up Miscikowski's billboard ban next month.
Members who care about how the city looks, and about their
independence from a powerful special interest, will vote for it.</TE>

<LD>Of all the steps that government has taken in the name of national
security, none reduce dependence on oil from the Middle East, which
is arguably the nation's biggest economic weakness.</LD>
<LD>   Vice President Dick Cheney and his allies in Congress who say the
key solution is drilling in Alaska's national wildlife refuge miss
the point. The refuge would not reach peak production for two
decades, and the United States needs to begin curbing its need for
imported oil now. President Bush deserves credit for moving away from
his vice president's Neanderthal position.</LD>
<LD>   Were Saudi Arabia, which contains nearly half of the world's oil
reserves, to shut off its spigots tomorrow, it would wreak havoc in
the United States, which guzzles one-quarter of the world's oil but
contains only 3% of its known reserves.</LD>
<TE>   The best permanent route to energy independence is tighter fuel
efficiency standards for cars and tax incentives to encourage
corporate energy efficiency and development of energy alternatives to
oil. The energy plan that Cheney unveiled last spring instead focused
like an Enron lobbyist on supply--on relaxing environmental
regulations to allow more domestic oil drilling and higher coal
emissions.</TE>
<TE>   Bush took a few solid steps away from Cheney in a speech in West
Virginia last week. ''We've got to promote technologies that will
enable people to have the same lifestyle without burning as much
energy," he said. "We've got to figure out ways for our cars to burn
less fuel ... we've got to conserve energy.''</TE>
<TE>   Some administration officials are urging Bush to go beyond green
rhetoric in his State of the Union speech Tuesday and champion two
concrete reforms: requiring energy companies to develop an emissions
trading system and creating a research program to develop cars fueled
by hydrogen. It's a start, though some environmentalists are rightly
concerned that the administration might use the distant vision of
hydrogen fuel cells or emissions trading to avoid bold short-term
action.</TE>
<TE>   If Bush is serious, he will have to also spend some political
capital on auto makers. A cowed Congress hasn't raised auto fuel
efficiency standards in 20 years. Bush can provide lawmakers some
courage by supporting a proposal by Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.).
Kerry would require that U.S. cars and light trucks average 40 miles
per gallon by 2012 and 55 miles per gallon by 2020. The new-car
average today, not counting SUVs and other light trucks, is 28 mpg.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's newfound emphasis on energy conservation may be partly an
attempt to help the GOP win environmental votes in this fall's
election. A less cynical interpretation may also be true. Bush is not
only a former oilman from Midland, Texas, but also the son of the
first President Bush, who helped pioneer tax-based emissions trading
systems when he signed the Clean Air Act in 1990. He's got the genes,
and he may be grasping the need.</TE>

<LD>First off, Canadians are swell neighbors. They keep to their own yard
and don't blare the radio. Canadians make good wood, beer and
glaciers. They've had good inventions too: basketball, hockey,
Pablum, Canada Dry, insulin and the banana split, any of which could
be an answer when using another Canadian invention, Trivial Pursuit.
But they've gone a bit too far now: Canada is kidnapping the
manufacture of LifeSavers, that hallowed hard-candy American
institution that's fueled family outings for generations. Kraft Foods
Inc. announced it will soon stop making LifeSavers in the United
States of America and move that operation to Quebec. Make all the
engine blocks and jeans you want in Mexico, but LifeSavers offshored
to Canada? C'mon, that leaves a sour taste.</LD>
<LD>   LifeSavers have been an American-made tradition since Clarence
Crane, a Cleveland confectioner, wanted to boost candy sales in the
summer, a bad time for chocolate in the pre-refrigeration days of
1912. If you're over 90, you may recall 1912's other big news: the
Titanic. Disdaining the pillow-shaped globs of fancy European
goodies, Crane hired a pill maker to design an original shape,
settling on little disks with a hole in the middle, like the
lifesavers then on everyone's mind.</LD>
<TE>   Originally a health mint ("For that stormy breath!"), peppermint
LifeSavers entered millions of pockets and purses. Over the years 24
more flavors were added (Wild Cherry, 1934; Five Flavors, 1935;
Butterscotch, 1951). Others were abandoned (Anise, 1934;
Molas-O-Mint, 1942, and Root Beer, 1968).</TE>
<TE>   No one could count the sibling spats over who wins the red ones or
gets stuck with the green ones, or the roulette games over which end
of the roll starts with a favorite flavor. How do you properly close
the cylinder (are you a ripper or a folder?). What else do you do
with LifeSavers (hold up cake candles, flavor cups of tea)? And then
comes the important debate over crunching versus sucking; one
enhances consumption, the other appreciation.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, 46 billion LifeSavers are consumed annually, 54 miles
of little round lozenges per day, all now forged in Holland, Mich.
Next year the secret formula will be made only near Montreal, in a
nonunion plant with duty-free access to cheaper Cuban sugar; saving
10 cents a pound adds up when you're using 113 tons a day.</TE>
<TE>   Selling satellite technology to China is one thing; entrusting
LifeSavers' secret Wild Cherry formula to Canadians is another. Next
thing you know, Canadians will be luring producers to make Hollywood
movies up north because it's cheaper.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Sides Agree on Canal Upgrade, but Not on How," Jan. 21:</LD>
<LD>   The mind-set behind the city's planned restoration of the Venice
Grand Canal is the same psychology that brought us AstroTurf and
aluminum Christmas trees. God bless Marcia Hanscom's Wetlands Action
Network and the Sierra Club for holding the city to the standard of
ecologically sensitive habitat restoration instead.</LD>
<LD>   Hopefully, the city will have the smarts to sit down with the
biologists who have pointed out the severe deficiencies in its plan
and craft a settlement, rather than dig in for the protracted,
pointless legal wrangle that Councilwoman Ruth Galanter claims the
city doesn't want and that would require the refunding of assessment
fees to local residents.</LD>

<TE>   Your story really didn't give us both sides of the argument. On
our walks along the broken concrete path, my wife and I also agree:
It is a "woeful site." However, we also know that a long-term view of
this treasured part of our county's coastline demands more than
short-term (albeit aesthetic) remedies. Important, ecologically
compelling facts including endangered species, daily tidal flow and
natural (not imported) habitat are a few of the considerations that
precipitated a Superior Court judge's decision to bring the city's
project to a halt.</TE>

<TE>   The land under question is public property, and the city of L.A.
should listen to and work with all interested citizens who have
concerns that this dredging project will unnecessarily destroy marine
life. We don't need another mess like the Ballona Lagoon
"restoration," in which thousands of clams and other marine life were
dredged up to die in the sun, while they "fixed" the lagoon.</TE>

<LD>Re "Council Split Over Call to Ban Billboards," Jan. 23: Billboards
are nothing more than a crass, vulgar form of commercialism and do
nothing but show what a lack of taste and appreciation we have for
the beautiful part of the world we live in. They are ugly and a
distraction to motorists.</LD>
<LD>   At a time in our history when there are so many other forms of
media available to business, this form of advertisement has in fact
been rendered obsolete. There is no longer a reason to trade the lost
beauty of our skyline for the sake of promoting a product. I am in
favor of an all-out ban on this urban blight and a plan to completely
eliminate them. Our City Council should take decisive action toward
this end as quickly as possible.</LD>

<LD>Re "Newborn Boy Found in Trash Bin," Jan. 23: How many more babies
have to be found in trash bins before the state runs some public
service announcements about the new law that says people can leave
babies at hospitals without fear of prosecution? When we had the
energy crisis last year, it took almost no time at all for the state
to run ads (some of which are still running) encouraging us to save
energy. There should be even more urgency in running ads to save
babies. Obviously the word isn't getting out about the new law.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis and state legislators, it is way past time to get
off the dime and do something that will actually save lives. Get the
public service announcements out! Parents who find themselves in
crisis don't have to discard their babies like trash.</LD>

<LD>Jonathan Turley's Jan. 23 commentary ("Sever Lindh's Ties to His
Homeland") suggested that John Walker Lindh may not be a citizen
through his taking up arms for the then-Taliban-led Afghan
government. Lindh's defense counsel would be absolutely delighted to
have Turley's suggestion adopted. Most of the crimes of which Lindh
is accused require one to be either in the U.S. or a U.S. citizen. If
Lindh had given up his citizenship, then the accusations fall by the
wayside. Is this what Turley wants?</LD>
<LD>   Gary M. Greenbaum</LD>
<LD>   Fairfax, Va.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Professor Turley argues that Lindh should be stripped of his U.S.
citizenship under the "current standard" on loss of nationality. He
fails to mention, however, that the statute also requires that the
citizen intend to relinquish his citizenship. Lindh has never said he
wishes to renounce his U.S. citizenship. Unless and until his intent
to relinquish it is proved, Turley should refrain from making such a
serious allegation.</TE>

<TE>   With the debate raging about the youthful "American Talib" Lindh
and what to do with him, it's worth noting that American patriot
Nathan Hale was all of 21 years old when he gave "but one life" for
his country. It would seem that the patriotic courage marked by
Hale's tender years provides a striking counterpoint to the utter
folly of Lindh's. Hale, like Lindh, was captured behind enemy lines.
The similarities end there, however: Young Nathan Hale was hanged
from the neck. And 20-year-old Lindh has some serious explaining to
do.</TE>

<LD>Re "Peggy Lee, Sultry Jazz and Pop Singer, Dies at 81," Jan. 23: When
I was a 17-year-old college freshman in Boston in 1943, one of the
local, late-evening disc jockeys had a ritual. Every weeknight, just
past 11:30, he played Peggy Lee's recording of "Where or When," with
the Benny Goodman Trio. The tempo was unhurried, thoughtful, rich
with feeling and promise. The singer seemed to be singing directly to
me, and in our crowded dormitory room we sat, eyes closed, each of us
alone with our hopeful dreams. She was something special.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I belong to the so-called righteous "one side," according to Yossi
Klein Halevi (" 'Cycle of Violence' Is a Middle East Lie,"
Commentary, Jan. 23). But after reading his article I feel like I
belong to the self-righteous "one side."</LD>
<LD>   The cycle of violence in the Middle East is neither a lie nor a
myth. It usually stems from at least two reasons: 1) When one side
believes that his or her life is more valuable than the other side's
(something Americans, too, should think deeply and hard about in the
aftermath of Sept. 11 and the war against the Afghan people); and 2)
when the other side, out of complete desperation and hopelessness, is
compelled to inflict on the one side the same pain and wounds that
the one side has been inflicting on the other side for so long. I'm
not in the business of justifying murder and terrorism, but I don't
need Halevi's demagoguery to show me who is to blame and who is not.</LD>

<TE>   You've done your readers a great service by publishing Halevi's
trenchant distillation of the true calculus of Middle East violence.
It may not stop the continued use of "cycle of violence" but it
certainly puts into question the true understanding of those who
continue to use the term.</TE>

<TE>   Re "The Stops Are Pulled Out in the Mideast," Commentary, Jan. 24:
Hussein Ibish may pontificate about Israel's alleged transgressions
until hell freezes over. But when all is said and done, one
irrefutable fact remains: When Israel stops shooting, the violence
continues. When the Palestinians stop shooting, the violence ends.</TE>
<TE>   Israel offered the Palestinians 95% of what they demanded. They
responded by spitting in Israel's face--just as the Arab world has
been doing ever since Israel gained independence in 1948. That too is
an irrefutable fact.</TE>

<LD>In "The Enron Benefit" (editorial, Jan. 23) you state, "Passage of
the bill is not a certainty once it reaches the House floor.
Opponents may try to substitute weaker legislation or employ 'poison
pill' amendments." This should provoke the citizens of this country
to march on Washington and demand--demand--that our country be taken
back from the wealthy lobbyists and returned to the American people
where it rightfully belongs. If there is any "benefit" to this Enron
debacle and debauchery, this could be it. How much and how long?</LD>

<LD>Re "Studiously Studying Studies," editorial, Jan. 22: I found it
interesting that you did not name the specific organization or
persons responsible for ordering an unneeded study of the Ventura
Freeway corridor. The editorial referred to "organizers," "city
officials" and "they." I am ashamed to say that I too have begun to
refer to my government as "they," just as the nut cases and domestic
terrorists who attack our society have referred to their/our federal
government.</LD>
<LD>   I appreciate you identifying the state legislators who have worked
so hard to spend more taxpayer money to decrease noncitizens' payment
for a California college education and to insure unmarried domestic
partners. This comes just as private industry and the rest of the
world attempt to cut expenses.</LD>
<LD>   All the while the California lawmakers have failed to pass
legislation that would enable Californians to take advantage of
federal retirement incentives in 2002. I find it ironic that "they"
didn't take care of the very taxpayers who pay for the costly
legislation "they" do pass.</LD>

<HD>Context Is Everything with Racial Profiling</HD>
<DH>No one would think it wrong to use profiling to screen for
Bin Laden.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER H. SCHUCK</AU>
<BD>Peter H. Schuck is the Simeon E. Baldwin professor at
Yale Law School and the author of "The Limits of Law: Essays on
Democratic Governance."</BD>
<DL>NEW HAVEN, Conn.</DL>
<LD>Every day brings new headlines about racial or ethnic profiling. A
Secret Service agent who guards the president is not permitted to
board an airplane because he is Arab American and cannot satisfy the
screeners about his identity. Two white New Jersey state troopers
plead guilty to shooting into a van containing four men--three blacks
and one Latino--after being instructed to single out such people as
drug suspects. These shameful incidents shock our sense of justice.
Can anything be said for profiling in a democratic society of equal
citizens?</LD>
<LD>   Let's begin with our values as a society. We should be wary of
claims that we must sacrifice our ideals in the name of national
security. The ideal most threatened by profiling is the equality of
all individuals before the law. Differential treatment must meet a
burden of justification--in the case of racial classifications, a
very high one. Government may not treat individuals arbitrarily, but
must base its actions on information reliable enough to justify its
exercise of power over them.</LD>
<TE>   How good must the information be? The law's answer is that it
depends. Criminal punishment requires proof beyond a reasonable
doubt, while a tort judgment demands only the preponderance of the
evidence. Health agencies must often act with little more than a
rational suspicion that a substance might be dangerous. Information
good enough for one kind of decision, then, is not nearly good enough
for others. The same police officer needs better information for an
arrest than for a traffic stop. Context is everything.</TE>
<TE>   So, what should the airport screener do? What would we do in his
or her place? Each day, we all face choices that are similar in
structure, albeit far less consequential. We must make decisions
rapidly about things that matter to us. We know our information is
inadequate to the choice, but we also know that we cannot, in the
time available, get information that is significantly better. We
might make errors of different kinds and know that some would be
worse than others. Because we must momentarily integrate all this
uncertainty into a concrete choice, we resort to shortcuts. The most
important and universal of them is the stereotype, which, by
economizing on information, enables us to decide quickly to
inadequate information. This problem of limited information is so
ubiquitous that we scarcely notice how often we use stereotypes to
solve it.</TE>
<TE>   We could not live without stereotypes. They help us predict how
others will behave (we assume blacks will vote Democratic, though
many do not) and to anticipate what others want (we offer help to
disabled people, though some of them find this intrusive). They alert
us to possible danger, as when a large, unkempt, angry-looking man
approaches us on a dark street (though he may simply be asking
directions). Such assumptions are especially important in a mass
society where people know less and less about one another.</TE>
<TE>   Stereotypes have an obvious downside: They are sometimes wrong, as
my examples show. After all, if they were wrong all the time, no
rational person would use them, and if they were never wrong, they
would be indisputable facts, not stereotypes. Stereotypes fall
somewhere in between these extremes, but it is hard to know precisely
where, because we seldom know precisely how accurate they are. Most
are probably correct much more often than not; that is why they are
useful. But when a stereotype is wrong, those who are exceptions to
it naturally feel they have not been treated equally as individuals.
They are right, and we share their sense of injustice. When their
indignation is compounded by official discourtesy, animus or violence
(as in New Jersey), the wound is deeper still.</TE>
<TE>   This is where the law comes in. When we view stereotype-based
injustices as sufficiently grave, we prohibit them. Even then,
however, we do so only in a qualified way that expresses our
ambivalence. Civil rights law, for example, proscribes racial,
gender, disability and age stereotypes. Yet it allows some
public-interest or business reasons to justify them. Religious groups
can hire only co-religionists. Officials drawing legislative
districts can, to some extent, treat all members of a minority group
as if they all had the same political interests. The military can bar
women from certain combat roles. Employers can assume that women are
usually less suitable for jobs requiring heavy lifting. Such
stereotypes are thought to be reasonable in general, though false as
to particular individuals.</TE>
<TE>   Can the same be said of racial or ethnic profiling? Again, context
is everything. We would object to a public college that categorically
admitted women rather than men on the theory that women tend to be
better students--not because the stereotype is false, but because the
school can determine academic promise on an individualized basis when
reviewing applicants' files, which it must do anyway. On the other
hand, no one would think it unjust for the FBI to screen for Osama
bin Laden, who is a very tall man with a beard and turban, by
stopping all men meeting that general description. The stakes in
apprehending him are immense, and gender, size, physiognomy and dress
are valuable clues in making instantaneous decisions about whom to
stop. Yet each person stopped is statistically likely to be a false
positive and to feel unjustly treated for having been singled out.</TE>
<TE>   Racial profiling in more typical law-enforcement settings can
raise difficult moral questions. Suppose that society views drug
dealing as a serious vice, and that drug dealers are
disproportionately black, although many dealers are white. Would this
stereotype justify stopping blacks simply because of their color?
Clearly not. The law properly requires more particularized evidence
of wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Suppose further, however, that police officers observe a black man
engaging in the furtive behavior that characterizes most but not all
drug dealers--behavior also engaged in by some innocents. Legally,
this stereotype would justify stopping the man. But what if the
officer relied on both stereotypes in some impossible-to-parse
combination? What if the behavioral stereotype alone had produced a
very close call, and the racial one had pushed it over the line?</TE>
<TE>   Although I cannot answer all of these questions, we need to begin
asking them. A wise policy will insist that the justice of profiling
depends on a number of variables. How serious is the crime risk? How
do we assess the relative costs of false positives and false
negatives? How accurate is the stereotype? How practicable is it to
pursue the facts through an individualized inquiry rather than
through stereotypes? If we must use stereotypes, do some rely on less
incendiary and objectionable factors?</TE>
<TE>   Stereotypes that seem reasonable when deciding whom to screen for
questioning may be unacceptable at the arrest and prosecution stages
when more individualized information and procedural safeguards become
available. Screeners can recognize the many exceptions to even
serviceable stereotypes, and can behave accordingly--so that those
being screened understand the reason and do not to take it
personally.</TE>
<TE>   Profiling is bound to be part of the post-Sept. 11 dispensation.
Clearer thinking and more sensitivity to its potential uses and
abuses can help produce both a safer and a more just America.</TE>

<HD>Know Limits of Security Deposits Before Renting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H. MAY SPITZ</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From the plushest mansion to the plainest walk-up, all tenants share
this question: How much security deposit is required for move-in?</LD>
<LD>   In this hot market, renters are vying for places, but they may not
know the law protects, defines and regulates that question under
California state law, primarily Civil Section 1950.5 (available in
detail at www.leginfo.ca.gov). Here are a few highlights to give you
some security before you deposit:</LD>
<LD>   Move-in fees and deposits go by several names and all have a part
to play. However, no matter what term is used by the landlord, such
as "cleaning deposit," "key deposit," "pet deposit" or even "last
month's rent," the law considers all money taken as the same
thing--security deposit.</LD>
<TE>   While there is no minimum deposit amount set by law, California
state law defines maximum security deposit and couches the specifics
based on furnishings.</TE>
<TE>   Unfurnished rentals have a set limit that cannot exceed two
months' worth of rent. For example, if your rent is $1,000 a month,
the maximum security deposit you can be asked to pay for an
unfurnished place is $2,000. At move-in, your cost could be $3,000
total (deposit plus rent for the first month).</TE>
<TE>   Furnished property allows up to three months' rent ($4,000 total
for the above example) as security deposit. Recently I read about a
new landlord charging extra for a stove since he claimed that made
the place "furnished." That concept doesn't stand up to scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   "Furnished" is defined as providing basic furniture for living in
the place, including, but not limited to a couch or chairs for the
living room, a bed in each bedroom and a table with chairs for
dining. In addition, a refrigerator and stove must be included in
furnished rentals.</TE>
<TE>   According to state law, the cost for credit checks or application
fee is not part of the move-in fee and is allowed to be
nonrefundable, unless taken improperly. What is improper? When an
application and fee are taken and the landlord knows (or should have)
that no rental unit was available at that time or will be within a
reasonable period of time. The legal limit for a landlord to collect
for applicants is currently $30 per person. You are entitled to a
copy of your credit check for no additional charge.</TE>
<TE>   What if your landlord refuses to rent to you and your beloved dog
unless you pay a separate "pet deposit"? Can you sign a pet deposit
agreement on the side and pay a little extra deposit for the varmint?
Yes and no.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, you can sign whatever you find palatable as a consenting
adult, but not if your legal rights are violated or breached in any
way. No, you can't sign away a legal right in the state of
California. The pet deposit still has to be within the legal security
deposit limit, even if both landlord and tenant agree to a higher
amount.</TE>
<TE>   Recently a friend called me, bursting with excitement over her new
place. "I'm so excited," she said, "I finally found an apartment that
would let me have my dog Max!" No small feat, since Max is the size
of a bus with fur. "How much was the deposit?" I asked.</TE>
<TE>   Turned out the landlady took two months security, plus a $500 pet
deposit, plus $85 nonrefundable cleaning fee. Except for the two
months' security, the rest the landlady took has been illegal since
before 1986. Nonrefundable deposit fees are illegal.</TE>
<TE>   Some landlords or managers are a bit rusty on the law, since no
education is required. The only exception is for off-site managers,
who are supposed to have a current California real estate license,
which requires testing and continuing education.</TE>
<TE>   How to avoid getting stuck with an illegal or excessive deposit
fee? If you are being asked an excessive fee, politely ask what it is
for. If it is called a "fee," and is claimed to be separate, you
could always mention the limit in California is two months' rent.</TE>
<TE>   Disagree agreeably. Perhaps the landlord or manager is willing to
listen. If not, their request for excessive fees may be a hint of
life as a tenant in their property. Do you really want to walk into
and live in a place that starts off on an illegal foot?</TE>

<HD>Real Estate Beginners Can Get a Solid Foundation in the
Basics</HD>
<DH>"Learning the Language of Real Estate" by Barbara Cox
(South-Western Publishing Co., Cincinnati, Ohio, 2002), $20.95, 248
pages.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT J. BRUSS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you are a beginner and want to quickly learn real estate basics,
this is a great place to start. This simple book teaches the
essentials that anyone involved with real estate needs to know.</LD>
<LD>   The book won't make the reader a real estate expert. But it easily
explains the fundamentals for those who know little or nothing about
real estate and who want to learn quickly.</LD>
<LD>   Emphasis is on learning real estate terms. Most sections have
brief, simple explanations of terms such as improvements, personal
property, fixture and chattel. Then the following page reinforces the
ideas with easy multiple-choice questions.</LD>
<TE>   This well-organized book probably isn't detailed enough to enable
readers to pass most state real estate license sales exams, but it is
a beginning. Readers who finish studying the book will have a solid
understanding of realty essentials.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the material is amazingly concise and thorough. For
example, the explanation of fee simple and fee simple absolute says:
"The type of landownership that gives the landowner the most rights
possible. When land is owned this way, the owner and the owner's
heirs own it forever." Then it goes on to explain a few more details.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the illustrations make an attempt at humor but aren't
funny or illustrative of the topic. But they do lighten the book,
which is sometimes boring.</TE>
<TE>   Some explanations of real estate terms and topics are superficial.
But that doesn't mean they aren't still useful and educational.</TE>
<TE>   To illustrate, in explaining lease-options, the author says: "The
lease-option gives the tenant a right to purchase the property at a
specific price up until a certain date. The tenant is not required to
purchase the property, but the owner is required to sell it if the
tenant decides to buy it according to the terms of the lease-option
agreement." That's enough for most realty beginners.</TE>
<TE>   Ideally, this book could be used as a textbook in a basic class
for students who want something less than a course in basic real
estate principles. An experienced teacher is needed to explain some
of the book's topics more thoroughly.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the explanation of escrows is good, but readers
unfamiliar with the concept are sure to have questions that are left
unanswered by the book. Some of the concepts, such as a "dry closing"
and "close into escrow," are obscure and not widely used even by real
estate practitioners.</TE>
<TE>   Readers of this book are likely to be motivated to learn real
estate basics, either alone with self-teaching or in a classroom. The
quiz questions with answers reinforce the learning experience. This
"quick learn" book is ideal for general knowledge.</TE>

<LD>U.S. homeowners spent 3% less on remodeling in the fourth quarter,
putting off renovations because of the recession, a Harvard
University report said.</LD>
<LD>   Homeowners spent $101.3 billion on home improvements in the fourth
quarter, down from $104.6 billion a year earlier, according to the
Cambridge, Mass., university's Joint Center for Housing Studies.</LD>
<LD>   The amount spent on remodeling is an indicator of future sales of
appliances and other products, said Kermit Baker, director of the
Remodeling Futures Program.</LD>
<TE>   "If you add a home office, you've got to fill it with computers
and furniture. The amount spent after a project is finished in all
likelihood approaches the amount spent on construction."</TE>
<TE>   Remodeling spending reached a record $112.2 billion in the second
quarter and fell to $101.4 billion in the third quarter.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Looking back, Valerie Lunden can't remember why she sat down with a
calculator and added up how many dollars had passed from her bank
account to her landlord's in the previous five years.</LD>
<LD>   It might have been the accumulation of 20 years of renting or
perhaps it was yet another hassle to get a minor repair at her
one-bedroom Studio City apartment.</LD>
<LD>   But she recalls how she reacted to the five-year tally of more
than $35,000: "I literally experienced a shortness of breath."
Lunden, 39, who works in marketing for United Way in Los Angeles,
said the idea of someone else getting tax breaks and earning property
equity as a result of her dollars was "nauseating."</LD>
<TE>   Not daring to total the 20-year cost of renting, Lunden
immediately set her resolve to become a homeowner, even as she
acknowledged the drawbacks that would bring.</TE>
<TE>   "Can you imagine I actually wanted to have a mortgage payment, pay
homeowner's association dues and property taxes?" she said, in
addition to paying for property upkeep. Still, the idea of owning a
property and enjoying the tax benefits outweighed her reservations.</TE>
<TE>   Less than a year later, she walked through the front door of her
own condominium--a two-bedroom, two-bathroom HUD repossession in
Westchester that she has polished into an immaculate, tranquil haven
for herself, two parakeets and a neighbor's cat, who comes by often
to visit.</TE>
<TE>   At the beginning of her quest, Lunden, a native of India educated
in England, pictured herself owning a small house with a yard, either
in the Valley or on the Westside near friends.</TE>
<TE>   Trouble was, as several real estate agents she contacted pointed
out, her modest income made her a "poor prospect." Plus, she didn't
have the 10% cash for a down payment required to purchase a property.</TE>
<TE>   "Or at least that's what I thought," she said. "I knew nothing
before I started."</TE>
<TE>   Left without illusions, Lunden used the Internet to search out
home-buying opportunities for someone in her financial condition.
Indeed, it was the Internet that finally led to her home.</TE>
<TE>   On the city of Los Angeles' Web site, she found a program offering
newly built homes, complete with yards, for low-income people.</TE>
<TE>   "I was ecstatic," she said, and played phone tag for two days
before learning she made too much money for the program.</TE>
<TE>   "How could this be?" she asked herself. "I had been led to believe
I was as poor as a church mouse."</TE>
<TE>   She reached what she considered the pivotal moment in her search
when a compassionate city employee recommended she find a mortgage
lender that specializes in financing programs for low-income home
buyers. Lunden was also told that she should become preapproved for a
loan before searching for a property.</TE>
<TE>   "You should get preapproved for any program," said Mary Neal
Swift, the lender Lunden found on the city's Web site, noting that
having approval allows a buyer to move fast when the right property
is located.</TE>
<TE>   Nervous to meet with Swift, Lunden made the appointment anyway and
filled out the necessary financial disclosure papers.</TE>
<TE>   "She was scared," said Swift, who put Lunden at ease with
anecdotes from her own home-buying and home-owning experience. She
told Lunden what she tells many clients: "You're going to be scared.
You're going to be on an emotional roller coaster."</TE>
<TE>   Swift gives clients her home number and tells them to call
anytime. "I'm your therapist for the next 60 days."</TE>
<TE>   Even Swift's encouragement didn't soften Lunden's disappointment
with the amount she was approved for: "a measly $125,000."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Lunden decided to focus on finding a property that was
within her price range, close to her job, located in an area where it
would appreciate in value and where she would be willing to live for
five years. Plus, after living in one-bedroom apartments for so many
years, she wanted more space.</TE>
<TE>   Expanding her Internet search, Lunden found the HUD site
(www.homesdirect.com), and listings of thousands of distressed or
foreclosed-upon properties for sale.</TE>
<TE>   Searching by ZIP Code in Los Angeles neighborhoods she favored,
Lunden found three properties of interest. One, a condo, was listed
at slightly more than her approved amount.</TE>
<TE>   Taking to heart Swift's admonition not to overbuy, she watched the
listing for weeks. When the condo was reduced to $110,000, Lunden
rushed out to take a look at the building, a 50-year-old renovated
apartment complex, with security gates and secured parking, on a
quiet, tree-lined street.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt immediately comfortable about the idea of living here,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   It took a week to find a HUD-approved real estate agent and see
inside the unit. The condo--converted from an apartment in the
1980s--needed carpet and paint, but Lunden was sold on the tile
floors in the kitchen and bathrooms and the sharp white cabinets with
wood trim. Although it was in a neighborhood she had considered
"questionable," Lunden said she felt secure when she spotted a police
station nearby.</TE>
<TE>   For the purchase, Swift recommended Lunden use an FHA-CHFA
(California Housing Finance Authority) loan with a "2-1 buydown,"
which meant the 6.75% interest rate would be reduced to 4.75% for the
first year of the loan, raised to 5.75% for the second year and then
remain at 6.75% for the remainder of the loan. All told, Lunden's
cash contribution was about $4,000 for closing costs.</TE>
<TE>   Lunden became a homeowner early last year for the first time.
Since then, she has met all her neighbors, and a friend has purchased
a condo in the complex. By now, Lunden's struggles to reach her goal
are fading into memory.</TE>
<TE>   "Just a few clicks of a mouse and a few taps on the keyboard of my
computer," she said, "and my dreams of homeownership came true."</TE>

<HD>With Stucco, Third Coat's a Charm</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MORRIS CAREY and JAMES CAREY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I need to know how much coverage an 80-pound bag of stucco
mix will provide if I want a quarter-inch thickness.</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Stucco is usually applied in three coats and is referred
to as 7/8-inch, three-coat stucco. The first coat is known as the
"scratch coat," the second is known as the "brown coat" and the final
coat is known as the "color coat" or "finish coat." There are various
other processes, but the one we refer to is most common.</LD>
<LD>   The first coat is about a half-inch thick, the second coat is
about a quarter-inch thick and the final coat is about an eighth-inch
thick. The first coat is troweled onto the paper-backed wire lath and
then the surface is scratched with a comb-like trowel, which results
in a ribbed or grooved finish. The scratched surface provides an
irregular plane that provides lots of "tooth" onto which the second
or "brown" coat can bond.</LD>
<TE>   The color coat is nothing more than stucco with color in it. For
patchwork, use plain gray for your final coat and paint it to match.
The color coat is usually applied in two phases: first a smoothing
layer and then texture. The texture can be troweled, sprayed or
splattered on.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the first two coats must cure for a minimum of seven days
before application of the following coat. Stucco cures best at
temperatures between 55 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit.</TE>
<TE>   For each 80-pound bag of mix you can figure on getting about 40
square feet of coverage for your first (scratch) coat and about twice
as much per bag on your second (brown) coat.</TE>
<TE>   A Miniature Drill Motor Will Make the Job Easier</TE>
<TE>   Q: We've put laminate flooring in the living-dining area. I have
located replacement stair treads (oak) and cut them to length,
finished and varnished them. The stringer is routed for the treads
and risers. The treads and risers are installed from underneath.</TE>
<TE>   The underneath area of the staircase is accessed from within our
shop area. I can access four of the five steps and treads. I
anticipate the fifth will be cut out in pieces because it is not
accessible from below (due to a finished wall that encloses the
shop).</TE>
<TE>   I anticipate the sequence will be as follows: remove old wedges
from risers, remove risers, remove wedges from tread and remove
tread. I was thinking that the risers could be spared, but the more I
look and ponder, I anticipate that even the tread will be difficult
to remove. Any easy way to remove wedges or shims to make the
replacement process easier?</TE>
<TE>   A: Sometimes a project seems so complicated we tend to overlook
the simplest alternatives. Getting out old hardwood wedges with a
chisel can be a bear, especially if the area is tight. You need
"little" here--not "big."</TE>
<TE>   Try a miniature drill motor. Several companies make really good
ones for use in crafts and model building. You probably can pick one
up with many attachments for less than $40.</TE>
<TE>   Once you own one, you and your family will fight over who gets it
next. Use a tiny grinding tip or an emery wheel. It acts just like a
tiny reciprocating saw.</TE>
<TE>   Gently Remove Rust From Around Stove's Damper</TE>
<TE>   Q: The flue is rusted shut on my earth stove (fireplace insert).
How can I get this unstuck?</TE>
<TE>   A: The thing that is rusted shut is called the damper. This is
going to be a tough one if you can't get to the damper itself. Rust
is not uncommon at this location, and if not dealt with on a regular
basis it can rust to the point where replacement will be the only way
to get it open.</TE>
<TE>   Spraying the perimeter of the damper with cutting oil is the first
order of business. Spray on an ample coat of WD-40 and let it sit for
an hour or so. Next, gently tap the perimeter of the damper with a
small heavy object such as a hammer. Repeat this process as many
times as necessary.</TE>
<TE>   If it doesn't come loose after several hours, you might have to
pull the stove and use heat. A propane-soldering torch (in a can) can
be used to warm up the area surrounding the damper. Usually, once
heat is applied, the metal surrounding the damper expands just enough
to break the rusted connection.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever you do, don't get rough. Anything other than a gentle
hand here could damage the damper.</TE>
<TE>   Rosin Paper Can Help Level Uneven Floor</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do I need to put a floor leveler over a plywood subfloor before
laying down an unfinished floor (3/4-inch x 2 1/4-inch oak)? What
about rosin paper? Do I need it and how do I place it on the floor?</TE>
<TE>   A: We would not use a floor-leveling compound between the subfloor
and the hardwood floor. They tend to break up over time. If the floor
is way out of level, the house might be due for a jack-up to correct
this.</TE>
<TE>   In any event, we suggest that you attach the hardwood planks
directly to the subfloor with only a coat of rosin paper overlapped 2
inches each way, and stapled in place. Don't use solid plastic
sheeting.</TE>

<HD>A New Method for Evaluating Your Debt</HD>

<AU>KENNETH R. HARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON--The second-largest source of home mortgage money in the
country, mega-investor Freddie Mac, has come up with a new credit
standard for judging loan applicants. Though it hasn't been made
public, the new standard--dubbed the "gap ratio"--offers a valuable
test for consumers nationwide who are anticipating buying a home or
applying for a mortgage.</LD>
<LD>   Already in use whenever loan applications are submitted to Freddie
Mac electronically for underwriting, the gap ratio measures your
household monthly debt load against your proposed home
mortgage-related debt load. If you've got too much revolving credit
card, auto or student loan debts in relation to your mortgage debts,
it shows up in your gap ratio.</LD>
<LD>   Here's how it works: The gap ratio is the difference between your
monthly debt-payment-to-income ratio and your monthly
housing-expense-to-income ratio. Freddie Mac's new standard suggests
that the "gap" between those two debt ratios generally should not
exceed 15 percentage points.</LD>
<TE>   Lenders already judge credit-worthiness in part based on how much
of your total monthly income you devote to servicing your debts.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s and 1980s, a common rule of thumb was that your
mortgage-related payments shouldn't eat up more than 25% of your
monthly household income. During the late 1980s and into the 1990s,
that rule began to stretch into the 31% to 33% range and sometimes
higher.</TE>
<TE>   What about the other common credit yardstick--your
monthly-income-to-total-household debt? That's your mortgage
payments, plus your credit card, auto and other monthly debt service
expenses.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1990s, acceptable ratios began creeping above 40%. Late in
the decade, even Freddie Mac confirmed that it no longer had hard and
fast rules on total monthly debt to monthly income ratios, and
lenders reported selling loans to Freddie with debt-to-income ratios
of 55% and higher.</TE>
<TE>   But now Freddie has revealed that it is looking carefully at how
much applicants' total debt ratios exceed their housing debt ratios,
as a key tip-off to potential future difficulties in handling new
credit.</TE>
<TE>   The new standard was articulated for the first time earlier this
month in technical guidance distributed to Freddie Mac lenders. The
guidance is to be used in so-called "manual" underwriting situations.</TE>
<TE>   The same guidance also contained a variety of other credit-related
standards that home loan applicants may be able to use to their
benefit.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Freddie Mac has long stressed its belief that
"layers" of risk are the keys to evaluating the likelihood of future
payment defaults by borrowers. That means that you might have
something negative in your application--a low credit score or a late
payment at a department store. But the presence of one bad mark on
your report card at application may be acceptable. The presence of
multiple factors--"layered" one on top of the other--is more ominous.</TE>
<TE>   In its new guidance to lenders, Freddie Mac spells out
risk-layering factors in three broad categories:</TE>
<TE>   * Credit. Freddie considers "high overall utilization of revolving
credit" an important factor. Its key internal test is whether you
have more than one credit line--such as credit cards--with more than
50% of the credit maximum utilized.</TE>
<TE>   * Capacity. This is your ability to manage the debts you're taking
on, and the key tests here are the new gap ratio, lack of cash
reserves and whether you are applying for a "cash-out" refinance.</TE>
<TE>   * Collateral. Freddie sees you as higher risk whenever you're
putting in a small down payment, seeking "maximum financing" or are
financing a two- to four-unit property, a condominium or a
manufactured home.</TE>
<TE>   Taken alone, none of these factors is a deal-killer. But when you
pile them up, you've got a problem. And you can pretty much count on
a higher rate quote, higher fees or worst of all, a rejection.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Built as a hunting lodge in 1909, Grayhall is one of the oldest homes
in Beverly Hills. It is also one of the most up-to-date, due to the
efforts of its most recent owner, the late Mark Hughes, founder and
chief executive of Herbalife.</LD>
<LD>   Hughes, who died at 44 in May 2000, not only meticulously
renovated the existing English-style home, but also bought three
adjacent properties to create a 2.5-acre compound.</LD>
<LD>   He razed two of the houses and built a sports court on the
park-like grounds, and he turned the third house into a large guest
house, with the front a mirror-image of the Grayhall facade.</LD>
<TE>   The estate is minuscule compared with the 50-acre site that
Grayhall occupied when it was built for Harry D. Lombard, godfather
of film star Carole Lombard.</TE>
<TE>   The Westside estate had been subdivided by the time Hughes bought
Grayhall in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   About this home: Silsby Spalding, the sporting goods magnate and
first mayor of Beverly Hills, bought Grayhall after Harry Lombard.
Spalding added on a ballroom in 1919.</TE>
<TE>   The same year, actor Douglas Fairbanks Sr. leased the house and
built a secret tunnel to oversee construction of what later became
Pickfair, his home with actress Mary Pickford.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the tunnel to Pickfair was sealed, the ballroom
was turned into a living room and the list of owners grew to include
actor George Hamilton and financier Bernie Cornfeld.</TE>
<TE>   Asking price: $29 million</TE>
<TE>   Size: Twelve bedrooms and 20 bathrooms in more than 22,000 square
feet on 2.5 acres</TE>
<TE>   Features: The main house has a master bedroom suite, four other
bedrooms and staff quarters. It has a subterranean garage for four to
six cars, a padded music room and a walk-in safe.</TE>
<TE>   The living room still has the original beamed and hand-painted
carved ceiling imported from a castle in Spain, but the orchestra
platform has been converted into a full bar.</TE>
<TE>   Three sets of French doors, each with the Grayhall insignia
embossed on the latches, open to rolling lawns and a large patio for
grand-scale entertaining.</TE>
<TE>   The formal dining room, originally a gun room, is octagonal with
carved and hand-painted ceilings and floors inlaid with marble and
wood. The family room has a marble fireplace, billiard table and
coffered ceiling.</TE>
<TE>   The master suite has silk-covered walls and ceilings, his and her
dressing alcoves, walk-in dressing rooms, marble baths and steam
showers. It also has a mini-kitchen, small patio and adjoining
office/study.</TE>
<TE>   The guest house has three bedrooms, a dining room, full kitchen,
breakfast area, maid's room and laundry. The patio has a cabana with
a kitchen, sitting area and full bath. Both the guest house and main
house have pools.</TE>
<TE>   The estate also has a gym, pool house and circular motor court,
with a three-tier fountain.</TE>

<HD>Values Stay Buoyant</HD>
<DH>Despite economic forecasts, Southland home sales held
strong in 2001, with first-time buyers the big winners. Low interest
rates made the difference.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALLISON B. COHEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite gloomy forecasts and the uncertain effects of Sept. 11 on the
economy, the Southern California real estate market remained strong
in 2001, while home values gained across the board, especially for
entry-level homes.</LD>
<LD>   Due in part to historically low mortgage interest rates, the
number of homes sold in Southern California increased 0.5% from
301,894 in 2000 to 303,425 in 2001, according to DataQuick
Information Systems, a La Jolla research firm. The median sales price
for a home in Southern California, according to DataQuick, increased
11.1% compared with $208,000 a year ago, to a year-end record high of
$231,000.</LD>
<LD>   Condos appreciated 12.7%, the DataQuick report indicated, and
new-home values were up 4.8%. Counties that fared well included
Ventura, which posted a sales gain of 11.4% for resales of existing
homes; San Bernardino, with a 13.2% gain in condo sales; and
Riverside, with a 37.6% increase in new home sales.</LD>
<TE>   Additionally, new building permits for single-family homes and
multifamily units were up 2.8% for the six-county region, with marked
gains of 23.5% in Riverside and 29.9% in San Bernardino counties, in
part because of their relatively low-priced housing stock and higher
percentage of entry-level homes.</TE>
<TE>   "I think analysts were overly pessimistic last year," said John
Karevoll, a DataQuick analyst. "It's real meat-and-potatoes activity.
People are moving to the area and looking for homes."</TE>
<TE>   While housing prices increased, mortgage interest rates declined
in 2001 thanks to an unprecedented lowering of the bank lending rate
11 times by the Federal Reserve. The lowest point for interest rates
was posted on Nov. 1 at 6.1%.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we are going back to the 1950s or 1960s" for mortgage
rates such as those in 2001, said Earl Peattie, president of Mortgage
News, a research company in Morro Bay, Calif. The result was a market
where first-time buyers could comfortably jump in--and they did.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, many new homeowners found mortgage payments lower
now than those dating back 10 to 12 years ago. According to the
DataQuick report, a typical mortgage payment on a median-priced
Southern California home with a 30-year fixed mortgage with 20% down
in 1989 was $1,271, compared with $1,178 in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Other good news for the entry-level market was the higher rate of
appreciation of homes in that price range, a reversal from previous
years when higher-end homes have seen more gain in value.</TE>
<TE>   While home values went up "from Pacific Palisades to
South-Central," Karevoll said, it was the entry-level price range
that appreciated the most. According to DataQuick, entry-level homes
ranging in price from $125,000 to $145,000 went up 14.4% in value
last year, while homes ranging from $410,000 to $430,000 increased
only 4.9%. And sales for the $1-million market varied in 2001,
Karevoll said, dropping significantly in the last quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "The slowdown in Southern California has been the high end," said
Leslie Appleton-Young, vice president and chief economist with the
California Assn. of Realtors. "Those homes have been impacted by the
fortunes of those that are invested in the [stock] market."</TE>
<TE>   Median home values in Littlerock--located about 50 miles northeast
of Los Angeles--increased the most in Los Angeles County, up 37%,
followed by Echo Park at 31.8% and Lancaster at 27.1%. Appreciation
was less dramatic in Orange County, with gains of 19.9% in Stanton,
18.7% in Santa Ana and 18.5% in Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the normal guy that really, really benefited as far as
home value going up," said Doug Perry with Countrywide Home Loans,
headquartered in Calabasas. According to Karevoll, these gains were
anticipated, as the entry-level market is now finally making its own
comeback from the recession of the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "First it was the move-up market, then the mid-market and now the
entry level" that has seen gains, he said. "Mid- and entry level are
seeing trends that were happening in the [higher-end homes] a few
years ago."</TE>
<TE>   The year was also record-breaking for the mortgage banking
industry, which saw unprecedented business in 2001--especially for
refinancing. According to DataQuick, refinancing applications
skyrocketed to 699,860 in 2001, compared with 254,171 in 2000--an
increase of 175%. The glut caused a backlog of paperwork, slowing new
escrows closing in the latter part of the fourth quarter of the year,
analysts said, even possibly deflating sales figures in November and
December.</TE>
<TE>   But the healthy showing of real estate, especially in the wake of
Sept. 11, has surprised many experts, who called the terrorist
attacks and the weeks of uncertainty that followed a postponement in
the real estate market, not a force that stopped it.</TE>
<TE>   "How strong the housing market has been despite Sept. 11--now,
that's the real story," Appleton-Young said.</TE>
<TE>   But while Realtors indicated most homes in escrow at the time of
the terrorist attacks eventually closed, Alison McCormick, a sales
associate with Strada Properties in Newport Beach, said that agents
in that region estimated about 25% of homes in escrow there fell out
in the aftermath of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "People were losing money in the stock market," she said. "Many of
them just backed out."</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the Palm Springs market, according to the California
Assn. of Realtors, was down 14% in sales compared with 2000, a
possible indication that homeowners may be putting off buying second
homes as they reel in discretionary spending in times of uncertainty.</TE>
<TE>   "Sept. 11 was the most catastrophic thing that has ever happened.
To have a 14% decline after that, that's not too bad," said Scott
Gerrie, a broker with Realty Executive in Palm Springs and the
current president of the California Desert Assn. of Realtors.</TE>
<TE>   But agents across the Southland, including Palm Springs and
Newport Beach, reported that the usually slower months of November
and December were hotter than ever--a trend that has continued into
January.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going nuts right now," Gerrie said. "Entry-level homes are
going like hotcakes."</TE>
<TE>   And tight inventory is spurring multiple offers on homes in the
$700,000 price range in West L.A. and Cheviot Hills, for example.</TE>
<TE>   "If you list a house in good condition today, it won't be on the
market by the end of the day," said Cecelia Waeschle, a broker with
Coldwell Banker Previews. "There's no end in sight."</TE>
<TE>   So what's in store for 2002?</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said home starts are expected to be flat or down slightly
in 2002, while home appreciation should decline about 2%, to about
9%. But experts predict the entry-level market will remain strong--in
spite of rising interest rates.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the Fed will start raising rates--perhaps as high as
7.25%," said Doug Duncan, chief economist with the Washington,
D.C.-based Mortgage Bankers Assn. of America. "And hey, those are
still pretty good rates."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Actor Christopher Lloyd, known for his roles in the movie "Back to
the Future" and the classic TV comedy series "Taxi," has put his
Hancock Park-area home of 20 years on the market at $729,000.</LD>
<LD>   Lloyd, who starred with Holland Taylor in a fall production of
"The Unexpected Man" at the Geffen Playhouse in Westwood, plans to
move out of the L.A. area.</LD>
<LD>   Built in the 1920s, the house has two bedrooms in just under 2,000
square feet plus a guest house.</LD>
<TE>   The home has been a "work in progress" for Lloyd and architect
Robert De Young for nearly as long as the actor has owned it. The two
have worked on the compound inside and out, planting rare and exotic
trees and plants in the yard and using coral, onyx, teak and
Brazilian woods in the interiors.</TE>
<TE>   They installed such art pieces as an undulating ceramic counter
said to resemble works of Spanish architect Antonio Gaudi, whose
style was characterized by freedom of form and a multitude of colors.
There is also a ceramic piece that runs up the wall and through four
skylights in the kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   The guest house, master suite and breakfast room have Spanish
colonial and adobe influences. The kitchen has been updated, and
there are five fireplaces, a solarium, a pool, a hot tub, a workshop
and a bonus room in the home.</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd, 63, has won several Emmy Awards, including two for his role
as a spaced-out, ex-hippie cabdriver on "Taxi" (1981-82 and 1982-83).
He played Doc Emmett Brown opposite Michael J. Fox's Marty McFly in
"Back to the Future" (1985), "Back to the Future II" (1989) and "Back
to the Future III" (1990). He also provided the voice of Doc Brown in
the animated CBS version of the movie (1991-93).</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd had a supporting role in the HBO adaptation of "Wit" (2001),
appeared as himself in the movie "Man on the Moon" (1999) and played
Uncle Martin in "My Favorite Martian" (1999), the film based on the
'60s sitcom.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Chadney, who specializes in distinctive and notable
properties at Prudential John Aaroe Real Estate in Hancock Park, has
the listing.</TE>
<TE>   David Spade, who plays assistant Dennis Finch on the NBC sitcom
"Just Shoot Me," has sold his six-bedroom, 5,300-square-foot Beverly
Hills home for $3.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   Spade, 37, listed the home in October. He purchased a larger
Westside home, with city views and a tennis court, for about $4
million in December.</TE>
<TE>   Built in the '60s but remodeled in 1995, the one-story house he
just sold is behind gates and has a library, four fireplaces and a
courtyard leading to an entry/galleria overlooking a garden and pool.</TE>
<TE>   Built in the '70s, the two-story house he bought has three
bedrooms in 6,700-plus square feet. His new home is also behind gates
and has a pool.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. King Jason Allison, who was acquired in an October trade with
the Boston Bruins, has purchased a newly built Tuscan-style home in
Manhattan Beach for $2.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   The house has five bedrooms and 4.5 bathrooms in about 4,500
square feet. It also has a large view deck. In addition to views of
the ocean and the Palos Verdes Peninsula, the house overlooks the
hills of Manhattan Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Norrie, who has built a number of homes in Manhattan Beach
and England, was the developer. The house had been listed at $2.9
million.</TE>
<TE>   Allison, who left the Boston Bruins after a bitter contract
holdout, is known as a fierce competitor. The all-star center, 26,
was the NHL's No. 5 scorer with 95 points last season, when he was
the Bruins' captain and their leading scorer in each of his last
three full seasons. He signed a three-year, $20-million contract with
the Kings that will pay him $5.5 million this season, $6.5 million
next season and $8 million in 2003-04.</TE>
<TE>   A native of North York, Canada, Allison was traded to the Kings
for former Bruins Glen Murray and Jozef Stumpel, who recently sold
his condo in Manhattan Village, a gated community.</TE>
<TE>   The builder of Allison's new home was represented in his sale by
the Parke Group of Shorewood Realtors, Manhattan Beach. The Parke
Group includes Patty and Reyn Parke and Steve Zukmann.</TE>
<TE>   Allison was represented in his purchase by Bryn Stroyke of Vintage
Realty.</TE>
<TE>   The longtime Encino home of the late songwriter-jazz pianist-actor
Bobby Troup and his late wife, singer-actress Julie London, has been
sold for close to its last asking price of $1.9 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Colonial-style home was designed for London in 1959 by the
late architect Paul Williams, who incorporated four 19th century
marble fireplaces into the design. London had purchased the
fireplaces in France.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald were among the many entertainers
who sang in the music room of the house.</TE>
<TE>   The six-bedroom, 5,800-square-foot home came on the market in July
at $2.2 million. Troup, who wrote the song "(Get Your Kicks on) Route
66," died in 1999 at 80; London, who popularized the song "Cry Me a
River," died in October 2000, at 74.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Manning of Prudential John Aaroe, Sherman Oaks, represented
the buyers, a Westside attorney and an international art curator.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Summers of Coldwell Banker Previews, Studio City, had
the listing.</TE>
<TE>   Producer Kaz Kuzui, president of Kuzui Enterprises--an independent
motion picture distribution company in Japan--and his
director-producer wife, Fran, have sold their home in Nichols Canyon
for $765,000.</TE>
<TE>   They rented an apartment in Santa Monica so they could more easily
split time between their homes in New York, Tokyo and Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The Nichols Canyon home has three bedrooms in 2,500 square feet.
Built in 1959, it has a Zen-like simplicity in its post-and-beam and
open floor plan design. French doors open to a pool area surrounded
by a wooden deck.</TE>
<TE>   Kaz Kuzui is an executive producer of the TV series "Buffy the
Vampire Slayer" and its spinoff "Angel." Fran Kuzui, who has
participated with her husband in introducing independent films to
Japanese audiences, directed the movie "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"
(1992), which her husband produced.</TE>
<TE>   Victor Kaminoff, director of architectural and unique properties
for Coldwell Banker's Sunset Strip office, and David Gordon, of the
same office, represented the Kuzuis in selling their Nichols Canyon
home.</TE>
<TE>   A five-bedroom home that was a wedding gift from film industry
pioneer Cecil B. DeMille in the '40s to his daughter, Cecilia, when
she married Joseph Harper of the Harper publishing empire, has been
listed at just under $1.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   The house, in the gated Los Feliz community Laughlin Park, is on
the market for the first time in more than 24 years.</TE>
<TE>   The legendary director had the house built for his daughter at the
foot of his own rose garden in 1946 and hired the most talented
craftsmen to do the woodwork. Cecilia DeMille often entertained her
father's film friends, such as Charlie Chaplin, in her home, known
casually as "the big red barn."</TE>
<TE>   After her husband died, Cecilia DeMille sold the house to actor
Ben Alexander, Jack Webb's partner on the TV series "Dragnet" (1952
to 1970). The house was subsequently sold to its current owners, Dr.
Harry Campbell and his wife, Sandy. He is a physician at Kaiser, and
she is a retired teacher. They plan to downsize now that their family
is grown.</TE>
<TE>   The 3,000-square-foot-plus home has 4.5 bathrooms, a butler's
pantry with leaded glass cabinetry, a breakfast room and an updated
kitchen. One of the bedrooms is a maid's quarters; another is a
library with its own bathroom. The master suite has his-and-hers
dressing rooms.</TE>
<TE>   The U-shaped house has a central courtyard, where Cecilia DeMille
held many garden parties. There is also a funicular from the garage
to the main living area.</TE>
<TE>   Rosemary Low at DBL Realtors, Los Feliz, has the listing.</TE>

<AU>ROBERT J. BRUSS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On May 1, 2000, Christopher and Laura purchased a homeowner's
insurance policy from Allstate Insurance Co. for their residence.
Five days later, their home suffered extensive fire damage.</LD>
<LD>   The day after the fire, Christopher and Laura filed a claim with
Allstate. According to Allstate, the cause of the fire is "unknown."
An arson investigator for the local sheriff's office found no
accidental cause for the fire. Neither did he find proof of arson.</LD>
<LD>   Allstate was still investigating the fire's cause when Christopher
and Laura filed a lawsuit against Allstate for breach of duty of fair
dealing and good faith, fraud and declaratory relief.</LD>
<TE>   Christopher and Laura argued that Allstate's insurance policy
fraudulently stated, "You're in good hands with Allstate." But
Allstate replied that the insured party failed to allege fraud with
particularity, such as time and place of the alleged
misrepresentation.</TE>
<TE>   If you were the judge, would you rule Allstate fraudulently
breached its advertising slogan, "You're in good hands with
Allstate," by failing to pay this claim?</TE>
<TE>   The judge said no.</TE>
<TE>   To prove fraud, the judge began, the plaintiff must establish 1) a
knowingly false representation by the defendant, 2) made with intent
to deceive or induce reliance by the plaintiff, 3) justifiable
reliance by the plaintiff, and 4) resulting damages.</TE>
<TE>   As for advertising slogans, the judge continued, "Representations
of opinion are ordinarily not actionable for fraud because they
contain judgments of quality, value, authenticity or other matters of
judgment.</TE>
<TE>   "Sales talk and advertising slogans are examples of such
nonactionable statements. They are loose general statements made by
sellers in commending their wares and upon which no reasonable man
would rely," he emphasized.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher and Laura have failed to prove the fire was accidental
or due to a non-arson cause, the judge commented. Neither has
Allstate proven the cause was arson, he noted.</TE>
<TE>   Because Christopher and Laura failed to prove fraud by insurer
Allstate and since the "You're in good hands with Allstate"
advertising slogan is just an opinion, this case is dismissed for
failure to prove specific fraudulent acts, the judge ruled.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the 2001 U.S. District Court decision in Smith vs.
Allstate Insurance Co., 160 Fed.Supp.2d 1150.</TE>

<HD>Restoring Rainbow House, a Home With Colorful Past</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Regarding Home of the Week by Ruth Ryon, Jan. 6:</LD>
<LD>   I was the fifth owner of the Garcia House, which picked up the
name Rainbow House from a realty agent who listed the house in the
late '60s.</LD>
<LD>   When I bought the house in 1986, it was in substantial disrepair,
and I contracted with John Lautner to renovate the structure and
bring it back to its original concept.</LD>
<TE>   The floor plan, when I bought it, bore no resemblance to the
original floor plan as illustrated on the blueprints. However,
Lautner was of the opinion that the "original" plan was never
implemented anyway, but he could no longer recall how it had changed.</TE>
<TE>   Irrespective, with Lautner's blessings and design, I completely
remodeled the interior, removing and reorienting bearing walls and
creating the interior as it exists today.</TE>
<TE>   When I bought the home it was painted inside and out a sea-foam
green. Lautner said he detested the color but remarked that he
detested the original color chosen by the Garcias even more; a
"morbid battleship gray" was his recollection. The color of the house
today was picked by Lautner, who said it was his original choice. He
was attempting to get a color as close to concrete as he could.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Lautner waxed enthusiastically about his concept for the
property. The idea, he said, was to create a space on Mulholland
Drive in which one could drive by and see through the property,
including the house, into the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   To accomplish that, he insisted that Garcia buy three contiguous
lots. He built on the middle one. The second buyer sold off the
western lot, leaving the property today with the two easternmost
lots. It was thought the western lot was unbuildable, but Lautner
warned that should a house ever be built there, the aesthetic would
be lost and I might as well move.</TE>
<TE>   Sure enough, a house did get built there.... As one might imagine,
Lautner was absolutely prescient. I took the sage's advice and moved.</TE>

<LD>"Canceling a Sale Is Rarely Easy" by Robert J. Bruss, Jan. 13,
oversimplified some important facts: " ... if the purchase offer
accepted by the seller includes a contingency for the buyer's
approval of a professional home inspection report and if that report
reveals serious defects the seller didn't disclose, the buyer can
cancel the sale and get his earnest money deposit refunded."</LD>
<LD>   As the title of the article stated, it is in fact not that easy
for the buyer to cancel the sale and have his deposit refunded. The
contract states that after the buyer reviews the inspection report he
must either approve it and thereby remove the contingency, or he must
provide the seller with a reasonable written request for repairs.</LD>
<LD>   If the seller agrees to make the repairs, then both parties are in
agreement and the transaction proceeds. If, however, the seller
refuses to make all or some of the repairs the buyer can cancel the
sale and receive a refund for his deposit.</LD>

<HD>Check Water Flow if Toilet Malfunctions</HD>

<AU>MORRIS CAREY and JAMES CAREY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If your toilet is not flushing properly, you might think it's low
water pressure that's causing the problem. But pressure has nothing
to do with it.</LD>
<LD>   The water in the tank does the job. It fills the bowl and starts
the flush-and-siphon action, and the p-trap below completes it.
Gravity starts a flush, and natural siphoning draws it through.</LD>
<LD>   When a toilet doesn't work right, something is inhibiting water
flow. Maybe a line is blocked; or water ports under the rim are
clogged; or the tank is not full enough. If it's low, adjust it by
raising the float. Then try cleaning the water ports using white
vinegar and a coat hanger. If that doesn't do it, call in a sewer and
drain specialist.</LD>

<HD>Morning Runs Open Eyes to China's Fading World</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Mike Meyer's article "Going Underground in Beijing" (Jan. 6) caught
my eye. I visit Beijing frequently on business, but I have never
taken the time to see the Underground City and labyrinthine tunnels.
I'll make a point of exploring this part of the city on my next trip.</LD>
<LD>   Wherever I travel, I run for exercise and to see a city. Beijing
is one of my favorite cities in the world in which to run.</LD>
<LD>   I rise around dawn, when the city is surprisingly quiet and free
of the bustle of humanity and bicycles.</LD>
<TE>   I plod along into awakeness, winding down alleys so narrow that a
single car can barely pass. It is in these scattered villages where
my senses experience the city slowly coming alive.</TE>
<TE>   At every corner, open air egg-and-who-knows-what-else breakfast is
cooked in woks on small coal-heated stoves for passers-by. The aromas
are incredible.</TE>
<TE>   When I complete my run, I return to my hotel and gaze down at the
villages that are slowly disappearing from the Beijing horizon,
replaced by high-rise office buildings and malls. It is always sad to
see modernization displace history.</TE>
<TE>   I suppose I must take solace that I have been graced with these
treasured experiences, knowing that I may have to run a bit farther
to find another on my next trip.</TE>
<TE>   KEN KHTIAN</TE>
<TE>   La Canada</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   My husband, Ernie, and I were in Beijing in October 1984 and also
visited the Underground City. It was quite different from Mike
Meyer's visit.</TE>
<TE>   Our visit to the Underground City started by descending some
hidden stairs under the floor behind a counter in a department store.
According to what we were told, every citizen in Beijing knew exactly
where the many entrances were.</TE>
<TE>   We found a fully operational city to be used in case of an attack
on Beijing. It was amazing how large the Underground City was and the
thousands of people who were expected to live there for as long as
necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Every citizen had a preassigned job, regardless of profession.
There was a wonderful reception area where we were taken for tea,
shown a map of the Underground City and given a report on how
everyone would live. There were schools, activities, shops. We
purchased a lovely painting, which we treasure.</TE>
<TE>   Meyer's article makes it sound as though the Underground City has
fallen into disrepair. Perhaps the Chinese think it will never be
necessary to use it. China has changed a lot over these past years.
This may be the reason for the change in the Underground City.</TE>

<LD>I thoroughly enjoyed the article "Camera Ready Inside Joshua Tree"
(Weekend Escape, Jan. 13).</LD>
<LD>   As a graduate student at UC Irvine in the late '70s and early in
1998, I spent winter vacations in Joshua Tree.</LD>
<LD>   All my photos remind me of a totally alien landscape, almost
prehistoric. The isolation of the campsites was something right out
of Stephen King: the cold morning silence with not a breath of wind;
weird rock formations; twisted and aged metal and wood in the most
ungodly places; palm and Joshua trees; cactus; the occasional beer
bash. It felt like an alien vacation paradise.</LD>

<LD>Please do not pay any attention to Eleanore D. Griffith's negative
comments on Christopher Reynolds' experience and intelligence ("High
Culture and Cuisine at Oxford," Letters, Jan. 20).</LD>
<LD>   I am delighted every time I read his articles and find him to be
curious, observant and articulate. His approach to his work is
refreshing.</LD>

<TE>   After reading Eleanore Griffith's letter lambasting Christopher
Reynolds' article on "his" Oxford experience, I wondered just what
kind of person could write a letter like that.</TE>
<TE>   Lo and behold, there was a picture just to the right of the
Letters column that was submitted by Marshall Hope. Just briefly, I
resisted the urge to compare Griffith to the shot of the ostrich ...
supercilious and nose up so far in the air. I lost my composure and
had a good laugh.</TE>
<TE>   Remember, Ms. Griffith, it was Reynolds' experience, not what you
wanted him to write or how you experienced it. Lighten up, please.</TE>

<LD>"On the Trail of Knights of Old," Jan. 13, was an interesting choice
to run in light of recent world events.</LD>

preaching the Second Crusade, promising eternal salvation in return
for regaining Jerusalem from the Muslims, thrusting his crucifix like
an avenging sword toward heaven.</LD>

the "Atlantic Ocean." What about a map?</LD>

in Afghanistan, where the fires are raging in Australia, where
refugees are coming from as they land on Christmas Island, where a

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's one of the great anomalies of travel that a strong U.S. dollar
sometimes makes it cheaper to buy an air-and-ski package to the Alps
than to the Rockies. After decades of sky-high rates for winter
vacations to Switzerland, Bavaria, France and Italy, the situation
has reversed itself, and American skiers can enjoy a low-cost schuss
in some of Europe's legendary mountain resorts.</LD>
<LD>   Several popularly priced tour operations are especially active in
offering bargain ski vacations to these transatlantic locations
during the next three months:</LD>
<LD>   * Go-Today Travel, a surprising source for an upscale sport. Best
known for its rock-bottom-price air-and-hotel programs to Europe's
capitals, it has expanded into resort locations, including glamorous
places you wouldn't usually expect to find in the inventory of this
budget-oriented company.</LD>
<TE>   A six-night package to the powder paradise of Chamonix, France,
starts at $979 per person, double occupancy, including air fare from
the West Coast and a seven-day car rental. Singles rates for the same
package are $200 more. Lodging for six nights is at the Gustavia, a
traditional three-star hotel downtown, not far from the lifts at the
base of Mont Blanc.</TE>
<TE>   You can obtain the prices from other U.S. cities and make
reservations by logging on to www.go-today.com or by calling (800)
234-5245. (Phone bookings incur an extra $10 charge.)</TE>
<TE>   * Untours is another travel company that often focuses on simple
stay-put vacations in standard cities. But Untours also arranges
apartment stays in smaller towns. One unusual option is a 14-night
stay at 14th century Sommersdorf Castle in Germany, a good base for
travelers who want to combine light winter sports with visits to the
charming villages of the Romantic Road (Dinkelsbuhl and Rothenburg)
and cities like Nuremberg, Regensburg, Augsburg and Munich.</TE>
<TE>   Though downhill skiing options are limited here, the local village
of Treuchlingen maintains free cross-country ski trails within easy
reach of the castle. Including air fare from Los Angeles and car
rental, the package is $1,549 per person.</TE>
<TE>   Learn more by phoning (888) 868-6871 or at
www.untours.com/untours/germany-castle.asp.</TE>
<TE>   * DER Travel offers several inexpensive packages to alpine areas
of southern Germany but often quotes them on a "land-only" basis,
leaving the job of obtaining air fares up to you. Thus, seven-night
stays without air fare start at $299 per person, double occupancy, in
Garmisch-Partenkirchen, a premier ski resort in Bavaria and a
previous host of the Winter Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   All you will need is to get yourself to nearby Munich, which isn't
expensive if you call the various carriers flying to Germany and
inquire about their sales. A transfer from Munich to your hotel
(figure 90 minutes by train) is included, as is your choice of
accommodations, each a short walk from a free bus that will take you
to the ski lifts.</TE>
<TE>   Packages begin in Munich on Saturdays through mid-April. Lift
tickets are not included in the DER rate, but they are far less
expensive than at many resorts in North America. Because a six-day
adult ski pass costs about $134, the total cost of your hotel,
transfers from Munich and access to the slopes can be less than $500.</TE>
<TE>   For more information, log on to www.der.com or call (800)
782-2424.</TE>
<TE>   * Les Arcs in France is a world-class resort that enjoys a
mile-long vertical drop on a par with North American champ Whistler
in British Columbia, Canada. That's about 1,000 feet more than that
of the U.S.'s best, Jackson Hole, Wyo., and Big Sky, Mont. It takes
some skiers considerable time to make the run from top to bottom, and
you can ski all week and still not see everything on all the
connected peaks.</TE>
<TE>   While rates for most rooms can be pricey, a last-minute package
(valid as of Jan. 26) available to a group of five sharing a studio
flat can bring rates down to $215 per person for the week, including
a lift pass for six days.</TE>
<TE>   The resort does not have a North American office or booking
system, so you'll need to visit the Web site www.lesarcs.com or
e-mail reservation@lesarcs.com.</TE>

<HD>Frequent-Flier Blackout Dates Go Dark on Northwest</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Northwest Airlines is eliminating a major source of complaints from
frequent fliers: blackout dates for award travel. It claims to be the
first U.S. airline to do so.</LD>
<LD>   Airlines traditionally bar frequent fliers from booking award
travel on holidays and at other peak travel periods. Northwest says
it will drop that ban for award flights booked after March 1. Last
year, its blackout dates included 12 in the U.S. plus all summer
weekends between the U.S. and Europe, said spokesman Kurt Ebenhoch.</LD>
<LD>   The end of the ban, however, doesn't mean a guaranteed seat
around, say, Thanksgiving. Airlines usually set aside only a
percentage of their seats for frequent fliers. Northwest said that
only a "limited inventory" of such seats will be available for peak
days and destinations.</LD>
<TE>   Stephen Usery, vice president of marketing for competitor US
Airways, accused Northwest of creating "false expectations" because
"you have the same number of people competing for the seats." US
Airways waives blackout dates only for frequent fliers who log at
least 25,000 miles or 25 segments per year under the program.</TE>
<TE>   Although a couple of airlines waive blackout dates for their
highest-mileage customers, Northwest is the first U.S. airline to
waive them for all frequent fliers, said Randy Petersen, founder of
Inside Flyer magazine and an expert in the field. He added that in
recent years airlines have been gradually cutting back on blackout
dates and that it is likely other airlines will follow Northwest's
lead.</TE>

<HD>National Park Campsites Again Available Online</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Park-goers once again can reserve campsites online after Internet
access was restored following a shutdown of more than a month.</LD>
<LD>   The site, reservations.nps.gov, had been blocked in early December
because of a court dispute involving the Department of the Interior,
which runs the National Park Service. A federal judge in the case,
citing concerns about data security, ordered all the department's
Internet access shut down. The case involved the department's alleged
mismanagement of a trust fund that processes mining and other
royalties from Indian lands. On Jan. 9 the park service was allowed
to renew access to its reservations site.</LD>
<LD>   The main National Park Service site, www.nps.gov, was still shut
down as of last Tuesday, except for a note on its home page that
referred visitors to the reservations site. Campsites can also be

<HD>Airlines Tighten Rules to Aid Baggage Screening</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Several airlines this month tightened rules on check-in times,
luggage and connecting flights to cope with new baggage-screening
procedures that went into effect Jan. 18.</LD>
<LD>   Delta Air Lines will no longer accept checked baggage at ticket
counters or curbside less than 30 minutes before flight time.
Passengers with checked baggage who plan to fly standby must announce
their intention at check-in, Delta said.</LD>
<LD>   Continental Airlines requires fliers to check in at the gate at
least 15 minutes before their flight, even if they checked in
previously, or possibly lose their seat.</LD>
<TE>   United Airlines advises customers to arrive at the airport at
least 90 minutes before domestic flights and two hours before
international flights. If they decide at the last minute not to take
a flight, the airline said, "it's imperative to notify a customer
service representative immediately."</TE>
<TE>   The new federal rules, devised by Congress in response to the
Sept. 11 attacks, require airlines to screen checked luggage for
explosives using machines, bomb-sniffing dogs or hand searches. As an
alternative, the airlines can implement procedures to ensure that no
bag is loaded on a flight unless the passenger also boards.
Connecting flights are exempt.</TE>

<LD>Holland America is banning smoking in all its ships' dining areas. It
plans to phase in the ban starting Friday and finish by mid-February,
except for the Amsterdam, where the ban will be enforced after it
returns from a world cruise April 30. All ships will continue to
allow smoking in designated areas onboard.... Nearly 70 museums,
zoos, performing arts centers and other attractions in New York City
are offering their annual "Insider's Hour" tours through March 31.
These are special one-hour tours. Entrance fees and hours vary. For
information, visit www.nycvisit.com or stop by the city's visitor

<LD>Florida goes Vegas this week with the opening of two behemoth hotels
linked to convention centers and replete with lagoons and fantasy
landscapes.</LD>
<LD>   The $450-million Gaylord Palms Resort &amp; Convention Center sprawls
across 63 acres in Kissimmee, south of Orlando and about five minutes
from Walt Disney World Resort. It has more than 1,400 guest rooms.
Its centerpiece is an atrium built with 4,700 panes of glass over a
tropical landscape of orange groves, a mini-swamp, a lagoon, a
fountain and a replica of a 16th century Spanish fort. The hotel is
attached to a convention center with a 178,000-square-foot exhibition
hall and three ballrooms. Other facilities include a spa run by
Canyon Ranch, longtime operators of spa resorts in Arizona and
Massachusetts; two swimming pools; several restaurants and lounges; a
child-care center; and a dozen specialty stores.</LD>
<LD>   The complex was built by Nashville-based Gaylord Entertainment
Co., which among its many interests owns the Grand Ole Opry House in
Nashville and the radio station that broadcasts its music. The hotel,
opened to guests earlier this month, has its grand opening Saturday.
Rates are $250 to $450 per night. (407) 586-2000,
www.gaylordhotels.com.</LD>
<TE>   Farther south the Westin Diplomat Resort &amp; Spa is to open Thursday
on the Intracoastal Waterway in Hollywood, about seven miles from the
Fort Lauderdale airport. The hotel has 1,000 rooms and a five-story
atrium lobby with palm trees and water cascades. Outdoors is a lagoon
pool with waterfalls and cabanas wired with phone and Internet
access.</TE>
<TE>   A breezeway links the hotel to a convention center about half the
size of Gaylord's that has a 50,000-square-foot exhibition hall.
Across the street, Diplomat Landing, a shopping, restaurant and
entertainment complex, is to open later this year. Together they are
designed to create a "mini-village," a spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   Hotel guests can also be ferried by water taxi to the nearby
Diplomat Country Club, which has an 18-hole course, 10 tennis courts,
a pool and a 30,000-square-foot spa. Room rates start at $289. (800)

<HD>18% of Americans Tense About Travel, Poll Finds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Still nervous about traveling? You have company. Nearly one out of
five travelers said their plans for leisure travel continue to be
affected by the Sept. 11 attacks, according to a survey this month by
Yesawich, Pepperdine &amp; Brown, a marketing and public relations firm
that conducts regular travel surveys.</LD>
<LD>   The 18% figure for the survey, taken the week of Jan. 14, is a big
drop from the Sept. 12 figure of 37% but only a modest fall from
October (27%) and November (22%) figures.</LD>
<LD>   "Travel intentions are clearly improving, but many Americans
remain anxious about hitting the road again," said Peter Yesawich,
the company's president and chief executive. Or should we say taking
to the skies? The same survey showed that the top concern cited by
reluctant travelers was air safety: 45%, up from 23% in November.
(Jan. 14 was also the week in which Richard C. Reid was indicted for
allegedly trying to ignite a bomb in his shoe on a plane.)</LD>

<HD>Living Luxe Vegas, for Less</HD>
<DH>Freebies and a low-cost luxury resort trump the usual Strip
spending spree.</DH>

<DL>HENDERSON, Nev.</DL>
<LD>Marc glanced at his wristwatch and beamed. "Do you realize we've been
in Las Vegas 11 hours and I haven't dropped anything into a slot
machine yet?"</LD>
<LD>   We were here earlier this month to indulge but not to overdo. And
that meant cutting back in certain areas, like taking chances, to
spend more in others--like resort-style pampering. So noon on a
Saturday found us at the Strip, our pockets locked tight, our sights
set on our favorite four-letter word: free.</LD>
<LD>   We had spent the night at the Green Valley Ranch, a $300-million
luxury-for-less resort that opened in December. Station Casinos'
201-room hotel, casino, spa, two bars and six restaurants--including
Gustav Mauler's Bullshrimp and Susan Feniger's and Mary Sue
Milliken's Border Grill--sit seven miles from the Strip.</LD>
<TE>   All the standard rooms like the one we reserved on the Internet
were occupied by the time we arrived on Friday, so the desk clerk
checked us into a "petite suite" for the same price, $99 a night plus
tax and an energy fee.</TE>
<TE>   We dragged our tired selves past the noisy, smoky Whiskey Sky--the
bar in which Cindy Crawford's mister, Rande Gerber, is a partner--and
up to a fourth-floor room with French doors opening onto a tiled
balcony. For a flash, the taller-than-average entertainment armoire,
floral carpet and 10-foot ceiling reminded me of a room I once had in
Geneva. We felt sure our luck was just beginning.</TE>
<TE>   But maybe that luck wouldn't rub off on a slot machine. So we
decided to save it and go for all that is gratis on the Strip. For
starters, we parked in the free garage behind the Aladdin.</TE>
<TE>   We wound through Desert Passage, a mall attached to the Aladdin
casino, and popped out on Las Vegas Boulevard. From there we went a
long block north to the Flamingo Hilton, nodding along the way to the
Eiffel Tower at Paris.</TE>
<TE>   The Flamingo promised free ogling of wildlife. Sure enough, in the
central courtyard we found a spectacularly multihued pheasant, a
little African penguin, ducks, a turtle, a goose, orange-and-white
koi and 12 pink Chilean flamingos. This was nature as Las Vegas
intended: cement ponds, fake streams and tropical landscaping
traversed by tourist paths.</TE>
<TE>   The '70s lived up the street at the Carnaval Court, Harrah's
outdoor bar. A band called Love Train blasted "Disco Inferno," the
four musicians hidden under sunglasses and Afro wigs. "Oh, man," Marc
said blissfully, "this is great!" I thought he meant the music, but I
followed his eyes to a bartender juggling bottles.</TE>
<TE>   Two doors up we found the Venetian. In the Grand Canal Shoppes
area, tourists took turns posing for photos with a boring, life-size
wax Luciano Pavarotti. We hadn't yet come to the living statue, a man
wearing white makeup and wrapped in white cloth to resemble a
Renaissance cleric. The crowd stood four deep around him. We watched
closely. Aha! He blinked.</TE>
<TE>   At the Mirage, the advertised white "tigers" turned out to be one
big male, a protege of Siegfried and Roy in a white enclosure with a
pool and a glass viewing wall. Each pace, jump, wade, lick, lap and
sniff elicited oohs and aahs.</TE>
<TE>   Our feet ached. We hobbled back to Desert Passage at the Aladdin,
pausing along the route to the garage to watch acrobats form human
pyramids and towers.</TE>
<TE>   Back at Green Valley Ranch, Marc filled the tub in our mammoth
bathroom and fired up the whirlpool jets. After my turn in the tub,
we dolled up for dinner.</TE>
<TE>   A word from the unwise: Make reservations before arriving in town.
There was a four-hour wait to get into Bullshrimp, the
steak-and-seafood restaurant opened by Mauler, the former Mirage
Resorts food director. Il Fornaio, part of the upscale Italian chain,
and the Border Grill, an offshoot of the Santa Monica original, were
packed too. We had tried the buffet at Feast Around the World for
brunch, and the Original Pancake House wasn't our style for a Las
Vegas supper. Fado, an Irish pub and restaurant, opens next month. We
wound up in Trophy's, part of the sports- restaurant chain.</TE>
<TE>   Trophy's and the Feast still had new-restaurant issues to work
out. At Trophy's my salmon was done to perfection, but Marc's Havana
chicken was cold and served with only three thin slices of fried
plantain, plus rice and beans. At Feast, dishes on the steam table
were past their prime--though nobody could go wrong with
made-to-order omelets, a fresh-fruit bar and display cases of
beautiful pastries.</TE>
<TE>   After dinner, we assessed our feet. Maybe, we said, we'll drop by
the Whiskey Sky. Earlier in the day, we had peeked into the bar. It's
furnished much like a living room, with a few cushy-looking seats
around the edges and a pile of floor pillows heaped on a jumbo
hassock in the middle. With a view of the pool and the Strip, it
feels casual yet urban. But it is a standing person's bar, and soon
we were back in our room, where the pillows looked mighty inviting.</TE>
<TE>   We shelved plans for a free night out. No pirate battle at
Treasure Island, no volcanic eruption at the Mirage, no dragon fight
at Excalibur, no dueling pianists at New York-New York. No masquerade
parade at the Rio, no Fremont Street Experience light show, not even
a free key ring or deck of cards from the Lady Luck. Instead, zzzzz.
With a long week behind us and a lovely room before us, we treated
ourselves to a little relaxation.</TE>
<TE>   At 6:45 a.m., Kenny G awakened me. His recording of "Stranger on
the Shore," coming from loudspeakers in the parking lot, wafted over
the balcony's balusters and tapped gently at the French door.</TE>
<TE>   The previous afternoon I had made reservations at the resort's
Dolphin Court Salon &amp; Day Spa for a Swedish massage for both of us
and a "citrus salt glow" for me. As Marc and I walked to the spa, we
tested the facilities: jumping onto the mattress of one of the
sheltered outdoor daybeds; poking our noses into the 12 poolside
cabanas to see couches, TVs and VCRs; inspecting a gas-powered
campfire area; leaving footprints across the carefully raked sand
beach at one end of the pool to dip a finger in the heated water.</TE>
<TE>   The spa is in a small building next to the pool. After a short
wait in rattan lounges by the whirlpool--bathing suits required--a
masseur led Marc away, and I went for my salt glow treatment.</TE>
<TE>   As I waited to be rubbed all over with a paste of salt and
grapefruit essence, I wondered what that might taste like on a pork
roast. The salt stung, but its roughness felt invigorating. After
several minutes of gentle rinsing, I was as relaxed as a well-done
noodle.</TE>
<TE>   The massage, done in another room, started with lying on a
hot-water bag to loosen back muscles. Neck, shoulders, arms, fingers.
I looked at water from the lap pool dancing above the translucent
ceiling. Legs, feet, toes. The New Age music was putting me to sleep.</TE>
<TE>   When it was finished, I couldn't think of a single worry. On the
way back to the room, I stopped at the casino. The 80,000-square-foot
room with flagstone pillars was far from crowded, so I had my pick of
25-cent slot machines. It's a quiet room, too, because most of the
machines are the ticket-paying kind; winners cashing out get tickets
to exchange for money at the cashier's window.</TE>
<TE>   I chose a Double Diamond, put in a dollar a friend had given me to
play, and promptly lost four times. I fed the machine another dollar
and it ate 25 cents. Poker, I thought while pushing the "spin"
button, might have better odds.</TE>
<TE>   Bells went off. The machine began making ping-ping noises, the
electronic version of coins hitting the pan. When it was finished, I
cashed my ticket for $40.75. It will probably be the best return all
year on a $1.50 investment.</TE>
<TE>   Marc and I checked out and, like moths to a flame, headed back to
the Strip. This time we parked for free behind New York-New York. It
was 1 p.m., hours before the pianists would begin dueling in the
Times Square Bar, so we walked outside to Las Vegas Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Reality rarely dances among the lights on the Strip. This makes
more striking the corner of Tropicana Avenue and Las Vegas
Boulevard--the corner of New York-New York with its Statue of Liberty
flanked by two fireboats.</TE>
<TE>   On the iron fence rounding this corner, visitors have placed
ribbons, photos and T-shirts from firefighting companies as far away
as Japan to remember the World Trade Center tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   We paused, then hustled up the street to the Bellagio's dancing
fountain. Every half-hour, loudspeakers come to life for one song,
and so does the oversize pond in front of the hotel-casino. Hundreds
of water jets twist and spout in a kind of chorus line; the music
varies from "The Star-Spangled Banner" to "Luck Be a Lady."</TE>
<TE>   The show put Marc in the mood to find a Frank Sinatra slot machine
in New York-New York. He settled in at a $1 machine while I found
another Double Diamond across the aisle. In a blink, he ran through
$10. I heard him sigh.</TE>
<TE>   Then I heard plunk-plunk-plunk. After 39 hours of resisting the
temptation to drop a coin, he had hit for $30.</TE>

<LD>Two weeks after returning to Southern California from Africa, a
professor came down with a fever--and high anxiety. He called the
travel medicine doctor he had seen before his trip and asked for an
appointment. "I wasn't good about taking my malaria medicine," he
confessed.</LD>
<LD>   While many travelers have learned to check in with their physician
or a travel medicine clinic about immunizations and other
precautions, not all may be aware that the post-trip period can bring
its share of unpleasant health surprises. Some diseases don't show up
until after the trip is over.</LD>
<LD>   Experts aren't recommending a routine post-trip stop at the
doctor's office for short-term travelers--those who have been
overseas for three months or less and who return feeling fine.</LD>
<TE>   But it does make sense, they say, for returning travelers to learn
what to watch out for so they can nip any travel-related ailments in
the early stages.</TE>
<TE>   Fever is one of the common warning signs that returning travelers
should take note of, especially if they have been to areas where
malaria is present, says Dr. Brian G. Terry, the Pasadena travel
medicine specialist who took care of the professor (more about him
later). An elevated temperature can be a symptom of malaria, dengue
fever and other illnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Fever of 100 degrees or more in a returning traveler from an area
in which malaria is endemic should be considered an emergency until
the disease is ruled out, says Dr. J.D. MacLean, director of the
McGill University Centre for Tropical Diseases in Montreal. The
diagnosis, based on a blood test, can take as little as 15 minutes,
he says.</TE>
<TE>   Even if you have taken your antimalarial pills faithfully, see a
doctor if you develop a fever after your return, Terry advises,
because "they are not 100% effective." Signs of malaria, which can
include flu-like symptoms such as chills and headache, can begin as
early as six days after exposure or as much as several months later,
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Several
drugs and drug combinations are effective in treating the disease.</TE>
<TE>   Dengue fever, a viral disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes,
should also be ruled out in patients with a fever who have been to an
affected area within the previous three weeks, the CDC advises. There
is no specific treatment for dengue fever, according to the CDC, and
most patients recover on their own. (A rarer form, dengue hemorrhagic
fever, is more severe and sometimes fatal.)</TE>
<TE>   Intestinal symptoms such as diarrhea also bear watching, MacLean
says. Simple traveler's diarrhea, usually caused by E. coli  or other
common microorganisms, usually clears up in three to seven days. But
intestinal problems can be symptoms of other infections, such as
giardiasis, MacLean says. These can hang on longer and should be
treated with an anti- microbial drug.</TE>
<TE>   When to see a doctor? If your intestinal problems are accompanied
by severe abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea or fever, or if you get
dizzy on standing up (which can indicate dehydration), you need
medical help, MacLean says.</TE>
<TE>   Skin lesions can also signal trouble. Travelers may have
contracted hookworm, which can enter through a tiny break in the skin
(typically in a person walking barefoot), sometimes causing itching
and rash at the point of entry. Some hookworms can be transported in
the bloodstream to the lungs, then coughed up, swallowed and sent to
the intestines. They can live there for years, each producing up to
25,000 eggs per day, Terry says. The infestation, which may produce
anemia, abdominal pain, diarrhea and loss of appetite--or no symptoms
at all--can be treated with medication.</TE>
<TE>   Another illness that can produce skin lesions is leishmaniasis, a
parasitic disease transmitted by the bite of sand flies. It occurs in
tropical and subtropical climates, most often in rural areas. In its
skin form, the disease is marked by sores that can develop weeks to
months after a bite from an infected fly, according to the CDC. The
visceral form, which attacks internal organs, can take months or even
years to become evident, with symptoms such as spleen and liver
enlargement and fever. Drug treatment is the therapy of choice.</TE>
<TE>   "Any skin lesion that lasts more than three weeks should be looked
at," MacLean says.</TE>
<TE>   Besides paying attention to fever, intestinal problems and skin
symptoms, returning travelers may become anxious about health risks
if they haven't followed preventive advice, Terry says. These are the
patients he refers to as "oops" people: "They say, 'Oops, I didn't
take my malaria medicine very well.' 'Oops, I had unprotected sex.'"</TE>
<TE>   Some want to be tested even though they don't have symptoms.
Depending on their exposures and behavior, Terry says, he may screen
to rule out specific problems, such as sexually transmitted diseases
or parasitic infections.</TE>
<TE>   The professor with the fever who went to see Terry tested negative
for malaria. But after questioning him about his other
activities--which included having unprotected sex with a local woman
and eating and drinking whatever he pleased--Terry decided to screen
for sexually transmitted diseases and hepatitis A, a viral disease
that is contracted from contaminated water or food.</TE>
<TE>   Considering his risky behaviors, the professor was relatively
lucky. His only positive test result was for hepatitis A, a liver
inflammation that causes jaundice, fever and nausea. There is no
specific treatment other than bed rest, and the professor
recovered--although he was sick for a month and a half. Terry had
offered him the hepatitis A vaccine before his departure, but the
professor thought he had already received it in preparation for a
prior trip.</TE>
<TE>   Even if returning travelers don't notice any symptoms, they should
mention overseas trips to their doctors during routine visits, Terry
and MacLean advise. If a mysterious symptom appears later, the
physician may have an easier time making the diagnosis if he knows
the patient's travel history.</TE>

<LD>After a 30-year closure, the lovely canyon named after a banished
Cahuilla shaman called Tahquitz has reopened on a limited basis to
hikers in Palm Springs. Tribal rangers lead daily hikes through the
storied canyon, which is two miles as the phainopepla flies southwest
of downtown.</LD>
<LD>   At the new Tahquitz Canyon Visitor Center, hikers are ushered into
a screening room for the "Legend of Tahquitz Canyon" video, then led
onto the trail. Groups wind past ancient rock art, diverse desert
flora and sometimes wildlife, including the phainopepla, a small
bluish-black bird of the Southwest. Another highlight is the 60-foot
waterfall featured in Frank Capra's 1937 film "Lost Horizon,"
starring Ronald Colman and Jane Wyatt.</LD>
<LD>   As legend has it, the shaman Tahquitz first practiced his art here
to good effect but soon became increasingly mischievous, then
downright dangerous, and to this day he consumes people's souls. Some
tribal members refuse to enter the canyon. So powerful is Tahquitz,
believers say, that he can suddenly appear in downtown Palm Springs
or manifest himself as an earthquake or a fireball in the sky.</LD>
<TE>   The Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians closed the canyon to
the public in 1969 after a rowdy crowd left a rock concert and
descended into Tahquitz Canyon for days of partying. In the years
that followed, "No Trespassing" signs, locked gates and fences
slowed--but did not stop--visitors.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the hikers and skinny-dippers enjoyed the picturesque
falls and respected the serene scene, but vandals dumped garbage on
the canyon floor and spray-painted graffiti on the boulders. Hippies,
hermits and homeless people took up residence in the canyon's caves.</TE>
<TE>   The Cahuilla built a visitor center with educational and cultural
exhibits and, after a three-year cleanup, reopened the canyon about a
year ago. By allowing only guided hikes, the tribe wants to "keep the
bad people out and let the good people in," said tribal ranger Robert
Hepburn.</TE>
<TE>   The canyon is full of native plants, including brittle bush,
creosote, cholla, hedgehog cactus, ephedra (also called Mormon tea)
and desert lavender. Tour leaders detail the many ways the Cahuilla
used the plants for food and medicine.</TE>
<TE>   Smog sometimes obscures the view down-canyon, but up-canyon vistas
are glorious. From Tahquitz Peak, a subsidiary summit of Mt. San
Jacinto, a lively creek tumbles through an impressive gash in the
towering rock walls.</TE>
<TE>   The visitor center opens at 7:30 a.m. daily. I recommend starting
early and arriving in time to watch the rising sun probe the dark
recesses of Tahquitz Canyon. If you take the 8 a.m. tour, the first
of the day, you'll beat the crowds, avoid the heat and have the best
chance of spotting wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   At just two miles long, the hike is family friendly. But because
it's an interpretive hike that proceeds slowly, it's not suitable for
young children, particularly those younger than 6. They won't
appreciate the ranger's narrative and may become a distraction to
other hikers. One alternative is a self-guided hike through one of
the other Indian Canyons, nearby Palm Canyon, where you can see a
huge collection of California fan palms.</TE>
<TE>   Tours depart from the Tahquitz Canyon Visitor Center at 8 a.m., 10
a.m., noon and 2 p.m. daily. The cost is $12.50 for adults and $6 for
children 12 and under. Reservations are recommended.</TE>
<TE>   From downtown Palm Springs, follow California 111 (Palm Canyon
Drive) south to Mesquite Avenue. Turn right (west) and proceed half a
mile to the parking area below the Tahquitz Canyon Visitor Center.</TE>

<HD>Keeping Up With the Rules of the Visa Game</HD>
<DH>Nearly half the world's nations require a special passport
stamp granting entry, but treaties result in ever-changing
regulations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE ENGLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Quick! Mail me your passport, let me hold onto it for two weeks or
so, and if I lose it--well, too bad.</LD>
<LD>   Would you strike this bargain with a stranger? Millions of
travelers do each year when they apply for visas to visit foreign
countries. The U.S. government may hold your hand when you apply for
a passport, but with visas you're largely on your own. Fail to get
the right stamp on your passport, and you could find yourself banned
from taking off, languishing in line at your destination airport or
even detained and sent home.</LD>
<LD>   Novice and veteran globe-trotters alike have trouble keeping up
with which nations require visas and what the rules are. "One of the
challenges of dealing with Africa is that the governments are so
fluid" and, consequently, so are the visa regulations, says Anne
Bellamy, vice president of Glendale-based tour operator African
Travel Inc.</LD>
<TE>   Fortunately for the casual traveler, many popular destinations
don't require U.S. tourists to have visas. Foreign embassies'
Internet sites have information on those that do, and travel agents,
tour operators and visa services (for a price) can help you run the
bureaucratic gantlet. Their No. 1 piece of advice: As soon as you
know you're booking a foreign trip, check to be sure your passport is
current, then look into visa requirements, says Maryann Van Dongen,
president of Express Visa Service Inc. in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   Some questions that may be on your mind if you're planning a trip:</TE>
<TE>   What is a visa? "An endorsement on a passport, showing that a
person has been granted official entry into or passage through a
country," according to Webster's New World Dictionary, Third College
Edition. Sounds simple, right? But read on.</TE>
<TE>   Which nations require visas? A little fewer than half of the
200-plus foreign nations and territories listed by the State
Department require visas for U.S. citizens to visit as tourists,
according to its Internet site travel.state.gov/foreignentryreqs.html
(last updated in June). Most of those require a visa before arrival,
although a few will grant it when you get there.</TE>
<TE>   Canada, Mexico and most nations in Europe, Latin America, the
Caribbean and many other places that get numerous American visitors
don't require tourist visas. By contrast, many nations in the former
Soviet Union (including Russia), Africa and Asia and most in the
Middle East (except Israel) do require them.</TE>
<TE>   There's no hard and fast rule. As of mid-2001, for instance, South
Africa and Botswana waived tourist visas, but Kenya and Tanzania
required them, according to the State Department list. China and
India required tourist visas, but Indonesia and Japan didn't.</TE>
<TE>   You can blame much of this confusing crazy quilt on politics.
Visas are generally controlled by bilateral treaties between nations,
experts say. As Van Dongen puts it: "It's a tit-for-tat game." If a
nation requires visas for U.S. citizens to visit, we're apt to slap
the same restriction on their visitors. A quick perusal of the State
Department list suggests that U.S. allies are less likely to require
visas from U.S. citizens than are neutral or less friendly nations.</TE>
<TE>   How much do visas cost? Fees for tourist visas generally hover
around $50, says Dale Patterson, chief executive officer of Zierer
Visa Service Inc. in San Ramon, Calif. But a few nations issue them
for free, and others may charge $100 or more, depending on how long
you want to stay and whether you want reentry rights. The typical
tourist visa is good for a stay of 30 to 90 days, but again, it
varies. Fees also are creatures of bilateral diplomacy. The guiding
principle is "do unto others as they have done unto you," says
Christopher Lamora, spokesman for the Bureau of Consular Affairs at
the State Department. For instance, India charges U.S. citizens $60
for a tourist visa good for up to six months, $85 for one year and
$150 for 10 years. The U.S. in turn charges Indians $75 for visas in
several categories. (It's not quite equal. On top of the visa fee,
which the State Department calls a "reciprocal" fee, the U.S. charges
visa applicants a flat, nonrefundable fee of $45 just to apply for a
visa, a sore point with many foreigners.)</TE>
<TE>   You can get an overview of rules and fees on the State
Department's Internet site mentioned above and on Internet sites of
visa services, but experts caution against relying on them. The only
up-to-date authority is the foreign government of your destination.</TE>
<TE>   How do I get a visa? In most cases, you must send your passport,
visa application and the required fee to the issuing nation's
consulate or embassy, which then applies the visa stamp to the
passport and returns it. Experts recommend sending the package by
courier or registered mail so it can be tracked and enclosing a
self-addressed stamped envelope for the return. Be sure to keep a
photocopy of your passport. You can also take the documents to the
nearest consulate or embassy, of course.</TE>
<TE>   A notable exception is Australia. Since May, American travelers
have been able to obtain a visa by Internet at www.eta.immi.gov.au,
paying $20 Australian (about $11 U.S.) by credit card. It's called an
Electronic Travel Authority, or ETA.</TE>
<TE>   A few nations will issue the visa when you arrive at their
airport, but experts advise getting it in advance anyway to avoid
long lines and uncertainty.</TE>
<TE>   How long will it take? Some people have gotten visas the same day
by visiting an embassy, but they're exceptions. "We'd like people to
allow 90 days," Patterson says. Two weeks is the minimum safe period,
he estimates. But be prepared for anything. There can be backlogs and
also cultural differences. "Sometimes [foreign officials] don't have
the same feeling of urgency that Americans have," Patterson says.
Allow extra time if you need two or more visas so your passport can
be shuttled between embassies. Although it's rare, governments can
lose passports, requiring you to apply for another.</TE>
<TE>   Should I use a visa service?  These services, which handle the
paperwork and smooth out problems, are "pricey, but they are very
helpful," especially if you need to get a visa quickly or must get
more than one, says African Travel Inc.'s Bellamy. Many travel agents
and tour operators also will help with visas as part of booking your
trip.</TE>
<TE>   Zierer, (866) 788-1100, www.zvs.com, which was founded in 1954 and
processes about 140,000 visas per year, and Express Visa, (310)
207-2200 (Los Angeles office), www.expressvisa.com, which was founded
in 1979 and processes 60,000 passports and visas yearly, are two of
the bigger services. Expect to pay a service fee of about $45 per
visa, plus the visa fee itself and shipping and handling, depending
on the destination.</TE>
<TE>   And don't think a visa is guaranteed. "Any foreign government can
turn [a visa request] down for any reason," Patterson says.</TE>

<LD>The Italian Alpine village of Cogne was deserted on this November
day. Hiking season was over, skiing season had not yet begun, and my
husband, Franco, and I found ourselves mostly alone.</LD>
<LD>   Cogne, which lies at the foot of Gran Paradiso mountain, consists
of two narrow intersecting streets lined with one grocery store
(closed), one pharmacy (closed), one tobacco/stationery shop
(closed), several hotels (all closed), several restaurants (yes,
closed). As we began searching for a restaurant open for lunch, we
were taken aback by a poster on the door of the stationery store. It
was a giant photograph of the New York skyline as it was before Sept.
11.</LD>
<LD>   Across the bottom of the poster was a triptych of photographs, the
first and second showing the plane heading for the twin towers of the
World Trade Center, and the third showing the towers on fire. It was
incongruous, two Americans staring at this picture in this little
desolate town and not another soul of any nationality around.</LD>
<TE>   We were traveling through Italy collecting information for a book
we are writing about the culinary scene in Italy's lesser-known
regions. We arrived in Milan from Boston and started driving our
rental car toward the Aosta region north of Turin.</TE>
<TE>   As we made our way from the Valle d'Aosta to Alba for the
truffles, to Torino and Elba and Bari and as far south as the island
of Lipari, we began to discover that what we had seen in Cogne was
just one of many indications of Italians' awareness and sensitivity
to the events of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   That poster was just the beginning of six weeks of encounters with
places and people who reminded us constantly of the events that had
shaken the United States two months earlier. Along the way, as soon
as they saw our passports or heard my American-accented Italian,
people extended their sympathy and condolences to us. Although Franco
is from Rome and Italian is his first language, he has lived in the
U.S. long enough to be taken for an American even when traveling in
his native land. And so both of us became the beneficiaries of this
caring in nearly every place we visited.</TE>
<TE>   This sense of solidarity had special meaning for me. It brought to
mind sometimes sweet, sometimes stormy years during the two decades I
lived in Italy.</TE>
<TE>   In April 1959 I went to live in the village of Raito, at the
southern tip of the Amalfi Coast, and I got my first job just a few
miles away in Salerno teaching English at the Berlitz school. When
the capo scuola, the headmaster, hired me, he told me that, in his
estimation, only the British spoke proper English and that Americans
spoke only in slang. He insisted that if I wanted to be hired, I had
to pretend I was Irish, which he thought I might be able to pull off
since my surname was O'Sullivan.</TE>
<TE>   The ruse lasted two weeks. The students in one of my high school
classes, whose English was advanced (this being Berlitz, we spoke
only in English), said they were not fooled. "Professoressa, you're
American, aren't you?" a student asked. "I can tell from your accent
that you're not Irish." In the face of his assertion, I could hardly
continue the lie and confessed, in a whisper, that I was from New
York.</TE>
<TE>   I had never seen a group of people so enthralled to meet an
American. We love America, they said, practically as one. We see all
the American movies.</TE>
<TE>   Most of these teenagers were children when the GIs came up through
Salerno on tanks as they handed out bubble gum. They wanted to know
every detail about the United States that I could recount.</TE>
<TE>   From then on, many of our lessons consisted of my telling my
students what it was like to live in Greenwich Village or what the
Grand Canyon looked like, while we continued to hide our secret from
the headmaster.</TE>
<TE>   After five months in Salerno, I moved with my husband to Bari,
across the peninsula on the Adriatic Coast. There I took up English
teaching again, and little by little I began to learn Italian. My
husband and I taught at the Centro Studi Americani, where our
students were mostly adults in their 20s like us, or older. Nearly
everybody had an uncle in the Bronx, it seemed, and each student
wanted to know whether I knew his Zio Mario or Zio Giuseppe. After
all, I was from New York, wasn't I?</TE>
<TE>   These students, who later became some of our closest friends, also
remembered fondly the arrival of American GIs and the cigarettes and
chocolate they handed out on their way through Puglia to the north.
Even in the late '50s and early '60s, southern Italy was still
recuperating economically, and the love for and gratitude to
Americans was immense and ubiquitous.</TE>
<TE>   The start of the U.S. civil rights movement prompted endless
debates with our friends. Their love for America, once so solid,
began to waver, and they criticized the U.S. for what they saw as its
extreme racism. I found myself defending the country from which I had
purposely expatriated. I tried to explain that it was a big country
and that not everybody felt the way the racists did. I pointed out
that, in their own country, Sicilians trying to get work in Milan and
other northern cities were discriminated against. Try as I might to
explain, those relationships grew strained.</TE>
<TE>   The '60s turned into the '70s, and, separated from my husband, I
went to live in Rome with my 5-year-old son. Italy's Communist Party
had grown huge, and the Cold War was on. Every day on my way from my
apartment in Trastevere to my job at the NBC News office in the
center of the city, I passed huge graffiti that read, "Yankee Go
Home." I felt melancholy every time I saw it.</TE>
<TE>   By now Italy had become my home, more familiar to me than my own
country, but I still couldn't bear to feel the change from the
excited clamor of my students with their uncles in the Bronx to one
of disapproval, even hatred.</TE>
<TE>   The worst was yet to come as the Vietnam War reached its height.
Now I was encountering almost daily anti-American demonstrations all
over Italy. Our NBC News team often covered such events for the U.S.
evening news audience.</TE>
<TE>   By this time I was fluent in the language, dressing like a Roman
signora and able to hide the fact that I was American. And I wanted
to. I could no longer defend America, and I didn't want to
participate in any discussions involving the United States.</TE>
<TE>   By the mid-'70s, job possibilities for noncitizens began to
shrink, and I realized that my career goals could not happen in
Italy. As much as my son and I loved Rome, we made the difficult
decision to return to the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   I have been back in the States for 25 years now, but I return to
Italy every few years to visit my beloved adopted country and see old
friends. On this recent trip with my new husband, Franco, nearly
everyone we met felt concern for us and our fellow Americans.</TE>
<TE>   When the concierge at our favorite hotel in Lucca saw me, he said,
"Oh, Signora, I am so sorry for what has happened to your country."
In a cafe in Cortona, a woman I had never met put her arm around my
shoulder and offered condolences. At the hotel desk in Taranto, the
clerk offered his deep sympathy when he saw our passports. Umberto,
one of my dearest friends in Bari, sent an e-mail expressing his
sorrow.</TE>
<TE>   In Vieste we saw a young man jogging along the coast wearing a
bright satin red-white-and-blue jacket with a big "USA" embroidered
on the front.</TE>
<TE>   When we arrived in Rome we went to the lab where we usually go to
have photos processed. There, covering the entire wall of the shop,
was a giant poster of the New York skyline--including the twin towers
as they used to be. I couldn't take my eyes off it.</TE>
<TE>   Nov. 10 was proclaimed USA day in Rome; Piazza del Popolo was
teeming with signs that said "Per Non Dimenticare" (Never Forget) and
overflowing with Romans cheering and waving American flags.</TE>
<TE>   After all those years of being the target of anti-Americanism, I
found it hard to believe such a sight, and tears came to my eyes. A
sea of American flags covering the entire Piazza del Popolo? The
protesters had their antiwar rally at another piazza, of course, but
both TV and newspapers gave it short shrift. Referring to 1945, when
the American GIs liberated Italy, speakers reminded the crowd that no
Italian should ever forget what America had done for their country.
They spoke of the bond between our nations, forged by the millions of
Italians who emigrated to America.</TE>
<TE>   "We are all New Yorkers," Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said.</TE>
<TE>   For me, it was as if those uncles in the Bronx had reappeared and
I was back in 1959 again.</TE>

<LD>In Susan Spano's article on Hawaii hotel discounts, "Hawaii on Sale"
(Jan. 13), she reports that after searching Web sites, consulting
travel agents and going to the Kona Coast, she found discounts not as
plentiful as she had expected.</LD>
<LD>   My question: What Web sites did she look at? The Mauna Lani Resort
has significant discounts posted on its Web site (www
.maunalani.com). Why did she not check this resort? It is a sister
resort to the Orchid. (They are on the same grounds and have a common
entrance.) Mauna Lani has a promotion that offers an ocean-view room
(including daily breakfast for two) for $295.</LD>

<TE>   The article by Susan Spano did not surprise me. I believe the
powers that be will wait until the entire state of Hawaii is in
bankruptcy or, worse yet, falls to revolution.</TE>
<TE>   With tourism being a major source of revenue, I can't believe that
hotels would not collaborate and create incentives not only to bring
Japanese visitors back but also to appeal to the enormous Southern
California market.</TE>
<TE>   Many Las Vegas, Arizona and even California resorts have rolled
back rates to combat the recession and stimulate travel after the
tragic events last year. I don't understand why Hawaii does not.</TE>

<LD>I moved to the Seattle area a year ago from Rancho Cucamonga, and as
you said in "Seattle Still Rocks" (Jan. 6), it's a great place to
visit. But let me share some points about living here:</LD>
<LD>   * It's the clouds, not the rain. The clouds look like dull
tinfoil. Day in. Day out. I've lost my sunglasses, and I don't care.</LD>
<LD>   * Sometimes the smog gets thick in the winter. So many people are
burning wood in fireplaces that officials have to call for a "burn
ban."</LD>
<TE>   * There's one major freeway. One. And lots of single commuters.</TE>
<TE>   Really, you'll enjoy a visit. See the Space Needle, Pike Place
Market, the great bookstores and high-class restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   But return to California after your stay is up. You won't regret
it.</TE>

<LD>Jerry Haines overlooked so much in his Minnesota article and devoted
too much time to the skyways and stores ("Minneapolis' Cold
Comforts," Jan. 13). He did not even mention the sister city of St.
Paul--home to major corporations and great theater, including "A
Prairie Home Companion." He did not mention the renowned Guthrie
Theater in Minneapolis, the Minneapolis Symphony or the lakes, such
as Calhoun in Minneapolis and Como Park in St. Paul, which have
winter activities.</LD>
<LD>   The Twin Cities are culturally and ethnically diverse and can no
longer be narrowly viewed as Scandinavian.</LD>
<LD>   On his next trip, I suggest that Haines become more adventuresome
and cosmopolitan and go the nine miles into St. Paul.</LD>

<HD>In a Gray Light, Lima's Softer Side Shines</HD>
<DH>Often overlooked, the frenetic capital can claim its place
as a sophisticated urban center.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM STEIGERWALD</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>LIMA, Peru</DL>
<LD>Poor Lima. It has no fine beaches, no spectacular Inca ruins. And
except for the dead of the South American summer--January, February
and March--when the Pacific Ocean fog burns off, it barely gets any
sun.</LD>
<LD>   Poor teeming Lima. Its urban sprawl of 8 million has grown 13-fold
since 1960. If you read the description of Lima in the "Lonely Planet
Guide to Peru," as we did for the first time when already aboard our
flight, you'll want to ask the flight attendant for a parachute.</LD>
<LD>   Lonely Planet pulls no punches in its description: Poor. Crowded.
Gridlocked. Noisy. Dirty. Polluted. Flat. Gray. Boring.
Nerve-racking. Welcome to Peru's 467-year-old capital, a.k.a. "The
City of Kings." Oh, and, watch out for thieves and pickpockets.
They're everywhere.</LD>
<TE>   OK, so Lima's no day at Zuma Beach. It's no wonder most travelers
avoid it or fly in and out as quickly as possible to glorious Cuzco,
the ancient two-mile-high gateway to the magnificent Incan ruins of
Machu Picchu.</TE>
<TE>   But as photographer Steven Adams and I discovered when we went in
mid-October, Lima is an excellent place for Americans to encounter
Peruvian culture, shop for bargains and experience the mad human rush
of a first-class Third World city. And you can do all three without
putting your life, health or credit card in any danger.</TE>
<TE>   Lima sits on the Pacific coast in central Peru, but its easterly
location--it is 3,586 miles almost directly south of
Philadelphia--may surprise you. Its 39 city-sized political districts
include the mostly middle-class communities of Surco and
tourist-friendly Miraflores, whose tidy residential neighborhoods,
up-market mini-malls and bustling business districts could
impersonate parts of Miami or L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Lima has its rough neighborhoods and dangerous shantytowns, to be
sure. But few Americans would feel uncomfortable in Miraflores. It
has nearly any luxury or cultural necessity the softest First Worlder
could desire, from Tony Roma's ribs and cell phone shops to ATMs and
Internet cafes.</TE>
<TE>   To be fair, Lonely Planet's guide does note--though without much
enthusiasm--that Lima has some of Peru's most beautiful churches and
best museums, including the "must-see" Mujica Gallo Gold Museum.
And--somebody call Arthur Frommer!--it has fine dining and night life
too. Of course, so does rusty old Pittsburgh, which is where Steve
and I live and work for a daily newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   We spent five days in Lima covering the travels of a
globe-circling railroad entrepreneur from Pittsburgh named Henry
Posner III. Posner's management company operates small railroads in
developing countries, including Peru's Ferrocarril Central Andino
railroad, the highest standard-gauge rail line in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Twice a year the Ferrocarril, usually a freight line, hooks up
with Trains Unlimited, Tours and runs a special over-the-Andes
passenger excursion for British and U.S. railroad fans. Train
enthusiasts pay upward of $5,000 to ride the rails in Peru and
Ecuador for 18 days.</TE>
<TE>   Before we took our weekend train ride, however, Steve and I had
two full days to kill in Lima--or, as we joked after reading Lonely
Planet's warnings, "two days to be killed in Lima."</TE>
<TE>   When Posner visits Lima he stays in Miraflores at the Marriott or
the Holiday Inn. We, however, did not cross the equator to pay the
rates charged by those no-surprises chains. Before we left, Steve and
I used www.peruhotel.com to reserve a room at the Hotel Antigua
Miraflores, a former colonial mansion on a quiet side street in
central Miraflores.</TE>
<TE>   The price--$80 for a roomy double--included taxes and service
charges and a generous continental breakfast (featuring
ham-and-cheese omelets) in a lovely dining room. Hotel Antigua is
loaded with character--ancient tile floors, chandeliers, balconies,
gardens and lots of local art. The rooms have spiffy new bathrooms,
pine colonial furniture and American cable TV channels. Manos Amigas,
the gift shop, sells handmade wool sweaters and crafts by 25 local
artisans at prices designed to pay the crafters fair wages. Fine
men's crewneck alpaca sweaters are as much as $50, more than double
what you pay a few blocks away at places like the Miraflores Indian
Market. There you'll find guilt-inducing low prices: heavy woven wool
jackets ($30), alpaca sweaters ($17) and scarves ($9).</TE>
<TE>   Before we hit the sack on our first night in Miraflores, Steve and
I checked out the local night life. At 1 a.m. the side streets were
quiet, except for the parade of prowling taxis that honked as they
passed. In the shadows of one street corner, a teenage soldier in
camouflage stood guard with a submachine gun. After those warnings
about thieves, he seemed more comforting than repressive.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of bars and restaurants were still open--and, like nearly
every shop and eatery we entered during our stay, devoid of patrons.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning there was no sun, no clouds, just a gray glow.
The 60-degree air felt damp and chilly. Miraflores' main drag,
Avenida Jose Larco, was already crazy by 8:30, crammed with beeping
taxis and maniacal minibuses. Shop owners swept their gritty
sidewalks. Vendors were already hawking fruit, cookies and candies,
and shoeshine boys like 14-year-old Walter were up early. With a
primitive homemade shoeshine kit over his shoulder, he spotted us
half a block away.</TE>
<TE>   Walter, "the youngest of many brothers and sisters," he says,
wanted to re-whiten my white athletic shoes for only 5 soles, about
$1.50. When I told him I like them dirty, Walter cut to the chase and
asked for $10, "please, to eat."</TE>
<TE>   When he pitched me again 30 minutes later, I gave him $1 just to
leave me alone. I appreciated his persistence. Besides, you never
know: Alejandro Toledo, the new president of Peru, was once a
shoeshine boy.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of bustling Avenida Jose Larco, past the Marriott and
down a steep cliff lurks the gray Pacific. Hardly a mile from our
hotel, it laps quietly on a broad, empty beach, creating a beige
froth of mysterious pollutants. It's impossible to tell where the
gray sea meets the gray sky.</TE>
<TE>   With the palm trees, the high rises and the beach far below, it's
easy to imagine yourself in Santa Monica. Clinging to the cliff side
is Larco Mar, a mall as upscale and as consumer friendly as any in
L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Two-tiered, patrolled by diligent private security guards,
architecturally dolled up and lavishly landscaped with flowers and
palm trees, its tenants include chocolate boutiques, high-priced
alpaca sweater shops, cafes, a video arcade, a toy store, Hard Rock
Cafe and Tony Roma's. The mall was quiet at noon. But by evening
Larco Mar's terrazzo began to jump. Local kids came by the score to
hang out, and couples of all ages came to clutch and smooch as Lima's
invisible sun set. The stiff evening onshore breeze kept several
daredevils showing off in their parasails for an hour.</TE>
<TE>   We ate lunch at the allegedly trendy Cafe Cafe near Parque
Kennedy. Paying about $9 each for our mediocre tacos and icy Cusquena
beers was no bargain compared with the dinner we had that night in
Barranco, a bohemian suburb of artists and poets a 30-minute walk
from Miraflores.</TE>
<TE>   Our fresh sea bass, pie and coffee at Las Mesitas Restaurante
Turistico cost us less than $11 each, including tip. It was simple
but tasty fare, and the service was extra-diligent, mainly because
there were only two other customers: a husband-wife team of alpaca
importers from Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   Friday morning we set out by cab for central Lima and one of the
city's biggest religious events: the 235th annual procession in honor
of the Lord of the Miracles. The all-day Oct. 18 pageant honors a
painting of Christ and the Virgin Mary that survived several
earthquakes in the late 1600s. Attracting tens of thousands of
worshipers and an army of street vendors, it features a huge
double-sided religious image on a gold and silver platform so heavy
it takes 54 straining men to carry it.</TE>
<TE>   Lurching down broad avenues through thick crowds at about two
blocks per hour, the procession--the flower-festooned platform, a
peppy marching band and hundreds of purple-robed VIPs--was circled by
a 3-inch-thick rope carried by police in burgundy berets.</TE>
<TE>   We were exhausted by the time we stumbled into a tiny neighborhood
restaurant where a pork and sweet potato sandwich on a roll and a
soda cost about $2. At an amazingly busy street corner, where
colorful minibuses arrived every 10 seconds, we hopped a tiny taxi to
downtown Lima's insane shopping district.</TE>
<TE>   Our driver drove like every other cabby: He sped around like a
madman, obeyed no traffic laws, never signaled, never gave another
driver or pedestrian an inch, and beeped his horn constantly. Along
the way, as if to remind us we were indeed in the developing world,
we passed a man cooking a cow's head in a small fire by an overpass.</TE>
<TE>   In central Lima, the narrow pedestrian walkway between Plaza San
Martin and Plaza de Armas is a wild outdoor shopping mall. A narrow
canyon of storefronts and restaurants, it surged with thousands of
shoppers and street vendors and money-changers and Indian flute
players and police who twice warned Steve to guard his cameras.</TE>
<TE>   For blocks in every direction, people were selling things. Most of
Lima's 300,000 street vendors, the core of the city's so-called
"informal sector," seemed to be working Avenida Abancay. It seemed as
though everyone was selling something: watchbands, batteries,
magazines, slices of pineapple, flowers, cakes, toys, Toyota floor
mats. Few seemed to be buying.</TE>
<TE>   Except for the diesel fumes and the eternal threat of pickpockets,
central Lima is civilized, safe and fascinating, a rich collision of
colonial Spanish and Indian cultures with the best and worst of
modern American commercialism.</TE>
<TE>   Those who prefer their cities with tidy, traffic-free downtowns
would be terrified by such a chaotic, energized and virtually
unregulated sidewalk marketplace. But in poor Lima, where the people
are friendly and invariably happy to find two norteamericanos in
their madding midst, it is business and daily life as usual.</TE>

<HD>Where Time Glides By</HD>
<DH>The lakeside town of Annecy in the French Alps has captured
the hearts of philosophers and royalty through the ages. Now it's a
haven for tourists and swans--lots of them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER WORTSMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>ANNECY, France</DL>
<LD>"God is calling you. Go to Annecy," a clergyman told Jean Jacques
Rousseau, a 16-year-old runaway from Switzerland who went on to
become the noted 18th century writer and philosopher. Though the
clergyman hoped the young man would find a spiritual haven, Rousseau
instead found romance in this sparkling lakeside town that seduces
pilgrims to this day.</LD>
<LD>   I first experienced Annecy's charms by accident in 1969. A young
waiter-in-training at a resort hotel in the Swiss Alps just next
door, I had planned a day trip to Geneva but boarded the wrong train,
crossing the French border and stepping off in Annecy. About all I
remember is the sun shimmering on its deeply blue lake and the stain
of a melted Roseau du Lac, a local chocolate and coffee confection
that I'd left too long in the pocket of my white shirt. But Annecy
called me back.</LD>
<LD>   A brief stopover with my wife and kids in 1999 whetted our
appetite for more. Where else can you stroll along flower-lined quays
by pristine canals with floating swans, drop in at a downtown castle
and dungeon, boat or sunbathe on a vast lake ringed by snowcapped
ridges, frolic on nearby alpine meadows and dine on fondue or
freshwater fish? Rousseau had the right idea.</LD>
<TE>   When we returned for a five-day stay last summer, our pretext was
the Fete du Lac, an annual fireworks and water spectacle held in
early August. The celebration dates back to 1860, after Napoleon III
helped liberate Italy from Austria and the Italians rewarded the
French by giving them the province of Savoy (pronounced sav-WA).
Today Annecy is the capital of the Haute-Savoie region and still one
of the prettiest towns in France.</TE>
<TE>   Little did our family suspect that attending the festival had also
occurred to about 200,000 other folks, who converged on Annecy from
all directions and created gridlock. (The city is, after all, only
about 25 miles from Geneva and 50 miles from the Italian border.)
Even with spectator tickets in hand, it was sheer havoc jockeying for
a lakeside spot to watch the 2 1/2-hour extravaganza (last year on a
Brazilian theme), surely the most lavish, flamboyant and lengthy
fireworks display I have ever seen. Frogmen dragged floats evoking
indigenous deities rocking to a samba beat.</TE>
<TE>   And when the rockets finally burst forth, it was like a volcano
streaking the sky, the mountainsides and the sloping rooftops of
Annecy's old quarter, the whole effect mirrored in the lake. Though
my French wife, Claudie, and I, both experienced travelers, initially
bemoaned our lack of judgment to have come at such a time, our
6-year-old son, Jacques, and 11-year-old daughter, Aurelie, were in
heaven, and Annecy will forever sparkle in our memories.</TE>
<TE>   Dragging the kids away early to head off the crowd, we walked from
the shoreline to the city's old quarter, which we practically had to
ourselves--except for the languid swans floating by.</TE>
<TE>   Returning the next day after the throng had dispersed, we happened
upon a living statue of Rousseau portrayed by a motionless mime in
white. A more permanent marble bust graces the courtyard just off the
Canal Notre-Dame, where Rousseau first set eyes on the love of his
life, Madame de Warens, a 28-year-old who was 12 years his senior.
His lover's house here was replaced by a bishop's palace fronting a
street now named after the philosopher, but today the building is the
city police headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Human presence can be traced from 3100 BC on a spot not far from
Annecy's present site, where the Thiou River empties into the
northern tip of Lake Annecy.</TE>
<TE>   The original lakeside village, one of the oldest settlements in
the Alps, fell to successive invasions, most notably Celts, followed
in the 5th century by Romans. Emperor Anicius Olybrius built himself
a grand villa on the lake, Anneciacum, thought to be the source of
Annecy's name.</TE>
<TE>   In subsequent centuries the Savoy region kept changing hands.
Sacked and rebuilt, Annecy went from mountain metropolis to backwater
burg to strategic stronghold, probably reaching its peak in the 17th
century, when it became known as the Rome of the Alps as Catholic
theologians and intellectuals fled Geneva after it embraced the
Reformation.</TE>
<TE>   In the 19th century European nobility rediscovered Annecy as an
idyllic vacation spot, building lavish palaces on the lake. The
commoners soon followed, but the city has kept its air of grace and
elegance, upheld by geranium-filled flower boxes at every bend and
symbolized by those regal long-necked swans.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't they ever get a neck ache?" asked my son, more accustomed
to pigeons.</TE>
<TE>   The pedestrians-only historic district is filled with buildings
from the 16th and 17th centuries. But Annecy's oldest structure and
centerpiece is the perfectly preserved 12th century Palais de l'Isle,
a former prison and mint that sits in the middle of the Thiou River.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately catching your eye and triggering your camera finger,
its squat gray facade sits there like a petrified gnome taking a foot
bath. Circled by those ubiquitous white waterfowl, if you block out
the surrounding souvenir stands in your imagination, you can
transport yourself back to the Middle Ages. The Palais de l'Isle
houses a museum devoted to the history of Annecy and contains a
dungeon (complete with shackles and vintage graffiti) used during the
German occupation to incarcerate the French resistance fighters of
World War II. There's also a bulky 14th century coin minting
apparatus, the ATM of its day.</TE>
<TE>   Emerging from the dungeon, we stopped for a bite at Le Milton Pub,
one of the many outdoor cafes clustered on the Rue St. Claire. On
Tuesday, Friday and Sunday mornings, the street becomes a sprawling
outdoor market where vendors hawk fresh produce, fish from the lake,
local white wines and mammoth cylinders of Savoyard cheese that will
get melted down into fondue and other local specialties.</TE>
<TE>   Traveling families like ours must occasionally resort to bribes to
keep the peace, so it seemed expedient to meet the children's demands
to visit Le Monde Merveilleux des Alpes Miniatures (the Marvelous
World of Alpine Miniatures), at 10 Rue St. Claire, a museum and shop
of tiny Alpine tableaux inhabited by miniature bears and marmots.
Admission is free, but micro-furniture for our daughter's dollhouse
and mini-armaments for our son's toy castle nearly broke the bank.</TE>
<TE>   But the souvenirs bought the parents a momentary reprieve, and we
marched together up to the Chateau d'Annecy, the former hilltop
residence of various counts and dukes who once ruled Savoy. Dominated
by a massive 12th century tower, the castle's vast cobblestone
courtyard could hold an army of mounted knights. Another tower, this
one from the 15th century, has some striking period ceilings and
doubles as a modern art museum.</TE>
<TE>   Back in town, the children kindly let us take in a church or two,
notably the 15th century Church of St. Maurice and the 17th century
Church of St. Francis, where the remains of Annecy's most famous son,
Francis de Sales, are enshrined. De Sales, a cardinal and erudite
theologian known for his spiritual writings, sparked an enlightened
cultural renaissance in Annecy, fostering the study of Latin, Greek
and Hebrew. He tolerated diverse views, including Galileo's astronomy
theories, banned in Rome at the time. He co-founded the Florimontane
Academy, one of France's earliest literary societies, which became
the prototype for that bastion of French learning, the Academie
Francaise.</TE>
<TE>   Enough civilization already. The natural splendor of the Savoy
Alps beckoned. At nine miles long, Lake Annecy may not be the largest
Alpine basin but, surrounded by wooded peaks, it has an unspoiled
beauty that has not succumbed to pollution, unlike lakes Como and
Garda in Italy. Lake Annecy cleaned up its act about 35 years ago
when the towns bordering its shoreline got together to build an
underground pipeline, deflecting sewage to a treatment plant. The
result is what the Annecy tourist board claims to be Europe's
cleanest lake.</TE>
<TE>   There are multiple ways to savor Lake Annecy. You can swim in it;
there are many nice beaches. You can take a cruise on a big steamer
out of Annecy or rent a pedal boat for a short hop or a motorboat for
a longer private spin.</TE>
<TE>   You can sail, windsurf or water ski. You can bicycle or jog along
a pathway that circles the entire lake. You can drive it too, as we
did, stopping along the way for a view or a dip.</TE>
<TE>   The view is particularly striking from the terrace of the 13th
century Chateau de Menthon, near the charming town of Talloires,
birthplace of St. Bernard (namesake of the big dogs).</TE>
<TE>   Duingt, a lakeside hamlet on the west bank, likewise merits a
visit. Just off the road, hidden from view beneath the cliffs of the
Roc de Chere, this rustic Savoyard village has preserved many of its
trellised stairways and vintage brown tiled rooftops.</TE>
<TE>   Our hideaway was a bit more remote and no less rustic. Les Rochers
Blancs, a cozy inn, sits high atop a wooded mountain ridge known as
Le Semnoz. At its restaurant we dined on fondue and la petite friture
(literally "small fry" from the lake). And we slept like babies,
awakened by the gentle tinkle of cowbells in the morning. One day we
followed a herd of goats to a lone farmhouse where cheese was made
and sold. On a clear day, they say, from the top of Le Semnoz you can
spot the most recognized summit of the western Alps, Mont Blanc.</TE>
<TE>   The gruff innkeeper with the handlebar mustache claimed he
remembered us from a previous stay. We remembered his wife's cooking.
And here, every night before closing our wooden shutters against the
mountain chill, we could catch a glimpse of Annecy flickering
golden--unreal--in the distance below.</TE>
<TE>   In old age, Jean Jacques Rousseau, whose writings were an
inspiration for the French Revolution, grew nostalgic about Annecy,
longing to return to the place "around which my heart has never
ceased to wander." Not one to depend on a fickle memory, I know I'll
be back.</TE>

<TE>   Getting there: The nearest international airport to Annecy is
Geneva, Switzerland, across the French border and reachable by
connecting flights from LAX on Delta, British Airways, Air France,
Swissair, Lufthansa and KLM. Restricted round-trip fares begin at
$626. Annecy is about a 30-minute drive from Geneva. You can also fly
to Paris (via Delta, Air France and AirLib; restricted round-trip
fares start at $583) and hop a high-speed TGV train from the Gare de
Lyon station to Annecy, about a four-hour trip. One-way train fares
are $83 second class, $106 first class. For train schedules, contact
Rail Europe, (888) 382-7245, www.raileurope.com.</TE>
<TE>   The heart of the old town being off-limits to cars, parking in
Annecy can be a hassle during the summer high season. When the nearby
parking garages were full, we twice found spots in the outdoor lot
near the Centre Nautique, just below the medical center.</TE>
<TE>   Telephones: To call the numbers below from the U.S., dial 011 (the
international access code), 33 (country code for France), 4 (area
code for the southeast) and the local number.</TE>
<TE>   Currency: France is in the process of converting to the euro; the
franc will not be accepted after Feb. 17.</TE>
<TE>   Where to stay: On the lake, at the end of its own private
peninsula, is the luxury Imperial Palace, 5009-3000, fax 5009-3333,
www.lacannecy.com/french/hebergement/himperial.asp, complete with
private beach, spa and casino. Double rooms start at about $200;
lake-view suites are $670.</TE>
<TE>   For a simple but well-appointed lakeside option outside town, try
Le Clos Marcel (5068-6747, fax 5068-6111). Doubles begin at about $49
per night in low season and go to $62 in high season; there is a
three-night, half-board minimum in high season.</TE>
<TE>   My favorite is the Hotel Les Rochers Blancs, 5001-2360, fax
5001-4068, a rustic inn on the summit of Le Semnoz, about a half-hour
drive from Annecy up a steep, winding mountain road but well worth
the effort. Doubles about $35.</TE>
<TE>   Where to eat: The local specialties are heavy on the cheese:
tartiflette, a kind of cheese and potato casserole; raclette, melted
cheese on prosciutto; and fondue Savoyarde, the classic pot of melted
cheese for dipping with pieces of crusty French bread. Annecy offers
a gaggle of bistros specializing in these gooey dishes, mostly
clustered around the Rue St. Claire. We have come away stuffed but
satisfied from Le Freti, 12 Rue St. Claire.</TE>
<TE>   The hunting-lodge-style restaurant at Les Rochers Blancs serves up
a savory Savoyarde fondue (about $10); also offers a three-course
meal of the day (about $17).</TE>
<TE>   For the choice catch of the lake in elegant surroundings, the
Auberge du Lyonnais in Annecy is worth a splurge; 14 Quai de
l'Eveche, 5051-2610 (Reserve a table on the terrace overlooking the
canal.) One night the three-course menu (a steal at about $18)
included a terrine of pike topped with creamy basil sauce, roast
filet of perch with buttery lentils and a souffle topped with a
coulis of wild berries; a la carte offerings included a ragout of
monkfish ($21) and langouste ($26).</TE>
<TE>   A good snack spot is Le Milton Pub, 21 Rue St. Claire, 5045-0838.
Its specialty, aside from beer, is Flammekuche, a kind of Alsatian
pizza served on square wooden boards ($5-$6, depending on topping).</TE>
<TE>   For more information: To find out more about the Fete du Lac (Aug.
3 this year), contact Annecy Evenements, 1 Rue Jean Jaures,
5045-0142. We rented a medium-size motorboat for about $34 an hour at
Deronzier Location Pedalos Bateaux, 5044-3433, in Doussard, a small
town at one end of Lake Annecy, but pretty much the same deal can be
had at many other locations.</TE>

partner, as Bill and Phyllis Marchese of Palm Springs found out years

<HD>There Are Ways of Communicating Even if a Language Is All
Greek to You</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN SPANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES TRAVEL WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is something sad and funny about trying to communicate with
someone who speaks a language I don't know, which happens frequently
when I travel. At a bookstore in Beijing, I once tried to ask for the
children's section. I used what little Chinese I know--hardly more
than "hello," "please" and "thank you"--gestured like a madwoman and
pointed to kids, all to no avail.</LD>
<LD>   Generally I'm more successful. I speak some French, though I
sometimes think I understand more than I really do, which causes
problems, like ending up with a plate of sweetbreads instead of veal
in a French restaurant.</LD>
<LD>   On the other hand, my French is good enough to occasionally serve
as a lingua franca. Last spring in the Seychelles, I met a charming
Italian couple who spoke no English, which would have aborted our
friendship because I don't speak Italian. But we got along famously
in a messy kind of French that would have horrified a native speaker.</LD>
<TE>   Also, I did a little acting in college, and I think that helps me
act out my questions when I can't ask in the language of the land. I
love to meet people who are just as adept at communication by facial
expression and gesture. We may look as though we're playing a nutty
game of charades, but when that moment of mutual understanding
occurs, I feel as though we have forged a connection that goes deeper
than words.</TE>
<TE>   There are many ways to understand and make yourself understood in
a place where you don't speak the language. "The Wordless Travel
Book," by Jonathan Meader (Ten Speed Press, 1995), and similar
compendiums of pictures help travelers communicate by opening the
book and pointing to what they want--a fork, a pineapple, a camel.</TE>
<TE>   Lingo Corp., based in Brooklyn, N.Y., markets pocket translators.
The standard, non-talking model (about $40 from Radio Shack stores
and the Sharper Image) translates words and common phrases between
English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   But I haven't tried a picture book or pocket translator, because
what happens when you say a word or point to a drawing and the person
you're trying to talk to spouts a long, unintelligible response?</TE>
<TE>   In China five years ago, I found a novel way to understand, if not
communicate in, an extremely difficult foreign language by using "I
Can Read That: A Traveler's Introduction to Chinese Characters" by
Julie Mazel Sussman (China Books &amp; Periodicals Inc., 1994). It
introduces some useful and common Chinese characters so you can walk
about in Shanghai or Beijing and recognize key components in street
and shop signs, like east, west, north and south.</TE>
<TE>   The idea for the book stemmed from research Sussman did to prepare
for a trip to China, which included learning about 50 characters.
Recognizing them in China was exciting, she says, and reminded her
how a child must feel while learning to read. "It was as if the
characters I knew were lighted up in neon," Sussman says.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, there is no substitute for learning the language of the
country you plan to visit, or at least enough to get by. "Knowing
enough to show people you are open to their language and are trying
will get you a long way," says John Bennett, a New York-based manager
for Berlitz North America, which produces language books, tapes and
CDs and provides one-on-one live instruction. Bennett says that
travelers from the U.S. are notorious for assuming that people in
foreign countries speak English, which contributes to the "ugly
American" cliche.</TE>
<TE>   The Berlitz approach, which focuses on spoken language immersion,
was developed almost by accident in the late 1870s. Company founder
Maximilian Berlitz, a foreign language instructor in Providence,
R.I., hired a French teaching assistant who didn't speak English.
When Berlitz came down with pneumonia, the assistant took over in
French only, producing results that surpassed those achieved in
classes where both English and French were allowed. Since then, the
Berlitz Method has come to be used in 375 Berlitz language centers
worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   English is the language most in demand at Berlitz, followed by
Spanish, French, German and Italian. Since Sept. 11 there has been a
noticeable increase in requests for instruction in Arabic languages,
spokeswoman Mary Conti says.</TE>
<TE>   Romance languages, including French, Spanish, Italian and
Portuguese, are easiest for native English speakers to learn, says
Kay Rodrigues, a spokeswoman for the Defense Language Institute
Foreign Language Center, a language school for U.S. military and
government employees in Monterey, Calif. There, proficiency in those
languages takes intensive instruction for 25 weeks, compared with 34
weeks for German, 47 weeks for Czech, Russian and Vietnamese, and 63
weeks for Arabic, Mandarin and Japanese.</TE>
<TE>   At the nearby Monterey Institute of International Studies, a
private graduate school that awards degrees in subjects such as
translation and interpretation, the curriculum also includes
cross-cultural communication independent of language. This means
teaching students "how to look and listen," says provost Steven J.
Baker.</TE>
<TE>   Berlitz's Bennett knows two good lookers and listeners who are
5-year-old playmates; one speaks only French, the other only English
and Chinese. "They want to communicate and have the best time in the
world," Bennett says.</TE>
<TE>   How do they do it? When I can answer that, I'll never again have
to play charades with a bus driver or pretend I like sweetbreads.</TE>

<DL>PROVIDENCIALES, Turks and Caicos</DL>
<LD>For a place we couldn't find in most guidebooks, the Turks and Caicos
Islands proved to be quite a charmer.</LD>
<LD>   Blame their lack of fame on their hard-to-categorize geographical
position. The 193-square-mile archipelago of 30 low-lying islands
(only six of which are inhabited) is strung out in the Atlantic
Ocean, southeast of the Bahamas and just north of the Caribbean Sea,
placing the group in neither region.</LD>
<LD>   Blame it on the scarcity of hotel chains promoting their
attractions. Or just be thankful that the Turks and Caicos--only a
90-minute flight from Miami--are all the better for their relative
anonymity.</LD>
<TE>   They are the perfect place to hide out.</TE>
<TE>   Pirates on the lam knew that six centuries ago, when they lay low
amid the treacherous coral reef (one of the longest in the world)
surrounding the archipelago, which is actually two island groups (the
Turks and Caicos) separated by a 7,000-foot-deep, 22-mile-wide trench
of water called the Turks Island Passage.</TE>
<TE>   For a destination so little known, the British Crown Colony of the
Turks and Caicos offers an impressive range of lodging choices.
During our 12-day visit to the islands last winter, my husband,
David, and I sampled a beachfront condo complex, an all-inclusive
family resort and a laid-back private island retreat where nobody
wore shoes, even to dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Providenciales, the archipelago's principal tourist island and
home to about half of the chain's 25,000 citizens, doesn't get much
respect. Too much development, too many tourists, too much bustle,
say longtime visitors who knew the place when it was even sleepier.
Most of the development has been in the last two decades.</TE>
<TE>   But that's all relative. Newcomers will find Provo--as locals call
the island--far less crowded and more tranquil than the high-rise hot
spots of south Florida, the Bahamas, much of the Caribbean and
coastal Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Populated by the descendants of African slaves brought to the
island in the 17th century, as well as an expat community of
American, British, Haitian, Canadian, French, Scandinavian and
Dominican nationals, Provo is a friendly, live-and-let-live kind of
place where there's little ado about anything.</TE>
<TE>   The 12-mile powdery beach along Grace Bay, site of most of the
islands' resorts and condos--none taller than four stories--is rarely
crowded. Pockets of sunbathers may sprawl over short spans in front
of the big resorts, but the beach is wide and the space between most
lodgings substantial.</TE>
<TE>   We did a little of everything on Provo, spending the first few
days at Beaches, an all-inclusive family resort that is part of the
Sandals chain, then moving to the Ocean Club, a condo complex with
all the services of a hotel at the other end of Grace Bay.</TE>
<TE>   We devoted a few hours each day to lazing and made a daily ritual
of long beach walks by a sea so turquoise that it looked colorized.
We walked early in the morning, while the air was still cool, and at
dusk to catch the sunsets.</TE>
<TE>   When spurts of energy called for action, we snorkeled right off
the beach at the Ocean Club, swimming amid purple and orange sponges,
neon anemones, giant sea fans and a resident bottlenose dolphin named
JoJo. We went parasailing at Beaches and joined a half-day kayak
excursion through backwater mangrove marshes and small cays of
Princess Alexandra National Park off Providenciales.</TE>
<TE>   One moonless night we hopped aboard a 50-foot catamaran to watch a
showy spectacle of millions of glowworms mating like Lilliputian lava
lights, not far offshore from the Ocean Club. At the Provo Golf Club
(across the street from the Ocean Club), we dodged iguanas on the
course.</TE>
<TE>   Off the island, we took a day trip by boat and taxi through
relatively undeveloped Middle Caicos, where we explored
cathedral-size limestone caves and beaches studded with giant rock
formations.</TE>
<TE>   On Grand Turk, the islands' administrative capital, a 20-minute
flight from Provo, taxi driver Rosemary Simon took us around to see
brightly colored wood and concrete houses and the excellent National
Museum, which documents the Molasses Reef wreck of 1513, one of the
oldest European shipwrecks in the New World.</TE>
<TE>   At Beaches, which we intended to use as a base our first week, we
re-learned a travel lesson the hard way: No matter how
well-publicized a hotel is, the place has to be the right fit to make
it a winner.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, the 462-room resort would be filled with children, but it
was great for couples too, the booking agent said. There were five
swimming pools (four with swim-up bars), nine restaurants, including
two for adults only, a spa for soothing treatments and plenty of
solitude on our terrace suite.</TE>
<TE>   "In fact," the agent said, "we also think of ourselves as a
honeymoon resort."</TE>
<TE>   Not unless you consider screaming children, and adults screaming
at screaming children, everywhere all the time, a honeymoon
atmosphere. Our "tranquil terrace" faced a huge family pool. The spa
services (available at an extra charge) and adults-only
restaurants--a French bistro and a cafe that served a little of
everything--were nice enough. But the minute we left their shelter,
we were back in the tumult. Even the adult activities intruded on our
peace; the disco's music blared into our room deep into the night.</TE>
<TE>   To be fair, the multigenerational families seemed to be having a
fabulous time. There were loads of activities for kids: treasure
hunts and sand-castle building for the littlest ones; an arcade of
Sega electronic games; a teen disco and "Family Feud"-type contests.</TE>
<TE>   On Day 3 we bolted.</TE>
<TE>   At the other end of Grace Bay from Beaches, the 86-room Ocean
Club, opened in 1992, was the first condo community on Provo. It
shows its age, not in dowdiness but in a comfort level and
camaraderie that come with being a contented old-timer. The place is
not as swank as some of the other condo resorts on Grace Bay--the
Grace Bay Club and Point Grace are the toniest--but the easygoing
atmosphere made up for the lack of frills. This is a place where you
can kick off your shoes and feel instantly at home. And we did.</TE>
<TE>   Our beachfront room, like all the one- to three-bedroom units in
the three-story buildings, had a full kitchen, washer and dryer, cool
white tile flooring, maid service daily and a huge screened-in
terrace that we seldom wanted to leave, even for meals. And of
course, we didn't have to.</TE>
<TE>   When we wanted table service, we ambled down to the beachside
Cabana Bar and Grille, an on-site outdoor cafe that served breakfast,
lunch and light dinners, and where the waiters knew all the repeat
guests by name. The resort's Gecko Grille was a fancier indoor and
outdoor candlelight affair, serving creatively prepared seafood with
a Caribbean kick. The Ocean Club also provided taxis to other
restaurants in the area, with return service at a prearranged time.</TE>
<TE>   Some advice: The Ocean Club complex is shaped like a horseshoe.
The units along the two flat ends are beachfront, while the others
curve back from the beach around the two pools, grill and landscaped
gardens. If you want those premium rooms where you can see the surf
lapping against the sand right in front of you, be specific with the
reservations agent. Go for a second- or third-floor unit if you can
handle stairs.</TE>
<TE>   If life were fair, we would own one of the 37 beach houses on Pine
Cay, an 800-acre private island of palms, dunes, sea grape and
talc-like sand that is only a 10-minute flight east from Provo.</TE>
<TE>   As it was, we were content to settle into one of the 13 simple,
airy oceanfront rooms of the island's Meridian Club, a tiny resort
that Pine Cay homeowners created for paying visitors. It was an ideal
spot for the last five days of our trip. Here we rested up from all
the resting up we had done on Provo.</TE>
<TE>   The folks who own the island and created the club are mainly
wealthy Americans who rigorously maintain a quiet informality they
like to call "the anti-Four Seasons." The rooms have no
air-conditioning (ceiling fans sufficed), no television and no
phones. No children younger than 12 are allowed.</TE>
<TE>   The place felt more like an adult summer camp than an expensive
resort, which it was, at about $650 a room per night. Our fellow
guests, mostly highly stressed business folks, were happy to pay big
bucks for simple pleasures in exquisite surroundings.</TE>
<TE>   The staff at the Meridian Club, mostly long-timers from
neighboring islands, was friendly but not subservient. At dinner,
gentlemen were expected to wear collared shirts, but shoes were
optional. Meals, included in the price, were tasty but simply
prepared. There was largely buffet fare at breakfast and lunch, and
the sit-down dinners in the clubhouse were a little more elaborate.
Wines (at extra cost) ranged from uncomplicated varietals to pricey
vintages. You could bring your own, but there was a stiff corkage
fee.</TE>
<TE>   What did we do all day?</TE>
<TE>   We strolled the two-mile beach, especially at dusk, when we
collected delicate white sand dollars that washed up at low tide. We
did a little snorkeling offshore and some shelling on a nearby islet.
We read books we had brought.</TE>
<TE>   A few couples set off on diving excursions or day trips to Provo
or pit their casting skills against the famously defiant bonefish
that are abundant in flats around the islands. We waved goodbye to
them from the chaises in front of our rooms and usually greeted their
return from the same spot.</TE>
<TE>   Most said they regretted being away from Pine Cay ... even for a
day. We haven't gotten over the fact that we're not still there.</TE>

<HD>A Primer On Getting A Berth</HD>
<DH>Olympics: The path to getting a sport into the Games lineup
isn't easy. Here's how women's bobsled made the grade.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a summer day in 1995, Stew Flaherty was working out at his gym in
Westerville, Ohio, when something unusual happened. Two women struck
up a conversation about bobsledding.</LD>
<LD>   They'd heard that Flaherty, a financial consultant, had a knack
for fund raising, and they needed funds. They quickly got to the
point: Could he help develop a U.S. women's bobsled team?</LD>
<LD>   The Olympics weren't even a consideration. They just wanted to
compete in some international races. They had no money. No sleds. No
support from the federation running the sport and, really, no team.</LD>
<TE>   For some reason, Flaherty said yes.</TE>
<TE>   Next month, he'll be track-side as women's bobsled makes its
Olympic debut. The 1,500-meter freestyle race in cross-country skiing
is another new contest at the Salt Lake City Games, and skeleto --a
headfirst, seemingly suicidal version of luge--returns for the first
time since the 1948 Olympics. Men and women will compete in both of
those events.</TE>
<TE>   The journey to becoming an Olympic sport is hardly an easy one. It
is a complicated and sometimes combative process that involves
everything from gender equity and medal possibilities to worldwide
popularity, the quality of competition and the costs of staging an
event.</TE>
<TE>   The International Olympic Committee wants something that is
exciting and keeps pace with the times--snowboarding, for example,
which debuted at the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano. The host committee
wants something that brings more medals to the home country and
doesn't cost a lot to add.</TE>
<TE>   The athletes want the recognition and financial support that come
with competing in the games.</TE>
<TE>   There's a slew of sports--and some events that aren't really
sports--vying for a spot at the Summer or Winter Games, everything
from bridge and ballroom dancing to water skiing and sumo wrestling.</TE>
<TE>   Yet success might simply come down to old-fashioned lobbying, good
timing and even better luck.</TE>
<TE>   Here's how one group did it, defying the odds to reach the
pinnacle of amateur sports.</TE>
<TE>   When Flaherty entered the picture, women's bobsled was barely a
glint in the eye of the world's bobsled federations. The U.S. team
consisted of about eight women who knew little about the sport.
Outside the United States, only Canada, Britain, Germany and
Switzerland fielded women's teams in international races, where no
more than eight sleds competed on any given day.</TE>
<TE>   To be an Olympic event, a sport must be contested in more than two
dozen countries and on several different continents and it must have
a competitive world championship.</TE>
<TE>   Women's bobsled fell far short of the requirements.</TE>
<TE>   But no one, particularly not Flaherty, was thinking about the
Olympics back then. He just wanted to help the women build a team. He
went to the United States Bobsled and Skeleton Federation in search
of money and equipment, and ran into the first of many roadblocks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like asking a starving man to share his food with you,"
Flaherty said. "The men were very afraid that we were going to take
away what little they had."</TE>
<TE>   So Flaherty found an independent sponsor, and began pouring his
own money into the program.</TE>
<TE>   They cut costs, renting sleds until they bought their first one
from a museum for a mere $5,000 -- $30,000 below the going rate for a
new one. At their debut competition in Calgary, the women paid $24 a
night to stay in an Olympic training center instead of a hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the obstacles, Flaherty began wondering: Why wasn't this
an Olympic sport?</TE>
<TE>   "I decided this is ridiculous," he said. "The women can slide as
competitively as the men," he said. "With proper training and proper
equipment, there's no reason they shouldn't be Olympic."</TE>
<TE>   He joined forces with Joseph Kilburn, the women's bobsled
coordinator for the International Bobsled and Skeleton Federation, or
the FIBT. During the 1996-97 season, they began researching the
requirements. They set their sights on the 2002 Games.</TE>
<TE>   The main hurdle was they needed more countries to field teams and
additional worldwide competitions to increase exposure. Those nations
already competing started an adopt-a-country program and began
lobbying their sister federations around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Yet few federations wanted to take money from their men's programs
to support women's bobsled.</TE>
<TE>   Chauvinism also was a problem. At one race in Germany, the women
were forced to use a different starting point than the men, resulting
in several spills. Some sledders almost quit.</TE>
<TE>   Even the FIBT, whose support was crucial for the IOC to consider
women's bobsled, was lukewarm at first--pushing for skeleton instead
because it had more international support, Flaherty said.</TE>
<TE>   Flaherty and the U.S. team, along with sledders from around the
world, began a letter-writing campaign to the FIBT, the Salt Lake
Organizing Committee and the International Olympic Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The following year, in 1997, the FIBT began the first official
women's World Cup competition.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, former Olympic luger Bonny Warner got wind of the effort
and quickly joined. Her approach: If the IOC was as committed to
gender equity as it claimed, women's bobsled should be in the
Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Using her connections within the U.S. Olympic Committee and the
Salt Lake Organizing Committee, Warner started lobbying.</TE>
<TE>   "Salt Lake didn't want to do it unless the IOC wanted to do it,
and the IOC didn't want to do it unless the international federation
wanted to do it, and the international federation didn't want to do
it," she said. "Nobody said no, but everybody said well maybe by
2010, maybe by 2006."</TE>
<TE>   Then fate intervened. In December 1998, at a World Cup race at the
Olympic sledding venue in Park City, Utah, Americans Jean Racine and
Jennifer Davidson took gold and teammates Jill Bakken and Meg
Henderson finished with the silver.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, the SLOC saw victories in a sport the U.S. men hadn't
medaled in since 1956.</TE>
<TE>   In June 1999, the SLOC approved the addition of women's bobsled to
the 2002 program, along with skeleton. Four months later, the IOC
concurred.</TE>
<TE>   During the first official World Cup season, there were 14 women's
teams representing seven nations, Kilburn said. Today, there are 37
teams from 24 nations. Seventeen teams will be at the Olympics, with
the top 15 competing.</TE>
<TE>   There's no guarantee of success, Kilburn admitted, adding that the
FIBT has made it clear: "If we appear to be weak or it's not a
successful event, we will be pulled subsequent to the games."</TE>
<TE>   "We know that we're sort of under a microscope, but I think we're
going to come out well," he said. "The sport has a very good future."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the original U.S. sledders, including the two who first
approached Flaherty--sisters Alexandra Powe-Allred and Michelle
Powe--have long left the sport. Even Warner, who vied for a spot on
the Olympic team, didn't make the cut.</TE>
<TE>   Yet through the efforts of people like her and Flaherty, other
women now have a chance at the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact we're in is a miracle," Flaherty said. "We defied the
odds. We were at the right place at the right time, and we had the
right combination of people.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, we're in. We're in, and we're going to deliver a quality
product."</TE>

<HD>With NFL Job Openings, There Is No Hire Love</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BOSWELL</AU>
<BD>THE WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you like to watch the titanic collision of huge NFL egos, this is
the month for you. If you enjoy seeing men reveal their true
character in the crucible of career-defining struggle, these may be
your favorite days. If you love self-congratulatory leaps into the
crowd and abject humiliation, then you're in heaven now.</LD>
<LD>   Who has mentioned anything about the NFL playoffs? We're talking
about the front-office hiring-and-firing sweepstakes that intoxicates
football this time of year. Every January, when owners, general
managers and coaches get to beat their chests, upstage the sport,
sign for the big bucks or make fools of themselves.</LD>
<LD>   The late Edward Bennett Williams, who owned the Redskins and later
the Orioles, once said, ''The only thing dumber than a football owner
is a smart baseball owner. I know. I've been both.''</LD>
<TE>   So, when you hear an NFL owner is deeply involved in deciding his
coach or general manager, start from the assumption that, whatever
his talents in business, when it comes to football, he's 50-50 to be
outwitted by a box of rocks. When you hear that the Redskins' Daniel
Snyder wants to be more involved in the direction of the team, like
Jerry Jones in Dallas, try to suppress laughter.</TE>
<TE>   Next, when analyzing all these NFL mega-moves, remember the words
of one furious NFL executive this season. Watching his team lose, he
yelled, ''If (our coach) wants to commit suicide, all he'd have to do
is jump from his ego to his I.Q.''</TE>
<TE>   In the NFL, all these high-level moves seem to be interlocking
pieces of one enormous puzzle. This year, the Redskins, or
ex-Redskins, are at the center of almost every hiring-firing tangle.
Yet, the most likely result is that the Redskins will end up back
almost exactly where they were before Norv Turner was fired.</TE>
<TE>   Snyder will still be the owner and Joe Mendes his salary cap
expert. And, once again, the team will have a certified offensive
genius as a coach. To say that Steve Spurrier has a better NFL mind
than Turner is a stretch. He may. Spurrier has to prove it. Turner
knew the league's personnel inside out. Spurrier has to learn it.
Turner built two Super Bowl champion offenses in Dallas and scored
tons of points, despite mediocre quarterbacks, in Washington.
Spurrier has won one college title and run up the score on plenty of
pigeons.</TE>
<TE>   To complete the parallel, Vinny Cerrato will be rehired as
personnel director by next week. Snyder didn't get his top choices
for GM, as they've either turned him down (Oakland's Bruce Allen) or
been lost, in the case of Bobby Beathard, because of a late-minute
breakdown of negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Beathard had his plane ticket to Washington. But then the old ''my
guy will call your guy to work out the details'' went sour. The
''guys'' turned off each other. Bobby did not return Dan's calls over
a weekend. Then Dan didn't return Bobby's calls. Money questions
arose. Faster than you can say, ''Bobby is back,'' the love affair
was over. Snyder-Beathard-Spurrier, now we'll never know.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Cerrato's back in the picture. When a fourth-year owner and
rookie NFL coach choose their personnel expert by default, that's
scary. That sure wasn't Snyder's Plan A. Once again, as in 2000, the
owner's perilously close to being GM.</TE>
<TE>   Cerrato's last two drafts as personnel director in San Francisco
were nothing to rave about. His 49er-quarterback-of-the-future, Jim
Druckenmiller, was last sighted in the XFL. In Washington, he drafted
LaVar Arrington and Chris Samuels in 2000. But, at No. 2 and 3, they
were America's picks. Cerrato's legacy was as one of the architects
of the $100 million gang that finished 8-8.</TE>
<TE>   The Redskins' GM search was typical in a month when few people got
the result they expected. Even Spurrier may have been surprised.
After quitting at Florida, he signed quickly with the Redskins. Would
he have taken more time--even the full ''month'' that he said he
expecte --if he'd thought he had a realistic shot at the Tampa Bay
job? However, like almost everybody in football, Spurrier assumed
Bill Parcells was unretiring to take the Bucs' post.</TE>
<TE>   There are 25 million reasons Spurrier would probably have taken
the Redskins' job even if he had been wooed by a Florida town he's
loved. But that doesn't make the Bucs feel any better. They take the
off-season prize for Most Egg On Face.</TE>
<TE>   Parcells, whose ego is as big as Jupiter, basked in the
will-he-or-won't-he attention, then stiffed the Bucs. The NFL was
stunned. Parcells' ''no'' was so unexpected that conspiracy theorists
are combing the wreckage for an angle. Does he want to be voted into
the Hall of Fame this year--he wouldn't be eligible as an active
coach--then come back next year, for more money, as the only Man From
Canton to coach in the NFL? At least that would be better than the
alternative theory: The Tuna smells like a mackerel.</TE>
<TE>   The Glazer family now looks like the cast of ''Dumb and Dumber.''
Bucs owner Malcolm Glazer fired respected Tony Dungy and cut the legs
out from under GM Rich McKay, one of the NFL's most admired
executives. All to court Parcells. Now, the Glazers have had to go
back to McKay and give him near total control just to straighten out
the mess they made.</TE>
<TE>   It's strange how the high-road guys, like McKay, Dungy and
ex-Redskin coach Marty Schottenheimer, always seem to land on their
feet somewhere. Dungy just got the Colts job; now he can try to build
a defense worthy of Peyton Manning. Schottenheimer looks like the
front-runner in San Diego. If he goes, then the Redskins will
probably lose the coordinator of their 10th-ranked defense, Kurt
Schottenheimer, who would be wiser to stay here and build a
reputation unconnected to his brother. But blood's thick.</TE>
<TE>   The NFL's mating dance isn't over. Oakland's cocky young coach,
Jon Gruden, and cranky old owner, Al Davis, may part ways. Gruden's
agent is making noises like he wants an exit visa. Davis doesn't like
people who want out. And that Bucs job still beckons.</TE>
<TE>   Stay tuned. It's a thing of beauty. It's the NFL in January. Put
your ear to the ground. Right now, somebody somewhere is saying,
''Just pay me, baby.''</TE>

<HD>Hornets fans turn anger toward owners</HD>
<DH>NBA: A potential move to New Orleans is the last straw for
Charlotte basketball fans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHARLOTTE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>The petition starts innocently enough as an open letter to NBA
commissioner David Stern. "We the people of Charlotte and the
Carolinas want the NBA to know that we want to keep professional
basketball in Charlotte," it reads.</LD>
<LD>   By the second paragraph, the bitterness between Charlotte's
basketball fans and Hornets co-owner George Shinn is made clear
through a laundry list of Shinn's actions over the years.</LD>
<LD>   From his civil trial on sexual assault charges--he won although
testimony exposed relationships with cheerleaders and other lurid
behavior--to his unwillingness to pay top dollar to keep free agents,
it's all listed and sums up the basketball situation in Charlotte:
The fans don't hate the Hornets, just the owners.</LD>
<TE>   "The legal issues Mr. Shinn has faced are great sources of
irritation for many of the fans I have talked to," said Pete Volk of
Charlotte, who is circulating the petition and hopes to have 15,000
signatures to give to the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to understand, this is the Bible belt and people don't
take kindly to airing your dirty laundry. ... His actions began the
tarnishing of Charlotte's good name and tuned many people out."</TE>
<TE>   The city seems on the verge of losing the team it loved
unequivocally for so many years. Shinn and co-owner Ray Wooldridge
have agreed to a lucrative deal to move the franchise to New Orleans
and only need NBA approval to seal the deal.</TE>
<TE>   The potential move--set in motion in June when voters
overwhelmingly rejected a referendum on a new arena--has left many
wondering what happened so quickly to sour what was once one of the
best NBA markets. Charlotte led the league in attendance seven
straight years and sold out 364 games over 10 seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a shame, quite honestly, because we're talking about a great
basketball market that from its inception and long past its honeymoon
period was the best market out there," said Mark Packer, host of
Charlotte's afternoon sports radio show.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a city that understands basketball, loves basketball, but
unfortunately has an ownership group who has thrown this market under
the bus and turned most everyone against the team."</TE>
<TE>   There's no doubt the situation is ugly. Callers to Packer's show
refer to the owners only as "Shinndridge," combining Shinn and
Wooldridge's names to create a two-headed monster.</TE>
<TE>   Fans have stayed away from The Hive in droves--fewer than 1,000
turned out on a snowy night earlier this month to watch the Hornets
beat the Golden State Warriors--and cite their disdain for ownership
as their reason for not supporting the team.</TE>
<TE>   "In the two years I've lived in Charlotte, all it has been from
ownership is threats to move," said fan John St. Martin, who wants to
buy season tickets but won't because the team has no long-term
commitment to the city.</TE>
<TE>   "I can take the grief because I love the team enough to still go
to games. But my friends and neighbors, they are so fed up with the
owners, I can't even give them tickets for free."</TE>
<TE>   With the level of animosity so high, and poor attendance and a
lack of luxury seating in the coliseum costing the team an estimated
$1 million a month in losses, it's no wonder Shinn and Wooldridge
want to leave.</TE>
<TE>   The Hornets said Shinn would have no comment about the petition.
Last month, he said relocating the franchise wasn't an easy decision.</TE>
<TE>   "How do you explain what something like this means? I grew up
right down the road, I came from nothing, but what can I do?" Shinn,
a native of nearby Kannapolis, told The Associated Press. "I don't
care how rich a person is, you can't sustain the losses and you have
to find a way to stop the bleeding.</TE>
<TE>   "So I guess you just have to build yourself up mentally on the
possibility that you might have to start all over again in a new
place, rebuild it all over again."</TE>
<TE>   But Charlotte isn't giving up without a fight, with many fans
believing that if the NBA refuses to let the team leave, the owners
will be forced to sell and the passion will return.</TE>
<TE>   So Packer has organized a "Celebrate Basketball" night for Feb.
15, urging residents to make The Hive buzz once again.</TE>
<TE>   The night is a tribute to a 17-year-old Indiana Pacers fan who
regularly called his show mocking Hornets fans for their lack of
support. Jeff Grey, dubbed "Indiana Jones Jr." on the show, died in a
car accident in November.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want this night to have anything to do with Ray or
George," Packer said. "Leave the signs hating them at home this one
night. Instead, let's use this one night to show that this is a great
basketball town and it always will be."</TE>
<TE>   The city, meanwhile, is working on its own deal for a new
arena--albeit without keeping Hornets ownership abreast of the
details.</TE>
<TE>   Two major banks and a utility have pledged $100 million for the
construction of a new arena, and the city will decide Feb. 11 if it
will match the funds. Mayor Pat McCrory has admitted the plans are
being presented to the NBA, not the team.</TE>
<TE>   It's his hope the NBA will view New Orleans as a quick-fix for the
franchise's financial woes and recognize Charlotte's commitment as a
long-term solution.</TE>
<TE>   "We firmly believe that the city of Charlotte is still the best
place for the Hornets and the facts prove that," McCrory said. "We've
got the corporate structure and fan base to support this team."</TE>
<TE>   The NBA has been clear on its stance that the ideal scenario is
for the Hornets to stay in Charlotte with a new arena. But some think
NBA ownership--only 15 of 29 owners need to approve the move--will
view New Orleans' deal as just too good to turn down.</TE>

<HD>Opposites Set to Collide For NFC Championship</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The teams that will play for the NFC championship in St. Louis today
are polar opposites. A big game, truthfully, seldom matches athletes
so different.</LD>
<LD>   Thus:</LD>
<LD>   * Philadelphia quarterback Donovan McNabb is a uniquely
unstructured master of the broken play. A sandlot type who has risen
to stardom in pro football, McNabb never knows where his next
touchdown is coming from.</LD>
<TE>   * Kurt Warner, by contrast, heads a Ram offense so highly
structured that he hasn't called an audible for three years. The Rams
rely, instead, on Coach Mike Martz's quick, scientifically
pre-planned precise plays.</TE>
<TE>   As coached by Andy Reid, the Eagles make good game plans, too, but
there's no evidence that McNabb has ever read one.</TE>
<TE>   A swift, gifted runner who passes well enough, he will give the
Rams a conspicuously different kind of game from last Sunday's. The
Green Bay Packers failed in St. Louis, 45-17, because, trying to keep
up with Warner, they borrowed the Rams' fast-paced, high-tech offense
for a day.</TE>
<TE>   Packer quarterback Brett Favre is good enough to do that, but not
without practicing it as long as Warner has. It was Favre's
unfamiliarity with his new offense--more than Ram defense--that led
to his six interceptions and a rout. McNabb may lose to the Rams,
too, but not that way.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Real MVP</TE>
<TE>   In the other conference title game Sunday, the Pittsburgh Steelers
will confront the surprising New England Patriots with a different
kind of passer-runner, Kordell Stewart, who is much more structured
than McNabb. In fact, Stewart, a seven-year veteran, has become
primarily a passer whose edge on New England passer Tom Brady is that
he's more experienced. An NFL sophomore, Brady, the league's best new
young quarterback since Warner was a sophomore, has the two things it
takes to fight the Steelers: He's unflappable and very quick
mentally. But he's never seen the complex Steeler blitz, which
figures to beat him.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart is the only visible difference this year in a Steeler team
that otherwise looks almost identical with any other Steeler team of
the last five or six years. What's changed in Pittsburgh is that
Stewart is now in the charge of a bright new quarterback coach, Tom
Clements, a personable lawyer who has taken Stewart's rudimentary
talent--a talent that was unseen by many as recently as last
year--and formed and furbished it, constantly reminding him that he's
the greatest. Stewart needed that.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, Clements, the Notre Dame man who was fourth in the 1974
Heisman Trophy voting, is the real Steeler MVP this year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It was an Interception</TE>
<TE>   The fumble play, so-called, that Brady rode to victory over the
Oakland Raiders last Saturday night, 16-13, was incorrectly ruled on
the field. Instant replay confirmed that under NFL rules, it was
really an incomplete pass. The evidence is irrefutable. That is
exactly why the NFL has instant replay. And the reversal was exactly
what Referee Walt Coleman should have done. It's possible to argue
with the rule but not with the referee. The Raiders, unhappily, were
the victims--in the same sense that second-place sprinters in Olympic
races are victims. They lose. The true victims would have been the
Patriots if Coleman had lacked the courage to reverse himself.</TE>
<TE>   The blizzard in which the game was played was considerably more
instructive than the officiating to the NFL's many conservative
coaches--if they were paying attention--providing a memorable lesson
in how to succeed in winter weather. The lesson is that continuous
passing is not only possible in such conditions, it's the best way to
win. It's how the Patriots won--not on faulty instant-replay
interpretations but by repetitiously throwing the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland believed in passing, too, for awhile, opening a 7-0
halftime lead on quarterback Rich Gannon's 50-yard pass-play drive
ending in his good throw to wide receiver James Jett, who was open in
the end zone 13 yards away. Then the Raiders went into a shell.</TE>
<TE>   The irony of the game is that New England's coaches, who in the
first half obviously feared to throw the ball in the snowstorm, had
no recourse but to throw it in the second half, when, as the snow
piled up underfoot, the Raiders cautiously advanced into a 13-3 lead.
Thereafter, Brady, the coolest customer on the field if the
youngest--younger by far than the Raiders--was authorized to throw
pass after pass after pass. And he completed pass after pass after
pass, usually on first down or second down, once or twice on third
down, and once on fourth and four.</TE>
<TE>   As the Raiders continued to run it, for the most part, Brady
passed his way to a touchdown and then two field goals on three
immense drives through the driving snow, starting twice from his
20-yard line and once from the Patriot 34. He scored once on a
scramble and then set up the two makable field goals that first tied
and then beat veteran Oakland quarterback Gannon, who, given the
green light himself in the first half, would have routed the Patriots
with good passes, most likely, before Brady's coaches got with it.</TE>
<TE>   More likely than that, it would have been a shootout if BOTH
coaching staffs had come out throwing --- a shootout in the snow. Are
the NFL's legions of conservative coaches teachable?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fine Hugh Douglas</TE>
<TE>   Sandlot football reached an all-time high in the other game
Saturday when the Eagles' brilliant, unconventional quarterback,
McNabb, eliminated the better team, the Chicago Bears, 33-19.</TE>
<TE>   Like an enthusiastic kid, McNabb ran around or away from Bear
linemen and linebackers--on every decisive play--as, at the same
time, his receivers ran around or away from Chicago's defensive
backs. And when, every now and then, an Eagle receiver popped open
while McNabb was scrambling, he saw the target instantly, stopped,
turned, and fired.</TE>
<TE>   This process, which, on smoky autumn afternoons, you can see on
thousands of American street corners or nearby vacant lots, led the
Eagles to enough field goals and touchdowns to bury Chicago's
defensive team, which is probably the NFL's finest.</TE>
<TE>   That is the surest way to beat a great defense. For, as the Rams
will discover Sunday, there is no scientific way to defend against
that kind of quarterback. Nothing meaningful is possible defensively
when the opposing passer is the fastest runner on the team, as well
as the slickest scrambler in the NFL, and one of the physically
strongest when cornered. To beat him, all you can do is outscore him
with your offensive team.</TE>
<TE>   That option was denied to the Bears when, on the dirtiest move of
the NFL season, Eagle defensive end Hugh Douglas eliminated Bear
quarterback Jim Miller on the fourth play of Saturday's second
quarter. After an interception, Douglas looked up Miller, ostensibly
to block him but actually to wrestle him down and pound him into the
ground.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas' intention can be read into his actions by the way he
acted. Starting his move on Miller, Douglas gripped him firmly with
both hands--an illegal block in some interpretations--and held him up
until he could turn him, whereupon he drove the quarterback into the
frozen turf on his passing shoulder, which separated. That's how
Chicago lost. And for that, the NFL should fine Douglas every dollar
he makes in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Same Old Steelers</TE>
<TE>   The Steelers showed in the first game Sunday that they have the
right mix of offense and defense to turn back the Patriots today.
Although some of his players are new, Coach Bill Cowher appears to
again be in charge of the same kind of team precisely that he's had
at Pittsburgh for many years--plus a revised Kordell Stewart..</TE>
<TE>   With Stewart now in command of the offense--which blocks with the
same discipline and fervor of any Cowher offense--and with a
typically aggressive, punishing Cowher defense, the Steelers opened a
10-0 lead against Baltimore in the first quarter, added 10 points in
the second quarter, and put the Ravens away in the third quarter with
a solid 83-yard drive to win, 27-10, knocking the defending champions
of the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   If the Steelers have a fault this year, it's their reluctance to
take full advantage of Stewart's unique talents.</TE>
<TE>   In the Baltimore game, as usual, they kept him under cover through
a 20-3 first half in which the Ravens were so inept that it didn't
much matter. In the second half, Cowher's people found more for
Stewart to do--once running him on draw plays twice in a row. To any
defense, Stewart comes across as one of the most dangerous opponents
in the league. One year, Cowher featured him on sweeps led by two
pulling guards, and that year Stewart twice swept end on
long-distance touchdown runs of 40 yards or so.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Team of All-Stars</TE>
<TE>   The Rams showed in the night game Sunday that their coach, Martz,
has assembled a team of all-stars this year--a team with all-star
excellence on defense as well as offense and, as well, in the kicking
game.</TE>
<TE>   To begin with, there's quarterback Warner, who outplayed Favre in
a 24-10 first half that left the Packers with breathing room if they
could have just scored first in the second half, gaining some
momentum. They couldn't. Martz, known as an offensive innovator, has
shown this year that he's an all-star coach himself. Wanting more
defense than the Rams have exhibited in recent years, he not only
fired eight of last year's defensive starters but also used his first
three draft picks last April on de When you see the Rams this year,
you're first seeing Martz's splendidly designed offense, true, but
what you're also finding is that, in addition, he understands the big
picture well enough to make the right defensive moves when he has to.
That's a hall-of-fame achievement.</TE>

<HD>Church To Play a Role In Games</HD>
<DH>Olympics: The influence of the Mormon church will be
omnipresent, but it doesn't want to appear to heavy handed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>When the first Mormon settlers wandered into the Salt Lake Valley in
1847, they were on the run from public scrutiny, seeking to be left
alone with their religion and polygamous lifestyle.</LD>
<LD>   Now, with the Winter Games set to begin in Salt Lake City on Feb.
8, the Mormons are again being scrutinized</LD>
<LD>   Critics have accused Utah's dominant religion of exploiting the
opportunity to be the host of an Olympics, while nervous organizers
have struggled to keep the focus on the games.</LD>
<TE>   The Mormons themselves have a different view. To them, it's all in
God's hands.</TE>
<TE>   After all, church founder Joseph Smith himself prophesied that his
followers would build the New Jerusalem in the mountains, explains
Elder Henry B. Eyring, one of the governing 12 apostles in The Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</TE>
<TE>   "It goes clear back to the book of Isaiah, which says that Zion
would be established at the tops of the mountains and that the
nations of the world would come there," Eyring said. "Here we are in
the tops of the mountains and people are coming up to see us. In a
sense we expected it. Only the prophecies didn't say anything about
downhill skiing."</TE>
<TE>   To some, the idea of Olympics as divine prophecy might seem
absurd. But since the church's founding in upstate New York in 1830,
members have believed that God set them apart from the rest of the
world.</TE>
<TE>   Even today, when the church has 11 million members and is one of
the world's fastest-growing faiths, Mormons still proudly call
themselves, in the words of their president, "a peculiar people."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we've changed at all. We're as peculiar as ever,"
Eyring said. "But we're getting larger and there are a lot more
people who are as peculiar as we are. It's not as easy to laugh the
church away."</TE>
<TE>   It will be especially difficult during the Olympics, when the pale
granite spires of the Mormon temple provide a backdrop for medal
ceremonies, to be held at a plaza donated by the church. But most
fans won't be able to see the inside of the building: Non-Mormons are
barred from entering.</TE>
<TE>   Although the mountains will be the real symbol of the games, NBC
vice president David Neal said, the lights of Temple Square will
certainly appear on camera.</TE>
<TE>   "If we were doing the Olympic Games in Rome, the Vatican is
something that you would see from time to time," Neal said. "That's
really the case here in Salt Lake."</TE>
<TE>   The church, which claims 70 percent of Utah's population as
members, doesn't just dominate the skyline. The state's governor, two
senators and three congressmen are Mormon, as is 90 percent of the
state Legislature. Church members dominate boardrooms, school boards,
and even the alcohol control bureau that designed the state's
sometimes Byzantine liquor laws.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the Salt Lake City Games probably have the greatest
emphasis on religion since the modern Olympics began, said William
Baker, a history professor at the University of Maine who wrote the
book, "If Christ Came to the Olympics."</TE>
<TE>   "On the one hand, you have the concern of Salt Lake City that it
project itself not as a Mormon town but a modern city," Baker said.
On the other, there's "the concern of the Mormons who hope that for
God's sake, people will forget polygamy and racism as their heritage.
The Mormons are trying to airbrush these realities in their history."</TE>
<TE>   When Utah was awarded the Olympics, the church began a public
relations blitz that included sending out lists of story ideas to
some of the 9,000 members of the media expected during the 17 days of
the games.</TE>
<TE>   But since then, the church has backed off, dropping plans to pour
millions of dollars into TV advertising and pulling missionaries from
downtown streets and hotels. Mormon volunteers at Temple Square and
residents putting up families of athletes have been warned to refer
questions about religion to church experts.</TE>
<TE>   "They're trying to do things with a light touch," said Stephen
Pace, an activist for openness in the games and one of the church's
most outspoken critics. "But in Utah politics, culture, economics,
everything, the Mormon church is the 800-pound gorilla. It's kind of
stupid to think that it's going to turn into an 87-pound figure
skater for the duration of the games."</TE>
<TE>   Even those watching at home will probably learn something about
Mormons, who traditionally believe, among other things, that Jesus
Christ visited the New World after the resurrection; that the Book of
Mormon is a third testament of the Bible; that God was once a man;
and that men who live right can be elevated to godhood.</TE>
<TE>   They say that families can be reunited after death, and they
research their genealogies to find dead ancestors who can be baptized
retroactively. They have made mission work a priority: There are
60,000 Mormon missionaries on the job today, from the iconic young
men on bicycles to elderly couples who spend their days doing temple
service in foreign lands.</TE>
<TE>   Mormons in good standing avoid alcohol, tobacco and coffee because
Joseph Smith declared them unhealthy. They donate 10 percent of their
income to the church, or face losing access to the temple. They
believe their president is a living prophet, and they volunteer as
church leaders because there are no professional clergy. They dress
modestly, in part to cover up the special underclothes that adults
wear every day of their lives.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the darker issues in the church's past also grew out of
the religion. Polygamy, for example, was based on Smith's declaration
that men with more than one wife were given special standing in the
afterlife.</TE>
<TE>   The Mormon church outlawed the practice more than a century ago as
a condition for Utah statehood, but the theology behind it hasn't
changed. And today, an estimated 50,000 people around the West, many
who say they follow true Mormonism, still practice polygamy.</TE>
<TE>   Until 1978 the religion barred people of African descent from the
priesthood, customarily granted to boys at age 12 and the
prerequisite for all church offices.</TE>
<TE>   So, while the games are giving the church an opportunity to
explain themselves, they're also calling attention to the church's
past, which could backfire, said Jan Shipps, a non-Mormon scholar and
author of "Sojourner in the Promised Land: Forty Years among the
Mormons."</TE>
<TE>   "There's been a tremendous amount of publicity," Shipps said.
"Many people know more about Mormonism than they knew before. But
what the perception will be as a result of the Olympics remains to be
seen."</TE>

<DH>The hero of Dickens' 'Nicholas Nickleby' pursues fairness
and justice in a new movie adaptation on the Bravo network.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of Martyn Edward Hesford's primary goals in tackling a four-hour
adaptation of Charles Dickens' "The Life and Adventures of Nicholas
Nickleby" for television was to make it palatable for mass audiences
while not dumbing down the novel.</LD>
<LD>   "What you have to remember with Dickens is that he's been dressed
up over the years," says the screenwriter, a former actor who never
read a Dickens novel until his 20s. "But he was a commercial writer.
He was a contemporary writer, writing about things that were
happening in the day. He appealed to everybody because of his sense
of humor, which is absolutely malicious. The comedy comes from the
characters. The comedy reveals things about those characters--their
pretensions and their truths. It is satire, to some extent."</LD>
<LD>   A co-production of Bravo, where the miniseries will be broadcast
in two parts this week, and the ITV channel in England, where it was
seen last Easter, "Nicholas Nickleby" revolves around a penniless,
good-hearted hero (James D'Arcy) whom Dickens describes as a "young
man of impetuous temper and little or no experience."</LD>
<TE>   In financial straits, Nicholas, his mother and beloved sister must
seek help from their vile, miserly Uncle Ralph (Charles Dance). Uncle
Ralph procures Nicholas a job as a teacher at a Yorkshire school
where the headmaster, Mr. Squeers (Gregor Fisher), mistreats the
children. Within weeks, Nicholas flees the school with one of the
students--the slow, deformed, angelic Smike (Lee Ingleby).</TE>
<TE>   Despite incredible obstacles and the machinations of his uncle,
Nicholas manages to make a home for his family, falls in love and
even saves his sister (Sophia Myles) from the clutches of the
loathsome Sir Mulberry Hawk (Dominic West).</TE>
<TE>   "Nicholas Nickleby" hasn't been adapted for film or TV as often as
such Dickens works as "David Copperfield," "Great Expectations" and
"A Christmas Carol." The first film version was released in 1912.
Thirty-five years later, the great Alberto Cavalcanti ("Dead of
Night") directed a British production starring Derek Bond as
Nickleby. Twenty years ago, a filmed version of the landmark Royal
Shakespeare Company's stage production, starring Roger Rees, played
in syndication.</TE>
<TE>   Before writing "Nicholas Nickleby," which like all of his novels
were serialized in newspapers and magazines, Dickens and his
illustrator, Hablot Browne (a.k.a. Phiz), traveled the Yorkshire
countryside incognito in early 1838 to see firsthand the cheap
boarding schools for boys. They stopped at the Bowes Academy, where
several boys had died or had become blind due to neglect and
mistreatment. Bowes Academy became the model for the novel's
Dotheboys Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Though the novel is more than 160 years old, Hesford says that its
underlying themes remain very relevant today. "I think a lot of the
things it deals with have not really changed today, which is the
business world and the worship of money and the abuse of children.
Today we worship fame and things. People feel they need to be famous.
In 'Nicholas Nickleby,' you are nothing without a position. That is
what I got from the novel. It is my interpretation of it. I am not an
intellectual."</TE>
<TE>   Bravo stepped in as a co-producer after reading Hesford's
adaptation. "The script read extremely well," says Frances Berwick,
senior vice president of programming and production for the cable
channel.</TE>
<TE>   It felt like it had "something for everybody," she says. "The
interesting thing about Dickens is that he has sort of come full
circle. He was the soap opera writer of his times, serialized in the
papers, and then he seems to have taken on this image of 'heavy'
reading. This adaptation, I think, will introduce viewers to a
fantastic classic that not that many people are familiar with."</TE>
<TE>   Part 1 of "The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby" can be
seen Tuesday at 5 and 7 p.m. on Bravo, and Part 2 on Wednesday at 5
and 7 p.m. The network has rated it TV-PG (may be inappropriate for
young children). The miniseries is available on video and DVD from
Acorn Media.</TE>

<HD>The Right Route for the 91</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the beginning, there was an idea that a private toll road would
provide new pavement that the public sector couldn't afford alongside
the Orange County section of the Riverside Freeway. Riverside County
had needed more space on its end of the freeway too, but took a
different tack, building conventional carpool lanes financed by
public initiative. In a tale of two counties' different approaches to
the same need, the seeds of conflict were planted.</LD>
<LD>   It later became clear that to get the toll road on the Orange
County side, there was a price in road congestion and the flexibility
to address it. When the operator of the 91 Express Lanes wanted to
sell the road in 1999, it was revealed that Caltrans had delayed
planned upgrades of its freeway land for years as part of an earlier
legal settlement to avoid hurting the business of the private
operator.</LD>
<LD>   The 91 Express Lanes became one of the most expensive tollways in
the country, and the tolls could continue to be raised as the lanes
became more attractive to riders. It was quite a  deal, offering
financial protection for the operator and inconvenience for the
public. Freeway riders who might have hoped for expanded free lanes
found themselves in a bind.</LD>
<TE>   This month, the problem of how to improve those public lanes  came
home to roost. The Orange County Transportation Authority literally
paid its way out of a jam. It agreed to spend a whopping $4million
just to add a sixth lane along only 1,000 yards of westbound freeway
east of Coal Canyon Road. That's hard-won yardage at a price that
even a Super Bowl contender would think twice about paying to advance
the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County was frustrated enough to consider a $4-million
payment as fair compromise to get started on public improvements. The
silver lining is that if the Orange County Transportation Authority
later buys the toll road as an alternative to further incremental
payouts, the $4million would be money down.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the entire public-private relationship in Orange
County has miffed Riverside County, which paid for its own carpool
lanes without conditions on public road improvements. Since many
Riverside riders must pass through Orange County on their routes to
and from work, they have been affected by the same delays on the
freeway and high cost on the toll road.</TE>
<TE>   That county is now suing Caltrans and the tollway on the grounds
that the special agreement allows the private operator to exploit its
franchise agreement.</TE>
<TE>   The two counties should now look for areas of compromise in ending
the litigation and resolving the impasse over the ability to make
improvements on the Orange County side. Supervisor Tom Mullen of
Riverside County has seemed to indicate that some opening to make
peace exists by observing that Orange County at least now has done
something to solve the congestion problem.</TE>
<TE>   The $4 million is an expensive lesson, but this is what can happen
as a result of the kind of exclusive agreement that is made without
fully anticipating consequences. Orange County is taking action now,
but earlier it failed to think through the restrictions that would
bind it by not building the lanes itself. The county now is in the
awkward position of trying to unravel an old problem.</TE>
<TE>   The free lanes never should have been put in such jeopardy. But
the question now is what next?</TE>
<TE>   Buying the lanes would be costly, and public ownership surely
would not be desirable solely as a means to bail out a financially
troubled private operator. But the $4million as down payment would be
a start. Public ownership would give transportation officials
flexibility to make road improvements that they should have had all
along. And they would control the future of the roadway.</TE>
<TE>   Owning the roads would allow transportation officials to decide
whether to have general flow lanes, or carpool lanes, or even whether
to maintain the tolls for a time. Public ownership of the private
lane also would make it easier to resolve the problem with Riverside
County.</TE>
<TE>   Four million dollars for 1,000 yards has been another wake-up call
on the problems with the 91 Express Lanes exclusivity arrangement.
When negotiating a sale price, Orange County needs to guard its
pocketbook and remember that the operator is in financial difficulty.
Don't build in a handsome profit for them while getting them off the
hook. But buying the lanes at a fair price well may be preferable to
paying huge amounts on a piecemeal basis to build road by the
thousands of yards.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Legislature, wanting to give more impact to California in the
national presidential primary picture, moved California's primary
election from June to March. What complicates this ill-advised move
is that the much shorter primary season seems to be getting off to a
slow start in Orange County's post-holiday January activities.</LD>
<LD>   Nearing the end of January, with only five weeks remaining before
the March 5 elections, the public doesn't seem to have awakened to
the election season as yet. At least that's what some candidates have
been running into on the campaign trail. That poses some practical
problems for the nonpartisan local government races on the primary
ballot in Orange County. Nominees obviously face a much longer, and
perhaps more expensive, general election campaign period because of
the earlier election date. But in some key county races, including
the district attorney, 4th District seat on the Board of Supervisors,
two county school board posts and a judicial seat, the primary
election is between only two candidates. That means the voting in
March in those contests will be like the November general election.
The results will be final.</LD>
<TE>   That puts added urgency not only on the candidates, but also on
voters. It also means that any incumbent who loses outright on the
March ballot, with no runoff race in November, will have a long
10-month lame-duck period between the last election and term's end.
Residents are left to worry whether that extended period will lead to
more months of disinterest and poorer government service.</TE>
<TE>   Candidates are concerned not only with getting their messages out
to voters but also with getting voter attention in the new, shorter
primary time frame. Sample ballots with candidate campaign statements
started going in the mail Thursday. Absentee ballots will be
available starting Feb. 4. Feb. 18 is the last day for residents to
register to vote in the primary.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't leave too much time before election day for
candidates to get out their messages and for voters to get to know
the candidates and issues before they must make their marks on the
ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The new early primary system, and the need for informed choices
and good local government, means time is important for candidates and
voters alike. Let's make the most of the weeks ahead.</TE>

<HD>Living Up to Officer Ochoa</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Earlier this month, after nearly eight months of investigation by the
Orange County Sheriff's Department and district attorney, prosecutors
decided that the tragic circumstances surrounding the shooting death
of a man by Huntington Beach police didn't warrant criminal charges
against the officer.</LD>
<LD>   That may end the local police probe, but an FBI investigation and
federal civil rights lawsuit are pending.</LD>
<LD>   The shooting May 5 occurred when officers chasing a crime suspect
saw 18-year-old Antonio Saldivar peering into a truck. Police said
Saldivar didn't respond to requests in English and Spanish to raise
his hands but instead turned around and pointed a rifle at the
pursuing officer, who shot him. The rifle was later found to be a
toy.</LD>
<TE>   The incident sparked a protest from residents in Oakview, one of
the poorest and most heavily populated Latino neighborhoods in the
city. For years before the tragic shooting of Saldivar, police had
reached into the neighborhood trying to improve communications. Those
efforts helped in the shooting aftermath.</TE>
<TE>   One of the major forces in building a better bridge between police
and Oakview was Lt. Luis Ochoa. He was the department's first Mexican
American officer, and the Oakview neighborhood was one of his prime
projects.</TE>
<TE>   Ochoa is credited with helping control the gangs and drug deals
that plagued the area. He was also instrumental in the opening of a
police substation and day laborer employment center in the
neighborhood. He even read stories to children at the library. But
most important is the one-on-one link that police efforts such as
Ochoa's can provide.</TE>
<TE>   Just five days after the release of the district attorney's
decision, Ochoa retired after 37 years of service. Aside from his
outstanding contributions, an indication of how much he will be
missed in community outreach efforts is the fact that only 12 of the
230 Huntington Beach officers are Spanish-speaking.</TE>
<TE>   Ochoa's retirement and the district attorney's closure of the
shooting probe put added emphasis on the need for constant
communications and contact between police and the community they
serve.</TE>

<LD>Re "Critics Question Legality of County Talks," Jan. 15:</LD>
<LD>   For some time, Times editorial writers have been calling upon
Orange County leaders to set aside differences and find ways to work
together to solve the housing, transportation, and water quantity and
quality problems facing this region.</LD>
<LD>   Yet when 65 board and staff members from various county agencies
recently attended an intensive two-day leadership symposium at the
UCLA Conference Center at Lake Arrowhead, The Times did not applaud
their efforts. Instead, its news story speculated that they might be
violating the Brown Act at what had once been a yacht club.</LD>
<TE>   The Brown Act is California's open and public meeting law. It
requires that items intended for discussion by a public agency at a
meeting be listed and described on an agenda, that the agenda be
posted at least 72 hours in advance of the meeting, and that the
public be given ample opportunity to comment on the items and to take
part in their discussion.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Leadership Symposium was announced in November,
more than six weeks ago, and was open to the public. Facilitated by
four internationally known consultants, it was designed to help
participants develop the specific leadership skills, personal
insights and professional relationships (both interpersonal and
interagency) needed to encourage creative approaches and eventually
result in the types of regional solutions The Times has wisely
championed.</TE>
<TE>   Conferences, seminars and symposiums are specifically exempted
from provisions of the Brown Act (Section 54952.2(c)(2)). For this
reason, it is especially unfortunate that, on what must have been a
very slow news day, The Times chose to spend more than 22 column
inches casting doubt on what was a legitimate first step in a process
intended to yield lasting countywide benefit.</TE>

<LD>Re "Drawing a Bead on Gun Sales," Jan. 14:</LD>
<LD>   How can we make Irvine a safer place to live? It's already a
nuclear-free zone. What now? How about a scheme in which responsible
citizens cannot obtain guns for self-defense?</LD>
<LD>   Contrary to assertions by the so-called anti-violence groups, the
availability of legal firearms has nothing to do with the incidence
of violent crime. If the City Council wants to reduce gun violence,
it should look to disarm criminals.</LD>
<TE>   And what about the 2nd Amendment? Here's another thing those
anti-violence analysts ignore: All of the evidence indicates that the
2nd Amendment, like other parts of the Bill of Rights, applies to and
protects individual Americans.</TE>

<LD>Re "Successful Transit (Not CenterLine)," Commentary, Jan. 20:</LD>
<LD>   Steven Frates believes that the solution to transportation
problems is highways and more highways, with a monorail thrown in for
good measure. He points to congestion reduction from Measure M
freeway improvements and the toll roads. He is arguably right in the
short term, but what happens when these improvements fill up? Will we
take more and more land to satisfy the automobile's insatiable
appetite for space, or will we use existing transportation
facilities, and very limited additional facilities, more efficiently?</LD>
<LD>   Frates points to West Los Angeles as often having gridlock because
of lack of freeways. I have traveled in West Los Angeles during rush
hours. It is often slow, but traffic does move. The Beverly Hills and
Laurel Canyon freeways, once planned to serve this area, were deleted
because of immense cost and potential for catastrophic neighborhood
damage.</LD>
<TE>   Today the buildings the roads would have taken provide businesses,
homes and tax revenue, not noise, barriers and air pollution. West
Los Angeles is one of the few places in Southern California where
densities justify rail transit, and heavy rail transit at that: the
MTA should extend the Red Line to Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County does not now have the densities to justify rail
transit, but it needs a commitment to building an efficient yet
attractive and competitive public transportation system. The Orange
County Transportation Authority's latest plans do include Bus Rapid
Transit, which suggests that some people there are thinking along
more reasonable lines than the autopia addicts, monorail maniacs and
trolley jollies.</TE>
<TE>   Robert P. Sechler</TE>
<TE>   Cypress</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Frates is correct--Measure M has been effective at improving
traffic bottlenecks--but it should be noted that Measure M is not
threatened by the CenterLine project. Much of the CenterLine funding
comes from federal grants that OCTA otherwise would not receive.
Furthermore, light rail would complement the bus system and
long-range commuter rail programs in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Light rail is expensive to build, but its maintenance costs per
rider are often less than bus service, and light rail attracts a
broader base of ridership. The monorail system to the Inland Empire
is under consideration, as a regional program that falls under the
Southern California Assn. of Governments and outside the exclusive
purview of OCTA. CenterLine does not in any way stall or prohibit the
construction of a regional monorail or "maglev" system.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, a high-speed rail line connecting San Francisco,
Sacramento, Los Angeles, San Diego and Orange County is in the works
by the California High Speed Rail Authority and could potentially
relieve more than 10% of air travel in California.</TE>
<TE>   Emerging transportation solutions involve far more than building
roads. The toll roads through eastern and southern Orange County have
done an excellent job at accelerating sprawl and opening up new areas
for development, but not at reducing traffic. One must look at the
dramatic increase in congestion along South County arterials to fully
evaluate the failure of our toll roads.</TE>
<TE>   There is no single solution to our traffic problems, but the
CenterLine is part of the solution.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Koontz</TE>
<TE>   Orange</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Frates makes a number of important points regarding Orange
County's poor return in capturing state transportation dollars. To
compound the situation, it should also be mentioned that California
in general receives less than it generates in federal tax dollars.
The blame can be put only on the poor representation we get in the
state and Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Frates also points out the CenterLine further compounds our
problems by drawing away what money there is on a very ineffective
solution. But then he proposes a high-speed rail line from John Wayne
to Ontario. I wonder where the studies are that show this to be a
better or more effective system.</TE>
<TE>   If such studies exist, I propose the system be funded like the
toll roads. Let it pay for itself. Why should tollway commuters pay
heavily while train riders get access to the tax dollars that
subsidize transit? If the rail can pay for itself, I'm for it. But
I'm betting it won't even come close.</TE>

<LD>Re "Man Jailed 2 Years Sees Case Voided," Jan. 12:</LD>
<LD>   I could not help but feel sorry for George Lopez, the young man
who was wrongly jailed for armed robbery. I was disturbed, however,
to read that Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas didn't seem to think that
similar cases in which the system broke down should be examined so
this doesn't happen again.</LD>
<LD>   What is the harm in studying your procedures to see if you can
prevent this kind of heartbreak? Even if it's your election opponent
who suggests such a review, if it's a good idea, why not adopt it?</LD>
<TE>   We trust our law enforcement officials to protect the innocent,
not prosecute them.</TE>
<TE>   If they made a mistake, why not just apologize and work hard not
to let it happen again? There's no weakness in that, Mr.
Rackauckas--it's just the right thing to do.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "What if Someone Went Looking for Your Nuggets?," Jan. 16:</LD>
<LD>   Dana Parson's recent column about the Carl's Jr. commercial is a
fair, well-done article. It may seem absurd to find wrong in a
commercial that is obviously intending to be humorous, not offensive,
but is it really so absurd to object to the poking and prodding of an
animal that in many studies has been found to be both an intelligent
and sensitive creature.</LD>
<LD>   Objectifying animals leads to mistreatment, just as objectifying
humans does. Perhaps if chickens were not just considered "nugget"
and egg-emitting machines, their horrific treatment on factory farms,
as well as in commercials, could improve.</LD>
<TE>   Theresa Noble</TE>
<TE>   Bryn Mawr, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dana Parsons writes a fair column on the campaign by United
Poultry Concerns to get Carl's Jr. restaurant to pull its TV ad
depicting grown men searching for a live chicken's "nuggets." The
idea that such an advertisement is demeaning to chickens may be
laughed off by some, but it is important to realize the extent to
which our treatment of animals is a result of portrayal of them in
the media.</TE>
<TE>   This advertisement essentially says to the public that chickens
are to be thought of as mere commodities, not as living, feeling
beings. Perhaps this is why the poultry industry makes so little
effort to treat these animals with any compassion.</TE>
<TE>   Chickens are raised in such filthy, cramped conditions that they
can't even stretch their wings for their entire lives. Many are
starved for up to two weeks to artificially induce the egg-laying
process. In slaughterhouses, many chickens miss the killing blade and
are boiled alive. Perhaps if we had more respect for chickens as a
society, we would be more willing to treat them with respect as
feeling, sentient beings.</TE>

<LD>Re "Seeking to Silence Dissent at Leisure World," Jan. 18:</LD>
<LD>   As a person who will one day seek Leisure World's environment, I'd
like it to keep its "no dog" policy in place. I live in a high-rise
apartment building in Los Angeles. The dogs bark and bite and have
destroyed the common areas. This is what AB 860 could mean to Leisure
World.</LD>
<LD>   With a close eye on a growing senior citizenry, the pet food
industry saw an opportunity to increase its billion-dollar-a-year
revenues. How? Sneak into our Legislature through a back door with
lies and have Gov. Gray Davis sign into law AB 860. This bill is bad
public policy for Californians. It was initially written for dogs to
be welcomed into mobile homes, but along the way big money stepped in
from pet food companies and the bill was blown up to accommodate the
new financial sponsors.</LD>
<TE>   The well being of thousands of Californians who wish to live in
"no dog" apartment buildings, condominiums and Leisure World has been
stampeded by AB 860.</TE>
<TE>   Please leave the "no dog" policy in place at Seal Beach Leisure
World. And please contact Davis to amend this ugly bill.</TE>

<HD>Riverside Freeway Fix Comes at a High Cost</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Buying Toll Lanes Might Be the Way to Go," Jan. 19:</LD>
<LD>   Once again we see that government cannot provide a cost-effective
solution. In this case the problem is increasing congestion on the
Riverside Freeway due to growth in the Inland Empire.</LD>
<LD>   The solution suggested by the Orange County Transportation
Authority is to buy the tollway lanes so that OCTA can increase
freeway capacity without having to make periodic payments to the
current owners of these lanes.</LD>
<TE>   The Times reports, "There has been speculation that the lanes are
worth $200 million to $300 million. They were built for $135
million." Thus, if OCTA buys the lanes, taxpayers will pay $65
million to $165 million more than necessary.</TE>
<TE>   As long as government officials are spending our money rather than
their own, they have no incentive to spend efficiently. By the way,
we read in the first paragraph of the article, "After paying $4
million in public funds ... for the right to widen the
traffic-clogged Riverside Freeway, OCTA leaders now say they must buy
the tollway or risk being nickeled and dimed for years to come."</TE>
<TE>   If making periodic payments of $4million is only being nickeled
and dimed, I'm sure OCTA would be willing to make periodic payments
of $4million to me. After all, it's not coming out of their pockets.</TE>
<TE>   Rod Freed</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So Orange County wants to hand the Express Lane owners $4million
to extend a lane to the Coal Canyon Road exit. This is an interesting
exit to spend money to extend because it is a rarely used offramp,
especially in the morning. The exit provides access to a few vacant
parcels of land, a quarry and an alternate access to Santa Ana Canyon
Road (which has little westbound traffic in the a.m.). Anyone who
works in the Anaheim Hills or Yorba Linda area would exit at the
earliest at Weir Canyon/Yorba Linda Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   The solution appears to be shortsighted and should prove to be
ineffective. It will probably serve only to push the bottleneck 1,000
feet to the west.</TE>
<TE>   Cindy Thomas</TE>
<TE>   Corona</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hindsight is 20/20. Now we can see that the tollway concept in
Orange County was doomed from the start. Just like last year's
electricity scam, halfway privatization doesn't work. Industry
management has to be dogged about profits; if not, they're being
irresponsible.</TE>
<TE>   But private interest and public interest often collide. And when
they do, the public picks up the tab. Along the 91, we pay to correct
unsafe alignments that the toll lanes themselves create. The San
Joaquin Hills and Eastern corridors have never provided the general
relief touted by the Transportation Corridor Agencies. The tollways
are money losers and always will be as long as freeways provide
alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   Soon we'll have to bribe TCA to correct problems on the Santa Ana
Freeway. Transportation planning is a public process. Cash out these
would-be road moguls while we still can; they have far too much power
over issues of public safety and commerce.</TE>

<LD>Re "Garofalo's Sorry Example," Editorial, Jan. 20:</LD>
<LD>   While accurate in its charges, the editorial does not paint the
complete portrait of malfeasance that citizens of Huntington Beach
were able to observe.</LD>
<LD>   To many environmentalists and neighborhood groups, Garofalo was an
obedient water boy for business and development interests. This irked
citizens as much as any personal profit from his conflicts of
interest.</LD>
<TE>   To some extent, the local election results of 2000 were a
testament to the outrage that community members felt at being patsies
for corporate fat cats and outside special interests. Garofalo was
the unabashed poster boy for the pro-business lobby in our city. Two
reformers, including Mayor Debbie Cook, were elected over
pro-business and special-interest-backed candidates.</TE>
<TE>   The perception remains that Garofalo's excesses in office were
tied to his water-boy role. This is the perception that other
politicians must watch out for. We all should be on the lookout to
prevent water boys from corrupting our local governments in the
future.</TE>

<HD>Pollution Becomes an El Toro Issue</HD>

<LD>Re "Report on El Toro's Toxic Soil Debated," Jan. 17:</LD>
<LD>   Backers of an airport at El Toro--struggling to salvage their
unpopular project--have turned pollution into a political issue.
Because there are pockets of hazardous material in the soil at El
Toro, they propose that we make matters worse and build an airport.
If the land is dirty, they would leave it dirty--and add airport
pollution on top of what already exists.</LD>
<LD>   The worst risk that we face at El Toro will come from poisoned air
if we allow an airport. Airports sicken people who don't even use
them.</LD>
<TE>   Every day, planes will deposit tons of cancer-producing chemicals,
carbon monoxide and lung-damaging particles over Orange County. By
contrast, there is minimal risk from physical contact with chemicals
in the soil. Tens of thousands of Marines and their families lived,
worked, went to school and played at El Toro for years--with no
adverse health effects.</TE>
<TE>   Common sense in planning where facilities are built will avoid the
capped landfills. Eventually, the federal government will be required
to render them safe.</TE>
<TE>   County politicians are poised to build a huge airport at El Toro
unless voters stop the project March 5. The O.C. Central Park and
Nature Preserve Initiative was conceived to protect our quality of
life. "Yes" on W votes will commit El Toro to safe,
non-traffic-producing, nonpolluting, nonaviation uses--like parks,
schools, museums, research facilities, sports venues and health care
centers.</TE>

<TE>   Measure W makes no sense and is glaringly unfair. South County
already has 103,144 acres of parkland, which averages six people per
acre. Passage of Measure W would add another whopping 4,700 acres.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, North County has only 8,035 acres of parkland,
averaging 249 people per acre. Certainly, it is far wiser to build a
park there.</TE>

<TE>   Newport Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Greg Hurley, former environmental engineer and now shill for the
pro-airport forces, continues to whine about probable soil pollution
at the El Toro base.</TE>
<TE>   The county's plan will tear up all existing runways and excavate
to a depth of 50 feet, making the plan the largest earth-moving
project in county history. This enormous excavation will distribute
the contaminants to the lungs of Orange County residents.</TE>
<TE>   Adding insult to injury, the proposed 840 flights a day will
provide an additional 96,000 pounds of air pollutants for us to
absorb. Thanks for your concern, Greg, but solvents in the soil of
the Great Park are the least of our worries.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Quigley</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Niguel</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Yes, El Toro is polluted, and the Navy must be made to clean it
up. However, Times readers have been told that only a fraction of El
Toro is badly polluted--primarily the ground beneath the runways and
major hangars. The county airport plan calls for precisely these
polluted areas to be heavily regraded to level the runways to
commercial standards. The airport can't be built without disturbing
this ground and expelling carcinogens into the air.</TE>
<TE>   The park, on the other hand, can be developed piecemeal, using the
more than 4,000 acres of clean land at El Toro and completely
avoiding contaminated areas. The proposed park would be much less
dangerous to build at El Toro than the airport.</TE>

<TE>   South County growth is accelerating.</TE>
<TE>   Look at the number of single houses now being built and the
massive apartment structures appearing in Irvine, the 14,000 homes
planned for the O'Neill Ranch and the homes on either side of the San
Diego Freeway in the vicinity of Sand Canyon Road.</TE>
<TE>   Just imagine what the housing density will be like if there is no
El Toro airport and Irvine fills the 4,700 acres of El Toro's real
estate and the 14,000 acres of buffer zone with wall-to-wall housing.</TE>
<TE>   With at least two vehicles per residence, that adds up to a
tremendous increase for the existing roads to absorb.</TE>
<TE>   A recent program on KOCE's "Real Orange" discussed the rosy trade
picture for Orange County and attributes this to the productivity of
the county generally and to the people of South County particularly.</TE>
<TE>   The program stressed that tourism and trade with the Pacific Rim
countries will be the biggest factors.</TE>
<TE>   It's time for South County citizens to grow up and realize they
are living in a dynamic metropolitan region and their efforts are
part of the forces driving this economic engine.</TE>
<TE>   For that trade to become a reality, we cannot rely on LAX or tiny
John Wayne. El Toro should be opened as soon as possible.</TE>
<TE>   William Kearns</TE>
<TE>   Costa Mesa</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I'm confused. You reported that developing a park at El Toro may
be too risky because of soil contamination. As I understand it, the
county's airport plan includes a 2,700-acre park that doesn't seem to
be mentioned in the report.</TE>
<TE>   Was this an oversight? Has the park been taken out of the airport
plan? Are airport supporters conveniently not mentioning it because
it would defeat their purpose? Or does jet exhaust have some
cleansing effect that I don't know about?</TE>

represents the 73rd State Assembly District.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"As the lungs are to a human body, so is a park the breathing spot of
the people, and if these efforts are successful, they will prove a
lasting boon to the city." This statement may sound like a recent
quote in the ongoing debate between the park and airport plans for El
Toro. However, it was made more than 110 years ago by the Ladies
Annex of the San Diego Chamber of Commerce.</LD>
<LD>   It was made to urge the planting of trees at Balboa Park in
1889--despite opposition from land speculators who wanted the site
used for industrial development. You can read about this debate in
"San Diego's City Park, 1868-1902, an Early Debate on Environment and
Profit," by Gregory E. Montes.</LD>
<LD>   Will we do for our communities, what San Diego residents of a
hundred years ago did for theirs? Will we create our version of
Balboa Park, or New York's Central Park or Griffith Park--or will we
allow special interests to build a polluting annex to LAX in the
heart of Orange County?</LD>
<TE>   If we do not pass the Orange County Central Park and Nature
Preserve Initiative--Measure W--on March 5, then just three of the
five county supervisors are empowered to start building El Toro
airport.</TE>
<TE>   They will tear out the school buildings and playing fields that
Marine Corps families enjoyed. They will build pipelines, fuel
storage tanks, terminals, towers and lights--and fly planes around
the clock as quickly as they can.</TE>
<TE>   Measure W stops them. It protects this vital piece of land for our
future generations. The Measure W law limits development to park- and
education-compatible uses. The federal government, when it transfers
the land free of charge, will put these restrictions in the deed.</TE>
<TE>   Measure W specifies the maximum height and density of what can be
built at El Toro, and the noise and traffic. Anyone who says that
this carefully drafted measure does not safeguard the land does not
understand the initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Airport supporters have based their case on concocted threats of
tax increases. They continue to make false claims even though the
county's own analysis, by consultants under the supervision of the
county auditor-controller, concluded, "The initiative does not impose
a new tax or tax increase."</TE>
<TE>   The auditor-controller's analysis recognizes that California's
Propositions 13 and 218 require two-thirds voter approval before any
special tax can be levied. This initiative says, "No new taxes."
There is no need because our park can be financed and built over
time, by renting out assets that the Marines left behind--3 million
square feet of buildings, more than 1,100 housing units and more than
1,000 acres of scarce farmland.</TE>
<TE>   The auditor's study concluded that a good start on the park could
be made from this rental income. It estimates the additional cost to
the general fund at less than 65 cents per resident per year.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, we know that most museums and cultural centers, and
many colleges are financed not by taxpayer money but by
philanthropists. Local examples are our own Orange County Performing
Arts Center, the Bowers and Discovery museums and Chapman
University--all built with private contributions.</TE>
<TE>   For good reason, some of our most fiscally conservative elected
officials have joined me in supporting Measure W. We have a chance on
March 5 to stop the wasteful airport project and to preserve this
land for the future enjoyment of Orange County residents.</TE>
<TE>   Join us in voting "yes" on W for our future and our families.</TE>

<AU>SHIRLEY A. CONGER</AU>

Working Group and writes from Corona del Mar.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Irvine's Great Park Initiative sounds like a dream come true. Crafted
by the best advertising minds, it has popular appeal but is actually
a fraud and deceit on Orange County voters.</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County Central Park and Nature Preserve Initiative,
Measure W, on the ballot March 5, lauds the benefits of a
7-square-mile park (the former El Toro Marine Corps Air Station) that
includes a "multipurpose park, open space, nature preserve,
universities and schools, cultural facilities, and other interim uses
... one of 'America's greatest parks,' no new taxes, quality of life"
(Section Two).</LD>
<LD>   This is a false promise. What Measure W does is change the zoning
of the base from that of an airport to that of a park. But it does
that and much more.</LD>
<TE>   Contrary to any accepted meaning of the words, "open space" as
defined in this initiative in Section Four, 3.e., includes landfills,
extensive industrial development and office buildings. Also, "Certain
property ... is committed ... to remain as open space ... but other
property, due to market pressures to serve a growing county
population, may ultimately be developed in other ways."</TE>
<TE>   The same section of Measure W actually allows development on up to
half of the base, with building heights up to 100 feet and 130
employees per acre.</TE>
<TE>   Measure W is appealing when it promises no new taxes. According to
the initiative's summary, the buildings on the base will provide
sufficient revenue to pay for the park. In fact, these buildings are
old, up to 50 years, and need upgrading.</TE>
<TE>   Today, with Orange County leasing the base from the Navy and
renting out some facilities, it is costing taxpayers $5 million a
year just to maintain the grounds. One study of the costs of the
park, commissioned by the Airport Working Group and Citizens for Jobs
and Economy, estimated the average tax increase per household to be
$300 per year.</TE>
<TE>   Even more suspect is a sentence in the initiative that supports
seeking tax revenue to build the park. In Section Four, 5.c.2., it
says that the county should maximize "use of available funding
sources, including federal, state, and local, as well as support
necessary increases in such sources."</TE>
<TE>   Are these funds not from taxes?</TE>
<TE>   The most damning section of the initiative has received scant
attention. Its scope is not limited to the El Toro property. Section
Four, 3.h., reads, "The twelve major land use policies apply to ...
'all geographic areas of unincorporated portion of the County.'"</TE>
<TE>   What does this mean? It means that all unincorporated land in the
county is subject to the provisions of this initiative. This includes
Bolsa Chica and other areas, allowing the weak standards defined in
Measure W to apply to all unincorporated land in the county. It
doesn't rezone these properties, but it means that all provisions of
the initiative will apply to them.</TE>
<TE>   While purporting to offer the citizens of Orange County a
pristine, open-space park, in reality, this deceptive initiative
undermines the protections we already have.</TE>
<TE>   It is a developer's dream come true. Eliminating the El Toro
airport zoning allows all 14,400 acres of buffer zone to be developed
in addition to the 4,700 acres of the base itself.</TE>
<TE>   While there is no guarantee of a park, Measure W changes the
ground rules for the county's undeveloped unincorporated areas. It is
an environmentalist's and a taxpayer's nightmare.</TE>

<LD>At 8 in the morning, the dirt lot was barren, with no hint of what
was to come.</LD>
<LD>   In the adjacent parking lot sat a Roadway truck loaded with red,
yellow and blue playground equipment and lots of tools--from ratchets
to hammers, screwdrivers to wheelbarrows. A cadre of volunteers
waited for their instructions.</LD>
<LD>   "The idea is really modeled on an Amish barn-raising," said Darell
Hammond, chief executive of KaBOOM, a Chicago-based nonprofit
organization. The group links communities in need with corporate
sponsors to fund and build safe playgrounds all over the country.
"Usually at the beginning, [volunteers] see the truck full of
equipment and say, 'We're going to build all this today?'"</LD>
<TE>   Despite their doubts, they do. This day they would build a
playground for Phillips Preschool, based at Phillips Temple Christian
Methodist Episcopal Church in South-Central Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The morning of the "build," as KaBOOM members call the
construction blitz, began with volunteers divided up into teams named
after flavors of Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream.</TE>
<TE>   The Nutty Waffle Cones would grab paintbrushes. Cherry Garcia and
KaBerry KaBOOM would need screwdrivers and levels. Members of the New
York Super Fudge Chunk team would need wheelbarrows and shovels to
start moving and shoveling 125 cubic yards of mulch that would cover
the bottom of the playground. A representative from Playworld
Systems, the manufacturer of the playground equipment, was there to
oversee the work.</TE>
<TE>   After a pep talk and safety instructions, volunteers were sent to
work. And by 11:40, a bright yellow slide--the first obvious sign of
a playground--had been erected to the cheers of all present.</TE>
<TE>   The project, held in December, brought together about 150
volunteers and church and community members of all ages and races.</TE>
<TE>   Girl Scouts Help</TE>
<TE>   With the Project</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just really overwhelmed," said the church's co-pastor,
Thembekila Coleman-Smart, of the number of volunteers. Three members
of Girl Scout Troop 532 from La Mirada helped paint a storage shed
and a shelter over a sandbox.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of cool building a playground," said 12-year-old Katlin
Noble, who, with the other girls, sported head-to-toe paint
splotches. "It's nice to be able to give something to the
preschoolers who will play here."</TE>
<TE>   The playground for the church school, which is tuition-free for
low-income families, was number 332 for KaBOOM. The organization has
helped build a half-dozen other playgrounds in the Los Angeles area
during its six-year existence.</TE>
<TE>   KaBOOM was founded by Hammond, who grew up in an orphanage.</TE>
<TE>   "I have been the beneficiary of goodwill and good deeds," he said.
"I decided that I would do the same for other children."</TE>
<TE>   According to the organization, safe and accessible playgrounds are
critical to the development of the nation's children and can help
build social networks within a community. KaBOOM representatives, who
are certified playground inspectors, go out to each site. They serve
as the project managers and inspect all the work to ensure that every
nut and bolt is properly placed.</TE>
<TE>   "We do for playgrounds what Habitat for Humanity does for houses,"
Hammond said, adding that bringing a playground to fruition takes
more than just one day. Phillips Temple Church was asked to raise
$5,000 to contribute to the cost of the equipment, and had to meet
with representatives from 7-Eleven and Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade, the
playground's corporate sponsors, to help plan the site.</TE>
<TE>   Ben &amp; Jerry's has been involved with KaBOOM for four years,
sponsoring playgrounds and even naming one of its ice cream flavors,
KaBerry KaBOOM, after the organization.</TE>
<TE>   About 70 volunteers at the installation of the playground were
7-Eleven employees or franchisees and their families, said Cynthia
Davis, vice president of one of the company's divisions.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Reeves, a facility manager for 7-Eleven, had six other members
of his family helping with the project.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a good experience to bring out the youngsters in the
family to teach them about community service," said Norma Meisner,
Reeves' mother-in-law. Altogether, the family helped paint, shovel
mulch and assemble the teeter-totter.</TE>
<TE>   Job Is Finished</TE>
<TE>   Within 6 Hours</TE>
<TE>   By 2 p.m., just six hours after the job began, the work was
finished. A brightly colored playground with slide, swings and
teeter-totter replaced the dilapidated equipment that stood there
just days before.</TE>
<TE>   A ribbon-cutting ceremony closed out the day, and proud but weary
workers returned to their homes. But for the community, it was just
the start.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of just being reserved for the preschool, this will
benefit the whole community," Coleman-Smart said.</TE>
<TE>   The church plans to open the now-gated playground to the
neighborhood several days a week and hold cultural celebrations in
the picnic area there.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman-Smart said that since the playground was built, she has
sensed a change of attitudes among church members, as well as a
renewed sense of hope.</TE>
<TE>   "People are so excited and energized, they already want to do
another project," she said. "Some people here were believing the hype
that everything was going wrong and that nothing could be done. But
this has been a dream come true for everybody."</TE>
<TE>   KaBOOM will be facilitating the construction of two more
playgrounds in the Los Angeles area in 2002, and is seeking
recommendations for sites where new playgrounds are needed.</TE>

recommendation, check KaBOOM's Web site at www .Kaboom.org. or call

<DL></DL>
<LD>Nigel Thompson, 44, a British Gulf War veteran who believed he
contracted a debilitating motor neuron disease from medicine he
received during the conflict, died Wednesday at a nursing home in
Yeovil, in southern England.</LD>
<LD>   Thompson was one of three British veterans of the U.S.-led 1990-91
war against Iraq who made an appeal to Prime Minister Tony Blair in
January 2000 to conduct a public inquiry into the cause of ailments
afflicting Gulf War veterans.</LD>
<LD>   Thompson believed his illness was caused by drugs he received in
the Persian Gulf as a mechanic with the 848th Naval Air Squadron.</LD>
<TE>   He was discharged because of his illness in 1994 after 21 years of
service and ultimately required 24-hour care.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, he was honored by the Royal British Legion for his work
on behalf of veterans and their families.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 40,000 British troops who served during the six-week war,
according to the National Gulf War Veterans and Families Assn., about
450 have since died as the result of either suicide or Gulf War
Syndrome.</TE>

<HD>Leaky Windows Leave Drops of Discontent in Simi Valley</HD>
<DH>Housing: Developer is spending millions to fix problems in
its pricey homes. Displaced owners have so far refrained from suing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From a tract house on the flatlands below, Afzal Khan watched and
waited as Centex Homes built a fashionable new neighborhood on the
wind-swept hills overlooking Simi Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Finally, he bought a Mediterranean-style, two-story house for
about $500,000--neither the smallest nor the largest in the 180-house
Silverthorne subdivision.</LD>
<LD>   That was in 1999.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a beautiful home," said Kahn, an electronics engineer for
TRW. "Just what I wanted, a bigger house on the hill."</TE>
<TE>   Then the first big storm of the season blew through in early 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The rains seeped under a French door on a second-floor deck. Kahn
first noticed the puddles in his downstairs breakfast nook. Then he
saw moisture on the ceiling. And a carpet was soaked.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a new house," Kahn said. "But the windows were leaking."</TE>
<TE>   The same thing happened at several other Silverthorne homes. Then
last winter, as the subdivision neared completion, another blustery
storm began to reveal the true scope of the problem.</TE>
<TE>   So far, tests of about 100 houses--now valued at $600,000 to $1
million--have found that faulty window welds fail to hold out the
water to varying degrees, from pinhole-sized leaks to severe ones.</TE>
<TE>   Centex, one of the nation's largest home builders, is buying back
three houses for a total of more than $2 million after water leaks,
plumbing defects and other problems prompted homeowners to ask for
full financial relief, company officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Centex has stripped the exterior of eight other homes to the
wooden support studs, relocating families for three to four months
while replacing wall lathing, insulation, stucco and about 35 windows
per house. The cost has been hundreds of thousands per house
including relocation expenses, according to Centex. Extensive repairs
to a few more homes probably will be needed, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of other houses have also undergone minor repairs.</TE>
<TE>   "The stars really lined up on this one," said John Ochsner,
Ventura-Los Angeles region president for Centex. "Just a number of
things came together, but the real crux that caused us the most
problems are these window failures. We do not have problems like this
in any other subdivision in our region."</TE>
<TE>   After the extent of the problems became evident last year,
Dallas-based Centex notified all 180 homeowners that it would test
for leaks in every Silverthorne house if requested. The tests are
expected to continue through this summer.</TE>
<TE>   "As many as 100 homes were leaking, and we've had a few homes with
significant problems," Ochsner said. "But we've made the repairs, and
we've put [owners] back in their homes. I think they'll tell you
they're very happy they bought a home from Centex because we stand
behind our work."</TE>
<TE>   What is unusual about the Silverthorne situation, in fact, is not
only the number of problems but that complaints apparently have been
resolved so far without the filing of any lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of homeowners have hired attorneys but have not sued,
Ochsner said. Nor has Centex sued a subcontractor that provided what
the builder considers faulty windows.</TE>
<TE>   "If a neighborhood becomes stigmatized, that's not the best
solution for our homeowners," Ochsner said. "Centex is taking the
lead, because it's not right to ask our homeowners to wait [for
repairs]."</TE>
<TE>   Kathryn Calafato, a member of the Silverthorne Homeowners Assn.
governing board, gives Centex credit for responding to complaints,
but says she's surprised a class-action suit has not been filed.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a nightmare," Calafato said. "The poor guys have to move
out for three or four months. The question is, did Centex have good
quality control in place or not?"</TE>
<TE>   Calafato's home was tested for leaks last week, and workmen told
her the windows are watertight. But she still wonders if the
debilitating headaches and sinus problems she has suffered this
winter are the result of leaks that spread mold in her walls.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's mold, I have some serious questions," she said. "I've
been very sick this winter. And they bought out one of the houses
because two children got sick because of mold."</TE>
<TE>   Ochsner said that while two homeowners with sick children have
complained of mold-related problems, an expert hired by Centex found
mold levels inside their houses no higher than outside.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Centex is buying back a Silverthorne home that sold for
about $685,000. The owner hung a banner from the house last October,
declaring it a "4,000 sq. ft. Centex home we can't live in for health
reasons!" He offered to sell the home for $975,000; the agreed sale
price has not been disclosed. The banner has been removed.</TE>
<TE>   The owner moved from the house last week. But Ochsner said tests
found no evidence that the residence was a "sick house."</TE>
<TE>   "When somebody puts up a banner like that in the neighborhood, not
only are the neighbors concerned, Centex is concerned," Ochsner said.
"And they may hold a lot of leverage over us even if we do not agree
there is an underlying problem."</TE>
<TE>   Another former Silverthorne homeowner, Van Nuys architect Neil
Ponsky, sold back his home to Centex last summer for $670,000, two
years after buying it for about $200,000 less, according to property
records.</TE>
<TE>   Ponsky said he could not discuss the sale or problems he had with
his house because of a confidentiality agreement with Centex.</TE>
<TE>   "But they were more than cooperative; they were more than fair
with me," said Ponsky, who now lives in a new home in Northridge.
"They were willing to do anything to fix the house, but we just
decided to sell it back to them. It got to the point where it was
just time that we moved on."</TE>
<TE>   Ochsner said Centex bought the homes for market value, the
increased prices reflecting a rapid appreciation from a hot housing
market and improvements the former owners made to their properties.</TE>
<TE>   Centex is using the Ponsky house, now blocked from view by a
green-tarped fence, to test methods to fix problems in other
Silverthorne homes, said Gary Herschel, construction manager for the
subdivision.</TE>
<TE>   Standing next to a stack of new windows and a stripped stucco
wall, Herschel said, "We're coming up with procedures to rectify any
future problems."</TE>
<TE>   Silverthorne's windy ridgeline location has contributed to its
problems, Ochsner said. That may be why Centex, which used the same
window contractor on other projects, has experienced no significant
leaking elsewhere, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Centex still buys windows from the same manufacturer
because the quality is high and the machine calibration that caused
the bad window welds at Silverthorne has been fixed, Ochsner said.</TE>
<TE>   He also disputes claims that Centex failed to check the quality of
construction at Silverthorne.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time you have an event like this, you certainly look back
to see where your quality control could have been better," he said.
"But historically, windows with faulty welds in the corners have not
been a problem. We treat this as a learning experience."</TE>
<TE>   The problems have unsettled homeowners, who wonder what will come
next.</TE>
<TE>   Two-year resident Candy Laufer said she heard about the problems
in December and called Centex for a window inspection. Tests found 12
leaky windows. Centex is proposing simple replacement, not extreme
measures requiring relocation.</TE>
<TE>   "We're definitely not going to take this lightly," Laufer said.
"We're going to talk to the people we need to and find out what our
rights are. Especially since our home is so new."</TE>
<TE>   While Laufer is at the beginning of her repairs, Kahn is at the
end. The engineer and his wife moved back into their five-bedroom,
3,700-square-foot home in November after living for three months in a
new Centex house in Moorpark.</TE>
<TE>   "Believe me, my house is a much better house today," Kahn said.
"John Ochsner came in to my living room and he promised to do
everything to make it right, and he did everything he promised.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot predict any problem tomorrow," Kahn added. "But today,
everything is OK."</TE>

<HD>Gadget Makers Aren't Kidding</HD>
<DH>Education: As Irvine science fair proves, students take
their inventions seriously. A 12-year-old girl topped the field of
more than 400 with her 'painless window blind' creation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you've ever wanted to peek out a window without having to open the
entire blind, Amy Kasahara has a solution for you. She calls it the
"painless window blind"--a window covering that can be opened one
small section at a time.</LD>
<LD>   "You can use it for a doggy door or just to have more privacy,"
says 12-year-old Amy, a seventh-grader at Lakeside Middle School in
Irvine. "I was eating lunch at a restaurant when I thought of it--for
no particular reason."</LD>
<LD>   Amy's invention won the grand prize Saturday at the 15th annual
Astounding Inventions of the Future, a celebration of children's
innovation and creativity at Irvine Valley College.</LD>
<TE>   In competition were the inventions of more than 400 first- through
eighth-graders representing 40 schools in Irvine, Tustin and Laguna
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to encourage as many kids as we can to be interested in
science," said Mark Sontag, curriculum coordinator for math and
science at the Irvine Unified School District and an organizer of the
event. "This is an opportunity for them to be creative by coming up
with something useful on their own."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, there seemed to be no shortage of creativity as the
children took turns demonstrating their inventions to the panel of
judges in the college gymnasium.</TE>
<TE>   Courtney Boutwell, 8, said she came up with her idea for a
wireless remote-controlled coffeemaker after watching her parents
struggling to get out of bed in the morning.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes it takes them a pretty long time," said Courtney, a
student at Tustin's Nelson Elementary School.</TE>
<TE>   Janelle Jarvis, a third-grader at Loma Vista Elementary School in
Santa Ana, said she invented her Sun Sensor motorized umbrella to
protect herself from the sun regardless of its position in the sky.
Plug in the motor, she said, and the umbrella will automatically
rotate with the sun to keep you in perpetual shade.</TE>
<TE>   And Johnathan Babbs, 8, said he built his radio-controlled
backpack on wheels--called a Zoompack--to avoid the strain of having
to carry it to school.</TE>
<TE>   Just lay it on the ground, he said, turn on the remote control
and--zoom!--it will follow you anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   "My cousins have really heavy backpacks," said Johnathan, a
third-grader at Red Hill Elementary School in Tustin. "I thought
there should be a better pack that doesn't hurt your back."</TE>
<TE>   Other inventions unveiled at the contest included the
Ele-Fountain, an adjustable water fountain that can be electronically
lowered to mouth height for children; pudding tubes for easy access
to dessert; a cane equipped with a radio and cell phone to make it
"easy to walk and listen to music and talk on the phone at the same
time"; clips and magnets to help keep one's shoes tied; a "dripless"
ice-cream cone stuck through a tray; socks sewn with Velcro to keep
them paired in the wash; a water sprayer attached to an alarm clock
for difficult-to-wake children; a "hammer helper" holding a nail on
the end of the hammer to eliminate banged thumbs; and eyeglass wipers
to clear lenses in the rain.</TE>
<TE>   "This builds self-esteem," said Eileen Lenson, whose 10-year-old,
Rachel, invented the wipers. "Life is very challenging--they see all
the things they can't do, so this focuses them on something they can.
Self-esteem is the foundation of everything--if you have self-esteem,
you're willing to take risks."</TE>
<TE>   Winning entries--some of which, in the past, have ended up on
national television with Jay Leno or David Letterman--were given
prizes ranging from white ribbons to a $200 savings bond awarded to
Amy for her painless blinds.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm overjoyed," said the youngster, who plans to attend UC
Berkeley, Stanford or Harvard for studies leading to a career as a
veterinarian. "I didn't think I'd win."</TE>
<TE>   Any other inventions in her noggin? "Not at the moment," she said.
"Right now I'm focusing on this one."</TE>

<DH>Ventura County: Metrolink commuter line to be expanded
despite a drop in ridership last year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARRI KARUHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Transportation officials are moving forward with plans to expand
commuter rail service along the Ventura County line despite a
one-year dip in ridership.</LD>
<LD>   Construction is expected to begin next month on a $5.7-million
station in the Montalvo area of Ventura, where empty trains are
stored overnight but no passenger service exists. In June, work is
scheduled to start on an $8-million expansion of the existing
Camarillo station, which officials hope will evolve into a
transportation hub for commuters and students attending Cal State
Channel Islands when it opens this fall.</LD>
<LD>   The projects, financed with state and federal dollars allocated to
the Ventura County Transportation Commission, come as Metrolink
prepares to spend $200,000 on a survey to determine why ridership has
not increased as hoped on its rail lines throughout the six-county
Southern California area.</LD>
<TE>   Metrolink and the Southern California Assn. of Governments will
hire private firms to conduct the one-year study, which will involve
a random poll--by phone and mail--of about 26,800 households
throughout the region.</TE>
<TE>   Residents will be asked about their travel habits, including their
choice of transportation, whether they ride or have ever ridden
Metrolink, and why former riders stopped using the commuter trains.</TE>
<TE>   "This information will help us be able to hopefully target our
services better," Metrolink spokeswoman Sharon Gavin said.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to conduct the study, expected to be finished by
spring 2003, was made last year after Metrolink learned that
ridership was decreasing.</TE>
<TE>   Since Metrolink service began, ridership along the Ventura County
line steadily increased from 22,781 passengers in 1993 to a peak of
45,202 in 2000. But in 2001, the number of commuters dipped to
41,329. And last month, 221 fewer passengers rode weekday trains
along the line--which stretches from Oxnard to Union Station in
downtown Los Angeles--than did during December 2000, Gavin said.</TE>
<TE>   Metrolink hopes to attract riders by making more trains available.
Earlier this month, the rail service added a northbound stop (about
10 a.m.) in Simi Valley and Moorpark and a 10th southbound train that
stops in those cities after 11 a.m., before continuing to Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, commuters in Moorpark and Simi Valley had to wait more
than six hours between the last morning southbound train (about 8:30
a.m.) and the first southbound train in the afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "The more trains we have out there, the more people we can attract
to use the service beyond the regular commuters that you would
expect," said Mary Travis, manager of rail programs for the Ventura
County Transportation Commission.</TE>
<TE>   "People just doing day trips--or half-day trips to Glendale, the
Burbank area or as far as Los Angeles--we want to encourage them to
use the trains too."</TE>
<TE>   John Brand, senior management analyst for Moorpark, agrees. Before
the schedule was expanded, Brand said he received many calls from
commuters requesting a midday train to Los Angeles to get to doctor
appointments, as well as to Burbank Airport.</TE>
<TE>   "People lead really busy lives with work and families, businesses
and appointments," Brand said. "On the days when there isn't an
alternative train to take, people shift their mode of transportation
from the train to the car, or carpool."</TE>
<TE>   Transportation advocates say more service is needed to coax people
out of their cars.</TE>
<TE>   "Extra capacity, even if it's not needed today, will definitely be
needed in the not-so-distant future, given the population growth that
our region is going to continue to experience over the next 10 to 20
years," Southern California Assn. of Governments spokesman Jeff
Lustgarten said. The station in Montalvo is expected to open by fall.
It will be Metrolink's northernmost stop along the Ventura County
line. It will include a platform, ticket machines and 60 parking
spaces. The Camarillo station expansion, scheduled to be finished by
fall 2004, will double to 600 the number of parking spaces for
commuters and students at nearby Cal State Channel Islands.</TE>

<HD>She Makes Union Activism an Art</HD>
<DH>Labor: A Fullerton College instructor persuaded colleagues
to organize and found a new calling.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>College art instructor Linda Cushing was just another weary
part-timer cobbling together a class on this campus and that.</LD>
<LD>   Then she spotted another teacher grading papers in Fullerton
College's faculty lounge, a veteran part-timer who, like herself, was
juggling a student load for little pay and no guarantee of a job next
semester.</LD>
<LD>   "When he looked up at me, the mask came off," Cushing said of that
fall day in 1998. "There was such despair and isolation and anger in
his face. I thought, if I'm going to become this, I can't continue
teaching."</LD>
<TE>   Instead, Cushing pushed and prodded part-time teachers at the
North Orange County Community College District to unionize. Then as
president of the new union, she won them a three-year contract last
September that guaranteed a 13.5% raise.</TE>
<TE>   "If she hadn't been there, I don't think the union would have
gotten started here," said philosophy instructor Sam Russo,
co-president of Adjunct Faculty United at Fullerton College. "She
just refused to give up."</TE>
<TE>   Cushing's success at Fullerton and its sister campuses so
impressed the American Federation of Teachers that it hired her as
one of 39 national organizers. Her job is to concentrate on community
college instructors--full and part time. So far, she has helped
organize unions at Citrus College in Glendora and Palomar College in
San Diego County, and is campaigning to organize the faculty at
Cerritos College in Norwalk, the Kern College District, Victor Valley
Community College and the College of the Canyons.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not often an ordinary person can do things that affect
people's lives," Cushing said.</TE>
<TE>   About 17,000 full-time instructors teach at California's 108
community colleges. Another 37,000 part-timers help carry the course
load. Some teach only an occasional class; others try to make a
living at it while searching for a permanent faculty position.</TE>
<TE>   Part-timers are paid 40% to 50% less than full-time instructors
with comparable experience and education, the California
Postsecondary Education Commission said in a report last April.</TE>
<TE>   Full-time faculty teach 63% of classes, well below the state's
goal of 75%, said Chancellor Tom Nussbaum, who heads the California
community college system. The problem, Nussbaum said, is that
California community colleges receive $2,300 per student less than
the national average.</TE>
<TE>   "To keep our doors open with low funding levels, one strategy has
been to use part-time instructors," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the state set aside $57 million to increase
part-timers' pay. But the chancellor said $175 million to $200
million is needed.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a long-simmering problem that had not been dealt
with, and it reached a boiling point," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Lightman, who heads the Faculty Assn. of the California
Community Colleges in Sacramento, said: "I can't emphasize enough how
exploited and displaced part-time faculty feel."</TE>
<TE>   Into that atmosphere stepped Cushing. She earned a bachelor's
degree in communications from Pepperdine, where she headed the campus
Young Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   After graduation, she worked as a probation officer, managed a
posh athletic club, then launched a graphic design studio in
Fullerton. When the early '90s recession hit, she declared
bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Cushing used the extra time to take a drawing class at Fullerton
and fell in love with art.</TE>
<TE>   She continued her studies until she had received two master's
degrees in drawing and painting from Cal State Fullerton. She also
decided she wanted to be a college professor. She searched for a
full-time job and taught wherever she could, mainly at Fullerton,
Cypress and Santa Ana colleges.</TE>
<TE>   Cushing loved the work, and thought the $35 an hour she was making
was pretty good. But when she added up time spent preparing lessons
and grading papers, she realized she was making little more than
minimum wage.</TE>
<TE>   Seeing her colleague so despairing was her call to action. Someone
told her about an Internet discussion group for part-time instructors
around the state. Via e-mail, she found people in the same situation.</TE>
<TE>   Also trolling the Internet was John Berg, a national organizer for
the American Federation of Teachers. The two met in October 1998.
With the help of Berg and a core group of other instructors, they
launched a campaign for union representation of North Orange County
part-time faculty.</TE>
<TE>   "The key to organizing any group of employees is solid leadership
at the top end of the local group," Berg said. "Linda was a very
solid leader."</TE>
<TE>   Organizing is a difficult business at best. It's even harder if
you're trying to reach adjunct instructors who don't have offices or
much interaction. Cushing and her group of activists waited outside
classrooms at Fullerton and Cypress colleges and the School of
Continuing Education, which make up the district, persuading
part-time instructors to sign up.</TE>
<TE>   Cushing encountered other obstacles. She said a department head
and a dean warned her to back off, intimating she might not be
retained if she continued organizing. For close to a week, Cushing
pulled back. "I don't have a death wish," she said. But phone calls
from fellow organizers persuaded her to return.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the rival California Teachers Assn., which
represents North Orange County's full-time faculty, began its own
campaign to organize the part-timers. At Fullerton, Cushing's efforts
paid off when part-time faculty voted to have her union represent
them. Next came talks with district administrators in June 2000. A
contract was signed in September 2001, giving part-timers an
immediate 13.5% raise, $100 a month toward medical benefits, a
promise to renegotiate salary in two years and seniority rights when
it came to class assignments.</TE>
<TE>   "She has taken a vision for part-time faculty and translated it
into action," Lightman said. "I think she has set a standard for
organizing."</TE>

<HD>Sewage Issue Murky With Gauge Gone</HD>
<DH>Environment: Accuracy of monitor that showed acceptable
outflow from Huntington Beach treatment plant was questioned. New
device may be required.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY and SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orange County Sanitation District removed a pollution monitoring
device after a state inspector said it was generating questionable
readings, making him suspect that sewage flowing into the ocean
exceeded legal limits for water clarity, documents and interviews
show.</LD>
<LD>   The device, installed voluntarily in 1996, was pulled out of a
Huntington Beach treatment plant in October, shortly after a meeting
with the water-quality inspector, who raised questions about
miscalibrations and apparent false readings, his reports show.</LD>
<LD>   The device, a turbidity analyzer, is not required. But it has
become a popular round-the-clock monitoring tool at public and
private sewer plants across the nation because it can signal trouble
in the treatment process.</LD>
<TE>   The Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board, the area's
primary enforcer of federal and state discharge permits, is exploring
whether to require the Orange County agency to reinstall such a
monitor.</TE>
<TE>   Sanitation officials oppose this, arguing that the daily
laboratory samples they take under current regulations are enough to
ensure that the partially treated sewage meets clean-water standards.
Because those samples show no violations, they said, another level of
monitoring is unnecessary. In any case, they said the system never
worked properly and was never relied upon for official readings.</TE>
<TE>   "It was something that was in place, like a clock on the wall. You
look at it when you want to know the time, and when you don't, you
don't look at it," said Lisa Murphy, spokeswoman for the agency,
which serves more than 2 million households and businesses in north
and central Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something we put in place originally thinking we could use
it.... And it was not being used," Murphy said. "So there's really no
magical explanation as to why it stayed there unused."</TE>
<TE>   Questions about the monitor emerge as the sanitation district
seeks to extend a federal permit allowing it to discharge 243 million
gallons a day of partially treated waste water 4 1/2 miles off
Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The district is the largest of 36 public agencies in the
country--and one of four remaining in California--with a waiver to
the 1972 Clean Water Act, which mandates that sewage released into
waterways receive rigorous treatment to kill most bacteria, viruses
and other disease-causing organisms.</TE>
<TE>   The monitor was intended to measure turbidity--cloudiness in the
water--which is one of more than 120 variables the sanitation
district must track under restrictions established by California's
Ocean Plan and federal law.</TE>
<TE>   Turbidity violations could cost up to $11,000 a day, depending on
the severity and duration. They also could jeopardize renewal of the
waiver. To date, the district has not been cited.</TE>
<TE>   Turbid water blocks out light, decreasing vegetation, which
provides food and shelter to marine life.</TE>
<TE>   "As it reduces light, it decreases photosynthesis," said Clint
Winant, a professor of oceanography at the Scripps Institute of
Oceanography. "Generally, you would decrease the productivity of
waters."</TE>
<TE>   While turbidity itself doesn't affect human health, experts said
its presence can indicate more significant problems elsewhere in the
treatment flow, including concentrations of bacteria-laden solid
waste.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of turbidity analyzers say they provide quicker
feedback than lab samples. In California, they have been approved for
use at some public and private treatment plants that discharge into
streams and rivers that are more sensitive to, and less able to
dilute, highly turbid waste water.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, sanitation district officials told the inspector the
$5,400 monitor was used for a short-term research project after the
agency recorded an over-the-limit turbidity reading in 1994. When
asked for findings of the research project, officials told The Times
the system actually was installed in 1996 as part of an upgrade to
the Huntington Beach sampling station. They said it was never used
for research and was abandoned after tests showed turbidity readings
that did not correspond with lab samples.</TE>
<TE>   A series of water board inspection reports reviewed by The Times
shows that water regulators got involved in January 2001, when
inspector Julio Lara noticed a pinkish tint to the waste water at the
sampling station, along with high turbidity readings. After visiting
the plant several times over the next 10 months, he discovered the
system's calibration scales were set at levels lower than the legal
limits. Sometimes, he noted, the meter would flat-line at the top of
that preset limit for hours.</TE>
<TE>   "The turbidity trend resembled a horizontal line with occasional
downward peaks," Lara wrote in one of his reports. "These findings
may indicate that [the sanitation district] may be exceeding effluent
turbidity limitations."</TE>
<TE>   However, the agency's own reports, based on daily laboratory
samples, showed no violations during the same period, Lara noted.</TE>
<TE>   During the course of his inquiry, Lara said he was assured that
technicians were trying to correct the problem. He also reported that
a work order was issued to repair, clean and recalibrate the system
in February 2001, and that the technician assigned the task told him
in September 2001 that the equipment "normally worked without problem
and that the instrument's output turbidity signal was accurate to the
best of his knowledge."</TE>
<TE>   The system was removed shortly after sanitation officials met
privately with Lara on Oct. 16 to discuss his findings and his
recommendation that the monitor be fixed and incorporated by the
agency as a permanent, mandatory measurement tool.</TE>
<TE>   During that meeting, sanitation officials argued strongly against
Lara's proposed new requirements. They characterized the use of the
analyzer as "merely an unsuccessful experiment," saying that it was
"abandoned and inexplicably ... left operating and generating and
storing data. "</TE>
<TE>   Lara, who apparently was dissatisfied with that answer, wrote a
report after the meeting in which he said he was studying the issue
and may urge the water board to require the sanitation district to
install a permanent turbidity analyzer.</TE>
<TE>   The inquiry might seem a relatively minor matter, but for the
waiver issue. Environmentalists want the district to treat the waste
water it pipes offshore to the same standard required of the vast
majority of the nation's 16,000 sanitation agencies.</TE>
<TE>   But district officials estimate it would cost an additional $400
million or more annually if they lose the waiver, which expires next
year. They maintain that the discharged sewage, known as a plume,
does not harm the environment or public health.</TE>
<TE>   However, environmentalists and other critics have long derided the
agency's monitoring practices as self-serving. They note that
sanitation officials, after saying consistently that the plume never
comes closer than a mile off the coast, revealed last year that their
own data show it regularly coming within a half mile of Newport Beach
since 1987. Some scientists have theorized the plume may have
contributed to the closure of large stretches of the Huntington Beach
shoreline in the summer of 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the waiver hope they can persuade a majority of the
25-member sanitation district board to abandon any pursuit of a new
five-year waiver.</TE>

<HD>Man Backs D.A. Who Wrongly Convicted Him</HD>
<DH>Politics: The Orange County prosecutor had sought the death
penalty, then ended DeWayne McKinney's long prison term based on new
evidence. So he has a new campaign volunteer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas has received an unexpected
endorsement in his reelection campaign--from a man he wrongly
convicted of murder 20 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   In 1982, while a young prosecutor, Rackauckas persuaded a jury to
convict DeWayne McKinney in the slaying of a fast-food restaurant
manager. He argued for the death penalty, but McKinney was sentenced
to life in prison.</LD>
<LD>   When McKinney's conviction was drawn into question 18 years later,
it was Rackauckas, as the county's newly elected district attorney,
who agreed to set him free.</LD>
<TE>   And now, as Rackauckas faces a heated reelection challenge,
McKinney has offered to help any way he can.</TE>
<TE>   The two men met outside Rackauckas' Santa Ana office on Saturday,
the first time they'd seen each other since the day McKinney was
sentenced. They shook hands, exchanged warm words, and the onetime
prison inmate agreed to walk precincts soliciting support for
Rackauckas.</TE>
<TE>   While it may seem strange for McKinney to go to all this trouble
for a man who once asked a jury to kill him, McKinney said he holds
no grudge. He said Rackauckas could easily have ignored evidence that
someone else committed the crime, but instead the prosecutor stepped
forward in 2000 to set him free.</TE>
<TE>   McKinney's case was the first of five Orange County convictions
that Rackauckas helped overturn during his three years in office.
McKinney said it's a sign that Rackauckas is willing to own up to the
justice system's mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   "People have been getting falsely accused and going to prison for
years," McKinney said. "But no one has stepped forward and admitted
those things occurred. There's a lot of people incarcerated and
nobody is giving them a chance to present their cases. When you see
someone that rectifies situations over and over again, all you can do
is commend that."</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas says he was surprised by McKinney's unsolicited
gesture. After all, it was Rackauckas who told a jury to discount
McKinney's alibi evidence and to convict him even though he was
several inches shorter than the gunman described by eyewitnesses to
the 1980 killing at a Burger King in Orange.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a pleasant surprise," Rackauckas said. "I would expect
most people to be bitter and resentful, but he's not."</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas has thus far rejected recommendations from his
opponent, Deputy Dist. Atty. Wally Wade, that the office study the
five wrongful convictions to see if there were any lessons for county
prosecutors to learn from them.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas said he believes the system is working and he has taken
steps to encourage his prosecutors to be open to evidence of wrongful
convictions, even joining with the county public defender to form an
innocence project.</TE>
<TE>   "Our job is to do justice, and justice means convicting the guilty
and making sure the innocent are not convicted," Rackauckas said.</TE>
<TE>   McKinney, 41, who works as a lecture hall aide at UC Irvine, said
he followed news reports of Rackauckas' involvement in overturning
other wrongful convictions. And while Rackauckas acted in his case
only after the public defender filed a new appeal, McKinney said he
feels indebted to the district attorney.</TE>
<TE>   "He could have fought me for the next 10 years, but he didn't,"
McKinney said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the evidence, it's the person making the decision with
the evidence. I respect that, not just in my case but in all the
cases the last two years."</TE>

<HD>Black Colleges Diversify Appeals</HD>
<DH>Education: 48 schools add a fashion show and rap
performance at annual expo. 'You have to use imagination,' one
recruiter says.</DH>

<LD>The nation's historically black colleges and universities dangled
scholarships, tradition and the lure of personal attention in front
of thousands of California students Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Gathered at the Los Angeles Convention Center for the third annual
Black College Expo, 48 schools, most east of the Mississippi, mined a
mostly teenage crowd for next year's freshmen.</LD>
<LD>   The event blended traditional recruiting and information booths
with less bookish fare, including a fashion show and a performance by
rapper-crooner Nate Dogg.</LD>
<TE>   "You have to use imagination in your recruiting," said Fred M.
Williams, an alumnus manning Louisiana's Southern University booth.</TE>
<TE>   In the past few years, as enrollment has dipped somewhat at many
black colleges, they have stepped up their recruiting in Western
states, California in particular, Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   His alma mater is one of the better-known black colleges. It is
especially noted for its annual Bayou Classic football game against
Grambling State University, an event that features a dueling-bands
halftime show.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Williams, exhorting passersby to fill out information
cards, said he never stops recruiting, even in fast-food restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   "We graduate more African American engineering students than any
other school in the country," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We try to attract the best, but we want to give other students a
chance at college too."</TE>
<TE>   That willingness to give borderline students an opportunity was
expressed by many recruiters, who also touted a strong sense of
community.</TE>
<TE>   A recruiter for Savannah State University in Georgia, Tewana
LeCounte-Young, said that at the college she attended, which wasn't
primarily black, "nobody cared whether I graduated or not." She sees
the difference at Savannah, which her two sisters attended.</TE>
<TE>   "People stop me on campus all the time and ask how my sisters are
doing," she said. "If I go back to my old school, I doubt if anyone
would even recognize me."</TE>
<TE>   Kristle Hill, a 16-year-old sophomore from Beverly Hills High,
said she wants to go to Atlanta's Spelman College for women.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it would just be a different atmosphere, a way to get in
touch with my roots," she said. "A lot of people from my church have
gone to black colleges and moved on to better things after
graduating."</TE>
<TE>   Students often are surprised at the heavy workloads and the
diversity of opinion they find on even a mostly black campus, said
Excel A. Sharrief, a graduate of Morehouse College in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   "You see a lot of culture shock," he said. "Young people who might
think the black community is monolithic are often surprised when they
get to campus and run into black conservatives and people with all
kinds of different views."</TE>
<TE>   Many black colleges have a high percentage of "legacy students"
whose parents are alumni. Williams, of Southern University, said that
70% to 80% of its student body are legacy students.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course," he added, "We also have the Bayou Classic."</TE>

<HD>Latinos May Gain Majority in Another District</HD>
<DH>Redistricting: A panel redrawing the city's representation
map also would give the Valley additional seat of its own at City
Hall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The commission redrawing Los Angeles' 15 City Council districts on
Saturday moved toward increasing from four to five the number of
districts in which Latinos have sufficient voter strength to elect a
candidate.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles Redistricting Commission also endorsed an increase
of the number of districts wholly in the San Fernando Valley from
four to five, and agreed to maintain three districts where African
American voters can determine the winner.</LD>
<LD>   "We adopted some broad principles that will allow us to maintain
and/or increase representation throughout the city," said John
Emerson, chairman of the panel.</LD>
<TE>   The commission staff now will create a draft map of new council
boundaries for the commission to consider next week before beginning
another round of public hearings.</TE>
<TE>   The commission must make a final recommendation to the City
Council by March 1. The council, which has final say, should act by
July 1.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioners signaled that they want to "preserve existing
representational patterns" and demographic clusters that have allowed
Latinos to be elected to four council districts: the 1st, 13th, 14th
and the Valley's 7th. But panel members also see room for creation of
a fifth Latino district in the east San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Although race cannot be a predominant factor in drawing districts,
Latino civil rights groups have warned the panel that they will
challenge any plan that dilutes Latino voter strength in violation of
the U.S. Voting Rights Act.</TE>
<TE>   The panel noted that much of the growth in the city's Latino
population has occurred in the northeast Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioners indicated that a new Latino district probably would
be established in the east Valley by adopting a principle that "staff
must ensure that demographic, socioeconomic and cultural patterns and
communities of interest be carefully decided when forming the
boundaries for these five [Valley] districts."</TE>
<TE>   Alan Clayton of the California Latino Redistricting Coalition
testified that the growth in the Latino population in the northeast
Valley justifies two Valley seats where Latino voters could
predominate.</TE>
<TE>   With the Valley threatening secession, there are political
implications to the commission's endorsement Saturday of a fifth
district there.</TE>
<TE>   "The commission recognizes the tremendous increase in population
in the San Fernando Valley over the past decade," said Commissioner
Dan Garcia, who wrote the principles.</TE>
<TE>   The panel also voted to make "its best efforts to reduce and
eliminate splits of identified communities of interest." One panelist
noted that Van Nuys is divided among five council districts.</TE>
<TE>   But political fights are brewing.</TE>
<TE>   The map drafted by Latino groups would move the 6th Council
District represented by Councilwoman Ruth Galanter of Venice to the
east Valley and give much of the coastal area to the 11th District
represented by Cindy Miscikowski.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are going to have five Valley seats, somebody is going to
have to move," Clayton said.</TE>
<TE>   Galanter has said it is unfair to move her from a district she was
elected to represent. She countered by proposing that her 6th
District become a new coastal district combined with part of
Miscikowski's district and that the 11th District be moved to the
Valley, said Mike Bonin, an aide to Galanter.</TE>
<TE>   The new districts will take effect around Aug. 1.</TE>

<HD>Santa Barbara Trying to Curb '75-Minute Shuffle'</HD>
<DH>Parking: Officials come up with ways to deal with shortage.
Workers are now forced to constantly move their cars.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANICA BUTLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They drive to downtown Santa Barbara each morning--the unlucky ones
parking their cars on the street. Just 75 minutes later they emerge
from offices and stores, get in their cars and circle the streets in
search of another spot, reparking, then returning to work. They will
repeat the ritual throughout the workday.</LD>
<LD>   They call the phenomenon ''the 75-minute shuffle.'' Most
street-side parking in downtown Santa Barbara is limited to just that
time, forcing workers into a daily contest with tourists and
shoppers.</LD>
<LD>   Downtown has a shortage of about 1,800 spaces, officials say. They
planned it that way, the better to preserve the town's
hacienda-by-the-sea ambience by limiting parking lots and, hopefully,
traffic.</LD>
<TE>   ''We in Santa Barbara believe it's not a good idea to pave
paradise,'' said George Gerth, the city's manager of downtown
parking.</TE>
<TE>   But attempting to preserve Santa Barbara's charm has created the
daily parking and traffic shuffle, a situation city officials say
they also cannot abide.</TE>
<TE>   The solution? The city has devised incentives to persuade single
drivers to leave their cars at home.</TE>
<TE>   The city offers free bus passes to downtown workers and a $100
rebate for vanpool riders; it also subsidizes the vanpool service.
But the most novel innovation is cash prizes--a drawing for $200 a
day for drivers who leave their cars at home and walk, bike, carpool
or skateboard to downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Sixty-two downtown businesses have signed up to participate in the
''Try Something New'' program, said Mindy Norris, program
administrator with Traffic Solutions, the agency administering the
contest.</TE>
<TE>   Commuters will participate by keeping a daily log of how they get
to work. At the end of each month, the logs will be turned over to
Traffic Solutions. For each day that a worker uses an alternate mode
of transportation, his or her name will be entered into a drawing.</TE>
<TE>   The prize will be awarded in the form of a credit card with a
prepaid $200 limit, usable anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   The program begins with its first drawing in early February and
will continue until July. The city will pay out a total of $25,000 in
prizes, money that will come from fees businesses and individuals pay
to park in city-owned lots, said Victor Garza, superintendent of
parking and transportation management programs.</TE>
<TE>   Garza blames increasing development for exacerbating the parking
shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   ''There are more shops and businesses downtown,'' he said.
''Downtown Santa Barbara is a nice place to go, and people keep
coming.''</TE>
<TE>   Merchants agree.</TE>
<TE>   ''Sales have been going up over the past six years, and that's a
good barometer that there are more tourists,'' said Kate Schwab,
general manager of Borders Books &amp; Music on State Street. ''That's
great, but where are they going to park?''</TE>
<TE>   Schwab, a member of the Downtown Parking Committee, said the
promotion sounded both useful and fun.</TE>
<TE>   ''I thought my staff would be crazy about the $200-a-day
drawing,'' she said, adding that even though many of her 60 employees
already bike or ride the bus to work, there are some who probably
haven't really considered the alternatives available.</TE>
<TE>   Downtown parking manager Gerth said the city is adding 300 spaces
by turning a surface lot on Anacapa Street near the county courthouse
into a structure.</TE>
<TE>   But the city's principal approach will still be to encourage more
downtown employees to get out of their cars and leave parking spaces
for others.</TE>
<TE>   ''We'll address the rest of the demand through alternative
transportation methods,'' Gerth said. ''Employees use a parking spot
for eight hours. Or five shoppers can use the space that one employee
used. We get much better turnover when shoppers use the space.''</TE>
<TE>   But getting workers to leave their cars home may not prove as easy
as throwing cash their way.</TE>
<TE>   Jackie Manley is the human resources manager for downtown law firm
Hatch &amp; Parent, which has signed up for the ''Try Something New''
program. Manley said she doesn't think the $200 prize will be much of
an incentive for employees to change their single-driver ways.</TE>
<TE>   ''The first thing on people's minds is their convenience,'' she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Pedro Nava, an attorney on State Street, concurred. There are many
days when he needs his car to conduct business away from the office,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   That leaves him on the street, searching for spaces, especially by
noon, when all of the spaces in the city-owned lots are filled.</TE>
<TE>   ''I have a wristwatch with a timer,'' Nava explained. ''I have to
set it to go off every 65 minutes.''</TE>
<TE>   ''You know those people who want [fewer spaces] by design,'' he
complained. ''I bet those people have spots.''</TE>

<HD>GOP Hopefuls Court Moderate Group</HD>
<DH>Politics: Riordan and Simon take campaigns for governor to
the California Republican League's convention.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two multimillionaire friends and Republican candidates for
governor--one hoping to make the GOP a "party of inclusion," the
other positioning himself as "the true conservative"--took their
campaigns to the convention of one of the state's most liberal
Republican groups Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and Pacific Palisades
businessman Bill Simon Jr. were in North Hollywood to make their
pitch for an endorsement from the California Republican League. It's
a statewide group that often backs moderate Republicans, including
those who support abortion rights.</LD>
<LD>   It was friendly territory for Riordan, who has vocally supported
abortion rights on the trail and is angling to steal moderate votes
from Gov. Gray Davis in November.</LD>
<TE>   Riordan worked the cramped Holiday Inn ballroom, attracting
admirers at every turn.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, who opposes abortion and has never run for public office,
circulated less but chatted amiably with Riordan about last week's
primary debate.</TE>
<TE>   The former mayor drew applause when he began his speech by saying,
"We are part of a new Republican Party--a party of inclusiveness." As
he frequently has, Riordan depicted California as a state on the
verge of collapse and accused Davis of failing to manage it.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, who is leading his GOP rivals in early polls, compared
the state's position to that of Los Angeles after the Rodney King
riots, when Riordan won the mayor's office.</TE>
<TE>   "Why did I run for mayor? Because I felt there was a total vacuum
of leadership. . . . It is worse in Sacramento than it was in Los
Angeles nine years ago," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon acknowledged that he is an underdog in the scramble for the
nomination but said he is used to doing the impossible. He gave the
examples of helping fund the family-friendly television channel
PAX-TV and helping prosecute leaders of the five Mafia families when
he was a federal prosecutor in New York City in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, who has spent much of the primary campaign emphasizing his
conservative credentials, spoke only generally about broadening the
Republican Party.</TE>
<TE>   "We as a party have to pull on the same oar in order to take the
governor's office from Gray Davis," he said. "I think the way to do
that is welcome other people's points of view."</TE>
<TE>   The third Republican candidate for governor, Secretary of State
Bill Jones, held a news conference Friday in Fresno attacking Riordan
and Davis for accepting campaign contributions from scandal-plagued
Enron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "When it comes to ethics in government," Jones said, "you are
either part of the problem or part of the solution."</TE>

<HD>Western Wear Store Rides Into the Sunset</HD>
<DH>Antelope Valley: Circled by suburbs where commuters
outnumber cowboys, a Lancaster institution is closing down.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The proprietor of the Antelope Valley's last locally owned western
wear store has a passel of reasons for going out of business.</LD>
<LD>   The rise of the sneaker was a big blow to The Westerner, the
Lancaster institution that will close its doors sometime in the next
six weeks. So was the triumph of area shopping malls, which came at
the expense of downtown's Lancaster Boulevard, where the store's
hay-strewn display windows have been a fixture for nearly 30 years.</LD>
<LD>   Art Ekizian said he's calling it quits mostly because this
northernmost flank of Los Angeles County--once a dusty hinterland of
alfalfa farms and roughhewn rural folk--has finally been overtaken by
the forces of suburbia.</LD>
<TE>   "When I started, this place was rural," said Ekizian, 66. "And
during the Antelope Valley Fair, everybody dressed up western. I mean
everybody--from waitresses to receptionists.</TE>
<TE>   "That was my second Christmas. But it's a tradition that's been
lost."</TE>
<TE>   A touch of Wild West ambience has by no means vanished from these
parts. The towns of Acton and Agua Dulce are home to many horse
enthusiasts and the yearly rodeo still draws a crowd. Local nabobs
such as U.S. Rep. Howard P. "Buck" McKeon and Lancaster Mayor Frank
Roberts still clack through the halls of power in pointy-toed boots.</TE>
<TE>   The Westerner still attracts its share of weekend cowboys, but
Ekizian said the bread-and-butter customers--the kind who sport boots
and jeans every day--are vanishing. During the 1980s and '90s, the
Antelope Valley's building boom made it one of the fastest-growing
suburbs in Southern California. Although growth squeezed out the
farmers, it brought in construction workers equally fond of Justin
Ropers and Pendleton shirts.</TE>
<TE>   But it has been 22 years since John Travolta squeezed into his
Wranglers on screen in the film "Urban Cowboy," and the line dance
fad has long since faded. The boot du jour tends to be of the hiking
variety.</TE>
<TE>   The Antelope Valley's Howard &amp; Phil's Western Wear store folded in
1999 after the bankruptcy of its parent chain, which was owned by
McKeon's family. The Westerner's demise will leave only the Boot
Barn, part of a regional chain, located near the Target store.</TE>
<TE>   Pace of Development</TE>
<TE>   a Big Concern for City</TE>
<TE>   Boot Barn Manager Christine Coppini, an avid equestrian, said that
with 15 riding clubs and a few others dedicated to the art of roping,
the western life hasn't completely disappeared in these parts.</TE>
<TE>   "We had, like, 26 girls run for Miss Rodeo Lancaster last year,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   But a conversation with two 18-year-old members of Ekizian's sales
staff reveals the extent to which times have changed. Corey Jordan's
father is an aerospace engineer; Amanda Wiley's is a computer
programmer who never wears western duds. On a molasses-slow afternoon
recently, both girls were dressed in standard casual wear: no fringe,
no fancy arrow-point pockets, no hint of rootin' or tootin'.</TE>
<TE>   "Wait," Wiley said to Jordan over a soundtrack of piped-in twang.
"Didn't your dad used to have a hat?"</TE>
<TE>   "No, but he used to wear boots to work--you know, with the shirt
and tie." Jordan said. "Now he wears Adidas tennis shoes."</TE>
<TE>   The pending demise of Ekizian's store--and the unknown fate of the
8,000-square-foot space it occupies--comes during a political season
in which the future of downtown and the pace of development have
emerged as major issues. In recent years, the 25-year-old city's
redevelopment agency has aggressively wooed national retail chains
such as Costco and Wal-Mart, filling the area's wide-open spaces with
big boxes and blacktop. Norm Hickling, who is challenging Roberts in
the spring mayoral election, doesn't think Lancaster has done enough
to promote the sleepy commercial corridor in downtown. And another
mayoral candidate, William Fender, said he doesn't want the city
bringing new businesses "until we fill up all the empty buildings
first."</TE>
<TE>   Fender said he also wants to preserve what's left of Lancaster's
rural character. But David Myers, president of the Greater Antelope
Valley Economic Alliance, said that character has been a bit
misleading since World War II, when the country's top engineers came
to work in the area's aerospace industry.</TE>
<TE>   "People have called us the cultural backwater that produces the
most sophisticated technology ever known to man," he said. "But these
days, the ranches and farms are definitely being pushed out. The
ranchers are being pushed toward Tehachapi, and the farmers are being
pushed a little further east."</TE>
<TE>   According to alliance figures, just 1% of the Antelope Valley
population works in farming and ranching these days. Although
historical figures weren't available, Myers said that number was
"definitely much higher" 30 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Baggy Jeans</TE>
<TE>   Tell the Story</TE>
<TE>   At first glance, Ekizian comes across as a pretty good cowboy. He
dresses in the full western get-up--black boots, cowboy-cut Levi's
with a horseshoe belt buckle, a Panhandle Slim shirt with shiny pearl
pocket snaps.</TE>
<TE>   But the wire-rimmed glasses are those of a veteran high school
math teacher with little experience in the saddle. The jet-black,
apostrophe-shaped eyebrows are those of the son of Armenian
immigrants, and of one who realized, in mid-career, that he could
make a lot more money in retail.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't look so good in a hat," Ekizian said. "But I have worn
hats."</TE>
<TE>   These days, Ekizian said, you see a lot of western wear on the
Latino immigrants who have been flocking to the Antelope Valley for
its affordable housing. Though some of the newcomers have become
regular customers--Ekizian speaks just enough Spanish to get his
prices across--he said they haven't made up for lost business.</TE>
<TE>   Michoacan native Miguel Rangel, 56, was shopping for jeans
Thursday with his son Miguel Rubio, 24. The two had been attracted by
the liquidation sale signs. "I've dressed like a vaquero for years,"
Rangel said in Spanish as he searched the jeans aisle.</TE>
<TE>   Rubio followed behind, his baggy jeans flopping over a pair of
sneakers.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the generational difference," Rubio said. "He wants the
really tight pants, and I want them a little more casual."</TE>

<HD>Learning What Public Wants at Ambassador</HD>
<DH>Land use: The L.A. district hearing draws 500 with ideas
for the hotel site. The only sure thing is that at least one school
will be built.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIKA HAYASAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Name it after Robert F. Kennedy. Install an indoor public pool.
Convert old hotel rooms, where celebrities such as Charlie Chaplin,
William Randolph Hearst and Jean Harlow once slept, into classrooms.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 500 people showed up for a public hearing Saturday to offer
suggestions to Los Angeles Unified School District officials about
the future of the landmark Ambassador Hotel in the Mid-Wilshire
district.</LD>
<LD>   So far, no one is sure what exactly will happen to the 80-year-old
Wilshire Boulevard property, where celebrities partied in the 1930s
and 1940s, former presidents slept and presidential candidate Kennedy
was assassinated in 1968.</LD>
<TE>   The only guarantee is that the site will be use for a school.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anybody wants this building to be torn down," said
school board President Caprice Young. "The real question is whether
it is going to be possible to meet the needs of the students while
preserving the hotel."</TE>
<TE>   The district bought the Ambassador nearly a month ago after a
10-year legal battle with an investment group once led by Donald
Trump. The 24-acre site sold for $105 million.</TE>
<TE>   As part of its commitment to build 85 new schools over the next
six years, the district plans to use the site for at least one
campus, and maybe more. The Ambassador will relieve schools in the
area, which is so overcrowded that four campuses bus out 3,850
students each day.</TE>
<TE>   Community members, parents and business leaders who attended
Saturday's forum offered a hodgepodge of ideas.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Conservancy wants to restore the building and make
it a high school. The group suggests turning the ballroom--where
Kennedy, who had just won the state Democratic presidential primary,
gave a victory speech moments before he was killed--into a library.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Gibbons, 76, who brought a vintage Kennedy campaign button
that read: "Lower the voting age to 10," recommended posting quotes
from Kennedy on the walls of the school library or recreation room.</TE>
<TE>   "Bobby Kennedy was very much for students," Gibbons said. "If he
were alive today, he would say: Do what you can for the kids."</TE>
<TE>   Other suggestions included converting the Cocoanut Grove, a former
night spot in the hotel, into a school auditorium. Then, students
would be able to put on high school plays in the same room where
stars such as Bing Crosby and the Rhythm Boys, Peggy Lee and Barbra
Streisand once performed.</TE>
<TE>   Another idea: Restore the hotel lobby for a student gathering
place, so youths would be able to debate and socialize in the same
revival-style grand lobby where F. Scott Fitzgerald used to sit with
wife Zelda.</TE>
<TE>   Although members of the Wilshire business community want part of
the property for commercial development, most people who attended
Saturday's meeting brainstormed about the best educational uses. A
popular idea was to create specialized academies on the site that
focus on politics, law, architecture, social justice or
entertainment--all subjects that may be taught through the history of
the Ambassador.</TE>
<TE>   For example, some community members pointed out that then-Vice
President Richard Nixon wrote his famous 1952 Checkers speech at the
hotel. That fact, along with other such information could be woven
into a history and politics class.</TE>
<TE>   Henrietta Cosentino, 60, said: "Given that it is the site of one
of the most violent assassinations in our history ... it may be
important to have a center for the study of violence here."</TE>
<TE>   School building director Kathi Littmann said it will take at least
15 to 18 months to develop plans for how the Ambassador site will be
used.</TE>
<TE>   It may take as long as five years to complete the project.</TE>
<TE>   She said the district will consider community input and come up
with the best proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "There are such diverse opinions," Littmann said. "There's not
going to be an easy answer here."</TE>

<HD>Owner of Huge Flag Receives a Fitting Farewell</HD>
<DH>People: 'Ski' Demski's funeral features humor, patriotism
and a plexiglass coffin to display his tattoos.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY WRIDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Long Beach legend Thomas "Ski" Demski, the silver-bearded owner of
the world's largest American flag, was remembered at St. Anthony
Church on Saturday with the humor, patriotism and spectacle that
characterized his life.</LD>
<LD>   The quirky pageantry began with the procession of his plexiglass
casket, carrying his shirtless body to display his tattoos of flags,
eagles and Santa Claus. It ended with a rousing group sing-along of
"God Bless America."</LD>
<LD>   At his wake a few blocks away, hundreds of mourners--an amazing
range of age and class, from old Polish women of the parish to
veterans, homeless people and residents of his downtown
neighborhood--had enjoyed roast beef sandwiches and said farewell at
his coffin.</LD>
<TE>   It was mirrored so that his back tattoos could be viewed, and was
placed in his flag-draped garage, where visitors sat in folding
chairs and chatted over the periodic squawks of his two dozen birds
upstairs.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a hero not only for Long Beach but for the nation," Dave
San Jose, a pallbearer and Long Beach youth group leader, said as he
sat near a sign that read, "Don't touch the coffin."</TE>
<TE>   Glancing over at his old friend's casket, he explained, "I'm
waiting to spend a little time with him."</TE>
<TE>   It was a suitable send-off for a man who lived life so large, at
least the final few chapters. And he had choreographed all of it long
before he died Jan. 19 at age 72, having experienced multiple bypass
surgery, untreatable clogged arteries, gangrene and complications of
diabetes that friends say he ignored.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Demski held what he called a "fake wake" at his
longtime home, a converted duplex with red, white and blue awnings at
4th Street and Lime Avenue. He hired a hypnotist to help him remain
still for an hour, during which he lay inside the clear coffin while
friends dined on corned beef.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, inside the Roman Catholic church, lighted mostly by
stained-glass windows, Demski's funeral featured spirituals and
patriotic songs and white-robed clergy conducting what they
characterized as a memorial unique to Demski.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps inspired by Demski's lack of convention, Msgr. Ernest J.
Gualderon carried his microphone into the first rows of pews--rare,
parishioners said--and waxed sentimental about the deceased,
recalling some of their Sunday night dinners at a local Chinese
restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Father Richard Krekelberg noted that the Mass surprised some
people.</TE>
<TE>   "People said, 'Gee, Father, I didn't know Ski was Catholic.' "</TE>
<TE>   The priest called Demski's devotion to his flags and country his
"religion that revolved around patriotism."</TE>
<TE>   Demski was not always so passionate about the flags for which he
would ultimately become best known, nor did he serve in the military.
He was born and raised in Nanticoke, Pa., worked as a coal miner
until he was injured, and in the 1970s moved to Southern California.
He worked for years in construction until a disabling back injury
forced him to quit.</TE>
<TE>   He found his destiny while driving along the San Diego Freeway one
day more than 20 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Outside a car dealership, he gazed up at a gigantic billowing flag
and, as he would recall later, "I thought, 'That looks really good.
Why not try that?' "</TE>
<TE>   He soon erected a 132-foot flagpole outside his home and named it
The Pole, which carried twin meaning because of his Polish heritage.</TE>
<TE>   The flagpole was controversial. He hoisted a giant Old Glory that
irked some neighbors because the flapping flag caused a racket. He
also placed the ashes of a dear friend in the pole's crowning gold
eagle, even unsuccessfully asking the city to declare the pole a
cemetery to allow for the vertical entombment. The city refused, but
the burial somehow occurred anyway.</TE>
<TE>   It is his likely resting place as well.</TE>
<TE>   A perennial mayoral and City Council candidate, Demski was best
known for his prized flags, one of which is the size of three
football fields, weighs more than 3,000 pounds and requires hundreds
of people to unfurl.</TE>
<TE>   He dubbed this banner Superflag, and it draped Hoover Dam and
President Bush's inauguration. Other flags in Demski's collection
have been unfurled at Super Bowls. One of the most emotional displays
for him came when he hung one of his flags at the site of the former
World Trade Center in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, he put Superflag, which cost $80,000, up for sale. He
rented out his flags but usually lost money on the deals because of
travel costs. Demski, a recovering alcoholic, supported himself
making bumper stickers with 12-step slogans.</TE>
<TE>   His best friend, Jim Alexander, a retired Coast Guard commander,
met Demski during the flagpole tussles and helped him with his flag
business from then on. Alexander is executor and trustee of a living
trust that Demski created to support his flags, birds, home and
annual St. Patrick's Day meal for the homeless.</TE>
<TE>   "There will never be anybody else who will march to that drumbeat
of Ski's," Alexander, dressed in kilt, knee socks and vivid blue
blazer, said during the funeral. "But that beat's always in my
heart."</TE>
<TE>   The pallbearers wearing jeans and flag T-shirts; the acoustic
guitar and singing of every verse of "Amazing Grace"; his long hair
and beard unrestrained by a headband; the blue dress pants and
slippers--had the funeral and wake been close to what Demski ordered
up?</TE>
<TE>   "It was exactly as Ski wanted," Krekelberg said, laughing outside
the church. "He came to me four years ago with this."</TE>
<TE>   Even though the clear casket was covered by a flag, "I think he
still managed to peek out," the amused priest said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Demski was most famous for his flags, a generation of
children in Long Beach knew him primarily as Santa Claus. Each
Christmas Eve, he attended midnight Mass in costume, left a present
for the baby Jesus in the manger, "and outside the church he gave
away candy canes and flags. . . . Many children will remember him
most for that," Krekelberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Alexander said Demski was approached almost every day by a child
who called him the "real Santa." Even without his fur-trimmed red
costume, Demski was Santa, and lovingly played the part, Alexander
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was part of his magic," Alexander said, looking out his
friend's window at the front porch shrine of flowers, candles and
notes left at a bust of Demski.</TE>
<TE>   "We should all be so lucky, to have that little bit of Ski's
magic. It's why so many different kinds of people loved him," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Charter Schools and Wall of Separation</HD>
<DH>Education: Religious groups operating tax-supported
campuses have won praise from some, but critics question the
church-state ties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the Guidance Charter School in Palmdale, which shares its campus
with a mosque, the walls separating church and state are about six
feet high.</LD>
<LD>   The thin gray partitions allow Guidance Charter's 70 students to
use a mosque bathroom without viewing devotional acts in an adjacent
prayer room. The school's Muslim founders erected the walls as a 1st
Amendment concession.</LD>
<LD>   "We were ignorant," Principal Ali Hassan said with a sheepish
smile, "about mixing religion with the state."</LD>
<TE>   But the walls haven't satisfied those who say Guidance Charter
should not be receiving taxpayer money. Although its curriculum is
secular, the school has the likes of the American Civil Liberties
Union and the Anti-Defamation League concerned because of its ties to
the mosque and its plans to offer Koran classes after school.</TE>
<TE>   Opened in November, Guidance Charter is among a growing number of
California charter schools operating out of churches and mosques, a
situation that has raised murky legal issues. Guidance Charter
originally was going to be called the American Islamic School of
Antelope Valley, until administrators decided a nonreligious name was
more appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   About 30 of the elementary and middle school students are
non-Muslim. All students study Arabic as a second language.</TE>
<TE>   Aaron Levinson, Anti-Defamation League regional director, said the
school is "clearly violating 1st Amendment guidelines." The Palmdale
School District board, which voted 3-2 in October to approve Guidance
Charter's provisional charter, will decide in March whether to extend
the designation beyond the current school year.</TE>
<TE>   The school chairman, Gaber Mohamed, founded the Islamic institute
that runs the mosque. Guidance Charter rents its seven classrooms for
$1 per month from the institute, and mosque members are encouraged to
donate to the school.</TE>
<TE>   California charter schools have been around since 1992. The
schools are publicly funded but freed from many of the regulations
imposed on non-charter schools. In California, local school boards
approve charters; the state reviews only those applications that the
boards reject.</TE>
<TE>   The Palmdale board approved Guidance Charter despite numerous
issues raised by Framroze Virjee, the school district's attorney.
Virjee was particularly concerned about the school's location behind
the mosque.</TE>
<TE>   "There was the chance that there would be a sense of an implicit
imprimatur given by the district to the Islamic faith," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The law forbids religious instruction in publicly funded
classrooms. But federal courts have been rethinking the relationship
between public schools and religion, generally becoming more lenient.
And the California Department of Education has no policies on matters
such as after-school prayer on charter campuses, or the schools'
proximity to houses of worship, said state charter schools chief
Eileen Cubanski.</TE>
<TE>   Because religious affiliations aren't documented on the charter
school paperwork, Cubanski said, the state cannot determine precisely
how many of the 400 campuses have religious ties. But she said
anecdotal evidence suggests that religious groups are turning to the
charter system, their only means of obtaining public education
dollars.</TE>
<TE>   A Strong Sense of</TE>
<TE>   Community and Mission</TE>
<TE>   Charter school advocates such as David Patterson, government
liaison for the California Network of Educational Charters, say
religious groups can be ideal sponsors of charter schools. In inner
cities, the organizations often provide the best social services, and
their buildings are among the few with classroom space, the advocates
add.</TE>
<TE>   The groups also have a strong sense of community and mission, two
attributes sometimes lacking in public education, Patterson said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always somebody who says charters have got to be more
plain vanilla," he said. "Well, no. They are all mission-driven
schools.... That's what makes them work."</TE>
<TE>   In the Los Angeles area, charter schools with religious ties take
on various forms.</TE>
<TE>   Littlerock's Henry Hearns Charter School rents its classrooms from
the First Missionary Baptist Church and is named for its pastor;
Principal Patricia Rhodes said that although teachers never lead
students in prayer, spontaneous worshiping is common.</TE>
<TE>   In downtown Los Angeles, the Soledad Enrichment Action Charter
School educates troubled high school students. Its founder, Roman
Catholic Brother Modesto Leon, says he takes students on retreats to
"reflect on a higher power."</TE>
<TE>   In the Mid-Wilshire area, L.A. Unified's Camino Nuevo Charter
Academy rents classrooms from a Jewish temple on Wilshire, but has no
other relationship with it.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the appeal of charter schools lies in their autonomy from
rigid bureaucracies. But skeptics say that same freedom can make
crossing 1st Amendment lines easier.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a question of a trade-off," said Amy Stuart Wells, a
Columbia University education professor who studied charter schools
at UCLA. "We've opened up the system a little bit more, and it's
created some interesting educational environments. But in some cases,
we've also created some slippage in regard to allowing religious
activity."</TE>
<TE>   To ensure that does not happen in Palmdale, district officials
have been making surprise visits to Guidance Charter. So far, the
officials say, the school is living up to its word to keep religion
out of class.</TE>
<TE>   That was confirmed by many of the school's non-Muslim parents.
They say they like the values that govern Guidance Charter's
classrooms, and the school's zero-tolerance code of conduct.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not supposed to teach religion, and they don't," said
Deme Sewell, 30, who was waiting for her two boys recently in the
mosque parking lot. "And I like it because the class size is less
than 20 students."</TE>
<TE>   Directly Testing</TE>
<TE>   Church-State Boundary</TE>
<TE>   Some California charter schools have tested the church-state
boundary more directly than Guidance Charter has.</TE>
<TE>   In Sunnyvale, the Silicon Valley Academy--the satellite campus of
a Fresno-based charter school--was found to be teaching the Koran
during school hours in December, according to a Fresno district
spokeswoman. The campus' parent school, Gateway Academy, severed its
ties with the satellite campus as a result. Gateway has since lost
its charter for other reasons.</TE>
<TE>   In Nevada County's Twin Ridges district, a federal lawsuit filed
by parents and others accused a charter school of teaching religion.
The school uses the Waldorf educational method, which is based on the
philosophies of Austrian educator Rudolf Steiner, and includes
teachings about Christian saints and Biblical figures. The suit,
which also named a public school in the Sacramento area, was thrown
out in lower court and the plaintiffs have appealed.</TE>
<TE>   Guidance Charter has put off its after-school Koran classes until
the school board votes on extending the charter. School officials
also promise to move to a separate campus within three years, and say
they have taken pains to obey the letter and spirit of the law.</TE>
<TE>   Hassan, an Egyptian native who holds a UCLA doctorate in Islamic
history, has given up his Friday sermons and discussions at the
mosque.</TE>
<TE>   Hassan--a bearded, soft-spoken man with a taste for
double-breasted suits--said it was a difficult decision. Since the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, many less devout Muslims have returned to
the mosque to learn more about their religion, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're in Rome, you've got to do as the Romans do," he said.
"We are Americans, and we have to conform to the Constitution of this
land."</TE>
<TE>   Coloring-book Christmas trees still on display in a window were
the sole outward sign of religion in the classrooms. Only one of the
school's five teachers--Arabic instructor Randa Abdelshafy--is
Muslim.</TE>
<TE>   During her high-energy lessons, Abdelshafy scrupulously avoids
words with a religious bent--even the common greeting "Salaam
aleikum," or "Peace be with you."</TE>
<TE>   Yet for the children--as well as their parents--the secular and
religious can still get a little mixed up. After school, a young
student made a point of running up to a visitor to shout, "Hey, we're
not of this religion. We're Christians!"</TE>
<TE>   When parent Shahid Khurshid came to pick up his children, he gave
Hassan a $200 check. When the principal asked whether it was for the
mosque or the school, Khurshid said, "Whatever."</TE>
<TE>   Khurshid, a 34-year-old gas station owner, said he was happy with
Guidance Charter. But he said he wishes his children were learning
more about their religion.</TE>
<TE>   "If [the school] doesn't teach them," he said, "I guess I will
have to teach them at home."</TE>

<HD>2 Portraits of Grandmother's Killer Emerge</HD>
<DH>Justice: Stephen W. Anderson is seen as a 'poster child for
the death penalty' and as an abused child and sensitive poet failed
by the legal system.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He is an instinctual killer, the government believes, a Vegas hit
man, a "poster child for the death penalty" who learned how
effortless murder can be when he caught a bird as a young man and
crushed it in his palm without a second thought.</LD>
<LD>   Years later, after he shot a grandmother in the face, prosecutors
say, he cooked himself noodles in her kitchen and poured himself a
glass of milk while she died. He would say later that he made just
two mistakes: not getting out of the house sooner, and not trying to
shoot his way past the cops once he was caught.</LD>
<LD>   That's half the story.</LD>
<TE>   Stephen Wayne Anderson, 48, scheduled to die by lethal injection
Tuesday morning at San Quentin State Prison, also has an IQ of 136.
Beaten as a boy, disowned at 17 and forced to live outdoors and alone
in the hills of New Mexico, he has become an accomplished poet,
writing behind bars about the smell of honeysuckle and the wind
tickling the trees in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   His supporters say he made up the hit man stuff, and many law
enforcement officials are starting to agree. Friends say he never
meant to kill, that he is the hapless target of cowboy prosecutors
determined to see San Bernardino County's first death penalty case in
40 years to its ultimate conclusion. For the first time in
California, his victims' survivors unanimously support his bid for
clemency.</TE>
<TE>   His trial attorney was so incompetent that two other killers
represented by the same man have had their death sentences thrown
out. He is the linchpin of allegations that Gov. Gray Davis should no
longer address clemency pleas because he has never agreed to one--and
has suggested that he never will in a murder case. Indeed, Davis
denied Anderson's clemency bid Saturday, saying there is "no question
of his guilt."</TE>
<TE>   All told, Anderson's is one of the most convoluted cases to emerge
from San Quentin, and is emblematic of the passion--and
ambivalence--surrounding the debate over government-sponsored
execution.</TE>
<TE>   "This one," said Robert S. Horwitz, one of the lawyers fighting
for an unlikely eleventh-hour reprieve, "has a lot of baggage."</TE>
<TE>   With the governor's decision this weekend, it is now virtually
certain that Anderson will be put to death early Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Prison workers will open the tap of an intravenous line,
delivering three drugs into Anderson's bloodstream. Each is lethal on
its own. When served as a cocktail, they are more than sufficient.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson, bearded and portly with an easy smile, would be the 10th
man executed in California since voters reinstated capital punishment
in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, in the days leading to the execution, two strikingly
different portraits of Anderson have emerged.</TE>
<TE>   There is the yin--the premeditated murderer who may have killed as
many as nine people, who once befriended a prison guard, then told
his new pal he'd kill him in a jiffy if it meant escaping from
custody.</TE>
<TE>   And there is the yang--the troubled, railroad-hopping hobo who
blossomed into a poet and an intellectual, the fumbling burglar who
fired his gun in the dark only when he panicked.</TE>
<TE>   The surprising footprint of Anderson's case on those who have come
in contact with him began the very night he was arrested. It was
Memorial Day 1980. A San Bernardino County sheriff's deputy drove him
away from a small home in Bloomington, an unincorporated community
near Fontana, where he'd just shot and killed 81-year-old Elizabeth
Lyman, a retired piano teacher.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson asked whether California enforced the death penalty. "I
hope so," he said. "I want out of this mess."</TE>
<TE>   A homeless drifter who was riding the rails after escaping
prison in Utah, where he was being held on several burglary charges,
Anderson landed in Bloomington in spring 1980.</TE>
<TE>   After casing the house of his victim for two days, he was sure no
one was home--mostly because he saw no car in the driveway, his legal
team has argued. But Lyman did not have a car, and she was inside.</TE>
<TE>   On May 26, Anderson drank a pint of vodka, according to his
lawyers, and then, shortly after midnight, spent an hour prying the
hinges off the door.</TE>
<TE>   When he walked into the bedroom, looking for cash, Lyman rose from
her sleep. Anderson turned and shot her under the left eye with a
.45-caliber handgun.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say he had taped down the gun's safety to ensure that
it would fire quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Then, law enforcement officers say--though it's one of many
disputed facts in the case--he fixed himself a bowl of noodles.</TE>
<TE>   "He simply made himself at home," David Whitney, San Bernardino
County's lead deputy district attorney, wrote to the governor earlier
this month.</TE>
<TE>   Said Wes Daw, one of the original investigators in the case: "His
hunger outweighed his conscience."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson does not dispute charges that he pulled the trigger,
though his supporters argue that instead of carrying out a
premeditated killing, he panicked and shot wildly in the dark when
Lyman rose from her bed.</TE>
<TE>   When deputies arrived, Anderson chuckled about how he'd been
caught in someone else's home in the middle of the night wearing dark
clothes and gloves. Not exactly a tough case to crack. Authorities
suspect Anderson stabbed a fellow inmate to death in 1977 in Utah,
escaped custody and in 1980 shot a man to death in a murder-for-hire
and killed six others while operating as a "hit man" in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers argue that none of it ever happened. They say
Anderson was probably involved only in the death of the inmate,
Robert Blundell, and even that, they argue, was self-defense.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson now denies the crimes, and his defense team believes he
delivered "false confessions" to the murders-for-hire because he was
suicidal after being arrested in the Lyman murder. Authorities
concede that they've never been able to prove that the "hit man"
murders even occurred. Still, Whitney cited all of it in his letter
asking that the execution proceed as planned.</TE>
<TE>   "As some of the officers have put it, he's a poster child for the
death penalty," Whitney said in an interview. "It's not about what's
best for the defendant."</TE>
<TE>   That may be the only thing the two sides agree on.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives of Lyman and Blundell wrote letters supporting
Anderson's bid for clemency--asking that his sentence be commuted to
life in prison without possibility of parole.</TE>
<TE>   "While we deeply miss our son and brother ... executing Stephen
Anderson will not replace our loss nor bring us any relief,"
Blundell's mother, Lois Smith, wrote to court officials last year.
"We do not want or need Stephen Anderson to die for the death of our
loved one."</TE>
<TE>   So who wants Anderson to die, besides the prosecution?</TE>
<TE>   The answer, his attorneys claim, is no one.</TE>
<TE>   "That should be something that would weigh in this," said Marie
Stratton, the Los Angeles-based federal public defender.</TE>
<TE>   'We Let Juries</TE>
<TE>   and Courts Decide'</TE>
<TE>   Whitney scoffed at the argument, asserting that his "client" is
the public.</TE>
<TE>   "We let juries and courts decide," he said. "Murders are cases
against the state, against society in general."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson also has been the focus of an unusual appeal in which his
attorneys argued that Davis should recuse himself from clemency
requests.</TE>
<TE>   The governor has rejected recommendations that dozens of killers
be released from prison, and he has now thrown out all four clemency
petitions he has received in the last three years. In interviews,
Davis has said that "if you take someone else's life, forget it."</TE>
<TE>   "No mercy," Margo Rocconi, another Anderson lawyer, told
corrections officials earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   Ward Campbell, a supervising deputy attorney general in
Sacramento, said in an interview that courts have ruled that even if
Davis had a blanket policy against clemency, that would not violate
the Constitution. No one has proven that the governor has such a
policy, he said, and a federal appeals court agreed Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson's defense team also laments his representation--or lack
thereof--by S. Donald Ames, a flamboyant San Bernardino County
attorney who died two years ago. The court appointed Ames to
represent Anderson because the defendant had no money.</TE>
<TE>   Federal judges have commuted two other death sentences to life
prison terms because of Ames' work. In those cases, federal judges
found that being represented by Ames was "the equivalent of no
counsel at all." Ames once said his own client "deserves to fry."</TE>
<TE>   Preparation, Anderson's attorneys have wrote, "was something of
which Mr. Ames was congenitally incapable."</TE>
<TE>   Ames also said Anderson refused to give him names of witnesses to
call when the jury was weighing the death penalty. According to
federal judges who investigated, Ames' own notes indicate that
Anderson gave the attorney the names of many witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Most importantly, Ames did not delve into Anderson's past, which,
his supporters say, explains quite a bit.</TE>
<TE>   Born to a coal miner's daughter and an alcoholic oil worker,
Anderson and his younger brother, Ken, were beaten as children,
according to Anderson's clemency appeal. The family was unable to
afford food at times.</TE>
<TE>   "I dreaded the days that you boys were born," their mother,
Goldie, told her sons. She told neighbors that she preferred her dogs
to her children.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson learned to protect his brother from their
parents. Because their mother would get upset when young Ken soiled his
diaper, Anderson learned to change diapers.</TE>
<TE>   That pattern would continue. In 1971, Stephen, afraid for his
brother's safety, took the blame when Ken threw a party at their
Farmington, N.M., home.</TE>
<TE>   "If Stevie had tried to hit back I think Dad would have
killed him," Ken wrote in court documents. "Finally ... he screamed at him
to pack his bags and get out of the house."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson camped in the hills surrounding town.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't think he ever had a chance," Rocconi said.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors weighing whether the state should execute Anderson learned
little about his past, his new attorneys say. Three jurors have
written the state, saying they would have voted for life in prison if
they had learned more about Anderson's background. One said she
remains haunted by the case.</TE>
<TE>   Wrote Award-Winning</TE>
<TE>   Poems and Essays</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Whitney defended Ames, saying he was a friend
and "one of the better defense attorneys in our county."</TE>
<TE>   In December, 19 U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals judges ruled that
Ames did not violate Anderson's right to a fair trial. Six judges
disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "If the courts appoint incompetent counsel ... we should not then
compound that judicial error by permitting the state to execute the
ill-represented defendant," they wrote. "The system has now failed
doubly in Stephen Anderson's case."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson will leave behind hundreds of award-winning poems and
essays--and a powerful connection with people who helped him through
an intellectual resurrection. Many of his works delved into his
extensive time spent behind bars, including a 1993 piece called
"Stone":</TE>
<TE>   Barely remaining sane, he wept demanding release; yet somehow he
knew those shouts were in vain. Sinners such as him were granted no
peace. So, trapped between agony and pride ... he wept upon a
concrete bed, remembering all the mistakes he'd made.</TE>
<TE>   "He was totally different from what I expected, in
his intelligence, his talent and his sensitivity to other people,"
Horwitz said.</TE>
<TE>   None of these issues, his supporters concede, make Anderson a
saint. But they are enough, they argue, to have spared him from
execution and condemn him instead to life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Bell Chevigny, a volunteer with a prison-writing program in New
York who edited an anthology that included an Anderson piece, began
corresponding with him through letters regularly in the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "He is the most peaceful and compassionate person," she
said through tears. "I think the state's humanity falls short of his at
this point."</TE>
<TE>   Davis disagreed Saturday in a 34-page document denying clemency,
saying Anderson is indeed smart--smart enough to know better.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson, the governor wrote, "is an extremely intelligent man.
But his intelligence, ironically, also makes the brutality and
indifference of his crimes all the more reprehensible."</TE>

<HD>State's a Tough Audience for Riordan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER H. KING</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here is a curious bit of California political trivia. Only one Los
Angeles mayor has ever gone on to become governor of California, and
that isolated case happens to be overgrown with asterisks. William
Dennison Stephens was appointed in 1909 to replace a Los Angeles
mayor who had quit under threat of recall. Stephens' tenure lasted
only nine days--just long enough to organize a special election to
select his successor.</LD>
<LD>   Seven years later, the serendipitous Stephens was picked by Gov.
Hiram Johnson to replace the lieutenant governor, who had
disqualified himself for office by dying. Shortly thereafter, Johnson
was elected to the U.S. Senate, leading to Stephens' automatic
promotion to the office of governor.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, several L.A. mayors have attempted to vault from City
Hall to statewide, or even national, glory. The late Tom Bradley came
closest, losing the governorship by a whisper in 1982 to Republican
George Deukmejian. Still, Stephens remains the exception that
underscores the rule: Los Angeles mayors have had trouble moving up
the political ladder.</LD>
<TE>   And now, of course, comes Dick Riordan, former Los Angeles mayor
and would-be unseater of California's fund-raiser in chief, Gov. Gray
Davis. At present, Riordan would seem well-positioned to go where
only William Dennison Stephens has gone before. Polls show him far
ahead of his two rivals for the Republican nomination: Bill Jones,
the earnest but underfunded secretary of state, and Bill Simon Jr.,
son of William Simon.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan's got plenty of money to buy commercial air time and
advisors. He also has a swell slogan: "Tough enough to turn
California around." This battle cry might sound familiar to Los
Angeles voters who recall Riordan's 1993 campaign for mayor. In that
effort he touted himself as the candidate "tough enough to turn
around" Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   As he geared up to run for governor, I imagine Riordan reasoned
that, since "tough enough," etc., worked so well in Los Angeles, why
not trot it out for the California race? In a larger sense, though,
such thinking goes to the fundamental premise of the Riordan
candidacy: What worked for Los Angeles also will work for California;
Riordan can "turn around" the state in the same way he "turned
around" its biggest city.</TE>
<TE>   In short, he's running on his record as L.A. mayor. And here, I
would suggest, is where Riordan bumps up hard against what might be
called the William Dennison Stephens factor. There must be a reason
no Los Angeles mayor but Stephens has advanced to the governor's
office, but what?</TE>
<TE>   Does the city elect defective mayors? Is there something about the
job that saps political strength, rendering mayors too weary and weak
to take the good fight to the next level? Or could it be that
Californians who live north of the Tehachapis still resent the water
that flows down the state?</TE>
<TE>   Now, before this goes any further, a couple of distinctions must
be made. There are many Los Angeles-based politicians who have won
statewide office--Gray Davis, to cite an obvious example. The
discussion here is limited to mayors. It also should be noted that
mayors from any California city, not just Los Angeles, seem to have
trouble following the yellow brick road to Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "Sunny Jim" Rolph, the researchers tell me, was the last San
Francisco mayor to be elected governor, and that was in 1931.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, Pete Wilson pulled it off, but only after he served
first in the U.S. Senate. Besides, Wilson had been mayor of San
Diego--something of an innocent bystander in California's great
north-south rivalry. This, I would submit, might be a clue.</TE>
<TE>   The working premise here is that the political fortunes of L.A.'s
mayors have been undercut by the way the rest of California tends to
regard the city--which is to say, as something less than the urban
ideal.</TE>
<TE>   Before World War II, Los Angeles was dismissed by Northern
Californian snobs as an overgrown cow town. With the postwar boom,
Los Angeles gained power, prosperity and, more than anything,
population, and yet it still was looked down upon by the rest of the
state.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. was--and arguably still is--seen beyond the basin as the
demon city, a sprawling, besmogged lesson in the many ways a
metropolis can stumble. Drop in on City Council meetings in any
California town or burg. Eureka, Turlock, El Cajon--it doesn't
matter. Almost without fail, sooner or later, someone will rise up
from the crowd to sound an alarm: Mark my words. If we approve this
(housing tract/strip mall/freeway extension: pick one) we're going to
become ... "another L.A.!" At which point, everybody gasps.</TE>
<TE>   Now I know, I know, this is patently unfair and often rooted in
ignorance. L.A. bashers tend to be Californians who judge the city
based solely on what they see from car windows while blowing down the
Golden State Freeway en route to Disneyland. Forget about a Getty;
many of them would be happy if their hometown could attract just one
lousy Krispy Kreme franchise.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, this is what Riordan faces in his effort to knock
William Stephens from the record books. Before he can win a shot at
turning around California, Riordan must first turn around
Californians' perceptions about Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   His candidacy is built on the presumption Californians believe--or
at least can be persuaded--that L.A. "turned around" in his time as
mayor. It further assumes that they will see in his Los Angeles
experience solutions for all of California. A tough sell.</TE>

<LD>All parties held high hopes for the upscale restaurant planned for a
Montebello hilltop.</LD>
<LD>   For Latino recording superstar Juan Gabriel and his Pico
Rivera-based promoter, the Noa Noa restaurant was to be the flagship
in a first-of-its-kind national chain--the Latin equivalent of the
Hard Rock Cafes.</LD>
<LD>   More than two years later, there is no Noa Noa. Instead,
litigation pits Ralph Hauser III--Gabriel's promoter--against Henry
Attina, the Montebello restaurateur who was to build Noa Noa on his
property.</LD>
<TE>   The embittered relationships also involve the Montebello City
Council, which gave Attina a loan to bring the project to town.</TE>
<TE>   For Attina, an established businessman with a lengthy relationship
with council members and city staff, it was a chance to develop his
land with generous help from the city.</TE>
<TE>   The council wanted Noa Noa--or a comparable establishment--to open
in its town badly enough to give Attina a $1.06-million loan he did
not have to repay if he met certain conditions.</TE>
<TE>   The council approved the loan over the objections of a few
Montebello residents who said the transaction was funding a
businessman with city connections.</TE>
<TE>   Attina did build a facility he intends to lease partly as a
restaurant. But Noa Noa--which made entertainment news locally and in
Gabriel's native Mexico when it was announced--is all but history.</TE>
<TE>   In a trial scheduled to begin Monday in Los Angeles Superior
Court, a complaint by Hauser says he was misled by Attina about the
features the restaurant would contain--forcing him to rescind a lease
he had signed.</TE>
<TE>   Hauser has also said his singing star's name, without Hauser's
knowledge, was opportunistically used by Attina and the City Council
in granting public funds.</TE>
<TE>   "Two people have been had," Hauser said in an interview. "The city
of Montebello and my artist."</TE>
<TE>   A cross complaint by Attina seeks to hold Hauser financially
accountable for signing a lease that Attina claims both parties
repeatedly revised.</TE>
<TE>   After litigation began, Hauser wrote a letter to the media
criticizing the council for giving Attina what he said was a gift of
public funds for a project that has not been delivered.</TE>
<TE>   Montebello City Council members--who did not respond to requests
for interviews--wrote Hauser back.</TE>
<TE>   They defended Attina as a respected longtime businessman. They
said Hauser's letter was erroneous and an attempt to litigate in the
media.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me reassure you," City Atty. Arnold Alvarez-Glasman wrote to
Hauser, "the manner in which you do business is not welcomed in the
city of Montebello."</TE>
<TE>   The idea for Noa Noa was much more noble.</TE>
<TE>   Hauser and Gabriel--who owns a Malibu estate--wanted to open it as
a tribute to the entertainer's humble origins.</TE>
<TE>   Gabriel's story includes an orphanage in Mexico where his mother,
unable to feed him, left him at age 4. They later reunited.</TE>
<TE>   As a teenager, one of his first singing gigs was at a club called
El Noa Noa. Later, he recorded a song and made a movie by the same
name that helped make him internationally famous.</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, his yearly October concerts at the Universal
Amphitheatre routinely sell out.</TE>
<TE>   The Montebello Noa Noa was to bring to town Latin American stars
and media to cover news conferences.</TE>
<TE>   Other celebrities who wanted to invest in Noa Noa were Mexican
singing stars Vicente and Alejandro Fernandez and Ana Gabriel, Hauser
said.</TE>
<TE>   When Hauser drove past a lot in the Montebello Town Square, the
site at the western edge of the San Gabriel Valley seemed ideal.</TE>
<TE>   The owner was Attina.</TE>
<TE>   Attina's company, Prime Cut Inc., for years has operated a
restaurant now called Tortillas in another part of town.</TE>
<TE>   And over the years, he had nurtured relationships with a string of
council members.</TE>
<TE>   Contributions by Attina and his company to council members'
campaigns have included cash donations, food for campaign events and
hosting fund-raisers at his restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Attina has obtained public funding in the past from the Montebello
and South Gate city councils to build senior-citizen housing.</TE>
<TE>   The Montebello council's effort to bring a classy restaurant to
town dates to the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Back then, as part of a deal with developer Alexander Haagen to
build the Montebello Town Square, the city required that a restaurant
be included.</TE>
<TE>   Haagen sold 40,000 square feet in the mall to Attina, according to
city documents.</TE>
<TE>   By early 1999, Attina and Hauser had met.</TE>
<TE>   Attina didn't know much about Latin music. In his deposition for
the current litigation, he recalled a conversation with a real estate
broker: "He said, 'I have somebody here that is very famous, and
blah, blah, blah, and this and that, in the music industry.' "</TE>
<TE>   By that fall, Attina had talked individually with at least four
council members--Kathy Salazar, Ed Vasquez, Mary Anne Saucedo and
William Molinari--and decided that he could get a forgivable loan.</TE>
<TE>   The council--acting as the Community Redevelopment
Agency--required that Attina produce a signed lease with "Juan
Gabriel's Noa Noa" or a comparable restaurant before approving the
loan.</TE>
<TE>   The comparable restaurant was "defined as Hard Rock Cafe, Planet
Hollywood, Crocodile Cafe or other restaurant of similar style, menu,
decor and service."</TE>
<TE>   The council approved the deal containing the loan Aug. 17, 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Attina's Prime Cut was to start making payments of $149,500 a year
starting Sept. 1, 2000. But the payments would be forgiven if by then
the company had met five conditions.</TE>
<TE>   One was that Juan Gabriel's Noa Noa or a comparable restaurant
would be open.</TE>
<TE>   Another was that the improvement to the land be worth at least $2
million so it would produce a minimum of $20,000 in taxes for the
city each year. By comparison, Hauser's monthly rent for the
restaurant would have been at least $15,000.</TE>
<TE>   Construction didn't go anywhere fast.</TE>
<TE>   In the next few months, Attina complained that Hauser was slow in
providing plans for the interior of the building. After he signed the
lease, Hauser said Attina reneged on key oral agreements concerning
the design.</TE>
<TE>   One of Attina's arguments in the case is that the lease stated
that no oral agreements had been made. Hauser said oral commitments
are common in his industry.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll hold dates at Madison [Square] Garden on a phone call," he
said. "I'm used to dealing with people with impeccable reputations."</TE>
<TE>   Hauser rescinded the lease in late 2000--particularly irked that
the plans no longer included a patio. The trial will determine, among
other things, whether Hauser was owed a patio.</TE>
<TE>   Hauser said he and Gabriel still hope to launch their restaurant
chain someday. "I wasn't asking for the moon or the stars," Hauser
said of the failed venture, "only something that was nice."</TE>

<HD>Trail Advocates Say 'Whoa' to Home Projects</HD>
<DH>Land: Activists battle development in the San Gabriels'
foothills. From Claremont to Altadena, bids to save mountain paths
and wildlife are booming.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE CHAVEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They converged Saturday on an Altadena park on horseback and booted
foot, some 200 horse people and hikers united by a goal: Save the
trails.</LD>
<LD>   They proclaimed their abhorrence of locked gates and asphalt,
agreed that the danger of riding horses down busy streets gives them
the jitters, and uttered the words "trail break" as if they were
cussing.</LD>
<LD>   Theirs is a crusade that has become more urgent among
conservationists along the San Gabriel Mountain foothills. From
Claremont to Altadena, land conservancies recently have been born and
new coalitions formed to preserve the mountain slopes from luxury
housing tracts and other developments creeping deeper and deeper into
forest land.</LD>
<TE>   Sierra Madre this month rejected a private high school in its
foothills, and recently Azusa, after voting down a 1,600-home
development, decided to sponsor a contest for urban design that would
best protect its mountain bluffs and wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   "Parts of trails just don't exist anymore. They're gone. They're
grown over. They're over," Tracy Sullivan, a leader of Altadena
Equestrian Resources, shouted over a loudspeaker as the horseback
riders gathered. "We can't be riding horses and competing with cars."</TE>
<TE>   During their demonstration ride and hike on a crisp but hazy
morning, these mountain lovers called on Los Angeles County officials
and the developer of 272 new, red-tile-roof houses to make good on
long-ago promises to improve their local park and maintain access to
public trails.</TE>
<TE>   In Altadena, an ethnically diverse community of 42,610 just 20
minutes northeast of downtown Los Angeles, equestrians, mountain
bikers, hikers and conservation groups intend to sound loud the alarm
over their disappearing trails and aging equestrian facilities.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to demonstrate and show that this community wants to
preserve it rural atmosphere," Sullivan said.</TE>
<TE>   Their frustration is focused on what has long been a flash point
of controversy in Altadena: La Vina, the housing project.</TE>
<TE>   The terra cotta development is in its last phase of completion
after 15 torturous years of debates, protests, lawsuits and approval
by the county Board of Supervisors in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   The project has changed hands at least once, and is being
completed by Brookfield Homes in Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   The Altadena coalition, which includes many longtime residents who
fought against the project years ago, says the developer has failed
to deliver on pledges that included protecting existing trails,
redesigning others and installing rider-controlled traffic signals.</TE>
<TE>   To them, the development is one massive trail break that paved
over a wide swath of their beloved Altadena Crest Trail.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, I feel sad in a way when I see it," said Camille Dudley, a
longtime Altadena horse owner who opposed La Vina. "But we are not
defeated. A lot of what we do has brought attention to the trails."</TE>
<TE>   Ted McKibben, a vice president with Brookfield, said the goal of
his company "is to cooperate with the county of Los Angeles and to
ensure that all required improvements that were agreed to under the
entitlement are honored."</TE>
<TE>   But just what exactly was agreed to back in 1992 is about to come
under scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Mike Antonovich, whose district includes Altadena and
who voted for the project 10 years ago, intends to call for an audit
of La Vina to determine whether the developer has met all the
conditions of approval.</TE>
<TE>   "I was appalled to discover that numerous conditions have not yet
been fulfilled," states the motion he intends to introduce Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   These include street improvements, questions over trail linkages
and access, and confusion over construction of a parking lot for Loma
Alta Park, said Jennifer Plaisted, Antonovich's senior deputy in
Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to get to the bottom of this," she said. "Basically, it
comes down to: The community says one thing, the [county] departments
say one thing . . . and we don't know all the answers."</TE>
<TE>   Back on the mountain, the problems are as plain as a cutoff trail.
One sign, in particular, points west to the "Altadena" trail, which
abruptly ends at a paved road 20 yards away.</TE>
<TE>   It's not just big new developments, said horse owner Bonnie
Hedrick, pointing westward.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the rains that washed out a section here. It's that house
that blocks access over there," she said. "Over time it gets eaten
away."</TE>
<TE>   The Altadenans also want to help revise plans for a new gymnasium
at the park, which they believe dangerously collides with equestrian
interests. Currently, the plan calls for a horse trail link, a
pedestrian drop-off lane and the gym to be squeezed onto one parcel.</TE>
<TE>   And they want the county to improve the park's riding arena, which
was deemed too small for formal riding events. Such community
gatherings as a Juneteenth celebration and Black Rodeo have moved
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan and her group fear that this will slowly erode their
sense of community.</TE>
<TE>   "What has united us is our love of the mountains," she said,
adding that in Altadena, residents can walk out their back doors in
search of seasonal streams and verdant gullies.</TE>
<TE>   "The trails are integral to keeping this community together."</TE>

<HD>N. O'Connor, 76; Revived Ad Agency</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Neal W. O'Connor, who reinvigorated Ayer, America's oldest
advertising agency, during his tenure as chairman and chief executive
in the late 1960s and '70s, has died. He was 76.</LD>
<LD>   O'Connor died Jan. 18 in Princeton, N.J., of complications from
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's
disease.</LD>
<LD>   O'Connor joined the 132-year-old New York City-based agency, then
headquartered in Philadelphia and known as N.W. Ayer &amp; Son, as a
junior account executive in 1949. He advanced rapidly in account
management positions and became president in 1964 at age 39. He was
promoted to chairman and chief executive in 1966.</LD>
<TE>   Among the familiar ad campaigns during O'Connor's tenure were for
AT&amp;T ("Long distance is the next best thing to being there"), John
Deere ("Nothing runs like a Deere") and United Airlines ("The extra
care airlines").</TE>
<TE>   Ayer was founded in Philadelphia in 1869 by Francis Wayland Ayer,
a 21-year-old college graduate who abandoned the idea of being a
teacher to become an entrepreneur selling newspaper ads. He named the
agency after his father and first partner, Nathan Wheeler Ayer.</TE>
<TE>   As Advertising Age noted in 1994, the agency has practically been
defined by its firsts: The first color ad (in 1893 for Mellin's
Food), the first two-color inserts in magazines (in 1895 for Fairbank
soap), the first million-dollar advertising campaign (in 1899 for
"Uneeda Biscuit" for the National Biscuit Co.), and the first
advertiser-sponsored radio broadcast (in 1922 for Shur-on Optical
Co., over KDKA in Pittsburgh).</TE>
<TE>   The National Biscuit Co. (now Nabisco) was Ayer's breakthrough
account. The agency coordinated the packaging, trademarks, media and
selling for Uneeda biscuits, thus turning a commodity into a
distinctive brand.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next few decades, Ayer attracted a host of blue-chip
clients, ranging from AT&amp;T to Ford Motor Co., and generated memorable
advertising slogans such as "I'd walk a mile for a Camel" (Camel
cigarettes), "When it rains, it pours" (Morton Salt), "Head for the
hills" (Hills Bros. coffee) and "A diamond is forever" (DeBeers).</TE>
<TE>   But in the mid-1960s, the agency suffered the crushing loss of
several major accounts, including Hills Bros. coffee, United Airlines
and--most significantly--its $30-million Plymouth account, the
biggest loss of an advertising client in history at the time and
representing nearly a quarter of Ayer's billings.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connor rose to the top of the company during those troubled
years--president in 1964 and chief executive in 1966.</TE>
<TE>   He said in a 1980 interview that former Chairman Harry A. Batten
"had been a president, too, at 39, and he wanted a young man in his
own image, someone who wouldn't make trouble and wouldn't rock the
boat. But I did institute change, and I'm sure I disappointed him
greatly before he died."</TE>
<TE>   O'Connor downplayed his role, however, saying he was only the
catalyst.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a whole group of concerned guys all screaming for
change," he said. "One thing good about a crisis is that everybody is
pulling together."</TE>
<TE>   As chief executive, O'Connor moved the agency's headquarters from
Philadelphia to New York City and, according to Advertising Age,
paved the way for Ayer's overseas expansion.</TE>
<TE>   "Several important clients wanted us in New York," O'Connor wrote
in Advertising Age in 1994. "Prospective clients were sometimes
turned off by our not being there. And the TV age demanded closer
touch with the networks, which all were Manhattan based."</TE>
<TE>   Howard Davis, a former corporate Ayer communications director,
recalled of O'Connor: "He just energized [the agency]. He was young
and aggressive and eager and intelligent and got a lot done. The
agency started doing better almost immediately in his decade as CEO
and more than overcame the losses of the previous decade."</TE>
<TE>   O'Connor also brought Ayer into the American Assn. of Advertising
Agencies, the trade group known as the Four A's, which he served as
chairman in 1975-76.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, Davis said, "Mr. Ayer and the successors all the way
to O'Connor had said, 'We don't need anybody telling us what to do.'"</TE>
<TE>   Joining the Four A's, he said, "brought the agency into the main
body of American advertising."</TE>
<TE>   O'Connor stepped down as Ayer's chairman and chief executive in
1976 and became chairman of the agency's executive committee. He
retired in 1981 .</TE>
<TE>   Born in Milwaukee, O'Connor served with the 350th Infantry
Regiment, antitank unit, 88th "Blue Devil" Division, of the 5th Army
in Italy during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   He graduated from Syracuse University with a degree in business
administration in 1949, the year he joined Ayer.</TE>
<TE>   A military buff, O'Connor established the nonprofit Foundation for
Aviation World War I after retiring and wrote seven books devoted to
aviation during that war.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Nancy, of Princeton; sons, Robert of
Santa Fe, N.M., Thomas of Boston and David of Los Angeles; and three
grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Neal W. O'Connor
Memorial Fund, c/o Project ALS, 511 Avenue of the Americas, PMB No.
341, New York, NY 10011.</TE>

<HD>Pierre Bourdieu, 71; Sociologist and Philosopher</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pierre Bourdieu, an internationally renowned French sociologist and
philosopher who ventured outside the academic world to join protest
movements, has died of cancer in Paris, his publisher said. He was
71.</LD>
<LD>   Bourdieu, whose works dealt with subjects ranging from the 1960s
social upheavals in France to the influence of television and the
media, died Wednesday at a hospital in Paris, the Seuil publishing
house said.</LD>
<LD>   Much of his work was concerned with the nature of social status,
or "symbolic capital."</LD>
<TE>   Later in life, Bourdieu was involved in the struggle against
social injustice, supporting striking rail workers, students and the
homeless. He also joined anti-globalization protests and once called
sociology "a combat sport."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the nation's top politicians paid tribute to Bourdieu,
whose death was front-page news in the newspaper Le Monde. Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin described Bourdieu as "a master of
contemporary sociology and a great figure in the intellectual life of
our country."</TE>
<TE>   Bourdieu held a pessimistic view of social mobility, believing
that most people enter adulthood with the social and economic
limitations that determine their ultimate rank in life.</TE>
<TE>   "The point of my work is to show that culture and education aren't
simply hobbies or minor influences," he told the New York Times
recently. "They are hugely important in the affirmation of
differences between groups and social classes and in the reproduction
of those differences."</TE>
<TE>   He tested his ideas through field studies and wrote about 30 books
over a 40-year career.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Bove, the French farmer-turned-activist who ransacked a
McDonald's restaurant in a 1999 anti-globalization protest, told
France-Inter radio that Bourdieu "was an active sociologist ... who
shed light on the reality of our society."</TE>
<TE>   Although Bourdieu would later argue that education was an
instrument of privilege, his own early experience proved to the
contrary. Born in 1930 in the Bearn region of southwest France, he
was the son of an itinerant sharecropper turned postman who did not
complete high school. An exceptional student, Bourdieu won admission
to the elite Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris, which produced many
French intellectuals. He lived for many years in Algeria, where he
studied traditional farming and ethnic Berber culture.</TE>
<TE>   His major works included "Distinction: A Social Critique of the
Judgment of Taste," published in France in 1979 and in the United
States in 1984. It was named one of the 20th century's 10 most
important works of sociology by the International Sociological Assn.
Other works touched on literature, politics, poverty and gender
inequality. In "On Television," he called TV a "symbolic instrument
of oppression."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1981, he had held the chair of sociology at the prestigious
College de France.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife and three children.</TE>

<LD>Police arrested a Costa Mesa man early Saturday on suspicion of
setting a series of fires at a local high school.</LD>
<LD>   Peter Dale Garrett, 42, was arrested on suspicion of arson and is
being held at Orange County Jail in lieu of $50,000 bail.</LD>
<LD>   "Stuff like this isn't always limited to juveniles," said Lt. Les
Gogerty, a Costa Mesa Police Department spokesman. "It's not uncommon
to have adults do this kind of thing."</LD>
<TE>   Garrett was arrested about 4:30 a.m. after investigators saw him
standing next to a portable toilet at Costa Mesa High School in the
2600 block of Fairview Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   As they watched, Gogerty said, the toilet burst into flames and
Garrett tried to run away carrying a gas can.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze, which caused an estimated $1,000 damage, was quickly
extinguished.</TE>
<TE>   Arson investigators had begun a 24-hour surveillance of the campus
after a suspicious blaze gutted a classroom for hearing-impaired
students late Thursday. The fire was the third such incident this
month, investigators said, with two previous fires damaging portable
toilets on the football field.</TE>
<TE>   The damage caused by the series of fires, they said, was estimated
at $85,000.</TE>

<HD>Her Latest Creation: a Union</HD>
<DH>Labor: Fullerton College art instructor persuades
colleagues to organize and finds a new calling.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>College art instructor Linda Cushing was just another weary
part-timer cobbling together a class on this campus and that.</LD>
<LD>   Then she spotted another teacher grading papers in Fullerton
College's faculty lounge, a veteran part-timer who, like herself, was
juggling a student load for little pay and no guarantee of a job next
semester.</LD>
<LD>   "When he looked up at me, the mask came off," Cushing said of that
fall day in 1998. "There was such despair and isolation and anger in
his face. I thought, if I'm going to become this, I can't continue
teaching.</LD>
<TE>   "I saw the face of my future if I chose to accept it, and I
didn't."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Cushing pushed and prodded part-time teachers at the
North Orange County Community College District to unionize. Then as
president of the new union, she won them a three-year contract last
September that guaranteed a 13.5% raise.</TE>
<TE>   "If she hadn't been there, I don't think the union would have
gotten started here," said philosophy instructor Sam Russo,
co-president of Adjunct Faculty United at Fullerton College. "She
just refused to give up."</TE>
<TE>   Cushing's success at Fullerton and its sister campuses so
impressed the American Federation of Teachers that it hired her as
one of 39 national organizers. Her job is to concentrate on community
college instructors--full and part time. So far, she has helped
organize unions at Citrus College in Glendora and Palomar College in
San Diego County, and is campaigning to organize the faculty at
Cerritos College in Norwalk, the Kern College District, Victor Valley
Community College and the College of the Canyons.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not often an ordinary person can do things that affect
people's lives," Cushing said.</TE>
<TE>   About 17,000 full-time instructors teach at California's 108
community colleges. Another 37,000 part-timers help carry the course
load. Some teach only an occasional class; others try to make a
living at it while searching for a permanent faculty position.</TE>
<TE>   Part-timers are paid 40% to 50% less than full-time instructors
with comparable experience and education, the California
Postsecondary Education Commission said in a report last April.</TE>
<TE>   Full-time faculty teach 63% of classes, well below the state's
goal of 75%, said Chancellor Tom Nussbaum, who heads the California
community college system. The problem, Nussbaum said, is that
California community colleges receive $2,300 per student less than
the national average.</TE>
<TE>   "To keep our doors open with low funding levels, one strategy has
been to use part-time instructors," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the state set aside $57 million to increase
part-timers' pay. But the chancellor said $175 million to $200
million is needed.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a long-simmering problem that had not been dealt
with, and it reached a boiling point," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Lightman, who heads the Faculty Assn. of the California
Community Colleges in Sacramento, said: "I can't emphasize enough how
exploited and displaced part-time faculty feel."</TE>
<TE>   Into that atmosphere stepped Cushing. She earned a bachelor's
degree in communications from Pepperdine, where she headed the campus
Young Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   After graduation, she worked as a probation officer, managed a
posh athletic club, then launched a graphic design studio in
Fullerton. When the early '90s recession hit, she declared
bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Cushing used the extra time to take a drawing class at Fullerton
and fell in love with art. "It became my salvation," she said. "It
helped me deal with things."</TE>
<TE>   She continued her studies until she had received two master's
degrees in drawing and painting from Cal State Fullerton. She also
decided she wanted to be a college professor. She searched for a
full-time job and taught wherever she could, mainly at Fullerton,
Cypress and Santa Ana colleges.</TE>
<TE>   Cushing loved the work, and thought the $35 an hour she was making
was pretty good. But when she added up time spent preparing lessons
and grading papers, she realized she was making little more than
minimum wage.</TE>
<TE>   Seeing her colleague so despairing was her call to action. Someone
told her about an Internet discussion group for part-time instructors
around the state. Via e-mail, she found people in the same situation.</TE>
<TE>   Cushing had a dim view of unions. She had fought a restaurant
workers' union when she was running the San Francisco Tennis Club.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw the unions as protecting the jobs of people who didn't have
what it took to keep their jobs on their own," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But the lack of respect she felt made her reevaluate her views. "I
finally felt what it was like to need something else, and that
something else was the union," she said. Also trolling the Internet
was John Berg, a national organizer for the American Federation of
Teachers. The two met in October 1998. With the help of Berg and a
core group of other instructors, they launched a campaign for union
representation of North Orange County part-time faculty.</TE>
<TE>   "The key to organizing any group of employees is solid leadership
at the top end of the local group," Berg said. "Linda was a very
solid leader. She does it seven days a week. This lady doesn't take a
break."</TE>
<TE>   Organizing is a difficult business at best. It's even harder if
you're trying to reach adjunct instructors who don't have offices or
much interaction. Some work at night, others during the day. They
don't gather in any one place. Cushing and her group of activists
waited outside classrooms at Fullerton and Cypress colleges and the
School of Continuing Education, which make up the district,
persuading part-time instructors to sign up.</TE>
<TE>   Cushing encountered other obstacles. She said a department head
and a dean warned her to back off, intimating she might not be
retained if she continued organizing. A full-time teacher told her
she might be blackballed, she said.</TE>
<TE>   For close to a week, Cushing pulled back. "I don't have a death
wish," she said. "I wasn't trying to shoot myself in the foot."</TE>
<TE>   But phone calls from fellow organizers persuaded her to return.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the rival California Teachers Assn., which
represents North Orange County's full-time faculty, began its own
campaign to organize the part-timers--even though that chapter
previously had balked at including them.</TE>
<TE>   The same pattern has followed at several colleges, Cushing and
others said. Her union would start organizing part-time faculty at a
campus, often after the CTA full-timers chapter had rejected them.
Then CTA would step in.</TE>
<TE>   "We do recognize that at each college people might want to have a
choice," said Dian Hason,president of the CTA's Community College
Assn. "That's a democratic process to see which union would best
represent the people," Hason said.</TE>
<TE>   At Fullerton, Cushing's efforts paid off when part-time faculty
voted to have her union represent them. Next came talks with district
administrators in June 2000. A contract was signed in September 2001,
giving part-timers an immediate 13.5% raise, $100 a month toward
medical benefits, a promise to renegotiate salary in two years and
seniority rights when it came to class assignments.</TE>
<TE>   "She has taken a vision for part-time faculty and translated it
into action," Lightman said. "I think she has set a standard for
organizing."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Cushing said, the part-timers in North Orange County are
nowhere near parity. "What we got in North Orange County was better
than we got in most districts," she said. "It's a start."</TE>
<TE>   With negotiations complete, Cushing asked the AFT to hire her.
Cushing, who taught her last class, Introduction to Art at Cypress,
in May 2001, misses teaching. But besides helping others, her new job
has one more advantage.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the first-time I've had a full-time job in a long time," she
says.</TE>

<HD>Sewage Issue Gets Murky</HD>
<DH>Environment: Accuracy of monitor that showed acceptable
outflow from Huntington treatment plant questioned. New device may be
required.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY and SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orange County Sanitation District removed a pollution monitoring
device after a state inspector said it was generating questionable
readings, making him suspect that sewage flowing into the ocean
exceeded legal limits for water clarity, documents and interviews
show.</LD>
<LD>   The device, installed voluntarily in 1996, was pulled out of a
Huntington Beach treatment plant in October, shortly after a meeting
with the water-quality inspector, who raised questions about
miscalibrations and apparent false readings, his reports show.</LD>
<LD>   The device, a turbidity analyzer, is not required. But it has
become a popular round-the-clock monitoring tool at public and
private sewer plants across the nation because it can signal trouble
in the treatment process.</LD>
<TE>   The Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board, the area's
primary enforcer of federal and state discharge permits, is exploring
whether to require the Orange County agency to reinstall such a
monitor.</TE>
<TE>   Sanitation officials oppose this, arguing that the daily
laboratory samples they take under current regulations are enough to
ensure that the partially treated sewage meets clean-water standards.</TE>
<TE>   Because those samples show no violations, they said, another level
of monitoring is unnecessary. In any case, they said the system never
worked properly and was never relied upon for official readings.</TE>
<TE>   "It was something that was in place, like a clock on the wall. You
look at it when you want to know the time, and when you don't, you
don't look at it," said Lisa Murphy, spokeswoman for the agency,
which serves more than 2 million households and businesses in north
and central Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something we put in place originally thinking we could use
it.... And it was not being used," Murphy said. "So there's really no
magical explanation as to why it stayed there unused."</TE>
<TE>   Questions about the monitor emerge as the sanitation district
seeks to extend a federal permit allowing it to discharge 243 million
gallons a day of partially treated waste water 4 1/2 miles off
Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The district is the largest of 36 public agencies in the
country--and one of four remaining in California--with a waiver to
the 1972 Clean Water Act, which mandates that sewage released into
waterways receive rigorous treatment to kill most bacteria, viruses
and other disease-causing organisms.</TE>
<TE>   The monitor was intended to measure turbidity--cloudiness in the
water--which is one of more than 120 variables the sanitation
district must track under restrictions established by California's
Ocean Plan and federal law.</TE>
<TE>   Turbidity violations could cost up to $11,000 a day, depending on
the severity and duration. They also could jeopardize renewal of the
waiver. To date, the district has not been cited.</TE>
<TE>   Turbid water blocks out light, decreasing vegetation, which
provides food and shelter to marine life.</TE>
<TE>   "As it reduces light, it decreases photosynthesis," said Clint
Winant, a professor of oceanography at the Scripps Institute of
Oceanography. "Generally, you would decrease the productivity of
waters."</TE>
<TE>   While turbidity itself doesn't affect human health, experts said
its presence can indicate more significant problems elsewhere in the
treatment flow, including concentrations of bacteria-laden solid
waste.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of turbidity analyzers say they provide quicker
feedback than lab samples. In California, they have been approved for
use at some public and private treatment plants that discharge into
streams and rivers that are more sensitive to, and less able to
dilute, highly turbid waste water.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, sanitation district officials told the inspector the
$5,400 monitor was used for a short-term research project after the
agency recorded an over-the-limit turbidity reading in 1994. When
asked for findings of the research project, officials told The Times
the system actually was installed in 1996 as part of an upgrade to
the Huntington Beach sampling station. They said it was never used
for research and was abandoned after tests showed turbidity readings
that did not correspond with lab samples.</TE>
<TE>   A series of water board inspection reports reviewed by The Times
shows that water regulators got involved in January 2001, when
inspector Julio Lara noticed a pinkish tint to waste water at the
sampling station, along with high turbidity readings.</TE>
<TE>   After visiting the plant several times over the next 10 months, he
discovered the system's calibration scales were set at levels lower
than the legal limits. Sometimes, he noted, the meter would flat-line
at the top of that preset limit for hours.</TE>
<TE>   "The turbidity trend resembled a horizontal line with occasional
downward peaks," Lara wrote in one of his reports. "These findings
may indicate that [the sanitation district] may be exceeding effluent
turbidity limitations."</TE>
<TE>   However, the agency's own reports, based on daily laboratory
samples, showed no violations during the same period, Lara noted.</TE>
<TE>   During the course of his inquiry, Lara said he was assured that
technicians were trying to correct the problem. He also reported that
a work order was issued to repair, clean and recalibrate the system
in February 2001, and that the technician assigned the task told him
in September 2001 that the equipment "normally worked without problem
and that the instrument's output turbidity signal was accurate to the
best of his knowledge."</TE>
<TE>   The system was removed shortly after sanitation officials met
privately with Lara on Oct. 16 to discuss his findings and his
recommendation that the monitor be fixed and incorporated by the
agency as a permanent, mandatory measurement tool.</TE>
<TE>   During that meeting, sanitation officials argued strongly against
Lara's proposed new requirements. They characterized the use of the
analyzer as "merely an unsuccessful experiment," saying that it was
"abandoned and inexplicably ... left operating and generating and
storing data. "</TE>
<TE>   Lara, who apparently was dissatisfied with that answer, wrote a
report after the meeting in which he said he was studying the issue
and may urge the water board to require the sanitation district to
install a permanent turbidity analyzer.</TE>
<TE>   The inquiry might seem a relatively minor matter, but for the
waiver issue. Environmentalists want the district to treat the waste
water it pipes offshore to the same standard required of the vast
majority of the nation's 16,000 sanitation agencies.</TE>
<TE>   But district officials estimate it would cost an additional $400
million or more annually if they lose the waiver, which expires next
year. They maintain that the discharged sewage, known as a plume,
does not harm the environment or public health.</TE>
<TE>   However, environmentalists and other critics have long derided the
agency's monitoring practices as self-serving. They note that
sanitation officials, after saying consistently that the plume never
comes closer than a mile off the coast, revealed last year that their
own data show it regularly coming within a half mile of Newport Beach
since 1987. Some scientists have theorized the plume may have
contributed to the closure of large stretches of the Huntington Beach
shoreline in the summer of 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the waiver hope they can persuade a majority of the
25-member sanitation district board to abandon any pursuit of a new
five-year waiver.</TE>

<LD>Arkansas Pine Bluff can blame JaJa Bey for its misery.</LD>
<LD>   Bey's 20 points led Long Island to an 80-64 victory against St.
Francis (Pa.). It was Long Island's first this season after 16
losses.</LD>
<LD>   That leaves Arkansas Pine Bluff--an 84-72 loser to Grambling State
on Saturday--as the only one of 324 Division I teams still winless.</LD>
<TE>   The Golden Lions have lost their first 18 in 2001-02 and 24
consecutive overall. Last season they were 3-25.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this season, Pine Bluff lost to Gonzaga by 50 points and
to Marquette by 51.</TE>
<TE>   The closest they've come to winning is a 66-61 loss to Southern.
The rematch is Feb. 9, but it's on the road.</TE>
<TE>   So it reasons that the chance for a "perfect" season is real ...
no bluffing.</TE>

<HD>This Final Is a Swede 16 Party</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Johansson beats Safin in four sets and becomes
lowest-seeded man to win Australian Open in the Open era.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MELBOURNE, Australia</DL>
<LD>"We are yellow. We are blue. We are Swedish. Who are you?"</LD>
<LD>   We can think of a better question for the loud legions of singing
and chanting yellow-and-blue-faced Swedes at Melbourne Park:</LD>
<LD>   Who is Thomas Johansson?</LD>
<TE>   It is far easier to describe how he won the Australian Open today
against Marat Safin of Russia than to answer the aforementioned
question. This surprising successor to the likes of Mats Wilander and
Stefan Edberg declared earlier in the tournament, "Look at me, I'm
not interesting," almost making the monotoned Thomas Enqvist seem a
little less dull by comparison.</TE>
<TE>   Enqvist couldn't quite conquer his nerves after winning the first
set against Yevgeny Kafelnikov in the final here three years ago,
losing in four. Tightness got to Johansson, too, creeping into his
game in the fourth set.</TE>
<TE>   Doubting Thomas?</TE>
<TE>   Safin had something to do with it, of course. He seemed flat in
the second and third sets, and part of the fourth, looking
flat-footed and unwilling to hit out on his backhand side until
falling behind a service break in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   But the final Safin surge was not enough as he ultimately ran out
of comebacks. The 16th-seeded Johansson won his first Grand Slam
title, defeating No. 9 Safin, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4, 7-6 (4), in 2 hours 53
minutes. He won it on his fourth match point, retrieving a drop shot
and then watching Safin's lob float long.</TE>
<TE>   Johansson showed impressive versatility. He hit 16 aces, had four
double faults and was three for 14 on break-point opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Johansson, 26, became the first Swedish player to win the
Australian Open since Wilander in 1988 and is the lowest-seeded
player to win this tournament in the Open era. Mark Edmondson, who
was unseeded, won in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   Safin, who turned 22 today, was trying to add a second Grand Slam
title to his resume, which already includes the 2000 U.S. Open. But
he looked as if he was running on fumes after a strong first set. In
the semifinals, Safin, helped by a well-timed rain delay, came back
from a two-sets-to-one deficit against Tommy Haas of Germany, winning
11 of the last 13 games.</TE>
<TE>   "He played too good today," Safin said of Johansson. "I couldn't
do anything as you can see. I tried my best, but I couldn't."</TE>
<TE>   Safin showed some humor and charm as he turned to Johansson during
the award ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a very important thing, enjoy it as much as you can," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Johansson was gracious in victory. "He [Safin] played some great
tennis today," he said. "I was really lucky to win today."</TE>
<TE>   He wished Safin happy birthday.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm almost over the hill," Johansson said. "He's 22. I'm [almost]
27. I feel very old."</TE>
<TE>   Johansson hardly looked it. He had a grueling five-set semifinal
against Jiri Novak of the Czech Republic but that match was played
the night before the Safin-Hass match.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the threat of rain today, the roof of Rod Laver Arena
was partially closed and the lights were on. Though the day was not
especially hot, Safin looked weary from his semifinal. What brought
him back to contend in the fourth was a momentary serving lapse by
Johansson in the fourth game. Safin broke him when he started missing
his first serve.</TE>
<TE>   They stayed on serve, holding with relative ease until the
tiebreaker. Johansson took a 5-0 lead. Safin was distraught, talking
to himself after missing a shot, and tumbled to the ground as a
cross-court passing shot sailed past.</TE>
<TE>   Safin fought off three match points. On the first, as he stood to
serve, trailing, 1-6, a fan called out, heckling him: "Happy
birthday!" It stopped Safin for a minute but he saved the first match
point by ripping a forehand winner. On the second, Safin hit a
service winner and Johansson looked tense on the third, knocking a
backhand wide.</TE>
<TE>   The moment of victory was delayed briefly until Safin's lob
drifted out. The Swede, typically, stayed within himself, pumping a
fist and blowing a kiss to his entourage.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, he had some nervous moments getting to the
tournament. "My coach forgot to call the car," he said. "We had to
take a taxi."</TE>
<TE>   It was sort of a metaphor for his career. Johansson may have been
late to Grand Slam success. But on a surprising day at the surprising
2002 Australian Open ... he eventually got there.</TE>

<HD>Mosley Tastes First Pro Loss</HD>
<DH>Boxing: Forrest knocks him down twice in second round en
route to dominating, unanimous victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Shane Mosley had never felt the pain of defeat, never known the
mind-numbing sensation of being knocked down, never experienced the
warmth of his own blood running down his face in the ring.</LD>
<LD>   But Saturday night, he felt all that and more as Vernon Forrest
pulled off a stunning upset by winning a unanimous, overwhelming
decision over the man generally considered the best pound-for-pound
fighter in the world.</LD>
<LD>   From the second round on, Mosley wasn't even the best fighter in
the ring at the Theater at Madison Square Garden as Forrest knocked
him down twice, battered him from ring post to ring post and blasted
away at his body in front of a shocked crowd of 5,323.</LD>
<TE>   "If he is the best boxer in the world," Forrest said, "the Michael
Jordan of basketball, and I beat him, does that make me the Michael
Jordan of basketball?"</TE>
<TE>   It certainly makes Forrest (34-0, 26 knockouts) the World Boxing
Council welterweight champion, the title Mosley (38-1, 35) had won
from Oscar De La Hoya in June of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Tom Kazmarek scored the fight 115-110, Melvina Lathan had it
117-108 and Julie Lederman scored it 118-108.</TE>
<TE>   The Times had Forrest winning 116-110.</TE>
<TE>   "He was holding a lot," Mosley said. " I think it was a closer
fight."</TE>
<TE>   The oddsmakers didn't think it was going to be a close fight. They
had made Mosley a 51/2-1 favorite, the kind of odds usually reserved
for mismatches.</TE>
<TE>   They obviously didn't take into account what happened a decade
ago. In 1992, Mosley and Forrest met in the light-welterweight
semifinals of the 1992 U.S. Olympic trials. Forrest won.</TE>
<TE>   Ten years obviously didn't make a difference.</TE>
<TE>   The oldest cliche in boxing is that styles make fights. But it's
also the truest. Mosley may have risen to the top of the boxing world
because of his blazing speed and devastating punching power, but he
couldn't handle Forrest's right hand or overall strength any more
than he could in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very ironic that I lost to the same man who beat me the last
time I lost," Mosley said</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe it was just the head butt.</TE>
<TE>   Mosley won the first round in the manner everyone had expected,
his speed and footwork being the difference.</TE>
<TE>   In the second round, the two fighters banged heads.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't intentional," Forrest said. "We both threw our right
hands at the same time and our heads clashed."</TE>
<TE>   Forrest grabbed his forehead, apparently injured worse than
Mosley.</TE>
<TE>   But Mosley had suffered a narrow cut above his left eyebrow and
blood began rolling down his face.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt myself get dazed like a hard punch," he later admitted.
"It affected me a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   More than a little bit.</TE>
<TE>   Mosley quickly went down from a right hand.</TE>
<TE>   "I was still dazed," Mosley said. "He hit me. I was like, 'Wow, he
hit me? I'm going down.' My legs were rubbery."</TE>
<TE>   Mosley staggered to his feet, stumbled all over the ring, tried to
hold on to Forrest, but went down a second time in the closing
seconds of the round from another right hand.</TE>
<TE>   Somehow Mosley managed to get to his feet as the bell sounded
ending the round.</TE>
<TE>   Mosley spent the rest of the evening trying to recover but he was
never the same. Those speedy legs were shaky. Those quick reflexes
were dulled. The vast array of punches were off the mark.</TE>
<TE>   But he never wavered, even when Forrest trapped him on the ropes
and pounded away at his body.</TE>
<TE>   "That really hurt," Mosley said. "My will and pride would not let
go me go down. It was the hardest I've ever been hit in my career."</TE>
<TE>   When it was over, Forrest, who promised Mosley a rematch, did his
best Muhammad Ali impersonation, hanging over the ropes, pointing at
press row and yelling, "I told you so. I told you so."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the semi-main event, Arturo Gatti (34-5, 28) stopped Terronn
Millet (26-3-1, 19) at 2:23 of the fourth round of a scheduled
10-round junior welterweight match.</TE>

<LD>The recent illness of the great Ted Williams brings to mind the day
in April 1936 when he first burst on the Southern California baseball
scene. The Pomona 20-30 Club tournament was the unofficial SoCal
championship in those days and Williams' San Diego Hoover High School
team won the consolation championship.</LD>
<LD>   On the final day, doubleheaders were played. In the morning,
Williams hit two home runs in the same inning as Hoover drubbed South
Pasadena, 13-1. There were no outfield fences and the diamonds were
back-to-back.</LD>
<LD>   One of his homers rolled all the way to the pitcher's mound on the
other field, more than 500 feet.</LD>
<TE>   In the afternoon, he pitched a 7-0 shutout, hitting another home
run off Bob Merriam, who was named all-tournament pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   Indicative of the 20-30's prestige is the fact that then-Gov.
Frank Merriam (no relation) threw out the first pitch. Also in the
tournament was a leadoff-hitting catcher from Muir Tech, Jackie
Robinson, and a pair of future major league all-star infielders, Vern
Stephens of Long Beach Wilson and Bob Dillinger of Glendale.</TE>

<TE>   Trivia time: Williams was the last player to hit over .400 in the
major leagues with a .406 average in 1941. Since then, who has been
closest to .400?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What's in a name: Among imprisoned financier Robert E. Brennan's
assets is a $40-million golf course, built on his 221-acre estate in
New Jersey. The course is up for bid in bankruptcy court.</TE>
<TE>   Its name: Due Process Golf Course.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Choices, choices: Jacksonville sports-radio host Joe Cowart had
this to say about the Jaguars giving Coach Tom Coughlin a contract
extension when Steve Spurrier was available:</TE>
<TE>   "There is complete and total outrage here.</TE>
<TE>   "Wayne Weaver sticking with Coughlin instead of courting Spurrier
is like dating Aunt Bee and blowing off Penelope Cruz."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nepotism? Ed Carpenter, USAC sprint car rookie of the year,
announced he will drive this year in the new Indy Racing Infiniti Pro
Series for Swinden Racing.</TE>
<TE>   Carpenter's stepfather is Tony George, founder of the Indy Racing
League and the Infiniti support series.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fair enough: Outfielder Roger Cedeno did not play the final 19
games of the season for the Detroit Tigers. Manager Phil Garner told
the Detroit News' Joe Falls why.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd been off for five days because of 9/11 and were having a
light workout," said Garner.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked the guys to run the bases so they could get the feel of
it. I didn't care how fast they went.</TE>
<TE>   "Cedeno said he didn't have to do it, and he said, 'We don't even
have to play any more games.' I couldn't believe that.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, if that's your attitude ... then you don't play any more
games."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Tony Gwynn of the San Diego Padres, who hit .394 in
1994.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Ty Tryon is only a junior in high school but has an
11-member entourage while he plays on the PGA Tour.</TE>
<TE>   Dean Acosta of the Arizona Republic followed Tryon during the
Phoenix Open and counted two swing coaches, a trainer, a yoga
instructor, a tutor (by phone), an image consultant, a caddie, a
sports psychologist, an agent and two massage therapists.</TE>

<LD>Texas Tech doesn't look anything like last season's team that
finished 9-19 overall and tied for last in the Big 12 Conference at
3-13.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday at Lubbock, Texas, the Red Raiders didn't look
anything like the team that was blown out by Oklahoma in Norman two
weeks ago.</LD>
<LD>   Andre Emmett had 26 points and 10 rebounds to lead Texas Tech to a
92-79 victory over sixth-ranked Oklahoma--its second win in eight
days over a top 10 team. The Red Raiders beat then-No. 6 Oklahoma
State, 98-72, in its previous game on Jan. 19.</LD>
<TE>   Texas Tech, 15-3 overall and 4-2 in the Big 12, repeatedly took
the ball inside against Oklahoma (15-3, 4-2)--outscoring the Sooners
in the paint by 12 points.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma, the conference leader in scoring defense (62.2) before
Saturday's game, gave up more than 90 points for the first time this
season. The Sooners defeated Texas Tech, 98-72, on Jan. 12.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought our kids did a really good job coming back off of
having been beaten as badly up there as we were," Texas Tech Coach
Bob Knight said. Texas Tech led, 40-37, at halftime after trailing by
22 points at the break in the first game with Oklahoma. The Red
Raiders shot 65.5% (19 for 25) in the second half and led by as many
as 16 points.</TE>
<TE>   "In the second half we couldn't get them stopped," Oklahoma Coach
Kelvin Sampson said. "We didn't score any baskets in transition
because we were taking the ball out of the net and walking it up the
court. We played uphill all night, and it seemed like they played
downhill."</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma got 27 points from Hollis Price and 19 from Aaron McGhee,
but its other players scored only 33 points and shot 37.5% (12 for
32).</TE>
<TE>   Texas Tech finished with 56.7% shooting (34 for 60), five
double-figure scorers and 25 assists.</TE>
<TE>   "It was important to get this one because it showed everyone we
can play with a good team, and we're capable of beating anybody,"
said forward Kasib Powell, referring to those who thought Oklahoma
State simply had an off-game on Jan. 19.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 2 Kansas 86, Texas A&amp;M 74--Drew Gooden had 22 points and 13
rebounds--his 15th double-double of the season--for the Jayhawks
(17-2, 6-0 in the Big 12) at College Station, Texas. Bernard King had
22 points for Texas A&amp;M (8-12, 2-4).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 3 Maryland 84, Florida State 63--At College Park, Md., Juan
Dixon had 25 points, 11 rebounds and eight steals for the Terrapins
(16-3, 6-1 in the Atlantic CoastConference). Maryland has won 13 in a
row at home since losing, 74-71, to Florida State last February. All
four of the ACC losses for Florida State (10-8, 3-4) have come on the
road.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 4 Cincinnati 78, South Florida 68--Steve Logan scored 27
points and the Bearcats (19-1, 7-0 in Conference USA) made 17 of 19
free throws over the final six minutes at Tampa, Fla., to extend the
nation's longest winning streak to 19. Will McDonald, a junior center
averaging 10.7 points, scored a career-high 28 for South Florida
(13-6, 4-3).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas 94, No. 5 Florida 92-- Jannero Pargo had a career-high 35
points, including a three-point basket to send the game into overtime
and the decisive basket with 2.7 seconds left in the extra period at
Fayetteville, Ark., as the Razorbacks (11-8, 3-4 in the Southeastern
Conference) handed the Gators (15-3, 4-2) their second consecutive
loss. Pargo, a senior guard averaging a team-high 16.2 points, made
seven of eight three-point shots. Brett Nelson had 23 points for
Florida.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 14 Alabama 64, No. 8 Kentucky 61--At Lexington, Ky., the
Crimson Tide (17-3, 5-1 in the SEC) had four double-figure scorers,
led by Erwin Dudley's 16 points, and took advantage of 39% shooting
by the Wildcats (13-5, 3-3). Kentucky's leading scorers, Tayshaun
Prince and Keith Bogans, combined for 19 points and seven-for-25
shooting.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Indiana 88, No. 9 Illinois 57--The Hoosiers (13-6, 6-1 in the Big
Ten) made a school-record 17 three-point shots in 27 attempts at
Bloomington, Ind., in handing the Illini (15-5, 4-3) its worst loss
in more than 10 years. Dane Fife made six of seven three-point shots
and had a game-high 20 points for Indiana, which moved into a tie for
first place in the Big Ten with No. 20 Ohio State. Frank Williams (11
points) was the only Illinois player to score in double figures.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 11 Oklahoma State 64, Colorado 55--Maurice Baker scored eight
of his 16 points in an early second-half run that lifted the Cowboys
(17-3, 4-3 in the Big 12) to an emotional victory over the Buffaloes
(11-6, 2-4) at Stillwater, Okla. The game included a moment of
silence at halftime to honor the 10 people, including two players,
who died in a plane crash Jan. 27, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 12 Syracuse 81, Virginia Tech 69--DeShaun Williams, a junior
guard, scored a career-high 28 points at Syracuse, N.Y., as the
Orangemen (17-4, 6-1 in the Big East) won for the first time in three
games. Virginia Tech (6-13, 0-7) shot 33% in losing its 16th Big East
game in a row.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Vanderbilt 86, No. 15 Georgia 84--Jason Holwerda scored on a
runner with 4.9 seconds left to give the Commodores (13-6, 3-3 in the
SEC) the victory at Nashville. Vanderbilt made 15 of 31 three-point
shots, with sophomore guard Brendan Plavich connecting on six of nine
from behind the arc en route to a career-high 22 points. Chris
Daniels missed a three-point shot at the buzzer for Georgia (16-4,
5-2).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 16 Gonzaga 70, Saint Mary's 52--The Bulldogs (18-3, 5-1 in the
West Coast Conference) scored the game's first 12 points at Spokane,
Wash., and were never threatened en route to their 23rd consecutive
home victory. Saint Mary's (5-14, 0-6) scored only 17 first-half
points in losing its eighth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 18 Missouri 86, Kansas State 74--Kareem Rush had 22 points at
Columbia, Mo., as the Tigers (15-5, 5-2 in the Big 12 defeated the
Wildcats (7-10, 1-5) for the 18th consecutive time at home. Kansas
State's Pervis Pasco had 11 points and 11 rebounds--his seventh
double-double in 11 games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 89, No. 20 Ohio State 71--The Golden Gophers (11-7, 4-3
in the Big Ten) made nine of 14 three-point shots at Minneapolis in
ending a conference winning streak at 14 for the Buckeyes (15-3,
6-1). Ohio State was seventh in the nation in scoring defense
entering the game (58.0) but allowed its highest point total this
season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 21 Wake Forest 87, Georgia Tech 74--Josh Howard had 20 points

N.C. Tony Akins had 20 points for Georgia Tech (7-13, 0-7).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 24 Texas 69, Baylor 63-- The victory at Waco, Texas, was the

<HD>Hot Mavericks Too Much for Clippers, Scoreboard</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Dallas turns on the jets and runs away with
a 133-112 victory that ends L.A.'s home winning streak.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dallas Mavericks fly so far under the average NBA fan's radar
that about all anyone seems to know about them is that their owner
often acts like a juvenile delinquent.</LD>
<LD>   What a pity.</LD>
<LD>   Mark Cuban's headline-grabbing antics notwithstanding, he has
built a team that is every bit as entertaining as it is difficult to
beat. Ask the Clippers, who made 14 of 18 shots (77.8%) in the third
quarter, and were still thumped Saturday by the Mavericks, 133-112,
before a disbelieving sellout crowd of 19,311 at Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   Dallas used a late 20-0 run to win its seventh in a row and 12th
consecutive over the Clippers. The Mavericks also ended the Clippers'
home winning streak at five and sent them out on the road for a
season-high seven-game trip with an empty feeling.</TE>
<TE>   What more could the Clippers have done?</TE>
<TE>   Well, they could have played something resembling NBA-caliber
defense.</TE>
<TE>   But the Mavericks had something to do with it, making 49 of 85
shots (57.6%). Four players scored 20 points or more for Dallas, led
by Dirk Nowitzki's 28.</TE>
<TE>   The Mavericks' total of 133 points was the most the Clippers have
given up this season.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought we were in the old ABA," Dallas Coach Don Nelson said,
referring to the late, great American Basketball Assn., which thrived
on dunking and three-point shooting. "This was a fun game. What a
shootout. ...</TE>
<TE>   "This is just an incredible team. They are really fun to coach. I
don't even want a day off the way we are playing.</TE>
<TE>   "The coach has no complaints about anything."</TE>
<TE>   Quentin Richardson led the Clippers with a career-best 31 points,
including a franchise-record tying seven three-point baskets. The
Clippers shot 51.2% and made 14 three-pointers, tying another club
mark.</TE>
<TE>   Cuban enjoyed it all from a courtside seat, quiet as a mouse.</TE>
<TE>   For once, the focus was all on the Mavericks on the court.</TE>
<TE>   "What can you say?" Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry said with a chuckle
at game's end. "I wasn't discouraged by the way we played. I was
discouraged by the way they played. What do you do with Nowitzki? We
tried everything we could think of. We gave a great effort,
especially in the third quarter. Everything we tried, they had an
answer for, starting with Nowitzki."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers erased a 12-point halftime deficit by late in the
third quarter, surging into a 95-94 lead after one of Richardson's
three-pointers inside the final minute. But Nowitzki countered with a
jump shot and a free throw after he was fouled for a 97-95 lead with
32.1 seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   "They are definitely one of the top teams in the league, and they
don't even have Michael Finley," Richardson said, referring to the
Maverick guard, who is on the injured list because of a strained left
hamstring.</TE>
<TE>   Like everyone else at Staples Center, Richardson marveled at
Nowitzki.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a great player," Richardson said. "He's come a long way.
He's 7 feet tall and shoots like that. What can you say?"</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers faced a double-digit deficit by halftime for the
second consecutive game. Unlike Wednesday's 14-point deficit against
the Lakers--a game they would win by five--the Clippers seemed to be
playing well Saturday in some areas.</TE>
<TE>   They made 23 of 42 shots, including six of 11 three-point tries.
They also had 58 points by halftime, which beat the 35 they had
against the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Trouble was, the Clippers failed to guard anyone in a blue-on-blue
uniform Saturday. They also refused to block out anyone with the word
"Dallas" written across his jersey. So, the Clippers trailed, 70-58,
at the half.</TE>
<TE>   Matchup problems cropped up all over the court, which was not
unexpected.</TE>
<TE>   Elton Brand couldn't check Nowitzki, Dallas' roving 7-footer who
had 17 points at the break. Juwan Howard created problems closer to
the basket for the Clippers, adding 17 points on seven of 11 shooting
and three of three free throws.</TE>
<TE>   Toughest for Gentry to stomach at halftime was the Mavericks' 21-8
rebounding advantage. The Clippers' inability to block out resulted
in eight offensive rebounds for Dallas. As a result, Dallas had 14
second-chance points to only five for the Clippers.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>One game after putting Lamar Odom on the injured list because of a
sprained right wrist, the Clippers faced a serious matchup problem
Saturday against the Dallas Mavericks.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Alvin Gentry could have put Odom on Dallas' Dirk Nowitzki, a
7-foot forward every bit as versatile as the 6-10 Odom. But Gentry
was forced to start with Elton Brand, a power forward, on Nowitzki.</LD>
<LD>   Gentry also suggested before the game that he would try different
combinations against the Mavericks, who aren't an easy team to match
from start to finish. Nowitzki, averaging a team-leading 24.5 points
going into the game, is perhaps the toughest to contain.</LD>
<TE>   "Everyone wants to compare him to Larry Bird," Gentry said. "I
think he's closer to Rick Barry. He's quicker than Bird. He's more
athletic than Bird. He makes passes off the dribble better than Bird.
...</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, of all the teams we played, we just weren't close to
beating them," Gentry said of the Mavericks, who won all four games
last season against the Clippers. "I don't know if it was matchups or
what."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The starters for the All-Star game Feb. 10 in Philadelphia were
announced Saturday and Brand was not among those picked for the
Western Conference team. Gentry has been campaigning for Brand in
recent days.</TE>
<TE>   "I would be very disappointed if he's not on the team," Gentry
said of Brand, averaging 18.7 points and 11.3 rebounds. Last week,
Gentry said, "something's not right" if Brand wasn't on the team.</TE>

<DH>Santa Anita: Victory in Santa Monica Handicap takes

<DL></DL>
<LD>Even though Kalookan Queen had won seven times and banked nearly
$484,000, there was something missing from her resume until late
Saturday afternoon at Santa Anita.</LD>
<LD>   Second and third in her two previous starts in Grade I races, the
6-year-old Lost Code mare made the third time the charm with a
half-length victory over 19-1 shot Leading Light and three others in
the $200,000 Santa Monica Handicap.</LD>
<LD>   Trained by Bruce Headley for owner Luis Asistio, Kalookan Queen,
the even-money favorite, tracked the pace outside Favorite Funtime
early, took command approaching the stretch, drew clear, then held
off the longest shot in the field to win in 1:221/5 for the seven
furlongs.</LD>
<TE>   This was a welcome victory for Headley and jockey Alex Solis, who
had lost a heartbreaker in another graded stakes six days earlier. In
the most exciting race of the Santa Anita season, Affluent and Eddie
Delahoussaye had nosed out the Headley-trained and Solis-ridden
Royally Chosen.</TE>
<TE>   "She was really awesome today," said Solis, who has been aboard
for all of Kalookan Queen's victories. "At the eighth pole, she
really got to waiting for other horses and it made it a little
interesting, but she got it done.</TE>
<TE>   "Bruce has done a great job with her. Every year she is getting
better."</TE>
<TE>   Second in last year's Santa Monica behind Honest Lady, Kalookan
Queen definitely has been consistent. A winner in her  debut on Jan.
10, 1999, at Santa Anita, she has finished worse than third only
once--a fourth, after a slow start, in the A Gleam Handicap at
Hollywood Park last summer.</TE>
<TE>   "Winning this one was really important," Headley said after the
dark bay won for the fifth time in nine starts at Santa Anita. "A
Grade I really increases her value.</TE>
<TE>   "I was glad that she had somebody [in front of her] down the
backside. She does well when she lays second.</TE>
<TE>   "She looked good to me turning for home because Alex hadn't turned
her loose yet. When he did, she gave that big burst of speed, but at
the eighth pole, she threw her ears up and kind of started waiting."</TE>
<TE>   Leading Light, who has spent most of her career running in
high-priced claimers, finished two lengths clear of 19-10 second
choice Spain, then came Favorite Funtime and Warren's Whistle.</TE>
<TE>   Closing in on $3 million in career earnings, Spain was trying for
her second Grade I win at seven furlongs, having beaten Cover Gal,
Serenita and Chilukki in the La Brea Stakes at the end of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes her out of what she does best when she has to chase
those kind of fractions [22 and 444/5 for the half-mile]," said Wayne
Lukas, Spain's trainer. "She's a better two-turn filly. We've got
that one under our belt and we'll go from there."</TE>
<TE>   Presumably, Spain will stretch out to 11/16 miles in the $200,000
Santa Maria Handicap on Feb. 17 while Headley indicated Kalookan
Queen, who has never run more than seven furlongs, will shorten up to
three-quarters of a mile in the $125,000 Las Flores Handicap on Feb.
23.</TE>
<TE>   Easyfromthegitgo, the 2-1 favorite, made it three victories in a
row with a nose decision over 2-1 second choice Sky Terrace, who was
hampered by a poor start, in the $100,000 Lecomte Stakes at the Fair
Grounds in New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by James Cassels and Bob Zollars and trained by Steve
Asmussen, Easyfromthegitgo, the 3-year-old son of Dehere completed
the mile in 1:374/5, the fastest time of the meet for the distance.</TE>
<TE>   "The race went perfect," said jockey Donnie Meche, who picked up
his 1,000th career victory in the Lecomte. "He had the one hole [post
position] and he doesn't mind dirt in his face....</TE>
<TE>   "Going around the turn, I had a lot of horse and I eased him out
and he pinned his ears back, jumped to his right lead and gave me an
extra little bit."</TE>
<TE>   A day after the Television Games Network began opening accounts
and accepting bets over the telephone and through the Internet,
XpressBet, which is owned by Magna Entertainment, kicked off
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Magna, the corporation that owns Santa Anita, Gulfstream Park and
Golden Gate Fields, was granted its license for XpressBet by the
California Horse Racing Board on Thursday  and those who opened
accounts could start making wagers at some 40 tracks.</TE>
<TE>   Given the experience of at least one person, fans apparently could
not wait to get involved, but they also had to have patience.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking to open an account, a reporter was on hold for nearly 20
minutes Saturday morning, waiting for the "first available
representative" to assist him.</TE>
<TE>   While holding, he was entertained by an audio feed from the
Meadows Racing Network. He heard the scratches and changes for the
entire card at the Fair Grounds, a rundown and a selection for the
first at that track from the nameless voice, a synopsis on the field
for the third at Aqueduct and the second at Gulfstream Park and a
live call from track announcer Vic Stauffer of the second at
Gulfstream.</TE>
<TE>   Once connected with a representative at the XpressBet hub in
Pennsylvania, the reporter, after choosing a password, set up his
account in a matter of minutes. After depositing $100--plus a $6
surcharge--he was free to start making wagers on any available races.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been extremely busy," an XpressBet operator said. "We've
been getting a lot of calls from California for the past couple of
days."</TE>
<TE>   A signup booth on the first floor of the grandstand--there was
another in the clubhouse--was doing brisk business before and during
the Santa Anita races on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a lot of customers," said Jessica Anderson, the
director of account wagering for XpressBet. "The booths have been
extremely busy since the gates opened. The interest has been very
good."</TE>
<TE>   For now, the only real way for phone or Internet bettors to see
the races is, of course, to be at a track or via computer by logging
on to Xpressbet.com. Magna has started a television satellite
service, but it currently has limited access. The company desires to
expand in the coming months and is looking to gain access to
providers of cable television.</TE>

<HD>Kings Lose Ugly</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Murray is ejected after Avalanche takes advantage
of 10 power-play chances to win, 4-2.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It had been smooth sailing for the Kings for so long that when they
hit some choppy water Saturday at Staples Center, their coach seemed
to snap.</LD>
<LD>   Andy Murray's displeasure with referees Mike Hassenfratz and
Dennis LaRue in a 4-2 loss to the Colorado Avalanche led to the
ejection of the coach and a shower of debris raining down on the ice
from a sellout crowd of 18,332.</LD>
<LD>   It was an ugly ending to a tightly contested game between surging
teams that were meeting for the first time since they battled through
seven games last spring in the Western Conference semifinals. The
Avalanche prevailed then, too.</LD>
<TE>   The Avalanche ended up with a 10-2 power-play advantage, which
apparently became too much for Murray to bear in the final minute.</TE>
<TE>   The Avalanche had taken a 3-2 lead with 3:54 to play on Milan
Hejduk's second power-play goal of the game, scored with King center
Bryan Smolinski in the penalty box for tripping.</TE>
<TE>   Then, with the Avalanche again enjoying a man advantage after King
defenseman Mathieu Schneider was whistled for interference with 1:47
remaining, King center Jason Allison was knocked down by Martin
Skoula.</TE>
<TE>   The prudent thing for Allison to do at that point, probably, would
have been to turn the other cheek. Instead, he took a shot at the
defenseman.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to play the way you play," Allison explained.</TE>
<TE>   He was called for roughing, and Murray turned red on the bench.</TE>
<TE>   When Hassenfratz gave him a bench minor, the crowd expressed its
displeasure by littering.</TE>
<TE>   The ice was pelted with beer, soda, peanuts and other debris.</TE>
<TE>   When it was cleaned off and the game resumed about 10 minutes
later, the Avalanche had a two-man advantage for the final 34
seconds.</TE>
<TE>   And Murray was in the dressing room, having been ejected.</TE>
<TE>   He had to watch on television as Chris Drury scored his second
goal with four seconds to play, capping the Avalanche's sixth
consecutive victory.</TE>
<TE>   Murray was much calmer afterward, though still upset.</TE>
<TE>   "It's disappointing," he said of the officiating, "because it's a
tight-checking, highly competitive, physical hockey game. I felt for
our players. I thought we were battling, and not to be given a fair
opportunity was disappointing."</TE>
<TE>   Of the call on Allison, the coach said, "If anything, the referee
could have saved a little bit of credibility by sending them both
off."</TE>
<TE>   Murray questioned why Hassenfratz and LaRue, who also worked
Thursday night's 4-2 victory over the Minnesota Wild, were back in
Staples Center less than 48 hours after awarding the Wild a 6-3
power-play advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Though he said he was not surprised to be slapped with a game
misconduct, he indicated that his behavior might not have warranted
an ejection.</TE>
<TE>   "I just asked the referee to come over and give me an
explanation," he said. "I didn't swear at him. I just said, 'Come
over and tell me what's going on.'</TE>
<TE>   "He refused."</TE>
<TE>   His outburst, the coach said, was a statement to his players.</TE>
<TE>   "We may be the L.A. Kings and a team that's still trying to
emerge," he said, "but we merit the same type of refereeing as
everybody else does."</TE>
<TE>   Most surprisingly, perhaps, Murray praised the crowd's reaction.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought the fans were great tonight," he said. "I think they
were just like us. They were frustrated."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, who got a first-period goal from Ian Laperriere, had
overcome a 2-1 deficit, pulling even on a third-period power-play
goal by Jaroslav Modry.</TE>
<TE>   But the Avalanche, which had won only one of its previous 10
regular-season games in Los Angeles, kept the pressure on and
eventually emerged with a victory that improved its record to
20-4-5-1 since Nov. 21.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, 15-5-3 since Dec. 8, had won nine of their last 11.</TE>
<TE>   Murray's players, for the most part, refused to indict the
referees.</TE>
<TE>   "You've still got to help yourself," Smolinski said. "We put
ourselves in situations that got us some penalties. You can't do
that. It was lopsided, but so what? You've got to realize what
they're calling and act accordingly."</TE>
<TE>   Said winger Steve Heinze: "Like my mother used to tell me: If you
don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything."</TE>
<TE>   The former Boston Bruin said he'd never seen a coach ejected.</TE>
<TE>   And sodas showering the ice?</TE>
<TE>   "Saw that a lot in Boston."</TE>

<HD>Teammates Share Kobe's Night</HD>

<DL>ARDMORE, Pa.</DL>
<LD>On the night Lower Merion High retired his No. 33, Kobe Bryant stood
again in its gym, where nearly six years ago he announced he would go
from 12th grade to the NBA.</LD>
<LD>   From a stage that nearly teetered over on Saturday night, in a
room of thick oak bleachers and maroon banners, Bryant could look
across most of his life.</LD>
<LD>   His parents sat to his right. His young wife, Vanessa, sat ahead
of him.</LD>
<TE>   Some 1,500 friends, classmates and fans sat behind her, each
having paid $10 for the 90-minute ceremony. There were many
highlights of Kobe, bald, crossing over 10th-graders who became
accountants.</TE>
<TE>   That was all expected, along with the English teachers and
basketball coaches and former teammates.</TE>
<TE>   What made them all gasp, however, what made Bryant smile so large
and touch his chest, were the surprise attendees in the third row. On
a weekend night in a strange town, with plenty of other things to do,
they sat, from left to right: Shaquille O'Neal, Brian Shaw, Samaki
Walker, Devean George, Mark Madsen and Rick Fox.</TE>
<TE>   They watched the videos. And they politely applauded the
superintendent of schools. And they laughed with the kid with the
funny stories about Kobe, not passing to him, either.</TE>
<TE>   When it was done, O'Neal stood first and strode to the stage and
held out his hand, and Bryant hugged him instead.</TE>
<TE>   "I love you guys," Bryant said to them, to everyone, over and
over.</TE>
<TE>   At least Bryant was cheered in one gym in this town. Bryant
admitted last year's NBA Finals, the last three games played not 15
miles away in Philadelphia, was bigger than he let on.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt good to be home," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He left them without hair, and returned finally with two NBA
championships, and millions of dollars, a handful of security guards,
an agent, a wife and six teammates. Beneath the low metal girders in
the gym where his game was made, he returned finally with autographs
and grace, and people actually screamed and stood on their seats when
he walked in.</TE>
<TE>   One man in particular held a camera to his face and took flash
pictures for nearly the entire ceremony, and he laughed and he waved
at Bryant, causing a mild disruption. It got so the superintendent
had to ask "Mr. O'Neal" to settle down. After all, it was Kobe's
night.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers embark today on a five-game trip through Philadelphia,
Atlanta, Orlando, Memphis and Dallas, with an excursion Monday to the
White House, where President Bush will honor them for last season's
championship.</TE>
<TE>   On the eve of their cross-country charter flight and their second
arduous trip of the month, the Lakers ended a short losing streak.
They beat the San Antonio Spurs when they had the urge to, which was
better than losing consecutive games to Denver and the Clippers at
Staples Center, and lifted them momentarily from the haze of five
losses in seven games.</TE>
<TE>   Still, at 29-11 they are three victories better than at the same
time last season, which resulted in a second consecutive championship
and some very short memories.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, Phil Jackson said he hopes they are working toward
something resembling what they were late last season, when their 23-1
run after April 1 won the title.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If the Lakers win today, Jackson will coach the West All-Stars in
Philadelphia on Feb. 10.</TE>
<TE>   The Sacramento Kings will reach tonight's deadline with a better
winning percentage, but Rick Adelman coached the game in Washington
last season, and the NBA forbids the same coach in consecutive years.</TE>
<TE>   That leaves Jackson and Dallas Coach Don Nelson as the candidates.</TE>
<TE>   If the Lakers lose, Nelson goes.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota Coach Flip Saunders was eliminated from consideration
when the Mavericks beat the Clippers Saturday night.</TE>

<HD>Lakers Need to Win the Bore War</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Courtside, the season drones on.</LD>
<LD>   Honey, order me the duck l'orange. OK, Mike, I'll tell Steven,
breakfast at John O'Groats. He's right down the row. ... Sorry, I'm
at the Laker game, reception's terrible in here. ... Denver. ...
Well, we had the tickets, they're $1,250 per, we thought we may as
well use 'em. ... No, I think they're losing, actually.</LD>
<LD>   It's peaceful in the Big Office Supply Store, which may or may not
be the world's greatest arena but is surely the world's quietest,
except, of course, when the Clippers are at home.</LD>
<TE>   I'm not going to do a lot of stereotypes about cell phones,
designer water, etc., even if a Laker crowd's aggregate income is
bigger than the gross domestic product of a small country, because
this isn't an L.A. thing, simply an L.A. variant.</TE>
<TE>   Boredom is a problem for dynasts, real and presumed. Even in
Chicago, where the attitude seemed to be, "What else do we have to
live for?" Bull fans came to sit serenely for months, awaiting the
real deal.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it's not good if the team nods off too, as the Lakers
did after starting 16-1.</TE>
<TE>   "We were accused of being boring the first 20 games," Rick Fox
said last week, laughing. "We've created some interest here, due to
our lack of play."</TE>
<TE>   Try 13-10 since, with losses to all four last-place teams and one
to the lowly Denver Nuggets, allowing 106 points per no-show. The
Laker defensive average is 92.6.</TE>
<TE>   Forget such voodoo terms as "execution" and "rhythm." How about
"can't always be bothered to defend"?</TE>
<TE>   Not that this should be a surprise. Last season's Lakers did what
no team is supposed to be able to, they threw a switch on April 1 and
became invincible.</TE>
<TE>   Now they're much better, Kobe Bryant is part of the team and, to
all appearances, finally cool with Shaquille O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   "Before they stood off and the cat hissed at the dog from 50 yards
away and the dog kind of messed around with the cat a little to make
him hiss," Coach Phil Jackson recently told the Chicago Tribune's Sam
Smith. "Now the cat is playing with the dog. ...</TE>
<TE>   "It's delightful to see. It's almost to a point now where they
like one another too much and they want to play with one another ...
and it almost takes the rest of the team out of the game."</TE>
<TE>   Detroit personnel director John Hammond called the Lakers "almost
invincible," something you don't hear very often.</TE>
<TE>   What could go wrong now?</TE>
<TE>   1. The Lakers think they can throw their switch again.</TE>
<TE>   They deny it, but it's human nature. So much for fear, which is a
potent driving force for the other teams.</TE>
<TE>   "The challenge was to get off to a good start," Fox said. "Then
after we get off to the good start, it's like, OK, where's the
challenge?"</TE>
<TE>   Staying awake?</TE>
<TE>   2. Chemistry.</TE>
<TE>   The Nos. 3-12 guys all play, vie for and, apparently, talk about
their minutes and shots, which is what you get with depth, recently
so negligible.</TE>
<TE>   Lindsey Hunter was an emergency replacement for Derek Fisher,
who's now well, leaving mirror-image guards, lefty and righty, to
split minutes. Mitch Richmond was going to be the sixth man, but
before he grasped the triangle, Devean George grasped his minutes,
dropping Mitch to the 10th man.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very set in the sense that we know we win with Kobe and
Shaq, but where does everybody else fall in?" Fox says.</TE>
<TE>   "We had better chemistry as a basketball team on the floor than we
do now. We have less problems off the floor than we did last year."</TE>
<TE>   3. Shaq's head, big toe, trials and growing disdain for the long
grind.</TE>
<TE>   He has been vowing privately not to take any more abuse, when he
has no choice but to take it, learn to play on the perimeter or
retire.</TE>
<TE>   "It can't be fun for him," Jackson says. "I mean, what fun is
there when three guys are jumping on your back when you catch the
ball in the lane to start taking a shot? Where's the basketball play?
What is that all about?"</TE>
<TE>   Then there's O'Neal's toe, although by Friday he was using a
larger shoe and romping among the San Antonio Spurs like a lion among
antelope. His reps, Perry Rogers and Mike Parris, said they had a
"team in place" to treat the Big Piggie.</TE>
<TE>   Starting the weekend, the standings had the Lakers in a tie for
No.3 in the Western Conference, but that's probably only a
misunderstanding.</TE>
<TE>   Go back to your lives. We'll call you if they need you.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Faces and Figures</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to have career averages of 19 points and 10 rebounds for
three seasons without getting an All-Star sniff, but that's what
Elton Brand is looking at, unless West coaches pick a squad with one
center and six forwards, rather than the usual two and five. They
could easily go with one center, because forwards Tim Duncan and
Kevin Garnett and sure-to-be-named Chris Webber can play there.
Adding a reserve center means leaving three forwards off the
deserving list of Brand, Webber, Karl Malone, Dirk Nowitzki, Peja
Stojakovic and Rasheed Wallace. The West's second-best center, Vlade
Divac, is deserving, just not as much as they are.... Washington
Wizard Coach Doug Collins is reaching out to rookie Kwame Brown,
saying he stressed out the 19-year-old so badly, Brown broke out with
acne. Said teammate Christian Laettner, who played with the young
Garnett in Minnesota: "As good as Kevin was, he wasn't ready until
sometime in February. He got up to speed then. He started to pick up
the subtleties of the game, things like spacing, reading defense,
anticipating what would happen next. Kwame, he's really far away."
... Toronto Raptor General Manager Glen Grunwald, in a near-vote of
confidence for Coach Lenny Wilkens: "I'm not going to say the media
can't say what they want to say, but I think the criticism is
undeserved. And that's not to say Lenny isn't trying to do things
differently. He's working on it and that's all you can ask." ...
Bobblehead and good-night: It could be coincidence, but Lamar Odom
was suspended the night they gave his dolls away. Dallas' Michael
Finley, who had never missed a game in his eight seasons, pulled a
hamstring and went out on his. The night of his, Denver Coach Dan
Issel yelled at a fan, ending his career.</TE>
<TE>   Panic hit New York officially after the Knicks lost at home to the
Charlotte Hornets--by 43--while fans chanted "Re-fund!" The Knicks
were so dispirited, Charlotte's P.J. Brown asked someone on press
row: "Are they trying to make some type of statement with this? Is
there some kind of conspiracy going on over there?" ... New York
Times columnist Ira Berkow to Coach Don Chaney, then 4-16, at the
next day's practice: "Are you surprised to be here today?" ...
Assistant Coach Tim Thibodeau is supposed to be the (latest) heir
apparent, but as Jeff Van Gundy's protege, he's triggering the old
Van Gundy-Dave Checketts split, even though both are gone. The New
York Times quoted a Knick source saying that Thibodeau would be too
tough. The Daily News quoted a source who said, "I think the
organization hates Van Gundy so much that they don't want to hire his
right-hand man. That's why they keep bad-mouthing Thibodeau in the
papers." ... Highlights from Michael Jordan's return to Chicago: The
ovation from Bull fans that had tears in Mike's eyes was cut short at
two minutes when house lights were dimmed. Bull promotions director
Steve Schanwald said NBC did it. Neither owner Jerry Reinsdorf nor GM
Jerry Krause attended....Charles Oakley, after Bull teammate Ron
Artest said the lights should have been dimmed sooner: "I could've
waited a half-hour. That's once in a lifetime. These guys have never
done anything." ... More chemical problems: Penny Hardaway says he
defers to Stephon Marbury and Shawn Marion in the Phoenix Suns'
offense "so they can get their rhythm and to keep the fuss down." ...
Tim Kawakami of the San Jose Mercury-News, on Shaq as a fighter:
"He's massively strong, he looks scary and he goes WWF on-court every
few seasons to keep thugs off him. But he has never thrown a real
punch in a game and I don't know what that was he threw at Brad
Miller, but it wasn't a punch."</TE>

<HD>Not That Easy</HD>
<DH>Faulk, Stewart Had Some Rough Years in New Orleans, but Now
It Looks Super</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>They vowed to escape New Orleans, but now, a decade later, Marshall
Faulk and Kordell Stewart will do just about anything to return.</LD>
<LD>   "I lived close to the Superdome," said Stewart, Pittsburgh's
quarterback, who grew up just across the Mississippi river. "It would
take you all day to swim it, a half-day to walk, and about 15 minutes
driving."</LD>
<LD>   Today, getting to the Superdome is a four-quarter proposition.
Stewart will lead the Steelers against New England in the AFC
championship game; Faulk, star running back for the St. Louis Rams,
will face Philadelphia in the NFC title game.</LD>
<TE>   "It would be like a homecoming for me," Stewart said. "My family
is there, all of my friends, my true friends. The stomping grounds
where I started as a little buck in Little League, running track,
being all-metro, everything.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be a special moment."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart referred to the city as "my crib" but didn't delve into
the painful memories of losing his mother to liver cancer when he was
12. Faulk, asked to recall his childhood, was edgy and curt, even
brushing off the subject of playing against Stewart in high school.</TE>
<TE>   "When I tell you I don't remember, I don't remember," he said.
"You can't make me remember."</TE>
<TE>   Any other memories of New Orleans?</TE>
<TE>   "Next question."</TE>
<TE>   Cecile Faulk remembers. She raised six sons in the Desire public
housing complex, among the most destitute projects in the country, a
place where they no longer cover broken windows with aluminum because
too often it's stolen and sold for scrap.</TE>
<TE>   "If you lived there you'd understand," she said. "If you can make
it out of there, that's good. If you see a black boy make it out of
there, that's a blessing. You never know when one of those stray
bullets is coming."</TE>
<TE>   According to the New Orleans Times-Picayune, Marshall's brother,
Raymond, was sentenced to seven years in prison for armed robbery;
and his best friend from high school, Mark Bruno, got a one-year
sentence for theft.</TE>
<TE>   When Cecile was unable to make ends meet with her jobs as a hotel
maid and Woolworth's clerk, she let Marshall, her youngest son, live
with the Bruno family.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the Faulks were able to move to a small house when
Marshall was 12, money was so tight the family heated the place with
the kitchen stove. Marshall worked with the custodial crew, sweeping
the halls of Carver High before school. He also sold popcorn at New
Orleans Saint games and cut hair for $5 a head.</TE>
<TE>   "Marshall was one of those special kids," said Wayne Reese, his
football coach at Carver. "He was well-mannered, a good student. He
was a quiet kid that never said much, and he didn't get into anything
that was out of the ordinary."</TE>
<TE>   But he wasn't an angel. He and his friends would stir up trouble
with the police by making a mad dash every time they saw a squad car,
even if they had done nothing wrong. Reese said Faulk had a bit of a
"thug" side on the field. Faulk doesn't deny that.</TE>
<TE>   "When it's fourth-and-two, it helps if you have an evil side," he
told Sports Illustrated in 1992. "On fourth-and-two, I'm Freddy
Krueger."</TE>
<TE>   Faulk has a soft side too. His mother used to rest her head in his
lap when she would get home from working one of her many jobs. He
would stroke her hair and make promises, sounding as naive as he was
earnest.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't worry, Mom," he would tell her. "I'm going to take care of
you."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart never got the chance to make those vows. His mother,
Florence, a nurse, died just before Christmas in 1983 after battling
cancer for 10 years. Earlier that fall, she and her husband, Robert,
separated then divorced. Kordell, the youngest of three, lived with
his mother until she died.</TE>
<TE>   "She got so small, she got so sick and it hit her so fast, it was
incredible," he told the Denver Post in 1994, during his final season
at Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Kordell, along with his older brother and sister, moved in with
their father, who grew up in a New Orleans project and made a life
for himself as a barber. The family was close, and was drawn even
closer by Florence's death.</TE>
<TE>   The family was rocked again four years ago when Kordell's sister,
Falisha, died at 29, also of liver cancer.</TE>
<TE>   "We still live with the sadness of that every day," Robert said.</TE>
<TE>   He owned a hair salon called "Second Edition," and it wasn't
uncommon for young Kordell to spend an entire day there, honing his
skills with a shaver and scissors.</TE>
<TE>   Kordell learned the value of a dollar from his father, whom he
still calls "Daddy." When Robert was a kid, he used to collect old
newspapers and sell them to the dog pound to line the kennels.</TE>
<TE>   "I usually got a penny a pound, then it went up to two cents. We
only lived a half-block from the dog pound, and the other guys lived
a couple miles away, so I had a jump on them. I'd go around in the
evenings and get the papers, then I'd have it there early in the
morning. I'd bring home three or four dollars a day."</TE>
<TE>   Years later, even though he owned the barbershop, Robert took on
odd jobs to augment his income. He worked as a handyman, a gardener,
a mechanic, anything to provide for his family.</TE>
<TE>   He still keeps the Father's Day card he got from Kordell in 1994
that reads:</TE>
<TE>   "What's up? I know you're working hard and trying to make ends
meet to pay bills. Just relax and chill because I'm doing all I can
for you so you won't have to work in the hot sun anymore. I'm
graduating very soon, and I love you very much."</TE>
<TE>   That love shows. When Kordell went through his struggles with the
Steelers two seasons ago--getting booed, benched then demoted from
quarterback to receiver--he asked his father to come stay with him in
Pittsburgh. Because Robert is a nervous flyer, Kordell offered to
send a limousine all the way to New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   Robert conquered his fears and took a commercial flight to
Pittsburgh the week before Christmas this season, then, on Christmas
Eve, flew back to New Orleans with Kordell on a chartered jet.
Kordell stayed for a day, sharing stories and reminiscing at the
house, then flew back to rejoin his team.</TE>
<TE>   Robert has redecorated the family home, but he keeps a bedroom for
Kordell. The Walter Payton posters aren't there anymore, although his
son's favorite teddy bear still sits on the bed.</TE>
<TE>   "Kordell is a nice man," he said. "He has nice ways. If somebody
says they don't like Kordell, there's something wrong with them."</TE>
<TE>   Robert sees that kindness in his son whenever he visits
Pittsburgh, where fans have toasted Kordell in good times, doused him
with beer in bad. Through it all, he has maintained his warmth, even
when fellow restaurant patrons interrupt him mid-bite in search of an
autograph.</TE>
<TE>   "One lady came all the way from Mississippi, and she was crying
and hugging him like she had seen Jesus," Robert said. "I never saw
anything like that. I thought she was going to pass out."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart gets a similar reception when he goes back to his alma
mater, John Ehret High, and works out after the season.</TE>
<TE>   "A couple of years ago, the first few days Kordell was here, the
girls' softball team was lined up at the window peeking into the
classroom," Coach Billy North said. "Our football players had seen
him around the neighborhood. But to actually have him come work out
with us was great. After a while, it was just like he was another one
of the fellas."</TE>
<TE>   Playing quarterback was new to Stewart when he got to high school.
He had been a receiver and defensive back. He worked his way into the
backup quarterback job by his sophomore year, and was the
first-string kicker. The starting quarterback, Ernest Calloway,
doubled as the holder.</TE>
<TE>   Midway through his sophomore season, Stewart accidentally kicked
Calloway's hand and broke it. Suddenly, Stewart was the starting
quarterback, a job he never surrendered.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Faulk didn't play organized football until high school.
All his experience came from sandlot games with his brothers, most of
which were held on a patch of bottle-strewn grass between two
tenements.</TE>
<TE>   "He came out for football and really didn't know anything about
it," Reese said. "He was just standing around and observing. He was
the type of guy that wouldn't jump in there. You'd almost have to
push him.</TE>
<TE>   "After a while, you'd see him out there and to see how graceful he
was. To be that good and say he'd never played organized football.
You could see that this kid had something special."</TE>
<TE>   The Carver football program subsisted on a $2,500 annual budget,
with threadbare uniforms, out-of-date helmets, and a poorly equipped
workout room.</TE>
<TE>   "What I used to do is call other teams--there were four in our
district--and I would schedule games with tough teams," Reese said.
"They would pay us to come play them, because it was cheaper for them
not to travel. When Marshall came, we started winning. All of a
sudden, teams were paying us to come beat them. So that didn't work
out after a while."</TE>
<TE>   Twice, Faulk's team scrimmaged Stewart's. In one of those games,
Faulk ran for 400 yards and six touchdowns. Recently, North dug
through boxes for four hours in an unsuccessful attempt to find that
game footage.</TE>
<TE>   Faulk went on to star at San Diego State, and when he signed his
first NFL contract with Indianapolis, he designed and purchased new
helmets and uniforms for his high school team. Later, he had Nike
send the players about 200 pairs of shoes.</TE>
<TE>   "We were able to give our kids a game shoe, a practice shoe and a
turf shoe," Reese said. "That was amazing, to go from no shoes to
three shoes."</TE>
<TE>   Faulk's first commitment, of course, was to his mother. He bought
her a $260,000, six-bedroom home in eastern New Orleans--where she
lives with three of her sons--and covers all her bills. He also
bought her a new Lexus, although she returned it because she's
nervous about driving.</TE>
<TE>   After every game, he calls his mother and starts the conversation
the same way: "Hey, Lady ..."</TE>
<TE>   "He's still my baby," Cecile said.</TE>
<TE>   And those promises he made still resonate.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think they would ever happen," she said. "You've just
got to pay attention when your children are talking."</TE>

<HD>Ridnour Gives Oregon More</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oregon's Luke Ridnour and Washington State's Marcus Moore impressed
each other with their performances.</LD>
<LD>   And both wanted to talk about their opponent's efforts instead of
their own.</LD>
<LD>   Ridnour's career-high 24 points led No. 19 Oregon to a 94-86
victory over the Cougars on Saturday at Pullman, Wash., but he
deflected questions about his play to praise Moore, who finished with
a career-high 35 points.</LD>
<TE>   "We're just two competitive guys that came to play, to try to get
our team a win," Ridnour said.</TE>
<TE>   "I really like his game," Moore said of Ridnour. "He just goes out
there and beats teams."</TE>
<TE>   James Davis had a career-high 21 points as the Ducks, 15-5 overall
and 7-2 in conference, broke a late first-half tie and took control.
Frederick Jones scored 14 points and had nine rebounds, and Luke
Jackson had 11 points.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State Coach Paul Graham said Davis, a 5-foot-10
sophomore reserve, may have been the difference.</TE>
<TE>   "Our starters work hard and we know when we come in there, what
our job is," Davis said. "We have to hold up our end."</TE>
<TE>   Moore's performance came as Washington State (4-14, 0-10) lost its
12th consecutive. Mike Bush scored nine points to become the 23rd
player in school history to score 1,000 points.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon Coach Ernie Kent was impressed with Moore's effort, which
bested his previous high of 31 points set this season against Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   "He played at a different level. I don't think I've ever seen him
play at that level before," Kent said. "He was just phenomenal."</TE>
<TE>   Ridnour went a point above his previous best of 23, set Thursday
at Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon outrebounded the Cougars, 35-27, and made 52.8% of their
shots from the field. Washington State continued its poor shooting
streak, hitting only 47.7% from the field.</TE>
<TE>   Ridnour scored 12 points in the first half as the Ducks went on a
13-4 run in the final six minutes to take a 43-34 halftime lead. The
Ducks led by 21 points when Ridnour's layup made it 73-52 midway
through the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Behind consecutive three-point baskets by Moore, the Cougars went
on an 18-2 run to make it 75-70 with five minutes left, but the Ducks
pulled away at the free-throw line.</TE>
<TE>   "They were definitely being the aggressor," Kent said of the
Cougars' comeback try. "They stepped it up, but then we took the wind
out of their sails. We needed to regroup and we got stops down the
stretch and we made our free throws down the stretch."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oregon State 68, Washington 53--Philip Ricci scored 21 points and
led two key runs for the Beavers as they defeated the Huskies at
Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon State, which made nine of 14 three-pointers, won its second
consecutive conference game after losing six of its first seven.</TE>
<TE>   Jimmie Haywood scored 11 points and made two three-pointers for
Oregon State (10-9, 3-6), which has won five consecutive games in the
series with Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Wrenn scored 19 points and David Dixon had his fifth
double-double of the season with 10 points and 10 rebounds for the
Huskies (8-12, 2-8), who upset Oregon on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   There were four lead changes and four ties early.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon State took the lead for good after a 14-2 run late in the
first half that included a short jump shot, a jump hook and a
three-point play by Ricci, who also finished with nine rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   The Huskies missed their last seven shots of the first half and
trailed, 32-24, at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Ricci scored seven points as the Beavers opened the second half
with a 12-5 run to put the game away.</TE>
<TE>   Combined with Thursday's 74-72 victory over Washington State, the
Beavers accomplished their first conference road sweep since
defeating both of the Washington schools in 2000.</TE>

<HD>Arizona Can't Pull Rank on Connecticut</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TUCSON</DL>
<LD>Connecticut finally made the national rankings Monday, barely, at No.
25.</LD>
<LD>   Saturday's nationally televised 100-98 overtime victory over No.
10 Arizona should earn the Huskies a little more attention.</LD>
<LD>   "It's clearly the biggest statement we've made as a team this
year, and it was a great basketball game," Connecticut Coach Jim
Calhoun said. "We had to draw everything out within ourselves to
win."</LD>
<TE>   Connecticut freshmen Emeka Okafor and Ben Gordon shared the
spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   Okafor was a blocked shot shy of a triple-double with 19 points
and 15 rebounds, and Gordon matched his career-high with 23 points
and had a career-best nine assists as Connecticut (14-3) won its
sixth in a row and defeated Arizona (13-6) for the third time in as
many games.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a classic game," said Connecticut's Taliek Brown, who
scored four of his 21 points in overtime. "They would hit threes,
then we would score, and then we would play good defense, and it was
just back and forth the whole game."</TE>
<TE>   Arizona's Salim Stoudamire made consecutive three-point shots to
start the overtime, giving the Wildcats a 97-91 lead.</TE>
<TE>   But a three-point basket by Gordon and two layups by Brown gave
Connecticut a 98-97 lead with a minute left.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona's Jason Gardner, who had a game-high 30 points but none in
overtime, missed a three-point shot, then Johnnie Selvie scored
inside to give Connecticut a 100-97 lead with 20 seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Gardner was fouled by Brown just before taking a three-point shot
with 10 seconds left. He missed the first free throw and made the
second.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona stole the inbounds pass, but Will Bynum missed a wide-open
three-point shot from the baseline with two seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Gardner had scored 24 points in the second half to allow Arizona
to overcome a 14-point deficit. Gardner made an NBA-length
three-point shot to give the Wildcats a 91-89 lead with 41 seconds
left in regulation, but Butler's inside basket with 19 seconds to
play tied it.</TE>
<TE>   After Gardner's driving layup was blocked by Okafor, Luke Walton
threw the inbounds pass away--one of his seven turnovers--but
Connecticut couldn't get a shot off before the regulation ended.</TE>
<TE>   "The difference in the game was Okafor," Arizona Coach Lute Olson
said. "Every time we seemed to have an opportunity to get to the
bucket, he was there. He changed the total complexion of the game."</TE>

<DH>After Years of Delays, South L.A.'s Dream Field Is a
Reality</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL PLASCHKE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is a freeway beyond the right-field foul line. Screeching
police cars behind the left-field fence. Jumbo jets descending high
above the pitcher's mound.</LD>
<LD>   Yet here on this patch of south Los Angeles lawn, it is strangely
quiet.</LD>
<LD>   A bird flutters into the deep green grass. A foot shuffles through
the warning track gravel. A bat taps home plate.</LD>
<TE>   So quiet, you can hear a kid dream.</TE>
<TE>   So quiet, you can hear an old man sigh.</TE>
<TE>   "A sanctuary," says scout Phil Pote, shuffling toward first base
on a recent clear morning at the corner of Imperial and Western.</TE>
<TE>   No longer a harebrained scheme, no longer a political trinket,
but, finally, a sanctuary.</TE>
<TE>   A brand-new baseball field. Smack in the middle of our city. The
first one built in these parts in more than 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, it became official. Painted right there on the press
box. Yeah, there's even a press box.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Gilbert Field.</TE>
<TE>   It rose from the vision of longtime bird dog Pote, from the
influence of youth baseball guru John Young, and from the wallet of
former agent Gilbert.</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, a guy once famous for taking money from baseball owners on
behalf of such clients as Barry Bonds and Jose Canseco just gave some
of it back.</TE>
<TE>   More than $1 million, his donation sprawled out grandly behind
L.A. Southwest College today with bullpens and bleachers and,
eventually, lights.</TE>
<TE>   There's even a raised pitching mound.</TE>
<TE>   You laugh?</TE>
<TE>   For years, our inner-city schools have failed to produce top
pitchers because many of them play on recreational-park fields that
don't have mounds.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd take a kid out to a tryout on a real field, and he'd get
dizzy pitching off a hill," recalled Young.</TE>
<TE>   There's also even a regulation backstop.</TE>
<TE>   You laugh again?</TE>
<TE>   This city has also had trouble producing catchers because those
recreational parks have enclosed, overhanging batting cages to
prevent the loss of foul balls.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd bring catchers to tryouts and somebody would hit a high pop
foul behind home plate and the kid would corkscrew himself into the
ground trying to catch it," said Young. "Because the kid had never
seen something like that before."</TE>
<TE>   The absolutely best part of Gilbert Field, of course, is the
infield.</TE>
<TE>   Yep, it's grass, which is no big deal unless you've ever tried to
field a ground ball out of the dust.</TE>
<TE>   Growing up in Gardena, Gilbert reached high school before he ever
played on a grass infield. Later, after a minor-league career
inspired him to become an agent, Gilbert would try to help other
inner-city infielders who had also never played on grass.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter what," Gilbert said, "this infield was going to be
grass."</TE>
<TE>   And no matter what, the fences enclosing his field were not going
to be too tall.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to have fences around the whole place, of course," Pote
said with a smile. "But they aren't so big that kids can't climb them
with their bats and gloves."</TE>
<TE>   This is the fifth time this space has been used to describe this
field.</TE>
<TE>   This is the first time, though, that there has been a real field
to describe.</TE>
<TE>   The previous four stories have recounted crazy idealists and
impossible bureaucracy and silly baseball caps.</TE>
<TE>   The baseball caps story was the first one, five years ago,
introducing Pote and a dream that stretched back twice as far.</TE>
<TE>   It was March 1996. It was one year before the 50th anniversary of
Jackie Robinson's major league debut. Folks were already bemoaning
the decreasing number of minorities in our national pastime, even as
those numbers were soaring in other sports.</TE>
<TE>   How could this be? I called Pote, a Panama hat-wearing Seattle
Mariner scout in his mid-60s who had spent his life coaching and
teaching baseball in south Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Pote invited me to a game involving Locke High, the alma mater of
hall of famer Ozzie Smith and Eddie Murray.</TE>
<TE>   Watching the game on a scraggly field in front of a handful of
people, the first thing I noticed were the Locke baseball caps.</TE>
<TE>   They were different colors. They had different logos. Turns out,
each player was wearing a cap from his favorite major league team
because the school couldn't afford to buy them Locke caps.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess this is what they mean by diversity," Pote said with a
laugh.</TE>
<TE>   Across the dugout from Locke was Fremont High, a team that at one
time had produced more major leaguers--23--than any other high school
in the country. But on this day, its field had a hole behind home
plate and bases with more mobility than the baserunners.</TE>
<TE>   "This is why we need a field," Pote said. "We have to give more of
these kids a chance."</TE>
<TE>   He said he had this idea since 1989. He said he had even called
Universal Studios and asked if he could call his project "Field of
Dreams."</TE>
<TE>   The studios said no. So Pote decided to call it "Dream of a
Field."</TE>
<TE>   He found a vacant lot on the campus of L.A. Southwest College.
Officials there tentatively agreed to allow Pote to build a field if
he could pay for it himself.</TE>
<TE>   Being the sort of hardscrabble baseball guy who lives with a buddy
near Dodger Stadium and has neither cell phone nor fax machine, Pote
is not much for money.</TE>
<TE>   So he started asking around. And everyone turned him down. With
all the worries over police and schools and health care, who wanted
to give money to a game?</TE>
<TE>   He even attended a town meeting once to discuss a proposed tax in
which the residents would pay $12 a year to help defray the costs of
the field.</TE>
<TE>   After being shouted down by one large man, Pote reached into his
wallet and shouted back, "Here, I'll give you 12 bucks to shut up so
I can talk!"</TE>
<TE>   He was finally able to scare up about $50,000 in seed money from
Vons, Universal Studios and the Whittier Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   He was also joined in his quest by Young, the locally based
founder of the nationally successful Reviving Baseball in Inner
Cities (RBI) program.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a lot of kids playing in South Central, but we had no
place to play," Young said.</TE>
<TE>   Then they contacted Gilbert. The wealthy agent now lived far from
his boyhood neighborhoods. Yet they knew he remembered growing up in
south Los Angeles with the likes of Bob Watson, Bobby Tolan and
Reggie Smith.</TE>
<TE>   "I realized, kids weren't coming out of there to play baseball
anymore," Gilbert said. "I wanted them to have the same chances I
had. I realized, a field was the perfect idea."</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, community college officials approved the building of the
field.</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, nearly five years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, good-guy Gilbert has more than tripled his original
investment while fighting through a maze of community college red
tape that included dealing with one construction bidder who wanted
$100,000 to build a bullpen, obviously not knowing that a bullpen is
simply a pitching mound down the foul lines.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy thought a bullpen was a dugout," Gilbert said.</TE>
<TE>   Then, just when it was about to open, the field was shut down for
another year when officials realized that foul balls were landing on
the 105 Freeway. A huge fence down the first-base line was required.
Another huge check was needed.</TE>
<TE>   Said Gilbert: "For a while, I thought this was never going to
happen."</TE>
<TE>   Said Pote: "I started to worry that I wasn't going to live long
enough."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Gilbert found a friend in Warren Furutani, a community
college official who helped him navigate the final miles.</TE>
<TE>   That trip has ended with a field whose use will be shared by RBI
kids and local community colleges ... but whose infield grass is
being cut by parents.</TE>
<TE>   "This is about everybody," Young said.</TE>
<TE>   While some RBI teams began play here last summer, the official
opening was last Sunday, a splendid day featuring a few celebrities
and about 80 VIPs.</TE>
<TE>   Those being, the neighborhood kids. They sat through the
ceremonies, then what did they do?</TE>
<TE>   "What else would they do?" Pote asked.</TE>
<TE>   They played ball.</TE>

<LD>When the Lakers were 16-1, and everyone else considered the task
almost impossible, I still had Phil Jackson in the hot tub with
Jeanie when it came time for the NBA All-Star game on Feb. 10 and
today's deadline to determine who will coach the Western Conference.</LD>
<LD>   I'm not clairvoyant; I've just seen Jeanie.</LD>
<LD>   Now I'm not sure anyone but the very best coach in the NBA could
have pulled off this monumental shift down in the standings to bring
us to this exciting finale today in Philadelphia--of all places.
Winning eight NBA titles with a combination of Michael Jordan,
Scottie Pippen, Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant on your side is
relatively easy in comparison to blowing a 16-1 head start on the
season, and trying to avoid another trip there in two weeks to coach
the Western all-stars.</LD>
<TE>   If Phil is as good as I think he is, one more loss in Philly
today, and he's home free with Jeanie and Dallas' Don Nelson is stuck
in Philly on Feb. 10.</TE>
<TE>   Do you realize the work that has been done to get here--matched
against the likes of Chicago, Memphis, Denver, Miami and Golden
State, and having to lose with Kobe and Shaq on the court?</TE>
<TE>   I wouldn't be surprised to learn that--even when things looked
their bleakest at 16-1--Phil had already made reservations for the
All-Star weekend, knowing very well he would be in his robe and
sandals dining in the Casino Dining Room at Two Bunch Palms in Desert
Hot Springs, where he and Jeanie spent the break a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   What makes Phil the greatest, of course, is you never really see
him at work. I mean, everyone was amazed about the Clippers' victory
over the Lakers and without having Lamar Odom--never realizing that
loss looked as if it might keep Phil home. But then Minnesota's Flip
Saunders pulled a Phil against Toronto on Friday night, and even if
the Clippers wanted to beat Dallas it wouldn't have mattered.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson has to lose one more game to complete the dive. The coach
of the Western Conference team with the best winning percentage as of
today--excluding Sacramento's Rick Adelman, who worked the game last
year--gets duty in Philly.</TE>
<TE>   No one expected Phil to take it to the wire after such a hot
start. And some people probably won't give Phil his due, calling it
merely circumstances: Shaq getting in a tiff with Jackson; Shaq
taking some time off to rest his feet; Shaq getting suspended for
three games; and the Lakers going 13-10 since Phil realized where he
was headed.</TE>
<TE>   But when Phil wants the Lakers to turn it on, they can turn it on,
so it's understandable when he wants them to ratchet it down, they
can do that, too. When the Lakers opened the season playing so well,
Phil made a point of giving guard Lindsey Hunter some of the credit
and told us he noticed Hunter didn't play as well in Milwaukee last
year when he was asked to come off the bench.</TE>
<TE>   After the Lakers fell to 16-2, Phil sent Hunter to the bench and
started Derek Fisher in his place. After what he had to think was a
Two Bunch Palms-clinching loss to the Clippers, however, Phil
reinserted Hunter</TE>
<TE>   into the starting lineup against San Antonio, the Lakers won and
Phil was back in the hot seat.</TE>
<TE>   One more mistake like that--one more win--and Jeanie will be
steaming all right, but not as planned.</TE>
<TE>   Let's be honest, though: Who would you rather have coaching in a
big game than Phil? I'm sure he'll be at his very best.</TE>

<TE>   CREDIT USC Coach Henry Bibby with confusing Stanford on Saturday,
and allowing his Trojans to run off with an impressive comeback
victory.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not sure anyone had a clue what Bibby was doing--the way he
was throwing in seldom-used substitutes such as Gregg Guenther Jr.,
and playing head games with Sam Clancy and Desmon Farmer in the first
half--while falling behind by as many as 13 points. Fortunately Bibby
left freshmen Rory O'Neil and Errick Craven alone, and allowed them
to keep the Trojans close until a relentless full-court press
destroyed Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHAT HAPPENS first? Craven's graduation from USC before a new
basketball arena is open for business? Or Craven's children graduate
from USC before a new basketball arena is open for business?</TE>

<TE>   THERE ARE five finalists vying to become the Angels'

<TE>   BRYANT HASN'T decided if he will accept a three-year,
$54.8-million contract extension on top of the $40.5 million the
Lakers already owe him over the next three years. Forget about trying
to spend all that money, what a wonderful feeling it must be to
hesitate about taking $54.8 million.</TE>

<TE>   EIGHT WORKERS filled two dumpsters and a wheelbarrow with the

<TE>   I believe the appropriate response should be: "We have stupid
fans."</TE>

<TE>   SPORTS ILLUSTRATED'S senior college basketball writer Grant Wahl
put out a list of eight teams he feels have the best chance of
winning the national title. His lists the past two years have

Duke, Georgia, Gonzaga, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland and
UCLA. I'm told Wahl is aware Steve Lavin is still coaching the

<LD>Oklahoma State's Eddie Sutton sounded like a typical coach after the
No. 11 Cowboys defeated visiting Colorado, 64-55, on Saturday at
Stillwater.</LD>
<LD>   "I think the game today was very, very important that we win it,"
Sutton said. "I'm not sure that in the first half that some of our
guys weren't a little tight, because they realized the importance of
winning this ballgame."</LD>
<LD>   The circumstances were anything but typical for his team, which is
dealing with a somber anniversary.</LD>
<TE>   A year ago today, 10 people, including two players and six members
of the program's traveling party, were killed in a plane crash during
a return trip from Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   They were honored with a moment of silence at halftime Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Sutton said he didn't mention the anniversary before the game, but
some of the players did.</TE>
<TE>   "They were very much aware of it," he said. "With all the media
coverage we've had this week and all the articles that have been
written, there's no way that you're not aware of [today] being the
one-year anniversary."</TE>
<TE>   Since the crash, the school has reevaluated its athletic travel
policies.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, school officials announced the team would use a 32-seat
charter jet the rest of the season and no longer would rely on
twin-engine prop planes like the one that crashed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Revenge factor: Before tipoff, Maryland Coach Gary Williams wrote
something on the board in the locker room: REVENGE.</TE>
<TE>   Williams and his players remember the last time they lost at home,
74-71, to Florida State last February.</TE>
<TE>   They remember that after that game the last-place Seminoles pumped
their fists, and Florida State guard Delvon Arrington jumped onto the
scorer's table as the Terrapins left the court to boos from the home
crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Maryland guard Juan Dixon spent several hours alone in the team
weight room that day, pondering the ramifications of the dreadful
loss.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something that happened. I didn't like it," Williams said of
the hostile Cole Field House crowd a year earlier. "It really helped
us, the booing at the end of the game. The players heard it too. We
realized if we were going to turn it around it would have to be us."</TE>
<TE>   Dixon's 25-point, 11-rebound, eight-steal performance Saturday was
the main reason for Maryland's 84-63 victory this time.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really important, considering what happened here last
year," center Lonny Baxter said. "It was still in the back of our
minds today, to come out and take care of business. We don't want to
send a message, we just wanted to win."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Playing percentages: Like a football coach who lost the coin toss,
Arkansas Coach Nolan Richardson went with his defense first and kept
his offense on the bench.</TE>
<TE>   Jannero Pargo sat while Charles Tatum and his teammates set a
frantic pace with three steals in the first 89 seconds. Pargo entered
the game after four minutes and scored a career-high 35 points,
including a three-point basket for the final points of overtime and a
14-foot jumper with 2.7 seconds left in overtime, as Arkansas beat
No. 5 Florida, 94-92, at Fayetteville.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't start him because I wanted to get defense started early
and let him score off the bench, and he did," Richardson said of
Pargo, who had 30 points through regulation.</TE>
<TE>   After trying to use three inside players against Georgia on
Wednesday, Richardson went back to his three-guard lineup and
pressured from one baseline to the other. Florida committed a
season-high 25 turnovers and the Razorbacks scored 28 points off
those mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   "I like to say we need to be like a bunch of dogs with rabies; you
don't want to get too close to us," Richardson said. "That is the way
we have to play to win."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hot Hoosiers: Dane Fife couldn't keep himself from laughing near
the end of Indiana's game against No. 9 Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   He never had seen the Hoosiers shoot so well from the outside in
such a big game, and he had never anticipated such a lopsided victory
over the Illini.</TE>
<TE>   Fife scored 20 points, and the Hoosiers set a school record with
17 three-pointers in an 88-57 victory over the Illini, their worst
loss in more than a decade.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, every time we shot, we were like 'Let's go and get on
back on defense because we know it's going in,'" Fife said. "I was
literally laughing at the end of the game. It was a strange feeling,
but it was an amazing feeling."</TE>
<TE>   The Hoosiers made 63% of their three-pointers, with Fife getting
six, Kyle Hornsby five and Tom Coverdale four.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't been able to do that in the past and that's a credit
to our coaches," Fife said. "They make us shoot the ball. They
believe in us, probably more than we do."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Three for the show: Stanford's Casey Jacobsen made two
three-pointers Saturday against USC, giving him 196 in his career. He
has combined with brothers Adam, who went to Pacific, and Brock, who
went to San Diego, for 599 three-pointers--most by a family in NCAA
history.</TE>
<TE>   The Jacobsen brothers began the game tied with Brendan and Kevin
McCarthy, who combined to make 597 three-pointers while playing at
St. Anselm College and New Hampshire College, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Performance of the day: Morehead State's Ricky Minard caught his
own deflected pass and made a running eight-footer with two seconds
left to lead the Eagles to an 89-88 victory against Tennessee Martin.
Minard finished with 38 points two days after scoring 37 in a victory
against Murray State.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Performance of the weak: Leading 51-46 with 5:16 to play, Duquesne
went scoreless the rest of the way and lost its seventh in a row in a
55-51 defeat to Richmond.</TE>

<HD>Victory a Possession Prize for the Bruins</HD>

<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the topsy-turvy world of UCLA basketball, it's the first Law of
Lavin:</LD>
<LD>   What goes down must come up.</LD>
<LD>   One week after frittering a 20-point second-half lead against
Arizona, two days after a sound beating at the hands of Stanford, 15
minutes after senior Matt Barnes called on his teammates to take
pride in their defense, the Bruins defeated California, 64-57,
Saturday night.</LD>
<TE>   The victory enabled the No. 13 Bruins (14-5, 6-3 in the Pacific 10
Conference) to remain among a cluster of six teams with two or three
losses at the halfway point of the conference schedule. Cal (14-4,
5-3) is another of the four teams with three losses, one fewer than
USC and Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   In the mind of Bruin Coach Steve Lavin, it's all part of a clear
plan. Less convinced are UCLA fans who are at once frustrated and
exhilarated. The 12,275 at Pauley Pavilion watched in bemusement as
the downtrodden players of only two days earlier transformed into
rabid defenders and patient shooters.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have older players and you lose two or three or four or
five, they know what it means in the context of an entire season,"
Lavin said. "What's really important is, are we making progress?</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't mean we are lowering the level of expectations with
the program. But it's important for the players to understand that
teams get beat in college basketball. Just keep improving, so by
tournament time, we'll have a chance."</TE>
<TE>   This effort was a definite improvement. The Bears were unable to
beat the Bruins off the dribble--as Stanford had done--and were
unable to make three-point shots, as Arizona had done.</TE>
<TE>   In an overtime victory over USC on Thursday, Cal made a
school-record 15 three-pointers. They made five of 25 against the
Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   "Are we bad shooters or do we take ill-advised shots? That's the
age-old question," Cal Coach Ben Braun said. "We were trying to win
the game from the perimeter."</TE>
<TE>   All those long shots kept Dan Gadzuric out of foul trouble, which
might have been the longest shot of all. The UCLA center fouled out
of three of the previous four games, but he played 34 minutes and had
no fouls for the first 31:24.</TE>
<TE>   He also scored 13 points on five-of-eight shooting and helped UCLA
to a 33-29 rebounding advantage by grabbing 11.</TE>
<TE>   Cal wanted to work the ball inside and get Gadzuric to leave his
feet and contest shots, but the Bruin defenders on the perimeter were
more active than usual and the Bears settled for long-range jump
shots, many of which missed wildly. Cal shot 37% and made a
season-low 20 field goals.</TE>
<TE>   "We totally went away from our game plan," said Bear center Jamal
Sampson, who took only three shots and made them all. "We just kept
shooting from outside."</TE>
<TE>   Offensively, UCLA shared the ball and didn't rush shots. Jason
Kapono scored 17 points, Billy Knight had 16 and Barnes added 11.
Point guard Cedric Bozeman had five points and five assists.</TE>
<TE>   The starters each played at least 33 minutes and Lavin departed
from his usual 10-player rotation. Rico Hines, who played five
minutes after missing three games with a concussion, T.J. Cummings
and Ryan Walcott were scoreless, freshman Dijon Thompson scored the
only two points by a reserve and freshman forward Andre Patterson did
not leave the bench.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a slower game of few possessions, a conference grinder
game, and we didn't need the bench as much," Lavin said.</TE>
<TE>   Especially with Gadzuric playing intelligently. When he was called
for his first foul with 8:26 to play and UCLA ahead, 50-46, the crowd
applauded appreciatively. The Bruins were in the midst of a stifling
defensive stretch where Cal scored only on three free throws in nine
possessions.</TE>
<TE>   A three-point basket by Joe Shipp got Cal within 52-50 with 3:15
to play, but UCLA stayed poised. Knight and Kapono each scored late
in the shot clock for a six-point lead with 1:47 left. The Bruins
weren't threatened again.</TE>
<TE>   "We were getting everyone touches and working for shots," Barnes
said. "That's something we didn't do against Stanford."</TE>
<TE>   Barnes took the team to task before the game, and the topic was
defense. He reminded everyone of the lapses against Stanford, the
easy penetration the Bruins allowed and the foolish fouls by Gadzuric
that resulted.</TE>
<TE>   "I said to take pride in locking up your man, working through
screens and not relying on so many switches," he said. "Then we went
out and did it. This was a game we needed to win."</TE>

<DH>College basketball: Change in strategy turns the tide in
90-82 victory over Stanford, as Trojans stay tied for first.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Having been dragged through the muck and mire that is Stanford's
systematic and methodical style of play for 20 minutes, USC decided
to try something different in the second half.</LD>
<LD>   The Trojans played hard. The Trojans employed a devastating
full-court press. And the Trojans won.</LD>
<LD>   No. 23 USC used its press to create Cardinal turnovers, generate
steals and pull out a 90-82 victory over 17th-ranked Stanford on
Saturday afternoon.</LD>
<TE>   Before a Sports Arena crowd of 9,342, the Trojans improved to 15-4
overall, 7-2 in Pacific 10 Conference play, and remained in a
first-place tie with Oregon, which had earlier beaten Washington
State.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford fell to 12-5, 5-3.</TE>
<TE>   Down by as many as 13 points in the first half, the Trojans began
pressing and were down by seven at halftime, 37-30.</TE>
<TE>   USC attacked the Cardinal throughout the second half and finished
with 16 steals, 11 after the half. Stanford, without a true point
guard, committed 27 turnovers, 14 in the second half. USC scored 31
points off the turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans, coming off their heartbreaking loss to California on
Thursday, committed 10 turnovers and were victim to only two Cardinal
steals</TE>
<TE>   "We really jumped on them with the full-court press," said USC
power forward Sam Clancy, who had a game-high 24 points and 13
rebounds for his fifth consecutive double-double. Clancy also had
four steals and an assist in 37 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "In the second half, we speeded the game up ... to our speed."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the Trojans, who prefer to run and gun rather than run
half-court sets, outscored the Cardinal in fastbreak points, 16-4,
and overall in the second half, 60-45.</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Henry Bibby lambasted the Trojans in the locker room at
the break, imploring them to play harder and increase the tempo of
the game.</TE>
<TE>   He got it in the inspired play of freshman guard Errick Craven and
freshman center Rory O'Neil.</TE>
<TE>   Both fouled out, but Craven broke out of his mini-slump with 18
points, 10 in the second half, and five steals, and O'Neil, who
almost chose to attend Stanford over USC, finished with a career-high
14 points, eight after intermission, two blocks and a steal.</TE>
<TE>   "They're a very conventional team," Bibby said of Stanford. "We
thought that [pressing] might cause them some problems.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think we would rattle them to the degree we did. I
thought we should speed them up and disrupt them because they're not
as experienced [as in previous years]."</TE>
<TE>   Stanford was playing without 7-foot center Curtis Borchardt, the
Pac-10's leading rebounder, who was out because of an abdominal
strain suffered Thursday against UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   His presence might not have mattered, though, with the voracity of
USC's second-half defense.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't do a very good job of handling the pressure," Stanford
Coach Mike Montgomery said. "We were too casual with the ball and no
one did what they were supposed to do.</TE>
<TE>   "We had 27 turnovers and they scored 31 points off of them. I
think that's all that really needs to be said. We had a fundamental
breakdown. We had not seen a lot of press until now."</TE>
<TE>   Casey Jacobsen led Stanford with 21 points, 16 in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   USC opened the game in a 2-3 zone and Stanford's long-range
gunners took advantage, bombing away from beyond the three-point
stripe as four of their first eight field goals were three-pointers.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans struggled with their half-court offense while Stanford
was extremely active on defense, building a 35-22 lead with 2:52
remaining in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   That's when USC finally showed a spark of life, closing out the
half with an 8-2 spurt to get within seven, 37-30.</TE>
<TE>   USC opened the second half with a 14-6 run to gain the lead at
44-43, their first advantage since it was 8-6.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford answered, though, and the Cardinal led by one, 65-64,
after two Joe Kirchofer free throws with 7:41 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   It was the last time Stanford would lead.</TE>
<TE>   After Craven made a three-pointer from the left wing to put USC up
by eight, 80-72, with 63 seconds to play, Stanford was forced to
foul.</TE>
<TE>   USC senior point guard Brandon Granville, who picked up his fourth
foul with 15:19 to play, returned to the game with 45 seconds
remaining, and he converted all eight of his free throws in the
game's waning moments to seal the victory.</TE>
<TE>   "I just had to knock them down," said Granville, who has made 32
consecutive free throws. "That's the only reason [Bibby] put me in
the game. You've got to make your free throws."</TE>
<TE>   Make your free throws and play a full-court press, with passion.</TE>

<LD>Thursday at Oregon State, 7 p.m.--The No. 23 Trojans (15-4, 7-2 in
Pacific 10 Conference) will be looking for a little payback against
the Beavers (10-9, 3-6), having dropped a 67-52 decision at Corvallis
the last time they met. USC, which has won four of the past five
against Oregon State, leads the all-time series, 54-51.</LD>

<HD>Deep Budget Cuts Finally Hit Irvine Schools Hard</HD>
<DH>Education: A shortfall of more than $5 million means
program cuts, larger class sizes and closure of a campus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI and JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For years families have moved to Irvine for its planned communities
with their new homes, nearby parks and tranquil streets.</LD>
<LD>   They also came for some of the best public schools in the state.</LD>
<LD>   Now the local school district is projecting a budget shortfall of
more than $5 million next year, with resulting cuts in such vaunted
programs as science and arts, the closure of a neighborhood school
and class sizes that will grow by 50% in some grades.</LD>
<TE>   Some families say the community is losing its luster.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it might get me to move out of Irvine," said Tracy Buck,
whose twins attend Los Naranjos Elementary School. The campus is
slated for closure this summer.</TE>
<TE>   "We used to be a special district," lamented teacher Susan Gross,
who introduces elementary-school pupils to art at several district
campuses. "Now, we are a mediocre district."</TE>
<TE>   A mass exodus from the district is unlikely, but Buck's sentiment
underscores how much Irvine's schools have been a draw for young
families.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had homeowners who are concerned about it," said Dale
Cheema, an Irvine Realtor and district parent. "I don't feel as
comfortable with the school district as I used to."</TE>
<TE>   Many in the district wonder why Irvine schools seem to be
suffering more than surrounding districts.</TE>
<TE>   In some ways their question is on target; in other ways not.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine schools start from a richer base than most. While the
district stands to lose most of its science, music and art enrichment
programs at elementary schools, many school districts eliminated such
costly items years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Other districts also feel the pinch. Neighboring Saddleback Valley
Unified School District recently decided on more than $8 million in
cuts, slashing arts and other specialized programs. The Capistrano
Unified School District might also need to look at enlarging class
sizes in at least one primary grade.</TE>
<TE>   But so far, the pain runs especially deep for Irvine schools.</TE>
<TE>   The district plans to eliminate 20-pupil classes in kindergarten,
second and third grades, keeping the smaller classes only in first
grade. At the same time, it is eliminating more than 80% of its
specialized programs, such as science, music and fine arts at
elementary schools.</TE>
<TE>   The cuts are the result of a one-two financial punch, both caused
by the economy. While the district's costs have increased, the state
is cutting education spending. The state forecasts a $12-billion
shortfall next year. About $843 million in cuts will come from the
education budget, Gov. Gray Davis announced last November.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the private sources that have kept some of the
extra programs going--long after many other districts eliminated
them--are expected to provide less money this year.</TE>
<TE>   In a way, the district is a victim of its own good fortune. For
years, private money from its fund-raising arm and the Donald Bren
Foundation kept in place programs few other districts could afford.</TE>
<TE>   Being weaned from the private dollars will be hard, district
officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "You try to do as much as possible at the local level," said
Vernon Medeiros, the district's financial officer, "but you get to
the point you can't do that anymore. My frustration is that we keep
getting underfunded [at the government level]."</TE>
<TE>   The classes were largely funded through the Irvine Public Schools
Foundation, a group of parents who raised money for the programs.</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine Co. through the Donald Bren Foundation has pledged to
match contributions for the next five years, up to $700,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the foundation donated $2.2 million to the district.
For next year, district officials predict, the amount will dwindle to
about $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   "We are grateful for what we've had," Medeiros said. "But [donors]
are getting caught with the same economic difficulties we are caught
on."</TE>
<TE>   The decrease in private donations represents about a fifth of the
budget deficit forecast for the district.</TE>
<TE>   But Irvine also must contend with state funding lower than what
most districts receive. The district gets $4,574 for each of its
24,000 students for basic programs. That's about $100 per student
less than the state average.</TE>
<TE>   The formula for per-student funding is based on how local property
taxes were assessed before Proposition 13, the 1978 tax-cutting
measure. The formula hurts districts like Irvine and others in South
Orange County which have grown and seen property values rise mostly
after Proposition 13.</TE>
<TE>   Add to that rising health care costs and the growing list of
mandated programs such as special education not fully funded by the
state, and expenses quickly outstrip revenue, Medeiros said.</TE>
<TE>   James A. Fleming, superintendent of nearby Capistrano Unified
School District, another high-performing district, said similar woes
forced his district to cut $4 million from this year's budget. The
district gets about $87 less per student than the state average and
does not receive the private funding Irvine does.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature last year approved a bill providing more money
next year to districts such as Irvine and Capistrano to make up some
of the difference in funding. Davis suggested cutting the money, but
a legislative subcommittee has proposed reinstating the funding of
about $40 million.</TE>
<TE>   Fleming and Medeiros complain that their districts are at a
disadvantage because they are already funded at a lower level for
even the basic programs.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got very few places to go," Fleming said. "You have to cut
to the marrow."</TE>
<TE>   Many Irvine parents have said they also believe the district had
no choice but to make the cuts.</TE>
<TE>   ''Everyone is just very sad for the loss,'' said Jeff Herdman,
principal of El Camino Real Elementary School. ''They're
disappointed, but they understand.''</TE>

<LD>Suggestion to Wally Wade:</LD>
<LD>   Pack it up. It's all over. Thanks for playing our game and please
drive home safely.</LD>
<LD>   For a while there, it looked like things were going Wade's way in
his rematch with Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas. Wade, a deputy district
attorney trying to unseat his boss, has racked up some meaty
endorsements, and Rackauckas appeared wobbly.</LD>
<TE>   Then came Saturday's photo op on the sidewalk outside the D.A.'s
office, which may have left Wade rethinking this endorsement thing.</TE>
<TE>   There was DeWayne McKinney making what I think is safe to call the
first political endorsement of his life.</TE>
<TE>   Wondering who McKinney is? A local police chief, perhaps? A
retired judge? The head of an important civic organization?</TE>
<TE>   Not exactly.</TE>
<TE>   McKinney is the poor guy who, until he was released in January
2000, spent 19 years behind bars for a 1980 Orange County murder he
almost certainly didn't commit.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor who put him behind bars: Mr. Rackauckas.</TE>
<TE>   So, naturally, McKinney is endorsing Wade.</TE>
<TE>   Or so you might think.</TE>
<TE>   Nope, McKinney, 41, is telling anyone who cares that the man he
supports for district attorney is none other than Tony Rackauckas.
You couldn't blame Rackauckas for wondering now if he can get every
single vote in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Let's put it this way: if you can get an endorsement from a man
you wrongly prosecuted for murder and for whom you sought the death
penalty and who lost 19 years of freedom ... who can't you get one
from?</TE>
<TE>   This is like Evander Holyfield testifying as a character witness
for Mike Tyson: "Yes, Mr. Tyson took two bites out of my ear during
one of our fights, but I believe him to be a fine gentleman."</TE>
<TE>   So it was, on Saturday, as McKinney repeatedly shook Rackauckas'
hand and lauded him for being the man who righted a wrong. Similar
kind words came from McKinney's wife of nearly a year, Jeanine.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas wasn't exactly trumpeting the moment, seemingly more
intent on praising McKinney for the way he's handled the whole thing.</TE>
<TE>   Not Exactly</TE>
<TE>   D.A.'s Brainstorm</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't the time to rain on anyone's parade.</TE>
<TE>   But if I follow McKinney's logic, he's giving Rackauckas the
credit for getting him out of prison. While that is technically
true--the D.A.'s office did ask a judge to release McKinney after its
investigation cast doubt on his guilt--it's not as though the case
had haunted Rackauckas over the years.</TE>
<TE>   The truth is, McKinney would have languished in prison for the
rest of his life--his sentence didn't provide for parole--had not the
Orange County public defender's office begun a new investigation in
1997. That investigation resulted from a letter the office received
from the man who drove the getaway car the night McKinney supposedly
shot and killed a Burger King employee during the robbery in Orange.
The getaway driver, who was in prison, identified another inmate as
the Burger King killer.</TE>
<TE>   With the public defender pressing for a new trial, Rackauckas
assigned investigators to take another look at the case. It's not
cynical to say that likely was done so his office would know whether
to oppose any motion for a new trial, but the investigators informed
Rackauckas that the case against McKinney looked weak.</TE>
<TE>   To his credit, Rackauckas accepted their findings and asked for
McKinney's quick release.</TE>
<TE>   Now, one could reasonably ask whether Rackauckas wanted to dispose
of the case because any new trial would shine a light on his handling
of McKinney's 1982 trial.</TE>
<TE>   McKinney apparently has asked and answered that question to his
satisfaction. He's a Rackauckas man, and who among us should tell him
otherwise?</TE>
<TE>   With the March 5 election fast approaching, maybe the two new pals
could hit the campaign trail together. Imagine the yuks they'd
generate at a joint appearance.</TE>
<TE>   "DeWayne, it's a good thing I didn't do a better job of convincing
the jury to have you executed," Rackauckas could say, extending a
love tap toward McKinney's jaw. "If I had, you wouldn't be here
today."</TE>
<TE>   "Don't you think I know that?" McKinney could reply. "Why do you
think I'm endorsing you?"</TE>

Bledsoe. You rallied the Patriots from a 10-point deficit in the
fourth quarter against the Oakland Raiders to win your first playoff
game. You're in the AFC championship game.</LD>
<LD>   Now let's see how you do against the No. 1 defense in the NFL.</LD>
<LD>   Pittsburgh gave up only 258.6 yards per game, and held the
Baltimore Ravens to 150 yards last week. The Steelers are also the
only team to operate out of a 3-4 defense, making preparation a
little different.</LD>
<TE>   "I've faced a lot of good defenses," Brady said. "Miami's defense
is pretty good, the Jets' defense is pretty good, Oakland was pretty
good. Throughout the course of the year, you see a lot of different
looks."</TE>
<TE>   The Steelers "do a good job of disguising where their pressures
are coming from. At some point, they have got to rotate safeties, or
they have got to show you certain looks. That's the key, to identify
where their fifth rusher is coming in."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Inside linebacker Earl Holmes, the Steelers' leading tackler, is
listed as questionable; he has missed practices this week because of
a sprained left knee. John Fiala will start and Mike Jones will play
in third-down passing situations if Holmes can't play. Coach Bill
Cowher said he will make a final decision at game time.</TE>
<TE>   Holmes hurt the knee when a teammate jumped into his arms to
celebrate a fumble recovery against Baltimore in the divisional
playoff.</TE>
<TE>   Running back Jerome Bettis missed the Baltimore game when a
painkiller shot he took for his groin injury made his leg numb.</TE>
<TE>   "He will take no shots [today]," Cowher said. "And he will start
and we will go from there."</TE>
<TE>   Patriot running back Antowain Smith missed practice Thursday to
rest his injured right leg, but New England Coach Bill Belichick said
"he'll be out there [today]."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Patriot safety Lawyer Milloy finds disrespect everywhere. Even in
the NFL playoff commercials, which don't feature any Patriots.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, they have guys in there talking about the playoff
experience and the atmosphere, guys that have never even played in
the playoffs before," Milloy said. "That's crazy to me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Not too surprisingly, Pittsburgh Penguin star/owner Mario Lemieux
likes the Steelers in today's game.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, they're playing great," Lemieux said. "Their defense
has been incredible throughout the year. Hopefully Jerome can come
back and give them a little boost. But they're looking good. Kordell
[Stewart is] playing well. I'm looking forward to [today]'s game."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Today will mark the eighth time since 1970 that the Pittsburgh
Steelers have hosted a conference championship game, which ties them
with San Francisco for the most in the NFL in that span. Following is
a list of the teams that have hosted the most AFC or NFC championship
games:</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh...8</TE>

<HD>Oliver Gives Loyola a Twist</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A sellout crowd of more than 1,200 jammed into Loyola High's gym
Saturday night in anticipation of the duel between two of the best
young basketball guards in Southern California--junior Omar Wilkes of
Los Angeles Loyola and sophomore Bryce Taylor of North Hollywood
Harvard-Westlake.</LD>
<LD>   Little did anyone suspect that another sophomore guard, Vince
Oliver of Loyola, would play a decisive role, scoring 20 points to
help the Cubs take over first place in the Mission League with a
73-55 victory.</LD>
<LD>   Loyola (17-3, 6-1), ranked No. 18 by The Times, opened a 10-point
halftime lead behind Oliver, who came off the bench to make five of
six shots and score 13 points, including a three-point basket, just
before halftime.</LD>
<TE>   No. 24 Harvard-Westlake (18-4, 6-2) never got closer than six
points in the second half. Loyola's man-to-man defense challenged the
Wolverines to beat them with anyone but Taylor. Taylor scored 23
points, making eight of 23 shots. The Wolverines had long stretches
when no one other than Taylor scored. Harris Chung was the only other
threat with 13 points.</TE>
<TE>   "Bryce is such a good player you have to hope he had an off night
shooting," Loyola Coach Jim Williamson said.</TE>
<TE>   Loyola had better balance on offense, with Wilkes contributing 19
points and Josh Flynn-Brown scoring 12. But this was a game in which
the 6-foot-1 Oliver got his opportunity to show how talented he is in
front of assistant coaches from Stanford and USC.</TE>
<TE>   He played junior varsity last season because Williamson wanted to
bring him along slowly.</TE>
<TE>   "He was only a freshman [last year] and I feel it's important for
young guards to develop and learn the game," Williamson said. "It's a
four-year process, and there's no rushing him. He's made a nice
impact for our team coming off the bench."</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks ago, Harvard-Westlake defeated the Cubs, 94-87. But
this time, it was Loyola making the extra pass to get players open,
setting stronger screens and diving for more loose balls.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been working on defense ever since the last time we played
them," Oliver said. "We felt it was one of our weaknesses."</TE>
<TE>   Eric Sondheimer</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo Capistrano Valley 58, San Clemente 44--Pete Decasas
scored 19 points and Matt Sweany had 18 as the No. 21 Cougars,
improved to 19-5, 6-1 with the South Coast League victory at home.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore Marcus Blackshire had 15 points for the Tritons.</TE>
<TE>   West Hills Chaminade 69, Sherman Oaks Notre Dame 57--Marcus
Everett, Adrian Aye-Darko, Kevin Hiraiwa and Jerred Link each scored
12 points for Chaminade (17-5, 6-2) in a Mission League victory at
Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   BeeWee Valleseron scored 16 points for Notre Dame (7-15, 3-5).</TE>

<HD>Ducks Are Taking Flight</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Scrappy goals by Bylsma and Cullen help them beat
Nashville, 3-1, for their third consecutive victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NASHVILLE</DL>
<LD>The Mighty Ducks were smiling two nights in a row.</LD>
<LD>   Dan Bylsma, flat on his stomach, managed to put the puck in the
back of the net.</LD>
<LD>   Matt Cullen, teetering backward, slid a shot that found its way
in.</LD>
<TE>   Mike Leclerc, on the fly, provided the coup de grace tapping in a
goal off a Paul Kariya-type pass from Paul Kariya.</TE>
<TE>   These were moments, rare much of the season, that lifted the Ducks
to a 3-1 victory over the Nashville Predators in front of 15,537 at
the Gaylord Entertainment Center on Saturday. The Ducks matched their
season high with three consecutive victories.</TE>
<TE>   Kariya and Leclerc hooked up on an end-to-end run, Kariya waiting
until the last moment to slip a pass to a wide-open Leclerc, who had
an even wider open net.</TE>
<TE>   A pretty goal worth watching over and over. But it was the ugly
Duck goals, by Bylsma and Cullen, that put things in motion.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are better than the tic-tac-toe goals," Cullen said. "You
feel like you're in those. You work hard, you made something happen
and the puck finds a way in. It feels really good to get those in,
before there was no question they were going to be stopped or hit the
post."</TE>
<TE>   This was the Ducks' second victory since word leaked that General
Manager Pierre Gauthier had been shopping a group of 10 players, at
least six with the team, around the league. That news hit the
dressing room like a boulder.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks took any unhappiness out on opponents. They manhandled a
dysfunctional Dallas team, 6-1, Friday. They then outworked Nashville
on Saturday, getting victories in successive nights for the first
time this season.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously it really opens eyes," Cullen said. "You realize things
are going to change at some point and things have to change when they
are not going well like this year. It makes you focus on getting your
game in order and you want to make sure you're doing all you can to
help the team win."</TE>
<TE>   Bylsma and Cullen did.</TE>
<TE>   Denny Lambert drove to the net, lost the puck, and collided into
Bylsma. Both were flat on the ice, but Bylsma pushed the puck out
with his hand, then swung his stick and managed to slide a shot past
goalie Mike Dunham, who was also face down.</TE>
<TE>   Bylsma has seven goals and 14 points this season, both career
highs.</TE>
<TE>   "When you find yourself on your stomach it's pretty hard to score
unless you push it out," Bylsma said. "All I was really doing was
pushing it out so I could take whack at it. This was more a Dan
Bylsma goal than a real goal."</TE>
<TE>   It counted just the same, tying the score, 1-1, with 1 minute 47
seconds left in the first period.</TE>
<TE>   Cullen gave the Ducks the lead early in the second period, with
considerable help from his linemates. Marty McInnis went behind the
net and centered a pass. German Titov put the puck toward the net and
Cullen, while being shoved back, tapped a roller under Dunham's legs
for a 2-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are things we weren't able to capitalize on before," Coach
Bryan Murray said. "We never seemed to get the goals from the scrums
around the net or the battles at the crease. Tonight, we got two of
them."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the Ducks have had one-goal leads beforeplenty of them.
They are also 12 games under .500. Do the math.</TE>
<TE>   This time, though, the Ducks were able to smother an opponent.
Goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere saw only 19 shots and had to make only
a few desperate saves. Kariya and Leclerc settled matters with six
minutes left.</TE>

<HD>Titov Is Producing on the Third Line</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NASHVILLE</DL>
<LD>Left wing German Titov may never be the 60-point scorer General
Manager Pierre Gauthier said he was when he gave him a three-year,
$4.6-million contract before the 2000-01 season. But what Titov has
been over the last few weeks is a productive third-line player.</LD>
<LD>   Titov has skated hard, forechecked and even produced or helped
produce a few goals skating with Matt Cullen and Marty McInnis. He
assisted on Cullen's second-period goal in a 3-1 victory over
Nashville on Saturday, giving him a four-game point streak for the
first time in his brief Duck career.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, he created a turnover in the corner and backhanded a
pass to Mike Leclerc for a goal against the Kings. On Wednesday, he
broke a 1-1 tie with Minnesota by charging the net and scoring.
Friday, he again went to the net and poked in a rebound against
Dallas.</LD>
<TE>   "I feel good right now," Titov said. "It has not been easy. I have
tried to forget about last season and just play hockey."</TE>
<TE>   Titov's life was ripped apart last season, when his father and
brother died in apparent suicides a few months apart. Titov, who was
expected to center the Ducks' second line, finished with nine goals
and 20 points, both career lows.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nashville's Petr Tenkrat, acquired from the Ducks earlier this
season, had his goal-less streak extended to seven games.</TE>
<TE>   He hasn't had a goal since scoring the game-winner against the
Ducks on Jan. 12.</TE>

<LD>Perseverance paid off Saturday for Chino Hills Ayala in its Ayala
Extravaganza. The Bulldogs could have given up against Fullerton Troy
after falling behind by 11 points to the team ranked No. 4 by The
Times.</LD>
<LD>   But Ayala didn't quit and the 19th-ranked Bulldogs scored a 58-55
victory over Troy in the final nonleague game before the playoffs
begin.</LD>
<LD>   "We were down a couple of times and it looked hopeless," said
Ayala Coach Mel Sims, whose team fell behind, 26-15, in the second
quarter. "At this time of year, a win like this is critical."</LD>
<TE>   It should give Ayala (19-4) an idea of where it stands for the
playoffs. For Troy (18-2), it's the Warriors' second loss this week
after falling Monday to No. 3 San Clemente.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't make free throws and rebound, we deserve to lose,"
Troy Coach Kevin Kiernan said. "We won't beat any good teams right
now. We're very soft."</TE>
<TE>   Ayala held a 32-28 rebounding advantage. They also made 18 of 35
(51.4%) from the field. Troy, which held a 43-38 lead after three
quarters, had its chances but made only four of 11 free throws in the
fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Alicia Komaki led Troy with 14 points, Nicole Hayman had 12 and
Amanda Livingston 10.</TE>
<TE>   But it was the play of Chandi Gilling that put Ayala over the top.
Averaging eight points, Gilling scored 14, making seven of nine from
the field, and was the perfect complement to the inside play of Kia
Riley (18 points) and outside play of Brittany Sieger (12).</TE>
<TE>   Artesia 70, Pasadena Muir 62--In a rematch of last season's
Division II-A final and a showdown between two of the best post
players in the Southland, No. 6 Artesia used guard play to yield the
same result.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee-bound 6-foot-4 Tye'sha Fluker of No. 18 Muir (18-4) won
the personal battle with 23 points and 12 rebounds. Lauren Ervin, a
6-3 junior, had 15 points and six rebounds for Artesia (15-5).</TE>
<TE>   Artesia's Christian Jackson scored 18 to lead Artesia. Brittany
Thomas had 13, and Lindsay Thomas and Brittany Imaku scored 10
apiece.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Henderson</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brea Olinda 47, Santa Ana Mater Dei 36--Carrie Noyes had 16 points
and 11 rebounds, seven offensive, to lead No. 8 Brea in a nonleague
victory at Mater Dei.</TE>
<TE>   The 23rd-ranked Monarchs (19-4) rallied from a 21-15 halftime
deficit to close to within two with 3:16 left in the third quarter.
Mater Dei held Brea Olinda to five second-quarter points.</TE>
<TE>   The LadyCats' defense took over late in the third, and Brea Olinda
(14-6) ended the quarter on a 9-4 run when Lauren Pederson scored
seven of her nine points.</TE>
<TE>   Mater Dei's Amy Sanders, who leads the Monarchs with 15 points a
game, was held to six points. The LadyCats also forced 16 turnovers.
Jessica Williams led Mater Dei with 11 points and Ashley Voisnet
added six.</TE>
<TE>   Melanie Neff</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Harbor City Narbonne 48, Ventura Buena 35--The No. 2 Gauchos were
in danger of losing their first home game since 1996 before
outscoring No. 16 Buena, 19-4, during the last five minutes of an
intersectional game.</TE>
<TE>   Wilnett Crockett and Lisa Willis each had six points during the
run for Narbonne, which overcame a dismal performance, making 18 of
63 shots, 10 of 28 free throws and committing 20 turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   The Gauchos (17-3) rotated several players on Courtney LaVere,
Buena's 6-3 center who is bound for Notre Dame. LaVere made two of 18
shots and finished with 13 points, 10 rebounds, four blocked shots
and three steals.</TE>
<TE>   Amy Glassman added 10 points for Buena (13-7), the state's
winningest program, which had never lost seven games in a season.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a day of swift changes in the lead and more wild cheers for John
Daly, Duffy Waldorf made birdie on two of the last four holes
Saturday for a four-under-par 67 that gave him a one-stroke lead in
the Phoenix Open at Scottsdale, Ariz.</LD>
<LD>   Getting up-and-down for birdie from about 140 feet on No. 17 gave
Waldorf some breathing room, but not much.</LD>
<LD>   He was at 16-under 197, one stroke ahead of Kenny Perry and Chris
DiMarco, with Daly another stroke back and others still in the hunt.</LD>
<TE>   Among those missing was Ty Tryon, but that was no surprise. The
17-year-old played three holes in the morning to finish his second
round and missed the cut by seven shots. He had a 71 to finish at six
over.</TE>
<TE>   The massive, raucous gallery that drinks, cheers and occasionally
watches golf doesn't need much to get excited. Having Daly in the
hunt really fired them up.</TE>
<TE>   Winless on the PGA Tour since his victory in the British Open at
St. Andrews in 1995, Daly hit his drive 379 yards on the final hole
and spun a sand wedge four feet away to finish only two strokes out
of the lead.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be down to the wire," Daly said.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone will be chasing Waldorf, who took the lead with an
approach on the 470-yard eighth hole that grazed the cup and stopped
within tap-in distance for a birdie.</TE>
<TE>   Perry, who finished one stroke out of the playoff in the
season-opening Mercedes Championships, had a 64 for the best round of
the day and a date in the final group with Waldorf.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hale Irwin birdied the final hole and won the last 11 skins and a
record $450,000 to win the Senior Skins Game at Wailea, Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   He made a five-foot putt on the 18th for $260,000 to win the event
at Wailea Golf Club's Gold Course for the third time.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Nicklaus, who has been battling nagging back problems and has
not played tournament golf since the British Open in July, collected
the first seven skins for $150,000 and second place.</TE>
<TE>   Arnold Palmer and senior rookie Fuzzy Zoeller finished with no
skins.</TE>
<TE>   Irwin's winning total bettered the mark set by Raymond Floyd in
1995 of $420,000.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Open champion Retief Goosen led by 13 strokes entering the
final round of the Johnnie Walker Classic at Perth, Australia, after

<HD>Leiweke Says His Faith in Team Never Wavered</HD>

<LD>In late November, when the Kings were struggling to stay out of the
Western Conference basement, the reports flew out of Toronto, where
no hockey rumor is too silly to go unpublished.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings were on the verge of unloading Coach Andy Murray,
according to one. Another said they were considering cleaning house
in their hockey operation, presumably starting at the top with
General Manager Dave Taylor.</LD>
<LD>   "None of it was true," club President Tim Leiweke said.</LD>
<TE>   Leiweke said that he and Taylor never lost faith in the team, even
as it stumbled out of the gate amid great expectations, falling six
games below .500.</TE>
<TE>   Those outside the organization, he said, never understood the
impact on the team of the deaths of scouts Mark Bavis and Ace Bailey
in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Also, a slew of early season injuries and the Oct. 24 trade that
brought center Jason Allison from the Boston Bruins impacted the
team.</TE>
<TE>   "Those three combined, we struggled to find our chemistry and our
confidence during the first part of the season," Leiweke said. "But
we never looked at purging the organization, we didn't look at doing
anything with the coach, we didn't look at dismantling the team and
rebuilding.</TE>
<TE>   "We had great faith in the core. We had an unbelievable
development system coming up. So I think we're in a good place. We
weren't going to panic."</TE>
<TE>   The resurgent Kings have lost only five of their last 23 games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Said former King defenseman Rob Blake, who was again booed
throughout the game: "It's not very much fun at all.... I have a lot
of great memories here. They are the best memories in the world. By
them booing, it isn't going to bother any of the memories I have
here."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lubomir Visnovsky, benched for four games in the first month of
the season because of lackluster play, was scratched Saturday for the
first time since Nov. 1. Murray indicated last week that the move was
coming, saying of the Slovak defenseman: "I had a little talk to him
about raising the level of his play." ... Craig Johnson, who suffered
a cut on his right eye last Monday, sat out for the second
consecutive game but is expected to play Monday night when the Kings
and Avalanche play again, this time at Denver.</TE>

<LD>Jason Bent's goal in the seventh round of penalty kicks gave
defending champion Canada a victory over Martinique in the
quarterfinals of the Gold Cup on Saturday night at Miami's Orange
Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   Canada advanced to Wednesday night's semifinals at the Rose Bowl
against the winner of today's game between the United States and El

<LD>   Canada beat Martinique, 6-5, in a shootout, after the teams tied,
1-1, in regulation.</LD>
<TE>   After falling behind, 1-0, on an own goal midway through the
second half, Canada's Kevin McKenna tied the score in the 73rd minute
with his third goal of the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Martinique had a 4-3 lead in penalties and only needed Fabrice
Reuperne's conversion on the fifth attempt to secure the match, but
his shot sailed over the crossbar.</TE>
<TE>   Both teams converted in the sixth round, but Pascal Lina hit the

game-winner.</TE>

<DH>NFC: Banged-up Ram quarterback needs to be on target, not
become one, in championship game against Eagles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE PUCIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>St. Louis Ram quarterback and NFL most valuable player Kurt Warner
has sore ribs. He needs extra padding added to his flak jacket. He
might need a pain-killing shot before today's NFC championship game
between the Rams and the Philadelphia Eagles.</LD>
<LD>   Eagle defensive end Hugh Douglas owes the NFL $35,000 and would be
wise to route his flights away from Chicago O'Hare airport after his
big hit knocked Bear quarterback Jim Miller out of last Sunday's NFC
playoff game at Soldier Field. Douglas says his hit was legal.
Douglas says Miller moved and was fair game.</LD>
<LD>   No, Douglas says, he will not be seeking out Warner. Unless Warner
moves.</LD>
<TE>   This game will be played at the newly named Edward Jones Dome
(which was, until Friday, the Dome at America's Center and which used
to be TWA Dome). And Edward Jones isn't a who, it is a financial
firm.</TE>
<TE>   The Rams (15-2) won the Super Bowl two years ago. The Eagles
(13-5) haven't gone to the Super Bowl since 1981 and have never won
it. Another Super Bowl trip is up for grabs today.</TE>
<TE>   So, quick. Who is the Rams' backup quarterback?</TE>
<TE>   His name is Jamie Martin. His college career took place at Weber
State. He has been in the league seven years. He has been with the
Rams four years. He is 32 and is from Arroyo Grande, Calif. He has
one NFL start to his credit. He probably won't matter. Martin
probably won't play. Douglas probably won't take a shot at Warner's
bruised ribs. Will he?</TE>
<TE>   "Warner vulnerable? I don't see him as being a real vulnerable
guy," Douglas says. "He's a big guy and he moves well for a big guy.
It's going to be hard to get around him. But I brung a big lunch,
people. I am going to be there all day.</TE>
<TE>   "Put it like this. If Kurt is in the vicinity, Kurt is going to
get hit. But I am not going to go out of my way looking for Kurt
Warner. Whoever is around, they are going to get hit."</TE>
<TE>   So Warner might get hit. Martin might play.</TE>
<TE>   And if he does? The Rams have the second-best player in the
league. They have Marshall Faulk, who rushed for 1,382 yards this
season and who finished second to Warner in the MVP voting. Faulk is
more than a tailback. He is a fine blocker, a reliable receiver, a
respected leader.</TE>
<TE>   Martin could hand off to Faulk. Or he could throw to the best
receiving corps in the league. He can trust Isaac Bruce, Az-Zahir
Hakim, Torry Holt and Ricky Proehl to make all the catches, run all
the right routes.</TE>
<TE>   It won't all be up to the offense. The Ram defense finished No. 1
in the NFC. The Eagles have been touted as the great defensive team
in this game because of Douglas, an effective blitz and a talented
secondary, but it was the Rams who had more sacks and more takeaways
than the Eagles. The Eagle defense was ranked No. 4 in the NFC. The
Ram defense forced Green Bay into eight turnovers last weekend, but
all the pub went to Douglas because he knocked out Miller.</TE>
<TE>   With new defensive coordinator Lovie Smith and eight newcomers to
the defense, the Rams have tried hard to get rid of the reputation as
a team that can only score and never stop anyone else from scoring.</TE>
<TE>   As defensive tackle Jeff Zgonina says, "I think we've set the tone
of our defense, thanks to Lovie. We play hard, we play fast. We
rotate so much, we're always fresh. We're always running to the ball,
pressuring the quarterback, running to the running back. If it's not
good enough, then it's not good enough. But I think that in our
defensive room, everybody thinks we're good enough to stop anybody."</TE>
<TE>   Donovan McNabb, the Eagle quarterback, will have to be stopped. It
sounds easy, stopping one guy, but the Bears couldn't do it last
week.</TE>
<TE>   Ram Coach Mike Martz says that what most impresses him about
McNabb is that the third-year quarterback "is getting better every
single game. He is better today than he was yesterday."</TE>
<TE>   McNabb was spectacular in leading the Eagles past Chicago. The
Bears couldn't catch McNabb, couldn't disrupt his focus. When he was
out of the pocket, McNabb located his receivers and made precise
throws.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis cornerback Dexter McCleon looks at McNabb and sees "his
ability to buy time in the pocket. Donovan has the ability to escape
and still make the strong throw downfield.</TE>
<TE>   "You cannot relax for a second because a guy like Donovan, as you
all saw last weekend, can buy time and deliver the ball. Just like
that."</TE>
<TE>   Smith, the defensive coordinator, might assign a spy to tail
McNabb. Safety Kim Herring may get the job or possibly Tommy Polley,
who had two interceptions against Green Bay's Brett Favre last
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   The Rams beat the Eagles, 20-17 in overtime, in the season opener
in Philadelphia. McNabb was mostly contained.</TE>
<TE>   "But [in that game]," Ram All-Pro cornerback Aeneas Williams says,
"Donovan would stand more in the pocket. Now, if he doesn't see what
he likes, he is more willing to take off and run with the ball. Not
just run, but he is also looking to make plays."</TE>
<TE>   McNabb says that his confidence is high now. He is not bragging.
He is not boasting. He is just stating a fact. "We, as a team, are
playing well right now," McNabb says. "It is all coming together for
all of us, myself included. We're a young team, we had some rough
spots during the season, but we trust each other now. We're ready."</TE>
<TE>   Warner says his ribs are sore but when the game starts, he won't
notice the pain. And one more thing. "We're ready to play," Warner
says. "All of us."</TE>

<LD>Ram cornerback Aeneas Williams and Eagle quarterback Donovan McNabb
are playing in the NFC championship game, and that has folks at a
Phoenix training center feeling good.</LD>
<LD>   Williams and McNabb spent part of the off-season working out with
each other at Rehab Plus, which uses some off-beat methods to get pro
athletes in condition.</LD>
<LD>   "It's kind of one-stop shopping for human performance," said
Warren Anderson, executive director of the facility.</LD>
<TE>   One drill has McNabb throwing passes and Williams catching
them--while both are standing on balance beams. Another has them
defending a soccer goal by batting away odd-shaped pet toys fired at
them from close range. Then, there's the task of one-hopping an
onslaught of lacrosse balls.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll take things from the military, martial arts and from
boxing, just plain science too," Anderson said. "Our motto is, stay
healthy and make plays."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Williams said defending against McNabb is getting tougher because,
as he matures as a quarterback, he's relying on his running ability
to buy time for the pass, not to release upfield.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, you were more concerned with him running for long
yardage," Williams said. "But now he's not just looking to run. He's
actually looking to make a play throwing the ball in what I call a
gray area. ... Linebackers and secondary guys are in a very
uncomfortable situation whether to go try and tackle him or stay back
and cover your guy. So he's done a tremendous job getting rid of the
ball very near the line of scrimmage."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Point spread? What point spread? Philadelphia defensive end Hugh
Douglas insists he isn't bothered the Eagles are 11-point underdogs.</TE>
<TE>   "When I go home, I usually play video games and stuff so I really
don't watch TV," he said. "I really don't know about the point
spread, and I really don't care about what the media is saying. The
game is played on the field, bottom line."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ram Coach Mike Martz thinks his players are better equipped to
handle Philadelphia's blitz than they were in the opener, when Kurt
Warner was sacked four times.</TE>
<TE>   "Initially, we didn't handle it very well," Martz said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they have come a long way defensively, and I think we
have come a long way offensively in those situations. Everybody
during the course of the season has felt like they need to blitz Kurt
to get to him and to disrupt him and to win the game. He's been able
to do a remarkable job in dealing with everybody's blitz problems."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chunky Soup has to be pleased with the matchup. McNabb and Warner
endorse the product and, in the commercials, are reminded by their
mothers to get their fill of soup.</TE>
<TE>   By the way, those women aren't their real moms.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if our moms at home know each other," Warner said.
"Maybe they'll meet this weekend."</TE>

<HD>Raider Sellouts Revisited</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Oakland Raiders are reviving claims that the accounting firm
Andersen, known until last year as Arthur Andersen, destroyed
evidence that could prove it lied in 1995 when it assured sellouts at
the stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Congressional investigations into Andersen, and revelations that
Andersen destroyed documents of bankrupt client Enron Corp., have
"refocused us on this issue," Raider attorney Ken Hausman said in the
Contra Costa Times on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The Raiders did not immediately return calls to Associated Press.</LD>
<TE>   The Coliseum hired Andersen in 1995 to track applications for
10-year personal seat licenses to Raider games. The program was the
centerpiece of the Bay Area's attempts to bring the Raiders back to
Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders sued the parties in 1998 for $1.1 billion, contending
Raider owner Al Davis was assured of stadium sellouts by Andersen
representatives and by Coliseum and city officials.</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders say poor attendance has hurt the team financially.
Last year, 24,000 of 55,000 personal seat licenses were sold. Fewer
than half of 143 luxury suites were taken.</TE>
<TE>   The suit claims Davis wouldn't have returned the team had he known
the stadium would not sell out, and that Andersen helped Coliseum
officials conceal information.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former St. Louis Cardinal pitcher and Stanford quarterback Chad
Hutchinson signed a seven-year contract with the Dallas Cowboys.</TE>
<TE>   Hutchinson, 6 feet 5 and 230 pounds, received a $3.1-million
signing bonus, the Cowboys' Web site reported. Hutchinson, 24, last
played in 1997 at Stanford. He passed for more than 4,000 yards in
two seasons.</TE>

<HD>Hull Is Getting Over Empty Feelings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was a time when Brett Hull disdained empty-net goals. Not
anymore.</LD>
<LD>   Brett Hull fired his third goal of the game Saturday night into an
empty net with 27 seconds to play.</LD>
<LD>   He also had two assists, leading the Detroit Red Wings past the
Blues, 5-2, at St. Louis.</LD>
<TE>   It was Hull's 31st career hat trick.</TE>
<TE>   "They're so hard to get," Hull said. "I used to tell everybody I
didn't want empty-netters. Now, if I can get 30 of them, I'd take
them all. I think everyone in the league feels the same way. It's
just nice to be out there. For years, I wasn't out there in that
situation."</TE>
<TE>   Hull's linemates, Pavel Datsyuk and Boyd Devereaux, each scored a
goal and had two assists.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Wings are 4-0-1 in their last five games. It was the
second consecutive loss for the Blues, who had won 10 in a row. The
loss also ended a seven-game winning streak at home.</TE>
<TE>   Hull, who has 21 goals this season, scored twice within 17 seconds
and assisted on another goal in the first period.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Tkachuk's 27th goal, on a power play, pulled St. Louis
within 2-1 in the period.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Wings led, 4-1, on a goal by Devereaux at 8:07 of the
second period. St. Louis responded with a goal by Cory Stillman at
11:29.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 4, Carolina 2--Jeremy Roenick and Justin Williams
scored 38 seconds apart in the first period for the Flyers at
Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Recchi and Simon Gagne also scored for the Flyers, who are
unbeaten in 16 games (15-0-1) against Southeast Division teams.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Boucher made 16 saves for Philadelphia. Carolina was held to
18 shots.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boston 4, Florida 2--Joe Thornton scored the 99th and 100th goals
of his career in the third period, spoiling Mike Keenan's return to
Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Thornton, who has 21 goals this season, became the fourth Boston
player with 20 goals or more.</TE>
<TE>   Pavel Bure scored his 400th career goal for the Panthers, becoming
the 68th player to reach that milestone.</TE>
<TE>   Keenan coached the Bruins for most of last season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Edmonton 4, Toronto 1--Mike Comrie scored twice, including the
go-ahead goal midway through the third period, and the host Oilers
ended a three-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Ethan Moreau and Todd Marchant also scored for the Oilers.</TE>
<TE>   Bryan McCabe scored for Toronto, which has lost two in a row and
is 1-4-0-1 in its last six.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 3, Atlanta 2--Randy Robitaille set up the Penguins'
second goal, then scored the game-winner with 58 seconds left in
overtime at Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   The Penguins won for the sixth consecutive time.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh also got goals from Mario Lemieux and Aleksey Morozov.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York Islanders 6, Tampa Bay 2--Mariusz Czerkawski and Claude
Lapointe each had two goals and the Islanders ended a four-game home
losing streak at Uniondale, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Mats Lindgren and Michael Peca also scored for the Islanders.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa 1, Montreal 1--Daniel Alfredsson scored with 2:59 left,
giving Ottawa a tie at Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Zednik gave the Canadiens a 1-0 lead with his 14th goal
early in the period.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York Rangers 6, Washington 3--Radek Dvorak had two goals and
Eric Lindros and Theo Fleury each scored at New York, and the Rangers

<TE>   Dainius Zubrus scored twice for Washington and Brendan Witt scored
once.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 3, Columbus 2--Daniel Briere had a goal and an assist at

<TE>   It was Bertuzzi's 16th goal this season and extended his
point-scoring streak to 12 games.</TE>

<HD>It's Snap Judgment Day</HD>
<DH>AFC: Overlooked early in season, quarterbacks Brady and
Stewart could be the key figures today in conference title game.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. ADANDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>Pittsburgh Steeler quarterback Kordell Stewart said that for all of
the movement and multiple looks of the New England Patriots' defense,
it pays to focus on one thing: "That's the safeties and knowing where
they are."</LD>
<LD>   He'll definitely want to pay attention to the whereabouts of
Patriot safety Lawyer Milloy during today's AFC championship game.
Heinz Field security might want to keep an eye on him, too.</LD>
<LD>   That's because Milloy invoked the name and antics of Mike Tyson
during an otherwise innocuous day of interviews Friday.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't feel like we're getting that respect, and we're fighting
for the AFC championship," Milloy said. "And that's crazy, to me. I
almost feel like Tyson did the other day. He's sitting there on the
podium; us and Pittsburgh are sitting there on the podium. He's a
former heavyweight champion of the world. Then they get up [and say]
'Lennox Lewis, undisputed heavyweight champion of the world' and how
good he is. Mike is just sitting over there, watching all this, like
we're doing watching Pittsburgh and the other two teams. And it's
like, 'What about us?'</TE>
<TE>   "What'd Mike do? He snapped. The only difference is, we're not
going to do it on the podium. We're going to do it out there on the
field."</TE>
<TE>   Watch the legs, Steelers. Keep the helmets on and make sure the
earholes are tight. Just in case.</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots shouldn't have to result to such dirty tactics.
Actually, what got them here was a by-the-book definition of the
rules: a replay review that followed a strict interpretation of a
"forward pass." That turned an apparent fumble by quarterback Tom
Brady into a mere incompletion, and allowed New England to complete a
comeback from a 10-point deficit against the Raiders to win, 16-13.</TE>
<TE>   That apparently was enough to make them into a "Team of
Destiny"--at least according to the line of questioning at their
pregame news conference.</TE>
<TE>   And that title apparently bothered the Patriots.</TE>
<TE>   "When you say 'Team of Destiny,' I think that, to me, that means
lucky," Brady said. "I don't think we are lucky to be here. I think
that we are a pretty darned good football team and we've proved
that."</TE>
<TE>   The truth is, there's nothing fluky about a team making it to the
conference championship when it has a Pro Bowl quarterback. Three of
the NFL's four semifinalists have one, and the fourth might have the
best playmaker at the position: Philadelphia's Donovan McNabb.</TE>
<TE>   A great defense might be necessary to win a championship, as the
Baltimore Ravens showed last year. But unlike the 2001 formula, this
year quarterbacks have to do more than show an ability to hold onto
the ball.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an integral part of it," Steeler Coach Bill Cowher said.
"That's a guy that's touching the ball, that's a guy that's had to
bring you back. You go through a season, he's had to win some games
for you. A quarterback is going to have to win a few games for you
along the way. If you've got a guy that can't do that, at some point
you're going to get exposed.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what you see is the four teams that are still in it
literally have quarterbacks that have won games by themselves during
the course of the year."</TE>
<TE>   But unlike McNabb and St. Louis' Kurt Warner, the AFC championship
quarterbacks are two guys nobody predicted would receive accolades.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart was underrated because his game had dropped off so
dramatically since 1997. Brady was unknown because he started the
season behind Drew Bledsoe on the depth chart. But after Bledsoe was
sent to the hospital by a hard hit in the second game, Brady took
over ... and took off.</TE>
<TE>   He completed 264 of his 413 attempts for 2,843 yards and 18
touchdowns. He'll join the stars in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   He'll also join the likes of Warner, Daunte Culpepper and Pat
Haden as quarterbacks who took their teams to the conference
championship in their first year as a starter. (Then again, any list
that also includes Dieter Brock and Shaun King can't be considered
too exclusive.)</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very solid quarterback," Cowher said of Brady. "He's
got a strong arm. He plays with great poise for a guy who's a
first-year starter. I'm very impressed."</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots have not given up more than 17 points in any of their
last seven games. Not coincidentally, they've won them all.</TE>
<TE>   But now they face the Pittsburgh powerhouse. As Patriot Coach Bill
Belichick noted, the Steelers have outgained their opponents by
"almost a mile" this season, 5,887 yards to 4,137. They led the
league in rushing and finished third in total offense.</TE>
<TE>   And they've done it even though running back Jerome Bettis hasn't
played since Dec. 2. Cowher said Bettis has recovered from the groin
injury that kept him out the past five games and will be ready to go.</TE>
<TE>   The Steelers maintained their winning ways thanks to fill-ins
Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala and Amos Zereoue. And because they're
utilizing the mobility of Stewart and his good decision-making within
the simplified offense.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not as [run-oriented] as we've been in the past maybe, live
and die by the run," Cowher said. "We feel like we can throw the ball
very effectively if we have to. We certainly are built around trying
to establish the run. That has never changed in any game that we go
into."</TE>
<TE>   NFL observers have projected the Steelers into the Super Bowl
since the middle of the season. People kept waiting for Brady and the
Patriots to expire, yet here they are.</TE>
<TE>   Just don't tell them they were destined to be here.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Failing Its Chemistry Test</HD>
<DH>Analysis: If soccer team wants to advance in World Cup,
Arena needs to decide on his starting forwards.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mathematically, it's possible that the United States could advance to
the second round of this summer's World Cup without scoring a goal.
Three 0-0 ties against Portugal, South Korea and Poland could do the
trick if other results went the Americans' way.</LD>
<LD>   But such an improbable scenario is hardly the sort of thing the
U.S. soccer team should be contemplating.</LD>
<LD>   What Coach Bruce Arena and his assistants need to do--in a
hurry--is determine who the starting forwards will be in Korea/Japan
'02 and give them as much playing time together as possible.</LD>
<TE>   The CONCACAF Gold Cup is part of that process, but heading into
today's quarterfinal match against El Salvador at the Rose Bowl, the
results have been disappointing.</TE>
<TE>   True, two games have produced two victories. But in edging South
Korea, 2-1, and Cuba, 1-0, the U.S. has hardly shown the sort of
firepower that will be needed in the May 31-June 30 World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Landon Donovan lobbed in a goal, taking smart advantage of a
Korean goalkeeper who was well off his line. DaMarcus Beasley
volleyed in another, with a left-foot shot he could not repeat
against Cuba. And Brian McBride scored from the penalty spot.</TE>
<TE>   Arena selected five forwards for his Gold Cup roster: Donovan,
McBride, Jeff Cunningham, Ante Razov and Josh Wolff. He kept Clint
Mathis in reserve but might activate him for this afternoon's match.</TE>
<TE>   The most telling comment Arena has made so far in this 12-nation
tournament came when he said: "We need to find a better partner up
front for McBride."</TE>
<TE>   Apart from being a slap in the face for Razov and Wolff, who
started against South Korea and Cuba, respectively, it seemed to be
an admission that McBride already is inked in as a World Cup starter.</TE>
<TE>   There's nothing wrong with that. The striker is a threat in the
air as well as on the ground and ranks fifth all-time with 15 goals
for the national team. He had the only goal the U.S. managed in the
1998 World Cup in France when he scored against Iran.</TE>
<TE>   But to write off Wolff so quickly seems hasty. Wolff and Mathis
were a potent partnership early in World Cup qualifying before both
were sidelined by injuries. It will take Wolff time to regain the
sharpness he showed a year ago before he suffered a stress fracture
in his left foot.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, the finishing aspect of my game was not there today,"
he said after the Cuba match. "I should have had a couple of goals,
it would have helped this team gain a little more confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no excuses to be made. I need to be better in front of
the goal because that's my job."</TE>
<TE>   Arena agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Josh was OK today," he said. "It's been a long time since he's
played 60 minutes. I thought he tired a little bit. He's still not
completely confident coming off his injury and he didn't do well with
a couple of chances. But I thought his running off the ball was
pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   Considering it was only the third game in eight months for Wolff
and only the second time he had played alongside McBride, it is too
early to say the partnership is the wrong one for the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought Brian and I played really well [together] today," Wolff
said. "I was a little bit better on the timing of his flicks [flicked
headers] and able to get behind him and support him when he won some
balls. Maybe in the middle of the field we need to play a little bit
better together when the ball's at our feet."</TE>
<TE>   The McBride-Wolff combination is not as dynamic as the
Mathis-Wolff pairing, but if Arena is intent on starting McBride in
the World Cup it is going to be difficult to have Mathis and Wolff on
the field at the same time, not to mention Donovan.</TE>
<TE>   Mathis could drop back into an attacking midfield role, but the
U.S. midfield already is crowded, what with Chris Armas, Claudio
Reyna and Earnie Stewart likely World Cup starters and John O'Brien,
Cobi Jones and Beasley very much in the picture.</TE>
<TE>   A great deal will depend on how quickly and how well Mathis
returns after being out for more than seven months because of torn
ligaments in his right knee suffered in June.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has significant games on its pre-World Cup schedule,
including encounters with Italy in February, Germany in March,
Ireland in April and the Netherlands in May.</TE>
<TE>   But unless the Americans can start producing some goals against
the likes of El Salvador, their World Cup prospects will remain
gloomy.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Women Net Few Goals on China Trip</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>What in the world is going on?</LD>
<LD>   The fact that the United States men's national team is finding it
difficult to score goals is nothing new.</LD>
<LD>   But why are the defending world champion U.S. women suddenly
unable to find the back of the net? Why have Tiffeny Milbrett,
Shannon MacMillan, Cindy Parlow and company been shut out in
consecutive matches in the last week?</LD>
<TE>   With the men's World Cup in Japan and South Korea only four months
away, scant attention is being paid to the women's team. But there
seems to be increasing reason for concern about the once all-powerful
squad which dominated the world under former coaches Anson Dorrance
and Tony DiCicco.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the U.S. women lost, 1-0, to Norway, the same team
that beat them in the gold medal game of the Sydney 2000 Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the U.S. was held to a 0-0 tie by Germany, winner of
the last three European championships.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the U.S. women play China in the final game of the Four
Nations Tournament in Guangzhou, China. The event so far has been a
huge letdown for Coach April Heinrichs' team.</TE>
<TE>   Before the trip, the Americans had an enviable record on the
Chinese mainland, where they won the inaugural Women's World Cup in
1991.</TE>
<TE>   They were 11-3-7 in games played in China.</TE>
<TE>   But Wednesday's loss to the Norwegians in Huadu put a quick end to
the notion that the U.S. is a lock to retain its title when the
fourth Women's World Cup is played in China next year. That event,
scheduled Sept. 28 to Oct. 16 in the cities of Shanghai, Hangzhou,
Wuhan and Chengdu, should be wide open.</TE>
<TE>   Norway probably should be considered the favorite. The Americans
outshot the Norwegians, 17-7, but could not beat goalkeeper Astrid
Johannessen.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very disappointed in the loss and very disappointed in our
performance in the first 20 minutes," Heinrichs said. "We were
dominant in the air and outshot them by a wide margin, yet we were
down, 1-0. Norway is a great team and they play smart. They simplify
the game and stick to their game plan."</TE>
<TE>   Norway scored in the fifth minute when forward Dagny Mellgren, who
plays for the Boston Breakers in the Women's United Soccer Assn.,
assisted on a goal by Unni Lehn, who beat U.S. goalkeeper Lakeysia
Beene.</TE>
<TE>   "Norway is too good a team and too organized for us to give up an
early goal," U.S captain Julie Foudy said.</TE>
<TE>   "We came out a bit flat and paid for it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wry But No Hamm</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't as if the Americans took an understrength squad on the
trip.</TE>
<TE>   The 18-player roster includes nine members of the 1999 world
championship-winning team: Foudy, MacMillan, Milbrett, Parlow, Brandi
Chastain, Lorrie Fair, Joy Fawcett, Kristine Lilly and Kate Sobrero.</TE>
<TE>   Notable by her absence, however, was Mia Hamm, the world's
all-time leading goal scorer. Hamm is said to be recuperating from a
leg injury.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the U.S. again struggled to score and had to share the
points with Germany at Yingdong stadium in Panyu, while Norway was
rolling over China, 3-0. Germany had been beaten, 2-1, by China on
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "The USA looks at a tie as a loss," Heinrichs said. "We don't sit
back and wait for ties, we always go forward to win."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. outshot Germany, 9-3, but were blanked by goalkeeper
Silke Rottenberg.</TE>
<TE>   "Scoring goals is the most difficult part of the game," said
Heinrichs, who scored 38 in 47 appearances for the U.S., a scoring
average second only to Michelle Akers. "You can't take two months off
and expect that scoring touch to be there. It's something that has to
be worked on and from that work and repetition, scoring confidence
will come.</TE>
<TE>   "We played some good soccer, and if soccer was voted on like
gymnastics or figure skating, we'd probably be voted the winner of
both games. But soccer is not just an artistic game, it's about
results and you have to come to win."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sobrero Nears Record</TE>
<TE>   If she plays against China today and fails to score a goal,
Sobrero will set a record.</TE>
<TE>   In the 17-year history of the women's national team, no field
player has played more games without scoring than Sobrero, a defender
who has been shut out in 70 international appearances.</TE>
<TE>   To be fair to the former Notre Dame standout, her job is to
prevent goals, not score them. Then again, even 1991 world
championship team member Linda Hamilton, also a defender, managed one
goal in her 71 games for the U.S. between 1987-95.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Julie Who?</TE>
<TE>   Foudy of Mission Viejo, a self-described "6-foot-1, blue-eyed
blond and former runway model," might be a two-time world champion
and an Olympic gold and silver medalist, but that doesn't mean she is
recognized everywhere she goes.</TE>
<TE>   On a flight to Washington, D.C., from Charleston, S.C., where the
U.S. trounced Mexico, 7-0, on Jan. 12, Foudy was busily working on
her laptop computer when a flight attendant approached her.</TE>
<TE>   "So, are you the team manager or something?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mexico Gets a Lesson</TE>
<TE>   Although it struggles to score against top-flight teams, the U.S.
can still rout lesser opposition. MacMillan recorded a hat trick in
the victory over Mexico, which was the first game of the year.</TE>
<TE>   That pushed her goal total to 38 and put her in a tie with Foudy
for eighth place on the all time U.S. scoring list.</TE>

<HD>Sounding Off on Transfer Issue</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For five consecutive Sundays, I have addressed the issue of transfer
students in high school sports, with the hope of encouraging a
dialogue on what must be done to protect the integrity of the system.</LD>
<LD>   It's an issue that provokes emotional responses. The dozens of
e-mails coming in show there are people willing to take a stand
against the abuses taking place.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   From Jack of Palos Verdes, the father of three sons: "I remember
when the Ivy League de-emphasized sports in the early '50s and my
anger at the University of Pennsylvania. As I look back, I now
recognize they made the proper decision. I never realized our high
schools would become so infected with the misguided emphasis on
sports. I have witnessed some of the worst conduct possible in the
high school ranks--the overemphasis on winning, transfers, abominable
coaches, unrealistic parents, substance abuse and administrators who
are either oblivious or don't care."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From Michael, a former basketball coach: "I can honestly say that
as much as I loved coaching kids, I would not be able to coach in the
current high school environment. The greatest satisfaction I derived
from coaching was seeing the development of an athlete from the
awkward early stages of adolescence to the confidence of early
adulthood. Being loyal to your school, your teammates and your coach
was part of what built great teams. It was what made me enjoy
coaching, even if we didn't win.</TE>
<TE>   "The current trend in high school athletics emphasizes immediate
gratification. Athletes and their parents are encouraged to
continually look for a better situation to enhance their chances for
more attention from colleges. Their willingness to sacrifice academic
continuity for the sake of a championship or scholarship is alarming.</TE>
<TE>   "Perspective has been lost. High school athletics is a beautiful
thing in its purest form, but with more and more emphasis on getting
scholarships, athletes have become commodities and coaches have
become pimps. Ultimately, the only individuals who have control over
this trend are parents. They must have the wisdom to look beyond the
immediate gratification and have the strength to make the right
decision for their children."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From Mark of Long Beach, a former athletic director: "I fought
hard for integrity but we were so outnumbered that even with the help
of the CIF, we were unable to stem the wave of cheating. I left it
over 10 years ago but have kept in touch. It is truly amazing what
has gone on. The state of athletics caused by the unscrupulous
actions of coaches, parents and administrators in our high schools is
absolutely deplorable."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From Bruce of Thousand Oaks, whose son is a quarterback:
"Transferring has become a false remedy for ailments that can't be
corrected. My son bleeds green and white, loves his class and
teammates. Transferring was never an option. He rode the bench his
junior year to play with his friends his senior year and hopes that
he plays well enough to get to the next level. Either way, he
believes he made the right decision."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From Joe of Chino: "I am appalled at how bluntly parents are
shopping their kids around. I had a parent ask me if I could tell
them before the May 15 [transfer] deadline if a particular coach was
going to be rehired so they could put in their transfer because they
are not happy with the amount of playing time.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids are playing like a bunch of individuals because they are
more concerned with their playing time and stats. I have had players
threaten to transfer after I have disciplined them or because I
wanted them to play another position for the good of the team. My
response is, 'Come to my office and I will give you the transfer
slip.' We had a couple of kids transfer to another school for
football season and then want to transfer back after the season so
they can graduate with their friends. I just wonder what their
'friends' think."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From Tim: "There is a role for high school sports and it is not to
cater to the prima donnas and their parents. All kids deserve a
chance to grasp for the brass ring, and the prostitution that is
currently infecting this last bastion of amateurism can only be
stopped when men of principle identify this plague for what it is."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From Myra of Venice: "I have been a coach with LAUSD since 1982.
This year I stepped down from coaching volleyball. I am tired of
watching new coaches and some old coaches do illegal things. I have
always made it a point to 'pursue victory with honor.' I believe that
as a coach, our influence on our students is important and if we do
not run a clean program how can we expect our students to do the
correct things?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From Brian of Simi Valley: "There is a lot to be said for a kid
staying in the community where he has lived with his friends no
matter how bad the sports program is. My son is playing for an
average team and I know if he is good enough to get a sports
scholarship, he will get noticed no matter how the team does."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From Eileen of Encino, the mother of a football player: "Many
times we've been told by parents that they were unhappy with the
sports programs and they were moving to greener pastures. They can go
because my reply has been: 'My son is not here for the sports but for
the academics.' The sports is a nice plus, and it will be there to
teach him discipline, commitment and teamwork."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From Jerry of Culver City, an athletic director: "High school
sports needs to address the real purpose of their existence,
supporting the education of our young people. The lessons we are
teaching through athletics may not always be consistent with what we
preach. Please know that there are steps being taken to address this
issue. The questions will be: How long will it take? How effective
will it be? And what legal challenges will have to be addressed?"</TE>

<LD>Steve Geary came off the bench to score 15 points as Cal Poly San
Luis Obispo defeated UC Irvine, 50-47, on Saturday night before 3,032
at San Luis Obispo.</LD>
<LD>   Geary's layup with 4:27 remaining put Cal Poly, 11-6 overall and
5-4 in the Big West Conference, up 45-44. Geary made a three-point
basket and Brandon Beeson made two free throws to put the Mustangs
up, 50-44, with 1:38 to play.</LD>
<LD>   UC Irvine's Mike Hood made a three-point shot with 1:23 remaining
to pull the Anteaters within 50-47, but neither team scored the rest
of the way.</LD>
<TE>   Hood and Adam Parada scored 11 each to lead UC Irvine (14-6, 7-2),
which is now tied with Cal State Northridge for first in the
conference.</TE>
<TE>   The Anteaters outrebounded Cal Poly, 49-34, but committed 19
turnovers to Cal Poly's eight.</TE>

<TE>   Cal State Northridge 84, UC Riverside 69--The Matadors pulled into
a first-place tie in the Big West thanks to a suffocating defense
that forced Riverside into 22 turnovers at Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   Before a spirited 1,430 at the Matadome, Northridge (8-10, 7-2)
limited the Highlanders to 35.3% shooting and slowly pulled away in
the second half. The Matadors, who have won five in a row and six of
seven, shot 60.9% in the second half and also made 32 of 48 free
throws in a foul-plagued game.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels good," said Northridge guard Markus Carr about being in
first. "We've worked real hard in practice and we've been able to be
successful in most of these games.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew we had the talent to do good things. Lately we've been
able to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Northridge won despite a subpar game from Carr, who had 14 points
but only on two-for-11 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Lionel Benjamin had 13 points and Curtis Slaughter and Jermar
Welch each had 12.</TE>
<TE>   Leading 37-35 at halftime, the Matadors scored six of the first
eight points to push the lead to six. Riverside (6-11, 3-6) pulled
within 43-42 on Lloyd Cook's layup along the baseline, but Carr
answered with five points in a 9-0 run.</TE>

<HD>Tyson Might Not Receive His License</HD>

<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Mike Tyson's chances of getting a boxing license from the Nevada
State Athletic Commission have diminished considerably in the last
few days because of intense pressure from  the state's power brokers
and the public, according to several sources.</LD>
<LD>   One source said it is no better than 50-50 that the former
two-time heavyweight champion will get a license when he comes before
the commission Tuesday. Another source predicted Tyson won't get the
license.</LD>
<LD>   He needs to be licensed for a planned title match against champion
Lennox Lewis, scheduled for April 6 at Las Vegas' MGM Grand Hotel.</LD>
<TE>   Tyson severely damaged his case last Tuesday when he initiated a
brawl at a  news conference here to promote the fight.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis' handlers claim Tyson bit the champion on the thigh.</TE>
<TE>   On the same day, a Las Vegas police lieutenant, concluding an
investigation into charges Tyson sexually assaulted a woman in his
Las Vegas home in September, said, "There is probable cause to
believe a crime has occurred."</TE>
<TE>   Until the latest wave of negative publicity, it was assumed the
commissioners, representing a state that has been suffering
economically since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, would not stand in
the way of a fight that could bring tens of millions of dollars into
the local economy.</TE>
<TE>   No one involved in the decision-making process wished to be quoted
in order to maintain a sense of open-mindedness heading into the
hearing.</TE>
<TE>   But, according to one source, leaders of the gambling industry,
the most powerful lobby in the state, have indicated to commissioners
that they do not regard a Tyson fight as a make-or-break event for
the local economy.</TE>
<TE>   When Tyson bit  Evander Holyfield's ears in their 1997 heavyweight
title rematch, the commission took Tyson's license away for 18
months.</TE>
<TE>   Only Luther Mack is still around from that five-man commission.
The new members are Amy Ayoub, listed as a political consultant; Flip
Homansky and Tony Alamo, both physicians; and John Bailey, an
attorney. Tyson needs the approval of three of the five.</TE>

<LD>Police on Saturday identified the bartender and mother of seven who
was shot to death in a Tustin bar in an apparent murder-suicide.</LD>
<LD>   Police said Douglas Kissler, an estranged boyfriend, shot Janet
Bielman several times in Godfather's Bar on Friday before killing
himself.</LD>
<LD>   Co-workers, who are planning a fund to support Bielman's children,
called her a devoted mother who spent most of her free time shuttling
the children, ages 2 to 17, to sports games and practices.</LD>
<TE>   "She was just a wonderful person, a very hard-working mom," said
co-worker Lucy Heyliger. "She loved her job and people here loved
her."</TE>
<TE>   Kissler, 42, was the father of Bielman's 2-year-old, police said.
Bielman, 38, was engaged to another man, friends said.</TE>

<TE>   As a Jew whose family was touched by the Holocaust, I share the anger
of Adele Bloch-Bauer's descendants for the sad, unjust way her portrait
and other Bloch-Bauer family-owned paintings ended up in the museum in
Austria. But they have to rise above their personal claims--to that high
moral ground that gave them the right to demand the return of the
paintings in the first place--and realize that Gustav Klimt's
masterpieces do not belong to them; they belong to all people.
Masterpieces can't be divided and locked up like bonds or real estate. No
matter what the legal reasoning is behind their ownership. No matter who
paid to have them produced. They are just too magnificent for that. Maria
Bloch-Bauer Altmann could show she inherited some of her aunt's greatness
if she let go of her claim and allowed everyone to enjoy these timeless
paintings at a public museum.</TE>

<TE>   O'Connor should be commended for her thorough report. I loved the
story and the way it was written. Altmann clearly is not poor regarding
dignity but poor because she is the victim of the Austrians who stole
property from her family. Nobody should be allowed to get away with what
was done to them.</TE>

<HD>Catching Up With Antonio Villaraigosa</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES RICCI</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's been eight months, almost a full human gestation period, since
Antonio Villaraigosa lost his campaign to become mayor. It might be a
good time, I thought, to see what the former speaker of the California
Assembly made of the experience. By now, surely, his take on it must be
fully formed. In some ways, the losers of high-stakes elections are more
interesting to talk to than winners, who, subsumed into the business and
pageantry of office, have little time for introspection, and nothing to
gain from it.</LD>
<LD>   Since the election, Villaraigosa has been rather interview-shy, an
unaccustomed condition for a man who by instinct is candid and
self-analytical. He agreed to meet for breakfast, and he showed up early
one recent morning at the downtown Checkers Hotel as brisk-gaited and
finely attired as ever, glad-handing waiters and busboys, making a point
of chatting them up in their native Spanish. Villaraigosa's loss
apparently hasn't dimmed his appeal to those who supported him and his
message of change and ethnic inclusiveness. These days, however, the man
Gov. Gray Davis, former L.A. Mayor Richard Riordan, the Los Angeles Times
and 46.5% of voters wanted for mayor travels the city unchauffeured and
unentouraged.</LD>
<LD>   "Yeah, now I walk in by myself, but I'm comfortable with it," he says.
"I know the way it works. Two years from now I could be in an entirely
different situation again."</LD>
<TE>   Since the election, Villaraigosa has landed a trio of paid
consultancies involving the raising of private funds for investment in
cities, the establishment of a biomedical research park at County-USC
Hospital and the promotion of California agricultural products. Having
turned down a fellowship at Harvard, he's teaching and putting together
forums on urban issues at UCLA and USC. "I want to profundicize, if
that's a word, my understanding of public policy, of how cities work," he
says. "I'm spending this time in deep introspection, and reflection, with
an an eye to growing."</TE>
<TE>   That said, he clings to a desire to "turn this city around; to get it
to understand and embrace its destiny as the preeminent city in the
world, the Venice of the New Age." (Memo to Villaraigosa supporters: The
next mayoral election is 3 1/2 years away.)</TE>
<TE>   What I was particularly curious about was how, after this interval of
time, he looked upon now-Mayor James Hahn's below-the-belt crack-pipe TV
ad associating him with drug dealing. Villaraigosa's response at the time
was temperate. Had it not been, he probably would have lost the election
by more than he did. All through the campaign he seemed wary of provoking
white prejudice. When he responded to suggestive opposition ads, his poll
numbers tended to fall. He had to restrain his Mexican American pride,
keep the gloves on, appear as accommodating as a headwaiter, as humble as
a supplicant. It's a wonder he didn't internally hemorrhage.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the ad, which referred to Villaraigosa's self-admittedly
boneheaded letter in support of a presidential pardon for drug dealer
Carlos Vignali, clearly remains stuck in him like an arrow. He has
consistently expressed support for the new mayor, but within his
magnanimous assertions, hurt and frustration seem to pace like caged
animals. "As speaker, I passed the biggest parks initiative in the
history of the state, the biggest schools initiative in the history of
the state. And my whole life--reduced to crack cocaine." He shakes his
head. "My son on election night couldn't stop crying. I told him, 'In
many ways we won tonight.' He said, 'I'm not crying because we lost. I'm
crying because he cheated and you're not supposed to win when you cheat.'
"</TE>
<TE>   For all this, Villaraigosa continues to maintain that "I did not lose
because of my race." He lost, he says, "because I was not markedly
better." He has "no regrets" about the campaign, feels "blessed by the
experience."</TE>
<TE>   Sometime soon, Villaraigosa will undergo surgery on a noncancerous
tumor embedded in his spine. The benign neoplasm was surgically reduced
when he was a teenager. It has grown since, however, causing intolerable
pain, and it must be whittled again. "They have to take the tumor off all
the spinal spaghetti," he explains. "You pull one of those strands and
something's out--your walking's gone."</TE>
<TE>   The hurt and frustration that politicians experience must be handled
with similar care, eliminated in a way that does not disable them
politically. Had I been Villaraigosa, I'd have screamed bloody murder
about Hahn's ad and called it what it was, a cynical appeal to white
prejudices about the presumed instinctive criminality of Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   But that's one of the more remarkable and underappreciated strengths
of successful politicians. Not only can they subjugate their most
compelling human urges to their ambitions, but they manage to function
under the most ridiculous burden of all--our desire to know them
genuinely and our tendency to reject them the moment they depart from the
stagy nobility that makes us scorn them as phony.</TE>

<LD>Rodney "R.C." Smith directs traffic as if he's conducting the
world's greatest symphony orchestra. A traffic officer with L.A.'s
Department of Transportation, Smith has been unclogging intersections and
drawing crowds with his kinetic moves for 14 years. On holidays, Smith,
36, can work at as many as eight intersections, looking at times as if
he's dancing a hula, petting a dog or auditioning for a scene in a Jackie
Chan film. Unfazed by power outages, bad weather or presidential
motorcades, Smith bends his body like rubber and creates a fluid
perpetual wave with his hands, often rebuking cell phone users by hanging
up a pantomimed telephone. We asked the maestro about his chops.</LD>

sometimes slow, depending upon the traffic. My hand signals are animated.
It's not a flat hand. It's more wrist and finger action and a lot of body
motion. I love directing traffic. Pedestrians egg me on, and the more
they do, the more I go.</LD>
<TE>   What do you think of while directing?</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes music or a beat that's in my head. Barry Manilow won't work.
Before I go out, I may listen to an old George Benson CD or James Brown's
"Payback." One day it was the Stray Cats.</TE>
<TE>   What's the biggest crowd you've drawn?</TE>
<TE>   Seven or eight years ago, [then-] traffic officer Timothy Walls and I
were at Century Park East and Olympic, and they were redoing the lights.
We knew people were watching us, and we got into it. We were changing
hats. People were taking their lunch on the corner, watching us. People
were clapping. We were high-fiving, low-fiving--anything we could think
of, we were doing it.</TE>
<TE>   Any problems with groupies?</TE>
<TE>   I had women flash me when I was younger. Or they say, "Those hands are
sexy." I've had phone numbers thrown at me. Or they asked me, "What else
can you do with those sexy hands?"</TE>
<TE>   What are the best and worst intersections to control?</TE>
<TE>   LAX airport traffic is easy because it's all one way. The hardest was
when it was raining one morning at Imperial Highway and Aviation
Boulevard. It's a really wide intersection and it has columns because the
105 is above it. It's tough.</TE>
<TE>   What do you teach recruits?</TE>
<TE>   The first thing I tell them is to disregard what your parents told you
about playing in the street. You have to be highly visible. You have to
be mobile. You have to have an attitude or command presence. You can't
have any fear. The department's style is military, but everybody has
their own style or flavor. It's all technique.</TE>

<LD>Silver Lake's Zineorama sells magazines, books and the daily
paper--but its crown jewel may be the largest selection of independently
published 'zines in the city. At any given time, the store stocks from
100 to 200 small-scale do-it-yourself magazines, often idiosyncratic
labors of love written, edited and laid out by dedicated, creative sole
proprietors.</LD>
<LD>   Store owner Frank Sosa, an ex-publicist for bands such as the Pharcyde
and the Brand New Heavies, is a former customer who bought the shop in
March after hearing that the previous owners were considering shuttering
it. Sosa, who also has a background in political activism, beefed up the
'zine selection, added a stage for poetry readings, launched art and
photography exhibits and began selling "books that support a culture of
resistance." "It's a place reflecting how media can play a positive role
in society," he says.</LD>
<LD>   Zineorama offerings include titles Beer Frame, which analyzes the
design of objects such as can openers and soap; Cometbus, the continuing
chronicle of a Berkeley punk rocker's everyday life; and Brooklyn's the
Coup, which documents Sept. 11 and its aftermath, using photos, poetry
and an audio CD.</LD>
<TE>   The store will sell any 'zine it's offered, says Sosa, "unless it's
fascist or misogynistic. If it's hateful, we'll say, 'No way.' "</TE>
<TE>   You can also visit Zineorama to pick up the latest People or Vogue.
"We want regular people to come in here, and we hope to sell them
something else that might affect their world view."</TE>
<TE>   Sosa admits to feeling the urge to create a 'zine himself. While he
hasn't finalized his topic, "I'm thinking about publishing a 'zine about
what it's like to run a 'zine store."</TE>

<LD>At first blush, you wouldn't suspect the innocent trimaran rocking
gently on its triple hulls in a San Diego Bay marina of abetting a movie
debacle. But on this very craft, Kevin Costner swashbuckled, emoted and,
um, relieved himself into a can to groans from critics and audiences in
1995's "Waterworld."</LD>
<LD>   As unlucky filmgoers may recall, Universal's $175-million sci-fi opus
took place on a water-covered future Earth where Costner grew gills and
fought bad guys for custody of little piles of dirt. (There was a girl,
too.) His trusty craft was rigged with about every device a guy might
need to whiz around Hawaii with a villainous Dennis Hopper and his
snarling minions gunning their Sea-Doos in pursuit.</LD>
<LD>   Today, however, it's being refitted for respectable employment as a
racing craft--the only 60-foot trimaran on the West Coast, according to
owner Howard Enloe, a 66-year-old El Paso, Texas ambulance company owner
and boat-racing enthusiast. Once the boat is refitted with a 90-foot
mast, he hopes no competitor in these waters will be able to touch it.</LD>
<TE>   Enloe picked up the vessel about four years ago for "pennies on the
dollar" of the hundreds of thousands it cost to build for the film. A
spacious cabin is being replaced with a more spartan space holding a
navigation station along with a stove and bunks. The boat never had a
name; Enloe says he'll let it "create its own" in the racing arena. For
his part, Enloe shrugs off show-biz history: "I'm into racing boats, not
movies."</TE>

<LD>There's a prickly side to the romance of the Old West. "People
think the Colt .45 and the Winchester won the West," says Whittier
resident Onie Sims. "But the West was won with barbed wire, windmills and
the John Deere plow. I have the wire."</LD>
<LD>   More than 1,000 pieces and 600 varieties of it.</LD>
<LD>   In the late 1960s, Sims visited a friend in Texas who collected barbed
wire. Soon after, Sims and his 8-year-old son found about 25 different
types on the grounds of the Sims family's Texas ranch, and Sims was
hooked. "Then I read about a guy in Bakersfield who had a garage full, so
I visited him and became even more hooked. He gave me a bunch of wire and
sold me a book, 'The Bobbed Wire Bible' No. 3. I now have 40 or 50 books
on it and many articles."</LD>
<TE>   According to the lore, one Joseph Glidden of DeKalb, Ill., put barbs
on wire to keep cows out of his wife's garden. Glidden's wire was
patented in 1874 (DeKalb actually spawned several "barbed-wire barons"),
and the stuff "won the West" as the handiest fencing material available
to homesteaders settling in Illinois, Iowa, the Dakotas and other
heartland states during the 1870s.  Resourceful wire producers seeking to
avoid paying royalties on existing patents developed about 500 varieties
by 1900, Sims says. Original barbed-wire property dividers can still be
found all over the Old West, says Sims, a former division engineer and
manager for the Halliburton Co. "Posts wear out long before the wire.
It's there almost forever."</TE>
<TE>   Today, he says, most "devil's rope" is made in Japan  and Belgium from
American materials and sells in 80-rod rolls, with a rod measuring a
quarter of a mile. The standard collector sample is an 18-inch piece long
enough to display two or three barbs, and some collectors even specialize
in the factory splices joining lengths of wire.</TE>
<TE>   While much collecting is now done by trade, "20 or 30 years ago you
could get it from ranchers who were nice about it if you told them you
were a collector. They would often go out and help you," says Sims, 70,
whose collection also includes an array of the different barbed wires
used by different nations in wartime.</TE>
<TE>   Sims has gone the way of many a collector and acquired new obsessions,
including monkey wrenches, pliers and threaded hub caps, but he still
displays 80 to 90 wire varieties in his home, and keeps an additional
1,000 samples for trading. He recently sold a rare piece of distinctive
"Phillips Cocklebur" wire for $800. "If you're collecting something, you
enjoy it while you have it, and then it goes to the next person to
enjoy."</TE>

<HD>The Devil You Know</HD>
<DH>Rape Is Never Fair, Especially If the Rapist Is Untouchable. But
Until Jeri Elster Stepped Forward, California's Rape Laws Weren't Fair
Either.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELBA NEWSOME</AU>
<BD>Melba Newsome is a freelance writer living in Matthews, N.C</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jeri Elster glances over the top of her glasses from time to time
as she plows through her prepared speech. She looks nervous and fragile.
Two weeks after completing chemotherapy and radiation treatments for
breast cancer, her skin is parched and drawn, her head covered by more
fuzz than hair. While her prognosis for a full recovery looks good, it's
too early to declare her a cancer survivor. Besides, she's not here to
talk about cancer.</LD>
<LD>   The mission she took on in the wake of an epic injustice can't wait.
Elster has come to Sacramento to tell a group of politicians about
surviving another attack on her body--the kind authorities say happens
every two minutes in America.</LD>
<LD>   "My name is Jeri Elster. I am a rape survivor," she tells the
California Assembly's Public Safety Committee. "I will never forget his
face or his voice--the memories continue to haunt me. I will live with
this trauma the rest of my life. I am here to put a human face on the
ramifications of the current laws governing sexual assault."</LD>
<TE>   The date was Feb. 29, 2000, the first time Elster had spoken so
publicly about the attack. She hasn't stopped talking since.</TE>
<TE>   Motion-detector lights spring on as soon as i step onto the sidewalk
in front of Elster's neat Westchester home. As I approach the door, two
dogs are at the front window, barking loudly. The sound of the doorbell
kicks them into high gear. Elster shuffles to the door, calling to them
to settle down as she flips the lock. Frankie and Johnny ignore her.
After I'm well-sniffed, Elster herds them out into the backyard, then
turns and smiles at me.</TE>
<TE>   Her hair, short now by design, is tinged with gray. Elster has just
completed the 60-mile route from Santa Barbara to Malibu as part of the
Avon 3-Day Breast Cancer Walk, and it still hurts to move. "I've got
blisters on top of my blisters," she says as she moves to a dining room
chair and sits. Nevertheless, her blue eyes light up as she offers
something to drink.</TE>
<TE>   This is the house she fell in love with and managed to buy when the
real estate market took a dive in 1991. This is where she ran her
home-based word processing and graphic arts business. This is also where
a brutal attack transformed her life. Thus the lights, the dogs, the
special windows and the solid wood doors.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 27, 1992, Elster fell asleep face down in bed while watching
TV at 1 a.m. She never heard the man cut the screen on her back window.
She slept soundly while he rummaged through her laundry on the back
porch. When she woke with a start, she was unable to move her arms or
legs. He was sitting on top of her, tying her hands behind her back. She
looked over her right shoulder and got a glimpse of the outline of his
head.</TE>
<TE>   "If you do that again, I'll kill you," he told her before wrapping her
head in a blanket. She couldn't struggle or scream as he blindfolded her
and proceeded to cut off her clothes with a pair of scissors he'd taken
from her kitchen drawer. For the next 2 1/2 hours, he raped and sodomized
her, stopping periodically to vandalize and rob her while she lay
helpless and blind.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to remember everything I could about him--the sound of his
voice, the outline of his head. Just in case I lived. But by the time it
was over, I was praying to die." Finally, when the house went quiet and
she suspected he was gone, Elster rolled to the edge of the bed, dropped
to the floor on her knees and crawled into the bathroom to get her
cuticle scissors to cut the restraints. Bleeding and bruised, she called
911. Police took her to the rape crisis center at Santa Monica Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Later she recounted to police the attack--every dehumanizing detail.
Her house was a crime scene. Officers dusted for fingerprints, collected
her clothes, the bedding and anything else they considered evidence. When
they left, Elster was alone to clean up the mess that had been made in
her home and her life.</TE>
<TE>   This is a story the 49-year-old Elster now has told dozens of times to
lawmakers, rape support groups, radio, TV and newspaper reporters--to
anyone willing to hear it. Recounting it, she seems almost removed, as if
it happened to someone else. But the brief flash of pain in her blue eyes
makes clear that it still hurts.</TE>
<TE>   The story of a rape isn't unusual, but Elster's has a twist: She knows
the name of the man of who raped her. So do law enforcement authorities.
Yet, California law at the time his name was discovered ensured that
Elster's attacker will never be prosecuted for what he did to her.
Changing that law gave Elster a new mission in life.</TE>
<TE>   long after that 1992 attack, elster learned that the process of
finding a rapist leaves much to be desired. If there is no suspect,
police take a report and file the matter as a "pending" case. Instead of
being analyzed for a DNA match in a criminal database, evidence collected
for a rape kit is tagged, numbered and shelved along with thousands of
others in an evidence cooler at the Los Angeles Police Department crime
lab.</TE>
<TE>   All 50 states collect DNA samples from convicted sex offenders. Some
collect it from all violent convicts. The FBI is coordinating a national
databank of DNA samples to help link perpetrators to unsolved crimes all
over the country. But until recently there has been no money to analyze
rape-kit evidence until a suspect is identified. According to a September
1999 survey conducted for the Attorney General's National Commission on
the Future of DNA Evidence, an estimated 150,000 rape kits are awaiting
analysis in the U.S. By now that number is estimated to be at least
180,000.</TE>
<TE>   At the LAPD crime lab, perishable evidence for every pending case is
housed in a freezer the size of an industrial meat locker. Just outside
on the loading dock, five refrigerated mobile trailers are also filled
with frozen evidence. Each evidence kit represents an unsolved crime, a
life on hold. The approximately 2,600 rape kits on the LAPD
shelves--among the estimated 20,000 untested kits in California--are
stored in envelopes that resemble giant packets of processed photos. The
majority of them haven't been touched since the evidence in them was
collected; Elster's rape kit sat untested for seven years.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics' National Crime Survey,
someone in America is sexually assaulted every two minutes. However, 72%
of sexual assaults are never reported. Of those that are, there's only a
16.3% chance the rapist will be imprisoned. Nineteen of 20 rapists will
never serve time. As the months and years wore on, Elster began to
believe her attacker would be one of the lucky ones.</TE>
<TE>   Elster, born and raised in Southern California, had encountered her
share of demons long before the stranger crept into her bedroom. She had
married briefly during her 20s and then had a string of disappointing
relationships. She had spent nearly 20 years drinking hard and smoking
dope. Then, on May 18, 1988, four years before the attack, she attended a
12-step meeting and declared herself an alcoholic. She has been clean and
sober since.</TE>
<TE>   After the attack, Elster says she became increasingly needy and
insecure, and it wasn't long before the relationship she was in fell
apart. She became depressed and suicidal and was eventually committed to
an inpatient psychiatric facility for 30 days. Through it all, Elster
resisted her old addictions.</TE>
<TE>   "It occurred to me to drink again, but that would be giving power back
to the rapist, and I couldn't do that," she says. "He had ruined my life
in so many areas, I couldn't drink over it. This became even more of a
reason to stay sober."</TE>
<TE>   With counseling and support from friends, Elster accepted what had
happened to her while choosing not to give up the search for her
attacker. For a time, she called the police almost every month. Each time
the answer was the same: "No leads." Sometimes she even got an impatient,
"Do you know how many rape cases we have?"</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, a friend sent her a newspaper article about a man recently
convicted of several rapes in the South Bay area. His method was
chillingly similar to that of her attacker's. Elster sent the article to
the detective in charge of her case and asked him to investigate. He
never responded.</TE>
<TE>   "Finally I decided I needed to heal and separate myself from it, so I
gave up on it for years and went to work putting my life back together. I
went to work full time again--the first time since the attack."</TE>
<TE>   Elster joined the Rainbow Sisters Project, a multiracial support group
formed by Santa Monica rape survivor and filmmaker Karen Pomer. In
addition to discovering women who understood--they'd been there--she also
learned that, with the exception of murder, all crimes carried a statute
of limitations, a defined date beyond which a crime can no longer be
prosecuted. Worried that the statute on her case was running out, Elster
made one more effort to jump start the investigation in April 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Det. Richard Guzman had been on the LAPD force for six years when he
was assigned to the sex crimes division. He'd been there two weeks--not
long enough to be annoyed by a victim's persistence--when Elster called
to check the status of her case.</TE>
<TE>   "This was my first assignment to sex crimes," Guzman recalls. "Jeri
asked about the status, but there was no paperwork at the station. The
case was in storage, and I ordered it shipped here. She told me about a
newspaper article where a man had been convicted of rape in Hawthorne.
When I ran his criminal history and found he had a blood sample on file,
I called the crime lab and asked them to analyze the rape kit."</TE>
<TE>   Because of limited resources, the crime lab usually screens rape kits
only at the request of a detective or a district attorney. LAPD
criminalist Elizabeth Swanson screened the kit and Elster's clothing and
found thousands of specimens, a crucial first step because nearly 50% of
rape kits contain no evidence. Before proceeding with a DNA analysis,
though, the lab needed to make sure the statute had not expired.</TE>
<TE>   "Running each sample [for DNA] costs around $900, and you need [to
run] the victim's current sample, a sample from the rape kit, plus a new
sample from the [suspected] attacker," says Swanson. "We didn't want to
go through the trouble and expense for a case that could not be
adjudicated."</TE>
<TE>   Guzman asked around the squad room about the statute of limitations on
rape cases. He got varying answers--six, seven and eight years. After a
deputy  district attorney assured him that the rape statute was eight
years, the investigation inched forward.</TE>
<TE>   "The delays in getting the scientific tests done were frustrating
because the resources were limited," he says. "When I requested the first
DNA analysis, [bureaucratic delays] took a few months. Everybody was
frustrated by the process, even the people who work the scientific
division."</TE>
<TE>   The delays are designed, in part, to ensure fairness. The specimen
from the rape kit was compared to everyone's in the offender
databank--70,000 people at the time--not just the suspect's. They got a
match--but not with the man described in the newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   A report issued by Maryland-based Cellmark Diagnostics, one of the
country's top private DNA labs, matched the DNA from Elster's attacker
with a DNA sample on file from Reginald Darrell Miller, a 50-year-old
L.A.-area man with a criminal record dating back to the mid-1960s.
Several weeks after the attack on Elster, he had been arrested for
committing a rape and robbery. Miller had been convicted and was serving
a 15-year sentence at the state Correctional Training Facility at
Soledad, near Salinas.</TE>
<TE>   To confirm the match, Guzman obtained a court order to draw Miller's
blood to make sure it matched the original sample on file. In late
November 1999, another Cellmark test confirmed that Jeri Elster's rape
kit was loaded with Miller's DNA.</TE>
<TE>   Six months before that revelation, elster had been diagnosed</TE>
<TE>   with breast cancer and spent the summer and fall undergoing treatment.
When she and Guzman were summoned to the D.A.'s office Dec. 10 that year,
she dragged herself out of bed. "I thought we were going to discuss trial
strategy, but the [prosecutor] told me she had good news and bad news,"
Elster says.</TE>
<TE>   The good news was that Elster wouldn't have to go through the trauma
of a trial. The bad news was that they couldn't prosecute Miller despite
the DNA evidence. The statute of limitations for rape in California was
six years, not eight. The deputy district attorney who initially had
assured Guzman it was OK to proceed with Elster's case admitted that she
had erred. Miller will be released from prison in 2007, the prosecutor
told Elster, and there wasn't anything they could do about it.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't believe it. I was furious," Elster says. "Do you know how
stupid that is--a D.A. not knowing the statute of limitations on rape?"</TE>
<TE>   Elster's case illustrates how effective use of DNA evidence can
revolutionize the way crime is fought. Not since fingerprinting has law
enforcement had such a powerful ally. DNA evidence has also become the
mother of all defense weapons, exonerating dozens of inmates in
post-conviction cases across the country. Unfortunately, because of
chronic shortages of funding and manpower, law enforcement officials in
virtually every state are way behind in efforts to analyze those DNA
samples.</TE>
<TE>   In August, U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft announced that the Justice
Department would give nearly $30 million to states to ease the backlog of
criminal DNA testing. However, Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) and Sen.
Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) want more.</TE>
<TE>   Maloney has announced plans to introduce legislation to standardize
evidence kits for sexual assaults and ensure that forensic labs complete
all DNA testing within 10 days of receipt. Her bill also would spend $150
million to train more sexual-assault nurse examiners nationwide and thus
reduce the number of unsolved rape cases pending. Schumer's bill would
expand sexual assault forensic examiner programs nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the greatest irony is that the mix-up in the District
Attorney's office proved to be a good thing. Had the deputy D.A. given
Guzman the correct information about the statute of limitations, Elster's
file would have remained in the archives and she still wouldn't know the
identity of her attacker.</TE>
<TE>   "It was all divinely ordained," she says. "I realized that these
screw-ups had to lead to something. It was like somebody pushed a button
inside me, and I couldn't let go." In the meantime, Elster has been
pursuing her own remedy. It was too late to change the outcome of her
case, but she wanted to make sure no one else would suffer the same fate.</TE>
<TE>   When Elster told fellow rape survivor Karen Pomer that she wanted to
change the law, Pomer asked a simple question: "Would you go public?"
Suddenly, the shame that had kept Elster quiet about the attack vanished.</TE>
<TE>   Lou Correa (D-Santa Ana) had been in the California assembly for only
a few months, but already he had developed an interest in how DNA
technology was changing criminal justice. When an Orange County district
attorney brought the backlog of samples and the six-year statute of
limitations on rape to Correa's attention, he began trying to create
legislation to address the problem.</TE>
<TE>   Statute of limitations originally were intended to make sure that
accused criminals were prosecuted fairly and not convicted by faulty
memories or deteriorated evidence. Correa felt that DNA has no memory
and, therefore, many of the old arguments for a statute of limitations no
longer seemed valid.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the DNA forensic databank mandated by the California
Assembly contains about 200,000 offender specimens, the Legislature had
failed to appropriate money to analyze them. Correa struggled to come up
with a bill that would address the problem, get around the statute and
preserve the necessary safeguards.</TE>
<TE>   Elster signed on for the fight. She anticipated a long, protracted
battle, but like the advances in technology, the changes came with
lightning speed. Elster told her story before the Assembly Public Safety
Committee on Feb. 29, 2000. The following June, she testified before the
Senate Public Safety Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis signed the Correa bill into law two months after that,
and it took effect last January. It extends the statute of limitations to
10 years and effectively eliminates it in rape cases where DNA evidence
can be used to identify the perpetrator. The state budget in 2000 also
allocated millions to help process  the mountains of backlogged cases,
giving new life to those 20,000 rape kits in evidence freezers across the
state. In August, Inglewood police announced the first "cold hit" from
that effort and linked a registered sex offender to the rape of a
14-year-old girl that had gone unsolved for six years.</TE>
<TE>   "Jeri was very instrumental in helping us pass this legislation,"
Correa says. "Lou Correa making a statement about rape is one thing. Jeri
Elster standing up and saying, 'I got raped' is another. It was
tremendously powerful, and nobody was left unconvinced."</TE>
<TE>   Chris Leo, Correa's chief of staff, says Elster's testimony was so
effective that Assembly members had tears in their eyes. "Without her, it
never would have moved forward as quickly as it did. Jeri put a face on
the issue."</TE>
<TE>   Other states are revising laws involving sexual assaults. Florida,
Michigan and Nevada have dropped the statute of limitations on rape cases
involving DNA evidence. In Arizona, Hawaii, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New
York and Wisconsin, lawmakers are now reexamining similar statutes.</TE>
<TE>   Those efforts are among many others in which legislators are trying to
bring laws into line with new technologies.</TE>
<TE>   During last year's Super Bowl, for example, Tampa Bay police conducted
a high-tech surveillance experiment by scanning the faces of the game's
72,000 attendees and checking them against a database of criminals.
Concerned privacy activists dubbed the experiment a "computerized police
lineup."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Supreme Court recently ruled that police violated Danny Lee
Kyllo's 4th Amendment rights when they used heat-detection equipment to
find a hothouse marijuana operation in Kyllo's Oregon home.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of police departments also are using the "PAS III Sniffer"
(Passive Alcohol Sensor), a tiny battery-powered alcohol detector, during
traffic stops. An officer shines a flashlight into a car and the device
sucks in the motorist's breath to check for alcohol. The motorist never
has a clue.</TE>
<TE>   Challenges to the way new technologies are being used are making their
way through the courts, but some feel the law will forever be one step
behind science. And people such as Jeri Elster may continue to fall into
that gap.</TE>
<TE>   Elster has every right to be bitter. In the past 15 years, she has
battled alcohol, drugs, rape, cancer and a legal system that let her
down. Through it all, she has remained kind and warm, a glass-half-full
survivor who "did not want to define myself forever as a victim.
Generally, my healing has come from taking action, sharing with others
and using my story to turn my worst liability into my best asset."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Elster is gearing up for another fight. She intends to do
everything she can to keep Reginald Miller locked up beyond 2007, using
the state's Sexually Violent Predator Act.</TE>
<TE>   When he finishes his sentence, Elster plans to testify that Miller is
a serial rapist who should be confined to the state hospital at
Atascadero, the maximum-security mental health facility now used as a
rehabilitation center for convicted rapists and child molesters.</TE>
<TE>   "If that happens, justice will be served," Elster says. "And that's
all I ever really wanted."</TE>

<HD>Giving Up On America</HD>
<DH>Valery Itzkevitch Arrived Here From Eastern Europe With a Job and a
Dream. But He Neglected to Read the Jewish Immigrant Script.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BENJAMIN SMITH</AU>
<BD>Benjamin Smith is a former Baltic correspondent for the Wall Street
Journal Europe</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last year, Scott Spolin got the opportunity to repay an old debt.
The chance came in the slim, 25-year-old form of Valery Itzkevitch, who
walked into Spolin's law office one sunny afternoon. What Spolin saw in
the young man from Eastern Europe was a chance to share his own family's
immigrant success story.</LD>
<LD>   The two men sat together in Spolin's spare office--the guest neat and
formal, with a black suit and elegant, creaky English; the host compact,
casual and blunt. The older man was struck by Itzkevitch's story: He was
a Jew from Riga, the capital of Latvia, a lawyer who wanted to learn
American law, and a father who wanted to bring his wife and son to
America.</LD>
<LD>   Spolin, 56, is a partner in the small, prosperous business law
practice of Spolin, Silverman, Cohen &amp; Bartlett. He was born in Los
Angeles, and his parents were born in Chicago. His favorite grandfather
was Morris Spolin, a Jewish sheet-metal worker who came to Chicago from
what is now Latvia in 1908. The Spolin family's trek from East to West
and from working class to professional is a familiar one to American
Jews. "Maybe this kid's grandparents lived next door to my grandparents'
parents," Spolin marveled to himself.</LD>
<TE>   Half an hour into their conversation, he offered Itzkevitch a job. For
Spolin, it was a privilege. Ninety years after his Latvian grandfather
struggled in a new land, the grandson had a chance to ameliorate the
suffering of another immigrant family from Latvia. "It's the same
country, it's the same immigration, it's the same America," Spolin said
to himself.</TE>
<TE>   More than 3 million Jews have come to the United States in the last
two centuries. They arrived in waves, the most recent being the flood of
Soviet Jews that started as a trickle in the 1960s. More than 45,000
Soviet Jews came to America in 1992 alone, according to the Hebrew
Immigrant Aid Society. Since the early '70s, about 120,000 Soviet Jews
came to Southern California, many to West Hollywood. But the wave was cut
short in the '90s as the former Soviet Union turned into a set of more or
less democratic societies, and American immigration authorities no longer
assumed that Jews automatically met the asylum criterion of a
"well-founded fear of persecution."</TE>
<TE>   "In the days of the communists, it was hard to get out but easy to get
refugee status," says Jonathan D. Sarna, professor of American Jewish
history at Brandeis University. "After the Communists fell, it was easier
to get out but harder to get refugee status."</TE>
<TE>   All Morris Spolin had needed to come to America was a one-way ticket
and a strong back. Soviet-era refugees needed only the will to start from
scratch. But if Valery Itzkevitch wanted to come to America, he had to
find a job and keep it. His future would depend on fulfilling Scott
Spolin's expectations.</TE>
<TE>   I met Valery Itzkevitch the day he formed his secret plan to come to
America. We were both living in Riga, and on that evening in February
2000, we had each driven out to a dreary suburb to attend the birthday
party of a prosperous young Russian-Jewish banker. About 20 boisterous
young men and mostly silent young women toasted the guest of honor around
a long table laid with cold meat and syrupy cranberry vodka.</TE>
<TE>   The couple across the table from me seemed different from their
friends. Itzkevitch was slightly built and reserved. His wife, Maya,
looked and acted as if she came from a sunnier place; she had olive skin,
glittering dark eyes and a loud, biting sense of humor.</TE>
<TE>   Halfway through dinner, Itzkevitch told me he had done something
whimsical: British Airways was offering tickets from Riga to Los Angeles
for just $299, and he had bought one for a two-week vacation. What
Itzkevitch didn't tell me, or his friends, or even his wife that evening,
was that he saw the trip to America as a chance to escape.</TE>
<TE>   At first glance, the 25-year-old lawyer seemed an unlikely emigre. He
wasn't a beleaguered shtetl Jew who had to settle for manual labor, like
Spolin's grandfather. His story hardly matched the pathos of famous tales
of the Jewish emigre, an archetype that reached its peak in Abraham
Cahan's 1917 novel "The Rise of David Levinsky," before its reduction to
an animated mouse in Steven Spielberg's "An American Tail." In Cahan's
classic book, the hero leaves Russia broke and hungry. His mother has
just been killed in a pogrom. He arrives speaking only Yiddish, and rises
from street peddler to textile magnate.</TE>
<TE>   Itzkevitch had never seen "An American Tail" or read anything from
that particularly American genre, the immigration narrative. He was
trying to change his life, and he knew only dimly that he was stepping
into the treacherous waters of a Great American Story. In contrast to
Spolin's ancestors, and most immigrants of the 40-year Great Wave, which
started in the 1880s, Itzkevitch was already materially comfortable,
professionally successful, proficient in English. To his peers in Latvia,
in fact, he seemed a rising star, a young man who had made all the right
choices since his generation's defining moment, the fall of the Soviet
Union.</TE>
<TE>   When the Soviet Union began to totter, Russian speakers in Latvia,
including most of the country's Jews, faced a difficult decision. As
anti-Soviet as many were, they still feared the rising tide of ethnic
Latvian nationalism that was bound up in the country's independence
movement. Some chose to stand with the losing Soviet side, while others
worked to learn the Latvian language and integrate themselves into the
new nation. Itzkevitch learned Latvian. He was a talented piano player,
but he also realized that there would be little place for musicians in
the tough new economy. He dropped out of the conservatory and switched to
law school.</TE>
<TE>   By the beginning of 2000, he had risen to be head of the legal
department in the leasing arm of the Latvian branch of the Baltics'
largest financial group. He had married Maya Fisherman, a pianist who
worked processing the insurance claims of Holocaust survivors. They were
raising a 2-year-old son, Phillip.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Spolin heard some of this from Itzkevitch in their first
meeting. But Spolin was more impressed by Itzkevitch's reasons for
leaving than for staying. Those reasons were disturbingly familiar to
Spolin, the descendant of Jewish immigrants: Itzkevitch was a Jew, and
his wife and child were Jewish. At work, he heard the word "yid" tossed
around by colleagues, who knew well that he was the only Jew in the
company. Though he tried to ignore it, one co-worker remembers him
returning from a meeting stunned by an anti-Semitic remark. "He said he
forgot, but I think it hurt in his heart," said Indra Lipnicka.</TE>
<TE>   The private slurs were matched by occasional public images. A reminder
of why Itzkevitch wanted to leave came in August 2000, a few months after
he returned from America, when Kapitals, a glossy Latvian version of
Forbes, featured on its cover a hook-nosed, black-hatted Jew clutching
the globe between bejeweled claws. The headline: "Jews Rule the World."</TE>
<TE>   Itzkevitch and his wife worried most about their son. While Valery has
pale skin, high cheekbones and straight hair from his Russian father,
Phillip resembles Maya. He has curly brown hair and brown skin that turns
chocolate when they vacation with Maya's family in Israel. In Latvia,
they are usually the darkest people in the room, and Valery winces when
he sees passers-by pull their children away from Phillip or whisper
"monkey." "They treat us like zoo animals here," Maya says.</TE>
<TE>   And so Itzkevitch set off for America on March 25, 2000, with the
vaguest of plans. He had searched the Internet for Los Angeles lawyers,
at one point coming across Sara Caplan, a member of the O.J. Simpson
defense team. He had quietly inquired after friends of friends. He left
with a short list of prospects. But he had little hope of finding a job
in two weeks; it was more a reconnaissance mission.</TE>
<TE>   When Itzkevitch arrived, his problems multiplied. He was staying in
Orange County with a former piano teacher, who had left Latvia earlier,
and he was dependent on her to drive him to interviews. Housebound, he
missed his meeting with Caplan. An acquaintance e-mailed him the name of
another Los Angeles lawyer. She was retired, but she passed on the names
of three more Los Angeles lawyers. He called two of them and one, Scott
Spolin, returned his call.</TE>
<TE>   Spolin's simple willingness to meet in the middle of Itzkevitch's
first week came as a surprise. And his spontaneous generosity seemed too
good to be true. Itzkevitch had already fallen in love with Los
Angeles--with the unexpected "sense of freedom." At first he tried to
imagine an ulterior motive, and found none. "I didn't expect such
sincerity. I didn't know that people like [Spolin] existed in America,"
Itzkevitch said.</TE>
<TE>   I assured him that such people do, indeed, exist. And I saw in him a
way to tell the story of the Jewish immigrant experience: superficially
modified by a century of technology, but basically unchanged. And--it
goes without saying--inevitably successful.</TE>
<TE>   Itzkevitch left for Latvia on april 8, and Spolin sponsored his
application for an H-1B visa, a category reserved for workers with higher
education, who routinely convert it after six years into permanent
residency. Under the conditions of the visa, Spolin was also required to
pay his new employee the "prevailing wage"--$55,000-- for the legal work
he intended to assign him, along with some processing fees. Spolin paid
the fees gladly, but as the arrival of his new employee approached, he
found himself with a new concern. Sure, he had hired Itzkevitch for
sentimental reasons, but the young man was "a trained lawyer and a smart
cookie." He didn't consider him a charity case, and didn't want his
partners and employees to treat him like one. So Spolin didn't tell
anyone why he had hired a lawyer trained in Latvia, with no knowledge of
American legal jargon and no experience in an American workplace. Spolin
believed Itzkevitch would "hit the floor running" and didn't worry too
much about the details.</TE>
<TE>   "This is how America is supposed to work," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Itzkevitch arrived in the United States for the second time Feb. 16,
2001, during an unexpectedly cold, damp spell. He found that his good job
and high salary didn't protect him from the loneliness of any immigrant.
"I had never been so alone in my life," he said at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Itzkevitch took an airy two-bedroom apartment in West Hollywood, but
he didn't feel at home with the Soviet Jewish refugees who populate the
neighborhood. A young professional, he was more comfortable in the
gay-oriented cafes that make up West Hollywood's other face. He shopped
at a Ralphs supermarket on Sunset and across the boulevard at a
Russian-Jewish shop called Shalom. He prepared his apartment for Maya and
Phillip's arrival in May. He borrowed money from his former piano
teacher's husband to put down a deposit on a used Mitsubishi.</TE>
<TE>   The trouble at work came first in the form of little slights.
Itzkevitch's salary was generous, but he wasn't given health insurance
like other employees. Everyone else parked in the basement of the Water
Garden, but Itzkevitch had to leave his car every morning by the Santa
Monica dump, a 10-minute walk away.</TE>
<TE>   Benefits "were not part of the deal," Spolin said.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, Itzkevitch had a more pressing worry: He had nothing to do. On
his first visit, he said, he had asked Spolin repeatedly if he could
really find a place in the firm, and the American lawyer had told him not
to worry. But once Itzkevitch was firmly planted in his shared,
windowless white office, he often found himself idle. In Latvia, he had
written contracts and negotiated deals. Now, he filed, made photocopies
and studied American law. He typed a 14-page legal dictionary.</TE>
<TE>   "The main thing is to become useful for Scott," he wrote in an e-mail
in early March. "I strive for it but I already see that it will take a
long time."</TE>
<TE>   Within weeks of his new employee's arrival, Spolin began to worry.
Itzkevitch didn't seem "plugged in" to the small, fast-moving office. He
didn't file as well as the file clerk, and didn't copy as well as the
secretary. He had to be taught how to use the legal databases. He was,
Spolin worried, "tremendously unproductive."</TE>
<TE>   Spolin was eager to help Itzkevitch, but he wanted to help him work.
Underemployed, Itzkevitch turned to studying, in the hope that he could
pass the California bar examination in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "He got involved in some fantasy that he was going to get a law degree
and his focus was there," Spolin said. What Itzkevitch didn't do was live
up to Spolin's  ideal of the tough, hungry immigrant who fights to make a
place for himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I expected him to do what my grandparents did," Spolin said. "I
expected him to scrabble and scuffle and do what he needed to do."</TE>
<TE>   On May 18, Spolin called his newest employee into his office.
Itzkevitch waited while his boss spoke on the phone; he was happy to have
been summoned and hoped that Spolin would finally give him the kind of
challenging assignment--writing contracts, for example--that he'd been
waiting for. Instead, Spolin told him he had three months to find a new
job. He offered the young lawyer his best wishes and a glowing
recommendation. He said he thought Itzkevitch could find a place in
another firm and succeed in American law.</TE>
<TE>   Itzkevitch had been with Spolin, Silverman, Cohen &amp; Bartlett for two
months and two weeks. He was devastated. He was angry at Spolin, who, he
said, had assured him repeatedly that there would be enough work for him.
He regretted quitting his job in Riga. Maya had already quit her job and
planned to join him in late May. Now her trip would be a long vacation.</TE>
<TE>   Itzkevitch was required to leave or find a new sponsor. (He sent out
more resumes but heard back from no one; head hunters told him they
didn't deal with foreign lawyers.) The Immigration and Naturalization
Service rarely deports H-1B holders, but Itzkevitch wanted to toe the
legal line; he didn't want to hurt his chances of getting an American
visa in the future. And so he and Maya had to leave the country, change
his visa status or apply for asylum. Maya's dark skin and work for Jewish
organizations made her a good candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Like Scott Spolin, i had a clear image of how immigrants are supposed
to behave. I expected Itzkevitch to go to any lengths to stay in America,
including the weeks, and potentially months, of uncertainty and
unemployment that come with applying for asylum. But Itzkevitch didn't
know how the story was supposed to go; he had a family to support, and
concrete choices to make. Maya was bored in Los Angeles, with little
English, no friends and no driver's license. Itzkevitch had an attractive
job offer from Latvia's biggest bank.  Sitting on his West Hollywood
balcony, looking down over Los Angeles, he said, "You see that I
absolutely don't want to go back."</TE>
<TE>   Then he gave up his lease, put his wife and son on a plane, and spent
his last few days in America at Simona Shuel's house in Woodland Hills,
surrounded by what he could have had.</TE>
<TE>   Shuel, 29, is also a Jew from Riga; her parents know Itzkevitch's
mother. But her family had gotten out while the getting was good, in
1991. A plain-spoken computer programmer with short blond hair, she
personifies the immigrant success story. A decade ago, she was an asylum
seeker, working at Astroburger in West Hollywood. Now she's a citizen and
vice president at Countrywide Home Loans, married, with a son and a
Lexus. Her ranch house in the Valley is what Itzkevitch's stuccoed
apartment in West Hollywood wasn't: solid.</TE>
<TE>   Lounging by her pool on his last day in Los Angeles, Itzkevitch's big
eyes had a defeated look. He considered one last time tearing up his
return ticket, attempting to follow the path Shuel's family had a decade
earlier and applying for asylum. But the risk was too great. There was
the job in Riga. And what would Maya and Phillip live on while he waited
for months for an answer from the INS?</TE>
<TE>   "Where will I live?" he asked. "What will I do? And if I am denied, I
will never be able to visit the U.S. again." He paused. "It's a risk. I
don't know what to do."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, neither the charms of Los Angeles nor the fears for his
son's future were enough to persuade Itzkevitch to drop everything. On
July 11, he was in Los Angeles International Airport, shaking his head in
wonder as a group of Southern California high schoolers surreptitiously
filmed a Chasidic Jew at prayer. He stepped onto the plane, braced for
the "shower of questions" that would inevitably meet his return to Riga.</TE>
<TE>   The awkward questions have come and gone. Within weeks of his return,
Itzkevitch was more prosperous than he had ever been. His salary is
comparable to what he was earning in Los Angeles and goes a lot further.
But he still worries about his son, and he still dreams of returning to
L.A.</TE>
<TE>   It is comforting to believe that he will return. After all, immigrants
persevere and succeed. Jewish grandfathers are sheet-metal workers, their
grandsons are lawyers. That optimistic narrative is part of the American
religion, and it is particularly embedded for Jews and other groups who
arrived in the first half of the 20th century.</TE>
<TE>   In the American Old Testament, the optimistic narrative comes right
after Exodus, and it always has a happy ending. Indeed, Itzkevitch is
confident he can make it here, and has considered flying back someday to
take the California bar examination.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Spolin still wonders where exactly Itzkevitch's story got off
track. "I was trying to help him do what he wanted to do. Maybe I made it
too easy for him," he speculated after Itzkevitch left last summer. "It
cost me a couple of bucks and he's unhappy and it's dislocated his life,
but there's nothing that I would have done differently."</TE>
<TE>   Valery Itzkevitch fell in with immigrants' descendants who pinned
their high hopes to him. But this is not 1900s America, and while
immigration continues to drive the United States forward, Jewish
immigration is now basically over. Itzkevitch and other European Jews are
neither as welcome, nor as desperate, as they once were.</TE>
<TE>   What remains to Jews, as to many other Americans, is the powerful myth
of the young person from the Old Country. Spolin was attending to that
tradition when he offered Itzkevitch a job. I was observing the same
faith when I imagined Itzkevitch's success as inevitable. But for all the
power of that belief, immigration is always new to the immigrant. Neither
the animated mouse of "An American Tail" nor Spolin's grandfather offered
Itzkevitch much comfort when he sat on his balcony in West Hollywood,
deciding what to do with his life.</TE>

<HD>My Cold, Dark Place</HD>
<DH>Fallout From the Bomb That Never Came</DH>

<BD>Patti Paniccia is a former CNN correspondent and the author of

<DL></DL>
<LD>I came home from school one day and it was part of my life--my bomb
shelter. Actually, it wasn't all there that first day; they'd only just
started building it. It would be several weeks before the gaping pit in
our driveway in Eagle Rock would evolve into living quarters for a family
of six trying to escape the atomic bomb.</LD>
<LD>   I was 9 in the winter of 1961. The Cold War had just got off to an
explosive start, and with Cuba pointing Soviet missiles at the United
States, President Kennedy was encouraging Americans to prepare for war.</LD>
<LD>   For several weeks, the jackhammers pounded and echoed from my
driveway, disrupting the serenity of my usually quiet neighborhood. One
afternoon I returned home from school to find them lying silent and
lifeless at the bottom of what had become a 30-foot-deep crater. It was
where my friends and I had played tetherball; now it was to be my
underground home when the bomb came.</LD>
<TE>   The cement was poured next--to keep out the radiation. At least that's
what the cement salesman told my father. "Five-foot-thick walls," he
said, "and we guarantee you'll withstand any atomic bomb." Every evening,
after the workers left, I'd lower myself into the pit and carefully
measure each wall, envisioning myself on a dangerous but vital mission to
ensure that the walls were thick enough. I trembled at the thought that a
sloppy worker might have poured one of them even a millimeter short of
the required five feet.</TE>
<TE>   "Mom," I remember asking one evening after completing my measurements,
"I'm not quite sure I understand how Dad could collect if this five-foot
radiation guarantee doesn't hold up."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, don't worry about those things," my mother replied. "You'll have
your driveway back to play tetherball soon enough, and you won't even
know the bomb shelter's there." I said nothing but immediately retreated
to my bedroom, stunned. Tetherball? Did she really believe that my main
concern was tetherball? That I'd forget about a 9,000-cubic-foot hole in
the middle of our driveway?</TE>
<TE>   Our home was built on a slope, so to get into the bomb shelter we had
to walk out our front door, turn left and go to the end of the property.
There we'd descend a narrow wooden staircase that took two right turns,
forming a U-shaped course. The stairs ended facing the entrance--the
first of three doors. This door was made of prison-like bars with a
padlock that held it closed. Immediately after passing through this first
door, we would make another right turn and face the second door, a
monstrous floor-to-ceiling piece of inch-thick dark green metal. Once
inside this second door, we would walk through a 20-foot-long concrete
tunnel where a single lightbulb hung from above. At the end of the tunnel
was a third door, exactly like the second one. This third and final door
led into the main room, or what the pharaohs would have called the inner
chamber. It was a perfect rectangle, 25 feet long and 12 feet wide, and
it always smelled faintly of fresh concrete. What confused and troubled
me most, however, was something my father told me the day construction
began. "When the sirens go off," he said, "we can't let our friends and
neighbors in. There won't be enough food or water for everybody."</TE>
<TE>   With shame and embarrassment I confessed the sad news to my best
friend, Michele. "I'm sorry, but you may as well know now. When the
atomic bomb comes, I can't let you in my bomb shelter." Michele wrinkled
her eyebrows and looked at me the way she did whenever I stepped on the
sidewalk snails we encountered while walking to school. And then she
laughed. I laughed too, but late that night I trembled in bed as I
imagined her screaming and pounding on the thick metal door while the
sirens wailed.</TE>
<TE>   I imagined radiation to look like pinkish fairy dust, sprinkled across
my lawn, covering the roof of my house. The sparkles would drizzle down
on the entire neighborhood, covering trees and lights posts--and people
unlucky enough to be outside when it happened. People like Michele. Maybe
Michele would be there when we reopened the door. Maybe by some miracle
she would manage to avoid the poisoned fairy dust. I prayed it would be
so and pictured a thousand different ways how that fateful day might play
out.</TE>
<TE>   Word soon got around school that I had a bomb shelter. Two other
children in my class also claimed they had bomb shelters, but after
debriefing them I knew they merely had basements stacked with canned
food. "How thick are your walls?" I asked, and then silently shook my
head. I took it upon myself to make sure that everyone in my class knew
the difference between a real bomb shelter and a basement.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually the entire school recognized me as a bomb shelter expert--a
consultant, of sorts, who would listen as kids described their makeshift
shelters and escape plans. I'd then inform them how effective (or
ineffective) their bomb shelters would be. Usually the news was not good.
Many asked whether they could use my bomb shelter. "Sorry," I said. "My
bomb shelter's full." And at the end of the day, I'd make a mental
checklist of those of us who would live and those who would die.</TE>
<TE>   Once the major construction was finished, my mother began decorating
in such a manner that none of us would mind spending all of those days
down there. She carpeted the bomb shelter in yellow and bought two
lime-green Naugahyde couches, but no beds. Perhaps it was more
appropriate to sit and chat while the bombs dropped and Michele pounded
on the door.</TE>
<TE>   My mother put in a portable electric heater, but it always stayed cold
down there. It could also be darker than pitch when the lights were
turned out. My siblings and I often played a cruel game on each other,
turning out the lights and closing the door with someone left inside.</TE>
<TE>   My father built some wooden cupboards and my mom painted them green
and filled them with cans of tuna, jars of peanut butter and packages of
Melba toast. We were ready. Or so I thought.</TE>
<TE>   A short time after the bomb shelter was finished, my brother announced
that he was leaving home. He was 19 and wanted to get an apartment by the
beach in Santa Monica. The beach was 25 miles away! How could he possibly
make it to the bomb shelter in time? I was horrified. How could he even
consider such a thing? I pictured him by the shore when the bomb came,
alone and crying with none of us there to comfort him, little pink waves
lapping at his feet.</TE>
<TE>   My parents also were concerned about him living on his own. They all
began shouting at one another. I ran out of the room and continued to
listen from my bedroom. Their shouts grew louder and my head began to
hurt. I played out the pink-wave scenario in my head over and over. Soon
I could no longer hear their voices because of my own screaming.
Everything went black, and when I awoke I was lying on my parents' bed,
looking up at the three of them. I fell onto my knees and prayed to God
for a miracle.</TE>
<TE>   The bomb never came. Something else, though, came in its place: a
blinding flash of insight that tore open the entire tapestry around my
9-year-old existence. I learned that life's worries were much bigger than
I had ever imagined.</TE>
<TE>   And then the oddest thing happened--I never had to fully wrestle with
this new concept. Instead I busied myself with a thousand childhood
distractions. As the Cuban missile crisis defused, I filled my days with
the familiar routines of life before my bomb shelter. And in the evenings
after dinner, I often played tetherball.</TE>
<TE>   As the weeks and months passed, my family found other uses for the
bomb shelter. At first it housed our winter clothing and seasonal fishing
gear. Then it became a sort of halfway house for junk that we no longer
needed but weren't quite ready to part with.</TE>
<TE>   As the years went by, we used it less and less until we sort of forgot
it was there. The wooden steps leading to the entrance rotted out, and my
father never replaced them. Eventually, on the surface, everything seemed
completely normal, just as it once had been, just as my mother had said
it would.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, somehow, things were never quite the same for me after the winter
of 1961--the coldest winter of my life.</TE>

<AU>ADAM TSCHORN</AU>
<BD>Adam Tschorn is a freelance humor writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I have a recurring dream. In it, I've been awarded one of those big
prizes--a Pulitzer or an Emmy. I take to the stage to make my acceptance
speech, open my mouth and start to speak. My first words are: "I'd like
to thank my father-in-law, without whom I'd be standing here naked."</LD>
<LD>   I first met Richard Moore more than a dozen years ago, across the
counter at my parents' Wayside Country Store in rural Vermont. He was
faxing his daughter's college applications on the only machine around for
miles, and I was working the register. It never dawned on me that I was
talking to my future father-in-law. Or that this man, with the help of a
Hong Kong tailor, would one day be my fashion mentor.</LD>
<LD>   About a decade later, Richard and I unexpectedly found ourselves in
New York City on the same weekend. We had yet to eyeball each other since
I'd popped the question to his daughter six months earlier, and when he
told me to be at suite 237 at the Plaza Hotel at 3 p.m., visions of the
shower-and-chain saw scene from "Scarface" raced through my mind. But no
revenge murder was planned. Richard had decided that if I was going to
marry his daughter, I needed to know who wore the pants in the
family--and who made those pants. I was about to get fitted for some
hand-sewn dress clothes from his tailor, whom he had found through a
newspaper ad several years before.</LD>
<TE>   My first fashion role model was, as it is for many men, my own father.
His sense of style came from the "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" school
of thought. Throughout my childhood, he had hanging in his closet (in
case of a formal emergency, such as a lottery win or shotgun wedding)
exactly one brown tweed jacket, one beige striped dress shirt, one pair
of brown dress pants and one already-knotted necktie--all purchased at
the local Mammoth Mart.</TE>
<TE>   Day to day he wore regular rotations of off-brand jeans and plaid
flannel shirts, except during Vermont's few days of warm weather. Then he
would break out an accumulated stash of freebie T-shirts that advertised
everything from motor oil to cigarettes. By the time August rolled
around, my dad had me sporting more logos than a NASCAR driver. As an
adult I struggled to adapt this log cabin look to my position as a
newspaper editor. But somehow it never quite fit. My endless permutations
of Gap khakis, B.D. Baggies button-down shirts and black Reeboks with--my
fiancee never lets me forget--white tube socks left me feeling neither
mature nor professional.</TE>
<TE>   The name Richard Moore probably won't ever be whispered in the same
breath as Gary Cooper's or Cary Grant's, but the guy does have a certain
look. He gives the impression of perpetually teetering on the edge of
formality. Even on the weekends, when he sports jeans instead of dress
pants, he still wears a dress shirt and jacket to dinner--even if it's at
McDonald's. No one in the family can ever recall seeing his knees (though
the range of motion in his legs indicate they do, indeed, exist). He does
enjoy a jaunty accessory or two--a pair of argyle socks or something from
his extensive collection of cufflinks. And above all, his standards are
exacting.</TE>
<TE>   Making my way across 59th Street to the Plaza on that blustery day in
May, I caught my reflection in a store window. It suddenly hit me: At 35
I was still dressing the way I had at 20. I had been in a
decade-and-a-half-long fashion stagnation. But that was about to change.</TE>
<TE>   When the heavy wooden door of the suite opened, a tall, slender man
with slicked-back black hair greeted me. He was, even by my untrained
eye, impeccably dressed. His gray pinstriped vest hugged his frame
perfectly, and his shirt of robin's egg blue had cuffs so crisp they
seemed to stand at attention on his wrists.</TE>
<TE>   "Welcome," said William Sani, chairman and owner of Hong Kong Grand
Custom Clothes in Kowloon. He cupped my hand in his, ushering me into a
cacophony of fabrics and colors. Suit coats, pants, shirts and vests hung
from every doorknob, drawer pull and windowsill, dressing the suite in
wide stripes of gray, blue, tan and black. In one corner, a Hindu shrine
and a candle shared desk space with a large ledger and a family
photograph. In another, my fiancee and her dad were poring over fabric
swatch books.</TE>
<TE>   To craft my suit, Mr. Sani took 35 measurements and several Polaroid
photos. My slacks were to be made from a blend of English and Italian
wools. And, while his custom shirts are available in a polycotton blend,
I quickly learned that nothing but the 200-thread-count Sea Island Pima
cotton would do. And at $450 for six shirts (included in the overall
two-jacket and two-slacks package of about $1,500), it seems like a
bargain.</TE>
<TE>   As he went about his measuring and photo taking, Sani mentioned that
he has been meeting with clients in hotel suites like this for more than
30 years, visiting Washington, D.C., New York, New Jersey and Southern
California every other month. After trying several tailors at four times
the price, Richard confided, he had remained loyally in Sani's fold for
the past six years. The measurements completed, Sani cupped my hand once
more in his and looked me in the eye. He said, "I will see you next time
then."</TE>
<TE>   My order arrived in L.A. about five weeks later in a package the size
of a bread loaf. It was hard to imagine that anything that would fit me
could come in such a tiny box. But it was all there, folded like wearable
origami.</TE>
<TE>   I was reluctant to open the parcel. In some small way I felt like I
was leaving one family and joining another. I reminisced about the one
tweed jacket and the four-in-hand knot that only a left-handed dad could
teach a left-handed son. But, in reality, I was no longer living that
life. Those clothes were my past. The vacuum-packed brick of imported
fabric I held in my hands was the future.</TE>
<TE>   Then I broke the seal. Out came a new jacket--this one a shade of blue
my fiancee had matched to my eyes. Next was a classic blue blazer with my
name sewn across the inside pocket in gold thread. There were two pairs
of L.A.-weight slacks that draped my imperfectly shaped body perfectly
and six of the softest shirts I've ever felt--all in patterns and colors
chosen by me. Each buttonhole was hand-sewn with silk. When I finally put
on the clothes, I didn't recognize the man in the mirror. I was looking
at a man with personal style.</TE>
<TE>   Initially I wore my new dress clothes on special occasions--a dinner
here, a night at the theater there. But once I felt how comfortable they
were, I couldn't stay out of them. Instead of an awkward uniform worn out
of necessity, I now had an invincible suit of armor to wear with
enjoyment. My fashion metamorphosis entered its final stage this past
fall when I got one of Mr. Sani's monthly fliers in the mail. He was
coming to Los Angeles and I wanted to go see him--on my own.</TE>
<TE>   Visiting the Los Angeles Airport Marriott brought back memories of New
York. The suite was a multi-hued patchwork and a new client was sitting
on the couch with his wife discussing the finer points of French cuffs in
hushed tones. But for me, no discussion was necessary. Mr. Sani pointed
to the fabrics he knew I liked, made a couple of quick notations in his
ledger and I was on my way in 10 minutes. After all, this was my tailor.</TE>
<TE>   Back at home I went straight to my closet, flung it open and stared at
my past style transgressions. The purge began and, by the end of the day,
I had two large bags to donate to charity and one slightly frayed plaid
flannel shirt to stow away in the bottom drawer until the next time I
ventured east of the Mississippi.</TE>
<TE>   Richard hadn't dressed me as much as taught me how to dress myself.
His act was a symbolic baby step. By sharing his tailor, he was saying he
was ready to share holidays, dinner tables and family moments. He had
made me part of the fabric of his life.</TE>

<HD>Modern Romance</HD>
<DH>Elaine Jones lovingly maintains her husband Quincy's mid-century
masterpiece</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY YOUNG</AU>
<BD>Emily Young last wrote for the magazine about movie greensman Dan
Needham</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From outside, the house seems plain, even forgettable--a
siding-clad, gable-roofed box hugging a corner of busy Santa Monica
Boulevard just blocks from the Century City shopping center. Walk inside,
though, and the bland facade gives way to a lovingly preserved example of
the airy mid-century modernist sensibility of one of Los Angeles' most
influential yet underappreciated architects.</LD>
<LD>   Like Richard Neutra and other postwar visionaries, A. Quincy Jones
built bold new buildings of steel, glass and concrete. But he is probably
best remembered for creating comfortable, livable spaces that combined
innovation with craftsman-like warmth. Thanks to his wife, Elaine, the
home he remodeled for the two of them remains much as it was before his
death in 1979. "Quincy's architecture was of the times, but whatever
Quincy did was just pure Quincy," she says.</LD>
<LD>   During the '50s and '60s, Jones and his then-partner, Frederick
Emmons, helped define the California look with roughly 60 residential
projects ranging from the groundbreaking suburban tract developments of
Joseph Eichler to the posh Beverly Hills estates of Gary Cooper and other
celebrities. As Sylvia Lavin, chair of the UCLA Department of
Architecture and Urban Design, notes: "Jones was particularly
distinguished by his attention to natural materials and a Japanese
influence manifested in extremely refined and fluid relations between
inside and outside."</LD>
<TE>   For his own home, however, Jones chose not to build but to renovate.
In 1965, he and Elaine--who ran her own public relations firm--bought a
photographer's studio that resembled, of all things, a barn. "Not one
single person who knew Quincy thought he'd ever buy a New England barn,"
Elaine recalls, "but he made it his own."</TE>
<TE>   Jones had envisioned a place to live, work, entertain and teach, so he
was drawn to a partitioned area beneath the nearly 33-foot-high ceiling.
"Quincy was always thinking of the user, and he had a wonderful way of
imagining a space," Elaine says. By eliminating nonstructural elements,
he opened up a vast 30-by-40-foot central living room. Side walls of
diagonal wood planking were painted white along with the ceiling. Other
walls were lined with redwood, and brick pavers were laid over concrete.
Topping off the transformation of "the Barn," Jones installed skylights
to bathe everything in sunlight.</TE>
<TE>   With potted palms and wool rugs delineating conversation areas,
leather chairs and laminate tables by Charles and Ray Eames were the
furnishings of choice. "[Manufacturer] Herman Miller was one of my
clients, so I had a lot of this furniture before we were married. It's
what I liked best and what Quincy liked best," Elaine explains. "Charles
Eames used to like coming here. He always said it felt like a little
Eames showroom."</TE>
<TE>   When Jones hosted clients or classes from USC, where he later served
as dean of the architecture school, the furniture allowed him to
reconfigure the atrium into a conference room or lecture hall. "Quincy
wanted a place for students to come and be stimulated. Sometimes the
whole back wall was used to display drawings or plans," Elaine says.
"After a few presentations, we'd spackle the plaster and have it
repainted."</TE>
<TE>   Heavy traffic prompted Jones to move the entrance from Santa Monica
Boulevard to a side street, but he left the rest of the layout intact. A
loft-like balcony, which he furnished with Judith Wachsmann chairs and a
daybed, connects second-story rooms at both ends of the building. To the
north, he arranged his home office and studio above Elaine's home office
and a small library. To the south, he put their bedroom over the kitchen
and dining room.</TE>
<TE>   Jones' style and ingenuity permeate every inch of the revamped rooms:
A bookcase wall shrinks the bedroom to human scale while also
accentuating the ceiling height. Utilitarian filing cabinets, customized
with George Nelson knobs, store socks, tools and other odds and ends. In
the dining room and kitchen, minimalist birch built-ins complement Jones'
sleek oak table. And a removable bookshelf in the library holds a slide
projector so the space can double as a viewing room.</TE>
<TE>   Floor-to-ceiling glass links the house to the courtyard, framing a
coral tree and a Japanese maple Jones planted as focal points. "He wanted
to make it seem as if the trees were always here," Elaine says. More than
50 other transplants, mostly eucalyptus, now provide shade, privacy and
the illusion of a wooded retreat far from the urban bustle.</TE>
<TE>   Over the past 12 years, Elaine has been organizing an archive of her
husband's drawings, models and papers for the UCLA library's Department
of Special Collections. If all goes as planned, she expects to complete a
lasting record of his legacy in 2002. "Architecture has completely
changed since Quincy died. This will be a resource for students. His work
will speak for itself."</TE>
<TE>   The fate of the Barn is less clear. Since Jones designed only the
interiors, not the structure, preservation is no guarantee. But neither
is demolition. Six years ago, Jones' former office building was rescued
from the wrecking ball when architect Frederick Fisher bought it and
moved in. "This house is a real treasure for the city. There's a
freshness and a simplicity to it," Fisher says. "I'd like to think that
someone will feel the same way about Jones' house as I did when I saw the
'For Sale' sign at his office."</TE>

<DH>Towering Banana Trees Lend a Taste of the Tropics to Your Garden</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN HEEGER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Welcome to the tropics. Native to Asia, bananas are now the
fourth-largest global fruit crop, growing in most of the world's tropics
(as well as Iceland, in ground heated by geysers). Alexander the Great
carried them from India to the West circa 300 BC. A few centuries later,
the plant landed, via Polynesian canoe, in Hawaii, where its various
parts have fed, clothed and thatched the roofs of generations. The
Franciscans brought the Musa species to California, and today gardeners
grow it as much for ornamental punch as for its edible gifts. Few foliage
plants look as comfortable among palms or reach such towering heights so
fast.</LD>
<LD>   Despite its loftiness--up to 30 feet tall--the banana isn't
technically a tree but the world's largest perennial herb. It grows from
a knoblike root called a corm, sending up fat stalks of layered sheaths
from which leaves unfurl, one a week when the weather's warm. Once enough
leaves open, a flower spike pushes through the center, and eventually
part of it develops into fruit. After the stalk flowers, it dies, but new
stalks, or "pups," develop at the base, ensuring that the plant lives on.</LD>
<TE>   Once planted, a banana needs about a year to bloom--longer if the
temperature sinks below 53 degrees or soars above 80 degrees. A freeze
can wither banana leaves, a heat wave scorch them and a strong wind
rattle them to shreds. Nevertheless, in our climate, the plant will
usually survive. But to help it thrive and fruit, position it near a wall
or other wind screen, in full or part sun. Give it fast-draining soil and
prepare to turn on the tap. Bananas love water if it doesn't linger
around their roots, and they need food: during the warm growing season, a
monthly dose of balanced fertilizer. Mulch their roots with chopped-up
banana clippings to conserve moisture, reduce weeds and add nutrients.
And to get a plant to fruit, snip off all but one pup (competitors for
the food supply) and tuck them elsewhere in your garden.</TE>
<TE>   With new cultivars appearing on the market, there are many fruit
choices--from the sweet 'Dwarf Chinese Cavendish' to the foot-long
'French Horn,' a cooking plantain, to the pink-fleshed Hawaiian
'Popolou,' with its apple-like taste.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Andersen, who grows all three at his San Clemente-based J.D.
Andersen Nursery, says the fun lies in trying several at once. Some, he
explains, are more cold- or wind-tolerant, some are compact types that
work well in city landscapes. Others, like the Musa relative, Ensete, are
planted solely for their foliage. Yet harvesting the yellow, and
sometimes red or blue bananas, is a bonus Andersen wouldn't give up. "I
enjoy looking out and seeing that hanging fruit," he admits. "It's like
the end reward for all my labors."</TE>

<LD>The sun came up all golden and fiery over the horizon as our plane
began its descent about 7 a.m. Barcelona time. It had been a few years
since I'd been someplace new, and I was hungry.</LD>
<LD>   To be totally honest, I didn't quite know what to expect of Barcelona.
Eating, not reading, has always been my travel itinerary of choice, and I
feel I learn more about a place by eating in its markets and restaurants
than by visiting its museums. When I imagined Barcelona, my mind conjured
cliche images of Spain--dark bars, swaths of red, black and yellow and a
general tone of ole! Yet walking its wide streets, with the elegant
buildings in pastel colors and Alice in Wonderland shapes and iron
balconies, I discovered a Barcelona that was nothing like what I
expected.</LD>
<LD>   It took all of one lunch to convince me of what I'd shrugged off as a
technicality: Barcelona is not Spain, exactly. It is a place unto itself,
located in the region of Catalonia. The Catalan people speak a language
as different from Castilian (what we call "Spanish") as is French. And
their cuisine couldn't be farther from the copper dishes of paella and
pitchers of sangria that define Spanish food in America. What I got in
the way of lunch that first afternoon in a brightly lit, refined
restaurant with crystal chandeliers, was a riveting meal that included
blood sausages and salt cod intestines. Welcome to Barcelona.</LD>
<TE>   The next morning, I started my day with a visit to the famous market,
La Boqueria, where piles of Spain's delicious roasted peeled almonds and
little square, corked jars of saffron assured me I had indeed gotten on
the right plane. That is, until I stopped at Bar Pinotxo for a simple
breakfast of green lentils with cuttlefish and its ink, sausages in brown
sauce, anchovies on toast and eggs scrambled with clams. This at 10 a.m.,
with multiple glasses of cava, a dry Spanish sparkling wine--talk about a
wake-up call.</TE>
<TE>   In the week that followed, I ordered adventurously from menus that
read like the anatomy of farm animals: head and foot, brain, tripe,
liver, kidneys, sweetbreads, blood. One evening at dinner with friends
the decorative tiles and photographs of bullfighters in the restaurant
transported me momentarily to the Spain of my imagination, but the menu
quickly returned me to reality. We dined on a stew of cuttlefish,
meatballs and shrimp, and pork jowls with wild mushrooms. The defining
dish was delicately named "espardenyas" (a synonym for "espadrilles" and
a more appetizing way of saying "sea slugs") with pistachios and those
lovely salt cod intestines again. Don't misunderstand. Trying new things
is always exhausting, but these bizarre and often unexpected combinations
can awaken the palate in a manner that borders on the surreal.</TE>
<TE>   I ate my last meal at one of the city's finest restaurants with six
friends, Catalans and Americans, who live in Barcelona. By that time, I
was smashing anchovies on my bread like they were butter. Pa amb
tomaquet--grilled crusty white bread rubbed with tomato and drizzled with
olive oil--had become a part of my vocabulary, as had moltes gracies
(thank you) and crema catalana, Catalan's less firm and more delicious
version of creme brulee. But as our friends exchanged bites of sea slugs
and creamed foie gras with chickpeas across the table, I sat back, unable
to eat another bite. I was content. And I was ready to go home.</TE>
<TE>Peix Espasa en Cassola</TE>
<TE>   (Swordfish with Raisins and Pine Nuts)</TE>
<TE>   Serves 4</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 pounds swordfish, about 1 inch thick, cut into pieces about 2 by
4 inches</TE>
<TE>   Flour</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1 cup dry white wine</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup orange juice, fresh-squeezed</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon lemon juice</TE>
<TE>   16-20 almonds, blanched and roasted</TE>
<TE>   1 sprig parsley, minced</TE>
<TE>   1 sprig fresh mint, minced</TE>
<TE>   1 sprig marjoram, minced</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup golden raisins or sultanas, plumped in warm water for 10
minutes</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup pine nuts, lightly toasted</TE>
<TE>   Salt and pepper</TE>
<TE>   Dredge swordfish pieces in flour. Pour olive oil into a large skillet
and brown swordfish lightly on all sides.</TE>
<TE>   Remove the fish from the skillet and drain it on paper towels. Add
wine, orange juice and lemon juice to skillet, and reduce the liquid by
half.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, grind the almonds with a mortar and pestle. Add herbs and
mash into nuts. Add enough liquid from the skillet to form a paste, then
add to the pan along with the raisins and pine nuts, stirring the
ingredients together well.</TE>
<TE>   Return the fish to the skillet and heat through. Salt and pepper to
taste.</TE>
<TE>Pa amb Tomaquet</TE>
<TE>   (Catalan Tomato Bread)</TE>
<TE>   Serves 4 as an appetizer</TE>
<TE>   4 thick slices country-style French or Italian bread</TE>
<TE>   4 small fresh tomatoes, very ripe</TE>
<TE>   Mild extra-virgin olive oil</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   8 anchovy filets, soaked in water for 1 hour and patted dry, or 4 very
thin slices prosciutto</TE>
<TE>   Grill the bread lightly on a wood-burning fire or barbecue, or toast
lightly under a broiler (turning once in the latter case).</TE>
<TE>   Cut the tomatoes in half crosswise. Rub both sides of the toast
(including the crust) with the cut side, squeezing gently as you do, to
leave a thin red film, including some seeds and bits of tomato flesh, on
both surfaces.</TE>
<TE>   Drizzle oil on both sides of the toast to taste, then salt to taste.</TE>
<TE>   Place anchovies or prosciutto on top of the toast, and serve with
knife and fork.</TE>
<TE>Crema Catalana</TE>
<TE>   (Catalan "Burnt Cream")</TE>
<TE>   Serves 4</TE>
<TE>   1 pint half-and-half</TE>
<TE>   Peel of 1/2 lemon</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cinnamon stick</TE>
<TE>   3 egg yolks</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   Heat the half-and-half, lemon peel and cinnamon stick in a saucepan
over medium heat until just boiling. Remove from heat immediately,
discard the lemon peel and cinnamon stick, and allow to cool.</TE>
<TE>   Beat the egg yolks with 1/4 cup of sugar until thick. Strain cooled
half-and-half into the eggs, stirring constantly.</TE>
<TE>   Reheat the custard mixture in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over low heat,
stirring constantly until it thickens slightly and coats the back of a
wooden spoon. Allow to cool slightly. Pour the custard into four 1-cup
ramekins. Allow custard to set, then sprinkle each with a thin layer of
sugar and caramelize under a very hot broiler or using a mini acetylene
torch until dark amber in color.</TE>
<TE>Pomes Farcides amb Crema Catalan</TE>
<TE>   (Apples Stuffed with Catalan "Burnt Cream")</TE>
<TE>   Serves 4</TE>
<TE>   4 large baking apples</TE>
<TE>   Butter</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   1/2 recipe of Crema Catalana (see above), without caramelized sugar</TE>
<TE>   Core the apples, being careful not to cut through the bottoms. Pare a
one-inch strip from around the top of each.</TE>
<TE>   Lightly butter a baking dish and arrange apples in dish. Bring 1/2 cup
of water to a boil, then stir in half the sugar. Pour mixture over
apples.</TE>
<TE>   Bake uncovered in a 350-degree oven, basting occasionally, for 30 to
40 minutes, or until apples are tender and the skin begins to crack.</TE>
<TE>   Remove the apples from the oven and allow them to cool for about 10
minutes, continuing to baste occasionally.</TE>
<TE>   Fill each apple with Crema Catalana (some may be left over). Sprinkle
the top of each with remaining sugar and place under a hot broiler until
the sugar is dark brown. Allow to cool slightly before serving.</TE>

<LD>Under Chef Gray Kunz, and now Christian Delouvrier, the restaurant
Lespinasse in New York's St. Regis Hotel set a new standard for hotel
dining. It follows that the debut of a new, built-from-scratch St. Regis
at Monarch Beach would raise the bar for dining in south Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   The new establishment, though, seems to prove just how difficult it is
to clone the allure of either a world-class hotel or a successful
restaurant. Against the somber elegance of the St. Regis New York, the
St. Regis Monarch Beach comes off as a nouveau riche cousin. The
architecture has the bluster of Las Vegas casino-hotels. And rather than
try to duplicate Lespinasse, the St. Regis invited Michael Mina,
chef/owner of San Francisco's Aqua, to install another Aqua in the
$240-million Monarch Beach resort, with Executive Chef Chris L'Hommedieu
in charge. Alas, the new Aqua doesn't live up to the hype.</LD>
<LD>   The decor is grandly theatrical and definitely luxe. Lavish burgundy
taffeta curtains sweep down to the floor and champagne damask banquettes
curve up at the corners like a medieval wimple. Tables are set with
Bernadaud porcelain candle covers with coral reef scenes,
platinum-trimmed plates and Spiegelau stemware. Hotel restaurants have
always offered the luxury of space, but the oddly configured tables for
two may offer a touch too much of that. The long, narrow tables hold
would-be romantic couples at arm's length.</LD>
<TE>   Aqua is, of course, a seafood restaurant, and the proprietors are so
serious about it, there's practically nothing else on the menu. Not a
steak. Not a lamb chop. Not a roast chicken. The closest thing to meat,
in fact, is the whole roasted foie gras, which is meant to be shared by
the entire table. But if you love seafood, you'll revel in the range of
choices, and you can start with caviar served from a handsome blond wood
and chrome cart.</TE>
<TE>   Torn between the traditional caviar service with the fixings on the
side or Aqua's signature parfait, I choose the latter. The server
carefully spoons your choice of caviar onto a perfectly round creation of
crisp potato pancake topped with layers of finely chopped egg, creme
fraiche and heavily smoked salmon. The myriad flavors compete,
powerfully, with the caviar, and I wish I'd ordered the least expensive
fish eggs instead of osetra. It's showy, but does it make sense?</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, I find myself asking the same question again and again
over several meals at Aqua.</TE>
<TE>   Three of Mina's dishes merit attention. His full-bodied mussel souffle
carries the sweet, rich flavor of mussels in every bite. An ochre saffron
Chardonnay sauce sets off the dusky souffle beautifully. Lobster pot pie
is served table-side with much ceremony. The waiter carefully removes the
buttery short crust and arranges the crimson lobster pieces, wild
mushrooms, potatoes and other vegetables--chiseled like jewels--on the
plate.</TE>
<TE>   One night we order Chilean sea bass marinated overnight in miso and
sake. ("Now we're getting serious," our waiter whispers.) I'm no fan of
Chilean sea bass, but this is one of the better versions I've had,
perhaps because the fish is so fresh. The sweet funkiness of the miso,
which caramelizes when cooked, and a spicy Sichuan broth with shiitake
mushrooms and bok choy give the neutral-tasting fish another dimension.
Unfortunately, not enough of the menu works on this level.</TE>
<TE>   Some dishes that sound intriguing in print just don't deliver on the
plate. When you order ahi tuna tartare, the server steps up and, like a
mother cutting up food for her toddler, starts fooling with the pile of
shimmering sushi-grade tuna on your plate, murmuring that he's mixing
serrano oil, mint chiffonade and pine nuts into the tuna. This fishy take
on tartare is fascinating for about two bites, but not enough to sustain
anyone's interest through the dauntingly large portion of raw chopped
tuna.</TE>
<TE>   The perfect little cylinders of Dungeness crab cake are phenomenal,
but the crab filling lacks flavor. Setting the hot cakes on bland celery
root remoulade warms it up when it should be cool for contrast. The fussy
garnish--tiny dabs of lemon aioli, coins of blood orange syrup and
microscopic amounts of green chive oil--isn't enough to perk up the dish.
Aqua too often values photo-ready looks more than taste.</TE>
<TE>   An infatuation with sweet sauces undermines some of the other dishes,
among them the whole roasted Hudson Valley foie gras, which we order one
night as a middle course for the table. Our waiter brings it over and
shows it off before he serves it. Roasted on a bed of sliced Granny Smith
apples, it is masterfully cooked, rosy at the center--truly a gorgeous
piece of duck liver and so rich it could easily feed six or eight. I
understand the concept of sweet with foie gras, but does it really need a
caramel sauce that tastes as if it belongs on a tarte tatin?</TE>
<TE>   Foie gras is also an element in Aqua's single most famous dish: seared
ahi tuna stacked impossibly tall with seared foie gras. I've eaten it at
Aqua in San Francisco and Las Vegas, and now here, and it has never been
anything but awful. The minute you try to take a bite, the whole
structure comes tumbling down. Aren't we over tall food yet? The
combination of warm fatty duck liver with lean, virtually raw tuna is
gimmicky at best, and not enhanced by a sticky Pinot Noir reduction.</TE>
<TE>   At dessert, you can luck into ordering the gently spiced sticky rice
with cool, luscious mango or lose out by ordering the sugary root beer
float with scoops of root beer sorbet, a grown-up version of the soda
fountain classic. A better choice might be the straightforward ice cream
sundae with three flavors of ice cream and three sauces (caramel, dark
fudge and butterscotch) presented in Chinese porcelain soup spoons. A
citrus tasting plate includes a lovely lemon meringue tartlet and a
refreshing grapefruit ice inset with chunks of pink grapefruit.</TE>
<TE>   While Aqua strives to give top-level service, the result is too often
awkward and intrusive. No one appreciates it when the hostess tries to
seat you at the worst table--the one near the door, even though it's late
and the restaurant is only one-third full. Some servers seem as nervous
as Julia Roberts at her first fancy meal in "Pretty Woman," laying down
each piece of silver reverently, double checking to make sure it's
correct. Others patronize you, waiting for the expected oohs and ahs
after every course like stand-up comics waiting for a laugh. Every time
you get up from the table, even before you've ordered, your napkin is
surreptitiously replaced. I know they do it in three-star restaurants,
but here it's simply ostentatious.</TE>
<TE>   How can you take a restaurant seriously when you're poring over the
wine list and the waiter leans over to say, "Amazing, isn't it?" It's
amazing, all right. Amazing how expensive everything is. Some bottles are
marked up four times. One night our server proffers the bottle of wine
we've ordered with a flourish: "Cellar temperature!" In fact, it's too
warm. The sommelier, on the other hand, is cordial and informative.</TE>
<TE>   At close to $150 a person before you get out the door, should a diner
have to endure music such as a New Age siren wailing against a background
of droning chords? It's loud enough not to be background, and when we ask
if it can be turned down, we're told it means someone must go down to the
floor below with a security guard to adjust the sound. Finally, when the
restaurant has emptied, we plead for it to be turned off. Nothing
happens. It's simply not addressed.</TE>
<TE>   Sad to say, while the room is elegant and the appointments grand, Aqua
Monarch Beach is not anywhere near a premier dining destination for
Greater Los Angeles. At these prices, the service and the food should be
first-rate, and they're not. The menu seems mired in the '90s and could
use some updating, too. Aqua Monarch Beach has some serious catching up
to do.</TE>

<HD>Enron's Run Tripped by Arrogance, Greed</HD>
<DH>Profile: A lack of discipline and a drive to bend rules were key
factors in the meltdown.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>HOUSTON
</DL>
<LD>Two years ago, the executive committee of Enron Corp. convened to
select a new slogan for the company. Enron was on fire, entering new
markets and starting new businesses on almost a daily basis. The old
slogan, "The world's leading energy company," was too limiting.</LD>
<LD>   The committee's top choice for a replacement: World's coolest company.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a vision of innovation; it's a vision of creativity," Enron
President Jeffrey K. Skilling said at the time. To underline the point,
then-Chairman Kenneth L. Lay suggested wrapping the headquarters building
in a pair of giant sunglasses.</LD>
<TE>   The name Enron now conjures up images of monstrous greed and massive
fraud, shredded documents and empty 401(k) plans, but for quite a while
it was considered one of the country's leading corporations. Analysts
marveled over it, Fortune magazine voted it "most innovative" six years
in a row and people were eager to work there.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't mass delusion. For much of its 16 years, Enron did indeed
appear innovative, creative and cool, although the executive committee
never made the new slogan official. It was the kind of place where the
normal workplace rules were suspended for what seemed the best reason: to
free people to achieve excellence.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the transformation was the work of Skilling, who arrived at
Enron in 1990 from the consulting group McKinsey &amp; Co. and rose to become
chief executive for six months before resigning last August. During
Skilling's first week at Enron, his secretary brought him a stack of
expense accounts to review.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to be kidding me," Skilling recalled in a 2000 interview
for an academic study. "Here the world's just fallen apart around
us--deregulation, new customers, new products. And I'm going to sit here
line-item by line-item and go through an expense statement?"</TE>
<TE>   Henceforth, he decreed, expense reports would routinely be approved
without review.</TE>
<TE>   As Skilling ascended, he overhauled the company culture. He set
employees loose, encouraging them to push the edge of every rule, even
without their supervisors' knowledge. He instituted a company-wide
performance review system designed to weed out the weak. He rewarded fast
results with big money. And he said that not only would Enron pattern
itself after General Electric, the most sustained success in corporate
America, but it would also surpass it.</TE>
<TE>   In the hothouse atmosphere of the late '90s, all of these ideas seemed
reasonable, even commonplace. The stock market was soaring. People
confused getting rich with being smart. The dot-coms, then riding high,
looked like they would kill off the stodgy old industrial companies. It
seemed like the boom times would never end.</TE>
<TE>   By the time they did early last year, Enron had become less a company
than a collection of mercenaries, according to current and former
employees. Secret partnerships were set up that critics say violated the
most basic conflict-of-interest rules.</TE>
<TE>   Company earnings and revenue were inflated or illusory. Hardly
anything was real, unless it was the tens of millions of dollars that top
executives were making from selling stock as fast as they could.</TE>
<TE>   Enron was not only one of the biggest corporate collapses in American
history, it was also one of the fastest; what appeared a viable if
overextended company in September was bankrupt in December. Every day
brings fresh allegations of chicanery and manipulation by both Enron and
its auditor, Andersen. Ten congressional committees are investigating, as
is the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday morning, former Enron Vice Chairman J. Clifford Baxter was
found dead in his Mercedes-Benz. The death was ruled a suicide Saturday
by the Harris County, Texas, medical examiner's office. Friends said he
was despondent over having been unable to put a stop to Enron's highly
questionable accounting methods.</TE>
<TE>   "Enron prospered by challenging the limits of accepted behavior. The
vast bulk were in ways that were socially, legally and politically
acceptable," said Robert F. Bruner, a University of Virginia graduate
business professor who cowrote a multimedia study of Enron that was
conducted in 2000 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "But Enron lost discipline over its aggression," Bruner said. "The
biggest reason for Enron's fall is its absence of humility."</TE>
<TE>   Bruner's study is the source of this story's quotes from former Enron
executives Lay, Skilling and Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow,
who are now declining media interviews.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   We've taken all these young bright people. We've given them a toolbox.
. . . That's how we build our businesses. Just people dreaming up
solutions every day.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew S. Fastow, Enron chief financial officer, in April 2000</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Louise Kitchen was a young British trader spearheading Enron's entry
into Europe's energy markets. She wasn't a top executive and hadn't even
turned 30. But Kitchen cooked up a plan for the company's online trading
operation.</TE>
<TE>   Online trading was seen as Enron's future. Under Skilling's guidance,
the company was moving hard assets like power plants off its balance
sheet into complex partnerships. The goal was an "asset light" company
that would make its money brokering contracts to provide power and other
commodities.</TE>
<TE>   She rallied a team of supporters and they designed the entire business
out of the company's London offices, much of it on nights and weekends.
Skilling was on record as being opposed to automated trading systems, so
Kitchen, who bootlegged $30 million in hardware from other Enron
divisions and drew 380 people into the project, didn't tell him.</TE>
<TE>   The head of the London office finally broached the subject of online
trading, Skilling later recounted to his interviewers. Skilling says he
rolled his eyes but agreed that such a system might just work.</TE>
<TE>   "That's good," the London executive said, "because we're rolling it
out next week."</TE>
<TE>   It was an immediate triumph, with 65,000 natural gas, electricity,
petrochemical and other transactions in the first four months. Kitchen
soared too. Just last fall, she was ranked 17 on Fortune's list of the 50
most powerful women in business.</TE>
<TE>   This was the era when the dot-com philosophy of "first-mover
advantage" held sway: Whoever entered a new market first would dominate
it.</TE>
<TE>   One young Enron executive had a notion about trading high-speed
computer bandwidth. Skilling says he set him loose, not even telling his
supervisor. "His boss would say, 'No, just keep doing what you're doing,'
" Skilling said. Nothing was off-limits. The company got into trading
weather derivatives (to hedge against swings in temperature that may
affect a business) and launched plans to do the same with advertising
space. And its creativity quickly extended to finance.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think Enron had any fear," said Richard Kottke, a former
engineer and weather trader with the company. "There wasn't anything they
wouldn't try to make money at. Any reasonable person would look at that
mentality and say, 'I see how that would lead a person to do something in
accounting to push the envelope.' "</TE>
<TE>   It was, said another ex-employee, all part of being "creative."</TE>
<TE>   "If you asked your managers about the law, they said it could be
written better but that wasn't our job," said this man, who worked in the
research unit analyzing prospective deals. "Our job was to take advantage
of the law to make as much money as we can."</TE>
<TE>   Current and former employees, some of whom wanted to talk anonymously
to protect their job or just keep out of the media firestorm, describe a
place where ideas were implemented fast, but if they didn't yield
immediate results, the project would end up on the scrap heap just as
quickly.</TE>
<TE>   The new businesses weren't always worth much in the present. But with
so-called mark-to-market accounting, future values of long-term contracts
were counted immediately. Still, the dollars were phantom dollars, which
drove the need for yet more deals, insiders say.</TE>
<TE>   Take the broadband unit. Enron cut a deal with Blockbuster to deliver
movies to viewers' homes through telephone lines. The joint venture was a
legitimate, although ultimately unsuccessful, idea: The market, and the
technology, just weren't there yet.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the phantom profits went onto the books, said one former
vice president.</TE>
<TE>   This kind of accounting was one of several factors that led to the
company's decline.</TE>
<TE>   By last winter, the company was in constant flux.</TE>
<TE>   "The company was notorious for reorganizing every six months," said
Ron Lumbra, Houston executive director of the corporate search firm
Russell Reynolds Associates.</TE>
<TE>   "We needed to bring in people who could handle their boss being
transferred in their third week on the job and their business being
restructured in their sixth week."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If you're creating something new, you have to make sure everyone's
working together and aligned. . . . If I have 10 people reporting to me,
when you change an organization, I can guarantee you maybe four people
get it. Three probably say they get it but they really don't, and there
will be four who are actively hostile to what you're trying to
accomplish.</TE>
<TE>   --Jeffrey K. Skilling, explaining Enron's "rank and yank" personnel
evaluation process last May.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Luring the best and brightest to Enron became a Skilling fixation. But
that wasn't enough. Employees had to constantly improve, and who better
to judge their work than their peers?</TE>
<TE>   Skilling took the performance review process he learned at the
consulting group McKinsey to Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Every six months the frenzy would repeat itself. Employees and
managers would scramble to find reviewers among supervisors, subordinates
and peers. Self-evaluations were projected onto screens and debated.</TE>
<TE>   It took three weeks to chew over an employee's record and rate it
against everyone else who held a similar position. Workers were ranked on
a scale of one to five, with the number determining their bonuses, and
their fates.</TE>
<TE>   "Those who don't really meet the standards get cycled out of the
company pretty quickly, which is probably good for them and good for the
company," Lay told the University of Virginia researchers in April 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Individual excellence was in. Teamwork was out.</TE>
<TE>   "People became proprietary about their deals," said one Enron veteran.
"Why should I help Johnny if I'm rated against Johnny?"</TE>
<TE>   As the New Economy soured, there was much less success to go around.
That only increased the competition. "As the company internally realized
it was entering troubled times, rank-and-yank turned into a more
political and crony-based system," said Bruner, the Virginia professor.</TE>
<TE>   Some managers lied, altering records on employees they wanted gone,
said Charles Turcich, an information technology contract worker who spent
18 months at Enron.</TE>
<TE>   "Managers would change time from sick time to just 'absent' to make
[workers] look bad. They'd keep spreadsheets of attendance and go back
and change them," Turcich said.</TE>
<TE>   "Enron was a really unpleasant place to work," agreed one trader who
is nevertheless still there. "It was ridiculously competitive, even
vicious. . . . I locked my desk every night so my colleagues wouldn't
steal my work."</TE>
<TE>   Officially, everyone played well together. Enron's stated values were
dubbed RICE: Respect, Integrity, Communication, Excellence. Lay himself
selected them, employees were reminded. The values were engraved on
knickknacks, from Lucite squares to plaques and rocks, and given to
employees as inspirational gifts.</TE>
<TE>   But in practice, some say, everyone was judged on "origination"--or
how much business you were bringing to the company. "I went to a lot of
evaluation meetings," said one junior executive, "and I never heard
anyone evaluated by any standard but origination."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   We're going to do the right thing and make money without having to do
anything but the right thing.</TE>
<TE>   --Fastow, in April 2000</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The company grew because money mattered and it mattered more and more
as the company grew, current and former employees say. Everyone knew what
the stock was doing at every minute. New employees not only hoped to make
a bundle but demanded it.</TE>
<TE>   "You get the deal done, you get paid," said executive recruiter
Lumbra, who was told by one senior executive that Enron was "the best
meritocracy in business."</TE>
<TE>   Those who made money exulted in it. One trader remembers one of his
colleagues standing on his desk after the stock had had a particularly
good day. "I am so rich!" he shouted. One executive, Lou Pai, sold stock
worth $353 million.</TE>
<TE>   Excess is rarely frowned on in Texas, but Enron began to press even
the state's tolerance. You could identify Enron employees, people said,
by the way they swaggered.</TE>
<TE>   "They were totally cocky. They were arrogant. They thought everything
they did was right," said one local attorney who had friends at the
company. "They thought they were reinventing the . . . wheel."</TE>
<TE>   By late September, after Skilling resigned and it was apparent the
company was spiraling downward, Lay made a last-ditch cheerleading
effort. His "Lay It on the Line" in-house survey generated 4,000
responses from employees about the company in three days. On Oct. 2, he
e-mailed the results to them, one of whom gave The Times a copy.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1 out of 3 said they weren't committed to staying at Enron.
Other signs of trouble: 42% said the company was more "self-serving" than
it had been a year earlier, while 39% said it had grown more "arrogant."
And 37% said the company was less "trustworthy."</TE>
<TE>   Lay tried to right the ship. The performance review system would be
modified, he promised. A new employee relations office would be
established to field criticism. And efforts to stress "integrity and
respect" would be redoubled.</TE>
<TE>   "Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's
evaluation and feedback," Lay wrote. "We are all responsible for how we
treat our co-workers and customers."</TE>
<TE>   But the words were just words. Enron's slide was unchecked.</TE>
<TE>   After a failed merger attempt with a smaller competitor, Dynegy, led
Enron into its December bankruptcy, Prudential Securities' Houston office
questioned whether anyone could have married such an abrasive bride.</TE>
<TE>   "Enron's arrogance and mercenary culture was deep-rooted in the
company," wrote analyst Carol Coale, "and we doubted that even a
fraternal management team like that of Dynegy's would have been able to
reshape the mind-set of Enron's management and employees."</TE>
<TE>   Still, traces of the infatuation ingrained for so long in the loyal
work force remain. One young man, who said he lost more than $50,000 in
his savings plan and a small fortune in stock options and bonus money,
was still optimistic that the company would survive.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in the integrity of the management," he said. "This job
could be fun again."</TE>

<KH>Q&amp;A VENTURA COUNTY SUPERVISOR, DISTRICT 2</KH>
<HD></HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: Critics say you're a rich businessman trying to buy an
election and that you favored slow growth only after voters saved
farmland and open space with the SOAR initiatives. Response?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: In my congressional campaign, which was in 1998, that was
the year SOAR was passed, and I came out very strongly for SOAR. My
wife and I moved to the Conejo Valley because we love it. My business
was located in San Dimas. We relocated from downtown Los Angeles to
Thousand Oaks, knowing I was going to have a drive of 65 miles, for
one reason only--we wanted to live in Thousand Oaks. To believe that
I want to pave over it, you know, turn it into the San Fernando
Valley is ridiculous. SOAR passed with 71% of the vote in Thousand
Oaks. People want to protect what they have. My opponent does not
have the exclusivity of wanting to protect the Conejo Valley.
Everybody that moves there wants to protect the quality of life.
Where we differ is who's best to do that and who is going to be most
effective.</LD>
<LD>   Q: Isn't it a contradiction to say you will hold the line on
growth when one of your major backers is Sherwood Country Club
developer David Murdock?</LD>
<TE>   A: My opposition actively solicited David Murdock. She's
misstating the facts when she denies that she did. But Murdock is
supporting me because he knows me through my congressional campaign
and because I'm an entrepreneur. His development probably has one of
the lowest densities in Southern California. He is primarily an
international businessman who has created jobs and given millions of
dollars to charity. I also haven't met too many people who would
reject living at Lake Sherwood. Just because you participate in
helping bring the American dream to people who live in the Conejo
Valley doesn't make you a bad person.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Does SOAR hinder the movement of new businesses to Ventura
County and make it hard for workers to find affordable housing?</TE>
<TE>   A: Affordable housing is difficult to find in Ventura County. No
question about it. One of the difficulties of getting businesses to
relocate along the 101 technology corridor is the lack of affordable
housing. But the people of District 2 have spoken overwhelmingly. We
don't want dense development. Because we want to maintain our open
space, and we want to maintain the quality of life that open space
gives us, we will lose opportunities to bring businesses in. It's a
trade-off that I'm willing to make.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You've been running cable ads nonstop. You have hired a platoon
of campaign pros and mailed out several glossy brochures. Is there a
risk that voters will view your campaign as too pricey and slick?</TE>
<TE>   A: First off, my huge campaign staff is Joel [Angeles, Hoffman's
campaign manager]. And we have a consultant. We did polling. We have
one full-time paid person. We do have quite a few volunteers,
including my mom. I make no apologies for educating the voters about
my record and my background, and about the background and voting
record of my opposition. It's as simple as that.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Has county government gone overboard on its funding for public
safety departments such as the Sheriff's Department and the district
attorney's office?</TE>
<TE>   A: No, I don't believe the county has gone overboard. Public
safety is the No. 1 priority in Ventura County from the standpoint
that it is one of the reasons people move here, particularly to
Thousand Oaks. It is traditionally one of the safest cities in
America. We are the safest county in the Western U.S. In addition to
public safety, we have good schools, relatively speaking. So, people
move here for that.</TE>
<TE>   We should not be dialing back on the dollars because we think the
threat is not there anymore. What if we dropped to No. 10? Or 5? That
impacts everything from property values to a variety of things. Also,
with the terrorist threat that we have, we should not be cutting back
on public safety. There are many definitions of public safety, and it
is something that we need to continually evaluate. Especially when we
look at the tremendous financial pressure the county is going to come
under.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Are sheriff's deputies asking too much in contract negotiations
by demanding essentially their full salary as retirement
compensation?</TE>
<TE>   A: What I firmly believe is that, on a long-term basis, if an
organization is not competitive on salaries and benefits, that
organization will suffer. What you have to ask is do you become
competitive in one year? Five years? Seven years? That's what you
have to figure out. And what's the impact? What's the trade-off? We
can't necessarily do it all in a single year. But we certainly have
to move forward. We don't want the people who work for the county,
whether it's SEIU [the county's largest labor union], the deputy
sheriffs, the firefighters, prosecutors or whatever, I don't think we
want to turn Ventura County into McDonald's with a turnover
mentality.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What is the biggest problem voters should have with your
opponent?</TE>
<TE>   A: The biggest problem voters should have with Linda Parks is her
leadership style, her inability to pull people together and her
tremendous divisiveness that goes all the way back to her Planning
Commission days. She is a divider. She cannot bring people to the
table to talk about complex issues. She is constantly on the attack.
That is certainly the biggest difference between us from a style
standpoint. We have seen the bickering on the county Board of
Supervisors. Injecting her into that atmosphere isn't going to help.
Difficult times call for real leadership, for someone who can bring
people to the table and sort through complex priorities. She does not
have those skills.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You've never been active in local politics: What qualifies you
to be a supervisor?</TE>
<TE>   A: I have been a leader in a variety of roles for over two
decades. I've been involved in building companies and creating jobs.
I've been involved on the boards of technology companies. I've been
involved with the community, the YMCA, Kids Safe, the Domestic
Violence Advisory Council. I have contributed both my time and my
money to a variety of good causes. I am fortunate to have had an
outstanding education and 20-some odd years of significant
accomplishment. I submit that if we bring people to government who
can sit at a table and deal with complex problems, and who are used
to accepting responsibility for their actions, that this will be a
better place. That's what makes me qualified.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Your opponent charges that your campaign will turn dirty in its
final days: True?</TE>
<TE>   A: I've always said that my campaign is going to educate the
voters of District 2 about my record and my opponent's record. We
will educate the voters. And if my opponent thinks that her record is
negative, she needs to take responsibility for that.</TE>
<TE>   We certainly are not going to do anything that is misleading or
not true.</TE>

<TE>   RANDY HOFFMAN</TE>
<TE>   Age: 48</TE>
<TE>   Occupation: Businessman</TE>
<TE>   Education: Bachelor's degree in business administration from USC;
master's in business administration from Harvard; certified public
accountant.</TE>
<TE>   Background: Hoffman started his business career at Bausch &amp; Lomb
Inc., serving as controller. In 1987, he co-founded Magellan Systems,
producing hand-held satellite tracking devices for civilian and
military use. He sold his stake in the company and left in 1997. In
1998, he ran for Congress, losing to Democrat Brad Sherman. Hoffman
serves on the boards of technology companies and volunteers at the
East Ventura County YMCA and Kid Safe. He was Gov. Pete Wilson's
appointee to a domestic-violence advisory council. He lives in
Thousand Oaks with his wife and four children, ages 5 to 12.</TE>
<TE>   Campaign: Hoffman has raised more than $211,000, backed primarily
by the county's GOP establishment and business elite. One supporter,
businessman and developer David Murdock, has contributed $91,000.
Hoffman is relying heavily on cable television ads and multiple
mailings to reach voters. He is endorsed by Supervisor Frank Schillo,
county firefighters and sheriff's deputies and a variety of current
and former public officials.</TE>
<TE>   Quote: "My opponent's classic style is 'My way or the highway.' If
you don't agree with me on this issue, I'm going to stop talking to
you. That's really where the big difference is between us."</TE>

<HD>2 Candidates Make Growth the Key Issue</HD>
<DH>Thousand Oaks voters will pick a new supervisor March 5.
Vying for the seat are Councilwoman Linda Parks and businessman Randy
Hoffman. These are highlights of their interviews with The Times.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: Your critics say you're hard to get along with and that
you've built a political career pandering to Thousand Oaks' NIMBYs.
Response?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: I'm certainly not part of the good old boys' network. I
have opposed projects such as a $12.5-million taxpayer giveaway for a
seven-story parking structure and movie theater right next to City
Hall. I opposed the development of the Hill Canyon wetlands for a
high-priced golf course. So I've been on the front of many battles.
But I have also brought something forward that I think is unique in
the history of our area, and that is bringing together the cities of
Westlake Village, Calabasas, Agoura Hills and Thousand Oaks to meet
regularly on trying to get a hospital for the Conejo Valley. I also
have been endorsed by a majority of the Ventura County Board of
Supervisors in my previous campaigns and I work well with all of
them.</LD>
<LD>   Q: What can be done about the Ahmanson Ranch housing project at
this point without the county facing costly litigation?</LD>
<TE>   A: At the same time you have the opportunity to vote for Linda
Parks, you can also vote for a $1-billion park bond. And I would like
to see funds put toward the purchase of Ahmanson Ranch for a state
park. The best way to avoid litigation would be for [Ahmanson Ranch
developer] Washington Mutual to do the right thing, and that is
instead of selling to commercial builders, sell it for parkland.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Should the county continue to fight the Newhall Ranch project
in court?</TE>
<TE>   A: The county has legitimate concerns about the Newhall Ranch
project, and until it's resolved in court, I certainly wouldn't back
out of it. We have an opportunity to make the project better, if not
possibly stop it.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What do you offer voters other than your slow-growth politics?</TE>
<TE>   A: I'm best known for my advocacy for slow growth and open space.
But I've been on the City Council for over five years now, and I have
put together several laws--the city's first-ever campaign reform law,
laws that protect neighborhoods and citizens' rights. Thousand Oaks
has an excellent record of having a balanced budget and is one of the
safest cities in the nation. I've worked to support a 20% increase in
our police since I've been on the City Council. I worked to improve
citizens' access to City Hall because they were not having their
voices heard. I've been fighting taxpayer waste and excessive
expenditures. For example, our city administrators were using city
credit cards to dine at expensive restaurants and I cracked down on
those expenditures.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Aren't you too liberal to be a Republican? Why did you change
your party?</TE>
<TE>   A: I changed my party for two reasons. One is I feel very attuned
to the Republican fiscal conservatives. The other reason is that . .
. I would like to see the party more open to people of different
philosophies. [Former Thousand Oaks Councilwoman] Elois Zeanah,
[Mayor] Ed Masry, myself, we are all Republicans who are
environmentalists. It's not an oxymoron. I changed parties about six
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Q: As a supervisor, what do you offer your affluent constituents
in Thousand Oaks, since county government deals mostly with poor
people and criminals?</TE>
<TE>   A: One of the things that separates Thousand Oaks from the rest of
the county is the incredible amount of volunteerism and people
willing to give of their time and money. I like the idea of giving
more of that at the county level. I went to the RAIN shelter [for
homeless families] and saw those people living in very poor
conditions. Through that experience, I was able to bring some of that
volunteerism and giving to that shelter. There are a lot of resources
the county and city can provide together to provide incentives for
such things as affordable housing.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Has county government gone overboard on its funding for public
safety departments such as the Sheriff's Department and the district
attorney's office?</TE>
<TE>   A: What we have in our county is the cream of the crop. Look at
our Sheriff's Department, our firefighters. It's important to see
that we retain these individuals. We need to assure that we have
competitive wages with other areas. That's key. I also know that they
put their lives on the line and deserve greater compensation. I
support binding arbitration because they are unable to strike.
However, I believe that how [Proposition 172] money is allocated can
be shifted within the four public safety departments that receive it.
The people have voted for that revenue to go to public safety, so
that's where it goes.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Are sheriff's deputies asking too much in contract negotiations
by demanding essentially their full salary as retirement
compensation?</TE>
<TE>   A: We need a program in place with the type of retirement benefits
that are competitive with other areas. I would like to see it given
to those already hired, but we should phase it in. The county is
already facing a [$20-million] shortfall, so the timing unfortunately
isn't there. But we do have good employees and people putting their
lives on the line. I'm for paying them the best that we possibly can.
I don't believe the funds are available to do full retroactive
benefits. But we can say that's our goal and that's where we are
headed.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Are you worried that lower-income families are being priced out
of Ventura County?</TE>
<TE>   A: I am concerned, absolutely. The city of Thousand Oaks has the
best record in the county in terms of innovation and providing
affordable housing units. We have actually committed to adding
another 1,700, even though we are close to residential build-out.
That's about 10% of the houses that are coming. SOAR [growth-control
laws] don't prevent the build-out of cities' general plans. A lot of
this is the economy. Houses are expensive in our county. The only way
to go about limiting that is to not continue building these
half-million-dollar houses. Those are the predominant type of houses
being built. Ahmanson Ranch is almost all luxury homes. This is not
what we need. There has to be the ability to have smaller houses, and
allow for developers to produce a product that is certainly still
going to sell, but doesn't end up turning into what we have, which is
mansionization going on.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What is the biggest problem voters should have with your
opponent?</TE>
<TE>   A: Can you trust somebody who is being funded by developers? Can
you really trust him when he says that he's for slow growth and
protecting open space and ridgelines. I find there is a real conflict
of interest there. Can you trust someone who claims to be fiscally
astute but who is eighth in the nation for campaign debt? He owes
$830,000 from his last [congressional] campaign.</TE>
<TE>   He has done two things in public life. One is his failed run in
1998 for Congress, where he racked up almost a million dollars in
debt, and his biggest contributors were developers. His other thing
in public life is running for supervisor and he is starting off by
taking almost half of his money from developers. He has no track
record and no community service, other than running for office. I
question his ability to represent residents in the manner in which he
claims. You often have politicians that will say anything to get
elected.</TE>
<TE>   The difference between the two of us is that while he is saying
he's going to do it [preserve open space], I'm doing it.</TE>

<TE>   LINDA PARKS</TE>
<TE>   Age: 44</TE>
<TE>   Occupation: Thousand Oaks City Councilwoman</TE>
<TE>   Education: Bachelor's degree in political science from Cal Poly
San Luis Obispo; master's in urban planning from University of
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Background: Parks worked as a transportation planner in the 1980s
and then took a break to raise her children. She began her public
life as a slow-growth activist, opposing construction of the
3,050-home Ahmanson Ranch development at the county's eastern edge.
She served on the Thousand Oaks Planning Commission and is in the
middle of a second four-year term on the City Council. She was mayor
in 1998-99. She serves on other boards, including Conejo Open Space
Conservation Agency, Ventura County Air Pollution Control Board,
Local Agency Formation Commission and the Conejo Valley Hospital Task
Force. Her volunteer activities include founding the Ventura County
Discovery Center, a children's science center, and service with SOAR
Inc., an open-space advocacy group. Parks lives in Thousand Oaks with
her husband and four children, ages 11 to 17.</TE>
<TE>   Campaign: Parks has run a low-key campaign that relies heavily on
a grass-roots network of like-minded supporters. Voluntarily limiting
donations to $500 per individual, she has raised just under $74,000.
Parks is endorsed by a variety of environmental groups, activists
opposed to the Ahmanson Ranch project, several county public
officials and SEIU, the county's largest labor union.</TE>

<HD>Fillmore the Last to Join SOAR Fight</HD>
<DH>Planning: Passage of an anti-growth measure caps period of
similar rules across the county.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forging the final link in a countywide chain of growth-control
measures, Fillmore officials have adopted restrictions that shield
hundreds of acres of farmland and open space surrounding the city
from urban development.</LD>
<LD>   The new law, approved this month by the Fillmore City Council,
prevents the city from growing beyond designated borders without
voter approval until 2020.</LD>
<LD>   The small Santa Clara Valley farm town became the eighth of
Ventura County's 10 cities--plus the county at large--to adopt the
slow-growth measure known as Save Open Space and Agricultural
Resources or SOAR.</LD>
<TE>   And it capped a grass-roots movement to throw up barricades around
every community threatened by unchecked growth, a coordinated
campaign that has swept across the county in recent years in an
effort to save what remains of its fertile topsoil.</TE>
<TE>   "It is absolutely the final link in the chain," said Bill Fulton,
a Ventura-based expert on regional planning and development.</TE>
<TE>   The only cities that have not adopted SOAR boundaries are
landlocked Port Hueneme and Ojai, which allows development at a rate
so slow that additional restrictions are not required, Fulton said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no place else in the state that has enacted these kinds
of urban growth boundaries plus voter restrictions on rural land," he
said. "That's why we continue to get national attention."</TE>
<TE>   The movement began in 1995 in Ventura, where slow-growth activists
unveiled an anti-sprawl blueprint--patterned after a court-tested
Napa County law--that would effectively put thousands of acres in and
around the city off limits to urban development.</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of the measure were provisions that stripped elected
officials of the power to rezone farmland and open space without
voter approval. Days after voters threw their weight behind the
ballot measure, architects of the slow-growth campaign began talking
about pushing the same kind of greenbelt protections countywide.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing breeds success like success," said Oxnard attorney
Richard Francis, coauthor of Ventura's SOAR measure and a key player
in the countywide campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "When we were successful in Ventura, there were a number of people
countywide interested in becoming more active on a larger scale," he
said. "It took a couple of years for us to realize we might be able
to do that, but once that realization came, the plan really was to
get every city and the county on the same page."</TE>
<TE>   In fall 1998, voters overwhelmingly approved a countywide SOAR
measure that prevents farmland and open space outside cities from
being rezoned for development without voter approval.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, voters in Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks, Camarillo
and Oxnard adopted similar initiatives. Moorpark voters followed suit
in 2000 and Santa Paula hopped on the SOAR bandwagon the next year.</TE>
<TE>   Fillmore was the last to climb aboard, as residents grew
increasingly concerned about checking development in one of the
region's last predominantly agricultural valleys.</TE>
<TE>   The issue was seen as particularly crucial in the bucolic farm
town because of the planned construction of the 21,600-home Newhall
Ranch project east of the city, just across the Los Angeles County
line.</TE>
<TE>   After bruising campaigns on both sides of the growth-control
issue, Fillmore voters in November 2000 rejected two growth measures,
one sponsored by SOAR proponents and a less restrictive law sponsored
by the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   Months later, SOAR backers filed a second growth-control plan with
the city and began collecting signatures to put another measure
before voters next fall.</TE>
<TE>   This time, however, Fillmore officials and slow-growth advocates
were able to reach a compromise on a proposed development boundary
for the city, avoiding another showdown at the ballot box.</TE>
<TE>   Under the compromise reached late last year, the Fillmore SOAR
group agreed to push a new measure that adds 46 acres to the
inventory of land that can be developed without a public vote. City
leaders have maintained that the additional acreage is needed to
accommodate development projects necessary to meet housing needs.</TE>
<TE>   In return, City Council members pledged to adopt the new
growth-control measure once SOAR supporters gathered enough
signatures to put it on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "We're confident that everything is in place now and that we've
accomplished what we set out to do, which was to give the citizenry a
greater voice in how their community is going to grow," SOAR
proponent Paul Harding said. "It doesn't mean there will be no
growth. It just means whoever is promoting growth is going to have to
take their case to the people and win the support of the people."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, while the new law shields sensitive areas near the state
fish hatchery and Goodenough Road from development, it still provides
for construction--without voter approval--of the largest development
in Fillmore's history.</TE>
<TE>   That project, an ambitious mix of houses, parkland and a new
elementary school proposed by Griffin Industries, is awaiting city
approval. But the new growth-control law has forced the developer to
scale back the project from its original vision of 1,000 homes on 400
acres to 750 units on 236 acres.</TE>
<TE>   But on all sides of the issue, even at Griffin Industries, there
is appreciation that the issue was settled by compromise rather than
another divisive showdown at the ballot box.</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Kathy Long, who represents the Fillmore area,
said attention in Fillmore and elsewhere should now turn to finding
ways of accommodating necessary growth within SOAR-created
boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   "You now have consensus, whether it be by leadership or
initiative, that there needs to be growth in our respective
communities and contained within boundaries," said Long, noting that
SOAR's 2020 expiration date provides a deadline for answering key
development questions.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have communities [where residents] either came from,
or were certainly aware of, what they didn't want, which was
L.A.-Orange County sprawl," she said. "And by taking the steps they
have, they've now at least secured a baseline from which to work and
continue to preserve that dream."</TE>

<HD>County's Commuter Rail Expansion Plans on Track</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARRI KARUHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Transportation officials are moving forward with plans to expand
commuter rail service along the Ventura County line despite a
one-year dip in ridership.</LD>
<LD>   Construction is expected to begin next month on a $5.7-million
station in the Montalvo area of Ventura, where empty trains are
stored overnight but no passenger service exists. In June, work is
scheduled to start on an $8-million expansion of the existing
Camarillo station, which officials hope will evolve into a
transportation hub for commuters and students attending Cal State
Channel Islands when it opens this fall.</LD>
<LD>   The projects, financed with state and federal dollars allocated to
the Ventura County Transportation Commission, come as Metrolink
prepares to spend $200,000 on a survey to determine why ridership has
not increased as hoped on its rail lines throughout the six-county
Southern California area.</LD>
<TE>   Metrolink and the Southern California Assn. of Governments will
hire private firms to conduct the one-year study, which will involve
a random poll--by phone and mail--of about 26,800 households
throughout the region.</TE>
<TE>   Residents will be asked about their travel habits, including their
choice of transportation, whether they ride or have ever ridden
Metrolink, and why former riders stopped using the commuter trains.</TE>
<TE>   "This information will help us be able to hopefully target our
services better," Metrolink spokeswoman Sharon Gavin said.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to conduct the study, expected to be finished by
spring 2003, was made last year after Metrolink learned that
ridership was decreasing.</TE>
<TE>   Since Metrolink service began, ridership along the Ventura County
line steadily increased from 22,781 passengers in 1993 to a peak of
45,202 in 2000. But in 2001, the number of commuters dipped to
41,329. And last month, 221 fewer passengers rode weekday trains
along the line--which stretches from Oxnard to Union Station in
downtown Los Angeles--than did during December 2000, Gavin said.</TE>
<TE>   Metrolink hopes to attract riders by making more trains available.
Earlier this month, the rail service added a northbound stop (about
10 a.m.) in Simi Valley and Moorpark and a 10th southbound train that
stops in those cities after 11 a.m., before continuing to Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, commuters in Moorpark and Simi Valley had to wait more
than six hours between the last morning southbound train (about 8:30
a.m.) and the first southbound train in the afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "The more trains we have out there, the more people we can attract
to use the service beyond the regular commuters that you would
expect," said Mary Travis, manager of rail programs for the Ventura
County Transportation Commission.</TE>
<TE>   "People just doing day trips--or half-day trips to Glendale, the
Burbank area or as far as Los Angeles--we want to encourage them to
use the trains too."</TE>
<TE>   John Brand, senior management analyst for Moorpark, agrees. Before
the schedule was expanded, Brand said he received many calls from
commuters requesting a midday train to Los Angeles to get to doctor
appointments, as well as to Burbank Airport.</TE>
<TE>   "People lead really busy lives with work and families, businesses
and appointments," Brand said. "On the days when there isn't an
alternative train to take, people shift their mode of transportation
from the train to the car, or carpool."</TE>
<TE>   Transportation advocates say more service is needed to coax people
out of their cars.</TE>
<TE>   "Extra capacity, even if it's not needed today, will definitely be
needed in the not-so-distant future, given the population growth that
our region is going to continue to experience over the next 10 to 20
years," Southern California Assn. of Governments spokesman Jeff
Lustgarten said. The station in Montalvo is expected to open by fall.
It will be Metrolink's northernmost stop along the Ventura County
line. It will include a platform, ticket machines, 60 parking spaces,
lighting and landscaping.</TE>
<TE>   The Camarillo station expansion, scheduled to be finished by fall
2004, will double to 600 the number of parking spaces for commuters
and students at nearby Cal State Channel Islands.</TE>

<HD>Olympics Scrambles to Bridge Generation Gap</HD>
<DH>Marketing: With TV viewership in decline, organizers hope to make
the Games more relevant to younger Americans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The upcoming Winter Olympics seem to be a marketing and financial
dream. Corporations have poured a record sum into Olympic sponsorship
deals. And, despite the recession, NBC has sold more than 95% of the
commercial time available during its broadcasts from Salt Lake City.</LD>
<LD>   But beneath the rosy glow, there is a growing concern that the Olympic
movement may fall victim to a generation gap that could erode the
popularity and financial strength of future Games.</LD>
<LD>   Olympic viewership ratings have been sliding for the last decade,
dragged down largely by the absence of free-spending young adults. It
seems younger people don't find the Games as relevant or compelling as
their baby boomer parents do.</LD>
<TE>   Seeking to boost interest among young adults, NBC is carrying its
Olympic promotions online, into movie theaters, onto leading college
campuses and into trendy nightclubs. And the U.S. Olympic Committee has
pledged to work with the network and Olympic marketing partners to become
the "lightning rod" that recharges interest in the Olympics among younger
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Olympic caretakers also are concerned that the next
generation of corporate executives, awash in a sea of attractive
marketing partnerships, will be less interested in forging costly Olympic
sponsorship deals. And, as the costs of grooming athletes and building
Olympic venues keep rising, such a decline could be financially
crippling.</TE>
<TE>   No one should mistake the Olympics for a 98-pound weakling. When it
comes to public awareness in the United States, the Olympic Games
continue to outshine the National Football League and other sports
leagues. On the global scene, only World Cup soccer is as powerful a
force. But it's clear that the Olympic movement and its partners need to
cash in on that capital.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't rest on the laurels of the incredible legacy of our Olympic
movement," said Lloyd D. Ward, the U.S. Olympic Committee's chief
executive. "Young people today are a 'show me' culture so you have to go
through a rebirth, you have to renew your brand equity for each
succeeding generation."</TE>
<TE>   To keep today's advertisers and sponsors happy--and ensure that
today's younger viewers will continue to tune in as they grow older--the
Olympics must restore television ratings. High ratings translate into
heftier advertising fees. And corporations that need to move colas, cars,
cell phones and candy bars--largely to free-spending young adults--won't
keep signing checks if Olympic broadcasts can't deliver.</TE>
<TE>Steep Decline in Young Viewers
   Network executives have reason to be alarmed by the drop in viewership
among adults ages 18 to 24. Between the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona,
Spain, and the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, Australia, viewership among
men in that highly coveted age group fell by 55%. And viewership among
women in the same age bracket fell by 41%. Those numbers are well beyond
the 16% overall decline among all households during the same period, a
drop network executives tie to the ongoing splintering of mass media that
has hurt all sports broadcasts.</TE>
<TE>   At issue, observers say, is how Americans view the Olympics. Baby
boomers clearly remember the Olympics as "this singular, special event,"
said Alan Wurtzel, NBC's president of research and media development. But
observers say NBC and its Olympic partners haven't educated younger
adults on what makes the Olympics so special.</TE>
<TE>   The generational challenges arise at a time when corporate sponsors
are being wooed by creative marketing executives at such competing
attractions as the Academy Awards and the Super Bowl. Olympic caretakers
also are struggling to keep the Games relevant to young Americans who are
embracing extreme sports that don't always fit into the Olympic mold.</TE>
<TE>   Olympic marketers might well be talking about Joy De Guzman, 25, a
first-year UC Berkeley law student who is only vaguely aware that the
Winter Games are fast approaching.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know when, and I don't know what channel they're on," said De
Guzman, who watches sitcoms, not sports, when she chooses to linger in
front of a television.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Farrell, a 32-year-old tax attorney in Los Angeles, said he's
more likely to be watching college basketball or professional football
than the Olympics. Other than women's figure skating, the Winter Games
mean "very little" to a guy who doesn't own skis, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Olympic generation gap is a product largely of time and history.</TE>
<TE>   Viewers older than 35 watch the Olympics through a lens colored by
"the prism of the Cold War," NBC's Wurtzel said. "It was the good guys
against the bad guys."</TE>
<TE>   The Olympics are etched into the collective experience of aging baby
boomers along with the Vietnam War and Richard Nixon's resignation.</TE>
<TE>   The 1968 Summer Games in Mexico City produced the unforgetable image
of black Americans Tommie Smith and John Carlos bowing their heads and
giving a Black Power salute from the medals platform after the 200-meter
run. A shocked world watched the 1972 Summer Games in Munich, Germany,
when terrorists murdered 11 Israeli athletes.</TE>
<TE>Games Viewed as 'Big Media Event'
   The Cold War also shaped competition. The U.S. boycotted the Moscow
Summer Games in 1980 after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. The
Soviets retaliated by staying home from the 1984 Los Angeles Summer
Games.</TE>
<TE>   The Cold War is over, but boomers are still aglow over the 1980
"Miracle on Ice," when the unsung U.S. hockey team beat the powerful
Soviet Union squad. And boomers are still seething over the 1972
basketball gold medal game, when the Soviet Union upset the vaunted U.S.
team.</TE>
<TE>   Absent that historical context, younger viewers tend to view the
Olympics as "a big media event" not unlike the Golden Globes or the Super
Bowl, Wurtzel said.</TE>
<TE>   Baby boomers who control the networks were raised to view athletics
"as pure sport, not entertainment," said Rick Burton, executive director
of the Warsaw Sports Marketing Center at the University of Oregon. But
Generation Y, Burton said, wants its sports prepared with a liberal
sprinkling of music, entertainment and fashion to create a tasty
lifestyle stew.</TE>
<TE>   Savvy marketers are learning that the customer--in this case, the
viewer watching television at home--usually is right. Sports, they say,
might be the main event, but it doesn't have to exist in a vacuum. That's
why the NFL's weekend-long Super Bowl bash in New Orleans next Sunday is
top-heavy with such pop stars as Mary J. Blige, Mariah Carey, Sting and
U2. The annual halftime show enjoys some of the strongest ratings of
what's usually the top-rated television broadcast each year.</TE>
<TE>Music, Lifestyle Elements Planned
   The Olympics and NBC are taking a page from the NFL's playbook and
jamming as many music and lifestyle events as possible into broadcasts
from Salt Lake City. But NBC's production chiefs won't tinker with the
athletic action, so don't expect rock videos blaring during the half-pipe
event.</TE>
<TE>   But the drama of the opening ceremony Feb. 8 will be expanded to
include such popular entertainers as the Dixie Chicks and LeAnn Rimes.
And, after each night's medals presentation, viewers will be invited to
stick around for concerts starring top acts, including Sheryl Crow and
the Dave Matthews Band.</TE>
<TE>   Music and lifestyle elements are there to draw "people who don't
necessarily identify themselves as sports fans," said David Neal, an
executive vice president of NBC Olympics. "If we can get them to sample
the opening night's programming, we truly believe we'll get them to come
back."</TE>
<TE>   NBC also recognizes that younger viewers aren't always tuned into
network or cable stations, although it continues to flood its airwaves
with Olympic promotions. But NBC also is using other means to reach
potential Olympic viewers.</TE>
<TE>   NBC produced a glossy commercial featuring Olympians Chris Klug and
Cammi Granato that is playing as a theatrical trailer. It also created a
Web site (\o7 www.hotsnow.com\f7 ) that's top-heavy with music and
action-sports videos.</TE>
<TE>   Two Winnebagos loaded with state-of-the-art sound systems, video games
and bins filled with giveaways are crisscrossing the country to spread
the Olympic word. The mobile marketing machines stop in parking lots
outside such events as a Creed concert at Philadelphia's First Union
Center and the Wild Hare, a Chicago bar that describes itself as the
"reggae capital of America."</TE>
<TE>   NBC also is teaming up with Coca-Cola Co. and Burly Bear, a cable
television network serving college campuses, to encourage new viewers by
hosting opening ceremony parties Feb. 8 at bars near 50 big campuses,
including UCLA, Arizona State and Harvard.</TE>
<TE>   Generational issues also drove the U.S. Olympic Committee's recent
decision to hire sports-marketing giant IMG, which represents such stars
as Tiger Woods, to broker corporate sponsorships through the 2008 Summer
Olympics in Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Prazmark, a sports marketing executive who began brokering
Olympic marketing deals in the 1980s--and who will serve as IMG's
president of Olympic sales and marketing--said he faces a potential
generation gap at the top of the corporate world. More than half a dozen
Olympic supporters, including Arthur Martinez (Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.),
Hugh McColl (Bank of America) and Paul A. Allaire (Xerox Corp.), have
already retired or soon will.</TE>
<TE>   Top corporate executives have a wealth of sponsorship choices that
weren't even close to the Olympics in stature when Prazmark began
brokering Olympic deals in the 1980s. "I'm looking over my shoulder at
the NFL, the Academy Awards, the NBA, the Grammys--and excuse me, please,
to anyone else I'm forgetting," he said. "All of a sudden, the gap is
really narrow."</TE>
<TE>   And, as the gap between the Olympics and competing properties narrows,
corporate sponsors no longer will be content to simply "rent the rings,"
as Prazmark said, and slap them on cola cups, delivery trucks and
corporate letterheads.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to reintroduce the whole reason why a corporation becomes
involved with the Olympics," he said. "That's really our main
job--reintroducing the Olympic proposition to a new corporate
leadership."</TE>
<TE>   Along with the rest of the world, the Olympic movement is adjusting to
new realities created by the events of Sept. 11. New NBC market research
suggests that younger adults are rethinking their country's role in the
world. A stunning 80% of younger adults now say they have an interest in
the Games. But the question remains, will they be watching?</TE>

<HD>Suspect May Be Southeast Asia's Link to Al Qaeda</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>RICHARD C. PADDOCK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MANILA
</DL>
<LD>Sometimes he calls himself Mike, sometimes Abu Saad. He speaks
several languages and has traveled through much of the Islamic world. His
specialty: blowing things up, especially public buildings crowded with
people.</LD>
<LD>   Now he sits in a concrete cell at the national police headquarters in
Manila. Investigators suspect that he is linked to Osama bin Laden's Al
Qaeda organization. And on Saturday, authorities in Singapore said he was
a man with a mission: to activate an underground terror network after
Sept. 11 and initiate a wave of bomb attacks against Western targets,
including the U.S. Embassy in Singapore.</LD>
<LD>   They also confirmed that his real name is Fathur Rohman Al-Ghozi.</LD>
<TE>   Born in Indonesia, the 30-year-old Muslim was arrested Jan. 15 by
Philippine immigration officials acting on a tip from Singapore. He could
prove to be the common thread linking extremist Islamic groups operating
in at least four countries: the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia and
Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   During interrogation, Al-Ghozi admitted responsibility for five bombs
that exploded 13 months ago in Manila, killing 22 people and injuring
about 100. He also told investigators where to find a ton of buried TNT
and a stash of automatic weapons that were to be used in upcoming attacks
against U.S. facilities in the region.</TE>
<TE>   "The timely arrest of Al-Ghozi and three other suspected terrorists
and the seizure of their explosive and firearms cache thwarted plans of
the extremist groups to conduct bombing activities in Metro Manila and
abroad," Philippine police said in a statement after his arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Al-Ghozi may well be the most important catch yet in the breakup of
the Jemaah Islamiah terrorist network that has led to 13 arrests in
Singapore, 23 in Malaysia and five in the Philippines during the last two
months.</TE>
<TE>   "According to our information, he had a mission to conduct terrorist
attacks in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, in particular the U.S. and
Israeli embassies in Singapore," said Gen. Crescencio Maralit, chief
spokesman for the Philippine federal police.</TE>
<TE>   For investigators, Al-Ghozi could help unravel the complex web of
connections among terrorist groups in the region. For example:</TE>
<TE>   * As a teenager in Indonesia, he attended an Islamic school in Central
Java co-founded by Muslim cleric Abu Bakar Bashir, who is accused of
heading the Jemaah Islamiah network.</TE>
<TE>   * In the Philippines, police identify Al-Ghozi as a demolitions
expert, bomb maker and explosives trainer for the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front, a separatist group seeking to create an Islamic state in the
southern Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   * In Singapore, besides confirming that he went by the code name
"Mike," authorities said Saturday that he had brought orders in October
for the Jemaah Islamiah terror cells to begin acquiring explosives for
attacks on U.S. targets. He worked with a second foreign operative
code-named "Sammy" who is believed to be linked with Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   The connections between these groups could have important
ramifications for the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Washington has begun deploying a force of 650 troops to the southern
Philippines to help train Philippine soldiers to combat Abu Sayyaf, a
rebel gang of Islamic kidnappers holding two American missionaries
hostage there. Some officials suggest that there is a link between Al
Qaeda and the brutal Abu Sayyaf, although the evidence is sketchy at
best.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, no connection has been established between Al Qaeda and the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which has an armed force of about 15,000
troops and is negotiating a peace agreement with the Philippine
government after years of fighting. But if Al-Ghozi's arrest leads to
evidence that Al Qaeda and the Moro rebels are allied, the United States
could find itself facing a wider conflict in the region.</TE>
<TE>   The eldest of four children, Al-Ghozi grew up in the East Java
district of Madiun. When he was 12, his parents sent him to a boarding
school called Al-Mukmin in the city of Solo, where he lived and studied
for the next six years. His parents say they chose the school because it
emphasized discipline and didn't cost too much.</TE>
<TE>   The school itself has become controversial since the detention of
suspected Jemaah Islamiah members in Singapore and Malaysia. Some of
those arrested have identified Bashir, the network's co-founder, as the
overall leader of Jemaah Islamiah.</TE>
<TE>   Police in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, questioned the 63-year-old
cleric for two days last week about his connection to Jemaah Islamiah,
but he has not been arrested.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with The Times on Saturday, Bashir said he had never
met Al-Ghozi.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard about Al-Ghozi from the newspapers," Bashir said. "People say
he studied in my school in 1987 or 1988, and at that time I was living in
Malaysia. So I don't really know who he is."</TE>
<TE>   According to his parents, upon Al-Ghozi's graduation at 18 in 1989, he
received a full scholarship to study at a religious school in Pakistan.
Bashir said he and the Al-Mukmin school played no part in sending the
young student to the South Asian subcontinent.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he got a scholarship, but I don't know from where," said
Al-Ghozi's father, Zainuri, a local legislator in Madiun. "When he was in
Pakistan, he never contacted us. Not a telephone call. Not even a letter.
Sometimes we wondered how he was doing."</TE>
<TE>   It was common for Al Qaeda to recruit potential operatives from
religious schools in Pakistan, but there is no indication whether
Al-Ghozi spent time in Afghanistan or attended Al Qaeda training camps
there.</TE>
<TE>   His parents said he left Pakistan in 1995 and returned to Indonesia to
visit the family. He left after a month, saying he was moving to
Malaysia. They did not see him again for three more years.</TE>
<TE>   The last time he was home was eight months ago, when he brought his
wife, a Malaysian, to visit. He told his father that he was working as a
preacher in Malaysia.</TE>
<TE>   Al-Ghozi's mother, Rukanah, says her son was devoted to Islam and
fasted every Monday and Thursday. When he was home, they prayed together.
He prized cleanliness and always read the Koran after praying, she says.
Sometimes he would tell his mother not to talk in a loud voice because
women should speak softly.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike many devout Muslims--but like the Sept. 11 hijackers--Al-Ghozi
usually wore Western-style clothes and was clean-shaven.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot forget his kindness," his mother said. "All our family cried
when they heard the news, because we think that he is a very nice
person."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators have revealed little about Al-Ghozi's travels since 1995
but indicate that he spent time in the Philippines, Singapore and
Malaysia.</TE>
<TE>   During questioning, he confessed to police that he provided money and
explosives for the deadly bombings in Manila on Dec. 30, 2000. He also
admitted that he phoned the police and the media, identified himself as
"a freedom fighter" and claimed credit for the blasts, which went off
almost simultaneously in busy parts of the capital, including a transit
station.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators recently began examining whether the Manila bombings may
have been connected to explosions in Indonesia six days earlier. That
Christmas Eve, bombs went off nearly simultaneously in churches in 10
cities, killing 19 people and injuring more than 100.</TE>
<TE>   Police are also looking at the possibility that Al-Ghozi was connected
to a heretofore-unexplained blast at the Philippine Embassy in Jakarta on
Aug. 1, 2000, that seriously injured Ambassador Leonides Caday and killed
two other people.</TE>
<TE>   Philippine authorities arrested Al-Ghozi in the early morning of Jan.
15 just hours before he was scheduled to leave the country and fly to the
Thai capital, Bangkok. He was picked up in a largely Muslim neighborhood
of Manila about a mile from the presidential palace.</TE>
<TE>   He claimed to be a Filipino and was using Philippine travel documents
under three names--Al-Ghozi, Abu Saad and Sammy Salih Jamil.</TE>
<TE>   But under questioning, police say, he quickly admitted his role in the
Manila bombings and told officials of the explosives hidden in the
southern Philippine city of General Santos.</TE>
<TE>   "According to his own admission, he was deeply involved in the Dec. 30
bombings," Gen. Maralit said. "He admitted that he supplied money and
explosives for the bombing. He was one of the key players."</TE>
<TE>   Some officials wonder if his rapid confession was aimed at steering
police away from a grander scheme, such as a planned attack elsewhere in
the region.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities in Singapore say Al-Ghozi and the operative named Sammy
arrived in the city-state in October and began working with a five-member
Jemaah Islamiah cell to videotape potential targets. A copy of the
videotape was found by police in the office of Fathi Abu Bakar Bafana,
one of the cell members.</TE>
<TE>   Members of another Jemaah Islamiah cell had prepared a plan in 1999 to
bomb U.S. sailors near a transit station in Singapore, authorities say.
The group videotaped the targets and delivered a copy of the tape to a
top Al Qaeda leader in Afghanistan. Al Qaeda leaders decided not to
proceed with the bombing, but the plan convinced them that the Singapore
group could mount a successful terror attack, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Among the targets that Al-Ghozi and his collaborators cased in October
were the U.S. and Israeli embassies, the British and Australian high
commissions and commercial buildings where prominent U.S. companies have
offices, authorities say.</TE>
<TE>   Al-Ghozi and Sammy directed the cell members to purchase 17 tons of
ammonium nitrate, a highly explosive fertilizer, to make truck bombs.
Once the local cell prepared the explosives, according to the plan, an
outsider would carry out the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   However, based on a tip from a local citizen, Singaporean police
already had members of the group under surveillance. In December, before
the cell could take delivery of the fertilizer, police arrested 13
suspected members.</TE>
<TE>   Singaporean authorities said that it was arrested cell members who
identified Al-Ghozi as "Mike." "Sammy" has not been found.</TE>

<DH>Mohamed Atta, whose hard gaze has stared from a billion television

incarnate.</DH>

<DL>WILHELMSBURG, Germany
</DL>
<LD>After Mohamed el Amir Atta disappeared from the Technical
University of Hamburg-Harburg in 1997, he turned up here on an island in
the middle of the Elbe River, at a red-brick prewar housing project on a
broad, bleak street that faces a ribbon-wire fence and the Hamburg
harbor, gray and forbidding, beyond.</LD>
<LD>   Wilhelmsburg is industrial, worn-out, so psychologically remote that
it is sometimes called the Forgotten Island. It's here but hidden. If you
wanted to vanish, to drop off the face of the world and yet keep the
world close at hand, this would be a place to come to.</LD>
<LD>   The six-story buildings of the Wilhelmsburg projects contain hundreds
of two- and three-room apartments and nobody knows how many people. The
buildings are filled mainly with Turks, by far the largest minority group
in Germany.</LD>
<TE>   Atta rented a third-floor, three-room walk-up for $250 a month. The
apartment, neighbors say, was home to a large group of Arab men who were
seldom seen and, until the events of Sept. 11, not much remembered. Like
the island itself, they were here but hidden, shielded by their
otherness.</TE>
<TE>   The men talked long into the night most nights and disappeared all day
most days, said Helga Link, a neighbor. Link lived directly beneath
Atta's apartment and could hear every footstep on the wooden floors. She
never heard a radio or television or music. Just the footsteps and voices
of men talking.</TE>
<TE>   Atta's stay in Wilhelmsburg marked a turning point in his life. He had
until then followed an utterly conventional middle-class path, a
striving, upward arc from boyhood through prestigious university and into
graduate school. When he left, he turned in directions that people who
knew him still can't fathom.</TE>
<TE>   In the days after Sept. 11, a narrative of the attacks emerged with
remarkable speed. These were hard, dedicated men, we learned, religious
zealots executing a devious plan to strike at the core of America.
Central to the narrative was Atta. In numerous accounts, he was referred
to as the mastermind. Osama bin Laden was said to be the evil leader who
inspired and funded the plot; Atta was the brilliant acolyte who led a
small, suicidal army in its execution.</TE>
<TE>   Not much has altered this narrative since. Bin Laden remains the
sinister presence behind the plot, taunting from a shrinking but thus far
unbridgeable distance. The hijackers remain mute, unknowable ciphers.
Atta, whose hard gaze has fumed from a billion television screens and
newspaper pages, has become, for many, the face of evil incarnate.</TE>
<TE>   He has become famous. A woman in Finland claims that he was her
virtual lover. A Hamburg shopkeeper claims that she regularly sold Atta
large quantities of mid-priced perfume, for what purpose no one pretends
to know. A genial car repairman says Atta worked as an intermediary for
Arab car-buyers. They liked Mercedes-Benzes, the repairman says.</TE>
<TE>   Atta is said to have lived a double life; to have met with an Iraqi
spy in the Czech Republic; to have traveled throughout Europe conferring
with who knows what members of terrorist cells; to have so excelled in
his terrorist training that he was chosen to form his own cell in
Hamburg.</TE>
<TE>   Some of these stories might be true, but as details of Atta's life are
examined and new ones uncovered, a less mysterious, more mundane man
emerges. It is a man drawn on a smaller, less epic scale.</TE>
<TE>   The people who knew Atta best during the past decade--housemates,
roommates, co-workers and classmates--say he was taciturn, introspective
and zealously religious.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm more fundamental than the fundamentalists," he told his first
Hamburg roommate.</TE>
<TE>   He was an exceptionally resolute, disciplined, stoic man. He
was--particularly for a university graduate student--enormously
respectful of authority. He did what he was told. Joerg Lewin, who hired
Atta as a draftsman at an urban planning firm, said Atta did his job with
extraordinary single-mindedness. Although already a trained architect and
a prospective city planner, Atta--in four years at the company--never
offered opinions of the plans he was asked to illustrate. He was assigned
to make maps; he made maps.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he embodied the idea of drawing," Lewin said. " 'I am the
drawer. I draw.' "</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to imagine that such a man could acquire the verve and
daring to lead an enterprise as audacious as the September attacks. Maybe
we have misconceived the nature of the attacks and built the requisite
figure to orchestrate them. Maybe a brilliant general is not what was
needed. Maybe the plan wasn't so much difficult as it was detailed, and
what it really required was somebody with will and steadfastness to see
it through.</TE>
<TE>   That is the Mohamed Atta described by the people who knew him: a
meticulous, dutiful believer, a man who could sublimate himself, a man
who could embody a plan, who could make it his, a man who could be, as he
became, a perfect soldier.</TE>
<TE>Kafr el Sheik / A STRICT, AUSTERE FATHER</TE>
<TE>   The Nile River delta is Egypt's breadbasket. The markets are full of
bananas, oranges, corn, guavas, figs, wheat, rice and lentils.</TE>
<TE>   The last village is never out of sight before you come to the next.
Men and animals work fields that are jigsawed across the land, small and
irregularly shaped. Women wear veils or head scarves; many men wear long
cotton tunics.</TE>
<TE>   Alleys are clogged with cotton bales and rice straw. Ducks and
chickens pick their way through scraps in tiny street-side pens. The
roads are full of pickup trucks, the rare tractor and donkey carts;
uniformed schoolchildren are everywhere. Nokia cell phone advertisements
stand in front of ditches filled with trash, still water and women
bathing and washing dishes.</TE>
<TE>   Atta was born here in 1968 in the delta province of Kafr el Sheik. His
father, Mohamed el Amir Awad el Sayed Atta, came from a tiny provincial
village, and his mother, Bouthayna Mohamed Mustapha Sheraqi, from the
outskirts of the provincial capital, also called Kafr el Sheik.</TE>
<TE>   As is still customary in rural Egypt, his parents met and married by
arrangement of their families. Mohamed el Amir (neither he nor his son
used the name Atta anywhere except on official documents) was already a
lawyer. Bouthayna was just 14, but as the daughter of a wealthy farming
and trading family, she came from several rungs up the social ladder.</TE>
<TE>   Mohamed was their last child. Two daughters, Azza and Mona, preceded
him. The father was regarded by his in-laws as austere, strict and
private.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly all of Egypt's 65 million people are squeezed by the
surrounding deserts into the narrow band of fertile land along the Nile.
The geography forces Egyptian life to be crowded, communal and shared. To
resist takes real effort. Atta's father was willing to expend it.</TE>
<TE>   "The father is alone. There are no brothers, one sister maybe. We
never met her," said Hamida Fateh, Atta's aunt on his mother's side.
"Here, the families are all very close. But even here, the father was
separate."</TE>
<TE>   Fateh's family owns land, an auto parts store and a large commercial
building. But the family lives on a cobbled, dirty street in a cramped
apartment with whitewashed walls, cheap rugs, stuffed furniture and a
television.</TE>
<TE>   The balcony door is open to let the heat escape. The lace curtains
barely stir. The idea of living behind closed doors here seems almost as
peculiar to Fateh as the idea that the boy who used to sit here on her
sofa flew an airliner into a skyscraper.</TE>
<TE>   A cousin, Essam Omar Rashad, nodded toward the television and said
that he and Mohamed, as teenagers, would watch it together. Mohamed, he
said, left the room whenever belly dancing programs--staples of Egyptian
broadcasting--came on.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, the call to afternoon prayer echoes down the block. You are
never out of earshot of the prayer call here. Fateh wears a head scarf,
but more out of habit, she said, than belief; neither her family nor
Atta's was particularly religious. Fateh studied agricultural engineering
at university. We are educated, secular people, she said, people from the
country but not country people.</TE>
<TE>   Fateh said Atta's father was always ambitious and focused. His law
practice thrived here, but he was not satisfied. "He moved to Cairo,"
Fateh said. "He wanted to be famous."</TE>
<TE>Cairo / 'A HOUSE OF STUDY'</TE>
<TE>   It's early morning on Eldmalsha Street and nothing moves, or will for
a while. Cairo, the capital, is a slow city in the morning. It's common
to find shops not yet open at 11 or noon. Breakfast is a rumor, and some
restaurants start lunch service at 4 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Residents see this as proof of their sophistication, a measure of
distance from the villages their ancestors left not decades but
millenniums ago.</TE>
<TE>   Mohamed Atta spent his adolescence here in Abdin, a cramped quarter
near the old financial and government centers. Much of the wealth of the
city has migrated to newer districts, west across the Nile and south and
east to new suburbs. Old core neighborhoods like Abdin have been left to
crumble.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the five- and six-story stone apartment buildings are
holdovers from British colonial rule, which didn't end until independence
in 1952. Lobbies are paved with marble and limestone, remnants of a
grander past. Few buildings have elevators, and stairwells are dark.</TE>
<TE>   Atta was 9 or 10 years old when the family arrived here. His father
rented a double flat, an entire floor. All three children got their own
rooms. The old apartment, like most interiors in Cairo, is dim and still,
windows covered against the sun.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Atta's father bought a vacation home on the Mediterranean
coast, but the family lived frugally in town. Atta's mother, Bouthayna,
did her own cooking and cleaning. The father drove a used Opel, then a
small Fiat sedan.</TE>
<TE>   When Fateh and her family came to visit Abdin, they found the father
had instilled his ambition in the children.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a house of study. No playing, no entertainment. Just study,"
Fateh said.</TE>
<TE>   The children weren't allowed to play outside the apartment. One
neighbor said the walk to school had been timed, and if the children took
longer than the allotted few minutes to get home, they would be asked
why.</TE>
<TE>   "His friends would sit on the corner there, chewing pistachios,
spitting out the shells. Not Mohamed. There was no hanging around, no
friends, very strict rules," said Mohamed Gamel Khamees, a neighbor who
runs an auto repair shop on the ground floor of the Attas' old building.</TE>
<TE>   "They came from a village, and they had their own traditions. They
brought them along," Khamees said. "They lived a closed family life. They
were very polite but had little contact with any others."</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors laughed at Bouthayna when she pulled a little handcart
behind her to the market. They thought that she was putting on airs. It
didn't matter. The family went its own way.</TE>
<TE>   The senior Atta, a huskier version of his son, is unapologetic about
his lack of sociability. He's a blustering, forceful man who delivers
speeches more often than answers. "We are people who keep to ourselves,"
he said. "We don't mix a lot with people, and we are all successful."</TE>
<TE>   Young Mohamed's room looked out the back of the building, over
rooftops and into a tangle of wires and adjacent windows. Neighbors said
Mohamed used his window for clandestine conversations with neighbor boys.
That was playtime.</TE>
<TE>   Abdin is one of the densest districts in one of the most densely
populated cities on Earth. The street is a place for entertaining, for
sport, for business.</TE>
<TE>   When visitors come, chairs and a tiny foot-high table are plopped down
in the street. Tea is served.</TE>
<TE>   A donkey cart loaded with dates rolls by. A sweet potato salesman
pushes his wagon past. In between the tea being poured and the sugar
offered, a man rolls a whetstone by. The cries of the knife man, the date
man and the sweet potato seller bounce down the stone alleys.</TE>
<TE>   It is hard to remain closed off here, even harder than in the delta.
Asked if Atta's family ever made exceptions--if, for example, it shared
evening breakfast with neighbors during the holy month of Ramadan, which
in Cairo is a period of daytime fasting but late-night socializing and
celebration--Khamees said no, the father was a tough man, not given to
making exceptions.</TE>
<TE>   The family, Khamees said, was "like a set of rings interlocked with
one another. They didn't visit and weren't visited." He paused for a
moment and waved a hand at the insects circling the sugar bowl. He looked
up at the apartment.</TE>
<TE>   "Not even the flies entered there," he said. "Not even the flies."</TE>
<TE>University / LOST IN A SEA OF STUDENTS</TE>
<TE>   All three children were superior students. Atta followed his two
sisters to Cairo University, one of the most prestigious colleges in the
country. Admission is granted solely on the basis of national tests.</TE>
<TE>   The university is mammoth, with 155,000 students and more than 7,000
teachers. It sprawls across both banks of the Nile, including an island
in between. The campus is so large, some students drive cars from class
to class.</TE>
<TE>   Degree programs are typically five years. The first year is a
preparatory year, used to direct students into major areas of study. If
you want to study medicine, for example, but your first-year grades are
insufficient, you might find yourself--without consultation or
consent--enrolled in the Department of Ornamental Horticulture.</TE>
<TE>   Students are grouped by their names.</TE>
<TE>   "I found him standing there, staring up at the name sheets to see
where he was assigned," said Mohamed Mokhtar el Rafei. "I introduced
myself. 'I'm Mohamed,' I said. So was he. We looked at the class sheets.
We had three full classes of Mohameds. Oh wow.</TE>
<TE>   "We used our fathers' names to refer to one another. I was Rafei. He
was always Amir."</TE>
<TE>   The two became friends. Both excelled in the first year, 1985, and
were chosen for engineering, one of the most venerable and prestigious
departments. Within engineering, the highest-scoring students were
assigned to the architecture program. The two Mohameds, whether they
wanted to, would be architects.</TE>
<TE>   The engineering department had nearly 1,000 teachers. The size meant
tremendous competition and--except for the very best students--little
attention from professors.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in his life, Atta did not stand out. Architecture,
more than most creative disciplines, is a blend of the utterly
pragmatic--what do you coat glass with to keep heat out and let light
in?--and the artistic--what should a house say? Atta shone at analytical
subjects, but the curriculum was skewed toward design.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a very clever person in mathematics, physical structures, less
good in design and the more artistic aspects," Rafei said. "He had been
one of the top-ranked students in high school, and he had a very high
rank in his preparatory year. In our time, though, design was emphasized,
and maybe you could say he couldn't adjust himself to what was needed. In
the third year, when we studied soils, street plans and steel, something
more concrete, he excelled. . . . You would recognize him more as an
engineer than an architect."</TE>
<TE>   Another classmate recalled that Atta became upset when things didn't
go his way.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a child," she said. "So like a child that one time something
happened, where he didn't get the grade he wanted, and he pouted.
Somebody said to him, 'You're acting like a child.' Then he got very,
very angry. Proving the point, he really was like a child. Spoiled."</TE>
<TE>   But mainly, Atta is remembered as utterly ordinary. "Mohamed was
there, sharing all our fun times. He liked it. He would tell jokes,
laugh. He was one of us," said Waleed Khairy, another classmate.</TE>
<TE>   Atta's father often drove him to and from school. This was not
unusual. In fact, unless they move to another city, many young adults
remain in their parents' homes until they marry. Many 30-year-olds eat
dinner at home every night.</TE>
<TE>Politics / A GROWING RELIGIOSITY</TE>
<TE>   Cairo is a plotter's paradise. There is a shortage of jobs and a
surplus of cafes filled with men, idling away days over sweet Turkish
coffee, water pipes, Marlboro Lights and filtered Cleopatras, filling the
narrow, cluttered streets with talk and soft, smoky haze. Not all the
talk is idle chatter.</TE>
<TE>   Egypt's history for the last half a century is one of sporadic
violence and constant tension between the government and Islamic
activists.</TE>
<TE>   President Hosni Mubarak came to power in 1981 when his predecessor,
Anwar Sadat, was assassinated by Islamic militants. Mubarak himself has
been the object of three dozen assassination plots. One of the results is
a repressive political system, democratic in name only. More than half
the officially recognized political parties have at one time or another
been barred from political activity.</TE>
<TE>   The involvement of religious groups in politics is forbidden. Members
of the strongest, most broadly active Islamic group--the Muslim
Brotherhood--are routinely jailed for violating this prohibition. The
lack of any avenue for legal dissent criminalizes political opposition
and almost ensures that it will become extreme.</TE>
<TE>   During Atta's college years, the Muslim Brotherhood conducted major
recruiting campaigns. It called for a return to basic Islamic principles
and warned against the corrupting forces of modernization and Egypt's
tilt toward the United States. Its campus activism coincided with a
period of increasing religiosity in Egypt generally.</TE>
<TE>   Atta was neither politically active nor particularly religious,
friends said. His father said he warned his children away from political
involvement. Far from advocating a resistance to the West, Atta's father
insisted that his son, in addition to his regular classwork, study
English and later German.</TE>
<TE>   He said he wanted his son to match his daughters' successes. Both had
excelled at the university: Azza became a botany professor, Mona a
cardiologist. Atta earned respectable grades, but they were not good
enough for acceptance to Cairo University's graduate school. His father
gave him a 1974 Fiat 128 coupe as a graduation present but insisted that
he continue his studies.</TE>
<TE>   "My son is a very sensitive man; he is soft and was extremely attached
to his mother. I almost tricked him to go to Germany to continue his
education. Otherwise, he never wanted to leave Egypt," Atta's father
said. "He didn't want to go. By pure coincidence, a friend of mine had
visitors from Germany, two high school teachers in Hamburg. I invited
them to dinner, and Mohamed was the king of the evening because he spoke
German fluently . . . and three weeks later, Mohamed went to Germany."</TE>
<TE>Hamburg / 'I AM GROWN UP NOW'</TE>
<TE>   When Mohamed Atta, 24 years old and on his own for the first time,
arrived in Hamburg in the summer of 1992, one of the first things he
asked for was the location of the nearest mosque.</TE>
<TE>   Atta's family was moderately religious but not publicly so. His
father, for example, said he reads the Koran every day, but none of the
family's old neighbors remembered ever seeing the Attas at the
neighborhood mosque. Once in Germany, Atta went every day.</TE>
<TE>   Atta lived, rent-free, with the two teachers he had met in Cairo. The
couple had been organizing exchange programs between Germany and Egypt
for several years. They had an extra room in their small cottage and were
happy to help. Atta arrived with a single suitcase. But in other
respects, he carried more baggage than almost anyone his hosts had ever
met.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to praying at the mosque and observing a strict Islamic
diet--no pork, no alcohol--Atta refrained from the pleasures young
students often sought. He seldom socialized, never went to clubs or
sporting events. Hamburg is a notably unrepressed city. Sex
businesses--theaters, prostitution, publishing--thrive. For someone who
would leave the room when belly dancers came on television, Hamburg can
come on strong.</TE>
<TE>   Atta's hosts had traveled often to Egypt; they welcomed cultural
differences. The woman initially liked Atta's seriousness. He was eisern,
she said--iron.</TE>
<TE>   They discussed religion. She knew the Old Testament well and tried to
make the point that the roots of Islam and Christianity were similar.
Mohamed would listen, then reply, yes, but what is written in the Koran
is the truth, the only truth. They would argue, the woman said, until she
left the room disgusted by his closed-mindedness.</TE>
<TE>   Atta went to Germany on a tourist visa. He would need a student visa
to attend graduate school but apparently hadn't understood that he could
get it only in Cairo.</TE>
<TE>   The teachers, on a trip to Cairo to make arrangements for other
students, put through his visa application. When they returned and told
him, he was quite angry.</TE>
<TE>   "I am grown up now; I can take care of that myself," he told them.</TE>
<TE>   "He said that a lot," one of his hosts said. " 'I am abroad now; I am
grown up. Now I can decide on my own.' "</TE>
<TE>   It seemed silly to resist their help, "but that's the way he was," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Atta made few friends. He could be amiable and polite but never warm.
The landlady felt that there was "always a wall between him and the
family."</TE>
<TE>   She said that eventually she didn't feel comfortable in her own home.
He would glare at her if she walked through the living room in a
sleeveless top. He complained when her adult, unmarried daughter came to
visit and brought along her young daughter. It was strange, she said. He
played with the little girl and obviously enjoyed it. "He was free. The
only time I remember him to be free," she said. But then he railed
against the licentiousness that produced the child.</TE>
<TE>   In the spring of 1993, by mutual agreement, Atta moved out of the
little cottage.</TE>
<TE>   When he had arrived in Hamburg, he intended to enroll for the fall
term in the graduate architecture program at the University of Applied
Sciences. He was denied admission. The university said the program was
full; Atta's father said this was simple prejudice. Atta sued, the
university relented, and he was quickly admitted. Then, just weeks into
his first term, he abruptly quit and enrolled in an urban planning
program at a different school, the Technical University of
Hamburg-Harburg.</TE>
<TE>   He told his hosts he realized belatedly that the architecture program
would be repetitive of his undergraduate work in Cairo.</TE>
<TE>   Technical University is not in Hamburg proper but south of the Elbe
River, in the old industrial suburb of Harburg. The Elbe forms what
planners here call a cultural border. People who live north of it seldom
cross over. Technical University was built south of that border 20 years
ago as an economic development measure for a declining Rust Belt town.
When Atta enrolled, it had only 5,000 students.</TE>
<TE>   The planning program, from which he hoped to receive the German
equivalent of a master's degree, was a good fit for Atta, in line with
his analytical ability and meticulousness. It opened up a field of study
that would combine those skills with his newly evident interest in Islam:
the preservation of old Islamic cities.</TE>
<TE>   The department was housed in a former police barracks that was left
standing as the new university was built around it. Fortuitously for
Atta, the department's chairman, Dittmar Machule, was a Mideast
specialist. Machule said he sensed in Atta someone who shared his passion
for the old cities of the region. He described Atta as "tender, sensitive
. . . he had deep, dark eyes. His eyes would speak. You could see the
intelligence, the knowledge, the alertness."</TE>
<TE>   Hans Harms, another professor, said Atta was "almost shy in the
beginning but engaged. I could see that he was listening, that what I
said as a teacher would influence him." He was beeindruckt und
beeindruckbar, impressed and impressible, Harms said. Harms and Martin
Ebert, a student who took several classes with Atta, recalled that Atta
seldom jumped into discussions. He would sit and listen, often not saying
a word, then come back a week later with something to offer on the
subject.</TE>
<TE>   Ebert said Atta wasn't much different outside class. He was careful
about what he said, weighing it, never one to get excited. "I don't think
it was possible to have a fight with him," Ebert said.</TE>
<TE>   Harmut Kaiser, another classmate, said it was hard to draw Atta into a
political discussion in class. "He wasn't a guy who acted like he wanted
to change the world--unlike a lot of other students in the group," Kaiser
said.</TE>
<TE>   When students complained about a teacher's idiosyncrasies, Atta would
join in the critique only if he thought a professor hadn't prepared
properly or didn't know the subject. For those teachers who did, Ebert
said, Atta showed a respect bordering on awe.</TE>
<TE>Roommates / POTATOES AND MISS PIGGY</TE>
<TE>   Atta showed somewhat less respect for his roommates. The difficulties
he experienced when he lived in the small cottage with the host family
repeated themselves in Harburg, where he moved into a
university-subsidized apartment building called Centrumshaus. Each
apartment had two bedrooms, a shared bath and a kitchen. Atta lived there
from 1993 to 1998. He shared the flat successively with two men.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Atta so aggravated both that neither could bear to be in
his company. He seldom washed the dishes, they said, even if he had
borrowed theirs to eat from. He almost never cleaned the bathroom. If
asked, he would do it once, then not again for months. He left food
uncovered in the refrigerator for weeks, affecting the taste of
everything else.</TE>
<TE>   The roommates grew to dislike Atta himself even more than the things
he did. The two roommates are very dissimilar. The first is high-strung,
anxious, the son of recent immigrants. The other is laid-back and was
chosen by the house manager in the hope that he could get along with
Atta. Both objected to the same personality trait in Atta: his complete,
almost aggressive insularity.</TE>
<TE>   Just 5-foot-7 and wiry, Atta nonetheless had a heavy, foreboding
presence. He was slightly awkward, stiff and self-contained. The now
famous face, with its angled planes and low, dark brow, was more hangdog
than menacing but seldom welcoming.</TE>
<TE>   The men's shared kitchen was compact, functional, with a maple table
that overlooked the street. It was a bright, sociable space, a place to
sit for coffee or tea in the morning. Atta was often so inwardly focused
he would walk in and out of the room without acknowledging anyone else in
it.</TE>
<TE>   The first roommate tried early on to loosen Atta up. He took Atta to a
showing of Disney's animated film "The Jungle Book." Atta became so upset
at the crowd's unruliness before the film began that he seethed in his
seat, muttering over and over in disgust, "Chaos, chaos."</TE>
<TE>   He didn't speak a word during or after the film, and when they arrived
back at the apartment, he stomped into his bedroom and slammed the door
behind him. Another time, Atta asked the roommate if he had any light
reading material. The roommate gave Atta a book of absurdist, Monty
Python-esque short stories. Atta took it, then returned it the next
morning without a word of thanks or comment.</TE>
<TE>   Atta spent very little money on food and very little time eating. When
he did eat, he complained about the necessity of doing so.</TE>
<TE>   "He was reluctant to any pleasure," the roommate said. "We never
shared food. We shared dishes. Mostly, he messed them up and I cleaned
them."</TE>
<TE>   Atta sometimes prepared a meal by boiling potatoes whole, scraping the
skins away, then smashing them into a mound. He would eat his little
potato mountain, without reheating it, for a week or more, sticking his
fork into it and shoving the whole assembly back into the refrigerator
when he finished a meal.</TE>
<TE>   Each bedroom was furnished with a bed, a desk and shelves. The only
thing Atta added was a slide-projector table that he used as a bookstand.
He kept a Koran on it. Atta prayed five times a day, fasted on holidays
and went to the mosque whenever he could. When he couldn't make it to a
mosque, he prayed in his room, at work, even in the corner of classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes Atta had a beard. Other times he shaved. He almost always
wore the same clothes: cotton slacks and sweaters. He never wore shoes in
the apartment, changing to a pair of blue flip-flops as soon as he came
home.</TE>
<TE>   The second roommate said that by the end of three years, he and Atta
were barely speaking. Atta was so intense that the roommate, out with
friends one time, joked that he hoped Atta wasn't back at the apartment
blowing himself up.</TE>
<TE>   "In the end, I counted the days until Mohamed would leave the flat for
good," he said. Students were allotted up to four years at Centrumshaus
but could extend that to five if they were near graduation. Atta received
the extension, much to the roommate's dismay.</TE>
<TE>   The roommate's girlfriend, a frequent visitor, was even more put off
by Atta. He answered questions from her in curt, clipped tones and would
never look her in the eye, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a good day when Mohamed wasn't home," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The woman was so offended by Atta's behavior toward women that she
conspired to get even with him. She persuaded her boyfriend to hang a
poster of a Degas nude in the bathroom above the toilet. The bathroom was
small; a person couldn't open its door and avoid seeing the nude. Atta
initially didn't respond to the provocation. Finally, three months later,
he asked that it be removed.</TE>
<TE>   Then the girlfriend hung a poster in the kitchen, this one of the
Muppet character Miss Piggy, dressed voluptuously in a negligee. Atta
never said a word.</TE>
<TE>Aleppo / IN MOSQUE, A TRANSFORMATION</TE>
<TE>   Dittmar Machule, the Technical University professor, had taken a
special interest in Atta. Machule is a committed Orientalist who sees his
role at the university as both teacher and promoter of intercultural
communication. When Atta early on chose the subject that would become the
topic of his degree thesis--preservation of ancient cities in the Middle
East--Machule was pleased.</TE>
<TE>   "The other Muslim students, when they come to our world, they had
problems with another cultural context," Machule said. "Either they try
to get more and more a part of the Western culture, or they try to take
something of that and this. . . . With Mohamed, I was somewhat impressed,
I must say, with someone who didn't change, who tried to be as he was
before, to try to learn, but to be who he was.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought if this young man went back to his mother country, he could
be able to work with the fundamentalist person, he could work with strong
religious people because they believe in him."</TE>
<TE>   For years, Machule had supervised a project in northern Syria,
excavating the ruins of an ancient city near Aleppo. In 1994, he invited
Atta to visit the site and consider Aleppo as the place to do fieldwork
for his dissertation. Atta was already planning a summer excursion with
other students to Istanbul, Turkey.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him, 'Mohamed, try to come over to Syria; it's a direct bus
line to Aleppo.' He arrived in August, early morning, after three days on
a bus. He came with his little suitcase, and I felt so sorry for him."</TE>
<TE>   Atta spent time at the excavation site and then went on to Aleppo. In
towns like this throughout the developing world, the collision of old and
new isn't merely theoretical. You can follow old roads, twisting along
lines of elevation and drainage, through old neighborhoods, dense and
jumbled just as they must have been a thousand years before, then
suddenly come upon something new--a concrete apartment building that
looks like it arrived from Mars or Moscow, or a three-story mini-mall
fresh off the boat from Sherman Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   Atta focused on a neighborhood called Almadiyeh Square. It, too, had
suffered modern improvements. In the 1970s, the government dug broad new
roads, improving access to and through the old town. Crews cut part of a
road right through Almadiyeh, tearing down what they needed to, and put
up a small building to sell souvenirs to the tourists the road was
intended to carry.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the only thing I ever saw him get emotional about. He was
very angry at the destruction of our old heritage," said Razan
Abdel-Wahab, a Syrian engineer who still works at the Aleppo
redevelopment project.</TE>
<TE>   When Atta returned to Hamburg, he told Machule that he would make
Aleppo the focus of his thesis. He and another student, Volker Hauth,
made a second research trip to Syria at the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Atta was enlivened by the work, Hauth said.</TE>
<TE>   On a side trip to Damascus, Syria's capital, Hauth went to a mosque
with Atta. Hauth was a devout Protestant and the two of them talked about
religion often, but Hauth had never seen Atta in religious circumstances.
At the mosque, he was surprised to see Atta leading prayers.</TE>
<TE>   Hauth said Atta was self-assured, self-confident and diplomatic. It
was a revelation for Hauth, who knew the dour, introverted Atta from
Hamburg. Here, he was a different person--looser, more talkative,
animated, at times almost playful. It was as if he had been released,
like "a fish in water." He even made tentative advances to a woman he met
in Aleppo. She teased him in return, calling him an Egyptian pharaoh.</TE>
<TE>   Atta seemed to have everything going his way. He had gone to an alien
culture, had found work that engaged and challenged him, and had gained a
measure of acceptance and encouragement he never found at Cairo
University.</TE>
<TE>   As an undergraduate in Cairo, Atta had never talked about his career,
his dreams. Now he spoke of having found a future, about eventually going
back to Egypt--"as an Arab to Arabia," as he described it to a German
colleague, to help build neighborhoods where people could live better
lives.</TE>
<TE>Cairo Again / IDEALISM RUNS INTO REALITY</TE>
<TE>   Much of the political map of Africa has been drawn by foreign hands.
Egypt is the great exception. More than 50 centuries old, it was home to
grand civilizations when, as Gernot Rotter, a prominent Islamic scholar
in Germany, puts it, "middle and northern Europeans were still sitting in
trees."</TE>
<TE>   This is cause for both an abiding pride and an abiding sense of loss.
Both the glory and its passing are nowhere more evident than in an old
section of Cairo known as the Islamic City, a rich concentration of
ancient monuments, modern marketplaces and medieval architecture.</TE>
<TE>   In the summer of 1995, Atta and Hauth won a grant from a German think
tank to go to Cairo to study and analyze redevelopment plans the Egyptian
government had devised for the Islamic City. They were joined on the trip
by a third student, Ralph Bodenstein.</TE>
<TE>   What the three young architects found appalled them. The government
planned to "restore" the area by removing many of the people who lived
there, evicting the onion and garlic sellers, repairing the old buildings
and bringing in troupes of actors to play the real people they would
displace.</TE>
<TE>   Bodenstein described what happened: "We had a very critical discussion
with the municipality. They didn't understand our concerns. They wanted
to do their work, dress people in costumes. They thought it was a good
idea and couldn't imagine why we would object."</TE>
<TE>   It was Atta's first professional contact with the Egyptian bureaucracy
and it distressed him, Bodenstein said.</TE>
<TE>   "Mohamed was very, very critical of the planning administration, the
nepotism. He had begun to make inquiries about getting a job after
school, and he had difficulty finding anything. He did not belong to the
network, where jobs were handed down from one generation to the next, to
political allies. Mohamed was very idealistic, humanistic; he had social
ideals to fulfill."</TE>
<TE>   Atta's complaints about the difficulty of finding a decent job were
not unique. Egypt's ambitious, virtually free system of higher education
pumps out many more graduates than the economy can handle. The more
education you have, the less likely you are to find a job. According to
one 1998 study, those with graduate degrees are 32 times more likely to
be unemployed than illiterate people are.</TE>
<TE>   Bodenstein said Atta's critique of the government grew more expansive
as the study project went on. He said the government's redevelopment
plans would turn the old city into an Islamic Disneyland. Such Western
influences, he said, were the result of the government's eagerness to be
allied with the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The study project lasted five weeks. Hauth and Bodenstein returned to
Hamburg. Atta stayed on in Cairo and spent time with his family, which
had moved from Abdin west across the river to Giza. Atta went back to the
old neighborhood to visit and have Khamees check out his car. While they
talked, the afternoon call to prayer sounded. Atta excused himself to
answer it. It was the first time Khamees had ever seen anyone in Atta's
family go to mosque.</TE>
<TE>   Religion had become a chief focus of Atta's life. With his father's
blessing, and financial assistance, he joined that year's pilgrimage to
Mecca, in Saudi Arabia, an important, often powerful experience in a
Muslim's life. Every believer who is able is supposed to make the trip at
least once. Saudi Arabia restricts the number of pilgrimage visas, so
they are highly prized. To make the pilgrimage at such a young age--Atta
was 27--was a privilege.</TE>
<TE>   When Atta returned to Hamburg, Hauth thought he was, if possible, more
quiet, more inward-looking and more fervent. John Sadiq, a classmate who
worked with Atta at a part-time job, saw the same change. Atta told Hauth
that he eventually wanted to return to Egypt to work as a planner but
despaired of the political situation. "He lived in fear of being
criminalized for his religious beliefs," Hauth said.</TE>
<TE>Al Quds / AT LAST, SOME FRIENDS</TE>
<TE>   Atta never had many German acquaintances, and none who regarded
themselves as close. One reason was Atta's introversion. Another was his
narrow range of interests. He simply wasn't much fun to talk to unless
you wanted to talk about Islam, Cairo or city planning, not subjects
known to foster German friendship.</TE>
<TE>   During his first four years in Hamburg, Atta worked as a draftsman at
a Hamburg urban planning firm, Plankontor. He was an excellent employee,
said Joerg Lewin, one of the firm's partners. But not once did Atta
socialize with other employees. He stayed at his drawing table and
worked, or knelt beside it and prayed. Although the firm invited him on
annual holiday trips, he never went.</TE>
<TE>   He owned almost no books, didn't like food, didn't listen to music
other than religious chants and, as far as anyone knows, the only movie
he ever saw was the one his first Hamburg roommate dragged him to.</TE>
<TE>   When Atta had enrolled at Technical University, there were about 100
"foreign" students in the entire school. More than half of those weren't
really foreigners but ethnic Turks whose families were longtime residents
of Germany. There were only about 40 "real" foreigners and just a handful
of Arabs among them.</TE>
<TE>   Atta wouldn't find many cultural soul mates in Harburg. Where he found
them, instead, was in a seedy neighborhood east of the rail station in
downtown Hamburg, at Al Quds mosque. The biggest, oldest mosques in
Hamburg are Persian. Most others, including those Atta attended in his
early years in Hamburg, are small, neighborhood Turkish congregations. Al
Quds is mainly Arab.</TE>
<TE>   Al Quds is on Steindamm Street, squeezed between a body-building
parlor and a Turkish coffee shop. The street is best known for sex shops
and drug dealing; you can be propositioned within sight of the mosque at
any hour of the day or night.</TE>
<TE>   Al Quds is of medium size; it holds at most 150 people. The walls are
white, with Koranic verses painted on them. The carpets are gray, and the
place has a utilitarian feel to it. It is regarded by German intelligence
agencies as the most radical mosque in Hamburg; in Cairo there might be
1,000 just like it.</TE>
<TE>   It is the sort of place that was enveloped in cheers when news of the
Sept. 11 attacks broke. On the day the Taliban was forced to flee Kabul,
Afghanistan's capital, the men at Al Quds screamed and shouted in anger.
Many there, including the imam, Abu Maziad, blame the United States for
most that is wrong in the world and blame Israel and Jews for much else.</TE>
<TE>   Abu Maziad said Atta began coming to Al Quds in the mid-1990s. He came
often, both for prayers and to talk with friends. Atta's new Arab
friends--men of all ages--called on him frequently at Centrumshaus, his
roommates said. He sometimes invited groups of them to dinner. He made
soup.</TE>
<TE>   Not long after he returned from Mecca, Atta asked two of the men from
the mosque to witness a will he had written.</TE>
<TE>   The will, dated March 6, 1996, subsequently turned up in a suitcase
that was left behind when Atta boarded an American Airlines flight out of
Boston 5 1/2 years later. It's an odd document, a mixture of standard
Islamic text and stern orders on preparations for his burial and who
would be allowed to attend it. In it, Atta dedicates his life and death
to Allah and forbids women to visit his grave. It's difficult to discern
the meaning of the will, but if nothing else it provides an indication of
a young man's growing obsessions and frustrations.</TE>
<TE>Marienstrasse / THE HOUSE OF THE FOLLOWERS</TE>
<TE>   Atta continued to live at the university apartment and worked at
Plankontor until the firm laid him off when business declined in 1996.
Atta hated to lose the job, he told Lewin, but left gracefully. He sent
back money that he thought the firm had overpaid him on his final
paycheck.</TE>
<TE>   Atta finished his course work the next spring. All he had left was to
write his thesis. Instead, he seemed to vanish. He had almost no contact
with the university for a year beginning with the fall of 1997.</TE>
<TE>   He taught a series of seminars put on by the think tank that had
sponsored his research trip to Cairo. The seminars, in 1997 and '98, were
for students undertaking similar projects. Atta wasn't markedly different
as a teacher than he was as a student. He was well-prepared, thorough,
unexciting and serious, said one man who attended two of the four-day
meetings. The man, an Egyptian, said that he was initially excited to
meet another Egyptian so far from home but that Atta, while not hostile,
showed little interest in personal conversation.</TE>
<TE>   The seminars included evening social events. Atta attended none of
them.</TE>
<TE>   The Egyptian student said Atta always seemed preoccupied. There was "a
wall" between him and the students, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Atta took another part-time job, in a warehouse packing computers for
shipment. Unlike the work at Plankontor, this job had no connection to
his city planning career. It did have other connections, however. At
least two of his co-workers are alleged to have been involved in the
planning or execution of the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. investigators think that at some point during this period, Atta
went to Afghanistan for training at a camp run by Al Qaeda, Bin Laden's
terrorist network, but the seminar schedule didn't permit lengthy
absences. His longest absence appears to have been a couple of months at
the beginning of 1998. He told his roommate at Centrumshaus that he was
going on another pilgrimage. He didn't say where.</TE>
<TE>   By autumn 1998, Atta finally exhausted his eligibility for subsidized
student housing. He told his house manager, Manfred Schroeder, that he
would take an apartment with friends. Schroeder was probably the only one
sorry to see him leave.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder is an older man. He has an air of authority. Not all the
students appreciate it. Atta, though, habitually treated older men with
deference. He sometimes invited Schroeder into his apartment for tea and
chocolate candy, Atta's sole indulgence.</TE>
<TE>   But he had been at Centrumshaus five years. He had to move.</TE>
<TE>   He packed his bag and was gone to the Forgotten Island, Wilhelmsburg.
Neighbors said the large group of Arab men stayed at the housing project
there a few months, then disappeared as quickly as they had arrived,
leaving only 11 mattresses behind.</TE>
<TE>   By November, Atta was back in Harburg. He and two other men, Ramzi
Binalshibh and Said Bahaji, rented a freshly remodeled apartment on
Marienstrasse near the university. The apartment had three bedrooms, new
paint and heating and a great many visitors. The tenants paid for
installation of high-speed computer lines.</TE>
<TE>   This was, investigators say, the formation of a new Al Qaeda terrorist
cell and a central planning point for what would turn out to be the Sept.
11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Binalshibh, a Yemeni national, had no apparent means of support and
little interest in school. He attended Hamburg's University of Applied
Sciences for a few months, didn't do well and quit. Bahaji, a German of
Moroccan descent, studied computer engineering at Technical University.
He and Atta petitioned the school for space to establish a Muslim meeting
and prayer room.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. investigators say Binalshibh intended to join the hijack teams in
the United States. Bahaji is thought to have provided key technical and
logistical support to the teams. Both men left Germany shortly before the
attacks, surfacing briefly in Pakistan before disappearing again.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Bahaji came under the scrutiny of German police because of
his association with a middle-aged Syrian businessman, Mamoun Darkazanli,
whom he had met at the Al Quds mosque. Darkazanli had an odd, still-vague
association with a man who had once been a financial officer for Bin
Laden.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing came of the police surveillance because, an investigator said
later, "we only knew them as radical Muslims. That's not a crime. They
might have had contact with followers of Osama bin Laden. This is also
not a crime."</TE>
<TE>   Atta, Binalshibh and Bahaji were good tenants, said Thorsten Albrecht,
their landlord. They paid their rent, often noting on the check that it
was from the Dar el Anser, the House of the Followers.</TE>
<TE>   Albrecht thought that they looked and acted like philosophy students.
They seemed almost dreamy, preoccupied. They dressed in clothes that had
been out of style for a while. He remembers one of them wearing beige
bell-bottom jeans. They also sometimes wore traditional Muslim tunics.
Neighbors said the flat became a gathering spot. As in Wilhelmsburg,
large numbers of Arab men visited routinely. Among them were two other
alleged Sept. 11 hijackers--Marwan Al-Shehhi and Ziad Samir Jarrah.</TE>
<TE>   Atta requested a meeting with Dittmar Machule to renew work on his
thesis. Machule said he asked him: "Where have you been, Mohamed? . . .
There is trouble? Problems in the family?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, in the family, at home," Atta told him. "Please understand, I
don't want to talk about this."</TE>
<TE>   And that was that. Atta began vigorous work on his Aleppo thesis. He
resumed regular meetings with Machule to discuss it and in June 1999, he
turned in a 152-page manuscript. Machule opened it to find an Arabic
inscription and dedication to Allah on the first page.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the work held few surprises. It was a solid, thorough
examination of Aleppo's history, current redevelopment and a proposal to
better integrate the city's past with its future. Machule judged it to be
of high quality intellectually but uneven in its writing. He asked
another professor, Chrilla Wendt, to work with Atta to polish the thesis
before it was formally submitted.</TE>
<TE>   They worked together at regular meetings, side by side at a desk, for
six weeks. Wendt knew of Atta's discomfort around women but said the work
went smoothly until, suddenly, Atta told her that he could no longer
stand to be in such close proximity. By then, the rewriting was nearly
done and in August, Atta formally submitted the thesis. He defended it
before the review committee later in the month and received high marks
and congratulations.</TE>
<TE>   The thesis is a routine piece of urban analysis. The most interesting
thing about it is why Atta chose to finish it at all. It seems clear in
retrospect that Atta was already well down the road to Sept. 11. He,
Al-Shehhi and Jarrah would soon, within weeks of one another, report
their passports stolen, presumably to obtain new, clean documents without
the sort of travel record that might stop them from getting U.S. visas.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the thesis was something Atta set his mind to and did solely
because he wanted to; he was a resolute man. Maybe Machule is right: He
thinks that Atta didn't yet know his fate.</TE>
<TE>   Machule remembers Atta coming by his office one final time. Machule
was busy with another student and Atta, being Atta, didn't barge in. He
didn't even knock. He just stood at the open door, hoping to catch
Machule's eye. Machule gestured to him to wait. Atta stood there for 10
minutes. Then he walked away, and Machule never saw him again.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of 1999, Atta went home to Cairo, degree in hand. His
father greeted him as a conquering hero.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him we should look for a wife for him," Atta's father said. He
always had things arranged. This time, he had a potential bride lined up:
"We went to visit a family, and Mohamed met the daughter and they liked
each other. The woman's parents also liked Mohamed, but their only
condition was that their daughter not leave Cairo. So Mohamed got engaged
to her and then went back to finish his PhD."</TE>
<TE>   There would be, of course, no marriage, no doctorate.</TE>
<TE>   By this time, Atta's parents were estranged. There had been a dispute
over arrangements for their older daughter's marriage, according to
Atta's aunt, Hamida Fateh. Atta's father didn't approve of the groom, who
had been selected by Bouthayna's brothers, Fateh said.</TE>
<TE>   Bouthayna's health had declined. Atta's visit was a time of great joy
for her, Fateh said. Bouthayna took Atta to Kafr el Sheik to show him off
to her relatives.</TE>
<TE>   "It made her very, very happy," Fateh said.</TE>
<TE>   The aunt said Atta told his mother that he didn't want to leave,
didn't want to continue his studies. He wanted to stay in Cairo and take
care of her. He asked if he could.</TE>
<TE>   "His mother insisted he return to his studies," the aunt said.</TE>
<TE>   You need to get a doctorate, she told him. Go to America.</TE>
<TE>America / AN IRRECONCILABLE MEMORY</TE>
<TE>   Most of the north tower of the World Trade Center was air. All big
buildings are, but the trade center was especially so. The center's chief
engineer used to enjoy showing a chart of all the lightest tall buildings
in the world. His were clustered near the top of the chart. He achieved
this extraordinary lightness mainly by clever design that reduced the
amount of steel in the buildings, creating more space.</TE>
<TE>   Because they were so light, the main structural concern was wind. The
trade center was designed to withstand gusts of hurricane force. But the
wind isn't pointed, and even hurricanes don't attack at the speed of a
Boeing 767. Eerily, another of the buildings' engineers had once bragged
that they were designed to withstand the impact of an airliner; people
laughed when they heard that anyone would ever consider such a thing.</TE>
<TE>   After the unlikely weapon with the unlikely pilot rammed it, 24,000
gallons of kerosene ignited inside the north tower with the force of 7
million sticks of dynamite, eventually buckling columns and collapsing
floors, one on top of another, until the entire building collapsed on
itself, followed by the south tower, turning a million tons of glass,
stone, steel, Crane's 24-bond embossed letterhead stationery, janitors'
mops, Italian wool suits, silk ties, Herman Miller chairs and nearly
3,000 people into a seven-story-high stack of rubble.</TE>
<TE>   In November, on a blustery cold day in northern Germany, a young woman
in Hamburg, the former girlfriend and now wife of one of Atta's old
roommates, talked about an image she couldn't get out of her head. She
said when the bombs started falling in Afghanistan, she would sit in
front of her television, staring in disbelief, unable to comprehend that
the bombs were in a very real sense put in motion by her husband's old
roommate.</TE>
<TE>   Watching the explosions, she would try to match them, the war,
everything that has gone on in the world since Sept. 11, to her memory of
the slight young man padding around his student apartment in his shower
shoes. It didn't fit. She would ask herself: All of this because of
Mohamed? It's impossible, she said. Not little Mohamed in his blue
flip-flops.</TE>
<TE>   There is much about Atta we can't now know. But when a person moves
through the world, he leaves a path that can be traced, however faint
parts of it may be. Down in the Atta traces, the image that lingers is of
a man who was far too small to accomplish the huge thing he did. This was
a man too timid even to knock on a professor's open office door. There is
something deeply unsatisfying about this. We want our monsters to be

<HD>Washington Put Riordan Out Front on Health Issue</HD>
<DH>Politics: At suggestion of an HHS aide, Davis' rival takes credit
for winning OK to expand program, even though decision had been made,
advisor says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the Bush administration decided this month to grant Gov. Gray
Davis' request to expand health insurance benefits to the poor, its first
call was not to Davis but to his No. 1 Republican rival, gubernatorial
candidate Richard Riordan.</LD>
<LD>   A top aide to Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy G. Thompson
called Riordan's campaign office a week before the announcement of a
state and federal effort to begin offering health coverage to 300,000
uninsured Californians.</LD>
<LD>   The call tipped off Riordan that the Republican Bush administration
was about to approve California's request to expand the program,
according to a Riordan advisor. And the aide invited the former Los
Angeles mayor to step in at the last minute and take credit for
influencing the decision.</LD>
<TE>   As soon as the extension was announced, that's exactly what Riordan
did.</TE>
<TE>   "I lobbied for that," he said two days before the Democratic
governor's appearance with Thompson. "I had a lot to do with getting it."</TE>
<TE>   The maneuvering behind the scenes signals the emergence of health care
as a potent issue in the gubernatorial campaign. It also highlights the
degree to which political considerations will help shape the public
agenda this year.</TE>
<TE>   It addition, it reflects the sense in the Riordan and Davis camps that
they will be the candidates to compete in November for the governorship.
Davis faces no serious opposition in the Democratic primary, but to reach
the November election, Riordan must defeat Secretary of State Bill Jones
and businessman Bill Simon Jr. on March 5. Still, Riordan and Davis
already have begun exchanging barbs in television ads.</TE>
<TE>   With an estimated 7 million Californians uninsured--and countless
others dissatisfied with their medical coverage--Davis and Riordan have
seized on health care to score points with voters.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the governor proposed new rules to set minimum nurse
staffing levels in hospitals. On Wednesday, he pledged to spend $60
million to educate nurses. On Friday, he announced public forums in
Fresno, Sacramento, Oakland and Manhattan Beach to explore options to
expand health coverage. In the first television ad of his reelection
campaign, he touts his record on health care.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's one of the strongest aspects of his record, and one
we'll have no hesitation in communicating," said Davis pollster Paul
Maslin. "It's an important part of his going to the voters and saying,
'This is why you should reelect me.' "</TE>
<TE>   It's especially appealing, Maslin said, to women and Latinos. Both
groups have been strong Democratic Party constituencies and key
components of the governor's political base. They also are the source of
fierce competition between Davis and Riordan.</TE>
<TE>Health Care Is a Riordan Favorite</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Davis' concern over Riordan's appeals to female voters was
underscored by his release of a TV spot saying the former Los Angeles
mayor opposed "a woman's right to choose." Riordan supports abortion
rights, but the ad cited--among other things--his donations to
anti-abortion candidates.</TE>
<TE>   For Riordan, health care has been a favorite issue on the stump. He
often describes California's system as "in total crisis." Although he has
not proposed any remedies, he describes health care as a "God-given
right." It's a position that has drawn criticism from GOP rival Jones.</TE>
<TE>   "Dick, who do you propose will pick up the tab for the . . . cost of
extending health care coverage to the uninsured?" Jones asked Friday in a
speech to Latino business leaders in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   At the center of campaign squabbles over health care in recent days is
the federal program that insures children of the working poor. Launched
during President Clinton's administration, it covers families that earn
too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to afford private health
insurance. Nationwide, it insures more than 3 million children. In the
2000 presidential campaign, Vice President Al Gore often called it a key
accomplishment.</TE>
<TE>   For Davis too, the program is a showcase issue. In his first TV spot,
he takes credit for expanding it to 500,000 children. The program
requires states to match the federal spending. California's program,
known as Healthy Families, began under the governor's Republican
predecessor, Pete Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   In December 2000, Davis asked the federal government for permission to
expand Healthy Families to cover 300,000 parents, not just children.</TE>
<TE>   But since then, the state has plunged into a budget crisis, creating a
political mess for Davis in the midst of his reelection campaign. Facing
a shortfall of more than $12 billion, Davis turned to Healthy Families to
help bridge the gap. To save $200 million, he proposed postponing the
program's expansion to parents until July 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The move drew sharp rebukes from Riordan and health care advocates,
who accused the governor of neglecting the needs of the poor. It also
gave the Bush administration an opportunity to intensify Davis' political
discomfort by approving his application for the expansion even as he was
trying to back away from it.</TE>
<TE>   With some Democrats on his left calling for a tax increase and
Republicans on his right accusing him of reckless spending, Davis would
be forced to scramble for the $200 million.</TE>
<TE>   In California, the first word of Thompson's imminent approval of a
waiver to offer Healthy Families coverage to parents came from
Christopher J. McCabe, chief liaison to state and local governments at
the Department of Health and Human Services.</TE>
<TE>   But instead of telling the Davis administration, McCabe, a former
Maryland state senator, alerted the Riordan campaign, according to an
advisor to the GOP candidate. The Riordan advisor, who declined to be
named, said McCabe suggested: "If we felt we wanted to rip off a letter
indicating that we wanted to encourage the government to cause the waiver
to occur, that would be fine."</TE>
<TE>   In his Jan. 18 letter, Riordan told Thompson the waiver was
"particularly important to California as the state currently faces a
serious and troublesome budget deficit."</TE>
<TE>   "I look forward to what I hope will be your prompt and favorable
response to our appeal," Riordan wrote.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 19, the Riordan campaign e-mailed the letter to reporters.
Four days later, the Davis administration learned from the news media
that Thompson was going to approve the expansion, said Diana M. Bonta,
state health services director.</TE>
<TE>Riordan Says Bush Urged Him to Run</TE>
<TE>   McCabe declined to say why the Bush administration gave advance notice
to the Riordan campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not at liberty to say," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson, a former governor of Wisconsin, said he was unaware that
McCabe had made the call.</TE>
<TE>   "If he did, he did it on his own," Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   White House political operatives say Bush is neutral in the GOP
primary for governor, but Riordan has said the president encouraged him
last year to run. At a campaign stop Wednesday in Salinas, Riordan
wondered whether the Bush administration was giving him credit for the
Healthy Families waiver.</TE>
<TE>   "Did they mention me and my lobbying?" he asked. "I'm sure they did. I
talked to Tommy Thompson and his chief of staff."</TE>
<TE>   An aide to the governor said the timing of the federal approval
appeared to be "a squeeze play" to embarrass the governor after he
postponed the program. With Thompson standing next to him Friday at a
health clinic in heavily Latino East Los Angeles, Davis pledged Friday to
start "looking for the money immediately."</TE>
<TE>   "This is not bad news; this is good news," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson denied political motives in handling California's request.</TE>
<TE>   "I assure you it's not politics, because I happen to like your
governor," Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   Since taking office in 1999, Davis has signed a patients' "bill of
rights" law. It set up a new agency to oversee health maintenance
organizations and some large medical groups and created a limited right
to sue HMOs.</TE>
<TE>   But Davis' proposed budget cuts--notably reductions in emergency
medical care money and the Healthy Families postponement--have angered
health care advocates. Physicians' groups and others also have objected
to some Davis policies.</TE>
<TE>   "He has somewhat reluctantly supported the Healthy Families expansion,
which is a huge step, and he finished the job that Wilson started in
terms of managed care reform," said Helen Schauffler, director of the
Center for Health and Public Policy at UC Berkeley. "But beyond that,
health has not been a priority."</TE>

<DL>PAULDING, Miss.
</DL>
<LD>"I need to know who I am, where I come from."</LD>
<LD>   It was Memorial Day 1997, and Edward Lee was sitting on a worn sofa in
a worn house in Jackson. He was talking to an old man with a raspy drawl
and a pacemaker--his grandfather, Edgar Lee.</LD>
<LD>   They hadn't seen each other in three years. Edward Lee had been living
in California and Texas and had lost touch with most of his relatives.
They had left Mississippi long ago, scattered north and west.</LD>
<TE>   He was 35 now, separated from his wife. He had no job, no kids, no
house, no roots.</TE>
<TE>   "Please, Grandpa, tell me who I am."</TE>
<TE>   Edgar Lee gave his grandson a long, hard look. Then his eyes fluttered
shut and memories flooded back. . . .</TE>
<TE>   Spanish moss . . . an auburn horse . . . a cabin in flames. . . .</TE>
<TE>   "We had some land," the old man said, "and they discovered oil on it."</TE>
<TE>   Edgar Lee pulled out a creased photograph of a slender man in ragged
overalls sitting in front of a cabin with a crooked front porch.</TE>
<TE>   "That's your great-great-grandaddy, Sie Lee," Edgar Lee said. "That's
the old home place."</TE>
<TE>   And then, as his grandson remembered it later, Edgar Lee began a tale
of klansmen and oilmen, of midnight fires and murder.</TE>
<TE>   When he finished his story, Edgar Lee stood up.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that you know," he told his grandson, "do something about this."</TE>
<TE>   What happened to the Lee family has happened to others. The Associated
Press, in a series of stories published in December, reported a pattern
in which black Americans were cheated out of their family land or driven
from it through intimidation, violence, even murder. The AP documented
107 such land-takings and located thousands of additional cases that have
yet to be investigated.</TE>
<TE>   Behind every land-taking is a human story. This is one of them.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the summer of 1920, Edgar Lee's father, Anderson, slept in
the woods with a shotgun.</TE>
<TE>   It was a routine Edgar Lee could recount in detail 80 years later: At
nightfall, his father would tuck in his four sons, whisper good night to
Edgar's mother, Melvina, and his grandfather, Sie Lee, then slip out the
back door and into the buzzing blackness.</TE>
<TE>   The seven of them lived in a three-room log cabin surrounded by pine
forests south of Paulding. The land had been in the family since the
early 1890s, when Sie Lee arrived from Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   The earth was rocky, but the deacon and his wife earned a living by
cutting timber and raising pigs, chickens and cows.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in the fall of 1908, geologists from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture stumbled onto something that would change their destiny.</TE>
<TE>   Beneath eastern Jasper County was a basin of light crude. The oil was
deep--so deep that the oilmen couldn't reach it. Not yet.</TE>
<TE>   After word of the discovery seeped out, trouble started.</TE>
<TE>   Black farmers in the area found it harder than usual to get loans,
Edgar Lee remembered. They were paid less than ever for their crops and
could no longer get credit at supply stores. Some lost their farms.</TE>
<TE>   Other pressure was less subtle.</TE>
<TE>   What Edgar Lee saw and heard as a 10-year-old boy one May night in
1920 was forever trapped in his memory: Galloping horses, torches, hooded
men at the cabin door, a shout.</TE>
<TE>   "Where's Anderson?"</TE>
<TE>   "He's gone," Anderson's wife replied. "Out in the woods."</TE>
<TE>   The klansmen laughed.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be back."</TE>
<TE>   They returned each week, Edgar said.</TE>
<TE>   So Anderson Lee would sleep in the woods, returning at sunrise. His
wife would check him for lice and ticks before breakfast. A few times, he
returned to find his children staring at a cross ablaze in the yard.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the family left their land and fled to nearby Moss Hill. One
night, their cabin there went up in flames. They built a third cabin in
the forest a few miles south of Paulding. They didn't dare return to
their farm.</TE>
<TE>   The Ku Klux Klan was never far away. Edgar Lee's aunt, a housemaid,
sometimes found herself washing and pressing their robes and hoods.</TE>
<TE>   In the late summer of 1924, the klan came calling again.</TE>
<TE>   "We was sleeping," Edgar Lee recalled. "I heard my momma screaming.
The house--it was falling in on us. Then I remember standing outside,
watching the fire eat it up."</TE>
<TE>   This time, the family scattered.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson Lee ran all the way to the Delta, leaving behind his wife and
children, who moved to a white landowner's farm. Sie Lee moved to another
part of Jasper County and worked as a sharecropper until his death in
1951.</TE>
<TE>   In 1930, Edgar Lee married and moved to Laurel. He never saw his
father again. In 1931, Anderson Lee's body was found in a barn on a Delta
plantation, a bullet in his chest.</TE>
<TE>   By then, the Lee property had fallen into other hands.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Paulding had long been the Jasper County seat. In 1906, however, a
second seat was established in Bay Springs, in the western, predominantly
white, half of the county. That year, land records for western Jasper
were transferred to Bay Springs.</TE>
<TE>   So when 15 whites set fire to the Paulding courthouse on Sept. 10,
1932, only the records for the mostly black section burned.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Jasper County News, the door to the records vault
had, as always, been locked the night before. The next morning, the
newspaper said, it was wide open.</TE>
<TE>   Property records for thousands of acres of farms and timberland--some
of it with oil lying deep beneath--were mostly ashes.</TE>
<TE>   All of a sudden, there were no documents to prove who owned what land.</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest landowners was Masonite Corp, a wood-products
company founded in 1925 in neighboring Jones County. Five years after the
fire, William H. Mason, company vice president, asked the court to clear
its title to 9,581 acres in Jasper County.</TE>
<TE>   In court papers, the company said it had "exhausted every potential
source," but had found no rival claimants to the land. Less than a month
later, on Jan. 11, 1938, the Chancery Court declared Masonite the "real
owner" of the land.</TE>
<TE>   Sixty years later, Edward Lee entered the Paulding courthouse to
search for his family's lost land. He left defeated. The two-hour drive
back to Jackson felt like a 10-hour haul.</TE>
<TE>   "I got bad news," he told his grandfather. "That courthouse burned in
1932. There probably aren't any records of Sie Lee owning any land."</TE>
<TE>   "Who says so?"</TE>
<TE>   "The court clerk."</TE>
<TE>   "Go back there, son, and look for yourself."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Edward Lee spent days inside the musty courthouse vault. In the back
were some charred books--a handful of volumes that had survived the fire.
In one, he spotted something that made his heart leap.</TE>
<TE>   It was a deed of trust, dated March 3, 1910. Sie Lee, listed as the
owner of a 180-acre tract, was putting it up as collateral for a $350
loan. An attached stub, dated April 1, 1913, said he had repaid the debt
in full. It was signed by the lenders, two local white businessmen.</TE>
<TE>   With property coordinates from the document, Lee tracked the land as
it was leased, bought and sold. He discovered two paper trails: One for a
40-acre tract, the other for 140 acres.</TE>
<TE>   Edward Lee started by tracking the 40-acre parcel. He discovered that
it had been claimed by J.H. Abney, one of the white lenders, just three
months after the klan ran off the Lees.</TE>
<TE>   According to records that survived the fire, Abney used the 40 acres
as collateral in December 1924 for a $1,500 loan from the Bank of
Pachuta, a local branch of a federal land bank run by the U.S. Department
of Agriculture. It is not clear what gave Abney a right to the land, and
records indicate he never repaid the loan.</TE>
<TE>   Records show that Abney did not pay taxes on the land in the early
1930s. They were paid, instead, by his brother-in-law, a state chancery
court judge named Stone Deavours.</TE>
<TE>   The Bank of Pachuta foreclosed on Abney and conveyed the land to
another man who sold it to Masonite on Aug. 5, 1937. The 40 acres were
among the 9,581 to which Masonite received clear title when it petitioned
the court four months later.</TE>
<TE>   Masonite, which became a subsidiary of International Paper Corp. in
1988, still has title. Jenny Boardman, an International Paper
spokeswoman, said the company did not know the history of the land but
was concerned when told about it.</TE>
<TE>   Tracking the other 140 acres was trickier. There were no surviving
records of transactions involving the land between 1913, when Sie Lee
paid off his loan, and 1936, when records suddenly show the Bank of
Pachuta as owner.</TE>
<TE>   The bank's receiver "quit-claimed" the property--sold it without a
guarantee of title--to a member of his family, on June 23, 1936.</TE>
<TE>   Here, the trail turned muddy.</TE>
<TE>   One index said that on March 11, 1941, the state of Mississippi
conveyed the land to a businessman. The sale was never signed or
notarized, and was not filed until Oct. 13, 1972.</TE>
<TE>   How had the state acquired title? Edward Lee asked the Mississippi
public lands division. The agency replied in a 1998 letter that the state
had acquired the land from Abney for taxes on Sept. 20, 1937.</TE>
<TE>   But how could this be if, as the courthouse records had shown, the
bank owned it in 1936 and quit-claimed it that year to J. N. Horne? The
Associated Press checked county deed records, land indexes and court
proceedings and found no evidence that Horne sold the land to Abney or
anyone else. There were no records showing that Abney owned the property
in 1937.</TE>
<TE>   Edward Lee kept tracking the 140 acres. After several sales, the land
was acquired in 1963 by the Hall Bros. Lumber Co., a Masonite subsidiary,
which still owns it today.</TE>
<TE>   "We had some land . . . ," Edgar Lee had said, and now his grandson
had accounted for 180 acres. But Edward Lee was not through.</TE>
<TE>   In his search, he had stumbled across a third paper trail.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Court records showed the Lee family had lost a lawsuit over acreage
that bordered Sie Lee's 180-acre farm.</TE>
<TE>   In 1951, the year Sie Lee died, Willie B. Vaughn, a black man, claimed
that his family was heir to 120 acres that had been owned by his
grandparents, Giles and Clara Vaughn.</TE>
<TE>   The Lee family contended some of it was theirs. After Giles Vaughn
died in 1900, Clara married her divorced neighbor, Sie Lee. He eventually
survived Clara, and as spouse, was entitled to part of her 120-acre
estate--a 20% interest--the Lees argued.</TE>
<TE>   The judge who presided over the 1951 case was Jack Deavours, whose
father, Stone Deavours, had once paid taxes on some of Sie Lee's lost
land. The judge ignored the marriage issue and awarded the entire
120-acre tract to the Vaughns on grounds that they had been living on it
for 50 years. Willie Vaughn later sold some of the land for an
unspecified amount.</TE>
<TE>   Edward Lee copied these documents and returned to Jackson to show them
to his grandfather. Edgar Lee chuckled. In 1972, the old man recalled,
Getty Oil Co. paid each member of the Lee family $100 to sign an oil
lease on the disputed land. (The company apparently was protecting itself
from the possibility of the Lees' reviving their claim to the property.)
The leases remain on file at the Paulding courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   By the 1960s, technological advances made it possible to extract the
oil that lay deep beneath Jasper County, a region that has since yielded
more than 12 million barrels of oil, according to state records.</TE>
<TE>   The old Vaughn and Lee properties, by the 1960s almost entirely in the
hands of white families and Masonite, produced at least 850,000 barrels,
state oil and gas board records show.</TE>
<TE>   Edward Lee now knew his family's estate once totaled 204.5 acres. He
brought copies of the records to his grandfather in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Edgar Lee had never learned to read. Seeing the stack of papers,
however, the old man smiled. He was proud of his grandson, though he had
no illusions.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe we own the land," he said. "But I don't never believe
they'll ever pay us back for it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 11, 2000, Edgar Lee died of heart failure at 89.</TE>
<TE>   Edward Lee, now 40, operates a floor-cleaning business and lives in
Memphis with his girlfriend and their 10-month-old daughter. He says he
contacted 14 lawyers and each refused his request for help.</TE>
<TE>   The AP verified all the tax, court, census and corporate documents Lee
had collected.</TE>
<TE>   For three decades, Masonite and others have received royalties for oil
from the former Lee and Vaughn property.</TE>
<TE>   According to records at the Mississippi State Oil and Gas Board, the
Lees have received nothing.</TE>

<HD>Adoptions Snared in Bitter Tug of War</HD>
<DH>Asia: A Hong Kong family struggled for nearly 15 years to win legal
residency for their daughter, but many aren't even that fortunate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELEN LUK</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>HONG KONG
</DL>
<LD>When Man Yuet-kwai first held the month-old baby in her arms in a
desolate farm hut, she wasn't thinking of high policy or Hong Kong's
relationship with the Chinese motherland.</LD>
<LD>   All she knew was, she had at last found a child to adopt.</LD>
<LD>   Her case was to set off a bureaucratic battle that would rage for 14
years, reach Hong Kong's highest court, and touch off a groundswell of
public emotion that overrode the letter of the law to produce a happy
ending for one family.</LD>
<TE>   It would also reveal some of the limits to Hong Kong's absorption into
the Chinese mainstream nearly five years after the former British colony
returned to Chinese sovereignty.</TE>
<TE>   But none of that mattered to Man and her husband, Tam Ching-luk, as
they made the 100-mile journey by train, bus and pedicab to the village
of Qingwen in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong.</TE>
<TE>   They had heard from a friend that a baby was available for adoption
from a poor farming family. When the couple stood in the hut on a chilly
December day in 1986, and Man held the squalling baby in her arms, the
child instantly calmed down, stuck out her tongue and smiled at Man. The
couple knew they had found what they wanted.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't take her, we'll throw her away," the mother said when
Man asked for time to start the necessary adoption procedures. "She's a
nuisance. She cries whenever it's dark. She has to stay in the sun. Our
family doesn't like her."</TE>
<TE>   She. Her. A girl. In a country overflowing with people, there are
children in abundance available for adoption, especially female ones.
Still, the biological parents were happy their child had found a home.</TE>
<TE>   The next stop was the justice bureau in Heshan county, where Man and
Tam were assured they would have no problem adopting the child. They
decided to name her Nga-yin, which means "natural elegance."</TE>
<TE>   Then they returned to Hong Kong to do the paperwork. Two months later,
they came back to China and the girl's parents officially gave her up.
Man offered them a gift of money, sealed in a customary red packet. They
turned it down.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no need," was the reply. "It's already great that you can
raise her for us."</TE>
<TE>   So far, so good. But the nightmare was about to begin.</TE>
<TE>   Man and Tam have been married for more than 30 years. She is 47, he is
23 years her senior. Though she smiles often and her youthful voice lilts
with optimism, the fine lines across her face betray the fatigue of her
struggle.</TE>
<TE>   Tam is a taciturn man who speaks with a slight slur due to a stroke.
Born in Guangzhou, formerly known as Canton, he fled to Hong Kong half a
century ago as China was falling to communist rule. He worked at
factories making silk flowers and built advertising signboards, and
retired seven years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Back in 1987, when the couple adopted the baby, Hong Kong was still
British, and tight border controls were in place. They could not bring
Nga-yin into the colony. So they did the next best thing: They moved her
into a tiny apartment in Shenzhen, the nearest Chinese city to Hong Kong,
and hired a mainland woman to look after her. They would visit their
child on weekends.</TE>
<TE>   A mainland justice official told them Nga-yin could move to Hong Kong
in a year or two. But two years passed and they heard nothing.</TE>
<TE>   The visits came to an abrupt end when Nga-yin was 3, old enough to
speak, and begged her mother not to leave.</TE>
<TE>   "All moms pick up their children after school," she wailed. "Why am I
the only one left out?"</TE>
<TE>   Man phoned her husband in Hong Kong. Stay, he said. She needs you. It
was a tough decision. Man had a small garment factory in Hong Kong. She
sold it and moved in with her daughter in Shenzhen.</TE>
<TE>   Six years passed. Nga-yin was 9 now, a bright student, musically
gifted. She played electronic piano and a lute-like Chinese instrument
called the pipa. But she was caught in a loop of red tape. Chinese
officials said the problem was in Hong Kong, and Hong Kong said it was in
China. Man considered smuggling Nga-yin to Hong Kong. She even lined up
two fake Venezuelan passports. But she was too afraid to use them.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, a visa came through. But it was good for only three months.
Once it expired, new problems arose. As an illegal resident, Nga-yin
couldn't attend school. So Man hired private tutors. Meanwhile she
continued to travel to China, seeking a solution.</TE>
<TE>   One night she came home to discover that her husband had suffered a
stroke and was paralyzed on the right side, unable to move or speak. The
family moved in with Tam's brother and rented out their own flat. Man
would spend the day nursing her husband and rearing their daughter.</TE>
<TE>   At night, when everyone else was asleep, she would write letters by
the dim light of a lamp to the then-British governor, Chris Patten, to
the immigration director, legislators, Chinese officials. She would
deliver the letters to their offices personally, not trusting the mail.
She pleaded for a humanitarian gesture, but all she got was a six-month
extension of Nga-yin's visa.</TE>
<TE>   So 1997 arrived. Hong Kong was about to return to Chinese rule, and
Nga-yin was turning 11. Tam slowly recovered from his stroke, but could
not work. The family lived on savings until Man got hired as a
kindergarten caretaker.</TE>
<TE>   The best news for Nga-yin was that she got permission to attend
school. She did so well that she skipped a grade.</TE>
<TE>'One Country, Two Systems'</TE>
<TE>   China took over Hong Kong, but the border remained in place, and with
it the tight immigration laws. Neither the communist government in
Beijing nor Hong Kong's semiautonomous administration wanted to see the
wealthy city impoverished by a tidal wave of job-seekers.</TE>
<TE>   It is called "one country, two systems," whereby China is the
sovereign but Hong Kong is run separately by its own administration. That
means even children adopted by Hong Kong parents, or the children of
mainland parents who move to Hong Kong, have to wait in the immigration
line, often for years.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, the Tams went to court and won. But the government got the
ruling reversed on appeal. Eventually, the case reached the top--Hong
Kong's Court of Final Appeal.</TE>
<TE>   As the five red-robed justices filed into the court's chamber on an
overcast Friday last July to give a final verdict, Man was nearly sick
with anxiety. So was 14-year-old Nga-yin.</TE>
<TE>   Hong Kong has kept its English common-law system, so Chief Justice
Andrew Li delivered the ruling in English. The Tams don't speak English,
and had to wait for their lawyers to give them the news. It wasn't good.</TE>
<TE>   Man emerged from the courthouse wailing hysterically to a throng of
reporters and cameras.</TE>
<TE>   "The Hong Kong government has cheated me," she yelled. "If they try to
separate me from my daughter, I won't let them."</TE>
<TE>   The family drama struck a chord. The story dominated TV screens and
front pages. Petitions went out, including one from the school Nga-yin
had attended, signed by the principal and hundreds of classmates. The
news coverage continued. The government said it would reconsider the case
on humanitarian grounds.</TE>
<TE>   And in October, a month short of her 15th birthday, Nga-yin's
residency permit came through. But more than 20 other families in similar
circumstances have not won a reprieve, and in recent days a court ruling
has dealt another setback to almost 5,000 mainland migrants seeking
permanent residency here, ruling that they have no right to stay.</TE>
<TE>Government's Power Cause for Concern</TE>
<TE>   One mother, May Mak, adopted her 5-year-old daughter, Melody, from an
orphanage in Heshan when she was less than a month old, and is terrified
that the girl may be expelled.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so unfair. Adopted children are no different from one's natural
children," Mak said.</TE>
<TE>   Some are disturbed that the government has the power to make
exceptions to its own rules.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very troubling," said political analyst Michael DeGolyer of
Baptist University in Hong Kong. "I don't like discretionary powers in
the hand of unelected bureaucrats. If you're going to have fairness and
equity, you have to have rules that apply to all."</TE>
<TE>   The unwanted farmer's daughter is a lively teenager now, with a
computer in her room, stuffed toys and cheerful, flowery curtains. And
her parents feel the struggle has been worth it.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever my daughter smiles at me, I think she's worth all the pain
and hardship," says Man. "She's brought us so much laughter and
happiness."</TE>

<HD>Son Refuses to Quit on Justice</HD>
<DH>Crime: Brian Godkin was 8 when his father was shot to death. The
boy grew up to be a marshal. Then he went looking for the killer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY McSHANE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>More than two decades ago, on the night of his father's murder,
Brian Godkin was just 8 years old.</LD>
<LD>   His 10-year-old sister, Christine, sat watching television as their
dad prepared for a shift pouring drinks at his Queens tavern. Richard
Godkin hugged his oldest daughter, kissed her good night, and walked out
his front door for the last time.</LD>
<LD>   By the early morning hours of April 11, 1981, his neighborhood
bar--opened six months earlier--was packed. Among the revelers,
authorities say, was a mob wannabe celebrating his 24th birthday.</LD>
<TE>   The party ended with Godkin and his co-owner dead on the barroom
floor. Police identified a suspect named Frank Riccardi, the son of a
reputed Gambino family bookie.</TE>
<TE>   Riccardi walked out of the bar and into the wind. Two other suspects
were eventually collared, but Riccardi became the invisible man.</TE>
<TE>   The Godkin boy grew into a man--a 6-foot-6 Navy veteran intent on
becoming a federal marshal. In August 2001, he achieved his goal and
joined the Las Vegas office.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Godkin was 28. And Frank Riccardi was still on the lam.</TE>
<TE>   The murder case was in the hands of a New York City cold-case
detective, a dogged investigator determined to find Riccardi. During four
years on the case, the detective had become friendly with young Godkin.</TE>
<TE>   One week into his new job, acting on a tip from the detective, Godkin
typed a name into a federal database.</TE>
<TE>   Another name popped up on the screen. It took 20 years, but Brian
Godkin had tracked down the man accused of killing his father.</TE>
<TE>   In April 1981, the nation was recovering from an assassination attempt
on President Reagan. Nobody wanted their MTV; it didn't exist.
"Celebration," the party anthem by Kool and the Gang, blared from
jukeboxes around the city.</TE>
<TE>   It was no different at the Shamrock Bar, a popular joint owned by
Godkin and partner John D'Agnese.</TE>
<TE>   Godkin, father of four and married for more than a decade, was working
two jobs: days at the Queens Boys Club, a local youth organization,
nights at the bar. "A little extra money to make life work," his widow,
Catherine Godkin, says now.</TE>
<TE>   About 2 a.m. on April 11, Frank Riccardi's birthday celebration was in
full bore--until a drink was accidentally spilled on his date. Court
papers detailed an incident that escalated from innocuous to incendiary.</TE>
<TE>   An out-of-control Riccardi was tossed from the bar. "I will be back!"
he screamed. Twenty minutes later, accompanied by two gun-toting friends,
Riccardi returned.</TE>
<TE>   D'Agnese was slammed against a pinball machine, then shot point-blank
in the face. His girlfriend, Linda Gotti--the niece of local Mafioso John
Gotti--stared in disbelief with two dozen other patrons. Godkin rushed to
his partner's aid, and was mortally wounded too.</TE>
<TE>   A suspect was quickly arrested, but his case was dismissed after Linda
Gotti inexplicably recanted her identification.</TE>
<TE>   The hunt for a second suspect, Bartolomeo "Pepe" Vernace, produced
nothing. Riccardi disappeared too; he was indicted in absentia.</TE>
<TE>   As the years passed, Catherine Godkin made her personal peace: "I've
been past it a long time."</TE>
<TE>   Brian Godkin wasn't past it. After finishing a stint in the Navy, he
became a federal corrections officer, angling for that job as a U.S.
marshal.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, Tom Mansfield was an NYPD cold-case detective investigating
long-unsolved homicides.</TE>
<TE>   When the 16-year-old Godkin murder arrived at his desk, one thing
jumped out: "The amount of people in the bar." He re-interviewed
witnesses and delved into the life of Frank Riccardi, known as "Frankie
the Geech."</TE>
<TE>   Riccardi's father was reputed Gambino family loan shark Frank "Cheech"
Riccardi, who had died in 1979, reportedly leaving behind a hefty
inheritance for his widow and son. Mansfield heard rumors that "Cheech"
was killed by the mob for messing with Gotti's niece.</TE>
<TE>   Mansfield's gut told him young Riccardi was alive and living with his
mother.</TE>
<TE>   "I always had this feeling that he was in Florida," the veteran
detective said. "Where do retired mobsters go? Florida or Arizona. And my
theory was if you find the mom, you're gonna find him."</TE>
<TE>   Mansfield soon developed information about the third suspect in the
bar shooting. In November 1998, 17 years after the slaying, he arrested a
very surprised Vernace.</TE>
<TE>   Mansfield was pleased. But his hunt for Frank Riccardi continued.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, in Boca Raton, Fla., Anthony Frank Alonzo was living in a
posh condominium with his elderly mother. He drove a silver 1999 Mercedes
and worked as a circulation manager for the Sun-Sentinel newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors described him as a quiet man who offered little more than a
casual wave hello.</TE>
<TE>   Alonzo knew nothing about Tom Mansfield, who had spent the last four
years viewing mug shots and reviewing computer databases in his search.</TE>
<TE>   The cop clung to his mother-and-son hunch--even after striking out in
searches of the name Riccardi and the mother's maiden name, Lena
Santilli.</TE>
<TE>   In mid-August of last year, Brian Godkin--in New York for his nephew's
christening--called Mansfield with an offer. Godkin had just started with
the federal marshals service; could he run any names through its
database?</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Look, one thing you could try and do is narrow it down,' "
Mansfield recounted. "Here's the mom's name. Try Florida. You might get
lucky."</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, Godkin called back from Las Vegas. A sophisticated
search engine had kicked back a name that matched phonetically, Lena
Santille. She lived in Boca Raton, and her birth date made her a likely
match for Riccardi's mother.</TE>
<TE>   Mansfield was intrigued. A check of the Florida address showed Anthony
Frank Alonzo, about the same age as Riccardi, was living with Mrs.
Santille.</TE>
<TE>   Mansfield showed a driver's license picture of Alonzo to one of
Riccardi's high school classmates. No question, the classmate said,
Alonzo was Frank Riccardi.</TE>
<TE>   The detective arrived in Boca Raton on Aug. 20, heading to the Alonzo
residence that evening. Mansfield hit the buzzer for apartment 302; the
reply came in a thick New York accent:</TE>
<TE>   "Whaddaya want?"</TE>
<TE>   Alonzo was lured downstairs with a phony report of a fender-bender
involving his Mercedes. When he arrived, wearing a silk pajama top,
Mansfield eagerly greeted him.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to ask you a very important question," the detective recalled
saying. "What's your real name?'</TE>
<TE>   "And he goes, 'Frank. Frank Riccardi.' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Catherine Godkin was with her daughters when she received word of
Riccardi's arrest at 8 a.m. on Aug. 21. It was her husband's 56th
birthday, and they were headed to put flowers on his grave.</TE>
<TE>   On the phone, Mansfield told her, "We arrested him, and it was because
of Brian."</TE>
<TE>   After telling her daughters, Catherine Godkin dialed Las Vegas and
delivered the news to her son.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very happy day," she said. "Brian has great faith in the
justice system."</TE>
<TE>   Justice in the case remains delayed. Vernace has yet to go on trial;
Frank Riccardi finally returned to New York in October and was ordered
held without bail pending trial.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Godkin, now a six-month veteran of the marshals office, was
reticent about his work. "I'm not interested in talking about it," he
said from Las Vegas. "I just want to take some time to think about the
whole thing."</TE>
<TE>   Catherine Godkin wasn't surprised by her son's silence. She never knew
that her son had been thinking about Riccardi for the last two decades.</TE>
<TE>   "These are your kids. You don't think they realize what's going on,"
she said. "And here you are, 20 years later, and they tell you.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know."</TE>

classified as POWs, the State Dept. wants Bush to afford them the same
treatment as under Geneva accords.</DH>

</DL>
<LD>Calling for a change in White House policy, Secretary of State
Colin L. Powell has asked President Bush to ensure that international
rules of war govern the treatment of 460 suspected Taliban and Al Qaeda
fighters who have been captured in Afghanistan and are in U.S. custody,
administration officials said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The State Department urged the president to give the 158 detainees at
the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and 302 others under guard in
Afghanistan the protections and treatment guaranteed under the Geneva
Conventions, though not necessarily grant them the legal status of
prisoners of war, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The administration has insisted that the men in custody are "unlawful
combatants" who do not qualify for the legal rights and privileges
required under the Geneva accords.</LD>
<TE>   That determination has drawn criticism from several European allies,
the International Committee of the Red Cross and human rights groups. The
protests escalated sharply last week after the Pentagon released a
photograph of bound and shackled prisoners at Guantanamo, their heads and
eyes covered, kneeling before U.S. soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   The Geneva Conventions, the critics argue, provide that military
captives are presumed to be prisoners of war until a court determines
otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   The White House has opposed conferring such formal status on the
prisoners, in part because of U.S. efforts to interrogate them about
Osama bin Laden and his global Al Qaeda terrorist network could be
severely curtailed. Under the Geneva Conventions, POWs are required to
provide only name, rank and serial number.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials on Saturday strongly denied that Powell's
request to redefine the prisoners' status was an open challenge to Bush.
They instead portrayed it as a creative attempt to solve a contentious
situation that has drawn what they consider undue attention.</TE>
<TE>   The apparent rift was a rare departure for the Bush administration,
which has been successful at keeping a united front, not just since the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon
unified the nation, but also since Bush took office a year ago. However,
Powell reportedly has been at odds with the Pentagon on a range of policy
decisions during that time.</TE>
<TE>   The specifics of Powell's request, and the White House response, were
in some dispute Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   White House Counsel Alberto R. Gonzales wrote a four-page memorandum
Friday indicating that Powell wants the president to reverse course and
declare the captives prisoners of war, several officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The Washington Times, which first reported the memo Saturday, said a
cover letter written by National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice asked
members of the president's war cabinet to submit their views so a
memorandum could be presented to Bush on Saturday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   But Sean McCormack, a National Security Council spokesman, said the
Gonzales memo was a draft and that it misstated Powell's position. He
said Powell was not arguing that the detainees be declared prisoners of
war, granting them protected legal status, but that they receive
treatment consistent with the Geneva Conventions.</TE>
<TE>   McCormack said he could not confirm that the National Security Council
had met or made any new recommendations to Bush concerning the issue, but
he acknowledged that there was a lively legal debate about the status of
the detainees. "Terrorism is difficult," he said. "It is hard to know how
to apply existing international norms to this new kind of conflict."</TE>
<TE>   He took pains to argue that the debate would not materially affect the
treatment of the detainees. "The real-world point here is that the
detainees have been and will be treated humanely and consistent with the
principles of the Geneva Convention."</TE>
<TE>   A senior State Department official also described the Gonzales memo as
inaccurate. He said Powell, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, had not proposed giving the captives legal status as POWs.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue is not whether these people are prisoners of war," the
official said. "They are not. They're not going to get musical
instruments or monthly paychecks or any of that. Nothing will change in
their treatment."</TE>
<TE>   The official said Powell is concerned that the administration not give
the appearance of abandoning or ignoring the Geneva Conventions. "We're
concerned about Americans operating in other circumstances. You don't
want to set a precedent that the convention doesn't apply."</TE>
<TE>   Vice President Dick Cheney, speaking to a Cincinnati audience of GOP
supporters, called the detainees "really bad people" who do not qualify
as prisoners of war. But he said they are being treated well. "Nobody
should feel defensive or unhappy about the quality of treatment they've
received. It's probably better than they deserve."</TE>
<TE>   But officials from several human rights groups argued that Powell's
proposed solution was no solution.</TE>
<TE>   "For the White House or the Defense Department to take it on
themselves to make this determination as to who is a prisoner of war and
who is not, without taking it to a court, is simply not adhering to the
Geneva Convention," said Vienna Colucci, a spokeswoman for Amnesty
International USA.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon last week temporarily suspended transfers of prisoners
from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, saying it had run out of space. The
prisoners there are kept in 8-by-8-foot outdoor cages with metal roofs.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, who has fiercely defended the
administration's handling of the prisoners, is scheduled to lead a group
of reporters, including several from overseas news organizations, on a
tour of the Guantanamo camp today.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.), who visited the facility Friday with a
congressional delegation, told CNN the detainees were "not prisoners of
war."</TE>
<TE>   "[They] should not be afforded the comforts or the protections of the
Geneva Convention," he said. "They don't represent a country. They don't
represent a military unit.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not dealing with the homeless here; we're dealing with
terrorists," Inhofe added. "Now we've got to start treating it that way
and recognizing that we are dealing with illegal combatants. And we need
to get this behind us and get the American people to realize that we're
in a war with a bunch of terrorists."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), who also visited the camp, said he also
opposes giving Al Qaeda detainees the full privileges of the Geneva
Conventions.</TE>
<TE>   "A soldier is entitled to be released when the war is over," he said.
"But if these people are committed terrorists who are just going to take
release as an opportunity to attack again, then it would be insane to
release them, especially if they don't qualify as prisoners of war.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the better position," Sessions added, "is that they are not
prisoners of war and we're not bound to do everything the rules of war
call for, but that we're going to follow the spirit of it, which is what
we're doing."</TE>

<HD>Cultivating Democracy in China</HD>
<DH>Asia: Township's illegal election gains support of an influential
journal that argues that voting reforms would wither corruption and boost
faith in leaders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIJING
</DL>
<LD>As China's leaders hunker down before a major government reshuffle
later this year, an influential journal here has taken the bold step of
advocating an illegal political activity: democratic local elections.</LD>
<LD>   In a collection of articles, the latest issue of China Reform argues
that the government should allow townships to directly choose their
leaders. Although village elections have become commonplace, expanding
the franchise to cover the nation's 45,000 townships--each of which
governs several villages--would represent a great leap forward in
political liberalization.</LD>
<LD>   It's a leap expressly outlawed by China's Constitution. But local
democratization is an "inevitable trend" that the Communist Party must
follow if rampant corruption is to be stamped out and people's faith in
their leaders restored, the magazine suggests.</LD>
<TE>   The journal focuses on the example of Buyun, a township in inland
Sichuan province that defied the rules in 1998 and held a direct election
to choose the local leader. Buyun, one of the articles declares, could
serve as a model for the rest of the country and usher in an era of
political reform as significant as China's sweeping economic changes of
the past two decades.</TE>
<TE>   "History has given us another pleasant surprise," said the article,
written under the name Ri Yueming. "Buyun's direct election of its
township head may be China's biggest opportunity in the 21st century."</TE>
<TE>   The four articles are daring in their content and timing.</TE>
<TE>   The Beijing regime is gearing up for an important Communist Party
Congress this fall, a changing of the guard that will see a new president
emerge and many senior figures retire. The government has battened down
the hatches and is eager to quash dissent, even as infighting and
factionalism take place behind the scenes.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, China's townships are in the middle of picking new
leaders, which happens once every three years through a mostly
rubber-stamp process under strict Communist Party control. A circular
issued by the central government last summer sternly reminded local
officials that direct township elections like Buyun's are prohibited.</TE>
<TE>   By urging greater liberalization of a process that is underway, China
Reform is flying close to the sun. The magazine says that Beijing has two
choices for achieving long-term stability: constantly throw money at
local governments to buy their quiescence or democratize them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very, very bold," Yawei Liu, an expert on Chinese village
elections who works at the Carter Center in Atlanta, said of the
articles.</TE>
<TE>   What brought about their publication during such a sensitive time and
in as prominent a journal as China Reform--a monthly magazine that
circulates widely among academics and policymakers--is unclear. Was it
the work of a risk-taking editor? Or was it endorsed--or even
engineered--by a powerful patron able to protect the magazine from
fallout?</TE>
<TE>   The journal is sponsored by the Office of Structural Reform of China's
State Council, or Cabinet. Its editorial board is stocked with liberal
scholars and with well-known, reform-minded economists allied with
Premier Zhu Rongji. Its honorary editor, Wu Jinglian, is Zhu's top
economic advisor.</TE>
<TE>   One editor, contacted by phone, was reluctant to speak about the
series on Buyun but insisted that the articles were conceived by the
magazine on its own.</TE>
<TE>   It was an apt time to revisit the issue, the editor said, because
Buyun held another election for township chief last month. This time,
officials there skirted charges of breaking the law by adding an extra
step to the process: ratification of the election result by a local
congress. Election observers describe it as a superfluous formality, one
that did not affect the free and open vote Dec. 31 by nearly 5,000
residents.</TE>
<TE>   "The election in Buyun was both legal and reasonable, so we reported
it," the editor said. "I don't think the articles will bring us any
negative consequences."</TE>
<TE>   Still, by holding up Buyun's 1998 election as a model, China Reform is
opposing the Communist Party line.</TE>
<TE>   The articles include a report on last month's vote, analyses of the
1998 election, and what amounts to a personal manifesto and meditation on
the benefits of democracy by Buyun's township chief, Tan Xiaoqiu.</TE>
<TE>   "I was elected by the people, and every promise I made during the
campaign is a debt," Tan wrote. "I was a [party] cadre for 10 years and
never had this feeling of indebtedness before. It is this feeling that
spurs me to serve the people wholeheartedly."</TE>
<TE>   His election in 1998 came as a shock to the central government.
Village balloting, though often flawed, has been a staple of the vast
Chinese countryside for more than a decade. But elections in townships,
which represent the bottom rung of formal government, have been
off-limits.</TE>
<TE>   Media coverage of the event was quickly muzzled as the Beijing
leadership agonized over how to respond. In the end, the central
government decided to let Buyun's result stand--Tan was, after all, the
local Communist Party's nominee in the race--but warned other townships
against following its example. Last summer's circular drove the point
home.</TE>
<TE>   That the people of Buyun pressed ahead with another election attests
not just to their courage, observers say, but also to that which some
Chinese leaders fear will be the outcome of such contests: a rising sense
of expectation and empowerment. When representatives in Buyun tried to
come up with a new formula for picking the township chief, the people
demanded to be able to choose for themselves again.</TE>
<TE>   "The people said, 'You gave us the right [to vote] last time. You
can't take it away now,' " said Tian Xiaohong, a scholar who observed
last month's balloting.</TE>
<TE>   The contest pitted the incumbent, Tan, against another township
official. Both stumped in Buyun's villages, delivering speeches and
getting grilled by audiences on such matters as the hated tax on pigs and
Buyun's need for better infrastructure. Tan campaigned on the strength of
his record: construction of Buyun's first major road, the installation of
telephone lines and the connection of cable TV service.</TE>
<TE>   Tan defeated his rival by about 500 votes--a narrower margin than he
had hoped for, but still a victory. The official seal of approval for the
result is pending.</TE>
<TE>   "This kind of election is just great," one 76-year-old resident told a
China Reform reporter. "We can address our concerns directly to the
township chief. And if he makes mistakes, we can ask him to correct
them."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of greater democratization often argue that China's 1.3
billion people, the vast majority of whom are peasant farmers, are not
ready for democracy.</TE>
<TE>   The articles reject that assertion, saying residents know how to
select responsible leaders. Democratic township elections would make the
state more accountable and the system less prone to corruption, the
articles say.</TE>
<TE>   The journal is quick to point out that elections do not necessarily
mean a weakening of the Communist Party's role in government. It calls on
the party to "protect and guide" what happened in Buyun, which it says
could prove to be the political equivalent of Xiaogang village, the
unassuming hamlet that kicked off China's economic reforms more than 20
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   And the magazine cites an irrefutable authority in plumping for more
local democracy: Deng Xiaoping, China's late "paramount leader," who it
says stressed the importance of reforming economics and politics
together.</TE>
<TE>   The 1998 election in Buyun "was a big institutional innovation that
fully validated Comrade Xiaoping's wise judgment. It was thoroughly
supported and accepted by the broad masses of peasants," said the
editor's foreword.</TE>
<TE>   "The masses there always wear proud and sincere smiles when they
mention their township government. We hope such smiles will grace the
faces of even more of our peasant brethren."</TE>

<HD>The Deposed Official, the Wife and the Hit Man</HD>
<DH>Europe: An alleged murder plot is riveting Germans and forcing
politicians to rethink their politics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>POTSDAM, Germany
</DL>
<LD>It's known in the tabloid press as "The Case of the Killer
Minister," although Jochen Wolf is no longer in office and hasn't been
accused of actually taking a life.</LD>
<LD>   The trial of the deposed state construction chief on charges of twice
having solicited the murder of his fourth wife is bringing out such
sordid testimony that even the more respected media often forget to
mention that he hasn't yet been convicted.</LD>
<LD>   The proceedings providing German readers with melodrama that easily
rivals daytime TV also have prompted some soul-searching among local
politicians and voters. Wolf, 60, is now destitute and facing up to 15
years in prison if convicted--but he came within a heartbeat of becoming
governor of sprawling Brandenburg state around the same time he
admittedly took out his first murder contract.</LD>
<TE>   "How can such a man have become a government minister?" his first
wife, Kristina, demanded in an interview with Stern magazine shortly
after his arrest last summer, telling of the beatings she suffered at his
hands even when she was eight months pregnant.</TE>
<TE>   His second wife, Erika, killed herself in the 1970s, and the third
Frau Wolf, Gabriela, left him after only eight weeks of marriage.</TE>
<TE>   An attempt by wife No. 4, Ursula, to force Wolf to pay child support
for his two youngest sons, then teenagers, inspired his first approach to
a hit man in the early 1990s, prosecutors say. Social workers have
reported to the court that Wolf provided no financial assistance to any
of his five children in the years before his arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors contend that the 1998 suicide of Wolf's 25-year-old
Russian mistress after a confrontation with his wife instigated a second
murder contract, in 2000, on Ursula, who is separated from Wolf but still
legally his spouse.</TE>
<TE>   Wolf has pleaded innocent to the charges. He did confess to the first
deal but argues that it bears no legal significance since it was never
carried out and his $5,000 deposit was refunded.</TE>
<TE>   Between the two alleged murder contracts, Wolf was fined by courts for
his part in a hit-and-run car accident and for using his government
office for personal enrichment. The latter fine, about $4,000, cleared
the books on the accusation that had cost him his state office: that he
had acquired land and a spacious villa in the desirable lake district
between Berlin and Potsdam at a fire-sale price from a developer who was
later awarded a lucrative state contract.</TE>
<TE>   Wolf, short and scruffy with a perpetually 4-day-old beard, has
refused to speak to court officials or the media since his arrest July 27
in a tie boutique at Berlin's busy Zoo train station. But a seemingly
incriminating conversation was captured on tape inside the shop, thanks
to a microphone worn by the would-be hit man, who had turned state's
evidence to escape a fourth prison sentence.</TE>
<TE>   The man contracted for the killing, Ralf Muehlbauer, testified for the
prosecution Thursday after swaggering into the courtroom here in a black
turtleneck, broad-shouldered velour jacket, baggy silk trousers and
patent-leather shoes.</TE>
<TE>   "He looks straight out of 'The Sopranos,' " a German journalist
murmured to a colleague beside him.</TE>
<TE>   Muehlbauer is a former fighter with the French Foreign Legion, in
whose ranks he has said he learned "the art of surprise killing."</TE>
<TE>   Exuding sincerity along with sound bites, Muehlbauer told presiding
Judge Horst Barteldes that he had accepted Wolf's down payment of nearly
$5,000 in December 2000 because he had just been released from prison and
needed the money. He gave an animated account of how Wolf allegedly
pestered him to carry out the murder contract, providing details of his
wife's daily routine and the times when Wolf would be out of the country
and beyond suspicion.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me, 'She simply has to go!' " Muehlbauer said, describing the
defendant as a man who became "ice-cold" whenever he spoke of his wife.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Muehlbauer testified, Wolf provided him with a state
business identification card so that the hit man could pose as a
landscape gardener offering to fix up the Wolfs' front yard for the 2001
National Garden Show that was staged in Potsdam. Muehlbauer told the
court that he spent about 45 minutes with Ursula Wolf to case the planned
crime scene after accepting the defendant's down payment but before
reporting the contract to police.</TE>
<TE>   Muehlbauer's motives in testifying against Wolf haven't been made
clear yet, as the trial is only two weeks into an expected two-month
duration. But Wolf's court-appointed defense attorney, Stefan Waldeck,
has cast grave doubts about the credibility of the prosecution's star
witness.</TE>
<TE>   It remains an open question whether the three-judge court will be
persuaded to convict the former construction minister, who in 1992 was
set to replace the Brandenburg governor when it appeared that he might be
ousted in an intelligence scandal.</TE>
<TE>   But the headline-grabbing case has set politicians to rethinking their
practice of selecting candidates for important state jobs on the basis of
who has been most influential in elevating the party.</TE>
<TE>   The respected Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung daily questioned how it
came to be that Wolf had obtained one state position after another even
after losing his ministerial job following the influence-peddling
scandal.</TE>

<LD>India peacefully celebrated the anniversary of its birth as a
republic Saturday with heavily armed security forces on the streets to
prevent any violence at a time of tension with neighboring Pakistan.</LD>
<LD>   The main Republic Day parade in the capital, normally a proud display
of military might, was relatively muted, with most troops and equipment
deployed along the Pakistani border.</LD>
<LD>   With 65,000 police backed by anti-aircraft guns on the ground, buglers
played as Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee paid homage to dead
soldiers.</LD>
<TE>   Across the nation, tens of thousands of police and paramilitary troops
on full alert guarded ceremonies and key buildings, but crowds were
smaller than usual.</TE>
<TE>   No major violence was reported by early evening.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities had feared militants might launch a new assault on a
nation still shaken by a Dec. 13 raid on its Parliament and last week's
attack on a U.S. cultural office in the city of Calcutta.</TE>

<HD>Gibraltar Residents Caught Between Rock, Hard Place</HD>
<DH>Culture: Negotiations to let the territory pass from British to
Spanish hands worry locals, who prefer to retain their distinct
character.</DH>

<DL>GIBRALTAR
</DL>
<LD>The Rock isn't as steady as it used to be.</LD>
<LD>   After nearly three centuries under British rule, the Rock of
Gibraltar--a synonym for dependability and a symbol of the British
empire's former invincibility--is tipping back into Spanish hands, to the
alarm of many of its residents.</LD>
<LD>   The Spanish and British governments have revived negotiations after 13
years of deadlock on the future of Europe's only colony and pledged to
reach an agreement by summer, which many people expect to lead to
decolonization.</LD>
<TE>   That would fulfill a long-held Spanish dream and rid Britain of an
issue that has bedeviled relations with Spain since the War of Spanish
Succession in the early 1700s.</TE>
<TE>   It would also be a boon for Europeans. Gibraltar has been a repeated
obstacle to cooperation within the 15-nation European Union, recently
holding up a deal on a unified air-traffic control system designed to
reduce delays for hundreds of millions of travelers.</TE>
<TE>   But it is the last thing Gibraltarians want. The views of the nearly
30,000 inhabitants of the cramped sliver of land surrounding the Rock
have barely budged since a 1967 referendum--when all but 44 of the 12,182
ballots cast were against returning to Spanish rule.</TE>
<TE>   "We are quite happy to stay as we are," says dentist George Earl,
grimacing as he sits in a long queue of cars waiting to cross the border.</TE>
<TE>   The line is backed up so far on the isthmus that it spills over the
airport runway and traffic has to be stopped every time a plane lands. At
the border crossing, a Spanish guard leisurely checks passports while
chatting with a colleague.</TE>
<TE>   Spanish officials say they restrict the frontier because Britain
hasn't scrapped EU passport controls. They also contend the colony is a
center of money laundering and contraband smuggling.</TE>
<TE>   Gibraltarians claim the border snarl--along with Spanish-led
international sports boycotts--are meant to demoralize them so they'll
accept Spanish rule.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not going to get anywhere with this," Earl shouts as
frustrated drivers honk their horns.</TE>
<TE>   Measuring just 2 1/2 miles by 1 mile, Gibraltar is only about 11 times
the size of the Mall in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   One of the mythological "Pillars of Hercules" flanking the strait
where Europe and Africa nearly touch, the 1,405-foot-high limestone
promontory commands the entrance to the Mediterranean, which made it a
key base when Britain's Royal Navy ruled the seas. But the long range of
modern weapons and the changing world situation lessened its importance,
and Britain's military left years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The name Gibraltar is thought to be a corruption of Jebel al-Tariq, or
Mt. Tariq, after the 8th-century Islamic conqueror of the Iberian
Peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   In 1704, an Anglo-Dutch army led by British Adm. George Rooke captured
Gibraltar from the Spaniards, with orders to put it under the domain of
Charles III, the Hapsburg claimant to the Spanish throne.</TE>
<TE>   But under the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, Charles' Bourbon rival, Philip
V, ceded the territory to Britain in exchange for being recognized as
Spain's monarch. The pact included the condition that if Britain ever got
rid of Gibraltar, preference "shall always be given to the Crown of Spain
before any others."</TE>
<TE>   Periodic Spanish attempts, or threats, to recover Gibraltar by force
continued until the Spanish dictator Gen. Francisco Franco sealed the
border in 1969 in an attempt to coerce the colony's return by isolating
it economically.</TE>
<TE>   Such persistence is rooted in Gibraltar's negative symbolism in
Spanish culture, as opposed to the positive connotation in the
English-speaking world that made the Rock a commercial emblem for the
Prudential insurance company.</TE>
<TE>   Historian Charles Powell, the son of a Spanish mother and English
father who lives in Madrid, says Gibraltar reminds Spaniards of the
beginning of their imperial decline at the hands of Britain.</TE>
<TE>   "England is the perfidious Albion, the Protestant enemy, the
Anglo-Saxon enemy, the 'Anti-Spain' in the Spanish tradition," Powell
says. "To have the Anti-Spain occupying a piece of Spanish territory is
the ultimate insult."</TE>
<TE>   In previous talks, Spain refused to discuss anything but regaining
full sovereignty, viewing the Utrecht treaty as ruling out
self-determination for Gibraltarians.</TE>
<TE>   The Foreign Office in London still insists that any change in
sovereignty should be approved by the people of Gibraltar.</TE>
<TE>   However, Spain's El Pais newspaper said Jan. 11 that negotiators are
secretly discussing a deal in which London would relinquish that demand
in exchange for Madrid accepting joint administration for an indefinite
period.</TE>
<TE>   The head of the colony's self-rule government, Chief Minister Peter
Caruana, refuses to attend the talks between British Foreign Secretary
Jack Straw and Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Pique.</TE>
<TE>   "We should not be expected to endorse by our presence a process in
which things can be agreed over our heads," Caruana says, pounding his
fist on a long oak table in his office.</TE>
<TE>   But his spokesman, Francis Cantos, says Caruana has gone to Spain
twice for secret meetings with a foreign ministry official to voice his
demand for a veto right if he attends the Gibraltar negotiations. So far,
that demand has not been met, Cantos said.</TE>
<TE>   Recalling Hong Kong's reversion to Chinese rule in 1997, Caruana's
predecessor, Joe Bossano, fears Britain wants out of Gibraltar too.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a long tradition that the British get out of their colonies
when they want to get out, by manipulating the situation so that they
appear to be kicked out and they go out being the victims," he says.</TE>
<TE>   In a sense, the pullout has already begun. The British naval yard,
long the lifeblood of the local economy, was closed in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Gibraltarians have adapted well. After Spain reopened
the border that year, they began transforming the territory into an
offshore business center and tourist mecca, now drawing 6 million
visitors a year.</TE>
<TE>   What used to resemble a run-down, working-class London
neighborhood--only sunnier and warmer--has been transformed into a
picturesque town with cobblestone streets and cozy outdoor cafes below
the restored battlements where cannoneers once kept Spanish soldiers at
bay.</TE>
<TE>   The Spaniards nowadays come as shoppers. They snap up watches,
electronics, food and jewelry in the tax-free shops lining Main Street,
the only thoroughfare longer than a few blocks.</TE>
<TE>   With the private sector now accounting for nearly 90% of Gibraltar's
economic activity, some shopkeepers fear their competitive advantage will
vanish if they return to Spanish rule.</TE>
<TE>   "We would be just another little town in Spain," says jeweler Clara
Cohen, whose ancestors immigrated in the 18th century even though Jews
were still banned from post-Inquisition Spain.</TE>
<TE>   Still, opposition to Spain may be softening in light of its booming
economy and flourishing democracy.</TE>
<TE>   The Chamber of Commerce president, Bruno Callaghan, says Gibraltar has
much to gain from closer ties with Spain.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're part of an economy of 40 million people," he said, "you're
bound to be able to have better benefits accruing to you than if you're
part of an economy of 30,000 people.".</TE>

<HD>Zimbabwe Court Rules for Displaced Voters</HD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>HARARE, Zimbabwe
</DL>
<LD>Zimbabwe's High Court, ruling in favor of the opposition, has
ordered the government to allow people to vote in any constituency in the
presidential election in March, an opposition party spokesman said
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Learnmore Jongwe, information secretary of the Movement for Democratic
Change, said the ruling handed down Friday would enable thousands of
Zimbabweans who he said had been displaced by political violence to cast
their vote in the March 9-10 poll.</LD>
<LD>   Movement for Democratic Change leader Morgan Tsvangirai poses the
biggest challenge to President Robert Mugabe in his 22-year rule.</LD>
<TE>   "We welcome the ruling, which will make it possible for tens of
thousands of our supporters who have been forced to flee their
constituencies due to violence to vote," Jongwe said, confirming a report
on the ruling in the privately owned Daily News.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling comes at a time of mounting pressure on the Zimbabwean
government by the Commonwealth, the European Union, the United States and
human rights groups to take action to ensure that the March election will
be free and fair.</TE>
<TE>   They have criticized the government's human rights record, its passing
of laws to tighten the ruling party's grip on power, crackdowns on the
opposition and its handling of the country's economic crisis.</TE>
<TE>   A controversial media bill due to be debated by parliament this week
would restrict access for foreign correspondents and require local
journalists to obtain a license.</TE>
<TE>   "The High Court judge, Justice Rita Makarau, ordered Tobaiwa Mudede,
the registrar general, to allow people to vote anywhere in the country
and not necessarily in their constituencies as decreed by the
government," Saturday's Daily News reported.</TE>
<TE>   In her ruling Friday, the judge ordered Mudede to compile a common
voters' roll in time for the election, the Daily News said.</TE>
<TE>   Rights groups say hundreds of Zimbabweans have been displaced in the
political violence that has rocked the country ahead of the election.</TE>

<LD>Japan will run out of sites to dump its industrial waste in less

study.</LD>
<LD>   If Japan keeps generating industrial waste at current rates, sites for
its disposal will become full in about 3.7 years, with dumps in the
greater Tokyo area reaching their capacity in just 1.2 years, according
to a study released Friday by the Ministry of the Environment.</LD>
<LD>   Part of the problem is that one of the biggest producers of waste--the
construction industry--is a favorite of the Japanese government, which
spends heavily on roads, dams and other public works projects.</LD>

<HD>Pygmies in Cultural No-Man's-Land</HD>
<DH>Africa: In the Congo, tribal members find themselves shunned by
citizens and without representation in government.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ARNAUD ZAJTM</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>KINSHASA, Congo
</DL>
<LD>Yongela Bongo kept the secret from her husband for the entire seven
years they were married. But when he finally discovered the truth, he
kicked her out on the street--keeping their six children and all their
belongings.</LD>
<LD>   Bongo's failing? To have been born one of the 600,000 Pygmies who live
in the Central African nation of Congo.</LD>
<LD>   "I had managed to hide my identity for seven years, but I knew that
the day my husband would discover it, it would end that way," says Bongo,
who sits wrapped in a dusty cloth in an unfinished stone church.</LD>
<TE>   Pygmies, not all of whom are below-average height, are believed to be
the earliest inhabitants of Central Africa. Over the centuries they
retreated into the region's dense rain forests to keep away from the more
powerful Bantu tribes.</TE>
<TE>   The legendary hunters, who use traditional spears, bows and snares,
had the tangled wilderness to themselves until recent times. Then,
commercial hunters armed with automatic rifles and an expanding logging
industry began encroaching on their jungle sanctuary.</TE>
<TE>   When Congo's civil war broke out in 1998, many Pygmies were forced to
abandon their traditional way of life for the cities, where the
once-proud people now live in harsh poverty and face intense prejudice.</TE>
<TE>   Unable to visit her own children, Bongo lives with her brother and
ekes out a living selling peanuts on the streets of the capital,
Kinshasa.</TE>
<TE>   Pygmy representatives, who gathered recently under a roof of branches
on the shores of one of the city's many rivers, are bitter.</TE>
<TE>   "No Pygmy holds any position in the government at any level,"
complains Caicha W'Otshimo Osambi, a rare educated Pygmy who is chairman
of the tribe's Kinshasa association.</TE>
<TE>   In a country where corruption and tribalism have been the norm for 40
years, exclusion from power can mean exclusion from society.</TE>
<TE>   For the Pygmies, this isolation goes back centuries.</TE>
<TE>   Long taken as slaves by the Bantu tribes who dominate sub-Saharan
Africa, Pygmies were also sold to foreign traders for export.</TE>
<TE>   "Our Congolese brothers made a point of selling us to the Arab
merchants," says Jean-Louis Ebango. "So we had to flee civilization."</TE>
<TE>   Pygmies moved deeper and deeper into Congo's thick forests, turning to
traditional beliefs in magic to afford some security from outsiders.</TE>
<TE>   Ngoma Esale, a traditional Pygmy chief, is covered with shells and
dried animal skins. "This protects me and my community," explains the
father of 16.</TE>
<TE>   But such amulets seem to have little effect against long-standing
traditions, including the custom of burying a Bantu chief with a few live
Pygmies to serve the dead leader in the next life.</TE>
<TE>   "My 5-year-old nephew was buried that way," Esale says. "A Bantu
middleman was given money to capture some Pygmy children to be buried
alive with his traditional chief."</TE>
<TE>   In 1967, dictator Mobutu Sese Seko encouraged Pygmies to come out of
the bush and help develop the country. Ebango now wonders whether they
were right to heed his call.</TE>
<TE>   Ten years later, Pygmies were forcibly recruited to take part in
Mobutu's 80-day war with secessionist rebels in the southern province of
Katanga.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't given proper weapons. We just used our spears and arrows.
Hundreds of our Pygmy brothers died," Ebango says.</TE>
<TE>   Many Pygmies remember the lesson and refuse to take part in Congo's
current conflict. But their suffering continues.</TE>
<TE>   Before the fighting started--drawing in six foreign armies and at
least three rebel groups--Ebango made a living buying animals from Pygmy
hunters in the bush and selling them at Kinshasa's markets. The war
forced him to abandon the trade.</TE>
<TE>   "When you come back from the forest, it is impossible to enter the
towns," he explains. "Local authorities immediately suspect you of
communicating with the rebels."</TE>
<TE>   Like many Pygmies, he now works as a servant for a wealthy Congolese
family.</TE>
<TE>   With his meager salary, he cannot afford to send his children to
school. All day long, the kids play around a few tiny mud houses into
which families of more than 10 people are sometimes packed.</TE>
<TE>   "My ancestors had escaped from slavery, but I am now working as a
servant," he says. "I am not proud."</TE>

<HD>Afghanistan Banking on the Wisdom of the Aged</HD>
<DH>Asia: Senior citizens are helping to rebuild the war-torn nation
with their expertise in education, the military, politics and business.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KANDAHAR, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Anyone seeking the measure of Afghanistan's desire to rebuild need
look no further than the sparkle in Abdul Rasul's eyes.</LD>
<LD>   His enthusiasm about the country's future is so great that the
Kandahar teacher found himself punching the air during a recent
conversation with a foreign visitor.</LD>
<LD>   "Now's the chance to escape the past, to build the kind of future
Afghanistan deserves," said Rasul, who was surrounded by 10th-graders on
the edge of a school soccer field. Then, nodding toward the students, he
added, "This will soon be their responsibility."</LD>
<TE>   The boys were silent as Rasul spoke, for this is still a society that
equates age with wisdom--and Rasul has a lot of both.</TE>
<TE>   At 82, he's one of two octogenarians on the faculty of this city's
prestigious Aborihan Albironi High School. He is also part of an
important newly empowered group in Afghan society--elderly men who have
forsaken leisure to join in the daunting task of rebuilding their
shattered country.</TE>
<TE>   In education, the military, business and politics, these senior
citizens offer a precious commodity: knowledge of life when Afghanistan
was just another exotic Third World country, a poor nation but one at
peace, with elected representatives, a constitutional monarchy and lots
of friendly help from countries on both sides of the Cold War divide.</TE>
<TE>   "They can bring people together just with the respect they command,"
said Ahmed Karzai, brother and confidant of interim Prime Minister Hamid
Karzai. "Their wisdom can help revive Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   The graybeards are just one of several long-dormant elements of Afghan
society now stirring in the wake of the Taliban regime's collapse.
Others, including wealthy expatriates, intellectuals and women, also have
rallied to the nation's cause.</TE>
<TE>   But the seniors are especially important because of their status and
the fact that their very presence symbolizes continuity with the past.</TE>
<TE>   Their activism is a measure not only of the groundswell of hope that
permeates Kandahar but of the fear that if good and wise people fail to
act now, Afghanistan will once again be abandoned to warlords and
religious zealots.</TE>
<TE>   "If they [leaders of the interim government] don't call us, it's up to
us to go to them to help," said Mohammed Omar Sati, a 58-year-old
agricultural specialist who runs a dairy cooperative in Kandahar. Sati
said he is seeking financing for a program that would provide small
incubators to illiterate rural women and then would buy the eggs from the
resulting chickens. He noted that the idea had been rejected as
un-Islamic by the mullah who ran Kandahar's agricultural department
during the Taliban era. Sati recalls the mullah's befuddled response:</TE>
<TE>   "He took one look at the eggs [in the incubator] and exclaimed: 'This
is not Islamic. Where are the mother and father?' "</TE>
<TE>   Sati also hopes to dust off a plan to regenerate the region's dairy
cattle herds using artificial insemination. That idea was refused by the
same mullah on the same grounds: un-Islamic.</TE>
<TE>   At the political level, long-sidelined tribal elders in Kandahar
province are already playing an important behind-the-scenes role in
maintaining the fragile stability that has given Kandaharis new hope.</TE>
<TE>   Eighty-year-old Wakil Lal Mohammed Khan, a Popolzai tribal chief who
served 19 years as a member of the national parliament during the reign
of the former king, Mohammad Zaher Shah, and six years under house arrest
during the Taliban era, has been asked to serve on a 30-member provincial
peace council. The body was recently established by Kandahar's governor,
Gul Agha Shirzai, to mediate disputes over the spoils of the new era.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him I was old enough to be his father, but I would work for
him as a common foot soldier if he promised to work for all of
Afghanistan and not the narrow, petty interests of the few," Khan said.
"He promised he would do that."</TE>
<TE>   Khan said Shirzai then immediately acceded to a second demand--that
government officials working at the city and village levels in the
province also pledge to renounce factionalism and favoritism.</TE>
<TE>   Azizullah Wasifi, who once served as agriculture minister for the
exiled former king, drew loud applause from several thousand people at a
political rally in Kandahar on Thursday when he delivered a strong
warning about the consequences of yielding to the regional, tribal,
religious and ethnic jealousies that have so plagued this country.</TE>
<TE>   "If you present yourselves as Durrani, Herati, Shiite or Sunni, you
will divide yourselves into small groups, and I swear you will lose
Afghanistan," said Wasifi, a popular and respected figure in his day who
was either in jail or in exile for much of the last quarter of a century.</TE>
<TE>   In many instances, the return of the country's seniors is a question
of simple necessity. Rasul, who teaches physical education, and his
80-year-old colleague, Haji Mohammed, whose specialties are economics,
logic and Persian literature, have returned in part because there is no
one else to teach the students.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed Daoud, director of Kandahar's Education Department, said 95
mainstream schools have been restarted in the city over the last month, a
little less than half the number that operated during the last years of
Zaher Shah's reign in the early 1970s. Under Taliban rule, that number
dropped to four. With the schools now desperate for experienced teachers,
retirees such as Rasul and Haji Mohammed are getting the call.</TE>
<TE>   "In the last 23 years, one generation was born in the trenches and
another died in them, so there was no education and no one to train
them," Daoud said. "As a result, we have no teachers. These older
teachers play an important role. They have a lot of advice and tips to
offer."</TE>
<TE>   The picture is much the same elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   At a makeshift military academy near the Kandahar airport, Syed Abdul
Karim, the former military chief of a group that resisted Soviet
occupation in the 1980s, has called on older officers, including some who
once served in Zaher Shah's army, to help put together a military force
for a democratic Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "Who else is there?" he asked with a smile. "We are starting from
zero."</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to argue with that assessment.</TE>
<TE>   The academy consists of a cluster of mud buildings, a hodgepodge of
equipment donated by minor warlords, and 300 willing recruits who drill
in sandals and sneakers. In one building last week, about 20 officers
were talking over lunch, exchanging stories about the old days and
lamenting the quality of their recruits.</TE>
<TE>   "In Zaher Shah's time, recruits were well-educated," said Noor Rehman,
a 58-year-old onetime officer in the former monarch's army. "Now they are
mostly illiterate, and that's a big change. For the Taliban, it was just
jihad and nothing else."</TE>
<TE>   Rehman acknowledged that much has changed since Zaher Shah's days in
power, but he maintained that lessons can be drawn from the past, such as
strong discipline.</TE>
<TE>   "It won't be easy, but we will build a good army," he said. "We'll
take the best of the old and the new."</TE>
<TE>   Like Rehman, and despite the daunting tasks ahead, many of the seniors
called back to help rebuild Afghanistan remain optimistic that the
nation's nightmare is ending.</TE>
<TE>   "We've faced a lot of trouble and hardship, but we have survived,"
said Rasul. "Now, if all Afghans can work together, our country can be
great."</TE>

<HD>Ring a Testament to a Wedding That Wasn't to Be</HD>
<DH>Sept. 11: With her marriage just a month off, a New York woman
learned what can happen to a couple's best-laid plans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL LUO</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>A few weeks after Sept. 11, Karen Carlucci took the train into the
city to pick up her wedding ring.</LD>
<LD>   She had canceled everything else: the hall, the band, the flowers, the
honeymoon. She had put her engagement ring back in its box.</LD>
<LD>   But she wanted this, she decided. The jeweler didn't know what to say,
so he just handed it to her.</LD>
<TE>   She slipped the thick platinum band onto her right ring finger--and
vowed to go on.</TE>
<TE>   "The engagement ring represented us being engaged. This," she said,
fingering the band, "now represents a new time in my life but still
connected to him."</TE>
<TE>   For Karen, 29, the timing of Sept. 11 was especially cruel. She and
Peter Christopher Frank, 29, were to be married in a little more than a
month. She was supposed to wear Vera Wang. Louis Armstrong's, "A Kiss to
Build a Dream On," was to be their first song.</TE>
<TE>   He already had his bachelor's party. Her bachelorette bash was
supposed to be in a week and a half. The honeymoon was planned for St.
Bart's and Anguilla. They were going to build a future together.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the dates that were once eagerly anticipated have marched
steadily by, transformed into milestones of loss.</TE>
<TE>   "We were about to get married," she said. "How do I move on from
that?"</TE>
<TE>   Yet, in small, tentative steps, she has begun to do just that.</TE>
<TE>   She's gone back to work--part time. She can now stay by herself in the
Manhattan apartment they once shared, although she still spends most of
her time at her parents' home in New Jersey. She's mustered the
enthusiasm to go out with friends again.</TE>
<TE>   She's learning to work around the hole in her heart, said her mother,
Elaine Carlucci.</TE>
<TE>   Some Sept. 11 charities have helped Karen, but she's been stymied by
others because she is only a fiancee, not a spouse.</TE>
<TE>   People don't seem to understand that families today are more than just
married couples with children, she said.</TE>
<TE>   She still remembers when she first met him, six years ago. He turned
around in the bar and looked her straight in the eye. "Nice to meet you,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   She was taken aback by his confidence. "Who does he think he is?" she
thought.</TE>
<TE>   Later, they flirted on the dance floor. Outside, he asked if he would
ever see her again.</TE>
<TE>   "Probably not," she said, before speeding away in a cab.</TE>
<TE>   But something about this former college football player with the
movie-star looks got to her. Like teenagers at a slumber party, she and
her giggling friends called a slew of Peter Franks in the phone book at 4
a.m., looking for him.</TE>
<TE>   She got his number a few days later from a mutual friend. Their first
date was at an Italian restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   He was more handsome than the guys she usually went for. He could be a
J. Crew model, she thought. Later, when investigators asked Karen if he
had any birthmarks or scars, she almost blurted out, "Look for the
perfect man. That's what he is."</TE>
<TE>   He seemed very focused to her, as he explained his job as an asset
manager. He wanted to be successful, to make a lot of money.</TE>
<TE>   Before long, Karen was helping take care of Chavez, his rambunctious
1-year-old boxer.</TE>
<TE>   He proved to be a romancer, buying her flowers and introducing her to
opera. They went to museums and on long walks.</TE>
<TE>   After dating for three years, they decided to move in together. They
weren't ready for marriage quite yet.</TE>
<TE>   Their apartment in Greenwich Village faced south, toward the World
Trade Center. Karen took a picture from the window and hung it in their
bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, Pete was hired at Fred Alger Management, on the 93rd floor
of the north tower. Alger, with its sterling Wall Street reputation, was
the next step in his career, he told Karen.</TE>
<TE>   Last Christmas Eve, the couple stayed at Karen's parents' house in
Florham Park, N.J. In the morning, Pete told Karen's father, Bill, that
he was going to ask Karen to marry him. Bill Carlucci cried.</TE>
<TE>   Pete originally planned to ask her on New Year's Eve, at a bed and
breakfast on Long Island, but a blizzard socked in the area.</TE>
<TE>   They went the next week. Walking along the beach, Pete said he needed
to ask her something.</TE>
<TE>   Karen remembered squinting because the sun was in her eyes.</TE>
<TE>   He reached into his pocket and pulled out the ring, a gorgeous emerald
cut diamond with baguettes.</TE>
<TE>   In the next few months, they picked a location, set a date and chose a
band. Karen looked at dozens of dresses before picking a strapless gown
that was simple yet elegant.</TE>
<TE>   The weekend before Sept. 11 was his bachelor's party. Glenn Conte, a
childhood friend, drove him down to Atlantic City to meet up with the
guys. His friends remember him seeming at peace, as he sat on the beach.</TE>
<TE>   On the morning of Sept. 11, Pete put on a suit and headed for the
door. She remembered looking up suddenly, thinking they hadn't properly
bid farewell. She opened her mouth to call to him, but the door had
already closed.</TE>
<TE>   "I specifically remember thinking I didn't say goodbye to him," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   At 8:41 a.m., Pete sent an e-mail from his office to the groomsmen in
his wedding, reminding them to get measured for their tuxedos.</TE>
<TE>   At work, Karen was preparing for a meeting when she heard the news.
She dialed his number but couldn't get through.</TE>
<TE>   The phone began ringing with other people. Everyone tried to remain
upbeat. His sister, Michelle, insisted that he must be walking home.</TE>
<TE>   Conte came to wait with Karen at the apartment that afternoon. They
tried not to pay attention to the news as the evening stretched on.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, she went home to New Jersey. With her mother at her
side, Karen sat down on her bed and broke down.</TE>
<TE>   The Friday after Sept. 11, she told her mother, "We have to cancel
everything."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the vendors cried on the phone with them. Some sent heartfelt
notes of condolence.</TE>
<TE>   A week later, she walked around the armory. She found the flier that
his friends had put up for him. Next to Pete's face, she wrote, "I love
you. I miss you."</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 22, the day that was to be her bachelorette party, she went
to his memorial service in Queens. The best man, John Kavanagh, delivered
a eulogy.</TE>
<TE>   "On Oct. 19, Karen's father would have given her away," he said.
"Today, we're giving Pete away."</TE>
<TE>   For her wedding day, Karen gathered everyone together. She put on a
red dress. They had food catered.</TE>
<TE>   Karen's younger brother played the violin, just as he would have at
the wedding. A book was passed around in which everyone wrote their
memories.</TE>
<TE>   The day after was the lowest point. Karen woke up alone, her wedding
dress still in its plastic wrapping.</TE>
<TE>   Another Sept. 11 fiancee whom Karen talked to put it well: They are
widows before they had the chance to become brides.</TE>
<TE>   An Alger official told Karen that their victims' foundation was only
for "families" but that the company was exploring how it might help her.</TE>
<TE>   Upset, Karen said that Pete would want her taken care of.</TE>
<TE>   Pete's mother, Connie, who lives on Long Island, says now that they've
lost Pete, they don't want to lose Karen too. She calls Karen "my
daughter."</TE>
<TE>   Karen has put together a scrapbook of photos and memories. She took
down the photo of the trade center in the bedroom. In its place, she hung
a cross.</TE>
<TE>   She's started to venture out more. For Pete's birthday, on Dec. 1, she
went out with a group of his friends. In contrast to earlier occasions,
the mood was light. They told stories about him and laughed. When a good
song came on, Karen danced freely. This, she said, is what he would have
wanted.</TE>
<TE>   They raised their glasses. She did too.</TE>
<TE>   To Peter Frank.</TE>

<HD>Only Rule of the Game: Don't Drop the Headless Calf</HD>
<DH>Central Asia: The chaotic national sport, buzkashi, involves
players on horseback and an unusual 'ball.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SLATER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Somehow, amid the thrash of whips and hail of hooves, the team from
Parwan discovered an interloper, an extra rider who had sneaked onto the
field to aid the losing Kabul side. In an instant, the Parwan team set
upon him, lashing and pummeling the man as he spurred his horse
desperately to get away.</LD>
<LD>   The would-be savior's soldiers leaped from the bleachers and began
running to the aid of their commander, their AK-47s at the ready.
Spectators dropped to the ground, taking cover.</LD>
<LD>   Buzkashi, the wild, ruthless and sometimes deadly national sport of
Afghanistan, has returned to the capital after a six-year ban during the
reign of the Taliban regime.</LD>
<TE>   Played by horsemen who battle for control of the carcass of a
decapitated calf, the game has apparently lost none of its power during
its absence--power that is physical, political and endlessly metaphorical
in its parallels to Afghan life.</TE>
<TE>   A ritual that appears little more than unadulterated mayhem, with
different horsemen frequently taking hold of each of the calf's legs and
pulling in different directions, buzkashi is in fact much more than a
game. It often illuminates the influence, or lack thereof, of its
sponsors, for only the wealthy can afford to organize a buzkashi, only
the most powerful a particularly successful one.</TE>
<TE>   The game also is a chance for everyone from powerful commanders to
lowly tribesmen to demonstrate their bravery. Chapandazan, or riders,
seldom go home without having shed blood, and sometimes lose their lives
beneath the horses' hooves.</TE>
<TE>   "I have been shot five times just in this one hand," said Noor Habib,
a renowned moujahedeen and Northern Alliance commander, and the leader
this recent day of the Parwan team. He held up his left hand, mangled
during more than two decades of war. "What is buzkashi to me?"</TE>
<TE>   The fact that this visceral game has returned to Kabul--and that
players and sponsors can't comprehend why humanitarian organizations
won't help fund it--goes far in illuminating the still-vast chasm between
Afghanistan and much of the world.</TE>
<TE>   The stadium teemed this day with more than 10,000 fans. Six months
ago, 10,000 spectators meant only one thing: the Taliban was meting out
punishment, executing adulterers with a shot to the head, hacking off the
hands of thieves.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw them chop off a hand once," said 24-year-old Omar, whose first
year of life was his only year without war in Afghanistan. "I was OK
until they walked through the stands, holding the hand up. Then I got
sick."</TE>
<TE>   An early form of buzkashi (pronounced BOOS-kah-shee) was likely
developed soon after the first domestication of the horse by Central
Asian tribes and introduced in what is now Afghanistan by Turk and Mongol
invaders. Precisely when and where are not only unclear but unimportant
in this land of oral history.</TE>
<TE>   The most primitive and essential form of the game, known as tudabarai,
is still practiced in the north of the country and is a near-perfect
symbol for the chaos of Afghanistan. Some matches involve 1,000 players
or more. There are no boundaries in tudabarai, and no teams. Every man
rides only for himself--for money and honor.</TE>
<TE>   To score, a chapandazan must simply break away with the calf, if only
for a second, wresting the carcass from the hundreds of other hands
seeking to control it. Whether a horseman acquires sole control of the
carcass, and is indeed free and clear of the other riders, is endlessly
subjective and the cause of many a fight.</TE>
<TE>Game Reflects Nation's Struggles</TE>
<TE>   The other version, played here in the capital and other cities, could
be viewed as an athletic microcosm of the repeated attempts, and ensuing
failures, of regime after regime to bring order to this hard land.</TE>
<TE>   Qarajai, the version molded by 20th century governments that sought
with very limited success to organize the game and popularize it in the
outside world, is played by two teams, made up of 10 players each. Each
team has a goal, a circle drawn with stones or lime, in which the calf
carcass is to be deposited. A team can also score when a rider rounds a
flag located at the far end of the field while carrying the calf. There
are two 45-minute halves to the game, with a short rest period in
between.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the more elaborate rules and the limit on the number of
riders, the basic premise of qarajai is essentially the same as that of
tudabarai: Seize the carcass by nearly any means and ride away.</TE>
<TE>   "Allahu akbar!" (God is great), the announcer shouted like a shot to
begin this recent game. "Allahu akbar, allahu akbar!"</TE>
<TE>   With the call, the horsemen laid their whips to their mounts, as well
as the mounts of others, and galloped toward the dead calf. Holding on
with only their legs, riding at top speed, the chapandazan reached all
the way to the ground in an effort to hoist the calf, this carcass
weighing more than 60 pounds, alongside their horses.</TE>
<TE>   A member of the team from Parwan, an area of the Panjshir Valley,
where boys grow up dreaming of being chapandazan like American boys dream
of being professional football players, seized the carcass. A teammate
grabbed the horse's harness and tried to drag them both out of the melee
and toward the flag.</TE>
<TE>   The horse, its eyes wild with pain and fury, bit at the necks of other
steeds, as well as the calf.</TE>
<TE>   After a minutes-long scrum, which is how the majority of any buzkashi
is spent, another Parwan rider snatched the calf from his teammate and
broke free. He galloped away and rounded the flag, earning one point.
Then he headed back toward the Parwan goal, dropping the calf inside the
circle for two more points.</TE>
<TE>   The literal translation of buzkashi is "goat-dragging" or
"goat-lifting," but the etymology of the word is, again, mysterious. The
"goat" may have once been a goat, but for generations it has usually been
calf, perhaps because a calf carcass holds together better during play
than a goat carcass, some elders say.</TE>
<TE>   It is not without ceremony that the buzkashi calf is dispatched. The
sacrifice, however, is but a small part of a buzkashi. Traditionally,
games are held to celebrate a marriage, or a circumcision, or another
rite of passage.</TE>
<TE>   The day before the recent game, riders, horse owners and organizers
pinned the black calf to the ground, pointed its head west, toward Mecca,
and slit its throat. Then they removed its head, cut off its hooves to
help protect players' hands, and used its body for practice.</TE>
<TE>   "Safdar!" the announcer cried over a tinny public address system,
announcing the name of another Parwan rider who had scored. The rider
collected a fistful of 10,000-afghani notes, bills from various
commanders who had helped sponsor the game, as well as donations from the
crowd. He stuffed the bills, worth about 35 cents each, into his pockets
before heading back onto the field to rejoin the game.</TE>
<TE>   This buzkashi was sponsored by the nascent Afghan government, with
help from several powerful commanders. The government had neither the
resources nor clout yet to mandate order at the event, however, and the
commanders would not benefit by acknowledging governmental power.</TE>
<TE>   The riders complained because only a few were paid; the commanders
complained that they couldn't afford to feed their horses and their
soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   There were fights over rules, accusations of game-fixing. And then,
with Parwan stomping Kabul 10 points to 2, the extra man on the Kabul
team was discovered.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Parwan team snatched their woven-leather whips from
between their teeth and swung them across the man's head and face. They
hit him with their wood-and-steel whip handles. He spurred his horse and
tried to fight back.</TE>
<TE>   The horseback brawl made its way around the field--a soccer field in
this case, but a tudabarai field has no set size--and returned to near
the goals, where the governor of Kabul and other dignitaries sat on a
maroon sofa looking disdainful. The chase came to a halt, and the game's
referee kicked out the extra Kabul player.</TE>
<TE>   That's when the man's soldiers rushed from the stands with their guns.
The match stopped for 15 minutes, but no shots were fired.</TE>
<TE>Match Evokes Different Feelings in Watchers</TE>
<TE>   Hamidullah Hassanyar, who oversees government-sanctioned buzkashis and
was a member of the Kabul team, quit in disgust. "This isn't buzkashi,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some fans also walked out, not because they were appalled by the
behavior of the riders, but because they believed that the match was
fixed by bettors, guaranteeing a Parwan win.</TE>
<TE>   The rogue Kabul rider agreed to leave the field. His soldiers returned
peacefully to the stands, and the game resumed.</TE>
<TE>   Parwan continued its romp. Half an hour later, with the stands half
empty, the announcer delivered the final score: Parwan 18, Kabul 5.</TE>
<TE>   One of the first state-sponsored buzkashis since the Taliban seized
power in 1996, the game was over. It had brought little glory to the
interim government of Prime Minister Hamid Karzai, and, in the psychology
of the game, suggested that his influence here was minimal.</TE>
<TE>   Shakir, 16, rushed to his horse. The horse's mouth was bleeding badly.
He threw a wool blanket over its back.</TE>
<TE>   Shakir had rented his horse to Safdar. Safdar had scored three points,
bringing honor to them all.</TE>
<TE>   "This is our sport," Shakir said, proudly slapping his horse on the
neck. "You must be a wrestler to play buzkashi. I am not yet strong
enough. One day I will be."</TE>

<HD>Attacks Bring New Reality to Fiction</HD>
<DH>Books: "How do you write about murder and mayhem after everything
we've all been through?" says one author.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELEN O'NEILL</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>She glides through the wards in green scrubs and glasses, filling
her notebooks, eavesdropping on doctors, plotting her next murder.</LD>
<LD>   And no one suspects a thing.</LD>
<LD>   Officially, Leah Ruth Robinson works as a hospital volunteer. But
there's another reason she roams the corridors of St. Luke's-Roosevelt
Hospital Center in upper Manhattan: She wants to learn how people become
infected with anthrax and smallpox, sickened by poisoned mushrooms and
botulism. She wants to understand the intimate, gruesome details of how
they will suffer and die.</LD>
<TE>   Her apartment is stuffed with books and papers on such subjects. Her
research is precise, and it finds its way, in all sorts of deadly
manifestations, into her novels--fast-paced medical thrillers with titles
including "Unnatural Causes," "First Cut" and "Blood Run." Her
protagonist is a New York City emergency room physician who finds herself
in mysterious, terrifying situations that once would have seemed
unfathomable.</TE>
<TE>   Except since Sept. 11, nothing seems impossible anymore.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes," Robinson says, "I feel like I'm in the middle of my own
plot."</TE>
<TE>   She's not the only one. Mystery writers, particularly those who write
medical thrillers set in New York City, find themselves in a world that
is stranger than fiction these days, as anthrax and bioterrorism swirl
through the headlines and everyone seems jittery about what might happen
next.</TE>
<TE>   The unimaginable has become imaginable, says John Marr, a doctor and
author who has had a long association with disease and bioterrorism, both
fictional and factual. For years he worked as an epidemiologist with the
New York State and city health departments. He served on committees on
bioterrorism. He created fact sheets on possible bioterrorist threats. He
studied the history of anthrax.</TE>
<TE>   And then he used his knowledge to write a fictional account about an
anthrax attack in California. When he wrote "The Eleventh Plague" in the
mid-1990s with co-author John Baldwin, Marr said, an anthrax outbreak was
considered possible but highly unlikely. Health officials, he said, were
more concerned about someone unintentionally carrying Ebola into the
country.</TE>
<TE>   Before Sept. 11, Marr had been tinkering with a plot that involved the
total collapse of the economy and a mysterious epidemic. His main worry:
readers might find it implausible.</TE>
<TE>   Then the towers collapsed and Marr put his book on hold.</TE>
<TE>   Jillian Abbott, an Australian journalist living in New York, faced a
similar dilemma.</TE>
<TE>   After two years of research, some of it spent tramping through remote
stretches of India and Pakistan, she was a few chapters short of
finishing her first novel when the attacks occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Her plot involves a Pakistani terrorist plotting to overthrow the West
by launching a biological attack on the United States. He masterminds it
all from an underground haven just outside Sri Lanka.</TE>
<TE>   Forget it, one agent said before Sept. 11. It's just too farfetched.</TE>
<TE>   Now Abbott feels an almost guilty sense of justification.</TE>
<TE>   "I always knew there were dark corners of the world where evil lurked,
where low-tech, low-cost equipment could be used in high-tech ways," she
said. "I knew because I had spent years doing the research on the
ground."</TE>
<TE>   Abbott still hopes to publish the book. But she felt compelled to
rewrite some scenes. She removed the part about a terrorist cell living
in New York. "Too close to reality," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Abbott belongs to the New York chapter of Mystery Writers of America,
which provides members with all sorts of useful tips on how to bump off
characters. At the organization's headquarters on 47th Street--a musty,
creaky old place on the sixth floor of the Mercantile Library
building--authors can find, among other things, a list of the 10 most
popular poisons, guides to death and decomposition, and a handbook on
forensic pathology that includes a chapter on "Wounds produced by
pointed, sharp-edged and chopping instruments."</TE>
<TE>   "We're a nice group of people with very devious minds, who are
constantly thinking of ways to kill, deceive and double-cross," said
Timothy Sheard, an epidemiologist in the infectious disease department at
Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn and author of "This Won't Hurt a
Bit," a medical thriller involving a mysterious hospital death.</TE>
<TE>   Other chapter members include a police officer, a hospital president,
a lawyer and a judge.</TE>
<TE>   Talk at their monthly gatherings is usually an irreverent mix of
murder and mayhem and good-natured grousing about the perils of their
creative worlds. Their motto is "Crime doesn't pay . . . enough!"</TE>
<TE>   But lately, their meetings have become more somber. "How do you write
about murder and mayhem," says writer Jonathan Harrington, "after
everything we have all been through?"</TE>
<TE>   And a more practical question: Do readers want more death and
destruction after all they have been through?</TE>
<TE>   "Sept. 11 changed everything," Sheard said. "In real life and in
fiction."</TE>
<TE>   At the hospital where Sheard works, the bioterrorism task force now
meets regularly, new patients are monitored for signs of anthrax
poisoning, and a huge heated decontamination tent has been purchased for
use should an outbreak occur.</TE>
<TE>   Such realities have infected Sheard's writing. For his third novel, he
has started researching the history of fundamentalists who want to
destroy America.</TE>
<TE>   "It's part of the landscape now," he says, "and I think we should be
writing about it."</TE>
<TE>   Other writers have worried about plot lines that might suddenly seem
inappropriate or offensive, but Walter Wager had no problem writing after
Sept. 11. The 77-year-old writer from New York, author of thrillers such
as "Tunnel," "58 Minutes" and "Telefon," said the attacks made him so
mad, so bitter, that he wrote more furiously than ever.</TE>
<TE>   And he suspects his villains might get nastier.</TE>
<TE>   They're already pretty bad. They've crashed cars that sealed the
Lincoln Tunnel, trapping thousands of motorists and threatening to kill
them if they didn't get $10 million. They've released nerve gas in
subways. They've threatened to use remote-control planes as weapons to
blow up hotels. And they've found their way into movies, such as "Die
Hard II."</TE>
<TE>   But it never occurred to Wager to have villains who were willing to
die for their mission.</TE>
<TE>   "My bad guys always want to get out," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Wager's latest novel, "Kelly's People," is due out in March. The
villain is an Arab terrorist who threatens to launch a nuclear attack
from his cave headquarters in the Middle East. It was too late to
substantially alter the book. So it now includes an author's note
explaining that it was finished before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Like Robinson, Wager says it is impossible not to be affected
creatively by the terrorist attacks, and by the patriotism, vulnerability
and physical changes they inspired.</TE>
<TE>   "They are part of the city consciousness now," he said. "They are part
of my consciousness . . . not so much that the buildings are gone, but
that we are seeing the National Guard patrolling Penn Station."</TE>
<TE>   Still, although his bad guys might become more evil, and his plots
more sinister, in the end Wager's good guys will continue to win.</TE>
<TE>   Says Wager, "I really do believe that happens in reality as well as in
fiction."</TE>

<HD>2 Marines Killed in Pakistan Honored</HD>
<DH>Funerals: Mourners in Alabama and South Carolina hail the San
Diego-based servicemen as heroes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MONTGOMERY, Ala.
</DL>
<LD>Two of the seven Marines killed in the crash of a KC-130 transport
and refueling plane in Pakistan were remembered Saturday as heroes who
died for their country.</LD>
<LD>   In Montgomery, mourners remembered Gunnery Sgt. Stephen L. Bryson, the
plane's flight engineer, as a fearless leader.</LD>
<LD>   "I say this to Stephen: You didn't run from the heat of battle. You
didn't have to fight, but you did. He was a good soldier," the Rev.
G.W.C. Richardson said at a memorial service.</LD>
<TE>   More than 1,000 people attended the service for Bryson, a native of
Montgomery, including Gov. Donald Siegelman, Mayor Bobby Bright and
Marines stationed with the 36-year-old at Marine Corps Air Station
Miramar in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   "Stephen Bryson was a patriot, a peacemaker. He will not be
forgotten," Siegelman said.</TE>
<TE>   Sgt. Michael Grace told of the first day in Afghanistan, when the
Marines had just landed at the base known as Camp Rhino.</TE>
<TE>   He said that there were reports of enemy forces nearby and that the
runway for landing the huge KC-130 was mostly a line in the sand.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very stressful combat situation. There was fear on
everybody's faces. The only person who I did not see fear on his face was
Stephen. He was always calm, cool and collected," Grace said.</TE>
<TE>   Bryson was buried with full military honors after the nearly
three-hour service.</TE>
<TE>   Resolutions honoring Bryson from the state and the city were presented
to his widow, Katrina, and his mother, Deloris, of Montgomery.</TE>
<TE>   Also Saturday, about 700 people attended the funeral of Capt. Daniel
G. McCollum at Union United Methodist Church in Irmo, S.C.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a great American, a great South Carolinian, and we all mourn
his loss," Gov. Jim Hodges said.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Rich Roberts spoke for McCollum's fellow Marines and presented
McCollum's Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal to his widow,
Jennifer, who is expecting the couple's child in July.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts said McCollum, 29, of Richland, S.C., had flown more than 50
wartime missions refueling military aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   He described McCollum as "an outstanding Marine and an exceptional
pilot."</TE>
<TE>   Army Capt. Matt McCollum remembered his brother as a role model.</TE>
<TE>   "I looked up to Dan, and I wanted to be like him. We all are his
legacy. It was good to have known you. Thank you," he said over his
brother's flag-draped casket.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel McCollum was buried at the Bush River Memorial Gardens.</TE>

<HD>Marjan the Lion Dies of Old Age</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>He survived a king, a coup, Soviet occupation, communist rule,
moujahedeen battles, the Taliban and a U.S. bombing campaign. But on
Saturday, the only lion in Afghanistan died of old age in Kabul Zoo.</LD>
<LD>   "He had not eaten for a few days, and this morning I discovered him
dead in his cage," said zookeeper Shir Agha Omar, who had cared for
Marjan for the last eight years.</LD>
<LD>   The one-eyed Marjan was believed to be about 23. Lame and almost
toothless, the beast was subjected to daily taunts and teasing from most
visitors to the run-down zoo.</LD>
<TE>   A Taliban fighter once climbed into Marjan's enclosure to prove his
bravery, only to be killed by the lion. The man's brother returned and
lobbed a grenade at Marjan, blinding and disfiguring him and injuring his
legs.</TE>
<TE>   Marjan was the subject of a rescue mission by the World Society for
the Protection of Animals, which last month sent a team to Kabul to look
after the lion and the few remaining occupants of the zoo.</TE>
<TE>   They wanted to transfer the animals to facilities in India and
Pakistan, but Kabul municipality refused, determined to reconstruct the
zoo.</TE>

<HD>Kids of 9/11 Carry Loss of a Lifetime</HD>
<DH>Grief: A special counseling camp aids children who lost a parent in
the World Trade Center attack.</DH>

</DL>
<LD>In the wobbly handwriting of a 10-year-old boy, the card attached
to a green balloon read, "Dear Dad, I hope you are doing very well in
heven. I also hope you will be watching over me every day and every
night."</LD>
<LD>   It was a message to his father, a firefighter lost in the fiery attack
on the World Trade Center.</LD>
<LD>   The boy released the balloon message into the sky during one of two
bereavement camps held last weekend for youngsters who lost a parent in
the disaster.</LD>
<TE>   Separated by age into small groups, the children divulged memories,
worries and questions they might not otherwise share with their surviving
parent for fear of causing more pain.</TE>
<TE>   In voices barely louder than a whisper, they admitted it took months
to realize their lost parents weren't coming back.</TE>
<TE>   "A week ago they found a part of his face and we had a funeral," one
little girl said of her father, eliciting knowing nods from the group of
children.</TE>
<TE>   The number of children who lost a parent in the Sept. 11 attack is not
known, but the bond firm Cantor Fitzgerald alone estimates its more than
650 victims left 1,300 children. At the Fire Department, which lost 343
people, more than 600 children are missing at least one parent. Hundreds
more have not been counted.</TE>
<TE>   Comfort Zone Camp, based in Richmond, Va., held two one-day sessions
for the children, one in New Jersey and another at a high school in New
York. The nonprofit camp has been counseling grieving children since
1999.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the 17 children at the Queens session didn't say much during
the group discussions, which were followed by arts and crafts and a
snack. But simple interaction with other grieving children can help with
the healing, said camp founder Lynne Hughes, who lost her mother at age 9
and father at age 12.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of them don't know anybody else that this has happened to,"
Hughes said. "They show up and see other kids that have experienced a
death and know they're not alone."</TE>
<TE>   One girl solemnly said her friends don't understand her pain because
they still have moms to take them shopping.</TE>
<TE>   Nine-year-old Amy Gardner described her dream of going back in time to
warn her firefighter father to avoid the trade center on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "Now there's three people in my family. It's not a unit anymore," Amy
said.</TE>
<TE>   Another girl, who lost her mother in the attack, said she gets scared
that her dad's going to die too.</TE>
<TE>   "And I won't have anybody," she said, playing with a silver necklace
her mother used to wear to work at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc. on the
89th floor of the north tower.</TE>
<TE>   Amy looked at the girl wistfully and said she wished she had a piece
of jewelry or something of her father's that she could wear every day.</TE>
<TE>   "I just have a picture in my head," she said. "That was the last time
I saw him."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Cushnie, who led discussions for the adults, said most of the
parents are frustrated because they aren't sure what their children are
thinking.</TE>
<TE>   That's why Elizabeth Gardner brought Amy and her brother, Christopher,
7, to the camp.</TE>
<TE>   "They need to talk and get things out and they don't really like to do
that with me because they don't want to upset me," she said. Her husband,
Tom Gardner, was with the Fire Department's hazardous materials unit.</TE>
<TE>   Amy said she enjoyed the day and found the small group with other
children, ages 9, 10 and 11, to be very helpful.</TE>
<TE>   "The way some people are solving their problems, that helps give me
ideas," she said.</TE>

<HD>Clinton the Statesman Takes Show on Road</HD>
<DH>Politics: The former president will raise money for Democrats and
try to improve his standing in history.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<BD>TIMES POLITICAL WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One year after leaving office under a renewed ethics cloud, former
President Clinton is reemerging as a top attraction on the political
fund-raising circuit. Democrats are delighted.</LD>
<LD>   Republicans too.</LD>
<LD>   With an eye on history and an ear to the ground, Clinton is hoping to
help shape the political debate this election season and beyond,
cementing the changes he brought to the Democratic Party and putting a
retrospective gloss on his stormy presidency.</LD>
<TE>   This week, Clinton will headline events for Sen. Barbara Boxer
(D-Calif.) in San Francisco and Gov. Gray Davis and the Democratic Party
in Beverly Hills. In between, the former president will give a speech on
globalization at UC Berkeley and make private appearances in Palo Alto
and Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   Even in retirement, the nation's 42nd president remains as polarizing
as ever.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats say that today's sagging economy contrasts with the
prosperity of the Clinton years and that the Enron Corp. debacle puts his
tenure into perspective.</TE>
<TE>   "Which is more troubling to you as a citizen: Bill Clinton's
relationship with Monica Lewinsky or George Bush's relationship with
[ousted Enron chief] Ken Lay?" asked Paul Begala, a political strategist
in the Clinton White House. "Monica Lewinsky didn't cost anybody" a job,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Republicans say the recession and the terrorist threats facing
America result from the failings of the Clinton administration, which
"seems a lot less impressive than it did when the Nasdaq was at 5,000,"
in the view of William Kristol, publisher of the conservative Weekly
Standard. "Now [the 1990s are] seen as almost a wasted decade."</TE>
<TE>   The two major political parties certainly can't agree on whether
Clinton will be an asset or liability to fellow Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   "If a candidate wants to stand alongside Clinton, it's a picture worth
a thousand words that will help Republicans all over the country," said
Steve Schmidt, a spokesman for the GOP's congressional campaign arm.</TE>
<TE>   But Paul Maslin, a Davis advisor, is delighted Clinton will be
stumping for the governor at Thursday night's event in Beverly Hills. The
dinner, hosted by billionaire Ron Burkle, is expected to raise $1.5
million for Davis' reelection effort.</TE>
<TE>   "He dwarfs everyone else: the congressional leadership, [former Vice
President Al] Gore, any governor," Maslin said of the former president.
"He's still our No. 1 guy."</TE>
<TE>   The attitude among Democrats has changed markedly from a year ago.
Back then, even those who staunchly defended Clinton through impeachment
and the worst of the administration's campaign finance scandals expressed
disgust at the pardons he granted during his final hours in office. The
most controversial, to fugitive businessman Marc Rich, is under
investigation by the U.S. attorney in New York City.</TE>
<TE>   A Gallup Poll last February registered Clinton's highest disapproval
rating ever, 55%, and Democratic leaders across the country all but
begged him to disappear.</TE>
<TE>   Like so much else, those sentiments changed after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The terrorist attacks "put many things into perspective," said Iowa
Democratic Chairman Sheila McGuire Riggs, who was less than welcoming
toward Clinton a year ago. Now, she said, the former president "has an
open invitation to Iowa."</TE>
<TE>   Part of it too is the stumbling economy and a federal budget awash in
red ink again. For many Democrats, that only underscores the good times
America enjoyed under Clinton. "People may have had problems with his
personal issues with women . . . but not what he did with the economy,"
said Dick Harpootlian, chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party.
"Clinton looks better today than he did in office."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the last time Gallup asked the question, in November,
Clinton's disapproval rating had fallen to 47%. About the same, 48%,
approved of him.</TE>
<TE>   The former president used to devour that kind of polling data; once he
even weighed public opinion on where to spend his summer vacation. But
those close to Clinton insist that politics is just a tiny part of his
post-presidential agenda.</TE>
<TE>   He is far more absorbed, they say, in writing his memoirs, overseeing
construction of his presidential library, giving speeches at $100,000 to
$200,000 apiece and focusing on such issues as AIDS in Africa and
national service.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, he presided over a conference on the Middle East at New
York University, the first under the auspices of the William J. Clinton
Presidential Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   "He's much more interested in ideas" than politics, said Begala, one
of several Clinton allies who sought to dispel the image of a man
obsessed with his legacy or determined to sway history's judgment of his
presidency.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Begala and others said Clinton remains deeply
invested in the change he brought to the Democratic Party, the "third
way" that moved its policies toward the middle and made Democrats more
competitive nationally.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, Clinton has been quietly meeting with the half-dozen or
so Democrats looking at a White House bid in 2004, chatting by phone or
holding court in his New York office high above Harlem.</TE>
<TE>   He is also stepping up more overt partisan activities, starting Monday
in California and continuing with fund-raisers over the next few weeks in
Florida and New York City.</TE>
<TE>   "There are numerous requests from both [state] parties and
individuals," said Julia Payne, a Clinton spokeswoman. "When the
president can be helpful, he will be . . . , either helping them raise
the resources necessary to compete, making get-out-the-vote phone calls
or writing letters."</TE>
<TE>   His utility remains somewhat limited, however. Clinton probably won't
be campaigning for House or U.S. Senate candidates in, say,
Republican-leaning South Dakota or Montana, states the Democrats wrote
off in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got to be used in a very careful way," said Brian Lunde, a
Democratic strategist who crossed over to back Bush over Gore. "I
wouldn't put him into a [congressional] district with any element of
uncertainty."</TE>
<TE>   For as popular as he remains with adoring Democrats, Clinton is
equally adept at energizing contemptuous Republicans. Fred Davis, a
Republican ad man, jocularly invited Clinton to North Carolina, where
Davis is producing spots for Elizabeth Hanford Dole's U.S. Senate bid.
One Democratic rival is Erskine Bowles, Clinton's former White House
chief of staff. "Come wrap your arms around Erskine," Davis urged.</TE>
<TE>   Even with all the attention he attracts, most doubt that Clinton will
have much lasting political effect this election year, for good or ill.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas Sosnik set up countless campaign stops as political director
of the Clinton White House. He figures the effect on voters wore off
after about 72 hours. "For a non-president, I would guess it's even
faster."</TE>

<HD>A New Chapter in Ex-Ranch Wife's Life</HD>
<DH>Lifestyles: Judy Blunt's new book of growing up in Montana looks to
have a resonance far beyond northwest plains.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN GALLAGHER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>MISSOULA, Mont.
</DL>
<LD>Reading even a single passage from her memoir, one realizes just
how far Judy Blunt has come from her years as a stifled ranch wife.</LD>
<LD>   In her book "Breaking Clean," Blunt tells of writing her thoughts on
freezer paper rolled into a Sears &amp; Roebuck typewriter, until her enraged
father-in-law smashed it with a sledgehammer.</LD>
<LD>   Her story about life as a Montana ranch girl and as a prairie ranch
wife who walked away for a fresh start arrives in stores Feb. 5, but the
book began in a college writing class years ago and grew legs.</LD>
<TE>   "Breaking Clean" netted Blunt a $35,000 Whiting Writer's Award in
October. In 1997, it won a PEN/Jerard Fund Award for a work in progress.
Now, as Alfred A. Knopf of New York prepares to release "Breaking Clean,"
reviewers are showering praise.</TE>
<TE>   National Geographic Adventure likes Blunt for "striking matches on the
scuffed soles of her feelings," and Book magazine likened her to Frank
McCourt, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for his Irish memoir "Angela's
Ashes." Wrote Publishers Weekly, "Blunt's own story is so rich and
genuine, readers will clean their plates and ask for more."</TE>
<TE>   These days, Blunt, 47, teaches writing at the University of Montana,
where she became a student soon after leaving Phillips County in 1986
with, as she wrote, "a new divorce and an old car, with three scared kids
and some clothes piled in back." This winter and spring, there will be
book tours.</TE>
<TE>   "Ranch wife had always been my default career," Blunt said during an
interview in her campus office. "I knew I could do it. I didn't have a
lot of guidance about finding my way in the outside world."</TE>
<TE>   The granddaughter of Montana homesteaders, Blunt grew up on a remote
eastern Montana ranch, between the Ft. Belknap Indian Reservation and the
Missouri River Breaks.</TE>
<TE>   She sold her parents' horse, and used the money to attend Northern
Montana College for one academic quarter. Then, at 18, she wed a Vietnam
veteran 12 years her senior, and moved to his family's grain and cattle
ranch 15 miles from where she grew up.</TE>
<TE>   Some ranch couples function as business partners, but Blunt said that
as the daughter-in-law in a family ranch corporation, she had virtually
no standing.</TE>
<TE>   "My job basically was to take care of men, and when they came along,
babies," she said. But she is quick to add that her story is not the
story of every ranch wife.</TE>
<TE>   "Breaking Clean" was written over the course of a decade, mostly
student years for Blunt as she pursued a bachelor's degree and then a
master of fine arts at Montana.</TE>
<TE>   She felt torn about leaving the ranch. "It took her quite awhile to
resolve that stuff for herself," said author William Kittredge, one of
Blunt's professors a dozen years ago.</TE>
<TE>   As a student she paid the bills with college financial aid,
child-support checks and money from a job that had her sanding and
varnishing wood floors for customers who included actress Andie
MacDowell, part of Montana's emerging celebrity element at the time.</TE>
<TE>   "Judy survived on three and four hours of sleep a night, sometimes
less, and about three pots of coffee," said Clifford Cain, who owned
Custom Wood Floors. "I don't know how she did what she did." He remembers
watching her children join her on the stage at her graduation ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   "Breaking Clean" began with an assignment in the university's
creative-writing program. Blunt submitted her essay, now the book's first
chapter, to professor William Bevis, who was so moved by her piece that
he read it to an auditorium of students.</TE>
<TE>   "I read it out loud and the class was just stunned, silent," said
Bevis, who describes her writing as "unpretentious, certain and exact."</TE>
<TE>   Soon afterward, Blunt the journalism student became an English major
as well. Her book of poetry, "Not Quite Stone," was published in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Kittredge, who has written several books and co-edited the 1988
anthology "The Last Best Place," which brought attention to Montana
writing, said it is hard to predict how "Breaking Clean" will be received
by a national audience.</TE>
<TE>   "Western books tend not be big successes nationally," he said. "But
once in a while, one is."</TE>
<TE>   Blunt's book has all the Western elements: hard winters, a one-room
school, isolation, a desperately feverish child and more.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is a book that will last, and last and last," Kittredge
said. "Decades from now, it will still be in print."</TE>
<TE>   Blunt is cautious about forecasting what might lie ahead</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really have a full set of options yet," she said. "I don't
know how far this book will fly me."</TE>
<TE>   She has looked at opportunities in metro areas, places like Miami and
Pittsburgh, but is mindful that her writing ethic is grounded in the
West. She knows there are good things about "staying where your stories
are heard."</TE>
<TE>   "I can't manufacture excitement about learning to live in a large
city," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes she wonders if moving to Missoula was her "last brave
thing," she said.</TE>

<HD>Excerpts From 'Breaking Clean'</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After supper one spring evening, my mother and I stood in the
kitchen. She held her back stiff as her hands shot like pistons into the
mound of bread dough on the counter. I stood tough beside her. On the
porch, John had presented my father with a bottle of whiskey and was
asking Dad's permission to marry me. I wanted her to grab my cold hand
and tell me how to run. I wanted her to smooth the crumpled letter from
the garbage can and read the praise of my high school principal. I wanted
her to tell me what I could be.</LD>
<LD>   I am sometimes amazed at my own children, their outrage if they are
required to do the dishes twice in one week, their tender self-absorption
with minor bumps and bruises. As a mom, I've had to teach myself to croon
over thorn scratches, admire bloody baby teeth and sponge dirt from
scraped shins. But in my mind, my mother's voice and that of her mother
still compete for expression. "Oh, for Christ's sake, you aren't hurt!"
they're saying, and for a moment, I struggle. For a moment, I want to
tell this new generation about my little brother calmly spitting out a
palm full of tooth chips and wading back in to grab the biggest calf in
the branding pen. I want to tell them how tough I was, falling asleep at
the table with hands too sore to hold a fork. . . .</LD>
<TE>   That night when his dad left, John laid down the law as gently as he
could. My smoking had raised more hell than it was worth. He must forbid
me to smoke. There was too much at stake to stand on principle. If I
loved him, I would do this for him. There was more, and I sat silently
and listened. Everything he said made sense. I couldn't defend smoking, I
found, without sounding selfish, a spoiled teenager. John vowed to help
me quit and I nodded, and in a way the matter was settled, mapped out in
clear lines. All I had to do was keep both feet on the right side. All I
had to do was be good.</TE>
<TE>   In August of 1986, I left Phillips County with a new divorce and an
old car, with three scared kids and some clothes piled in back. We
followed the sun west for hours, climbing mountain passes, crossing river
after river, until we spanned the final bridge into Missoula. The kids
started school the next morning, and within days I started my freshman
year at the University of Montana, the four of us holding hands and
stepping together into a world of mountains and shopping malls. Even the
air smelled different--the rotten-egg stench of pulp mills blowing in
from the west, or, as often, the clean, rich redolence of the Clark Fork
river.</TE>
<TE>   As the new century begins, I am fortunate to still have my family on
the land where I grew up. I can drink coffee in the kitchen where I
learned to bake bread, bathe in the same shallow cast-iron tub of sulfur
and salts, visit the lopsided outbuildings where I once fed chickens,
scouted new litters of kittens and roped milk pen calves. I can ride
through a herd of cattle descended from cattle my grandfather knew. When
I'm done, I get in my car and drive back to Missoula, secure in my sense
that the landscape of my childhood remains intact, in place. For 50 years
my parents have held the line, grubbing a marginal existence from
marginal land. . . .</TE>

<HD>Holocaust Insurance Claim Deadline Gets Pushed Back</HD>
<DH>Dispute: International commission gives families eight more months.
Its chairman remains frustrated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The chairman of an international commission created to resolve
Holocaust-era insurance disputes has extended its deadline for submitting
claims until the end of September, amid continuing tumult about whether
the group can fulfill its mandate.</LD>
<LD>   Lawrence S. Eagleburger, the former secretary of State who heads the
International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims, took the
action late last week after stormy meetings in Washington at which he
resigned in frustration and then agreed to continue serving.</LD>
<LD>   Eagleburger told commission members Thursday that he was pushing back
the deadline eight months, from Jan. 31 until Sept. 30. "The deadline
must be extended in order to allow adequate time to collect lists [of
insurance policyholders] from the companies, process them through Yad
Vashem [the Holocaust center in Jerusalem] and publish the names on our
Web site with adequate time for the public to review the lists."</LD>
<TE>   Extending the deadline "creates the possibility that thousands more
valid claims will be honored," said Daniel Kadden of Seattle, a
consultant to a survivors' organization who attended the Washington
meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Insurance companies have been at odds with the commission, Jewish
organizations and U.S. regulators for months over releasing information
on policies sold from 1920 to 1945. The companies say there are vastly
fewer valid claims than survivor advocates believe and that producing the
lists would be burdensome and, in some instances, would violate European
privacy laws.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates of Holocaust survivors and their heirs maintain that the
insurance companies are attempting to hide the true magnitude of unpaid
claims.</TE>
<TE>   Disclosure of the policyholder lists is the key to a fair process
because nearly all Holocaust victims lost their records when they were
taken to the Nazi death camps, said Nat Shapo, director of the Illinois
Department of Insurance and chairman of the Holocaust Task Force of the
National Assn. of Insurance Commissioners. In addition, the Nazis did not
issue death certificates at the camps. Consequently, hardly any of the
survivors or heirs have proper paperwork for their claims, making them
dependent on insurance companies to search their files and make them
public.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the international commission has run up more than $40 million
in expenses, while the five European insurance companies that are members
of the commission have made only 1,000 offers of compensation, according
to commission records. Victims' families have accepted 275 of those,
saying many offers were unjustly low.</TE>
<TE>   Extending the deadline was the first move made by Eagleburger after he
obtained a written agreement from five insurers that gives him
"unfettered authority" to resolve thorny issues that have beset the
commission.</TE>
<TE>   The companies signed the letter Wednesday, about 24 hours after
Eagleburger stormed out of a commission meeting at the Westin Fairfax
Hotel. "Find yourself another chairman," the veteran diplomat declared to
attendees from Israel, the insurance companies, Jewish organizations and
U.S. regulators, according to people who were present.</TE>
<TE>   But over the next two days, after numerous meetings in his hotel
suite, Eagleburger was persuaded to keep the job, which pays $350,000 a
year, and was given the greater authority.</TE>
<TE>   Eagleburger has criticized the insurance companies for failing to
honor commitments and has expressed frustration at the degree of
skepticism that survivor advocates and members of Congress have expressed
about the commission, which was chartered under Swiss statutes and whose
operations are not subject to U.S. disclosure laws.</TE>
<TE>   Eagleburger, 71, declined to return calls. And despite his decision to
stay on, he remains "very frustrated with things," said his aide, Dale
Franklin.</TE>
<TE>   "The frustration does not go away with one agreement. We hope the
companies will abide by the decision" to give Eagleburger more authority,
Franklin said. "Everyone agrees we have not paid enough claims."</TE>
<TE>   The move to extend the deadline was praised by Rep. Henry A. Waxman
(D-Los Angeles), who severely criticized the commission's performance at
a congressional hearing in November and chastised Eagleburger for
refusing to provide information on certain matters.</TE>
<TE>   "I am cautiously optimistic," Waxman said Friday night. "This is going
to be the last chance to fulfill the long-standing commitment to victims
of the Holocaust who have insurance coverage."</TE>
<TE>   Eagleburger's move also was lauded by insurance regulator Shapo.
However, he said that extending the deadline would be meaningless unless
the insurance companies cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a pretty picture," Shapo said, referring to the
long-running stalemate on how to resolve the insurance claims. The
commission "is dangerously close to becoming a frivolous exercise," he
said, emphasizing that important issues remain unresolved. Among them are
the publication of policyholder lists and the companies' attempt to
recoup about $30 million that they gave the commission for operating
expenses.</TE>
<TE>   The overall issue involves claims by heirs of people murdered by the
Nazis who contend that the insurance companies have refused to pay on
life insurance policies written in pre-World War II Europe.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, about a year after the controversy generated widespread
publicity in the U.S., spurred by the filing of major class-action
lawsuits, several of the major insurers agreed to join an international
commission in hopes of resolving the conflict outside the U.S. court
system.</TE>
<TE>   Five major insurers--Allianz of Germany, AXA of France, Winterthur and
Zurich of Switzerland, and Assiscurazioni Generali of Italy--agreed to
fund the commission in return for receiving a "safe harbor" from U.S.
litigation. The companies pledged to contribute $90 million, but after
putting in $30 million they ceased providing funds.</TE>
<TE>   At the congressional hearing in November, Eagleburger said the
companies had declined to provide more money to "punish" the commission
for decisions he had made. The companies have said they were concerned
that the commission was spending excessively.</TE>
<TE>   Many other German insurance companies have declined to join the
commission despite repeated entreaties by Eagleburger and some German
government officials.</TE>
<TE>   So, while numerous other issues of Holocaust reparations--including
reclaiming Swiss bank accounts and settling slave labor lawsuits--have
been settled over the last few years, the insurance disputes appear
nowhere close to resolution.</TE>
<TE>   More than 16 months ago, negotiators for the U.S. and German
governments linked the insurance and slave labor issues in a $4.6-billion
deal funded by German industry and the German government. Last year,
payments began to some of the thousands of slave laborers covered by the
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   About $220 million of the settlement pot was allocated to cover
insurance claims. However, some key issues, including disclosure of
policyholder lists, have kept the money from being distributed.</TE>
<TE>   New York University law professor Burt Neuborne, who has represented
survivors in several class-action Holocaust reparations cases, said he
hopes a final agreement is reached soon after months of "very rocky
negotiations." After the $220 million was set aside for insurance claims,
Neuborne successfully urged a federal judge in New York to dismiss
class-action cases against the insurers.</TE>
<TE>   However, if Eagleburger is unable to reach an accord, Neuborne said he
might have to go back to the federal judge and ask him to reopen the
cases.</TE>
<TE>   "That might be the only thing that would shake the companies loose,"
Neuborne said.</TE>

<HD>Enron Debacle Shakes Up Congress' Agenda; War Now Shares Spotlight</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>In the political pond that is Congress, Enron has dropped a
boulder. And the ripples are rocking lawmakers who find their legislative
agendas and electoral prospects roiled by a company many Americans had
never heard of a few months ago.</LD>
<LD>   Enron's financial collapse has shoved to the fore an array of
issues--pension protection, accounting procedures, the fundamental role
of government in regulating business--that were far off the radar screen
just a month ago, when a war-obsessed Congress recessed for the holidays.</LD>
<LD>   The Enron debacle also has given new life to issues that had been
foundering, such as campaign finance reform. A reform bill has elbowed
its way onto the House calendar, as congressional concern grows that
Enron has emerged as a striking symbol of the influence wielded by
big-money contributors.</LD>
<TE>   And a major casualty of the Enron scandal may be GOP plans to replace
portions of Social Security with private accounts more closely linked to
the stock market. It was an idea that already had been hurt by stock
market declines and the sharp reduction in budget surpluses that
advocates hoped could ease the transition cost. But privatizing Social
Security will be an even tougher sell if Enron makes people more edgy
about the stability of 401(k)s and other private pensions, analysts from
both parties say.</TE>
<TE>   "At the same time we are looking at the security of private pensions,
we also need to be protecting, not privatizing, Americans' public
retirement system," Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) said
Saturday in the Democrats' weekly radio address.</TE>
<TE>   As Congress reconvened last week, committees were tripping over one
another to hold hearings on Enron. Often, this type of investigative
frenzy results in harsh rhetoric and an occasional moment of high drama,
but little else.</TE>
<TE>   The Enron case may be quite different. Unlike the probes of President
Clinton's financial and personal problems, the House's check-bouncing
scandal of the early 1990s or the Iran-Contra affair of the 1980s, the
Enron investigation may address pocketbook issues that directly affect
people outside the Washington political bubble.</TE>
<TE>   A clamor is already rising for legislation to protect workers'
pensions from an Enron-style meltdown, which wiped out its employees'
retirement nest eggs. Bills already have been introduced to limit how
much of a company's own stock can be put into retirement savings plans
and to provide employees with more information about their company's
finances.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what congressional investigations should be about," said
Thomas Mann, an expert on Congress at the nonpartisan Brookings
Institution think tank. "It's about something consequential that has
potential legislative consequences."</TE>
<TE>   The Enron investigation also has raised a more far-reaching question:
How much government oversight and regulation is needed to keep the free
market running smoothly and fairly?</TE>
<TE>   "Executives sold stock and got out while the little people got wiped
out; those are not good facts . . . for those of us who believe in
private markets over government," said Bill McInturff, a Republican
pollster.</TE>
<TE>   They also are facts that he predicts will have "an enduring impact in
public policy debates."</TE>
<TE>   That may put Republicans at a disadvantage in those debates. But as a
political matter, the issue does not cut cleanly across partisan lines.</TE>
<TE>   Although Republicans were the primary recipients of Enron's largess,
Democratic candidates and party organizations received 26% of the $6
million in political contributions the company and its employees have
made since 1989, according to a study by the Washington-based Center for
Responsive Politics, which tracks such donations.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee received
$100,000 from Enron. (Like several politicians from both parties, the
committee has sought to distance itself from the company by sending the
donation to relief efforts set up to help Enron employees.)</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic beneficiaries of the company's giving included Sen.
Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, chairman of the panel that is leading
the Senate's Enron investigation. He received $2,000 from Enron and
$4,500 from its accounting firm, Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   To the dismay of some Democrats, Lieberman so far has taken a more
measured, low-key approach to the investigation than the Republican
chairman of the House Commerce Committee, W.J. "Billy" Tauzin of
Louisiana, who from 1989 to 2001 received about $6,400 in contributions
from Enron and its employees.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, some political strategists argue that the GOP faces
bigger political risks as the Enron story unfolds because the controversy
fuels Democratic attempts to tar Republicans as cozy with wealthy
business interests.</TE>
<TE>   "The main political damage will be to reinforce the image that
Republicans had: that the GOP is in bed with the big boys," said Larry
Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   Enron already has made its way into the lexicon of Democrats,
especially those with presidential ambitions, as a metaphor for
Republican policies they oppose.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle recently charged that President Bush is "Enronizing the
budget" by pushing tax cuts, especially those aimed at helping the
wealthy. Daschle and other Democrats say the tax cuts would undercut the
future solvency of popular programs such as Social Security.</TE>
<TE>   "We are taking the same approach Enron used in sapping retirement
funds and providing them to those at the very top," Daschle said. "We are
taking money from Social Security, taking money from Medicare and putting
it in the form of tax cuts to those who are at the very top of the income
scale."</TE>
<TE>   However the politics plays out, the Enron controversy already is
reshaping policy debates.</TE>
<TE>   A few months ago, for example, few outside the accounting industry
paid attention when conflict-of-interest rules were proposed to prohibit
accounting firms from doing consulting work for clients they also audit.
Those rules were blocked by the powerful accounting lobby, with the help
of lawmakers from both parties.</TE>
<TE>   Now that accounting irregularities seem to be part of Enron's fall,
lawmakers are suddenly more interested in the issue of auditor
independence. Sens. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) and Jon Corzine
(D-N.J.) introduced legislation aimed at ensuring such independence,
saying it was needed to prevent repeats of Enron's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   On the pension front, lawmakers are discussing ways to address
problems highlighted by the Enron case. A huge chunk of the retirement
savings for Enron employees was invested in company stock and so was
decimated when the stock value plummeted. And while Enron executives were
selling stock before the company went belly up, the rank-and-file workers
could not.</TE>
<TE>   "Perhaps the only good thing to come from the Enron debacle is that it
helped expose a little-remarked sea change in America's retirement
system," said House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) in a
speech last week calling for a new pension system that allows employees
to carry benefits from job to job.</TE>
<TE>   Corzine and Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) have introduced a bill to
set a 20% limit on company stock in retirement plans. A House version of
the bill would set an even lower cap of 10%. Such limits are expected to
be opposed vigorously by employers and business groups.</TE>
<TE>   While many proposals to increase government regulation of pensions and
accounting are coming from Democrats, GOP consultant McInturff said he
would urge Republicans to actively respond to the Enron case.</TE>
<TE>   "I would, as a Republican, try to do two or three very aggressive
things to explain what I had learned from this and why it would never
happen again."</TE>

<DL>SHORE ACRES, Texas
</DL>
<LD>Strung from the yardarm of an old wooden sailboat, the flags were
at half-mast Saturday at the Houston Yacht Club.</LD>
<LD>   One of the members, former Enron Corp. executive J. Clifford Baxter,
had been found shot to death in his new Mercedes-Benz the day before near
his home in Sugar Land, an affluent Houston suburb. On Saturday, the
Harris County medical examiner ruled the death a suicide, but Sugar Land
police said they will continue their investigation into the circumstances
of the case, which came amid mounting questions about Enron's finances.</LD>
<LD>   "We are not in any way saying we disagree with the medical examiner's
findings," said Police Chief Ernest Taylor. "We are simply saying we want
to make sure that we cross all the Ts and dot all the I's in order to be
absolutely sure that nothing is overlooked in this investigation."</LD>
<TE>   A CNBC television report Friday said a suicide note found by police
cited Baxter's disturbance over the Enron debacle and his concerns he
would have to testify against colleagues, but police Saturday declined
for a second day to release the note.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, Baxter, 43, had been a regular weekend figure at the
105-year-old yacht club in this modest Galveston Bay shore community
adjacent to the heavily industrial Houston Ship Channel. His 72-foot
Viking power boat Tranquility Base was docked in slip No. 38, surrounded
by smaller, sleek sailboats.</TE>
<TE>   As the boat's name implied, friends said this was the place that
Baxter came to get away from the pressures of Enron. He was vice chairman
of the company until his resignation in May. Enron Vice President Sherron
S. Watkins had identified Baxter in an August memo to then-Chairman
Kenneth L. Lay, saying Baxter was one of several executives with serious
reservations about the company's accounting maneuvers.</TE>
<TE>   "When he came here on weekends," recalled yacht club general manager
Ross Tuckwiller, "it was always with family and friends. I can't remember
ever seeing him with business types."</TE>
<TE>   Yacht club members had gathered Friday night in the upstairs bar of
the two-story pink stucco clubhouse and tried to make sense of Baxter's
death. Mounted on one wall of the clubhouse was the Baxter family's
signal flag, which was designed by the executive and his two children.
The triangular flag shows a B note surrounded by four stars and four
quarter notes, representing the guitar-playing Baxter's interest in
music.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the club members remembered last seeing Baxter on Dec. 19, the
night of the club's Christmas party. Some thought his salt-and-pepper
hair had turned whiter, but most thought he seemed in good spirits,
particularly after the precipitous decline of his former company.</TE>
<TE>   "He seemed happy and jovial but concerned about the Enron thing," said
club commodore Chuck Buckner, a Houston accountant. "He was concerned
about the bad publicity the company was getting. He worried that the
reputation of the company he helped build was in tatters."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the Enron troubles, Tuckwiller said Baxter recently traded in
Tranquility Base for another, more powerful boat. "He said he ordered a
new boat with great big engines capable of 40 knots on the open sea,"
Tuckwiller said.</TE>
<TE>   Friends dropped by the Baxter home throughout the day Saturday to
offer consolation.</TE>

<HD>Economic Theory Cited in Murder Rate</HD>
<DH>Law: Study says pardoning those convicted of homicide may encourage
more killing by lowering the social cost of the crime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MORIN</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's a new and surprising complication in the increasingly
complicated debate over the death penalty: Pardons kill.</LD>
<LD>   At least that's the implication of a recent study by H. Naci Mocan,
chairman of the economics department at the University of Colorado at
Denver. His analysis of death sentences and state homicide rates suggests
that pardoning convicted killers leads to an increase in murders.</LD>
<LD>   Mocan also found that the murder rate fell as executions increased--a
finding certain to be embraced by those who argue that the death penalty
serves as a deterrent to murder. It's also just as certain to be
scrutinized by death penalty opponents.</LD>
<TE>   The pardon effect is actually a matter of simple market economics,
asserts Mocan, who is also a research associate at the National Bureau of
Economic Research in Cambridge, Mass. Mocan's explanation: Pardons reduce
the chances that convicted killers will pay the ultimate price for
committing murder. Thus, he says, a pardon "represents a decrease in the
cost of committing the crime," and as his study shows, is accompanied by
an increase in the homicide rate. Conversely, if you increase the "cost"
of committing murder by executing a larger share of convicted killers,
then economic theory suggests the murder rate will fall, Mocan said.</TE>
<TE>   Mocan and graduate student R. Kaj Gittings analyzed data collected by
the Justice Department on all 6,143 death sentences handed out between
1977 and 1997 in the United States. During that time, 432 convicted
killers were executed while 123 were pardoned, either through a grant of
clemency or a commutation of their sentence.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers combined this data with detailed information from each
state where the murders occurred. Those variables included the state's
per capita income, unemployment rate, percentage of young adults in the
population, racial composition, infant mortality rate, proportion of
residents who live in large cities and even per capita alcohol
consumption--all factors known to be associated with homicide rates.</TE>
<TE>   They concluded that each execution "decreases [the number of]
homicides by five to six, while three additional pardons generate 1 to
1.5 additional homicides" beyond the number of murders that would have
been expected to occur in the state during the following year. Their
findings appear in a NBER working paper published in December.</TE>
<TE>   Mocan suspects some potential killers approach their crimes in much
the same way that the average consumer approaches a major purchase:
Ultimately, both the buyer and the killer base their final decision on
available information.</TE>
<TE>   "Executions make headlines, and pardons make headlines as well," he
said. "The question is whether the headlines in the media and other
informal channels are powerful enough to affect behavior. The answer is
evidently yes, because that is exactly what we are finding."</TE>
<TE>   Mocan realizes proponents of capital punishment will seize upon the
study to buttress their case for legal executions. The idea of his study
being used in that manner gives him pause.</TE>
<TE>   "There are still a number of unresolved issues regarding imposition of
the death penalty," he said. In his paper, he notes that racial and
gender disparities in sentencing for capital crimes raise troublesome
questions about capital punishment.</TE>
<TE>   Does he personally support the death penalty? The question clearly
makes Mocan uncomfortable.</TE>
<TE>   "I do believe that the death penalty is a deterrent," he answered,
choosing his words with care. "But I cannot really say I am in favor of
the death penalty because of all these issues, from questions of
discrimination to fundamental ethical issues surrounding the death
penalty."</TE>

<HD>Tennessee Enclave Investing in Its Future</HD>
<DH>Education: In a bid to hang on to their best resource, taxpayers
pay for high school seniors to attend local community college.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUNCAN MANSFIELD</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>KINGSPORT, Tenn.
</DL>
<LD>Aspiring computer programmer Jacob Matney always planned to go to
college. He just didn't know how to pay for it.</LD>
<LD>   "I didn't have the best grades, so I didn't get those kind of
scholarships," said Jacob, whose high B-plus average couldn't crack the
top 10 of his graduating class at Sullivan North High School.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't have any health problems or anything like that, so I didn't
get those scholarships. I was just in the middle, where I got close to
nothing."</LD>
<TE>   But in an act of civic benevolence never before seen in Tennessee--or
apparently elsewhere in the United States--his hometown came up with an
answer.</TE>
<TE>   Kingsport and Sullivan County, a farming and manufacturing community
of 144,000 near the Virginia line, has pledged up to $250,000 a year to
send every high school graduate to the local community college. The money
will come from the governments' general funds.</TE>
<TE>   Kingsport Mayor Jeanette Blazier said the idea behind the Educate &amp;
Grow scholarship program, which started last fall, was to reduce a "brain
drain" on the economy when bright young people go away to college and
never come back.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as I know this is unique," said Norma Kent, spokeswoman for
the Washington, D.C.-based American Assn. of Community Colleges. "What
they have done is admirable. It's wonderful, it truly is. I hope it sets
a precedent."</TE>
<TE>   Private foundations sometimes provide large blocks of scholarships,
and local governments sometimes offer a handful of taxpayer-financed
scholarships to top students.</TE>
<TE>   But Kingsport and Sullivan County are offering a tuition-free ride to
Northeast State Technical Community College--worth some $1,600 a year--to
every student graduating from the county's six high schools, as well as
qualifying home-schooled students.</TE>
<TE>   For some, it will lead to a two-year associate degree in one of some
45 fields. For others, it will mean credit transferable to a four-year
school, such as nearby East Tennessee State University in Johnson City.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is fantastic," said Charles Manning, chancellor of the
Tennessee Board of Regents, which oversees 182,000 students at six state
universities, 14 community colleges and 26 technology centers.</TE>
<TE>   In Tennessee, where tuition has risen 72% since 1993, college has
become unaffordable for as many as half of its low-income students,
according to a recent study by the Lumina Foundation for Education.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people just turn off when they see the sticker price,"
Manning said. "The advantage of this program is that it takes that away."</TE>
<TE>   In the fall, 103 students, including Jacob, enrolled at Northeast
State under the Educate &amp; Grow program. Seventy-two returned for the
spring semester--a higher-than-normal retention rate.</TE>
<TE>   The requirements are few: Students must take at least 12 hours of
classes a semester and maintain a "C" average. They must begin within 15
months of graduating high school and finish their 60-hour degree within
three calendar years.</TE>
<TE>   The scholarship won't pay for remedial classes; students have to pay
for those themselves. Four students did so last fall.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect we will have more people doing this next year because the
word is spreading," Northeast State President Bill Locke said.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Welmaker, executive director of the Kingsport Economic
Development Partnership, said the community's commitment is long-term and
without dissent.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is a major step forward in recognizing that 12 years
really isn't enough anymore. You have got to have an education beyond
traditional K-12 to get any kind of job these days."</TE>
<TE>   Jacob's mother, Karen Matney, a librarian who also is rearing a
9-year-old daughter, called the scholarship a godsend for her son.</TE>
<TE>   "He has big dreams and, with this, we hope they will come true."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE
</DL>
<LD>King Herod, the bloodthirsty Judean ruler who reputedly tried to
kill the infant Jesus, died an excruciating death, brought on by kidney
disease and finished off by gangrene, a medical sleuth said.</LD>
<LD>   Fournier's gangrene, rare today, probably killed Herod, said Dr. Jan
Hirschmann of the University of Washington medical school, who examined
Herod's case history. The disease would have killed the king in a week or
less.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a very unpleasant way to die," said Dr. Philip Mackowiak, the
director of the annual Historical Clinicopathological Conference at the
University of Maryland medical school.</LD>
<TE>   At the conference, doctors apply their diagnostic skills to historical
figures whose deaths have not been satisfactorily explained. Previous
conferences concluded rabies killed Edgar Allan Poe and that the Roman
emperor Claudius died after eating poisonous mushrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Richardson, a religion professor at the University of Toronto,
found the description of Herod's ailments in the writings of 1st century
historian Flavius Josephus.</TE>
<TE>   Before his death in 4 BC, Herod suffered intense itching, painful
intestinal problems, breathlessness, fever, swelling in the feet,
convulsions and, finally, genital gangrene.</TE>
<TE>   The symptom of itching led Hirschmann to conclude Herod suffered from
kidney disease.</TE>
<TE>   Many have speculated that Herod had gonorrhea, but Hirschmann said
there's no evidence to support that. Debunking such popular theories is
the point of an intensive, clinical approach to Herod's death, Mackowiak
said.</TE>
<TE>   Kidney disease may also explain some of Herod's brutal acts, including
the executions of several family members. The untreated accumulation of
bodily wastes can result in mental illness.</TE>
<TE>   According to religious tradition, Herod, fearing the coming of a
Messiah after Jesus' birth, ordered the execution of infant boys in
Bethlehem, forcing Mary, Joseph and the infant to flee to Egypt.</TE>

<HD>Being All They Can Be, but With Individuality</HD>
<DH>Style: Adapting to changes in fashion, the Army will allow shaved
heads, braids, cornrows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEAN GILL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>For the first time in a decade, the Army is revising its dress
code, allowing more color, style and convenience into all that soldiers
can be.</LD>
<LD>   Front and center is the issue of hairstyles.</LD>
<LD>   For male recruits, the buzz cut has always been de rigueur. Now the
Army is permitting shaved heads for men, and cornrows and braids for
women. Dyed hair is fine too--as long as the hue isn't blue, fire-engine
red, orange, purple, green or some other hair color not found in nature.</LD>
<TE>   This is still the Army, after all, so regulations still rule. No
dreadlocks, and certain tattoos and body piercings are restricted.</TE>
<TE>   Revised Army Regulation 670-1, the service's dress code and appearance
policy, also takes into consideration soldiers' increased use of cell
phones and pagers. The changes would not go into effect until Secretary
of the Army Thomas E. White signs off on them, which is expected sometime
in the next two months.</TE>
<TE>   Army officials say that, just as fashion trends in the civilian world
evolve into mainstream culture, the Army must adapt as well.</TE>
<TE>   "We do try to keep up with major changes in how people look," Army
spokeswoman Martha Rudd said. "But we keep up slowly."</TE>
<TE>   The changes will apply to officers and enlisted personnel of the Army,
Army National Guard and Army Reserve and will incorporate the soldiers'
new black berets, introduced in June to unify the Army and mark its move
to more specialized operations.</TE>
<TE>   As for hair, the proposal attempts to explain why certain styles still
are not allowed.</TE>
<TE>   "Cornrows and braids are actually very good hairdos for a female
soldier," Rudd said. "They are very practical and easy to maintain, easy
to wash."</TE>
<TE>   But dreadlocks are deemed less practical and less mainstream. Length
also is an issue, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "No one in the Army can wear long hair," she said. As for short
hair--or no hair--Rudd pointed out that "shaved heads have gotten popular
in the Army and in general society. They're easy to keep clean and keep
cool in a hot environment."</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposal, women will be able to polish their nails as long
as they avoid purple, gold, blue, black, white, bright red, khaki and
two-tone hues. Women may have nails no longer than a quarter of an inch
from the fingertip; men must trim their nails to the tip of the finger.</TE>
<TE>   Also, corrective contact lenses may be worn, but tinted contacts
aren't allowed.</TE>
<TE>   The regulation allows soldiers to carry one electronic device, limited
by size and color, and prohibits devices unnecessary for official duties.</TE>
<TE>   However, Rudd said the regulation applied only to devices worn on a
soldier's body. Additional devices could be carried in a backpack or a
purse.</TE>
<TE>   "The Army wants soldiers to have all the devices they need to do their
jobs," Rudd said.</TE>
<TE>   When in the field, soldiers may soon be allowed to wear camouflage
water packs, at the discretion of their commanders. Also known as a
"camelback," it is basically a water-filled backpack with a long straw.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Phillip Carter, a National Guardsman and former active-duty
officer, said the camelback might be the most welcome change--something
soldiers have been asking to use for a while. "The single biggest problem
out in the field is the lack of hydration," he said. "The camelback works
amazingly at keeping you cool and hydrated."</TE>
<TE>   Carter said that, while Army leadership might be resistant to some of
the changes, young soldiers are encouraged by the slight loosening of
some restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   But the troops just may want even more changes.</TE>
<TE>   Carter noted that the Marines' new combat uniform, which they will
begin wearing Friday, features a digital camouflage design.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of folks are looking at the Marine Corps with a lot of
jealousy," he said. "There's a sense that when the Army wants to
transform, they went to the black beret, but when the Marines want to
transform, they went to new high-tech uniforms."</TE>

<HD>Town Symphony Strikes a Chord With Residents</HD>
<DH>Culture: In Port Angeles, Wash., pie sales have a place in
fund-raising effort. Musicians' commitment is also upper-crust.</DH>

<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>PORT ANGELES, Wash.
</DL>
<LD>By day, Kim Bowlby jockeys a school bus over slick, winding,
rain-forest roads.</LD>
<LD>   By night--on those very special nights--she dresses in elegant black,
takes up her B-flat trumpet and joins her volunteer colleagues in the
Port Angeles Symphony Orchestra.</LD>
<LD>   "I love it. I don't know what I'd do without it," said Bowlby, a
25-year veteran of the community orchestra, which since 1932 has brought
"The Greatest Music of the Greatest Composers" to an Olympic Peninsula
town more closely identified with logging and heavy industry than
classical music.</LD>
<TE>   "The community support is really miraculous," said conductor Nico
Snel, the former conductor of the Seattle Philharmonic, now in his 18th
Port Angeles season.</TE>
<TE>   "When I found out how much support there was here, and how willing
these people were to serve on committees and do things, actually roll up
their sleeves and go to work and make things happen--I haven't regretted
it for a moment," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Port Angeles, with a population of 19,000, is one of the smallest
cities in the nation to support a full orchestra. It's also one of the
more remote from a university or population center--a 30-minute ferry
ride and 2 1/2-hour drive from Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Snel acknowledged he faces some challenges foreign to conductors in
Seattle, Boston or New York.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, for instance, they don't sell pies to balance the books.</TE>
<TE>   Funds for the Port Angeles 85-member orchestra come from an annual
auction of donated art--where the pies also are a featured item--and from
community concerts and other events, in addition to donations from
individual patrons.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to raise approximately $175,000 every year to take care of
our financial needs, and by golly, we're doing that," Snel said.</TE>
<TE>   John Sparks, spokesman for the American Symphony Orchestra League in
New York, which represents 900 symphonies, said the success of symphonies
like Port Angeles' "speaks to some kind of need for people, regardless of
their actual education level or their previous exposure to this kind of
music. There's a need to go to the same place at the same time with other
people and listen to this experience."</TE>
<TE>   "We get a lot of warmth and positive feedback from the audience," said
bassist Mary Chamberlain, a third-generation Port Angeles resident. "They
enjoy it as much as we do."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the musicians in Port Angeles didn't exactly train at the
Juilliard School.</TE>
<TE>   Chamberlain, a 42-year-old who has been playing bass for three years,
learned from a local music teacher.</TE>
<TE>   Nick Burnette, 23, also a native, earned his trombone chops playing in
the Marine Corps band at Cherry Point Air Station in Havelock, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   "In the Marine band, everything is really brassy and edgy," he said.
"They're all marches, and they're all in your face. In the symphony, the
brass is supposed to be felt and not heard. I see a certain note and I
want to blast . . . it, but I can't."</TE>
<TE>   Other players have decades of experience, including one retiree who
played with the Cleveland Symphony.</TE>
<TE>   At a recent Monday night rehearsal, Snel ran about 65 members, ages 14
to 74, through their paces at the Port Angeles High School Auditorium,
which doubles as the symphony's concert hall.</TE>
<TE>   "Can I have the first violins please? It's tee dah dah dee," he sang
during one of several instructional timeouts.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to partially get your butts out of the seats on 'bubba bub
bub bum,' " he added, jabbing the air with his baton for emphasis.</TE>
<TE>   Snel, who conducted both the Seattle Philharmonic and Port Angeles
Symphony until 1995, was unfailingly patient in rehearsal.</TE>
<TE>   "You're dealing with an all-volunteer orchestra here," he said. "They
put in such an incredible amount of time that, even though sometimes the
artist in you says you've got to yell, you don't."</TE>
<TE>   Seventeen-year-old Sharon Talbot already had logged a full day of high
school classes and two hours of practice with the North Olympic Youth
Symphony.</TE>
<TE>   "I eat in the parking lot before rehearsal" with the Port Angeles
Symphony, she said. "Monday nights are definitely a big commitment for
me."</TE>
<TE>   Bowlby, who supplements her bus-driving income working as a speech
therapy assistant for the Cape Flattery School District west of Port
Angeles, travels 100 miles round-trip for rehearsal.</TE>
<TE>   Sixty-year-old trombonist Jay Williams is blind and unable to
sight-read music. He learns his parts by practicing along with rehearsal
tapes at home or downloading them from the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Principal clarinetist Otto Slehofer, 74, a retired highway engineer,
is a 50-year symphony stalwart who has no plans of retiring soon.</TE>
<TE>   Many members' involvement goes beyond rehearsals and the half-dozen or
so major performances per season, to international touring during the
summer.</TE>
<TE>   The smaller touring symphony has performed in recent years in Vietnam,
Thailand, Greece and Peru. In 1996, the Port Angeles Symphony was the
first from the United States to play in Bulgaria.</TE>
<TE>   Bowlby said players' fund-raising efforts for the trips have included
"picking up garbage along roads, playing in small ensembles for events,
in grocery stores. I played at Safeway at 4 o'clock in the morning."</TE>

<HD>In Key Court Case, Slave Tested State's Commitment to Freedom</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>CECILIA RASMUSSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amid the din of traffic and the buzz of busy sidewalks,
brown-baggers take refuge in a vest-pocket park behind the Bradbury
Building. A timeline at the park's entrance memorializes a former slave
who had compassion for the poor, turned poverty into profit and helped to
rescue 13 others from slavery.</LD>
<LD>   In 1849, as slavery was wrenching the nation and California was
preparing to become a state, delegates to a statehood convention took a
bold stand and wrote in the state Constitution: "Neither slavery nor
involuntary servitude unless for the punishment of crimes shall ever be
tolerated in this state."</LD>
<LD>   Under the law, any slave brought into the state was automatically
free. However, if the former slave later voluntarily returned to a slave
state, he or she would once again become a slave. The law added that
anyone persuading a black person by false promises or misrepresentation
to leave the security and freedom of California would be guilty of
kidnapping. This was how Biddy Mason became a free woman and ultimately a
famous one.</LD>
<TE>   She was born a slave in Georgia in 1818 and named Bridget. She was
just an infant when she was sold to a slave owner in Mississippi, where
her new owners began to call her Biddy. When she turned 18, she was
presented as a wedding gift to Robert Marion Smith and his bride,
Rebecca.</TE>
<TE>   Biddy became an expert in livestock, herbal medicine, nursing and
midwifery, skills that later enabled her to earn a living as a free
woman. She bore three daughters in 10 years; the younger two were
fathered by her owner, Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after Biddy's youngest was born, the Smith family, which had
converted to the Mormon religion, joined a wagon train and headed for
Utah. The wagon train's population was 56 white men, women and children
and 34 slaves.</TE>
<TE>   While others rode in wagons or on horseback, Biddy, a woman of
masculine strength, carried her nursing baby on her back, as she and her
other daughters, ages 10 and 4, trekked behind the wagon dust for seven
months, herding 300 livestock as well as keeping the six Smith children
from straying. Biddy played midwife to both women and animals giving
birth.</TE>
<TE>   Three years after their arrival in Salt Lake City, the Smiths and
their slaves were among 437 pioneers who trekked 800 miles across deep
desert sand, making the Mormon faith's first journey to San Bernardino,
where they set up a trading post and missionary church in 1851.</TE>
<TE>   Biddy befriended a number of free blacks who settled in the area,
including Charles and Elizabeth Rowan, who would be instrumental in
securing her freedom. Biddy and the others were unsure of the California
law that made them free. Smith, whom they trusted, told them a different
story.</TE>
<TE>   When Smith's wife died, he grew dissatisfied with the Mormon Church
and its colony. Fearing that he would lose his slaves to a growing
freedom movement, he decided to go to Texas, where slave-owning was still
legal. He lied to Biddy and the others that they would be just as free in
Texas as they were in California. Although Biddy felt uneasy about the
move, she and the others followed him first to Los Angeles, for supplies.
Smith, not wanting to bring attention to his slave caravan, camped in
Santa Monica Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the freed slave Elizabeth Rowan, who distrusted
Smith, sent word to Los Angeles County Sheriff Frank Dewitt that Biddy
and the other slaves needed help. Dewitt, aided by wealthy black
businessman Robert Owens, rode to their camp and served Smith a writ of
habeas corpus. He was ordered to appear in court for "persuading and
enticing and seducing persons of color to go out of the state of
California."</TE>
<TE>   For their safety, the sheriff and Owens escorted the slaves to the
jail in Los Angeles. There, they were kept under the watchful eye of
Deputy Frank Carpenter, who would later testify about the slaves' fear of
their master.</TE>
<TE>   News of what was happening spread throughout the town of about 2,000,
only a dozen or so of whom were black. For three days, U.S. District
Judge Benjamin Hayes' courtroom was the focus of the whole settlement.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 19, 1856, Biddy, leader of the group of 14 slaves, walked into
the courtroom with her court-appointed attorney. Smith, represented by
attorney Alonzo Thomas, argued that the black women and children were
free, "members of his family" who wanted to go to Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Barred from speaking in court because she was black, Biddy was heard
nonetheless after Hayes invited her and two other witnesses into his
chambers.</TE>
<TE>   "I have always done what I have been told to do," she said. "I always
feared this trip to Texas since I first heard of it. Mr. Smith told me I
would be just as free in Texas as here," Biddy told Hayes.</TE>
<TE>   That evening, after court adjourned, Smith's overseer, Hartwell
Cottrell, tried to induce two of the black children into going to Texas
with him. The judge learned of it and signed a warrant for Cottrell's
arrest on suspicion of attempted kidnapping. But Cottrell was already one
step ahead of the law, heading out of town.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, Biddy's attorney astonished the courtroom by slipping a
note to the judge saying he was quitting. The angry Hayes said: "No
attorney can desert his clients at his own pleasure without good reason."
He put the lawyer on the witness stand and heard him testify that he had
been threatened and paid $100 by "unnamed persons" to drop the case.</TE>
<TE>   Smith had had enough. Afraid that bribery and kidnapping charges would
be added to the others, he left town that night.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, Smith was a no-show and Hayes declared him guilty of
lying and ordered him to pay court costs. More significantly, Hayes
declared, "All of the said persons of color are entitled to their freedom
and are free forever."</TE>
<TE>   The court's decision was hailed throughout Los Angeles. The Los
Angeles Star, in its Feb. 2, 1856, issue, printed the full text of Hayes'
opinion under the heading "Suit for Freedom."</TE>
<TE>   (Biddy--who chose the surname Mason for reasons that are unclear--and
the others had won a timely escape from bondage. The following year, the
U.S. Supreme Court ruled, in the infamous 1857 Dred Scott decision, that
a slave was not a person, but property, and that a slave's residence in
free territory did not make that slave free.)</TE>
<TE>   Mason and her daughters were taken in by Owens, the wealthy black man,
and his family. Soon after, Mason's second daughter, Ann, died, and her
eldest daughter, Ellen, married the Owenses' only son, Charles.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who had followed the trial closely was Dr. John Strother
Griffin, a transplanted Southerner who offered Mason work as a midwife
and nurse at $2.50 per day, a good wage at a time when black women
commanded much lower pay.</TE>
<TE>   By 1866, she had delivered hundreds of babies and nursed many
Angelenos through a smallpox epidemic. She had saved almost every penny
she earned, and bought a $250 chunk of property at 331 Spring St., where
she built a house.</TE>
<TE>   It was in her home that the First African Methodist Episcopal Church,
the city's first black congregation, was organized in 1872. Thirty years
later, the congregation's building at 8th Street and Towne Avenue became
the city's first black church. Mason's home was a longtime refuge for
stranded and needy settlers.</TE>
<TE>   While Mason continued to invest in property, she paid the annual
property taxes for local churches, and paid a minister's salary. She
packed food baskets and took them to the jail, where she brought cheer
and prayerful hope to the prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   In 1884, a rainstorm turned the Los Angeles River into a raging
torrent. Homes were swept away, and many people were left with nothing.
Mason, who had recently sold a lot for $2,800, left a standing order at a
Spring Street grocery store to give free food to any flood victims--black
or white--who needed it.</TE>
<TE>   Although she was for a time a living legend, Mason was soon forgotten
after she died at age 73, in 1891. It wasn't until 1988, almost a century
later, that city officials and members of the AME church she helped to
establish placed a headstone on her unmarked grave at Evergreen Cemetery
in Boyle Heights. Her descendants proudly maintain her legacy, still
cherishing a copy of the 1856 court decision, written in longhand and
signed by Hayes. They remember the lesson she passed down:</TE>
<TE>  "If you hold your hand closed, nothing good can come in. The open hand
is blessed, for it gives in abundance, even as it receives."</TE>

<HD>Lewis, Clark Route Ready for Close-Up</HD>
<DH>History: A photographer is capturing images of what the explorers'
trail looks like nearly 200 years after their journey.</DH>

<DL>WARRENTON, Ore.
</DL>
<LD>The explorers were exhausted and hot when the Lewis and Clark
expedition came up the Missouri River near what is now Bellevue, Neb., on
July 22, 1804.</LD>
<LD>   "Set out verry early with a view of Getting to Some Situation above in
time to take equal altitudes and Observations as well as one Calculated
to make our party Comfortabl in a situation where they Could recive the
benifit of a Shade," William Clark wrote in his journal.</LD>
<LD>   The idea of some R&amp;R there apparently caught on. Today, a house with a
swimming pool overlooks the spot where they are believed to have camped.</LD>
<TE>   In a project that has spanned five years, University of North Texas
photography professor Brent Phelps is retracing the Lewis and Clark
trail, photographing what it looks like today.</TE>
<TE>   The explorers would be hard-pressed to recognize most of it, although
Phelps says a few spots appear relatively undisturbed.</TE>
<TE>   The Amon Carter Museum at the Fort Worth campus will publish a book of
his work for the Lewis and Clark bicentennial in 2004-06, and two
traveling shows of Phelps' pictures will be taken to museums across the
country.</TE>
<TE>   Phelps says it is the first undertaking of its kind.</TE>
<TE>   "The previous projects tried to give it a 19th-century twist," he
said, attempting to show what the explorers actually saw. "It will be a
unique contemporary document, combining photography with historical text.
I'd like to see it done again, 100 years from now."</TE>
<TE>   He noted that Olin Wheeler retraced the route during the Lewis and
Clark centennial 100 years ago. There were some pictures in the two
volumes he published, but it was mostly a verbal account.</TE>
<TE>   "Very few sites today look the way Lewis and Clark found them," he
said. "There are some. It depends on how closely you look."</TE>
<TE>   His photos run the gamut from the relatively pristine Two Medicine
Fight site in Montana, where a skirmish with the Blackfoot tribe was the
only armed conflict during the expedition, to the top of the U.S. West
building in Omaha, where he shot down on a former Lewis and Clark
campsite.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the Two Medicine Fight site looks untouched, he said, "If
you look closely enough you can see some cultural evidence."</TE>
<TE>   The Mandan Indian village near present-day Washburn, N.D., where the
explorers spent the winter of 1804-05, has a power plant nearby.</TE>
<TE>   A site west of Billings, Mont., is occupied by Oscar's Dreamland, an
amusement park complete with elephant rides.</TE>
<TE>   The portage route around the falls near present-day Great Falls,
Mont., goes through Malmstrom Air Force Base, which houses a
helicopter-rescue unit.</TE>
<TE>   And the Missouri River, home and highway for the Voyage of Discovery
until the explorers neared its source in 1805, has moved over the
decades, Phelps said, sometimes by a couple of miles, leaving some places
where the explorers walked and camped under water.</TE>
<TE>   The most visible evidence of Lewis and Clark is at Pompey's Pillar,
Mont., where Clark added his name to the Indian petroglyphs on July 25,
1806, on the voyage home. It has been preserved, and Phelps photographed
it.</TE>
<TE>   "This rock, which I shall call Pompey's Tower, is 200 feet high and
400 paces in secumphrance and only axcessable on one Side," Clark wrote
in his journal, which paid little attention to modern rules of spelling
or capitalization. "The nativs have ingraved on the face of this rock the
figures of animals near which I marked my name and the day of the month &amp;
year."</TE>
<TE>   Phelps said he became interested in the explorers while on a summer
trip through Montana 15 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I had seen references to Lewis and Clark, but I didn't pay any
attention to them," he said. But roadside interpretive signs eventually
piqued his interest, and he realized the bicentennial was approaching.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a second-grade understanding of Lewis and Clark," he said. "I
did some research to see what had been done."</TE>
<TE>   He said he was unaware of Stephen Ambrose's best-selling book about
the expedition, "Undaunted Courage," until he got the idea for his
project. Phelps now travels with unabridged copies of the explorers'
journals and a Linhof Technorama panoramic camera.</TE>
<TE>   He has taught photography for 21 years, but when he's not teaching,
he's on the road with the Lewis and Clark project.</TE>
<TE>   Phelps returned to Texas to teach in early January and plans to return
to the Northwest next fall to complete his shooting.</TE>
<TE>   The book and exhibits are to be ready by the fall of 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Phelps said that even since he began the project he has seen changes
in some of the places he revisited.</TE>
<TE>   "Probably for me, the project is never going to end," he said.</TE>

<DH>ME TIMES THREE:  A Novel, By Alex Witchel, Alfred A. Knopf:
310 pp., $22</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK ROZZO</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>American first novels emerge from every demographic nook and cranny.
They're written by the precocious and the infirm, cranked out by the
high-minded and the lowbrow, and they're the holy grail for workshop
babies, with their faculty-condoned prose. They're also produced by
farm wives between harvests, by copy writers and junior editors, by
the occasional drug-addled runaway and, perhaps most Americanly, by
improbable jacks-of-all-trades, whose jacket bios contain
combinations of the roguish signifiers "dishwasher," "logger," "truck
driver," "blackjack dealer," "minor league ballplayer."</LD>
<LD>   Despite the taxonomy-defying variety, two distinct first-novel
genres gained major momentum in the 1990s: the farce on the hazards
of modern dating, almost always written by women in the their late
20s to mid-30s (and best exemplified by Helen Fielding's mega-popular
"Bridget Jones's Diary"), and the farce on the hazards of the modern
workplace, almost always written by men in their late 20s to mid-30s
and exemplified by a number of books, including Ted Heller's "Slab
Rat" and Maxx Barry's "Syrup."</LD>
<TE>   The second genre is admittedly more obscure to the general reader
but no less prolific. Some may argue that it should rightly be
classified as a subset of the first genre: After all, Bridget Jones
toiled in misery at a second-rate publishing firm, champed at the bit
for a chance to shine, was thwarted by her surroundings and
eventually found a way to get back at her old boss. This is,
essentially, the outline of every book belonging to the second
category.</TE>
<TE>   It's also the shape of "Me Times Three," a first novel from the
New York Times' able-bodied Style reporter Alex Witchel who has come
to these genres just as they threaten to wear out their welcome.
Witchel, to her credit, has managed to infuse them with energy and
charm, creating a story that's as affecting as it is just plain fun.</TE>
<TE>   Witchel's dating and working heroine is Sandra Berlin, a nice
suburban Jewish girl of the late 1980s--that decade of the
moment--toiling away at Manhattan's Jolie!, "a magazine most
frequently read under the hair dryer." Sandy's superior at Jolie! is
a witchy, unimaginative impediment to her career goals, making
Sandy's days of story meetings and rewrites a living hell. For Sandy,
succor comes in the form of long-term beau John Buckingham Ross,
alarmingly known as Bucky, a jocky WASP hopelessly devoted to her
despite a few limitations: "the only topics he seemed to warm to ...
were real estate values and Range Rover prices."</TE>
<TE>   On the surface, Sandy and Bucky--happily engaged--are the perfect
Manhattan couple: She with her little publishing job and he with his
promising Wall Street career; she with her contentious, academic
Jewish family and he with his staid white-bread parents and their
"cottage" on Nantucket. It's enough to make Sandy fantasize about
staying home and writing children's stories while Bucky brings home
the Christmas bonuses and stock options.</TE>
<TE>   Witchel dots this novel with Sandy's literary efforts, oddball
fairy tales that have dreamlike connections to the book's goings-on.
If slightly interruptive, they point up the fact that "Me Times
Three" is really a fairy tale, cleaving close to the genre's
conventions of symmetry and magic, of childlike wonder and the cruel
hazards of experience. Just as we're cozying up to the idea of Sandy
and Bucky forever, Sandy discovers that Bucky is also engaged to
another woman--a heavily cantilevered blond from the office. And,
soon after, Sandy finds out that he's engaged to yet another--this
one smart and mousy.</TE>
<TE>   "Me Times Three"--the title--refers to Sandy's crushing
realization that she has become but one facet of her fiance's mad,
misogynistic attempt to create an ideal spouse-to-be out of three
women. It also alludes to Sandy's own three-pronged relationship to
the trio of men who come to dominate Witchel's increasingly complex
depiction of love, trust and betrayal. Besides Bucky, now exiled
despite his desperate phone calls, there's Paul Romano, Sandy's gay
best friend. With its lively banter and easy affection, Sandy and
Paul's relationship is the polar opposite of Sandy and Bucky's
measured caution. Paul is "Me Times Three's" flashiest candidate for
handsome prince, but there is the inconvenient issue of sexual
orientation and then the later tragedy when this energetic man is
found to have AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   Bachelor No. 3 first appears, appropriately, as a career
opportunity. Mark Lewis is a hotshot art critic whom Sandy woos to
Jolie!'s superficial pages. (Bonus: He's Jewish.) Together, they head
down to Philadelphia to work on a story, sharing cheesesteaks and the
awkward awakenings of nascent love. It's here that Sandy, still
nursing her Bucky wounds, discovers that Bucky's claims to American
royalty are a sham and, in an instant, we see Bucky downgraded from
prince to frog. It's a major moment in "Me Times Three": the
revelation that personal histories are often ersatz, that even WASPs
have assimilation issues and that the glass slipper--Sandy's dream
life as a suburban princess--is hugely overrated.</TE>
<TE>   With its razor-sharp dissections of love and aspiration, "Me Times
Three" instructs as deftly as it entertains, making sure to hold out
its innocence-ending lessons with a piquant note of hope: If there's
no guaranteed happily ever after, at least there's a chance of
belonging--especially if you hook up, as Sandy does, with a guy who
can boost your career.</TE>
