<HD>No Letup to Auto Industry Struggles</HD>

<LD>Labor negotiations will add a new wrinkle to the auto industry's
upcoming year, but observers say the overriding theme will be much
the same as in 2002: more incentives for consumers and more worries
about costs, profits and market share.</LD>
<LD>   No-interest financing and other deals have become a trademark of
the industry, leading to vigorous sales: When automakers close the
books for 2002, the U.S. sales tally is expected to be about 16.7
million vehicles, one of the best years ever.</LD>
<LD>   But what's been good for consumers hasn't always been for
manufacturers. Incentive programs that began soon after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks have hampered profits and stock prices at General
Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler Group,
among others.</LD>
<TE>   By year's end, automakers in North America will have provided
about $40 billion in incentives, said analyst J Ferron of
PricewaterhouseCoopers.</TE>
<TE>   "And you wonder where the profits have gone," Ferron said.</TE>
<TE>   Market share is shrinking along with profits. Although the
traditional Big Three -- GM, Ford and Chrysler -- controlled about
72% of the U.S. market six years ago, that number has dwindled by
nearly a dozen percentage points as Japanese and other foreign makers
have expanded.</TE>
<TE>   The charge continues as Toyota Motor Corp., Honda Motor Co.,
Nissan Motor Co. and Hyundai Motor Co. add new vehicles and
manufacturing capacity in North America. A major addition next year
will be Nissan's assembly plant in Canton, Miss., which is set to
begin production in the spring and eventually employ 5,300 people.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts predict that foreign brands will have 50% of the
U.S. market in the next five years.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you can safely say ... that all of them have their pedal
to the metal," said George Peterson, president of AutoPacific Inc., a
Santa Ana-based automotive market research firm.</TE>
<TE>   A fuzzy economic picture and the likely need for further
incentives will only heighten financial worries in the new year,
analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the industry over the past several years, what you
see are more cars with more content at lower prices," said John
Hoffecker, a vice president at the management consulting firm A.T.
Kearney.</TE>
<TE>   "Each of them, whether it's Ford, Chrysler, GM, or whether it's
any of their suppliers, is going to have to continue to reduce costs
in an accelerated fashion," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffecker said it's difficult to predict sales patterns for next
year, although some forecasts say overall U.S. volume is likely to
decline 3%. Adding to the uncertainty is a possible U.S. attack on
Iraq and its implications on fuel supplies and prices.</TE>
<TE>   Upcoming contract talks between the United Auto Workers and the
Detroit automakers is another challenge. The current agreements on
wages and benefits for more than 300,000 UAW workers at GM, Ford and
Chrysler and auto parts suppliers Delphi Corp. and Visteon Corp.
expire in September.</TE>
<TE>   The UAW could find it difficult to match the pay hikes and job
security measures negotiated in Canada in 2002 for GM, Ford and
Chrysler workers there.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, when U.S. contracts were last negotiated, the UAW
leveraged strong corporate profits and industry sales into a
four-year contract that provided 3% annual pay increases and
prohibited plant closings.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, GM, Ford and Chrysler have lost U.S. market share and
faced other difficulties, such as billions of dollars in pension fund
deficits.</TE>
<TE>   Big factors between now and then will be the economy, new car and
truck sales and ongoing restructurings at Ford and Chrysler.</TE>
<TE>   Both companies are in the midst of major turnarounds that include
tens of thousands of job reductions.</TE>
<TE>   Ford, which turns 100 in 2003, is nearly 12 months into a
five-year revitalization plan that calls for the elimination of
35,000 jobs globally -- part of its goal to improve profit by $9
billion by mid-decade.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say Ford appears to be progressing in its effort to
reduce costs and improve efficiency, but market-share loss, price
wars with GM and Chrysler and weak performance by luxury brands such
as Jaguar have driven away some investors.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler expects to finish job reductions in 2003 that are part of
its latest restructuring, started in February 2001. To date, Chrysler
has made nearly 25,000 of the planned 26,000 cuts.</TE>
<TE>   GM will welcome a new chairman next year, although he has a
familiar face: The world's No. 1 automaker announced in December that
President and Chief Executive Rick Wagoner will assume the additional
post of chairman in May, succeeding Jack Smith, who is retiring.</TE>
<TE>   GM expected to post, at the end of 2002, its first back-to-back
yearly gains in U.S. market share in more than a quarter century. Its
share of U.S. car and truck sales rose to 28.1% in 2001 from 27.8% in
2000.</TE>
<TE>   A big issue for the company is the drain on profit caused by its
stake in foreign outfits such as Isuzu and Fiat.</TE>
<TE>   "The situation has gotten a lot more serious during the course of
2002 and looks like it will be an issue for GM's cash flow," said
analyst David Healy of Burnham Securities Inc.</TE>

<HD>Machine Makers Coming Into Fashion</HD>
<DH>Industrial brands such as Deere and Caterpillar draw buyers
to apparel, other consumer lines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Kelly</AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Manolo and Prada, move aside. Some brawny brands from the industrial
heartland are vying for "designer" space on store shelves.</LD>
<LD>   Midwestern manufacturers such as Caterpillar Inc., Deere &amp; Co. and
Harley-Davidson Inc. -- best known for building powerful machines --
are muscling into consumer categories from apparel and footwear to
toys and housewares.</LD>
<LD>   Among the top sellers are child-size, battery-powered tractors and
motorcycles that kids can tool around on at 5 mph. There's even a
miniature Harley in pink for girls.</LD>
<TE>   The captains of industry also are targeting the apparel category,
hoping consumers will want to wear jackets, boots and other items
with brand names that may be more associated with rugged machinery
than with trendy designer fashion.</TE>
<TE>   Caterpillar, maker of excavators, backhoes and other construction
gear, has attracted a following among the young and hip in Europe,
who covet its footwear.</TE>
<TE>   "It's American and it's blue collar," said Thomas O'Guinn, a
business and sociology professor at the University of Illinois who
studies "brand communities."</TE>
<TE>   Kimberly Neible, marketing manager for Peoria, Ill.-based
Caterpillar, said the brand began to take off in Europe during the
grunge music era of the early 1990s. The company sells 7 million to 9
million pairs of shoes annually around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Caterpillar tailors its clothing and footwear to the youth market,
particularly the 18- to 26-year-old crowd, with whom it hopes to
raise its profile.</TE>
<TE>   "To that age group one of the things we represent is authenticity.
We are the work brand," Neible said.</TE>
<TE>   Marketing experts say a key to ensuring the long-term vitality of
a brand is to build relationships early.</TE>
<TE>   "The question with all of these heritage brands is how do you stay
relevant to the younger generation? If you can introduce the brand at
a younger age, that goes a long way," said David Aaker, professor
emeritus of marketing at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   What began as a strategy to boost brand awareness has become a
healthy profit generator, these companies say.</TE>
<TE>   Harley-Davidson reported general merchandise sales of $164 million
last year, or almost 5% of total sales, spokesman Mike Morgan said.</TE>
<TE>   Caterpillar, which does not break out revenue from merchandise,
said sales at the retail level doubled in five years to $850 million
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Firms such as Caterpillar and Deere license their names to
specialty manufacturers and receive royalties of 3% to 10% of retail
sales, with "no downside" risk because their partners produce the
products, Aaker said. "It's an incredible margin."</TE>

<HD>Charities See Lack of Electronic Goodwill</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Charity begins at home. But not, apparently, on the home computer.</LD>
<LD>   In this season of giving, it's no surprise that nonprofit
organizations have taken a cue from the world of electronic commerce
and made online giving as fast and convenient as ordering a book from
Amazon.com or bidding for a bobble-head doll on EBay.</LD>
<LD>   But despite the proliferation of "Donate Now" buttons prominently
displayed on nonprofit Web sites, e-charity has mostly been a bust.</LD>
<TE>   A study by the Chronicle of Philanthropy found that only 11% of
major nonprofits generate 1% or more of their annual contributions
online. Most would be happy with even that.</TE>
<TE>   The American Red Cross Web site normally collects about $2,000 a
day in donations. This month -- traditionally a popular time for
charities because of the swell of holiday spirit and the rush to rack
up year-end tax deductions -- donations to RedCross.org have swelled
to $6,000 on some days.</TE>
<TE>   That's hardly worth the trouble for an organization that in its
last fiscal year took in total contributions of $768 million.</TE>
<TE>   "When there is a disaster, people respond by going to their
computers and making a donation to us," said Phil Zepeda, a spokesman
for the Washington-based Red Cross who also oversees its Web site.
"Otherwise, not a whole lot comes in online."</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago, pundits predicted that the Internet would
revolutionize charity donations.</TE>
<TE>   "They were saying the age of direct mail was behind us," recalled
Mark Rovner, senior vice president with Craver, Mathews, Smith &amp; Co.,
a consulting firm in Arlington, Va., that has Amnesty International
and Habitat for Humanity on its client list.</TE>
<TE>   Online campaigns could mean huge savings on postage, printing
costs and paper, leaving more money for charities to perform good
works. Donors also save on postage and time.</TE>
<TE>   But as it turned out, that forecast of a charity revolution "was
as unreliable as a lot of others about the Internet," Rovner said.</TE>
<TE>   A CMS study showed that givers generally write checks to their
favorite charities while paying their bills. In both cases, they are
responding to paper solicitations with paper checks.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, e-mail charity efforts have to compete with
much-loathed online pitches for gadgets, miracle cures and
pornography. That renders them far from cost-effective.</TE>
<TE>   "An organization might spend $200 to $300 for every donation that
comes back" electronically, Rovner said. "A carefully done
direct-mail campaign might cost $10 or $20 per donation."</TE>
<TE>   E-mail campaigns also can endanger the carefully cultivated image
of an organization.</TE>
<TE>   "We spent the last 15 years gathering the names and addresses of
110,000 supporters," said Craig Thompson, executive director of AIDS
Project Los Angeles. "We would have to be very careful not to annoy
or antagonize those people by sending out a bunch of e-mail to what
they consider their private e-mail addresses."</TE>
<TE>   Still, organizations are testing ways to better exploit the
Internet. In the spring, APLA's direct-mail campaign will ask donors
to respond online with credit card contributions. That would make
accounting easier and eliminate the expensive problem of dealing with
checks that bounce.</TE>
<TE>   Despite lackluster results so far, the future of online giving
remains promising in some eyes.</TE>
<TE>   As members of the computer-savvy generation age and enter their
more philanthropic years, e-charity may become more common, Rovner
said.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe online giving just has to seem more like online shopping.</TE>
<TE>   Take the case of Heifer International. The Little Rock
organization was founded in 1944 to provide poor villages around the
world with food- and income-producing animals.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, it raised $5.1 million -- about 13% of its $39 million
in total contributions -- through its Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Givers can click on a picture of a goat, pig, llama or other
animal to donate it in the name of a family member or friend.</TE>
<TE>   This month, Heifer racked up three straight days in which online
contributions exceeded $250,000.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesman Ray White says the site plays on the treasure-hunting
quality of online shopping.</TE>
<TE>   "You give someone a water buffalo," White said, "and they don't
forget you."</TE>

<HD>Credit Errors a Risk for Third of Consumers</HD>
<DH>Discrepancies in widely used reports could force many
borrowers to pay higher interest on loans, advocacy groups say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Leigh Strope</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Discrepancies in credit reports of more than one-third of consumers
could make it harder for them to obtain loans or force them to pay
higher interest rates to get loans, a new study suggests.</LD>
<LD>   Common discrepancies included omissions of revolving accounts in
good standing and mortgage payments that were never late. On the
negative side, omissions also included failure to report
delinquencies or charge-offs, said the study, conducted by the
Consumer Federation of America and the National Credit Reporting
Assn., two consumer advocacy groups.</LD>
<LD>   Credit scores and reports are increasingly being used, not only by
banks and lenders but by insurance companies, employers and service
providers such as utilities to help determine an applicant's
likelihood of repaying debts.</LD>
<TE>   The FICO score, developed by Fair, Isaac &amp; Co., is a number
between 300 and 850 that more than 70% of the largest financial
institution lenders use to determine credit risk. Scores are based on
payment history, debt owed and types of credit used. All of that
appears on credit reports.</TE>
<TE>   For consumers with scores near 620, considered the dividing line
between bad and good credit, discrepancies and omissions can affect
whether they get approved for a mortgage at the best interest rate,
the study said.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesmen at Atlanta-based Equifax, one of three credit
repositories, say each agency has its own guidelines about what it
collects and how long it retains the information.</TE>
<TE>   Timing also is an issue, said John Ford, Equifax's privacy
officer. Information can vary from each repository, depending on when
a report is requested. No law requires creditors to report to all
three.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the major flaws that we see in the study is this notion
that if the three credit reporting agencies don't all have exactly
the same data, then that's an error," Ford said. "Nothing could be
further from the truth. There are lots of reasons."</TE>
<TE>   The study estimated that of consumers with scores between 575 and
630, a fifth would be adversely affected and another fifth would
benefit from score inaccuracies if they tried to obtain mortgage
loans.</TE>
<TE>   "The allocation of credit should not be based on a lottery
system," said Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the consumer
federation.</TE>
<TE>   Falling below the 620 cutoff can cause significant extra costs for
borrowers, he said. Over the life of a 30-year, $150,000 mortgage, a
borrower incorrectly charged a subprime rate of 9.84% instead of a
prime rate of 6.56% would pay $124,067 more in interest.</TE>
<TE>   The groups analyzed the credit scores of more than 500,000
consumers. A more extensive investigation was conducted on complete
credit files of more than 1,700 consumers. No personal information
that could be used to identify an individual was recorded during the
study, the groups said.</TE>
<TE>   They are recommending policy changes to help improve fairness,
including urging government agencies such as the Department of
Housing and Urban Development and the Federal Trade Commission to
evaluate credit scoring systems regularly, including automated
mortgage and insurance underwriting systems and tenant and employee
screening systems.</TE>
<TE>   Other recommendations include:</TE>
<TE>   * Requiring creditors to provide consumers free copies of their
credit reports immediately after they are denied loans or receive
higher interest rates and to give quick reconsideration if errors are
discovered.</TE>
<TE>   * Urging consumers to review credit history regularly, especially
before applying for a mortgage loan, and correct any errors or
discrepancies.</TE>

<HD>Audit, Lawsuit Trip Up DC Shoes' Smooth Ride</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Debora Vrana</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They were two California dudes with dreams of never growing up.</LD>
<LD>   Not that Ken Block, a snowboarder, and Damon Way, a skateboarder,
minded hard work. They just wanted it to be fun.</LD>
<LD>   So as an alternative to college, marriage and what they saw as the
suburban nightmare, the twentysomethings in 1993 started DC Shoes
Co., a maker of shoes for skateboarders, and built it into a
$100-million enterprise.</LD>
<TE>   Knowing they were short on financial skills, that same year they
hired the father of a high school friend. At the time, Clayton Blehm
was a 58-year-old unemployed accountant living above his daughter's
garage. He began by coming in to DC Shoes a few hours a week to help
the boys crunch numbers. He eventually became a co-owner and chief
financial officer.</TE>
<TE>   The Vista, Calif.-based company expanded quickly, making shoes
with names such as "Danny Boy" and "Boxer," and began a line of surf
wear. Despite its growth, DC Shoes was able to retain its appeal with
skate kids and fashion-conscious youth.</TE>
<TE>   "They were started as a hard-core skate brand but have crossed
over into surf and are still considered hard-core skate," said Sean
Smith, a managing director of the Surf Industry Manufacturers Assn.,
a San Clemente-based trade group.</TE>
<TE>   But now, along with success, Block, 35, and Way, 31, have crashed
into some real grown-up problems. Not only is the Internal Revenue
Service auditing the firm, DC Shoes also is in the middle of a
$140-million court battle with the 69-year-old Blehm, who alleges
that he was wrongfully terminated because of his age.</TE>
<TE>   The audit, which was started last year, still is underway,
according to DC Shoes counsel Brian A. Wright. IRS officials did not
return phone calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Blehm's lawsuit, filed in October in San Diego County Superior
Court, contends that DC Shoes fired him in June because he was "an
older, high-salaried employee." He maintains that he didn't fit the
young, hip image that Australian surf wear firm Billabong
International Ltd. wanted for DC Shoes when it expressed interest in
buying the company in May. In the end, the deal didn't go forward.</TE>
<TE>   Blehm is seeking $140 million in damages from a group of
defendants, including Billabong and DC Shoes. Blehm's attorney, Larry
Campitiello, said his client was not available for comment. Block and
Way, who also are named in Blehm's suit, would not comment on the
case. But Block issued a statement, saying: "We have a good team of
lawyers and accountants dealing with these issues. They have done a
good job handling matters so Damon and I can concentrate on our jobs
-- product development, marketing and brand positioning."</TE>
<TE>   For its part, Billabong has denied any wrongdoing in connection
with Blehm's ouster. The company "believes there is no substance to
the claim and that it is frivolous," it said in a filing with the
Australian Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 18, a cross-complaint was filed by DC Shoes, Block and
Way, alleging the Blehm had committed fraud and breached his
fiduciary duty.</TE>
<TE>   "We are confident the facts will show that the only meritorious
claims in this lawsuit are those set forth in DC's cross-complaint,"
said Wright, the company's counsel.</TE>
<TE>   In their suit, Block and Way allege that Blehm, who was
responsible for monitoring all financial, accounting and tax
functions of the company, overpaid himself and used DC Shoes to
"financially support his friends, acquaintances and family members."</TE>
<TE>   They also claim that he took out a $500,000 loan from the firm in
February to buy a house. The loan was due in 15 days, but he never
repaid the money, the suit maintains.</TE>
<TE>   The suit also contends that Blehm "unlawfully charged tens of
thousands of dollars in personal expenses to the corporate credit
card issued" in his name and then "instructed employees at DC Shoes
not to discuss his financial improprieties with Way and Block under
the threat of termination of employment."</TE>
<TE>   Judge Thomas P. Nugent has yet to set a trial date.</TE>
<TE>   The acrimony between Blehm and his young partners is a far cry
from the feelings that were prevalent during earlier days at the
company -- a time lionized in a new book compiled by Blehm's son,
Eric, called "Agents of Change: The Story of DC Shoes and Its
Athletes."</TE>
<TE>   "May the DC Shoes story inspire you as it has me," Eric Blehm
writes in the foreword to the 256-page book, which was published by
ReganBooks, a division of HarperCollins.</TE>
<TE>   Block, who was born in Long Beach, attended Palomar College in San
Marcos, Calif., but never graduated. While there, he spent many hours
creating logos and artwork on the school's computers and transferring
the designs to T-shirts. That led to his first enterprise, a clothing
company. Later, while working at a local sports shop, he met Way, who
had come in to get a surfboard waxed.</TE>
<TE>   Like Block, Way also attended Palomar but never graduated. Born at
a hippie commune in Northern California, he suffered a serious injury
in high school that kept him from becoming a professional
skateboarder.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is Blehm, an Oklahoma native, described in the book as
"a workaholic who tirelessly strove for success." In his long career,
he had worked at everything from a child-care business to a family
Christmas tree venture. "Creative by nature," according to the book,
"he modified and produced such inventions as wind-up extension cords
and eyeshades (without lenses)."</TE>
<TE>   But Blehm had never contemplated an enterprise connected to
skateboarding until he met Block and Way. "They weren't smart-aleck;
they were both nice," Blehm recalls in the book. "They had nice
demeanors and seemed relatively clean-cut, except for Damon's long
hair."</TE>
<TE>   Still, he was reluctant to sign on with them. "The last thing I
wanted," he says, was to join a company "owned by a couple of young
kids."</TE>

<HD>Del Monte Digests Heinz Brands</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Liedtke</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While other businesses slow down for the holidays, Del Monte Foods
Co. is gearing up to try to capitalize on its biggest acquisition in
more than a decade of deal making.</LD>
<LD>   This week Del Monte began running a greatly expanded product line
that has doubled the company's size. The additions include StarKist
tuna and top-selling brands of pet food.</LD>
<LD>   The new products, picked up in a $2.3-billion spinoff from
Pittsburgh-based H.J. Heinz Co., herald the latest incarnation of San
Francisco-based Del Monte and its 110-year-old brand.</LD>
<TE>   The company has undergone several makeovers since investors
extracted the nation's largest canned vegetable and fruit business
from RJR Nabisco in a $1.5-billion leveraged buyout in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   None of the previous deals has been as big as its takeover of
Heinz's tuna, pet food, baby food and private-label soup brands.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot of hard work ahead of us, but it should be a lot
of fun, too," Del Monte Chief Executive Richard G. Wolford said.</TE>
<TE>   With the newly acquired Heinz brands, Del Monte expects its annual
sales to rise above $3 billion, up from $1.3 billion in the company's
last fiscal year ending in June.</TE>
<TE>   Del Monte's workforce is swelling to 8,500 from 2,800 year-round
employees to handle the heavier sales volume. The company also hires
9,800 temporary employees each year to handle seasonal fluctuations
in production.</TE>
<TE>   The Heinz brands will add more variety to a Del Monte product mix
that has been dominated by fruits and vegetables. Besides StarKist
tuna, Del Monte is picking up several other well-known brands,
including 9-Lives cat food and Kibbles 'n Bits dog food.</TE>
<TE>   Wolford said Del Monte isn't planning any immediate changes among
the newly acquired brands except in the baby food line, where the
name of Heinz Nature's Goodness will be switched to the Del Monte
label.</TE>
<TE>   "We think the Del Monte name will work much better with [baby
food] because consumers think of the brand as dependable, trustworthy
and wholesome," Wolford said.</TE>
<TE>   Del Monte also hopes to introduce products under the
market-leading StarKist tuna brand, which has been experimenting with
several new flavors contained in pouches instead of cans.</TE>
<TE>   The company will finance its new ideas from the $50 million in
annual savings it expects in three to four years by combining some
operations with the newly acquired Heinz factories.</TE>
<TE>   Wolford, a former Dole Foods Co. executive, has been reshaping Del
Monte since he became CEO in 1997, when the investment firm Texas
Pacific Group bought a majority stake in the privately held company.</TE>
<TE>   Since Wolford's arrival, Del Monte has bought the Contadina,
SunFresh and S&amp;W canned food brands. Those deals helped boost annual
sales by about 20%, or $200 million, in the last four years. During
the same period, Del Monte's earnings climbed from $5.5 million in
its fiscal 1998 to $38.5 million last year.</TE>
<TE>   The performance hasn't inspired much enthusiasm for Del Monte's
stock since the company's February 1999 initial public offering at
$15 a share. The shares closed down 25 cents at $7.96 Tuesday on the
New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Investors apparently aren't excited about Del Monte's prospects
with the Heinz brands either. Del Monte's stock has plummeted 30%
since the June announcement of the spinoff.</TE>

<HD>Builders Turn to Upscale Projects in Inland Empire</HD>
<DH>Betting that the region can draw more affluent home buyers
and renters, developers are working on high-end homes and apartments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jesus Sanchez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Home builder Jim Previti knows firsthand that the Inland Empire can
be a tough sell to the jet-set crowd.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the executives at his own firm, Empire Cos., prefer to
endure long commutes from their homes in coastal Los Angeles and
Orange counties rather than live near the company's offices in
Ontario. Previti himself flies to work in a private plane from a
second home in Carlsbad when the summer heats up.</LD>
<LD>   Yet he and a growing number of developers are launching an array
of upscale projects in Riverside and San Bernardino counties, hoping
to woo a more affluent group of home buyers to the Inland Empire.</LD>
<TE>   Convinced that Southern California's surging real estate values
will push more people east, with many looking for something more than
starter homes, Empire and other builders are investing hundreds of
millions of dollars in new luxury properties, penthouse apartments
and high-end shopping centers.</TE>
<TE>   Previti's projects include a gated community in Corona called the
Retreat -- 540 homes, priced from $450,000 to $900,000, nestled along
a private golfcourse designed by Jack Nicklaus.</TE>
<TE>   In Rancho Cucamonga, Randall Lewis, whose family amassed a
real-estate fortune from affordable housing, is developing stylish
apartment complexes where rent on the units would range from $1,400
to $1,900 a month. His target tenants: young executives.</TE>
<TE>   "We are getting single professionals in much larger numbers than
we did before," Lewis said.</TE>
<TE>   By Southern California standards, the Inland Empire is still a
haven for first-time home buyers.</TE>
<TE>   Half the homes sold in Riverside County last month were priced
below $228,000 and half above that, while the median price in San
Bernardino County stood at $175,000. That contrasts with $281,000 in
Los Angeles County and $383,000 in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   But home prices in the Inland Empire are now rising as rapidly as
those in neighboring counties, and builders are responding by putting
up higher-priced dwellings. This year, about one-third of all new
houses sold in the Inland Empire cost $300,000 or more. That may not
seem like a lot, but five years ago less than 5% fell into that price
category, according to DataQuick Information Systems, a real estate
research firm.</TE>
<TE>   John Husing, an independent economist who has studied the Inland
Empire for 30 years, says all the signs point to a shifting market.</TE>
<TE>   The area, Husing says, is entering its final stage of development,
propelled by builders such as Previti, who this year sold his
longtime business, Forecast Homes, and now is concentrating on
upscale development.</TE>
<TE>   "They've nailed a market that nobody knew was here," said Husing,
who thinks this new wave of building is going to make them rich.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, that's what a lot of developers thought in the 1980s
during the region's last housing boom -- before many of the firms
went belly up in the early '90s after widespread job layoffs in the
Southland depressed home values and led to soaring foreclosures.</TE>
<TE>   Promising Growth</TE>
<TE>   Although there are risks this time around as well -- home prices
have been growing in the last year at a rate several times higher
than inflation and personal incomes -- analysts don't see the same
pattern occurring.</TE>
<TE>   With available land far more scarce, they say, builders haven't
overbuilt. Job growth in the Inland Empire, meanwhile, has been solid
even during the economic slowdown, and the area has been creating
better-paying jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The ranks of managers and professionals living in three of the
Inland Empire's higher-income cities -- Corona, Rancho Cucamonga and
Temecula -- rose 40% from 1989 to 1999, according to census data
analyzed by regional economists.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, analysts say, many of the same first-time homeowners
who flocked east during the last boom are now joining others in the
Southland looking to buy larger homes.</TE>
<TE>   There is a "tremendous" number of local buyers seeking to move
up," said Nicholas Coussoulis, chairman of Joseph Nicholas Homes. The
company recently finished the first phase of Sunset Hills Estates in
Redlands, where the most expensive of the sprawling residences top
$600,000. "We have found a very, very good market," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the high-end activity is taking place along the western
edge of the Inland Empire. In Rancho Cucamonga, Lewis and a
Cincinnati-based partner are building Victoria Gardens. The
$300-million residential and commercial project features an outdoor
mall where streets will be lined with swanky boutiques, movie
theaters and a performance center.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to create a place like Santa Monica or Pasadena where
people can shop, stroll, dine and be entertained all at the same
time," said Colm Macken, whose firm, Forest City Development
California  Inc., plans to break ground on the project next spring.</TE>
<TE>   Developing Expertise</TE>
<TE>   For Previti, who along with partners has built about 20,000 houses
-- most of them in the Inland Empire -- his latest work is a
culmination of three decades of development in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Previti moved to Southern California in the early 1970s, fresh out
of the Marines. The New Jersey native landed in the home-building
business by accident when he accepted two unfinished lots in Pomona
as a down payment on a house he was selling. Unable to find a buyer
for the lots, he and a partner constructed houses on the properties.
Priced at $29,950 each, they both sold in a weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "Then we went looking for more lots," he said. Previti began
developing homes in batches of 10 or 12, and eventually took on
bigger projects as the region blossomed.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1990s, Previti and his partners helped convince others
that the Inland Empire was ready to jump to the next level when they
started construction on a master-planned community of 1,500 homes in
the foothills near Corona. The last stages of that development
featured $600,000 homes overlooking a public golfcourse and country
club.</TE>
<TE>   This year, with $320 million in cash and securities from the sale
of his old company to Hovnanian Enterprises Inc., one of the largest
developers in the state, Previti is planning more ambitious projects.</TE>
<TE>   In Ontario, he is proposing a six-story office building topped
with penthouse apartments. A short drive away, his aviation
subsidiary has started construction on a new terminal for private and
corporate jets at Ontario International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Devereaux, city manager of Ontario, says his community, which
has grown to a population of 162,000, needs more developments like
that.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have the upscale and more urban kinds of housing that
managers and owners want to live in," he said. "And if they can't
find someplace to live here, they won't locate here."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Previti knows his latest ventures may take years to
pay off. But he and other developers are betting that time and
geography will be on their side. They think ever increasing
congestion and housing prices along the coast will keep pushing
people and jobs in their direction.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the growth is going to happen here because there is no
other choice," said Previti. "There is no other place."</TE>

<HD>Details Sought in Idealab Lawsuit</HD>
<DH>Judge orders investors suing to dissolve firm to give more
information before deciding whether case will go to trial.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tom Petruno</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge has ruled that investors suing to dissolve Pasadena-based
technology incubator Idealab Inc. need to provide him with more
information on certain allegations in the case.</LD>
<LD>   The civil suit was filed this year by more than 40 shareholders
who put more than $700 million into Idealab in early 2000 -- just as
the technology bubble was bursting.</LD>
<LD>   The investors -- who include such big names as mutual fund giant
T. Rowe Price, Los Angeles venture capital firm Kline Hawkes and a
group of former top executives at Microsoft Corp. -- allege that
Idealab founder Bill Gross mismanaged the firm and that he arranged
sweetheart financial deals for himself.</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Ralph Dau on Monday gave
the investors 15 days to amend their suit with regard to allegations
of fraud, breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract. He also
asked for more information on the investors' assertion that they have
the right to call for the company to be dissolved.</TE>
<TE>   The investors want the company shut down so they can take back at
least a portion of the $350 million of liquid assets left in Idealab.
They are asking for a jury trial to decide the case.</TE>
<TE>   Gross, 44, has called the investors' allegations "completely
false" and has insisted he won't close Idealab despite the withered
outlook for many sectors of the technology business.</TE>
<TE>   Idealab, which in the 1990s spawned such Internet firms as search
engine Overture Services Inc. and defunct toy retailer EToys Inc., is
incubating about 10 ventures and employs about 100 people, Gross told
The Times in November.</TE>
<TE>   Dau's ruling "basically is saying he wants more specific facts,
which we are happy to provide," said Skip Miller, partner at
Christensen, Miller, Fink, Jacobs, Glaser, Weil &amp; Shapiro, which is
representing the investors.</TE>
<TE>   He said the plaintiffs will amend their complaint with information
recently obtained as part of the ongoing discovery process in the
case.</TE>
<TE>   Idealab executives could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Idealab and Gross, the defendants in the suit include
Gross' wife, Marcia Goodstein, who is the company's president; other
senior officers; and director Benjamin Rosen, the founder of Compaq
Computer Corp. and a longtime investor in many of Gross' projects.</TE>

<HD>Yield on Japanese Government Bonds Slides to 4-Year Low</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Times Staff</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Japan already has the world's lowest government bond yields, but
they're getting even lower. It's a worrisome sign that investors
believe the nation's deflation woes will deepen in 2003, experts say.</LD>
<LD>   The annualized yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.95% on Tuesday, the lowest since the yield briefly
plunged to 0.8% in the autumn of 1998 when the near-failure of a huge
U.S. investment fund caused a temporary panic in world markets.</LD>
<LD>   By contrast, 10-year U.S. Treasury notes yield about 3.94%.</LD>
<TE>   Japanese investors were willing to accept ever-lower yields on
government bonds in the 1990s as the economy faltered repeatedly and
the stock market continued to slide.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, because Japan is suffering from deflation rather than
inflation, the true return on bonds is higher than the nominal yield.
That's because as purchasing power rises, the promise of interest to
be paid in the future is worth more than money now.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese consumer prices, other than for fresh food, have been in
a virtually constant downtrend since April 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese government bond yields had been rising in the first part
of the year, reaching a high of 1.5%, as some investors bet that the
nation might finally be on the verge of reversing its economic
decline.</TE>
<TE>   But yields have plunged anew since late summer and fell below 1%
early in November.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, bonds have become more attractive on expectations
that the U.S. dollar will continue to weaken against the yen,
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar's value has been sliding against the euro, the British
pound and other key currencies on fears that a U.S.-Iraq military
conflict will drive foreign investors to sell U.S. holdings.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar has weakened modestly against the yen, falling from 125
yen on Dec. 5 to 120.33 this week.</TE>
<TE>   A stronger yen would reduce the prices of goods that Japan
imports. That would exacerbate deflationary pressures, analysts said,
driving more investors into government bonds, despite the low yields.</TE>
<TE>   "A stronger yen is positive for bonds," said Yoshiaki Murakawa,
who manages about $2.5 billion at SG Yamaichi Asset Management. "The
dollar has greater chances of falling against the yen in coming weeks
on concern the U.S. may attack Iraq as early as late January."</TE>
<TE>   Investors' year-end settling of accounts also has had a bullish
effect on Japanese bonds: Investors who aim to hold the safest
securities ahead of the long New Year's holidays have been loading up
on government bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Financial markets in Japan will be closed from Dec. 31 to Jan. 5.</TE>
<TE>   But some analysts say the bond rally could be short-lived if the
government shows new resolve to address deflation.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has said he wants the next Bank
of Japan governor to focus on fighting deflation. The current
governor, Masaru Hayami, will retire in March.</TE>
<TE>   "The government is increasing pressure on the central bank to
boost consumer prices," said Hiroyuki Kubota, a fixed-income analyst
at RP Tech Inc. "That may make it tougher to justify pushing bond
yields down from here."</TE>

<HD>Microsoft Switches Strategy on Linux</HD>
<DH>The giant software firm touts its 'business value' to
dissuade companies from adopting the alternative to Windows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Helen Jung</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. executives have called the open-source software Linux
a cancer. They've even described the increasingly popular operating
system -- an alternative to Microsoft's proprietary Windows -- as
un-American.</LD>
<LD>   But now they're hoping to attach a different word: costly.</LD>
<LD>   As businesses increasingly adopt Linux to run their computer
servers, Microsoft is shifting the battleground from schoolyard
insults or techie-speak to corporate notions of "business value."</LD>
<TE>   "There has been a lot of debate in the Linux space that has been
focused on the emotion and focused on the technology," said Peter
Houston, senior director of server strategy for Microsoft.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft, he said, is trying to show customers that it's the best
choice "when you make a buying decision based on the business value."</TE>
<TE>   It's the latest turn in a battle that has the world's largest
software company squaring off against a technology that is, for now,
more political statement than commercial competitor.</TE>
<TE>   While Microsoft is a single corporation that zealously guards the
code underlying its Windows operating system, Linux is more difficult
to pin down and has no single owner. The Linux community makes the
underlying source code openly available for improvements by any
programmer. Users can download the software for free.</TE>
<TE>   The Linux hydra is growing a commercial head too. Companies
including Sun Microsystems Inc. and IBM Corp. are rolling out
products and creating business models based on Linux.</TE>
<TE>   And Microsoft has seized on that development -- and points out the
technological expertise and labor needed to tailor Linux to
companies' needs -- in arguing that free isn't really free.</TE>
<TE>   Linux can require costly technical staff, said Rob Enderle, an
analyst with Giga Information Group.</TE>
<TE>   "You lose the ability to buy something and plug it in," he said.
"It takes you more time to do it. If the [Linux expert] leaves, you
could be left with something that's unsupportable."</TE>
<TE>   Still, customizability is part of Linux's appeal, Enderle said.</TE>
<TE>   Houston said Microsoft is marketing its out-of-the-box ease, along
with the fact that technical staffers already are familiar with
Microsoft software, as reasons companies should choose Microsoft
server products.</TE>
<TE>   The company even commissioned a study, by International Data
Corp., concluding that in network infrastructure, file serving, print
serving and security workloads, Linux-based servers cost more to run
than Microsoft Windows 2000 server software over a five-year period.
The report cites the staffing costs as the biggest reason.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Microsoft has reason to worry. Linux has been gaining
ground in the market for software on new computer servers, so much so
that one analyst firm, Meta Group in Stamford, Conn., predicted that
Microsoft will start offering limited products tailored for the Linux
platform by the end of 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Meta Group projects that Linux will grow from today's roughly 15%
to as much as 45% of the market for new servers by 2006 or 2007. Meta
says business-savvy Microsoft won't be able to resist the potential
profit.</TE>
<TE>   Houston denied that. "We made this bet on Windows," he said. "It's
paying off for customers and we're going to stick with that course."</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft also questions whether Linux will capture such a big
share of the market.</TE>
<TE>   Several analysts say that Linux's growth comes from Unix-based
servers offered by Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard Co. and others.
In a few years, after most companies abandon Unix, Linux's biggest
opportunity for growth will be by cutting into Microsoft's share.</TE>
<TE>   Linux may get a boost because of residual anger from companies and
government agencies over Microsoft's new licensing program. That
program, instituted this year, requires those who buy software in
bulk to sign up for multiyear subscriptions for upgrades or
potentially pay far more later on.</TE>
<TE>   Although some customers said they signed up this time, they might
not renew if they have a viable alternative.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft can tout potential savings and commission studies, but
those efforts won't be any more effective in securing customers than
its past tactics, Enderle said.</TE>
<TE>   "To make that argument, it really needs to be made by
practitioners, not by the vendor itself," the analyst said. "To make
it stick you really need company [information technology] managers to
stand up."</TE>

<HD>Suit Claims Pharmacia Skirts Marketing Rules</HD>
<DH>Consumer group alleges the firm is promoting an indication
for the pain drug Bextra that is not approved by the FDA.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A consumer group has sued Pharmacia Corp. over its promotion of the
pain drug Bextra, alleging that the pharmaceutical company is
circumventing federal marketing regulations.</LD>
<LD>   The Congress of California Seniors filed the suit in California
Superior Court in Los Angeles on Monday, alleging that Pharmacia is
illegally promoting the off-label use of Bextra.</LD>
<LD>   Doctors may prescribe drugs in any way they see fit, but drug
companies can only market their products for indications approved by
the Food and Drug Administration. Drug companies can share research
and journal articles with doctors that discuss unapproved uses, but
can't actively suggest that physicians incorporate those uses in
their practices.</LD>
<TE>   The lawsuit says Pharmacia hired Scirex, a clinical testing firm
owned in part by Omnicom Group Inc., a large advertising
conglomerate, to study Bextra for use in cases of acute pain caused
by impacted molars. Bextra is not approved for acute pain but is for
chronic pain associated with arthritis, osteoporosis and menstrual
cramps, according to the suit.</TE>
<TE>   The results of the study were published in the Journal of the
American Dental Assn., and the lawsuit alleges it increased the
drug's sales.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit alleges that Pharmacia went against the spirit of the
law by orchestrating the study when the FDA specifically refused the
company's request for an indication for acute pain.</TE>
<TE>   Pharmacia spokesman Paul Fitzhenry said the company hadn't seen
the lawsuit and had no comment.</TE>
<TE>   The Congress of California Seniors is part of the Prescription
Access Litigation project, a Boston-based coalition of nonprofit
organizations that has been organizing lawsuits against drug
companies to end practices that it contends raise prices.</TE>
<TE>   Off-label promotion has become an issue lately. The U.S.
attorney's office in Boston, 47 states and the District of Columbia
are investigating whether Warner-Lambert Co. illegally promoted
off-label uses for Neurontin, an epilepsy medication. Warner-Lambert
is owned by Pfizer Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Pharmacia shares Tuesday rose 28 cents to $43.00 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Showtime for Theater Owners</HD>
<DH>More Americans went to movies this year than anytime since
1959</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Claudia Eller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Americans escaped to the movies more often this year than at any time
since the Eisenhower administration, giving the nation's theater
operators a much needed surge in business as they continue on the
road to financial recovery.</LD>
<LD>   By some estimates, admissions could climb more than 10% over last
year's record levels, with folks flocking to theaters more than 1.5
billion times.</LD>
<LD>   When the holiday season wraps with such major fare as "The Lord of
the Rings: The Two Towers," "Chicago" and "Catch Me If You Can,"
attendance is expected to hit levels not seen since 1959. Back then,
admissions totaled 1.488 billion.</LD>
<TE>   Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Assn. of America,
said that although the population is larger today, this year's surge
is "stunning" because of the choices technology now provides,
including VCRs, cable television, satellite dishes and the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Those outlets "didn't exist 42 years ago," Valenti said. "Movies
were the prime form of entertainment." He noted that 1946 was the
high-water mark for moviegoing at 4 billion admissions. The low was
1971, with 820 million.</TE>
<TE>   Although Hollywood has released an enticing and diverse mix of
hits this year -- from the budget-straining "Spider-Man" to the
low-priced "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" -- there may be an undercurrent
pushing consumers into theater seats: the lingering effects of 9/11.</TE>
<TE>   "The real world is probably more terrifying than Americans have
ever known," said Armond Aserinsky, a Philadelphia-based clinical
psychologist who uses movies as a tool to treat patients and train
colleagues. "It's the same kind of desire for escape we also saw
during the Depression in the '30s."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever's driving the trend, no one is complaining. Studio
revenues this year are expected to top $9 billion for the first time,
and exhibitors are anticipating a future without the need for
bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're looking for a year to come out of reorganization, it
doesn't get any better than this," said Larry Gerbrandt, chief
content officer for Kagen World Media.</TE>
<TE>   The theater business has spent 18 months trying to right itself
after a multiplex building binge in the mid- to late 1990s forced a
dozen movie circuits into Bankruptcy Court. This move allowed
exhibitors to shed unprofitable old theaters, exit high-cost leases
and get out from under heavy debt loads.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the last of the bunch -- Regal Cinemas, Carmike Cinemas
Inc. and Loews Cineplex -- emerged from bankruptcy protection as
various investment groups bought theaters at deep discounts.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest of the deals belonged to Denver-based billionaire
Philip Anschutz, whose assets include Staples Center and the L.A.
Kings hockey team.</TE>
<TE>   He went on a buying spree that transformed the theater landscape,
merging three major circuits that had filed for bankruptcy protection
-- Regal, United Artists Theatre Co. and Edwards Theatre Co. A month
later, he took them public. Parent company Regal Entertainment Group
is now the world's largest theater chain, with more than 5,660
screens.</TE>
<TE>   Exhibitors are hopeful that this and other consolidations may
finally give them more clout with the Hollywood studios, possibly
leading to a reduction in the "film rental" that theaters pay
distributors to play their movies. The studios, which control how box
office revenue is split with theaters, typically keep about 55% of
the receipts today.</TE>
<TE>   The surge in ticket sales also is important for exhibitors because
of the vast sums moviegoers spend at concession counters.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only are people buying more tickets to our movies, they're
buying more popcorn, candy and sodas," said John Fithian, president
of the National Assn. of Theater Owners.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike having to split box office proceeds with distributors,
theaters get to pocket the profits they make on food and drinks.
Concession sales comprise an estimated 35% to 40% of theater profits.</TE>
<TE>   Still, as Mike Campbell, chief executive of Regal's theater
operations group, cautioned: "Concessions make or break us, but we
wouldn't sell anything unless the film product brings customers into
the theater."</TE>
<TE>   Ronald Krueger II, president of St. Louis-based Wehrenberg
Theatres, said business was brisk in part because of the "larger
number of family-friendly films that struck a chord with audiences."
Among them: the animated hits "Ice Age" and "Lilo &amp; Stitch" and the
live-action movie "Scooby-Doo."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, there were a number of successful adult-oriented
art-house movies such as "My Big Fat Greek Wedding," "Y Tu Mama
Tambien" and "The Good Girl."</TE>
<TE>   Some exhibitors say this year's box office run also may reflect a
shift by some studios to release big-title movies during months
typically considered "off-season."</TE>
<TE>   "There were some brave souls this year," said Raymond W. Syufy,
chief executive of San Rafael, Calif.-based Century Theatres Inc.,
who applauded the studios for not hoarding their movies for the
summer and winter holidays.</TE>
<TE>   Twentieth Century Fox, for example, debuted "Ice Age" in March.
Walt Disney Co. opened "Sweet Home Alabama" in September; DreamWorks
and Universal Pictures released their respective pictures, "The Ring"
and "Red Dragon," in October.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, exhibitors suggest that the ease with which consumers
can now buy tickets online or by phone probably is contributing to
the spike in admissions.</TE>
<TE>   Art Levitt, chief of online movie ticket seller Fandango Inc.,
said advanced sales for "The Two Towers" exceeded those sold by the
company for the entire opening weekend of last year's "Lord of the
Rings."</TE>
<TE>   Although exhibitors tip their hats to distributors for providing
movies people want to see, they say they also deserve some credit for
the upswing by improving the moviegoing experience with updated
megaplexes featuring stadium seating and state-of-the-art picture and
sound presentations.</TE>
<TE>   The management of Milwaukee-based Marcus Theatres Corp. goes one
step further.</TE>
<TE>   "We give after-movie mints.... And our ushers even clean the snow
from windshields," said Bruce Olson, president of the 67-year-old
chain.</TE>
<TE>   Regal's Campbell pointed out that during the last four or five
years, "exhibitors have invested a huge amount of capital -- as much
as $4 billion or $5 billion -- in new theaters." Meanwhile, they also
have jettisoned their underperforming movie houses.</TE>
<TE>   Yet it's crucial, industry observers say, that the construction
and refurbishing plans be executed cautiously. Despite the boost the
theater business has received of late, Fithian of the exhibitors
association is warning members not to repeat the mistakes of the past
by embarking on another building frenzy.</TE>
<TE>   "They have to be rational," he said.</TE>

<HD>Spate of Lawsuits Adds to Insurer's Troubles</HD>
<DH>UnumProvident already was beset by sluggish revenue growth
and a plunging stock price.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James F. Peltz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At first glance, giant disability insurer UnumProvident Corp. seems
as solid as a rock.</LD>
<LD>   The company traces its roots back more than a century, and
promotes itself as a reputable safety net for more than 25 million
American workers. Its board includes two former U.S. senators.</LD>
<LD>   But the company is under attack in scores of lawsuits -- backed by
statements from some former employees -- alleging that it has been
canceling customers' legitimate benefits to shore up the bottom line.</LD>
<TE>   Several suits have been filed in California, and in one case, a
$7.7-million jury award to a Novato woman was upheld last month by a
federal judge who commanded UnumProvident to "obey the law."</TE>
<TE>   The allegations aside, this much is beyond dispute:
UnumProvident's revenue growth is sluggish, claims are up and profit
has not been as strong as Wall Street has expected.</TE>
<TE>   And the lawsuits only add to the troubles besetting the
Chattanooga, Tenn.-based concern that insures about 2 million
Californians and has a major regional office in Glendale with 300
employees.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's Investors Service this month downgraded UnumProvident's
debt ratings because, among other things, "earnings and capital
growth going forward will be constrained." The other major ratings
service, Standard &amp; Poor's, also recently downgraded its outlook for
the company's performance, citing "flat growth trends."</TE>
<TE>   UnumProvident's stock has plunged by two-thirds since nearing $60
a share in mid-1999, wiping out nearly $10 billion of investors'
wealth. The shares closed Tuesday at $17.52 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   All of which keeps alive talk that the 3-year-old merger that
created the company was a mistake -- or at least has been poorly
executed under the watch of UnumProvident's senior executives.</TE>
<TE>   The $5-billion deal combined Provident Cos., the nation's largest
provider of disability insurance for individuals, with Unum Corp.,
the leader in group disability coverage. The transaction came two
years after Provident bought rival Paul Revere Corp., another major
disability carrier, and after both Unum and Provident had gone
through a spree of buying and selling assets to focus more on
disability coverage.</TE>
<TE>   "We are disappointed that we've seen relatively flat earnings the
last couple of years," said Thomas Watjen, UnumProvident's vice
chairman and chief operating officer. But the company is set to
rebound, he vowed, and he defended the merger as creating "a
competitive advantage for us" by enabling UnumProvident to sell a
wider array of policies to group and individual customers.</TE>
<TE>   Without commenting on the specifics of the lawsuits, Watjen
downplayed their impact on UnumProvident's performance. He said the
company has ample reserves to handle all types of claims and
contended that "the volume of individual litigation" against the
company is "actually in decline."</TE>
<TE>   But analysts aren't as sanguine.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuits, which were covered last month in The Times and on
TV's "60 Minutes," add "another level of uncertainty" both in terms
of "how does it affect the bottom line and how does it affect the
perception of potential clients" who might be weighing whether to buy
a new policy from UnumProvident, said Moody's analyst Ann Perry.</TE>
<TE>   Lehman Bros. analyst Eric Berg, in a report to clients last month,
said that "if UnumProvident is perceived in the marketplace as having
an institutional bias against paying claims promptly -- and of
cutting off the claims checks of individuals who are genuinely
disabled -- it seems unavoidable that its new sales will suffer."</TE>
<TE>   The $7.7-million jury award went Joan Hangarter, 53, a mother of
two who was felled by a painful joint condition. She alleged that
after 18 months of making disability payments, UnumProvident abruptly
halted them on the grounds that she was no longer disabled. Her case
and others alleged that UnumProvident employs a widespread quota
scheme to cancel a certain number of payouts each month.</TE>
<TE>   In upholding the woman's award, U.S. Magistrate James Larson of
San Francisco ordered UnumProvident to stop engaging in corporate
tactics alleged in the suits. Among them: using "biased medical
examiners" and "destroying medical reports" to support its decision
to stop paying claims.</TE>
<TE>   UnumProvident denies those actions and any wrongdoing, and is
appealing the judgment in the Hangarter case and others. "We do not
set targets to close valid claims," the company said in a statement,
adding that "a minute percentage of our claims ever involve
litigation."</TE>
<TE>   In all, UnumProvident will pay out some $3.6 billion in claims in
2002, a figure that has risen for 10 straight years.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the policies being contested were sold by the Provident
part of UnumProvident in the late 1980s and early '90s. These "own
occupation" policies were aggressively peddled to doctors, lawyers
and other self-employed professionals, especially in California and
Florida. Hangarter, for example, was a chiropractor.</TE>
<TE>   At first the policies were lucrative. But Watjen acknowledged that
Provident miscalculated how many claims it eventually would face on
that business, priced the coverage too low and wrote the
noncancelable policies with ambiguous language. That, Watjen said,
made them "more susceptible to differences of opinion" on whether
claims should be paid.</TE>
<TE>   Watjen challenged the plaintiffs' contention that UnumProvident
has canceled payments on many of the policies to boost profit, saying
the company and its predecessors years ago added more than $1 billion
to reserves to cover the escalating claims.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, "own occupation" agreements already have cost the
company dearly, and now are more subject to litigation than are other
types of policies.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, UnumProvident is grappling with problems beyond the
"own occupation" market. The company, in fact, is dealing with
lackluster results from its overall business, which includes life
insurance and long-term care coverage.</TE>
<TE>   In the nine months ended Sept. 30, UnumProvident's net income
tumbled 40% from a year earlier, to $273 million from $455 million,
in large part because the company suffered $274 million in investment
losses. It attributes those to the low interest rates it's earning on
its investment portfolio.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even setting aside the investment losses, UnumProvident's
pretax earnings have been flat to declining for each of the past
three years on its basic business, noted Kevin Maher, an analyst at
Standard &amp; Poor's.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. analyst Edward Spehar estimates that
UnumProvident's operating profit this year, excluding realized
investment gains and losses, will be $613 million on revenue of $9.9
billion. That is down from three years ago, when by his calculations
the company had operating profit of $638 million on revenue of $9.2
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Several factors have been at work, observers said. The 1999 merger
creating UnumProvident did not go smoothly, enabling competitors to
exploit the company's instability and seize new business. Then the
weakening economy and rising number of layoffs hobbled
UnumProvident's premium income from group policies -- fewer workers
means fewer premiums paid -- and simultaneously sparked a jump in
disability claims.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's analyst Perry said workers figure "what's the better
option: to be laid off and be on unemployment, or go on disability
and get 60% of your salary?"</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, more employers have dropped disability coverage
for their workers to pare costs. "If you cut a dental program, that's
something people complain about," Maher said. "Disability income
generally doesn't get into that category."</TE>
<TE>   In response, UnumProvident is trying to peddle more individual
policies to workers. "For the most part, employees still want the
coverage," Watjen said. "You have to pump very hard to get some
earnings growth."</TE>
<TE>   Even if the economy improves and lifts UnumProvident's core
business, the highly publicized lawsuits still pose a threat,
especially if more juries dole out awards against the company,
according to analysts.</TE>
<TE>   "At a minimum," Lehman's Berg said, "UnumProvident's management
will be spending lots of time shoring up the company's reputation
when they should be focused on building the business."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Perry believes that UnumProvident may have one thing
going for it: Corporate buyers are likely to have more pressing
concerns than UnumProvident's court battles when it comes to what
disability coverage they purchase.</TE>
<TE>   "They're buying for service and for price," she said, "and they
may be less sensitive" to some of the legal machinations "than a
television audience" is.</TE>

<HD>Ring in 2003 With a Tax Loss</HD>
<DH>The IRS will accept investment trades made as late as New
Year's Eve as transactions for 2002, giving investors time to offset
capital gains.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tom Petruno</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors still have time to lock in a profit or record a loss for
2002.</LD>
<LD>   For tax purposes, the Internal Revenue Service considers the trade
date of a transaction to be the effective date. So investors who sell
a security as late as Tuesday (New Year's Eve) would record any gain
or loss in this tax year, even if the trade isn't settled until 2003.</LD>
<LD>   Stock trades normally take several days to settle, which is when
the seller receives payment from the buyer.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. stock markets will be open for full sessions (6:30 a.m. to 1
p.m. PST) through Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   However, investors who are planning to sell mutual fund shares
should call their fund company and ask what's required. Although many
fund companies allow shares to be redeemed with a phone call, some
require letters to execute a sale.</TE>
<TE>   Fund trades normally are made at the closing price on the day the
transaction is executed.</TE>
<TE>   Whether selling individual stocks or mutual funds to take a loss,
investors should be aware of the "wash sale" rule: The IRS will
disallow any investment loss for tax purposes if you buy the same
security, or a "substantially identical" one (that's the IRS' term),
within 30 days of the sale.</TE>
<TE>   Investors selling fund shares also should remember that there are
four IRS-approved methods that can be used to figure the "cost basis"
of the shares, for purposes of calculating your net gain or loss.</TE>
<TE>   Fund giant Vanguard Group, in an advisory to investors, notes that
"you should decide which method to use before you sell shares because
certain methods require you to specify exactly which shares are to be
sold."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, "Depending on which method you choose, you may not be
able to switch to another method for future sales [of the same fund]
without IRS permission," the advisory says.</TE>
<TE>   Because funds distribute all net realized capital gains to
shareholders each year, investors who own funds in taxable accounts
pay taxes annually on their profit. That means the net capital gain
owed when an investor sells fund shares can be minimal.</TE>
<TE>   Many fund companies offer help to investors in calculating their
net capital gain or loss. Check with a fund representative or the
company's Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, realized gains or losses on stock or fund transactions
within tax-deferred accounts (such as individual retirement accounts)
don't present a tax issue for investors. Money in those accounts
isn't taxed until it's withdrawn, and realized losses in those
accounts can't be used to offset gains in other accounts.</TE>
<TE>   The only exception can be for nondeductible IRA contributions:
Once all money in your traditional IRAs has been withdrawn, you may
have a loss for tax purposes if your total distributions have
amounted to less than your total nondeductible contributions over the
years, according to the IRS.</TE>
<TE>   As with securities sales, taxpayers looking to make charitable
contributions and take a deduction this year have until Tuesday to
make the payments.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS considers a contribution to be made when it is delivered
to the charity, and mailing a check on Dec. 31 would constitute
delivery in 2002, accountants say.</TE>

<HD>Why spend New Year's Eve the same old way?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Carpenter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First there's the booze, then the binge and finally the morning
after. If New Year's Eve is so much fun, why does it culminate in so
many close encounters with porcelain? After years of unabashed
drinking and its consequences, it's understandable that some people
would want to swear off this year-end ritual.</LD>
<LD>   It isn't just recovering alcoholics. Many abstain for health or
philosophical reasons -- pregnancy, for example, or a budding
interest in Buddhism. Others say no because they have families; an
alcohol-free New Year's is simply safer. Whether it's a
family-oriented street fair, a sober dinner-and-dance party, a
mountain hike or some new, personalized ritual you create with
friends, there are a variety of ways to celebrate the New Year.</LD>
<LD>   Sierra Club hike leader Rick Recht is one who has given up
traditional celebrations.</LD>
<TE>   "I'd go to New Year's Eve parties and there would be cigarette
smoke blowing in my face, a boombox in one ear, people just slurping
down alcohol, lights glaring in my face, and I'd come out with a
headache saying, 'I thought I was supposed to be having a good time
here,' " says Recht, who started taking hikers into the Santa Monica
Mountains 13 years ago to celebrate the New Year with food, music and
a midnight cheer.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to give people an alternate way to enjoy New Year's
without the booze," he adds, "but still have a great time."</TE>

<LD>The pulse of peace</LD>
<LD>   In a time when sabers are being rattled and armies mobilized, one
Los Angeles group is hawking an uplifting single with a pacifist
theme. "No money for the poor / but millions for war" repeats the
lilting refrain of "Mr. Man," the latest song by reggae ensemble
Caribbean Pulse to crack the charts in Jamaica. The number, featuring
the dueling vocals of Belize native Ezzy Judah and LaNiece McKay,
appears on the three-track "Jah Is My Rock" single as well as the
band's album, "Stand Up." Damian Marley contributes vocals on the
single's title track, and the album includes a vocal cameo by
dancehall favorite Tony Rebel on "Dry Your Eyes." Formed by guitarist
Billy Smith Jr., the band also includes Jason Smith on bass. For
information on the album, released by Hawthorne-based Irie Records,
visit www.caribbeanpulse.com.</LD>
<LD>   Guitarist for hire</LD>
<TE>   "I feel like such a fraud," says in-demand guitarist Josh
Klinghoffer, who recently wrapped up a series of Spaceland shows
backing L.A.'s preeminent scenester, singer-songwriter-producer Jon
Brion. Since dropping out of high school five years ago, Klinghoffer,
23, has been bouncing from gig to gig, first playing with former
Thelonious Monster leader Bob Forrest in the Bicycle Thief and later
as a touring guitarist for such bands as the Butthole Surfers. "[I
get gigs] through meeting people," he continues, "but it's all hype
-- it's not real." He's just modest: His electrifying, experimental
playing is honest and expressive, the perfect fit for bands more
interested in emotion than straightforward technique. He's currently
recording with Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciante for a
disc to be released by summer but, like many musicians, he says
that's not enough. "I want to put my own thing together," Klinghoffer
says, "but I'm just lazy."</TE>
<TE>   Fast forward</TE>
<TE>   Performances Jan. 11 and 12 will benefit the 11-year-old needle
exchange program Clean Needles Now. The Saturday show at the Garage
features five acts, including Brian Jonestown Massacre and Wayne
Kramer, and Sunday at Spaceland the Tyde and Nebula head the bill....
Bobby Bognar revealed his strummy side last week when he joined the
parade of L.A. pop performers who celebrated the holidays and bade
farewell to Third Thursday at Highland Grounds. Expect no such
restraint Saturday at the Troubadour, when he and his Piper Downs
bandmates open for the Young Dubliners. The Downs' latest release,
"Varying Degrees of Failure and Tunelessness," is as ironic as the
band's live show is raucous.... Buchanan is not due to release its
debut album, on Ultimatum Records, until the spring, but the Jay
Buchanan-led foursome has earned a devout following in Orange County
and environs. The band brings its bracing rock and lyrical snap to
the Knitting Factory on Jan. 7.</TE>

<HD>Tenuous hold on the crown</HD>
<DH>With another 'Friends' season secure, NBC is 'Must See' --
for a while anyway.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Brownfield</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Throughout its unprecedented ratings dominance on Thursday night, NBC
functioned like a basketball dynasty that had the current stars of
the game and an uncanny ability to come up with the next phenom.
Beginning in 1984, with the "tent pole" shows of "Cosby" at 8 and
"Hill Street Blues" at 10, the network came to own the night. It
anointed everything from bona fide hits like "Family Ties," "Cheers"
and the drama "L.A. Law" to duds like "Caroline in the City" as "Must
See TV."</LD>
<LD>   It was a preposterous boast, but one that NBC was able to keep
believable for 18 years, most especially to the advertisers willing
to pay a premium for a 30-second commercial on the last night of the
week before young American consumers went out to spend money at the
mall and the cineplex.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement last weekend that NBC had renewed "Friends"
through a 10th season in 2003-2004 means the network will likely hold
on to this all-important Thursday-night throne for two more years.
But like the Lakers with a hobbled Shaquille O'Neal, NBC's vaunted
Thursday-night schedule had been looking vulnerable even before the
"Friends" deal was made.</LD>
<TE>   Thus, the news broke not so much with a bang as a qualified bang:
NBC had renewed "Friends," some of the spin went, but it was paying
through the nose to do so and was only buying itself an extra year
before the glory days are truly over. That's because, the reasoning
goes, nothing the network currently has on its schedule -- not
"Scrubs," not "Will &amp; Grace" -- can replace "Friends" in the way that
NBC has changed dance partners in the past, with "Seinfeld" cutting
in just as "Cheers" had grown tired. Similarly, "Friends," which
debuted as an 8:30 infant between the protective parenting of "Mad
About You" and "Seinfeld," became the 8 p.m. show when the network
dispatched "Mad About You" to lead off Sunday nights.</TE>
<TE>   But the stable is no longer this full. This isn't NBC's problem
alone. All four of the major networks are having trouble developing
breakout hit comedies. But in NBC's case, the struggle is more
noticeable, given the network's track record.</TE>
<TE>   "It's no secret, they articulate it to the creative community on a
regular basis: 'We need the next generation of hits,' " said Warren
Littlefield, NBC Entertainment president throughout much of the "Must
See" '90s and who now sells programming to the network as a producer.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday night is key in large part because movie studios use the
night to hawk their blockbusters. "The movie companies pay a premium
[to advertise]," said Bill Carroll, vice president/director for the
Katz Television Group, a consulting firm. "If the movie opens
Saturday or Friday, they can't say, 'Well, we'll advertise it next
week.' "</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the network reportedly agreed to pay as much as $10
million an episode (the lion's share going to the series' six cast
members, who already make $1 million a week) to keep "Friends."</TE>
<TE>   This despite the fact that the network doesn't own the series and
will lose money by keeping it on the air, though at least one
high-ranking source at NBC disputed the notion that the show had
become a giant loss leader.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Zucker, NBC's current entertainment chief, was unavailable
for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Getting another year out of "Friends" (albeit 18 episodes, half a
dozen fewer than the desired 24) means that Zucker can still credibly
tell advertisers that NBC has a hold on the core 18-to-49-year-old
viewership on Thursday night, despite inroads made by CBS, which has
been competitive with "Survivor" at 8 and surpasses NBC at 9 with
"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation," the most-watched show on
television.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, NBC still has the tent poles at 8 and 10 with "Friends" and
"ER," respectively, but the latter medical drama, signed through
2004, has seen its ratings diminish a bit, due in part to cast
departures and more significantly because its lead-ins are not as
strong.</TE>
<TE>   "CBS has made [Thursday night] a real game," Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   NBC is hardly alone in encountering difficulty developing the next
sitcom hit. And one of the remarkable things about "Friends" is that,
10 years later, no new thing has come along to supplant it.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, if "Friends" is the only series standing between NBC's
exalted past and its worrisome future, the show is providing an odd
postscript to the "Must See" years. Unlike previous hits such as "Mad
About You," "Family Ties" or "The Cosby Show," "Friends" has actually
grown more popular in its autumn years, averaging 26 million viewers
in last month's November ratings sweeps -- its best November since
1996. This despite various plot turns (Monica and Chandler getting
married; Rachel having Ross' baby) that suggest the show has "jumped
the shark," the popular phrase that describes a series experiencing
story fatigue.</TE>
<TE>   "This show started jumping sharks three at a time -- they had the
baby, they had the marriage," said Robert Thompson of the Center for
the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University. And yet,
Thompson notes, "Friends" "is still a pretty competent comedy.</TE>
<TE>   "You compare it to where 'Murphy Brown' was in its baroque
declining years. They're still able to tell a pretty amusing story
that's still funnier than most comedies on network television."</TE>
<TE>   "The audience has made a tremendous bond with those characters,"
Littlefield said. At the same time, however, "the greatest difficulty
in following a 'Friends' is that [the new show will be] compared to
'Friends.' If you followed 'Friends' with Season One of 'Seinfeld,'
it wouldn't look as good as 'Seinfeld' in its heyday."</TE>
<TE>   During Littlefield's tenure at NBC, "Cheers" was exiting the
stage. Fortunately for him, the network had two comedies about to
bloom: "Frasier" and "Seinfeld."</TE>
<TE>   "The tremendous concern when 'Cheers' went away was, do we have
the players, do we have the goods to hold on to a signature night?"
As it turned out, they had "Seinfeld," then in its first full season
on the air after dying a thousand deaths in network meetings and
among test audiences.</TE>
<TE>   This season, NBC has been hard-selling "Scrubs" as a "Friends"
heir apparent, airing it Thursday nights at 8:30, where it loses an
average 30% of the "Friends" audience. The show, in its second
season, has the bells and whistles of a sitcom that might speak to
the same 18-to-49-year-old viewers who also watch "Friends"; young
doctors coming of age at a hospital, starring a sensitive cute guy
with mussed hair in a show that blends hyper-reality with the
requisite amount of pop culture referencing.</TE>
<TE>   Can "Scrubs" lead off Thursday night for NBC in 2004? One thing is
for certain: The other networks would love to see them try.</TE>
<TE>   "Ultimately they don't need the next 'Friends,' " Carroll said of
NBC, "they need the next great comedy. A reason for viewers to watch.
They need to have it in place for a while, for people to become
accustomed to the show. That was the intention with 'Scrubs.' "</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, during the November sweeps, a wedding on "Will &amp; Grace"
carried the show to its second-largest audience ever, as Grace,
played by Debra Messing, got married to a character played by Harry
Connick Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Once seen as daring, the show about the relationship between an
openly gay man and a heterosexual woman could be the most viable
option NBC has for Thursday nights at 8, 7 Central.</TE>
<TE>   "The real question now is, where is the critical development of
that show going to be?" Carroll said. "Now that they've married her
off, where is the show's focus?"</TE>
<TE>   And NBC's focus? To be sure, competition is only growing stiffer,
with cable channels continuing to eat into the broadcast networks'
hold on viewers. For NBC, the challenge is to keep being NBC. With an
extra year to keep the "Must See" bloodline going, the task is
slightly less urgent. But as Thompson said: "It's almost as though
NBC has gotta keep the parent alive until one of the kids is able to
support the rest of the family."</TE>

<LD>Back to the real business</LD>
<LD>   So Valley real estate prices just went up. Rocker Duff McKagan
(Guns N' Roses, Loaded) recently returned to Sh'Oaks after attending
business school in Seattle. McKagan came back to California to work
with his former bandmates Slash, Gilby Clarke and Matt Sorum, a.k.a.
the real Guns N' Roses....</LD>
<LD>   And I ran into that "Charmed" hottie Rose MacGowan, a famous
former club kid, on Ventura Boulevard on her way to a slickster nail
salon in Studio City. She says she fancies the Hollywood bar Star
Shoes.... Speaking of Star Shoes, check out Friday's Funky Sole
night. Only the rarest 7-inch vinyl will do.</LD>
<TE>   A treat for Deadsy fans</TE>
<TE>   Deadsy fans got a treat on Sunday, when the rockers raged at
Dragonfly in Hollywood. The band toured for six months this year with
the likes of Papa Roach, Korn and Taproot.... The club Hot Pants
returns on Jan. 18 to Mr. T's Bowl in Highland Park with loads of
live rock and jive.</TE>
<TE>   Options for New Year's Eve</TE>
<TE>   The spirit of Betty Blowtorch singer Bianca Halstead will be in
the house at the Whisky on New Year's Eve, as Nashville Pussy returns
to headline a show. Halstead was supposed to play with the band last
year but died just weeks before in a New Orleans car crash....If
you've got money to burn on New Year's Eve, Deep and Forty Deuce are
offering luxury packages to ring in the new year (up to
$6,000)....And Steve Dimon of D.A.S.K. Productions, who rocks Joya on
Saturdays in Beverly Hills, is hosting his annual Beverly Hilton NYE
blowout.</TE>
<TE>   Blowout benefit</TE>
<TE>   Teenacide Records is sponsoring two shows: the Shakes and the
Blondes at Spaceland on Jan. 3 and Viva La Megababes at Bigfoot Lodge
on Jan. 8....</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 5, join promoter Ricky Vodka at a blowout benefit at
Goldfingers for 4100 club doorman Kane, who has leukemia. Vodka, who
plays guitar in Motochrist, is also directing a film for the
Kottonmouth Kings.</TE>
<TE>   New Friday night at Fenix</TE>
<TE>   Promoter Gregg Wadley and partners Dave and Brad Weida are
launching a new Friday night at the newly revamped Fenix room at the
Argyle Hotel. So chic.... Got jiggy with DJ Senor Amor at a Three
Clubs Christmas party. Senor DJs Mondays on the downtown Standard's
rooftop. Oh, behave.</TE>

<HD>From 'plex to palace: A tour</HD>
<DH>Deco, digital or in disrepair -- the new and old theaters
that serve our movie mecca might just redefine your filmgoing
experience.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Rommelmann</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>That Los Angeles was built on the back of the movie business is
axiomatic. That it is a cultural crazy quilt, ditto. The mystery is
how these two realities reduced most of our moviegoing to a tiny
screen in a multiplex in a shopping mall.</LD>
<LD>   Or maybe not such a mystery: Gone are the days when the theater
down the street could survive with one or two screens. In the
contemporary Darwinian era, the big fish eat the little fish, as when
the Regal chain of theaters recently subsumed the United Artists and
Edwards chains, giving Regal almost 6,000 screens nationally, and
hundreds in the Southland. Paradoxically, more screens mean fewer
choices, with most big chains showing whatever movie with teen/scream
appeal that was released last Friday.</LD>
<LD>   It's a zero-sum game for the moviegoer who craves beauty with
their culture, comfort with the popcorn. Shall we capitulate and see
a lousy movie at the googolplex? Or bow out entirely and wait for
that hot documentary only playing at one art house all the way across
town to come out on DVD?</LD>
<TE>   Luckily for Angelenos, the answer is neither. This is where movies
as we know them were born, and just because Philip Anschutz (the
billionaire who owns Regal) wants to herd us into his domain doesn't
mean we have to go. Los Angeles has as many settings to see films as
there are films to see. Below is an in-depth look at all there is to
celebrate about getting out of the house and into L.A.'s movie
houses, especially during this season of blockbuster (and other)
holiday releases.</TE>
<TE>   ArcLight Hollywood, 6360 Sunset Blvd., Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   The original Cinerama Dome was a very cool spot. A geodesic dome
built in 1963, it featured a wraparound screen that was the place to
see anything filmed in Cinemascope or starring James Coburn. Even
when the ceiling tiles were falling on patrons' heads, it had style.
Several years ago, ArcLight revamped the Dome -- and what a vamp job:
Even the breezeway is dramatic, all soaring asymmetrical steel and
glass. The sweeping lobby features a glossy gift shop, a full
restaurant and bar and a desk where you can get an ArcLight
membership, which is free and helps you accumulate points toward
merchandise and tickets. The concessions are quasi-gourmet: a sausage
baguette, real butter on the popcorn, homemade caramel corn. The
ushers seem superfluous, unless you've reserved seats, which you can
do. And what seats: deep and plush, with enough legroom for Kobe
Bryant and set up stadium-style. The screens (two in the Dome, 14 in
the ArcLight) are gargantuan and super-crisp, and you could feel the
intensity of the Dolby sound during a preview for "The Lord of the
Rings: The Two Towers" down to your bones. The ArcLight hosts live
events, the bathrooms sparkle and everything is orchestrated so that
going to the movies becomes a holistic experience, so long as you are
punctual: Management will not let you into the movie once previews
have started.</TE>
<TE>   AMC Media North 6, 770 N. 1st St., Burbank</TE>
<TE>   People like this theater behind the Burbank Ikea because of the
loveseat-style seating: The arms of all the chairs go up, which means
when the theaters are less than full you can sprawl across several, a
couch potato's home-away-from-home. But the fun stops there. The
lobby of this six-plex has garish, soiled carpeting and a fake butter
smell so pernicious my throat swelled. While snacks are the usual
(sodas, candy, popcorn), the concessions area is exceptionally
filthy, with drifts of popcorn on the floor and servers who pull on
their plastic sanitary gloves with their teeth. The screen is fine --
not big, not small -- but the sound is abrasive and without subtlety.
This AMC branch makes use of something called National Cinema
Network's Movie Tunes, which promotes albums that are "in stores
now!" before running a bunch of ads for off-brand electronics. This,
before the eight movie trailers, played for a predominantly teenage
crowd which laughed hardest for "The Hot Chick." Amazingly, none of
this gets one in the mood for a movie, no matter how comfortable the
seats are.</TE>
<TE>   Vista Theater, 4473 Sunset Drive, Los Feliz</TE>
<TE>   Locals adore this 75-year-old theater at the juncture of Hollywood
and Sunset boulevards for its beauty, comfort and choice in films.
The facade is ornate Spanish, the theater itself lavish
Egyptian-Deco, with carved serpents and sarcophagi, inverted-pyramid
chandeliers of opaque glass and, looming over the audience, busts of
Egyptian maidens with Mona Lisa stares. Several years ago every other
row of seats was pulled out, meaning a yard of spare legroom. The
seats are very comfortable, the screen is wall to wall and the
picture and sound quality are excellent. There are always first-run
flicks, and they're almost always right in step with what the arty
Los Feliz-Silver Lake crowd wants to see.</TE>
<TE>   Landmark's Rialto, 1023 S. Fair Oaks Ave., South Pasadena</TE>
<TE>   Recognized by the National Registry of Historic Places, this
"Spanish baroque with Egyptian touches" theater opened in 1925 and
once featured vaudeville. Like a grande dame who's lost that ingenue
glow, the Rialto retains its glamour, reservedly. The sea-toned tiles
may be cracked and the azure and carnelian woodwork may have dulled,
but they are still marvelous to come upon for their anachronistic
craftsmanship in a nation of teal-and-fuchsia mass-produced
multiplexes. The Rialto shows exclusively art-house fare and the
occasional midnight movie. The seats of this large theater are of
so-so comfort, with enough if not ample legroom. That is, if you sit
below. Make your way up to the balcony and it's 1940: The wood
floorboards creak ominously; the seats are deep and of cracked
leather; and the projector's blue light breaks the darkness and
bounces back and over the mesmerized faces of those in the front row.
Those who've seen "The Player" will recognize the Rialto: It's where
Tim Robbins meets and kills Vincent D'Onofrio.</TE>
<TE>   Academy 6 Cinemas, 1003 E. Colorado Blvd., Pasadena</TE>
<TE>   Less frilly than other Laemmles, this Pasadena six-plex, popular
with local seniors and teens, shows a strong and consistent roster of
independent and foreign films, usually 12 at a time, some in double
feature, some by separate admission. Sure, the seats are a little
squeaky and, yes, the two downstairs theaters look like college
lecture halls, but the upstairs theaters have balconies, the place is
clean and, for the procrastinators among us, you can catch all those
art films you meant to see but missed at the Laemmle up the street,
and for about half the price.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific's Hastings 8, 355 N. Rosemead Blvd., Pasadena</TE>
<TE>   If the thought of finding a place to park in Pasadena makes you
weepy, drive a few miles east to the low-gloss mall Hastings Ranch,
where you will find Pacific's Hastings. This eight-plex does not feel
like a Los Angeles venue but a theater tucked behind a bowling alley
in the shadow of the mountains -- which it is. There are pinball and
video machines in the lobby, the usual concession goodies and eight
theaters showing mainstream fare. The seats are covered in a thick
pile that puts one in mind of suburban dens and La-Z-Boys. And
speaking of which: The chairs in the two larger theaters
semi-recline! Hastings is not sophisticated and is not trying to be.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific's the Grove Stadium 14, 189 the Grove Drive, 3rd Street
and Fairfax Avenue, Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   The concept of a behemoth mall being slapped onto the back of ye
olde rickety Farmers Market was rather distressing. And yet the Grove
puts a cheerful face on corporate consumerism, with a sleek outdoor
shopping village that, especially decked out as a winter wonderland,
proves a pleasant place to promenade. The movie complex looks like
the lobby of the Bellagio, with marble floors, a guest services desk
and liveried concierges. The 14 screens draw in unpredictable
numbers: I have been shut out of all three new-release features on a
Friday night and the next day been one of a handful of viewers. The
stadium-style seating is plush and comfy, with lots of legroom and
dedicated spots for wheelchairs. The front rows are a bit close to
the big screen, which is at eye level (no looking up) and whose
picture is crisp. The movies are a mix of art-house and commercial,
in tune with what a gazillion shoppers want.</TE>
<TE>   New Beverly Cinema, 7165 Beverly Blvd., Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   For nine years before this revival house opened in 1978, it was an
X-rated theater, and today the New Beverly retains a certain
porn-house aura: The seats are dilapidated, the floors sticky, the
air still and tangy. And yet the New Beverly is arguably the best
revival house in Los Angeles, showing double bills that change every
other day, everything from "Don't Look Back" to "Back to the Future,"
Fritz Lang to Bob Zemeckis, and a last chance to see last year's big
movies, foreign and domestic, on a big screen. Not that the screen is
in very good shape; it's sort of grainy. But nowhere else in town can
you get this kind of consistently intrepid and creative programming
for six bucks, for both features.</TE>
<TE>   Los Feliz 3, 1822 N. Vermont Ave., Los Feliz</TE>
<TE>   There are good and bad things about the Los Feliz. The good: It's
next door to an excellent independent bookstore (Skylight) and within
a block of a dozen eateries and bars; the movies are almost always of
special note or quality; and, with rare exceptions, they all start at
the same time -- 1:40, 4:20, 7 and 9:40 -- which makes it easy to
show and go. Now the bad: Since the seats in the main theater were
reconfigured, there are arguably no good seats, and the screen feels
uncomfortably close. The smallest theater is so tiny it's earned the
nickname "the shower curtain," and finding a parking spot within 10
blocks on weekends can flay your last nerve. Still, the choice in
films is choice and in tune with locals' tastes; what is lost in
presentation is made up for in convenience.</TE>
<TE>   American Cinematheque at the Egyptian Theatre, 6712 Hollywood
Blvd., Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   So, you'd like not to feign fluency in film, not to look panicky
or blank when someone starts talking about John Ford or "The Golden
Voyage of Sinbad," but you feel it's just too late? Go get yourself a
membership to American Cinematheque, where the film's the thing. This
hub for cinephiles shows different movies daily, sometimes several.
There are goofy comedies and sober documentaries; there are tributes
and retrospectives, often featuring a live appearance by the star or
director or auteur. The theater -- the old Egyptian, refurbished --
is swank, with just about the prettiest ceiling going; the chairs
feel like airline seats, with high headrests and as much legroom as
in business class; the screen is large, the picture excellent. The
concessions area is sort of second-rate, but no one cares: They're
here to see the movie. While "American Cinematheque" sounds a little
highfalutin, the place is not precious or academic but a serious
celebration of film. Go.</TE>
<TE>   Grauman's Chinese, 6925 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   In the beginning, there was Grauman's Chinese, and every person
who came to Hollywood went to stand in the shoeprints of John Wayne
and Marilyn Monroe and to breathe in what was left of the Golden Age
of Hollywood's fairy dust. Then Grauman's became a Mann's, and the
place was just dusty, if still majestic and with one of the largest
screens in town. Enter Hollywood &amp; Highland, and yet another
incarnation of Grauman's. Gone is the exterior's Chinese red; in are
ecru and electronic signage. Still, the interior is as dazzling as
ever: 2,200 bright ruby seats, a spectacular starburst chandelier and
a palpable sense that movie stars were here. The screen is enormous,
the sound thunderous; this is definitely the place you want to see
the latest flying wizard-spaceship flick.</TE>
<TE>   Nuart Theater, 11272 Santa Monica Blvd., West L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Militantly independent, the Nuart never shows a film that is not
provocative, cerebral and/or outrageous. When the new "Solaris"
recently hit theaters, the Nuart showed the Tarkovsky original.
Obscure yet worthy foreign films and documentaries often get their
only L.A. run at the Nuart and, lest you think the place takes itself
very seriously, there are also 3-D and animation festivals and
midnight showings of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" and other cult
hits, such as "The Evil Dead" and "Clockwork Orange." While not
plush, the theater (built around 1930 as a screening room) implies
that old-school pact that, once you step into that darkness, you will
be transported, for two hours, outside of time. The crowd leans
toward film erudition and a contrary opinion on the outcome of the
2000 presidential election.</TE>
<TE>   Laemmle's Sunset 5, 8000 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   This Laemmle theater in the Virgin Megastore complex is easily a
contender for best selection of independent and commercial films in
all of Los Angeles. Filmgoers of a certain stripe -- namely, those
who follow film and eagerly await the next Alexander Payne-Todd
Haynes-Spike Jonze flick -- know that what they want to see is going
to be here first. The theaters may not be big, but they are clean and
the quality of the picture and sound are swell. There is one big
obstacle, however, to falling in love with the Sunset 5, and that is
the underground parking lot, a facility with a claustrophobically low
ceiling and exhaust fumes so thick and noxious you feel as though
you're sliding down into your concrete coffin.</TE>
<TE>   Beverly Center Cineplex Odeon Theatres, 8500 Beverly Blvd., Los
Angeles</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to find nice things to say about the 13 theaters atop
the Beverly Center, at the corner of La Cienega Boulevard. The
screens are small, the theaters not especially comfortable, the
general mien is a bit grubby, the movies themselves the epitome of
mainstream, with the occasional token art film. The only reason to
go, really, is if you've burned out on shopping but your partner has
not.</TE>
<TE>   Loew's Cineplex Century Plaza Cinema, 2040 Avenue of the Stars,
Century City</TE>
<TE>   A big, Big, BIG screen begs the showing of the latest "Star Trek"
adventure and re-releases of epics, such as last year's "Apocalypse
Now Redux." The antithesis to the nearby AMC Century City 14, this
four-plex never feels crowded (though lines can be long), and the
fare, while commercial, never insults your intelligence. The complex,
which also houses the Shubert Theatre, is open and elegant, and if
you'd like to check it out, do so before February, when the entire
structure is slated for demolition.</TE>
<TE>   Laemmle's Fairfax, 7097 Beverly Blvd., Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   This theater on the corner of Beverly Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue
had fallen on hard times and was showing discounted double-features
until, several years ago, it was swooped up by Laemmle. The place has
been spiffed up, there's a faux-Deco thing going on in the lobby and
the selection in this three-plex is consistently intrepid. There are
always six movies (some shown in double-feature), including indies
making a two-week stand before disappearing into oblivion; film
festival darlings, like 2001's "The American Astronaut"; little pics
looking for distributors; foreign films; and documentaries. There are
midnight shows, notably "Hedwig and the Angry Inch" with live cast
and sing-along every fourth Friday, which attracts scads of
Hed-heads. Theaters 1 and 3 are fairly small, and the comfort factor
less than optimal, as the screens are skewed left or right. The
center theater, by contrast, is large, with a nice big screen and --
look up -- an intricately stenciled ceiling.</TE>
<TE>   Aero Theater, 1328 Montana Ave., Santa Monica</TE>
<TE>   You would think that an independent theater tucked amid the pasta
shops and Pilates studios of Montana Avenue would be embraced by the
locals. For whatever reasons, the Aero, built in 1939 and with a
great old neon sign, is not. This is not to say the management is not
trying: there's a kids' matinee on the weekends, a fairly new art
house film every night and special benefit screenings to bring in the
crowds -- who are not coming. One reason may be the lack of parking;
another, the small-town feel: this is the only theater I know that
has a fish tank in the lobby and, behind the concessions stand, a
household refrigerator, with a shopping list affixed by a magnet. But
the theater itself is a pretty teal with Deco touches, the screen of
a nice size and quality. Go before it goes under and becomes a chain
you complain about.</TE>
<TE>   Landmark's NuWilshire, 1314 Wilshire Blvd., Santa Monica</TE>
<TE>   Not particularly pretty, not particularly clean and, boy, the
place could use new carpeting. Nevertheless, the NuWilshire always
features indie or just-to-the-left-of-commercial pics, and the two
theaters themselves are intimate and nicely old-fashioned: a narrow
center aisle, pleated fabric on the walls, sconces. The screen takes
up the entire front wall, the picture is crisp and the sound is loud
and clear. (Though not, perhaps, loud enough for some older patrons,
who make up the bulk of daytime audience. The crowd skews younger at
night). A nice place to see a matinee on a rainy day and, added
bonus, there are Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream bars at the snack counter.</TE>
<TE>   AMC Century City 14, 10250 Santa Monica Blvd., Century City</TE>
<TE>   Step right up if you want to see a movie at the most heavily
attended theater in Los Angeles. Although this massive outdoor mall
has its quirky touches (e.g., independent vendors and non-chain
restaurants), the 14-plex is straight-ahead commercial, with a
predominately young crowd that appreciates the aesthetic credo "no
neon too bright, no sound too loud." The place can be a zoo on
weekends: Tickets sell out (you can reserve ahead), getting popcorn
takes 30 minutes and woe to the woman who needs to use the loo in a
hurry. Of the 14 screens, Nos. 1 through 4 are the largest, with good
screen, sound and seat quality in all theaters.</TE>
<TE>   Laemmle's Monica 4-Plex, 1332 2nd St., Santa Monica</TE>
<TE>   A little down at the heels, this Laemmle's nevertheless shows an
excellent selection of art-house, documentary and intellectually
vigorous films. The stylish if slightly shabby lobby is awash with
fliers touting "Derrida" and the latest Almodovar. The crowd tends to
be older during the day, Boho by night. There's a swell candy
selection (Toblerone! Penuttles!), the seats are comfortable, the
screen and sound fine. Of all the art-house theaters on the Westside,
this one has the widest and most adventurous film lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Laemmle's Grande 4-Plex, 345 S. Figueroa St., downtown L.A.</TE>
<TE>   This four-plex beneath the Marriott hotel like the embodiment of
teen gloom. The lobby is ratty and hung with a young Bell Gardens
artist's unframed watercolors -- spooky, self-conscious images of
emaciated, doe-eyed youths ripping open their skin. The theater shows
a mix of art-house and commercial films for the few tourists, punks
and schlubs who show up. The floors are sticky, the seats have the
quarter-circle, flip-up desks you had in grade school and the screen
and sound are serviceable. It's a good place to watch a movie while
wondering what you're doing here.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific's El Capitan, 6838 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   Restored several years ago to its original '40s glitz, the
candy-colored El Capitan shows exclusively Disney or other Buena
Vista movies, sometimes preceded by a kid-centric and extravagant
floorshow. The balcony is the place to sit; the multiple curtains add
to the anticipation and, if you're bringing folks from out of town
and/or the grandkids, it might be worth the $23 per person.</TE>
<TE>   The Bridge: Cinema de Lux and Imax Theatre at Howard Hughes
Center, 6081 Center Drive, Westchester</TE>
<TE>   The Promenade at Howard Hughes Center, an outdoor mall off the San
Diego Freeway near LAX, is so spiffy and generic it could be an
industrial park in Houston or Short Hills, N.J. On top is the Bridge,
a multiplex that looks like an op-art airport, or the lobby of a
hotel as rendered by the magazine Wallpaper. The place is
scrupulously clean (no small feat considering the crowd is pretty
young), the theaters -- including an Imax six stories tall --
spectacularly plush. The screens are wall to wall, the Dolby sound is
the best of any local theater save the Arc- Light, the chairs are
supple black leather, with high headrests and fat armrests and a
comfort level set at "cradle." There's a cocktail lounge that looks
as though Esquivel should be playing and a snack bar where, in
addition to regular concession fare, you can order chicken or pizza
or frozen yogurt to take into the theater.</TE>
<TE>   Magic Johnson Theatres, Crenshaw Mall, Baldwin Hills, (323)
290-5900</TE>
<TE>   The Magic Johnson Development Corp.'s mission statement reads:
"Dedicated to serve the educational, health and social needs of our
community." One of the most visible ways Johnson has done this
locally is to open the Magic Johnson Theatres, in South Central, an
area that was woefully short of movie venues. Located in the Crenshaw
Mall, this 15-plex with all the amenities shows mostly commercial new
releases, though there's also the occasional smaller film and
documentary. While most multiplexes' bottom line is the bottom line,
this chain (there are four more across the country) seems dually
committed to showing films of both cultural relevance and
entertainment value to the community, which is mostly minority.
Johnson, a great entertainer on and off the court, understands that
film is America's common language and that going to the movies is a
treasured pastime for every community.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Bill Pope, cinematographer ("The Matrix" series, "SpiderMan 2"):</LD>
<LD>   "You know those little black squiggles next to the names of the
theaters? Those indicate what sort of sound systems they have, like a
black triangle for THX. If the theater doesn't have a black squiggle,
I'm not going.</LD>
<LD>   "I also like a great big theater full of people. You go to a lot
of screenings, at the Directors Guild or ASC [American Society of
Cinematographers], and the places are full of industry people who
have no reactions whatsoever; they're absolutely cold, they're all
thinking, 'I could have done it better than that clown.' I don't go
to those things anymore. I want to go to huge theaters with masses of
ordinary Joes."</LD>
<TE>   Mary Sweeney, producer-editor and screenwriter ("Mulholland
Drive," "The Straight Story"):</TE>
<TE>   "I almost only go out to the movies in Wisconsin, where I spend
the summers. It's too much of a production here: traffic, parking,
being in some giant mall. In Madison, you park in front, no lines,
good seating.... I try to avoid theaters in L.A., and, shame on me,
we [Sweeney lives with director David Lynch] have a pretty good home
viewing setup.</TE>
<TE>   "But I did go to the [ArcLight Cinema's] Cinerama Dome for
'Lawrence of Arabia' and that was a very good experience. The
overture played before, the print was beautiful and the sound just
great. It was a gang of fifth-grade moms in the middle of the day,
middle of the week; so indulgent. I think a matinee is the solution
for me ... with company. Makes it almost as accessible as Wisconsin."</TE>
<TE>   Larry Karaszewski, producer ("Auto Focus") and screenwriter ("Ed
Wood," "The People vs. Larry Flynt"):</TE>
<TE>   "I'm looking for the biggest screen the movie's playing on, which
usually means the Mann's Chinese or the ArcLight. The ArcLight is
also good because you can reserve seats. When you have little kids,
it's a bit of a drag to get to a movie super-early, so going where
you have a seat reserved, you can get there three minutes ahead of
the movie.</TE>
<TE>   "I also go a lot to the American Cinematheque, which is completely
awesome and has a great screen; the films playing there get me out of
the house. I feel like the Cinematheque is a place that is not
appreciated enough in L.A., or not by a big enough audience. I see
the same 20 people there every time I go. But the theater I probably
go to most is Sunset 5, because they show the movies I want to see."</TE>
<TE>   Anne Thompson, Hollywood and film columnist (New York Magazine,
the London Observer):</TE>
<TE>   "During the week, I go to a lot of press screenings; the best
screening rooms are at the academy [Academy of Motion Picture Arts
and Sciences], and the Steve Ross Theatre at Warner Bros. On the
weekends, I like to take my daughter to LACMA [Los Angeles County
Museum of Art], where you sit with a lot of cinephiles and see
retrospectives by filmmakers like Terry Gilliam, with him speaking
afterward. "There's also this whole indie circuit of smart people who
go see smart movies, which is especially in force at the Nuart. I saw
'The Trials of Henry Kissinger,' and it was this huge scene of every
lefty leftover in Los Angeles, all preaching to the choir. I also saw
Mike Figgis' digital movie, 'Time Code.' He was in the back of the
theater, mixing the sound to go along with the four stories playing
simultaneously on the screen. I think it was harrowing for him, but
it was fabulous."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Pullman, actor ("Independence Day," "Lost Highway"):</TE>
<TE>   "I can't stand the thought that I am a bought person in a
commercial theater watching a commercial movie, which means a movie
at a mall can be a deflating experience. I'd rather put up with a few
problems with projection and sound. I like the Vista. Even if you see
a commercial movie there, it suddenly looks like an art-house movie,
because of the setting. I also have a thing for the place because it
looks so much like the Majestic, in Hornell, N.Y., where I grew up.
It has sconces, and sconces to me are what sell a theater. That and
worn velvet. That whole thing of putting your head back and feeling
the cord on your neck and wondering if you were going to get
ringworm.</TE>
<TE>   "My family and I are also big boosters for the hometown. To us,
Hollywood is still a small town with a bad rep. We go to the ArcLight
to support something we hope is going to work. The whole idea is so
beautiful, they've got things to eat and the people working there
really seem happy working there; they look as though they believe in
what they're doing, rather than the glazed-eye look of someone who
doesn't. It's hard to like what you're doing when you're popping
popcorn in a mall."</TE>

<HD>Sona menu flavored by ambition</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Traffic is roaring  down La Cienega Boulevard this evening, but here
inside, the long-awaited Sona  it's as hushed and serene as a Zen
retreat.</LD>
<LD>   Sona is the project of the husband-and-wife team of David and
Michelle Myers. David, a  former executive sous-chef at Patina, most
recently showed great promise at Jaan, the high-concept restaurant
inside L'Ermitage hotel. Michelle has been a pastry chef at  Spago
and Patina.</LD>
<LD>   Architect Anthony Eckelberry created a strong design profile for
this intimate, contemporary restaurant. The dining room's austere
palette -- chalky whites and grays accented by black -- is softened
by the luxurious textures of leather and fabric.</LD>
<TE>   Sona's ambitious menu lists eight "firsts," eight "seconds" and
eight "thirds" (desserts). On this opening menu, the firsts include a
gratin of mussels, Spanish ham and frothy almond milk; and a terrine
of foie gras as intricately crafted as a piece of jewelry. Miniature
salt-roasted beets splashed with a warm and very sour vinaigrette are
tucked beneath bouquets of mache. Potato leek soup comes with crispy
potatoes and dried prosciutto garnished with celery leaves.</TE>
<TE>   It's all pretty cerebral, and the seconds are even more so. You
can order, for example, glazed Santa Barbara prawns in a preserved
turmeric emulsion with a mysterious, dry musty taste that sets off
the sweetness of the prawns. Kobe beef appears as tenderloin paired
with short ribs and a lovely celery root and shiso leaf salad.
Chicken comes dressed up with a pearl onion fricassee, salty collard
greens and smashed La Ratte potatoes.  Sauces are drawn or splattered
across the plate, ingredients arranged with precision.</TE>
<TE>   Chef Michelle Myers brings an arsenal of techniques to her
desserts. Her hand-pulled strudel stuffed with spiced griottes (a
kind of cherry) is brilliantly paired with black beer ice cream. She
fills cannoli with fluffy mascarpone and heirloom Black Arkansas
apples. Crema Catalana appears in her mille-feuille with Minneola
tangerine sorbet.</TE>
<TE>   It's not an easy time to open such an ambitious high-end
restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Let's hope this one finds its audience.</TE>

<HD>HGTV out to prove it's not just garden variety</HD>
<DH>The channel plans to sow the seeds of its new lineup next
week.</DH>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stop and smell the Rose Parade on New Year's Day -- then stay tuned
for HGTV's procession of new shows and specials.</LD>
<LD>   After six years of watching viewership increase for its
nonexclusive parade telecast, Home &amp; Garden Television realized it
had a rosy opportunity to showcase itself.</LD>
<LD>   This year, it's taking full advantage.</LD>
<TE>   HGTV plans a daylong lineup for Jan. 1 that highlights how the
channel has evolved from its "how-to" beginning, said HGTV President
Burton Jablin.</TE>
<TE>   Besides introducing new series, including the landscaping
competition "Ground Rules!" and the budget-conscious "Design on a
Dime," HGTV will kick off its annual "Dream Home" contest. The prize
is a Florida house valued at $1.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to let people know that HGTV has a tremendous amount of
variety in its programming," Jablin said. "A lot of people might
think we're all gardening shows, or all what we call
'hammer-and-nails shows,' but we really have so much more."</TE>
<TE>   Instead of "hard-core how-to," the emphasis is on programs that
encourage a connection with viewers, Jablin said.</TE>
<TE>   "People are looking for more than step-by-step information; they
want an emotional involvement with what's going on," he said.
"There's a kind of vicarious thrill in watching how other people
create their living space and then use it."</TE>
<TE>   HGTV's commercial-free coverage of the Tournament of Roses Parade
begins at 8 a.m.</TE>

<HD>My Favorite Weekend: Constance Marie</HD>
<DH>A co-star in two TV series must develop a knack for
relaxation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carolyn Patricia Scott</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>TWO series, two television roles divided into one actress equals:
Constance Marie, who plays Nina in the PBS TV series "American
Family" and Angie in the ABC comedy "George Lopez."</LD>
<LD>   Progressive morning reading</LD>
<LD>   I start my day in bed with the newspaper, then I finish reading it
at the Literati Cafe in Brentwood. Generally, I try to be very
healthy and I love to drink organic coffee, so I have a half-decaf,
half-soy latte. I'm in the zone all week, so on weekends I eat
everything -- I have a waffle and eggs.</LD>
<TE>   Veggie dog and roses</TE>
<TE>   Later I might go to the Santa Monica Promenade and see a movie and
do a little shopping. Then I go to the corn-dog place in the mall.
I'm a vegetarian, so I have a veggie dog. I stopped eating meat about
six years ago, when I was working on the movie "Selena." During the
shoot, I had to hold a chicken for five hours -- if you hold it and
feel its little heart beating for hours, you just can't think about
eating it. I do eat fish and eggs to keep up my protein intake,
because when you're on location in Chicago or somewhere and you ask
for soy, they think you're insane.</TE>
<TE>   Then if this is my ideal weekend, I go to Pentola in Santa Monica
and have a Cosmopolitan and calamari or I might go to El Dorado in
Brentwood for the chips and guacamole; they are really good there.
And if this is my fantasy weekend, I have a pint of Haagen Daz ice
cream.</TE>
<TE>   If it's a Sunday, I go to Santa Monica Farmers Market -- you can
buy 20 roses for $6 -- there are great prices. Sometimes I take my
grand-goddaughter, Deja, to ride the ponies there.</TE>
<TE>   After tea, some spinach dumplings</TE>
<TE>   If I'm feeling sluggish, I go to ZenZoo Tea -- I'm addicted to
yerba mate or "the rooster." It's tea from Paraguay; I get it with
soy and honey with ice, to go. Sometimes I have spinach dumplings.
Two orders of them and boom -- you're ready to go.</TE>
<TE>   Yoga: I like the teacher</TE>
<TE>   If I'm feeling active, I may hike at Will Rogers (State Historic)
Park or take a yoga class to focus on something other than the
industry. My class? It's in my home -- I've got a yoga room.</TE>
<TE>   My teacher? He's my boyfriend, who teaches ballplayers -- like
members of the Phoenix Suns -- how to relax with yoga.</TE>
<TE>   But I'm a homebody, so more than anything, I love to come back
home and just lie in bed and relax.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>He works the late shift at Los Angeles' famed combination restaurant,
bar and bakery, Canter's. The Fairfax district deli that never closes
is always busy, and that's just how the man who "directs the traffic"
likes it: Part host, part maitre d', Carl Sammons handles the rich
and famous, the after-hours crowd and the regulars as smooth as --
well, a slice of Canter's New York-style cheesecake.</LD>
<LD>   Right from the start</LD>
<LD>   "I was raised up in a restaurant. My mother owned one back in
Texas, and I must have started working by the time I was 10; this is
what I do."</LD>
<TE>   Style</TE>
<TE>   This man on the move blends in with stylish diners day and night:
In white short-sleeved shirt, a slender black tie at his throat, in
black slacks and comfortable shoes, the 44-year-old Sammons is in
constant motion.</TE>
<TE>   Pick-me-up</TE>
<TE>   Sammons, a self-described five-shot-a-day diabetic, maintains his
frenetic pace by sipping fruit juice. "They've had the paramedics in
here a couple of times on the 7 p.m. to 4 a.m. shifts, when I've
gotten so busy that I forgot my juice."</TE>
<TE>   Work strategies</TE>
<TE>   "I try to get everybody where they need to go as fast as I can --
to the bar, seat at a booth, at a table, at the counter. I'm
constantly looking for open tables, you know, to speed things up."</TE>
<TE>   Confessions</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever I'm not doing something, I'm talking with co-workers,
keeping spirits up. And if it's really slow, you'll see me going from
waitress, to cook, to busboy, cupping my hands and calling out
"Ooooooo." Just making noise, it's something to do when you're bored.
It keeps spirits up until the crowd picks up."</TE>

<TE>   MUSEUM</TE>
<TE>   Give suiseki a chance</TE>
<TE>   It is rumored that viewing Japanese suiseki, or "viewing stones,"
can lift the spirit, stimulate the mind and purify the soul. Not a
bad way to start the new year. It beats joining a gym. The Huntington
hosts a six-day exhibition of suiseki stones -- meaning stones that
have been sculpted by the elements over many years. These water and
wind-carved rocks on view may or may not resemble familiar forms such
as mountains, waterfalls, islands and animals. See for yourself when
the exhibition opens tomorrow.</TE>
<TE>   Suiseki stones, Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical
Gardens, 1151 Oxford Road, San Marino. Friday-next Thursday, 10:30
a.m.-4:30 p.m. Closed New Year's Day. $4-$10. (626) 405-2100.</TE>
<TE>   MOVIES</TE>
<TE>   'Pianist' is latest from Polanski</TE>
<TE>   After performing the last live music heard over Polish radio
before the Nazi artillery struck, composer Wladyslaw Szpilman
remained in the Warsaw ghetto throughout the occupation, surviving
even when separated from those he loved. Adrien Brody plays Szpilman
in "The Pianist," Roman Polanski's drama based on the musician's
autobiography. Thomas Kretschmann, Frank Finlay and Maureen Lipman
co-star.</TE>
<TE>   "The Pianist," rated R for violence and brief strong language,
opens Friday in selected theaters.</TE>
<TE>   POP MUSIC</TE>
<TE>   Grooving on Flower</TE>
<TE>   As if the trendy Standard Hotel were spreading its rule northward
into the streets, the stretch of Flower Street between Fifth and
Sixth will be packed on New Year's Eve with upwards of 7,000 gyrating
aficionados of electronic music and the dancing life. Giant Village,

<TE>   'Hours' with the ladies</TE>
<TE>   Time is not on the side of the women of "The Hours," it is the
enemy. Through the writing of Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman),
director Stephen Daldry's multilayered film links the author to a
reader (Julianne Moore) in post-World War II Los Angeles, and a
contemporary "Mrs. Dalloway" (Meryl Streep) living on the brink in
New York City. Playwright David Hare adapted the Michael Cunningham
novel. Ed Harris, Toni Collette, Allison Janney, Stephen Dillane,
John C. Reilly, Miranda Richardson, Jeff Daniels and Claire Danes
also star.</TE>
<TE>   "The Hours," rated PG-13 for mature thematic elements, some
disturbing images and brief language, opens Friday in selected
theaters.</TE>
<TE>   JAZZ</TE>
<TE>   The singer, the songs</TE>
<TE>   Jazz singer Karrin Allyson was Grammy-nominated earlier this year

statuette, but the nomination has vaulted her to the top ranks of her
genre. Now, she's in</TE>

<TE>   new CD, "In Blue," her</TE>
<TE>   jazzy take on a collection of blues and blues-related tunes.
Starting tonight, she's performing at</TE>

<TE>   THEATER</TE>
<TE>   Here's the pitch</TE>
<TE>   A veteran Little League coach thinks winning is the point, not fun
and games. His new assistant, the dad of one of the team's less
gifted players, insists that it's not whether you win or lose, but
whether you have a good time playing. That's the setup for "Rounding
Third," which writer Richard Dresser based on some of his own
experiences coaching kids' baseball. With it, Dresser continues his
batting streak at Laguna Playhouse, which has produced three of his
comedies -- "Gun-Shy" and "Wonderful World" were the others -- in
just over 2 1/2 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Rounding Third," Laguna Playhouse, 606 Laguna Canyon Road, Laguna

<TE>   Older and wiser, the members of Jane's Addiction might have a
better handle on their demons than they did when the band arose from
the L.A. underground with its amazing amalgam of mystery and
hedonism, but the core unit of Perry Farrell, Dave Navarro and
Stephen Perkins, with new bassist Chris Chaney, still knows how to
tap the old Dionysian well, as they've shown in their periodic
reunions, making them a prime attraction on New Year's Eve.</TE>

<HD>A cultural underdog</HD>
<DH>O.C. art houses are on the wane but film fans persevere.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anne Valdespino</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It isn't hard to find offbeat and thought-provoking flicks in L.A.,
but drive south a bit and it's another story. As a friend once said,
"Being an art-film fan in Orange County is like being a liberal in
Texas: You'd better really want it."</LD>
<LD>   Having been both, I can understand the trepidation other Orange
County film fans are feeling these days.</LD>
<LD>   For a time in the '90s things were looking pretty good. We'd long
had a few classic indie art and foreign film houses to turn to -- the
Port in Corona Del Mar, the Balboa Theater in Newport Beach, the Bay
in Seal Beach -- when the then-dominant Edwards Cinemas chain
expanded its specialty offerings beyond Newport's venerable Lido to
its University site across from UC Irvine and then its South Coast
Village 3 and Town Center 4 complexes, both within walking distance
of South Coast Plaza.</LD>
<TE>   Film buffs started feeling positively heady with the birth of an
international film festival in Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Things got so rosy five years ago that Edwards folks teamed up
with South Coast Plaza honchos and South Coast Repertory and O.C.
Performing Arts Center execs to christen an Orange County Theater
District across from one of the nation's top shopping malls. They
showed a splashy movie trailer hyping the movie theaters and tony
nearby restaurants, and promised even more to come for the serious
film fan in the years ahead. We sipped champagne at the reception and
felt smug.</TE>
<TE>   Now I look back on that period as our cinematic Camelot, that one
brief shining moment when Orange County film fans felt inferior to
our northern neighbors no more.</TE>
<TE>   The Balboa closed a decade ago, one of many art and repertory
houses shuttered by the VCR revolution. We felt the loss, but with
the growth elsewhere, it seemed an aberration, not a warning sign.
Then the long-ailing Port died.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom really fell out when Edwards Cinemas filed for
bankruptcy two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   We fretted as several of their theaters were taken over by other
companies. Luckily, the Rancho Niguel and Brea Plaza, which came back
as Mann and Captain's Family theaters, respectively, still mix some
offbeat fare in with their mainstream stuff.</TE>
<TE>   Back at South Coast, there's one art-house complex where there had
been two.</TE>
<TE>   But we've still got the Lido (now a Laemmle Theatres house) and
Edwards University theaters (part of the Regal Cinemas chain), and
the Bay somehow holds on year after year.</TE>
<TE>   We continue to support film series at UCI and Chapman University,
and even though the ambitious Newport Beach film fest nearly went
belly up, it came back under new management. L.A. may still have
roughly twice the number of film societies and theaters where art,
indie and revival films are shown, but in a lot of ways we thrive on
our cultural underdog status.</TE>
<TE>   We cling to any sign that reinforces our belief that things will
get better.</TE>
<TE>   Now that we've believed our way into a World Series championship,
the hope for a few more O.C. art houses doesn't seem quite so Frank
Capra-esque. And it's worth it, hoping for more chances to experience
films like "La Vita e Bella" (Life Is Beautiful), "The Crying Game,"
"Like Water for Chocolate," "The Usual Suspects," and "Howards End,"
films that enlighten and inspire, hold a mirror up to the human
condition, make us think -- and, in rare instances, change our lives.</TE>

<LD>NEW Year's Eve is here, and you've decided to stay in with the kids.
Why not? It sure beats ditching that slob you don't want to kiss at
midnight at the grown-up bash. Here are suggestions for three parties
for the whole family with New Year's themes.</LD>
<LD>   Up all night</LD>
<LD>   Kids always ask, "Why can't I stay up late like the grown-ups?"
Capitalize on their fascination with a party exploring the mystery of
what happens in the middle of the night. Explain that most animals,
people, machines rest at night, but there are places where people
work at night -- hospitals, police stations, etc. In Spanish la
madrugada means the hours between midnight and morning. Get the kids
to invent their own word to describe the wee hours.</LD>
<TE>   Decor: Decorate with paper moons, stars and suns, black or blue
tablecloths contrasting with white and yellow ones.</TE>
<TE>   Food: The night before, cook a dish that takes all night to stew.
Make cookies in sun, moon or star shapes. Serve breakfast foods at
the end of the party to signal that you've made it through the night.</TE>
<TE>   Resources:  "The Greenwich Guide to Day and Night"; "What Makes
Day and Night," by Franklyn M. Branley; "Stellaluna," by Janell
Cannon; "Midnight Fairy Craft &amp; Party Book," by Tracy Marsh.</TE>
<TE>   Time passages</TE>
<TE>   Talk about how time is measured and about aging. Drag out the
photo albums and look at pictures of parents and grandparents. How
old are they in the pictures? What kinds of clothes were Grandma and
Grandpa wearing? Kids might dress up like their grandparents for the
party and play old-fashioned parlor games. Or, without looking at a
watch, guess how long it takes for three minutes to elapse.</TE>
<TE>   Decor: Dress up clocks in the house with ribbons, sprigs of holly,
tinsel. Wear all the watches you own at the same time. Set alarms to
go off at midnight.</TE>
<TE>   Food: Serve foods that need time to develop; note the contrast
between cucumbers and pickles, grapes and raisins. Make bread in the
bread machine or make your own pizza dough, allowing time for it to
rise, and top with aged cheeses, like parmesan and gouda.</TE>
<TE>   Resources: "The Story of Clocks and Calendars: Marking a
Millennium," by Betsy Maestro; "The Greenwich Guide to Measuring
Time," by Graham Dolan; "The Oxford Treasury of Time Poems," by
Michael Harrison and Christopher Stuart-Clark; "The Time Machine," by
H.G. Wells.</TE>
<TE>   Around the world</TE>
<TE>   Explain to the kids that the New Year is celebrated at different
times of the year in Israel, Iran and parts of Asia. In Vietnam
(where it's called Tet) and China, the New Year is greeted with
firecrackers, lion dances and festivals. In Scotland it's still on
Dec. 31-Jan. 1 but it's called Hagmanay.</TE>
<TE>   Decor: If your family has Scottish ancestry, find the tartan that
corresponds with your name on the Internet and print a sample. For a
Chinese New Year party, make lanterns and cutout dragons with
construction paper, set the table with rice bowls and chopsticks.
Parents give children "lucky" money, crisp new dollar bills presented
in red envelops.</TE>
<TE>   Food: Scones, shortbread and anything made with oats for New
Year's in Scotland, or Chinese or Vietnamese takeout.</TE>
<TE>   Resources:  "Happy New Year, Everywhere!" by Arlene Erlbach; "The
Story of the Jewish Calendar," by Azriel Eisenberg; "Christmas in
Britain," from World Book.</TE>

<LD>If words like "Quidditch," "Hogwarts" and "Hobbit" are uttered far
too often in your household nowadays, it may be time to expose the
family to some culture outside Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   Beginning Friday, the Japanese American Cultural and Community
Center will host a series of programs commemorating Japanese New
Year, or Oshogatsu, one of the Asian country's most significant
holidays. Arts and crafts, traditional dances and an exhibition of
greeting cards are among the events planned.</LD>
<LD>   "Many children are unaware of the customs that go along with
ethnic celebrations," says Kym Aoki, manager of community programs at
the Japanese American center. "They have so much else occupying their
time -- movies, video games, the Internet -- but we hope events like
this will help them understand different cultures."</LD>
<TE>   Oshogatsu, which begins in December and lasts through the first
week of January, is a time for the Japanese to wipe their slates
clean. Folks tidy up dwellings and work spaces, hoping to start the
upcoming year renewed.</TE>
<TE>   Mothers whip up special dishes such as tai (sea bream) to channel
good fortune into the home, and children play games that are only
brought out at this time of year.</TE>
<TE>   These games will be the centerpiece of Friday's events at the
center. Kids can learn how to make tako (kites), hagoita (paddles
used in a sport similar to badminton) and other toys at workshops
designed for ages 7 to 12. "It's a chance for them to see what other
kids their age are doing in other countries," Aoki says, "and maybe
they'll make some connections to the traditions that they follow
around the holidays, too."</TE>
<TE>   Festivities continue on Jan. 5 when the ceremonial first
performance of the year, or Kotohajime, plays out on the center's
plaza. The show will include rituals such as breaking a sake barrel
and shooting an arrow, performed by L.A.'s Kyudo Kai archery school,
accompanied by taiko drums. "Shooting the first arrow is very
symbolic," says Hirokazu Kosaka, the center's director of visual
arts, who will lead the fanfare. "The arrow is supposed to purify the
space."</TE>
<TE>   The day's highlights also include a Kabuki dance concert and the
opening of the shikishi (greeting card) exhibition. Dating back 1,000
years, the notes were originally meant to deliver poetry but are now
used to express any personal thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   Though Kosaka hasn't completed the display, he expects to showcase
more than 200 cards, made by local artists, celebrities and
dignitaries, reflecting their hopes for the new year. Just don't
expect to see any signed by a certain Mr. Potter.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What's on for Oshogatsu</TE>
<TE>   Where: All events held at the Japanese American Cultural and
Community Center complex: 244 S. San Pedro St., L.A.'s Little Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   Oshogatsu workshop: Friday and Monday, 10 a.m.-3 p.m. Center
members, $20; general admission, $25.</TE>
<TE>   Kotohajime celebration: Sunday, Jan. 5. Opening of shikishi
exhibition, 11 a.m.-4 p.m., free, runs through Feb. 2; first
performance of the year, 1-1:30 p.m., free; Kabuki dance concert, 3
p.m. Center members, $20; general admission, $22.</TE>

<KH>THEATER</KH>
<HD>The keeper of Kaufman's plays</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Michael Kuchwara</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Think of Anne Kaufman Schneider as a theatrical gatekeeper -- a
stylish, intelligent and wittily opinionated woman who is one of the
people you have to go through to put "You Can't Take It With You,"
"The Man Who Came to Dinner," "The Royal Family" or "Dinner at Eight"
on stage.</LD>
<LD>   Asked what type of control she exerts over these 20th century
classics, she smiles and says succinctly, "Plenty."</LD>
<LD>   As the daughter of playwright George S. Kaufman, Schneider is the
guardian of his literary estate, a cornucopia of nearly four-dozen
plays he co-wrote from the 1920s onward with such illustrious folk as
Moss Hart, Edna Ferber, Marc Connelly, Ring Lardner and more.</LD>
<TE>   These days, she is extolling the virtues of "Dinner at Eight," a
social comedy of manners and morals her father wrote with Ferber. The
play, a big Broadway hit in 1932 and a famous movie a year later, now
has resurfaced in a lavish revival by Lincoln Center Theater. It
features a cast of 27, one lap dog and seven separate sets.</TE>
<TE>   The 77-year-old Schneider, dressed casually in black pants and a
colorful blouse, sits in the living room of her East Side apartment
just off Madison Avenue. It's a formal space, floral print chairs and
a plush sofa. Theatrical memorabilia of her father are across the
entrance foyer hall in another room.</TE>
<TE>   But Kaufman's presence is felt as Schneider talks about his work,
which also included the direction of such big hits as "The Front
Page" and "Guys and Dolls," as well as many of his own plays.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he would be absolutely astonished by what has happened,"
Schneider says. "I don't think it occurred to him that his plays
would ever be done again. I don't think he ever thought very much
about them. He died in 1961 and, except for summer stock, there were
no revivals."</TE>
<TE>   Things changed in 1965 when Ellis Rabb, with his APA-Phoenix
Repertory Company, brought the Kaufman and Hart comedy "You Can't
Take It With You" back to Broadway. Rabb later cemented the
playwright's reputation with a well-received production of "The Royal
Family," which Kaufman also co-wrote with Ferber, and which starred
Eva Le Gallienne and Rosemary Harris.</TE>
<TE>   Schneider, a widow, often confers about possible projects with
Hart's widow, Kitty Carlisle Hart, who lives in the next block. "We
are very close and agree on everything -- and if we don't, we talk
about it until one of us gives in. She really is my best friend."</TE>

<LD>Jim Isermann: Lobby Wall: Isermann transforms the lobby and front
windows of the Hammer's office building into an inspiring playground
for the imagination. Around the marble stairway that takes visitors
from street level to the second-floor galleries, Isermann has affixed
vinyl wallpaper whose abstract pattern is at once wildly complicated
and rigorously consistent. It consists of snugly abutted squares and
rectangles that resemble empty picture frames or the borders of
35-millimeter slides, with rounded outer corners and right-angled
inner edges.</LD>

<LD>I must take exception with the article written by Robert Niles on the
show "Aladdin" at Disney's California Adventure (" 'Aladdin' strives
for a little magic," Dec. 19).</LD>
<LD>   While Niles does admit the show is better than most theme park
entertainment, he would have you think it's not all that great.
Although they have to do the entire story in 40-45 minutes, I thought
it was very good. We had seen "The Lion King" just a week ago, and I
have to admit, for the money, I'd rather have seen "Aladdin."</LD>

<LD>In her "Single in the City" column, Maria Elena Fernandez expressed a
wonderful truth about love ("Recalling a bolt from the blue," Dec.
19). Love does not have to last a lifetime. Usually it does not.</LD>
<LD>   Readers and Fernandez should read Antoine de Saint-Exupery's
classic children's book titled "The Little Prince," one of my
favorites. It is fun and moving, perfect during this holiday season.
Its theme is that love is worthwhile because of the memories -- the
loved one becomes a source of meaning in your life. We all need a
precious rose to brighten our lives, in the now or through memories.</LD>

<LD>My name is Elijah Dittersdorf and you used me in a large color
picture for your article about Virgin Megastore and other music
stores in L.A. ("Where do you buy?" Dec. 19). The caption read:
"Elijah Dittersdorf, a Virgin employee who wears his love of music on
his arm, arranges stock at the store." You failed to mention that the
majority of employees at these stores are paid minimum wage, are
given no benefits and have one of the highest turnover rates in
retail. These "super-size" companies do not like to keep employees
very long, as the help then might want a slight wage increase and
maybe a shot at some health care. It's much more profitable to cycle
someone through than move somebody up. Most of the plastic CDs on the
shelf have been there longer then the human being helping you find
it, pay for it, put it in the bag, return it, dust it, stock it or
suggest it.</LD>

<TE>   Overall, I enjoyed Dean Kuipers' overview of the Big Three music
stores in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Deciding whether to go to Tower, Virgin or Amoeba is kind of like
deciding which girl you want to take to the prom: They'll all give
you what you want, but how they deliver it is very different.</TE>
<TE>   One negative: I would have appreciated a sidebar on trading in
CDs, as this is obviously how Amoeba replenishes its stock.</TE>

<LD>Enjoyed your article on Glendale and Christmas ("Sentimental
shopper," Dec.19). I'm much older, but have equally fond memories of
Glendale. My wonderful grandparents lived in Atwater Village just
past where Brand becomes Glendale Boulevard. I remember my "Nana"
taking me on the streetcar to go shopping.</LD>
<LD>   My fondest memories are of the electric trains at Sears Roebuck,
the creaky, wooden floors of Woolworth's "five and dime" and a hot
roast-beef sandwich lunch at the counter; Kress' to look for Cub
Scout stuff like a pocketknife or compass, and especially getting to
sit on Santa's lap. How times have changed.</LD>

raised in California. Accompaniments vary. The caviar might come with
a jalapeno potato latke, rosti potatoes or warm potato chips. The
rosti potatoes are flavored with onion, chives and dill before being
topped with creme fraiche, caviar and a squeeze of lemon. (Caviar,
$75 an ounce.)</LD>

fraiche and blini. (Caviar, 30 grams, $8 to $105; assiette royale,

<HD>Good for what ails you</HD>
<DH>Zach Braff and the cast of 'Scrubs' know where your funny
bone is and tickle it weekly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Frazier Moore</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are many ways that "Scrubs" mirrors the healing profession.</LD>
<LD>   This NBC medical comedy is fast paced, even crazed. It operates
with surgical precision. And like any hospital inpatient, you at home
may experience it lying down.</LD>
<LD>   Finally: "Scrubs," though very funny, has its dramatic, even
catastrophic moments.</LD>
<TE>   "One of every three patients who's admitted to this place will die
here," said John (J.D.) Dorian, a callow intern and the hero of
"Scrubs," addressing viewers in an early episode.</TE>
<TE>   Patients do die on "Scrubs." But more often, they survive a
comedic regimen that parallels modern medicine more than any viewer
would like to believe.</TE>
<TE>   The whole nutty enterprise is seen through the eyes of J.D., who,
played by Zach Braff, has a well-meaning but uncertain attitude he
exhibits in numerous ways -- by what he does, by his wry monologues
second-guessing it, and by fantasy sequences that dramatize his
interior conflict.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, his attempt to project confidence to the outside
world is seen contradicted by his own self-image as a deer in the
headlights.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter who you are," says Braff, "you can relate to how J.D.
wants to put out something that's different from the way he's
actually feeling. For most people, there's a constant battle between
who you want to be and who your insecurities are telling you you
really are.</TE>
<TE>   "I think, at its core, that's what the show is about."</TE>
<TE>   But its fans may find more. "Scrubs" (which, in its second season,
airs at 8:30 p.m. Thursdays) represents a social structure most
people initially encounter in about seventh grade, and never graduate
beyond. At Sacred Heart Hospital, there's even a "high school bully"
-- the janitor who, for unknown reasons, never misses a chance to
terrorize J.D.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, says Braff, life resembles high school no matter what your
age or occupation. And if you happen to be a doctor, he adds, "while
you're dealing with all those social dynamics, you're also trying to
save lives. That's what intensifies it."</TE>
<TE>   But "Scrubs" creator Bill Lawrence "is really good about
modulating things," Braff says. "It's most important to him that
viewers trust this world, that they believe it could be real. From
there, we can go really broad with the comedy, and at times really
dramatic. But at the center, it has to be a real place."</TE>
<TE>   Oddly enough, it is a real place or, at least, used to be:
"Scrubs" is filmed, and headquartered, in a former Los Angeles-area
hospital building.</TE>
<TE>   "The production offices and writers' offices are there," Braff
says. "Even the sets that aren't hospital locations, like the
apartment and the bar, are built there. And our dressing rooms are
converted hospital rooms.</TE>
<TE>   "How many people have died in my dressing room?" he muses. It's
the sort of tragicomic thought a show like "Scrubs" would inspire.</TE>
<TE>   Now 27, Braff has come a long way from the East Orange, N.J.,
community theater where his lawyer dad was a star and 9-year-old Zach
"was the mascot to the backstage crew. I thought I was the coolest
kid in the world."</TE>
<TE>   He's in a pretty cool spot now (especially slotted right after
"Friends"). But sipping a soda during an interview, he blends a
drowsy charm with high-rev talk of how success can vanish overnight.
Or even before it happens, as he found out a dozen years ago from his
first TV role. He was part of the ensemble for "High," the pilot for
a gritty high school drama created by Bruce Paltrow that also starred
daughter Gwyneth. ("She was a naive freshman," Braff says. "It was
her first gig too.")</TE>
<TE>   "High" seemed a cinch for the fall lineup. Then the network killed
it before it premiered.</TE>
<TE>   "I had even gotten a fruit basket welcoming me to the CBS family,"
Braff says. "That taught me a lot."</TE>
<TE>   So what has starring in "Scrubs," with its robust ratings and
critical acclaim, taught him these days? "It freaks me out to go to
hospitals now," he replies.</TE>
<TE>   "My brother and his wife had a baby recently and I went to visit
them at Cedars-Sinai. And walking down the halls, I'm like, 'This is
weird. I recognize all the characters we have on our show.'</TE>
<TE>   "Then a janitor came out of the elevator," adds Braff as he
performs a procedure called pulling your leg. "I ran away from him!"</TE>

<HD>She's spoken of quite fondly</HD>
<DH>After Leonardo and 'Catch Me,' Amy Adams weighs the offers
that roll in.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Olsen</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Actress Amy Adams was watching television recently with her mother
when a behind-the-scenes feature on her new movie "Catch Me if You
Can" came on.</LD>
<LD>   It was strange enough to see herself on the TV, but stranger still
was seeing both Leonardo DiCaprio and Steven Spielberg, her
respective co-star and director, talk about her.</LD>
<LD>   "They had spoken to me, of course, I knew they knew me," she says,
wide-eyed. "But I'd never heard them talk of me. At some point they
both sat down and said my name several times. And spoke fondly, no
less. It was pretty bizarre."</LD>
<TE>   The fourth of seven siblings (her younger brother Eddie had a
small role in the latest "Austin Powers" film), the pert Colorado
native skipped college in favor of the regional theater circuit.</TE>
<TE>   It was while in a musical production in Minnesota that she was
cast alongside rising starlets Kirsten Dunst, Denise Richards and
Brittany Murphy in the 1999 beauty pageant spoof "Drop Dead
Gorgeous."</TE>
<TE>   A few words of encouragement from co-star Kirstie Alley were all
Adams needed to pack her bags for Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Less than a month after arriving out West, Adams was cast in
"Manchester Prep," a television spinoff of the hit film "Cruel
Intentions."</TE>
<TE>   The show never aired (it is now available on video as "Cruel
Intentions 2"), but it provided a springboard to a handful of
television guest spots and roles in such films as "Pumpkin" and
"Serving Sara."</TE>
<TE>   When Adams was called in to audition for Spielberg for the role of
Brenda Strong in "Catch Me," she had already tried out for the same
role when a different director had been attached to the project.
"Once you've done an audition you always think, 'Gee, if I could only
do that again.' To get the chance to do it over was like a dream come
true."</TE>
<TE>   Though Brenda Strong is the name of one paramour in Frank Abagnale
Jr.'s memoir of life as a con man on which the film is based, Adams'
character in the script is a composite of women he was involved with.
Adams' first scene in the film, in which DiCaprio flatters and flirts
with her gawky hospital candy-striper, is aided in no small measure
by the prosthetic braces she wears on her teeth to great effect.</TE>
<TE>   Adams, perhaps due to simple press fatigue, is surprisingly blase
about the fact that a good portion of her screen time is spent
canoodling with DiCaprio, one of the world's leading heartthrobs.
"I'd had a huge talent crush on him," she says. "But I wasn't
counting script pages to see how many times I'd kiss him. I really
didn't think about it, since something like that has to come from a
genuine place for the character. I couldn't worry about Amy's selfish
ambition to be making out with Leo."</TE>
<TE>   She gets one of the biggest laughs in the film with her shocked
response to finding out her fiance is not what he seems. Adams
credits Spielberg with honing her timing in the scene and notes that
her character is not intended come across as the sharpest tool in the
shed.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be honest about who people are," she adds. "But you
never want to actually think of your character as dumb because dumb
people always think they're the smartest people ever. That's partly
why they are so dumb."</TE>
<TE>   Of her short stint working for the Hooters restaurant chain, she
says, "I just really needed to buy a car. I was so sick of taking the
bus. And I'm sure there are worse things for people to find out about
than working at Hooters."</TE>
<TE>   Since finishing work on "Catch Me," Adams filmed a guest spot on
"The West Wing" and is now mulling over a handful of offers.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to leave words like 'capitalize' and 'heat' to my business
people and I just try to consider the material on its own," she says.
"You have to be very clear about what road you want to go down or
someone else will decide for you. That can be hard when you're a
young woman in Hollywood. There's so much going on around you that
it's hard to stay focused on what's actually important to you."</TE>

<HD>One night a year, they do it his way</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jessica Hundley</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nobody does it (or rather, did it) like Frank. There was just
something in the way he wore his hat, in the way he wooed the ladies,
and of course, in the way he carried a tune, that was quite simply
like nobody else. "He was a gentleman," says Ashley Joyce, co-owner
of the Hollywood bar the Room, "he was loyal and hard-working, and he
had true class."</LD>
<LD>   Joyce and his partner Jeremy Thomas are Sinatra aficionados. Their
club was one of the pioneers of a once-desolate strip of Cahuenga now
brimming with nightlife, and it is just the sort of place Frank would
have enjoyed: dark and plush and private, the perfect spot to sit
quietly and drink a whiskey in peace. Above the Room's bar hangs an
autographed photo of The Man himself, in trademark suit and tie, his
arms crossed and his look sly.</LD>
<LD>   "I like to think he's watching over the place," Joyce says, "and
nodding his head in approval." Since 1990, as a show of respect to
Frank, who died in 1998, Joyce and Thomas have been throwing a
birthday bash in his honor. Each Dec. 12, the Room goes high Rat Pack
style for dancing, reminiscing, paying tribute and guzzling top-shelf
alcohol.</LD>
<TE>   This year, on the special day, women in black cocktail dresses and
pearl earrings sipped martinis and batted eyelashes at the bar. The
men wore hats, pulled low over one eye, with jackets slung casually
over one shoulder. Joyce spun Sinatra and lots of it.</TE>
<TE>   In the small, close club, Frank's one-of-a-kind voice seeped out
of the speakers and into the air and somehow made everything richer.
Men stood a little taller; women fixed their lipstick and smoothed
their hair.</TE>
<TE>   At midnight, Joyce dropped the needle on "New York, New York" and
signaled for the bar to be set on fire. Everyone hoisted glasses,
toasted noisily and sang in unison. The higher the harmless blue
flames reached, the louder they sang. Then it was "My Way," more
lighter fluid and more cheerful chaos.</TE>
<TE>   "He's up there right now, " says Joyce, pointing toward the
heavens, "sipping a Jack Daniel's and having a damn good time."</TE>

<HD>This year, New Year's partyers have a choice</HD>
<DH>Two parties hope to draw revelers to downtown L.A., while
the more traditional Hollywood event moves indoors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dennis Romero</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>DAVE DEAN stands in the center lane of Flower Street, hands held
wide. At 6-foot-2, he casts a wide shadow that surely spooks a
cavalcade of oncoming traffic. "We'll use all this area across
Flower," he says, describing the main stage of his third annual
outdoor New Year's Eve party in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   This year Dean's "Giant Village" moves downtown in what he and
other boosters describe as a coming out for the long-promised
nightlife revitalization of the city's core in a time of uncertainty
for Southern California dance culture.</LD>
<LD>   In grandiose Dean fashion (he brought the mega-club concept to Los
Angeles in 2000 with his Giant weekly), the 7,500- capacity event
will occupy Flower between 5th and 6th streets, with the Bonaventure
and Standard hotels serving as official bookends where revelers are
encouraged to spend the night.</LD>
<TE>   "We want this to be the annual signature event for downtown," Dean
says. "This is big." That's assuming, of course, that the crowds
decide to come.</TE>
<TE>   The central city scene will be bolstered by a New Year's bash at
the Grand Avenue Club, where the bimonthly club Naked is ready for as
many as 4,500 partygoers. The almost 2-year-old Naked is part of a
new wave of sex-obsessed club nights nationwide that depend more on a
body-conscious clientele than big-name DJs.</TE>
<TE>   Naked co-promoter Danny "B." Bitar gives away part of the secret
of his sexess: "We target about 50 strip joints in the area and give
the girls free passes."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood will not be without its contenders, however, including a
big-room event at the Palace featuring "progressive house" heroes
John Digweed and John Debo behind the turntables.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, trance DJ Steve Castro will spin at Afterhour Power's
"Mansion Power" party in Bel-Air, with tickets starting at $100 for
an all-you-can-drink affair. And New Year's Day, Spundae will hold a
"sunset"-to-2 a.m. event at Circus with trance kings Ferry Corsten
and Armin Van Buuren as well as Chicago house freak Derrick Carter
playing records.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, with room for 12,000, the downtown bashes may well
become the focus of L.A.'s New Year's celebrations. At a minimum, it
will test the long-anticipated but yet-to-be-realized notion that the
city's center can happen after sundown.</TE>
<TE>   "I am excited that downtown will be a major venue for New Year's
Eve parties this year," says City Councilwoman Jan Perry, who
represents the area. "This is just another example of how downtown
has become the ultimate destination for fine dining, hotels and
entertainment."</TE>
<TE>   Superstar trance DJ Paul van Dyk of Germany will spend his second
New Year's Eve in a row headlining in downtown and his third in a row
in Los Angeles. "We had in previous years great shows in L.A., so we
decided to come back," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Partygoer John Figi, 28, a consultant at a Bunker Hill accounting
firm, plans to stay at the Standard and party at Giant Village after
work on Dec. 31. "I'm parking the car and I'm not picking it up until
Jan. 2," he says.</TE>
<TE>   For Dean and the rest of the club scene, the ride to 2003 has been
filled with drama and strange days. Gene La Pietra's third-annual New
Year's Eve block party on Hollywood Boulevard was foiled by area
business owners. Some were bitter about last year's traffic-clogging
event, and others were mad about La Pietra's failed push for
Hollywood secession.</TE>
<TE>   Area merchants, led by Joel Fisher of the rival Palace nightclub,
applied for a midnight parade permit before La Pietra entered his
bid. The Police Commission approved the business owners' event
("Coalition for Hollywood Rally") because they applied first. Dean
said he served as an advisor to the merchants during the permit
process.</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra, meanwhile, has been hit with more bad news. A Dec. 7
raid by U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and state Alcohol
Beverage Control agents at Circus has thrown the future of Los
Angeles club culture into question (Spundae on Saturdays there is
L.A.'s only true weekly mega-club).</TE>
<TE>   For both downtown L.A. and Hollywood events, this will be a
critical New Year's Eve, with Dean claiming that his downtown party
will restore luster to the city's center and to the scene. Spundae
promoter Neil Thomas, meanwhile, says the return of Hollywood
nightlife (Spundae, Red, Star Shoes, Nacional, Las Palmas, Ivar,
Deep, etc.) will always make the area Southern California's nightlife
core, even this New Year's Eve. Says Thomas: "Hollywood is where it's
at."</TE>

<HD>Punk rock and family values</HD>
<DH>Fatherhood has mellowed Mike Ness but hasn't put out his
fire.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Appleford</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mike Ness is just a little uneasy, slouching at the microphone with a
guitar and looking like a working-class tough, his hair short and
slicked back against the scalp, both arms a tattooed macrame of
girls, flames, cars and rock 'n' roll symbols. He is rehearsing
Social Distortion through "Ball and Chain," another hard-luck anthem.
The sound is loud and twangy, an edgy blend of punk guitars and
American roots. Then Ness stops the band.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not going country, is it?" asks Ness, turning to the others
crowded behind him in this small Fullerton recording studio. "It's so
easy to do that."</LD>
<LD>   The band is rehearsing for a slew of mostly sold-out shows at the
House of Blues clubs in West Hollywood and Anaheim, a tribute to the
band's energy and staying power. And despite's Ness' momentary
concerns, Social Distortion still sounds like a punk rock Crazy Horse
here at Casbah Studios, where the band's first two albums were
recorded back in the '80s, doing much to help establish the SoCal
punk sound.</LD>
<TE>   A trio of photographs of Hank Williams stands at the microphone.
As the band roars through "Wasn't It a Pretty Picture?" there are
starts and stops until Ness finally turns to longtime bassist John
Maurer. "How did we used to do it?"</TE>
<TE>   "Probably different every time," says Maurer, with a shrug and
knowing grin.</TE>
<TE>   Ness laughs. This wouldn't have bothered Ness a decade ago, when
he was a sometimes-reckless punk rock frontman, distracted by
addictions and bad attitude. But at 40, Ness is no longer content
simply to bash out his songs. He's a professional now, a family man
who has put bad habits and dangerous behavior behind him, and a
positive outlook that has done little to diminish the fire in his
music.</TE>
<TE>   Social D was practically there at the birth of West Coast punk, as
a band of high school malcontents led by Ness and guitarist Dennis
Danell, both obsessed with the music of the Clash and the Ramones. In
the decades since, Ness watched as punk evolved from a revolutionary
movement into an acceptable pop culture commodity. His own music
retains its edge, but when Danell died suddenly in 2000 from a brain
aneurysm, there was a moment when Ness thought of disbanding Social
D.</TE>
<TE>   The bandleader recalls his and Danell's early years together in a
new song, "Don't Take Me for Granted," a tribute to Danell and a
signal of the band's continued life. "I'm your worn-in leather
jacket," Ness sings. "I'm the volume in your ... teenage band!"</TE>
<TE>   The reconstituted band, featuring guitarist Johnny Wickersham,
formerly of the Cadillac Tramps, has recently been at work on a
planned new studio album, Social D's first since 1996's "White Light
White Heat White Trash."</TE>
<TE>   Social D voluntarily left Epic Records after that album, followed
by a 1998 live release for Time Bomb Records. And lately Ness has
been looking to the hip-hop community to see the old punk
do-it-yourself ethos at work. "I have so much more respect for a band
like NWA, who sold 1 million records without one bit of radio airplay
or MTV, than I do for one of these boy-band punk bands who have major
labels pushing them now because punk is cute," he says.</TE>
<TE>   To be a punk in the late '70s sometimes meant battling with locals
moved to violence by the mere presence of spiky hair, leather jackets
and smeared eyeliner.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an everyday occurrence," remembers Maurer. "We couldn't go
into a store without some grown man looking at us and calling us
homosexuals and everything else. We were kids."</TE>
<TE>   Ness says local jocks decided to leave him alone when he came to
school one day in 1979 still scarred up from self-inflicted knife
wounds. He had just returned from his first and only stay in a
psychiatric ward, following a night of drinking and sloppy knife
play. "I didn't want to die," says Ness now. "I was just acting out."</TE>
<TE>   The punk scene began to change by the mid-'80s, as the definition
of punk became narrower, hewing mainly to a hard-core formula. "By
1985, punk had really stereotyped itself," says Ness. "Now the jock
quarterback of the football team could be the lead singer of a band
because all he had to do was scream and act angry.</TE>
<TE>   "Devo got beer bottles thrown at them. They took such a risk.
Jane's Addiction found their own niche. Social Distortion found their
own niche. The whole punk thing was about individualism."</TE>
<TE>   In the music of L.A. punk band X, he first recognized the
connection between punk and American roots music, where the likes of
Hank Williams and Robert Johnson seemed to have more to offer him. It
was a sound he explored most directly with two solo albums in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The next Social D album will draw from dozens of new songs Ness
has had in the works for three years. And if "White Light" explored
typically dark themes for the band, Ness says he expects the next
album to reflect a more positive state of mind, inspired by his
recent years of family life raising two young sons. One of the new
album's working joke titles is "Who's Your Daddy?"</TE>
<TE>   "I express myself with music now," Ness says. "The chances of me
getting in a fistfight are not near as big as they would have been."</TE>

<HD>When Rodeo gets (almost) real</HD>
<DH>Exclusive shops knock prices down a few notches for their
end-of-season sales.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Carpenter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Falling markets and wartime jitters may have reduced the ranks of
elite shoppers eager to empty their wallets on Rodeo Drive these
days, but for the next two weeks, an annual ritual makes this ritzy
strip a must-shop destination no matter what the budget. From Fendi
to Bulgari, most of the stores on this couture court are currently
engaged in end-of-season sales, slashing their prices by as much as
50%. Yes, stores everywhere do this, but on Rodeo Drive, "half-off"
can equal a regular monthly paycheck for most folk. Cutting the price
of a fur coat (even a fake one) by $5000 can be pretty breathtaking
to see, and maybe puts it within reach. You may still miss rent or a
car payment, but if you've been eyeing that dress from Gucci or a
handbag by Dior, you may as well check it out. Just don't expect any
deals on a pink diamond from Tiffany. The jeweler never has sales --
ever.</LD>
<LD>   Nestled between Wilshire and Santa Monica Boulevards in the heart
of Beverly Hills, the three-block strip that is North Rodeo Drive is
a veritable who's who of high-fashion boutiques, beginning with
Tiffany on its south end and continuing on through Valentino and
Armani to Prada three blocks up.</LD>
<TE>   Ordinarily, stores fall into three categories: expensive handbags,
even more expensive clothing and outrageously priced jewelry. But
from now through mid-January, you can get a Prada mink coat for 30%
to 50% off, or save 40% on a Fendi bag.</TE>
<TE>   In a year when everyone's pocketbooks have been a little lighter,
these kinds of savings are better than ever. And who knows? The
budget shopper may bring a dose of reality to the hoity-toity
district, just like the good old days.</TE>
<TE>   Rodeo Drive hasn't always been so glamorous. In 1907, when Rodeo
de las Aguas was first built across the lima bean fields, the street
was for locals to do their everyday shopping. There was even public
transportation; a trolley ran down its center until the tracks were
ripped up to accommodate cars.</TE>
<TE>   According to the book, "Inside Rodeo Drive: The Stores, the Stars,
the Story," the street's associations with wealth and status only
started to shift in 1919. That's when Douglas Fairbanks and Mary
Pickford moved to Beverly Hills, triggering an influx of celebrities.
By the '30s and '40s, Rodeo Drive had filled with nightclubs and
restaurants so celebs of the day could shine their collective star
power in public.</TE>
<TE>   By the '60s, it had transformed yet again into a hub for
hairdressers and salons. But it wasn't until 1961, when Fred Hayman
set up Giorgio Beverly Hills -- a high-end boutique with elaborate
dressing rooms and a Rolls Royce delivery service -- that the street
started attracting marquee shops.</TE>
<TE>   It's nice to know that these same marquee shops that seem to gleam
at us from another world -- tantalizing us from the pages of various
fashion magazines only to shock us with their price tags -- are
sometimes part of the real Los Angeles. Even if only for two weeks.</TE>

<HD>When Swanson made big changes</HD>
<DH>In 1924, she switched her wardrobe and her director
(DeMille to Dwan) in 'Manhandled.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gloria Swanson made six sophisticated romantic dramas with Cecil B.
DeMille that made her the most glamorous movie star of the silent
era, but by 1924 she also had become a legendary clotheshorse about
to be done in by all those elaborate costumes.</LD>
<LD>   Shrewdly she chucked this image for "Manhandled," the first of the
six pictures she would make with Allan Dwan, to play a gum-chewing,
subway-riding salesgirl in Macy's basement -- even though the plot
allowed Paramount to promise Swanson would be wearing "more gorgeous
gowns than ever!"</LD>
<LD>   This timelessly beguiling film, which opens the Silent Movie's New
Year's Eve Double Feature at 8:30 p.m., is a typical tale of a
youthful, innocent urban dreamer, but Dwan makes it a showcase for
the diminutive Swanson's extraordinary beauty and brilliance as a
comedian.</LD>
<TE>   Swanson is teamed perfectly with Owen Moore (Mary Pickford's first
husband) as her Irish-handsome, hard-working boyfriend whose
time-consuming ambition makes her vulnerable to a series of cynical
men about town.</TE>
<TE>   Swanson and Dwan survived the transition to talkies, their
partnership and her romance with Joseph Kennedy to remain staunch
lifelong friends.</TE>
<TE>   "Manhandled" will be followed by a dessert buffet reception.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Buster Keaton's "Sherlock Jr." (1924) will screen at 10:30 p.m.,
concluding in time for a champagne toast to the New Year.</TE>
<TE>   Without a doubt "Sherlock Jr." is one of Keaton's most inspired
efforts, a visual tour de force that reveals his tremendous awareness
of the resources of the camera.</TE>
<TE>   Keaton is a small-town movie-theater projectionist who's studying
to be a private eye via a correspondence course and whose pursuit of
a pretty girl (Kathryn McGuire) is sabotaged viciously by a rugged
guy identified as the Sheik (Ward Crane).</TE>
<TE>   Falling asleep on the job, Keaton dreams that he is entering the
mystery melodrama on the screen, reveling in his brilliance as a
detective. (Shades of Woody Allen's decades-later but less complex
"Purple Rose of Cairo.")</TE>
<TE>   "Sherlock Jr." is an unpretentious comedy with beguiling charm and
throwaway humor that asks no more than to entertain but nevertheless
is open to considerable psychological and symbolic interpretation;
such is Keaton's sophisticated mastery of the visual that "Sherlock
Jr." becomes a playful consideration of the levels of reality and of
fantasy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Screenings</TE>
<TE>   What: "Manhandled" and "Sherlock Jr."</TE>

<HD>Dating tip from P.G. Wodehouse</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Samantha Bonar</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SOME men fail to understand the importance of not being too earnest.</LD>
<LD>   "Are you going to go out with him again?" my ex-boyfriend asked me
about my latest date. We have a Jerry and Elaine kind of
relationship.</LD>
<LD>   "Gawd, no. He was too sincere," I said.</LD>
<TE>   "What do you mean?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   "He was talking about the miracle of new babies," I said.</TE>
<TE>   "Ah," he said. "Too 'God's daisy chains.' "</TE>
<TE>   "Exactly," I said.</TE>
<TE>   "God's daisy chains" is a phrase used in a P.G. Wodehouse novel to
describe the type of women that protagonist Bertie Wooster and his
chums try to avoid at all costs. One character dated a woman who
asked him, "Aren't the stars like God's daisy chains?" He was
sickened. From then on, "God's daisy chains" became shorthand for
women one should ditch immediately.</TE>
<TE>   I didn't expect that there were "God's daisy chains" kind of men,
but I was proved wrong. From the beginning of my lunch date with
"Earnest," he spouted one G.D.C. comment after another. To a
sarcastic girl like myself, this was pure torture.</TE>
<TE>   When I saw how the land lay, and that I was in for a good hour
free of irony, my first impulse was to order a drink. I did not care
what impression my imbibing at noon would have. I ordered a
Chardonnay with my Cobb salad.</TE>
<TE>   The wine loosened my inhibitions a bit, and as Tom droned on about
the miracle of creation and his neighbor's precious newborn baby
(newborns have always reminded me of naked mole rats), I decided to
kill two pretty little songbirds with one stone by purposely
sabotaging my date. One, I would entertain myself. Two, I would not
have to worry about turning him down for another outing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just beautiful to see my students open up and become
emotionally vulnerable as they connect with a character. To see that
transformation touches me deeply," he was saying earnestly. He is an
opera singer and teacher. I gave him the stink eye, but he didn't
notice. Still, he woke from his reverie of young souls expanding and
changed the subject.</TE>
<TE>   "Laura said you are just the sweetest woman," he said, beaming.</TE>
<TE>   I dropped my fork dramatically.</TE>
<TE>   "Sweet? That's not a word that's often applied to me," I replied.</TE>
<TE>   He blanched.</TE>
<TE>   "Uh, what do you mean?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Ah, well, I say never trust a sweet woman or a nice guy," I said.</TE>
<TE>   "Why not?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not what they appear," I said.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh," he said. "Well, if you're not sweet, what are you?" he asked
politely.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a jaded journalist," I said. "Jaded. I've seen it all."</TE>
<TE>   "You seem sweet," he said, tentative now.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not. Ha. Believe me. Ask any of my friends," I said.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The conversation stalled. He looked uneasy.</TE>
<TE>   I finished my drink, looked around the restaurant, hummed a
little.</TE>
<TE>   The check came. Earnest paid. He mumbled something about talking
to me soon. I shook his hand quickly and bolted like a fluffy little
kitten after a fuzzy ball of yarn.</TE>
<TE>   It was cruel. But God's daisy chains must be hacked down
ruthlessly. No mercy must be shown the precious little blossoms.</TE>
<TE>   Diabetes runs in my family. I can't risk being around all that
sugar.</TE>

<HD>In sequel, he's 'Kombat' ready</HD>
<DH>Ed Boon and his team return to follow up a bestseller that
once set the standard.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Appleford</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ED Boon is no softy. He may be a man in a polo shirt and comfortable
shoes, clean-cut and pleasant. But he is also a fighter, a warrior, a
brutal master of martial arts and something else he calls "drunken
fighting," a woozy technique that includes the occasional eruption of
vomit to knock opponents off-balance.</LD>
<LD>   That's not all. He finishes off his enemies by ripping out their
spinal cords or even their intact skeletons.</LD>
<LD>   These are the powers in Boon's hands right now, as he calmly
demonstrates the newest version of "Mortal Kombat," the notorious
martial arts video fighting game with a mystical edge that he helped
create at Midway Games 10 years ago. It's set in a Darwinian world of
ninjas and half-human beasts and the bronzed Johnny Cage, a
Jean-Claude Van Damme type in shades and impeccable blond hair.</LD>
<TE>   "Mortal Kombat" has endured for a decade in arcades and on home
consoles, making it one of the best-selling franchises in video game
history with more than 19 million home games sold. The just-released
"Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance" is the first designed specifically
for the new generation of consoles (PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube).</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that there's so much interest in this many years later,
we're as amazed as anyone else is," says Boon, in Beverly Hills to
unveil the new game. The game's success has moved beyond the video
screen to inspire two movies, a Saturday-morning cartoon show, action
figures, trading cards and comic books.</TE>
<TE>   The latest game even has a new theme song, "Immortal," written and
recorded by metal act Adema, that is enjoying regular rotation on
MTV2. Adema singer Mark Chavez was once one of those kids skipping
junior high school classes for a few obsessive hours of "Mortal
Kombat."</TE>
<TE>   "When it gets into that area, I don't consider it mine by any
means anymore," says Boon, who as a programmer led a team of four a
decade ago to create what was expected to be a "quickie" eight-month
project. All of them were fans of Bruce Lee and "Star Wars." None had
studied martial arts.</TE>
<TE>   "Mortal Kombat" was an immediate hit in 1992, combining violence
and gore with a taste of sci-fi doom and Asian mythology that had
opponents battling for the fate of the world.</TE>
<TE>   It was also controversial enough to lead directly to hearings on
violence in video games by a U.S. Senate subcommittee in 1993 and a
rating system that is now the industry standard.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.), who was chairman of that
subcommittee, declared then that "instead of enriching a child's
mind, these games teach a child to enjoy inflicting torture." In
1999, then-President Clinton mentioned "Mortal Kombat" when he
lambasted violent video games and their presumed impact on young
players following the massacre at Columbine High School in Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   "We always thought there should be a rating system," Boon says
now. "Kids that are playing 'Mario' should not be playing adult
teen-rated or mature-rated games."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly a decade after those hearings, "Mortal Kombat" is back with
increasingly sophisticated graphics and intense battles involving
nunchucks, whips, swords, battle-axes and other weapons. Even the
U.S. Army is now using video games as a recruitment tool.</TE>
<TE>   Decapitations and impalings are old news, tame even. "People are
just used to it," says Dan "Shoe" Hsu, editor in chief of Electronic
Gaming Monthly. "So many mature-rated games have raised the bar for
what we expect in terms of adult content in video games."</TE>
<TE>   "Deadly Alliance" is the first true sequel to the game since 1997
and the first not released in an arcade model, as Boon's team of 50
programmers, designers, artists and others re-created "Mortal Kombat"
for a new generation of gamers.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything, no matter how successful, becomes stale if repeated a
certain amount of times," Boon says. Now there are new characters and
settings, and Midway's entire staff contributed to even more of the
exaggerated fight-ending "fatalities."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a production now," he says. "It's literally approahing the
point of making little movies."</TE>

<LD>If a picture is worth a thousand words, what's the sound of a steam
locomotive worth? Or an audiotape of Martin Luther King's "I Have a
Dream" speech? Or Woody Guthrie's original acetate of "This Land Is
Your Land"?</LD>
<LD>   For years the answer was apparently "Not much." The preservation
and archiving of increasingly rare sounds and vintage recordings have
been shockingly inadequate, threatening to leave a gaping historical
void for future generations.</LD>
<LD>   But recently the Smithsonian Institution and the Library of
Congress joined forces to address the oversight with an effort called
"Save Our Sounds," the subject of a fine one-hour documentary at 8
tonight on the History Channel.</LD>
<TE>   The program, part of the cable outfit's Emmy-winning "Save Our
History" series, looks at the onerous task of salvaging thousands of
fragile wax cylinders, splintered acetate discs and crinkled and
crumbling tapes so they can be migrated into digital media and
accessed by all on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   There are interviews with technical and historical experts as well
as musicians B.B. King, Pete Seeger and David Crosby. Crosby recalls
once being in a clanking old elevator with a pal who insisted on
turning out the lights so they could focus on all the classic creaks.</TE>
<TE>   Crosby admits he's listened to the world a little differently ever
since, and you might too after tonight's program.</TE>

<LD>Trapped</LD>
<LD>   Charlize Theron, Kevin Bacon</LD>
<LD>   Columbia TriStar, $28</LD>
<TE>   Watching this smarmy kidnapping thriller is akin to receiving a
lump of coal in your Christmas stocking. The film opened late last
summer with little fanfare during a seemingly endless spate of
real-life child kidnappings around the country. It also was quietly
released because it is just a nasty bit of business, despite the
stellar cast. Child kidnappers Bacon, Courtney Love and Pruitt Taylor
Vince meet their match when they kidnap the asthmatic daughter
(Dakota Fanning) of Theron and Stuart Townsend.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD has way too many extras for a film of this quality,
including a "making of" featurette, several deleted scenes, an
alternate ending, decent commentary from director Luis Mandoki and
another commentary track from Greg Iles, who wrote the screenplay.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Blood Work</TE>
<TE>   Clint Eastwood, Jeff Daniels</TE>
<TE>   Warner Home Video, $27</TE>
<TE>   Eastwood, now 72, stars in and directed this rather anemic,
old-fashioned thriller about a retired FBI profiler and recent
heart-transplant recipient who tracks down the killer of his heart
donor. It's better than some of Eastwood's most recent films but
nowhere near the quality of "Unforgiven." Wanda De Jesus plays the
sister of the heart donor and Daniels is Eastwood's hippie neighbor.
The digital edition is pretty skimpy, with a "making of" documentary
and a conversation in Spanish with De Jesus and co-star Paul
Rodriguez (subtitled in English) about the rise in popularity of
Latino actors. Eastwood also pops up in this conversation but speaks
in English.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Judy Garland Collection</TE>
<TE>   Judy Garland</TE>
<TE>   Kultur, $40</TE>
<TE>   This four-disc DVD set features the terrific 1962 TV concert
"Judy, Frank &amp; Dean: Once in a Lifetime" that was produced and
directed by Norman Jewison of "In the Heat of the Night" fame, the
tuneful 1963 "The Judy Garland, Robert Goulet &amp; Phil Silvers
Special," the legendary 1964 concert "Live at the London Palladium
With Liza Minnelli" and the 1985 PBS special "The Concert Years,"
hosted by Garland's daughter Lorna Luft.</TE>
<TE>   Garland is at the peak of her vocal and emotional powers in the
three concerts from the '60s, but Kultur doesn't seem to have done
any restoration work on these titles. The "Once in a Lifetime"
concert, which was colorized when it was reprised on the small screen
in the 1980s, is in decent shape, but the Goulet and Silvers special
and the Palladium concert are not. In this age of digital
restoration, there is no excuse for releasing anything this shabby.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever</TE>
<TE>   Antonio Banderas, Lucy Liu</TE>
<TE>   Warner Home Video, $27</TE>
<TE>   There are spectacular stunts, tons of gunfire and car chases
galore in this mindless but watchable action thriller. FBI agent Ecks
(Banderas) discovers that his late wife (Talisa Soto) is alive and
married to an evil CIA agent (Gregg Henry). Liu is a defense
intelligence agent pursuing the Henry character because he's stolen
some micro-technology and was involved in the killing of her infant.</TE>
<TE>   The ho-hum DVD includes an HBO "First Look" documentary and an
interactive challenge game.</TE>

<HD>How dogs 'talk': Barks, growls, body language</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Dogs don't speak the way people do, but they do communicate with one
another. Dogs and their wild relatives, wolves, use facial
expressions, body language, barks and growls to let each other know
what they are feeling.</LD>
<LD>   Next time you are at a park or somewhere else where dogs are
playing, watch them closely. What do you see?</LD>
<LD>   A dog that is rolling on its back or showing its belly is saying
it's submissive or shy.</LD>
<TE>   A dog standing tall and acting in charge is saying, "I'm the
boss."</TE>
<TE>   And if you see a dog lowering its front legs and raising its
behind, it is saying, "It's time to play!"</TE>
<TE>   What body language would you use if you wanted to play with
someone? Would you fold your arms across your chest and turn your
back? Or would you wave and walk toward the person? Next time you are
playing with friends, pay attention to the ways you communicate
without using words.</TE>
<TE>   You can learn more about dogs and how humans have lived with them
over time at the Natural History Museum's exhibit "Dogs: Wolf, Myth,
Hero &amp; Friend," on display until Jan. 5. For more information, call
(213) 763-DINO or visit www.nhm.org.</TE>

<LD>Maria and Alfonso were visiting Uncle Ruben in the San Bernardino
Mountains, where he worked as a nature guide and caretaker
year-round. Maria and Alfonso were excited to be in the snow and to
learn new things from their fascinating uncle.</LD>
<LD>   In the afternoon, Uncle Ruben led them on a trail that goes into
the hills north of the lodge. There was a foot of snow on the ground,
and it was sunny.</LD>
<LD>   After they'd walked for a little over half an hour, Uncle Ruben
stopped and asked them if they had brought their sunglasses along.</LD>
<TE>   "Sunglasses? What do we need sunglasses here for?" Maria asked.</TE>
<TE>   "A long time ago, when I was a little older than you," Uncle Ruben
explained, "I was following an animal's tracks through the snow. It
was a sunny day, like today, and I didn't understand the importance
of eye protection. My eyes got very irritated. I nearly got snow
blindness."</TE>
<TE>   "What's snow blindness?" Alfonso asked.</TE>
<TE>   "It's where the bright, reflected light actually blinds you. You
get a headache and can lose much of your vision for up to 24 hours,"
Uncle Ruben explained.</TE>
<TE>   "Wow, what should we do?" the children asked together.</TE>
<TE>   "First, you should always remember to go into the forest
prepared," Uncle Ruben said. "But hunters in the past would make eye
protectors from a piece of bark."</TE>
<TE>   "Bark?" Maria asked. "What do you mean?"</TE>
<TE>   "Let me show you," Uncle Ruben said, as he picked up a large,
flexible piece of bark from the forest floor. Using the scissors on
his utility knife, Uncle Ruben cut the bark so it was about three
inches wide by about 12 inches long. He held it up to his face to see
how it fit. Maria and Alfonso giggled.</TE>
<TE>   He first cut a little slit into the bark for each eye, then cut a
piece from the bottom so the bark would nestle over his nose. He
attached a little string onto each end and tied the bark protector
around his head.</TE>
<TE>   Uncle Ruben helped each make a bark eye protector, which they wore
all the way back to the lodge.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I can see why I should always carry my sunglasses out here,"
Maria laughed. "Get it, Uncle Ruben?"</TE>
<TE>   "I can see why too," Alfonso said, giggling.</TE>

<HD>Step Up to the Plate and Fight Prostate Cancer</HD>
<DH>Early detection may help knock this disease out of the
park.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dusty Baker</AU>
<BD>Dusty Baker, manager of the Chicago Cubs, was diagnosed
with prostate cancer in November 2001. He is a former Los Angeles
Dodgers outfielder.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This last year has been an exciting and challenging one for me, both
professionally and personally. But, as challenges go, I faced a
different sort of curve ball almost exactly a year ago: My doctor
told me I had prostate cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Fortunately, we caught it early, and so far I am doing well.</LD>
<LD>   Recently, I read that a government panel, the U.S. Preventive
Services Task Force, dropped its objection to routine prostate cancer
screening, saying it is possible the tests save lives.</LD>
<TE>   While this is certainly a positive step, this advisory panel
stopped short of actually recommending routine prostate cancer
screenings. I don't understand why.</TE>
<TE>   Since early detection is key, and men need to be more proactive in
this regard, I am disappointed by the panel's failure to recommend
this life-saving step. Prostate cancer screenings can not only create
awareness but also save lives.</TE>
<TE>   We need to promote awareness and screenings. The American Cancer
Society recommends that men age 50 and older should have a prostate
screening each year, and that those at high risk should begin at 45.</TE>
<TE>   Because of my risk profile, my doctor first measured my baseline
PSA, or prostate specific antigen, at the age of 40, and we have been
tracking it ever since.</TE>
<TE>   Doing so undoubtedly saved my life.</TE>
<TE>   Many men, however, don't get tested because the guidelines on
testing are simply not clear; others simply would rather not know.</TE>
<TE>   Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed solid tumor in men
in the U.S., and yet we do not take this condition seriously.</TE>
<TE>   More than 30,000 men will die from prostate cancer this year alone
-- that's one every 17 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   This is especially important for those known to be at high risk,
such as African American men and men with a history of the disease in
close family members. I fall into both of these high-risk groups.</TE>
<TE>   African Americans have the highest rates of prostate cancer in the
world and are 50% more likely to develop it than men of other racial
and ethnic groups. In addition, I also have several family members
who have either been diagnosed with prostate cancer or have died from
it.</TE>
<TE>   October was National Breast Cancer Awareness Month and, with all
the pink ribbons, it was hard to miss.</TE>
<TE>   I applaud woman for being so active, vocal and visual in their
fight against breast cancer. They have taken control of this health
issue. The breast cancer mantra is "early detection, early detection,
mammograms, mammograms."</TE>
<TE>   Critics of prostate cancer screenings say they are often
unnecessary. I could not disagree more.</TE>
<TE>   We have to step up to the plate and fight prostate cancer with the
same enthusiasm as women approach breast cancer -- their campaign is
centered on screening and early detection.</TE>
<TE>   If you have recently been diagnosed with prostate cancer, or like
me have already been treated, know your options.</TE>
<TE>   Knowledge is power. I challenge men to gain a better understanding
of the treatment options available and to familiarize themselves with
the potential benefits and side effects of each treatment.</TE>
<TE>   This will encourage a much more effective partnership with their
physician.</TE>
<TE>   Although treatment strategies have evolved over the last decade,
men are still limited in their options, especially when it comes to
preventing the high probability of progression or recurrence of the
disease after initial treatment -- something I think about every day.</TE>
<TE>   Women are not ashamed to talk about breast cancer and its
treatment, and they have shown the tenacity to fight for necessary
resources to increase funding for screenings and research.</TE>
<TE>   We must have a greater choice of options to detect and to treat
prostate cancer at every stage, and I implore the government and the
pharmaceutical industry to focus on screenings, early detection and
on finding new treatments.</TE>
<TE>   As a prostate cancer survivor, I urge men to take action. Don't
take your health for granted. Take a more proactive role in our
health. If you don't do it for yourself, then do it for your family
and friends. It's time to knock this disease out of the park.</TE>
<TE>   If you have not thought about prostate cancer, find out about it.
Early detection saves lives. It saved mine.</TE>

<HD>A New Wrinkle on the American Scene</HD>
<DH>Really old folks are in charge and going strong.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James P. Pinkerton</AU>
<BD>James P. Pinkerton writes a column for Newsday in New
York.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whatever happened to the youth culture? Answer: It got old. And so
here we are, overrun by a bunch of seventysomethings who are making
the news.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, 70, caused more
than a ripple when he declared that the United States could fight
wars against Iraq and North Korea simultaneously.</LD>
<LD>   One might consider other headliners. William H. Donaldson, the new
pick to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, is 71.
Palestinian chief Yasser Arafat is 73; his great antagonist, Israeli
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, is 74. Another 74-year-old is United
Nations weapons inspector Hans Blix. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan is 76, and Jimmy Carter, who just won a Nobel
Peace Prize, is 78. Frank Lautenberg, the once and future Democratic
senator from New Jersey, is almost 80; both John Whitehead,
overseeing the rebuilding of ground zero in Manhattan, and Pope John
Paul II have reached octogenarian status. Sen. Strom Thurmond
(R-S.C.), still a center of attention, is 100.</LD>
<TE>   But wasn't it always like this? Old men running things? After all,
the word "senator" comes from the Latin word for "old." But back
then, "old" was relatively young -- 50 or 60. And so it was with
American politicians; one shouldn't be fooled by white hair and
beards. George Washington, for instance, was 56 when he was elected
to the presidency; Abraham Lincoln was 50. And the two Roosevelts,
Theodore and Franklin, served six terms in the White House between
them and yet both were dead of natural causes at ages 60 and 63,
respectively.</TE>
<TE>   But if the aging of America hasn't gathered much news, one reason
could be that the news gatherers don't think getting old is that big
a deal. After all, it's happening to them, big time. Dan Rather is
71. And his colleague at CBS, Mike Wallace, is 84. But of course,
they probably don't look so superannuated to their big boss, Viacom
chief Sumner Redstone, 79. Indeed, many of the brightest names in
broadcast news, such as Tom Brokaw and Peter Jennings, are well into
their 60s. And don't tell anyone, but Barbara Walters is 71.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, some stars in society seem to be getting younger;
figure skaters and tennis players blossom in their teens. But the
country as a whole is getting older and living longer. The median age
in America was 35.3 in 2000, up seven years just from 1970. And the
prospect of death continues slowly to recede, like an un-Rogained
hairline. Life expectancy is now nearly 77, and an American who has
already reached the age of 65 can expect to live 18 more years.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, being alive is not always the same as keeping up with
change. Ask Walter Mondale or William Webster or Henry Kissinger. In
the last few months, those three septuagenarians all tried to return
to public life -- as senator, regulator and Sept. 11 investigator --
and yet found themselves rejected.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of Kissinger, the accumulated negatives of his more
than three decades in the spotlight finally hit critical mass. Why?
One reason is that many of his fiercest critics from the Nixon days,
such as Daniel Schorr, once of CBS, now punditing for National Public
Radio at age 86, are still around.</TE>
<TE>   What's not to like about this creeping gerontocracy? With aging
comes a setting of ways, and so it follows that the older we get, the
deeper the ruts we get into. That's what's happened in Japan, a land
of healthy but stubborn old people and not enough young people. As
the demographics of the country have wizened, its capacity for
creative national problem-solving has shriveled.</TE>
<TE>   Such a fate could befall the United States, too, as the baby
boomers, the oldest of whom will turn 57 next year, keep on going and
going and going. And of course, it's possible that modern medicine
will enable someone alive today to live on indefinitely. Americans
might soon be confronted by a battery of boomer Methuselahs, still
going strong in their overbearing ways.</TE>
<TE>   Who would you rather listen to for the next hundred years, Bill
Clinton or Rush Limbaugh? So the question to aging -- although not
necessarily graying -- Americans could soon be posed: At what point
is growing older no longer worth it?</TE>

<HD>Housing Still Hasn't Hit the Ceiling</HD>
<DH>Unlike Wall Street, this market is not a bubble. Demand for
homes remains strong.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nicolas P. Retsinas</AU>
<BD>Nicolas P. Retsinas is the director of the Joint
Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In this world of corporate scandals, the term "good investment" seems
an oxymoron. The tumble of many "blue-chip, grade-A"
broker-recommended wonders has made investors anxious, fearful that
the last decade's prosperity was not built on actual productivity but
on a bubble inflated by accounting legerdemain and corporate greed.</LD>
<LD>   Is housing the next bubble to deflate?</LD>
<LD>   Certainly the last decade's housing statistics mirror those of the
Wall Street wonder stocks. The total of new and existing home sales
in 2002 will approach 6 million units. (As recently as 1996, home
sales had never topped 5 million units.)</LD>
<TE>   As for prices, in spite of the conventional logic that price
increases must correlate with income growth, home-price appreciation
outpaced income growth. For each of the last seven years, home-price
appreciation exceeded inflation.</TE>
<TE>   What investor or buyer would not wonder whether this sector too
will plunge?</TE>
<TE>   We only need look back to 17th century Holland when there was a
run on tulip bulbs, driving up the price to the point where people
sold their homes to afford a single tulip bulb -- operating on the
premise that there would be someone else who would buy it for even
more.</TE>
<TE>   Today's anxious owners, and would-be buyers, fear that housing
might become America's own "tulip mania," where the passionate
bidding up leaves some people wealthy but many more holding real
estate of minimal value.</TE>
<TE>   Pundits pull out the truisms: Escalation cannot continue, what
goes up must come down, housing cannot soar out of sync with incomes,
the frenzy for bigger, more luxurious McMansions has gotten
ludicrous.</TE>
<TE>   The concern is not new. In 1989, a front page article in Barron's
quoted a study that predicted housing prices could fall as much as 3%
a year over the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   After prices rose again in the latter half of the 1990s, last
summer Forbes asked, "What if Housing Crashed?" noting "ominous
signs."</TE>
<TE>   Experts predicted that after Sept. 11, the housing bubble would
surely burst; but people delayed, not aborted, their purchases, which
reached an all-time high in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Bubbles, of course, do burst; but housing is not a bubble akin to
tulips or to Enron or other corporate scandals. It is a concrete
product -- a place where people live.</TE>
<TE>   And as anybody who has sold or bought a house can attest, it is
not an easily fungible commodity. The transaction costs of selling
and buying are high, in terms of money, time and effort.</TE>
<TE>   Most critically, though, the demand for housing will remain strong
so long as the supply is insufficient to meet that demand.</TE>
<TE>   Today, immigration has made the demand-supply imbalance especially
acute as more newly formed households seek homes.</TE>
<TE>   But even if we curtailed immigration, household growth will
continue to be robust.</TE>
<TE>   In California in the 1990s, for instance, more than four jobs were
created for every new housing unit. In the Bay Area, the ratio was 16
to 1.</TE>
<TE>   Demand for home ownership remains high, thanks to a confluence of
economic factors:</TE>
<TE>   * Low interest rates make home ownership increasingly affordable,
as well as rational. Renters, seeing the advantage of owning,
struggle to sign on the dotted line of a mortgage as soon as they can
muster a down payment.</TE>
<TE>   * The amount of money needed for a down payment has plummeted
thanks to a plethora of mortgage products.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, 15% of all buyers put 5% or less down on their homes,
compared with only 4% of all buyers in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   * Government programs for first-time buyers have encouraged
low-income Americans to buy.</TE>
<TE>   * Finally, housing has emerged as an alternative to a volatile
stock market. People fear that if they invest in Wall Street, their
money may evaporate. But they know that they can live in, and enjoy,
their equity if they renovate their home or buy a vacation home.
Increasingly, as the stock market has wavered, homeowners have used
their homes as ATM machines, drawing out the accumulated equity via
home equity loans or refinancing.</TE>
<TE>   Yet not even the most upbeat housing analyst expects the current
price escalation to continue: Prices cannot remain wildly out of sync
with incomes.</TE>
<TE>   Price appreciation has flattened, with selected markets seeing
small decreases in value. Over time, home price appreciation cannot
outpace income growth.</TE>
<TE>   Recessionary trends, as well as rising unemployment, weakens the
demand for home ownership.</TE>
<TE>   The recent implosion of the manufactured housing industry, as well
as escalating vacancy rates in luxury rental apartments, point to
people's growing caution.</TE>
<TE>   And any seismic economic change (for example, interest rates
rising to 9% or soaring unemployment) reverberates in the housing
sector.</TE>
<TE>   But for the two-thirds of American families who own homes, it is
still a time of rational exuberance.</TE>

<HD>Affirmative Action's Negatives</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Norah Vincent</AU>
<BD>Norah Vincent is a columnist in Yardley, Pa.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The great tragedy of Trent Lott is not that one man managed to
tarnish the entire Republican Party's image on race; after all, only
9% of African Americans voters chose President Bush.</LD>
<LD>   The tragedy is that he managed to sabotage conservative ideas in
the process, making the right's principled opposition to affirmative
action seem like nothing more than a front for latent bigotry.</LD>
<LD>   This is a monstrous lie.</LD>
<TE>   Conservatives do not oppose affirmative action because they are
crypto-racists. They oppose it because they deem affirmative action
itself to have become racist and, what's more, unconstitutional in
its current form, an outright system of racial quotas that blatantly
discriminates not just against whites but also against nonblack,
Latino or Native American minorities, violating the equal protection
clause of the 14th Amendment.</TE>
<TE>   It was not always so, nor was it intended to be. President Johnson
said in 1965: "You do not take a man who for years has been hobbled
by chains, liberate him, bring him to the starting line of a race
saying, 'You are free to compete with all the others,' and still
justly believe you have been completely fair."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson was right. Blacks, who had only just won the battle for
their civil rights, needed and deserved special protection from
entrenched and institutionalized racism.</TE>
<TE>   But times have changed. Race is not the stumbling block to
progress it once was, in large part because the Civil Rights Act of
1964 made it illegal to discriminate on the basis of race.</TE>
<TE>   Attitudes have changed as well. As Lott's recent evisceration by
conservatives and liberals alike must surely prove, racist sympathies
are anathema in the public sphere, a cause for deep shame and
professional censure.</TE>
<TE>   Affirmative action, too, has changed from a necessary corrective
measure intended to ensure that blacks had equal opportunities to a
superficial, reverse-racist social engineering protocol designed to
guarantee minorities places in colleges and companies, often at the
expense of more qualified candidates.</TE>
<TE>   The pendulum has swung too far. One form of discrimination has
been substituted for another, deferring still further Martin Luther
King Jr.'s dream of a colorblind America. King's vision is the true
guiding force of the conservative agenda on race. Evidence of this
can be found in the writings of Ward Connerly, Shelby Steele, John
McWhorter and Stephan and Abigail Thernstrom, some of the clearest
thinkers behind the movement to end racial preferences.</TE>
<TE>   It is incumbent upon the new Republican leadership to repair the
damage done when self-preservationists betray their principles and
give their political opponents ammunition in the process. They must
stand up for the integrity of conservative ideals or else sink
deservedly in the ignominy that now surrounds them.</TE>

<HD>Coyote Tales Give Pause</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Southern California coyotes share a lot of qualities with Southern
California humans. That's why they keep getting into trouble. The
coyotes, that is.</LD>
<LD>   Like people, coyotes love suburban living. They enjoy the good
life among the tended houses that sprouted up in their territory.</LD>
<LD>   Coyotes, like most humans, prefer their rats dead. And though they
sometimes go to great trouble to find a good meal of lapin sans
moutarde (coyote for "rabbit, hold the mustard sauce"), they're
always up for fast food. Except the coyote version of a Happy Meal is
human garbage -- or maybe your cat.</LD>
<TE>   Complaints about coyotes shot up markedly in the last year. The
Los Angeles Animal Regulation Commission agreed in June to trap
aggressive animals after complaints surged around the city. Human
residents of Silver Lake complained anew in September after a coyote
snatched a pet Chihuahua from a yard.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, a group of Leisure World residents in south Orange
County is demanding that wildlife officials excise the coyotes, which
pay no attention to the gated community's borders. Leisure World is
their neighbor, edged by two wilderness parks. A creek, a favorite
coyote entertainment center, runs right through it. The retirement
community's lush landscaping is great for hiding and attracts lots of
rats and rabbits .</TE>
<TE>   The more serious part of the human-coyote clash is that, according
to wildlife officials, some coyotes are getting more aggressive. In a
coyote's view, we humans are less intimidating than we look from a
distance. The dry weather also has drawn more coyotes to well-watered
suburbia.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California recorded 17 coyote attacks against humans in
2001. In the most serious incident, a coyote went after three
children at a San Clemente elementary school, biting one on the back
of the head. There were only three attacks the year before.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, the rains are here and that will mean more coyote
dining in the wild and less in frontyards.</TE>
<TE>   Officials are willing to kill aggressive coyotes, but further
effort is useless. Like any annoying neighbors, when old coyotes
leave or die, new ones move in. They also birth bigger litters when
heavily hunted. On the up side, they keep rat populations down.</TE>
<TE>   Wildlife officials keep telling humans the same things about how
to discourage coyotes: Bring your pets and their food indoors. Keep a
tight lid on trash. Less clever and adaptable than coyotes, humans
ignore this.</TE>

<LD>India's most powerful political party should take little solace from
its victory in elections in the state of Gujarat this month. Yes, it
won big, reversing a series of setbacks for the party in elections in
other states in the last few years. But the Bharatiya Janata Party,
led by Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, won on the ashes of those
killed in religious rioting this year. For a nation that prides
itself on its religious and other forms of diversity, and for being
the world's largest democracy, that's a pathetic foundation for
governing.</LD>
<LD>   Gujarat is a state in western India, just north of Bombay, that
was home to Mahatma Gandhi but is also known for its prosperous
workaholics. In February, however, it became known for its deadly
religious riots. Muslims set fire to a train carrying Hindus back
from a disputed religious site, killing 59. Hindus rampaged through
the streets in response, killing at least 1,000 people, most of them
Muslims. Months later, burned-out cars and piles of bricks from
destroyed houses littered the heart of the riot area. One block was
finally cleaned up hours before an August visit by India's president.</LD>
<TE>   The state's chief minister, Narendra Modi, did little to stop the
riots. Far from apologizing, he campaigned as the man needed to
protect Hindus against neighboring Pakistan, home to a Muslim
majority. After the election, Modi said his priorities would be
"progress, security and development." That's a welcome change from
putting "Hindu-ness" first, as he did in the campaign. Vajpayee also
promised to protect everyone's life and property and build a nation
free of discrimination. Vajpayee's party is built on a bedrock of
Hinduism, but the national elections aside, it has lost a series of
state elections over local and very secular issues like jobs and
safety.</TE>
<TE>   More than 80% of Indians are Hindu, but since independence in
1947, successive governments have stressed their concern for the
rights of other religions. Periodic bloodbaths have tested that
resolve, most notably the massacres at the time of independence as
many Muslims fled to what is now Pakistan and Hindus crossed into
India. Gujarat's government needs to show commitment to secular rule
by doing more to punish the rioters and to resettle Muslims forced to
flee.</TE>

<HD>Mixed Signals Over Threats</HD>
<DH>Though North Korea appears to be just as dangerous as Iraq,
Pyongyang has received little more than a tongue-lashing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>North Korea this week moved closer to building nuclear weapons,
drawing a muted response from the United States that reflects its
lack of leverage with the Stalinist regime. Washington's hesitance
about East Asia contrasts with months of hawkish pronouncements
regarding Iraq. The Bush administration could gain more support with
a better explanation of its different treatment of the two nations.</LD>
<LD>   North Korea in October admitted pursuing development of nuclear
weapons, violating a 1994 agreement. When the United States
retaliated by halting shipments of fuel oil, North Korea reopened a
plutonium reprocessing plant north of the capital and Wednesday was
said to be moving fuel rods into the nearby reactor area, a necessary
step for weapons production. Nuclear experts believe that the North
could build several nuclear weapons by next fall. That poses a great
danger from a country that has assassinated South Korean officials,
starves and brutalizes its own people and sells weapons to other
countries to stave off economic catastrophe.</LD>
<LD>   When North Korea reached about the same point in nuclear weapons
development in 1994, the Clinton administration beefed up U.S. troop
strength in South Korea and prepared to attack the North. The
Pentagon shipped Patriot missiles to Pusan and brought in more
advanced Apache attack helicopters.</LD>
<TE>   Washington mixed force and diplomacy then, dispatching former
President Carter to meet with North Korea's leader and getting help
from China, a close ally of Pyongyang that continues to oppose atomic
weapons on the Korean peninsula. This time around, the administration
has not gone beyond a few words of bluster from Defense Secretary
Donald H. Rumsfeld.</TE>
<TE>   The strikingly different treatment of two adversaries who seem
equally dangerous demands better explanation. One argument the Bush
administration could make for military action against Iraq, but
hasn't, is that a nuclear-armed Baghdad would be more dangerous than
North Korea. Iraq has used chemical weapons against Iran and Iraqi
Kurds in the 1980s and invaded Kuwait in 1990. Saddam Hussein is a
risk-taker unable to read the responses of other nations. He may
believe he could forestall invasion by threatening to use nuclear
weapons. Or, if challenged, he might use a weapon if he actually had
one. North Korea would be a far more dangerous war adversary, but has
in the past had a better sense of how far it could go without
provoking an international response.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon has announced that it plans to send 50,000 troops to
the Middle East in the coming weeks, doubling the number now near
Iraq. The buildup makes war more likely, despite this month's Los
Angeles Times poll, in which 72% of the respondents said the
president has not provided enough evidence against Iraq to justify
launching military action.</TE>
<TE>   If United Nations inspectors do not provide more evidence that
Iraq is developing chemical, biological or nuclear weapons, the
administration will have to fall back on Hussein's past belligerency
and violations of U.N. resolutions to argue that he is so dangerous
as to warrant invasion. That is unlikely to persuade the ordinary
Americans whose support the president will need if he sends U.S.
troops into battle.</TE>

<LD>Re "U.S. Has Precious, Yet Precarious, Ties With Qatar," Dec. 22: We
wouldn't be agonizing over Qatar were it not for the looming
possibility of war with Iraq. So the latter is the real subject at
hand, and here's the deal on that. It's this simple: You do not tell
the American people we are going to war. We are going to put your
sons and daughters, your husbands and wives, your brothers and
sisters in harm's way. They may die.</LD>
<LD>   But you do say: We have to wage this war. It's because we have
certain evidence against Iraq. No, we're not going to tell you what
evidence. You don't need to know. Just trust us.</LD>
<LD>   When a government issues such an edict, you don't have a
democracy, you have a dictatorship.</LD>

<TE>   During my military career I had access to intelligence information
obtained from sources above the top-secret level. I am aware of the
risks involved in divulging information obtained through these
sources. However, the present confrontation with Iraq places the
reputation of this country in jeopardy unless we produce overwhelming
evidence supporting our conviction that Iraq possesses weapons of
mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   There's an old saying: Put your money where your mouth is. In this
case a modification is in order: Put your proof where your mouth is.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It seems that we are getting closer to war against Iraq. The Al
Qaeda terrorists must be gleeful at the prospect of two of their
enemies killing one another without their having to throw one stone.
After a U.S. "victory," the Shiite Muslims of southern Iraq (more
friendly to Al Qaeda than the Sunni Muslims) probably would gain
control of Iraq and its oil. President Reagan was right that we were
better off with Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Our leaders should use "carrot" diplomacy by offering to not
attack Iraq and to lift sanctions in exchange for Iraq's help in
ending terrorism against Israel and establishing a PLO-less
Palestinian state. Our "stick" foreign policy will just create more
jihad against us.</TE>

<LD>Thank you for "The Plots and Designs of Al Qaeda's Engineer" (Dec.
22), your fascinating account of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, "the man who
engineered Sept. 11."</LD>
<LD>   In it we learn that Mohammed may well have been one of the "Abbie
Dahbies" [a local name for Middle Eastern students] at Chowan College
in North Carolina who was on the receiving end of some harmless
pranks, such as having his shoes (left in the hall according to
Middle Eastern custom) tossed in the lake or having a large
water-filled garbage bin propped against his door, set up to flood
his room when he answered a knock. Later, I guess, Mohammed got in a
few pranks of his own.</LD>

<LD>Although I'm no fan of Gov. Gray Davis, blaming him for the budget
crisis is not entirely fair. Why do those in the electorate get a
pass, who mostly vote overwhelmingly Democrat? Democrats like big
government, but in economic downturns revenues decline while spending
goes up automatically, with resulting deficits.</LD>
<LD>   A Dec. 22 letter writer suggested the state file for bankruptcy so
bondholders would not get a "free ride" in the budget debacle. Well,
gee, didn't the voters just pass several propositions authorizing new
bond issues for upward of $20 billion? It's Christmas, and no,
Virginia, there still isn't a Santa Claus.</LD>

<HD>Seeing the Blind Spot in Liberals' World View</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The curious thing about Neal Gabler's "The Media Bias Myth" (Opinion,
Dec. 22) is that it's a prime example of precisely the type of
unconscious liberal bias that conservatives so often complain about.
Specifically in regard to Gabler's presumption that Sen. Trent Lott's
(R-Miss.) history of gaffes, the Harken Energy matter and questions
regarding Vice President Dick Cheney's relationship with the energy
industries were matters worth any journalistic effort whatsoever, he
undermines his own premise.</LD>
<LD>   The conservative complaint has never been that there's a conscious
effort on the part of "mainstream media" to create a liberal bias in
news reporting. The complaint is simply that members of the media, by
and large, have a liberal worldview that affects both their choice of
subject matter and their methodology in gathering facts and reporting
their findings. It's that extraordinary blind spot, that continuing
pretense of neutrality, that ongoing insistence that there is no
leftward bias that gets conservatives' dander up. It's perfectly all
right for a journalist to have an opinion. The offense, of which The
Times itself is too often guilty, arises when opinion is reported as
if it were fact.</LD>
<LD>   Dennis Mallonee</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gabler's opinion piece and Steve Lopez's Dec. 22 column, "Here's a
Vast Conspiracy for You: to Kill Interest in Public Affairs,"
represent the cause and effect of the voter cynicism and low turnout
of the recent election. Between the cable shows and talk radio, the
constructive and necessary discourse that fuels a real democracy has
dissolved into name-calling and invective. There is no "other side"
of any issue. It seems the only people who get air time are the
pundits screaming us to sleep.</TE>
<TE>   David Ellis</TE>
<TE>   Sherman Oaks</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Good try, but the argument made by Gabler is weak at best.
Comparing the obvious and predominant leftist tilt in today's
mainstream media (The Times included) with the examples cited by
Gabler is laughable. I've read plenty on these subjects, and you'd
hear a heck of a lot more if there were anything substantial to them.
Think today's media would sit on their hands if they could destroy
Bush or Cheney? Why don't the mainstream media just admit they're
filled with a majority of left-leaning do-gooders and simply get on
with the business of fair and balanced reporting? In fact, that's the
only salient point Gabler made.</TE>
<TE>   Mitch Boehm</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to Gabler for his superb opinion piece on the media's
avoidance of controversy and lack of investigative reporting. With
headlines swinging back and forth between Pentagon press releases on
new weapons systems and titillating accounts of the latest Hollywood
or Washington scandal, the mainstream media sound more and more like
the tabloids. Fortunately, alternative news sources such as KPFK
radio, the Nation magazine and Salon.com are there to fill the void.</TE>

<HD>CSU: Trim the Fat Rather Than Raise Fees</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Chancellor Charles Reed and the California State University
Board of Trustees voted to raise student fees, they did so without a
complete examination of the CSU budget and a thorough study of the
alternatives (Dec. 17). Such an analysis would have uncovered layers
of budgetary "fat" that could be shed. The CSU could, for example,
delay implementation of its $400-million information technology
project, or pare administrative costs. Scaling back expenses not
central to its educational mission is a viable alternative to raising
revenue through student fee increases.</LD>
<LD>   In not taking the time to examine the alternatives, Reed and the
trustees have left students holding the bill. This is especially
distressing given the fact that the CSU draws many of its students
from low-income families. Even though Reed implies that the CSU is a
relative bargain, data from the College Board indicate that the total
cost of attending a CSU campus ($13,631) is actually more than the
average total cost of attendance at public four-year institutions
($13,463).</LD>

<LD>John Balzar ruins an otherwise thoughtful piece by answering his own
question ("What's wrong with America?") with meaningless statistical
gibberish (Commentary, Dec. 22). He says, "Nearly half of the white
population thinks the country is going in the right direction and
nearly two-thirds of African Americans see it headed wrong," as if
that expressed a meaningful racial dichotomy.</LD>
<LD>   Even without discounting for the lack of precision in typical
polls, that is "nearly" equivalent to simply saying that between half
and two-thirds of both races see the country headed in the wrong
direction. While that may not be cause for celebration at the White
House, if anything it suggests interracial consensus rather than
division. Perhaps a better answer would be that our poor grasp of
math fundamentals leaves us vulnerable to the misuse of polls and
statistics to exaggerate and oversimplify the racial and political
divisions between us.</LD>

<LD>President Theodore R. Mitchell of Occidental College pursues his
institution's well-being over California's by advocating government
scholarships for illegal immigrants ("Undocumented Student Aid,"
Voices, Dec. 21). Free college education adds another incentive for
people to pour in illegally, along with the subsidized housing,
medical care and welfare payments that we already offer.</LD>
<LD>   When did scholars forget about overpopulation? If Occidental's
faculty includes a demographer, Mitchell could learn that
California's population now equals a third of Mexico's and exceeds
Canada's.</LD>
<LD>   He could learn that our state and nation are growing at Third
World rates entirely because of recent world-record immigration,
despite American families averaging only two children (a no-growth
family size) for the past 30 years.</LD>
<TE>   If Occidental's faculty includes an ecologist, Mitchell could
learn that California is already overpopulated to the point that we
deforest the land, fish out the ocean, drain groundwater aquifers
faster than rain refills them and deplete our farmland's topsoil.
Indeed, Mitchell could learn this by reading The Times.</TE>
<TE>   California needs fewer people, not more. We can achieve this when
America's educational and political elites reduce immigration,
allowing America's small families to end our growth.</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth Pasternack</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell is again seeking to put his hand in the pocket of
taxpayers to fund higher education for those who should not be here.
It is enough that these illegal immigrants have received a high
school diploma at taxpayer expense.</TE>
<TE>   It does not matter that these people see themselves as American;
they are not, and it is not our obligation to educate citizens of
other nations. While a college-educated workforce might be vital to
this state's economy, people who are here illegally are not legally
allowed to work here. For every one of these students occupying a
space at a public college or university, a citizen was turned away.
Financial aid should be reserved for citizens.</TE>
<TE>   If money is left over it should be returned to the taxpayers, many
of whom are paying off their own student loans.</TE>

<HD>Murray Fields, 95; Helped Found Business Law Firm</HD>

<BD>By a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Murray M. Fields, the last surviving founder of the prominent Los
Angeles-based business law firm of Buchalter, Nemer, Fields &amp;
Younger, has died at the age of 95.</LD>
<LD>   Fields, who had regularly gone to his office until shortly before
his death, died Friday in his Studio City home, said the firm's
Ursula Bower.</LD>
<LD>   Established in 1948 by Fields, Irwin R. Buchalter and Jerry Nemer,
the small firm catered to mom-and-pop businesses and maintained a
cozy, family atmosphere.</LD>
<TE>   "This really is the end of an era," Bower said. "As long as Murray
was still walking these halls, people were always conscious of what
he would want done."</TE>
<TE>   Fields' specialties were general business law, real property and
construction law and legal malpractice.</TE>
<TE>   Educated at Duke and Columbia universities and New York University
School of Law, he began his legal practice in New York in 1935.</TE>
<TE>   Fields was admitted to the State Bar of California in 1947 and set
about forming the law firm. Highly respected among his colleagues,
Fields was a founding member of the Assn. of Business Trial Lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   Although he was based on the West Coast for much of his career,
Fields maintained contacts with his alma mater and in 1998 earned the
Judge Edward Weinfeld Award from the New York University School of
Law Alumni Assn. Fields also established a scholarship at the law
school.</TE>
<TE>   A widower with no children, he had no immediate survivors.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial donations may be sent to the Assn. of Business Trial
Lawyers, Box 351649, Los Angeles, CA 90035.</TE>

<HD>Grote Reber, 90; Helped Pioneer Radio Astronomy in Backyard</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Grote Reber, 90, a pioneer of radio astronomy who built an antenna
dish in his Wheaton, Ill., backyard in the 1930s and tuned it to
radio signals from space, died Dec. 20 of unspecified causes.</LD>
<LD>   He died in Tasmania, Australia, according to the National Radio
Astronomy Observatory in Socorro, N.M.</LD>
<LD>   Reber was the first person to build a radio telescope dedicated to
astronomy, opening a window on the universe that eventually produced
such landmark discoveries as quasars, pulsars and the remnant
afterglow of the Big Bang. His self-financed experiments laid the
foundation for today's advanced radio-astronomy facilities.</LD>
<TE>   A young engineering graduate and radio engineer, Reber decided to
follow up Karl Jansky's 1933 announcement of the discovery of radio
waves from space.</TE>
<TE>   In his spare time in 1937, Rever built a 9-meter dish antenna in
his backyard. Two years later, he managed to pick up some signals. In
1941, he produced the first radio map of the sky based on a series of
systematic observations.</TE>
<TE>   Reber's original dish antenna is on display at the National Radio
Astronomy Observatory's site in Green Bank, W.Va., where he worked in
the late 1950s. He later moved to Tasmaniam which is considered an
ideal place to study cosmic radio waves at very low frequencies.</TE>

<HD>Charley Lupica, 90; Baseball Fan Sat on Flagpole for His
Team</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Charley Lupica, 90, a Cleveland Indians fan who gained national
attention by sitting on a flagpole platform for 117 days during the
1949 baseball season, died Tuesday in Westlake, Ohio, a few months
after breaking both hips.</LD>
<LD>   Lupica manned his perch in an unsuccessful attempt to rally the
Indians to a second straight American League pennant. He handed out
business cards identifying himself as the "1949 Cleveland Indians
Flagpole Sitter."</LD>
<LD>   The Indians were in seventh place when Lupica climbed 60 feet to
the platform above his Cleveland delicatessen.</LD>
<TE>   He vowed not to come down until the team was on top of the
standings or was eliminated from the pennant race.</TE>
<TE>   Lupica missed the birth of a son during the vigil, which was
tracked by news crews and photographed for Life magazine.</TE>
<TE>   The Indians finished third that year. After the team was put out
of contention, club owner Bill Veeck sent a truck and transported the
pole, with Lupica still on the platform, to Municipal Stadium. On
Sept. 25, the last day of the season, 34,000 fans cheered as Lupica
left his perch.</TE>

<KH>SURROUNDINGS LEIMERT PARK VILLAGE</KH>
<HD>Sudden Rise in Rents Threatens Area's Identity</HD>
<DH>Some merchants decide to move after new landlord raises
rates, but others will fight to maintain the enclave as a center of
black culture.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John L. Mitchell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When a new landlord raised rents on a row of storefronts along a
stretch of Leimert Park Village, artist Kisasi Ramsess responded by
slashing prices and declaring a "move-out sale" at his studio and
gallery.</LD>
<LD>   Ramsess is not the only store owner talking about pulling up
stakes.</LD>
<LD>   The World Stage began shopping for larger digs for its jazz and
poetry performances. Hairstylist Stewart Clemons of Venusian Locks is
closing down after more than two decades in the same location. He
received an eviction notice this month after he got behind on his
rent.</LD>
<TE>   "It's like something is dying," said Ramsess, whose rent went from
$1,000 to $2,300 a month. "The flavor of the street will change. With
these rents, the only businesses I can see opening up in here are
salons and wig shops, nothing artistic."</TE>
<TE>   But others plan to hold on to their roots, saying they will fight
to stay, not wanting to see Leimert Park Village fade as a center of
black life.</TE>
<TE>   Since the 1980s, Leimert Park shop owners have tried to transform
this short block of Colonial-style storefronts on Degnan Boulevard
into a pedestrian-friendly enclave of African American culture. Some
shop owners say that the increasing rents are a sign that the area
has turned around, and that years of work to promote culture and
reduce crime have made the shop owners victims of their own success.</TE>
<TE>   Outside Ramsess' studio is a collection of artwork that took two
decades to build: paintings, stained glass windows, etchings and
posters, and cards with his black and white ink drawings of jazz
musicians, blues singers and political leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Russell Associates, a Sherman Oaks company, began notifying store
owners of the increases in August shortly after it purchased the row
of nine storefronts from the family of Jack Sidney, a Manhattan Beach
landlord who tried to nurture the area's identity by keeping rents
below market rates. Russell Associates declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   "Jack had another approach," recalled Ramsess, a 46-year-old
artist. "He didn't just come by to collect rent; he talked to people.
He'd say, 'If you can't pay your rent, do something for the building.
Put some art on the walls.' " Jackie Ryan, who co-owns Zambezi
Bazaar, an African craft and gift store, with her sister, rejects the
notion of being victimized by an increase that sent her rent from
$645 to $1,000 a month.</TE>
<TE>   "Culture has supplanted the negative elements," Ryan said. "We
created this space to stay, and we will wage a struggle to stay."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the row of stores, which runs on Degnan through
the center of the village between 43rd Street and 43rd Place, just
east of Crenshaw Boulevard, has matured as a center for
entertainment, dinning and shopping with an Afrocentric theme.
Buildings have been spruced up, and the city has pumped thousands of
dollars into a face lift for the park, which hosts numerous festivals
including celebrations for Kwanzaa, jazz and Malcolm X's birthday.
The city's Cultural Affairs Department has a detailed plan to utilize
the city-owned Vision Theater to make Leimert Park Village a center
for music.</TE>
<TE>   Some merchants said their efforts to discuss their plans for the
neighborhood have been rebuffed by the new owners.</TE>
<TE>   "The new owners are not interested in anything other than
receiving the rent," said Laura Hendrix, president of the Leimert
Park Merchants Assn. "We wrote a letter to them to let them know they
didn't just invest in a building, they invested in a community that
is proud and moving forward."</TE>
<TE>   Hendrix said that the merchants set up a meeting for next month
with Mayor James K. Hahn in the hopes that he would intervene by
bringing together the new owners and shopkeepers to discuss what can
be done to preserve the area.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not businesspeople," said Clint Rosemond, executive
director of World Stage, a 46-seat jazz workshop/theater where rents
jumped from $560 to $1,020. "Artists are always on the edge in terms
of cash flow and paying bills."</TE>
<TE>   The consequence of uneven cash flow was demonstrated last summer,
when another landlord evicted the owner of Museum in Black for
failing to pay back rent. The owner was in the midst of packing
thousands of pieces in slave- and civil rights-era artifacts when a
donor contributed $20,000 to save the museum.</TE>
<TE>   That's one reason that many were hoping that the new owner would
be as compassionate as the one they had. But even compassion can
result in setbacks.</TE>
<TE>   "It lulls you into a false sense of security," said Rosemond of
low rents that increase suddenly to market rate.</TE>
<TE>   "We became comfortable and didn't keep our eyes on the prize," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   And for many, the prize was just finding a way to stay in business
or figuring out what the next move should be.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a kind of wake-up call for us," Rosemond said. "This will
shake the status quo and require us to think in ways we didn't think
before."</TE>
<TE>   While World Stage searches for a new location, other shop owners
are less certain about what the future holds.</TE>
<TE>   Phyllis Battle, a singer who performs worldwide and uses her
studio to teach voice, wants to stay, but she wonders what the new
owners have in store for the property.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish they would tell us something," she said. "I'd like to
know: Are they going to remodel the buildings or tear them down?"</TE>
<TE>   Nzinga Kimbrough, who plans to stick it out with her sister at
Zambezi Bazaar, said there was an important lesson.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to own the land," she said. "Next, they could turn this
place into a manicure shop."</TE>

<HD>3 Arrested in Slayings of Michigan Family Members</HD>
<DH>A Detroit-area jeweler, his mother and his three children
were shot at their home. Prosecutor is expected to decide on charges
today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LIVONIA, Mich.</DL>
<LD>Police have arrested three suspects in the execution-style slayings
of five family members during an apparent robbery at their suburban
Detroit home.</LD>
<LD>   Wayne County Prosecutor Mike Duggan was expected to decide today
what charges to bring after the arrests, announced late Tuesday. He
said he was "very confident that the Livonia police have the people
that are responsible for these murders in custody."</LD>
<LD>   Suburban Detroit jeweler Marco Pesce, 38; his mother, Maria
Vergati, 68; and Pesce's three children, Melissa, 6, Sabrina, 9, and
Carlo, 12, were gunned down in Pesce's home Saturday. Vergati was
visiting from Italy.</LD>
<TE>   Police said the slayings took place between 4 and 7:15 p.m.
Saturday. They said the house had been ransacked.</TE>
<TE>   Police said a call from Carlo Pesce to his father at the family's
jewelry store asking him to come home may have been prompted by the
killers.</TE>
<TE>   Marco Pesce owned Italia Jewelry and the strip mall in which the
shop was located about two miles from his home.</TE>
<TE>   He was divorced from the children's 36-year-old mother and cited
her use of crack cocaine in court papers about custody of their
children.</TE>
<TE>   In January, a court gave him temporary custody of the children and
ordered her to move out of their home because of her drug use.</TE>
<TE>   Diane Pesce was at an Ann Arbor rehabilitation center on the day
of the slayings and was visited by her ex-husband just hours before
his death, said her father, Samuel Jameel.</TE>
<TE>   Police said she had been questioned and was not a suspect.</TE>
<TE>   Duggan and Police Chief Peter Kunst said authorities picked up two
suspects in Detroit and later arrested a third in the Flint area.</TE>
<TE>   "We've executed a number of search warrants and recovered key
pieces of evidence," the chief said.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, police said no additional information was being
released about the suspects or the case until at least today because
the investigation was continuing.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor's son attended school with Sabrina Pesce.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to explain to my son that he had lost one of his classmates
over the holidays," Duggan said.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Preservationists are cleaning and photographing hundreds of burned,
battered and twisted World Trade Center relics at an isolated airport
hangar to create a catalog for museum curators and memorial planners
worldwide.</LD>
<LD>   About 700 objects were plucked from the 1.6 million tons of debris
by a team of architects working for the trade center owner, the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey. Among them: five floor slabs
compressed into a 3-foot-thick pancake, a bus-sized chunk of the
north tower antenna, a crushed firetruck with its ladder twisted into
a candy cane shape.</LD>
<LD>   In a parking lot outside the former Tower Air hangar at Kennedy
International Airport, several crushed cars covered in tarps sit next
to more piles of twisted steel, an elevator motor the size of a
refrigerator and the commuter train cars that were found buried in
the seven-story-deep pit that was the trade center basement.</LD>
<TE>   Shortly after the terrorist assault that killed about 2,800
people, museums around the world began requesting items from the
disaster.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of things that are very evocative of the life of
the World Trade Center as it existed, and of course, a lot of
material that documents the day of Sept. 11," said Sarah Henry, vice
president for programs at the Museum of the City of New York. "The
tremendous physical forces unleashed that day are frozen in time."</TE>
<TE>   The Port Authority has not yet designated specific pieces to any
museum or memorial organization, said Mark Wagner, one of the
architects on the project.</TE>
<TE>   The team expects all 700 artifacts to be decontaminated and
cataloged within six months, and then be available to lend out.</TE>
<TE>   "Eventually, if a museum is interested in a particular piece they
can flip through the catalog and identify it by number," Wagner said.
"The catalog, once that's available, kind of gives them a shopping
list."</TE>
<TE>   Some items are surprisingly rare -- such as pieces of the towers
with glass still intact. Since the Port Authority provided $6 million
last year for the World Trade Center Archive project, the team has
come across glass "maybe twice," Wagner said. Nearly all of the glass
was pulverized in the collapse.</TE>
<TE>   One symbol of the destruction, the widely photographed
100-foot-tall, 80-foot-wide jagged fragment of the north tower's
north wall, has been dismantled and lies in pieces.</TE>
<TE>   It would have to be reassembled to be used in a memorial, as city
officials suggested when it was pulled down on Dec. 15, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The facade pieces are laid out in the 85,000-square-foot hangar
next to the 62-ton south tower column that was the last piece of
steel left standing after the collapse. A temperature-controlled room
houses the column, surrounded by five U.S. flags.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the hangar are about 10 sections of the north tower's
350-foot-tall antenna -- one of the last images visible in the dust
as the building collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   Another climate-controlled room is being planned to store smaller
items, like a copy of the New York Times from June 23, 1969, when the
towers were being constructed. It was found inside a steel column.
Wagner theorizes it was stuffed there by a construction worker.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush worked out in the gym with his father and walked
through the snow with his daughters as the first family celebrated
Christmas at the Camp David retreat in Maryland.</LD>
<LD>   Three generations of the presidential family exchanged presents
Wednesday morning, then sat down for a brunch of pancakes and
waffles, White House spokesman Taylor Gross said.</LD>
<LD>   The president and his father, former President Bush, got in a
workout before brunch, then Bush took a walk with his twin daughters,
Jenna and Barbara.</LD>
<TE>   Gross declined to reveal any details of the gift-giving, saying it
was private.</TE>
<TE>   Other family members at Camp David were Bush's brothers Neil and
Marvin, and their families; his sister, Dorothy Koch; his mother,
Barbara; First Lady Laura Bush's mother, Jenna Welch; and the
family's cat and two dogs.</TE>
<TE>   The Christmas Day dinner included beef tenderloin, potatoes,
creamed spinach and hot rolls.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, military and civilian employees assigned to Camp
David were invited to have Christmas dinner at the retreat. The
president and first lady planned to stop by and wish them a Merry
Christmas, Gross said.</TE>

<HD>Freed Chinese Dissident Feels Thrilled, Daunted</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A Chinese democracy activist who was released from jail and flown to
the United States is overjoyed by his new freedom but awed by the
task of starting his life over at 59, his daughter said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Xu Wenli, freed after four years in a Chinese prison, spent the
day catching up with his family and sleeping off jet lag after
arriving in New York, said his daughter, Xu Jin.</LD>
<LD>   "It's overwhelmingly joyful," the daughter said. "There are just a
lot of emotions, and it's going to be hard. To start your life all
over -- that's tough, but we'll get through."</LD>
<TE>   Xu Wenli was jailed after trying to set up the opposition China
Democracy Party with other activists. The Communist government
quickly crushed the party and sent dozens of members to prison,
sentencing Xu to 13 years.</TE>
<TE>   He was freed Tuesday after intense lobbying by Clark Randt, the
American ambassador to Beijing, and repeated requests for his freedom
by U.S. legislators visiting China.</TE>
<TE>   The release came a week after U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
Lorne Craner said he had appealed to Chinese officials during human
rights talks in Beijing to free Xu.</TE>
<TE>   Xu and his wife, He Xintong, flew from Beijing to Chicago, where
they met 30-year-old daughter Xu Jin. The family then flew to New
York City.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to be a free man, to be with my wife and daughter," Xu
Wenli said after touching down at New York's La Guardia International
Airport. "Because of them I am free."</TE>
<TE>   Xu is the first person convicted of endangering state security --
a charge that has been used against leading Chinese dissidents -- to
be released early from prison, according to American human rights
activists.</TE>
<TE>   He was also arrested in 1979 for advocating greater political
freedoms during the Democracy Wall movement. He was imprisoned from
1982 to 1993 on charges of counterrevolution.</TE>
<TE>   The family is staying with friends in Manhattan for a few days
before traveling to Pawtucket, R.I., where Xu Jin lives and teaches
at a private high school.</TE>
<TE>   Xu Jin said in a telephone interview that her father had not yet
determined what he would do in the United States. "I think we'll just
go around to see friends, and enjoy vacation, and then go on to a new
life," she said. "We'll take it one day at a time."</TE>
<TE>   Xu, who suffers from hepatitis B, was granted medical parole by
the Chinese government.</TE>
<TE>   China has rid itself of other prominent political prisoners by
paroling them on health grounds -- usually on condition that they go
into exile, most often in the United States, where they lose their
political influence in China.</TE>

<HD>Lawmakers Question FAA's Ability to Keep Struggling
Airlines Safe</HD>
<DH>The agency must ensure that corners aren't cut at carriers
in Chapter 11. One legislator proposes more money, personnel shifts
to accomplish this.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>When an airline is in financial distress, the Federal Aviation
Administration increases vigilance to ensure that maintenance isn't
compromised. But with two huge airlines in Chapter 11 and the FAA
facing criticism for not doing enough to monitor a third, some
lawmakers question whether the agency is up to the task.</LD>
<LD>   Rep. John L. Mica (R-Fla.), chairman of the House aviation
subcommittee, said the FAA needs more money to do the job. He also
said he may write legislation ordering that FAA personnel be shifted
to that task.</LD>
<LD>   "There have been many more people killed due to maintenance
defects and lack of inspection and oversight than in all the
terrorist acts combined in this country," Mica said. "We do have some
airlines in deep financial trouble, and it's important we have
inspections to make certain they're operating safe aircraft and that
proper maintenance is adhered to."</LD>
<TE>   The FAA has 3,300 aviation safety inspectors to monitor 139
airlines, 637,000 active pilots, 273,000 mechanics, 7,600 commercial
aircraft, 11,000 charter aircraft and 220,000 private planes,
according to an audit by the Transportation Department's inspector
general.</TE>
<TE>   FAA inspectors analyze data, review paperwork and conduct spot
checks of airlines' maintenance programs. Labor unrest, financial
woes and rapid growth are among the things that prompt increased
supervision.</TE>
<TE>   Many U.S. air carriers have struggled financially since last
year's terrorist attacks. Major airlines expect to lose about $10
billion this year, according to Delta Air Lines CEO Leo Mullin. And
they have cut about 100,000 jobs since Sept. 11, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   United Airlines, the second-largest U.S. carrier, and
fifth-biggest US Airways declared bankruptcy this year. The FAA was
faulted by the National Transportation Safety Board for its
supervision of Alaska Airlines.</TE>
<TE>   But spokeswoman Diane Spitaliere said the FAA believes it has
enough people to monitor maintenance at all airlines.</TE>
<TE>   And FAA spokesman Greg Martin said the cyclical nature of the
aviation business has conditioned the agency to deal with a number of
troubled airlines at once.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been here before, so there's nothing particularly
extraordinary that would leave us unprepared," Martin said.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the bankruptcies have some worried.</TE>
<TE>   "The FAA is stretched pretty thin," said Bill Waldock, professor
of safety science at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in
Prescott, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   "They've had difficulty in responding to a circumstance like a
bankrupt airline, where there's pressure to cut costs."</TE>
<TE>   Eastern Airlines was fined $3.5 million for falsifying work
records on its fleet soon after declaring bankruptcy in 1991. Rep.
James L. Oberstar (D-Minn.) presided during oversight hearings
concerning Eastern, which no longer operates.</TE>
<TE>   "The carriers say they never compromise on maintenance, but
there's a downward pressure," Oberstar said.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Goodrich, a spokeswoman for the union that represents FAA
inspectors, said bankrupt airlines require much closer oversight. For
example, instead of simply checking records concerning how often jet
tires are rotated, an inspector goes to a bankrupt airline's
maintenance facility and examines the tires.</TE>
<TE>   She estimates the FAA needs 500 more inspectors and 100 more
administrators to do the job properly.</TE>
<TE>   "We are so thin, we do minimally what we can do and depend a lot
on our expertise," said Goodrich, who was an inspector for 20 years.
"We should all be terribly concerned."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.) said he's concerned the FAA feels
pressure from Congress and the White House to hold the line on
staffing. "If they're going to do some enhanced on-the-ground
surveillance, they're going to have to ask for more personnel," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say airlines that grow quickly also present problems for
the FAA, which hasn't always increased supervision as fast as an
airline has added planes.</TE>
<TE>   Alaska Airlines experienced a number of maintenance problems
during a period of rapid expansion several years ago. The NTSB this
month blamed faulty maintenance and poor FAA oversight for the Jan.
31, 2000, crash off the Ventura County coast that killed all 88
aboard an Alaska Airlines jet.</TE>
<TE>   The agency has increased inspectors since then and the airline
improved maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   Spitaliere said she doesn't know how many airlines are under
heightened surveillance now. "We usually don't go into specifics,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   But increased oversight doesn't necessarily require more
inspectors, Spitaliere said.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Bozin, vice president of safety and regulatory compliance at
US Airways, said he met with FAA officials the day after the airline
declared bankruptcy in August. The airline, which hopes to emerge
from bankruptcy early next year, quickly enhanced its internal
maintenance oversight, Bozin said.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't allow ourselves to have any missteps," he said. "We
realize there is that potential because of the distraction factor
that is there."</TE>

<HD>Doctor on FDA Panel Is Criticized</HD>
<DH>Women's groups cite the Kentucky physician's record
concerning abortion, birth control.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A physician who has been criticized for his views concerning birth
control was named this week to a Food and Drug Administration panel
on women's health policy.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. W. David Hager, a University of Kentucky
obstetrician-gynecologist, was among 11 physicians appointed Tuesday
to the FDA's Advisory Committee for Reproductive Health Drugs.</LD>
<LD>   Hager has questioned the safety of the abortion pill RU-486, and
acknowledges that he opposes abortions.</LD>
<TE>   Abortion-rights activists are concerned about Hager's appointment
because he participated in a Christian Medical Assn. campaign this
year that attempted to reverse the FDA committee's 1996
recommendation that led to RU-486 being approved.</TE>
<TE>   The National Organization for Women and six other groups that
support abortion rights have called Hager's selection a conflict of
interest.</TE>
<TE>   The Planned Parenthood Federation of America on Tuesday called the
appointment of Hager and other doctors on the panel "a frontal
assault on reproductive rights that will imperil women's health."</TE>
<TE>   It said Hager and his wife, Linda, have recommended "specific
Scripture readings and prayers for such ailments as headaches and
premenstrual syndrome."</TE>
<TE>   But Hager, a part-time professor of obstetrics and gynecology at
the University of Kentucky College of Medicine, said his beliefs
won't compromise his judgment.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, I'm pro-life," he told the Courier-Journal of Louisville.
"But that's not going to keep me from objectively evaluating
medication.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe there are some [RU-486] safety concerns and they should
be evaluated."</TE>
<TE>   Hager also has condemned the birth control pill, used by about 10
million U.S. women, saying it provides a convenient way for young
people to be sexually active outside of marriage.</TE>
<TE>   But Hager said he does not deny birth control prescriptions to
unmarried women.</TE>
<TE>   The advisory committee has not met for two years, and its entire
membership had lapsed. Its job is to review and evaluate data -- and
make recommendations -- concerning the safety and effectiveness of
marketed and experimental drugs for use in obstetrics, gynecology and
related specialties.</TE>
<TE>   It will be chaired by Dr. Linda C. Giudice, the chief of
reproductive endocrinology and infertility for the department of
gynecology and obstetrics at Stanford University Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   FDA Commissioner Mark McClellan said the panel "will provide
sound, science-based advice on reproductive health issues that will
improve women's lives across the country."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Hager and Giudice, the other physicians appointed
to the panel are Leslie Gay Bernitsky, a urologist from Albuquerque;
Susan A. Crockett of the University of Texas Health Science Center at
San Antonio; Nancy Dickey, chancellor of the Texas A&amp;M College of
Medicine; Scott Shields Emerson of the University of Washington,
Seattle; Michael Furman Greene of Massachusetts General Hospital in
Boston; Vivian Lewis of the University of Rochester Medical Center in
New York; George A. Marcones of the University of Pennsylvania,
Philadelphia; Valerie Montgomery Rice of the University of Kansas
Medical Center in Kansas City; and Joseph Barney Stanford of the
University of Utah, Salt Lake City.</TE>

<HD>Justice Department Attorneys' Conduct to Be Investigated</HD>
<DH>Federal judge criticizes the lawyers for letters mailed to
plaintiffs in a class-action suit filed on behalf of 300,000 Native
Americans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A federal judge this week ordered a court ethics panel to investigate
six Justice Department attorneys for their conduct in a landmark
class-action suit against the government that seeks billions of
dollars and was filed on behalf of more than 300,000 Native
Americans.</LD>
<LD>   In a 20-page opinion, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth also
blocked the Interior and Justice departments from continuing to send
mass mailings to the Indian plaintiffs that include a provision that
would terminate the Indians' rights to claim damages, even as the
lawsuit continues.</LD>
<LD>   Lamberth already has held three Cabinet officials in contempt of
court for their failures in Indian trust fund reform, including
Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton. His most recent order in the
6-year-old case, signed late Tuesday, said government attorneys
failed to ask for the court's permission to send the notices to more
than 1,100 plaintiffs.</LD>
<TE>   That was a clear violation of rules governing attorney conduct, he
wrote, and referred the issue to the disciplinary panel of U.S.
District Court here.</TE>
<TE>   "The court ... is at an utter loss to understand why defendants
thought this court would consider it acceptable for them to include
language [in the letters] that extinguishes the very rights that are
the heart of this class-action litigation," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The court's Committee on Grievances, which investigates
allegations of misconduct, could dismiss the case or issue a range of
sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just astonishing," said Keith Harper, an attorney for the
Native American Rights Fund, who is helping to represent plaintiffs.
"They communicated with our clients in violation of court orders,
even when the issue was pending before the judge."</TE>
<TE>   Calls to the Justice Department's press office were not returned.
In court motions filed earlier, attorneys had said they did not think
they were required to inform the court about the letters.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Wright, a spokesman for the Interior Department, declined to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   The Indian plaintiffs are seeking a full historical accounting of
the Individual Indian Monies trust fund, a sprawling series of
accounts started in 1887 when the government forced Indian tribes off
90 million acres of their land.</TE>
<TE>   In return, they and their heirs were granted royalties from the
sale of oil, gas, timber, mineral and other rights on an additional
11 million acres.</TE>
<TE>   The fund now generates more than $500 million a year to at least
300,000 account holders, although so many records have been lost or
incompetently kept over the decades that the government is unable to
provide an accurate history for a single account.</TE>
<TE>   The Indians filed suit in 1996, claiming the government owes them
at least $10 billion in lost or missing funds.</TE>
<TE>   But in October, with the trust fund under Lamberth's oversight,
the government sent out 1,100 notices to trust fund account holders,
claiming that enclosed statements were full and accurate historical
accounts.</TE>
<TE>   The data would be "final and cannot be appealed" unless the
recipient filed a challenge within 60 days, the note said.</TE>
<TE>   The Interior and Justice departments were planning to send an
additional 14,235 historical accounts when Lamberth blocked the move
this week.</TE>
<TE>   The attorneys Lamberth referred for investigation are Assistant
Atty. Gen. Robert D. McCallum Jr., as well as Stuart E. Schiffer, J.
Christopher Kohn, Sandra P. Spooner, John T. Stemplewicz and Cynthia
L. Alexander.</TE>
<TE>   Lamberth's order says that any other attorneys, either from
Justice or Interior, who participated in the mailings also should be
investigated.</TE>

<HD>Pulling the Plug on Christmas Tradition</HD>
<DH>Connecticut man put on elaborate display for 35 years.
People now lack 'spirit of giving,' he says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KILLINGLY, Conn.</DL>
<LD>For 35 years, Mervin Whipple has personally greeted -- and counted --
an estimated 1.4 million visitors from all over the country to his
renowned annual Christmas Wonderland. The free display boasts 120,000
lights and moving figures.</LD>
<LD>   But the man known as Mr. Christmas may finally be pulling the plug
on the tradition. Whipple said that, when he turns off the lights at
9 p.m. Jan. 1, he won't be turning them back on.</LD>
<LD>   It's not just his age, though he is 74. And it's not just the
cost, though the season's bill ran $18,000 last year -- $4,000 for
the electric bill alone.</LD>
<TE>   No, Christmas Wonderland is closing because there's just not
enough Christmas spirit.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole attitude of people has changed in 35 years," Whipple
said. "The spirit of giving isn't nowhere near as much as the spirit
of receiving."</TE>
<TE>   Christmas Wonderland, in the Ballouville section of this eastern
Connecticut town, began in 1967 with a Nativity scene and 225 lights.
It's grown each year, but Whipple says he's never lost sight of his
original focus.</TE>
<TE>   "It's giving and doing for somebody else; that's just exactly how
I feel," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He's gone from dozens of volunteers in years past to four this
year.</TE>
<TE>   That's not enough, Whipple says, as the display takes months to
set up even with 20 people working on it.</TE>
<TE>   The display includes two life-size toy soldiers standing guard in
the driveway, as well as Snow White and the seven dwarfs. Several
dozen glass-fronted wood crates, 10 feet high, house more animated
scenes.</TE>
<TE>   There's a horse and carriage bearing figures in Victorian
costumes, and a family of mice asleep in bed with a Christmas tree
sparkling in the corner. A trio of white-robed angels beam
benevolently, Mrs. Claus knits a cap for Santa, and all of the
reindeer are stabled near a life-size figure of Uncle Sam.</TE>
<TE>   And although Whipple has always operated his Wonderland with the
notion that he will never charge admission, the donation box stowed
discreetly in the corner of the showroom has been embarrassingly
empty. Last year, the first two days of donations brought in less
than half a cent per person.</TE>
<TE>   Those who grew up on regular visits to Christmas Wonderland say
Whipple threatens to close down every year, but agree it will be a
big loss when he finally does.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tradition," said Ryan Doyle, 21, of Killingly.</TE>
<TE>   "All the little kids, when they grow up, they'll be like, 'That
was so nice.' "</TE>

<HD>Nixon Ordered Secret Nuclear Alert Amid Vietnam War</HD>
<DH>The tactic was designed to scare Soviets into forcing
concessions from North Vietnamese.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Nixon ordered a worldwide secret nuclear alert in October
1969, calling his wartime tactic a "madman strategy" aimed at scaring
the Soviets into forcing concessions from North Vietnam, newly
declassified documents show.</LD>
<LD>   It didn't work, as Moscow displayed no concern. The reason is
unclear. The Soviets may not have cared, may not have been as
influential as Nixon believed -- or, like the rest of the world,
might not have noticed the alert.</LD>
<LD>   The aim of the alert was kept secret from even the generals who
put it into place.</LD>
<TE>   The bluff was part of what Nixon described as a "madman strategy"
to his new administration at the outset of 1969: ratcheting up
military pressure on the North Vietnamese at unpredictable intervals
to pressure them into concessions at peace talks in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   Nixon believed this would accelerate accommodation by the North
Vietnamese, forcing them into an agreement that would leave U.S. ally
South Vietnam in place.</TE>
<TE>   Among declassified documents published this week by the
independent National Security Archive is a memo to national security
advisor Henry A. Kissinger from his assistant, Gen. Alexander M. Haig
Jr. It described plans to signal "U.S. intent to escalate military
operations in Vietnam in the face of continued enemy intransigence in
Paris."</TE>
<TE>   Among the "signals" in Haig's March 2 outline: bombing enemy
positions in Cambodia. On March 17, Nixon launched a massive secret
bombing campaign against communist bases in that country.</TE>
<TE>   Despite such pressures, the Paris talks remained deadlocked, and
Nixon began to contemplate the nuclear alert in the summer of 1969.</TE>
<TE>   A memo telegraphed Oct. 19 from Gen. Earle Wheeler, the Joint
Chiefs of Staff chairman, to all his commanders in chief ordered a
"series of actions during the period 13 October - 25 October to test
our military readiness in selected areas worldwide to respond to
possible confrontation by the Soviet Union. These actions should be
discernible to the Soviets, but not threatening in themselves."</TE>
<TE>   He recommended grounding combat aircraft in selected areas for
readiness checks, periods of radio silence and increased surveillance
of Soviet ships -- all actions that suggested posturing for a nuclear
conflict, and which the Americans believed the Soviets were sure to
notice. A later "talking points" document showed Wheeler also ordered
heightened combat readiness for ground troops.</TE>
<TE>   The alert spread far beyond the Southeast Asian theater, and
included U.S. forces in the Middle East and Europe.</TE>
<TE>   The commanders carrying out the orders did not know the purpose of
the exercise. Wheeler told them only that "we have been directed by a
higher authority," an apparent reference to Nixon's immediate policy
circle.</TE>
<TE>   In an Oct. 17 diary entry, White House Chief of Staff H.R.
Haldeman wrote: Kissinger "has all sorts of signal-type activity
going on around the world to try to jar the Soviets and NVN," or
North Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   Keeping the secret to a small circle of advisors prevented leaks
as well as widespread panic and protest, anathema to Nixon's plans to
tightly control the war maneuvering. But it may have backfired.</TE>
<TE>   According to a report on the nuclear alert in the January 2003
issue of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Soviet Ambassador
Anatoly Dobrynin betrayed no knowledge -- or concern -- of the
nuclear alert in a meeting with a U.S. official a few days after the
alert.</TE>

<HD>INS Releases Haitian Teen to His Sister</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>A young Haitian migrant named Noel, one of the 11 unaccompanied
minors who came ashore with more than 200 other Haitians when their
wooden freighter ran aground in late October, was released from INS
custody Christmas Eve, officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Jimmy Noel, 16, was released from detention by Immigration and
Naturalization Service officials and placed with his sister Chimene
Noel, 24.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the best Christmas I can remember," the boy said in his
native Creole. "It's the best Christmas gift I've ever had."</LD>
<TE>   INS spokeswoman Ana Santiago said she believed Noel was the first
person released since the boat carrying about 220 Haitians ran ashore
near the Rickenbacker Causeway on Oct. 29. She could not say why the
boy was released or when the other unaccompanied minors would be
freed.</TE>
<TE>   Miami-based attorney and Haitian activist Cheryl Little said the
boy will still have to fight deportation, but could stay in the
United States through the asylum process or sponsorship by a close
relative.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the adult Haitian migrants who came ashore have been held
at the Krome Detention Center in southwest Miami-Dade County, despite
protests from activists and pleas to government officials to free the
detainees.</TE>

<HD>$315-Million Lottery Winner</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>DES MOINES</DL>
<LD>Somewhere in West Virginia, someone is about to celebrate a green
Christmas.</LD>
<LD>   One winning ticket was sold in that state for the nearly
$315-million Powerball lottery Wednesday night, according to a
spokesman for contest operator the Multi-State Lottery Assn.</LD>
<LD>   The winning numbers were 5, 14, 16, 29 and 53 and the "Powerball"
was 7.</LD>
<TE>   The jackpot was the largest ever taken by a single Powerball
ticket, association spokesman Joe Mahoney said; it was the
third-largest lottery jackpot in U.S. history. Powerball, the
nation's largest lottery game, is played in 23 states, the District
of Columbia and the Virgin Islands.</TE>
<TE>   The winner, who has not been identified, now has to decide whether
to take the 29-year annuity or the cash option worth $170,505,876.
The ticket holder will have 60 days after the ticket is validated to
make that decision, Mahoney said.</TE>
<TE>   The whopping Powerball jackpot jumped to $314.9 million shortly
before the numbers were drawn Wednesday night, making it the biggest
jackpot in the history of the multi-state lottery.</TE>
<TE>   The new jackpot came after holiday sales were much higher than
expected, Mahoney said.</TE>
<TE>   "We were always planning on Wednesday, Christmas Day, to be a very
light day for sales," he said. "Monday and Tuesday were much higher
than we expected them to be, and [Christmas] ... was much higher than
we anticipated it to be."</TE>
<TE>   But because gas stations and convenience stores -- typical lottery
retailers -- were open Christmas Day, throngs of people ventured out
to get a piece of the action.</TE>
<TE>   "That's about all I'm selling today," said Mike Green, manager of
a QuikTrip store in Des Moines. "A lot of people are buying them for
gifts."</TE>
<TE>   At a Kum &amp; Go convenience store in Des Moines, customers bought as
many as 100 tickets each.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Nichols, who stopped by before his Christmas dinner,
didn't think it was a big purchase.</TE>
<TE>   "When you don't buy them very often, it's not that much," Nichols
said. "We're just about ready to eat, so I said, 'I got to do an
errand here.' "</TE>
<TE>   Ticket sales in Iowa were considerably lower Wednesday than on
Christmas Eve, said Mary Neubauer, spokeswoman for the Iowa Lottery.</TE>
<TE>   "We expected people to go out and do their last-minute shopping,
including their Powerball shopping, [on Tuesday] and then be at home
[Wednesday]," Neubauer said.</TE>
<TE>   To help last-minute Powerball players find their way to a ticket
seller, the District of Columbia Lottery took out a newspaper ad
listing about 90 places open Christmas Day that sell the tickets.</TE>
<TE>   One first-time player, Bill Sanders, 60, of Mission, Kan., bought
his ticket Wednesday at a gas station.</TE>
<TE>   If the single ticket he bought was the winner, he said, "I'd
probably travel the world and live a lot different than I do now."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest lottery jackpot in the country's history was a Big
Game prize of $363 million, won in May 2000 by ticket-holders in
Michigan and Illinois. The second was a $331-million Big Game jackpot
split among three tickets in April this year.</TE>

<HD>FAA Restricts Airspace Over NYC, Pasadena for New Year's</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A temporary flight ban was imposed over the Statue of Liberty and
Midtown Manhattan for New Year's Eve because of possible security
risks ahead of high-profile festivities.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Aviation Administration on Tuesday also issued flight
restrictions along the Rose Parade route in Pasadena, at the state's
request, as a security precaution at the event expected to draw
thousands of people.</LD>
<LD>   "The temporary flight restrictions are in effect for security
reasons," FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said. She added that the Rose
Parade has had such limits in place for years.</LD>
<TE>   She said that from 4 a.m. to 4 p.m. New Year's Eve, pilots will be
prohibited from flying below 1,500 feet within a one-mile radius of
the Statue of Liberty in New York. During the same period, flights
below 2,000 feet are banned over Manhattan Island between 23rd and
96th streets -- a section slightly larger than Central Park -- at the
request of the New York Police Department, Brown said.</TE>

<HD>Weather Back East Is Frightening</HD>
<DH>A powerful storm clobbers the Atlantic Coast, dropping 2
feet of snow in some places and forcing airports and highways to
close.</DH>

<DL>ALBANY, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>More than 2 feet of snow fell Wednesday in parts of upstate New York
as a powerful northeaster moved up the Atlantic Coast, setting
Christmas snowfall records, closing airports and bringing an
unexpected holiday spectacle of lightning and thunder.</LD>
<LD>   Snow was falling as fast as 5 inches per hour in eastern New York,
said Evan Heller, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in
Albany. The Mohawk Valley was "still getting clobbered" after 30
inches of snow, and would easily get another foot, Heller said.</LD>
<LD>   The New York State Thruway closed off more than 100 miles
Wednesday evening because plows couldn't keep up. "The snow is coming
down so hard that we're struggling to clear it," said spokesman Terry
O'Brien. Also closed were parts of three interstates in Pennsylvania,
which got up to 20 inches in some areas.</LD>
<TE>   For Albany, it was the first snowy Dec. 25 since 1985, and more
than a half-foot above the 1978 record of 11.8 inches. Cleveland also
broke its 1944 Christmas record of 5.8 inches of snow, reporting more
than 10 inches.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's ready for it," said Jamie Georgelos, a manager at
Alpin Haus ski shop in Amsterdam, 30 miles northwest of Albany.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a lot of people have been missing the snow for the past
few years, and they're really glad it's finally here," Georgelos
said.</TE>
<TE>   The snowstorm, blowing out of the Plains, was blamed for at least
18 deaths since Monday, mostly related to traffic accidents. The
weather front moved east Tuesday night, from the Midwest into
Pennsylvania, New York and New England, then re-formed Wednesday off
the East Coast as a northeaster.</TE>
<TE>   Maine was expected to get up to 18 inches of snow in places and
wind gusts up to 45 mph, the weather service said.</TE>
<TE>   The storm was punctuated in Connecticut with lightning and
thunder. "Anytime you have anything as strong as this, a lot of
precipitation and wind, you're going to get these anomalies," Heller
said.</TE>
<TE>   All three of New York City's airports were affected, with John F.
Kennedy International and La Guardia airports closing Wednesday
evening and flights delayed at Newark Liberty International Airport
in New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   Flights were also canceled at airports in Albany, Boston and
Hartford, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore saw a morning mix of rain and sleet replaced later with
cotton-ball-sized flakes of swirling snow that turned to thick slush
as it hit the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Slush forced officials at Baltimore-Washington International
Airport to close the two major runways temporarily. Six inches fell
on parts of western Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   Virginia was spared the brunt, but strong winds blew between 40
and 50 mph in some areas. In Roanoke, Va., convenience store employee
Bessie Bates finally brought in a wrought iron sidewalk sign after
the wind knocked it down four times.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very, very windy, and I finally just got tired of putting it
back up," said Bates.</TE>
<TE>   About 39,000 people in Massachusetts and 18,000 in New York lost
power due to the storm.</TE>
<TE>   The storm brought snow Monday to Texas and Oklahoma, which got
more than a foot in some areas; Oklahoma City had its first white
Christmas in 27 years. It brought 15 inches of snow to parts of
Kansas by Tuesday morning and parts of southwest Missouri in the
Ozarks had 14 inches.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan caught the northwest fringe of the storm Wednesday,
reporting as much as 9 inches of snow in the southern part of the
state.</TE>

<HD>Study Questions Effectiveness of Celebrex, 2 Other
Arthritis Drugs</HD>
<DH>Anti-inflammatory medicines may not be as successful at
blocking bleeding ulcers as previously thought.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>The blockbuster arthritis drug Celebrex doesn't protect the stomach
from dangerous bleeding ulcers as well as thought, a study published
today suggests.</LD>
<LD>   Celebrex and two similar new anti-inflammatory drugs are heavily
advertised as being safer for arthritis patients based on earlier
research that found they caused fewer ulcers and other
gastrointestinal complications than older anti-inflammatory
medicines. Together, the three new drugs have annual sales exceeding
$6 billion.</LD>
<LD>   But their safety has been called into question recently. The new
study, which focused on arthritis patients at high risk of recurrent
ulcers, escalates the controversy involving Celebrex, showing nearly
10% each year would develop another bleeding ulcer.</LD>
<TE>   The study, reported in today's issue of the New England Journal of
Medicine, included 287 patients who had a previous bleeding ulcer and
so were at very high risk of developing another, potentially
life-threatening ulcer.</TE>
<TE>   The study found the same thing for an older anti-inflammatory drug
combined with ulcer medicine Prilosec, which doctors often give
arthritis patients to protect their stomachs. In addition, neither
treatment protected as many patients from dangerous kidney
complications as past studies showed, the researchers said.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers said the results, while showing the treatments
work the same, indicate more study is needed on preventing bleeding
stomach ulcers in vulnerable older people who for years ease joint
pain with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs.</TE>
<TE>   "I think patients and doctors need to be aware ... there is a risk
of gastrointestinal bleeding and there is a risk of renal toxicity,"
so high-risk patients should be monitored closely by their doctor,
said Dr. John H. Klippel, medical director of the Arthritis
Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Pharmacia Corp., which makes Celebrex, said the
company interprets the findings as showing Celebrex as reducing the
risk of gastrointestinal complications in high-risk patients. "It is
our feeling that these findings should guide future research in the
area," spokesman Paul Fitzhenry said.</TE>
<TE>   Half took the anti-inflammatory diclofenac together with Prilosec;
half received Celebrex. It is one of three brand-name NSAIDs in a
newer class called cox-2 inhibitors because they block the cox-2
enzyme. It produces chemicals called prostaglandins that cause pain
and inflammation in the stomach as part of the body's repair process.</TE>
<TE>   These drugs, which also include Vioxx and Bextra, do not block
action of the cox-1 enzyme, which protects the stomach lining . Older
NSAIDs such as diclofenac block both cox enzymes, and so can cause
stomach irritation and exacerbate ulcers.</TE>
<TE>   Complications from taking older anti-inflammatory drugs
hospitalize about 107,000 Americans, and ulcer complications kill an
estimated 16,500 each year.</TE>

progress toward peace. However, five deaths in 24 hours suggest
otherwise.</DH>

<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Twenty-eight guerrillas in Chechnya laid down their arms Wednesday in
a move hailed by authorities as a sign that the situation in the
war-stricken republic is improving. But the slaying of a pro-Russian
party leader and the deaths of at least four Russians in 24 hours
indicated that it has not.</LD>
<LD>   In the capital, Grozny, unidentified gunmen shot and killed the
head of a pro-Kremlin party, and two Russian policemen died in a
clash with rebels in a nearby village, a Chechen government official
said. Two more Russians died in other parts of the republic during a
24-hour period, spokesmen said.</LD>
<LD>   Russian officials have been eager to show that rebel activity in
Chechnya is on the decline. Officials said the surrender in Grozny
involved members of rebel groups tied to Aslan Maskhadov, Chechnya's
last elected president, who was ousted when the Russian army
reinvaded in late 1999 to reassert Moscow's control over the
breakaway republic in the northern Caucasus.</LD>
<TE>   According to the Itar-Tass news agency, the new Moscow-appointed
prime minister, Mikhail Babich, attended the surrender of the
fighters outside the headquarters of the FSB security agency in
Grozny.</TE>
<TE>   The fighters, who appeared to include only lower-ranked rebels,
turned over machine guns, assault rifles, three guided antitank
missiles, grenade launchers and hundreds of rounds of ammunition, the
news agency said. Authorities said the men would be allowed to go
free because they were not accused of any crime.</TE>
<TE>   Despite continued casualties among Russian forces and their local
allies in Chechnya over the last three years, a senior official
aligned with Moscow, Rudnik Dudayev of the republic's security
council, declared that a turning point is in view.</TE>
<TE>   "A considerable part of Chechen militants will lay down their arms
and return to peaceful life by the spring," he predicted.</TE>
<TE>   He said the surrender of the 28 fighters in Grozny meant that
"both ordinary people and militants are tired of the war."</TE>
<TE>   Since Russian forces returned to Chechnya in 1999, saying they
wanted to stamp out terrorists and separatists, more than 4,700
Russian soldiers and police have been killed, according to official
statistics.</TE>
<TE>   The political leader reported slain was Sayed-Amin Adizov, a
construction company chief who headed the Grozny chapter of the
Kremlin-sponsored Unified Russia party. He was killed as he rode in
his truck Tuesday night, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, human rights groups have complained that Russia
wants to force displaced Chechens, most of whom remain in camps in
the neighboring republic of Ingushetia, to go home.</TE>
<TE>   But the displaced Chechens are resisting. They fear the ongoing
war in Chechnya and the frequent reprisals and sweeps by Russian
troops that have led to the "disappearances" of many young men inside
the republic.</TE>
<TE>   Russian President Vladimir V. Putin has called for a referendum on
a new constitution for the republic in order to formally end the
state of war and bring Chechnya back to a normal status within the
Russian Federation.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said Wednesday that 1,000 signatures had been collected
in the previous few days on petitions supporting such a referendum.
About 12,000 signatures are needed.</TE>
<TE>   Moscow claims that there are only about 1,000 rebel fighters in
Chechnya, a figure that has not changed in spite of reports week
after week of rebels being captured or killed. However large the
rebel force is, it has managed to tie up between 80,000 and 100,000
Russian army troops and police.</TE>

<HD>Bug Bite Explains Castro's Absence</HD>
<DH>In a letter, the leader tells fellow Cubans that a leg
infection caused him to be bedridden.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HAVANA</DL>
<LD>Out of the public eye for more than a week, President Fidel Castro
told Cubans in a letter published Wednesday that he is recovering
from a serious infection caused by a bug bite to his left leg.</LD>
<LD>   "I am fine, dear compatriots, and I feel more optimistic than ever
about the future of the Revolution," the 76-year-old leader wrote in
the letter published on the front page of the Communist Party daily
Granma.</LD>
<LD>   The letter was the first public word about Castro's current
illness since Saturday, when he excused himself from a session of the
National Assembly, Cuba's parliament, saying doctors had ordered him
to rest after an unspecified injury to his leg.</LD>
<TE>   The health of Castro, who is regularly seen in public several
times a week, is a constant source of speculation among Cuba
watchers. Rumors of ailments have been circulating for years.</TE>
<TE>   Castro, who has ruled Cuba for nearly 44 years, said in the letter
that the infection began after he started scratching a bug bite on
the lower part of his left leg the night of Dec. 16.</TE>
<TE>   Castro said he followed doctors' instructions to keep the leg
elevated and apply cold compresses when resting and continued with
his regular work schedule. But by the morning of Dec. 19, the bite
was bothering him more.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors informed him that he had a staphylococcus infection and
ordered more cold compresses, antibiotics and -- to his dismay -- bed
rest.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't have any other alternative but to resign myself," Castro
wrote. He begrudgingly then canceled a Friday night appearance at the
anniversary celebration of the Federation of University Students and
a Saturday morning session of the National Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   "It was my duty to protect my beloved left leg," he wrote. "With
it, I have practiced many sports, including soccer, have run in
races, jumped, swum, climbed mountains....</TE>
<TE>   "It had never betrayed me," the Cuban leader wrote of his left
leg. "I couldn't betray it now."</TE>

<HD>Bodies of 7 Soldiers Arrive in Germany</HD>
<DH>The peacekeepers were killed in a helicopter crash in
Afghanistan. International security forces show solidarity at Kabul
memorial service.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>COLOGNE, Germany</DL>
<LD>The bodies of seven German peacekeepers killed in a helicopter crash
in Afghanistan arrived home Wednesday, met by grieving relatives and
Defense Minister Peter Struck.</LD>
<LD>   An honor guard carrying flaming torches stood at attention in the
twilight and drums rolled softly as the flag-draped coffins were
carried off the transport plane at Cologne-Bonn airport.</LD>
<LD>   "All of Germany grieves with you," Struck told the victims'
relatives.</LD>
<TE>   The seven were killed Saturday when their Sikorsky CH-53
helicopter crashed as it returned from a routine patrol over Kabul,
the Afghan capital. They were among 4,700 peacekeepers stationed in
the city for the last year, trying to stabilize a country ravaged by
23 years of invasion, civil war and repressive regimes.</TE>
<TE>   Before the coffins were loaded onto the plane at Kabul airport, a
large portrait was placed in front of each victim's casket.</TE>
<TE>   Buglers played taps, and more than 100 Afghan and international
peacekeepers stood at attention as a mark of respect for their fallen
comrades in the International Security Assistance Force.</TE>
<TE>   The head of the peacekeepers, Turkish Maj. Gen. Akin Zorlu,
expressed condolences to the German contingent during the
chilly-morning memorial service.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope that they, and we in ISAF, can take comfort from the fact
that our colleagues were doing their duty not only toward their
country but toward the magnificent contribution Germany has made, and
continues to make, supporting the peace process here in Afghanistan,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   German Gen. Werner Freers welcomed the show of solidarity.</TE>
<TE>   "Your warm words of sympathy remind us of the fact that the ISAF
is a family that not only shares a common profession but shares the
very sad moments of life together as friends and fellow soldiers," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Military officials say the crash probably resulted from a
mechanical failure.</TE>

<HD>New Delhi Celebrates Subway Opening</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW DELHI</DL>
<LD>Nearly 1 million curious and excited people packed stations to get a
peek and take a ride as this Indian capital's swank new subway and
metro rail system opened Wednesday for regular service.</LD>
<LD>   Tens of thousands of people stood in queues to board the system,
which officials hope will relieve chronic congestion in New Delhi, a
city of 12 million people and 4 million vehicles.</LD>
<LD>   Officials used radio spots to warn the crowd against unruly
behavior. Still, passengers tampered with the automated doors of the
train cars, forcing authorities to ground one of the four trains
scheduled to operate throughout the day.</LD>
<TE>   Some of the automated ticket machines and entry gates didn't work,
making commuters restless. The trains did not often arrive at the
promised 15-minute intervals, and officials blamed the delays on
passenger interference.</TE>
<TE>   The metro could represent a true lifestyle leap for the gritty,
traffic-clogged city. Tickets cost up to 16 cents, affordable for
ordinary Indians. The five miles that opened Wednesday cover one of
New Delhi's most congested areas, housing a largely poor,
working-class population.</TE>
<TE>   The metro currently has six trains with South Korean-made cars and
will have 60 by 2005. By then, the system will consist of 37 miles of
rail running above and below ground, with up to 2 million riders
expected to use the system daily.</TE>

<HD>Russia Defends Helping Iran Build Nuclear Reactor</HD>
<DH>Moscow says the plant under construction meets all
international safeguards.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>TEHRAN</DL>
<LD>Russia brushed aside strong U.S. criticism Wednesday and said it had
agreed with Tehran to speed up construction of an $800-million
nuclear reactor in Iran and to consider building another.</LD>
<LD>   The United States, which has branded Iran part of an "axis of
evil" for allegedly developing weapons of mass destruction, fiercely
opposes the Islamic Republic's nuclear program.</LD>
<LD>   Russian Atomic Energy Minister Alexander Rumyantsev said
Washington had failed to show that Iran had broken any international
regulations over the nuclear program.</LD>
<TE>   "We always tell our American colleagues that all Iran-Russia
cooperation is in accordance with international regulations and the
resolutions of the International Atomic Energy Agency," Rumyantsev
said.</TE>
<TE>   Moscow's continued participation in the project to build a nuclear
reactor near the western port of Bushehr had depended, he said, on
Iranian assurances that all spent fuel would be returned to Russia --
a demand advanced by U.S. experts.</TE>
<TE>   Iran insists that the Bushehr reactor is for purely civilian power
production, but U.S. officials question why Iran, the second-biggest
oil producer in OPEC and with the second-biggest gas reserves in the
world, would need it.</TE>
<TE>   Russia says it would be difficult for the civilian reactor to be
adapted to produce nuclear weapons, a stance the U.S. government
disputes.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials earlier this month also charged that two other
nuclear sites being built in central Iran were of a type that could
be used for manufacturing nuclear warheads.</TE>
<TE>   The Bushehr reactor, due to begin working at the end of 2003, is
under the supervision of the atomic energy agency, or IAEA, while the
other two plants are not due to be inspected by the agency until late
February.</TE>

<HD>To Jordanians, an Iraq War Would Be Strike on Region</HD>
<DH>In a land where Saddam Hussein's subjects are viewed as
Arab brethren, many see instability as inevitable in case of U.S.
assault.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alissa J. Rubin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>AMMAN, Jordan</DL>
<LD>The United States says war with Iraq can be avoided. But few people
in this desert kingdom believe it.</LD>
<LD>   To Jordanians, the question is when the war will start, not if.
Preparations, both practical and psychological, are underway here.
The mood is an uneasy mixture of discomfort at the government's
support for the U.S., frustration at the suppression of dissent, and
anger at America for preparing to attack Arab brethren, although
there is little support here for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   "You might find a lot of people here who don't like Saddam, but
that's not the point," said Dr. Tareq Tahboub, a prominent Jordanian
anesthesiologist who is active in an Islamist-leaning professional
association. "Everyone here will identify with Iraqi children. The
Iraqis have suffered for 12 years [under international sanctions],
and we don't know what they have done."</LD>
<TE>   On a more personal level, many Jordanians do business in Iraq,
have friends in Jordan's Iraqi refugee community and view the Iraqis
as distant cousins.</TE>
<TE>   "This aggression will be against the whole region. Iraq, Syria,
Jordan -- all of us are from one family," said Abdul Latif Arabiyat,
a former speaker of the lower house of parliament and a top official
in the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamic fundamentalist organization.
"We are warning the government no one can predict what kind of
reaction there will be if there is an attack.... The Americans are
foolish if they think they can destroy the whole area. Everyone in
the region will feel this [military] action is against them."</TE>
<TE>   Western diplomats monitoring the situation in Jordan agree that if
there is an attack on Iraq, political and economic stability here
will be touch and go.</TE>
<TE>   "It cannot be protracted," said a senior Western diplomat. Asked
whether fighting that lasted four to six weeks would be
destabilizing, he responded, "Anything beyond a week is protracted."</TE>
<TE>   Small-business owners fear that war might worsen the already poor
economic situation.</TE>
<TE>   The majestic Roman ruins at Jerash, a popular tourist site, were
deserted one sunny afternoon recently at what is usually high season
for Arab tourists. The crafts bazaar at the entrance, once crowded
with visiting Arabs and Europeans eager to buy textiles and necklaces
made by Bedouins, was empty. Shopkeepers drifted between stalls to
drink Turkish coffee and wonder aloud how much longer they could hang
on.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody wants a war. We are thinking about this 48 hours a day,"
said Khaled Marashdih, 38, who was preparing to give up one of his
three stalls that sell jewelry and antique teapots. Half the stalls
in his corner of the bazaar have closed. If war starts, all the
remaining shops will shut their doors, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The prospect of war started to affect government policy during the
summer, resulting in tighter security and a further postponement of
elections for a new parliament to replace the one suspended last
year. Restrictions on dissent are multiplying.</TE>
<TE>   Some Jordanians say privately that they fear the country could
move toward more authoritarian rule, along the lines of that in other
Arab states. In recent years, Jordan -- ruled by King Abdullah II, a
member of the Hashemite family, which is believed to be descended
directly from the prophet Muhammad -- has adopted some Western
democratic policies. But now, from the government's standpoint, there
are dangers that warrant a tighter rein.</TE>
<TE>   In the event of a U.S.-led war against Iraq, there are fears here
that Israel would use the upheaval to push Palestinians out of the
West Bank and into Jordan, in the process making more room for
Israeli settlers.</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah and his top aides have warned the West that an attack on
Iraq -- especially one that went on for more than three or four weeks
-- could prompt unrest in Jordan, especially in areas where
conservative Islamists hold sway.</TE>
<TE>   The assassination in October of a U.S. diplomat outside his home
in Amman, the capital, heightened fears of terrorist attacks. This
month, authorities announced the arrest of two suspected Al Qaeda
members in the killing of the American, Laurence Foley, and said the
men had planned a series of attacks against embassies, airlines and
other targets in Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   "We are surrounded by so many political storms, and we don't want
those storms to affect our security," said Information Minister
Mohammed Adwan. "We are being more vigilant, more watchful. We are
using stricter measures."</TE>
<TE>   Among the government's recent moves was a ban on political
activity by committees that run professional trade unions. The
committees have taken strong anti-Israel stances, opposing Jordan's
1994 peace accord with the Jewish state and, more recently,
circulating a blacklist of citizens who had visited or done business
with Israel -- a move that many moderate Jordanians thought was
inappropriate and excessive.</TE>
<TE>   However, in the absence of a parliament and any effective
opposition, the government's recent clampdown has been seen as moving
the country further from democracy.</TE>
<TE>   "The government has become very sensitive about any entity
practicing politics," said Osama Sharif, editor of the Star, an
English-language weekly. "They want to regulate the trade in
politics, but the more you regulate it, the more people go
underground.... If people cannot speak their mind, eventually it
creates sedition."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the government carried out a crackdown in the southern
city of Maan, long known as a center of Islamists and government
opponents. Officials said they were rooting out gangs involved in
drug smuggling and gunrunning. Most people believe, however, that
they were trying to reduce the risk of violent reaction to the
government's close relationship with the United States. At least six
people were killed in clashes, including two police officers.</TE>
<TE>   "The government is relying too much on security measures to
suppress protest," said Rami Khouri, an analyst in Amman for the
International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based organization that
studies conflict areas. "Most Jordanians are violently opposed to
unilateral American action [in Iraq] ... so there is a lot of
frustration" because there are few outlets for them to legally
express their views.</TE>
<TE>   Several senior Western diplomats in Jordan concurred.</TE>
<TE>   "We certainly urged them to hold the elections when they were
scheduled last summer," one diplomat said.</TE>
<TE>   Jordanian journalists say they have been warned not to print
articles on certain sensitive subjects such as the recent action in
Maan -- except from the government's point of view.</TE>
<TE>   Free speech does seem to be in short supply. A U.S. reporter
trying to interview shopkeepers in Amman was stopped by police
officer Ibrahim Shamaileh, who summoned one supervisor, then another.
The Jordanians being interviewed fell silent and, after five minutes,
asked the reporter to erase their names.</TE>
<TE>   A man who attempted to speak to the American in English was
admonished in Arabic by the officer: "Just tell her that they are our
friends and we like them and they are welcome in Jordan. If you say
anything else, she may get the wrong impression."</TE>

<HD>Kenyans Pin Hopes on Change at Top</HD>
<DH>On the eve of Friday's presidential election, the
challenger to the ruling party is heavily favored. People are fed up
with hard times.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Davan Maharaj and Patrick Mwangi</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>GATUYA, Kenya</DL>
<LD>Justus Maina, a 61-year-old tea farmer who lives in this village near
snowcapped Mt. Kenya, has few reasons to be happy. The village lacks
running water, its narrow roads are unpaved, and he receives pennies
for the crop he sells to a local cooperative.</LD>
<LD>   But these days, Maina and his neighbors are giddy with hope. They
are counting on a former villager, opposition leader Mwai Kibaki, to
deliver them from decades of misrule by winning Friday's presidential
election. Analysts and polls suggest that barring electoral fraud --
which is common in this East African nation -- Kibaki could storm to
victory over Uhuru Kenyatta, the 42-year-old handpicked successor of
President Daniel Arap Moi.</LD>
<LD>   Moi is legally barred from seeking reelection. He has ruled Kenya
since 1978, when independence hero Jomo Kenyatta, Uhuru's father and
the nation's first president, died. Many Kenyans are counting on
Kibaki, who served as Moi's vice president for a decade until 1988,
to lead Kenya out of its worst economic decline since independence,
rescue it from rampant corruption and restore the aspirations of a
nation once described as one of Africa's brightest hopes.</LD>
<TE>   As a lecturer at Makerere University in Uganda, Kibaki, 71, earned
a reputation as one of East Africa's brightest economists. As a
businessman and government minister, he struck deals with other
ruling party officials that helped him secure large stakes in banks,
stores and office buildings. Kibaki is now one of Kenya's wealthiest
politicians.</TE>
<TE>   "This is Kenya's 'old money' election," said John Githongo, who
heads the local chapter of Transparency International, an
anti-corruption watchdog group. "Kibaki's money is clashing against
Kenyatta's and Moi's money."</TE>
<TE>   Kibaki was not always a member of the moneyed set. He was born in
a tiny mud-walled hut in this mountainous village in central Kenya
that backs up to Aberdare National Park, where tourists now flock to
see antelope, elephants and black leopards. Kibaki helped his father,
a small tobacco farmer, herd and milk the family's cows. But he was
mainly interested in his studies, and he became a darling of the
teachers at the local school.</TE>
<TE>   Former classmates say Kibaki was particularly adept at
mathematics. Businessmen sought him out to make calculations, said
Elizabeth Wangui, a longtime Gatuya resident. One of Kibaki's
teachers, a Roman Catholic nun, predicted that he would one day
become a great leader, according to Nderitu Gatu, a former classmate.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a prophecy that is going to come true," Gatu said. "He had
a great ability to organize other students and was trusted by
teachers to even solve disputes among them."</TE>
<TE>   In the 1950s, Kibaki earned degrees in economics and political
science at the London School of Economics and went on to become a
lecturer at the Ugandan university.</TE>
<TE>   He returned home in the early 1960s to join the independence
movement, held a variety of ministerial portfolios and was elevated
by Moi to the vice president's job. Over the years, Kibaki became
known as a bright but unenergetic leader who took few risks. He
remained Moi's sidekick even though the Kenyan strongman marginalized
the Kikuyus, the country's largest ethnic group, to which Kibaki
belongs.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, when activists demanded that Moi end one-party rule,
Kibaki mocked them, saying they were daydreamers trying to cut down a
fig tree with a razor blade. But Kibaki formed the Democratic Party
in 1991, joining supporters who had long abandoned Moi's Kenya
African National Union. He lost elections to Moi in 1992 and 1997.</TE>
<TE>   In the first decade after independence in 1963, Kenyans were about
as prosperous as people of Asian countries such as South Korea and
Singapore. But today, the average Kenyan earns about $300 a year --
the same as in 1963. More than half the people live in dire poverty.
About 40% are unemployed.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say that Moi's relatives, government ministers and other
cronies have systematically looted the country's treasury.
International lending agencies are currently withholding hundreds of
millions of dollars until the government makes meaningful efforts to
stem corruption.</TE>
<TE>   Little has changed for Maina and other villagers here since
independence. They still toil on tiny plots of land. Maina says the
small amount he receives for his tea is not enough to buy food or to
send his children to school.</TE>
<TE>   Down the street, Bernard Nderitu runs a sparsely stocked dry goods
shop and says he makes just enough money to feed his wife and five
children. Pointing at the empty shelves, he said: "Times are very
bad, very bad. A few years ago, business was thriving, and everyone
was happy. Now, we have been reduced to this."</TE>
<TE>   Kibaki has promised that his National Rainbow Coalition -- an
alliance of opposition parties that was hastily cobbled together --
will transform Kenya into a land of plenty that is free of
corruption. He has promised free primary school education and has
vowed to create hundreds of thousands of jobs through initiatives
that include revitalizing the agricultural sector.</TE>
<TE>   But Githongo, the anti-corruption crusader, who is also a local
commentator, said Kenyans should not expect too much of Kibaki.</TE>
<TE>   "If he wins, Kibaki will be a caretaker, overseeing a transitional
stage in Kenyan politics," Githongo said. "There will probably be
less corruption and better management, but right now he is being
swept up in this momentum of change."</TE>

<HD>Trevi's Lawyers Want Removal of Judge in Trial</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHIHUAHUA, Mexico</DL>
<LD>Lawyers for pop singer Gloria Trevi contended Wednesday that the
judge overseeing her case is biased against her and should be removed
from the trial.</LD>
<LD>   Trevi's 10 lawyers said they plan to present a petition seeking to
replace Judge Hector Talamantes to lawmakers in Chihuahua province,
where the trial is taking place.</LD>
<LD>   Talamantes has refused to speak to the media.</LD>
<TE>   Late Tuesday, Talamantes ruled that there was enough evidence to
try Trevi for rape, kidnapping and corruption of minors.</TE>
<TE>   He also refused Trevi's request for bail and ordered her held in a
maximum-security prison for the trial's duration.</TE>
<TE>   Trevi, nicknamed "Mexico's Madonna," allegedly recruited
adolescent girls for live-in musical training and then forced them to
have sex with her manager, Sergio Andrade.</TE>
<TE>   Trevi's lawyers had hoped that the judge would dismiss some of the
charges or release her from prison.</TE>

<HD>Material for Bombs Seized in Indonesia</HD>
<DH>Cache of ammonium nitrate was bound for a suspect in a
deadly blast, police say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>Indonesian police seized a huge cache of ammonium nitrate in Central
Sulawesi province Wednesday and said it was destined for a fugitive
wanted in the deadly bombing of a McDonald's restaurant.</LD>
<LD>   Ammonium nitrate is a common fertilizer, but it can be mixed with
fuel oil to make a powerful explosive. It was the substance used in
the Oct. 12 blasts in Bali that killed more than 190 people, mostly
Western tourists.</LD>
<LD>   "If this was used to make a bomb, it would be much larger than the
one in Bali," police Col. Tatang Somantri said.</LD>
<TE>   The 550 pounds of fertilizer were found in a car that police had
followed in Palu, the capital of Central Sulawesi province, Somantri
said.</TE>
<TE>   The driver confessed to smuggling the chemical from neighboring
Malaysia for a fugitive identified only as Ipong, a senior police
detective said on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Ipong, who was not in the car, is wanted in the Dec. 5 bombing of
a McDonald's restaurant in Makassar, in southern Sulawesi. Three
people were killed in the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the suspects detained for that bombing said they were
planning to attack churches on Christmas Eve.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said the alleged McDonald's bombers -- who are said
to be linked to the Jemaah Islamiah terrorist network suspected in
the Bali bombings -- planned to buy 50 detonators for the church
attacks. Police said they found TNT, sketches of a church and
bomb-making books in raids on suspects' homes.</TE>
<TE>   Somantri said the driver was arrested and officers were searching
for the owner of the chemical, who was with the driver but managed to
escape. Three different license plates were found inside the car.</TE>
<TE>   Several bombs have exploded over the last year in Palu, about 930
miles northeast of Jakarta, Indonesia's capital. Almost 1,000 people
have been killed on Sulawesi island in fighting between Muslims and
Christians since mid-2000, but large-scale clashes have decreased
over the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Ammonium nitrate is widely used by Indonesian farmers, and
fishermen also use the substance to make bombs to stun fish. Its sale
is restricted, and it is a crime to possess the chemical without a
license.</TE>
<TE>   Jemaah Islamiah, linked to the Al Qaeda terrorist network, is
believed to have about 4 tons of the substance.</TE>

<HD>Rhetoric Rules the Day in Venezuela</HD>
<DH>The rage and bombast on both sides hinder the chance to
overcome the political crisis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. Christian Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>When the crew of an oil tanker named for a former beauty queen
decided to strike, the ship's namesake came out of retirement to
become a political star.</LD>
<LD>   When a respected academic refers to President Hugo Chavez, the
historical figures invoked are Stalin and Hitler, each responsible
for far more deaths than the population of this entire city. Some
opponents use the more formal "Mr. Dictator Chavez."</LD>
<LD>   When taking the temperature of public discourse, the best
instrument turns out to be a sound meter to catch the volume of noise
from clanging pots and pans and the shrill cant from radio and
television.</LD>
<TE>   Venezuelan politics are loud, over the top, impolite and even
flaky, more akin to "The Jerry Springer Show" than a debate sponsored
by the League of Women Voters.</TE>
<TE>   Latin America experts say part of it is cultural: The region has
always been a place where politics are a smash-mouth game of insult
and counter-insult, where the loudest voice wins. Worse, the sheer
venom puts obstacles in the way of any potential reconciliation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a reflection of the depth of the rage in Venezuela at this
point," said Michael Shifter, a Latin America expert at the
Inter-American Dialogue, a centrist think tank in Washington.
"There's tremendous widespread anger.</TE>
<TE>   "The bitterness that's produced makes it virtually impossible to
have any common ground," he continued. "It's reached a point where
it's difficult to have a rational discourse. And that's a problem."</TE>
<TE>   With oil production paralyzed, Christmas ruined and no signs that
Chavez will be stepping down any time soon, Venezuela has descended
into hysteria and dysfunction.</TE>
<TE>   There is intrigue: New coup rumors fly every day across Blackberry
pagers in office tower boardrooms or mouth to mouth in the poor
neighborhoods that dot the mountains surrounding the capital.</TE>
<TE>   There are dysfunctional families: Chavez's wife, in the process of
divorcing him, recently took to the airwaves with their two young
children to ask the beleaguered president to "listen to the people."</TE>
<TE>   There is the aging beauty queen: Pilin Leon, the 1981 Miss World
for whom an oil tanker was named, became a fixture at protest sites
and a participant in Venezuela's political debate within days of the
ship's crew joining the strike. The crew has since been replaced and
its cargo delivered.</TE>
<TE>   Venezuelan women "have been brave, courageous and ceaseless,"
Leon, now a mother of three, told a cheering crowd in the Plaza
Altamira in an upscale neighborhood of the capital where three
protesters were recently shot to death.</TE>
<TE>   There is the constant threat of violence: Both sides brag about
the number of weapons they have amassed in anticipation of the great
conflagration to come.</TE>
<TE>   The entire country -- from homemakers to professors to the
president -- seems engaged in verbal chair-throwing where all sense
of proportion disappears.</TE>
<TE>   Consider these gems:</TE>
<TE>   Chavez's "tactics are totalitarian, similar to Stalin," said Trino
Marquez, a sociologist at a respected university, referring to the
Soviet leader believed to be responsible for the deaths of more than
10 million people. "Hitler did the same thing in the Third Reich."</TE>
<TE>   A caller to a television station said: "Chavez is doing to us the
same thing that Hitler did to the Jews, the same thing that happened
to the Americans with the Twin Towers."</TE>
<TE>   There is not even a pretense of etiquette. Carlos Ortega, union
boss and one of the strike leaders, appears on television every night
and refers to the president as "Mr. Dictator Chavez," refusing to use
the honorific "Mr. President."</TE>
<TE>   Then there is Chavez himself. Since a brief coup in April, the
president has toned down his rhetoric a little, which is a bit like
saying that Gene Simmons of the rock group Kiss now wears less
makeup, or that Ozzy Osbourne now has a more normal home life. In a
recent four-hour speech, Chavez referred to his opponents as
"terrorists" six times.</TE>
<TE>   "The same political parties and the same opposition leaders,
except for some, have not bothered to distance themselves from
coup-mongering," Chavez said. "They have launched themselves again,
rabidly, some of them insane to recapture power in Venezuela by a
route which is coup-plotting, destabilizing, fascist and terrorist."</TE>
<TE>   Chavez also has refused to use Ortega's title -- president of the
Confederated Workers of Venezuela -- leaving off the honorific in
letters addressed to the strike committee.</TE>
<TE>   "I have softened my rhetoric a lot," Chavez insisted when asked in
a recent interview with four American journalists about the
continuing deterioration of dialogue in the country. Later, though,
he seemed puzzled by the anger directed at him: "People hate me and
they don't even know why," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez is a natural target, even though his actions don't come
close to the level of people like Mussolini, Hitler, Slobodan
Milosevic or even his friend, Fidel Castro, to all of whom he is
frequently compared by opponents.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, his has been a permissive government. For about two
months, more than 120 military officers have declared themselves in
rebellion, leaving their posts and taking over Plaza Altamira to
declare it "liberated territory." Rather than using violence, the
Chavez government has left the officers undisturbed.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the press, apoplectic about what it sees as
intimidation by Chavez's supporters.</TE>
<TE>   It is true that Chavez supporters rampaged through television
stations this year, that they have harassed journalists and that one
photojournalist was killed while covering the April 11 coup.</TE>
<TE>   But claims that the press here is restricted ring hollow --
especially given the volume with which those claims are advanced and
the media's free and easy admission that they are part of the
opposition movement.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a craziness that has grown this year," said Janet Kelly,
a professor at the Institute of Superior Studies of Administration
graduate school in Caracas. "It's really unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   At least some people on both sides of the divide have tried to
tone down the invective.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign Minister Roy Chaderton took to the airwaves recently to
call for sanity. Behind him as he spoke sat two carved wooden angels,
a reminder of the holiday season that Venezuelans revere as a time of
peace and togetherness.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to lower the tone of debate," he pleaded. "We shouldn't
disrespect, assault or insult anyone."</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Venezuela's Roman Catholic cardinal, Ignacio
Velasco, called on the two sides to live together.</TE>
<TE>   And recently, there was a small ray of hope on a slab of highway
that runs through a mostly upscale neighborhood in southern Caracas
called Prados Del Este.</TE>
<TE>   There, Chavistas and opposition supporters gathered to scream at
one another, the two groups separated only by a low concrete barrier
running between lanes.</TE>
<TE>   Then, an opposition member pulled out a soccer ball and asked the
Chavez supporters whether they were interested in a friendly match.
Though hesitant, the Chavistas accepted.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, four lanes of concrete were turned into a soccer field.
Faced off five on five, they began playing.</TE>
<TE>   Five women formed an impromptu cheerleading squad. The crowd
hemmed in on all sides. The referee was Rafael Rosales, an opposition
member, who promised both sides that he would be impartial.</TE>
<TE>   About 20 minutes later, each side had scored one goal. And
Venezuela's long and grinding conflict suddenly had a symbol of
togetherness.</TE>
<TE>   The publicity from that game has generated many similar games.
Chavez supporters and the opposition have played numerous impromptu
matches throughout the country, as both sides have embraced the
phenomenon. There was even talk of holding a final playoff match at
the presidential palace.</TE>
<TE>   "Venezuela won this one," Rosales said.</TE>

<HD>North Korea Begins Moving Fuel Rods Into a Reactor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>North Korea has begun moving fresh fuel rods into a reactor, a key
step in reactivating nuclear facilities that could eventually produce
weapons, a South Korean news agency said today.</LD>
<LD>   North Korea denied that its move was a prelude to developing
weapons, saying it needed to reactivate the facility to generate
electricity. The mothballed plant is at the center of a diplomatic
standoff with the United States.</LD>
<LD>   The Yonhap news agency, quoting an unidentified South Korean
government official, said the North began moving fuel rods into the
5-megawatt reactor at its main nuclear center north of its capital,
Pyongyang.</LD>
<TE>   The report followed an announcement Wednesday by officials in
South Korea that the North has allowed the International Atomic
Energy Agency to send more inspectors to its nuclear facilities, even
as the Pyongyang regime's engineers move freely around a reactor in
violation of arms control agreements.</TE>
<TE>   The agency has three inspectors staying in North Korea to monitor
the regime's nuclear activities. The number of inspectors was
increased from two to three this week.</TE>
<TE>   South Korean President Kim Dae Jung said today that his government
will never tolerate the North's efforts to develop nuclear weapons
but stressed that the issue should be resolved peacefully through
dialogue.</TE>

<HD>S. Koreans Shrug Off Nuclear Threat</HD>
<DH>Many believe the U.S. poses a bigger danger than the
communist North. The young tend to view the crisis as a White House
creation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Barbara Demick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>When Lee Jin Ju pauses to think about the nuclear crisis brewing over
the Korean peninsula, she knows exactly whom she fears.</LD>
<LD>   "George Bush," replies the 22-year-old accounting student without
missing a beat. "He's a war maniac."</LD>
<LD>   Lee doesn't like North Korea's Kim Jong Il much, either. "But
we're not afraid of him. He's a Korean like us. Even if he does get
the bomb, he's not going to use it against us."</LD>
<TE>   This is a sentiment echoed by many Koreans -- even some
conservatives -- and it is complicating U.S. efforts to forge a
consensus on North Korea among its allies. There is a tendency,
particularly among the young, to shrug off the current situation as
the creation of a hysterical White House. Many South Koreans see
their estranged brethren to the north more as objects of pity than of
fear, and the Americans less as saviors who defended them against
communism than as potential troublemakers.</TE>
<TE>   The news that North Korea was removing surveillance cameras from
its nuclear facilities got smaller headlines in Monday's newspapers
in South Korea than in the United States. Several major papers here
played the story below the news of a political party reshuffle. The
stock market actually went up in mid-October when it was revealed
that North Korea was violating its international agreements on its
nuclear program. Only in the last two days have the markets here
shown any jitters, and those were mostly attributed to Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   In one more step, the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported
today that the North Koreans were moving fresh fuel rods into a
small, 5-megawatt reactor at its Yongbyon nuclear facility, which had
been closed under a 1994 agreement with the United States. The agency
also said workers were moving freely in and out of the facility,
apparently in preparation to restart it.</TE>
<TE>   Despite North Korea's actions since October to restart its nuclear
program, there is no sense of impending crisis in Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   The streets of the South Korean capital throb with neon
advertising, the jangle of ringing cell phones, Christmas carols and
throngs of people bent on spending money. Stop almost anyone to ask
about the North Korean nuclear program, and the response will be a
quizzical stare.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't seriously fear there will be a war, and if there will
be, the Americans will start it," said Hyun Ho Sang, a 19-year-old
college freshman.</TE>
<TE>   Han Sung Joo, a former South Korean foreign minister, says the
South Korean government has deliberately kept people ignorant about
the danger posed by the North Koreans.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a government that is interested in playing down the
threat," Han said. "There is not much interest in explaining how
serious it is that North Korea is developing nuclear weapons, and as
a result there is a certain insensitivity among the public."</TE>
<TE>   Kim Kyong Won, a former ambassador to the United States and a
leading intellectual in the South Korean establishment, says South
Koreans do not believe that the North's development of nuclear
weapons has anything to do with them.</TE>
<TE>   "The Koreans think there is no need to worry about North Korea
developing nuclear weapons," Kim said. "They figure that Kim Jong Il
loves life too much to start a war that he will surely lose.... But
Bush, on the other hand, is an ascetic and a warrior."</TE>
<TE>   The reaction may be baffling to outsiders with an image of Korea
frozen from the 1950-53 war, when more than 1 million people were
killed. The perception is that U.S. intervention paved the way for
South Korea's current prosperity, sparing its people from the hunger
and cold that now grip the North.</TE>
<TE>   But the official version of history is challenged by many South
Koreans, who increasingly question the U.S. role, past and present,
in keeping the peace.</TE>
<TE>   The victory in last week's presidential election of left-of-center
labor lawyer Roh Moo Hyun has emboldened those who favor more
independence from the United States in foreign policy and has given
rise to a mood of giddy nationalism.</TE>
<TE>   Many South Koreans say they do not believe President Bush's
repeated assertions that the United States does not intend to attack
North Korea. They were rattled by Defense Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld's comments this week suggesting that the United States could
wage simultaneous military campaigns against Iraq and North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all a little confusing. We don't know what to believe. Bush
does not make clear his intentions," said Ha Ji Yun, a 26-year-old
civil servant who works with South Korea's conservative opposition
party. "That's why we are more afraid of the Americans than the North
Koreans."</TE>
<TE>   Although attitudes toward the United States have hardened,
feelings about North Korea are ambivalent. South Koreans tend to view
North Koreans less as enemies than as bothersome relatives. And as
with family members, the South Koreans feel free to complain about
them but bristle when the criticism comes from outsiders -- hence the
anger expressed here when Bush characterized North Korea as part of
an "axis of evil."</TE>
<TE>   Outgoing President Kim Dae Jung's "sunshine policy" has brought a
stream of cultural, sporting and economic exchanges. For the first
time this year, the South Korean Defense Ministry decided not to
designate North Korea as its "main enemy" in an annual white paper on
security issues. It chose not to publish the report at all.</TE>
<TE>   The South Korean government last year gave the North $70.5 million
in humanitarian aid, while private parties donated an additional $65
million, according to the Unification Ministry.</TE>
<TE>   Some South Koreans say they are pleased that their fellow Koreans
are developing nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is good that North Korea has the bomb. One day we will
be united and that bomb will be ours. All these other countries have
it -- India, Pakistan -- so why not Korea?" said Won Hye Jun, a
22-year-old pianist.</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly, South Koreans say they are not as fearful of North
Korea as they are of Korea's traditional conquerors, China and Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the bomb, many South Koreans cite a novel called "The
Rose of Sharon Blooms Again." The book is still a huge seller nearly
a decade after its publication during a crisis resolved by the 1994
agreement, under which North Korea froze its nuclear program in
exchange for international assistance for its energy industry.</TE>
<TE>   The plot revolves around a South Korean scientist who secretly
helps the North Koreans develop a nuclear bomb that is used to fend
off Japanese aggression.</TE>
<TE>   Conventional weapons currently pose far more of an immediate
threat to South Korea than nuclear weapons. The fear here is that if
the United States were to use a surgical strike to try to disable
North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear facility, the North might retaliate by
shelling Seoul with conventional weapons. During the height of the
previous crisis, North Korea threatened to turn Seoul into a "sea of
fire."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Breen, the Seoul-based author of "The Koreans," says South
Koreans shrugged off the threat as more of the bluster for which the
North Koreans are famous.</TE>
<TE>   "But the Americans took it literally," Breen recalled. "People
were getting telephone calls from their relatives abroad and only
then did they start to worry.... It finally got to the point where
Koreans were a bit nervous, but even at that their fear was mostly
that the Americans would miscalculate."</TE>

<HD>To Parents, Christmas Miracle</HD>
<DH>Couple's son, suffering from a rare disorder, is recovering
after a stem-cell transplant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Charles Ornstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>DURHAM, N.C.</DL>
<LD>The greatest gift for John and Alicia Bennett this Christmas didn't
come in a box under the tree. Instead it was the sight of their
3-year-old son, bald from chemotherapy, jumping on a mini-trampoline,
happy just to be sprung from the hospital.</LD>
<LD>   Tommy Bennett left Duke University Medical Center this week,
exactly one month after receiving an experimental stem-cell
transplant intended to head off early death from a rare genetic
disease. He is recovering -- apparently quite successfully -- in his
parents' temporary apartment here.</LD>
<LD>   The family from rural Amador County, Calif., is grateful this
holiday season for what Tommy has been spared: many of the side
effects and complications of such transplants -- high fevers,
lethargy and even death.</LD>
<TE>   "Part of me is waiting for the other shoe to drop because it just
went so well," Alicia Bennett said while sitting in Duke's outpatient
clinic, where Tommy must return every day for the next few weeks.
"Nothing in our lives ever goes so well."</TE>
<TE>   From a genetic standpoint, the family has been cursed. All three
of the Bennetts' children suffer from Sanfilippo syndrome, a disease
affecting one in 70,000 children in which an enzyme is lacking to
break down sugar molecules. Over time, the molecules build up,
causing organ damage and usually death by the early teens.</TE>
<TE>   Stem cells, which are derived from the blood of a newborn baby's
umbilical cord and placenta, gave Tommy the enzyme his body lacked.</TE>
<TE>   Tommy's older siblings -- Ciara, 6, and Hunter, 4 -- were
considered too disabled to benefit from the transplant, which has
been performed on only six other children nationally. But doctors
thought that Tommy, because of his age, stood a good chance of
surviving the transplant and gaining some developmental skills that
have been delayed or derailed by the disease. Doctors will not know
for sure whether the transplant has worked until a year or more has
passed.</TE>
<TE>   During their hospital stay, Alicia Bennett remained almost
constantly by Tommy's side. She lived on Domino's pizza, baked
potatoes and other fast foods. When a bitter ice storm left much of
North Carolina without power earlier this month, she and Tommy had no
clean sheets, blankets or clothes.</TE>
<TE>   The doctors had told her, "If everything goes well, you'll be
lucky to get out in six weeks." The boy's release two weeks early
took his family by surprise. Alicia Bennett was delighted at his
progress, but had done almost nothing to prepare for Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   "Luckily, I bought a tree and put it on the table [at the
apartment] before we left," she said Monday. "Now it's like I have to
rush and go buy presents and get them wrapped. I didn't think it was
going to be smooth sailing."</TE>
<TE>   John Bennett, along with Ciara and Hunter, flew in from California
Friday, but the trio have had to keep their distance from Tommy -- on
doctors' orders -- because they all had the sniffles. Tommy's immune
system isn't strong enough to ward off even a slight infection.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too bad we got sick," John Bennett said. "But that's the way
it goes. I'm glad it hit me and not him."</TE>
<TE>   Alicia Bennett said the situation is all the worse because the
family had been separated for more than three weeks. Hunter and
Ciara, whose minds and bodies have been attacked by the disease,
can't talk.</TE>
<TE>   Alicia Bennett doesn't know if they understood her "I love you"
messages on the telephone. "I kept wondering, 'Does Ciara even notice
I'm not there?' " the mother said.</TE>
<TE>   The family is ever mindful of Tommy's good fortune, and sorry for
other families not as lucky. They found out Tuesday that another
child with Sanfilippo syndrome, Kyle Cottey, died the previous night
from complications related to his transplant.</TE>
<TE>   Alicia Bennett had grown close to Kyle's family during the last
two months, and had even bought Christmas presents for the little boy
and his older brother. "I'm trying not to think about it; otherwise
I'll cry," she told a hospital volunteer.</TE>
<TE>   Other Sanfilippo families spent Christmas in the hospital. Jillian
Fitzpatrick, who had her transplant a day before Tommy's, was allowed
to leave for a few hours, but she had to return. She is set to be
released later this week.</TE>
<TE>   "I know she's feeling better," Jillian's mother, Michelle, said of
her daughter. "She's not 100% by any means, but she's feeling better.
No regrets."</TE>
<TE>   The Bennetts must remain in North Carolina for several more months
so doctors can monitor Tommy's progress. They are struck, at times,
by how much has changed since Christmas 2001, when the parents knew
only about Ciara's case of Sanfilippo. Hunter and Tommy were tested
that Dec. 26, and the results came back in February.</TE>
<TE>   "A year ago, we were positive that Tommy didn't have it," John
Bennett said.</TE>
<TE>   Today, except for his bald head, pudgy cheeks and a tube in his
chest, Tommy shows few outward signs that his immune system has been
obliterated by chemotherapy, and that a new one is slowly taking
hold.</TE>
<TE>   "He's doing great," said Dr. Joanne Kurtzberg, director of the
pediatric stem-cell transplant program at Duke. "He's not had any
major problems at all."</TE>
<TE>   The Bennetts said they know that Tommy's progress is being watched
by friends, family and strangers from across the country, as the case
has received national publicity. People they don't know have sent the
children clothes, toys and books for the holiday. And their name is
on prayer lists at many churches.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody has just taken Tommy in as their own," his mother said.
"Knowing the rest of the country was out there praying for him
certainly helped."</TE>

<HD>Cathedral a Star for Pilgrims</HD>
<DH>Midnight Mass, other services draw crowds. Many praise the
new downtown church.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stuart Silverstein, Matea Gold and Jessica Garrison</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Christmas this year ushered in a sort of Yule miracle in downtown Los
Angeles: After midnight, on a hill overlooking City Hall, the street
was bustling.</LD>
<LD>   Devout Roman Catholics as well as the religiously unaffiliated,
Southern Californians and tourists from points far beyond, flocked to
the new Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels for midnight Mass.</LD>
<LD>   Many of the estimated 4,000 to 5,000 in attendance, as well as the
thousands at the other six Masses celebrated Tuesday and Wednesday,
wanted to be part of the historic first Christmas at the $189-million
cathedral.</LD>
<TE>   And some, who rarely venture downtown, said the church could
inspire them and others to return.</TE>
<TE>   Visiting the cathedral "is an urban adventure," said Brian Hardin,
33, an interior designer who moved to West Los Angeles from New York
several years ago. "It may help to solidify downtown as a
destination, which is apparently what it is doing tonight." Another
transplant to Los Angeles, Nathalie O'Gorman, 37, said, "It is a real
cathedral."</TE>
<TE>   O'Gorman, accompanied by her parents who were visiting from Paris,
said she grew up amid the great cathedrals of Europe, but added that
Los Angeles now has one as well. "L.A. needs something like this ...
a cathedral for the third millennium," she asserted.</TE>
<TE>   But not everyone was convinced that Our Lady, which opened in
September after five years of construction, will have a significant
impact.</TE>
<TE>   Ata Martinez, 35, a molecular biologist visiting from Queretaro,
Mexico, pointed to the families scattered across the cathedral's
spacious 2.5-acre plaza. "A sense of community is lost in L.A. That's
a problem," said Martinez, who was educated at UC Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Martinez suggested that maybe it is too much to
expect a cathedral to change a big city. The cathedral, he said,
"fits the L.A. concept: cool. We don't expect all the communities [of
the world] to behave in the same sense. L.A. is very independent ....
It has its own concept of community, its own sense of city."</TE>
<TE>   Hours before midnight, the streets downtown near the glowing
cathedral filled with hundreds of people streaming toward Mass. They
came by bus and by limo, in black leather pants, bright Christmas
scarves and Santa hats. By 11 p.m., the 600-car parking lot beneath
the cathedral was full and, churchgoers said, neighboring parking
lots were charging up to $30.</TE>
<TE>   "My friends, welcome to your new cathedral," said Cardinal Roger
M. Mahony, archbishop of Los Angeles, after the choir had sung. "We
gather with all of our joys as well as our sadness and
disappointments."</TE>
<TE>   On Christmas Day, the scene was similar, with the flocks of people
around the cathedral marking a sharp contrast to nearby sections of
downtown. A sprinkling of homeless men and women populated the
sidewalks outside the shuttered courthouses, government offices and
shops along Broadway. But on Temple Street, hundreds of people
streamed up the hill for noon Mass.</TE>
<TE>   Large Congregations</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to try the new church for Christmas," said Burbank
resident Al Ramirez, 70, as he and his wife, 60-year-old Fita, walked
up the stairs into the plaza. "It's very beautiful, and that draws us
here today."</TE>
<TE>   Archdiocese spokesman Tod Tamberg said the cathedral draws large
congregations every Sunday. Between 1,000 and 1,500 people usually
attend the 8 a.m. Mass, while the 10 a.m. and noon services are
usually filled to the 3,000-person capacity. To accommodate the
overflow crowd at midnight Mass, church officials allowed worshipers
to stand behind the seating areas.</TE>
<TE>   In his homily at Wednesday's 10 a.m. Mass, Mahony briefly cited a
long litany of worldwide and domestic problems, including the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict, fighting in Afghanistan, terrorism, the
possibility of war with Iraq and the nuclear threat from North Korea.
He also touched on the job-security anxieties caused by the
sputtering U.S. economy and California's ballooning budget deficit,
along with gang violence in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past year, even our own church has had its darkness, its
sinfulness and our own problems to deal with," Mahony added, alluding
to the sex abuse controversy, which has prompted the resignation or
retirement of more than 350 priests nationwide this year. In the
Archdiocese of Los Angeles, six current or former priests have been
arrested and charged with child molestation.</TE>
<TE>   Cathedral Praised</TE>
<TE>   Yet in his remarks about the new cathedral, which has been
criticized for its high cost -- an issue made particularly poignant
by the recent elimination of seven headquarters ministries and the
layoffs of at least 60 workers in archdiocese headquarters -- Mahony
focused on the praise the new mother church of his diocese has
received.</TE>
<TE>   He cited how "over the last several months, the number of people
who have come up and said that coming and praying in this beautiful
space, they have found a new presence of God. I've had letters from
people whose lives have been totally changed because of their
experience of God here."</TE>
<TE>   For their part, many worshippers at the cathedral Wednesday said
it was their first visit, one they decided would make Christmas more
holy.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the plaza, Rafael and Eulalia Gomez posed their young son
and daughter inside a large manger scene, snapping photos of the
wide-eyed children.</TE>
<TE>   "We usually go to our church in Pico-Union, but we came here today
to tell God that we are doing well," said Rafael Gomez, 24. "It feels
more special here. It feels like it was built for us, for the
people."</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, hundreds of people milled about the plaza, some meditating
by the gateway pool, others relaxing in the orange and yellow chairs
scattered outside the main sanctuary.</TE>
<TE>   Pico Rivera resident Araceli Toscano, 28, skipped Mass at her
usual church to bring her parents, who were visiting from Jalisco,
Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very big, very impressive," said her father, Victoriano De
Leon.</TE>
<TE>   "Elegant," added her mother, Carmen De Leon.</TE>
<TE>   Richard and Angie Lopez usually worship at the San Gabriel Mission
in Alhambra, but after attending the 10 a.m. Mass at the cathedral,
they said they would be back.</TE>
<TE>   "You get a feeling that's very welcome, very warm," said Angie
Lopez, 73. "It feels like a family. It cost a lot of money, but I
think it's more than worth it. It does so much for our emotions and
our faith. This was a beautiful way to start Christmas Day."</TE>
<TE>   Just before noon, the sound of tolling bells filled the plaza,
drowning out the rush of traffic on the nearby Hollywood Freeway. As
she headed inside, first-time visitor Candy Del Rio examined the
large bronze doors framing the entrance.</TE>
<TE>   "We came so my children could appreciate Christmas inside the
cathedral," said the 30-year-old Bell Gardens resident, who added
that she was a bit taken aback by the modern look of the building.
"I'm used to the cathedrals in Mexico."</TE>
<TE>   But later, after wandering through the structure, Del Rio said she
was overwhelmed. "It's so beautiful -- it looks like something out of
the Roman Empire," she whispered, as she and her three children
toured the marble-encased mausoleum in the basement.</TE>
<TE>   Harry Dorsey came just for the architecture. The Playa del Rey man
said he is not Catholic, but wanted to see the building when it was
full of worshipers.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to hear the acoustics and see how it fits with the
people," Dorsey said. Referring to the cathedral's modernist Spanish
architect, Jose Rafael Moneo, Dorsey added, "The guy's a genius. It's
a beautiful building, it really is."</TE>
<TE>   Inside, people packed the seats as the service began. The organ
swelled with the melody of "O Come All Ye Faithful" as four altar
boys carrying processional candles moved slowly down the aisle,
followed by several priests and Mahony, dressed in red vestments. As
the Mass began, a priest sent clouds of incense into the air,
illuminated by the light glowing through the alabaster windows.</TE>
<TE>   In the back of the sanctuary, 74-year-old Guadalupe Alarcon knelt
before a 17th century altar piece featuring an image of Jesus on the
cross. Her eyes closed, the woman prayed silently, her lips moving as
she rocked back and forth.</TE>
<TE>   Alarcon said she began coming to the cathedral regularly when it
opened in the fall. The building is beautiful, she said. But it is
not aesthetics that draws her.</TE>
<TE>   "I come here," the Pico-Union resident said, "because this is
where God is."</TE>

<CX>   Cathedral -- A Dec. 26 article in the California section about
Christmas at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels incorrectly said
that Cardinal Roger M. Mahony wore red vestments. Although the
cardinal wore a red cassock at some Masses, his vestments were gold
and white at the Masses he celebrated. In addition, the story
incorrectly located the San Gabriel Mission. It is in Alhambra, not
San Gabriel.</CX>

<HD>World Has Edgy Little Christmas</HD>
<DH>Reminders of the growing strains between Muslim nations and
the West mark the holiday. Attackers kill three at a church in
Pakistan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Johanna Neuman and Beth Shuster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With grenades and gunfire, celebration and prayer, a world on the
edge of war observed an often-jittery Christmas on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   At the Vatican, Pope John Paul II called upon all people to
"accept the Christmas message of peace."</LD>
<LD>   Speaking in a tremulous voice from the steps of St. Peter's
Basilica, the 82-year-old pontiff urged believers of all faiths to
"extinguish the ominous smoldering of a conflict which, with the
joint efforts of all, can be avoided."</LD>
<TE>   But there was little sign of conflict avoidance on the day when
Christians honor the birth of Jesus. Instead, the day was marked by
reminders of growing tensions between Muslim nations and the West --
strains that made Christmas a holiday of anxiety for many.</TE>
<TE>   In Pakistan, police said two people dressed in concealing burkas
went to a small church in a provincial village and threw a grenade at
worshipers. Three women were killed and 11 other people were injured,
four critically, authorities said. The two attackers escaped.
Authorities said they were questioning a Muslim cleric who had made
hateful remarks against Christians.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said they believe Muslim militants were responsible
for the attack. Militant groups have stepped up attacks on Pakistan's
small Christian minority since the U.S.-led attack on Afghanistan
last year. Wednesday's killings were the fourth such incident in
Pakistan this year.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, a light snow dusted the historic monuments and gave
the Capitol the allure of a picture postcard. With the president at
Camp David for the holiday, the government was closed and the city
quiet.</TE>
<TE>   But in Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Turkey and elsewhere in their
region, U.S. troops gathered at bases that might soon be staging
areas for an attack on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Soldiers marked the holiday with trappings that have become
traditional -- roast turkey, baked ham and words from visiting
politicians and celebrities.</TE>
<TE>   In Afghanistan, David Letterman dined with troops at a base
outside Kandahar, a southern city that not long ago was a Taliban
stronghold.</TE>
<TE>   Troops at Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia, where roughly
4,000 U.S. personnel are based, heard from visiting Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman (D-Conn.). In a reference to Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, Lieberman praised the troops for helping to "keep Saddam in
the box."</TE>
<TE>   The day before, the Iraqi leader had released a Christmas Eve
message condemning the "powers of evil and darkness" threatening
"large-scale military aggression against our peace-loving people."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the pope, many Christian leaders have questioned
American policy toward Iraq. In Britain, Rowan Williams, the recently
installed archbishop of Canterbury, used his first Christmas address
to once again voice his opposition.</TE>
<TE>   The world has "grown old in intrigue and violence, cynicism,
despair and false hope," Williams said. "It is as if the wise, the
devious and the resourceful can't help but make the most immense
mistakes of all."</TE>
<TE>   United Nations weapons experts, meanwhile, visited seven potential
arms sites in Iraq on Wednesday, including explosives factories and a
paper plant."They are in Baghdad to work," Mark Gwozdecky, a
spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Agency, told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   In Bethlehem, which tradition calls Jesus' birthplace, driving
rain deepened the gloom caused by vacant hotels and empty streets
largely devoid of Christmas decorations.</TE>
<TE>   Two years of almost constant violence between Israelis and
Palestinians have all but erased the tourist traffic that once
enlivened Christmas in Bethlehem. Israeli troops recently reoccupied
the town seeking to block suicide bombers who have used it as a
staging area for attacks in nearby Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   At St. Catherine's Church, officials left an empty chair in the
front row for the midnight Mass, draping it with a kaffiyeh headdress
to remind worshipers of Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat, who was absent for the second year in a row.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli government has confined the Palestinian leader to his
compound in the West Bank city of Ramallah, saying he will not be
allowed to leave until he takes action to stop attacks on Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   At morning Mass in the Church of the Nativity, Latin Patriarch
Michel Sabbah, the senior Roman Catholic clergyman in the Holy Land,
told worshipers that "despite the difficult circumstances, we still
have to maintain hope with the love of God and say hopefully that
next year will be a better Christmas."</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in the West Bank, Israeli troops in the city of Nablus
shot and killed a suspected member of the militant group Hamas.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, men armed with crude bombs attacked a busy church in
India's West Bengal province. Six people were wounded. Police said
the motive for that attack appeared to be robbery; the attackers
broke into a church safe before fleeing.</TE>
<TE>   Across Asia, Christians worshiped surrounded by heightened
security.</TE>
<TE>   In Indonesia, police seized 550 pounds of ammonium nitrate
fertilizer, an amount authorities said was sufficient to make a large
bomb. The material, they said, was destined for a fugitive who is
part of a group that had talked of staging a bomb attack on Christmas
Eve.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in the island nation, a priest expressed the fears of
many: "It should be that Christmas does not make people scared like
it does these days," Father Yong Ohoitimur told congregants at a
church in Manado, a city with a large Christian population.</TE>

<HD>Police Win Praise in Riverside</HD>
<DH>Reforms instituted at the state's insistence after the 1998
shooting of 19-year-old Tyisha Miller are making a difference,
observers say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tina Daunt</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two years after California's attorney general ordered the Riverside
Police Department to fix a variety of serious problems, the agency is
earning high marks for improving training and supervision of officers
and developing a system for tracking problem cops.</LD>
<LD>   Although the reforms have yet to be fully tested, Atty. Gen. Bill
Lockyer said he is pleased with the progress and hopes Riverside's
efforts will serve as a model for other departments struggling to
eliminate civil rights abuses.</LD>
<LD>   "They are making a difference in reforming the department,"
Lockyer said. "You can see it in a lot of different ways."</LD>
<TE>   Lockyer issued the reform order after an investigation of the
police shooting of Tyisha Miller uncovered "defective and inadequate
policies, practices and procedures" in the Riverside Police
Department.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, 19, was killed in December 1998 when police fired a
barrage of bullets into the car in which she had been sleeping.
Officers had been dispatched to a service station where Miller had
locked herself in her disabled car and passed out with a gun in her
lap. When the officers broke a side window of the car, Miller
awakened with a start. Officers then opened fire because, they said,
they feared for their lives. Miller, who was shot 12 times, did not
fire her gun.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer's order was the first in which the state directed a law
enforcement agency to make changes as part of a consent decree. The
Los Angeles Police Department is under a far more restrictive order
with the U.S. Department of Justice, which demanded a wide range of
reforms after investigating the Rampart corruption scandal.</TE>
<TE>   According to Lockyer and other close observers, Riverside
officials have embraced the attorney general's demands, spending $7
million over the last 21 months on training, education and equipment
for their officers.</TE>
<TE>   "We see this as a very good thing," said Police Chief Russ Leach,
who took over as head of the department shortly after the Miller
shooting. "We've got the tools and the training in place. We've got
motivated officers and a commitment from the political establishment.
Now we need to put it all together to move the department forward."</TE>
<TE>   Leach recently appeared before the Riverside City Council and
assured the community that his department of 362 officers is far
different from what it was when Miller was killed four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   His words helped temper the anger felt by some community members
when they learned that the U.S. Justice Department had decided not to
prosecute the four officers involved in the shooting. Federal
officials concluded that any negligence, poor judgment or mistake by
the officers had not been enough to warrant criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   "The city is trying," said the Rev. Paul Munford of the New Joy
Baptist Church. "We have a new chief who is committed to complying
with the consent decree. Still, one of my concerns is that we are
doing fine now without any major confrontations or tragedies.
Hopefully, we won't have to be tested with another tragedy to see if
we really have reform."</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the shooting, Lockyer's office looked into the
officers' conduct but also declined to file criminal charges, citing
many of the reasons given by federal authorities. Nevertheless,
Lockyer ordered a deeper probe into department practices.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys in Lockyer's newly formed civil rights division spent
two years investigating the operations of the Riverside Police
Department. They found that inexperienced officers were working the
most dangerous shifts with little supervision; citizen complaints
were often ignored; annual performance reviews were rarely done; and
officers used their roll-call sessions to argue and tell offensive
jokes.</TE>
<TE>   "It became obvious that there was a lack of training and
professionalism in the department," the attorney general said.</TE>
<TE>   After finishing their inquiry, Lockyer's lawyers summoned Leach
and four members of his command staff to a meeting at the attorney
general's Los Angeles office, where they presented their findings at
length.</TE>
<TE>   Leach, who was new to the department, said the state attorneys
told him bluntly that the people of Riverside didn't trust their own
Police Department. "It was devastating," said Leach, who spent 20
years with the LAPD .</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer said he warned the department that it must enter into a
legally binding agreement to make reforms or face a lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   In the weeks that followed, a team of Riverside officials worked
out the terms of the consent decree with Lockyer's office. Unlike the
LAPD federal consent decree, which is more than an inch thick and
outlines new policies and practices in exhaustive detail, the state
document was only 17 pages long and gave the department some latitude
in how to implement the fixes over five years.</TE>
<TE>   Riverside was already voluntarily collecting data to determine
whether officers engaged in "racial profiling" during traffic stops.
The department in recent months has begun turning that information
over to the attorney general's office for review.</TE>
<TE>   As required by the decree, department officials moved more
seasoned officers to the night shift and implemented sensitivity
training designed to give officers "cross-cultural awareness." Also,
recruits are now hired and evaluated, in part, on the basis of their
"sensitivity to all segments of the community." Police supervisors
are required to take leadership training.</TE>
<TE>   The department has installed video cameras in roll-call rooms to
monitor officers' comments and conduct, and outfitted officers with
tape recorders to monitor their interactions with the public. In
coming months, the department will install video cameras in all squad
cars.</TE>
<TE>   To comply with an order to track problem officers, the department
has established a computer system that monitors complaints and alerts
the command staff when an officer has been engaged in two
questionable incidents.</TE>
<TE>   Police also have expanded their arsenal of nonlethal weapons to
include more Tasers, pepper spray and guns that fire sponges instead
of bullets.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Brann, who headed the Justice Department's community
policing efforts under President Clinton, was chosen to oversee the
Riverside department's compliance with the requirements. He makes
quarterly reports to Lockyer.</TE>
<TE>   "In a nutshell, they are doing extremely well," Brann said in an
interview last week. "In the overwhelming majority of cases, they are
definitely on track and progress is being made. In many instances
they are ahead of schedule."</TE>
<TE>   Brann and Lockyer say much of the success is the result of the
welcoming of change by Riverside Police Department brass, union
leaders and sworn officers.</TE>
<TE>   "We have accepted it," said Patrick McCartney, president of the
Riverside Police Officers Assn. "The mandates have a lot of benefits:
more supervision, more training, better equipment. It's going good."</TE>

<HD>Ellen J. Morphonios, 73; Idiosyncratic Judge</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The job as radio wedding expert was not the last one I would get
because of my blond hair and big boobs.</LD>
<LD>   -- Ellen Morphonios in her book "Maximum Morphonios: The Life and
Times of America's Toughest Judge"</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   She was blond and buxom. Once a legitimate beauty queen, she had
been Coconut Harvest Maiden and Mrs. South Florida.</TE>
<TE>   And for years she was "Lady Ellen," dispensing advice on
late-night talk radio.</TE>
<TE>   But she became best known as "the hanging judge" and "the time
machine" for the long sentences she dispensed -- 60 years for a
robber for whom state law recommended nine to 12, then 420 years for
another, 1,197 years for another and -- for one -- a whopping 1,678.
She sentenced at least 15 culprits to death.</TE>
<TE>   Ellen James Morphonios, the colorful Florida judge who signed her
decrees in lavender ink, kept a toy electric chair in her chambers
next to a diapered chimp named Toto and congratulated a rape victim
for shooting her attacker in the groin by saying "Nice shot," has
died. She was 73.</TE>
<TE>   Morphonios died Sunday in Miami, where she had served 21 years as
a judge. The cause was stomach cancer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just not like her to die," said a friend and former
assistant, Anne Cates. "She was always a fighter."</TE>
<TE>   By the time Morphonios published her book, written with the help
of Miami Herald writer Mike Wilson, in 1991, she had amassed a wealth
of experience.</TE>
<TE>   And, although she never sat on a bench anywhere outside Dade
County, Fla., she built a national following, thanks to profiles on
NBC Nightly News, CBS' "60 Minutes" and in such magazines as People
Weekly.</TE>
<TE>   Morphonios grew up poor, in a one-room shack without electricity
or running water in the Outer Banks of North Carolina. But she was
the much-loved only child of a frank-speaking woman and a
Montana-born farmer and roofer who taught her to fish and hunt and to
believe in his credo, "Don't ever be satisfied with what you got....
There's more down the road." He moved the family to Miami, where he
became a cab driver during her senior year in high school.</TE>
<TE>   Bright as well as pretty, Morphonios never went to college but got
a job in radio and became a secretary in a law office. She started
modeling, then got married and started having babies.</TE>
<TE>   With an IQ high enough to become a member of Mensa (limited to
about 2% of the population), Morphonios was admitted to the
University of Miami law school after taking a college equivalency
test.</TE>
<TE>   About 1960, after practicing law privately for several years, she
joined the state attorney's office as Florida's first female felony
prosecutor and soon became a star in the courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   Her highest-profile case was probably that of rock star Jim
Morrison, lead singer of the Doors.</TE>
<TE>   Morphonios prosecuted Morrison for allegedly exposing himself in
front of 10,000 people at a 1969 concert in Miami, winning
convictions for indecent exposure and use of profanity.</TE>
<TE>   The verdicts were appealed, but Morrison died in 1971, before
higher courts could act on the appeals.</TE>
<TE>   Morphonios ran for county judge in 1970 and got elected. She
stayed until 1991 when she stepped down in Operation Court Broom,
when three judicial colleagues were convicted in a bribery scandal.
Morphonios was investigated but never charged.</TE>
<TE>   She returned to work briefly in 1997 as a part-time judge but quit
when Florida's Judicial Qualifications Commission wanted to question
her anew about why she hadn't reported an alleged bribe attempt.</TE>
<TE>   Criminals, particularly those charged with violent acts, mostly
feared Morphonios. But her colleagues, even lawyers on the losing
side, respected her. In a 1989 Dade County Bar Assn. survey, 34% of
lawyers rated her "exceptionally qualified" and 53% called her
"qualified" for her job.</TE>
<TE>   "She's the toughest sentencing judge I've faced, but she's also
the fairest I've ever known," former Public Defender Carl Masztal
told People in 1989. "In her Darth Vader robe, she's God throwing
thunderbolts. But I've never seen her send an innocent man to
prison."</TE>
<TE>   Along with her memberships in Mensa and the National Organization
for Women, Morphonios belonged to the National Rifle Assn. She owned
half a dozen rifles and a pistol that she sometimes carried under her
robes.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, when only 3% of the NRA membership consisted of women,
Morphonios was invited to address its convention in Anaheim. She
delighted the audience by referring to rehabilitation for criminals
as "a myth," sentencing guidelines as "a joke" and plea bargaining as
"an abomination."</TE>
<TE>   She also called a then-recent California ban on semiautomatic
weapons "a silly little gun law" and predicted that criminals would
ignore it. Nevertheless, the law-abiding jurist advised gun owners to
obey the California law and to "send your guns to a relative in
Alabama."</TE>
<TE>   Morphonios' language on and off the bench was salty. Quotable as
she was, her pronouncements were often difficult for mainstream media
to print or air.</TE>
<TE>   "Written in the spicy style of Argosy, True or the Police Gazette,
circa 1959," a Times reviewer wrote of her book in 1991, "it is not
without a certain questionable charm."</TE>
<TE>   So tough in the courtroom she once ordered a defendant to "step
over the body" of a woman who had fainted before her, Morphonios off
the bench was as warm and fuzzy as her menagerie of dogs, cats and
chimpanzee. She made what court clerks, bailiffs, lawyers and other
judges called the world's best coffee -- spiked with a touch of
cinnamon -- and always had candy and cookies available for the daily
stream of visitors. She crocheted doilies for her lavender office and
afghans for her employees.</TE>
<TE>   Thrice divorced, Morphonios was married to the man she referred to
as "Husband No. 1," a teacher and dog breeder whose surname she kept
ever after, for 21 years; to "No. 2" for two years; and to "No. 3"
for five.</TE>
<TE>   She is survived by two sons, Dean and Dale Morphonios; four
grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Asked by Harry Reasoner when she appeared on "60 Minutes" more
than a decade ago what she would like inscribed on her tombstone,
Morphonios replied easily: "It may not make sense to you, but it does
to me. I would want it to say 'She was a stand-up broad.' "</TE>

<KH>REFLECTIONS ON 2002: ENVIRONMENT</KH>
<HD>A Widening Fissure Between State, Feds</HD>
<DH>On pollution, forests, deserts, species and offshore oil,
the political contrasts are stark.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth R. Weiss</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When it comes to placing a value on the environment, California has
rarely seemed so far from Washington, D.C.</LD>
<LD>   California this year added to its aggressive regulation of cars. A
first-in-the-nation law will require auto makers to combat global
warming by reducing emissions of carbon dioxide from their cars by
2009. Washington, which worries that aggressive regulation of cars
will hurt the economy, joined auto makers to try to reduce the
state's regulations, suing to block California's requirement for
zero-emission electric vehicles.</LD>
<LD>   California bought tens of thousands of acres of redwood forests
and wetlands during the year to preserve as wilderness, and the
state's voters shrugged off a slumping economy to approve two bond
measures totaling $6 billion to buy and protect even more.</LD>
<TE>   The Bush administration, meanwhile, moved to open the mountains to
more logging, the deserts to off-road vehicles and the oceans to more
offshore oil drilling. At the administration's behest, a D.C.-based
federal judge lifted protections across 4 million acres in California
for the imperiled red-legged frog, which was made famous as Mark
Twain's "Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County."</TE>
<TE>   The divergence in environmental visions is widening between the
nation's capital, dominated by Republicans, and the state capital,
run by Democrats, said Mary Nichols, California's secretary of
resources.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no question that the Bush administration has been
quietly, but systematically, discarding almost every environmental
policy put in place by the Clinton administration," Nichols said.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates for property rights and industries such as timber say
the change has come none too soon, because environmental interests
can go too far. "If left to their own devices, they would lock up the
deserts completely, lock up the forests and buy huge amounts of land
in the Sierras to force people out," said Chuck Cushman, founder of
the American Land Rights Assn. "I think the Bush administration is a
check on the extremes of the Left Coast."</TE>
<TE>   But state officials are dismayed about the lack of agreement with
federal counterparts over how to balance use and protection of
watersheds, forests, deserts and other undeveloped lands.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if I want to say distrust," Nichols said, "but there
is a suspicion that the other side will take a situation and use it
for political advantage."</TE>
<TE>   The difference owes much to politics, said Carl Pope, executive
director of the Sierra Club. President Bush has pretty much written
off California in his reelection plans and isn't worried about
opposition from environmentally minded voters in the state, Pope
said. In contrast, the administration is counting on support from
states in the interior West, where many voters think of mining,
logging and ranching more as sources of jobs than as causes of
environmental degradation.</TE>
<TE>   Public-Interest Dispute</TE>
<TE>   "California is moving forward on environmental protections and,
not only is Washington in an ebb tide, but this administration
believes ... lots of decisions should be made without involving the
public or consideration of environmental consequences," Pope said.</TE>
<TE>   Not true, said Lynn Scarlett, assistant secretary of the U.S.
Department of the Interior. Scarlett, who is from Montecito, Calif.,
said she and Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton and other
administration officials have devoted a great deal of time and care
trying to resolve environmental issues in California.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's goal is to listen to all competing interests,
she said, "juggling environmental values and community with economic
values and the ability for people to pursue their livelihoods and
economic dreams."</TE>
<TE>   Tensions and sometimes superheated rhetoric have flared much of
the year over regulations governing offshore oil drilling, air
pollution water allotments to farmers and fish and logging in the
Sierra Nevada, where the U.S. Forest Service has spent much of the
year reconsidering Clinton-era logging restrictions on 11.5 million
acres.</TE>
<TE>   The fight over water use was most dramatic in the Klamath River
basin. In September, 30,000 dead, rotting salmon lined the banks of
the Klamath, inflaming local Indian tribes and fishermen who said the
deaths had been caused by federal officials' diversion of too much
water to farmers upstream, near the California-Oregon border.</TE>
<TE>   In the deserts, the federal Bureau of Land Management has moved to
open up remote areas to more mining and grazing. More recently, it
has released plans to allow more off-road vehicles into areas of the
Sonora Desert in Imperial and Riverside counties that had been set
aside to protect the endangered California desert tortoise.</TE>
<TE>   "Across the board, we are seeing the administration rolling back
environmental gains of the last few years," said Daniel Patterson, a
former Bureau of Land Management employee and now a desert ecologist
with the Center for Biological Diversity.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most visible clashes has been over offshore oil.
California has been trying to halt any new drilling in federal waters
off the coast of Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties.</TE>
<TE>   The state won a victory when the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals
agreed that, before the federal government signs off on any drilling
plans, it must allow the California Coastal Commission to review
them.</TE>
<TE>   In the interim, California's Democratic politicians have pressured
President Bush to retire offshore oil leases by buying out the oil
companies, as he did earlier this year in Florida, where his brother
Jeb Bush is governor.</TE>
<TE>   Incensed Over Oil</TE>
<TE>   So far, Bush has not offered the same deal to California. Norton
pointed to oil wells that California allows in state-controlled
waters under leases negotiated years ago. "Florida opposes coastal
drilling, and California does not," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Her words unleashed a torrent of protests from environmental
groups and California politicians.</TE>
<TE>   Despite clashes with top-level federal officials, those on the
lower rungs said state and federal wildlife agencies continue to work
well together. Those in the field, said Hugh Vickery of the Interior
Department, often share the same vision. "There is a lot of good
work, hand in hand," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the ocean, federal officials joined -- and even led -- state
officials in instituting broad fishing bans to protect dwindling
numbers of bottom-dwelling rockfish. Much of the continental shelf is
now off-limits to bottom trawlers and other fishermen.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
also backed the state's adoption of the largest network of no-fishing
marine reserves in the continental United States. Clustered around
the Channel Islands, these reserves were a bold step in a new
approach -- protecting an entire ecosystem, rather than a species of
fish, from the ravages of excessive harvesting.</TE>
<TE>   State and federal officials have also cooperated on some land
purchases, although the state has taken the lead on the biggest buys
this year. Among the state purchases were 25,000 acres of coastal
redwoods and Douglas fir in the state's northwestern-most county of
Del Norte, 10,000 acres of ruggedly beautiful hills and mountains in
Big Sur, and 7,500 acres of redwood forest in Mendocino's Big River
area.</TE>
<TE>   California joined private foundations and the federal government
to buy 16,500 acres of salt ponds in South Francisco Bay to restore
tidal marshes needed to bring back fish and shorebirds.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, state officials purchased 1,400 acres in
the hills above Tuna Canyon in Malibu and joined federal officials in
buying all but the last 1.5-mile stretch needed to complete the
60-mile Backbone Trail along the spine of the Santa Monica Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   "The most amazing thing," said a California urban planning expert,
William Fulton, "is that we passed two bond measures in this kind of
economy to preserve more land."</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone agrees park bonds are a good thing when they have money
in their pockets," said Fulton, president of Solimar Research Group
in Ventura. "But to watch this persist is surprising and says
something about how people want to have nature accessible to them,
rather than having to go out to wilderness."</TE>

<HD>The Flowers and the Timing Are Exquisite</HD>
<DH>Growers Defy Nature and the Clock to Deliver Blooms to
Pasadena</DH>
<SE>One in an occasional series on the 2003 Tournament of Roses.</SE>
<AU>Joe Mathews</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ARCATA, Calif.</DL>
<LD>The flowers have left the building.</LD>
<LD>   The lilies had been planted the week after Labor Day in this foggy
coastal town not far from the Oregon border. They grew 3 feet high in
six long rows of matching black crates in the second bay of
Greenhouse 98, where computers regulated their sunlight, their water,
their fertilizer and their temperature for their total comfort.</LD>
<LD>   In the days before Christmas, 12,000 lilies -- timed perfectly to
the verge of turning pink or white or yellow -- were cut and sent on
a 48-hour journey by refrigerated truck to Pasadena, where they begin
arriving today.</LD>
<TE>   On New Year's Day, the flowers will slowly, beautifully,
dramatically -- but unmistakably -- die, even as they show off their
colors for the viewing pleasure of millions.</TE>
<TE>   "To make the cut flower do what it's supposed to, the timing, the
cutting, the soil, the light -- everything must be very precise,"
says Bruce Brady, sales and marketing director for Sun Valley Floral
Farms. "It's a high-pressure deal. If we miss by even a day or two,
we can be in a world of trouble."</TE>
<TE>   The 670-mile journey of the lilies, blue irises and pink French
tulips -- from the sprawling greenhouses here to Colorado Boulevard
-- is now one of the rarest and shortest trips any flowers make to
the parade. The grower, Sun Valley, is one of the last domestic
producers of flowers for the parade.</TE>
<TE>   As domestic rose production has declined over the last decade --
from 52% of the U.S. market to 22% -- the Rose Parade has turned to
overseas growers, mainly in Colombia and Ecuador, to fill its needs.</TE>
<TE>   Flowers from South America are cheaper and more available in the
winter. And many California growers are reluctant to grow for the
Rose Parade, preferring to focus on the more profitable bonanza of
Valentine's Day.</TE>
<TE>   "You could not pick a worse time of year for a massive floral
parade" in the Northern Hemisphere, says Greg Lewis. "I would suggest
they move it to Aug. 15."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis, a Pacific Palisades flower broker, is the man in the
middle, buying blooms from growers like Sun Valley and selling them
to the float builders.</TE>
<TE>   He is the first person that one of the major float builders,
Fiesta Parade Floats, calls in the summer, when its floral director
begins ordering flowers. Trained in the Netherlands, Lewis comes from
a family of Boston florists. He is so busy during the holidays -- the
Rose Parade is 20% of his business -- that his family leaves town
without him.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis in turn calls dozens of flower farms, attempting to assemble
100,000 stems of a particular flower in purchases of as few as 300
stems at a time.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis' bills are often so long and complicated that it takes him a
month after the parade just to total them up. As a result, float
builders -- always nervous about flower costs, their second-highest
expense after labor -- sometimes don't know whether they have made a
profit on a parade until February.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of flowers runs into the tens of thousands of dollars for
a large float.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis works with farms ranging from South America to Israel and
Indonesia for the balance of the flowers he orders.</TE>
<TE>   He turns to Sun Valley Floral for more expensive, high-quality
specialty items -- particularly blue irises. (Blue is the most
difficult color to incorporate into a Rose Parade float because it is
the rarest.)</TE>
<TE>   Lewis also uses Sun Valley as a last-minute outlet when overseas
flowers don't come through, a too-frequent occurrence in an
international supply chain that has been interrupted by bad weather,
volcanic eruptions, civil wars, airline strikes and the occasional
punitive tariff.</TE>
<TE>   "We always tease Greg -- and he's easy to tease because he gets so
worked up -- by asking him, 'What's your excuse going to be this
year?' " says Beverly Stansbury, administrator at Fiesta Parade
Floats.</TE>
<TE>   As a broker, Lewis is literally caught between float builder and
floral farm. He and Sun Valley prefer to get orders six months early,
allowing for the planting of rare varieties to produce specific
colors. But the float builders often let their orders slide deep into
the fall.</TE>
<TE>   "If the float people would plan better," says Brady, "we can
manipulate the flowers and give them a more specific price they can
plan around.</TE>
<TE>   "With time, we can fulfill more of their needs."</TE>
<TE>   Sun Valley Floral Farms consists of dozens of huge greenhouses and
warehouses resting on 400-plus acres in Arcata, an old logging town
squeezed between the Pacific Coast Range and Humboldt Bay.</TE>
<TE>   An Oregon agricultural professor brought the company here in 1964,
drawn by the same moderate climate -- winter nights in the 40s,
summer days topping out in the 60s -- that helps the region's
redwoods grow.</TE>
<TE>   In 1974, a local scientist hybridized an Oriental lily called the
Stargazer. It remains Sun Valley's signature flower.</TE>
<TE>   Ten years later, the farm's Dutch-born general manager, Lane
DeVries, built its first greenhouse. He bought the company with two
partners in 1991 and continued modernizing.</TE>
<TE>   Sun Valley Floral now boasts 2.4 million square feet of greenhouse
space and four production facilities on the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   That capacity allows Sun Valley to grow a wide variety of flowers
year-round -- making it particularly attractive for Pasadena's big
Jan. 1 floral parade.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not Valentine's Day, but it's a huge seasonal event with an
impact on the market," Brady says.</TE>
<TE>   "There's also a prestige involved with it. And when someone comes
in with a 10,000-stem-or-more order of anything, let me tell you: I'm
smiling."</TE>
<TE>   The bulbs that become Rose Parade flowers are supplied by Sun
Valley's Dutch sister company, which produces them either in Europe
or the Southern Hemisphere.</TE>
<TE>   When they arrive, they are placed in black plastic crates that
have been carefully sterilized to prevent disease. The crates -- 20
inches long, a foot wide and 4 inches tall -- are placed in
refrigerators the size of a gymnasium until the bulbs are ready for
planting.</TE>
<TE>   The timing of that planting is keyed to the parade.</TE>
<TE>   To grow, the crates of flowers at Sun Valley are laid out in long,
symmetrical rows inside the greenhouses.</TE>
<TE>   The treasured blue irises are an exception. They stay outside in
open-ended plastic tents, in part because the wind rustling through
seems to make the flowers stronger.</TE>
<TE>   The rows are planted on particular dates and are arranged
chronologically. To walk through a Sun Valley greenhouse is to peer
through a slow-motion camera, each line of flowers a little bit
further along than the next.</TE>
<TE>   Tulips will reach maturity in about four weeks. Irises need 12 to
14 weeks, lilies up to four months.</TE>
<TE>   The flowers are picked just before Christmas by workers who
typically make $10 to $12 per hour, plus free flowers twice a week.
They are held in refrigerators before being loaded on refrigerated
trucks on Dec. 23 and 24. After a stop at a Sun Valley facility in
Oxnard, the flowers arrive in Pasadena each year on the morning of
Dec. 26.</TE>
<TE>   As Brady ate a seafood lunch on Humboldt Bay a few weeks ago,
Lewis called to discuss the blue irises. Like any blue flower, they
are a sensitive subject. With several floats taking patriotic themes,
float builders need a blue suitable for the American flag. Besides
irises (and sometimes statice), builders seeking blue have few good
options.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis wanted to make sure that the irises would be light blue,
rather than the more typical purplish blue.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have it," Brady said.</TE>
<TE>   He explained to the broker that the light blue variety doesn't
grow well at this time of year. Maybe if Sun Valley had had six
months notice, it could have produced the desired flower. But not
now.</TE>
<TE>   "As technologically advanced as this business is now," Brady says,
"we still have to deal with the laws of nature."</TE>

<HD>State Hit Hard by Medical Fraud</HD>
<DH>Medi-Cal scam artists steal billions sorely needed for
budget gap. One dentist charged for filling teeth that had already
been extracted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Reiterman and Virginia Ellis</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Doctors, dentists, pharmacists and others in the health-care industry
have been stealing huge sums from California's $25-billion Medi-Cal
program despite increased state and federal efforts to combat fraud.</LD>
<LD>   California can ill afford to lose billions of dollars from its
health program for the poor, especially now that the state and
federal governments both face large deficits and lawmakers are
expected to try next year to cut spending on Medi-Cal. Gov. Gray
Davis already has proposed trimming $167 million from the program,
which is jointly funded by the state and federal governments.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities have made a concerted effort to counter Medi-Cal
fraud. In the last few years, criminal charges have been filed
against about 700 people and companies accused of stealing from
Medi-Cal. The state attorney general and the U.S. attorney's office
in Sacramento, where the bulk of the federal charges are lodged,
together have won almost $100 million in restitution. State health
officials believe their civil enforcement actions have saved hundreds
of millions more.</LD>
<TE>   However, the program is so enormous, and the opportunities for
fraud so widespread, that few think the efforts so far have done much
more than hold the line. "Health-care crime is rampant in
California," said James Wedick, head of the FBI's white-collar crime
unit in Sacramento. "Even though our efforts have increased and we're
getting good at it, I am still convinced there is as much fraud as
ever."</TE>
<TE>   A clinic owner charged Medi-Cal for perinatal services to women
who already had undergone abortions. A dentist charged for filling
teeth that already had been extracted. A suspended doctor billed for
hundreds of nuclear brain scans although he lacked the proper
equipment and expertise. A podiatrist billed for $250 custom-molded
foot supports although he had outfitted patients with generic $24
shoe inserts.</TE>
<TE>   The fraud is heavily concentrated in population centers of
Southern California where there are large numbers of poor people and
many immigrant communities that investigators say are particularly
vulnerable to fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts estimate that up to 10% of health-care dollars are
stolen. For Medi-Cal, that translates to about $2.5 billion a year,
almost half from the state general fund.</TE>
<TE>   State health Director Diana M. Bonta considers such estimates high
but says, "Even 1% is too much.... Zero is what we want and why we
have been so aggressive.... People need these programs."</TE>
<TE>   The stakes are enormous in the battle against criminals
investigators call "the fraudsters." Created in 1965, Medi-Cal covers
health care for 6 million poor, aged, blind and disabled people by
reimbursing providers for products and services.</TE>
<TE>   And people who want to cheat the system have adopted sophisticated
methods to stay one step ahead of authorities:</TE>
<TE>   * Some steal the identities and billing numbers of
legitimate health professionals, then use the information to submit phony
bills to Medi-Cal and collect millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   * Others peddle lists of Medi-Cal patient names and identification
numbers. Crooked health-care providers use the information to dummy
up bills to Medi-Cal without seeing the patients.</TE>
<TE>   * A cottage industry has developed to sell blood from street
people and others to laboratories. The labs then bill Medi-Cal for
expensive blood tests that were never authorized by physicians or
performed by the labs.</TE>
<TE>   "The entrepreneurial spirit of those who commit this kind of fraud
is as creative as it is insatiable," said Collin Wong, executive
director of the attorney general's Bureau of Medi-Cal Fraud. "If one
area of criminal activity is closed to them, they'll migrate to
another."</TE>
<TE>   Immigrant populations pose particular challenges to investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Take the case of L &amp; M Diamond Jewelry Optical in West Hollywood,
a mom-and-pop store with wares such as glass beads, Russian stacking
dolls and sunglasses.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its modest facade, the store billed Medi-Cal for about
62,000 pairs of prescription eyeglasses from 1993 to mid-2001. State
records show patients receiving up to 18 or more pairs during just a
few years -- but several told investigators they actually got few if
any.</TE>
<TE>   Mila Sigal and her husband, David, were charged with Medi-Cal
fraud and the theft of more than $3 million. The couple pleaded
guilty. David Sigal received five years' probation while Mila Sigal
faces sentencing on charges that call for up to three years in
prison. They paid more than $100,000 in restitution but have been
resisting the state's attempts to get almost $3.5 million more.</TE>
<TE>   Mila Sigal's attorney, Tracy Green, said her client submitted
multiple false claims to cover the cost of designer eyewear that
customers wanted instead of less expensive glasses the state pays
for.</TE>
<TE>   "Lots of the beneficiaries are from former communist republics who
are used to getting around the system," Green said.</TE>
<TE>   The integrity of Medi-Cal hinges largely on identification numbers
issued to health-care providers and patients. But the state has
struggled to keep the numbers from being misused. A few years ago,
some streets in Los Angeles County were packed with phony medical
equipment suppliers. They operated out of storefronts with virtually
no inventory or clientele, or simply used mail drops.</TE>
<TE>   Medi-Cal's weaknesses have been obvious for some time. A U.S.
General Accounting Office report in 2001 noted that the program was
admitting doctors, labs and others who had questionable billing
histories and allowing some to have multiple numbers.</TE>
<TE>   A state audit this year found that controls need further
tightening to avoid enrolling or re-enrolling people intent on fraud.
Health officials say they have improved procedures and are reviewing
new applications more carefully.</TE>
<TE>   As part of a crackdown, the state forced all 1,400
medical equipment suppliers to re-enroll in the Medi-Cal system; when the
state did that, more than half dropped out.</TE>
<TE>   "They did not want to come back because [many] were Mail Boxes
Etc.-type places," said Diana Ducay, who oversees the health
department's 200-member anti-fraud force.</TE>
<TE>   To improve the screening, the state now visits all applicants.
However, with nearly 150,000 providers, officials say the state lacks
the resources to regularly inspect them all.</TE>
<TE>   When medical labs became fertile ground for fraud, the state
imposed a moratorium on new applicants in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say that step, however, came too late to stop Surinder
Singh Panshi, whose case illustrates many of the weaknesses in the
system.</TE>
<TE>   Panshi had been convicted twice of health-care fraud in New York
and served five years. Using blood purchased from addicts and poor
people, his labs billed that state's Medicaid program $3.6 million
for unnecessary tests in the late 1980s. Some donors were almost
literally bled to death, leading the prosecutor to call it "perhaps
the largest and most nefarious [health] fraud ever perpetrated."</TE>
<TE>   After being released from prison, Panshi came to California, where
officials say he and his confederates used a dozen blood labs to bilk
Medi-Cal out of $11 million.</TE>
<TE>   Panshi never was listed as a person being reimbursed by Medi-Cal.
But investigators heard that a mysterious "Dr. Khan" was a hidden
owner of two labs.</TE>
<TE>   A lab accountant had shipped a Federal Express package to New
Jersey where Panshi maintained a home not far from a variety store
where millions of dollars in Medi-Cal checks were cashed. Confronted
by investigators, the accountant said Kahn was Panshi. "This is an
organized crime group operating the laboratories, like the Mafia," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   When Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer's office filed charges in June,
investigators had linked 13 labs to Panshi's group and found that the
labs submitted phony bills for thousands of tests authorized by two
dozen doctors whose identities were stolen. Two of the doctors were
dead when bills were submitted in their names.</TE>
<TE>   Several labs were run by Linda Dizon, who reached a plea deal and
was described in court records as Panshi's girlfriend. Some, she told
state investigators, were "wang bang" labs, meaning they ran no
tests. Others tested old and useless "bad blood." Either way,
Medi-Cal got billed.</TE>
<TE>   Dizon also said money from the scheme was used to buy her $75,000
Porsche and a home in Diamond Bar that she and Panshi bought for
$350,000 at a Los Angeles County auction.</TE>
<TE>   Supervising Deputy Atty. Gen. Hardy Gold said four defendants in
the case are fugitives, and all but two of the others have pleaded
guilty and are awaiting sentencing.</TE>
<TE>   Gold said Panshi, who is being held on $2-million bail in Orange
County, is scheduled to appear Jan. 3 and respond to a plea bargain
offer that would include lengthy prison terms in California and New
Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   "It is our belief that [Panshi] has to be sent to prison for a
number of years," Gold said. "His prior convictions have not deterred
him from stealing from the public."</TE>
<TE>   Panshi's attorney, Sean Singh, declined to discuss the case but
said, "He is a very nice guy, very personable. He is a family man."</TE>
<TE>   As with most health-care frauds, little money has been recovered.</TE>
<TE>   State officials have found that as soon as they close one avenue
to fraud in the program, another opens.</TE>
<TE>   It costs almost $7,000 for a one-month prescription of Serostim, a
human growth hormone used as an AIDS anti-wasting drug. But there's
also a black market among body builders.</TE>
<TE>   Health investigators uncovered a statewide ring led by a former
radiologist who purchased beneficiary numbers, stole physician
identities and created phony Serostim prescriptions. The ring got
away with filling them repeatedly, at multiple pharmacies. Then the
suspects allegedly peddled the drug at gyms and spas.</TE>
<TE>   The cost to Medi-Cal was $3.5 million, according to a San Diego
County grand jury indictment a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   After reimbursement levels for dental work were increased in the
early 1990s, officials saw Denti-Cal fraud climb.</TE>
<TE>   Mikhail Kopilevich and Micha Chelzinger, veterans of the Russian
and Israeli armies respectively, decided to open their own dental
clinics after starting out as lowly cappers -- people who recruited
Medi-Cal patients for a price.</TE>
<TE>   "They were quick studies," said Deputy Atty. Gen. Alexandra
Ramsburg Kirk.</TE>
<TE>   Forming a partnership with a young dentist in Moreno Valley, they
hired other dentists and enlisted cappers who used cash, tennis shoes
and other gifts to woo patients.</TE>
<TE>   After the state served a search warrant in 1999, they concentrated
on two other clinics. Rather than hiring dentists and finding
patients, Kopilevich and Chelzinger stole identifying information.
They laundered some of the Medi-Cal money by writing paychecks to
ghost employees.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an interesting thing about Medi-Cal fraud," Kirk said.
"You close one hole, and they are not scared or anything. They are so
brazen."</TE>
<TE>   Another dental fraud scheme victimized the very people Medi-Cal is
designed to help.</TE>
<TE>   In February 1999, a Spanish-speaking man came to the home of a
Latino woman in San Bernardino County, saying he was from the
"Medi-Cal Department."</TE>
<TE>   At his urging, the woman and several of her children joined
vanloads of poor patients being shuttled to a Montclair dental
clinic. But things went frighteningly wrong. After a dentist began
working on the woman's 11-year-old daughter, the child fainted and
started to go into shock. At a local hospital, a doctor said she had
received too much local anesthetic as the dentist filled almost a
dozen cavities -- an approach that maximizes Medi-Cal reimbursements
but can lead to death.</TE>
<TE>   The dentist, it turned out, was unlicensed in California. And the
Medi-Cal "employee" was one of dozens of cappers for three clinics
operated by dentist Yoram Isaacson. He and his brother, Joseph
Isaacson, pleaded no contest in April 2000 to grand theft and making
false Medi-Cal claims. Each was sentenced to two years in prison and
ordered to pay more than $1 million in restitution and investigation
costs.</TE>
<TE>   The integrity of Medi-Cal sometimes has been undermined from
within.</TE>
<TE>   Three health department employees were convicted of accepting
payments to expedite claims or applications for provider numbers. And
another corruption case reached inside Electronic Data Systems, which
reviews $200 million in Medi-Cal claims each week. A former company
employee recently was convicted of paying gratuities to other
employees to facilitate $350,000 in claims.</TE>
<TE>   Wong, the attorney general's Medi-Cal fraud chief, said the state
needs to attack the fraud problem on multiple fronts -- by tightening
access to the provider rolls, paying enough to attract legitimate
providers and vigorously monitoring payments and prosecuting the
cheaters.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the state is able to do that is a "multibillion question,"
he said.</TE>

<KH>TIMES HOLIDAY FUND</KH>
<HD>At Cerebral Palsy Agency, Costs Are Up and Morale Is Down</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Martelle</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a beautiful late fall morning in Santa Ana, the air so crisp and
dry the San Gabriel Mountains look like sugar mounds on the horizon.</LD>
<LD>   Inside United Cerebral Palsy Assn. of Orange County, a stately
two-story house that could have been lifted from a Midwestern farm,
five children sit around the curl of a horseshoe-shaped table, gluing
little red bits next to their pictures on cards that can double as
Christmas tree ornaments.</LD>
<LD>   It should be a festive time. But twin currents of pain and grief
have converged here.</LD>
<TE>   A 2-year-old client with Down syndrome died a few days before,
unable to survive a third surgical procedure on his heart. And about
25 of the agency's 90 employees are being laid off as the association
prepares to close its adult-services unit by next month.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't afford to do it any longer," executive director Paul
Pulver said. The culprit: stagnant state reimbursement fees and
donations, combined with skyrocketing costs for everything from
supplies to insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the agency's 85 adult clients will be taken in by programs
run by other agencies, as will many of the laid-off workers, Pulver
said.</TE>
<TE>   But that does little to ease the pain as the 50-year-old
organization refocuses on its other programs, which help 1,100
children and their families adjust to a wide range of developmental
problems, including cerebral palsy, the agency's namesake.</TE>
<TE>   Among its services is Respite Connection, in which trained adult
caregivers go to the homes of about 150 developmentally disabled
children, allowing parents to take a break from what can be an
overwhelming responsibility. The program occasionally gives parents a
night away at a local hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "Many times, the impact on the family is very intense," said
Pulver. "A lot of families will never take a break."</TE>
<TE>   The agency received a $10,000 grant from last year's Times Holiday
Campaign, which was established in 2000 as part of the Los Angeles
Times Family Fund. Last year, the program raised $653,000, which was
granted to 56 service organizations in Los Angeles, Orange,
Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties.</TE>
<TE>   These agencies provide a range of services to disadvantaged
children and youth, including food, clothing and shelter, early
childhood literacy programs, services for developmentally delayed and
developmentally disabled children and programs to prevent drug abuse,
violence and teen pregnancy.</TE>
<TE>   The Times Family Fund is a fund of the McCormick Tribune
Foundation, which matches the first $700,000 raised at 50 cents on
the dollar. The foundation and the Los Angeles Times cover all
administrative costs. This year's Holiday Campaign will collect
donations through Tuesday (gifts received after that date will be
accepted).</TE>

<HD>Incredible Journey of the Santa Barbara 5</HD>
<DH>After five meerkats went missing, the zoo went to
extraordinary efforts to find and rescue them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Veronique de Turenne</AU>
<BD>Special to the Times</BD>
<DL>SANTA BARBARA</DL>
<LD>This is a city married to the mob. Of meerkats. Five funny, furry,
almost fantastical creatures from the Santa Barbara Zoo that, in
three short years of life, have been lent, lost, stolen, sold, found
and rescued.</LD>
<LD>   Their exploits involved tragedy, danger and notoriety. Their
rescue entailed a trip in a private plane and, inevitably,
commemorative T-shirts, plush action figures and a fan club. Now safe
and healthy, they will slowly be reintroduced to the meerkat exhibit
and to their eager, adoring public early next year.</LD>
<LD>   "These are the most famous and, I suspect, the most expensive
meerkats in history," said Rich Block, the zoo's director. He
estimates that the zoo spent about $18,000 in legal fees and travel
costs to rescue the animals.</LD>
<TE>   "Now that we've got them back, they're never leaving the zoo
again."</TE>
<TE>   Meerkats, indigenous to Africa's Kalahari Desert, are members of
the mongoose family. At peace they're known as a gang; in fight mode,
they are a mob. They have raccoon-like faces, stand a foot tall,
weigh about two pounds and have nimble, four-fingered paws with long
claws for digging burrows and seeking prey: worms, crickets, grubs
and scorpions.</TE>
<TE>   On their bellies they have black skin, which absorbs heat when
they sun themselves on chilly desert mornings, and on their backs
spiky fur, which they arrange into a puff of insulation when the
African sun gets too fierce. Because they are, as animal experts like
to say, "snack size," meerkats have evolved a complex, cooperative
society, complete with baby-sitters, sentries, dozens of alarm calls
and a deep distrust of strangers. Still, the mortality rate for
adults in the wild can reach 50%. They live to be about 8 years old
in the wild and 10 or more in captivity.</TE>
<TE>   "They're fascinating animals," Block said. "Even before all this
happened, they had quite a following."</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara's meerkat epic began two years ago when the zoo lent
the five meerkats to a facility in Texas. On Aug. 5, an investigative
story in U.S. News and World Report about accredited zoos that sell
excess animals to unaccredited facilities cited the Santa Barbara
Zoo's meerkats among the animals in an abandoned zoo in New
Braunfels, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   "After I got over the cardiac arrest, we sorted it out," Block
said. "By Wednesday of that week we hired a law firm in San Antonio
to help us."</TE>
<TE>   The defunct Texas zoo's owner said the meerkats, which the Santa
Barbara Zoo still owned, had escaped or been stolen. But in early
September, a persistent inspector with the U.S Department of
Agriculture located them in the home of a private dealer, who had
paid $200 each for the animals and was keeping them as pets.</TE>
<TE>   "We called the dealer and he was willing to give them up," Block
said. "Within 90 minutes, they were in a holding facility at the San
Antonio Zoo."</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Barbara Zoo has since amended its policy and will sell
and lend animals only to accredited facilities.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 3, in a plane owned and piloted by Santa Barbara dentist
Jerry Woolf, the meerkats touched down at Santa Barbara Municipal
Airport.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a great trip -- a great group of people and a great
cause," said Dr. Alex Soffici, a perinatologist who co-piloted the
plane and sometimes lends his own airplane to the zoo.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd look back into the plane and see the guys handing the
meerkats grapes and hard-boiled eggs, and you could see their little
paws coming out of the pet carriers to get the food," Soffici said.</TE>
<TE>   When they all landed, however, they got a nasty shock. In about
six hours that the meerkats had been separated, the animals, which
have poor close-range vision and rely on smell for identification,
had lost track of the group hierarchy. When handlers opened the pet
carriers in the zoo's holding facilities, the Santa Barbara Five, as
the local paper had nicknamed them, went nuts.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lot of yelling and screaming and jumping on one
another -- it was pretty intense," said Alan Varsik, general curator
at the zoo. "It looked and sounded very ferocious, but after about 20
minutes they sorted things out and went back to being the close group
that they were."</TE>
<TE>   Which leads to one final problem now facing the zoo.</TE>
<TE>   While the Santa Barbara Five were gone, the zoo opened a new
250-square-foot meerkat exhibit. Three meerkats now call the exhibit
home. How to add five strangers and still keep the peace has zoo
officials scratching their heads.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still talking about that one," Varsik said. "We've got some
ideas we're going to try -- maybe rotate one group in and the other
out, maybe introduce the new ones slowly."</TE>
<TE>   And when they finally make their debut, Varsik expects some
meerkat mania.</TE>
<TE>   "They were an obsession with this city for a while," he said.
"When they come back, we're sure they'll be headline news again."</TE>

<HD>The Rise and Stall of LACMA's Planned Reinvention</HD>
<DH>Tough times and tight wallets doom ambitious goal to tear
the museum down and rebuild.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christopher Reynolds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How does a $400-million project to transform the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art go from fast-forward to pause in 364 days?</LD>
<LD>   "The environment simply went to hell. I don't know how else to
phrase it," said Walter Weisman, chairman of the museum's board,
looking back on the grand fund-raising, demolition and construction
project that the museum unveiled a year ago, then put on hold
indefinitely earlier this month.</LD>
<LD>   But the rise and stall of LACMA's planned reinvention is a story
with more plot twists than that.</LD>
<TE>   In interviews, Weisman, LACMA president and director Andrea Rich
and other key players sketch a tense 12 months punctuated with
recurring financial uncertainties as they tried to advance architect
Rem Koolhaas' revolutionary idea for the museum.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have the money to have Rem go full blast into the next
phase," Weisman said. If someone stepped up with $10 million to
revive work on the design, he said, "that would be wonderful. But no
one has."</TE>
<TE>   Rich and Weisman are quick to say that the project is not exactly
dead. But somebody has to head the donor line -- apparently somebody
besides L.A. philanthropist Eli Broad, who tops the list of likely
donors but prefers not to stand alone.</TE>
<TE>   Another LACMA trustee, requesting anonymity, said, "I think [Rich
and Weisman] would have OKd the expenditures for the next step if
they had more optimism about the long run."</TE>
<TE>   The run-up to this drama began in mid-2001, when LACMA trustees
held a design competition for a museum renovation, then gave the
thumbs-up to the only contestant who ignored the rules: Koolhaas of
Rotterdam, the Netherlands, who proposed leveling LACMA's four
awkwardly arrayed buildings. In their place would rise a new museum
with a plaza downstairs and the collections reorganized upstairs
under a tent-like roof.</TE>
<TE>   The cost estimate didn't come from Koolhaas. Each of the
architects in the competition was asked to propose a $200-million
renovation. Noting the escalating costs that accompany construction
jobs, LACMA's leaders guessed the price might climb another $100
million. To keep operations stable, they wanted to add $100 million
to LACMA's endowment (now at $77 million). Which adds up to a capital
campaign for $350 million to $400 million.</TE>
<TE>   To raise that, Weisman said, he and Rich first aimed to gather
$300 million in pledges on paper in a "quiet phase" of 12 to 18
months. Another two to four years of public campaigning would
generate the remaining $50 million to $100 million.</TE>
<TE>   "I am concerned about where the money will come from," warned
LACMA life trustee Robert Ahmanson on the eve of the vote. That
didn't entirely surprise insiders; his family name is on one of the
buildings targeted for demolition. And by then, the bandwagon was
rolling.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dec. 5, 2001 -- With 23 of LACMA's 50-some trustees present, the
LACMA board votes unanimously to support the Koolhaas plan.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Before the vote, Rich said later, she conferred with many
potential donors. She came away encouraged, even though, on the day
of the vote, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index was down about 11% for
the year.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next 12 months, the S&amp;P 500 would fall another 22%.
Though the board embraced the project, there were complaints about
the design, about devoting millions to a building instead of to art
and about casting aside four existing buildings, none more than 37
years old.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole process," Rich said later, "had one side of the
population thrilled and the other side furious."</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the question of Broad, a LACMA board member, a
booster of the Koolhaas plan and the city's most visible cultural
donor.</TE>
<TE>   Insiders at local philanthropies say Broad is known for using his
prospective gifts to pry contributions from other sources and to
further his own preferences -- a strategy few dare criticize
publicly.</TE>
<TE>   In January, and later, Rich said only that Broad had "given me
something to work with" and that other trustees "made commitments to
make commitments."</TE>
<TE>   This, fund-raising experts say, is not uncommon. Big-name
architects and their designs are often used to help sell capital
projects and, at the moment they're announced, as in LACMA's case,
institutions often have no donor commitments on paper.</TE>
<TE>   The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, which now has
its own $300-million renovation project in the planning stages,
introduced Steven Holl as its architect in July 2002. Dyan Sublett,
the institution's vice president for advancement, says she is still a
long way from written commitments.</TE>
<TE>   But what did Broad dangle at LACMA? Within a few weeks of the
board vote, he told The Times that his donation would be "more than
our family has ever given to any other building, by some margin" --
that is, more than the $23 million given to Caltech.</TE>
<TE>   He also warned that "we don't want to end up with a Disney Hall
situation," referring to the decade of stalled progress and tightrope
fund-raising behind the downtown L.A. concert hall, now due to open
next fall.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   February through April -- As the stock market slumps, Rich and
Weisman find a tepid response among donors. But Zev Yaroslavsky,
chairman of the county Board of Supervisors, steps up with an idea.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking at the plans of LACMA and the Natural History Museum,
Yaroslavsky saw a chance to seek public money. The idea grew into a
$250-million ballot measure bond issue, to be paid for with a
property tax hike. If passed in November by a two-thirds majority,
the measure would have sent $98 million to each museum, provided each
museum raised $112.5 million elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky said later that the odds were less than 50-50 of
getting the bond issue passed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Summer  -- Rich joins a team of LACMA curators and administrators
on a fact-finding trip to Rotterdam and to European museums. She
returns, however, to find no improvement on the private fund-raising
front.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Typically, early meetings with a prospect might lead Rich to hope
for a pledge of $10 million or more. But as the year advanced, "I
would get answers like, 'Maybe $5 million, over five to seven years,'
" she said later.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 6, Yaroslavsky, LACMA and the Natural History Museum
unveiled ballot Measure A, labeled "earthquake and fire safety
improvements."</TE>
<TE>   Rich had said at the beginning that the museum wouldn't seek
public money, but now it seemed vital.</TE>
<TE>   The following month, Koolhaas unveiled a more complete model of
his project and reported that studies showed the new building would
weigh less than the existing LACMA buildings. Hence his plan to reuse
the plinth -- the original base -- potentially saving millions,
seemed feasible. Specific questions related to the roof design were
still hanging. To get those answered and complete schematic designs,
Koolhaas said, could take from one to two years, at a cost of about
$4 million.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile Broad, leading the charge in support of Measure A,
contributed $1.2 million and loaned another $1 million to the
campaign to get it passed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nov. 5 and beyond:  Measure A draws 60.5% of the vote, short of
the 66.7% needed. At the Natural History Museum, renovation plans are
unchanged. As for LACMA, Broad tells the press, "I can't do it
alone.... Where does all the rest come from?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No answers were forthcoming. Rich faced the LACMA board Dec. 4 and
outlined the capital campaign's fading prospects. They agreed to back
off on the new design, and the what-if and why-didn't games began.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of institutional reinvention, Rich said later, she and her
staff would focus on upgrades at the LACMA West building and
improvements related to programs and the endowment -- goals, she
said, that are "doable in my lifetime."</TE>
<TE>   About a week after the board decision, Broad told The Times he was
ready to contribute $50 million to the project but didn't take the
step because nobody else was ready to make a comparable commitment.
And "even if you got one or two others, what you end up with might
have gotten you halfway there."</TE>
<TE>   The design's biggest boosters seized on the estimated $4-million
cost of having Koolhaas do schematic designs: For less than the $5
million spent on the ballot campaign, they argued, the trustees could
buy a year or two, and give the economy a chance to turn around.</TE>
<TE>   Rich's response: "It's easy for other people to say: '$4 million,
what a tiny sum of money.' But $4 [million] to $5 million for LACMA
is not a pittance."</TE>
<TE>   Where, outsiders wondered, were LACMA's other trustees and their
wallets?</TE>
<TE>   From mid-1999 to mid-2001, tax disclosures show, nongovernmental
contributions to the museum added up to more than $52 million, with
trustees responsible for much of that. On Dec. 3, the Annenberg
Foundation, of which LACMA trustee Wallis Annenberg is vice
president, announced a $10-million gift to LACMA's endowment fund.
But capital giving is different.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, fund-raisers say, major donors have begun to
demand design details before making commitments. Since schematic
designs often cost millions, this means a chicken-and-egg quandary on
the front end of every big capital project.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, said LACMA board President Weisman, he wouldn't expect a
donor to commit a major capital pledge to paper until "you've priced
things. This brick costs a dollar, this chair costs $3 -- a level of
precision in what you're presenting that enables someone to say yes
or no."</TE>
<TE>   As for Broad, who did not respond to requests for comment for this
article, "he seems very unwilling to get into a philanthropic boat
without a bunch of people with him," said California Community
Foundation President Jack Shakely.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Prudent' Decision?</TE>
<TE>   LACMA's state of limbo is not unique. In New York, the Guggenheim
Museum has shelved plans for a new complex in lower Manhattan. San
Francisco's Jewish Museum has similarly deferred a new building, and
many other organizations have quietly lengthened construction and
fund-raising schedules.</TE>
<TE>   After LACMA's decision to back off, at least two veteran
fund-raisers -- the Natural History Museum's Sublett and Gary
Phillips, a Santa Monica-based consultant -- were quick to reach for
the word "prudent."</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly, you could not pick a worse time to raise money," said
Jerry E. Mandel, president of the Orange County Performing Arts
Center, which delayed its timetable for a new concert hall announced
in 1999. The $200-million campaign has reached only its halfway
point, and the opening date has been delayed from 2005 to 2006.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's the question for LACMA," he said. "How certain are they of
their lead gift?"</TE>
<TE>   For Rich, that was last month's question. Since Dec. 4, she's
looking less at the far horizon.</TE>
<TE>   "There are people prepared to contribute substantial sums to the
museum, to its programs and to its endowment," she said last week.</TE>
<TE>   "So we will pursue a fund-raising effort. What we will do with the
facilities part of that, I have to study."</TE>

<HD>Homeless May Be Sleepless if Law Passes</HD>
<DH>With what could be the nation's biggest population without
homes, L.A. may ban lying or sitting in doorways at night.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jocelyn Y. Stewart</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One day after Santa Monica passed an ordinance making it illegal to
lie or sit in its doorways at night, Los Angeles City Councilwoman
Jan Perry called for a similar law aimed at those who sleep on the
streets of downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   "This vast crush of homeless persons has exhausted our resources
and strained our abilities to effectively manage this problem,"
Perry's motion read. "Yesterday, the city of Santa Monica took some
steps to address this issue. We can do no less."</LD>
<LD>   That was in October. Now Los Angeles stands poised to take up a
question that has vexed cities across the nation: Should homeless
people be allowed to sleep in public spaces?</LD>
<TE>   The city attorney still must research the issue and present
proposed ordinances for the City Council for study and debate. But
with what is believed to be the largest homeless population in the
nation and Los Angeles' huge influence in the county, all concerned
are watching, hoping to swing the city to their side.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes there can be a domino effect, where city after city
passes this type of ordinance," said Maria Foscarinis, executive
director of the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, one month after Santa Monica enacted its law, Palmdale
passed a similar one.</TE>
<TE>   Foscarinis finds such measures "especially frightening. Then
homeless people literally have no place to go. It resembles a kind of
banishing of homeless people."</TE>
<TE>   The debate surrounding such laws -- which levy punishments ranging
from tickets to jail -- makes clear the philosophical divide
separating opponents and supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Until society can provide housing for all, one side argues, such
laws are immoral.</TE>
<TE>   On the other side are those who say that, for the good of public
health and safety, people should not live in public spaces. And that
cities should not tolerate the lawlessness that can accompany street
living.</TE>
<TE>   In downtown Los Angeles, which stands on the brink of historic
change, with two major redevelopment plans scheduled, business owners
met last month with police and called for a list of measures to clean
up the area, including the creation of an anti-camping ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   Such a law would target those who sleep in large tents that block
sidewalks, said Tracey Lovejoy, executive director of the Central
City East Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "In our area, we have 10 streets where the sidewalk is completely
uninhabitable for someone to walk down," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The tents also provide cover for drug dealing and prostitution,
Lovejoy said. Allowing such tents is an example of a double standard
in dealing with skid row, she said: The city permits activities there
that it would never allow elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "Why is it OK on Gladys and 4th and not in Brentwood? Why is it OK
here and not anywhere else in the city?" Lovejoy asked</TE>
<TE>   Perry said the goal of her motion is to disperse homeless people,
"especially women and children," from skid row to other areas of the
city.</TE>
<TE>   Those against her idea say their opposition is rooted in simple
math: The number of homeless people is greater than the number of
beds in the city.</TE>
<TE>   "I could probably bring 100 more people a day into my facility if
I had the capacity," said Larry Adamson, president and CEO of the
Midnight Mission. "We turn away people every day because we're full."</TE>
<TE>   According to estimates by experts, there are only 42,200 shelter
beds to accommodate 74,000 homeless people in Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   Those numbers do not move Perry.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what that means," Perry said. "I've been hearing
that for years. I'm not even sure if that's accurate."</TE>
<TE>   Activists such as Pete White say the numbers are solid and can be
seen on the streets on any given night.</TE>
<TE>   "My organization does not support people sleeping and living on
the street," White said. "We also do not support ... moving people
off the sidewalk until there's some clear alternative."</TE>
<TE>   A wave of California cities passed such laws in the 1990s,
beginning with Santa Ana in 1992. The ordinances reflect a nationwide
pattern, Foscarinis said. Recently Florida cities such as Orlando,
Tampa and St. Petersburg have passed them.</TE>
<TE>   "What's driving it is that there've been increasing numbers of
people on the street," she said. "Criminalization is a misguided
effort to respond to the problem."</TE>
<TE>   But supporters say the ordinances are needed.</TE>
<TE>   In Palmdale, sheriff's deputies pressed for the law, arguing that
it would be "one more tool" to deal with a small band of
trouble-making transients.</TE>
<TE>   In the town's empty lots, transients set up encampments, warming
themselves by fires and drinking. Nearby businesses complain that
they block doorways and intimidate customers with aggressive
panhandling.</TE>
<TE>   "With the ones I've encountered on the street, they don't want the
assistance," said Sgt. Kyle Bistline of the Los Angeles County
sheriff's Palmdale office. "We have tried and they refuse it. In
fact, several of them tell us, 'I have family living right here, but
as long as I continue to do drugs and alcohol, I can't live there.' "</TE>
<TE>   The new law in Palmdale prohibits camping or sleeping in parked
cars and on public streets, sidewalks or other property accessible to
the public.</TE>
<TE>   The department finds little credence in the argument that the law
will endanger women and children, or teenagers who are homeless.</TE>
<TE>   "There are enough shelters," Bistline said.</TE>
<TE>   "My experience in 3 1/2 years here," she said: "The authentic
homeless or the truly homeless seek out organizations."</TE>
<TE>   Social service providers see a different Antelope Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Sorensen, who represents Antelope Valley on the advisory board
for the authority for services to the homeless, said service
providers often send the poor to the high desert because they believe
the area has more housing and lower rents.</TE>
<TE>   But instead of finding affordable housing, many families end up
tapping resources "that were designed for much fewer people given our
lower population."</TE>
<TE>   Deputies will use discretion in enforcing the law, which went into
effect this month, Bistline said.</TE>
<TE>   That fact, opponents say, leaves the door open for selective
enforcement that often discriminates against homeless people. They
offer the example of a person with a backpack sitting on a park
bench.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're the son of the mayor, you're not likely to be hassled,"
said Robert Myers, vice president of the National Lawyers Guild. "If
you're homeless, they might assume that you're lodging."</TE>
<TE>   Laws outlawing camping by the homeless have been both upheld and
rejected by the courts, depending on the laws' provisions, so it's
impossible to predict how a measure in Los Angeles might fare if
challenged.</TE>
<TE>   Ramona Ripston of the ACLU said the organization "wants to see
what's going to happen to this motion" by Perry. "We are watching
it."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the American Civil Liberties Union reached an agreement
with the LAPD over the department's treatment of the homeless: Police
agreed not to stop homeless people without probable cause, or to
force them to move when they are merely standing on the sidewalk.</TE>

<HD>TV Personality Was All Ears for Show on Bunny Museum</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Candace Frazee of Pasadena told me that TV personality John
Walsh ("America's Most Wanted") interviewed her about her Bunny
Museum, I feared some misfortune had befallen the shrine.</LD>
<LD>   Had a bad guy made off with some of her bunny items? I was
especially worried about the Elvis-shaped water pitcher with a rabbit
head that's labeled "Elvis Parsley."</LD>
<LD>   But, no. Walsh has a new TV talk show, and he's trying to lighten
up a bit. So he summoned Frazee for a feature on her house / museum,
which is full of everything from bunny floor mats and bunny lamps to
a bunny toilet seat and bunny toilet brush (admission is free, but
appointments at [626] 798-8848 are required).</LD>
<TE>   Walsh's invitation was the biggest honor for the Bunny Museum
since it was saluted by the Guinness Book of Records for its 8,500
items.</TE>
<TE>   Incidentally, Frazee maintains that the number is too low,
pointing out that Guinness counts sets, such as bunny salt and pepper
shakers, as one item. Then again you can't blame Guinness. Companies
are nervous about accounting scandals these days.</TE>
<TE>   Whoops, the bunny anecdotes are multiplying: Aside from Frazee,
Walsh also interviewed collectors of rats, M&amp;Ms, chickens, mustard
and vacuum cleaners on his show. Sounds like a messy assemblage.</TE>
<TE>   "According to those in the production crew," Frazee said, "I was
the most normal of the collectors."</TE>
<TE>   Now an item for "Ripley's Believe It or Not!": "My husband looks
much younger than he really is, but when he bought a bottle of wine I
was shocked to learn his true age," joked Lela Rodriguez of Arcadia.</TE>
<TE>   For more than a year, readers have been sending me Ralphs grocery
receipts that give the buyers of alcoholic beverages an identical
birth date in the Middle Ages (see accompanying). Shouldn't the
problem be fixable in the 21st century?</TE>
<TE>   Swelling with pride? John O'Donnell of South El Monte sent along a
code enforcement report that seemed to indicate that housing is
becoming more crowded than ever (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   On the road: A billboard in Arizona prompted Jim Barton of Van
Nuys to observe: "The most useful club for this golf course?
Definitely the sand wedge" (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Cold enough for you? This week has been so chilly that it would
almost make a comfortable vacation spot for the title character who
invades the Southland in one of R. L. Stine's "Goosebumps" novels
(see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: My colleague Daniel Yi spotted a restaurant sign in
Gardena that said: "No shirt. No shoes. No dogs. No service." What's
the use of going inside?</TE>

<HD>Managers Get Raises Despite Budget Woes</HD>
<DH>A taxpayers group is questioning pay increases for public
employees in Ventura County at a time when services are being cut.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Polakovic</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Board of Supervisors has approved pay increases for hundreds of
top managers the county hopes to retain during difficult economic
times.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the increases occurred as county jobs and services are being
cut to reconcile huge budget deficits. The board recently decided
against funding an anti-gang unit and eliminated 70 vacant positions
to save nearly $4 million in salaries.</LD>
<LD>   The pay increases prompted critics to question whether the board
is managing public funds wisely. Freezes on wages or cuts in travel
and memberships make better fiscal sense at the moment, said Jere
Robings, founder of the Ventura County Alliance of Taxpayers.</LD>
<TE>   "At a time when the county is slowly going broke, they give out
lucrative pay raises. It sure sends a mixed signal," Robings said.</TE>
<TE>   Counties are reckoning with dramatic belt-tightening as a state
budget deficit, projected to reach $30 billion, trickles down to the
local level.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, the board approved a 3% across-the-board
cost-of-living increase for 732 managers employed by the county.</TE>
<TE>   The raises take effective in March and will cost $414,075 through
July and $1.66 million in the next fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   The board also approved so-called market-based average raises for
many management positions. That is a separate raise that employees
are eligible to receive to ensure salaries are comparable to those in
the private sector.</TE>
<TE>   Those raises would average 2% this fiscal year and 7.2% next year,
although how much if any an employee receives is based on merit.</TE>
<TE>   In a Dec. 10 letter to the board, county Human Resources Director
Barbara A. Journet said "providing any type of salary adjustment
during these times of financial uncertainty is extremely sensitive,
however, the county must constantly balance the financial
difficulties of paying for services and operational difficulties of
delivering the services. Paying a fair and competitive wage helps
assure that we have a competent team to deliver those services even
in the most difficult of times."</TE>
<TE>   Journet said the raises are in line with increases recently
granted to federal workers. She said contracts recently negotiated
with four unions representing other Ventura County workers included
pay raises similar to those the managers will receive.</TE>
<TE>   For example, in labor agreements reached earlier this year with
thousands of county workers, including janitors, clerical workers,
engineers, deputies and probation officers, the board granted
cost-of-living raises ranging from 2.5% to 6.5% annually over the
next three years. Market-based adjustments for those employees ranged
from 2% to 5%.</TE>
<TE>   Robings said service to the public should be the top priority and
pay raises subordinate. "They take the view that their needs come
first, and if there's anything left, they'll provide the service."</TE>

<HD>Managers Given Raises Despite Budget Shortfall</HD>
<DH>A taxpayers group is questioning pay increases for public
employees in Ventura County at a time when services are being cut.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Board of Supervisors has approved pay increases for hundreds of
top managers the county hopes to retain during difficult economic
times.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the increases occurred as county jobs and services are being
cut to reconcile huge budget deficits.</LD>
<LD>   The board recently decided against funding an anti-gang unit and
eliminated 70 vacant positions to save nearly $4 million in salaries.</LD>
<TE>   The pay increases prompted critics to question whether the board
is managing public funds wisely.</TE>
<TE>   Freezes on wages or cuts in travel and memberships make better
fiscal sense at the moment, said Jere Robings, founder of the Ventura
County Alliance of Taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   "At a time when the county is slowly going broke, they give out
lucrative pay raises. It sure sends a mixed signal," Robings said.</TE>
<TE>   Counties are reckoning with dramatic belt-tightening as a state
budget deficit, projected to reach $30 billion, trickles down to the
local level. Earlier this month, the board approved a 3%
across-the-board cost-of-living increase for 732 managers employed by
the county. The raises are effective next March and will cost
$414,075 through July and $1.66 million in the next fiscal year. The
board also approved so-called market-based average raises for many
management positions.</TE>
<TE>   That is a separate pay hike employees are eligible to receive to
ensure salaries are comparable to those in the private sector.</TE>
<TE>   Those raises would average 2% this fiscal year and 7.2% next year,
although how much if any an employee receives is based on merit.</TE>
<TE>   In a Dec. 10 letter to the board, county Human Resources Director
Barbara A. Journet said "providing any type of salary adjustment
during these times of financial uncertainty is extremely sensitive,
however, the county must constantly balance the financial
difficulties of paying for services and operational difficulties of
delivering the services. Paying a fair and competitive wage helps
assure that we have a competent team to deliver those services even
in the most difficult of times."</TE>
<TE>   Journet said the raises are in line with increases recently
granted to federal workers. She said contracts recently negotiated
with four unions representing other Ventura County workers included
pay raises similar to those the managers will receive.</TE>
<TE>   For example, in labor agreements reached earlier this year with
thousands of county workers, including janitors, clerical workers,
engineers, deputies and probation officers, the board granted
cost-of-living raises ranging between 2.5% and 6.5% annually over the
next three years. Market-based adjustments for those employees ranged
from 2% to 5%.</TE>
<TE>   Robings said service to the public should be the top priority and
pay raises subordinate. "They take the view that their needs come
first, and if there's anything left, they'll provide the service."</TE>

<HD>Seniors' Health Insurance Comes at Big Premium</HD>
<DH>Social service agencies are helping the county's elderly
understand changes in medical coverage and deal with increases in
costs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Catherine Saillant</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lourdes and Fidel Ramirez knew their medical costs were going up.
They just didn't know by how much.</LD>
<LD>   The Oxnard couple recently got the painful answer: a lot.</LD>
<LD>   Lourdes, 66, will pay $300 a month for her Medicare HMO premium
next year, about double the current cost.</LD>
<TE>   And she and her 63-year-old husband, disabled for a year, will
have to buy a separate health-care policy for him.</TE>
<TE>   Together they expect to pay $600 a month starting in January,
compared with their current $130 bill. With a fixed income of about
$21,000 a year, it's a daunting increase.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to die early because we are worrying so much," Fidel
joked. "What can we do?"</TE>
<TE>   The Ramirezes were among 50 seniors who attended an Oxnard session
outlining changes to Medicare and Medicare HMOs for 2003. Ventura
County Area Agency on Aging has been holding workshops across the
county to prepare seniors for significant rate hikes.</TE>
<TE>   Health-care costs have been rising sharply in recent years because
of expensive new prescription drugs and diagnostic tests. Nationwide,
employers were expecting rate hikes of 20% or more in 2003, according
to a UCLA survey in June.</TE>
<TE>   Medicare covers about 39 million senior citizens and disabled
people. They will be among the hardest hit by cost increases because
many are retired and on fixed incomes.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, costs for some Medicare HMOs will more than
double.</TE>
<TE>   Premiums for Blue Cross plans, for instance, will rise from $40 a
month to $85. Secure Horizons is increasing to $65, compared with the
current $50-a-month charge. Kaiser's plan will change the least, but
the group is not enrolling any new members until April 1, said
Katharine Raley of the Area Agency on Aging.</TE>
<TE>   Insurers are also raising co-payments and deductibles and reducing
the level of benefits in many plans, Raley said. She told
participants to shop carefully. It may make sense, for instance, for
some seniors to consider a Medicare supplemental insurance plan,
called a Medigap policy, which typically has higher premiums but no
co-payments or deductibles, Raley said.</TE>
<TE>   "You need to see how many services you think you will need and
whether an HMO or a Medigap policy is the best choice," Raley said.
"You are going to be paying a lot more in hidden costs in an HMO than
you have in the past."</TE>
<TE>   There are also many ways to cut the cost of prescription drugs,
she said. Medicare does not cover medications, and private insurers
usually limit what they will pay for.</TE>
<TE>   But California allows Medicare recipients to purchase
prescriptions that are listed on the state's formulary at Medi-Cal
prices, as much as 40% lower than retail. Costco offers competitive
prices and does not require membership for its pharmacy, Raley said.</TE>
<TE>   Some pharmaceutical companies offer steep discounts to low-income
seniors. And bargains can be found on the Internet -- as long as
consumers make sure the company they are dealing with is legitimate
and offers drugs that are FDA-approved, Raley said. Prescriptions
filled in Canada cost up to 70% less, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Little House, a senior center in Ojai, can help find credible
discounts. Audrey Brooks runs the volunteer program and can be
reached at 640-3684.</TE>
<TE>   The county's Health Insurance Counseling and Advocacy Program also
offers free information and assistance to those with Medicare,
Medicare HMOs, Medigap policies and long-term insurance. To make an
appointment, call 477-7310.</TE>
<TE>   Several seniors who attended Raley's Oxnard session said the
information was useful. They said they would be able to save a few
dollars or at least reduce cost increases.</TE>
<TE>   But others were still anxious.</TE>
<TE>   "So much for the golden years," fretted one woman as she headed
out the door.</TE>

<HD>Radio Offers Grim Drama on 'El Norte'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anna Gorman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mexico's newest radio drama begins with a scene of dozens of
unemployed day laborers, standing on Lankershim Boulevard in the San
Fernando Valley, drinking coffee and waiting for work.</LD>
<LD>   When a man drives up looking for two workers, several run toward
him and clamor for jobs. "Only two men, not 20!" the man shouts in
heavily accented Spanish. "Out of my car or I'll call the police!"</LD>
<LD>   The new, 30-part radionovela, produced by the Mexican government,
attempts to distill the hopes and hardships of Mexican immigrants
living in California. The characters are poor and everyday people,
not usually the stuff of mass-media fiction. They are undocumented
workers, who often struggle with life in Los Angeles -- from a
character who contracts HIV to another who goes days without a job.</LD>
<TE>   The series was adapted from a novel written by Enrique Romero
Moreno, a former protection officer at the Mexican Consulate in Los
Angeles. Government officials said the radio drama is not designed to
slow or stop Mexicans crossing the border, but to give immigrants an
unvarnished view of the hardships of life in the north.</TE>
<TE>   "People have visions that it's a matter of taking the bus,
crossing the border, finding a good job and sending money back home,"
said Candido Morales, who heads President Vicente Fox's new Institute
for Mexicans Abroad. "But there are a lot of incidents that happen
along the way. Some are positive and some are negative."</TE>
<TE>   Morales said the government wants to prepare Mexicans for the fact
that life in the U.S. is not always glorious and that immigrants are
not going to immediately become rich.</TE>
<TE>   Laura Diaz de Leon of the government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs
was more blunt. "The American dream isn't so much of a dream," Diaz
said. "The reality is the opposite."</TE>
<TE>   But Morales realizes that a radio series will not keep his
countrymen south of the border. "The Mexican government has to
stimulate the economy to create jobs in Mexico that pay well so
people don't have a need to go across the border," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The radio program is airing this month in Mexican states with
large numbers of immigrants. Broadcasters are hoping to reach natives
who haven't made the trek across the border, as well as those who
live in the U.S. but are home for Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   Radio Bilingue, a public radio network based in Fresno, plans to
bring the Spanish-language radionovela to California in January on
stations that reach from the San Joaquin Valley to El Centro.</TE>
<TE>   Based on Experiences</TE>
<TE>   Romero said he simply told the stories of immigrants he met while
working in Los Angeles. He named the novel "Hard Tortillas, not Even
Enough for Beans," a Mexican saying that means life is hard.</TE>
<TE>   One expert on cross-border relations -- Konane Martinez, a
visiting fellow at UC San Diego's Center for Comparative Immigration
Studies -- said she believes Mexico would never grow too aggressive
with such cross-cultural critiques because its economy depends too
much on immigrants and the money they send home.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Mexican political leaders are more intent on using such
programming to show empathy for their compatriots abroad, many of
whom are voters, Martinez said.</TE>
<TE>   "For the government, this is all fairly new," Martinez said.
"There has been a movement lately, trying to show a little more
support, especially health-wise, and trying to educate them on the
dangers of crossing the border."</TE>
<TE>   Among the issues presented in "Hard Tortillas" are AIDS and drug
abuse, with admonitions to use condoms, for instance. Workers injured
on the job are also informed of their right to health care in the
U.S. During the radio drama, the characters gradually learn the
rights and responsibilities they have while living in America.</TE>
<TE>   In one scene, a longtime day laborer urges some of the new workers
to ask for at least $40 a day. But another responds that the dignity
gained in demanding more pay won't put food on the table. The
laborers come across several patrones who refuse to pay fair wages,
but they also meet generous employers who offer good pay, warm meals
and beds for the night.</TE>
<TE>   Another poignant tale is that of one Mexican family who prepare
for their father to return for Christmas. They bathe in the river and
wait outside their adobe home to greet him. But the holiday passes
without any news. The man has died in Los Angeles, but his family is
left in the dark because he carried no identification.</TE>
<TE>   Romero said he believes his book and the radio program tell the
story of every immigrant. "When someone is reading the book, they are
reading about their cousin, their brother, their mother, their
sister."</TE>
<TE>   The messages are as important for urban workers in Los Angeles as
they are for rural employees in the Central Valley, said Radio
Bilingue regional manager Guadalupe Carrasco. And serial drama is an
ideal way to tell the story, Carrasco said, because it touches
Mexicans close to their cultural roots.</TE>
<TE>   First developed in Cuba in the 1930s, radionovelas brought
families together to listen to the daily escapades of the soap opera
stars. Serial radio dramas died out in the 1950s as they moved to TV
and became prime-time telenovelas. But in recent years, radionovelas
have made a comeback in Mexico, this time often with educational or
health themes.</TE>
<TE>   Johns Hopkins University has produced about 50 radio soap operas
that have aired in Mexico and throughout the world, addressing such
topics as family planning and communicable diseases. Professor
Phyllis Piotrow, who founded the public health school's Center for
Communication Programs, said the dramas reach people who may not get
the information any other way.</TE>
<TE>   Surveys conducted by Piotrow's center in several African and South
American nations show that those who listen to such dramas are more
likely to change their behavior than those who don't. But the key is
to make the soap opera truly gripping, she said, adding: "People love
stories about other people."</TE>
<TE>   When Romero, 44, sat down one night and started jotting down his
experiences from his days at the Los Angeles consulate, he had no
idea his message would eventually be heard by so many people on both
sides of the border.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Michoacan, Mexico, Romero was 11 when his family moved
legally to the San Fernando Valley. Romero received a bachelor's
degree in international relations in Mexico and began a career with
the Mexican Consulate as a volunteer.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like Superman when they offered me a job," said Romero,
who now works at the Mexican Consulate in northern Guatemala. "I
thought I was going to solve all the problems. But they never end. I
felt powerless."</TE>
<TE>   Common Characters</TE>
<TE>   Romero said writing the book helped him release his frustrations
about the lives of the immigrants, many stuck in low-wage jobs with
little chance of moving up. Each of his characters is a prototype of
dozens more, he said. There's Tururu, a college graduate; Coras, who
is always begging for quarters, and Yes Yes, who knows just one
English word.</TE>
<TE>   Romero wrote an hour each day until he had 479 pages, then
published the paperback himself. Hoping to get a raise from the
consulate, he sent one of the 2,000 copies to his office
headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   "The dreams, illusions and ambitions already are things of the
past," he wrote in the opening paragraph of "Hard Tortillas." "Today
it is an uncertain path, they do not know where they are going to end
up."</TE>
<TE>   Production of "Hard Tortillas" began last January, when Olga
Duron, a producer with Radio Educacion, traveled to Los Angeles with
Romero to visit the sites mentioned in the book. They recorded sounds
at bars, soccer fields, jails, churches and hospitals. "We couldn't
reproduce something we hadn't seen," said Duron, noting that
Spanglish was especially hard to replicate.</TE>
<TE>   In re-creating scenes from the book, Duron said she tried to
remain faithful to the nostalgia many Mexican workers living in the
U.S. feel for home.</TE>
<TE>   Each episode begins with the chorus of a song by the popular
group, Los Tigres del Norte: "Like an eagle in flight ... I have
spent my life exploring other lands to give my children a better
tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Romero, who is married and has three children, said the voices in
the radionovela sound just as he had imagined. He has already started
a second book, "Esta es la Tostada."</TE>
<TE>   Romero said that he feels a strong bond with all Mexicans who have
spent time in the U.S., no matter their legal status.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not whether you have papers or a green card or U.S.
citizenship," he said. "We come from the same place."</TE>

<HD>A Disneyland Ride for Workers Only</HD>
<DH>The Segway, a $4,950 self-balancing scooter, gets employees
around faster and inspires envy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kimi Yoshino</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tourists can't ride one of the most popular attractions at
Disneyland. It's for employees only.</LD>
<LD>   But plenty of visitors are getting their first close look at the
Segway, a self-balancing electric scooter touted as an engineering
marvel and as the machine that will revolutionize human transport.</LD>
<LD>   The battery-operated Segway, which looks more like a manual
lawnmower than a scooter, is equipped with five gyroscopes and senses
body movements so subtle that the rider practically has to only think
about moving to make it go forward or backward or come to a halt.</LD>
<TE>   Disney is one of several companies around the country to buy or
use the Segways on a trial basis.</TE>
<TE>   Park executives ride them from their offices to Downtown Disney,
California Adventure and Disneyland -- though they follow a
designated path, because the scooter's futuristic design clashes with
the themes in Frontierland and Adventureland. And Disneyland
greeters, who hand out park maps and answer questions, are seen
whizzing around Tomorrowland, where the scooters appear in the show
inside the Innoventions attraction.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw a whole show on that," said Ruth Fausett of San Diego as
she watched greeter Luther Schmidt maneuver his Segway. "I wouldn't
mind having one."</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, Segways were available only to companies and not
for individual sale. But last month, Segway launched its partnership
with Amazon.com, and the $4,950 scooter quickly made its way onto
Christmas gift lists for the tech-savvy or people who have
everything.</TE>
<TE>   They can be bought only online through Amazon and won't be shipped
until March.</TE>
<TE>   "The novelty factor is incredible," said Schmidt, one of 50
Disneyland employees trained on the Segway.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people have a lot of questions. They're surprised it
works. They want to know how fast it goes, how much it costs, where
they can get one."</TE>
<TE>   The Segway travels up to about 12.5 mph -- three times normal
walking speed -- with a battery life of 11 to 15 miles, depending on
the terrain and number of stops and starts.</TE>
<TE>   Operating the Segway, which feels a bit like standing on a
fast-moving walkway, is easier than riding a bike or skateboard,
Schmidt said.</TE>
<TE>   "T" Irby, Disneyland's senior vice president of resort support,
attractions, operations and entertainment, said one of the challenges
was trying to figure out how and where to use Segway.</TE>
<TE>   "All the execs that have seen me operating on it, now they want
one," Irby said. "I love it. It's the best thing for me. I keep mine
parked in my office. I cruise right through the park."</TE>
<TE>   When he's done, he rides it into his building, up the elevator and
into his office, where it can be plugged into a standard outlet for
charging.</TE>
<TE>   Irby said Disney is "rapidly approaching the decision to buy" and
has suggested some improvements to Segway designers, including the
addition of a horn and light.</TE>
<TE>   The hike into the park can be a hassle, Irby said, but with his
Segway, he is more likely to go check on problems. And he never has
to worry about parking.</TE>
<TE>   Several cities, including Chicago and Seattle, have bought Segways
for meter reading and parking enforcement, said Segway spokeswoman
Carla Vallone. And the U.S. Postal Service is testing Segways in six
cities.</TE>
<TE>   So far, 33 states, including California, have passed laws allowing
the use of Segways on sidewalks, and more states are considering
legislation.</TE>

<HD>County on Track to Meet U.S. Deadline to Cut Air Pollution</HD>
<DH>Agency reports that the region had only one day of
unhealthful smog in all of 2002.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Polakovic</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Skies over Ventura County were remarkably smog-free this year as
officials reported one of the cleanest years on record.</LD>
<LD>   With the summer smog season long over, the Ventura County Air
Pollution Control District announced recently that only one day of
unhealthful air pollution occurred this year. That happened on Sept.
24 in Ojai, when ozone reached a peak concentration of 132 parts per
billion, 10% higher than the federal health limit.</LD>
<LD>   For the county, it signals that a decades-long fight for clean air
is making dramatic progress.</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, the county appears to have met one key federal air quality
benchmark, the one-hour ozone standard, which prohibits more than 120
ppb of ozone in any one-hour period at any location in the county.</TE>
<TE>   "We continue to see improvements in our air quality," said Michael
Villegas, the county's air pollution control officer. "We've gone
from 122 days [exceeding] the federal ozone standard in 1974 to only
one this year."</TE>
<TE>   That means Ventura County, once one of the smoggiest counties in
the nation, is on schedule to achieve healthful air by November 2005,
the deadline established under the federal Clean Air Act.</TE>
<TE>   Villegas said that while the county technically already meets that
cleanup standard, he wants to see a couple more years of low smog
before he asks the EPA to classify the county as an "attainment"
area.</TE>
<TE>   Ozone is fickle, fluctuating greatly from year to year depending
on weather. While ozone high in the atmosphere protects the Earth
from harmful ultraviolet radiation, near the surface it is a powerful
lung irritant and the main ingredient in smog. It can cause
headaches, coughing and dizziness, and long-term exposure can lead to
permanent loss of lung function.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the progress, the county continues to violate other smog
standards designed to protect people's health.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the county violated the more stringent California
smog standard 23 days this year, mostly in Simi Valley and Ojai. Smog
collects in those cities because emissions generated along the coast
are blown inland by sea breezes.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say additional cleanup measures are planned in coming
years to move the county into compliance with the higher standards.</TE>

<HD>Friction With Parents Halts Program</HD>
<DH>East L.A. YMCA has disbanded its swim team, citing
difficulty with adults, who say they had the right to question staff
decision.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Julie Tamaki</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the annals of youth sports, unruly parents have raged at hockey,
Little League and soccer games. But swim meets?</LD>
<LD>   At a YMCA in Boyle Heights, gym officials have temporarily
disbanded a swim team, saying that some swimmers' parents verbally
abused or quarreled with staff members about everything from
scheduling to uniform logos.</LD>
<LD>   "Believe me, it was awful," said Mike Castillo, executive director
of the Weingart East Los Angeles YMCA. "I don't pay my staff enough
to get that attitude from the parents. The language was just
incredible."</LD>
<TE>   Shortly after he arrived at the East Los Angeles YMCA five years
ago, Castillo said, he noticed swim-team parents displaying what he
described as a sense of ownership about the pool. He said both his
early decision to transform a swim team hangout into a child-care
area and a more recent one to push back practice times for the 15 to
17 swimmers triggered complaints from parents.</TE>
<TE>   Some parents deny that anyone used foul language in disputes with
him or his staff or raised their voices around the swimming pool.
Others say a few parents did step over the line, cursing at coaches.</TE>
<TE>   "Two or three parents got mad at the coaches for anything," said
Sylvia Garcia, the mother of four team members.</TE>
<TE>   The parents say Castillo and his employees mishandled the
situation by disbanding the team, known as the East Los Angeles
Sharks, instead of taking action against a few boors. "They are
taking the easiest option," said Lydia Joya, the mother of a
13-year-old swimmer. "The kids are the ones who are paying."</TE>
<TE>   And parents contend that they had the right to take issue with
some of the staff's decisions. Kayla Mejia, whose 12-year-old
daughter was on the team, said the staff allowed the situation to
deteriorate.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo said the tension between staff members and parents had
reached a point where something drastic had to be done to ensure that
the aquatics programs in this working-class community remained
enjoyable. After meeting with parents countless times, he said, it
was time to pull the plug.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Time out. We need to put this to bed for a couple of
months,' " Castillo said.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo said he intends to restart the team next month, with
membership by invitation. Ten new youngsters, he added, are
interested in joining the revamped team.</TE>
<TE>   Anxious swimmers and parents say they have been in limbo since the
team was dissolved Dec. 1. With no coach to train them, the
youngsters have been going to the YMCA each weekday evening and
practicing on their own.</TE>
<TE>   Mejia said she and other parents worry that their youngsters will
miss out on qualifying competitions in the two leagues they compete
in because they are without a coach. Applications for most meets are
due weeks in advance, she said, and parents don't know which swimmers
will be invited to rejoin the team.</TE>
<TE>   A YMCA coach from Gardena agreed to sit in as coach for the Boyle
Heights swimmers, Castillo said, so that they could compete at a
recent meet sponsored by the Westchester YMCA.</TE>
<TE>   Aimee Cuellar, 16, a member of the team for three years, sized up
the situation this way: "They have tried to work with us and we have
tried to work with them. It's just that there's no respect for each
other."</TE>
<TE>   Swim teams have "always been a big problem," according to
Castillo. His staff, he said, must balance the team's competitive
ambitions and training needs with the YMCA's larger goal of teaching
people to swim.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo acknowledged that he ruffled feathers by transforming a
space that the swimmers and their parents used as a hangout into a
child-care area. The program allows parents to have YMCA staff and
volunteers watch their youngsters for free while they work out.
Castillo said some swim-team parents still complain about the change.</TE>
<TE>   Another decision, to move back the swim team's two-hour weekday
practices from 5 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., also made some parents unhappy,
according to staff members. Castillo said the change allowed
youngsters and seniors, who are not part of the team, to enjoy
earlier lessons and recreational swims.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant coach Skye Conant said some parents responded rudely to
her requests that they help time swimmers at meets, and their
attitudes were spilling over to their children.</TE>
<TE>   "I had one kid who did not want to respect my decisions," Conant
said. "He would want to kick when he was supposed to pull. He tried
to make me feel like I didn't know what I was doing."</TE>
<TE>   Parents say that in some cases the team's coaches took the
complaints too personally, and they say the coaches and the gym's
aquatics coordinator, Elizabeth Nevarez, failed to communicate with
them.</TE>
<TE>   Mejia and her mother, Teresa Marquez, said they tried to be
helpful by taking the lead on ordering new uniforms. The majority of
the team's families, they say, had settled on navy blue uniforms with
a shark logo.</TE>
<TE>   They say Nevarez and head coach Mario Mazariegos nixed their plans
and instead ordered traditional kelly green uniforms with a different
shark logo. Nevarez said not all the parents were happy with the
color change so she left it to Mazariegos to order the uniforms.</TE>
<TE>   Some parents have begun looking for other swim teams for their
children, but cite higher fees, longer distances and local pride as
issues.</TE>
<TE>   "My granddaughter wants to represent East Los Angeles," said
Marquez. "Not Gardena, Commerce, Montebello or Pasadena."</TE>

<HD>Town Is Going, Going ...</HD>
<DH>Bidding on EBay for Bridgeville has topped $1.6 million,
but then it comes with a backhoe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lee Romney</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Selling a town isn't easy.</LD>
<LD>   When the Lapple family tried to hawk the little Humboldt County
hamlet of Bridgeville through conventional real estate channels, they
barely got a bite. So the Lapples turned to the Internet, and now, to
the disbelief of neighboring residents, the price for the
80-plus-acre community is soaring.</LD>
<LD>   On Christmas Day, last-minute holiday shoppers from as far away as
Germany sent the bid price above $1.6 million from just $475,000 a
day earlier. With the electronic auction due to run through Friday,
Edward and Elizabeth Lapple, the brother and sister whose family has
owned the unincorporated town since 1972, are giddily hoping for a
high bid of as much as $3 million.</LD>
<TE>   "Bridgeville is a beautiful little town out in the middle of the
redwoods," said Elizabeth Lapple, who lives down the road in in
Fortuna.</TE>
<TE>   But for some neighbors, the outside interest in the rustic
one-time timber enclave 260 miles north of San Francisco is nothing
short of a crack-up.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously they haven't traipsed to Bridgeville lately," said
Lauren Shuman, who with her husband operates a cattle ranch on the
outskirts of town. "We're all clutching our sides and rolling around
on the ground. It's hysterical."</TE>
<TE>   For years, Lapple and her brother, Edward Lapple of Fillmore in
Ventura County, have made a living selling on EBay.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth offers antiques and glassware. Edward says he earns
about $15,000 a month selling electronic broadcast equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Bridgeville itself was listed on the online site Nov. 27, but the
asking price didn't take off until this week.</TE>
<TE>   High bidders, whose identities are made public only to the
sellers, have included a New York doctor, a Las Vegas accountant, a
Pennsylvania lawyer and a man from Germany, Elizabeth said.</TE>
<TE>   The Web site pitches the town as a buyer's fantasy.</TE>
<TE>   "It can be a private retreat, basking in the glory of the
redwoods," the EBay listing reads. "Or, with the proper development,
Bridgeville can become an economic powerhouse with the potential for
generating a large cash flow."</TE>
<TE>   It could even "function as a remarkable tax shelter," the town's
Realtor, Denise Stuart, said. "Ask your accountant."</TE>
<TE>   The property comes with a post office, a mile and a half of
frontage on the bucolic Van Duzen River, four cabins, 10 houses and a
cemetery. It also includes "a backhoe and generous supply of
maintenance parts" to help in the mighty fix-it task, the EBay
listing notes.</TE>
<TE>   With bidders' identities protected, residents and neighbors
logging on to the Web site Wednesday were left to wonder as their
town spiraled toward the clutches of some unknown mogul.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a post office and some shacks," Shuman said. "The pictures
[on EBay] look gorgeous, but it's a little different in virtual
reality here ....</TE>
<TE>   "I guess somebody's ego is so big that they're just thrilled about
owning a town," she said. "That's got to be it."</TE>
<TE>   Bridgeville was founded in 1865 by a trapper named Slaughter
Robinson. Its heyday was in the era when the timber industry boomed,
but for decades it has been little more than a collection of run-down
buildings. Today, only the post office operates as a going concern.</TE>
<TE>   Even the Lapples concede that owning the town, with its own water
system and street lights, requires lots of maintenance. The family
first sold Bridgeville in 1977 to the Pentacostal Faith Challengers,
a religious group that couldn't keep up with payments, Edward Lapple
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The county is kind of depressed as far as employment goes, so
it's difficult to find tenants who actually have a job," he said.
"It's basically logging, growing pot or fishing."</TE>
<TE>   Other towns have been bought whole. In 1990, amid much media
fanfare, actress Kim Basinger purchased the 1,800-acre town of
Braseltown, Ga., for $20 million, promising a remake that never
materialized.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the more modest Bridgeville transaction may mark the first
time an entire community has landed on the electronic auction block,
an EBay spokesman told Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen lots of houses and buildings and we've seen land and
we've seen bridges," said Chris Donlay, "but not a town."</TE>
<TE>   The Lapple family stumbled across Bridgeville three decades ago
when they spotted a classified ad in the Los Angeles Times. They
snatched up the town for $150,000 and moved north. The Lapples'
mother ran the store, but when she went blind, it closed and never
reopened.</TE>
<TE>   After she died, the children carried on, but the work was
time-consuming.</TE>
<TE>   "It really wasn't something I wanted to do," said Elizabeth
Lapple, who envisions it as a haven for recreational hunters and
fishermen. "I've got three other full-time businesses and four
children."</TE>
<TE>   To Elizabeth, all that's needed is a little attention. The town
could sustain a year-round RV park, she said, and the store and cafe
could be reopened.</TE>
<TE>   The town's postmaster, Rose Clarke, thinks Bridgeville would make
a great location for a bed and breakfast.</TE>
<TE>   "It's gorgeous out here -- the river and the bridge -- and it's so
quiet," she said.</TE>

<HD>Time to Gather Round the Tree</HD>
<DH>Protester celebrates Christmas with presents delivered by
his supporters. Decorations on perch add a festive touch.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nestled like an ornament in the tree that has been his home for
nearly two months, John Quigley held to a family tradition and opened
a single Christmas present. It was a much-welcome gift from the tree
sitter's friends: a super-bright headlamp along with a book about
naturalist John Muir.</LD>
<LD>   "The idea was that the headlamp would help me read the book,"
Quigley said Wednesday by walkie-talkie as he passed the holiday in
the old oak near Santa Clarita. He climbed up Nov. 1 to protest the
planned removal of the tree to make way for a wider road leading to a
new subdivision.</LD>
<LD>   On Christmas Day, the towering oak was an attraction like so many
Candy Cane Lanes, where residents go all out to decorate their homes
for the season. As cars slowly rolled by on Pico Canyon Road,
children pressed their noses against the windows to see the
42-year-old man who lives in a tree. Nearby, boys tried out new
remote-control cars on the shoulder of the road.</LD>
<TE>   The small encampment that has developed at the base of the tree
called "Old Glory" was decorated with colorful balls, tinsel and
lights. Stockings were hung with care on the chain-link fence
surrounding the tree.</TE>
<TE>   Some people dropped off cookies and casseroles, and employees of a
salon offered to give Quigley a haircut. One man brought several pots
of poinsettias.</TE>
<TE>   There was still some baked ziti left over from a Christmas Eve
dinner. Quigley's supporters had prepared the meal, which included
tamales, and ate it atop a patch of straw outside the fence.
Organizer Tom Barron said the supporters drank hot chocolate and took
part in a "corny" sing-a-long. Neighbors brought their relatives from
out of town to see the tree that has made news worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt like family," Barron said.</TE>
<TE>   The tree sitter from Pacific Palisades spent Christmas as he spent
Thanksgiving and pretty much all the other 53 days since he moved
into the oak: He took calls from reporters and shouted thanks to
sympathizers. A package from his mother waited for him on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Quigley said he would like to get to Washington, D.C., to see his
father, who is ill, and then return to his teaching job with the
Malibu Foundation for Environmental Education.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm definitely ready" to come down, he said. "I've been up here a
long time."</TE>
<TE>   He and fellow protesters had expected to have a plan to preserve
the tree by Christmas, but this week Los Angeles County engineers
rejected alternative designs for the road, saying they were unsafe.</TE>
<TE>   The building permit granted to developer John Laing Homes calls
for removal of the oak. County Supervisor Mike Antonovich has
advocated transplanting the 400-year-old tree to a nearby park, but
environmentalists fear it would not survive such a move.</TE>
<TE>   When Quigley climbs down, Jeff Johnson, a carpenter and
mountaineer from Santa Clarita, is ready to take his place in the
jury-rigged aerie of boards, buckets and American flags. The
protest's organizers would not say when Johnson would relieve
Quigley.</TE>
<TE>   Quigley said he plans to spend New Year's Eve in the tree and
continue to protest the plan to uproot it after he leaves its
branches.</TE>

<HD>He Sees 10-Mile Tunnel in O.C.'s Future</HD>
<DH>On his own time and dime, an engineer with a political
resume gets his traffic solution noticed.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bill Vardoulis of Corona del Mar freely admits he suffers from an
acute case of tunnel vision. For three years, the 64-year-old
mechanical engineer, former Irvine mayor and transportation wonk has
exhausted his spare time on a crusade to build the longest
subterranean highway in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   On paper, the $3.5-billion tunnel complex -- with room for trains,
trucks, cars and utilities -- runs for about 10 miles under the
rugged Cleveland National Forest. The tollway would provide a second
major link between Orange and Riverside counties, two fast-growing
neighbors struggling to improve the chronically congested freeway
that connects them.</LD>
<LD>   As Vardoulis sees it, digging is the only way out. Traffic, he
says, will eventually overwhelm the Riverside Freeway despite planned
widenings. Two-lane Ortega Highway in south Orange County is too
constrained by narrow canyons to expand. And a conventional highway
over the Santa Ana Mountains might be impractical from engineering
and environmental standpoints.</LD>
<TE>   "We can't rely on taxes or Caltrans anymore," says Vardoulis, who
is convinced that unless something is done in the next decade, the
region will find itself in gridlock. "We need to look outside the
box. If we don't, it's just a matter of time before businesses and
jobs leave the area or refuse to locate here."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1999, Vardoulis has used vacation time and put his personal
life on hold to take his idea to dozens of government officials, more
than 2,000 citizens and scores of community groups on both sides of
the county line. He's appeared at the posh Center Club near South
Coast Plaza and the McDonald's in Perris.</TE>
<TE>   His company -- BV Engineering, with offices in Irvine and Corona
-- has spent roughly $100,000 for promotions and preliminary studies.
He's even consulted tunnel experts at Kellogg, Brown and Root, the
construction arm of Halliburton Inc., a Dallas-based energy giant. He
describes his interest as a matter of public service rather than
private gain -- he doesn't see his company necessarily taking part in
the work should the tunnel be built.</TE>
<TE>   "Vardoulis is no fly-by-night guy. He is a very credible and
honest figure," said Jim Richards, a civil engineer for Kellogg,
Brown and Root, who has worked on tunnels for more than 20 years.
"This looks like a very viable project."</TE>
<TE>   The proposed corridor starts at Interstate 15 and Cajalco Road in
Riverside County, then dips under the steep eastern face of the Santa
Ana Mountains before surfacing 10 miles later on the other side of
the county line. It crosses Santiago Canyon Road and ends just east
of Irvine where the Laguna Freeway meets the Foothill toll road.</TE>
<TE>   Vardoulis envisions three 45-foot-diameter tunnels that would go
2,000 to 3,000 feet below the surface at their deepest. Two would
have roads in each direction, power lines, fiber optic cables and oil
pipelines. The third would have high-speed light-rail lines, a rail
conveyance for trucks and a 12-foot-diameter water pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   To keep potentially harmful exhaust out of the Cleveland National
Forest, the two automobile tunnels would have an elaborate system of
filters and ducts to clean emissions and release them into the air at
both ends.</TE>
<TE>   Financing, he says, could come from companies, the sale of bonds
to investors, tolls from drivers and fees paid by utilities and oil
companies. Preliminary estimates, he says, show that tolls and
utility payments alone could provide more than $300 million a year in
revenue, enough to pay off the project's debt eventually.</TE>
<TE>   Such a tunnel, Vardoulis says, will help accommodate the region's
growth and give Riverside County the second link to Orange County it
has always sought without disturbing the Cleveland National Forest.
Riverside County, with many of its residents heavily dependent on
jobs in Orange County, is expected to almost double its population to
3 million by 2020.</TE>
<TE>   With the defeat of a commercial airport at the former El Toro
Marine base, Vardoulis also says the tunnel will be needed to move
people and goods to and from Ontario International Airport, in San
Bernardino County, as well as cargo hubs planned for the former
Norton Air Force Base, also in that county, and March Air Reserve
Base in Riverside County.</TE>
<TE>   "This will not be easy," Vardoulis said. "It is going to be tough,
but it could solve many things all at once."</TE>
<TE>   The idea of building tunnels under the Cleveland National Forest
isn't new. The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California
proposed one in 1990 as a way to move water from Lake Mathews in
Riverside County. Almost eight years ago, the Southern California
Assn. of Governments included a tunnel option in the agency's
Regional Transportation Plan. Funding and political support have
lagged for both, however.</TE>
<TE>   Frustrated by a lack of regional transportation planning during
the 1990s, Vardoulis became interested in reviving the tunnel idea
after reviewing the water district's geological studies of the
region. Testing indicates that the formations under the Santa Ana
Mountains are mostly rock and contain little water -- good for
tunneling.</TE>
<TE>   But Vardoulis admits that he must overcome more than engineering
challenges to get the giant corridor built. Finding investors for
such an expensive undertaking will be a major hurdle. Toll roads have
fallen out of favor in the state Legislature, and many government
officials remain neutral, although they say an underground route
might be considered in the future, along with competing options.</TE>
<TE>   Local environmental groups, such as the Sierra Club, are
protective of the Cleveland National Forest and want to see all
remedies tried on the Riverside Freeway first. Polling by the Orange
County Transportation Authority indicates that most Orange County
residents feel similarly.</TE>
<TE>   "We support solutions for the 91 corridor and oppose anything
under or through the Cleveland National Forest," said Jay Matchett,
co-chairman of the Sierra Club's Santa Ana Mountains Task Force. "We
need better planning to solve the imbalance of housing and jobs
between Riverside and Orange counties."</TE>
<TE>   Another major factor is the politically influential Irvine Co.,
the largest real estate developer in Orange County. A major player in
transportation projects for 20 years, the Irvine Co. has been openly
skeptical of proposed routes through the forest, especially a tunnel.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, company officials fear they would have to pay
for road improvements because people would use the underground route
to head to jobs in north Irvine. The company is planning 17 million
square feet of office space there.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, the Irvine Co. proposed building a 10-mile highway
along a busy railroad right-of-way that parallels the Riverside
Freeway. It would run from Interstate 15 in Riverside County to the
Foothill toll road in northeast Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Other skeptics question the tunnel's cost, noting that it would
exhaust all the funds from Orange County's transportation sales tax
if the tunnel were a government project. Measure M, which was
approved by county voters, is a half-cent tax designed to raise $3.1
billion by the end of 2010.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea should be looked at, but it is going to take some deep
pockets to finance it," said Stan Oftelie, executive director of the
Orange County Business Council. "There are a number of serious
transportation problems right now. Other projects, such as light
rail, might provide more relief than a tunnel. It could become a
priority issue."</TE>
<TE>   But friends and colleagues of Vardoulis say that if anyone can get
the tunnel built, he can.</TE>
<TE>   Vardoulis has long worked on local transportation issues, both as
a government official and member of the Orange County chapter of the
Building Industry Assn. He was among the first toll road advocates in
the county and devised ways to finance the San Joaquin Hills,
Foothill and Eastern tollways.</TE>
<TE>   Vardoulis, with master's degrees in engineering and business
administration, was an Irvine councilman and mayor. He served on the
Irvine Transportation Commission and the precursor of the Orange
County Transportation Authority.</TE>
<TE>   In October, the board of the Municipal Water District of Orange
County endorsed the proposal and promised to urge OCTA, the Riverside
County Transportation Commission and the Metropolitan Water District
to support the idea.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now," Vardoulis said, "I am operating half on engineering
and half on hope. I wish there was a way to make everyone happy, but
that is very hard."</TE>

<HD>Architect's Plan: Durable yet Cheap Village in Afghanistan</HD>
<DH>Masum Azizi of Newport Beach needs financing for the
project, which Rep. Cox backs as ideal housing for war-torn country.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kimi Yoshino</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The top item on Newport Beach architect Masum Azizi's action list for
developing a housing village in Afghanistan is painfully obvious: "No
money. No project."</LD>
<LD>   That's the major roadblock for Azizi, who has spent the last year
devoted to a personal project and campaign -- designing the village,
presenting the plans to nonprofit organizations and lobbying
politicians in order to construct his "Village of Hope."</LD>
<LD>   In a few days, he hopes to come one step closer to construction of
the neighborhood, which would comprise low-income homes, schools and
mosques that can be built with adobe-like bricks made of local
materials.</LD>
<TE>   He will return on Jan. 1 to Kabul, to the country he left 25 years
ago, to seek the endorsement of Afghan President Hamid Karzai.</TE>
<TE>   His two-week trip will include meetings with some of Karzai's
Cabinet members and a visit to a possible site for the village near
Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   Azizi will deliver a letter to Karzai from Rep. Christopher Cox
(R-Newport Beach) urging the president's support and pledging Cox's
commitment to try to secure funding.</TE>
<TE>   "This is precisely the kind of initiative that the United States
needs in its project for the reconstruction of Afghanistan," Cox
said. "I am exceptionally impressed with the project. I have agreed
to take the lead in assisting Masum in getting clearance from the
government of Afghanistan and the government of the U.S. to go
forward."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. government has already committed money to help rebuild
Afghanistan. Those funds, Cox said, should be earmarked for
"well-thought-out projects such as this."</TE>
<TE>   Cox and Azizi hope the Afghanistan government will endorse the
village and donate the land.</TE>
<TE>   Signs are positive. Azizi has spoken with various officials,
including architect Wahid A. Ahad, engineering advisor to the
minister of Rural Rehabilitation and Development.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent e-mail, Ahad wrote: "We have spotted a proper location
for the pilot project.... You will be most welcome to visit Kabul ...
and we will be more than happy to help you in materializing your
dreams for the rehabilitation of the villages of Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   Azizi has a list of 2,000 masons, bricklayers and construction
workers ready to start building the homes, which are designed to
withstand earthquakes.</TE>
<TE>   After he has secured funding, Azizi said he plans to complete
plans and open a branch office in Kabul to manage construction.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to bring a community of people who have been
displaced as a result of seven years of war back to a community of
normal living," Azizi said. "These houses are not equipped with the
latest technology. They're not different from the houses people would
be able to afford themselves. We want to help them stand on their
feet and get on with their lives."</TE>
<TE>   They are durable but cheap, costing roughly $5,500 to build. Each
would house eight to 12 people.</TE>
<TE>   "It is designed for the indefinite future, as opposed to
quick-fix, modular housing projects which will collapse with the
first earthquake," Cox said. "It does not do violence to the culture
and traditions of Afghanistan. It's not a Wal-Mart-type housing
project air-dropped from the West."</TE>
<TE>   Both Azizi and Cox said they want to start building as soon as
possible because they continue to read of homeless children dying
from the cold.</TE>
<TE>   "There's such an urgent need for these houses," Azizi said. "We're
hoping that the sooner we start this project, the more lives we
save."</TE>

<HD>A Home for the Holiday</HD>
<DH>A free Christmas dinner in Thousand Oaks, started by a
Jewish temple in 1994, comforts those who might otherwise be lonely.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sandra Murillo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With their young children in Mexico, Christmas hasn't been the same
for Irma Santiago and Cristobal Juarez.</LD>
<LD>   For two years now, the Thousand Oaks couple have celebrated
Christmas, the most family-oriented of holidays, without much of
their family. They had planned on a quiet evening at home, because it
just wouldn't have felt right to have a loud, festive celebration
without their children.</LD>
<LD>   But then a friend told them about the annual Conejo Community
Holiday Dinner at Thousand Oaks High School, and the housekeeper and
gardener decided to give it a try.</LD>
<TE>   "We're always very sad this time of year not to be with our
family," said Santiago, 42, who left Mexico to earn money to send to
her children back home. "But these people were very good to us."</TE>
<TE>   Santiago was talking about the more than 100 volunteers who put
the event together.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the more than 300 people who showed up for the free
dinner were treated like special guests at a cozy restaurant. The
school cafeteria had been transformed into a Christmas eatery, with
multicolored stars hanging from the ceiling, handmade laminated place
mats and red tablecloths setting a festive scene.</TE>
<TE>   Once they got their turkey, mashed potatoes, vegetables, stuffing,
cranberry sauce and desserts, diners were helped to their tables by
volunteers such as Marissa Matthew, 17, who attends Agoura High
School.</TE>
<TE>   Marissa and the other local teenagers on hand Wednesday had very
specific instructions. They were to greet and mingle with guests.
Great care and attention was to be taken to ensure that no one was
eating alone. Diners should be helped to their tables when necessary.
The guests should be periodically asked if they needed anything.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a social thing," said Marissa, who has volunteered at the
Christmas dinner since eighth grade and this year was in charge of
finding high school volunteers. "You see people here who were here
the year before, and it's nice that they've come back and we get to
talk again."</TE>
<TE>   Visiting from Humboldt County, Richard Fichera, 64, whose shirt
proclaimed "Will dance for food!," and Jennifer Tom of Ventura,
sporting a Santa hat, were in the Christmas spirit. The friends and
avid swing-dancers had heard about the dinner at a local dance class.
They were grabbing a bite before heading to Santa Barbara for
dancing.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought it'd be a fun way to spend Christmas," Tom said. "It
brings those of us who can't enjoy our families and loved ones
together."</TE>
<TE>   The Christmas celebration began in 1994 when Donn Delson, a member
of Temple Adat Elohim in Thousand Oaks, thought it would be good if
he and his Jewish friends could provide a free dinner for area
Christians with no place to go on Christmas. Nine years and thousands
of warm plates later, the idea has spurred a new Christmas tradition
among many in Ventura County. The food is mostly donated, and the
high school donates use of its space.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Romano, 78, a retiree from Westlake Village, says he drops by
every year.</TE>
<TE>   It's nice, he said, to share a good meal with good people.</TE>
<TE>   "You got any vodka?" asked the silver-haired jokester when a
volunteer brought him some water.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I'm allowed to serve that," the teenager responded
politely.</TE>
<TE>   Romano said the food is great, although he avoids the mashed
potatoes and stuffing.</TE>
<TE>   "That stuff is all fattening," Romano said.</TE>
<TE>   Romano, who worked for General Motors for as long as he was
married -- 24 years -- said he has no family in the area. His only
son is in Chicago with Romano's ex-wife, and he doesn't hear from
them much. He comes to the dinner for the food and to meet new lady
friends.</TE>
<TE>   "Being single out here is pretty rough," he said. "If you find any
rich widows, let me know."</TE>
<TE>   The temple doesn't target any particular group for the dinner, but
the event generally draws senior citizens from throughout the county.
Local cab and bus services offer free rides to and from the dinner.</TE>
<TE>   A smattering of singles and families also attends.</TE>
<TE>   For the Alcaraz family of Oxnard, this was not the way they'd
envisioned spending Christmas. It's the first time the family has
been to "one of these types of events," said Alejandro Alcaraz, a
local farm worker.</TE>
<TE>   It's been a rough year for the family of five and they can't
afford the typical Christmas feast and presents. But they're grateful
for the meal and for the gifts that 10-year-old Maria and 12-year-old
Alejandra received.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really surprised by how wonderful everyone's been to us,"
Alejandro said. "They don't care who we are. We're all just together
as a family and as brothers."</TE>

<HD>Roadblocks to U.S. Adoptions</HD>
<DH>With tens of thousands of foreign kids being brought here,
cultural, bureaucratic barriers keep Mexican children from reaping
benefits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anna Gorman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TIJUANA</DL>
<LD>Roberto Lopez points out over the dusty yellow buildings of the
orphanage and says he wants American parents to adopt him so he can
live on "el otro lado," the other side. But Roberto, who has called
Casa de la Esperanza home for all but one of his 14 years, doesn't
have much hope that will ever happen.</LD>
<LD>   Despite a decade-long explosion of adoptions that has brought tens
of thousands of foreign-born children to the United States, cultural
and bureaucratic barriers have made it difficult for Mexican children
to benefit from the droves of U.S. parents looking to adopt abroad.</LD>
<LD>   The number of international adoptions in the United States jumped
from 6,472 in 1992 to more than 20,000 in fiscal year 2002, according
to U.S. State Department statistics on immigrant orphan visas. But
only 61 of the children adopted in 2002 have been from Mexico --
compared to 5,053 from China and 4,939 from Russia.</LD>
<TE>   Adoptions of Mexican children have been persistently low. There
were 73 orphan visas granted to Mexican children in 2001 and 106 in
2000. Adoption attorneys and agents cite various reasons for the low
numbers, including the Mexican government's reluctance to place
children abroad, the role of extended families in Mexico in caring
for their own and strict immigration reviews before visas are granted
to orphan children.</TE>
<TE>   Prospects for Mexican children finding homes in America may be on
the verge of improving, however, as the U.S. prepares to implement a
multinational treaty in 2004 that sets uniform guidelines and
procedures for adoption.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican authorities say they have been cautious about placing
children in the United States, in part, because it has moved so
slowly in implementing the Hague Convention on Intercountry
Adoptions. The U.S. signed the treaty in 1993, but it was not
approved by the House and Senate until 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Now various agencies are haggling to determine how to apply the
treaty on U.S. soil. Having the rules in place, presumably in 2004,
should begin to crack the door open further for Mexican children to
find homes in the United States, said UC Berkeley Law School
professor Joan Hollinger. Other experts agree.</TE>
<TE>   "The Mexican central authority will be more willing to deal with
the United States," Hollinger said of implementation of the
international rules.</TE>
<TE>   "People who are concerned about the integrity of the process and
the legality of adoptions from Mexico will ostensibly feel much more
security in the process."</TE>
<TE>   With legal confusion lessened, adoptive parents in the U.S. may
take advantage of Mexico's proximity and avoid costly flights halfway
around the world to find children, Hollinger said.</TE>
<TE>   Adoptive families hope new regulations will make the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service less of an obstacle. But under
current rules, once an adoption is finalized in Mexico, the INS
investigates to determine whether the child is truly an orphan,
eligible for a visa to immigrate into the United States.</TE>
<TE>   If a visa is denied, parents in the U.S. are then left with a
difficult choice: leaving their child in Mexican foster care or
moving to the country for two years until meeting the custody
requirement for a visa.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't make sense," said Aida Capaceta Tostado, an adoption
attorney in Tijuana. "Mexico can't revoke the adoption because the
mom is gone and has given up her rights. And the couple doesn't want
to leave the baby here. It's not fair for the baby or the couple."</TE>
<TE>   INS spokesman Bill Strassberger said the agency has to take the
precautionary steps to prevent birth mothers from selling their
children.</TE>
<TE>   Adoptive parents in Mexico are permitted to pay only the medical
costs of pregnancies and deliveries, but cannot give mothers money
directly.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't, as the government, stand by and allow for exploitation
to take place, and child trafficking is exploitation," Strassberger
said.</TE>
<TE>   Adoption attorneys say the process differs from country to country
because of the laws and cultural and religious values of a particular
nation.</TE>
<TE>   It's no secret that there are more adoptions from China, attorneys
said, where boys have more social status and orphanages are filled
with newborn girls. And in Eastern Europe, the fall of communism led
to countries opening their orphanage doors to U.S. couples looking
for white children.</TE>
<TE>   But the U.S. ground rules for determining if children are orphans
are the same regardless of country of origin, said Irene Steffas, a
liaison between the INS and the American Academy of Adoption
Attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   The low numbers of Mexican adoptions do not appear to be racially
motivated. This year, 2,219 Guatemalan children received orphan visas
to live with U.S. families.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican officials said they try to return children to their
families or place them with adoptive families within the country
before considering international adoptions. Some Mexican states also
prohibit international adoptions for children younger than 5.</TE>
<TE>   In Tijuana, the children at Casa de la Esperanza arrive for lunch
just before noon. Each day, they line up to say a quick prayer before
rushing into the auditorium. Many of the 55 children have parents who
are homeless, prostitutes or addicted to drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Some, like Roberto and his 8-year-old sister, Karina, were
orphaned when their parents died of AIDS. Roberto said he's thankful
they aren't living on the streets but that they would "still be happy
to leave" the orphanage.</TE>
<TE>   Antonio Lara, who runs the orphanage with his wife, said he would
love to see each of the children placed in stable homes but doesn't
believe the adoption process should be rushed. Officials have to
ensure that the adoptive parents are committed to the children and
that they are adopting for the right reasons, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Brent Yoder, director of Adoptions Options in San Diego, said he
discourages families from adopting from Mexico, calling the country's
public adoption process "convoluted." If a family is still determined
to adopt a Mexican child, Yoder said he suggests they go through a
less restrictive private adoption that can be arranged directly with
birth mothers rather than going through the government, as in public
adoptions.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the process is still cumbersome, requiring several
trips to the country and taking as long as six months. It is also
risky.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, well-intentioned adoptive parents are so desperate
that they unwittingly pay fake agents, said Maria Ramirez of
Adoptions Unlimited in Chino. Even though she has placed dozens of
Mexican children in the U.S., Ramirez said she never promises parents
anything.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an emotional and financial roller coaster," Ramirez said.
"We never guarantee a placement."</TE>
<TE>   Jessica and Darryl Wagoner lived through a year of uncertainty
before finally crossing the border legally into the U.S. with two
adopted sons.</TE>
<TE>   Unable to have children, the Huntington Beach couple decided to
adopt and chose Mexico primarily because of its proximity. But they
got a hint of potential glitches when the birth mother didn't show up
for their first meeting in January 2000. But at the next meeting, the
birth mother handed her 5-month-old son to the Wagoners, who received
legal permission for temporary custody.</TE>
<TE>   The Wagoners said they knew then there was no turning back. While
the adoption was going through, Darryl Wagoner took a leave of
absence from his carpentry job and moved to Mexico to live with the
boy they named Trent.</TE>
<TE>   After a few more stops and starts, the adoption was approved and
the INS granted the baby a visa just before Easter 2000.</TE>
<TE>   During the process, the birth mother became pregnant again and
offered a second child to the Wagoners, raising red flags on both
sides of the border. "They were very suspicious," Wagoner said. "They
wanted to make sure she wasn't selling the babies."</TE>
<TE>   Jessica Wagoner said the process was "nerve-racking and
expensive," costing more than $40,000 in fees, hospital expenses and
other costs.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, right before Christmas that year, the Mexican court
also approved the adoption of the second boy, Aidan, and the INS
granted a visa.</TE>
<TE>   Now that it's over, Jessica Wagoner said, she knows it was worth
it. "I couldn't even think of living without them."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A former death row inmate who served 23 years for killing a security
guard has been released and could remain free because a judge agrees
the slaying was accidental.</LD>
<LD>   Larry Mack, 48, admitted killing the guard in a botched 1979 bank
robbery in Chicago. He was sentenced to death.</LD>
<LD>   In 1995, a Cook County judge and the Illinois Supreme Court ruled
out the death penalty in Mack's case because of the crime's
accidental nature.</LD>
<TE>   Mack's attorneys argue that he would have been sentenced to no
more than 40 years in 1979, and could have gotten out after 20 with
good behavior. He was ordered released on bond Tuesday, pending a
Jan. 9 hearing to settle his sentence.</TE>

<LD>Back in 1953, fed up with holiday cheer, Joe Staab bought co-worker
Gerry Champion an "ugly little Christmas card" that was green and
brown with pine cones on the front.</LD>
<LD>   Forty-nine years later, the same old tattered card keeps going
back and forth.</LD>
<LD>   "It started as a joke," Champion said of the exchange that began

City, N.J.</LD>
<TE>   Champion sends it in even years; Staab sends it in odd years.</TE>

<HD>'No Third Way' for U.S. Iraqis</HD>
<DH>Americans who oppose Hussein and a policy that cripples
their homeland say that speaking out on either front carries risks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Faye Fiore</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>It was a Saturday morning in October and Anas Shallal should have
been at one of the five restaurants he owns with his brother here,
making sure the produce was ordered for brunch and checking the list
of dinner reservations.</LD>
<LD>   But Bush's signature was fresh on a United Nations resolution
threatening the use of force against the country where Shallal was
born, where some of his relatives still live. So he found himself in
his silver Camry headed for the White House gates to protest the
possibility of another war in Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Of the tens of thousands of demonstrators who crowded the
rain-soaked Mall that day, Shallal was one of a handful who could
claim Iraq as a birthplace. As the nation debates the wisdom of war,
actors, feminists and even Teamsters are weighing in. But the voices
seldom heard are those of Iraqi Americans.</LD>
<TE>   "If you call Iraqis for an opinion poll, most will hang up,"
Shallal said. "They are suspicious, uncomfortable about expressing
their opinions, even to other Iraqis. They've learned it doesn't
pay."</TE>
<TE>   Experts are not even sure how many Iraqi nationals live in the
U.S. -- much less their political leanings -- but estimates range
from 200,000 to 400,000. Some are concentrated in pockets around
Detroit, San Diego, Chicago and New York; others are scattered across
the nation.</TE>
<TE>   This diverse and undefined population includes business and
military elite who were ruined by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and
want their due. There are recent refugees who fled from his rule
after the Persian Gulf War and want to go home. There are the
bankers, physicists, doctors and investors, well-educated American
citizens who came here decades ago and have no intention of ever
moving back -- the products of two cultures who go to mosques and
movie theaters, eat pizza as often as kebabs and send their children
to American schools during the week, Arabic school on Sundays.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   United Against Hussein</TE>
<TE>   If they have anything in common, it is probably a desire to see
Hussein fall. The pipelines from home are clogged with stories of
misery, the results of U.S.-imposed sanctions many believe are harder
on the Iraqi people than on their brutal leader. The cousin dead from
food poisoning, released by a hospital too depleted to treat her. The
grandmother dead for lack of heart medication. The nephew dead for
lack of insulin.</TE>
<TE>   The wealthier ones send their American dollars home -- less than
$200 supports a family of five for a month. And some have nightmares,
literally, of bombs falling on Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   But when it comes to the question of ending Hussein's 23-year lock
on the country, many see only two choices: Endorse a U.S. policy of
sanctions and force that could bomb Iraq back to the Stone Age, or
back a murderous dictator.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no third way," explained James Zogby, president of the
Arab American Institute. "Ordinary Iraqis here and there are caught
between the anvil of a brutal regime and the hammer of a brutal
sanctions policy. You're either going to get smashed by the anvil or
smashed by the hammer."</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, there is a base of support for military action,
particularly among Iraqi intellectuals forced out by Hussein and the
more recent refugees still struggling for a foothold here. Indeed,
when President Bush visited Nashville several weeks ago, home to
about 7,800 Iraqis and Kurds, his get-tough-on-Hussein policy was
cheered by an audience that included many Iraqi nationals.</TE>
<TE>   "Saddam is a dangerous man. He needs to be gone very soon. What
are the Iraqi people going to do?" said Mohammed Albadran, program
manager for the Iraqi House of Nashville, an assistance group for
immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi National Congress, the country's main opposition party
in exile, tends to have the ear of officials in the West. But it
represents only one facet of Iraqi public opinion, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bush administration operates under the delusion that the
majority of Iraqi Americans favor a war," said Khalil Jahshan,
executive vice president of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination
Committee in Washington. "I met recently with some State Department
officials who said 80[%] to 90% of Iraqi American leaders were with
them. I said, 'What ... are you talking about?' Clearly, we swim in
different circles."</TE>
<TE>   Yet for many Iraqi Americans, the idea of protesting government
policy is dangerous, particularly after last year's terrorist attacks
that made so many Arabs suspect. A war could be costly for them on
both ends: There, friends and family live in the path of American
bombs; here, they are poised to become the face of the new enemy.</TE>
<TE>   "Many Iraqis who came here after the '70s don't have a sense of
political involvement," said Shallal, a 47-year-old father of four.
"In Iraq, there is a fear that if you speak too much, somebody is
going to come knocking at your door."</TE>
<TE>   As a result, many Iraqi nationals live in quiet distrust of two
governments -- one that kills families of critics in exile, another
known for jailing immigrants when national security is compromised.
Recent reports that Washington is monitoring thousands of Iraqis in
the United States as part of its war on terrorism served to
underscore the apprehension. An e-mail with the news circulated
through the community under the heading: "Worst Fears Confirmed."</TE>
<TE>   The climate is disconcerting even for Shallal and his older
brother, Yasir, seasoned activists who came to the U.S. as teenagers
and openly opposed the 1991 Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very intimidating, very chilling," Yasir Shallal, 48, a
successful builder and the father of three, said of Washington's
watchful eye. "It tells me if I disagree with U.S. policy, my loyalty
is in question. People who have lived here a very long time are
saying we thought we were living in a democracy, and today we're not
so sure. And then people wonder why nobody speaks out."</TE>
<TE>   Which is why the 100 or so Iraqi nationals who gathered on the
Mall when the rain yielded to a bright sky that October Saturday in
Washington seemed to some not a paltry turnout at all, but a cause
for celebration.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Desperate Predicament</TE>
<TE>   It is just after 9 p.m. and a pot of chai tea is cooking on the
stove in a northern Virginia home. That's the Iraqi way: Leave it on
a slow burn, all day. Two children are upstairs doing homework. The
house is warm and comfortable and expansive, fruits of American
affluence that come from first-rate educations. The wife is a
pharmacist, her husband a prosperous contractor. They live a mile or
so from Secretary of State Colin L. Powell.</TE>
<TE>   The phone rings. An elderly relative in Baghdad needs medication
for fluid on her knees. Could they send some? The wife puts the phone
down in despair; appeals like this come all the time from distant
family. But how can she help them when she couldn't help her own
mother, who suffered a stroke at 63 and died four agonizing years
later for lack of the remedies her daughter held in her hands every
day?</TE>
<TE>   "It was devastating not to be able to help her," she says, curled
up on a soft leather couch. "You can't trust the mail there. I had to
find someone who was traveling overseas to take it to her. But I
could only get it there about twice a year.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't enough. She would run out, and then they would switch
her to whatever other medicine they could find."</TE>
<TE>   In desperation, her mother was brought to the U.S., a journey that
required a 12-hour car ride to Jordan to avoid Iraq's "no-fly" zone,
then a long flight overseas. She landed in a state of delirium and
died in a Baltimore hospital three days later while her children were
deciding whether doctors should amputate her legs.</TE>
<TE>   "If not for the sanctions, she would never have gotten that sick,"
the woman says. "I'm not angry at the U.S. government, just sad. Why
do those innocent people have to suffer so much?"</TE>
<TE>   She reads, she votes, she pays taxes. She teaches her children to
be good citizens. She marches in protest of another war. She condemns
the sanctions that made her family and friends destitute overnight,
forcing them to sell their furniture, artwork, interior doors and, in
extreme cases, their kidneys.</TE>
<TE>   But she can't reveal her name. She can't afford to be that public.
Not with a widowed father alone in Baghdad, a sitting duck for a
vengeful dictator. Not when she suspects an American government is
watching.</TE>
<TE>   Her apprehension is not uncommon, said Ziad Asali, executive
director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. "The
Iraqis are the most intimidated of all the Arab people -- by far," a
reticence rooted in the country's history, Asali said.</TE>
<TE>   When Iraq's current boundaries were carved out of the Ottoman
Empire in 1920, a collection of ethnicities, cultures and religions
were lassoed into one nation -- Kurdish, Shiite and Sunni Muslims,
and a Christian minority -- creating a nationality that was never
very cohesive. The British governed it with a brutal military
designed to keep internal control, setting up a model for a
succession of iron-fisted rulers, said Ali Abunimah, vice president
of the Arab-American Action Network in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   The last two decades in Iraq have been spent in turmoil: eight
years of war with Iran, a Gulf War that bombed to oblivion parts of a
country twice the size of Idaho, and a decade of economic sanctions
that have contributed to the deaths of half a million people, by some
estimates.</TE>
<TE>   In that time, the middle class virtually disappeared. Iraq has
long been known in the Arab world as a nation of intellectuals -- as
the saying goes, "The Egyptians write, the Lebanese publish and the
Iraqis read." But most of the intellectuals have fled.</TE>
<TE>   The dinar once worth $3 is now nearly worthless. Once-exemplary
hospitals make do without blankets. And many fear that even a war
designed to spare civilians will harm them one way or another, if not
by stray shrapnel then by a demolished infrastructure that means no
power, ruined roads, little food, contaminated water.</TE>
<TE>   "People want to get rid of Saddam but without having their people
pay a bigger price," said Zogby of the Arab American Institute. "But
no one has brought them in to talk to them. And, post-9/11, it will
not be easy for them to come together to say, 'We don't want a war,
but we want a U.S. policy that cares about our people.' "</TE>
<TE>   That policy, many believe, should call for the U.S. to lift the
economic sanctions that are holding the Iraqi people back and support
an insurrection from within.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Belonging to Neither</TE>
<TE>   In a hip quarter of Washington known as Dupont Circle sits Cafe
Luna, one of the restaurants owned by the Shallal brothers. The menu
is Mediterranean with an American flair, sort of like them.</TE>
<TE>   They came here in the late 1960s when their father took a job in
Washington with the Arab League, figuring they would stay two years
and go home. The U.S. was exciting but hard. The English that Yasir
learned at a Jesuit school in Baghdad didn't work as well as he
expected; the word "paint" looked a lot like the word "pants." When
he made the football team, he was the first in his high school's
history to kick soccer-style, using the side of his foot instead of
the front. It made him something of a team novelty, and before long,
he belonged to two nations instead of one. That was a good thing,
until the two nations locked horns.</TE>
<TE>   Relations broke between the U.S. and Iraq after the 1967 Middle
East War and their father lost his diplomatic job. There would be no
moving back. Trips home were dangerous. The last time Yasir visited
was 1979; Anas never did return.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a loss," Yasir says over an afternoon cup of coffee. "You
are like a tourist when you go back, because you are no longer the
same person; you are an American. But sometimes you feel out of place
here. You belong to both, and yet you don't belong to either."</TE>
<TE>   When the Gulf War erupted in 1991, Yasir and his brother watched
the bombing of Baghdad on television, the screen blinking with every
explosive thud. Most Americans saw a tyrant's headquarters getting
just deserts. They saw a 5,000-year-old ancestral home under assault:
birthplace of the first civilization in the history of humanity; the
center of learning, philosophy, architecture and medicine in the
Middle Ages; the land where writing was invented.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole idea of Iraq has been stolen from underneath us. Iraq
is not just Saddam Hussein," Anas Shallalsays. "Every fifth-grader
studies Mesopotamia -- the cradle of civilization -- but how many of
them connect that with modern-day Iraq? If you are going to bomb this
land you are bound to destroy the ruins of an ancient civilization.
In Iraq, you trip over ruins."</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the war, they formed the Mesopotamia Cultural
Society to promote Iraq's ancient and modern culture. With the help
of a local congressman, Iraqi art was displayed in the Capitol
rotunda. The group met several times in the early 1990s, then petered
out as U.S. foreign policy turned its attentions elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Now Baghdad is back on the national radar, and Shallal thought
about reviving the old group.</TE>
<TE>   He floated the idea with one of the original members, asking if he
would go on a local talk show to remind people that Hussein is not
the face of Iraq, but a blip in the history of an ancient and
wondrous place.</TE>
<TE>   The answer was no.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't bother to ask the rest.</TE>

<HD>Kings for a Day, or the Kings for This Season?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For one day, the answer to the burning question "What's wrong with
the Lakers?" was simple. The solution came as nicely wrapped as
anything you might find under a Christmas tree: The Sacramento Kings
are a better team, for now and the foreseeable future.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers didn't produce a peak performance, but it was better
than most of their 19 losses. Yet all they could do was make it a
game, a hard-earned, 105-99 Sacramento victory at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought the Lakers played well," King Coach Rick Adelman said.</LD>
<TE>   He wouldn't get much of an argument from Kobe Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   "Tonight we played really, really well," Bryant said. "Outside of
that mental lapse we had in the third quarter."</TE>
<TE>   That lapse he was referring to -- a bit of premature celebration,
as Phil Jackson labeled it -- came after the Lakers took a 12-point
lead in the third quarter. The Kings stormed back with a 16-5 run,
and held a three-point lead by the time the quarter ended.</TE>
<TE>   And for a desperate Laker team searching for positives, such as
this good showing against one of the league's best teams, just be
aware that the Kings are playing at about 65%, in Chris Webber's
estimation. They're still adjusting to Mike Bibby, who missed the
first 27 games of the season after foot surgery. And they went the
final 4 1/2 minutes without supersub Bobby Jackson, who broke a bone
in his left hand.</TE>
<TE>   "Every team gets better; we'll get better too," Webber said. "But
we took their best shot today. We were down 10 in the third quarter,
we took their best shot. If anything, we showed that we're more
composed."</TE>
<TE>   It's not only how they responded to adversity that was different,
it was how they acted after winning. The old Kings led the league in
clowning opponents and fans on the road. But there were no goofy
gestures by Webber or primal screams by Bibby. When it was over,
Webber didn't say anything. He simply pointed to the front of his
jersey.</TE>
<TE>   SACRAMENTO.</TE>
<TE>   That says enough. (Although before the game, Webber couldn't
resist this jab at Rick Fox when talking about the aftermath of his
fight with Doug Christie in a preseason game: "I think Fox knows what
99% of NBA players think about him and the situation. It's kind of
like, he should be quiet. After you get beat up, just be quiet. What
else you gonna do?")</TE>
<TE>   Sorry if this is too much Sacramento for you, but it's their party
right now.</TE>
<TE>   What to say about the Lakers?</TE>
<TE>   One of the observations has been that they're not trying hard
enough. Well, you don't outrebound a team, 61-42, and block six shots
(as the Lakers did Wednesday) without putting in some work.</TE>
<TE>   "The effort is the same effort," Fox said. "Unfortunately that's
no longer enough. What we gave last year is not good enough."</TE>
<TE>   Not when other teams have improved -- and the Lakers are
regressing.</TE>
<TE>   "Our well's not as full," Fox said. "It seems to carry us 20-25
minutes a game."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers had some stretches when they played well, when the
shots fell and the fans cheered and the game's intensity and the
network TV cameras made it feel like June.</TE>
<TE>   They looked good for the opening 5 1/2 minutes, got their buckets
the old-fashioned way when Shaquille O'Neal scored eight points in
three minutes near the end of the second and took control at the
start of the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "We put it together for 2 1/2 quarters," Bryant said. "We're not
at the level we can play that way for 48 minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Even when they've lost in December it's not as if they're so inept
they can't advance the ball past half court. They're getting the ball
to Shaq and Kobe, and those guys are creating open shots for their
teammates. The shots just haven't been going in.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, O'Neal and Bryant were as guilty as anyone, if not
more. They missed 16 of their 20 shots in the second half. Most of
O'Neal's were layups. Some of Bryant's were wild, circa 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "I might have over-penetrated," Bryant conceded.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said he had some philosophical disagreements with Bryant's
decisions and attempts to take on multiple defenders, but he said it
was an isolated case. Some, including an ESPN.com columnist who has
no other apparent purpose than to serve as the valet parker for Phil
Jackson's karma, thinks Bryant's play is the Lakers' primary flaw.</TE>
<TE>   Right. If everyone else were as dedicated in the off-season and
brought as much energy to each game as he did, the Lakers wouldn't be
in this hole. He could provide more help on defense and take better
care of the ball (he's averaging four turnovers a game) but he's not
the problem.</TE>
<TE>   The business model for the Lakers relies upon Kobe and Shaq
scoring lots of points, and in order to do that they've got to shoot
the ball as much as reasonably possible.</TE>
<TE>   The real concern is O'Neal's inability to overpower defenders the
way he used to. He had another earth-bound game Wednesday, and he had
to make 11 of his 16 free throws to get to 27 points.</TE>
<TE>   And Jackson said afterward that we should get used to this, that
the "dynamic" Shaq of days past is gone. Whether it's age, his toe
injury and the necessary orthotics in his shoe, he just can't explode
the way he used to. Which means the Lakers' primary option isn't as
effective. That's one reason they were outscored, 52-30, inside on
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   That's a category they used to own. The same way they owned the
Kings. The Kings were the better team last season, the Lakers won
because they were the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers don't have the same look. (And it wasn't just the white
jerseys at home -- a nice touch, as long as they don't permanently
replace the gold uniforms.)</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal, the ringleader of all the trash-talking in the good times,
disappeared without saying a word this time. If he's going to enjoy
the sunshine, he's got to stick around in the rain, too.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal is marrying his longtime girlfriend today. One word of
advice for a successful marriage: communication. He might want to try
some.</TE>

<HD>He Was Ready to Turn Paige on Griese</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Even before it was announced that Brian Griese would not start Sunday
against the Arizona Cardinals, Denver Post columnist Woody Paige was
ready to call an end to Griese's career with the Broncos after the
quarterback's performance against Oakland.</LD>
<LD>   Wrote Paige: "Brian Griese had a quarterback rating on Sunday that
was virtually the same as his uniform number and barely higher than a
dead man's. The biggest game of Griese's career with the Broncos was
the biggest flop of Griese's career with the Broncos. The enigmatic
quarterback's self-proclaimed big game was over even before he was
injured -- again -- in the first half. This should be Griese's final
little game."</LD>
<LD>   More Paige: "How long, Mike Shanahan, how long? Four More Years?
NO. Four More Games? NO. Four More Quarters? NO. Four More Downs? NO
WAY! If Shanahan continues to hitch his wagon to Griese, then that
horse and cart should be ridden out of Denver together."</LD>
<TE>   Trivia Time: USC is 20-8 in the Rose Bowl. What is the Trojans'
record in other bowl games?</TE>
<TE>   For cryin' out loud: Think NBA and NCAA Division I men's
basketball officials are the only ones taking a verbal pounding from
coaches? Think again.</TE>
<TE>   Check out what Los Angeles Trade Tech women's Coach Gregg Cobbs
told the Barstow Desert Dispatch after his team was upset at Barstow
College.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the worst," he said. "I can't believe the calls those
refs were making out there. [Barstow plays] in our tournament every
year.</TE>
<TE>   "Wait until they come to our place and see the referees we bring
in."</TE>
<TE>   Don't hold back, coach, how do you really feel?</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this date in 1908, Jack Johnson became the first
African American to win the heavyweight title with a 14th-round
knockout of Tommy Burns in Sydney, Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back II: On this date in 1955, the Cleveland Browns
intercepted six passes, one of which was returned 65 yards for a
touchdown by Don Paul, in a 38-14 victory over the Los Angeles Rams
for the NFL championship.</TE>
<TE>   Age before beauty: Bill Simmons of ESPN.com is afraid of aging, a
dread that does not dissipate when he looks at Ken Griffey Jr., the
man who plays center field for the Cincinnati Reds.</TE>
<TE>   "We're almost the same age ... [and it] seems like just yesterday
when Junior was this happy-go-lucky kid who played on the same team
with his Dad, wore his hat backward, and seemed on pace for 5,000
hits or 900 homers," Simmons mused.</TE>
<TE>   "Now he's 33, plagued by injuries, miserable and bitter, on the
downside of his career, and his team can't even give him away. It's
just plain depressing."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: USC has a losing record of 5-7 in postseason games
other than the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Scott Ostler of the San Francisco Chronicle has his
tongue planted firmly in his cheek when asking everyone to get off
the back of His Airness.</TE>
<TE>   Wrote Ostler: "Michael Jordan's ex-girlfriend claims he agreed to
pay her $5 million in hush money. Jordan cries foul, says that would
put him over the extortion cap. Give the guy a break. He's still
trying to pay off his golf bets."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A day of practice and travel today, a game Friday against the Suns at
Phoenix, then the Clippers figure to look a good deal more like
themselves Saturday against the Golden State Warriors at Staples
Center.</LD>
<LD>   In other words, they hope they will look like the team many
expected to post a winning record and gain a playoff berth by
season's end. It's the first in a stretch of seven of the next 10
games at home.</LD>
<LD>   Injuries have left the Clippers well short of their goals after
posting only 12 victories in 28 games to start the season. Every
member of the starting five (plus several key reserves) has been
sidelined for at least one game because of injuries ranging from
serious to mild.</LD>
<TE>   The Clippers have a few noteworthy victories, including an
overtime decision against the defending Eastern Conference champion
New Jersey Nets, a home victory over the San Antonio Spurs, a road
victory over the Orlando Magic, two victories over Yao Ming and the
Houston Rockets and a romp over the Minnesota Timberwolves.</TE>
<TE>   They also have squandered double-digit leads in losses to the
Portland Trail Blazers and Denver Nuggets.</TE>
<TE>   "Two steps forward and one step back is not going to be good
enough," Coach Alvin Gentry said the other day. "We can't keep doing
that. We've got to get in a situation where we have the same guys in
there [the lineup] night in and night out."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After taking Christmas Day off, the Clippers hope to learn more
about the status of several players for Friday's game at Phoenix,
including Corey Maggette, who has been sidelined since undergoing
arthroscopic surgery on his right knee Nov. 29. Lamar Odom is
expected to play Saturday against the Warriors.</TE>

<LD>   "It looks like a defensive struggle on paper," Oregon State Coach
Dennis Erickson said, "but you never know."</LD>
<LD>   Oregon State enters tonight's game at Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix
with the No. 10 defense in the nation, giving up 293.0 yards a game.
Pittsburgh is No. 11 at 293.4.</LD>
<TE>   "When I see Pitt's defense, I really see our defense," Oregon
State tailback Steven Jackson said. "They're both athletic. It's not
just one guy tackling the ball carrier; they really swarm to the
ball. They remind me of my team a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh Coach Walt Harris said it could be "one of the best
matchups of all the bowls."</TE>
<TE>   The Panthers lost four games by a combined 24 points, including a
28-21 loss on the road to No. 1 Miami on Nov. 21. Pittsburgh drove to
the Hurricanes' 20 in the final minute, but Rod Rutherford's
fourth-down pass into the end zone was just out of Yogi Roth's reach.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had some heartbreaks, but you know it was us. We've got to
do a better job and finish those games better," Harris said. "We're a
good 8-4 football team. How good? I think this matchup will tell us a
lot about that."</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh's biggest concern will be stopping Jackson, the
Pac-10's leading rusher by nearly 600 yards who ranked No. 4
nationally with a school record 1,656 yards, averaging 5.5 yards per
carry.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen a lot of guys play in my career," Erickson said. "He
might be as good as anybody I've ever coached. He's only a sophomore.
He's got speed and size."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After playing such powerhouses as Miami, Notre Dame and Virginia
Tech, it would be understandable if Boston College had a hard time
taking little-known Toledo seriously.</TE>
<TE>   But the Eagles are insisting that they know just how tough their
Motor City Bowl opponents will be. The teams meet today in the first
college football game at Detroit's new Ford Field.</TE>
<TE>   "Toledo could win 10 games for the third year in a row, and I
don't care what conference you are playing in, that's impressive,"
Boston College quarterback Brian St. Pierre said.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest challenge for Boston College (8-4) will be to stop the
spread offense for Toledo (9-4), which features a bewildering number
of formations and options.</TE>
<TE>   Boston College, on the other hand, runs a fairly basic attack led
by St. Pierre and tailback Derrick Knight.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh was the teams' only common opponent this year. Boston
College lost to the Panthers, 19-16, in overtime; Toledo was routed,
37-19.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Colorado freshman tackle Will Down  was sent home and will not be
with the team Saturday for the Alamo Bowl following his arrest in San
Antonio on public intoxication charges.</TE>
<TE>   Down, from Escondido, and senior linebacker Drew Wahlroos were
charged and ordered to appear in court Jan. 7, the magistrate's
office said. Down also was charged with failure to identify himself
to police early Tuesday morning.</TE>

<KH>DUCK REPORT</KH>
<HD>Return of Oates Is Turning Up the Power Play</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a slow start and a month on the shelf because of a broken hand,
Mighty Duck center Adam Oates is displaying the skills that brought
him to Anaheim.</LD>
<LD>   Duck General Manager Bryan Murray went looking for a power play
last summer and put the 40-year-old Oates in the shopping cart first.
One of the best set-up men in NHL history, Oates is back to showing
that talent in recent games.</LD>
<LD>   Oates, a 17-year veteran who led the NHL with 37 power-play
assists in 2000-01, had two in the Ducks' 5-4 loss to the Kings Dec.
19. He had two in the 5-2 victory over St. Louis the previous game.</LD>
<TE>   "A few of those were five-on-three situations; that's not the same
as regular power plays," Oates said. "But I'm a lot more confident
out there."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks, who had the worst power play in the NHL last season,
have converted on 13 of 39 power-play chances in winning six of their
last seven games.</TE>
<TE>   "Our second unit has been doing a good job," Oates said. "That
makes it tougher on the other team."</TE>
<TE>   Oates, though, has done his job ... and more. He has scored one of
those power-play goals and assisted on five others.</TE>
<TE>   "He takes a lot of pride in producing on the power play," Coach
Mike Babcock said. "We have a lot of young guys on this team. We have
10 guys 26 or younger. Having a veteran like Adam is important."</TE>
<TE>   With Oates producing, the Ducks have climbed to fifth in NHL on
the power play, converting on 20.1%.</TE>
<TE>   The acquisition of Oates was one of several off-season moves the
Ducks hoped would turn up their power-play production.</TE>
<TE>   So far, right wing Petr Sykora, acquired in a trade with New
Jersey, has eight power-play goals, tying him with Paul Kariya for
the team lead. Defenseman Fredrik Olausson, who meandered through the
first part of the season, has two goals and one assist on the power
play in the last six games. But the centerpiece in this redevelopment
project has been Oates, who signed a one-year, $3.5-million contract,
plus an option year, last summer. The returns are starting to come
in.</TE>
<TE>   Oates started slowly, with only three assists in his first seven
games, then suffered a broken bone in his left hand against Vancouver
on Oct. 24. He missed 15 games. He has a goal and eight assists in
the 12 games since returning.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first came back, there was still a lot of pain," Oates
said. "There are still some things I can't do. But the hand is a lot
better."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   at San Jose, 7:30, Fox Sports Net 2</TE>
<TE>   Site -- HP Pavilion.</TE>
<TE>   Radio -- KPLS (830).</TE>
<TE>   Records -- Ducks 15-10-6-3; Sharks 13-15-3-3.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Sharks -- 0-1-0-0.</TE>
<TE>   Update -- How important is this game to the Ducks? Well, their
playoff dreams are likely to come true only if they finish ahead of
the Sharks, who are 4-3-1-1 since Ron Wilson took over as coach.</TE>

<HD>Tulane Enjoys Island Holiday</HD>
<DH>After Hawaii's Chang is sidelined by injured thumb,
Elpheage, Losman help Green Wave rally to win, 36-28, in Hawaii Bowl.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HONOLULU</DL>
<LD>Hawaii's high-flying offense never really took off Wednesday,
especially after starting quarterback Timmy Chang went to the
sideline with an injured thumb in the second quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Although Hawaii built a 14-point lead early, Lynaris Elpheage
returned one punt for a touchdown and set up the go-ahead score to
lead Tulane to a 36-28 victory over Hawaii in the inaugural Hawaii
Bowl on Wednesday night at Honolulu.</LD>
<LD>   Trailing 14-6 in the third quarter, Elpheage, who was voted the
game's outstanding player, scored Tulane's first touchdown with a
60-yard punt return.</LD>
<TE>   Elpheage ran back Hawaii's next punt 56 yards, giving Tulane the
ball at the Hawaii 17. That set up the go-ahead touchdown, a one-yard
run by quarterback J.P. Losman. Elpheage returned four punts for 143
yards.</TE>
<TE>   The Green Wave (8-5) came in as a double-digit underdog but
threatened to turn the game into a rout when Mewelde Moore scored on
a 25-yard run late in the third period to make it 26-14. Moore rushed
for 116 yards in 30 carries, 94 yards coming in the second half. He
also had six receptions for 80 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Hawaii (10-4) came back behind reserve quarterback Shawn
Withy-Allen, who threw two fourth-quarter touchdown passes.
Withy-Allen's 57-yard scoring pass to Justin Colbert to made it 26-21
with 13 minutes 26 seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   But Losman, a Venice High graduate who completed 20 of 39 passes
for 240 yards, scored his second rushing touchdown, a three-yarder,
to extend the lead to 34-21.</TE>
<TE>   Withy-Allen, who completed 18 of 31 passes for 239 yards, and
Colbert, who had nine receptions for 158 yards, combined on a 31-yard
scoring play to narrow the gap with 5:12 left. But Tulane put the
game out of reach when Roxie Shelvin sacked Withy-Allen in the end
zone for a safety to make it 36-28 with 3:02 left.</TE>
<TE>   Tulane, which had not played since Nov. 23, appeared sluggish in
the first half and mustered only 172 yards in total offense. But
Elpheage got the Green Wave started with his returns.</TE>
<TE>   Hawaii took a 14-0 lead in the first half behind short scoring
runs by Thero Mitchell and Josh Galeai, but Tulane scored 26
consecutive points -- including 20 in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Two field goals by Seth Marler got Tulane going, closing Hawaii's
lead to 14-6.</TE>
<TE>   Hawaii, the nation's top passing offense, was without Chang for
most of the game after he injured the thumb on his throwing hand in
the second quarter. Chang completed 14 of 21 passes for 124 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Chang entered the game with 4,350 yards passing and 25 touchdowns.</TE>

<HD>York Made Mark at Santa Anita</HD>
<DH>Track's opener today is highlighted by Malibu Stakes, which
was dominated early by its first three-time winner.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Christine</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are 15 races at Santa Anita older than the Malibu Stakes, but
since the 50-year-old Malibu was re-positioned to the day after
Christmas in 1984, it has acquired the patina of some of the older
fixtures. An opening day at Santa Anita without the Malibu would be
like a Dec. 26 without standing in the exchange line.</LD>
<LD>   The 51st Malibu, which has drawn 11 horses for today's 66th Santa
Anita opener, has risen to the top by crawling and clawing, which
might be expected of a seven-furlong race on the last page of the
calendar. Santa Anita didn't make the Malibu a $100,000 race until
1984, and the North American Graded Stakes Committee didn't anoint it
as a Grade I until 1995. Even now, at a modest $200,000, the Malibu
is dwarfed by 15 richer stakes during the 85-day season.</LD>
<LD>   In the early days of the Malibu, with the horses competing for
purses that were less than $30,000, jockey Ray York could have been
tricked into believing he might win almost every running of the
stake. The race was called the Malibu Sequet in the beginning, when
York won it with Phil D. in 1952, Imbros in 1954 and Determine in
1955. Of the first four Malibus, the only one York didn't win was in
1953, which went to the filly A Gleam, under Eddie Arcaro, as York
finished third aboard Big Noise.</LD>
<TE>   York, 69, lives in Taft and came out of retirement to ride one
race at Santa Anita in 2000 so he could say that he had competed in
seven decades. York plans to attend the races at Santa Anita this
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   He was told that the year Phil D. won the Malibu, at 11-1 in a
15-horse field, he beat seven jockeys who would be elected to the
Racing Hall of Fame: Arcaro, Ralph Neves, Ted Atkinson, Johnny
Longden, Bill Shoemaker, Eric Guerin and Steve Brooks.</TE>
<TE>   "How about that," York said. "Isn't that something? I might have
made [the Hall of Fame] too, but they take a look at my purse total
and decide that it's not much. If purses back then had been close to
what they are now, I might have had a better chance."</TE>
<TE>   York won 3,082 races, 300 more than Guerin and 600 more than
another contemporary, Jack Westrope, who was voted into the Hall of
Fame this year. But York's purses totaled only $14.2 million. This
year, Jerry Bailey's purses are $22.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   Determine was the first of a short list of Kentucky Derby winners
to run in the Malibu. "I don't know if he was the best horse I ever
rode, but he was the horse that was the best to me," York said. "You
start out in this game hoping to win the Derby some day, and he gave
me everything I wanted in 1954."</TE>
<TE>   Determine was the first of eight gray and roan horses to win the
Derby.</TE>
<TE>   "At Churchill Downs that year, everybody was saying that a gray
horse would never win the Derby," York said.</TE>
<TE>   "If ever a gray was going to win the race, they said, it would
have been the year before. Native Dancer was the heavy favorite in
1953, but he had that bad trip and Dark Star barely beat him."</TE>
<TE>   Limited to soon-to-be 4-year-olds, the Malibu is the opener to the
progressively longer three-race Strub series, which concludes with
the San Fernando and the Strub Stakes. Only five horses -- none since
Precisionist in 1985 -- have swept the three. Determine won two of
the three in 1955, when the Strub was called the Santa Anita
Maturity, and Determine needed help from upstairs to win that race.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the most controversial decisions in California racing
history, stewards W.C. Buchanan, J. Kingsley Macomber and James
Tunney disqualified Miz Clementine, the favorite, and moved up
Determine, who had been beaten by a neck. Lucille Markey of
Kentucky's Calumet Farm, the owner of Miz Clementine, boycotted
California races for many years afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Arcaro, riding Miz Clementine, had been whipping left-handed
through the stretch, causing his mount to drift to the outside and
brush with Determine. York always said that the contact made a
difference at the wire, but for about 20 years Arcaro publicly
insisted that Miz Clementine was jobbed.</TE>
<TE>   Then one day York, who had been breaking some yearlings in
Northern California, ran into Joe DiMaggio at Bay Meadows.</TE>
<TE>   "I was playing golf with Arcaro the other day," DiMaggio said,
"and the Miz Clementine-Determine race came up."</TE>
<TE>   "What did Eddie say?" York asked.</TE>
<TE>   DiMaggio smiled and said:</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'I was never going to beat that other [guy], so I just
took my best shot.' "</TE>
<TE>   Of other Kentucky Derby winners who came back and attempted
sprinting in the Malibu, some succeeded and others didn't.</TE>
<TE>   Shoemaker, who won the Malibu a record eight times and trained one
winner, Diazo in 1993, used a hand ride to pilot Spectacular Bid to
his 1979 victory in what was then a world-record time of 1:20. In
1986, 29 years after he had won his first Malibu with Round Table
under 130 pounds, Shoemaker rode Ferdinand to a 1 1/4-length win over
Snow Chief. Ferdinand, winning for the first time since the Derby,
was the third betting choice.</TE>
<TE>   At only one turn, the Malibu can magnify mistakes. In 1966, Lucky
Debonair broke through the gate before the start and dropped
Shoemaker to the ground. After he was reloaded, Lucky Debonair
finished fifth.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, Silver Charm looked like the 3-10 cinch that bettors made
him -- the rest of the field was 7-1 or higher. But Silver Charm was
caught in a hole down on the rail and lost to Lord Grillo by a
half-length.</TE>
<TE>   The longer distances of the San Fernando and the Strub told a
truer story. Silver Charm was a strong winner both times.</TE>
<TE>   Ray York won his fourth, and last, Malibu with More Megaton in
1963.</TE>
<TE>   "All those wins in that race had nothing to do with anything,
really," he said. "It was just that in those days, I seemed to have
one good 3-year-old after another to ride."</TE>

<LD>Kevin Rooney never had a more inexperienced team in his 23 seasons as
football coach at Sherman Oaks Notre Dame High.</LD>
<LD>   The Knights were unranked in the preseason top-25 ratings by The
Times and had 13 non-senior starters.</LD>
<LD>   All Notre Dame did was become one of only three teams in the state
to finish 14-0. It was the first perfect season in school history,
helping Rooney be selected as coach of the year by The Times.</LD>
<TE>   En route to winning the Southern Section Division III
championship, Notre Dame knocked off City champion Lake Balboa
Birmingham, Division IV finalist Westlake Village Westlake and
Division III's top-seeded team, Manhattan Beach Mira Costa, which
went into the championship game unbeaten.</TE>
<TE>   "This was his best job coaching in his career," said assistant
Jeff Kraemer.</TE>
<TE>   Helping Rooney has been defensive coordinator Joe McNab, who has
coached at Notre Dame for 22 years.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing that made it special is we had so few seniors, and yet
they did such a great job leading everyone else," Rooney said.</TE>
<TE>   It's not every season that a group of players fulfill their
potential.</TE>
<TE>   "I enjoyed being around them every day," Rooney said. "They were
really determined and didn't get distracted."</TE>

<LD>Sedrick Ellis quickly spotted the clue. Settling into a three-point
stance for the Chino High defense last season, Ellis looked over the
opposing offensive lineman and knew what play was coming. It would be
a run.</LD>
<LD>   The ball was snapped and Ellis stormed the backfield before the
ballcarrier could barely make a move. A split second later, they both
lay in a pile three yards behind the line of scrimmage.</LD>
<LD>   "I could tell [it was a run play] by the color of his fingertips,"
said Ellis, selected The Times' lineman of the year. "Experience has
taught me the little things, like when [an offensive lineman] is
leaning into [his] stance, it's a run play."</LD>
<TE>   The little things helped Ellis improve over his last two seasons.
Despite having multiple blockers assigned to him on most plays, Ellis
still managed 62 assisted tackles, 35 unassisted tackles, 19 tackles
for loss and 6.5 sacks this season.</TE>
<TE>   He also blocked a punt, caused a fumble, recovered two fumbles and
pressured the passer 19 times. In a nonleague game against Lompoc,
the Southern Section Division X champion, Ellis recorded 22 tackles.</TE>
<TE>   Ellis, at 6-3, 260 pounds with a time of 4.78 in the 40-yard dash,
is being pursued by such top collegiate teams as Miami, USC, Oklahoma
and Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>   "The colleges are just drooling about him," said Chino defensive
coordination Pete Merandi. "If I ever had a player who could play on
Sundays down the line, he could be it."</TE>

<KH>GLENN DAVIS AWARD WINNER</KH>
<HD>Lewis Made His Points</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Ortega</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He has an exceptional combination of size, speed and strength, but
the thing that distinguishes wide receiver and running back Whitney
Lewis of Ventura St. Bonaventure is his approach to the game of
football.</LD>
<LD>   Jon Mack, St. Bonaventure's coach, says that superb genetics have
allowed the 6-foot-2, 218-pound Lewis to run a hand-timed 4.34
seconds in the 40 yard-dash, bench-press 305 pounds and squat 590.
But he has extraordinary drive and determination.</LD>
<LD>   "He is very committed in the weight room," Mack said. "He studies
film and is always looking for a way to take advantage of an opposing
defense. He's definitely a student of the game. He has worked very
hard on his speed and improving his ability to change directions and
run patterns.</LD>
<TE>   "He was blessed with a lot of God-given ability, but he has worked
very hard to improve what he has."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis, a senior, concurs.</TE>
<TE>   "I've just always been taught that there's always someone out
there who is better than you," he said. "That you have to work hard
to improve yourself because there are people out there who will pass
you by if you don't.</TE>
<TE>   "I always want to be the best. Whether it's the best receiver, the
top recruit or the best player at this level or that level."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis, who was overshadowed by record-breaking running back
Lorenzo Booker during his first three years at St. Bonaventure, was
one of the most highly regarded receivers in the nation before this
season.</TE>
<TE>   His stellar play while leading St. Bonaventure to the Southern
Section Division IV title led to his selection as The Times' Glenn
Davis Award honoree.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis rushed for 1,059 yards in 112 carries, caught 65 passes for
1,235 yards and scored 42 touchdowns this season, reaching the end
zone once every 4 1/2 times he touched the ball on offense.</TE>
<TE>   "He has the ability to take a typical play and turn it into a
touchdown," Mack said. "His ultimate goal is to get into the end zone
and win ballgames."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis, who plans to take recruiting trips to Florida, Miami,
Texas, USC and Washington, saved his best performance of the season
for last when he accounted for 359 of St. Bonaventure's 521 yards in
a 40-14 rout of Westlake Village Westlake in the Division IV title
game.</TE>
<TE>   Westlake entered that game with one of most highly regarded
defenses in Ventura County, but Lewis shredded it.</TE>
<TE>   He had touchdown runs of 16, 80 and 38 yards in the first half and
added a 52-yard touchdown reception to help the Seraphs (13-1) take a
33-7 lead at intermission.</TE>
<TE>   He added a 21-yard touchdown reception the first time he touched
the ball in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   All told, he had nine carries for 192 yards and seven receptions
for 167 yards.</TE>
<TE>   St. Bonaventure's victory did not come as a shock to those who
followed Division IV football this season, but it gave Lewis and his
teammates a sense of redemption because critics had contended that
the Seraphs won three consecutive Division XI titles -- and 42
consecutive games -- from 1999-2001 while beating up on small
schools.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't worried about the jump to Division IV," Lewis said.
"We knew we were fully prepared for it because last year we had
played some Division XI teams that held their own against some of the
better Division IV schools. We knew what we had to do and we did it."</TE>

<LD>Michael Okwo prefers to look at his entire high school career rather
than each individual year, which is fitting since he's as complete a
player as can be found at the high school level.</LD>
<LD>   A running back and linebacker for Manhattan Beach Mira Costa, Okwo
could dominate a game from either side of the ball. He had 2,481
yards and 30 touchdowns as a running back; 120 tackles and seven
sacks as a linebacker this season.</LD>
<LD>   He was the driving force behind Mira Costa's 13-1 season and run
to the Southern Section Division III championship game and is The
Times' back of the year.</LD>
<TE>   "I prefer to look not like it was a good year, but that it was a
good three years," said Okwo, whose team lost to Sherman Oaks Notre
Dame in the Division III final. "We were expecting to take it all
this year and even though we didn't, we know how good the season
was."</TE>
<TE>   In his three years on varsity, Okwo's teams made the Division III
finals twice and the semifinals the other year. He had 400 tackles
and 14 sacks for his career and rushed for 6,014 yards and 71
touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Okwo, who will probably play linebacker in college, has offers
from Stanford, USC, UCLA and Oregon State, but has yet to make a
decision.</TE>
<TE>   "It hasn't hit me yet that [my high school career] is over," he
said. "I won't really feel it until spring practice starts and I'm
not out there, but I'll still be getting ready for next year."</TE>

<HD>Desormeaux Takes Aim at Opening-Day Feature</HD>

<LD>In the last decade, only one jockey has won the $200,000 Malibu
Stakes, the traditional opening-day feature of Santa Anita's
winter-spring meet, more than once.</LD>
<LD>   Kent Desormeaux won the Grade I in 1995 with Afternoon Deelites,
came right back with King Of The Heap 12 months later, then won again
last year with the brilliant Mizzen Mast, whose career ended
prematurely because of injury.</LD>
<LD>   Desormeaux will try for a fourth win in eight years this afternoon
when he rides comeback horse Sunday Break against 10 other
3-year-olds in the seven-furlong Malibu.</LD>
<TE>   Like his female stablemate Bella Bellucci, Sunday Break's
accomplishments haven't matched his hype. The son of Forty Niner has
won half of his eight starts but only one stake, the Grade II Peter
Pan against a suspect field on May 25 at Belmont Park.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Koji Maeda, the Japanese-bred colt hasn't run since
finishing a distant third in the Belmont Stakes on June 8. He has
trained well for his return for Neil Drysdale and has won twice in
three starts at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   The first leg of a Strub Series that also includes the $200,000
San Fernando Breeders' Cup Stakes on Jan. 11 and the $400,000 Strub
Stakes on Feb. 1, the Malibu also lured, among others, Mayakovsky,
the Herman Sarkowsky-owned pair of Timely Action and Total Limit, and
Debonair Joe, a $12,500 claim by trainer Juan Pablo Silva who won the
Vernon O. Underwood at Hollywood Park earlier this month at nearly
53-1.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Ghostzapper, a promising 2-year-old owned by
Frank Stronach and trained by Bobby Frankel, will make his second
start in today's third at Santa Anita, a $52,000 allowance at six
furlongs. The half-brother of City Zip was impressive in his debut on
Nov. 16 at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Bob Baffert. The trainer has won the title at Santa
Anita's winter-spring meet five consecutive times, equaling a record
set by Red McDaniel from 1949-50 through 1954-55.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Jeff Correa. The New York trainer has won with two of
41 starters in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Lake William and Kolinor
in the fourth, singling D's Bertrando in the fifth and using Dawson
Trail, Gross Margin, Richard's Boy and Golden Embers in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: (Final for Hollywood Park): Previous day/meet total:
5/90. Money: Previous day/meet total: $19.40/$492. Total money bet:
$596.</TE>

<LD>As the Kings embark on the post-Christmas portion of their schedule
-- 48 games, starting tonight against the Phoenix Coyotes, through
the season finale April 6 -- they have yet to play a game with their
full complement of players.</LD>
<LD>   Nor will they for at least two more weeks, Jan. 9 being the
earliest projected return for defenseman Aaron Miller, sidelined
because of a broken left foot.</LD>
<LD>   "It's part of the game," Coach Andy Murray said of the spate of
injuries, which sidelined seven players -- Jason Allison, Adam
Deadmarsh, Erik Rasmussen, Lubomir Visnovsky, Steve Heinze, Ken
Belanger and Miller -- for Monday night's 5-0 loss to the St. Louis
Blues.</LD>
<TE>   "The tough part," Murray added, "is we haven't been able to really
see what kind of team we are. Will we ever get to the point where the
guys will be back long enough that we know exactly where we're at?
...</TE>
<TE>   "It's so tough to get a read on our team. We've battled, we've
kept ourselves in contention ... and I don't know if anybody's been
hit as hard as we have with our top-end players."</TE>
<TE>   The key, captain Mattias Norstrom said, is to not dwell on it.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not the only team in this situation," he said. "Sure, it's
tough, but we'll get everybody healthy. Until then, we can't just sit
and wait. When will that be? Will it be a week from now? Will it be
two weeks from now?</TE>
<TE>   "We have games ahead of us right now. We have no choice but to dig
in and find a way because there's no other choice."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Allison's status for tonight's game will be determined today, but
Rasmussen and Visnovsky are expected to return to the lineup after
sitting out Monday's game because of back injuries. Deadmarsh is not
expected to play.</TE>

again, Rick Fox was the first one to the center circle Wednesday
night, perhaps so there would be no mistake. He would not shake their
hands or touch their fists or even look into their eyes.</LD>
<LD>   He sat in a squat and then nine other players began to fill the
circle on the court at Staples Center. Vlade Divac offered his fist.
Fox pointed at him. He wanted no part of that. Divac talked to him,
but Fox stared at the floor and offered no response.</LD>
<LD>   "He went on to diagnose me in psychological fashion," Fox said,
"saying that I was sick and I have problems."</LD>
<TE>   Fox and Doug Christie had fought on that very court two months
before, and then Fox chased him down in the tunnel, a decision that
cost him a good part of a six-game suspension.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd booed Christie, but that was the only reminder of the
incident, and Fox said he did not intend any grand disrespect.</TE>
<TE>   "I did exactly what I do every game," he said. "Between the lines,
I'm really not there to make friends.... I don't understand the rule
that says you're unsportsmanlike if you don't touch hands.... I
didn't need to be Vlade's friend today."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Weeks ago, Coach Phil Jackson said it would be Christmas before he
would form an opinion about the Lakers, beyond that before he would
commit to change.</TE>
<TE>   "We know we're not as quick as we'd like to be," Jackson said. "We
have some breakdowns on defense we'd like to eradicate. We don't
[chase loose balls] very well as a basketball club. Our second
effort, or recovery effort, is lacking at the defensive end. We're
not getting many second-chance points. We're having to grind out
everything because we're not getting any fastbreaks, not getting easy
points. These are all things we'd like to improve."</TE>
<TE>   The key question is, then, are his players capable?</TE>
<TE>   "I think they are," he said. "But, we need two things. We need a
little infusion of energy, an enthusiasm about the game. We have to
enjoy playing together again.</TE>
<TE>   "And we need some bench production. Whether we have to sit some
starters or start some sitters, whatever it is that we can generate a
little more total team effort."</TE>

<HD>Kings Have Capital, for Now</HD>
<DH>Lakers blow early leads and fall, 105-99, to Sacramento in
first regular-season meeting since Game 7 of 2002 conference finals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Their 19th defeat came three months early, wrong saint, Nicholas
rather than Patrick, the Lakers now playing against the calendars of
their seasons as well as their careers, not to mention the Sacramento
Kings and whatever else strolls into their gym.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings were 105-99 winners in the Christmas game at Staples
Center, Wednesday night showing new uniforms and the same old
shooting percentage -- 36.7 -- and an occasional disinterest in
defense. They lost a 12-point lead in a mess of pick-and-rolls and,
overall, in Chris Webber's 26 points and Kobe Bryant and Shaquille
O'Neal's combined shooting of 15 for 43.</LD>
<LD>   So, the first regular-season meeting since Game 7 of the Western
Conference finals, a game won by the Lakers in overtime on their way
to their third consecutive title, concluded with the Kings stifling
smiles and Webber holding his forefinger to his lips to shush the
crowd.</LD>
<TE>   "I think we needed this," Webber said.</TE>
<TE>   The rivalry, so tense in May and June, trash talk bouncing up and
down the state for most of the summer, was played without incident.
Rick Fox and Doug Christie let their feelings toward each other be,
though Fox did not touch hands with anyone before the game, and
neither did any of the other players.</TE>
<TE>   Just a game, as it turned out, and another loss for the Lakers,
who afterward spoke of progress but not success.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers are 11-19, half a game out of last place in the Pacific
Division, 11 1/2 games behind the first-place Kings, with 52 games to
play. In an arena whose fans poured out their hearts before the game,
whose emotions rose and fell like the loosened white feathers from
the fringes of the Laker Girl uniforms, the Lakers had leads of seven
points in the first quarter, seven points in the second and 12 points
in the third. Then, they had neither the legs nor the composure on
offense to carry their lead another 15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't had enough positive things happen collectively to go
to that well as a unit," Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings' run was 24-6, from a 65-53 deficit to a 77-71 lead.
Peja Stojakovic had 12 points in the third quarter, Webber had 10 in
the fourth, and then it was done, most of the crowd rising to depart
with still a minute to play.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant and O'Neal each scored 27 points. O'Neal had 17 rebounds,
Bryant 15, matching his career best. But, neither shot well, the
Kings scored 52 of their points from around the rim, and O'Neal, more
than three months from surgery, played most of the game below the
rim.</TE>
<TE>   "Floor bound," Phil Jackson called it.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal left without comment.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not as explosive as he was at one point in his career,
obviously," Jackson said. "But, he's still capable of doing the
things that are going to create defensive overplays, constant double
teams, all types of things that give other people great opportunities
to play basketball around him, regardless of whether he can be
explosive and dunk the ball through the series of four ... arms.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't expect it's due to age. I think it's due to an operation
and whatever he has tying him down in his tennis shoes and all the
other stuff that's going on. I don't expect to see him as active or
as mobile, as physically dominating, as he was four years ago. I
don't think he has as great flexibility in his foot."</TE>
<TE>   By the fourth quarter, the Laker offense was basically Bryant
shooting over two defenders or O'Neal shooting over three, three
others watching.</TE>
<TE>   "For a team as qualified," Jackson said, "we're not doing the
things that make basketball sense .... This is just a matter of
players playing with some insecurities right now. Right now they're
not confident they can do the job."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings wore them out with their high pick and roll, Webber and
Bibby, or Bobby Jackson and Vlade Divac, open jumper or open layup.
They are more athletic, and deeper, though their guard, Bobby
Jackson, suffered a broken finger.</TE>
<TE>   This could have been it, and it seemed Los Angeles knew it, or at
least the part of Los Angeles that crowded into Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal was introduced and he pointed to his family along the first
line of chairs, on the floor. The people howled for Bryant and
pleaded for defense and shouted derogatory things at Divac, who
couldn't be a nicer man.</TE>
<TE>   Late in the third quarter, Robert Horry fouled Webber hard across
the hands and Webber glowered at Horry, which brought the referees
and a few players, but nothing more.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the biggest difference is they are not making shots,"
Sacramento Coach Rick Adelman said. "Kobe and Shaq are making plays,
but I just think it's tough to put a finger on it. I think lately
they just grind things out, they stay in the game; they [used to]
kind of wear you out. They are not doing that right now."</TE>

<HD>McGrady's 46 Points Put the Hurt on Pistons</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tracy McGrady's back was in pain, but watching from the bench hurt
the NBA's leading scorer even more.</LD>
<LD>   Shaking off a lower-back bruise that had sidelined him for the
better part of a week, McGrady scored 46 points to lead the Orlando
Magic over the Detroit Pistons, 104-99, Wednesday at Orlando, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   "It's frustrating sitting out. I hate sitting out," said McGrady,
who finished one point short of his season high and four shy of his
career best. "I wasn't 100%, but I felt good enough to go out there
and play."</LD>
<TE>   McGrady was elbowed in the lower back by the Lakers' Kobe Bryant
on Dec. 15. Since then, he had played only 17 minutes in Orlando's
victory at Utah a week ago.</TE>
<TE>   McGrady made 14 of 26 shots and 18 of 21 free throws against
Detroit, despite pain making him wince and once forcing him to lie
face down on the court during a timeout.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe this rest is a blessing in disguise," Coach Doc Rivers
said. "He got a chance to gather himself and maybe he can go and stay
healthy through the All-Star break. That would be perfect."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Miller scored 15 points for Orlando, which won for the third
time in four games.</TE>
<TE>   Grant Hill was three for 17 from the field, but had 10 points and
15 rebounds for his fifth double-double this season.</TE>
<TE>   "I kind of knew [McGrady] was going to play and play good," said
Hill, who tied his rebounding season high. "When the bright lights
are on, national television, he definitely brings his 'A' game."</TE>
<TE>   Detroit, which lost its second in a row after a six-game winning
streak, got 22 points from Richard Hamilton.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 117, Boston 81 -- The Nets didn't take a break from
winning on their court, even while playing at home on Christmas for
the first time.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets, the NBA's best home team, won their 11th consecutive
game in New Jersey. New Jersey improved to 16-1 at home.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing we want to do first and foremost is protect our home,"
said Richard Jefferson, who scored 22 points. "That's the key. We
have to protect where we play."</TE>
<TE>   The Nets, who shot a season-best 55% from the field, had lost four
in a row against the Celtics in the regular season. Jason Kidd had 11
assists for the Nets.</TE>

<HD>Wizards of MLS Have Their Sights on Moore</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joe-Max Moore could be on his way back to Major League Soccer with
the Kansas City Wizards.</LD>
<LD>   Moore's work visa in England expired, and the 31-year-old American
forward can no longer play for Everton of the Premier League.</LD>
<LD>   "Joe-Max Moore is someone who we are interested in," Wizard
General Manager Curt Johnson said on the Everton Web site. "He's a
great player and he has local ties to the Midwest and Oklahoma. We
have some space under the salary cap, so we are able to look at a guy
like Joe-Max."</LD>
<TE>   Moore hasn't played this season for Everton, and the team did not
apply for a new permit even though seven months remain on his
contract.</TE>
<TE>   He joined Everton in December 1999 from the New England Revolution
of MLS and has scored 10 goals in 64 games. He also has played with
Nuremberg and Saarbruecken in Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Moore has 24 goals in 100 games for the U.S. team, second behind
Eric Wynalda's record 32 goals.</TE>
<TE>   Tennis</TE>
<TE>   Martina Navratilova will play doubles with Russia's Svetlana
Kuznetsova in the women's hard-court tournament that starts Monday at
Gold Coast, Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Navratilova, 46, became the oldest player to win a WTA Tour
doubles title, winning in May at Madrid with Belarus' Natasha
Zvereva.</TE>
<TE>   Navratilova has won 167 singles titles and 165 titles in doubles.</TE>
<TE>   Patty Schnyder of Switzerland, the 1999 Gold Coast champion,
probably will receive the top seeding when the draw is released
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Meghann Shaughnessy of the United States also will be in a field
that includes 1998 winner Ai Sugiyama of Japan, 1997 champion
Nathalie Dechy of France, Elena Bovina of Russia and Barbara Schett
of Austria.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   World Cup skiing champion Stephan Eberharter of Austria was
cleared to compete in a downhill Sunday, returning a week earlier
than anticipated from a Dec. 15 knee injury.</TE>
<TE>   Eberharter, 33, completed a trial run Wednesday without pain.
Doctors cleared the five-time winner this season to race at Bormio,
Italy, the Austrian Ski Federation said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really terrific," Eberharter told Austria Press Assn.
"Every so often I felt a little bit of pulling, but otherwise had no
pain anymore. It went great."</TE>
<TE>   Eberharter was hurt when he crashed during a giant slalom at Val
d'Isere, France, and doctors didn't believe he would be ready for
Bormio.</TE>
<TE>   World Boxing Organization middleweight champion Harry Simon of
Namibia broke an arm and a leg during a head-on collision last month
in an accident in which three Belgian tourists, including a
22-month-old girl, died.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, 30, has been charged with culpable homicide in the Nov. 21
accident near the beach resort of Langstrand, Namibia.</TE>
<TE>   Simon is scheduled to defend his title in March, but WBO officials
are awaiting the outcome of legal proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   According to witnesses, Simon's car crashed into the Belgians'
pickup truck. Police said blood samples were taken from Simon to
determine if he had been drinking.</TE>
<TE>   In April 2001, Simon was in a car accident in which two Namibians
died. The boxer's blood samples disappeared after that accident and
the case has not been resolved.</TE>
<TE>   Two yachts withdrew after collisions and two men fell overboard in
a dramatic start today to a race from Sydney, Australia, to Hobart,
on the island state of Tasmania.</TE>
<TE>   Trumpcard retired after colliding with the bigger Loki, and
Valheru turned back after colliding with Peugeot Racing. Crew members
of Valheru and Trumpcard fell overboard but were recovered quickly.</TE>
<TE>   At the start of the event, rain pelted the 57 entries in the
630-nautical-mile race. The skipper of Trumpcard filed a protest over
the collision.</TE>

<HD>Griese Questions His Denver Future</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brian Griese questioned his future with the Denver Broncos on
Wednesday after learning he will not start at quarterback against
Arizona even if his sprained left knee is sound.</LD>
<LD>   Bronco Coach Mike Shanahan said Steve Beuerlein would start
Sunday. The news left Griese dejected and somber at his weekly news
conference.</LD>
<LD>   "I've always had passion for the game," Griese said. "I wouldn't
do this if I didn't have passion for the game. It's just that this
isn't fun for me. I don't know who it would be fun for. I don't think
that anybody in my situation would have a good time sitting here on
Christmas talking about this kind of stuff. But that's my life, and
so I'll find a way to go forward."</LD>
<TE>   Shanahan said he made the decision based on Denver's 28-16 loss to
Oakland on Sunday, and not on how Griese fits into Denver's future
plans.</TE>
<TE>   The Broncos would have had a chance to win the AFC West title had
they defeated the Raiders, but fell behind, 21-0, after Griese had
two passes intercepted in the first quarter. His quarterback rating
was 14.2 before Bill Romanowski knocked him out in the second
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Beuerlein threw for 288 yards and a touchdown, leading the Broncos
to 16 points before the Raiders pulled away.</TE>
<TE>   "When a guy really steps up and performs like [Beuerlein] did, and
Brian didn't have one of his better games, I feel that it gives us
the best chance to win by giving that person an opportunity to
start," Shanahan said.</TE>
<TE>   "And we're talking about this game. You don't know anything beyond
this game. My job is to give our football team the best chance to win
this weekend."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rob Johnson practiced with the first team and will be Tampa Bay's
starting quarterback against the Chicago Bears if Brad Johnson can't
play Sunday night because of a severe lower-back bruise.</TE>
<TE>   The Buccaneers (11-4) are out of contention for home-field
advantage throughout the NFC playoffs. However, they can be seeded
No. 2 if they beat the Bears and the Green Bay Packers lose to the
New York Jets earlier in the day.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Running back Priest Holmes is out for Kansas City's regular-season
finale against Oakland on Saturday. Holmes, who is two touchdowns
away from the NFL season record of 26, injured his hip at Denver on
Dec. 15.... Green Bay signed kick returner Eric Metcalf, a three-time
Pro Bowl selection, and tackle Jeff Blackshear as free agents.</TE>

<HD>Now Is Time to Separate Men From Boys</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's time for a conference call.</LD>
<LD>   Eleven teams have survived into late December unbeaten -- Alabama,
Butler, Clemson, Connecticut, Creighton, Duke, Georgetown, Illinois,
Pittsburgh, St. Joseph's and Wake Forest -- but nobody expects any of
them to make it through the rigors of conference play unscathed.</LD>
<LD>   With the old family squabbles just ahead, here's a look at the
landscape in selected leagues:</LD>
<TE>   ATLANTIC COAST</TE>
<TE>   Top team: Duke. The rather untested Blue Devils -- sorry, the UCLA
game doesn't count -- figure to get better. And they're already No. 1
in the ESPN/USA Today coaches' poll after Arizona's stumble without
Luke Walton against Louisiana State. Get to know freshmen J.J.
Redick, Shavlik Randolph and Shelden Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Troubled team: Maryland. The defending champions aren't the same
group that won the title, and they're already 0-3 against teams
currently in the rankings, with losses to Indiana, Notre Dame and
Florida. But slow starts are nothing new to the Terrapins. "When we
have a stretch like this, everybody thinks we're going to go 8-20 or
something ridiculous like that," slumping shooting guard Drew
Nicholas said. The Terrapins will manage to stay in the ACC's upper
echelon, but it's hard to say where.</TE>
<TE>   Intriguing team: North Carolina. Wake Forest and Clemson are
undefeated and North Carolina State is another fringe top-25 team.
But it's the Tar Heels -- the team that did go 8-20 last season --
who bear watching as freshmen Rashad McCants, Raymond Felton and Sean
May navigate their first ACC season.</TE>
<TE>   BIG EAST</TE>
<TE>   Top team: Pittsburgh. The Panthers are poised to spend some time
at No. 1 in a season when no team is likely to hang onto the spot for
too long. Point guard Brandin Knight leads five starters back from
the top-10 team that was upset by Kent State in the Sweet 16. The Big
East's West Division is the stronger, with Pittsburgh facing
challenges from Notre Dame and possibly Syracuse and Georgetown. The
East should belong to Connecticut and its rebounder and shot-blocker,
Emeka Okafor.</TE>
<TE>   Troubled team: Miami. The Hurricanes are only 4-4 after going 24-8
last season, but Darius Rice remains a tantalizing talent.</TE>
<TE>   Intriguing team: Notre Dame. That Irish sweep of Maryland,
Marquette and Texas announced that Notre Dame basketball matters
again. The only loss is to Creighton -- which might mean the Bluejays
are really good.</TE>
<TE>   BIG TEN</TE>
<TE>   Top team: Is it Indiana, coming off a trip to the Final Four with
its only loss so far to Kentucky, after Coach Mike Davis boiled over?
Or is it Illinois, with freshman point guard Dee Brown helping Brian
Cook and the rest of the Illini blow out North Carolina and Missouri?</TE>
<TE>   Troubled team: Michigan. With a hunk of their history purged in
the Fab Five NCAA scandal, the Wolverines haven't been writing new
chapters by losing to Central Michigan and Western Michigan, though
they've recovered some lately. Note to UCLA: It would be a good idea
to win this one Saturday at Pauley.</TE>
<TE>   Intriguing team: Michigan State. Losses to Villanova and Oklahoma
State raised doubts, but winning at Kentucky suggests this team might
give Oklahoma a run Jan. 4.</TE>
<TE>   BIG 12</TE>
<TE>   Top team: Oklahoma. Kansas lost its claim, at least temporarily,
with losses to North Carolina, Florida and Oregon. We'll soon find
out how good Oklahoma is, despite losing Aaron McGhee from their
Final Four team: The Sooners, whose only loss is to Alabama, play
top-25 teams Mississippi State and Michigan State in the next nine
days.</TE>
<TE>   Troubled team: Kansas. It's a little bit of a stretch to say the
Jayhawks are in trouble, but they are by the standards in Lawrence,
Kan. The easy victory over UCLA helped ease the strain, but a good
conference start and a strong showing against Arizona on Jan. 25 are
important for a team once ranked No. 2 after reaching the Final Four
last season.</TE>
<TE>   Intriguing team: Texas Tech. Andre Emmett, the high-scoring star
of Bob Knight's Red Raider team, should challenge the Kansas and
Oklahoma stars for Big 12 player of the year.</TE>
<TE>   CONFERENCE USA</TE>
<TE>   Top team: Marquette. Dwyane Wade plays like a pro and has scored
20 points or more in six of eight games. And under Tom Crean, a Tom
Izzo disciple, Marquette plays defense and rebounds too.</TE>
<TE>   Troubled team: Cincinnati. It's hard to tell which way the
Bearcats are going. They blew out Oregon but followed that by losing
to Clemson.</TE>
<TE>   Intriguing team: Louisville. After his team won the last four
games by an average of almost 33 points, Coach Rick Pitino scheduled
two-a-day practices -- even on Christmas Day -- heading into
Saturday's showdown with Kentucky. Pitino isn't the only former
Wildcat zeroed in on this game. Center Marvin Stone, who transferred
last season, recorded double-doubles in his first two games as a
Cardinal leading into the Louisville-Kentucky game.</TE>
<TE>   MISSOURI VALLEY</TE>
<TE>   Top team: Creighton. The Bluejays are really the only MVC team to
talk about -- and the only team to beat Notre Dame. Kyle Korver's
bunch is a proven NCAA threat after upsetting Florida in the first
round last season.</TE>
<TE>   For what it's worth, the Jeff Sagarin computer ratings for USA
Today recently put Creighton at No. 1. That seems a stretch, but the
Bluejays aren't to be taken lightly.</TE>
<TE>   MOUNTAIN WEST</TE>
<TE>   Top team: It's wide open, now that Wyoming's Marcus Bailey is out
for the season because of a knee injury. Brigham Young, Colorado
State, Nevada Las Vegas, Utah and Wyoming all have hopes.</TE>
<TE>   Troubled team: New Mexico. The only good news lately is
extraordinary: Guard Senque Carey, partially paralyzed for a time
after an on-court fall, is walking again.</TE>
<TE>   Intriguing team: San Diego State. By March, the mix of players who
originally signed elsewhere -- Evan Burns from UCLA and Travis Hanour
from Arizona among them -- might be a real threat.</TE>
<TE>   PACIFIC 10</TE>
<TE>   Top team: Arizona. The Pac-10 lacks the depth of recent years,
with Arizona and Oregon clearly a step ahead of everyone else. The
Wildcats were gutty without Walton, edging Texas on big plays by
Jason Gardner, then coming from 15 down in the second half against
Louisiana State before losing by one.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona can't weather the Pac-10 without Walton, but he is
expected back from his ankle injury soon.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon, despite its confounding blowout loss to Cincinnati,
appears to be the only team to challenge Arizona -- and the biggest
game is early, when Arizona plays at Oregon on Jan. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Troubled team: UCLA. It's too obvious to discuss.</TE>
<TE>   Intriguing team: Stanford. Who can figure out the Cardinal?
Stanford beat Xavier and Florida, then lost to North Carolina,
Montana and Richmond -- the last two at home.</TE>
<TE>   A telling game will come Saturday against Gonzaga.</TE>
<TE>   SOUTHEASTERN</TE>
<TE>   Top team: Alabama. Former UCLA assistant Mark Gottfried's team
ascended to No. 1 in the Associated Press poll for the first time in
school history after Arizona's loss to Louisiana State.</TE>
<TE>   Troubled team: Florida. The Gators have a fabulous freshman in
Matt Walsh, but they needed overtime to beat Miami and had to rally
from 10 down to beat Charleston Southern.</TE>
<TE>   Intriguing teams: LSU, Georgia. LSU knocked Arizona from the
unbeatens and has a find in former junior college player of the year
Jaime Lloreda, a Panamanian.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia is on the rise now that center Steve Thomas has returned
from academic ineligibility.</TE>
<TE>   WESTERN ATHLETIC</TE>
<TE>   Top team: Tulsa. Since the start of the 1999-2000 season, Tulsa
has won 90 games -- second in the nation behind Duke's 100.
Cincinnati is third with 89 and Gonzaga has 88.</TE>
<TE>   Guard Jason Parker has been leading the way for a team that has
lost only to Kansas.</TE>
<TE>   Troubled team: Texas El Paso. Already struggling, UTEP has lost
senior forward Roy Smallwood for the season because of a knee injury.</TE>
<TE>   Intriguing team: Hawaii has been receiving votes in the ESPN/USA
Today poll.</TE>
<TE>   WEST COAST</TE>
<TE>   Top team: Gonzaga has been a puzzlement. Guard Blake Stepp has
excellent scoring ability and the front line is versatile.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulldogs have lost to Indiana, Kentucky and Georgia -- no
shame in those -- but more shockingly, needed overtime to defeat
Washington and Washington State and had to come from behind against
Eastern Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Troubled team: Pepperdine. The Waves once looked like an NCAA
tournament team, but health concerns have wiped out that promise.
Forward Glen McGowan is out for the season because of a blood clot in
his arm, and center Will Kimble is out for the season because of a
heart condition likely to end his career.</TE>
<TE>   Intriguing team: Gonzaga -- despite San Diego's early bid with an
upset of UCLA that no longer looks so remarkable.</TE>

<HD>Division I-A Football Isn't Place for Female Kicker,
Despite Admirable Goal</HD>

<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>It was the wrong thing to do for all the right reasons.</LD>
<LD>   Katie Hnida became the first woman to play in an NCAA Division I-A
football game Wednesday when she attempted an extra point for New
Mexico against UCLA in the Las Vegas Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   The kick was low, it was wobbly and it was blocked by Bruin
linebacker Brandon Chillar. The kick never had a chance, not even
close. If Chillar's hand had not hit the ball, any one of another six
hands would have.</LD>
<TE>   Women are not strong enough to play big-time college football, not
even as kickers. Making extra points in practice is not the same as
facing athletes such as Chillar, a 6-foot-3, 234-pound man, running
at your face.</TE>
<TE>   Hnida is not small. She is 5-9, 150 pounds. But on this field,
when she trotted in from the sidelines, Hnida disappeared into the
huddle. Her waist and thighs and chest are tinier than any of the
men's.</TE>
<TE>   New Mexico Coach Rocky Long says Hnida earned her chance to become
the first woman to play in a Division I-A game.</TE>
<TE>   Long says Hnida works hard, practices hard, puts up with the
hardships, of dressing by herself, of walking away from her teammates
after games to take a solitary shower, of hearing the whispered
comments and disparaging insults.</TE>
<TE>   She has never complained, Long says. She has never asked for
favors or special treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Hnida considers Long a special kind of hero, a man of "courage and
integrity," she says.</TE>
<TE>   When Heather Sue Mercer sued former Duke football coach Fred
Goldsmith for not giving Mercer a fair chance to make the Blue Devil
team, the suit was considered an insurmountable hurdle for other
women who might want to try out for a man's team. What would be the
upside for a coach who decided the female wasn't good enough if he
was afraid to cut her for fear of a lawsuit?</TE>
<TE>   But even after an unpleasant experience at Colorado, where Hnida
played for a year, she wasn't able to give up her dream.</TE>
<TE>   Hnida says she belongs on a Division I-A football team, that she
makes all her extra points in practice, that her leg strength is
fine, that she is not intimidated by men twice her size and speed
running at her. Long gave her a chance to try out as a walk-on. Hnida
took the chance.</TE>
<TE>   So this wasn't what it seemed at first -- a stunt, a cheap holiday
trick. You know, put the football chick into the Christmas Day game,
a second-level bowl game where the play is mostly for fun and maybe a
little pride.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN cameras could focus on Hnida's blond ponytail and blood-red
fingernails. Less attention had to be paid to a mostly dreadful
football game.</TE>
<TE>   It could be pointed out that Hnida was homecoming queen in high
school.</TE>
<TE>   And when the kick failed, there were some giggles, some head
shaking. What was Long thinking? What if Hnida's miss had cost the
Lobos the victory? What if New Mexico lost by a point instead of
27-13? Was it worth embarrassing Hnida for some outrageous publicity?</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody who says, just because of this one miss, that I can't
play or shouldn't play, they have stuck their foot in their mouth and
they can take it out when I'm the starter next year," Hnida says.
"Because I'll be back next year and I'm going to win the job."</TE>
<TE>   She won't. She can't. Football is not the place where women can be
competitive with men.</TE>
<TE>   Whether anybody likes it or not, whether it's fair or not, men are
bigger, stronger, usually faster. Men have more leg strength, 99.9%
of them, and will be able to kick higher and farther.</TE>
<TE>   Hnida was asked if she thought her appearance in this game made a
statement, if it would prove to be a jumping-off point for other
women, that more little girls would want to grow up and play college
football.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," Hnida said. "That's not why I'm doing it. I'm not
doing this to be a role model or anything. I'm doing it because I
want to be a football player."</TE>
<TE>   And certainly in her career, both at Colorado and New Mexico,
Hnida has done nothing to draw attention to herself. She has tried to
stay in the background. Once she made the Lobos as a walk-on, Hnida
has refused interviews saying there was nothing to talk about until
she got into a game.</TE>
<TE>   At Chatfield High in Littleton, Colo., Hnida made 83 of 87
extra-point attempts and four of five field-goal tries in her three
years on the varsity. She knows that college is different, that the
speed of the game is 100 times faster than high school.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I hit it good," Hnida said of her first college kick.
"I hit it in the middle. I was shocked when I saw [Chillar's] hand up
there. Because when I dreamed of this, it always was the same ending.
I made the kick."</TE>
<TE>   Dreams don't always have happy endings. Since no one on New Mexico
has kicked a field goal longer than 32 yards and since Long had used
three other kickers this year (who missed two extra points), no one
was hurt by Hnida's attempt. But whether intended or not, Hnida's
kick was more stunt than sport.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wish she had made it," UCLA punter Nate Fikse said,
"because there will be people who will say she shouldn't be out
there."</TE>
<TE>   It's not that she shouldn't. It's just that there seems to be no
point.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997 Liz Heaston kicked two extra points for Willamette, then
an NAIA school. A year ago Ashley Martin kicked four extra points for
Division I-AA Jacksonville State. Neither became a starter, and Hnida
won't either. Long will look for other kickers, stronger kickers.
Hnida will stay on the sidelines. Window dressing, by herself.</TE>

<HD>Sooners Given Royal Treatment</HD>
<DH>Rose Bowl court, officials greet Oklahoma contingent upon
their arrival on Christmas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Springer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Lakers were engaged in an early-season showdown at Staples
Center. UCLA had played in a bowl game earlier in the day in Las
Vegas. USC is heading to Miami today for a Jan. 2 Orange Bowl matchup
with Iowa in what many consider the true Rose Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   But when the Oklahoma Sooner football team and its supporters,
five buses strong, arrived at their Century City hotel Wednesday
night, they had no reason to think they weren't at the center of
L.A.'s sports universe and that the Rose Bowl wasn't still the
granddaddy of all the bowls.</LD>
<LD>   The Rose Bowl committee pulled off that illusion by showing up in
force, even though it was Christmas night, to greet the Sooners, who
will face Washington State on New Year's Day.</LD>
<TE>   Also on hand to welcome the Sooners were Rose Bowl queen Alexandra
Wucetich and the six members of her court.</TE>
<TE>   The players were "rosed" -- rose stickers placed on shirts and
jackets -- and all the proper speeches were made. Oklahoma Coach Bob
Stoops responded with the expected reverential reaction.</TE>
<TE>   "Our school has seven national championships and 38 conference
championships," he said. "What we don't have is a Rose Bowl
championship and that's what we're here to get."</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl committee members nodded with approval.</TE>
<TE>   Ahead of them, the Sooners have the Beef Bowl gorge-athon at
Lawry's, a trip to Disneyland and sights to see.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd like to go to Venice Beach," said tight end Trent Smith.
"I've never been to California and a lot of the other guys haven't
either. We haven't been around a lot of water."</TE>
<TE>   However, many of the players have been involved in important
games.</TE>
<TE>   This is Oklahoma's fourth consecutive bowl appearance, including a
13-2 triumph over Florida State in the 2001 Orange Bowl that gave the
Sooners a national championship.</TE>
<TE>   For those Sooners still around, that was the granddaddy of them
all.</TE>

<LD>LAS VEGAS -- A spin by punt returner Craig Bragg here, a ricochet to
safety Jarrad Page there, and Ed Kezirian retires with the best
winning percentage among UCLA coaches.</LD>
<LD>   One game as interim coach filling the breach between the departure
of Bob Toledo and arrival of Karl Dorrell.</LD>
<LD>   One 27-13 victory over New Mexico on Wednesday in the Las Vegas
Bowl.</LD>
<TE>   One tub of ice water dumped on his head.</TE>
<TE>   Kezirian never did break out the trademark white towel he normally
waves, although he could have used it to wipe his soaking face.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always wanted to be the richest man in Las Vegas," he said.
"Today, I am."</TE>
<TE>   Less fortunate are the nine assistants who probably coached their
last game at UCLA, which finished 8-5 despite playing 22 freshmen and
losing senior quarterback Cory Paus to a season-ending injury in the
seventh game.</TE>
<TE>   For about three hours the assistants set aside the anxiety and
uncertainty to do what they do best -- coach a football game.</TE>
<TE>   "[The players] didn't have to listen to us, but they were fun to
coach today," defensive coordinator Phil Snow said. "On the sideline,
nobody would have known there was no head coach."</TE>
<TE>   And looking at the score, nobody would have known the UCLA offense
was so impotent. Bruin defense and special teams made the big plays,
from Bragg's 74-yard scoring punt return to Page's 29-yard scoring
interception return to Nate Fikse's two field goals and booming
punts.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA forced three turnovers and held New Mexico (7-7) to 92 yards
rushing -- less than half its average.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew our offense would take time to get going, and put the
pressure on [the defense]," said linebacker Brandon Chillar, who
recovered two fumbles and blocked an extra-point attempt. Freshman
quarterbacks Drew Olson and Matt Moore had difficulty deciphering New
Mexico's 3-3-5 defense, and UCLA managed only 71 total yards in a 6-6
first half.</TE>
<TE>   Lobo Coach Rocky Long, a former UCLA defensive coordinator,
brought the quirky defense to Albuquerque five years ago in addition
to a gimmick-filled offense.</TE>
<TE>   He drained his playbook like Santa Claus emptying toys from a
sack, but nothing worked until the Bruins went to a prevent defense
late in the fourth quarter. Freshman tailback DonTrell Moore entered
with 1,117 yards but added only 17 to the total in 14 carries.</TE>
<TE>   "We were rusty today," Long said. "DonTrell got nicked early and
never really got going. And they really played well on defense."</TE>
<TE>   A fumble by Moore on his first carry set up a 49-yard field goal
by Fikse less than five minutes into the game.</TE>
<TE>   But New Mexico answered on a 55-yard interception return by Desmar
Black.</TE>
<TE>   Olson, who jammed his right thumb and played only the first
quarter, expected Bragg to run an out pattern and when the receiver
went deep, the pass went right to Black.</TE>
<TE>   Katie Hnida, the Lobos' third-string kicker, tried the extra-point
kick, becoming the first woman to appear in a Division I-A game. But
the kick was low and Chillar blocked it.</TE>
<TE>   In the second quarter, Moore replaced Olson and directed a
15-play, 57-yard drive that ended in a 39-yard field goal by Fikse.</TE>
<TE>   "We were going to keep pounding on the rock," Kezirian said. "We
were waiting for the opportunity to create turnovers. Our patience
might have seemed like we were lethargic, but it paid off."</TE>
<TE>   Bragg provided a boost early in the third quarter with his scoring
punt return that put UCLA ahead, 13-6. He was hit hard in the middle
of the field, spun, raced to the sideline and burst past the coverage
so quickly he raised a celebratory finger at the 30-yard line.</TE>
<TE>   "We talked at halftime about making something happen and I took it
upon myself to make a big play," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bruin tailback Tyler Ebell, who was held to 17 yards rushing in
the first half, began to find holes in the third quarter, but holding
penalties thwarted two consecutive drives.</TE>
<TE>   It was up to the defense to secure the victory. Less than a minute
into the fourth quarter a pass bounced off the back of Lobo tight end
Zach Cresap and into the hands of Page, who raced for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "The momentum switched," Page said. "Their crowd was talking, and
when I scored our crowd erupted."</TE>
<TE>   It might have seemed that way because Page's touchdown came
directly in front of the small contingent of UCLA fans that occupied
one corner of Sam Boyd Stadium. The game drew only 22,584, though
there were 30,324 tickets sold.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins didn't care about the empty seats. They wanted to erase
the memories of landslide losses to USC and Washington State in their
last two regular-season games, and they did so.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA increased its victory total three years in a row, from four
to six to seven to eight, and the modest improvement was not lost on
a plucky group of seniors who never beat USC, never won a
championship, but never stopped playing hard.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not such a big bowl game but it means a lot to win for our
missing head coach [Toledo] and for coach Snow," said linebacker
Marcus Reese, who had eight tackles, including three for losses.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to play hard for our coaches."</TE>
<TE>   In two years, Snow transformed the UCLA defense from a
laughingstock to the team's strength. He figures that won't be enough
for him to keep his job. So like the veteran players, he just wanted
his last Bruin memory to be one of triumph.</TE>
<TE>   "This was for the seniors, we are all going out together," he
said. "No matter where we see each other, we can always talk about
[this game.]"</TE>

<HD>Hnida Earns Plaudits Despite the Miss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>LAS VEGAS -- As groundbreaking moments go, it was a touch
embarrassing. But when Katie Hnida trotted onto the field, blond
ponytail flopping in the breeze, and tried an extra point after New
Mexico's first-quarter touchdown, it marked the first time a woman
had played in a Division I-A game.</LD>
<LD>   Hnida, who made 83 of 87 extra points in high school, booted a low
line drive that was partially blocked by Brandon Chillar and sailed
under the crossbar.</LD>
<LD>   "My heart went out to her," UCLA backup kicker Chris Griffith
said. "I think it's cool she's playing football."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Griffith, a senior, had his own milestone to consider. When he
lost his job to Nate Fikse at midseason, he had tied the UCLA career
record for points after touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   It took more than two months, but Griffith broke the mark of 135
held by John Lee by kicking the conversion after Jarrad Page's
interception return for a touchdown early in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "That had been lingering for the last six games as the one thing I
could get," Griffith said. "I'm glad I got the chance to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Fikse, also a senior, continued his excellent late-season kicking,
making his only two field-goal tries and averaging 44.9 yards on
eight punts. He pinned the Lobos inside the 20-yard line four times.</TE>
<TE>   He made a 49-yard field goal to open the scoring and added a
39-yarder in the second quarter, giving him 12 in a row since winning
the job. He missed one long attempt early in the season.</TE>
<TE>   "The first field goal [Wednesday] gave us all confidence," he
said. "Taking the lead was important."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tailback Tyler Ebell fell short of reaching 1,000 yards rushing,
gaining 70 in 25 carries to give him 994. He was trying to become
only the third freshman in Pacific 10 Conference history to reach
1,000.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't thinking about it until late in the game when they told
me how many I needed," he said. "It's OK because we won."</TE>
<TE>   Ebell gained only 17 yards in 10 first-half carries, but the line
began opening bigger holes in the second half. He had five rushes of
more than five yards in the second half and scored the last Bruin
touchdown from one yard on fourth down with 10:40 to play.</TE>
<TE>   "It was congested in there early," he said. "But our line wore out
their defensive front and we took over in the second half."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defensive tackle Rodney Leisle, a junior, is leaning toward
leaving UCLA for the NFL but said he will wait until receiving an
evaluation from pro scouts before making a decision.</TE>
<TE>   He said that a strong pitch from incoming Coach Karl Dorrell could
make a difference.</TE>
<TE>   "That would sway me," he said. "It's a hard decision."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dorrell will meet Friday and Saturday with the seven UCLA
assistants who have expressed a desire to remain -- Phil Snow, Kelly
Skipper, Ron Caragher, Mark Weber, Gary Bernardi, Todd Littlejohn and
Don Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tight end Mike Seidman is the only Bruin invited to play in the
Senior Bowl, but several of his teammates will play in other
postseason all-star games.</TE>
<TE>   Tackle Mike Saffer, cornerback Ricky Manning and  Fikse will play
in the East-West Shrine Game. Manning will also play in the Hula
Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Saffer and fellow tackle Bryce Bohlander will play in the Gridiron
Bowl, a game that matches Florida players against the rest of the
country.</TE>
<TE>   Bohlander, defensive end Rusty Williams and cornerback Joe Hunter
will play in the Paradise All-Star Game in St. George, Utah.</TE>

<HD>Rested Trojans Hit Road Today</HD>

<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After two days off, USC players and staff will reconvene this morning
and depart for Florida to begin final preparations for the Jan. 2
Orange Bowl against Iowa.</LD>
<LD>   The Trojans will leave Los Angeles International Airport at noon
on a chartered flight that is scheduled to arrive in Fort Lauderdale
about 8 p.m. EST. Iowa also is scheduled to arrive today in Florida.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this week, Coach Pete Carroll said about 12 to 15 players
from other states or areas outside Southern California would be
allowed to travel to Florida on their own.</LD>
<TE>   Along with daily practices, USC players will go on a range of
outings in the Miami area. They will visit a hospital, take a
chartered fishing trip, go to an amusement park and attend an NBA
game between the Miami Heat and Atlanta Hawks.</TE>
<TE>   "It should be a lot of fun," senior linebacker Mike Pollard said.
"But the main reason we're going down there is to win a ballgame."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   All-American safety Troy Polamalu looked like his old self during
practices leading up to the break.</TE>
<TE>   In USC's practice on Monday, he intercepted a pass during a mock
game and eluded several tacklers as he traversed the field from
sideline to sideline.</TE>
<TE>   Polamalu said there is still residual discomfort from the high
right-ankle sprain that he suffered on Oct. 5 against Washington
State. But he has benefited from the reduced workload since the
regular-season finale against Notre Dame on Nov. 30.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're out there trying to make a play, you don't think
about anything other than that," Polamalu said. "I think I'll be more
than ready when it's time for the game."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Freshman linebacker Oscar Lua, who had knee surgery on Tuesday to
repair a torn anterior cruciate ligament, was scheduled to be
released from the hospital Wednesday. Because of discomfort, Lua was
held overnight and will probably be released today. Lua is expected
to miss spring practice but be ready for training camp in August.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC is the second Pacific 10 Conference school to play in the
Orange Bowl. Washington defeated Oklahoma, 28-17, in the 1985
game.... Neither USC nor Iowa has won a game in Florida. Both are
0-4. USC lost to Miami in 1966, Florida in 1982, Auburn in the 1987
Citrus Bowl and Florida State in 1998.</TE>

<LD>SAN JOSE -- Teemu Selanne was like a kid on a long car trip,
clamoring from the back seat, "Are we there yet? Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?"</LD>
<LD>   The San Jose Sharks were rumored to be negotiating with Ron Wilson
to take over as coach. Three days went by after Darryl Sutter was
fired and each morning Selanne would corner one of the Sharks' media
relations employees and ask, "Any news yet? Any news yet? Any news
yet?"</LD>
<LD>   When it finally was announced that Wilson was a Left Coast coach
again, his favorite kid was beyond giddy.</LD>
<TE>   "Oh yeah, I was happy," Selanne said. "Are you kidding?"</TE>
<TE>   The two were close during the little more than one season they
were together with the Mighty Ducks. They reached the second round of
the playoffs -- the first and only time Anaheim has advanced that far
-- in 1996-97.</TE>
<TE>   After that season, Wilson was fired by then-team president Tony
Tavares, ushering in a mighty decay of the Ducks. Selanne was shipped
north in 2000-01, in a trade to San Jose. Those moves were bookends
of the Ducks' decline.</TE>
<TE>   Now Wilson and Selanne are together again and the ties still bind.
The Ducks get a look at this reunion tour today, when they play the
Sharks in San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   "The first day he walked into practice, he yelled, 'Ali' at me."
Selanne said, with his constant smirk. "I yelled back, 'Tyson.' When
we were with the Ducks, he told me Muhammad Ali in his prime could
beat Mike Tyson in his prime. There is no way. We picked up that
argument five years later.</TE>
<TE>   "I have so much respect for Ron, and I know how good he can be.
I'm so excited to be playing for him again."</TE>
<TE>   Whether it works out for the better this time remains to be seen.
Wilson wasn't brought in for mutual-admiration banter with Selanne.
He's behind the bench, management hopes, to get the Sharks back on
track.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what drives me," Wilson said. "I'd rather have my name on
the Stanley Cup than on a headstone somewhere trying to get there."</TE>
<TE>   Sutter had nurtured the Sharks along, improving the team's record
each of the past five seasons. They reached the conference semifinals
last season, losing to Colorado in seven games, which merely led to
higher expectations. One hockey publication picked the Sharks to win
the Stanley Cup.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of key holdouts and a poor start left Sutter as the fall
guy and cast Wilson in the role of savior. Wilson had, after all,
guided Washington to the Stanley Cup finals in 1997-98.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, there is no doubt that this team is built, but I wouldn't
be coaching the team if there wasn't something wrong," said Wilson,
who was fired by the Capitals after last season. "I don't know what
the best word is for it, 'underachieving'? I'm just trying to get a
feel for how these players play and try to mesh that in with my
philosophies."</TE>
<TE>   There is a key element in that equation: Selanne.</TE>
<TE>   "Teemu understands my personality and may be able, I suppose, to
forewarn guys about what I don't like and about my personality,
whatever my personality is," Wilson said. "Teemu knows me really
well."</TE>
<TE>   But is the Bay Area ready for this version of Butch and Sundance?</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's going to be a happy reunion," the Ducks' Paul Kariya
said.</TE>
<TE>   So far, it has been. The Sharks, 9-12-2-2 when Sutter was fired,
are 4-3-1-1 since Wilson took over.</TE>
<TE>   It was hard to blame Sutter. Evgeni Nabokov, one of the NHL's top
goalies, and Brad Stuart, a staunch defenseman, were holdouts when
the season began, which severely affected the team. That was General
Manager Dean Lombardi's area. But Lombardi wasn't going to fire
himself, and he couldn't trade 23 players.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson was living life at a leisurely pace in Hilton Head, S.C.,
enjoying rounds of golf between television assignments as a hockey
commentator, when the call came.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure how I felt," Wilson said. "I was, I guess, hoping I
could get back into the game quickly, but I wanted to make sure the
situation was going to be right for me. On the other hand, not to be
flippant, but as some would say, beggars can't be choosers."</TE>
<TE>   So Wilson flew to San Jose, where there were eager faces waiting.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if it is a fresh start, because we have put
ourselves in such a hole," center Patrick Marleau said. "But it's a
kick in the pants to get things going."</TE>
<TE>   As for it being a welcome change, well, Shark-speak was as about
as cryptic as pig Latin.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard for me to compare Ron and Darryl without saying
something bad about somebody," Marleau said.</TE>
<TE>   Sutter and Selanne butted heads at times last season. After one
game early last season, Sutter told Selanne that he could "get in
your Porsche and drive back to Anaheim."</TE>
<TE>   Selanne's reply? "The Porsche is in Finland."</TE>
<TE>   They later smoothed out their differences, but Selanne is a
happier camper these days, no matter how diplomatic he tries to be.
He is averaging more than 20 minutes a game and has four goals and 11
points in nine games since Wilson took over.</TE>
<TE>   "Their styles are totally different," Selanne said. "Darryl is
more about the system and you stick with that. Ron tries to create
more, using your imagination and using your speed. Both coaches have
had some success. So it'll be interesting how good we can be here."</TE>
<TE>   Selanne has been through coaching changes before, and none was
more difficult than when Wilson was canned by the Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks had just completed the climb from expansion team to
respectable organization, having reached the second round of the
Stanley Cup playoffs. Then Tavares got involved and ordered Wilson
fired.</TE>
<TE>   The backlash was immediate, although Tavares wasn't there to take
the initial heat. He skipped the news conference, then explained
later that he was not hiding, adding: "I was not eating Snickers bars
and soaking my feet in Ron's blood."</TE>
<TE>   "Some people in the organization thought Teemu and Paul [Kariya]
were being used too much at the expense of other players," Wilson
said. "So they made a change. That was fine. I didn't agree with it.
In the end, some people found out they were wrong. Not so much in the
coaching part, but in the philosophy of the type of team they had."</TE>
<TE>   The reasons for the firing mean little now. According to sources
who were in the organization, it was Tavares vs. Wilson ... and
continued to be even with a continent between them.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson landed in Washington and took the Capitals to the Stanley
Cup final his first season. The Ducks, who played without Kariya much
of the season, finished next to last in the Western Conference.</TE>
<TE>   A few days after the Capitals had reached the Eastern Conference
final, the Ducks fired all their assistant coaches. A few days after
the Capitals had reached the Stanley Cup finals, the Ducks fired
Pierre Page, who had replaced Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   Selanne had a rink-side seat through it all.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't believe Ron got fired," Selanne said. "He did an
extremely good job. The playoff run we had, it was perfect. We were
close to being a very good team. All of a sudden they fire Ron. Then
there were eight guys from that playoff team left the next training
camp. I said, 'Where'd everybody disappear? I thought we had a good
run going here?' "</TE>
<TE>   Selanne's turn came in March 2001. By then, the Ducks had long
gone from promising franchise to league punch line. Pierre Gauthier,
the general manager at the time, said he would not trade Selanne,
then did.</TE>
<TE>   "It was frustrating," Selanne said. "You look at management, they
were not doing anything to make it to the next level."</TE>
<TE>   It is a different Duck team that the Sharks will see today.
Tavares and Gauthier are gone. Only five players on the Anaheim
roster played under Wilson. Only nine who played with Selanne remain.</TE>
<TE>   The change has been for the better. The Ducks, unlike the Sharks,
are currently in a playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't seen Paul more excited about a season for three or four
years," Selanne said. "I was skating with him before the season and
it was the first time I saw the fire in his eyes in a long time. He
deserves that."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, what Selanne thinks he deserves, he has ... Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   "I think with Ron, we got to take off," Selanne said. "It's time."</TE>
