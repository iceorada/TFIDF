<LD>Dump a load of lemons on Toby Keith's front lawn and the country
singer would likely have a lemonade stand open for business within
minutes.</LD>
<LD>   The beefy Oklahoma singer and writer of such hits as "How Do You
Like Me Now?" and his current single "Courtesy of the Red, White and
Blue (The Angry American)" has turned his expulsion from ABC-TV's
Independence Day special into a rallying point for his fans that may
translate into big sales for his new album, "Unleashed."</LD>
<LD>   We'll find out for sure when the new SoundScan figures are
released on Wednesday just how effectively Keith's lemons-to-lemonade
approach is working, but "Unleashed," released Tuesday, appears
certain to debut atop the country album chart, as well as high on the
pop tally. Some optimistic executives at his label, DreamWorks
Records, suggest that he even has a shot at coming in at No. 1 on the
latter.</LD>
<TE>   ABC officials have said that Keith was left off the network's
Peter Jennings-hosted July 4 show because they could not accommodate
Keith's request to appear early in the program. But Keith maintains
he was dropped because Jennings disapproved of the slant of "Red,
White and Blue," which celebrates the bombing of the Taliban and
includes such lines as "You'll be sorry that you messed with/The U.S.
of A./ 'Cause we'll put a boot in your ass/It's the American way."</TE>
<TE>   Fans have been mailing boots to ABC offices in a campaign that's
generated more attention for Keith, and since "Unleashed" was
released, the singer has been making nonstop promotional appearances
around the country, with one set for 7 p.m. today at a Wherehouse
store in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Based on sales in the first few days, Wherehouse buyers are
projecting that the album will debut around No. 5.</TE>
<TE>   "It's neck-and-neck with Lil' Wayne, but it's going to depend on
how well it does with the mass merchandisers," such as Best Buy,
Wal-Mart and Kmart stores, says Wherehouse Entertainment senior pop
music buyer Bob Bell. "It's definitely going to do very well for us.
But the wild card is how well it's going to do with those accounts
that traditionally do very well with country music."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Handleman Co., which supplies records to many
of those mass merchants, says "Unleashed" is doing so well for its
outlets that, "if I were a betting man, I'd bet Toby Keith will be
No. 1 nationally."</TE>
<TE>   Keith's previous album, "Pull My Chain," entered the pop album
chart at No. 9 in September with first-week sales of 120,000. Among
the competition for "Unleashed" is the Dave Matthews Band's "Busted
Stuff," which sold 622,000 to enter the pop chart at No. 1 last week,
and Nelly's "Nellyville" and Eminem's "The Eminem Show," which have
sold more than 200,000 copies a week each since they were released.</TE>

<HD>Arts Feminism, Thy Newest Name Is Ladyfest</HD>
<DH>Culture* Loosely organized summer festivals meant as a
haven for female artists pop up in cities worldwide.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANGELA WATERCUTTER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>More grass-roots than Lollapalooza, more political than Lilith Fair,
Ladyfest is a summer festival produced entirely by people proud that
their styles of feminism, art and music cannot be easily
categorized--or commercialized.</LD>
<LD>   Appearing in more than a half-dozen cities around the world this
year despite no major corporate sponsorship, Ladyfests have created
havens for female artists and organizers who feel excluded from
male-dominated pop culture.</LD>
<LD>   "For a lot of us in the punk-rock scene, we get harassed at the
door and in the clubs, then you see some stupid boy band on the
stage," said Allison Wolfe, whose band Bratmobile played Ladyfest Bay
Area. "This space felt much more shared."</LD>
<TE>   Some call Ladyfest "an anti-Lilith Fair." But Wolfe, who was
instrumental in starting the first festival two years ago in Olympia,
Wash., rejects the comparison.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to have Ladyfest pitted against Lilith Fair," she
said. "I really do appreciate the space that it created."</TE>
<TE>   Ladyfest organizers have invited "pro-woman people" of all
genders, ages, shapes and sizes--but the event also has drawn some
backlash.</TE>
<TE>   "We talked to a couple of filmmakers who didn't want to be
premiered at Ladyfest because they didn't want to be pigeonholed,"
said Lara Warren, organizer of the Los Angeles Ladyfest set for
November, which will feature a West Coast film premiere.</TE>
<TE>   The planning for San Francisco's five-day festival, which ran
through Sunday, began in October, mostly in people's living rooms.
There were 40 volunteers on 10 committees and no hierarchies.</TE>
<TE>   They pulled together more than 30 bands, 12 film screenings,
visual arts galleries, spoken-word performances, and 50 workshops
with topics ranging from transgender issues and knitting to "How to
Be an Ethical Slut."</TE>
<TE>   "I think it speaks to the power of feminist culture at this
moment. We have the energy to produce the world we want for
ourselves," said Kyla Schuller, one of the organizers. "It's filling
a really crucial gap of noncommercial entertainment and politics."</TE>
<TE>   The first Ladyfest came out of a reunion of people from the 1990s
Riot Grrrl movement of punk-rock feminists. There hasn't been another
event in Olympia since, but that was the point--organizers hoped
others would take the idea and run with it.</TE>
<TE>   They got their wish.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, events emerged in Chicago, New York, Bloomington, Ind.,
and Glasgow, Scotland. This year has seen festivals in Lansing,
Mich., and Ontario, Canada, with more events scheduled for Atlanta,
Washington D.C., Amsterdam and London, among other cities.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the idea that women can take this idea back to their own
communities and it can reflect what's going on in their own cities or
towns," Wolfe said.</TE>

<HD>When Appearing on Your Old Network Is the Best Revenge</HD>
<DH>Television * Democracy rules at PBS, so a fired Louis
Rukeyser's new financial show airs on many public-TV stations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID BAUDER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The aftermath of last spring's feud between Louis Rukeyser and
Maryland Public Television recalls the famous Cold War acronym
MAD--mutually assured destruction.</LD>
<LD>   It couldn't have happened anywhere but the Public Broadcasting
Service, stung in this case by its unique decentralized structure.</LD>
<LD>   Fans of the veteran financial journalist know the basics. Ruk-
eyser's Maryland producers wanted to de-emphasize his role on the
Friday night Wall Street wrap-up he started 32 years ago. Rukeyser
cried foul, was fired, then moved to CNBC.</LD>
<TE>   Rukeyser then took advantage of the way PBS works to come up with
an ingenious way to torture his old employers. He arranged to make
the CNBC show available on weekends to any PBS station that wanted
it. Currently, 158 of the nation's 349 PBS stations carry "Louis
Rukeyser's Wall Street."</TE>
<TE>   There's nothing PBS' management can do about it. The system is set
up to give individual stations the power to decide what to put on
their air, rendering public broadcasting's central authorities far
less powerful than their commercial counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine, for a minute, CBS firing Dan Rather and the anchor still
showing up to deliver the news on about half of the CBS stations.
Wouldn't happen.</TE>
<TE>   Long Island's WLIW-TV, which distributes Rukeyser's show to other
PBS stations, said it was done to offer a choice. Many stations also
wanted to appease corporate contributors who were angry with how the
journalist had been treated.</TE>
<TE>   "We certainly didn't do it to aggravate PBS," said Terrell Cass,
president of WLIW-TV. "I don't see it as any threat, particularly now
that there is so much water under the bridge. I was at the PBS
meeting last month and it wasn't even mentioned by anybody."</TE>
<TE>   There are plenty of financial journalism shows on the air, Cass
said. Besides, PBS stations are forbidden by CNBC from airing
Rukeyser's new show on the same night as PBS' revamped "Wall Street
Week With Fortune."</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Hankin, a spokesman for Maryland Public Television, also said
he doesn't believe that the distribution of Rukeyser's CNBC show
undermines his old one. "Wall Street Week With Fortune" is being
carried on 315 of the 349 stations, with no attrition from the
Rukeyser days.</TE>
<TE>   "We're choosing here not to carry rerun cable material, but some
others may," Hankin said. "That's their choice, and it's important
that they make that choice. The question is going to be where people
are finding the information they want a year from now. It's a
decision that's not going to be made by programmers. It's going to be
made by viewers."</TE>
<TE>   Who's winning so far? No one.</TE>
<TE>   Since its CNBC debut on April 19, "Louis Rukeyser's Wall Street"
is seen by an average of 410,000 viewers on Friday nights. CNBC is
thrilled; that's 2 1/2 times more people than were watching the cable
channel at that hour.</TE>
<TE>   Yet it's less than a quarter of the 1.7 million viewers that
Rukeyser averaged in his PBS time slot before his ouster.</TE>
<TE>   In the four weeks it has been on the air since the make-over,
"Wall Street Week With Fortune" has drawn barely a million viewers.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, the audience for the two shows together is less
than it was when Rukeyser was undisturbed.</TE>
<TE>   Hankin pointed out that the lower the stock market goes, the fewer
people want to watch financial shows, and new programs need time to
find their footing.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the numbers are ominous. More disturbing for "Wall Street
Week With Fortune" is the defection of three of its four largest
underwriters after Rukeyser left. Hankin said Maryland Public
Television is confident the missing underwriters will be replaced by
this fall, something that's crucial to its survival.</TE>
<TE>   PBS President Pat Mitchell publicly supported Maryland this
spring. She couldn't say much else. Even if she wished the flap had
never taken place, PBS management is loath to second-guess local
station managers, and Mitchell has frequently encouraged producers to
freshen its long-running shows.</TE>
<TE>   PBS also won't criticize WLIW-TV for helping to distribute
Rukeyser's new show.</TE>
<TE>   "I suppose in a perfect world--I won't lie to you--it wouldn't
have happened," said Jacoba Atlas, PBS senior vice president for
programming. "But our stations are autonomous and they feel they are
serving their audience. It would be more disturbing if they were not
taking 'Wall Street Week' at all."</TE>
<TE>   That's the curse of PBS' decentralized system. In theory, the idea
is to make PBS stations more responsive to the local community than
commercial broadcast affiliates.</TE>
<TE>   In practice, it makes Mitchell's job one of the hardest in
television. She'd like PBS stations to speak with one voice as much
as possible, but 349 other managers can easily overrule her.</TE>
<TE>   When Mitchell bought filmmaker R.J. Cutler's "American High"
documentary series last year in an effort to find some younger
viewers for PBS, several stations refused to air it for fear it would
alienate older people.</TE>
<TE>   Still, most PBS stations are sticking with PBS' "American Family"
series about a Latino family, even though it hasn't done well in
cities with a small Latino population, Atlas said.</TE>
<TE>   "It can sometimes seem like we're being pulled in many different
directions," she said. "Our challenge is to see that as something
that can be harnessed for the good. It makes it harder, there's no
question. I think most television is done by dictatorship. This is a
democracy."</TE>

<HD>Soloists Lift Gershwin Program at the Bowl</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL CARIAGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One small claim to newness in the form of a song said to have been
discovered recently in an old trunk turned out to be the only novelty
in an otherwise familiar Gershwin program played by the Los Angeles
Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl twice over the weekend.</LD>
<LD>   But there was nothing hackneyed in the Friday performances of the
two guest soloists, singer Audra McDonald and pianist Kevin Cole.
They brought high energy, abundant skills and considerable musical
brightness to this agenda, 65 summers since composer George
Gershwin's early death in this very city.</LD>
<LD>   American conductor David Alan Miller presided over the proceedings
stylishly, despite the orchestra's often raucous, sometimes
unbalanced sound-profile and evident short rehearsal time.</LD>
<TE>   Still, he supported his expert soloists solidly through their time
in the spotlight. And, at the end, he led a very handsomely played,
clearly properly prepared "An American in Paris."</TE>
<TE>   McDonald, looking elegant in a two-toned shimmery gown, sang seven
songs, including the unfamiliar "Ask Me Again," with a disarming
directness and no pretensions. She delivers and colors the words but
respects the musical line. In two "Porgy and Bess" excerpts,
"Summertime" and "My Man's Gone Now," she achieved emotional purity
without added fillips or jazzed-up embellishments.</TE>
<TE>   The virtuosic Cole, a pianist unfamiliar to my experience, made
his Hollywood Bowl debut in an audacious, ear-opening performance of
"Rhapsody in Blue." Assisted enthusiastically by Miller and the
orchestra, Cole reinstated Gershwin's bracing tempos--documented in
the composer's own recordings--and driving exuberance through the
work, delivering all its facets, but relentlessly. And he did so with
a perfect technical apparatus and utter clarity.</TE>
<TE>   At the end, a bowlful of Gershwin lovers hollered with approval.
Cole responded with an encore, a showy and touching medley of
Gershwin songs that reiterated his felicitous digitality. Again, he
flew over the keyboard, hitting every note squarely on the head.
Exhilarating.</TE>
<TE>   The program also included the "Cuban Overture" and the overture to
"Oh, Kay!" Among the featured Philharmonic players were associate
concertmaster Bing Wang and clarinetist Lorin Levee, who excelled not
only on "Rhapsody in Blue," but throughout the evening.</TE>

<DH>In concert, Sheryl Crow plays up the party-girl theme, a
persona that proves wearing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD CROMELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sheryl Crow is a singer-songwriter of no great depth or originality,
but her catchy craft, a gift for mainstreaming a boho sensibility and
her knack for recasting Tom Petty, the Stones, Bob Dylan and
Fleetwood Mac made her a post-classic-rock princess when she arrived
a decade ago.</LD>
<LD>   She also enjoyed the patronage of in-crowd musicians and stars
such as Don Henley, and as recently as three years ago the Los
Angeles-based artist showed a willingness to stretch, expanding her
range with alt-country and experimental elements on the moody,
sometimes difficult "Globe Sessions" album.</LD>
<LD>   But somewhere along the line she's apparently decided she's a
good-time, hard-rock chick. Maybe it's fallout from collaborating
with the likes of Eric Clapton, Keith Richards and Lenny Kravitz, but
it's a miscalculation currently compounded by her new album, "C'mon
C'mon," which sounds like a simplified, synthetic attempt to regain
commercial footing by tapping her inner Britney.</LD>
<TE>   If you think that record is dumbed-down, what would you make of
her concert on Saturday at Verizon Wireless Amphitheater?</TE>
<TE>   Actually, some of the new songs, notably the Top 20 hit "Soak Up
the Sun" and "You're an Original" (with guitarist Doyle Bramhall II
joining in), benefited by being liberated from the album's
overproduction, gaining a raw, exuberant kick.</TE>
<TE>   But like an insecure party host who keeps breaking the mood and
interrupting good conversations to get everyone playing a game, Crow
seemed to have no confidence in the ability of her material to hold
the audience. If she didn't keep the crowd artificially pumped up,
she'd lose them. So there was lots of prancing and posing and stock
exhortations.</TE>
<TE>   Even when she broke the string of rock songs with her first hit,
"Leaving Las Vegas," she couldn't let the lyric's personal,
character-driven narrative carry the selection. Instead, she used the
selection as a platform for an audience-participation turn.</TE>
<TE>   There's a long list of quality singer-songwriters who know how to
showcase their strengths in concert and still create a celebratory
mood, but Crow lacks the instincts and energy to carry off this party
persona. Five minutes of Gwen Stefani generates more wattage than
Crow mustered in 90 Saturday, and her dance steps and gestures were
rote and half-hearted.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the sound was stuck at the threshold of shrill all
evening, eliminating any drama by reducing everything to the same
tone, even the occasional ballad. Talk about fear of intimacy.</TE>
<TE>   Crow's performance was the closing set of the Irvine stop of Jeep
World Outside Festival, a 23-city tour that featured jam-band O.A.R.,
reggae scion Ziggy Marley and middle-of-the-road nice guys Train on
the main stage.</TE>
<TE>   In the amphitheater concourse, several bands played on a second
stage, adjacent to demonstrations of rock climbing, kayaking, scuba
diving and other adventure sports. Maybe exhaustion accounted in part
for the steady stream of departures during the second half of Crow's
set, but the sense that the show wasn't going anywhere might have had
something to do with it.</TE>

<HD>That's One Groovy Debut</HD>
<DH>Box Office* 'Powers' overcomes mixed, negative reviews to
become the highest-grossing film to open in July. 'Perdition' is in
the No. 2 spot.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite mixed-to-negative reviews that urged moviegoers to brace
themselves for audaciously scatological humor, "Austin Powers in
Goldmember" demonstrated sexy-beast appeal this weekend to emerge as
the highest-grossing film to open in the month of July.</LD>
<LD>   According to preliminary data released by box-office tracking firm
Nielsen EDI, the third installment in the spy parody series from New
Line Cinema collected an estimated $71.45 million its first weekend
run, beating former July champ "Planet of the Apes," which took in
$68.53 million when it opened exactly one year ago.</LD>
<LD>   "Goldmember" also shattered the record for the biggest comedy
opening, bumping from the top spot last year's "Rush Hour 2," another
sequel distributed by New Line.</LD>
<TE>   The commercial performance is consistent with the upward-sloping
evolution of the tongue-in-cheek franchise. In 1997, the original
Austin Powers made $53.9 million during its entire theatrical run,
while the 1999 follow-up, "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,"
raked in $54.9 million in just its opening weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Combined with the almost $3.6 million the film grossed in previews
Thursday, the current windfall confirms that the public's appetite
for groovy adventures from the mock-James Bond spy has not waned,
said Dan Marks, an executive with Nielsen EDI. "The critics are not
gonna hurt a picture like this."</TE>
<TE>   Exit polls conducted by the film's distributor revealed that the
broad comedy featured in the movie went across best with audience
members under 25. Among the teenage set, some have caught the film
more than once over the weekend, says "Goldmember" producer John
Lyons. "It's a dream come true to get repeat business from teens."</TE>
<TE>   "Goldmember" cost $80 million to produce, Lyons says, and
generated an average of $19,776 in box-office returns per screen this
weekend when it was shown on 5,812 screens in 3,613 theaters across
the country.</TE>
<TE>   Returnees rounded out the top five films the weekend. The gangster
drama "Road to Perdition," starring Tom Hanks, continued to perform
well in its third weekend in release, placing second and grabbing an
additional $11 million to increase its revenues to date to $65.6
million.</TE>
<TE>   "Stuart Little 2," a family-friendly picture starring a digitally
animated mouse, came in third, scoring an extra $10.7 million in its
second week of release to bring its total to $34.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   "Men in Black II," taking in $8.8 million, and "K-19: The
Widowmaker," with $7.3 million, occupied, respectively, the fourth
and fifth slots, both taking sharp drops from the previous week.</TE>
<TE>   Making an OK debut in 2,553 theaters was "Country Bears," Disney's
attempt to adapt a theme park ride for the big screen. The film's
kiddie appeal ensured $5.2-million returns in the first three days of
its run, with a per-theater average of $2,042. Studio sources
estimated Sunday that the modest picture, which was made for roughly
$20 million, would recoup expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Following the "Bears," respectively, were "Mr. Deeds" with $ 4.2
million and "Reign of Fire" with $3.3 million. "Minority Report"
returned to the top 10 at No. 9 with $3.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Rising to the No. 10 slot was the sleeper hit "My Big Fat Greek
Wedding," which has proved surprisingly durable during a 15-week
theatrical run. The film took in an impressive $3 million although it
played only in 569 theaters across the country, bringing its
cumulative box-office returns to $35.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   Among specialized movies that opened Friday, "The Kid Stays in the
Picture," the documentary about veteran producer Robert Evans,
debuted in New York and Los Angeles in four locations with an
estimated $88,799 for an impressive per-theater average of $22,000.</TE>
<TE>   Less auspiciously, the Tim Allen-Christian Slater comedy "Who Is
Cletis Tout?" opened with $67,000 in 18 theaters in four major
markets for an unexceptional $3,722 per-screen average.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, according to Nielsen EDI, moviegoers plunked down an
estimated $154 million for tickets, up from last weekend's lackluster
$119.8 million and virtually the same figure as the comparable
weekend last year.</TE>

<HD>Henry Mancini Institute Pays Tribute to Founder Jack
Elliott</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The sixth season of the Henry Mancini Institute summer concert
programs opened Friday night with a tribute to the organization's
founder, Jack Elliott. It was an appropriate way to kick off a
monthlong sequence of seminars, master classes, private study and
free concerts for the program's 84 scholarship musicians from 62 U.S.
cities and 15 countries.</LD>
<LD>   Elliott, who died last year, established the organization in an
effort to answer the primary question of what it takes to make a
living as a professional musician in today's complex world. And his
belief that the answer lies in providing young professionals with the
tools to gain access to the multitude of contemporary musical genres
was the underlying principle driving the successful achievements of
HMI under his musical direction.</LD>
<LD>   Saturday's program, in addition to showcasing some of Elliott's
own music (something he never did for himself during his leadership
tenure), made a mild effort to follow the same path. Works by Claus
Ogerman, Dave Grusin and Patrick Williams (the institute's new music
director) combined with the premiere of a composition by HMI
participating composer Kyle Newmaster, an arrangement of Django
Reinhardt's "Nuages" by pianist Roger Kellaway and Elliott's setting
of some works by Louis Moreau Gottschalk to embrace elements of jazz,
film and pop with a slight seasoning of classical music.</LD>
<TE>   Virtually everything was performed with stylish enthusiasm by the
youthful HMI Orchestra, which may be the finest ensemble in the
institute's history.</TE>
<TE>   With barely a week of rehearsing under their belts, they moved
through the varied program with barely a misstep, capturing the dark,
layered string textures of the second movement from Ogerman's "Lyric
Suite" (which featured the fine flute work of Hubert Laws), jauntily
romping thought the Gottschalk piece, and closing with a rousing,
enthusiastic rendering of Mancini's theme from "Peter Gunn."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Laws and Kellaway, other headliners included
pianist Grusin, guitarist Lee Ritenour and drummer Vinnie Colaiuta in
a warm performance of Grusin's "Three Cowboy Songs," and the superb
young violinist Yue Deng's interpretation of "Nuages."</TE>
<TE>   The real stars of the concert, however, were the HMI Orchestra
members. Were Elliott still alive, he undoubtedly would have sensed
the high skill levels of this year's players, and raised the bar of
his programming accordingly</TE>

<HD>A Stripped-Down Set for 'Full Frontal'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Compiled byTimes staff writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Oscar-winning director Steven Soderbergh set out to make his
contemporary comedy, "Full Frontal," he laid down some unusual
guidelines for his ensemble of stars, including Oscar-winner Julia
Roberts, who normally earns $20 million a picture and is accorded all
the perks of a megastar.</LD>
<LD>   Soderbergh, using digital equipment and shooting on a schedule
measured in days rather than weeks, insisted that the stars drive
themselves to the set--no disembarking from limousines, thank you--or
they could face ridicule and ribbing from the rest of the cast and
crew. There would be no company-provided trailers, and he advised
them to eat before arriving on the set, because there would be no
caterer. They were also to provide their own wardrobe, hair care and
makeup.</LD>
<LD>   In short, it was not unlike the way Soderbergh made films years
ago, before all the fame and fortune, when he was still a struggling
director working in the hardscrabble world of independent film.</LD>
<TE>   Soderbergh, who edited the movie using Apple Computer's Final Cut
Pro software, has since made critically acclaimed studio hits such as
"Erin Brockovich," "Traffic" and "Ocean's 11." But he yearned to get
back to the roots that first brought him notice with small films such
as "sex, lies and videotape," which earned him the Cannes Film
Festival's Palme d'Or, an Independent Spirit Award for best director
and an Oscar nomination for best director.</TE>
<TE>   Because of his record of accomplishment, stars jumped at the
chance to work with him. In addition to Roberts, whom Soderbergh
guided to a best actress Oscar in "Erin Brockovich," "Full Frontal"
features Brad Pitt, David Duchovny, Nicky Katt, Catherine Keener,
Mary McCormack, David Hyde Pierce and Blair Underwood.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the movie's experimental approach, Miramax is opening
"Full Frontal" on only 200 screens on Friday. Written by Coleman
Hough, it traces the complicated and sometimes fragile relationships
among seven friends, some of whom drift in and out of a movie within
the movie.</TE>

<HD>Vereen Revisits Broadway a Wiser but Joyful Man</HD>
<DH>Theater* Ten years after a life-altering auto accident, the
actor is reprising his role in "I'm Not Rappaport."</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK KENNEDY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>On one side stands the mighty Brooklyn Bridge. On the other, the
Manhattan Bridge. In between stands Ben Vereen, looking every bit as
vital as the mammoth girders that loom above him.</LD>
<LD>   It is morning in Brooklyn, and Vereen can't wait to follow one of
these two hulking spans into Manhattan and then Broadway, where the
Tony-winning song-and-dance man has always gravitated like a moth to
light.</LD>
<LD>   "I have a rehearsal today," he says. "You know what's a good
feeling? When you wake up in the morning and you go, 'I have a place
to go! It's called a theater and I have a job!' "</LD>
<TE>   There is a good reason for such glee: Vereen just marked the 10th
anniversary of an auto accident that left him with serious head and
internal injuries that required four hours of surgery. Few expected
him to walk again, much less perform.</TE>
<TE>   "I have problems," he says. "I have taxes and bills and things
with relationships that I have to go through. But thank God that I'm
waking up today to deal with it."</TE>
<TE>   This month, Vereen reprises the role of retired boxer Midge Carter
in a revival of "I'm Not Rappaport," the drama of two older men
coming to grips with their lives and infirmities.</TE>
<TE>   Much has changed for Vereen since he first tackled the role in the
late 1980s. This time, he has infused the past with what he learned
from his own agonizing years of rehabilitation.</TE>
<TE>   "I draw on the frailty and the aging process," says Vereen, 55,
who is paired with Judd Hirsch. "Midge has got his angst. He's weaker
than he was in his prime. I know about that stuff. That applies to
me."</TE>
<TE>   Vereen in real life betrays little of such angst and ill health.
Though his beard is flecked with gray, he laughs heartily and moves
as gracefully as he did in such musicals as "Hair," "Jesus Christ
Superstar" and "Pippin."</TE>
<TE>   Vereen's new home is in one of the hottest areas of Brooklyn, the
borough where he was raised. It's a neighborhood of former factories
and warehouses that is affectionately known as DUMBO--Down Under the
Manhattan Bridge Overpass.</TE>
<TE>   Ten years ago, nobody came to these rough streets. Now Civil
War-era buildings are slated to become malls or are being converted
into lofts. Vereen lives in a former paper factory that is dotted
with chic apartments. "If the element of good comes, the element of
bad has to leave," he says.</TE>
<TE>   That might as well be Vereen's motto. Despite heartache in his
life that includes the loss of a daughter, his faith remains intact.</TE>
<TE>   "I do believe in prayer. I do believe in a higher power. And I do
believe in God, Allah, Buddha, Jesus, whomever you decide to call the
divinity. The power of that is within us all and if we allow it, it
can restore us."</TE>
<TE>   That faith also has propelled Vereen to donate his time to
everything from helping drug addicts to stopping sudden infant death
syndrome to fighting heart disease to boosting inner-city arts.</TE>
<TE>   Vereen's 30-year-old daughter, Malaika, says she has seen her dad
bounce back from turbulent times while retaining his desire to help
others. "My father has so much strength and love in him and that's
really the hardest part: He really feels for people and it's in his
soul," she says. Then she adds with a note of anxiety, "It concerns
me that it's in his soul."</TE>
<TE>   Vereen left Brooklyn for the first time when he attended the High
School for the Performing Arts in Manhattan in the early 1960s.
Enough people saw talent in the cocky gang member to push him over
the bridge.</TE>
<TE>   Later, during an audition for the musical "Sweet Charity," Vereen
caught the attention of legendary choreographer Bob Fosse, who would
play an important part in the young dancer's life.</TE>
<TE>   Vereen won roles in "Pippin," "Hair," "Jesus Christ Superstar"
and, later, "Grind" and appeared in such movies as "All That Jazz."
On television, he co-starred in TV's landmark series "Roots" and had
a recurring role in the 1990s police show "Silk Stalkings." His 1978
network special, "Ben Vereen: His Roots," won six Emmys.</TE>
<TE>   However, a cocaine addiction kicked in as his fortunes rose. In
1987, tragedy struck as his 16-year-old daughter, Naja, was killed
when the family van was crushed by a tractor-trailer.</TE>
<TE>   "I lost a lot of things in those days during the drug period, a
lot of personal things. The most important thing was time--time I
could have spent with my children," he says. "I could have spent more
valuable time with her."</TE>
<TE>   Five years later, in June 1992, Vereen's life was threatened when
he crashed his Corvette into a tree near his home in Malibu. Later
that day, he was struck by an SUV and thrown 130 feet while walking
along Pacific Coast Highway.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was laying there in bed, the doctor said I'd never walk,
I'd never dance again, I'd never sing again," he recalls. "Every
night when I couldn't sleep, I'd sit there in prayer. I'd sit there
and meditate on my body."</TE>
<TE>   By sheer force of will, he healed. Only 10 months later, Vereen
made a triumphant return to Broadway in "Jelly's Last Jam," opposite
Gregory Hines. Then he did the demanding "Fosse."</TE>
<TE>   Vereen has become fast friends with the man who hit him,
Grammy-winning music producer David Foster.</TE>
<TE>   "I had met him three years before and I had said, 'We should get
together,' " Vereen says with a sly smile. "A phone call would have
been nice."</TE>
<TE>   Says Malaika about the crash, "He looks at it truly as a blessing.
He had had a stroke earlier that evening and he thinks that was an
intervention to save his life. A lot of people wouldn't see it that
way."</TE>
<TE>   Her father soon became sober--and spoke up about his experience,
founding Celebrities for a Drug-Free America, a nonprofit group
dedicated to educating youngsters about the dangers of drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a lot of problems after that. The industry said, 'We can't
associate with someone like this.' But I had to tell my story and
take whatever the consequences were. I'm not using today and that's
the important thing. I'm not that dark creature I was before."</TE>
<TE>   With that, Vereen rises to prepare for his trip across the bridge
and into Manhattan. His outlook could be summed up by the concluding
words in his biography for the "I'm Not Rappaport" Playbill.</TE>
<TE>   "As always, this performance is dedicated to my daughter Naja,"
Vereen writes. "Life is good."</TE>

<HD>Work That Seems to Hold That Thought</HD>
<DH>Thinking process appears to unfold in William Kentridge's
animated films from charcoal drawings, on view at LACMA.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The turbulent, strangely affecting animated films made by South
African artist William Kentridge are driven by special effects. By
that, I don't mean 3-D worlds conjured from the digital ether of
computer pixels. In fact I mean just the opposite.</LD>
<LD>   Today, what goes by the name "special effects" in movies is
anything but special. High-tech razzle-dazzle is instead routine, a
conventional process of filmmaking fully anticipated by the audience.
Occasionally it's effective; mostly it's inert. Either way, the
ubiquity of machine-made special effects in corporate cinema is a
backdrop against which Kentridge's short, cottage-industry films
stand out.</LD>
<LD>   Using black charcoal and white paper almost exclusively,
Kentridge, 47, creates animation that seems to have the evanescent
power of unfolding human thought. At the Los Angeles County Museum of
Art, a survey of 11 films made between 1989 and 1999 is accompanied
by some 50 examples of those drawings, as well as two dozen etchings
and screen-prints, rear-screen projections and a video that shows
excerpts of his work as a theatrical stage designer.</LD>
<TE>   This is Kentridge's second solo show in a Southern California
museum. (At the San Diego Museum of Contemporary Art in 1998,
"WEIGHING ... and WANTING" focused on the animated film of that
name.) It was organized jointly by Chicago's Museum of Contemporary
Art and New York's New Museum.</TE>
<TE>   Kentridge's films are short--one is just over three minutes long,
none is more than nine minutes--as one might expect of a studio
artist who makes every frame by hand. At LACMA they're shown
continuously in five black-box screening rooms built inside the
gallery. The films do not convey linear narratives. Episodic and
anarchic, they're more Dada than descriptive. Alfred Jarry's classic
"King Ubu" (1896), a grotesque parody of Shakespeare's "Macbeth," is
among Kentridge's sources. (Like Jarry, Kentridge has employed
puppets in theatrical productions.) So is William Hogarth, whose 18th
century lampoons of British corruption find a kind of colonial
counterpart here.</TE>
<TE>   Several films focus on Soho Eckstein, a voracious businessman in a
pinstripe suit, who is contrasted with the character of Felix
Teitelbaum. A pudgy nude, Felix is a dreamy figure whose eccentricity
casts him as an artist or social outsider. The brutality of South
African apartheid and other political situations create an
inescapable context for their escapades, but the shifting tide of the
human psyche in a world of social inequity and strife is Kentridge's
recurrent focus.</TE>
<TE>   Kentridge evokes this psychic turmoil through an often powerful
technique of graphic animation. The soft, black marks of charcoal on
paper, rubbed in to make shades of gray and rubbed out to create
erasures, establish a constantly shifting atmosphere of fluid
movement. As Eckstein listens through a paper cup to hear the inner
whispers of a stone, or bodies evaporate into the earth, nothing is
stable in these dark, visually intense worlds. "All that is solid
melts into air," to borrow an eloquent phrase from Karl Marx--and as
it does the disorder lurking just beneath the quivering surface of
modern life rushes to the fore.</TE>
<TE>   In the exhibition, samples of Kentridge's drawings accompany the
films in which they appear. (A few of the drawings are independent of
the films.) Of all artistic mediums, drawing is the one that is most
directly connected to the elaboration of artistic thought. It's the
place where nascent ideas take material form, with the hand as
intermediary between mind and object. Kentridge's expressive handling
of charcoal emphasizes the procedure.</TE>
<TE>   When the process embodied in his drawing technique is recorded as
film, the result is startling. It's almost as if a
stream-of-consciousness is being projected on the wall. The effect is
magical and mesmerizing. The relative brevity of the films also
allows for repeat viewing that further enhances the satisfaction, as
qualities of obsessive repetition enter the picture.</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly, the drawings assembled for the exhibition as
representative examples are not, on their own, unusually compelling.
They're useful for getting a handle on the visual sources that
Kentridge uses to such powerful effect in his films, ranging from
Hogarth and Goya to such modern German Expressionists as Otto Dix,
George Grosz and Max Beckmann.</TE>
<TE>   In isolation, however, his drawings can seem like competent
illustration, as in one that shows Eckstein standing alone before a
curved horizon and beneath the legend, "Her absence filled the
world." Undistinguished on its own, it's a bit like a souvenir of the
1991 film for which it was made, "Sobriety, Obesity and Growing Old."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Kentridge is at the leading edge of a growing wave of
artists who appear to be reacting against the numbing acreage of
lifeless video projection and sleek, large-scale photography. Defined
more than anything by deadened, gee-whiz technology, such work was
once useful in creating a pose of ironic detachment. But that's about
the last thing we need in art right now.</TE>
<TE>   The objects in Paul Sietsema's modest 1998 film, "Untitled (A
Beautiful Place)," for example, are as clearly handmade as the home
movie itself. A recent gallery show by Jennifer Bornstein featured
short film clips of obviously phony special effects--a meteor shower,
a polar sunset--whose charm was nonetheless palpable.</TE>
<TE>   And spring's Whitney Biennial provided a telling if peculiar
sight: The galleries were larded with vacuous digital trivia while
the concurrent film and video program emphasized visceral work. (See
for yourself in September, when the program travels to the Santa
Monica Museum of Art.)</TE>
<TE>   Even transferred to DVD, as Kentridge's is for exhibition, 16-mm
film retains its visceral look. That bodily attribute is further
emphasized by mark-making and erasure executed in a continuous flow.
By themselves, Kentridge's drawings might not be anything special. As
animation they bristle as thought incarnate.</TE>

<HD>In Today's Spy Games, Worldliness Is Not Enough</HD>
<DH>Movies* Their parents may go for a secret agent in a tux,
but teenage moviegoers want one with 'tude. So say the makers of
'XXX.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LORENZA MUNOZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whether he was played by Sean Connery, Roger Moore or Pierce Brosnan,
James Bond epitomized the upper-class spy: a suave sophisticate, most
comfortable in a tuxedo and high-priced sports car. Xander Cage, the
spy played by Vin Diesel in the upcoming action thriller "XXX," is
something else again: rough, unpolished and crass--and proud of it.
As Cage likes to say, he wants his drink "shaken and stirred."</LD>
<LD>   "He is not interested in the Kennedy-era idea of
sophistication--like what kind of cigars you smoke, brandy you drink,
martinis you sip," said the film's director, Rob Cohen. "He is from
the guts of the American culture."</LD>
<LD>   "XXX," which opens Aug. 9, updates the spy-movie genre by tapping
into the rougher and cruder sensibilities of the hip-hop crowd. While
their parents were weaned on Bond, younger audiences have shown an
interest in heroes drawn from society's underbelly. The idea,
according to screenwriter Rich Wilkes and Cohen, was to create a sort
of punk James Bond--an Everyman anti-hero.</LD>
<TE>   Revolution Studios, which produced the picture, and Sony, which is
distributing, are betting that this spy movie with an attitude will
attract Generation X and younger audiences--a demographic that James
Bond has failed to capture. It is an audience Cohen and Diesel rode
all the way to a box-office bonanza in last year's surprise hit "The
Fast and the Furious." With his dark, multiethnic look and streetwise
air, Diesel is a glamorized reflection of today's moviegoers. If all
goes well at the box office for "XXX," Cohen and Diesel will re-team
for the sequel, which Cohen says will be set in Southeast Asia.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the 20th Bond installment, "Die Another Day," will be
released in November. MGM executives know that Bond is perceived as
being too stiff, too WASPy and too buttoned-up among many youth. In
marketing meetings, they have been brainstorming ideas to make him
hipper, younger and more identifiable to younger audiences, while at
the same time not driving away the older, loyal Bond followers.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Revolution executives were contemplating marketing
"XXX" with the tagline: "Not Your Daddy's Spy Movie." But Cohen, who
did not want to alienate all the daddies and potential moviegoers,
talked them out of it.</TE>
<TE>   Still, where James Bond skis, Xander Cage is an extreme
snowboarder. While Bond wears a tuxedo, Cage wears a hairy, dirty,
shaggy coat. Where Bond is loyal to Her Majesty's Secret Service,
Cage is out for himself. Where Bond lives it up at the Ritz-Carlton,
Cage sleeps in a cold hole-in-the-wall filled with rats. The only
trait they share in common is that women find both irresistible.</TE>
<TE>   Wilkes said that "XXX" represents his contemporary twist on a
genre perfected by Bond.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't even begin to touch [Bond creator] Ian Fleming," said
the 35-year-old screenwriter. "All I was trying to do was make a
character that filled the little niche of pop culture that I was
interested in."</TE>
<TE>   But Cohen wanted to ruffle Bond's perfect feathers--no disrespect
intended.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up on Bond ... watching 'Dr. No' when Ursula Andress came
out of that water," said Cohen, referring to the 1962 classic. "
'XXX' is going to take those expectations and, without putting down
this great tradition, do back-flips off those conventions into a new
realm."</TE>
<TE>   Wilkes originally thought of "XXX" as an Internet cartoon. But
then he pitched the idea to Revolution Studios executive Todd Garner,
who jumped on it for a feature film. Wilkes, a punk-rock follower
since the early 1980s, said he was inspired by the take-no-prisoners
style of the music in creating his anti-authoritarian spy.</TE>
<TE>   He wanted to create a character for the music--not the other way
around. So rap, acid metal, punk, rock (in Spanish, English, German
and Russian) play a central role in the film.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing in cinema that is parallel to what Eminem is
doing or these awesome punk bands," said Wilkes, who also wrote
"Airheads." "Everything is sanitized and clean and John Tesh-like. I
thought there has to be an antidote to the squeaky-clean heroes we've
seen of late. Not all rough-talking, foul-mouthed, bald, tattooed
guys are bad."</TE>
<TE>   Wilkes said every generation needs its own anti-hero, whether it's
Marlon Brando in "The Wild One" or Dennis Hopper in "Easy Rider."
Sometimes it's OK to alienate the older crowds, he said. And
considering that the most avid moviegoer in America is the
14-year-old boy, it is surprising more anti-establishment movies are
not made.</TE>
<TE>   "It reflects the way people are feeling. Why not turn off the
baby-boomer generation? We don't all have to love the same things."</TE>
<TE>   Rather than being recruited for his exemplary skills, Xander Cage
is brought into the world of espionage by force. He is caught
stealing a state senator's car and driving it off a bridge--all for
kicks and the promotion of his extreme Web site. To escape prison
time, he joins the CIA, recruited to infiltrate a ring of Russian
gangsters who are trafficking in nuclear secrets.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA needs him almost as much as he needs them--their
buttoned-up agents are the antithesis of cool and are routinely
getting plucked off. In the movie's opening scene, a scene Cohen
likes to call "The Tuxedo Killed Him," a techno-punk band is spewing
fire and angry lyrics in German to a crowd of multi-pierced,
leather-clad, disaffected youth. A dapper man wearing a tuxedo barges
into the concert. He might as well be wearing a bull's-eye.
Immediately, he is spotted by the Goth/punk gangsters he was hired to
kill and they gun him down--the concert revelers think it's part of
the show.</TE>
<TE>   Samuel L. Jackson, as the rigid CIA officer who recruits Cage,
describes the targets this way: "dirty, dangerous, tattooed--you
know, your kind of people."</TE>
<TE>   While Cage's attitude is a reflection of a youthful cynicism and
comtempt for authority, Cohen and Wilkes wanted to redeem him in the
end and offer a hopeful message.</TE>
<TE>   Xander Cage experiences a journey to self-discovery. He finds he
is actually a patriot. The movie, which began filming in November
after the terrorist attacks, ends on an unapologetically patriotic
note--complete with an American flag parachute that Cage uses to save
the world from nuclear destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen, who has seen his career rise and fall over many years in
Hollywood, says he always wants his teenage son to take a lesson from
his movies.</TE>
<TE>   "The moral journey of Xander Cage is what I really wanted my
15-year-old son to take away from it.... You have to become aware
that there is a big world out there and we are all interconnected,"
he said. "The Internet is not just a toy to download video games--it
is telling you that what goes on in Cairo will affect you in Lake
Tahoe. We cannot bury ourselves in this idea that this is a fun
culture and that our only obligation to our society is to make enough
money to continue our fun."</TE>
<TE>   Wilkes says everyone has the capacity to do good if given the
chance.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are a punk kid with a swastika, do you really want a
Fourth Reich or do you just want to be different?" said Wilkes. "Even
punk rockers love puppy dogs."</TE>

<HD>Jewel's New Facets Have a Familiar Ring</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NATALIE NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Folkie singer-songwriter Jewel showed Friday night at the Greek
Theatre that she's quite capable of a-changin' with the times, but
her familiar sensitivity was always part of the show.</LD>
<LD>   Wearing tight jeans and a strategically torn red T-shirt, the
28-year-old artist didn't spend much time talking to the audience.
Instead, she let her music make most of the emotional connections
during the two-hour set, even treating the near-capacity crowd to two
new songs written just days earlier. Jewel also mentioned the April
horseback-riding accident in which she broke her collarbone and a
rib, joking that she'd do some flashy dance moves instead of playing
much guitar, although she actually did play it about half the time.</LD>
<LD>   Songs from her current album, "This Way," put the best-selling
poet's agile, sweet voice and plaintive lyrics into a range of
musical settings, and her fine backing quintet deftly shifted from
the smooth, techno-like pop of the hit "Standing Still" to the
sinuous, Indian-feeling "Serve the Ego." Yet even such grittier
numbers as the blues-rocker "Everybody Needs Someone Sometime"
weren't exactly down 'n' dirty, but more boisterous expressions of
Jewel's basic message that people often quite desperately need
people.</LD>
<TE>   This emphasis on sonic diversity was reflected in the evening's
opening-act program, Soul City Cafe, which Jewel launched to help
create for other young artists the kind of grass-roots support she
initially received. Alongside singer-songwriter Scooter Scudieri and
spoken-word artist Nafeesa Monroe, the band Edify got the warmest
reception for its Pearl Jam-meets-Creed brand of melodic,
aggressively emotional tunes.</TE>
<TE>   Jewel flashed her social conscience with the new song "Jesus Loves
You," and she also delved into her catalog for such favorites as the
torchily tormented "Foolish Games" and an extended, blues-flavored
take on "Who Will Save Your Soul?"</TE>
<TE>   Her mid-set solo turn offered the lighthearted, insistently
romantic "Morning Song," but it also provided the most nakedly
emotional moment with a heartbreaking tune about a friend who died of
cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the adeptly changed-up sound, the songs had a puzzling
sameness at their core. As much as Jewel's apparent naivete seemed a
cloak of sorts in her younger days, now her austere sentimentality
feels similarly self-protective. But by shielding listeners from her
emotional center, she was only momentarily riveting rather than
completely transcendent.</TE>

<HD>A Grandfatherly Performance Undercuts 'All My Sons'</HD>
<DH>As a wartime industrialist with blood on his hands, Daniel
J. Travanti isn't up to the level of his fellow cast members in the
Arthur Miller drama.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SAN DIEGO--At the heart of "All My Sons" is one of playwright Arthur
Miller's classic self-deceiving American males: Joe Keller, owner of
a prosperous machine shop who made a bundle during World War II by
sidestepping scandal and personal responsibility.</LD>
<LD>   Keller fashions himself a realist, not like his idealistic son
Chris, or his never-made-a-buck-in-her-life wife, Kate.</LD>
<LD>   In business, he reasons, everybody cuts corners; when the big
companies do it, it's overlooked, but when the small guy does it,
he's crucified. With grit and one year of night school, he worked his
way to the top and he's proud of it.</LD>
<TE>   Self-pitying and self-congratulatory, Keller is the touchstone for
all the other characters in this journey toward tragic
self-discovery.</TE>
<TE>   Which explains why the Old Globe Theatre's production of "All My
Sons," which opened Saturday, is so disappointing.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel J. Travanti as Keller is so off the mark that a slew of
marvelous performances by other cast members--particularly Robin
Pearson Rose as Kate--are badly undercut.</TE>
<TE>   The text says Keller is 61, but Travanti, best known as Capt.
Furillo on "Hill Street Blues," insists on playing him more like 81.</TE>
<TE>   His idea of playing an old man is to affect a stuffy, nasal voice
and continually push out his upper lip with his tongue. A role that
needs a Lee J. Cobb lion-in-winter instead gets George Burns-like
shtick.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, confrontation scenes that should be taut with family
tension go slack and messy.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Keller has his physical showdown with Chris--played
with just the right tone of youthful anguish by Brian Hutchison--the
damage has been done.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, Rose's Kate is so agonized, so fervent in her
belief that her son Larry, a pilot lost during World War II, will
someday return, that her pain is palpable.</TE>
<TE>   Kate knows about her husband's role in sending defective airplane
parts to the military. The truth is unbearable, so she covers it with
a fiction about Larry's certain return.</TE>
<TE>   Caren Browning as the catty but truth-telling doctor's wife and
Deborah Annette Heinig as the next-door neighbor who settled for
second choice after her true love was drafted are excellent.</TE>

<HD>Yorke Project Carries on Lewitzky's Legacy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's never surprising to find the restless creativity and focus on
pure movement values that distinguished Bella Lewitzky's style of
modern dance reflected in choreography by her former company members.
She was a great teacher and her dancers learned their lessons well.</LD>
<LD>   At the Colburn School on Saturday, the Lewitzky legacy could be
found not only in works performed by the seven-woman Yorke Dance
Project (founded in 1997, the year the Lewitzky company disbanded),
but also in choreography created for children of the school.</LD>
<LD>   In "Ready Set Gone," Yorke Dance Project founder and former
Lewitzky dancer Yolande Yorke-Edgell devised a sunny structuralist
romp to taped music by Steve Reich.</LD>
<TE>   Three sets of women in black (two in T-shirts, two in halter tops,
two in long-sleeved pullovers) formed isolated movement cadres that
eventually, inevitably, inventively mixed and merged.</TE>
<TE>   Yorke-Edgell's "Tailored" (to taped music by Alessandro Marcello)
displayed the same interest in formal contrasts--here the playoff
between two dancers dressed as neo-Baroque cavaliers and two as
sprightly wenches.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the same dance, Kristen Wilkinson and Jennifer Flanagan
stayed in one world, Kristen Brown and Samantha Robinson in another,
separated by class and the illusion of gender differences.</TE>
<TE>   But in Diana MacNeil's "Sisters," Robinson, Wilkinson and Flanagan
belonged to the same dancing family, joining Yorke-Edgell, Yvette
Wulff and Shelby Williams in brief, deft etudes set to two Stravinsky
piano pieces.</TE>
<TE>   Joined by Shane Summers and Charlotte Dutton, guest Kay Min
attended to Stravinsky skillfully, while the dancers sustained the
fiction of making up their choreography on the spot.</TE>
<TE>   Ex-Lewitzky dancers MacNeil and Roger Gonzalez Hibner appeared as
guests with the Yorke contingent, dancing MacNeil's intense duet
"Canta/Levantar" to recordings by the Balanescu Quartet.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning with movement snapshots separated by blackouts, the duet
soon connected those initial images in a nonlinear portrait of a
relationship. Unusual concepts of support sometimes imposed extreme
contortions on MacNeil and equally challenging partnering feats on
Gonzalez Hibner, both exemplary.</TE>
<TE>   They also turned up in the charming, chaotic "Dorm Mice," a
collaborative product of a two-week Colburn summer workshop. It
enlisted MacNeil and Yorke-Edgell as the elders in an eight-member,
multigenerational slumber party and Gonzalez Hibner as the resident
boogeyman. But its finest achievement came from the musicianship of
Ai Nihira, Grace An and Cynthia Gong in a trio by Joseph Haydn.</TE>
<TE>   Under the direction of Karen Lundgren, the 13-player Colburn flute
choir premiered "Suite Butterfly."</TE>
<TE>   This three-part nature study by Phyllis Avidan Louke began with
hurdy-gurdy sonorities, grew mysterious in its central section and
then cheerily dance-like. But the Yorke dancers sat this one out.</TE>

<HD>South Coast Rep's Garden Party</HD>
<DH>Five short plays on the Latino experience make for an
enchanting 'California Scenarios' at Isamu Noguchi's Costa Mesa
sculpture garden.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Isamu Noguchi's sculpture garden in Costa Mesa was named
"California Scenario," the title was a virtual invitation for a
theater company to present a California-set play--or five--within the
space, which evokes the varied textures of the California landscape.</LD>
<LD>   With South Coast Repertory located only one block north of the
garden, it's surprising that it took almost two decades for South
Coast to produce there.</LD>
<LD>   Last summer, "California Scenarios" opened in workshop form,
presenting five short site-specific plays drawn from the California
Latino experience, produced by South Coast's Hispanic Playwrights
Project. Now the production has returned with four of last year's
plays and a new fifth one.</LD>
<TE>   It's an enchanting experience. The site envelops five sketchy
texts and creates a sum greater than the parts.</TE>
<TE>   Directed by Juliette Carrillo, the evening summons the spirits of
early Californians in two scenes and juxtaposes them with the
struggles of recent Latino immigrants, ending with a lighthearted
glimpse under the slick surfaces of the immediate area.</TE>
<TE>   The audience walks to five different locations within the garden,
carrying folding chairs to each new site (ushers can help if
necessary).</TE>
<TE>   On opening night, wispy pink clouds reflected the final vestiges
of daylight as the audience gathered in front of the garden's desert
mound. It's used for Anne Garcia-Romero's ironic mini-farce, "Desert
Longing, or Las Aventureras," set just outside early Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The dashing bandit Tiburcio Vasquez has arranged a nocturnal
rendezvous with four women who have visited him in jail. None of the
women knows about the others, but they're soon tripping over each
other under the stars, waiting for Vasquez as if he were a more
romantic precursor to Godot.</TE>
<TE>   Next is Jose Cruz Gonzalez's "Odysseus Cruz," in which Homer's
hero is transformed into a smuggler of men across the modern-day
U.S.-Mexican border. Returning from one disastrous trip, he stops at
an oasis and is assaulted by the souls of the men who have died.
Vividly clad spirits make dramatic entrances and exits, and a singer
narrates in Spanish and English. Although the scene is striking
enough, the subject calls out for a full-length epic.</TE>
<TE>   This summer's only new entry, Richard Coca's "The Hanging of
Josefa," returns us to the 19th century, in Gold Rush country.</TE>
<TE>   Against a fittingly wooded background and with a "based on actual
events" advisory in the program, we see the story of a young woman
who murdered a new settler after he had invaded her home and insulted
her. Delivered in a presentational style with a mysterious red-clad
narrator, the play is another example of material that doesn't quite
fit the short-play format.</TE>
<TE>   Joann Farias' "Two Steps Forward, One Step Back" takes us to an
Orange County strawberry field, represented by a steeply graded
hillside. One of the farm workers gazes across an expanse of rock and
a little brook, as the audience looks on from two sides, and
encounters apparitions from his life in Mexico. He yields to their
call, in a beautifully wrought moment.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Luis Alfaro's "The Gardens of Aztlan (An Acto Hecho a
Mano)" takes place in the very spot where we've gathered. First the
men in the cast hold a spirited, attitude-spiked conversation about
Orange County. Then one of the women emerges from the nearby El
Torito, playing one of the restaurant's tortilleras, in search of the
county's eponymous oranges.</TE>
<TE>   Soon she's joined by the other women--identically dressed refugees
from La Salsa, Del Taco and Taco Bell.</TE>
<TE>   Alfaro uses the circular imagery of tortillas and oranges in a
riff on the idea of returning full circle to what this area was like
before the arrival of the buildings that look down on the garden.</TE>
<TE>   The evening ends with hot tortillas from the real El Torito,
served to the audience by the cast.</TE>
<TE>   Javier Godinez provides unobtrusive musical strains, and
Christopher Akerlind adds another extraordinary credit to his summer
of lighting some of the region's most adventurous productions,
including "King Lear" at the Brewery and "The House of Bernarda Alba"
at the Mark Taper Forum.</TE>
<TE>   "California Scenarios," Noguchi Sculpture Garden, 3202 Avenue of
the Arts (behind the Comerica building at 611 Anton Blvd.), Costa
Mesa. Tuesday-Sunday, 8 p.m. Ends Sunday. $15-$25. (714) 708-5555.

<LD>"I'm short." "I don't like my hair." "My eyes are too big."</LD>
<LD>   Too thin, too fat, too dumb, too slow: Older elementary school
kids, "tweeners" and teens have endless ways of putting themselves
and others down for not conforming to media-driven images of physical
and fashion perfection.</LD>
<LD>   The results can be devastating. Hurt feelings at best; at worst,
anything from eating disorders and depression to violence to self or
others.</LD>
<TE>   Tonight's short-but-to-the-point Disney Channel documentary,
"Confident for Life: Kids and Body Image" (7 p.m.), while not a cure,
offers young viewers some friendly, practical perspective.</TE>
<TE>   At middle school peer counseling sessions, at a camp for
overweight kids, at a photo shoot for plus-size models, at a hockey
rink, at home and at school, boys and girls discuss feelings, media
images and ways to build self-worth by recognizing and believing in
their own strengths. Peers who overcame their own self-consciousness
and low self-esteem talk about what worked.</TE>
<TE>   Proving that perfection isn't always what it seems, a digital
retoucher shows how she makes magazine models look perfect, shrinking
arms and thighs, widening eyes, straightening teeth and evening out
lip lines. Lovely plus-size models talk about their more realistic
body shapes.</TE>
<TE>   This kid-bolstering special is another in a series from
producer-director Barbara Kopple (an Academy Award-winner for her
documentaries "Harlan County, U.S.A." and "American Dream") and
executive producer and youth activist Laurie Meadoff. Their earlier
joint efforts for the Disney Channel include "Friends for Life:
Living With AIDS" and "Learning for Life: Kids and Learning
Differences."</TE>

<HD>Earjam Festival Brings Fringe Into the Foreground</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEF WOODARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For its third annual edition, the new-music fest Earjam moved from
its tight, air-challenged quarters downtown to the relatively
wide-open spaces of the Furious Theater, in Pasadena's Armory
Northwest. Aside from improved creature comforts, the venue's sweep
served as an operative metaphor and apt container for music generally
open in form, content and idiom.</LD>
<LD>   With Earjam, organizers Julie Adler and Jacki Apple have fashioned
an eclectic sonic cavalcade. Friday and Saturday programs spotlighted
more than 30 area musicians in the jazz, contemporary music and
experimental realms, many connected with CalArts. The festival's real
value is the connective tissue it provides to the region's cultural
fringe-dwellers. It brings the underground into the light.</LD>
<LD>   Much of Friday's program relied on the power and intimacy of duos.
Anna Homler offered her playfully cryptic songs in "invented
language," abetted by toy instruments and against the elegant foil of
Michael Intriere's cello playing. Formidable trombonist Bruce Fowler
and bassoonist Sara Schoenbeck began their improv in remote corners
of the reverberant space, moving slowly closer, in physical and
musical proximity.</LD>
<TE>   In his way, David Rosenboom enacted a self-contained duo
performance, playing violin and processing it through his laptop, so
that real time and processed time were twin protagonists. Violinist
Jeff Gauthier's quasi-classical melodic shards contrasted nicely with
partner G.E. Stinson's lovely electric-guitar din, textural to the
core. Non-western sonorities graced the interplay of Susan Rawcliffe,
on self-made wind instruments and didgeridoo, with ever-flexible
percussionist Brad Dutz.</TE>
<TE>   In non-duo news, multi-reedist Vinny Golia worked up a gusting
solo world of sound on the rare, contrabass saxophone-like tubax, and
organist Wayne Peet led an electric quartet recalling Miles Davis of
the 1970s "Get Up With It" period.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the evening's improvisational orientation, the
show-stealer was anything but extemporaneous. Jacqueline Humbert, who
recently dazzled locally with Robert Ashley's opera "Foreign
Experiences," unveiled her unique singspiel style against elaborate
taped accompaniment.</TE>
<TE>   Humbert rendered crisp readings of idiosyncratic neo-art song--Sam
Ashley's dreamily tropical "Mosquito Love" and Rosenboom's hypnotic
"Attunement," with expansive chord shifts, a philosophical text, and
Humbert's dry, surreal dramatics effectively seizing the room's
ambient sprawl.</TE>

<HD>Fresh or Recycled Air? Colds Don't Care</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINDA MARSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Air travelers who worry about picking up germs from recycled cabin
air can breathe a little easier: Passengers inhaling recirculated air
don't come down with more colds than travelers on planes ventilated
with fresh air, a new study says.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers at UC San Francisco interviewed more than 1,100 people
who had flown from the San Francisco Bay Area to Denver in 1999.
About 19% of travelers on planes with recirculated air reported
getting colds after their flight, while a comparable number--21%--of
passengers on aircraft with fresh air got colds, according to the
study, which was published in the July 24 issue of the Journal of the
American Medical Assn.</LD>
<LD>   The study was launched in response to a widespread perception that
flying increases risks of getting a cold, researchers said. Outbreaks
of influenza and tuberculosis aboard aircraft have been documented,
and--in other settings at least--sitting in confined spaces with
limited ventilation for prolonged periods increases one's risk of
catching a cold. Further, recirculated air had been shown to boost
rates of cold virus transmission in Army barracks.</LD>
<TE>   "This had never been studied in airplanes, " said Dr. Jessica
Nutik Zitter, a study coauthor. "There are many routes of
transmission for the cold virus, but recirculated air isn't one of
them."</TE>
<TE>   The study should be welcome news for passengers--most of the
planes ventilated with fresh air have been retired since the study
was conducted. In older aircraft, fresh air was pumped into the
cabins after it had been compressed, humidified and cooled by the
engines, but the process burned up a lot of fuel. To boost energy
efficiency, aircraft makers started using ventilation systems that
recirculated cabin air in the early 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Newer aircraft recirculate as much as 50% of cabin air, which
passes through heavy-duty filters that pick up infectious bugs before
the air is pumped back into the passenger compartment. (A filter's
ability to capture tiny viruses, however, is limited.)</TE>
<TE>   With the post-Sept. 11 airport security restrictions, a study of
this nature could probably never be done again. "We were beating the
runways looking for volunteers," says Zitter.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers buttonholed travelers waiting at the gates for their
flights, eliminating people who had colds already, had flown during
the previous week, or had plans for additional air travel before the
follow-up interview.</TE>
<TE>   They distributed preflight questionnaires to volunteers who met
their criteria, and even boarded planes awaiting takeoff to retrieve
the surveys.</TE>
<TE>   "We were running up and down the aisles grabbing questionnaires
from people right before the planes took off," says Zitter.
Passengers were then contacted about a week later to determine
whether they had contracted a cold.</TE>
<TE>   Still, "these results don't address the increased risk of getting
sick if you fly," says Zitter. Cold viruses can also be transmitted
from physical contact with someone who is infected. And there's
plenty of opportunity to spread germs when you're sitting in close
quarters with 100 or so strangers on an aircraft--by touching
bathroom door handles, upright trays, armrests, even pillows and
blankets that have been used by people who are sick.</TE>
<TE>   You just can't blame the cabin air anymore for your cold.</TE>

<HD>A Positive Outlook on Aging May Mean a Longer Life</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One key to a longer life may be the way you think about your own
aging.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers who followed 660 residents of a small Ohio town found
that those with positive attitudes toward aging lived 7 1/2 years
longer than those with negative views. The 338 men and 322 women,
ages 50 to 94, were recruited in 1975 to participate in the Ohio
Longitudinal Study of Aging and Retirement. At the time, they were
asked to agree or disagree with statements about aging, such as: "As
you get older, you get less useful." Researchers also assessed
whether they were as happy and had as much pep as in their younger
days.</LD>
<LD>   The researchers, led by Becca R. Levy, an assistant professor of
epidemiology and public health at Yale University, tracked what had
happened to each of them through 1998. Those with the most positive
attitudes survived a median of 22.6 years after their initial
interview; those with negative views lived just 15 years.</LD>
<TE>   "I think part of it is these [aging] stereotypes are internalized
at a very young age," Levy said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the original 1975 study didn't have any formal measure of
depression, it did rate overall morale among study subjects. When
Levy and her colleagues factored out age, gender, socioeconomic
status, loneliness and level of physical functioning, those with
better attitudes about aging lived longer than those who simply had
good morale.</TE>
<TE>   The findings appear in the August issue of the Journal of
Personality and Social Psychology, published by the American
Psychological Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford Singer, a Manhattan psychologist who specializes in
aging, said the study didn't prove that positive attitudes about
aging alone accounted for their longevity. He said other factors
likely come into play, such as an overall optimistic outlook.</TE>

<LD>Women who suffer constipation-causing irritable bowel syndrome won
their first government-approved treatment on Wednesday. But while its
maker predicts Zelnorm will prove a big hit, a critic already is
charging that health authorities shouldn't have let it sell.</LD>
<LD>   Zelnorm's approval comes just weeks after the Food and Drug
Administration let another controversial bowel drug, Lotronex, back
on the market, two years after serious side effects halted its sales.</LD>
<LD>   The two drugs are for different types of irritable bowel syndrome,
a mysterious disorder that gives millions of Americans, mostly women,
abdominal pain and either severe diarrhea or constipation or both.
Lotronex is for the diarrhea type, while Zelnorm on Wednesday became
the only FDA-approved therapy for women with constipation-predominant
IBS.</LD>
<TE>   Laxatives don't relieve the cause of IBS. Zelnorm appears to go a
step further, acting on nerve cells to speed the colon's movement of
stools.</TE>
<TE>   Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group, attacked the FDA's
decision, saying it was ignoring early signals of Zelnorm risks just
as the agency two years ago downplayed complaints that eventually
derailed Lotronex.</TE>

<LD>The Japanese have a word--karoshi--for sudden death caused by
cardiovascular disease from working long hours with too little sleep.
And now, Japanese researchers have found that overwork and sleep
deprivation can double or triple the risk of a heart attack.</LD>
<LD>   Workaholism and sleep deprivation, of course, aren't unique to
Japan. Several studies in the United States, the Netherlands, Denmark
and Sweden have shown that death from heart disease is highest among
those who work overtime. The Japanese study had a narrower focus:
Researchers examined the relationship between working and sleep in
men who had survived their first heart attack.</LD>
<LD>   Two hundred and sixty men, ages 40 to 79, who had a heart attack,
or myocardial infarctions, were compared with 445 healthy men matched
by age and living in similar areas.</LD>
<TE>   All the men were asked questions about their work habits, medical
histories and lifestyles. Such health factors as weight, smoking and
drinking habits and occupation were taken into account in comparing
the men's heart-attack risk.</TE>
<TE>   Men who worked more than 61 hours a week had twice the risk of a
heart attack as those working 40 hours or less per week. Sleeping
five hours or less two or more days a week increased the risk of a
heart attack by two to three times. Also, men who had been working
long hours very recently were more likely to have a heart attack than
those who had put in a lot of extra hours less recently in the past
year.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the researchers report, sleep deprivation and lack of
rest may trigger a heart attack. . "Working 40 hours a week and
sleeping seven hours a night is optimal," says Dr. Ying Liu, a member
of the Fukuoka Heart Study Group that involved more than 20
universities and hospitals in Fukuoka, Japan. When overwork is
unavoidable, she advises people to try to take a couple of days off,
get more rest and eat more healthfully to offset the risk.</TE>

<TE>   Using Sunscreen Does Not Increase Risk of Melanoma, Researchers
Find</TE>
<TE>   Several studies have indicated that when sunscreen use goes up,
the risk of melanoma increases. This surprising finding has stumped
some experts. Could it be that sunscreen creates a false sense of
security and leads us to stay out in the sun longer than we should?
Researchers have now taken a closer look at the data from those
studies and many others. Their conclusion: Sunscreen can't be blamed
for melanoma.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Michael Huncharek and colleagues at the Meta-Analysis Research
Group in Stevens Point, Wis., pooled data from more than 9,000 people
who participated in several melanoma studies between 1966 and 1999.
They found that sunscreen use did not increase a person's chances of
developing the deadly skin cancer.</TE>
<TE>   The link between sunscreen and melanoma appears to be due to bias
in some of those earlier studies, the researchers said. While some
hospital studies found only a marginal increase in melanoma, others
found increases ranging from 50% to 400%, says Huncharek, of the
Marshfield Clinic Cancer Center in Marshfield, Wis. He says this
variation indicates a bias in the study. One reason it happens with
hospital-based studies is that they typically include only patients
treated at that center. Characteristics of patients seen at one
center can be very different from those treated at another.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the researchers found that studies using information
from tumor registries, which collect data from everyone who has
cancer regardless of where they are treated, were more consistent.
Until more conclusive data is available, the researchers say that
wearing sunscreen as a cancer prevention strategy is a wise practice.</TE>

<TE>   Study Finds Multiple Therapies Boost the Cancer Survivor Rate</TE>
<TE>   Killing rapidly growing malignant cells is one goal of cancer
treatment; preventing them from coming back is another. Some
therapies do both, but often two therapies are better than one. Now a
long-term European study of men with aggressive prostate cancer shows
that combining radiation therapy with a drug that suppresses male
hormone is nearly twice as effective as radiation therapy alone.</TE>
<TE>   The new study builds on prior research by the European
Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer begun in the late
1980s, involving more than 400 prostate cancer patients with disease
that had progressed beyond the gland itself but not yet spread to
other parts of the body.</TE>
<TE>   Half the men received radiation therapy alone for seven weeks. The
other half received the same radiation therapy and monthly injections
of the testosterone-reducing drug Zoladex (goserelin) for three
years. Preliminary results of the combined therapy were quite
impressive, but some scientists thought the benefit might not last.
"This long-term study is much more convincing," says Dr. Judd W.
Moul, director of the Center for Prostate Disease Research at Walter
Reed Army Medical Center in Rockville, Md..</TE>
<TE>   The latest study found that, after five years, 74% of those
treated with radiation and hormone therapies still had no recurrence
of prostate cancer, compared to 40% of those who were cancer-free
after receiving radiation alone.</TE>
<TE>   Today, most U.S. males have their prostate cancer detected early
because of widespread screening. If the cancer has advanced locally
upon diagnosis, however, the combination of radiation and hormone
therapies is now commonly used, Moul says. Monthly injections are no
longer necessary because the hormone-blocking drugs are now available
in a longer-acting form that can be administered every three months
or longer.</TE>
<TE>   Hormone-blocking drugs, such as Zoladex, cause the brain to stop
stimulating testosterone production in the testes, producing a kind
of chemical castration. The drug has side effects, such as hot
flashes, which get better when use is discontinued. The Lancet

<TE>   Surgery May Help Children With Sleep Apnea, Behavioral Problems</TE>
<TE>   Some parents of children with sleep apnea have believed that
certain behavior and learning difficulties are related to their
child's bedtime problems. Now researchers in New York have found that
there is a link. The good news is that the researchers also found
that the children's behavior and quality of life improved after their
tonsils and adenoids were removed.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers at Long Island College Hospital studied 64
children with sleep apnea whose enlarged tonsils and adenoids were
partially blocking their breathing passages. In some cases, surgery
was for chronic tonsillitis alone. These children were included so
the researchers had a range of breathing problems to compare.</TE>
<TE>   Using behavioral surveys completed by the parents, the researchers
found a high prevalence of behavioral and emotional problems in a
quarter of those with the disorder. Three months after the surgery,
the children improved significantly, particularly in measures of
anxiety, depression and withdrawn behavior and aggressive and
destructive behaviors.</TE>
<TE>   Why the apnea caused behavior problems isn't known, but
researchers say disrupted sleep and lack of oxygen must play a role.</TE>

<HD>As Dietary Detours Go, Churros Aren't Way Off Course</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly every culture has found some irresistible way to fry dough: In
Israel, there are the jelly-filled sufganiyot; in China, a twisted
dough stick known as you tiao; and then there are the funnel cakes of
Pennsylvania Dutch country. We can thank Spanish explorers for the
skinny, crispy treats called churros--sold throughout South- ern
California, from Disneyland to historic Olvera Street in downtown Los
Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The fluted snacks are believed to have originated in Spain and
arrived in the New World on the ships of explorers, food historians
say. Over the centuries, they became as much a part of breakfast in
Mexico City and Buenos Aires as in Madrid, often dunked into a cup of
steaming hot chocolate.</LD>
<LD>   They can be found wherever Spanish-speaking cultures settled in
this country and are especially popular in the Southwest. Because
churros are more of an occasional treat than a staple of daily
eating, nutritionists need not fret too much about all the refined
carbohydrates and calories. And let's face it, when you pick up some
churros, wrapped in a sheet of bakery tissue, you know you're
indulging.</LD>
<TE>   "If you're looking for a nutritional powerhouse, this isn't it,"
says Joan Carter, a registered dietitian at Baylor College of
Medicine in Houston. "It's a fun food."</TE>
<TE>   So how big a dietary detour is that churro? Let's look at the
ingredients. A batter essentially consisting of water, flour, eggs,
sugar and a pinch of salt is piped through a pastry bag into long
strips, deep-fried in vegetable oil, then rolled in cinnamon mixed
with sugar. (The Spanish use sugar alone.) At Mr. Churro on Olvera
Street, owner Leticia Delgadillo's recipe includes vinegar, which
makes a smoother batter. Other chefs enrich their batters with
margarine or butter. There are also cream- and custard-filled
varieties.</TE>
<TE>   How do those ingredients shape up nutritionally? The recipe for
Mr. Churro's freshly made treats is proprietary, so a good reference
point might be a 10-inch, 2.6-ounce plain churro from California
Churros, a Montclair firm that supplies frozen churros that can be
heated at home. Based on information on the company Web site, one
churro contains 237 calories--about the same as a small bag of French
fries or a doughnut, said Carter.</TE>
<TE>   The churro also contains about 9 of the 65 fat grams recommended
by the USDA on a 2,000-calorie-a-day diet. It has nearly 35 of the
day's recommended 300 grams of carbohydrates, which the body breaks
down into sugar--and that's before it's been rolled in
cinnamon-sugar. There's less than a gram of dietary fiber to slow
down the breakdown of those carbohydrates, although the fat does slow
the rate at which your stomach digests the churro. Not a lot of
protein to help build muscle and tissues--just 3.9 grams from the
flour and eggs. Don't forget the salt, about 226 milligrams, or about
10% of the recommended daily limit of 2,400 milligrams. Enriched
flour provides negligible amounts of calcium, iron and vitamins.</TE>
<TE>   Carolyn Katzin, a certified nutrition specialist in Brentwood,
worries about the effects of reheating the frying oil for batch after
batch of churros. Fresh oil contains vitamin E or a preservative to
keep it from turning rancid. But as soon as you heat the oil, it
begins oxidizing, which is the chemical process of going rancid. Each
time you reheat it, some of the fatty acids are released into the
air, where they combine with dust particles. As your nose is
detecting the characteristic aroma, the reused oil in that deep-fat
fryer is changing chemically, picking up more hydrogen (thus the term
hydrogenated oils) and forming trans-fatty acids, which are
increasingly associated with heart disease and other chronic
illnesses.</TE>
<TE>   So where does the deep-fried churro fit into your day's calories?</TE>
<TE>   Carter says it's a reasonable amount for a snack splurge: "My
goal," she says, "is 300 calories or less for an indulgence. If I
want to be good, I eat an apple and then I get 90 calories."</TE>
<TE>   As for all those carbs, the real health concern is whether they
end up being transformed into excess body fat. And that's going to
depend on whether you burn all the calories you eat. The bottom line:
If that churro boosts your food intake one day, cut back on
subsequent meals and snacks, or jump on the treadmill. The average
person could neutralize the potential caloric damage of a single
churro with a 2.5-mile run.</TE>
<TE>   Healthy, normal-weight children who show no signs of a
pre-diabetic condition called glucose intolerance shouldn't have any
problem with churros as a special treat, Carter says, because
"they'll burn everything you give them for energy."</TE>
<TE>   While the churro has little to commend itself nutritionally,
Carter says, food is about more than nutrition: "It offers social
bonding, cultural identity; it offers fun and pleasure."</TE>
<TE>   So don't be afraid of churros, she adds. "You will not wake up
tomorrow weighing 10 pounds more."</TE>

staff turnover, improves patient outcomes and doesn't cost much more,
why aren't all nursing homes run like this?</LD>
<LD>   "Making this kind of change is unbelievably tough," says Ron
Rothstein, president of Levindale Hebrew Geriatric Center in
Baltimore, whose 1999 conversion to the Eden Alternative philosophy
brought residents into regular contact with plants, pets and
children. "It requires a tremendous commitment from everybody. And
there's a punitive regulatory system that makes [providers] afraid of
change."</LD>
<LD>   Nursing home inspectors are typically more concerned about safety
and medical issues than vaguer measures such as resident happiness.</LD>
<TE>   Will a dog in a nursing home bite or cause allergic reactions?
Will giving residents more freedom to roam lead to more falls? Will
moving long rows of chairs out from the wall and rearranging them in
cozy chat groups block fire-exit routes?</TE>
<TE>   With a nursing home's reputation and license riding on government
inspections, managers are understandably skittish about trying
innovations that regulators might question. There are also upfront
costs to redesigning facilities. For example, Levindale spent $60,000
on a children's playground, $70,000 on a greenhouse and $500,000 on a
cafe-style dining room.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, according to Rothstein, Eden homes spend roughly
$30,000 a year on quality-of-life enhancements such as pet food and
horticulture. For-profit facilities, which make up 70% of nursing
homes, may face a greater challenge here than nonprofits, which can
raise funds through charity drives.</TE>
<TE>   "One big issue of resistance came from the front-line caregivers,"
Rothstein says. "They said, 'We have to give care to our residents
and now we have to take care of dogs and cats, too?' It has to be
everybody's responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   At Levindale, every staff member--from the accountant to the
maintenance engineer--is expected to form a close relationship with a
resident, as well as pitch in with plant and pet care. Instituting
this type of cultural change can be difficult. Middle managers must
shift their duties to direct care, for example, and registered nurses
may need to give up some authority to nursing assistants.</TE>
<TE>   Some balking has to be expected. Nursing assistants may be loath
to take on the extra work that "empowerment" brings--making their own
schedules, broadening their responsibilities. Families may question
the notion of giving Mom so much freedom. Is it really good for her
to override her doctor's dietary advice and have that piece of
chocolate cake? Is a bowl of ice cream at midnight really beneficial?</TE>
<TE>   Still, says Tom Burke, spokesman for the American Health Care
Assn., a trade group for for-profit homes: "Anything that opens a
facility up to the community is a step forward, and any interaction
that leaves residents feeling less isolated is very valuable."</TE>

<HD>Gluten-Free May Add to the Quality of Life</HD>
<DH>Diet* For those with celiac disease, abstaining from wheat
is a must.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA KING</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For some people the issue of refined and unrefined is moot when it
comes to wheat, barley and rye.</LD>
<LD>   These three grains in their refined and unrefined forms contain a
number of proteins called gluten, which damages the small intestine
of those who carry the gene for celiac disease. Those who have celiac
disease must eliminate gluten from their diet. Otherwise their
increasing inability to absorb nutrients can lead to a number of
serious ailments such as anemia, osteoporosis and nervous system
disorders. Other problems can include abdominal bloating and pain,
gas, fatigue, delayed growth, mouth sores and missed menstrual
periods.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Alessio Fasano, a pediatric gastroenterologist at the
University of Maryland Medical School in Baltimore, says celiac
disease is an autoimmune disorder that was once thought to be very
rare. However, his studies put the incidence of celiac disease in
this country at one in 150. And Fasano says his research also
suggests that gluten is toxic even for individuals who do not have
the gene for celiac disease.</LD>
<TE>   These days the gluten-free diet has created a thriving cottage
industry. A glossy magazine called "Living Without" features ads for
everything from gluten-free decadent chocolate cake mix to a gadget
that detects gluten lurking in food to T-shirts announcing "Gluten
free. Got a problem with that?"</TE>
<TE>   Publisher Peggy Wagener started the magazine four years ago after
she was diagnosed with celiac disease but says her readership
includes the parents of autistic and hyperactive children and people
with a variety of autoimmune diseases who say their conditions
improve on a gluten-free diet.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, some readers who don't have a related disease or
medical condition also avoid wheat because of its high gluten
content. "Some people just don't feel good eating wheat," says
Wagener.</TE>
<TE>   Melissa Diane Smith says she's one of them. She tested negative
for celiac disease but says she was incapacitated by fatigue until
she dropped gluten-containing grains from her diet and cut back on
other grains as well.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, a nutritional counselor and author of the new book "Going
Against the Grain: How Reducing and Avoiding Grains Can Revitalize
Your Health," says there are millions of people who are intolerant to
common grains. She advises clients to cut back or cut out grains to
remedy allergic symptoms, including aches and pains and digestive
upset as well as extra pounds.</TE>
<TE>   But mainstream health advisors are skeptical about the undeniable
boomlet in wheat-free and grain-phobic living. Celiac disease may be
underreported, but it's not an epidemic, according to Susan Bowerman,
assistant director of the Center for Human Nutrition at UCLA. Neither
are wheat allergies: "I don't think they're all that common."</TE>

grains offer protection against disease.</LD>

<HD>Sugar-Free Life Gets Sweeter</HD>
<DH>Diet* The FDA-approved neotame offers another choice, but
experts say no artificial sweetener guarantees weight loss.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLY SQUIRES</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With a nod of approval this month from the Food and Drug
Administration, the latest sugar substitute--neotame--is poised to
become a new ingredient in baked goods, soft drinks, chewing gum,
frozen desserts and other products.</LD>
<LD>   Already approved in Australia and New Zealand, neotame joins the
sweeteners aspartame (sold as NutraSweet and Equal), acesulfame
potassium (Sunett and Sweet One), saccharin (Sweet'N Low) and
sucralose (Splenda) now on the market. Neotame, which is about 7,000
to 13,000 times sweeter than sugar, will be the most concentrated
sugar substitute available.</LD>
<LD>   Sugar substitutes are one way, of course, to soothe a sweet tooth
with fewer calories than sugar, honey or molasses. A 2000 survey
found that 80% of adults in the United States use sugar substitutes
at least once every two weeks, according to the Calorie Control
Council, a trade group of diet food and beverage makers.</LD>
<TE>   The American Diabetes Assn. and the U.S. Dietary Guidelines both
support the use of sugar substitutes. And a large clinical trial at
Harvard University found that "people who used high-intensity
sweeteners [rather than sugar] were able to maintain a lower weight"
than they did without the products, says George Blackburn, associate
director of nutrition at Harvard and the study's lead author.</TE>
<TE>   But foods sweetened with sugar substitutes are not necessarily
low-calorie. For example, ice cream sweetened with a substitute may
still be loaded with fat. "Unless you reduce the total calories you
eat or increase physical activity, using sugar substitutes will not
cause you to lose weight," the Dietary Guidelines note.</TE>
<TE>   How many calories can sugar substitutes save? Depends on how much
you use. Trade a teaspoon of sugar for a packet of sugar substitute
and you'll save 16 calories. Drink a can of diet soda instead of
regular and cut 140 calories.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, but what about safety? That question has dogged sugar
substitutes since the federal government banned the popular
cyclamates in 1969 because of cancer concerns.</TE>
<TE>   As Michael Jacobson, director of the Center for Science in the
Public Interest, or CSPI, puts it, the evidence for safety of
substitutes is not a "slam-dunk" either for or against their use. But
it is strong enough against certain products--saccharin, for
example--that the CSPI has asked the FDA to ban it. "There's
substantial evidence that saccharin causes cancer," Jacobson says.
The Calorie Control Council counters that saccharin is approved for
use in 100 countries: "Considerable saccharin research indicates
safety at human levels of consumption."</TE>
<TE>   CSPI also has concerns about acesulfame potassium because safety
studies on it are of "very poor quality, and indicate a possible
cancer risk," Jacobson says. Both the FDA and an expert committee
advising the World Health Organization set acceptable daily intakes
for the sweetener at 15 milligrams (about 26 packets of Sweet One).
The Calorie Control Council notes that it has been used since 1988 in
the United States "with no known documented adverse health effects."</TE>
<TE>   The most widely used sugar substitute? Aspartame. In 1999, there
was a flurry of Internet traffic about neurotoxic effects of
aspartame, "but there's scanty real evidence to support it," Jacobson
says. "As with anything, people who believe they are sensitive should
stop eating it."</TE>
<TE>   Sucralose is the one substitute that is made from sugar. But
because this sweetener can't be digested, it adds no calories. And
since it doesn't alter blood sugar levels, it's an option for
diabetics.</TE>
<TE>   Not scrutinized by the FDA is stevioside, a dietary supplement
sold as Stevia and used as a sugar substitute. While it is approved
for use in 10 countries, including Japan, the WHO and the European
Union's Scientific Committee for Food both concluded that there was
not yet enough solid research data to declare that stevioside can
safely be used as a sweetener.</TE>

<HD>Nursing Homes Accent the 'Home'</HD>
<DH>New practices at a handful of facilities make happiness a
top priority</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH BAKER</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You enter the nursing home to the sound of chirping birds. Sunlight
streams through large windows and, across a courtyard, pansies and
daffodils surround a small greenhouse. A black cat stalks down a
corridor, looking as if it owned the place. Your grandmother's
nursing home was nothing like this.</LD>
<LD>   Like a handful of homes across the country, Levindale Hebrew
Geriatric Center in Baltimore uses plants, pets and regular
interaction with children to enliven and give meaning to the lives of
frail elderly residents. Such innovations are the result of
philosophies that share a common goal: to put the "home" into nursing
home and scrap the hospital (some say prison) model.</LD>
<LD>   The pioneering homes, which offer services at roughly the same
cost as traditional facilities, judge their performance not only on
medical outcomes, such as fewer bedsores or falls, but on whether
nursing home life is a pleasant, even vibrant, experience. Hallmarks
of these facilities include less institutional design, greater
resident choice in how they spend their days, nursing assistants
empowered to make more decisions and strengthened relationships
between residents and staff.</LD>
<TE>   Innovators profess no small ambitions. "Our mission is to advocate
and facilitate deep system change and transformation in the culture
of aging," says Rosemarie Fagan, executive director of the Pioneer
Network, a coalition of providers, family members and others founded
in 1997 to help reinvent nursing homes. "The nursing home is a
microcosm of our society and our values. It really mirrors ... who we
are."</TE>
<TE>   With 1.5 million people living in the nation's 17,000 nursing
homes and an estimated 40% of Americans expected to spend some time
there in the future, according to University of North Carolina
researcher Philip D. Sloane, the demand for improvement is strong.
"Whenever you have a [place] that's viewed as so bad people say they
would rather be dead than be in one, you have a problem," Sloane
says.</TE>
<TE>   Passage in 1987 of the Nursing Home Reform Act--which includes a
10-point Resident's Bill of Rights (such as the right to be treated
with dignity and to exercise self-determination)--prompted industry
changes, such as a reduction in the use of physical restraints. In
1998, the Health Care Financing Administration announced the Nursing
Home Initiative, aimed at addressing persistent problems.</TE>
<TE>   What's needed now, say many in the field, is not more regulations
but tougher enforcement--and a change of mind-set. In the old medical
model, the goal was to keep residents fed, dressed and bathed as
efficiently as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "They might be miserable, embarrassed or cold, they may have the
food forced down them, but we would have accomplished our goal,"
Sloane says. "But if your goal is for them to have a good experience,
we approach it differently. Maybe we won't bathe them as often or
maybe they won't have exactly the right diet, but they'll be
happier."</TE>
<TE>   What may help the program catch on is this: Breaking the industry
mold may make good business sense, at least in the long term. For
example, at Levindale, the average daily occupancy rate jumped some
10 points to its current 98% after implementation of the Eden
Alternative philosophy. The higher rate, says Levindale President Ron
Rothstein, has offset renovation and other costs associated with the
changeover.</TE>
<TE>   It may sound reasonable, but it hasn't caught on in a big way yet:
Fagan estimates that fewer than 1% of nursing homes have embarked on
the kind of transformation espoused by the Pioneer Network.</TE>
<TE>   One nursing home implementing such an approach is Providence Mount
St. Vincent in Seattle. In 1991, when the home needed remodeling, its
leaders decided to turn it into a facility based on
"resident-directed care." The home was reconfigured into
"neighborhoods" of two dozen residents each, with a new on-site
day-care center for children of staff and others in the community.</TE>
<TE>   "Residents are now at the top of the organization chart," says
administrator Charlene Boyd, a Pioneer Network founder. "We got rid
of most of the middle management and decentralized food service,
laundry and housekeeping." Staff members pitch in and help residents
with such tasks as getting a cup of coffee, doing a load of laundry
or simply playing cards and talking.</TE>
<TE>   "The entire building feels like a neighborhood in some ways, with
pets and little kids coming and going," says Sandra Twist, whose
mother, Meredith Groat, is a resident there. "People are in a variety
of settings--in their room watching TV or reading or out in the open
area near the kitchen, which is nicely lit with round tables. Some
[residents] are pulled up to the nurses' station, chatting. On Mom's
unit there's a solarium. It's got a computer for people to check
their e-mail. Another floor has a nicely appointed library, like an
old gentleman's club. Another has an aviary."</TE>
<TE>   Being able to decide when to go to bed or what to eat is
especially important for people like her mother, she says, whose
choices are limited by chronic disease.</TE>
<TE>   Other innovators have seized on the same concept.</TE>
<TE>   "Why should [nursing home residents] lose their rights?" asks Eric
Haider, chief executive of Crestview Nursing Home in Bethany, Mo.,
who has developed a model he calls the Ideal Nursing Home. "If they
have a physical or mental problem, it doesn't mean they have lost who
they were. They are good citizens. They fought in our wars, built our
bridges and highways. Now they're in the nursing home. It's our job
to give them the best--not by bossing them around, but by simply
asking them what they want and honoring their desires."</TE>
<TE>   At Crestview, this means giving residents the same choices the
rest of us take for granted. Want to go fishing? A pond is nearby.
You'd like to buy a gift for your granddaughter who's coming to
visit? A staff member will drive you to the mall. Got a hankering for
pizza, but it's not on today's menu? "The typical [nursing home]
answer is, 'We don't have pizza,' " Haider says. "The answer at
Crestview is, 'Would you like to go to Pizza Hut, or do you want us
to go and bring it back?' "</TE>
<TE>   This first-class service is not reserved for an elite group but is
offered to every resident, the majority of whom, as in most nursing
homes, are low-income people on Medicaid with various levels of
dementia. Crestview charges $79 a day--just below the middle range
nationally of $80 to $150, depending on region, type of facility and
level of care. One area of savings is in medical supplies. Out of 154
residents, only three wear diapers, down from 53 before Haider took
over. That change amounts to a $6,500 annual savings. "We have teams
and keep the same staff [assignments]," Haider says. "They get to
know the residents and take them to the bathroom when they need it."</TE>
<TE>   In El Sobrante, Calif., Barry Barkan, chief executive of the Live
Oak Living Center and another Pioneer Network founder, developed a
model he calls the "regenerative" nursing home. "What we have done is
to create a culture that's based on the simple belief that those in
long-term care are the elders of our people," he says. "They're
growing, learning, developing, and they deserve respect and honor.
They still have a birthright to joy and pleasure--and they have work
to do, which is to formulate a legacy of their past life experiences
for future generations."</TE>
<TE>   The heart of the Live Oak program is a daily community meeting, a
combination consciousness-raising session, songfest and news
exchange. "It's emotional, it's intellectual, it's spiritual and it
builds connections between people," Barkan says.</TE>
<TE>   One satisfied resident is Verda Mason, 79, who grew up picking
cotton in Monroe, La., and has lived at Live Oak for two years.
"Everyone is so friendly and kind," she says in a phone interview. "I
can't see and I can't walk, but I do enjoy my place here. At the
meetings, I'm the one who gives the song and the scripture."</TE>
<TE>   The community-building effort has another benefit. "It's a very
joyful environment, with an enormous amount of emphasis on
multicultural harmony," Barkan says. The result: low staff
turnover--less than 20% per year.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, annual staff turnover among certified nursing
assistants--nurses' aides who are a nursing home's front-line
caregivers--is more than 100%. Low wages, difficult working
conditions, little respect and no chance for advancement give
caregivers little reason to invest years in their careers. Unless
nursing home managers can staunch the outward flow of their labor
force, residents are unlikely to feel part of a stable, caring
community.</TE>
<TE>   "We know through studies that the happier [care providers] are,
the better the care is," says Sheryl Zimmerman, co-director with
Sloane of North Carolina's Program on Aging, Disability and Long-Term
Care. "The biggest problem has to do with [nursing assistants] not
feeling there's room for growth or being empowered."</TE>
<TE>   At Wellspring Innovation Solutions, an association of 11 nonprofit
nursing homes in Wisconsin, teams of nurses, aides, housekeeping
staff and dietary workers attend off-site training retreats, led by a
geriatric nurse practitioner, to learn best clinical practices for
behavior management, nutrition and other types of patient care.
Managers are taught to be coaches and mentors of staff, rather than
authority figures. Improvements in care are measured and posted for
everyone to see.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, they didn't push education for [aides] or housekeeping
[staff]," says Mary Jo Westphal, certified nursing assistant/care
delivery specialist at Good Shepherd, a Wellspring home. "Nurses
would talk among themselves about a resident and never share
information or clue us in. Now the whole staff learns things." This
open approach has even affected lunch breaks, with staff members
mingling with each other far more, says Westphal.</TE>
<TE>   Robyn Stone, director of the Institute for the Future of Aging
Services at the American Assn. of Homes and Services for the Aging, a
trade group for nonprofit homes, conducted a recent study of the
Wellspring approach and found that by many measures Wellspring homes
outperformed others. Wellspring not only had better staff retention
rates than other homes, its caregivers also used restraints less
frequently, identified bedsores earlier and had better procedures to
help with incontinence. "We found that it did not cost Wellspring
facilities any more" than what it costs traditional facilities to
operate, Stone adds.</TE>
<TE>   The movement toward empowering caregivers and residents is likely
to get a new push from aging baby boomers anxious to make change for
their parents and themselves, say many experts. "They're much
stronger advocates," the Pioneer Network's Fagan says. "They're the
ones saying, 'What do you mean Mom can't watch television in the
middle of the night--or have a glass of wine with dinner?' "</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I'm a 49-year-old female and I'm on my feet six to eight
hours a day on a hard concrete floor. (I work in retail and have been
doing this for the past 15 years.) A month ago I was diagnosed as
having plantar faciitis (heel pain) and I'm now waiting for the
custom-made orthotics that are supposed to help me. Can you tell me
what kind of athletic shoes would be good for me?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Regardless of which brand you choose, there are general
guidelines to follow.</LD>
<LD>   * Try to get fitted for footwear at the end of the day, when your
foot size is at its maximum. It isn't unusual for an individual's
foot to increase half a shoe size during the course of a day.</LD>
<TE>   * Allow half an inch, or the width of your index finger, between
the end of your longest toe and the end of the shoe. If one foot is
larger than the other, buy the larger size.</TE>
<TE>   * Your new shoes should be as wide as possible across the forefoot
without allowing slippage in the heel. If the shoe has variable-width
lacing, experiment with the narrow and wide eyelets to achieve a
custom fit.</TE>
<TE>   * New athletic shoes should not require a breaking-in period.
However, most shoes lose their cushioning after three to six months
of regular use (four days a week) even with orthotics. So, if your
shoes are no longer absorbing the pounding and jarring action of your
sport or the wear and tear of being on your feet all day, then get
new shoes to avoid any other injuries, such as those to your knees
and ankles.</TE>
<TE>   * Consider your foot type--even with orthotics. People with
high-arched feet tend to require greater shock absorption than those
with average feet. High-arched feet also suffer from lateral
instability and are more prone to ankle sprains. Conversely, people
with low-arched, or flat, feet require shoes with less cushioning but
greater support and heel control.</TE>

<LD>   Background: Lifeclinic is backed by Spacelabs Medical, which makes
instruments used to monitor vital signs, among other devices. The
site is meant to help people track and control chronic conditions
such as high blood pressure and diabetes.</LD>
<LD>   What works: Lifeclinic is a do-it-yourself site. On each of
several broad topics--including hypertension, cholesterol,
diabetes--it offers detailed advice about daily diet, medications, as
well as blood tests, how they're done and what they mean. The site
encourages visitors to test themselves, when home tests are
available, and chart daily changes in blood sugar or blood pressure.
Lifeclinic also posts news relevant to these conditions. There is a
commercial dimension to this site: Consumers are encouraged to try
Lifeclinic products, for instance, and to provide detailed personal
information on charts, virtual medical records, and health quizzes.
But the pitches are easy enough to ignore, and the site gives you the
option of blocking "cookies," the coded signatures used to track and
profile visitors.</LD>

<HD>Not Above Popping Pills Meant for Pets</HD>
<DH>Medication* To cut costs or save time, some people take
drugs intended for animals, a risky practice.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Getting a drug prescription to treat a simple infection isn't always
so simple. Drug prices are on the rise; doctor visits can be
time-consuming, expensive; and some 40 million Americans have no
insurance to help pay.</LD>
<LD>   For many, it's easier to get drugs for a pet cat or fish--and take
those pills. Animals are prescribed many of the same medications
humans are, sometimes for the same conditions, and there are plenty
of Internet sites providing advice on drug dosage.</LD>
<LD>   "The use of animal antibiotics without prescription is a major
issue for us," said Dr. Don Klingborg, associate dean of public
programs at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. "This kind of
use can cause adverse events for the people taking them, and also
lead to more antibiotic resistance in the diseases we're trying to
control."</LD>
<TE>   With increasing amounts of prescription drugs moving across the
Mexican border and through Internet pharmacies, a variety of vet
medicines are likely being bought and sold for human use, doctors
say. Some emergency-room doctors say patients occasionally turn up
with veterinary pain medications, sleeping pills and anabolic
steroids, among other products.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen people that go to Mexico for the meds and return with
the vet form instead of the human form," said Dr. James Keany, an
emergency-room physician in Mission Viejo.</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest dangers, he said, is having a severe allergic
reaction to an unknown drug. "I've seen people ... come to the ER
with allergic reactions, usually saying, 'This looks just like when I
took penicillin.' " They were taking penicillin without knowing it,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the biggest loophole in the regulation of veterinary drugs
is the sale of fish antibiotics in pet stores, according to Brandon
Goff, of the Pentagon Clinic in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine earlier this
month, Goff and two other Pentagon doctors reported the case of an
Army Special Forces soldier who had been treating a sinus infection
for three months without a prescription. After some questioning, Goff
said, the middle-age serviceman acknowledged that he'd been buying
the drugs from the fish aisle of a local pet shop.</TE>
<TE>   Goff visited some pet stores and Internet sites that sell pet
supplies and found a wide range of antibiotics available: packages of
penicillin, in 250-milligram tablets; tetracycline, in 250-milligram
capsules or tablets; erythromycin, in 200-milligram tablets. In all,
there were about a dozen antibiotics commonly used by humans sold in
clearly labeled doses.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the same products are available through Internet sites
operated by large pet-product chain stores or discount veterinary
supply outfits.</TE>
<TE>   "This soldier could have come in and seen me any time, but he's a
guy trained to think independently and take care of himself," Goff
said.</TE>
<TE>   When bombarded--but not killed off--by antibiotic drugs, bacteria
eventually evolve defenses against the drugs. The tougher bugs are
difficult to eradicate.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, for example, scientists have detected strains of
the tuberculosis bacterium resistant to nearly every antibiotic
available.</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Underwood, a spokesman for Petco, a large pet-supply chain
based in San Diego, said the company had not heard of customers
buying fish drugs for personal use.</TE>
<TE>   "It's news to us," he said. "I'm sure store managers wouldn't sell
the products if they thought they weren't being used properly."</TE>
<TE>   Other pet-shop owners, though, have noticed a problem. "I quit
selling drugs 10 years ago for that very reason: People would come in
and buy a bunch of medicine and you knew they didn't have a dog,"
said Hervey Chapman, owner of Verdugo Pet Shop in Highland Park.
"They were buying the drug for themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Some animal medications have a following among recreational drugs
users. Dr. Elizabeth Curry-Galvin, of the American Veterinary Medical
Assn. in Schaumburg, Ill., said there have been burglaries of
veterinarians' offices in which the anesthetic ketamine--used most
commonly on animals--was stolen.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes known as "vitamin K," when used in clubs or at parties,
the drug can cause hallucinations and disorientation--a high that
lasts up to two hours, doctors say.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very important anesthetic for animal medicine, but we have
to advise vets to keep as little of it as possible, and put it under
lock and key," Curry-Galvin said.</TE>
<TE>   Veterinarians estimate that some 300 drugs have been approved for
use in companion animals like dogs, cats, and horses. Many of the
compounds contain active ingredients that are identical to those in
human drugs; some are used for the same purpose, but have different
brand names.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-inflammatory etodolac, for example, is prescribed for
osteoarthritis in dogs and humans. The human product is called
Lodine; dogs take EtoGesic.</TE>
<TE>   The drug omeprazole is used to treat gastric problems in both
horses (Gastrogard) and people (Prilosec).</TE>
<TE>   Yet even when it comes to these parallel drugs, there are risks of
taking animal medications, doctors say. The dosages for animals are
different from human doses, the drugs are often made by different
manufacturers, and the production standards may vary.</TE>
<TE>   Fish are in a category all their own. While a vet's order is
needed to buy prescription antibiotics and other drugs for a dog, cat
or horse, the Food and Drug Administration makes an exception for
aquarium use. Generally, these drugs may be sold over the
counter--for a good reason.</TE>
<TE>   "Who's going to bring their goldfish to a vet?" said Judy St.
Leger, a veterinarian in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   The best way to keep fish owners and others from using those
aquarium drugs may be to emphasize the risks, doctors and vets say.</TE>
<TE>   "You simply have a different level of quality assurance when using
a drug made for humans," said St. Leger. "To me, it just seems sad
that there are people who feel they need to treat themselves with a
product made for a fish."</TE>

<LD>My father is an incurably polite man. So it wasn't entirely
surprising that when he went to a doctor for a checkup regarding a
chronic condition, he neglected to mention a new, excruciating pain
that had made it difficult for him to walk or lie down.</LD>
<LD>   The fact that he entered the office on crutches seemed to have
escaped the notice of the doctor, whose specialty, after all, was
blood problems, not bone and nerve problems. The pain--which turned
out to be related to his chronic condition--became so bad my father
ended up spending the next day in the emergency room.</LD>
<LD>   This kind of lack of communication is "a giant issue in health
care," said Stanley Slater, deputy associate director for geriatrics
at the National Institute on Aging, part of the National Institutes
of Health. Pressures from managed care that reduce visits to 15
minutes, the constant turnover in doctors and health plans, and
increased specialization make it hard for doctor and patient alike to
have a conversation that will yield all the information each might
need to exchange.</LD>
<TE>   "You almost have to be like a lobbyist on television," Slater
said. "You have your one sound bite to get your point across."</TE>
<TE>   But the problem is especially acute among older patients, Slater
said, who tend to have more health problems, take more medications
and, like my father, may be from a generation that doesn't feel
comfortable being pushy.</TE>
<TE>   That's why the Institute on Aging came out with a booklet, Talking
With Your Doctor: A Guide for Older People, Slater said. It is full
of good advice for anyone seeing a doctor: "Be honest, stick to the
point, ask questions and share your point of view," the guide says.</TE>
<TE>   But the booklet also has sensible advice targeted to older people.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, in getting ready for an appointment, don't forget
your glasses or hearing aide, the guide says. If you have several
concerns, write them down in order of priority. If you're seeing a
new doctor, write down all your medications, or put all your
prescription and over-the-counter medications, including vitamins and
supplements, into a paper bag and bring them to the doctor.</TE>
<TE>   If you're not sure you will be able to state your concerns
adequately or to remember everything later, take notes or bring
someone with you. The booklet also lays out the questions you might
have about prescriptions, diagnostic tests, surgery or
hospitalization.</TE>
<TE>   And it gives guidance about how to broach subjects such as
sexuality, incontinence, grief and depression, memory problems, care
if there's a serious illness or what to do if you're unhappy with
your doctor.</TE>
<TE>   To get a copy of the booklet, you can call (800) 222-2225. The NIA
also has fact sheets on many age-related issues; check out the Web
site at www.nih.gov/nia.</TE>
<TE>   Some states and municipalities also offer such guidance. The New
York City Department for the Aging, for instance, offers a "Health
Record for Older New Yorkers."</TE>
<TE>   The idea, explained the department's commissioner, Herbert Stupp,
is to give elderly people a handy place to record health information
when they visit the doctor or pharmacist.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps more important, such booklets, if displayed on the
refrigerator, also give emergency medical workers immediate and vital
information about what medical conditions or allergies he or she
might have, medications and insurance information.</TE>
<TE>   Amy Bernstein, director of the health insurance information and
counseling assistance program in the department, worked hard to
design one specific to the needs of New Yorkers.</TE>
<TE>   Most to the point is Page 3, which includes a list of languages
the person might speak. "This is especially important in immigrant
communities," Stupp said.</TE>
<TE>   With the booklet, emergency workers know something about the
person's medical history and can immediately alert the hospital to
have someone on hand to translate if needed.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm absolutely convinced somewhere down the line it will save a
life," Bernstein said.</TE>

<LD>Years ago, it used to be standard practice for hospital nurses to
leave bright lights on all the time in neonatal intensive care units
because it helped the staff better attend to premature infants'
urgent medical needs. Over the years, though, researchers found that
constant light was stressful for preemies, so many NICUs switched to
near-darkness, aiming to mimic the darkness of the womb.</LD>
<LD>   A provocative study published recently in the Journal of
Pediatrics suggests a new approach: cycled light, or normal indoor
lighting during the day and darkness at night, the better to
replicate the day-night rhythms of the real world. Duke University
researcher Debra Brandon monitored 62 babies born at least 10 weeks
prematurely and weighing, on average, 2 pounds. Brandon, an assistant
professor of nursing, randomly assigned the infants to three groups
with different lighting conditions. She found that those exposed
earlier to cycled light grew faster--at least 23 grams more per
week--than those who got cycled light near the end of their hospital
stay.</LD>
<LD>   The Duke study is encouraging to scientists who study circadian
medicine, a fledgling field of research that deals with the role that
natural biological rhythms play in people's health.</LD>
<TE>   Dr. Charles Czeisler, chief of sleep medicine at Brigham and
Women's Hospital in Boston, says Brandon's study is "exciting"
because many hospitals still act as though "circadian rhythms don't
represent a biological need."</TE>
<TE>   "Hospitals aren't organized to take into account the body's time
structure," agrees Michael Smolensky, professor of environmental
physiology at the University of Texas School of Public Health in
Houston. "Studies like this are a wake-up call."</TE>
<TE>   Getting hospitals to respect the basic rhythms of the body is no
easy task. Some patients still say that they are awakened in the wee
hours for CT scans, not because of an emergency, but because that is
when the busy machines are available. It's also routine to wake
patients before dawn to draw blood, not because that's a good time
for them but because it's convenient for doctors to know the results
early in the morning. Moreover, hospitals often try to wean patients
from ventilators in the early morning, just when the biological
rhythms that support respiratory drive are at their lowest.</TE>
<TE>   Things can be even worse in intensive care units, where patients
obviously need the most monitoring--but also need their sleep. Many
hospitals do try to keep ICUs dark at night, says Maureen Harvey, a
nurse who is president of the Society of Critical Care Medicine. Yet
it's at 5 a.m. "that everything happens: Patients get their EKGs,
they get their labs drawn, X-rays, they get weighed, bathed.... It's
ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   Basic Part of Biology</TE>
<TE>   Scientists have known for years that circadian rhythms are a basic
part of biology. Indeed, most creatures on Earth have an internal
"clock" that governs circadian (literally, "about-daily") rhythms.
This suggests that since the early days of evolution, there has been
a clear survival advantage to synchronizing an animal's internal,
chemical life to the light-dark rhythms of the outside world.</TE>
<TE>   "You can live without a 'clock,' " the structure in the brain that
controls circadian rhythms, says Dr. Stephen Reppert, professor of
neurobiology at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center. And
some laboratory animals that have had this part of the brain
destroyed do fine in the lab where food is plentiful and predators
are not. In the wild, however, losing circadian rhythms could be
fatal.</TE>
<TE>   In people, at least those who work during the day and sleep at
night, body temperature fluctuates according to circadian rhythms,
rising in the morning, decreasing at night. Hormonal secretions
follow daily rhythms, too.</TE>
<TE>   Cortisol, a major stress hormone, kicks in dramatically at dawn to
prepare the body for daytime activity and drops in the evening. Other
hormones, such as melatonin and prolactin, kick in during sleep.</TE>
<TE>   Medical conditions also show circadian patterns. Heart attacks and
strokes are most common in the morning, when blood pressure and heart
rate begin to rise. Asthma is often worse at night, when airways tend
to constrict.</TE>
<TE>   In humans and many other animals, the job of keeping the body's
natural rhythms in sync with night and day in the outside world falls
to a small cluster of nerve cells called the suprachiasmatic nucleus,
often called SCN, which lies in a part of the brain called the
hypothalamus. The SCN functions as a master clock that, using
chemical messengers and neural connections to other parts of the
brain, keeps the body in harmony with night and day.</TE>
<TE>   How It All Works</TE>
<TE>   Details have been emerging rapidly in the last five years, and
here's how scientists now think it all works.</TE>
<TE>   When light comes in through the eye and falls on the retina, a
specialized pigment called melanopsin in photoreceptor cells is
activated, says Fred Davis, a biologist at Northeastern University in
Boston. This, in turn, causes nerves to fire, transmitting a signal
to the SCN, which lies just at the point where optic nerves from the
two eyes cross. The SCN then releases a chemical signal (glutamate),
which acts on one or more "clock" genes in the nucleus of SCN cells.</TE>
<TE>   So far, scientists have found at least eight such genes, giving
them names like "clock" and "period." Through a complicated feedback
system, the "period" gene, for instance, turns itself on and off
rhythmically all day, even in the absence of light, Davis notes. But
when it's in an "off" cycle, if light triggers the SCN, the cycle is
speeded up.</TE>
<TE>   Light, in essence, resets the SCN clock so that biological rhythms
are in sync with the light-dark rhythms of the outside world. The
fact that nature has gone to such trouble to keep the body's cells
and organs in sync with day and night strongly suggests that doctors
and hospitals should, too.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, drugs can have different effects at different times
of day and night, notes Smolensky, of the University of Texas. In
studies of rodents and people, for instance, the antibiotic
gentamicin has been shown to have more adverse effects on hearing and
kidney function at night.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, chemotherapy drugs for colon cancer such as
5-FU (fluorouracil) and leucovorin cause fewer side effects if given
during the night. Some blood pressure-lowering drugs have different
effects depending on whether they are taken in the morning or at
night. Some cholesterol-lowering drugs must be taken in the evening
for maximum effect.</TE>
<TE>   Basic sleep-wake cycles can become disturbed, too, when hospital
schedules disrupt circadian rhythms. It's long been known, for
instance, that ICU patients can become confused when they don't get
normal light-dark signals.</TE>
<TE>   Even when it's impossible to put a window in an ICU room, there
are ways to increase patients' awareness of day-night rhythms, says
Donald Axon, an architect in Laguna Niguel who designs ICUs. Some
hospitals, for instance, install special lighting on pictures for
patients' walls so that the light gets brighter during the day and
dimmer at night.</TE>
<TE>   Many routines in hospitals can't easily be changed, especially in
ICUs for adults and preemies, the sickest and most fragile of
patients. But the more patients can be kept on normal day-night
cycles, the better, says Duke University's Brandon. Lighting, she
says, is "the most practical time-of-day cue we can provide."</TE>

<HD>Rethinking Our Daily Bread</HD>
<DH>As obesity and diabetes soar, some U.S. nutritionists and
researchers back off from pushing pasta and rice. The emphasis is on
vegetables and fruits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA KING</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lawrence Elgert thought he had a healthy diet and a healthy
lifestyle. He went to the gym for cardio and weight training workouts
three times a week. Just about every day, he ate what he thought was
a hearty breakfast: oatmeal, to which he would add flaxseed and
barley, and sometimes whole-grain toast as well.</LD>
<LD>   But the 41-year-old was worried about his health, particularly
because his mother has Type 2 diabetes. He had some of the risk
factors for diabetes as well. "I had this potbelly I couldn't get rid
of," said Elgert, of Tucson. "I was puzzled that I couldn't lose the
weight."</LD>
<LD>   About a year ago, following the advice of a nutritional counselor,
Elgert drastically cut back on the grains in his diet and added more
vegetables and fruit. These days his breakfast is likely to be
hard-boiled eggs, stir-fried vegetables and berries. He doesn't eat
bread, though he eats the rice in sushi and an occasional serving of
pasta.</LD>
<TE>   On his new diet, Elgert's potbelly started to recede in a matter
of weeks. He lost 12 pounds effortlessly and muses on the irony that
he had to change his "healthy" diet to feel better: "Isn't it funny?
I wasn't eating Cap'n Crunch. I thought I was doing good."</TE>
<TE>   For more than a decade, health-conscious consumers such as Elgert
have been chowing down on as many low-fat oatmeal pancakes and pieces
of 12-grain bread as they could. They were motivated by a steady
drumbeat of good-news studies that found that whole grains that
include the bran, the germ and the endosperm protect against a number
of diseases and the undeniable fact that valuable nutrients and fiber
disappear when grains are refined.</TE>
<TE>   But a growing number of nutritionists, obesity researchers and
consumers, annoyed by their seemingly intractable extra pounds, are
taking a second look at once sacrosanct whole grains. In this age of
soaring rates of Type 2 diabetes and obesity, says Shari Lieberman, a
nutritionist from Connecticut's University of Bridgeport and author
of "Dare to Lose," "We all need to limit our consumption of
grains--even whole grains."</TE>
<TE>   Susan Bowerman, assistant director of the Center for Human
Nutrition at UCLA, says the backlash against whole grains is yet
another nutritional pendulum swing, this time away from fat-phobic,
whole grain-centric diets that did not solve many of their adherents'
weight problems: "People forgot that fat-free does not mean
calorie-free."</TE>
<TE>   Better Carbohydrates</TE>
<TE>   The move away from whole grains is not a 180-degree turn from the
mantra "the whiter the bread the sooner you're dead." In other words,
no one's recommending that Americans ditch whole-grain bread in favor
of Wonder Bread.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, an increasingly vocal group of nutrition experts is
telling Americans to load up on vegetables and fruits rather than
whole grains because you get more bang for your carbohydrate
calories.</TE>
<TE>   Bowerman, coauthor of the book "What Color Is Your Diet?," which
recommends seven servings of fruits and vegetables a day, says such a
diet delivers--with relatively few calories--phytochemicals that
reduce the risk of a number of diseases, including cancer, diabetes
and heart disease.</TE>
<TE>   It's not just the calories in grains that are a concern. Some
researchers believe that people who have trouble controlling their
weight should eat carbohydrates that fall on the low end of the
glycemic index, a method of calculating how quickly a food can spike
blood sugar.</TE>
<TE>   A diet emphasizing foods that rank high on the glycemic index,
such as many grain-based foods, can lead to high levels of the
"hunger hormone," insulin.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1999 study published in the American Academy of Pediatrics
medical journal Pediatrics, Dr. David Ludwig, an assistant professor
of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and director of the obesity
program at Children's Hospital Boston, found that obese children
downed 81% more calories after high-glycemic meals that contained
instant oatmeal than they did after vegetable omelet and fruit meals
designed to keep blood sugar levels low. The meals contained the same
number of calories. "From a hormonal standpoint, all calories are not
alike," says Ludwig.</TE>
<TE>   Ludwig is one of several critics of the USDA's Food Pyramid, which
is a fixture in schools. Though the U.S. Department of Agriculture
has been recommending a relatively modest three servings of whole
grains a day since 1993, its Food Pyramid recommends a hefty
six-to-11 servings of grains a day and doesn't distinguish between
whole grains and nutritionally inferior refined grains.</TE>
<TE>   Ludwig's alternative, the Low Glycemic Index Pyramid, banishes
high-glycemic, refined grains to the least-often-consumed tip of the
pyramid. Whole grains, whose glycemic index is generally lower than
their refined counterparts because fiber slows their absorption, are
one tier down from the top.</TE>
<TE>   On Ludwig's pyramid, just as on the so-called California Cuisine
Pyramid developed by UCLA, fruits and vegetables are the new
nutritional stars displacing the USDA's six-to-11 servings of grains
in the wide, "eat most frequently" base.</TE>
<TE>   Like UCLA researchers, Ludwig says you can eat lots of
nutrient-rich, fiber-rich vegetables and fruit without blowing your
daily calorie allowance and, he adds, without elevating your blood
sugar excessively. Even carrots, which score high on the glycemic
index for a 1 1/2-pound serving, actually score low when adjusted to
a real-life serving size.</TE>
<TE>   A Natural Limit</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Walter C.Willett, chairman of the nutrition department at the
Harvard School of Public Health, agrees that refined grains should be
eaten sparingly but he does not worry that people will overdo whole
grains. "In some ways grains are self-limiting as they are very
filling and because too many will cause abdominal discomfort and
flatus, and people will naturally cut back," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Grain critics say those intestinal symptoms appear because the
human digestive system has not adapted to lots of grains in the diet.
Only 10,000 years ago, a mere evolutionary blip in the 2.5 million
years that humans have been on Earth, the main sources of
carbohydrates were vegetables and fruits, not grains: "We have had
very little evolutionary experience eating grains," says Loren
Cordain, an anthropological nutritionist at Colorado State University
in Fort Collins and author of "The Paleo Diet."</TE>
<TE>   Some nutritionists fault whole grains on other fronts. For
example, fiber-rich whole grains contain phytate, which inhibits the
absorption of minerals, including zinc, iron and calcium.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Harold Sandstead, a professor at the University of Texas in
Galveston who is a zinc researcher, notes: "There is justification
for concern about recommending diets including large amounts of
unrefined cereals or minimally refined cereals."</TE>
<TE>   But Florida dietitian and coauthor of "Eat to Stay Young" Susan
Mitchell wishes Americans were eating enough whole-grain fiber to
worry about too much phytate. According to a USDA survey, Americans
average only one serving of whole grains a day. "To be blunt," says
Mitchell, "what I find is lots of people who have such a low intake
of fiber that they have tons of hemorrhoids and tons of
constipation."</TE>
<TE>   And although Bowerman does recommend that overweight people cut
back on grains to help reduce their calorie intake, she also
recommends whole grains in moderation because they contain beneficial
fiber and disease-fighting nutrients.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997 the Food and Drug Administration acknowledged the
cholesterol-lowering ability of the soluble fiber from whole oats by
allowing a label that said that they "may reduce the risk of heart
disease." In 1999 the FDA went further, allowing products that
contain at least 51% whole grain to carry a label that says they may
protect against heart disease and some cancers.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA was reacting, says David Jacobs, an epidemiologist at the
University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, to "overwhelming" evidence that
whole grains protect against disease, as do fruits and vegetables.
"Both whole grains and fruits and vegetables are healthy foods. They
should not be in competition with each other."</TE>
<TE>   For most Americans, they're not. While nutritionists and the most
health-conscious consumers debate the relative merits of whole grains
and fresh fruits and vegetables, most Americans stick to widely
denounced highly processed foods. In fact, fresh fruits, vegetables
and whole grains are among those rare foods that even notoriously
overindulgent Americans show no signs of overeating.</TE>

<LD>Someone gave me a copy of the Playboy magazine issue that featured
the naked women of Enron on the same day that three executives of
Adelphia were charged with looting their bankrupt company. I saw a
connection.</LD>
<LD>   Not that the executives were posing in the nude or that the Enron
women had looted their bankrupt company. That had already been taken
care of by others. The connection I made was in terms of excess. The
photographs of the women are way over the top, and so is the greed of
corporate America.</LD>
<LD>   I'm beginning to feel that we're in a state of cultural free fall.</LD>
<TE>   Once upon a time, before Howard Stern and Larry Flynt, we were a
nation of some subtlety, and managed to contain our lust within
certain guidelines. Photographs of women's breasts, for instance,
appeared only in National Geographic, and that was because the women
were considered primitive and not aware that they had breasts.</TE>
<TE>   In America, we were, of course, smarter than anyone else and knew,
tee-hee, that bust lines existed. But their depictions at first were
mostly confined to calendars on the walls of automotive repair shops,
until magazines discovered their marketing value.</TE>
<TE>   Deep thinkers like Hugh Hefner came along, and breasts suddenly
enjoyed a renaissance of exposure. This made a lot of people so much
money that guys like Hustler publisher Flynt figured, hmmm, if boobs
can make a million dollars each, the rest of a woman's erogenous
zones must be worth a fortune. And the crotch was born, so to speak.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings us to other big and dirty business.</TE>
<TE>   I don't know that John Rigas and two of his sons actually did loot
Adelphia of $2.3 billion, but the notion that they might have been
using company money as a personal piggy bank mirrors a system that is
beginning to spin on one word. The word, of course, is greed. And
greed, by its very nature, is lust. And it's littering both Wall
Street and Main Street with its victims.</TE>
<TE>   Corporate executives have raked in millions while watching their
companies dissolve under them, leaving their employees with pennies
by comparison.</TE>
<TE>   A sobering example was an admission by Enron last month that
before collapsing, the company paid out an average of $5.3 million to
each of its 140 senior officers in bonuses and stock grants. The most
collected by each of its 4,200 suddenly jobless employees was less
than $10,000. You can make that much posing for Playboy.</TE>
<TE>   When Global Crossing went down last year, its employees lost about
$250 million in their pension plan because the money had been
invested in Global stock, which melted from a high of $64 a share to
a poverty-level 30 cents. But the company did manage to pay $15
million in lump-sum pension payments to its executives.</TE>
<TE>   And WorldCom's gradual disintegration and ultimate collapse a few
days ago took with it $30 billion that large and small pension funds
had invested in WorldCom bonds that are now almost worthless.</TE>
<TE>   Dot-com communication and power companies, plus a lot of other
American firms, have turned chicanery into a profit business,
rewarding those who are members of an executive club, while throwing
crumbs to the people who put them there.</TE>
<TE>   I will admit to my own share of the excesses mentioned above. I
like looking at photographs of delicately posed, unclothed women. And
I like the idea of making enough money to allow our family luxuries
we might not otherwise possess.</TE>
<TE>   But the photographs I admire and even drool over occasionally are
not those of women in the kind of spread-eagle poses that invite more
mockery than lust. And the money I'm paid, to paraphrase that old
commercial, is made the hard way: I earn it.</TE>
<TE>   Both the photos in Playboy and the antics of those in corporate
America who've been shafting the public are indicative of a society
in trouble. It isn't just today's problem but a legacy we're leaving
our children.</TE>
<TE>   We demand responsibility from our kids, but set no example for
them. We ask for accountability from them while they read and hear
stories of corporate thievery, shredded documents, company executives
hiding behind the 5th Amendment, and blame directed everywhere but
where it belongs. No one takes the rap. No one apologizes.</TE>
<TE>   Sex and money are dominating a society that once functioned on
trust and sharing. Our cravings have translated to public pornography
and corporate larceny, to the extent that Congress is being forced to
at least investigate the larceny.</TE>
<TE>   But we're talking about a political unit whose members and leaders
may be part of the problem. Money talks, but what it demands is
silence from others.</TE>
<TE>   By any measure, night seems to be falling on a long day of excess.
One shudders to think that Lenin could have been right when he
predicted the downfall of America not by military force, but by
internal greed. That's beginning to scare me more now than it ever
has before.</TE>

<HD>A Scent of Cigar, a Sense of Home</HD>
<DH>In a tiny L.A. storefront, Cuban emigre Gilberto Leon's
hand-rolled tobacco and old-fashioned ways kindle nostalgia in a
Florida native</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The elderly man on the telephone chooses his words carefully but
speaks in the rapid-fire, choppy Spanish of my hometown, Miami. When
he notices my accent echoing his over the phone, he excitedly invites
me over: "Ven p'aca." I arrive at Leon's Cigars expecting a cultural
connection. What I find is somewhat arresting.</LD>
<LD>   Scraps of paper with long written sums lie on one counter next to
a small calculator; a portable radio is tuned to a Spanish talk show;
a Cuban pennant hangs on one wall across from a crucifix and family
photographs.</LD>
<LD>   The rich and sweet aroma of tobacco in the front room competes
with the scent of carne con papas (meat and potatoes) cooking on a
portable stove in the back. Dozens of tobacco leaves are piled on
wooden desks, waiting to be cut and filled. Before the day is over in
this tiny cigar shop in Los Angeles, Gilberto Leon and his two
employees will roll 600 to 700 cigars by hand, the way Leon was
taught in his native Cuba. It's been this way at this small shop on
6th Street for 22 years.</LD>
<TE>   Growing up, I heard plenty of nostalgic stories of dapper Cuban
men artistically cutting tobacco leaves with steel blades, though I'd
never actually seen it done. When I arrive, Leon and his sidekick,
Alfonso Machin, are rolling away, a cigar burning on an ashtray near
Leon. For four hours each day he has the rolled tobacco in his mouth,
he says. Ten hours a day, it's in his sturdy hands, embedded in his
fingernails, as he takes a wrapper of tobacco leaf, precisely cuts it
into a triangle, then takes shredded tobacco and flips it into the
wrapper and rolls. Over and over.</TE>
<TE>   I look beyond Leon's kind face to the back of his crammed store,
wedged between a florist shop and a Salvadoran restaurant, and I am
transported. For 17 years, my grandfather Jose Fernandez owned a
neighborhood bodega in Miami, 90 miles from the island where Leon
rolled his first cigar at 14. Small and homey like Leon's store, my
grandfather's bodega--our bodega--supported my grandparents and
anyone else in our large family who needed it. It is where my sister
and I were sometimes dropped off after school, and where we hung out
on weekends, eating candies. It is also where my family learned to be
at home in its new country.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody rolled cigars in our little market, but people sure smoked
them. The neighborhood men all gathered there after work, cigars in
one hand, cafecitos in the other, reminiscing about old times and
dissecting the latest travesty of the Fidel Castro regime. Boisterous
and well-informed, these men gathered around a wooden counter, just
like Leon's. The radio was always dialed to Spanish talk, especially
of the political variety, and mementos of Cuba hung on the wall. Like
the owner of this cigar shop, my grandfather was the quiet one who
did most of the listening. At Leon Cigars, Machin, 73, is the noisy
one with the naughty sense of humor.</TE>
<TE>   When Leon proudly shows me the paper with his handwritten
calculations of the day's sales (nearly $2,000), I see something
else: the same type of discarded cigarette cartons my grandfather
used for his tabulations because he didn't want to be wasteful. The
long row of figures, the lines and curves of the digits themselves,
make me homesick. "Are you hungry?" Leon asks sweetly. "I am cooking
today. I wanted to eat home-cooked food, and the old lady at home
cannot cook at all."</TE>
<TE>   We go into the back, where the carne con papas  is almost ready
and another Cuban staple sits on the other burner: the silver
coffeepot for Cuban espresso. I am reminded of so many afternoons
when my sister and I walked in on my grandfather cooking caldo
gallego (a Spanish stew) or arroz con pollo (chicken with rice). He
died in 1998, two months shy of his 95th birthday. But on this summer
afternoon in the City of Angels, it is as if he is right here with
me.</TE>
<TE>   'The Best Cigar in L.A.'</TE>
<TE>   Gilberto Leon has always lived simply, devoted to his work and
family. A widower whose grown son now lives in Miami with his family,
Leon shares the small house he owns in Silver Lake with a "lady
friend." He works Monday through Saturday, arriving before 6 a.m. and
staying until 4:30 or later if his customers need him. On Sundays he
works a few hours in the early morning, preparing the cigar wrappers
for the coming week. His assistants are two of his closest friends:
Machin, a Cuban exile who almost died in the Florida Strait during
the 1980 Mariel boat lift; and Elda Lopez, a Nicaraguan woman who
rolls cigars at a desk in the back, away from Machin's banter.</TE>
<TE>   "My vices are eating, smoking tobacco, drinking a little beer here
and there," Leon says. He also loves to play dominoes with his
sister, who carries them in her car wherever she goes. "She likes the
dominoes like I like cigars."</TE>
<TE>   Leon learned to roll "the best cigar in Los Angeles," as his
customers are apt to say, by default. The family was poor. He needed
to learn a trade. His mother had a connection, and off he went at 14.
By the time he grew up, Leon had worked at all of the largest cigar
factories in La Habana, striving to learn from the best and perfect
his craft.</TE>
<TE>   "I liked it," he said. "We were poor, and you had to learn how to
do something, and that's what I learned. But you know how the Cuban
spirit is. We always want to do better."</TE>
<TE>   When the Castro revolution began in 1959, Leon sold his cigar shop
before the government could seize it, as it did the personal and
business properties of nearly everyone on the island, including my
grandfather, who owned a bar and restaurant in La Habana called Las
Carolinas. Leon returned to rolling cigars in the factories as the
revolution unfolded and the life he had built slowly crumbled.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a business owner until Fidel arrived and knocked me off my
horse," he said. "I went to an agricultural camp to cut sugar cane
for free for five years. That's how I earned the right to leave. I
had to give up five years of my life for my exit visa. It was like
being in prison."</TE>
<TE>   In 1971, Leon landed in Miami without his wife, who did not want
to leave her family, and their 9-year-old son. He stayed in South
Florida for only five days, then came to Los Angeles, where two of
his sisters were waiting for him. He immediately hit the cigar
factories to make a living. "I missed Cuba and my people, but I
adjusted. I got used to things here. I have enjoyed living in Los
Angeles very much."</TE>
<TE>   Nine years later, Leon found his storefront just west of Western
Avenue, where Angelenos from all walks of life intersect and coexist.
Leon keeps a machete next to his desk, but he's never had to use it.
In 22 years there have been no break-ins or robberies. No problems.
Leon says it's because "if you don't start trouble, you don't get
into trouble." I heard my grandfather say the same thing a time or
two.</TE>
<TE>   A Distinguished Clientele</TE>
<TE>   Today Leon's cigars cost between $3 and $5.50, and he sells about
400 or 500 a day. During the cigar fad of the mid-'90s, customers
lined up around the block seeking Leon's special blends of tobacco.
Cigar smoking may not be as trendy these days, but Leon still has a
loyal roster of clients: former boxing champion George Foreman, whom
Leon did not even recognize, movie studio executives, lawyers,
businessmen and police officers.</TE>
<TE>   This is why.</TE>
<TE>   It's Friday afternoon, and the after-work rush is at its peak.
Machin and Lopez have left for the day, and Leon is sweeping tobacco
trimmings off the floor. Two polished men in suits walk in, and one
says loudly, "Leon! My man!" They stand in front of the counter, and
nobody says another word. Leon looks at them, puts the broom away,
walks into his humidor and grabs four bundles.</TE>
<TE>   Chuck Smith, president and chief executive of Pacific Bell, has
been coming to Leon Cigars for 12 years, even though he lives in San
Francisco. Smith, who was introduced to the shop by friends in the
neighborhood, makes sure to stop by every time he's in L.A. Today he
is spending $400; one of the bundles will be a gift.</TE>
<TE>   "These cigars have seen my daughter graduate from high school and
my son get his PhD," says Smith. "Did you notice I didn't tell him
what to get? He just knows. Even though I can't speak Spanish, we
communicate. He's a special man. I've recommended this place to about
100 people."</TE>
<TE>   Because the U.S. trade embargo prevents Leon from buying tobacco
from Cuba--"the best"--he purchases tobacco grown from Cuban seed in
the Dominican Republic, Ecuador and Honduras. After it is harvested,
it is imported to Miami and shipped to Los Angeles. Each type of
tobacco has its own flavor and aroma. Five different blends create
the 10 types of cigars he sells. The ones in dark wrappers are
bitter; the others are smooth.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a good cigar maker," says Norman Asher, of Scottsdale,
Ariz., who walks into the shop with his son, Alan, of Los Angeles.
"If he stays at it long enough, he's going to be really good," he
jokes.</TE>
<TE>   The elder Asher has been smoking cigars for 50 years. When he is
in Arizona, his son mails him shipments from Leon's because nowhere,
not even in his native Chicago, has Asher found better-tasting
tobacco. "The flavor is outstanding. Even when it was tough to buy
them, when I had to stand in line, I was here. I didn't have to say
anything. He just knows."</TE>
<TE>   Leon doesn't stress over the fact that he still speaks very little
English and most of his clientele speaks no Spanish. He is good at
reading people, and his customers have let him off the hook. "They
tell me, 'No worry. Forget English. Cigars very good,' " he says in a
broken English.</TE>
<TE>   Easygoing and mild-mannered, Leon says he's just a survivor. He
lived through troubled times in Cuba, lost his business and marriage
to Castro's revolution, then lost his second love in 1987 when she
died. But he is serene.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got no qualms about dying," he says. "After Fidel dies, I'm
going back to Cuba because I want to die there. But tell Uncle Sam to
send me my checks because I'm an American citizen and I've got money
coming to me."</TE>
<TE>   He laughs and adds, "California has been good to me, but I never
forget my homeland. Never."</TE>
<TE>   My grandfather shared Leon's dream of being buried in Cuba. But
destiny had a different plan, and Miami became his final resting
place. And now, 3,000 miles away from the cemetery where my
grandparents are buried together, a small cigar shop in the heart of
Los Angeles gives me a sense of home.</TE>

<DH>A project of photography and writing brings youths new
insights. The Huntington is displaying their work.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Peering through the lens of a $13 camera, Gloria Soto looked for
beauty in her Lincoln Heights neighborhood. Her teacher had taught
her there was aesthetic value in everything: the rundown Nightingale
Bridge, the clashing, bright colors of graffiti on walls, and the
simplicity of a friend's smile. It was refreshing to see beyond the
harshness of the inner city to hear this stranger describe those
streets in an uplifting, artistic way.</LD>
<LD>   But the 13-year-old Lincoln High School freshman was surprised by
what she saw when she focused the lens on herself. Years of believing
she was nobody special, that she'd never amount to anything,
disappeared in a flash.</LD>
<LD>   Gloria's teacher is Gail Brown, a documentary photographer--or a
"philosopher-photographer," Brown says--who leads a 5-year-old
program at the Los Angeles Boys &amp; Girls Club in Lincoln Heights in
which children, ages 9 to 17, document their lives through
black-and-white pictures paired with personal writings. The students
receive cameras, learn to load film, take pictures and develop them,
and then express their feelings about the images with words. At the
end of the project, "From Where I'm Standing," the students create
books of their work.</LD>
<TE>   For the first time, the finished books will be on display at the
Huntington Library in San Marino. The exhibit, which opened Saturday
and closes Aug. 10, is the first display of children's work featured
at the Huntington and is a way for young artists to connect with the
rest of Los Angeles and be exposed to people and areas they don't
usually encounter, Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time we can give kids an artistic outlet, it's a positive
[change] and a feeling of control in some ways," said June Aiello,
executive director of the Boys &amp; Girls Club. "It gives them a sense
that their environment isn't just happening to them, that they're
capturing it and making a statement about it. What people usually
don't understand about these kids is that they're very insightful.
They have to take a look inside because what they see outside is so
bad."</TE>
<TE>   As the students explored their external worlds, looking for ways
to express themselves, what changed most remarkably was their
perception of themselves. These child artists stand taller.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was little, my family treated me great," says Gloria,
sitting in a classroom at the Boys &amp; Girls Club. "But when I went to
school, I started hanging out with the wrong people and I started to
think I just wasn't that bright. I used to have a really low
self-esteem. But my teacher inspired me and told me I can do it, and
now I realize that I'm not as dumb as I always thought I was."</TE>
<TE>   The photographs and writings poignantly capture the contradictions
and turmoil the children face in their lives. Brown, who has been
working with children in Los Angeles since 1992, said she chose to
document East Los Angeles when she realized that being aware of the
issues facing her students was not enough. She needed to "get inside
their heads" to truly understand them and nurture them.</TE>
<TE>   "You walk down the streets here and it's packed with billboards
and things that keep telling you that you won't amount to anything,
that this is broken, that is broken," said Brown, 43. "It's nothing
like the Huntington where everything is green and manicured and
perfect. These kids may all have similar pressures, but it affects
each one differently and you can see it in the work they produce."</TE>
<TE>   For Carmen Morales, 12, a simple photograph of the Nightingale
Bridge she frequently crosses assumes a somber reality in the line
she penned about it: "Each day that goes by is like walking across a
bridge. With one mistake you fall into the waters of deception."</TE>
<TE>   One of Maria Gamez's photographs sparks her young imagination; the
9-year-old fourth-grader at Arroyo Seco Museum of Science Magnet
School looks at the butterflies floating around a tree and wonders
what it would be like for people to fly.</TE>
<TE>   In her paragraph about another picture, where she catches boys
playing cops and robbers, she's not as fanciful: "Imagine him in the
picture fighting in my school, everybody screaming and trying to find
the bad guy and going to kill him for good."</TE>
<TE>   "The idea is for the kids to show us how they view the outside and
see their surroundings in the pictures, but to show us how they feel
inside in the writings," Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the program, the students took four field trips to the
Huntington, where they toured art galleries, visited the photography
archives in the library, took a garden workshop, and photographed the
gardens, said Kitty Connolly, a botanical education specialist at the
Huntington.</TE>
<TE>   The gardens, especially the waterfalls, inspired Maria's sister,
Lluvia Gamez, 13, to write: "Nature tells all. It has no make-up and
can't tell no lies. Nature cannot pose."</TE>
<TE>   "When Gail showed us some of the work the children had done, we
got very excited about helping them in some way," Connolly said. "I
find it very moving, the pictures and the writing. It made me realize
my childhood was boring but safe. Their lives are a lot more complex
than mine ever was."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Lincoln High School senior Ernesto Barba says the class
serves as therapy for him, a way of letting go of his anger and
frustrations. He snapped a photograph of two little girls behind a
fence, looking out at the street. Neither one of them is smiling, but
both are wide eyed and alert. Ernesto, 17, said he was struck by the
girls because, "being from Lincoln Heights, they're the types of kids
who have to mature before they should have to because of all the
things they face: the potheads, the guys selling it on the corners,
the drive-bys."</TE>
<TE>   In his snapshot of a man walking to the subway, Juan Del Angel,
17, identified his own loneliness. "Alone, alone, why must I have
been born alone, with nobody by my side, nobody to love me, nobody to
keep me up when I'm down?"</TE>
<TE>   A senior at Lincoln High School, Juan has divorced parents and he
and his siblings live in separate homes. When he walked into Brown's
class, Juan was taken aback by the camaraderie among his peers. "They
were all talking with each other and I was the quiet one," he said.
"I don't trust anyone. But now I'm more open-minded and more open to
the life ahead of me. The way Gail teaches, I trust people a little
bit now."</TE>
<TE>   Like Gloria, Jorge Marron, 16, has discovered himself through his
viewfinder. "I can search deep down and find my true feelings," said
the 11th-grader at Franklin High. "I couldn't do that on a regular
day when you're just playing around and not thinking much. Here,
everything is silent and Gail makes you think. It's helped me realize
what's out there in the world and appreciate things more. Gail could
make you appreciate anything she puts in front of you."</TE>

<LD>   Have you ever had a friend who lived in a different country? How
did you get to know someone from so far away? In 1927, children from
Japan and the U.S. learned more about each other by exchanging dolls
and writing letters. The children became friends at a time when it
was difficult for adults in their countries to get along.</LD>
<LD>   In honor of the 75th anniversary of this doll exchange and to
continue the spirit of friendship, the Japanese American National
Museum is sending new American dolls to children in Japan. And
children in Japan recently lent their dolls to the museum for the
exhibition "Passports to Friendship: Celebrating 75 Years of
U.S.-Japan Friendship Doll Exchange."</LD>
<TE>   You can visit the museum through Oct. 13 and meet these new doll
ambassadors, and see 12 of the surviving American and Japanese dolls
from 1927. You can also write letters to Japanese children in a
special activity that's part of the exhibition.</TE>
<TE>   You might want to tell them something about yourself and American
culture, like your language, holidays, foods and school experiences.
And don't forget to pick up a "Passport to Friendship," which you can
fill in as you walk through the exhibition.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition is free to museum members and children 5 and
younger, or with general admission. For more information, call (213)
625-0414 or visit www.janm.org.</TE>

Japanese American National Museum, located in the Little Tokyo
district of downtown Los Angeles, 369 E. 1st Street.</TE>

<TE>   "Arthur and the Goalie Ghost"</TE>
<TE>   by Marc Brown</TE>
<TE>   Arthur's friend, Buster, is the goalie for the new Elwood hockey
team. Buster is scared, but the ghost of his favorite goalie, Jacques
Nettoyer, is trying to help him. Buster thinks that if he eats like
Jacques then he will act like him. But Buster's coach tells him that
he should just play the way he can. Buster learns to anticipate where
the puck is going and becomes a good goalie. I recommend this book to
young goalies because it teaches them how to play their position.</TE>

<LD>Nobody we spoke with would admit it, but we're pretty sure that
miniature books are made from chopped-down bonsai trees. If so, the
world's dwarf forests are in danger of being wiped out because
itty-bitty books have become a big business.</LD>
<LD>   Running Press, which launched the Lilliputian literature craze 13
years ago, has published almost 40 million of the tiny tomes, and
competitors have cranked out millions more--on such burning topics as
poodles, margaritas, vampires, tornadoes, Leonardo DiCaprio,
Portuguese sonnets and the wisdom of Nancy Drew ("Don't force your
date to go to a ballet or another activity that may not be to his
liking if he was knocked unconscious earlier in the day").</LD>
<LD>   Although modeled after the midget books of past centuries, today's
shrunken volumes are more a novelty item than serious literary form.
Basically, they're just glorified greeting cards, says Evelyn
Beilenson of Peter Pauper Press, which joined the micro-book
bandwagon in 1991. "If there's too much text in the books, they don't
sell," she says. "Aphorisms do better."</LD>
<TE>   Some come with trinkets, such as tiny voodoo dolls, wind chimes,
fondue pots or Slinkys. Stationed near cash registers as an impulse
buy, the books are sold in coffeehouses, liquor stores, florists and
even carwash shops, as well as traditional bookstores. Barnes &amp; Noble
keeps a separate bestseller list for the category.</TE>
<TE>   Miniature books have a storied past. During World War I, Lawrence
of Arabia gave lockets containing inch-high Korans and magnifying
glasses to the Muslim soldiers who fought alongside him, says Anne
Bromer, whose Boston bookshop specializes in antique miniature
volumes.</TE>
<TE>   In 1969, NASA sent a mini-book to the moon aboard Apollo 11. More
recently, a Ukrainian artist constructed a microscopic volume of
poetry bound with a spider web and small enough to slip through the
eye of a needle.</TE>
<TE>   Mini-books date back to Gutenberg. "At first, they were made to
test the skills of apprentice printers, who had to set the tiny type
on very small pages," Bromer says.</TE>
<TE>   But their minuscule size also made them popular with travelers.
The earliest titles were Bibles and other religious works. But by the
17th and 18th centuries, the list of topics ranged from hunting
guides and almanacs to poetry and lovemaking, according to Bookman's
Weekly magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Napoleon carried a portable library of the books into battle, says
Msgr. Francis J. Weber, chief archivist for the Archdiocese of Los
Angeles and an authority on miniature bookdom. Over the years, Weber
has collected some 3,600 tiny volumes (which he donated to the
Huntington Library a few years ago) and has written 104.</TE>
<TE>   Among collectors, antique miniatures can fetch up to $40,000.
Modern miniatures are also highly prized--if they're painstakingly
crafted by hand. According to the Miniature Book Society, the volumes
must be no more than 3 inches tall, wide or thick (except in foreign
nations, where 4 inches is the limit). By that yardstick, today's
mass-produced editions, which sell for $5 to $6 and are usually
slightly larger, don't qualify.</TE>
<TE>   "They're junk," sniffs Weber.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, but they're popular junk. Running Press' top title, "The
Quotable Woman," has sold more than a million copies. Other hot
topics include celebrity bios, surfer wisdom, pop-up children's
books, Thomas Kinkade artwork, Barbie, pets, inspirational titles ("A
Little Sip of Chicken Soup for the Soul"), dieting and a miniature
"Dating for Dummies."</TE>
<TE>   Regarding the "Dummies" edition, a Running Press executive once
told Entertainment Weekly: "You can take our 'Dating for Dummies'
mini, slip it into your pocket and refer to it while you're on your
date. It's almost like having a breath mint."</TE>
<TE>   The latest fad is the mini-kit, a book that includes some sort of
gadget, such as a Tom Thumb-size Zen garden or a tiny waterfall that
operates by hand pump. "There's been an upsurge [in sales] of
mini-kits," says Jenie Carlen, a spokeswoman for Borders Books.
"We've increased our inventory of the kits while maintaining or
decreasing the others."</TE>
<TE>   Publishers are competing to find new gimmicks. This fall,
Andrews-McMeel Publishing will release mini-books with stereoscopic
covers and sound chips (a book on kissing makes a smooching sound; a
cookbook says "Delicious" when a button is pressed). Andrews-McMeel
also has a volume about friendship that includes a pint-sized blank
CD on which to burn a message or song for the recipient. Peter
Pauper, which already attaches charms to most of its books, plans to
add an incense burner to its hot-selling feng shui volume and a tiny
Native American dream-catcher to its book on that subject.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Running Press just launched specialfavors.com, a Web
site that lets people order customized dust jackets for mini-books
that are handed out as keepsakes at weddings and showers. The books
cover such topics as wedding toasts, love and step-by-step
instructions for ballroom dances. The cost: $5.95 each, with a
minimum order of 20 books.</TE>
<TE>   "All of us are always trying new things," says Peter Pauper's
Beilenson. "You have to."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone appreciates the effort. After examining hundreds of
miniature titles, a Baltimore Sun critic concluded that "good things
don't come in small packages. Stupid, banal, boring, unnecessary
books come in small packages."</TE>
<TE>   In a last-ditch effort to find some redeeming value to the format,
the writer tried using a mini-book as a coaster for a margarita. But
even that bombed, she wrote: "It was too small."</TE>

<HD>Reading? Somebody May Be Watching</HD>
<DH>Librarians and booksellers want to know just how far the
FBI has gone in its effort to root out terrorists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J. MICHAEL KENNEDY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even as Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft fielded congressional criticisms
last week over the Justice Department's wide-ranging anti-terrorism
tactics, some librarians and booksellers have concerns of their own.</LD>
<LD>   They are awaiting a detailed accounting, now being compiled by the
Justice Department, that will reveal, among other things, just how
many times federal investigators have secretly monitored the
bookstore purchases and library checkouts of Americans in their
search for terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   That accounting, ordered in June by the House Judiciary Committee,
covers a wide range of surveillance issues, but Judith Krug, the
outspoken director of the office for intellectual freedom for the
American Library Assn., will be paying particular attention to how
question No. 12 is answered. That one asks the FBI to enumerate how
many times the federal law enforcement agency has used its new powers
to secretly search the once-confidential records of public libraries
and bookstores.</LD>
<TE>   She, for one, thinks such searches are a waste of time and an
infringement on privacy. But the FBI's answer could shed light on
whether the nation's readers are being monitored more closely than at
any other time in the nation's history.</TE>
<TE>   Looking for Clues</TE>
<TE>   Since Congress passed sweeping anti-terrorist laws in the
emotional aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, the FBI has had carte
blanche to secretly examine the reading habits of almost anyone,
looking for clues that might uncover someone involved in terrorism, a
book about the World Trade Center, say, or a book on Islamic
terrorism. The court that grants the search warrants meets in secret.
The warrants themselves need not mention any suspicion of terrorism.
Those ordered to turn over information are prohibited from revealing
to anyone, including the person being investigated, that the FBI paid
a visit.</TE>
<TE>   "This has a terrible chilling effect," said Leigh Estabrook,
director of the Library Research Center at the University of
Illinois. "I think it's a terrible thing."</TE>
<TE>   The legislation authorizing such investigative activity is
contained in the 342-page USA Patriot Act , which was passed by
Congress in October. The judiciary committee, as part of its
oversight duties, has asked Ashcroft 50 detailed questions, including
the one about libraries and bookstores. Other questions address
issues such as secret searches and the monitoring of telephone calls
and Internet connections.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that Congress is asking the FBI to detail its activity in
the reading-habits category has been greeted with relief by a number
of civil liberties groups, including the American Booksellers
Foundation for Free Expression.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of the problem is that there is no way to monitor the number
of orders being issued so there's no way to monitor any abuse," said
Chris Finan, the foundation's president. "That's why we're glad to
see the letter."</TE>
<TE>   However, it has taken time for word to filter out that such a law
is even on the books. In a recent poll conducted by the University of
Illinois library research center, more than a third of the 1,020
librarians polled were unaware of the new law. In the same poll, 85
librarians, most of them from large research institutions, said they
had been contacted by federal or local law enforcement officials for
information about patrons.</TE>
<TE>   Estabrook, the director of the center, said that by responding to
the questionnaire, the librarians may have inadvertently violated the
law. In that vein, she said, it is possible many more librarians have
been contacted by law enforcement, but did not reveal that because of
the restrictions of the law. "My suspicion is that librarians have
been quite cautious about saying anything," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Krug, of the American Library Assn., said it is already standard
policy for most public libraries to dispose of records once a book
has been returned. She said it's been that way for a number of years
and it is done to protect readers' privacy. She also said she
believed combing library records was a waste of time and tax dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "If the FBI is using its manpower in this way, they probably
should be horsewhipped," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Lawsuits Over Searches</TE>
<TE>   The searching of bookstore records by law enforcement officials
has been the subject of a number of lawsuits over the last several
years. The most prominent of them involved Denver's Tattered Cover
Bookstore, whose owner refused to hand over sales records as part of
a police investigation into a small-time drug operation.</TE>
<TE>   The store's owner, Joyce Meskis, took the case all the way to the
Colorado Supreme Court, where she prevailed in her argument that
bookstores do not have to turn over sales records to law enforcement
officials. Ironically, she won the Colorado case after the USA
Patriot Act was already in effect.</TE>
<TE>   Meskis said she knew about the search provision in the act but had
not been affected by it thus far. She said the thing that worried her
most was the amount of secrecy given to federal investigators.</TE>
<TE>   "That element could be the biggest flag of all about how our
government operates," said Meskis. "Being able to have access to
what's going on in government is important to our system. I can't
wait to see the responses [from the FBI]. I think it's critically
important that we hear from the attorney general about what's going
on."</TE>
<TE>   Library Patrons Worried</TE>
<TE>   City librarian Susan Kent said she knew of no library under her
authority that had been affected by the law. But she also said recent
reports about the case had prompted calls from worried library
patrons. "They were very concerned about their privacy rights," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), the chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee, said he planned to make Ashcroft's responses
public soon after they are turned over. But more than two weeks after
the answers were supposed to be turned in, the judiciary committee is
still waiting. The attorney general's office, meanwhile, said it is
devoting hundreds of man hours to compiling the requested records.</TE>
<TE>   Sensenbrenner said he believed the USA Patriot Act was a balanced
effort to work against terrorism so long as the granted authority is
used correctly. But he also said his committee is entitled to more
than just generalizations about how federal authorities are
conducting their investigative business.</TE>
<TE>   "The devil," he said, "is in the details."</TE>

<LD>"This is a totally boring summer," Jason grumbled.</LD>
<LD>   It was so hot the sidewalk sizzled and there was not a breath of
wind to blow the smog away. Worst of all, his best friend, Pete, was
away at camp for three weeks.</LD>
<LD>   "Rats," Jason said. "Nothin's any fun without Pete."</LD>
<TE>   He started whacking rocks around the yard with his hockey stick.
One sailed through the air and landed in the vegetable garden. It
knocked a ripe tomato right off the vine. Splat!</TE>
<TE>   "Bull's-eye," Jason chortled.</TE>
<TE>   The next rock sailed into the trunk of the big oak tree that grew
between his house and Mrs. Crabb's house next door. It made such a
wonderful thwacking sound, he decided to do it again.</TE>
<TE>   "This one's for you, Pete," he muttered as he tossed a rock into
the air and swung hard.</TE>
<TE>   He connected ... but his aim was just a tad off.</TE>
<TE>   He watched his rock whiz past the tree. He saw it bounce off Mrs.

<TE>   From inside the house there was a screech and the sound of

<TE>   Mrs. Crabb popped out on the porch. She was wearing her usual

<HD>Divorce Could Result in Scarring</HD>

<LD>Note to Angelina Jolie: A diamond is forever, sweetie, not a
marriage.</LD>
<LD>   Recent news that Jolie and her husband, serial groom Billy Bob
Thornton (who has been married five times), are headed for
splitsville brought up the question of her tattoo. We're talking
about the giant "Billy Bob" over a hissing dragon that takes up
visible and important acreage on the Academy Award winner's left arm.
What will she do with the tattoo if the couple does in fact divorce?</LD>
<LD>   "I'm angry. I'm sad. It's a very difficult and sad time," Jolie
was quoted as telling Us Weekly, which hit the stands just before her
divorce papers did on July 18. "It was a real deep connection, a deep
marriage, so it's not that simple to say this or that one thing
caused the problems. It's clear to me that our priorities shifted
overnight."</LD>
<TE>   Jolie might be angrier and sadder if and when she begins
researching tattoo-removal options. Unlike Johnny Depp's tattoo (when
the actor broke off his engagement to Winona Ryder, he had his arm
tattoo altered from "Winona Forever" to "Wino Forever"), altering the
words "Billy Bob" won't be easy. If she's a J.R.R. Tolkien fan, she
could pay a somewhat distorted tribute to hobbits by making it read
Bil Bo. Perhaps it's best if she just gets rid of it altogether. Here
are Jolie's options:</TE>
<TE>   * Lasers: Lasers have become the standard treatment for tattoo
removal. The removal is accomplished by lasers that vaporize the
pigment colors with high-intensity light beams. The ink particles are
broken up into tiny fragments that are absorbed through the body's
natural cleansing mechanism. Black tattoos are the easiest to remove
because black pigment absorbs all laser wavelengths. Other colors,
such as green, selectively absorb laser light. One or more treatments
might be needed, depending on the size, number and depth of the
tattoos.</TE>
<TE>   * Dermabrasion and chemical peel: A small portion of the tattoo is
sprayed with a solution that freezes the area. The tattoo is then
"sanded" with a rotary abrasive instrument, causing the skin to peel.
Bleeding is likely to result. Scarring might occur. Chemical peels, a
popular procedure for removing wrinkles, also might work on some
tattoos. The process involves the application of a chemical solution
that removes the top layers of skin.</TE>
<TE>   * Excision: This is the most invasive procedure but is an option
for the removal of a small tattoo. Excision is just that. The tattoo
is removed surgically, and the edges of the skin are then brought
together and sutured. The advantage of this method is that the entire
tattoo can be removed. In some cases involving large tattoos, a skin
graft taken from another part of the body might be necessary.
Scarring might occur.</TE>
<TE>   If this all sounds a tad too grisly, don't worry a bit for our
"Girl, Interrupted," who doesn't flinch at plasma. Now about those
blood-filled pendants....</TE>

<HD>Ill-Informed Bill to Counter Ecstasy Use in Clubs Is
Nothing to Rave About</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM D. McCOLL</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly 20 years ago I had an experience at a very large event that
truly scared me. I watched a friend, clearly under the influence of a
drug, pitch headfirst into a wall. Fortunately there was water and an
ambulance on the scene. He spent the night in the infirmary and
returned to us, chastened.</LD>
<LD>   I was reminded of that incident because a rapidly moving bill in
the U.S. Senate may force nightclub owners and promoters to eliminate
having water or ambulances available in case of trouble. Senators on
the Judiciary Committee, famed for their ability to bottle up
judicial nominees for years, introduced the Reducing Americans'
Vulnerability to Ecstasy (RAVE) Act and got it on the legislative
calendar in less than a month.</LD>
<LD>   This is troubling because there has been no public input, not even
a hearing.</LD>
<TE>   Sadly, the acronym alone makes the bill almost impossible to
oppose. That's a shame because this bill sorely begs scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   In essence, the legislation would change the mid-1980s' "crack
house" law to allow prosecution of rave promoters and owners of
property on which drugs, including marijuana, may be used. This is a
novel use of the law, which targets landlords who allow housing to be
used for drug transactions that create long-term community problems.</TE>
<TE>   The bill appears to be an ill- informed response to a failed
prosecution of two New Orleans rave promoters in 2000. The promoters
ultimately agreed to ban items that the Drug Enforcement Agency
termed "drug paraphernalia"--pacifiers, glow sticks and bottled
water--from future events. Fortunately, the ban was overturned on
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Also in 2000, New York City shut down a nightclub, citing the
presence of ambulances as evidence that the owners "knew" that drug
use was occurring on the property.</TE>
<TE>   Had there been a public hearing, the Senate would know the bill is
too broad. It allows prosecution of people who "knowingly open,
lease, rent, use or maintain a place for the purpose of
manufacturing, distributing or using a controlled substance." Sounds
fine except that "knowingly" and "for the purpose of" are too
unspecific to provide adequate protection to innocent businesspeople.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, the bill allows prosecutors to charge owners
civilly, lowering the standard of proof for conviction. Thus, despite
good security, an owner could be fined hundreds of thousands of
dollars.</TE>
<TE>   It's not just businesspeople who are in jeopardy. The bill would
make it a federal crime to temporarily use a place for the purpose of
using marijuana or other drugs. Thus, homeowners who use drugs in
their own home or throw a party at which a guest uses drugs could
face fines and up to 20 years in prison. In states that allow the use
of marijuana for medicinal purposes, this bill would make it a
federal crime to rent property to medical marijuana patients and
their caregivers.</TE>
<TE>   Because the bill would push licensed owners out of hosting musical
events, raves and other musical events would go further underground
and away from emergency care and hospitals. Moreover, by insinuating
that selling bottled water, offering air-conditioned "cool off" rooms
and having ambulances present is proof that owners and promoters know
that drug use is occurring at their events, the bill may make
business owners too afraid to implement safety measures.</TE>
<TE>   As for the incident with my friend, well, the event was a
University of Michigan football game and the drug was alcohol. He
went face down while attempting a high-five. We were glad to have
that water, and we were glad that Michigan had an ambulance crew
waiting.</TE>
<TE>   The unintended consequences of this bill would be severe. Senators
should delay and fix the legislation or vote it down.</TE>

<HD>Grim Reaping</HD>
<DH>The industrialization of agriculture is killing the land</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEORGE B. PYLE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even when city folks notice the dwindling population of rural areas
and express concern for the dying small communities scattered across
the continent, they remain blind to the real causes and the best
solutions. They are blind because they have bought the lie that the
industrialization of food production is both inevitable and good and
that the only problem is finding new uses for the surplus rural
population.</LD>
<LD>   The health of rural communities cannot be considered apart from
the health of the land that once supported them and still, for the
moment, feeds the rest of us.</LD>
<LD>   That land is being laid waste just as surely as are the small
towns that used to thrive on the business of farming. Yet the fields
cannot speak up, and so their victimization goes mostly unnoticed.</LD>
<TE>   For one thing, the fields are much lighter than they used to be.</TE>
<TE>   The latest federal figures available, from 1997, indicate that
each year wind and water erosion alone carries away 2 billion tons of
soil, or 5.6 tons per cultivated acre.</TE>
<TE>   For every ton of grain and hay harvested in the United States, we
lose 2.5 tons of soil.</TE>
<TE>   And, as it is removed by water, the soil takes with it many tons
of nitrogen fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides and other chemicals
that poison the waters downstream, require more expensive treatment
facilities in cities and create large areas of oxygen-starved,
fish-destroying "dead zones" in coastal waters.</TE>
<TE>   Not only are our fields losing quantity, the remaining soil is of
ever-decreasing quality. The soil that is left is ripped up to
produce a season of genetically identical, chemical-dependent crops,
then left bare for much of the year, exposed to wind and rain. Like a
drug addict who loses the ability to feel normal without chemical
stimulus, modern agriculture has so fried the soil that it cannot
produce without larger and larger infusions of chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   Water poured onto arid fields quickly evaporates, leaving behind
increased amounts of salt that only reduce the ability of the soil to
produce.</TE>
<TE>   All that accelerates soil degradation and requires ever more
fertilizer and other chemicals to make up for the natural nutritional
value of soil that has been wiped away by modern, high-intensity
agriculture.</TE>
<TE>   Good soil is not just dirt. It is a hive of life, much of it
either microscopic or even disgusting to urban eyes because urbanites
don't understand the need for the growth and decay of slimy things to
sustain life. Good farmers are not just people who dig in the dirt.
They are the stewards of healthy soil, many of them unrecognized or
even dismissed by those who can't comprehend why anyone would want to
do such hard work so far away from a Starbucks.</TE>
<TE>   Because it takes fewer people to beat the earth into submission
than it does to lovingly care for it, fewer farmers are producing
more food, and fewer rural communities survive to support and be
supported by those farmers.</TE>
<TE>   But it cannot last. And the final effects will be felt far from
the fields, in the deepest urban canyons.</TE>
<TE>   Many city dwellers seem to think we would be doing farmers a
favor--and ourselves no harm--by turning them into computer
pieceworkers. But the fact is that fewer people on farms is both
cause and symptom of degraded land, land that is rapidly losing its
ability to produce healthy food, now and into the future.</TE>

<HD>'Same-Day Voting' Makes Hanging Chads Look Quaint</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAWN STEEL</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you use your credit card at almost any retailer, you'll be asked
for valid ID as a fraud prevention measure. Imagine a cashier's
reaction if, instead of a driver's license, you handed over a
preprinted bank deposit slip and a pre- approved credit card
application you had received in the mail.</LD>
<LD>   While that may not be good enough for Target, backers of the
"same-day-voting" initiative on November's ballot think it's more
than enough identification in order to register and cast a ballot
after walking up to a polling place on election day.</LD>
<LD>   That's right, this "reform" would allow Californians to register
on election day and vote after showing "proof" of identity by using
one of a laundry list of various items considered to be sufficient
proof of residence. They also could register by going to their county
registrar's office during the 28 days before an election.</LD>
<TE>   The initiative's proclaimed intent is to increase voter turnout.
This seemingly innocuous measure appeals to our desire to maximize
participation in our representative system of government. After all,
it's easy to imagine something like an untimely relocation causing a
person to fall through the cracks and be ineligible to vote.</TE>
<TE>   However, closer examination of the initiative makes it plain that
it would become easier to commit voter fraud and harder to
investigate such misdeeds and that an already complicated voting
system would become even more complex and unwieldy.</TE>
<TE>   Take, for example, what will be considered valid identification if
this initiative passes: utility bills, credit card bills, bank
statements, preprinted checks or bank deposit slips, a vehicle
registration and "mail addressed to the voter at his or her current
residence address." About the only thing missing is a note from your
mother.</TE>
<TE>   Initiative proponents contend this would actually reduce voter
fraud because there currently is no ID requirement that Californians
must meet in order to register and vote.</TE>
<TE>   Far more likely would be organized voter fraud by unscrupulous
campaigns exploiting this unbelievably permissive list.</TE>
<TE>   Riverside County Registrar Mischelle Townsend says it would be
extremely difficult to prevent fraud if this initiative passes. Now,
if there's any question about your eligibility, you can cast a
"provisional" ballot, which is set aside and counted last, after its
validity has been ascertained. The same-day-voting initiative would
abolish provisional ballots, thereby eliminating the main avenue for
investigating voter fraud even as it multiplies opportunities to
commit fraud.</TE>
<TE>   If this initiative passes, you can count on vanloads of warm
bodies armed with utility bills rolling up to polling locations in
closely contested legislative and congressional districts, where a
little fraud can go a long way toward deciding the outcome of a race.
The initiative also requires county registrars to station a worker
outside polling places. This would mean recruitment, training and pay
for thousands of additional workers, an expensive and time-consuming
order for officials already hard pressed to scratch up enough workers
to discharge their current responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   Small wonder that the registrars of some of the state's largest
counties think the same-day-voting initiative is a bad idea.</TE>
<TE>   The measure's promise to increase voter turnout is also spurious.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters say California voter turnout in November 2000 hit its
lowest level since 1964, when our voting laws were certainly less
flexible. Since then, we have enacted very liberal absentee voting
laws and the "motor voter" program and shortened the registration
blackout period to just 14 days before an election. You can even
download voter registration forms from the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Voting has been made successively easier during the last two
decades, yet turnout continues to decline. By what magic would this
horribly flawed initiative reverse this sad trend? Clearly the cure
to voter apathy lies elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   The right to vote is a precious franchise, but the same-day-voting
initiative would only undermine it by creating new pathways to fraud
and placing burdensome new mandates on already overwhelmed,
underfunded county election officials.</TE>
<TE>   The best way to increase turnout is to give voters candidates they
can believe in and elected officials who respond to the will of the
people rather than powerful special interests.</TE>

<LD>The Indians love to hate him. The Europeans are frowning at him. The
fundamentalists are issuing death threats against him. Pakistan's
politicians are throwing mud at him. And even the Americans, who only
recently applauded him, are now grumbling.</LD>
<LD>   The man in question, of course, is Pakistan's President Pervez
Musharraf. Paradoxically, the fact that almost everyone seems to be
unhappy with him right now may well be a sign that he is doing
something right.</LD>
<LD>   What is it that Musharraf is doing that so many do not like?</LD>
<TE>   The Indians do not like him because he has turned out to not be
the typical "military dictator" that Pakistan has produced from time
to time. His austere lifestyle, his refusal to build a cult of
personality and the fact that he has not thrown thousands of
opponents in prison distinguish him from previous dictators.
Musharraf also has distinguished himself from former dictators by
refusing to be drawn into a dangerous showdown with India.</TE>
<TE>   The Europeans criticize Musharraf because he is not complying with
their standards of human rights; instead he opts to not offend the
religious beliefs of the majority of Pakistanis.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan's professional politicians dislike Musharraf because he
has deprived them of business. For decades, the business of politics
in Pakistan has been a politics of business. Politicians owe various
Pakistani state banks about $30 billion in overdue loans. In
Pakistan, people enter politics to get their hand into the cookie
jar, not to manage the affairs of society.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans frown at Musharraf because he has not sent troops to
close all the madrasas (religious schools). Also, he has insisted
that due process be respected when alleged terrorists are put on
trial.</TE>
<TE>   Because Musharraf holds one of the most dangerous and difficult
jobs in the world right now, the attacks launched against him are
both unfair and counterproductive.</TE>
<TE>   The world needs a stable Pakistan to root out the remainder of the
Al Qaeda terrorist gang and to defuse the situation on the
subcontinent.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, predictions about Pakistan heading for "an Islamic
explosion" have proved utterly out of place. The country has
experienced several terrorist attacks in recent months. These
incidents, while tragic, do not amount to a major threat to
Pakistan's stability. And there is growing evidence that there is no
significant constituency for the ideology of terror anywhere in
Pakistan. However, there are signs that Musharraf may be putting
himself on a slippery slope. He is proposing constitutional changes
that appear to be ill-conceived and half-baked. At the root of the
problem is his misunderstanding of what is called "the Turkish
model."</TE>
<TE>   Put simply, the Turkish model is based on two key principles: a
constitutional system that guarantees Turkey's secular character and
an acknowledgment of the role of the armed forces as guardians and
protectors of the constitution. Since the 1920s, the Turkish army has
intervened four times to "correct" the course of the nation's
politics by changing the government of the day. In every case, the
generals took care to maintain a line between the military and the
civilian authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf, however, is proposing a system under which he would
retain his position as president while remaining commander of the
armed forces. He also wants to give the presidency executive powers
that would render the position of the prime minister superfluous.
What he is proposing is more like the Arab model of military regimes
than what occurs in Turkey.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, the question remains whether the Turkish model is
applicable to Pakistan or, indeed, to any other Muslim country. The
Algerians and the Tunisians have flirted with the Turkish model in
different ways, while the Sudanese too have been tempted by it at
different times. The Turkish model now is being looked at by many
Iraqis as they think of the post-Saddam Hussein era. Because most
Muslim states lack credible political institutions, the army is often
regarded as the only organ of state around which a national system
could be formed.</TE>
<TE>   However, the Turkish model of governance may not be suitable for
some Muslim nations. It is based on a strong sense of Turkish
national--one might even say racial--identity. It has denied
substantial minorities, such as the Kurds and ethnic Arabs, a chance
for self-definition and self-expression within the system, thus
provoking decades of tension and even war.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan is made up of several "nations" with different histories,
cultures and languages, united only by their common Islamic faith. To
introduce the Turkish concept of secularism into Pakistan would
amount to a denial of its founding principle.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf's idea to create a national security council based on
the Turkish model is a good one. Such a council could act as a
watchdog to prevent the armed forces and the civilian government from
exceeding their legal powers or using their positions for
self-enrichment.</TE>
<TE>   For the exercise to succeed, however, it is important that the
army stay out of day-to-day politics. Musharraf wants it both ways.
And this may be his first major mistake.</TE>

<AU>PATT MORRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The jokey menu has been one of the major food groups for political
campaigns for a while now; Bill Clinton used one in 1992, listing the
bill of fare from "George Bush's Waffle House," and when Kathleen
Brown ran for governor in 1994, Pete Wilson's campaign came up with a
full-sized "Kathleen Brown's House of Waffles" menu, with dishes like
a "pay raise souffle."</LD>
<LD>   The Bill Simon gubernatorial campaign has now concocted the same
thing for "Chez Gray, an Exclusive Dinner Club," every dish mocking
ferocious fund-raising by Davis and his generous supporters. Dining
at Chez Gray "requires a minimum order of $100,000."</LD>
<LD>   Sample "a traditional Normandie special: a 34% raise for prison
guards," for $251,000, referring to the quarter-million-dollar
campaign contribution to Davis after the governor approved the big
raise over five years.</LD>
<TE>   To impress your date, order the million-dollar CTA platter, a
"delightful cuisine" of desirable morsels for the California
Teachers' Assn., whose president said Davis asked for the
seven-figure donation from the CTA at a Valentine's Day meeting in
his office.</TE>
<TE>   You'd think that, even though Simon the multimillionaire
businessman isn't spending his own money on his campaign, his aides
might have been able to afford a good French dictionary and found
that "hors d'oeuvres" isn't spelled "hors d'ouevres," or that the
word for "platter" is "ecuelle," not "eucelle."</TE>
<TE>   C'est la viande.</TE>
<TE>   The Criminal Meets the Political--Again</TE>
<TE>   In politics, as in much else, everything old is new again.</TE>
<TE>   After Gray Davis set in motion "the Amber alert," a system to
alert the public to child abductions by flashing the news on freeway
message signs, Bill Simon lambasted Davis for not doing so earlier,
and cited the work of the Polly Klaas Foundation as a group that
tried to get Davis to come aboard earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Polly Klaas is the 12-year-old Petaluma girl who, in 1994, was
kidnapped from her home and murdered, and she figured in an earlier
campaign, as 5-year-old kidnap-murder victim Samantha Runnion is
figuring in this one.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, California's Democratic candidate for attorney general,
Tom Umberg, aired an ad suggesting that Polly might be alive had not
the incumbent, Republican opponent Dan Lungren, failed to adopt a
statewide computerized program for tracking parolees--an ad condemned
across the political board.</TE>
<TE>   Politicians and Food, Version Two</TE>
<TE>   Great moments in statesmanship: bits of an exchange in Congress
last month between Bakersfield Republican Bill Thomas and Sacramento
Democrat Robert Matsui, regarding another member of Congress whose
name rhymes with "baloney":</TE>
<TE>   Thomas: "... if the gentleman from California did not understand
the context in which I referred to his argument ... I said it was the
* * *  baloney; and if the gentleman does not understand the use of
that phrase, let me explain it. Apparently the argument that the
Democrats have been making for the last hour is baloney."</TE>
<TE>   Matsui: "Mr. Speaker ... I think the gentleman has used a member's
name in a way that is diminishing to a member, and is putting the
colleague up to contempt and ridicule. If I may have a ruling, Mr.
Speaker ... "</TE>
<TE>   Thomas: "Mr. Speaker ... the gentleman from California would ask
unanimous consent to remove the statement and put in its place that
the argument from the gentleman from California about the way in
which the gentleman from Connecticut [James H. Maloney] was treated
is phony baloney.... The gentleman from California is willing to
strike that structure which has been presented if it offends the
gentleman because I want to move on with the debate."The clerk
(reading back the remarks): " ... if the gentleman from California
did not understand the context in which I referred to his argument
... I said it was the 'Maloney Baloney.... ' "</TE>
<TE>   The speaker pro tempore: "The chair is aware that the gentleman
from California was using the word 'baloney' to characterize only the
rationale offered by his opposition, but the chair nevertheless finds
that the use of another member's surname as though an adjective for a
word of ridicule is not in order. Without objection, the offending
word is stricken."</TE>
<TE>   What does that make us, chopped liver?</TE>
<TE>   Till Council Meetings Do Them Part</TE>
<TE>   It was a marriage made on the campaign trail and formalized in
Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. City Council member Wendy Greuel and literary agent and
campaign volunteer Dean Schramm met while trying to get people to
register to vote.</TE>
<TE>   They dated at the Sunland-Tujunga watermelon festival.</TE>
<TE>   And they got married Saturday in Santa Barbara, the first marriage
for both, with their nuptials commended during a City Council meeting
last week.</TE>
<TE>   "When he walked precincts and did fund-raising for me, I figured
I'd better hold onto him before I lost him," Greuel told her council
colleagues, among them Eric Garcetti, who is engaged to be married.</TE>
<TE>   Federal Judge Harry Pregerson pronounced them husband and council
member. The couple will live in the council district, in Van Nuys,
and are postponing their Caribbean honeymoon until the council
recesses in late August. In the meantime, the couple will file city
ethics forms disclosing their wedding gifts.</TE>
<TE>   Not the Best Endorsement</TE>
<TE>   The name of a former Republican presidential candidate has
surfaced in a quirky connection to the San Diego trial of the man
accused of kidnapping and murdering 7-year-old Danielle Van Dam.</TE>
<TE>   Defendant David Westerfield's 18-year-old son, Neal, testified
that his father downloaded the porno found on the father's computers.
The son admitted that he sometimes browsed online porno sites--but
never under his own name.</TE>
<TE>   When he visited X-rated sites, he used several names, including
that of Bob Dole, the former Kansas senator who ran for president
against Bill Clinton in 1996, and later served as spokesman for the
erectile dysfunction drug Viagra.</TE>
<TE>   The admission brought laughter from audience, attorneys, jurors
and even the dour-faced judge.</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * The state's Legislative Women's Caucus and domestic violence
groups are applauding the signing of a bill that lets victims of
domestic violence sue their attackers for damages and recover
attorneys' fees. Assemblywoman Sarah Reyes, a Fresno Democrat, says
California is now the first state to restore that provision of the
1994 federal Violence Against Women Act, which was overturned by the
Supreme Court on grounds it was a state, not a federal matter.</TE>
<TE>   * If you're lining up for jury service Tuesday morning outside the
civil courthouse on South Commonwealth Avenue in Los Angeles, that
military-looking fellow isn't courthouse security: he's Sgt. Jury,
and he wants you to do your bit for "Operation Jury Service" and show
up in court when the jury summons tells you to, especially now that
one-day, one-trial rule is up and running.</TE>
<TE>   * It's California Dreamin' tonight in Santa Monica, where actress,
activist and Mamas and the Papas founding member Michelle Phillips
leads a campaign rally and volunteer gathering for City Council
candidate Jerry Rubin.</TE>
<TE>   You Can Quote Me</TE>
<TE>   "Abuse of power is sometimes an angry, out-of-control cop beating
up a teenager in California. Sometimes it's an angry, out-of-control
judge like Denise Majette."</TE>
<TE>   A snippet from a radio ad by Georgia Rep. Cynthia McKinney,
comparing her primary-election opponent to the Inglewood police
officer who slammed a handcuffed teenager onto the hood of a car.
Majette, a former judge, once sentenced a speeder to two days in jail
and a $1,000 fine, a sentence that was later vacated.</TE>

<HD>Pick the Best Chief, Period</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The array of candidates for Los Angeles police chief is a happy
dilemma for the panel that must choose the top three, and for Mayor
James K. Hahn, who gets final pick. William Bratton, the former head
of the New York Police Department, wants to lead the Los Angeles
Police Department. So do Portland, Ore., Police Chief Mark Kroeker
and Oxnard Police Chief Art Lopez, both former LAPD deputy chiefs. In
all, nearly 50 candidates applied.</LD>
<LD>   Mayors forced out the last two chiefs after single five-year
terms. Those LAPD leaders were buffeted by the hardball tactics of
the police union and by a demoralized rank and file that dreaded
reform. The new chief must forge a team from this dispirited enmity.</LD>
<LD>   The entry of Bratton into the competition should at least
invigorate the debate over how to finally and firmly transform the
LAPD, a job far from completed by the last two chiefs.</LD>
<TE>   Willie L. Williams, an African American and an outsider, arrived
from Philadelphia in 1992 in a city that had been racked by riots.
The LAPD command had tolerated bad cops, didn't bother to track which
officers most often roughed up suspects and disregarded the gulf
between the by-the-book policing taught in the academy and what
happened in the street. Williams calmed the animus between the
department and the black community and put cops closer to
neighborhoods but couldn't deliver most reforms.</TE>
<TE>   His successor, Bernard C. Parks, also black, left the department
last month in much better shape than he found it. During his five
years as chief, he promoted diversity and developed a stringent
discipline system. The police force investigated citizen complaints
instead of tossing them. But Parks, an LAPD veteran, scorned the
community policing instituted by Williams, seemed blind to the
systemic problems that allowed the police corruption and brutality of
the Rampart scandal to fester and fought the federally mandated
improvements sparked by that scandal.</TE>
<TE>   The next chief will need to strengthen civilian oversight, track
officers' records by computer and collect racial data during traffic
stops, among other reforms, to satisfy the federal consent decree.
Also, the department must be brought to its budgeted strength of
10,000, a goal that may be within reach because the LAPD has slowed
the number of officers departing for retirement or other jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton, who until recently was a monitor of the LAPD's progress
on the consent decree, would not have added his high-profile name to
the list if he thought the fix was in for any candidate. A citizens
panel is developing the selection criteria, and the Police Commission
will winnow the field by late August. The final three candidates
should detail their leadership ideas in public forums. The more the
public knows, the more easily Hahn can defend his choice.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor should not choose a chief on the basis of who would
appease San Fernando Valley voters leaning toward secession or black
voters still angry that Hahn dumped Parks or Latino voters seeking
the department's first Latino chief.</TE>
<TE>   What the LAPD does need is an acknowledged leader who can inspire
commanders and the rank and file alike to follow, not obstruct, a
vision of reform and community policing.</TE>

<LD>It's amazing how time puts a patina on things. Even a tiki totem pole
gathers charm with the passage of enough years. (Emphasis on
"enough.")</LD>
<LD>   And so, with pangs of nostalgia, fans of kitsch--and anybody who
thinks the Southern California landscape is slowly taking on a look
of bland tastefulness--will say farewell next month to two remaining
Disneyland-area icons of 1950s and '60s in-your-face architecture:
the Rip Van Winkle Motel and Melodyland. The latter, a tent-shaped
former musical theater/evangelical church, will be replaced by a
shopping/hotel complex in something scarily called "fusion
architecture." If only it could have hung on a couple more years,
we're sure Melodyland could have been as universally beloved as the
first McDonald's.</LD>
<LD>   Given 20 or 30 years, a car design or building style takes on an
embarrassing aura of design fatigue. Anybody up for a Pinto hatchback
or a monolithic black-glass office tower? Now, give it 20 or 30 more
years. That brings us to the new retro-Thunderbird and freshly built
tract houses with front porches.</LD>
<TE>   If only the gathering of age did the same for baby boomers heading
into their AARP days. But it works only for buildings, cars and, on a
faster cycle, clothing. (Oh, save us from another rash of hip-hugger
bell bottoms.)</TE>
<TE>   So here is our prediction: In 20 years, sliding aluminum-frame
windows are going to be hot. Really hot. Vintage. Worth money. No
point busting them out of the house to make way for simulated
genuine-wood frames and arched fan windows. At about the same time,
someone in Southern California will be tearing down those
so-last-decade buildings of spare flat concrete in hues of purple and
rust to put up a rocket-ship hotel with a blasting yellow neon sign.</TE>
<TE>   Pop quiz: How many Southern California cities gave an enthusiastic
thumbs up to strip malls, ignoring their deteriorating downtowns,
until the idea of having a "there" there suddenly caught on? Now
downtown redevelopment is on municipal lips and subdivisions come
with instant village districts. Ah, for the day when they rip out all
this tile-roofed pseudo-Spanish colonial and Tuscan architecture and
give us back our avocado shag carpets.</TE>

<LD>There's nothing like a dramatic rescue involving big machinery, brave
men and fraying threads of hope to pull a distracted nation into
focus.</LD>
<LD>   For more than three days it was simply more of the bad news that's
constantly been in the air. Market crash not over yet, and nine
miners trapped by flooding deep underground in Pennsylvania. Another
little girl abducted and killed, scores die in ghastly crash at
Ukrainian air show and drill bit breaks during desperate effort to
reach trapped miners. Former executives of a large company arrested
on fraud charges, and a town still recovering from the crash of a
terrorist-hijacked plane on Sept. 11 waits on edge.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday, nothing had been heard since Thursday from the miners
trapped inside a half-flooded chamber. Officials had to emphasize
that the drilling was "still'' a rescue operation, not something
grimmer.</LD>
<TE>   Such sagging hopes made the jump to joy all the higher late
Saturday night when the drilling operation reached the air pocket
where the miners were and rescuers found that there were nine cold,
famished, jubilant men waiting for them. People who went to bed early
or otherwise missed the news woke Sunday to the happy headlines. And
to a sense of perspective.</TE>
<TE>   In the same section of The Times on Sunday was a littler story by
staff writer Eric Slater, set in Whitewater, Wis., a town of 12,000.
The state university branch in Whitewater is being whipsawed by state
budget cuts that can't keep up with sinking revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The school makes for a high population of professionals watching
their retirement funds shrivel, and retirees whose income is drying
up. They're remarkably sanguine about it. Either the markets will
recover or the whole economy will go south, said one business
professor, in which case "the least of your worries is going to be
your 401(k) plan.''</TE>
<TE>   The locals' reaction to being reminded that the economy is shaky
is "So?''</TE>
<TE>   No one said "So?'' at the sight of the first miner out of the hole
in Pennsylvania, rising cold, soaked and coal-blackened from his
near-death chamber 240 feet underground. No shrugs for the rescuers'
feat of pumping warm air through a small hole into the chamber, a
brilliant move to counter the bone-chilling cold of water three feet
deep. No shrugs for aboveground workers' grim determination as one,
then two, giant drill bits broke.</TE>
<TE>   This morning, readers will get the stories of how the miners
survived, what they did and said. What's on the financial pages will
settle into its proper place.</TE>

<LD>L.A. County supervisors have come up with a plan to rescue the
county's collapsing health-care network ("Property Tax Hike
Proposed," July 25). The only problem is that they're effectively
putting a Band-Aid on the problem and not getting to the root causes.
The emergency rooms that their initiative would fund would be
overflowing with families whose local health clinics were closed
because of budget cuts and senior citizens malnourished because they
no longer had home-care workers to care for them.</LD>
<LD>   Unless we realize that our focus should be on funding preventive
care to reduce the need for emergency rooms or trauma care, we'll
never really solve the county's health-care problem.</LD>

<TE>   I do not like to vote to raise taxes, but I would have to vote for
this proposal. In April 1993, I was involved in a major auto accident
and sustained injuries that, I was told by doctors, 97% of victims
die from.</TE>
<TE>   Because of very timely assistance from paramedics from Station 100
in Reseda and the fantastic medical staff at the trauma center at
Northridge Hospital, I survived. I cannot say enough about how much
we need trauma centers. That is why I will vote for--and everyone
else should vote for--this tax increase. At any time it could be you
or one of your loved ones who will need the service.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I'm surprised that Zev Yaroslavsky and the other members of the
Board of Supervisors feeding at the public trough would have the
nerve to suggest placing the trauma center issue on the backs of
homeowners. On first glance, less than $50 a year for most homeowners
doesn't seem so bad. Well, it may be that amount for now, but anyone
with an IQ higher than room temperature understands that it's the
thin edge of the wedge being inserted, and board members have the big
mallet ready to pound on the other end. How many additional "Hey,
it's just 50 bucks a year!" measures are waiting to spring forth if
this one flies?</TE>
<TE>   Public facilities like trauma centers and emergency rooms should
be paid for by everyone or no one. Maybe it's time to look into
corporate sponsorship. How about the "FedEx Trauma Center"?</TE>

<LD>Re "Immigration Reform on House Democrats' Minds," July 23: As
someone who waited for a long time to legally enter the U.S., I came
here with an inherent respect for our laws. Now it is proposed that
millions of illegal entrants will be rewarded for their lawbreaking
by a plan to legitimize them through "earned legalization." When
people are rewarded for an illegal act, which is probably their first
interaction with the U.S., how will they learn to respect or observe
our other laws?</LD>
<LD>   The political advantage sought by the opponents of immigration
enforcement must be irresistibly enticing. Otherwise, why invite such
a blatant disregard of the fundamental premise upon which the U.S.
was built--to be a nation of laws?</LD>

<HD>Arrest of Adelphia Founder and Two Sons</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Adelphia Founder, 2 Sons Are Charged With Fraud," July 25:
Hooray!</LD>
<LD>   The man who sends out scare notices to his customers ("Cable Theft
Is a Crime!"), who imposes his "morals" on others by personally
censoring local public-access cable programs and charges inflated
rates for lousy basic cable service (ever try getting a refund from
Adelphia for poor or no reception? No way!) is finally where he
belongs--facing charges of fraud and stealing from his shareholders
on a massive scale.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Hruska</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When Adelphia Communications purchased Century Cable in Southern
California, one of the first changes made was to eliminate all adult
channels (Playboy, Spice, et al) because these channels offended the
devoutly religious founder of Adelphia, John Rigas.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, however, perpetrating a fraud that reaches into
billions of dollars is not offensive to Rigas' religious principles.</TE>
<TE>   Philip R. Blustein</TE>
<TE>   Beverly Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So the Rigases were arrested and taken away in handcuffs.</TE>
<TE>   What I (and, I'm sure, many others) would like to know is, where
are the handcuffs for "Kenny-Boy" Lay, Jeffrey Skilling and Andrew
Fastow?</TE>
<TE>   David McVey</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Basketball star Allen Iverson, charged with crimes involving
violence and a gun, is allowed to avoid arrest long enough to hold an
all-night party. He then turns himself in.</TE>
<TE>   After alerting the media, the government arrested 77-year-old
Rigas and his sons on charges of fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Why was it necessary to stage an elaborate production, including
handcuffing the suspects and leading them to the waiting cars?</TE>
<TE>   Was it done to serve as a warning of criminal prosecution,
including public humiliation (cruel and unusual punishment) to
business executives?</TE>
<TE>   Or was it a grandstand play by the administration to fool the
voting public into thinking that the administration had a tough
policy toward business?</TE>
<TE>   It certainly wasn't because of a fear of violence or escape by the
Rigas family.</TE>

<TE>   It is often said that a conservative is a liberal who was mugged.
Now it may turn out that a liberal is a conservative whose 401(k) was
mugged.</TE>

<LD>Thank you for "If It Takes a Leap of Faith to Talk to a Stranger, Our
Values Need Some Work" (Commentary, July 24). When I was a child, 20
or more years ago, all of the children in the neighborhood played in
the streets until the street lights came on. Parents would check on
us periodically, and nosy neighbors would extend their watchful eyes.
We were relatively safe from danger; safety came in numbers as well
as from neighbors who cared.</LD>
<LD>   Times have changed. Instead of children interacting with each
other and exercising outdoors, they are inside on computers,
telephones and PlayStations. In addition, parents are now instilling
tremendous fear of strangers in their children, which in turn will
keep them from playing with friends outdoors and getting to know
their neighbors. There must be a happy medium, where children can be
taught to be careful but not terrified to walk outside. I wish
parents would consider the consequences of their panic before passing
it on to their children.</LD>

<LD>Even though there is no direct evidence to connect Zacarias Moussaoui
to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, and
there is no evidence that he ever killed anyone, President Bush and
Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft are dead set on seeing this French national
dead ("Moussaoui Hearing Delay Is Sought," July 25).</LD>
<LD>   Now I understand why our country's leaders are not willing to make
themselves or other Americans subject to the International Criminal
Court. They know all about trumped-up charges. In a quest for
security, this administration has become the oppressor under the
guise of freedom, and it deserves neither security nor freedom.</LD>

Again" (July 24). Having lived in Alhambra since the 1980s, I
personally understand the passion both cities have toward traffic
control. And while I would not have used the phrase "the first battle
of Fremont Avenue backfired and blew up in Alhambra's face," I do
commend you for an evenhanded reporting of this sensitive topic.
Traffic control and the 710 Freeway are topics to avoid in any polite
setting in this part of town.</LD>

<LD>As MBA students, we are taught that, when evaluating financial

Disclosure Raises New Doubts," July 24). Had the media and public
been given only two hours to look over Enron's books, Kenneth Lay
would probably still be riding in a limousine to the office. Bill
Simon should give Californians a reasonable opportunity to decide
whether he has the acumen and ethics to lead our state. He should
make his tax records completely available and then allow us to give
fair judgment. I hope Simon steps up in his effort to win the job he
seeks.</LD>

<TE>   I find Simon's limited disclosure of his tax returns indefensible,
but why didn't The Times or other newspapers send reporters who are
certified public accountants? It's silly to complain, as Patt
Morrison does (July 24) that political reporters are ill-equipped to
cover the Simon taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Roland Greene</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I was sympathetic with Simon's desire to maintain some degree of
financial privacy--especially in light of Gov. Gray Davis' obvious
compulsive, obsessive money cravings. But then President Bush came
out with the most inane statement. After all the market
losses--probably not started but certainly furthered and accelerated
by greedy, wealthy fellow business persons--he states younger people
would like to invest their Social Security in the market so they have
control (July 25). He doesn't get it. That's the statement of someone
who doesn't know the world most of us live in.</TE>
<TE>   Somebody has to beam him down. I'm approaching 60. I have to put
three kids through college. I could have retired in a few years. Not
now. I have a lot of lost ground to make up because of these greedy
individuals. So what is my feeling about Simon now? I want to see a
complete statement of his assets and income. Anyone who has too much
is from another world and is not fit to govern real people.</TE>

<TE>   Re George Skelton's July 22 column, "California's
Show-Me-the-Money Governor": That is precisely the point, Mr.
Skelton. Precisely because Davis has disclosed his financial affairs
and all campaign contributions, you can write a column jumping all
over him. Sure, he has received funds from questionable sources.
Sure, he should--maybe, probably--return some of the funds. But you
know all these details because Davis has disclosed it to all of us.
Not Simon. Again, what is he hiding? A very big difference between
the two.</TE>
<TE>   George Domingo</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So this is how it ends, with the mostly disliked and incompetent
Davis and the hobbling Simon--who campaigns and responds as slowly as
he fills out his tax return. It's not going to be long before Davis
beats Simon in an election that will probably have the lowest turnout
in the history of California.</TE>
<TE>   Former L.A. Mayor Richard Riordan, can't you come back and run in
this race as an independent?</TE>
<TE>   Rick Radtke</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Having the choice between Davis and Simon is like having a choice
between those two guys in the movie "Dumb and Dumber." Both are
incredibly annoying. Why don't we just call off the election with the
stipulation that each of the candidates donate the proceeds of his
campaign war chest to the state? And with the added stipulation that
Davis (since he'd get to keep his job) go around and raise funds for
the state budget. That's the one thing he's really good at, and he
does it all the time anyway.</TE>

<HD>Frank Inn, 86; Trained Benji the Dog</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frank Inn, the trainer of some of Hollywood's best-known animal
performers, including Benji the dog, has died. He was 86.</LD>
<LD>   In failing health for some time with diabetes, Inn died Saturday
at a nursing home in Sylmar, his daughter Kathleen Hees said. Inn had
fallen in February and had been in the nursing home since that time.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to the spunky Benji, probably the most famous of his
animal proteges, Inn worked with Arnold the pig on the 1960s sitcom
"Green Acres" and with Cleo the basset hound on the 1950s program
"The People's Choice." Inn's career, which started in films in the
1930s, spanned 50 years.</LD>
<TE>   Born in Canby, Ind., Inn was the eldest of four children. His
parents ran a flower shop and nursery. As a teenager he rode the
rails west, taking a variety of odd jobs, including circus clown, as
he made his way to California.</TE>
<TE>   His life took a sudden and nearly fatal turn not long after he
arrived in California. Seriously injured when he was struck by a car,
he was pronounced dead by a doctor at a Culver City hospital and
taken to the morgue, his daughter said. But a student learning
embalming detected a faint heartbeat, and Inn was given medical
attention.</TE>
<TE>   He was confined to a wheelchair for what was to be a long
recovery. He was given a puppy to keep him company, and the
experience with the dog proved to be his first at training animals.</TE>
<TE>   When he was well enough to return to work, he started doing odd
jobs for Henry East, MGM's prop master, who also was the animal
wrangler on the lot. Inn learned how to work with animals and started
building a career training them for the screen.</TE>
<TE>   For 14 years he worked with Rudd Weatherwax, the trainer of the
dogs that played Lassie and Rin Tin Tin. Though Weatherwax got the
credit for training Lassie, it was Inn, his daughter recalled, who
stayed with the dog in the freight car on the train to location sites
to film "Lassie Come Home" (1943).</TE>
<TE>   Inn started his own company in 1954. He worked out of his ranch in
Sun Valley, which he stocked with dogs, cats, farm animals and jungle
animals.</TE>
<TE>   He found the dog that played Benji at an animal shelter in Burbank
in 1960.</TE>
<TE>   Inn stopped by the facility after getting a call from an animal
control officer who told him the honey-brown part-terrier needed a
home or would be put to sleep.</TE>
<TE>   Inn took the dog, who was then called Higgins, to his Sun Valley
compound and eventually found a spot for him on the 1963-70 series
"Petticoat Junction." When the show folded, Higgins retired, and Inn
never expected him to work again.</TE>
<TE>   In 1973, Joe Camp, a Dallas filmmaker who had written a script
tentatively called "Benji," visited Inn's compound, looking for a dog
to play the title role.</TE>
<TE>   "I showed him 300 dogs," Inn later said, "and he wasn't very
impressed. But as he was leaving, he spotted [Higgins] in the yard,
and right away he said, 'Now, that's Benji.' " The film, the first of
several featuring the canine character, was released in 1974. The
original Benji died in 1978 at age 19. His offspring appeared in
subsequent productions.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his work on "Petticoat Junction" and "Green Acres,"
Inn trained the nearly 500 animals that appeared on the 1960s series
"The Beverly Hillbillies."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his daughter Hees of Chico, Inn is survived by
another daughter, Lori Grajeda, also of Chico; two grandchildren; and
two great-grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Plans for memorial services are pending.</TE>

<HD>D. Olmedo Patino, 94; Avid Art Collector</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Dolores Olmedo Patino, a shrewd self-made woman and avid art
collector whose museum houses the biggest collections of works by
Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, died late Saturday of a heart attack at
her estate in suburban Xochimilco. She was 94.</LD>
<LD>   From humble beginnings in Guerrero state, Olmedo Patino amassed
enormous wealth in construction and real estate while cultivating a
friendship with the great Mexican muralist Rivera, who died in 1957.
She bought many of her 140 Rivera works and 25 Kahlo paintings from
Rivera and many on the open market, including a recent purchase of
cubist work by Rivera.</LD>
<LD>   In 1988, she transferred title to her striking,
beautifully restored 17th century Spanish Colonial mansion and estate,
La Noria, to the people of Mexico, along with her art collection. Several
of her Kahlo and Rivera works travel frequently to international
exhibitions.</LD>
<TE>   At his death, Rivera willed his and Kahlo's works and
images--Kahlo died in 1954--to the nation and named Olmedo Patino as
head of the trust that controls them. Assets include the Kahlo
museum, the Blue House and the Rivera museum, as well as intellectual
rights to both artists' works and their archives.</TE>
<TE>   She maintained control over the trusts until her death, and her
stewardship spurred criticism from some scholars over issues ranging
from the restoration of the Kahlo house to restrictions on access to
the two artists' archives. The makers of an upcoming movie on the
life of Kahlo, starring Salma Hayek, had to acquire permission from
Olmedo Patino to use Kahlo's image.</TE>
<TE>   Often portrayed as a rival of Kahlo's for Rivera's affection,
Olmedo Patino said that she and the muralist had been nothing more
than friends. But in interviews with The Times, she made no effort to
conceal her disdain for Kahlo, saying that Kahlo never would have
become famous, had she not married Rivera.</TE>
<TE>   "Nor would she have been famous without me," Olmedo Patino
told The Times, a reference to the frequency with which her Kahlo works
are loaned to exhibitions, a factor in Kahlo's enormous popularity.
"In the future, Kahlo will fade away. Frida is in style now."</TE>
<TE>   Olmedo Patino's wealth brought her political power in the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. She was on friendly terms
with a succession of Mexican presidents, from Miguel Aleman through
Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Her son, Alfredo Phillips Olmedo, is a
former Mexican ambassador to Canada and Japan, a onetime federal
congressman and former chief executive of the North American
Development Bank.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the former ambassador, Olmedo Patino is survived by
sons Carlos and Eduardo; daughter Irene; and 14 grandchildren. Her
husband, the naturalized Briton Howard S. Phillips, who settled in
Mexico after covering the Mexican Revolution as a war correspondent,
died in 1972.</TE>
<TE>   "Her intention all along, from the very beginning, was to leave
her great collection to the Mexican people," Alfredo Phillips Olmedo
said Sunday. Daughter Irene Phillips Olmedo said her mother was
"intensely proud of Mexico and being Mexican."</TE>
<TE>   Olmedo Patino demonstrated business acumen in her 20s by buying a
brick factory and expanding into construction and, with it, vast real
estate holdings. She was one of the founders of ICA, a Mexican
construction company that, at one time, was one of Latin America's
largest.</TE>
<TE>   As a schoolgirl, Olmedo Patino met Rivera when the artist was
completing a cycle of murals in the Ministry of Education. Rivera
asked her mother if he could sketch her and did several works,
including several nudes.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, I never told my mother I posed nude. She would have
killed me," Olmedo Patino told The Times in a 1993 interview.</TE>
<TE>   Thus begun a relationship with Rivera that continued until his
death. He spent weeks with her family at her Acapulco estate in his
declining years, after Kahlo's death, and did several portraits of
family members. She helped finance Rivera's trip to the Soviet Union
for medical treatment shortly before his death.</TE>
<TE>   Rivera gave Olmedo Patino a list of important works of his that
were on the market and she set about acquiring them, her daughter
Irene said Sunday. She bought several Kahlo works from industrialist
Eduardo Murillo Safa in 1955, when Kahlo's work sold for $400 a
painting. A recent auction of a Kahlo painting brought $3 million,
the highest amount ever paid for a work by a female artist.</TE>
<TE>   A private service will follow cremation today. The family said
President Vicente Fox had called to offer a homage at Mexico City's
Palace of Fine Arts, where the country's major cultural figures are
traditionally honored.</TE>

<HD>Louis Owens, 53; Native American Writer of Fiction,
Scholarly Works</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Louis Owens, a prize-winning novelist and scholar who wrote about
Native American life, died Thursday in Albuquerque of an apparently
self-inflicted gunshot wound. He was 53.</LD>
<LD>   The author of "The Bone Game," "Dark River," "The Sharpest Sight,"
"Wolfsong" and "Nightland," all works of fiction, apparently shot
himself in the chest at the Albuquerque airport early Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   He was taken to the University of New Mexico Hospital, where he
died Thursday afternoon, according to airport and hospital officials.</LD>
<TE>   At the time of the shooting, Owens was en route to Bellingham,
Wash., where he was scheduled to participate in a writing conference
for Native Americans.</TE>
<TE>   According to airport spokeswoman Maggie Santiago, a passenger
heard a shot, saw Owens slumped over and called police. A pistol was
found with him.</TE>
<TE>   "All the physical evidence indicated it was a self-inflicted
gunshot wound" and that nobody else was involved, Santiago said. A
note found with him asked that his wife, Polly, be notified, she
added.</TE>
<TE>   Owens, who was of Choctaw, Cherokee and Irish ancestry, had been a
front-line voice on American Indian literature.</TE>
<TE>   "I write, in part, to explore my own identity as a mixed-blood
American ...," he told Contemporary Authors a few years ago. "And I
write to explore the dilemmas of all mixed-bloods in America."</TE>
<TE>   He won a Wordcraft Circle Writer of the Year award in 1998 for
"Mixedblood Messages: Literature, Film, Family, Place." One of his
best-regarded works was "Other Destinies: Understanding the American
Indian Novel." He had won a National Endowment for the Arts Creative
Writing Fellowship in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   "As somebody of that generation, late 40s early 50s, he was just
galvanizing both in terms of his fiction and his criticism," said
University of New Mexico English professor Pat Smith, a Micmac
Indian. "He did that thing which is not usual for creative writers,
being known equally as a scholar and a creative writer."</TE>
<TE>   Owens also had been on the faculty at UC Davis. English professor
Jack Hicks, a colleague and one of his former teachers, described
Owens as "a person of real character--quiet, very dependable and very
generous with his time with students and faculty."</TE>
<TE>   "I would list him as the leading scholar on Native American
fiction in the country," Hicks said. Owens was born in Lompoc, Calif.
One of nine children of laborer parents, he grew up in poverty and
spent much of his childhood moving between Mississippi and
California.</TE>
<TE>   He had his first job at age 9 picking beans, an experience that
later would lead him to Steinbeck's classic novel "The Grapes of
Wrath." He wrote two critical works on Steinbeck--"The Grapes of
Wrath: Trouble in the Promised Land" and "John Steinbeck's Re-Vision
of America"--that have earned praise for their balanced assessment.</TE>
<TE>   He formed the idea for his first novel, "Wolfsong," when he
discovered plans for a copper strip-mining project in the heart of
Washington's Glacier Peak Wilderness area, where he had worked as a
ranger. Unable to interest environmental magazines in the story, he
decided to write a novel about the strip-mining plan from the
perspective of a young Native American whose ancestors had lived on
the mountain.</TE>
<TE>   As a novelist, he gained a reputation for skillfully merging
thriller-type plots with serious, universal themes.</TE>
<TE>   Owens, who earned his bachelor's and master's degrees from UC
Santa Barbara and his doctorate from UC Davis, also wrote "American
Indian Novelists: An annotated Critical Bibliography." He taught
English at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, before
returning in 2000 to UC Davis as a professor. He also had taught at
Cal State Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife, Owens is survived by his daughters
Elizabeth and Alexandra.</TE>

<HD>Clark Gesner, 64; Wrote 'Charlie Brown' Musical</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lyricist and composer Clark Gesner, who created the enduring musical
"You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown," has died. He was 64.</LD>
<LD>   Gesner died Tuesday, apparently of a heart attack, while visiting
the Princeton Club in downtown New York.</LD>
<LD>   The musical, which is little more than a series of vignettes
celebrating the big-hearted gang from the "Peanuts" cartoon strip,
was an immediate hit when it opened at a theater in Greenwich Village
in 1967.</LD>
<TE>   It ran for nearly 1,600 performances there and fostered several
national tours. It became a staple of high school, college and little
theater groups across the country.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Augusta, Maine, Gesner attended Princeton University and
was active in the Triangle Club, the university's theater group.
After graduation, he served in a special services unit in the U.S.
Army.</TE>
<TE>   After his discharge, Gesner found work in New York City as a
writer and composer for the "Captain Kangaroo" and "Mister Mayor"
television programs. He later wrote for "Sesame Street" and "The
Electric Company."</TE>
<TE>   While working on "Captain Kangaroo," Gesner started writing songs
inspired by the "Peanuts" strip, a personal favorite.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just a little private project--me and the songs and the
strip," Gesner told the St. Paul Pioneer Press in an interview in
2000. He initially saw the songs being collected on a record album.
But he ran into a roadblock dealing with United Features, which was
syndicating the strip for its creator, Charles M. Schulz.</TE>
<TE>   But after Gesner sent Schulz a tape containing several of the
songs, the cartoonist gave his approval for the project. Within a
year, Gesner's songs came out on an album, with performances by Orson
Bean as Charlie Brown and Gesner himself as Linus.</TE>
<TE>   Several months later, the play opened at Theater 80, a 179-seat
converted nightclub in the East Village. The 14-song show featured
Gary Burghoff--who would later achieve success as Radar O'Reilly on
"MASH"--as Charlie Brown and Bob Balaban as Linus. An immediate hit,
the show ran there for four years.</TE>
<TE>   From there it went to Broadway, where it was far less successful,

lasting 149 performances.</TE>
<TE>   His next stage effort, "The Utter Glory of Morrissey Hall," a

<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert Giard, 62, a portraitist who traveled the country to
photograph gay and lesbian literary figures, died July 16 of an
apparent heart attack while on a bus trip from Minneapolis to
Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   Giard took nearly 600 black and white photographs of gay writers.
He posed his subjects--who included Allen Ginsberg, Quentin Crisp and
Andrea Dworkin--in simple settings surrounded by things they loved.</LD>
<LD>   Giard was inspired to begin the project in 1985 after seeing "The
Normal Heart," Larry Kramer's play about the AIDS crisis. Many of his
photographs were included in the 1997 book "Particular Voices," which
was the basis for a New York Public Library exhibit.</LD>
<TE>   Born in Hartford, Conn., Giard earned degrees from Yale and Boston
University. He taught himself photography in the early 1970s.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Rudiger Dornbusch, 60, an economist noted for his research on the
theory of exchange rates and international economic policy, died
Thursday of cancer at his home in Washington, D.C.</LD>
<LD>   Dornbusch was a Ford Professor of Economics and International
Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</LD>
<LD>   In 27 years of teaching at MIT, he trained many international
economic policy scholars and practitioners. He was also a contributor
to Business Week magazine for many years.</LD>
<TE>   Dornbusch was widely acclaimed for his seminal research on the
theory of exchange rate determination and international economic
policy, and was especially well-known for his work on Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   In a paper published in the mid-1970s, Dornbusch showed that
shocks to a country's monetary policy could lead to larger exchange
rate movements in the short run than in the longer run.</TE>
<TE>   Until just a few weeks before his death, he remained actively
involved in analyzing economic policy in developing nations.</TE>
<TE>   The German-born Dornbusch earned a degree in political science
from the University of Geneva and a doctorate in economics from the
University of Chicago. He joined MIT in 1975 and became a full
professor in 1978.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Albert Whitmore, 102, the last known member of Australia's World War
I Light Horsemen cavalry, died Friday at a nursing home in Barmera,
South Australia.</LD>
<LD>   Whitmore enlisted in the Australian army to fight in World War I
when he was 17.</LD>
<LD>   Because of his farming background and natural ability with horses,
he was assigned as a reinforcement to the 9th Australian Light Horse
Brigade, which was operating in the Middle East.</LD>
<TE>   Whitmore served for nearly three years before returning to South
Australia in the fall of 1919. He reenlisted during World War II as a
staff sergeant with the army's engineers.</TE>
<TE>   The brave acts of the Light Horsemen were portrayed in Peter
Weir's 1980 film "Gallipoli."</TE>
<TE>   Australia's Veterans Affairs Minister Danna Vale called Whitmore's
death "the end of an era.... The Light Horsemen have grown to
legendary status for their deeds and daring, and Mr. Whitmore is a
part of that legend," Vale said Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Whitmore's death leaves 12 known Australian World War I veterans.</TE>

<HD>Bertelsmann Fires CEO in Board Dispute</HD>
<DH>Media: The battle centered on Thomas Middelhoff's
insistence on taking the German firm public, sources say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHUCK PHILIPS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>German media giant Bertelsmann ousted Chairman and Chief Executive
Thomas Middelhoff on Sunday, following a showdown between the
49-year-old executive and the company's supervisory board.</LD>
<LD>   Middelhoff is the latest media baron to lose his job as the
world's largest entertainment conglomerates come under increasing
shareholder scrutiny. AOL Time Warner Inc. Chief Operating Officer
Robert W. Pittman and Vivendi Universal Chief Executive Jean-Marie
Messier both resigned under pressure this month.</LD>
<LD>   A simmering, behind-the-scenes battle between Middelhoff and
Bertelsmann's largest shareholders, the powerful Mohn family, erupted
late last week, prompting his sudden departure. The dispute, sources
close to the company said, centered around Middelhoff's insistence on
taking the company public.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. executives at Bertelsmann were stunned Sunday morning when
they received a faxed statement from the corporation's Guetersloh,
Germany, headquarters informing them that Middelhoff was out.</TE>
<TE>   "Thomas Middelhoff will leave the company," the statement said.
"The separation resulted from differences of opinion between the
chairman and the supervisory board on the future strategy of
Bertelsmann AG."</TE>
<TE>   Middelhoff, who sources say was notified of the decision early
Sunday, could not be reached for comment. He had more than two years
left on his contract and, as late as Friday, sources say, never
uttered a word about stepping down.</TE>
<TE>   During his rocky, four-year tenure as Bertelsmann's chairman and
CEO, Middelhoff transformed the stodgy, conservative corporation into
a flashy media group--the fifth-largest in the world with $20 billion
in annual sales.</TE>
<TE>   While Bertelsmann has been hit hard by the advertising slump,
analysts note that it is hard to determine the exact financial status
of the privately held German group. Unlike other media companies,
however, Bertelsmann is believed to be debt-free, with $7 billion in
cash for future acquisitions, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Bertelsmann's holdings include Random House, the world's biggest
publishing company; RTL Group, Europe's largest TV operation; and
BMG, the New York-based home to such music acts as OutKast, Elvis
Presley and Dave Matthews Band.</TE>
<TE>   Joining the company in 1986 as a manager in its Mohndruk division,
Middelhoff rose to power during the Internet revolution after
persuading Bertelsmann to buy a stake in AOL Europe during the
mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Bertelsmann then made a killing by selling its AOL stake for $9
billion before Internet stock prices crashed in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   During his reign, Middelhoff also bought publishing giant Random
House and control of television giant RTL--both profitable ventures
for Bertelsmann.</TE>
<TE>   But Middelhoff's moves into the music business have been less
successful.</TE>
<TE>   Breaking ranks with Bertelsmann's music executives and his four
biggest music competitors two years ago, Middelhoff joined forces
with Napster Inc. and sank millions of dollars into developing a
legal version of the popular file-sharing system, which was declared
illegal and shut down by a federal court.</TE>
<TE>   As late as two weeks ago, Middelhoff was championing Napster
technology as the solution for distributing music, books and other
forms of entertainment in the digital future.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, he failed in his bid to merge BMG with British music
giant EMI Group after European regulators nixed the deal on antitrust
grounds.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Middelhoff's efforts to clean up Bertelsmann's
music division has been slow going, even after he fired the previous
management team.</TE>
<TE>   Among other issues, the company will be required later this year
to buy Zomba Music Group for $3 billion because of a controversial
transaction initiated by former managers.</TE>
<TE>   With the promise of online profits disappearing and stock prices
tumbling for media companies such as AOL Time Warner and Vivendi
Universal, conservative shareholders at Bertelsmann began to balk at
Middelhoff's plan to seek a stock market listing--an integral factor
in his long-term strategic vision.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Bertelsmann opened the way for a public offering by
trading 25% of its shares with Belgian investment house Groupe
Bruxelles Lambert for a stake giving it control of RTL.</TE>
<TE>   Under the deal, GBL had the right to sell its stake in an initial
public offering by 2005.</TE>
<TE>   But with the current market uncertainty, the proposed stock market
listing probably will be delayed.</TE>
<TE>   Sources say a few members of Bertelsmann's supervisory board were
upset about Middelhoff's plans and persuaded Rheinhard Mohn and his
family, the firm's controlling shareholders, to remove Middelhoff
from power.</TE>
<TE>   Middelhoff will be replaced by Gunter Thielen, 59, a member of the
executive board who had been expected leave the company.</TE>
<TE>   There have been unconfirmed reports in German newspapers that
Middelhoff has been offered the top job at Deutsche Telekom.</TE>

<HD>Arab Countries Boycott U.S. Goods Over Mideast Policies</HD>
<DH>Economy: An Iranian beverage company has benefited from a
campaign directed at Coca-Cola and McDonald's, which has hurt
businesses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BASSEM MROUE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates</DL>
<LD>Zamzam Cola has new customers in the Persian Gulf and plans to expand
soon into more Arab markets. The Iranian company can indirectly thank
Israel for its growth.</LD>
<LD>   Zamzam, which previously exported only to Iraq and Afghanistan, is
benefiting from a grass-roots campaign by Arabs and other Muslims to
boycott American goods over U.S. backing for Israel. Set off by the
latest Palestinian uprising, the boycott is especially directed at
well-known American products such as Coca-Cola and McDonald's.</LD>
<LD>   "After Arab countries in the region started boycotting some
American goods, including Coca, demand for Zamzam began," said Bahram
Kheiri, director of the Iranian beverage company.</LD>
<TE>   He wouldn't give sales figures, but said Zamzam has started
exporting to Bahrain and is discussing orders with companies in the
United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan,
Egypt and Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   Zamzam is sweeter than Coke and has a built-in appeal for Muslims
because it takes its name from a holy spring in Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   The boycott is being urged across the Middle East and North Africa
by Muslim preachers, students, intellectuals and--in Saudi Arabia, a
main U.S. ally--even some advisors to the Saudi king. The appeal is
delivered in mosque sermons, leaflets and Internet sites.</TE>
<TE>   It's difficult to say how hard the boycott is hitting American
companies or Arab-owned businesses selling U.S. products.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the six McDonald's franchises in Jordan have closed for
lack of business--one in the capital, Amman, and one near a
Palestinian refugee camp.</TE>
<TE>   In Morocco, a government official who asked not to be identified,
estimated sales of Coca-Cola could fall by half in the country's
north, a base for Islamic groups. In the United Arab Emirates, sales
of the local Star Cola are up 40% in the last three months.</TE>
<TE>   In Dubai, business appears to be down at such American fast food
chains as McDonald's, KFC and Hardee's and up at local restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   In Saudi Arabia, prices have been cut up to 50% on some U.S.
imports, and ads for U.S.-linked fast food outlets point out they are
owned and managed by Arabs.</TE>
<TE>   A respected Muslim cleric in the Persian Gulf state of Qatar,
Sheik Youssef al-Qaradawi, issued a religious ruling saying American
products should be viewed like Israeli products, which have long been
banned in the Arab world.</TE>
<TE>   In Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, mosque preacher Sheik Omar bin Saeed
al-Badna argued the boycott would be good for the kingdom's economy.</TE>
<TE>   "Boycotting American food and drinks means more business for
Saudi, Lebanese and other restaurants, as well as local producers of
soft drinks. This will be good for the majority of Saudis," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The boycott is not that simple, economists and government
officials say. They say it harms local businesses, franchisees and
employees while it has little effect on parent companies in the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the companies that people consider American are
multinational and those who own them are Arabs," said Suleiman
al-Mazrouei, an economist at Emirates International Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Coca-Cola executives said Coke's Middle East operations are run by
Arab workers and managers and it gets materials from local suppliers.</TE>
<TE>   "We, for example, have a bottling partner in the Palestinian
Authority area that employs about 320 people. So we are one of the
largest employers in the Palestinian Authority area," said Steve
LeRoy, Coke's communications director for central Europe, Eurasia and
the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   LeRoy said Coke sales had been affected by the boycott but refused
to say how much. The international headquarters of McDonald's and
Hardee's did not respond to repeated requests for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Samer Tawil, director general of Jordan's Ministry of Trade and
Industry, said the effect of the boycott spreads beyond boycotted
companies to their workers--who could lose jobs -- and to their
investors, who in Jordan are mostly Jordanians.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the boycott say its advocates are proposing a simple
answer to a complex problem.</TE>
<TE>   Jordanian economist Fahd Fanek said Arabs who find it easy to
boycott American soft drinks and fast food probably would balk at
doing without "American medicines, airplanes and the Internet" as
well as American college education for their children.</TE>
<TE>   One backer of the boycott is Lebanon's Grand Ayatollah Mohammed
Hussein Fadlallah, who had his U.S. assets frozen in 1995 as part of
an anti-terrorism campaign because he wielded influence over
Hezbollah, a militant anti-Israeli group considered a terrorist
organization by Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Fadlallah has issued a religious edict urging a boycott of U.S.
goods but acknowledges the weapon is imperfect.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with the Associated Press, he said exceptions to
the boycott could be made for necessities and U.S.-made products that
cannot be replaced with goods from other countries.</TE>
<TE>   He listed one such exception as buying and selling the U.S.
dollar, noting: "Lebanon's economy is based on the dollar."</TE>

<DH>Local coffee roaster plans push into bigger markets</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELINDA FULMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's no shortage of stories about Starbucks moving into a
neighborhood and putting a mom-and-pop shop out of business.</LD>
<LD>   What's harder to find is someone like coffee roaster Pedro Gavina,
president of Vernon-based F. Gavina &amp; Sons Inc., who thinks the
Seattle-based giant has been good for his business.</LD>
<LD>   Starbucks Corp.'s rapid expansion in the 1990s, while felling many
smaller merchants, stirred a huge appetite for gourmet coffee among
middle-class Americans. That has helped F. Gavina move its gourmet
beans into more mainstream supermarkets across California and the
West.</LD>
<TE>   "They've created an awareness of quality coffee, and that's good
for everyone," Gavina, a Cuban immigrant, said of Starbucks.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles-area grocery stores, F. Gavina's Don Francisco
brand has become the No. 1 whole bean coffee, largely on its
consistent quality and somewhat cheaper price. The company has 37% of
the area's supermarket coffee bean sales, eclipsing Starbucks' 29%
share, according to Information Resources Inc.</TE>
<TE>   F. Gavina's ground coffee is ranked No. 3 locally, behind
stalwarts Procter &amp; Gamble Co.'s Folgers and Kraft Foods Inc.'s
Maxwell House, but still one notch ahead of Starbucks, which is
distributed to supermarkets by Kraft.</TE>
<TE>   Now, buoyed by its local popularity, F. Gavina is planning to take
on some of these coffee giants in supermarkets along the East Coast.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said that's a risky move for a family-run company of 250
employees that rarely advertises, eschews rigid corporate structure
and prides itself on being as responsive to a small Armenian bakery
as it is to a large client such as Safeway Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Taking on Starbucks in your backyard is one thing, analysts said,
but competing with it and other nationally recognized supermarket
brands such as Millstone along both coasts is quite another,
especially for a company as small as F. Gavina.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the really strong brands that are gaining market share" in
supermarkets, said Kristine Koerber, a beverage analyst with WR
Hambrecht in San Francisco. "Companies really need to have a
differentiated product," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, without its own coffee shops, like those of Peet's
Coffee &amp; Tea Inc. and Starbucks, F. Gavina will need to do a lot more
advertising, which could be costly, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the company has enjoyed some heady economic times
recently as wholesale coffee prices have dropped 80% from their peak
in 1997, many of its larger competitors, such as Procter &amp; Gamble and
Kraft, have benefited even more. Those larger rivals have begun
plowing profits into their faster-growing gourmet coffee brands.</TE>
<TE>   Specialty coffee sales last year were estimated at $10.7 billion,
up from $7.6 billion in 2000, with the bulk of the coffee being
consumed at cafes and coffeehouses.</TE>
<TE>   But sales to supermarkets have been growing quickly as well, as
gourmet coffee has gone from an occasional indulgence to a staple in
many households.</TE>
<TE>   F. Gavina buys green coffee beans from around the world, roasts
them and sells them to coffee shops, restaurants, hotels and
supermarkets.</TE>
<TE>   Its sales--almost $70 million last year--are just a fraction of
rivals' such as Torrance-based Farmer Bros. Co., which supplies
restaurants, food-service accounts and Starbucks, but larger than
many of the regional roasters.</TE>
<TE>   The company is moving into a new 237,000-square-foot plant just
blocks from its current location, which will allow it to double its
roasting capacity to 20,000 pounds of beans an hour and take Don
Francisco into new markets in the Northeast.</TE>
<TE>   Although making such a big leap in production may be daunting,
Gavina said, his family's company must keep growing if it wants to
hold on to business from big supermarket chains that have grown
rapidly through acquisitions in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   "They like to have a national program. You have to be active,"
Gavina said. "You can't fall asleep and say, 'I'm comfortable here.'
"</TE>
<TE>   The company has been able to move into markets such as Nevada,
Arizona, New York, New Mexico and Florida largely on the strength of
big institutional clients such as McDonald's Corp. and accounts with
large supermarket chains.</TE>
<TE>   Now, it is hoping to use some of its relationships to get a
toehold in other markets on the East Coast.</TE>
<TE>   "From the very beginning, they've worked harder than anybody else
in the industry, and now they're seeing real success because of it,"
said James Lingle, president of Lingle Bros. Coffee, a rival roasting
company in Bell Gardens. "They have been very clever in going after
particular niches they could serve well and profitably."</TE>
<TE>   In the beginning, that meant F. Gavina had to peddle its signature
espresso coffee to mom-and-pop businesses such as Italian
restaurants, Caribbean markets, Armenian bakeries and Vietnamese
noodle shops.</TE>
<TE>   But over the years, the company's product line has grown to dozens
of coffees from South and Central America, Africa, Indonesia and
Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   Its customer base has expanded to include McDonald's stores in the
West and Costco Wholesale Corp. stores in Southern California. Even
restaurateur Wolfgang Puck is a customer.</TE>
<TE>   The company also has moved into a lucrative niche of providing
special blends and flavored coffee to its larger competitors, such as
Farmer Bros. and Sara Lee Corp.'s Chock Full O' Nuts.</TE>
<TE>   Covering the Bases</TE>
<TE>   "The hallmark of Gavina is its diversification," said Mike
Ferguson of the Specialty Coffee Assn., a trade group based in Long
Beach. "There are very few businesses to which they are not prepared
to cater."</TE>
<TE>   The company supplies its customers from its roasting plant in
Vernon, a sprawling maze of older warehouses filled wall to wall with
huge roasters, grinding equipment, machines that coat coffee beans
with flavoring and a packaging line.</TE>
<TE>   Its Internet order department is composed of a couple of
hairnet-clad women working at a table with packaging materials and a
shelf stacked with F. Gavina's goods.</TE>
<TE>   The company's top managers and sales staff moved to the new plant
in May. Its roasting operations are scheduled to move by year's end.</TE>
<TE>   In this glossy new facility, the lobby is bigger than the
management offices at the old plant. And its glassed-in cupping room,
where Gavina and one of the company's top managers sample the green
coffee beans the company buys from around the world, takes center
stage.</TE>
<TE>   The Gavinas' roots in the coffee business go back to the late 19th
century, when Pedro's grandfather and his brother started a coffee
plantation, Hacienda Buenos Aires, in the mountains of southern Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   Pedro, his sister, Leonor, and brothers Jose and Francisco, also
known as "Paco," grew up on the plantation but left with their
father, Francisco, in 1960 after Fidel Castro seized the property.</TE>
<TE>   The family went from Spain to Florida and then California, where
it saved enough to buy some old coffee roasting equipment from Farmer
Bros. The brothers sold coffee during the day and worked nights as
bartenders or waiters to pay the bills.</TE>
<TE>   By 1970, they were able to sell enough espresso to small
businesses--mostly ethnic markets and restaurants--to make coffee
roasting a full-time business. Leonor worked in the office while her
older brothers made sales calls, peddling a product then unfamiliar
to many in the food business.</TE>
<TE>   "You would say cappuccino or espresso and they would just look at
you," Leonor Gavina-Valls recalled. "It was just unheard of at that
time."</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1980s, the company began moving into the specialty
coffee business, selling beans to the coffeehouses springing up in
the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   It was about this time that the elder Francisco's children took
charge of the company. The four siblings share ownership.</TE>
<TE>   Leonor handles marketing, Jose is in charge of sales, Pedro is
president and oversees coffee bean sourcing and sampling and Paco,
the eldest and a civil engineer, is operations manager in charge of
the plant.</TE>
<TE>   The second generation's mark on the business was the creation of
the Don Francisco line of gourmet coffee for supermarkets in the
mid-1980s. The brand makes up about 40% of the company's business and
will account for much of its growth.</TE>
<TE>   With gourmet beans pushing out cheaper, light-roast coffee, the
siblings see an opportunity to get Don Francisco into markets all
along the East Coast--from Florida, where it already sells its
coffee, to Maryland and eventually Boston and Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Supermarket chains like carrying gourmet coffee because customers
are willing to pay more for it and because aficionados tend to drink
more coffee. But analyst Koerber said the supermarket coffee aisle is
getting more competitive.</TE>
<TE>   Companies such as Procter &amp; Gamble and Kraft have begun cutting
corners, using lower-quality robusta instead of arabica beans in
their old-line ground coffees, and have invested more of their
resources in faster-selling gourmet lines that compete with F.
Gavina.</TE>
<TE>   Changes Needed</TE>
<TE>   Small-business experts said that if a company like F. Gavina is
going to compete with much larger firms, it will need to be managed
less like a family enterprise and more like a corporation, with a
more rigid structure, regular meetings and a bigger investment in
advertising and branding.</TE>
<TE>   Now, most of its advertising is word-of-mouth, meetings are
handled on the fly and only recently have Leonor, Pedro and other top
managers begun using e-mail regularly to communicate with employees.</TE>
<TE>   As the company aims to double production in the next few years and
move into new areas, it eventually will bring in a professional
manager, Pedro said. The family also plans to give top managers a
chance to buy stock in the company, because much of the third
generation is still too young or has little interest in managing the
company.</TE>
<TE>   Despite these challenges, many believe that F. Gavina can handle
this kind of growth and compete with the nation's large roasters.</TE>
<TE>   "Their quality is good. Their price is reasonable," said Beatriz
Porto of Porto's Bakery in Glendale, an F. Gavina customer. And, she
said, "they know what they're doing. [Coffee] is not a fad with
them."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, as an independent operator, Porto said, she's a little
biased.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate Starbucks," she said with a chuckle.</TE>

<HD>EchoStar Deal Faces Antitrust Hurdles</HD>
<DH>Mergers: The proposed purchase of DirecTV parent Hughes
would result in a monopoly in many rural areas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In more ways than one, time may be running out for the proposed
satellite merger between EchoStar Communications Corp. and DirecTV's
parent, Hughes Electronics Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, the Federal Communications Commission restarted its
merger countdown clock, vowing to decide by early November whether
the deal serves the public's interest. The agency had stopped its
self-imposed clock in March, saying EchoStar failed to provide
requested documents.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, the Justice Department has hinted it might make a
preliminary decision as early as September.</LD>
<TE>   But prevailing opinion in Washington is that antitrust
regulators--even in a Republican administration with a hands-off
approach--will be hard-pressed to accept a merger that combines the
No. 1 and No. 2 satellite providers and gives the new company a
monopoly in many rural markets. Nationwide, the merged entity would
control 90% of the satellite television market.</TE>
<TE>   For FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell and the Justice Department's
antitrust chief, Charles James, the deal will be the first major test
of how the Bush administration implements its deregulatory agenda in
the telecommunications industry.</TE>
<TE>   "This is new terrain for the Bush administration," said Gene
Kimmelman, executive director of Consumers Union in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The recent corporate accounting scandals have thrown a new wild
card in the mix. Under fire for being too closely aligned to business
interests, the Bush administration risks a firestorm of criticism if
it permits the merger to go through, one lawmaker said.</TE>
<TE>   "Prospects for the merger have become more daunting in the last
several months because of the corporate scandals that have arisen,"
said Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles), who has come out against
the merger because he fears that it would harm rural and Latino TV
viewers. "There's going to be a higher level of scrutiny because of
the message this merger sends."</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar officials say they remain optimistic about closing a deal
by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "The merger is on course," said EchoStar spokesman Marc Lumpkin.
"We are confident that [regulators] will approve it."</TE>
<TE>   The Littleton, Colo.-based company is arguing that the merger
would enable it to become a strong competitor against cable companies
by offering more local channels in more markets and high-speed
Internet access.</TE>
<TE>   But since the deal was announced in October, dozens of members of
Congress--particularly in rural states--have urged regulators to
block the merger.</TE>
<TE>   And the National Assn. of Broadcasters, the National Rural
Telecommunications Cooperative and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. are
lobbying against it. Murdoch had hoped to buy DirecTV until EchoStar
moved in at the last minute.</TE>
<TE>   Doubt on Wall Street</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street appears to be betting against the deal. Shares in
Hughes Electronics, a unit of General Motors Corp., are trading well
below the price EchoStar is offering to pay. Hughes Electronics
shares closed Friday up 27 cents at $9.24 on the New York Stock
Exchange, about 20% less than the implied price offered by EchoStar's
proposed stock swap. EchoStar closed Friday up 21 cents at $15.09 on
Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe EchoStar has made little headway in its efforts to get
approval," Salomon Smith Barney analyst Armand Musey said in a recent
report. "We do not think regulators will find EchoStar's
concessions--mainly the guarantees of national pricing policy and
local service for all markets--sufficiently compelling to outweigh
the potential negative impacts of lost competition."</TE>
<TE>   Mergers between the two largest players in the same business are
frowned on under standard antitrust theory unless one of the
companies is in financial peril.</TE>
<TE>   "It's way over the line by any antitrust measure," said Scott
Cleland, regulatory analyst and chief executive of Precursor Group in
Washington. "If they approved this merger, it would open the
floodgates in every other industry."</TE>
<TE>   Even if regulators accepted the argument that satellite TV
providers should be viewed as competitors to cable, the merger would
reduce the number of pay-TV players in most U.S. markets from three
(EchoStar, DirecTV and the local cable provider) to two.</TE>
<TE>   In most rural markets that don't offer cable, the choices would
drop from two to one.</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar is trying to persuade regulators to make an exception,
arguing that the merger would enable it to become a much stronger
competitor to cable providers, resulting in lower prices and more
services for all pay-TV customers.</TE>
<TE>   For example, EchoStar offers only local channels in 40 of the
nation's 210 markets and does not offer high-speed Internet access.
Cable offers both, and thereby has a competitive advantage, Lumpkin
said. Without the merger, EchoStar said it does not have enough
bandwidth to offer all local channels and Internet service.</TE>
<TE>   Concerns at FCC</TE>
<TE>   Regulators have expressed some skepticism. Powell and FCC media
bureau chief W. Kenneth Ferree have said the merger raises
"significant" concerns. Ferree said last fall that the merger would
"close the door on any future competitor."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, promises to offer local channels, fixed national
pricing and Internet access may be a tough sell at the FCC, which
recently chided EchoStar for its history of "disingenuous behavior
and lack of candor" in dealings with the agency.</TE>
<TE>   But even if the merger is scrapped, EchoStar and its CEO, Charles
Ergen, come out winners. EchoStar got a peek at the books of its main
rival, which has been left in limbo since October. With the
distractions of a pending merger, DirecTV has had difficulty keeping
and attracting good employees and pursuing long-term strategies,
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, EchoStar has aggressively moved into DirecTV's turf,
offering its dishes in RadioShack Corp. stores and, soon, Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. locations.</TE>
<TE>   And Ergen has prevented DirecTV from falling into the hands of
News Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "Ergen wins even if the government says no," Cleland said.</TE>
<TE>   DirecTV spokesman George Jamison denied that the company has been
distracted or lost key people.</TE>
<TE>   "And due diligence is a two-way street," Jamison said. "Everything
EchoStar has seen about our business, we've seen about theirs."</TE>
<TE>   Some EchoStar critics suggested that the company realizes that
prospects for merger approval are slim and is merely trying to drag
out the process to prevent DirecTV from moving on. They point to
EchoStar's delay this spring in providing documents to the FCC.</TE>
<TE>   "Ergen can be quite happy that for at least a year, he didn't have
a competitor and kept DirecTV out of the hands of someone who would
operate it as a strong competitor," said Lloyd Constantine, an
attorney at Constantine and Partners in New York, which News Corp.
has hired to help it kill the deal.</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar's Lumpkin denies the company has any incentive to slow
down the pace.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always said we expected the approval process to last as
long as a year," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear whether News Corp. would still want to buy DirecTV if
the EchoStar deal collapses.</TE>
<TE>   But the entertainment giant is nevertheless fighting behind the
scenes to gin up opposition among religious broadcasters, lobbying
state attorneys general and meeting Justice Department officials.</TE>
<TE>   Constantine said several states are preparing to block the merger
even if the Justice Department approves it.</TE>

<HD>Pump Prices Rise Nearly 2 Cents</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a flat summer, gasoline prices edged up nearly 2 cents a gallon
in the last two weeks, an industry analyst said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "The low and very, very stable prices throughout the summer did
have to end some time," Trilby Lundberg said. "What we have is a
closer balance between supply and demand and continued crude oil
price strengths."</LD>
<LD>   Despite increased summer driving, supplies remained plentiful,
Lundberg said.</LD>
<TE>   "Considering the extremely low prices of the whole summer, this is
not an indicator of great price hikes to come ... or a gasoline
shortage," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The national price of gas at the pump averaged about $1.46 a
gallon Friday, according to the Lundberg survey of 8,000 stations.
That was up 1.68 cents from July 12.</TE>
<TE>   The average had hovered within a few pennies of that range since
peaking at $1.46 in early April.</TE>
<TE>   Most regions of the country saw a price hike, although the West,
where prices already were higher, averaged a drop of about a penny
per gallon, Lundberg said.</TE>

<HD>Japanese Production Falls in June</HD>
<DH>Economy: Although the stronger yen is hurting exporters,
analysts say manufacturers should bounce back from drop.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Japanese factory production fell for the first time in five months in
June, a sign the recovery may slow as the U.S. economy cools and the
rising yen makes it harder for exporters to compete with overseas
rivals.</LD>
<LD>   Production fell 0.7% from May, seasonally adjusted, the government
said. Economists expected a 0.5% decline. A 4.1% rise in May fueled a
3.6% gain last quarter, the biggest quarterly increase in 15 years.</LD>
<LD>   Sony Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd. last week cut their sales forecasts
for this fiscal year, citing slower-than-expected growth in the U.S.
and the stronger yen, which has rallied 11% this year. That threatens
to snuff out Japan's recovery from last year's recession.</LD>
<TE>   "If the engine that's been firing Japan's exports slows from 60
kilometers an hour to 10 kilometers an hour, that's going to hurt
Japan," said Tetsuhide Mikamo, the chief economist at Marubeni
Research Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Manufacturers are confident they will bounce from last month's
decline, forecasting production will rise 1.6% this month and a
further 1.8% next month, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The outlook is still good," said Tatsuya Torikoshi, a senior
economist at Daiwa Institute of Research Ltd.</TE>
<TE>   Toshiba Ltd. and Hitachi Ltd. will give workers fewer days off
this year than last as they step up production of chips to meet
overseas demand.</TE>
<TE>   Hitachi, Japan's third-biggest chip maker, will keep its three
semiconductor factories running through August, when many Japanese
workers take their summer vacation.</TE>
<TE>   Toshiba will give workers six days off, less than half the 14 they
had planned.</TE>
<TE>   Shipments fell 2.2% last month from May, the report showed.
Inventories fell 1.7% to the lowest since December 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "The inventory adjustment is proceeding and production is
gradually increasing," the ministry said. "But there is still
uncertainty about final demand."</TE>

<HD>Brands Seek to Knock Off Counterfeiters</HD>
<DH>Trademarks: Corporate logo owners are taking software
makers to court over programs that benefit bootleggers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Coca-Cola Co., Nike Inc. and other corporate logo owners are joining
together to combat what they say is the latest and most dangerous
threat to their famous brands.</LD>
<LD>   Software programs are being sold over the Internet that can be
used to instruct machines to etch onto glass or vinyl, or stitch onto
clothing perfect copies of Coca-Cola's contour bottle, the Nike
swoosh or Walt Disney Co.'s Mickey Mouse.</LD>
<LD>   The trademark owners have used letters, threats and the courts to
try to protect their brands from bootleggers. The new software
programs are potentially more devastating because they allow
counterfeiters to distribute perfect copies of logos anywhere in the
world.</LD>
<TE>   "There's no doubt in my mind that these seedy logo cases are
starting to crop up," said Frederick Mostert, author of "Famous and
Well-Known Marks" and former president of the International Trademark
Assn. "That's the fallout where technology is enormously beneficial
to society, but there's also a price to pay."</TE>
<TE>   Disney, Nike, Coca-Cola and companies such as Polo Ralph Lauren
Corp., Levi Strauss &amp; Co., Toyota Motor Corp., AOL Time Warner Inc.
and BP are pursuing a novel legal strategy and have sued one of the
software makers they say is responsible for the new crop of
knockoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The federal lawsuit was filed in May in Orlando, Fla., against
Rick Hedrick and his company, Zmax Digital Graphics Systems Inc. The
suit does not accuse Hedrick of making or selling counterfeit
merchandise, rather it accuses Hedrick of creating software that
contains perfect copies of logos and instructs machines how to put
the logos onto products. The lawsuit is believed to be one of the
first of its kind.</TE>
<TE>   The suit is similar to those brought against landlords of flea
markets whose tenants sell knockoffs, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Hedrick gives his clients a choice--they can either download logos
directly from one of several Web sites, or buy a CD-ROM that can be
delivered anywhere, according to his sites and the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually, counterfeiters sell the product that bears the
trademark," Mostert said. "Here, what you're selling is just the
trademark, the brand name itself."</TE>
<TE>   Other software makers sell logos. They can be used legally by
small retailers to create advertisements for sales, or by
publications that are writing about a product.</TE>
<TE>   The difference between those software makers and ones like
Hedrick, according to the suit, is that his software is being used
for illicit purposes, and he didn't do anything to stop it even after
repeated warnings from logo owners.</TE>
<TE>   "People shouldn't be allowed to put their head in the sand when
they know illegal activity is going on," said Tim Trainer, president
of the International AntiCounterfeiting Coalition.</TE>
<TE>   There are no reliable figures for counterfeit products sold in the
U.S. each year. The International Chamber of Commerce has estimated
that as much as 7% of global trade is in bogus goods from copyright
and trademark infringements. The anti-counterfeiting group has said
trademark infringement drains about $200 billion a year from the U.S.
economy.</TE>
<TE>   The Web "has made copying so much easier, faster, instantaneous
and perfect, as the proliferation of counterfeiting on the Internet
has demonstrated," Mostert said.</TE>
<TE>   With the Internet, counterfeiters can go to a company's Web site,
download or otherwise copy digital images of the famous marks, and
duplicate them for use in bogus merchandise.</TE>
<TE>   The software program containing the images can then be multiplied
on thousands of CD-ROMs and shipped around the world, trademark
lawyers said.</TE>
<TE>   For years, bootleggers have transported unlabeled counterfeit
products across borders without interference, attaching bogus logos
after passing through customs.</TE>
<TE>   The software makes it easier, and the logos are of a higher
quality because they are digital images.</TE>
<TE>   It's the perfection of the image that makes software such as
Hedrick's so pernicious, companies say. Counterfeit T-shirts often
include steamed transfer images that are handmade and amateurish
enough that any average consumer can tell it's a knockoff.</TE>
<TE>   With digital images, it's impossible to tell the difference from a
phony picture of Coca-Cola's contour bottle and "The Real Thing."</TE>
<TE>   "The Coca-Cola Co. owns some of the world's most valuable
trademarks, and we protect them aggressively," said company
spokeswoman Kari Bjorhus. "We do not tolerate infringers or those who
enable others to infringe."</TE>
<TE>   Attempts to reach Hedrick by e-mail were unsuccessful. Coca-Cola,
Disney and their fellow logo owners didn't have much luck either.</TE>
<TE>   According to their suit, they've pursued Hedrick for at least two
years, and court documents show he isn't making it easy for them to
deliver to him a copy of the suit.</TE>
<TE>   Still, several trademark owners say this lawsuit may set an
example for other cases--either in warning would-be knockoff artists
or giving them ideas.</TE>
<TE>   "This potentially could have huge implications whichever way it
goes," Mostert said.</TE>

<HD>NASD Proposes New Rules on IPO Allocations</HD>
<DH>Securities: Brokerage group is seeking to ban some
practices by the investment banks that handle stock offerings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The National Assn. of Securities Dealers approved rules that would
ban some of the ways investment banks allot shares of initial public
offerings, such as parceling them out in exchange for inflated
commissions.</LD>
<LD>   The rules, which require the approval of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, would also prohibit firms from distributing IPO
shares to a company's executives in return for future
investment-banking business, and from penalizing small investors for
selling shares in an IPO shortly after its debut while institutional
investors aren't penalized for the same actions.</LD>
<LD>   The NASD is putting forward the measures six months after
regulators fined Credit Suisse First Boston $100 million for some of
its IPO practices in 1999 and 2000. The proposals also come as U.S.
stock exchanges and Congress draft new securities, accounting and
corporate board regulations in a bid to restore investor confidence
after a spate of corporate fraud scandals.</LD>
<TE>   "This is part of the reaction to secure the barn door after the
horse is gone," said Roy Smith, professor of investment banking at
New York University. "They didn't pick this up yesterday afternoon.
We've known about this business of allocating IPOs to potential or
favored customers for a long time."</TE>
<TE>   News reports first appeared in 1997 about the practice of
"spinning," or allocating shares in an IPO to the personal brokerage
account of a corporate or venture-capital executive and selling them
the same day or the next day for a quick profit. The practice is an
attempt to win future business from the executive's company.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Level 3 Communications Inc. Chief Executive
James Crowe said an investment bank that did business with the
fiber-optic network operator bought and sold shares for him in an
initial stock offering without his knowledge. Crowe, who didn't name
the investment bank, said he voided the transaction as soon as he
learned of it.</TE>
<TE>   Crowe's statement came in response to a lawsuit filed by former
Salomon Smith Barney Inc. broker David Chacon. The suit alleges that
Salomon rewarded top officers of telecommunication investment-banking
clients, including Crowe and WorldCom Inc.'s former chief executive,
Bernard J. Ebbers, with thousands of shares in IPOs underwritten by
the firm.</TE>
<TE>   The NASD's new rules would require investment banks to file
information regarding company executives and board directors who
receive shares in IPOs. The information would be available to
regulators, though not to the public.</TE>
<TE>   The regulations are intended to "signal clearly to the industry
what our concerns are," NASD Chairman Robert Glauber told reporters
on a conference call Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "We [already] have on the books the kind of rules we need" to
bring a case when IPO practices are abusive, Glauber said, citing the
Credit Suisse First Boston charges and "half a dozen" ongoing
investigations.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Credit Suisse agreed to pay the fifth-largest penalty
ever imposed by U.S. regulators to settle allegations that it charged
commissions of as much as $3.15 a share, compared with a typical rate
of 6 cents a share, in exchange for giving out shares in skyrocketing
IPOs.</TE>
<TE>   One difference the proposed rules would make is in the way
individual investors are treated. Previously, the NASD had permitted
securities firms to punish brokers whose retail customers sold shares
in an IPO shortly after they received it by taking away the
commission they earned, while not penalizing brokers with
institutional clients who did the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   Now the NASD is saying "as a class the individual investor may not
be treated indirectly differently from institutional investors," said
Mary Shapiro, who heads the NASD's enforcement division.</TE>
<TE>   The proposals come two years after what Smith called "the hottest
IPO market ever, which provoked the abuses." Back then, "you had
lunatic conditions that bid these things up three or four times in
the first day," he said. "You're not going to see that any time
soon."</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, investment banks arranged $99.8 billion of initial stock
sales in the U.S., according to Bloomberg data. So far this year
they've handled $26.2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The NASD will require its member firms to adopt procedures
ensuring that its new rules are followed.</TE>
<TE>   The NASD's rules follow proposals by the Nasdaq Stock Market and
the New York Stock Exchange aimed at reducing conflicts of interest
on corporate boards and legislation in Congress increasing penalties
for corporate fraud. The legislation comes after accounting
irregularities at Enron Corp. and WorldCom led the companies to file
for bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Taking Aim at IPO Practices</TE>
<TE>   The National Assn. of Securities Dealers rules, which must be
submitted for a period of public comment and approved by the
Securities and Exchange Commission before they go into effect, bar:</TE>
<TE>   * Quid pro quo agreements, in which initial public offering shares
are allocated in exchange for "excessive compensation relative to the
service provided by" the investment bank. That includes commissions.</TE>
<TE>   * Aftermarket agreements, in which investment banks require
investors who get an IPO to put in orders for additional shares once
the IPO begins trading or otherwise support the IPO once it starts
trading.</TE>
<TE>   * Spinning, in which investment banks allocate shares in exchange
for future or past business.</TE>
<TE>   * Discriminatory treatment of small investors who "flip," or sell
IPOs shortly after they debut for a quick profit.</TE>

<HD>Virtual Real Estate Is a Buyer's Market</HD>
<DH>Internet: In a switch from the Web's early days, the number
of domain names and their prices have fallen. Thousands are at
bargain rates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. HUFFSTUTTER and KAREN KAPLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The dot-com meltdown of the last two years has resulted in a sharp
contraction in the number of Internet domain names, the first such
reduction since the Web popularized the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   Since reaching a peak of about 30.7 million in September 2001, the
number of Net addresses ending in .com, .net and .org has dropped by
at least 3.4 million through May--nearly an 11% decline, according to
the most recent survey of registrars of Internet names.</LD>
<LD>   That's quite a switch from the heady early days of the Web, when
cyber real estate was doubling every few months. The virtual land
grab sparked a rush to register every possible name, including
Diarrhea.com and Devil.com.</LD>
<TE>   Today, cybersquatters--some of whom once made millions of dollars
grabbing and reselling names such as WallStreet.com, Wine.com and
Business.com--are finding there's no longer any money to be made
speculating in virtual real estate. Domain name resellers such as
GreatDomains.com have thousands of names available for
bargain-basement prices, including PopeOnline.net and Sex247.net for
a few hundred dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "The dot-com land grab is done," said C. Eugene Munster, a senior
research analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray.</TE>
<TE>   The downward trend stems from the implosion of dot-com firms and
the abandonment of unused addresses by major companies. Ultimately,
researchers said, consumers and corporate America alike have realized
that some parts of the Internet frontier just aren't worth staking a
claim to.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts expect the rate of decline to slow in the coming months.
Even so, the waning of the Net-name boom marks the passing of the
frenzied, and often kooky, spirit of one of the biggest
entrepreneurial booms of the modern age--a time when every wild idea
had a chance and every dream promised instant wealth.</TE>
<TE>   Lynn Atkinson learned of the slumping demand the hard way. The
Redondo Beach travel consultant registered several domain
names--including YoursForTheMoney.com--during the Internet boom of
the late 1990s. She hoped to sell or rent the sites and pocket tens
of thousands of dollars. But no one has been willing to pony up a
sweet-enough bid.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been up for sale for about six months, and I'd be happy to
entertain a reasonable offer," Atkinson said. "I'm just not getting
the bids I want."</TE>
<TE>   Even Fortune 500 companies expected to find value in Net names
that were both brand-specific and obscurely odd. Procter &amp; Gamble
Co., the giant maker of consumer products, grabbed scores of
addresses including BabyDiapers.com, Pimples.com and Cough.com.</TE>
<TE>   Kraft Foods Inc. did the same, registering such wordy domain names
as AmericasCheeseExperts.com. But the $64.2-billion food giant
ultimately decided that it wasn't worth spending as little as $50 a
year to own that address and let its registration lapse.</TE>
<TE>   For some, such as Johnson &amp; Johnson, it was simply a case of name
glut.</TE>
<TE>   "It's become clear that we've already registered as many domain
names to protect our trademarks as we need," said Tina Gordon,
director of corporate communications for Johnson &amp; Johnson. "We
haven't needed to buy any more this year."</TE>
<TE>   Fewer domain names, however, doesn't mean the Net is fading away.
Though estimates vary, there still are nearly 31 million addresses
registered worldwide, according to statistics compiled by NetNames, a
global Internet registrar based in London. Many of those end with
country abbreviations such as .uk for the United Kingdom and .ca for
Canada.</TE>
<TE>   The number of people using the Net continues to grow, particularly
overseas. Worldwide, the number of Internet users has grown to 581
million in May from 463 million a year earlier, according to Nua.com,
which tracks Internet demographics. Over the same period, the
proportion of the world's population online has increased to 9.6%
from 7.6%. In China, the number of Net users has tripled in the last
year, reaching 37.5 million in May.</TE>
<TE>   Online business activity is growing as well. Consumer e-commerce
sales in the U.S. last year hit $66.6 billion, up from $44.1 billion
in 2000, according to market research firm IDC. By the end of 2002,
Americans are expected to have spent $94.1 billion online.</TE>
<TE>   The shrinking number of domain names, however, does reflect some
other trends. One is the fading of entrepreneurial aspirations.</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Gaw, a Palo Alto-based e-commerce analyst with IDC,
registered the domain YouAreWhatYouSurf.com a few years ago but
recently let it lapse.</TE>
<TE>   "It was going to be a slogan for some company that a friend of
mine had been thinking of putting together, but it never got off the
ground," Gaw said.</TE>
<TE>   Many consumers just refuse to pay for addresses they once got
free. Mason Cole, publisher of the market research report State of
the Domain, said the industry took a hit earlier this year when
contracts that involved promotional domain name giveaways began to
dry up.</TE>
<TE>   "Two years ago, when you'd register for a .com, a lot of companies
were throwing in a .net and .org for free," said Cole, whose survey
for SnapNames.com Inc. detailed the industry slump from last fall
through late spring. "Now, people want neither and aren't renewing
them."</TE>
<TE>   With less demand for domain names, fewer people are engaging in
cybersquatting, the practice of registering an Internet address with
the hope of selling it at a huge profit.</TE>
<TE>   The Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act provided another
deterrent.</TE>
<TE>   Signed into law in 1999, it mandates fines of as much as $100,000
for people convicted of registering Internet names that infringed
either a registered trademark or a person's name.</TE>
<TE>   Although names ending in .com are languishing, the land grab is
still in effect for addresses ending with other suffixes, such as
.us, which became available last month to U.S. entities.</TE>
<TE>   Sellers of the .name suffix--which is reserved for personal
names--and .info--for general use--have begun an aggressive marketing
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   And domain name registrars said they are starting to see some
promise in corporations wanting to carve out addresses that are
specific to foreign countries.</TE>
<TE>   "The market's getting smarter, and this industry needs to reinvent
itself," said Tom D'Alleva, vice president of marketing for
Baltimore-based BulkRegister Inc. "Speculation is gone. The days of
hunting out a real business opportunity are here."</TE>

<HD>Hoping for an End to the Summer Slide</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Times Staff, Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors worldwide will be watching closely this week to see if the
U.S. stock market has finally halted its summer slide.</LD>
<LD>   The turnaround Wednesday in U.S. blue-chip indexes and the
dollar's newfound strength suggest to some analysts that share prices
have hit at least a near-term bottom.</LD>
<LD>   "A lot of the negativity is out of the way and we're seeing very
good earnings reports" from many companies, said James Luke, fund
manager at BB&amp;T Asset Management, which oversees $10 billion. "We're
due for a bounce."</LD>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrials gained a net 3.1% last week, closing
Friday at 8,264.39, mostly thanks to the surge of almost 500 points
Wednesday in record trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 inched up 0.6% for the week, to 852.84.
But the battered technology sector remained the market's weakest
spot: The tech-dominated Nasdaq composite fell 4.3% for the week, to
close at 1,262.12.</TE>
<TE>   Year to date, the Dow is down 17.5%, the S&amp;P 500 is down 25.7% and
Nasdaq is off 35.3%.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the midweek turnaround in blue chips, the surprise last
week was the dollar's rally against the euro and the yen. That could
indicate that global investment funds are beginning to favor U.S.
stocks, with prices near five-year lows.</TE>
<TE>   By Friday, the euro had fallen to 98.8 cents. It had traded above
$1.01 in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   A sharp drop in the price of gold last week also could indicate
that investor fear levels are beginning to recede, experts said. Gold
ended last week at $303.40 an ounce, its lowest since April.</TE>
<TE>   But some analysts cautioned that the rebound in U.S. stocks and in
the dollar could amount to little more than a temporary lull in the
selling that has hammered Wall Street for the last 10 weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "We were way due for a bounce but the fundamentals haven't
changed," said Matthew Johnston, managing director of trading at
brokerage Lehman Bros. in New York. "We're still dealing with
terrorism, accounting issues and [economic] fundamentals ... which
appear to be showing signs of deterioration."</TE>
<TE>   Also, though second-quarter earnings reports from many companies
have been strong, analysts are concerned that profit momentum will
slow again in the second half of the year.</TE>

<HD>Consumer Confidence, Jobless Reports Due</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stock market declines and a slowdown in economic growth have damped
U.S. consumer confidence, making companies reluctant to hire and
restraining the factory rebound, reports this week are likely to
show.</LD>
<LD>   A report Wednesday on gross domestic product probably will show
that the economy expanded at a 2.3% annual pace from April through
June, following a 6.1% growth rate in the first quarter, based on the
median of 59 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.</LD>
<LD>   Friday's report on July unemployment probably will show that the
rate of joblessness remained at 5.9%, close to the 7 1/2-year high of
6% in April, economists said.</LD>
<TE>   Confidence in the economy may be declining because the stock
market is flagging. On Tuesday, the Conference Board's consumer
confidence index will be issued and probably will show a drop to
101.5 in July, the lowest reading since February, from 106.4 in June.</TE>
<TE>   People who have jobs keep spending because their incomes are
rising, a report Friday from the Commerce Department also may show.
Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy
and is underpinning the recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Manufacturing probably grew in July at a slower rate than in the
previous month, a report Thursday from the Institute for Supply
Management is expected to show. The group's factory index probably
fell to 54.9 this month from 56.2 in June.</TE>
<TE>   Other reports this week:</TE>
<TE>   * Wednesday, the National Assn. of Purchasing Management-Chicago
is expected to report a July factory index of 56.5, down from 58.2 in
June.</TE>
<TE>   * Thursday, the Commerce Department probably will report a 0.2%
increase in June construction spending.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Can't find a restaurant? Running out of gas? Down to your last
dollar?</LD>
<LD>   Tell it to the car.</LD>
<LD>   IBM Corp. is expected today to sign a deal with Honda Motor Co.
that would make it easier for drivers to find the closest gas station
or restaurant by asking the car's computer for help.</LD>
<TE>   IBM said Honda will offer in its 2003 Accord models, for sale in
September, a navigation system that is integrated with voice
recognition software and a small touch screen.</TE>
<TE>   The voice recognition system works by touching a button on the
steering wheel and then speaking aloud. The software then responds,
using the car's audio system to give driving directions.</TE>
<TE>   The voice recognition software, based on IBM's ViaVoice product,
understands different speech accents and has a larger vocabulary,
according to Raj Desai, IBM's director of automotive and telematics
solutions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's closer to the natural ability to have a dialogue, rather
than just remembering key words, which is what the
previous-generation systems had," Desai said.</TE>
<TE>   Companies including DaimlerChrysler have been building cars with
voice recognition and other wireless communications-based services
for years, but it was still not clear if there is a market for the
technology, called telematics.</TE>
<TE>   Ford Motor Co., for instance, pulled the plug on its 18-month-old
telematics venture Wingcast in June. General Motors Corp. has the
largest telecommunications service system, called OnStar.</TE>
<TE>   IBM said price information on the system was not available.</TE>

<HD>Qwest Says It Used Improper Accounting</HD>
<DH>Telecom: The firm will restate results after incorrectly
booking $1.16 billion in sales.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Qwest Communications International Inc., under a federal accounting
investigation, said Sunday it will restate results because the
telephone company incorrectly booked $1.16 billion in sales and some
expenses.</LD>
<LD>   Qwest withdrew its 2002 forecasts, which called for as much as
$18.4 billion in sales, because of competition and diminishing
demand, Chief Executive Richard Notebaert said. Qwest, which
improperly booked sales from 1999-2001, didn't say which periods it
expects to restate or by how much.</LD>
<LD>   The Securities and Exchange Commission in March began probing
transactions in which Qwest, the biggest local-phone provider in 14
western U.S. states, sold space on its fiber-optic network to other
carriers, then agreed to buy a similar amount from them. Investors
questioned whether the company used the swaps to improperly inflate
sales.</LD>
<TE>   "The right thing to do is share the information we have with the
shareholders and the public," said Notebaert, who was named by the
board to replace Joseph Nacchio last month. "We'd like to have
resolution to the [SEC probe] so we can serve our 18 million
customers."</TE>
<TE>   In April, Denver-based Qwest forecast 2002 sales of $18 billion to
$18.4 billion, below its previous estimate. Qwest didn't say when the
restatement would be complete.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest also said it improperly accounted for some expenses from the
purchase of service from other carriers in 2000 and 2001. WorldCom
Inc., the second-largest U.S. long-distance phone company, filed the
biggest U.S. bankruptcy a week ago after hiding $3.85 billion in
expenses, some from using rivals' networks.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts have questioned whether Qwest will be forced to file
for bankruptcy. Notebaert dismissed the possibility.</TE>
<TE>   "This company will survive and the services and products we
provide that are so critical will go on," he told Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   A restatement by Qwest, which also faces a criminal probe by the
Justice Department, could jeopardize some of its funding agreements,
which require it to maintain a certain ratio of debt-to-EBTIDA, or
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, the
company said.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest had $26.5 billion in debt as of March 31 and has about $6.5
billion in debt maturing in May 2003 through 2004, according to
debt-rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still very solvent here," Qwest's new Chief Financial
Officer Oren Shaffer told Reuters. "We were in compliance [with
funding agreements] in the first quarter and we don't know what the
second quarter is going to look like," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC is investigating Qwest's fiber-optic capacity swaps with
Global Crossing Ltd., Enron Corp. and others in 2000 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is whether the fiber-optic capacity swaps were done for
legitimate business reasons, were priced at fair market values and
were properly accounted for.</TE>
<TE>   The expected restatement comes at a time when the federal
government is pledging a crackdown on corporate misdeeds after a
series of scandals at major companies eroded investor confidence in
Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest hired auditor KPMG in June to examine its books, after
dismissing Arthur Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department is investigating Qwest, and the General
Services Administration is reviewing government contracts with the
Denver-based telecommunications company.</TE>
<TE>   "It is our intent to fully cooperate with every government agency
and be totally transparent and responsive," Notebaert told the
Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   The company reported Sunday that accounting policies were
incorrectly applied to optical capacity sales in 1999, 2000 and 2001
totaling about $1.1 billion, or 18% of the optical capacity
transactions during that time.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest said the errors caused it to book about $874 million as
revenue for 2000 and 2001. The company also said it understated its
expenses in 2001 by $113 million, but overstated them by $15 million
in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The expected restatement of the company's financial reports also
will include adjustments for three transactions relating to equipment
sales that totaled $283 million in 2000 and 2001. The company has
determined that revenue and profit in those transactions were
incorrectly recognized upfront and should be deferred.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, Qwest improperly recorded cost entries for services
it purchased from third-party telecommunications providers in 2000
and 2001. In 2000, Qwest overstated costs by $15 million and in 2001
Qwest understated costs by $113 million.</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, Qwest has faced a downgrade of its credit rating
to junk status and a sinking stock price.</TE>
<TE>   In trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Qwest
were down 11 cents, or 6.8%, to close at $1.50, but gained 10 cents
in extended trading.</TE>

<LD>Executive Roundtable is a weekly column by TEC International, an
organization of more than 7,000 business owners, company presidents
and chief executives. TEC members meet in small peer groups to share
their business experiences and help each other solve problems in a
round-table session. The following question and answer summarize a
discussion at a recent TEC meeting in Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   Question: Earlier this year, we experienced some severe cash flow
problems. While checking for possible causes, I discovered my
accounts-receivable manager had allowed dozens of our
customers--including some of our largest accounts--to fall way behind
on their accounts payable. It seems he is great with numbers but
terrible on the phone. How can I get caught up quickly, and what can
I do to make sure this doesn't happen in the future?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: The short-term solution, says Abe "WalkingBear" Sanchez,
president of A/R Management Group Inc., is to put an aggressive
go-getter in the collections position. Long term, however, you need
to look at installing a more efficient and effective accounts
receivable system.</LD>
<TE>   "If you want something done well, you have to do it in a way that
you can monitor and measure it, and that includes the
accounts-receivable function," he says. "In the old days, that meant
keeping separate reports for each customer on note cards. These days
you can invest a few hundred dollars in a good contact management
software program, and tracking delinquent ARs becomes a snap. The key
is developing the discipline to use the system on a daily basis."</TE>
<TE>   It starts with getting the right person for the job. According to
Sanchez, most companies hire soft-spoken accountant types to handle
collections. Unfortunately, people who gravitate toward accounting
positions tend to be introverts who prefer working with numbers
rather than people. To jump-start your collections process, hire an
outgoing person who enjoys interacting with others and talking on the
phone. Equally important, find someone who doesn't shy away from
conflict and thrives on closing the "sale."</TE>
<TE>   Once you have the right person on board, use the following steps
to collect on delinquent accounts:</TE>
<TE>   Use a daily accounts-receivable contact report. Have your
accounts-receivable person give you a written daily report that
tracks four critical areas: whom he or she called each day, the
outcome of each conversation, when you can expect payment from each
customer and whether customers have paid when they said they would.
Review this report on a daily basis until you get caught up. Then
review it on a weekly or monthly basis, as needed.</TE>
<TE>   Start the follow-up process early. Contact problem accounts within
three to five days of their becoming overdue. Waiting 60 or 90 days
not only puts a major dent in your cash flow, it puts delinquent
customers in an embarrassing situation because they know they are
overdue. Often, rather than square the account, they put your
receivables at the bottom of their payables pile and take their
business to a competitor. To justify their actions, they may start
bad-mouthing your company or complain about nonexistent problems with
your product or service.</TE>
<TE>   Call the largest accounts first. Most companies call their
delinquent accounts in alphabetical order. Instead, forgo that
approach and go after the customers that owe you the big bucks. Why?
Because 20% of your accounts usually represent 80% of the dollars. Do
your cash flow a favor by starting with the largest accounts and
working your way down to the smaller ones.</TE>
<TE>   Keep a log to track systems problems. Customers often become
delinquent because of billing or invoicing errors on your part. By
tracking your accounts-receivable systems problems and your solutions
to those problems, you can respond to billing glitches in a timely
and efficient manner, thereby eliminating a common excuse for late
payments. A good tracking system also allows you to upgrade your
business processes continually and provide better service to your
customers.</TE>
<TE>   Call at the right time. The best time to call commercial accounts
is Monday morning. Start calling personal customers Thursday and go
through Friday, when people usually get paid.</TE>
<TE>   "Keeping current on your A/R collections requires having a system
and a methodology for getting customers to pay on time," Sanchez
says. "Whether it's you or someone else in your organization, simply
pick up the phone and make contact. Call early, call often and sell
the customer on the benefits of staying current with you. You'll
improve your cash flow, enhance your internal processes and build
stronger, more profitable relationships with your customers."</TE>

<HD>Price May Keep the StarCaddy Off the Green</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL P. REGAN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At first glance, the StarCaddy appeared to be the most promising golf
gadget since Rodney Dangerfield's bag spit clubs into the air, played
tunes and served draft beer in "Caddyshack."</LD>
<LD>   A gadget that relies on global satellite positioning and golf
course maps loaded into an attached hand-held computer, the StarCaddy
allows you to measure precise distances to a green's center from
anywhere on a hole.</LD>
<LD>   In my testing, I could see where it might help knock a few strokes
off someone's game. But the $249 StarCaddy probably won't knock those
$400 Callaway drivers, or a snazzy pair of knickers, off the top of
my golf wish list.</LD>
<TE>   Then again, I'm too cheap to pay for a real caddie, let alone a
satellite caddie. I suppose if I were a duffer with deep pockets--and
just a modicum of tech savvy--I'd order mine today.</TE>
<TE>   The StarCaddy has a global positioning receiver that plugs into
most PDAs, but if you have a compatible GPS receiver you can buy the
software alone for $49.</TE>
<TE>   Detailed course maps are currently available for about 3,000 of
the roughly 17,000 golf courses in the United States, with downloads
costing a pricey $20 per map.</TE>
<TE>   Purists note: The United States Golf Assn. bans GPS systems at
sanctioned tournaments such as the U.S. Open and U.S. Amateur
championship. It does allow rounds played with them to be included
when calculating a handicap.</TE>
<TE>   In my first round with a StarCaddy, I failed to get it to work
right. The receiver did its satellite positioning thing but the
software wouldn't paint the X to denote my location on the course
map.</TE>
<TE>   The X moves as you navigate the course. The distance to the center
of the green is given to the nearest yard.</TE>
<TE>   My StarCaddy debut at the Cranbury Golf Course in New Jersey was
thus a washout.</TE>
<TE>   To make matters worse, I was befuddled because it appeared I had
the wrong map. So I gave up and left the PocketPC in the cart. A few
holes later, I discovered the problem. The front and back nine were
flipped, so holes 1 to 9 were numbered 10 to 18 and vice versa.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the StarCaddy offers some cool features--even without the
GPS. The ruler tool lets you draw lines on the map and get exact
lengths. This is a big help when planning strategy on long holes. You
can find out exactly how far a distant water hazard is, or gauge the
best approach to a dogleg.</TE>
<TE>   Since it was useful without the GPS, I allowed StarCaddy one
mulligan and decided to try it again a few nights later--after
talking to tech support and rebooting so the magical X actually
appeared.</TE>
<TE>   When I appeared at the course at 9 p.m., the kid closing up the
cart shack was ready to give me the boot--until I showed him the
StarCaddy. "That's phat!" he exclaimed, before allowing me to wander
the course in the dark.</TE>
<TE>   This turned out to be a fun way to test it out.</TE>
<TE>   Getting a GPS connection is easier once you are familiar with the
menus and troubleshooting tips in the user's guide.</TE>
<TE>   In pitch-black darkness, I used the GPS to find the first pin with
no problem, then navigated through a few other holes and back to the
parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   After my successful navigation, I reconsidered the StarCaddy: Is
it worth the money? For me, one issue may tip the scales.</TE>
<TE>   The folks at LinksPoint, which makes StarCaddy, say they hope to
eventually set up wireless networks at finer clubs and resort
courses. This means you could use the StarCaddy to order drinks or
schedule a post-golf massage while still on the course.</TE>
<TE>   The future surely looks bright.</TE>

<HD>Investors Can Find Value in Bear Market</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Although analysts say there are plenty of
worthwhile stocks, they warn that bargain hunting is risky.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The bear market has soured investor spirits and wiped out an
estimated $8 trillion in stock wealth over the last two years, but it
also has created something, analysts said: bargains galore.</LD>
<LD>   Many money managers and investment strategists said they are
finding plenty of worthwhile stocks with reasonable price-to-earnings
ratios and decent dividend yields, to use two of the most traditional
valuation yardsticks.</LD>
<LD>   Their picks include classic growth stocks such as Pfizer Inc. and
Fannie Mae, along with more traditional value names such as
Occidental Petroleum Corp.</LD>
<TE>   "Right now there are more opportunities than I've seen in a very
long time--at least through the 1990s," said David Dreman, manager of
the Scudder Dreman High Return Equity fund in Jersey City, N.J., and
a well-known value-stock investor.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Carlson, editor of DRIP Investor newsletter and head of
Horizon Publishing Co. in Hammond, Ind., said, "It's a good time to
upgrade your portfolio. There may be stocks you've always wanted, but
in the past they were too expensive."</TE>
<TE>   Arnold Kaufman, editor of Outlook, the Standard &amp; Poor's
investment newsletter in New York, said P/E ratios and dividend
yields have become more attractive overall as the downturn has driven
stock indexes to five-year lows, though he acknowledges that neither
yardstick is at a level typically found at a bear market bottom.</TE>
<TE>   That's a principal argument bears make in warning about the
prospect of further losses.</TE>
<TE>   The current 1.8% annualized dividend yield on the blue-chip
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index contrasts with 5.9% at the end of the
1973-74 downturn, 6.7% at the 1982 market bottom and 4.1% in 1990.
Since 1923, the average blue-chip yield has been 4.5%.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not seeing the juicy 7% or 8% yields this time around,
except on the real estate investment trusts," Kaufman said, "but
there are some decent 3% to 4% yields out there."</TE>
<TE>   P/Es, meanwhile, have tumbled toward historical norms after riding
high in the 1990s bull market.</TE>
<TE>   Based on analysts' operating earnings forecasts for this year, the
S&amp;P 500 trades at an average P/E of about 17, versus the long-term
historical average of 14.</TE>
<TE>   Based on analysts' earnings estimates for 2003, the P/E for the
S&amp;P 500 is about 15. Two to three years ago, the S&amp;P 500's ratios
were in the mid- to high 20s.</TE>
<TE>   Though P/Es sank into single digits in the 1970s and stayed there
for years, conditions were vastly different. High inflation and high
interest rates had depressed valuations on stocks.</TE>
<TE>   In today's climate of low inflation and low rates, the bullish
spin is that loftier P/Es, perhaps in the low 20s, are warranted--in
other words, the market is undervalued with key indexes near levels
last seen in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, analysts said there are plenty of risks--as well as
potential rewards--for bargain hunters these days.</TE>
<TE>   With the bear market in its third year and no guarantee that last
week's rally marked the bottom, buying requires patience and a strong
stomach.</TE>
<TE>   "Three years from now you'll probably be glad you bought," Carlson
said. "But three months from now, who knows?"</TE>
<TE>   A critical issue is what earnings will turn out to be this year
and in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   If the economy slows significantly, analysts' estimates could be
all wet, which means stocks are more expensive than they appear.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, P/Es based on operating earnings--meaning results
before one-time write-offs--trouble more investors these days. Many
Wall Street bears said there's nothing "one-time" about write-offs
any longer, and that a fairer way of measuring stocks is based on net
income after write-offs.</TE>
<TE>   Calculating P/Es based on net income would mean many stocks are
far more richly valued than if operating earnings are used.</TE>
<TE>   Even if investors believe that many stocks are extraordinary
values, experts said diversification is crucial because so-called
value traps can do a lot of harm to a portfolio. A value trap is a
stock that may look cheap but gets a lot cheaper because of
fundamental problems at the company.</TE>
<TE>   "A broad portfolio of stocks will help protect against any
disasters," Carlson said.</TE>
<TE>   Buy-and-hold investors naturally want to take a long-term view of
stocks, but they need to monitor their holdings closely, Carlson
added. Investors have learned the hard way how dangerous it is to
ignore deepening troubles in an industry--telecom, for example.</TE>
<TE>   "You can dollar-cost-average your way into oblivion," Carlson
said, referring to the strategy of making regular purchases of the
same stock or mutual fund over time. Some investors did virtually
that with Lucent Technologies Inc., for instance, which has fallen
from its peak of more than $60 in late 1999 to $1.53 today.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1999 and 2000, people tended to give companies the benefit of
the doubt and stick with them," Carlson said. "But the world does
change and stocks do too."</TE>
<TE>   Some areas of the market remain too scary even for die-hard
bargain hunters such as Dreman who thrive on what he calls "crisis
investing."</TE>
<TE>   Most technology stocks, for example, hold no appeal for Dreman
despite their continuing free fall.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no sign of pickup in IT [information technology]
spending, and the tech stocks still have pretty high projected P/E
multiples--based on earnings that probably are not going to come
through," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Dreman and others who see bargains in the market are
typically looking in sectors other than tech:</TE>
<TE>   * Dreman said mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are
"bargain basement stocks" at current prices, given their steady
earnings growth over the years. Both trade at P/E discounts to the
S&amp;P 500 as well as to their own historical averages, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dreman also likes two tobacco companies that he believes investors
have punished in recent months more than is warranted by potential
health-care liability risks: UST Inc. and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Holdings Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, he thinks drug giant Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., whose
shares are down nearly two-thirds since September, is undervalued.
Despite a series of management blunders, the company has a strong
pipeline of products in the works, Dreman said.</TE>
<TE>   * Carlson sees market sell-offs as an ideal time to buy
high-quality stocks at reasonable prices, rather than trying to
"bottom fish" with second-tier names. He likes Pfizer in the drug
sector, Wells Fargo &amp; Co. in the financial area and Exxon Mobil Corp.
in the energy group.</TE>
<TE>   Pfizer is down 26% year to date, Wells Fargo is down 10% from its
May peak and Exxon Mobil is off 21% from its April peak.</TE>
<TE>   * Kaufman said S&amp;P's equity analysts are bullish on a number of
stocks that pay above-average dividends and carry relatively modest
P/Es.</TE>
<TE>   These include Occidental Petroleum, Bank of America Corp.,
chemical maker PPG Industries Inc., metal processor Worthington
Industries Inc., real estate investment trust Chelsea Property Group
Inc. and engine maker Cummins Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Some of these names have held up well this year even as the S&amp;P
500 has slumped 25.7%, but nearly all of the stocks have fallen from
their spring highs as the bear market has deepened.</TE>

<DH>In the Pacific island paradise of Fiji, land rights are a
powder-keg issue between the indigenous and ethnic Indian
populations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD C. PADDOCK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SUVA, Fiji</DL>
<LD>In the Wailea squatter settlement on the outskirts of this capital,
indigenous Fijians and Indian descendants of sugar-cane workers live
side by side in squalor.</LD>
<LD>   In this land of white sand beaches and dazzling vistas, they have
built their homes on the same muddy street from sheets of corrugated
metal and scraps of plywood. Poverty, it seems, is one thing the two
races share in a bitterly divided country.</LD>
<LD>   "If I had money, I would buy land," said Leela Sharma, 56, an
unemployed factory worker who has lived in the settlement for 15
years. "Who wants to live like this? How can we build our future?"</LD>
<TE>   In this ethnically torn society, the chance to own property is
rare for Indo-Fijians like Sharma. By law, native Fijians own nearly
90% of the land. And many would rather let it sit idle than lease it
to the people they see as outsiders--even when some Indo-Fijian
families have lived here for more than a century. For many
Indo-Fijian farmers, the lack of land dooms them to poverty.</TE>
<TE>   Despite this Pacific island nation's reputation as a tourist
paradise, Fiji simmers with resentment. Two years after a coup that
ousted the country's first Indo-Fijian prime minister, the government
is polarized, the economy is struggling, and race relations have
worsened.</TE>
<TE>   The racial divide has grown so wide that Indo-Fijians are leaving
the country by the thousands. Since the coup, nearly a quarter of
Fiji's 840,000 people have applied for green cards in the hope of
moving to the U.S., officials say. Indo-Fijians once outnumbered
indigenous Fijians, but over the past decade their numbers have
fallen to about 42% of the population.</TE>
<TE>   In a country the size of Riverside County, the two communities
grudgingly coexist, interacting when necessary but maintaining their
own traditions and culture. As a rule, they operate in separate
economic spheres. But some commerce between the two is necessary:
While the native Fijians control the land, Indo-Fijians own 90% of
the country's businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Although the families of most Indo-Fijians have been here for
three or four generations, indigenous people still refer to them as
the "visitor community."</TE>
<TE>   "They are Fijian citizens, but they are not Fijian people," said
Penina Kaunisela, an indigenous Fijian who lives in the squatter
settlement. "They don't belong here."</TE>
<TE>   The hostility between the two groups dates to colonial times, when
the British brought over the Indians to work the land as indentured
servants.</TE>
<TE>   When Britain granted Fiji independence in 1970, it tried to ensure
that the native people would not be subjugated in their own country
and guaranteed them ownership of 83% of the country's land. An
additional 9% is owned by the government, leaving only 8% available
for sale to non-indigenous residents.</TE>
<TE>   But although native Fijians own the land, they are not necessarily
inclined to work it. The British brought the Indians here in the
first place because they couldn't persuade the Fijians to labor in
the cane fields.</TE>
<TE>   At independence, the departing colonial government kept the sugar
industry going by leasing 30-acre tracts for up to 30 years to the
Indo-Fijian farmers who were working them.</TE>
<TE>   The terms were often very favorable to the Indo-Fijians, who
prospered while the landowners received a pittance and grew
resentful.</TE>
<TE>   When the leases began expiring in 1997, thousands of owners
refused to renew them. Many have let the cane fields lie fallow,
preferring to get nothing rather than let Indo-Fijians farm their
land.</TE>
<TE>   For the Indo-Fijian community, losing the leases has been
devastating. Some have been forced to abandon land their families had
worked since the late 1800s. Most cannot afford to leave the country
and have no other skills to fall back on.</TE>
<TE>   Fiji Labor Party leader Mahendra Chaudhry, who was ousted as prime
minister in the 2000 coup, likens it to the eviction of white farmers
in Zimbabwe by black nationalists who have let the farms sit and
decay.</TE>
<TE>   Fiji's sugar production--long a mainstay of the economy--has
fallen by a third since 1997. Some predict that the industry, already
plagued by drought and bad debts, may soon collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Most native Fijians, however, are unconcerned by the decline in
sugar output. For them, land is more than a business opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   "Land is part of the Fijian identity," explained Apisalome Tudreu,
permanent secretary of the Ministry of National Reconciliation,
Information and Media Relations. "It is not just an economic asset.
Land is who I am."</TE>
<TE>   Land is at the center of a communal way of life that predates
colonial times. Most native Fijians live in villages in clans called
mataqali that are headed by a hereditary chief. Within each mataqali,
everything is shared. If one member of the clan invokes the
traditional obligation of kerekere and asks for something, the owner
is expected to hand it over.</TE>
<TE>   The system is a great equalizer and ensures that everyone in the
village is taken care of. But there is little entrepreneurial spirit
and no incentive to work hard: Any profit will simply be given away.</TE>
<TE>   Some indigenous Fijians say they live happily off the land,
surviving on the coconuts, cassava, bananas and taro that grow all
around. But there is a growing desire for consumer goods,
particularly among younger people, and many harbor resentment toward
Indo-Fijians, who they believe have prospered at their expense.</TE>
<TE>   Chaudhry, who is widely disliked by the native people, argues that
the communal system is holding the country back economically and must
be changed if Fiji is to prosper.</TE>
<TE>   "They want to preserve their people in the 18th century at the
same time they want them to live in prosperity in the 21st century,"
he said. "In the long run, reforms will have to be brought into
Fijian society to free them from this communal and cultural
obligation."</TE>
<TE>   Despite Fiji's abundant resources, he says, the economy has been
stagnant for 25 years, barely keeping pace with population growth.
Fiji's per capita income was once higher than those of countries such
as Singapore and Thailand, he says, but has fallen well behind. Half
the population now lives at or below the poverty line.</TE>
<TE>   Compared with other parts of the world that have similar racial
conflict, Fiji has seen relatively little violence. The country
remains safe for tourists, who fly in and out and travel to resorts
without encountering difficulty. Both ethnic groups are generally
friendly to visitors. The number of tourists is expected to return
this year to pre-coup levels.</TE>
<TE>   But there is underlying tension and reports of rising crime.
Fijian newspapers cite a growing number of incest cases as a sign of
society's moral decay. In Suva, visitors are warned of the danger of
muggings on the streets of the capital at night.</TE>
<TE>   Political instability plagues the country. There have been three
coups and three constitutions in the past 15 years as the two groups
have repeatedly clashed over how to run the government.</TE>
<TE>   Some fear Fiji is headed for another political crisis that could
throw the country into chaos, scare off the tourists and bring the
economy close to collapse.</TE>
<TE>   "Our concern for Fiji is that things could fall apart," said one
Western diplomat who asked not to be identified. "This could become a
failed state."</TE>
<TE>   Chaudhry was elected prime minister in 1999 as the leader of a
coalition government. The scrappy former union leader's desire to
bring about drastic change in Fijian society quickly won him many
enemies.</TE>
<TE>   In May 2000, native Fijian businessman George Speight and a gang
of followers seized Parliament and held Chaudhry and his ministers
hostage for two months.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the military stepped in and ended the crisis but did
not restore Chaudhry to power. Instead, the country held new
elections in September and Laisenia Qarase, an indigenous Fijian, was
elected prime minister at the head of another coalition government.</TE>
<TE>   Since the coup, the United States has not restored military ties
with Fiji or allowed American naval vessels to dock here.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the recent emigrants are the nation's best-educated and
wealthiest Indo-Fijians. So many doctors have left that Fiji is
suffering a shortage and has begun recruiting physicians from Myanmar
and the Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials estimate that after the coup, 200,000 Fijian
citizens entered their names in the U.S. green-card lottery.</TE>
<TE>   Under Fiji's most recent constitution, adopted in 1997, the prime
minister is required to appoint a Cabinet that includes opposition
members in proportion to their numbers in Parliament. For Qarase,
that would mean naming eight of Chaudhry's people to his 20-member
Cabinet. He has refused.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't marry unwilling partners," said Tudreu, the
Reconciliation Ministry spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Chaudhry's party took the prime minister to court and won a
judicial order directing him to put the opposition members in his
Cabinet. Qarase continued to refuse and appealed to the Supreme
Court. A hearing is set for September.</TE>
<TE>   Qarase has shown little interest in prosecuting many of the native
Fijians who backed the 2000 coup.</TE>
<TE>   Speight is in prison for life after pleading guilty to treason.
But Jope Seniloli, who was sworn in on the second day of the coup as
provisional president of Fiji, has not been tried. Instead, he is
serving as Fiji's vice president.</TE>
<TE>   Chaudhry, who as finance minister was twice held hostage during
two coups in 1987, is still angry at losing his post of prime
minister. He remembers the verbal abuse, the cracked ribs and the
torn knee he suffered at the hands of the rebels two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "The Indian people are peace-loving people," he said. "I think
they have demonstrated their good faith over the years by being good
citizens, but they are regarded as foreigners in the land of their
own birth."</TE>
<TE>   For many indigenous Fijians, however, the descendants of the
Indian cane workers will never belong and an Indo-Fijian prime
minister should never again lead the country.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's better for Fijians to rule their own country," said
Kaunisela, who shares her Wailea settlement house with 13 relatives.
"Chaudhry wanted to change the Fijian land. It's not the right thing
to do. The land is for the Fijian people."</TE>

<HD>Pope Speaks Out on Scandal</HD>
<DH>Church: Pontiff, in his first public comments on the issue,
calls sex abuse by priests a source of 'shame.' But he does not
apologize to victims.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>Pope John Paul II addressed the church's sexual abuse scandal for the
first time in public Sunday, telling 800,000 young Roman Catholics
here at an outdoor Mass that "the harm done ... to the young and
vulnerable fills us all with a deep sense of sadness and shame." He
stopped short of apologizing to the victims.</LD>
<LD>   The pontiff also urged support for the church's innocent priests,
a gesture designed to lift the sagging morale of clerics, especially
in the U.S., who in the last seven months have endured suspicion by
congregants, new sets of rules and jokes made on late-night talk
shows.</LD>
<LD>   "Think of the vast majority of dedicated and generous priests ...
whose only wish is to serve and do good," said John Paul as his
40-minute sermon was interrupted by applause. "Be close to them and
support them."</LD>
<TE>   The papal Mass at Downsview Park culminated the weeklong World
Youth Day, a biennial festival, nicknamed Popestock, created 15 years
ago by John Paul to bolster the next generation of Catholics in their
faith.</TE>
<TE>   "If you love Jesus, love the church," the 82-year-old pope told
young pilgrims from 170 countries. "Do not be discouraged by the sins
and failings of some of her members.... At difficult moments in the
church's life, the pursuit of holiness becomes even more urgent."</TE>
<TE>   Previous comments from John Paul on the American molestation
scandal, which erupted in Boston in January and spread across the
country, found their way to the public indirectly: by way of a letter
to clerics in April and a talk that same month with U.S. cardinals in
Rome.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence Cunningham, a theology professor at the University of
Notre Dame, speculated that the pope's direct acknowledgment of the
issue was prompted by the latest priest scandals in the media,
including the arrest of two New Jersey clerics in Montreal last week
who were charged with soliciting sex from male minors. A spokesman
for the Newark, N.J., diocese told Associated Press that both men
resigned from their duties after their arrests.</TE>
<TE>   "He's very media savvy, and the people around him would have paid
attention to what was in the Canadian and American press," Cunningham
said. "If he didn't say something about it, it would have felt
peculiar, as if he were indifferent to the issue."</TE>
<TE>   For America's 46,000 priests, the message was an unexpected morale
boost. About 300 U.S. priests have been taken off duty this year due
to sexual abuse allegations, according to a survey by Associated
Press.</TE>
<TE>   "To have him say that, it meant a lot," said Michael Cummins, a
34-year-old priest from Knoxville, Tenn. "I thought it was a great
thing to hear it directly from him."</TE>
<TE>   But a national leader of a victims support group said John Paul's
latest words, though welcome, didn't go far enough.</TE>
<TE>   "We're fundamentally disappointed that he didn't apologize," said
David Clohessy, executive director of the national Survivors Network,
which helps people abused by priests. "And he only talked about the
abusive priests and not the complicit bishops who let the problem
reach horrific proportions."</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, who has been criticized for allowing
admitted child molesters to remain in ministries within the
Archdiocese of Los Angeles, said it was good that the young Catholics
heard directly from John Paul on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very pleased because this is obviously a reality not only
in my country but elsewhere in the world," he said. Bishops in
Ireland and Poland have resigned in recent months over sexual abuse
scandals.</TE>
<TE>   The pontiff's comments echoed a speech he made in Denver during
World Youth Day in 1993, when the church was also reeling from a
series of sex abuse scandals. "At a time when all institutions are
suspect, the church herself has not escaped reproach," John Paul said
at the time.</TE>
<TE>   For most of the youths in Toronto, the pope's mention of the
scandal had little significance. They say the controversy is
overblown by the media and does not represent a major church crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Even Cardinal Bernard Law, whose Archdiocese of Boston became the
scandal's flash point after it became public that he had moved a
serial molester from parish to parish, received a forgiving reception
by Catholics here who enthusiastically chanted, "Law! Law! Law!" and
danced with him during an appearance last week.</TE>
<TE>   "No offense, but the media focuses on things the church isn't
about," said Priscilla Scaff, a 16-year-old from a Costa Mesa parish
whose pastor recently was accused of a decades-old molestation. "But
here [at World Youth Day] you see what the church is all about."</TE>
<TE>   The pilgrims spent the week striking up friendships with other
Catholics from around the world, deepening their faith through
classes, daily services and prayer, and having fun by singing,
dancing and flying their nations' flags above the huge crowds. The
event attracted enough people to require 21 large video screens,
nearly 200 gallons of sacramental wine for the Mass and 30 acres of
portable toilets.</TE>
<TE>   "There are more people here than in my entire state," said Kyle
Washut, a 17-year-old from Casper, Wyo. "You might have a crowd of
cows like this, but you still don't have the same diversity as here."</TE>
<TE>   At Sunday's service, the pope spoke in seven languages, getting
cheers from native speakers each time he began in another tongue.</TE>
<TE>   Though the ailing pope displayed remarkable stamina throughout the
week, he faded markedly near the end of the three-hour Mass. His
words began to slur, his arms shook, and he slumped over the
altar--all signs of the Parkinson's disease that has grown worse in
recent years.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadian Broadcasting Corp., the event's broadcaster, cut away
from the pope at times, apparently trying to preserve his dignity as
he was moved to different areas on stage, sometimes on a specially
designed wheeled platform. But that strategy wasn't needed when the
pontiff arrived Tuesday in Toronto, surprising Vatican observers and
drawing gasps from the crowd as he descended the steep stairs of his
private airliner.</TE>
<TE>   John Paul used his old age Sunday as a way to connect with the
crowd. "You are young, and the pope is old," he said at one point,
smiling playfully at his audience. They responded by chanting, "The
pope is young!"</TE>
<TE>   For a moment, John Paul left his scripted remarks and commented
that there's a difference between being 82 and 22. But "[the pope]
still fully identifies with your hopes and aspirations," he said.
"Although I have lived through much darkness, under harsh
totalitarian regimes, I have seen enough evidence to be unshakably
convinced that no difficulty, no fear is so great that it can
completely suffocate the hope that springs eternal in the hearts of
the young."</TE>
<TE>   John Paul's special rapport with young people only grew over the
week as they watched the physical struggles of an elderly man who
traveled so far to see them.</TE>
<TE>   "What you see is a soul pushing a body," said the pope's
spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls. "A soul stronger than the body."</TE>
<TE>   Most in the crowd had spent Saturday night in sleeping bags and
cardboard tents on the massive runways and grass infields of the
abandoned military base at Downsview Park. An early morning
thunderstorm soaked the pilgrims and turned the grounds to mud.</TE>
<TE>   Even as the pope's helicopter descended onto the site--with a
choir singing Handel's "Messiah"--the steady rain continued. But soon
after John Paul began the Mass, the sun appeared.</TE>
<TE>   "He came here just for us, and we have a sense of bond with him,"
said Carmi-Joy T. Bonifacio, a 21-year-old from the Philippines.
"This is the only pope we've known. He's the one who shaped the world
we live in."</TE>
<TE>   John Paul still has a rigorous journey ahead as he flies today to
Guatemala to begin the second leg of his 11-day trip in the Americas.</TE>
<TE>   He'll end his 97th trip abroad later this week in Mexico, where he
will canonize one of the most beloved Catholic figures in Latin
America: Juan Diego. A 16th century Aztec, Diego is said to have
encountered a brown-skinned Virgin Mary--"Our Lady of
Guadalupe"--near present-day Mexico City. The news of Mary's
appearance in Mexico has been the cornerstone of Catholicism in Latin
America for the past five centuries.</TE>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Millions of Californians could soon receive the right to paid leave
from their jobs to care for ailing relatives or to bond with new
children under legislation that would fundamentally change the
contract between employers and employees.</LD>
<LD>   Strongly backed by organized labor and vehemently opposed by
business, the measure by state Sen. Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa Monica)
would make California the first state to grant most workers paid time
off to deal with crucial but common family situations.</LD>
<LD>   A significant expansion from current state and federal laws that
require larger businesses to provide their workers with unpaid family
leave during difficult times, the legislation would directly affect
the lives of more than 12 million California workers and the bottom
lines of thousands of businesses.</LD>
<TE>   As a result, the measure, which has cleared the Senate and now
awaits passage in the Assembly, is the focus of a simmering fight in
the state capital. Business groups say the costs of the program,
which remain unclear, would prove high and would lead to layoffs. But
women's groups and other supporters say the legislation would
actually save money by helping businesses retain good workers, citing
a recent UC Berkeley study.</TE>
<TE>   "The traditional caretakers--women--are now at work," said Lissa
Bell of the National Partnership for Women &amp; Families, citing the
rise of households in which both parents hold jobs. "So people are
having to choose between paying the bills or spending time with loved
ones [during emergencies]. That's not a choice they should have to
make."</TE>
<TE>   Europe Has Programs</TE>
<TE>   The United States is one of the last developed nations without
some form of paid parental leave. About 127 countries, including most
of Europe, have such programs, and many others have passed similar
laws to compensate workers who need time off because of family
emergencies.</TE>
<TE>   But Congress has repeatedly failed to adopt either, and proponents
are increasingly taking their fight to statehouses around the
country. Similar bills were introduced in 27 other states--including
New York and Massachusetts--over the last two years, according to the
National Partnership, a nonprofit Washington group that has been
pushing for the measures.</TE>
<TE>   The California legislation, which seems to share the most momentum
with the New York bill, would establish a mandatory insurance program
in the state that would be funded in equal measure by workers and
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   It would be modeled on an existing state program that provides
partial compensation to disabled workers. If a worker ever had to
miss time because a spouse or parent fell ill, or because the family
was bringing a new child into the home, the employee would receive as
much as 55% of his salary for as long as 12 weeks from the state-run
fund.</TE>
<TE>   With the exception of government employees, nearly every worker
would be eligible, but there would be a limit of about $728 a week on
the compensation that employees could receive in the program's first
year, 2004. Correspondingly, higher-wage earners would have to
contribute to the program only up to a certain portion of their
salaries, with the 2004 wage ceiling being about $65,000.</TE>
<TE>   Although the measure does not state exactly how much it would cost
to fund the program, a 2000 study by the state Employment Development
Department estimated the average cost at $34 annually per worker, or
$17 each from workers and their employers if equally split. The more
recent Berkeley study pegged the split at about $25 for each side,
however, and the California Chamber of Commerce, a leading opponent,
estimates that each share could be far higher, more than $100
annually.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents, primarily labor unions but also a number of religious,
senior citizen and child care groups, say the current unpaid-leave
laws do little to help families in times of need. They point to
studies showing that many workers do not take advantage of the laws
because, without some compensation, they cannot afford to leave their
jobs to care for loved ones, even for a few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the most important piece of pro-family legislation this
year. It's a very important bill to working people," said Art
Pulaski, treasurer of the California Labor Federation, AFL-CIO, the
measure's sponsor. "We are talking about $17 here to allow people to
spend some very important time with their families."</TE>
<TE>   Business Opposition</TE>
<TE>   Opponents, which include an array of trade groups, say the bill is
yet another example of California politicians imposing new costs on
business that could force them to cut jobs. The incremental fees are
adding up, they say, making it harder for them to compete in a global
economy.</TE>
<TE>   "The feel-good crowd pushing the bill is unfortunately trying to
mandate a fringe benefit," said Julianne Broyles of the California
chamber. "Certainly, it would be great if everyone could also provide
day care, but they can't."</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis, who is seeking reelection in November, has not
taken a position on the measure. But Kuehl said she is negotiating
with the California Restaurant Assn. and others in hopes of reducing
opposition--and indicated that she might be willing to abandon the
50-50 split and have the entire program funded by workers if that is
what it takes to appease business and get the governor's signature.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody wants to bleed the business community to death in
California," Kuehl said. "I certainly do not. It seems to me that the
main sticking point, and the one that may allow them to go neutral
[if it is addressed], is the employer contribution."</TE>
<TE>   Although Kuehl and the bill's detractors differ on a number of key
points, both sides agree on one: It would have profound effects on
California.</TE>
<TE>   For backers such as Jeff Norvet, the bill represents a
common-sense approach to a problem that might have made one of the
most traumatic events in his family's life a little more bearable.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the daily routine of the movie and television
cameraman from Agoura Hills fell to pieces when his wife, Patricia,
unexpectedly suffered a ruptured colon. It did not heal properly.</TE>
<TE>   "As I was following my wife there," he said of the frantic rush to
Los Robles Regional Medical Center in nearby Thousand Oaks, "I was
thinking, 'This changes everything.' I was wondering who was going to
pick up my kid."</TE>
<TE>   Norvet wound up staying home to nurse his ailing wife, whose colon
burst a second time, requiring five hospital stays. He changed her
bandages, drove their two teenage children where they needed to go
and cooked for the family.</TE>
<TE>   His inability to work, combined with the huge hospital bills, took
its toll on the family's finances. Because of her health problems,
Patricia had to quit a part-time job at a picture frame store.</TE>
<TE>   The Norvet family still lives in Agoura Hills but had to move to a
smaller home. A partial paycheck would have helped, said Norvet, who
has traveled to Sacramento to testify in favor of the legislation.</TE>
<TE>   "It just would have taken a little bit of the edge off," he said.
"Something like this that comes out of the blue, there is just no way
to plan for that."</TE>
<TE>   For opponents such as Morton Hirshman, the bill represents yet
another government mandate that is going to make it harder for his
small business to compete with the Home Depots of the world.</TE>
<TE>   Next year, El Cajon Plumbing and Heating Supply will celebrate its
30th anniversary. But the business, a wholesaler of air-conditioning
and plumbing equipment that employs 20 people, is increasingly facing
pressure from so-called big-box retailers encroaching on its
clientele.</TE>
<TE>   Government regulations have been swelling the size of his payroll,
he said, and paid family leave would be yet another cost coming out
of his pocket.</TE>
<TE>   Small Firms May Suffer</TE>
<TE>   "It just makes the small-business man smaller," he said. "Any time
there is a piece of legislation that increases our outlay of money,
where are we going to make it up? It is not possible for us to pass
this along to consumers. We have to compete against Home Depot and
Lowe's these days."</TE>
<TE>   Though he sympathizes with people who find themselves in family
emergencies, Hirshman said they should be purchasing term life
insurance to deal with unexpected situations, not looking for a
solution from the government. A mandatory family leave program, he
contends, would be rife for abuse from unprincipled workers looking
for a paid vacation.</TE>
<TE>   Kuehl and other supporters say the measure limits the potential
for fraud by requiring workers to obtain written statements from
doctors about their relatives' illnesses. The measure would cover gay
and lesbian couples legally registered as domestic partners in
addition to spouses, and would also include time needed to assimilate
adopted and foster children.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, employers continue to have concerns about the
potential for abuse. They also point out that unlike the state's
current unpaid-leave law, which targets only businesses with 50 or
more workers, Kuehl's measure would apply to all businesses
regardless of size. And they worry that once it is established,
politicians will incrementally increase the employer contributions
with little public scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   "The issues have been around a long time. We've all compared it to
Europe, but we should also point out that Europe has not created too
many new jobs in the past 10 years," said Martyn Hopper of the
National Federation of Independent Business, which has 38,000 members
in California and has been sending fax alerts to them about the
legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike large corporations, which could relocate if they found
California's business climate to be hostile, "these small Main Street
businesses do not have the luxury of moving to Arizona," Hopper
added. "They are stuck."</TE>

<HD>CEO Assets Now a Debit for Cheney</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: His tenure atop Halliburton has become a liability
for the White House as corporate scandals unfold.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>When Dick Cheney left the private sector in August 2000 to become
George W. Bush's running mate, it looked as if everyone involved
would be coming out ahead.</LD>
<LD>   As chief executive of Halliburton Co., Cheney had transformed a
second-tier oilfield services firm into the industry's biggest
player. The Bush campaign regarded Cheney's corporate credentials as
an important election-year asset. Halliburton was on a roll, and its
shareholders were reaping the benefits--including Cheney, who cashed
in stock and options worth more than $30 million on his way to the
White House. It was, in his words, "a great success story."</LD>
<LD>   Two years later, it appears only Cheney is still showing a profit.</LD>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into possible
accounting irregularities at Halliburton during the Cheney years. A
1998 corporate acquisition orchestrated by Cheney has exposed the
Dallas-based company to huge asbestos liabilities. Halliburton's
stock has plummeted 76% since Cheney sold his shares, erasing all of
the gains recorded during his tenure and collapsing the company's
market value from $24 billion to $6 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The dark cloud hovering over the company appears to be undermining
the White House's credibility in responding to the rash of accounting
scandals and other corporate misdeeds.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, the stock sales that made Cheney a very wealthy man
appear to have been dictated largely by the need to divest his stake
in the company before assuming office in January 2001. And the jury
is still out on whether there was anything improper about the
accounting maneuvers being reviewed by the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   But Cheney seems to share one defining characteristic of ex-CEOs
whose actions are now under intense scrutiny: He became a millionaire
many times over by cashing in his stock options before problems came
to light and ordinary shareholders began losing their shirts.</TE>
<TE>   "Cheney is a microcosm of the challenge that this White House
faces on corporate accountability," said Kim Wallace, chief political
analyst for Lehman Bros., a Wall Street securities firm.</TE>
<TE>   The vice president is one of several Bush Cabinet members and
White House officials who came to the administration from corporate
America, and who sold their stakes near the stock market's peak. They
may have had little choice in the matter, but the windfalls they
enjoyed, and their seeming tardiness in pushing for crackdowns on
corporate wrongdoing, now are viewed with suspicion.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear that a majority of Americans believe the
administration is too close to big business," Wallace said. "That
makes it difficult for the White House to know which of these guys to
put in front of the camera to try to restore confidence.... Let's
face it, the White House is on the run on this."</TE>
<TE>   Some speculate that if the SEC inquiry finds that Halliburton
acted improperly, Cheney might become one of the first political
casualties of the corporate accounting scandals.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's going to be a push at some point to say, 'Look,
we need to do something about Cheney,' " said Paul C. Light, director
of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution, a centrist
think tank in Washington. "That may come sooner rather than later."</TE>
<TE>   Cheney's press secretary, Jennifer Millerwise, declined to comment
concerning Cheney's record at Halliburton. "The office of the vice
president is not and cannot work on Halliburton issues," Millerwise
said. "This is a matter pending before the SEC, and it would be
inappropriate for the vice president or our office to comment on the
specifics of an SEC inquiry." Millerwise said Cheney has not been
contacted by SEC officials.</TE>
<TE>   The vice president's defenders say it is unfair to blame Cheney
for all of the problems at Halliburton, though he served as CEO,
president and chairman of the board. They say he delegated day-to-day
management details to subordinates and could not have foreseen the
full extent of Halliburton's future calamities when he resigned from
the board Aug. 16, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   As Halliburton's CEO, company spokeswoman Wendy Hall said, Cheney
assumed a "make-it-happen" role and left it to others to implement
decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is it fair, supporters say, to suggest that Cheney sold his
Halliburton stock when he did because he knew trouble was looming. He
was under intense political pressure to sell his Halliburton holdings
before the November 2000 presidential election, and company officials
say he acted within a limited legal "window" in which he could sell
shares without violating insider-trading rules.</TE>
<TE>   Did Cheney's management of the company contribute to the dramatic
decline in the price of its shares? If so, it would call into
question his competence as a CEO, and thus whether he should have
been so richly rewarded.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Halliburton's stock swoon since Cheney's departure can be
attributed to broader market declines. The S&amp;P 500 index has tumbled
42% since Cheney left Halliburton; an index of 16 oil service firms
has fallen 43%.</TE>
<TE>   But industry analysts attribute as much as a third of
Halliburton's market decline to events that began to unfold while
Cheney was in charge but didn't surface until he left.</TE>
<TE>   About two months after Cheney sold his Halliburton stock, the
company announced that its Brown &amp; Root Services subsidiary had been
sued for allegedly overbilling the Army for work done at Ft. Ord,
Calif. About the same time, it warned analysts that costs were rising
and new orders were declining in its engineering and construction
units. Halliburton stock headed south, falling to $36 by year's end.</TE>
<TE>   Acquisition a Nightmare</TE>
<TE>   More damaging was the company's 1998 acquisition of cross-town
rival Dresser Industries.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney was instrumental in arranging the $7.7-billion merger,
which catapulted Halliburton from fourth to first place in oilfield
services. But along with Dresser's oil patch operations, Halliburton
inherited the legal liability for an asbestos brick-making business
Dresser had sold to another company six years earlier. The new owner
went bankrupt, and attorneys representing former employees began
aiming asbestos-related injury claims at Halliburton.</TE>
<TE>   Concerns about asbestos exposure reached a crescendo in December
2001, when Halliburton was socked with several multimillion-dollar
damage awards. After months of insisting that its liability was
relatively small, Halliburton announced Wednesday it is setting aside
$391 million to pay asbestos-related claims. The litigation charge
was the biggest factor in the $498-million loss it recorded for the
second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Mutalibov, an industry analyst for SWS Securities in Dallas,
said he thinks Halliburton stock, which closed Friday at $12.98 a
share, would be trading for about $26 if investors valued it as they
do other oilfield service firms. Of the $13 difference, he attributes
all but a dollar or two to the asbestos problem.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, what's depressing Halliburton stock is the asbestos
issue," Mutalibov said. "I don't think the SEC investigation has much
to do with the stock price decline."</TE>
<TE>   Cheney's defenders say the company exercised proper caution in
assessing its liabilities before proceeding with the Dresser
acquisition, and that no CEO could have anticipated the sequence of
events that left Halliburton holding the bag for a much bigger
asbestos liability than anyone anticipated four years ago. Although
the company knew it would have some legal vulnerability after
acquiring Dresser, it believed it had accurately projected the
potential liability and had adequate insurance to cover any claims it
might incur.</TE>
<TE>   "In hindsight, I'm sure Mr. Cheney wishes he wouldn't have bought
Dresser. But at the time, it was considered a very synergistic and
very positive acquisition," said James Wicklund, director of energy
research for Banc of America Securities. "All the due diligence that
could be done was done."</TE>
<TE>   Cheney's critics are less charitable. "Either he was woefully out
of touch, or he was involved in the decision-making that's caused all
these problems," said John E. Wall Jr., a Dallas attorney who
represents about 20 former Halliburton employees who were laid off
after the Dresser acquisition. "If you do your due diligence and the
lawyers don't tell you about this, you need to fire those lawyers."</TE>
<TE>   For the White House, however, the asbestos problem pales in
comparison to the political liability posed by the SEC's preliminary
inquiry of Halliburton's accounting.</TE>
<TE>   In late 1998, the company changed the way it accounted for cost
overruns on fixed-price contracts handled by its engineering and
construction units. In the past, it had waited until it knew for sure
it would be collecting the amounts in dispute before recording them
as revenue. Under the new procedure, it went ahead and booked the
revenue in advance if it felt that future collection was probable. It
didn't mention the change in its SEC filings until early 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Revenues Got a Boost</TE>
<TE>   The switch increased Halliburton's revenues by $98 million in
1999, $113 million in 2000 and $234 million last year. That is not
huge for a company with $13 billion in annual revenues, but it made
Halliburton appear more profitable than it would have been under the
old procedures.</TE>
<TE>   Halliburton's outside auditor at the time was Arthur Andersen,
convicted this year of obstruction of justice for shredding documents
dealing with accounting irregularities at Enron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Judicial Watch, a nonpartisan government watchdog group, has filed
a lawsuit accusing Cheney and Halliburton of defrauding investors by
using the new procedure to inflate the company's reported earnings.
It says what happened at Halliburton is no different from what
happened at companies such as WorldCom Inc., which used accounting
trickery to increase its reported profits.</TE>
<TE>   "The buck stops on Cheney's desk," Judicial Watch Chairman Larry
Klayman said. "He shouldn't be treated any different than other CEOs.
If we can break the taboo against going against the elite, then maybe
we'll have real accountability."</TE>
<TE>   Paul R. Brown, chairman of the accounting department at New York
University's Stern School of Business, said not enough information
has been made public to determine whether Halliburton broke the
rules.</TE>
<TE>   "The verdict is out at this point," Brown said. "It really comes
down to an issue of how good they are at assessing the probability of
collecting on these cost-overrun claims. It's an acceptable
accounting practice, but only if they can make reasonable and fairly
determinable estimates."</TE>
<TE>   Veteran shareholder advocate Nell Minow said she thinks the
examination of Cheney's record at Halliburton holds more potential
peril for the White House than the scrutiny of Bush's actions at
Harken Energy Corp. a decade earlier. Bush was an outside director,
while Cheney was the man in charge, she noted. The SEC looked into
Bush's actions long ago and concluded there were no grounds to accuse
him of wrongdoing, but the outcome of the Halliburton inquiry remains
uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   "At the very worst, they could find fraud, and people could be
prohibited from ever being affiliated with a public company, and
people could go to jail, and he could have to leave office," Minow
said. "It could be a huge problem, and I'm sure they're spending a
lot of time calculating exactly what the fallout is likely to be and
how best to handle it."</TE>

<HD>Depleted Investors Also Losing Nerve</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: The market drop has damaged psyches as '90s
riches have largely vanished.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Screenwriter Jason Squire is rewriting his script. So is the American
investor.</LD>
<LD>   For Squire, on the faculty at USC's School of Cinema-Television,
the fixes were relatively simple. After a recent week of triple-digit
losses for the Dow Jones industrial average, Squire and his writing
partner changed a major character in their action-adventure yarn from
a hotshot trader to an unemployed victim of corporate America.</LD>
<LD>   "In movies you have to reflect the sensibility of the times,"
Squire said.</LD>
<TE>   For American investors, however, altering their financial script
hasn't been as easy. Their story, spun from the stratospheric returns
of the late 1990s, was supposed to have a happy ending. Early
retirement. Travel. An estate, perhaps, to leave their children.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the tale has turned bitter and painful for many investors
as they struggle with a new plot twist of quickly diminishing riches.
A recession, terrorist attacks, and most recently a series of
corporate scandals have ravaged the market highs of 2000. In fewer
than three years, the Dow has lost more than a quarter of its peak
value, while the Nasdaq has plunged by more than two-thirds.</TE>
<TE>   On a superficial level, the reversal of fortune has recast
everything from cocktail party conversation to future investment
strategies. But on a deeper psychological plane, the stress on some
investors has been so great that it has generated an unprecedented
wealth of blame, recriminations and denial in their personal and
professional lives.</TE>
<TE>   "In the last two weeks, I've gotten more new clients than I would
normally get in two or three months," said James W. Gottfurcht,
president of Psychology Money Consultants, a Los Angeles-based
psychotherapy and executive coaching firm. "And it's all due to the
stock market."</TE>
<TE>   When the going got tough in recent weeks, about a fifth of
investors got going on sticking their heads in the sand, according to
financial experts. Some investors believe that with a properly
diversified portfolio, a wait-it-out approach is a legitimate
investment plan. But others admit they weren't looking at their
bottom lines because they just couldn't bear to look upon the
financial ruins.</TE>
<TE>   Jenny Verhines of Marina del Rey, who deliberately avoids market
news on the Internet, newspapers and television, won't even open her
quarterly statements. "It's so depressing," said the 40-year-old
accountant. "Why would I want to open them up? It's all bad. Just
bad."</TE>
<TE>   Those brave enough to track their investments often wish they
hadn't. After ignoring her last batch of quarterly statements, Leanne
Barney, a legal secretary who works in downtown Los Angeles, steeled
her nerve to see her bottom line--it's about $20,000 lower than it
used to be.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll never be able to retire now," said the 45-year-old San
Gabriel Valley resident, only half-jokingly. "At least, not when I
was planning to."</TE>
<TE>   Despite a one-day upswing Wednesday, the market shakeup has
diminished the nation's passion for stock crawl--the constant stream
of updated stock quotes across the television screen. Financial news
network CNBC has seen its peak ratings in March 2000 of 418,000
viewers a day plummet to a little more than 225,000 in April, May and
June of this year.</TE>
<TE>   'It Felt Like Gambling'</TE>
<TE>   It was only a few years ago that private investor Kim Brizzolara
was a crawl-watcher, among other things, as she pored over Internet
and television news of her considerable holdings. Although she held
mostly traditional stocks such as General Electric, she finally
succumbed to tech fever near the market peak and bought such
high-fliers as Global Crossing, Lucent Technologies and JDS Uniphase.</TE>
<TE>   "I was obsessed," recalled Brizzolara, who serves on the board of
directors for the Hamptons International Film Festival in New York.
"I remember I was staying with my boyfriend's parents in Nantucket
one weekend and I watched CNBC for hours. It was insane.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt like gambling, like you had some control over this, and
you were winning," said the Manhattan resident.</TE>
<TE>   Brizzolara estimates she lost "hundreds of thousands of dollars"
and her once constant stock watch habits fell faster than shares of
WorldCom Inc. "I check my stocks once a day at most now and if
there's been a bad day, I won't look at the gain or loss column," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Avoidance of relentlessly grim news isn't surprising, according to
Maury Elvekrog, a psychologist and investment manager in Bloomfield
Hills, Mich. "People tend to conclude their experience is reality,"
said Elvekrog, a market investor for 47 years. "If you buy a stock at
a certain price, that makes it seem like that's what the stock is
worth, especially if you paid a lot of money for it. So when the
price comes down, you think, 'This can't be. This isn't reality. I'll
close my eyes and things will come back to normal.' "</TE>
<TE>   But the compulsion to watch the financial train wreck--especially
one's own--can be as powerful as the desire to turn away, according
to financial experts. Since the downturn, some viewers are newly
transfixed to television financial news as never before, and others
suddenly can't chat enough about the decline. John Nofsinger, an
assistant professor of finance at Washington State University,
noticed such a change in his administrative assistant, who is close
to retirement age.</TE>
<TE>   "She has talked about the stock market every single day for the
past month," said Nofsinger, author of the recent "Investment
Blunders (of the Rich and Famous) ... and What You Can Learn From
Them."</TE>
<TE>   " 'Why is it going down? When will it come back up?' She'd even
talk about specific stocks and she'd never mentioned those even in
the '90s."</TE>
<TE>   Reversal of Fortune</TE>
<TE>   Anyone other than Wall Street types talking stocks at the office
was a rarity only a decade ago. But as 401(k) retirement plans became
more common in the workplace and as the bull market of the late '90s
began taking off, more than 60% of Americans eventually became
acquainted with the once esoteric world of investing, according to
Nofsinger. They devoured stock news from newsletters, radio and
television and learned to distinguish a P/E ratio from an index fund.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a huge socialization process that really turned investing
into almost a sport," said Nofsinger. "Instead of talking about the
new football halfback this season, people were telling stories about
the new hot product coming out." But such talk, so common at backyard
barbecues and cocktail parties only three years ago, has all but
stopped. The bright, cheery and oftentimes self-congratulatory
chatter has been chewed up by forecasts of gloom and doom.</TE>
<TE>   Now battered investors are doing more than just complaining,
they're pointing fingers as well.</TE>
<TE>   In fewer arenas was the blame game more fierce than divorce court,
according to family law attorneys. Financial woes are always on the
short list for overstressing a relationship, but the stock market
tumble has pushed, or at least accelerated, some couples to divorce,
say attorneys. The typical dynamic, they say, has the husband
stubbornly refusing to sell stocks, while the wife screams "I told
you so."</TE>
<TE>   "It gets pretty ugly," said Robert J. Nachshin, a family law
attorney in Los Angeles. "You get one spouse shouting, 'You
something, something idiot, you should have sold Qualcomm or Broadcom
or Microsoft years ago.' "</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, as the accusations fly, the couple's portfolio
continues to shrink, leaving a lot less to split. "If you're the
income earner, now is a great time to get divorced," added Nachshin.</TE>
<TE>   Diving stocks have strained friendships as well. During the bull
market many "insiders" passed along hot stock tips that ultimately
didn't pan out. Jeff Lubs, a math and science teacher at a Manhattan
Beach middle school, finally bought a telecom stock after being
badgered by a friend, whose husband worked for the company.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I'd see her she'd say, 'It's going up and up, you've
got to jump in,' " said Lubs. "So, finally, I did."</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after buying Irvine-based Incomnet at $23 per share, the
plunge began. Within a few months, it dropped to $8. A few more
months, it was down to $1. Today, the stock is worth around a penny
per share, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "She was like, 'Oh, sorry about that,' " he said. "I don't say a
word about it." While Lubs lost virtually his entire $1,200
investment, the friendship has endured.</TE>
<TE>   In the search for someone to blame, the corporate scandals have
suddenly provided investors a real, if convenient, villain. The
average investor, no matter how much research he did, was never going
to uncover the deceit and malfeasance occurring in some of the
nation's largest businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "What investors are really saying is they're not to blame," said
Nofsinger. "They're trying to absolve themselves of any guilt."</TE>
<TE>   A Bubble Bursts</TE>
<TE>   But most investors registered the bulk of their losses before the
scandals at Enron, WorldCom and Adelphia broke, say financial
experts. Greed got the better of investors who forgot about their
risk tolerance years ago and now have only themselves to blame.</TE>
<TE>   "We were riding the dot-com bubble and many investors got
speculative fever," said Patrick Gregory, an assistant professor of
finance at Bentley College near Boston. "They didn't do the hard-core
analysis you need to do ... as a result, they got burned."</TE>
<TE>   While the Women's Evangelical Progressive Investment Club (WE PIC,
for short) has borne its portfolio losses like everyone else, it
could have been much, much worse, according to club president
Margaret Nead. In 1999, a club member urged the admittedly
conservative group--all over 40 church-going women from Orange
County--to "buy, buy, buy" tech stocks, recalled Nead. The strategy
was voted down at the club's monthly meeting spot, a Coco's
restaurant in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't really squabble about the proposal," said Nead, a
50-year-old preschool teacher from Orange. "I guess you could say we
got passive-aggressive. We were just silent."</TE>
<TE>   Today, only one of the club's nine stocks are in the tech sector,
she said. And the tech-backer eventually led a slow exodus of members
from the club--she was one of half a dozen who left when the market
started declining. The club, which collects $25 per month from each
member for its investment fund, is now down to 10. The declining
market has just taken the fun out of investing for some in the group,
said Nead.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, some financial experts say the scars of this
roller-coaster ride may already be keeping investors from a good
buying opportunity. This market is a reverse mirror of the bull
market of the '90s, contend some. "Irrational exuberance," as Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has noted, may have overblown the
bubble, but irrational fear may keep this one depressed longer than
is warranted. Inflation, unemployment and interest rates are at or
near historic lows, and in spite of the rash of scandals, corporate
America is still making profits.</TE>
<TE>   Investors have "seen their 401(k) reduced to a 201(k). They have
been ground down and worn out by this market," said Victoria Collins,
a certified financial planner and author of numerous money management
books. "But there is [still] a disconnect between Wall Street and
Main Street."</TE>
<TE>   But if the markets dive much deeper over the next couple of years,
other experts think this generation might react just as their parents
and grandparents did to the financial calamity of their day.</TE>
<TE>   "The generation from the Great Depression ended up putting their
money under their mattress," said Nofsinger. "And though I think
we're a ways off from it, we may see some investors of today
permanently put off from the markets and opt to park their money in
an ordinary savings account."</TE>

<KH>RESCUE AT QUECREEK</KH>
<HD>Under the Ground, 9 Miners Hoped and Despaired--and Penned
Farewells</HD>
<DH>Rescue: The men describe the struggle to keep the faith
amid rising, frigid water.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN and GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>QUECREEK, Pa.</DL>
<LD>They wrote goodbye letters on scraps of cardboard they had found in
the mineshaft. They placed the notes in a bucket, sealed it with tape
and hooked it to a piece of equipment in case rescuers were too late.</LD>
<LD>   Over the next 72 hours, their hopes rose and fell like the level
of the frigid water that had trapped them 240 feet beneath the
Earth's surface.</LD>
<LD>   These were nine hard-bitten men who among them had spent more than
a century underground, men not prone to displays of emotion. But they
clung to one another for comfort and warmth, and talked tearfully
about such things as the last words they had shared with their wives.</LD>
<TE>   Blaine Mayhugh, the youngest of the crew at 31, winced at the
thought Sunday. In 5 1/2 years of deep-mine work, he had never failed
to kiss his wife before hopping in his pickup and heading off.</TE>
<TE>   "I always give my wife and kids a kiss, because you never know,"
he said. But on Wednesday, Leslie was mowing the lawn and Mayhugh was
in a hurry. "I waved to her down in the yard and said: 'I love you,'
" he recalled. That hurried farewell "was one of the first things I
thought of when we were trapped."</TE>
<TE>   Mayhugh and his wife kissed again early Sunday after he and his
eight colleagues were hoisted out of the Quecreek Mine at the
culmination of one of the most dramatic mining rescues in the
nation's history. Six of the men were released from area hospitals
Sunday in remarkably good health. Only three were being kept
overnight for minor treatment and observation.</TE>
<TE>   Millions of Americans followed the drama as it unfolded above the
surface over the last three days. But on Sunday, the miners began
providing the first details of the harrowing events underground.</TE>
<TE>   At times, they worked frantically, probing for possible escape
routes and building makeshift walls in desperate attempts to keep the
water out. At times they slumped together in despair, certain that
they would not survive.</TE>
<TE>   None had hesitated to enter the shaft that day when they started
their eight-hour shift about 3 p.m. But several now say they will
never go back.</TE>
<TE>   The moment their lives changed came about 8:30 p.m., when Mark
"Moe" Popernack--the crew's operator--was making a 35-foot cut into a
seam of coal. But he breached the wall of an unmapped, abandoned
mine, and millions of gallons of water burst through.</TE>
<TE>   "Moe hollered at me, 'Harpo, get out of here,' " Dennis "Harpo"
Hall, 49, said. "The water was so furious; it was so intense. You
wouldn't believe it." Minutes after the water rushed in, Hall made
his way to a telephone to warn another group of miners. "Get out," he
said. "I mean now. We've got major water."</TE>
<TE>   Those men who narrowly escaped credit Hall with saving their
lives; they say he's a hero. But Hall shrugs off their praise. "I was
just doing my job," he said Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The nine who were trapped worked for hours searching for a way
out. They knocked down walls to open other shafts in vain attempts to
lower the water level, at times so deep that they had to turn their
heads to the side to keep from drowning.</TE>
<TE>   Several, including Mayhugh, pressed on toward the main
entrance--which required traveling downstream--but they had to stop
when the rising water closed off the escape route. At times, the
current seemed unconquerable.</TE>
<TE>   "For a second, I said, 'Blaine, let it go; let it take you,' "
Mayhugh said. Then he steeled himself, saying, "Damn it, I've got a
wife and kids. I got mad."</TE>
<TE>   He and the others dragged themselves back against the current,
toward higher ground farther into the shaft, by pulling themselves
along the conveyor belt that carries out the coal.</TE>
<TE>   Popernack was separated from the rest of the group for the first
several hours. It was the crew boss, Randy Fogle, 48, who found
Popernack and brought him back.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, 52-year-old Tommy Foy, the crew mechanic and
Mayhugh's father-in-law, bound the group together with a metal cord
looped through their belts so that if the water kept rising and they
died, they wouldn't float away from one another.</TE>
<TE>   The men spent several hours searching for a haven. By early
Thursday, they had made their way to what was essentially a
subterranean beach, a 40-by-20-foot area where the soil was soggy but
there was no standing water.</TE>
<TE>   Fogle directed the men to build barricade walls out of
cinderblocks they had found in the mine to help keep the water out.
"We worked frantically to build the walls," Hall said. "It was to
keep the water off us as long as we could until we could be rescued."</TE>
<TE>   The men got their first glimmer of hope that a rescue might be
imminent when crews on the surface punched a 6-inch shaft down into
an air pocket near where they were waiting. The miners rushed to the
pipe and struck it with a hammer nine times--nine clangs that
resonated to the surface, signaling that all the men were alive and
boosting the spirits of their loved ones.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after that, maybe an hour, the water came up again and the
miners had to head to higher ground, Mayhugh said. For the next few
days, they would repeatedly try to send signals--pounding on a metal
plate holding up the soil over their heads--but none of that was
heard on the surface.</TE>
<TE>   The miners could hear the enormous drill burrowing toward them
from above, but their spirits sagged with every pause--particularly
Friday, when drilling stopped for about 18 hours because the 30-inch
bit broke and rescuers had trouble fishing it out of the shaft.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought maybe they couldn't find us, or maybe they just broke
down," Mayhugh said. "We didn't know what to think."</TE>
<TE>   Friday's delay was also a low point for family members, who spent
the bulk of the three-day ordeal at a nearby fire station, hanging on
every update from the rescue operation.</TE>
<TE>   "I kind of lost my faith and started thinking my son is not coming
home," said Margie Mayhugh, Blaine's mother. Margie said she never
approved of her son working in the deep mines, and forbade him from
so much as mentioning it in her presence.</TE>
<TE>   But Mayhugh had taken the job because it paid well. "For this
area, the money's good," he said. "I wanted my kids to have stuff.
Around here, you're talking $7 an hour [for most jobs]; it's $15 an
hour underground."</TE>
<TE>   When they got news of the accident Wednesday, Mayhugh's parents
feared the worst. When his pickup was retrieved from the mine site
and parked at the fire station, Mayhugh's father, also named Blaine,
rubbed its paint gently as if it were his son's face. Mayhugh's
sister Pam opened the lunchbox inside the cab to see whether her
brother had eaten the day of the accident--he had. But Margie
wouldn't go near the truck.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, one of the biggest challenges underground was keeping
warm. The miners, coughing in the stale air, sought out the highest
ground they could find and then huddled together, side-by-side and
back-to-back.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything to produce body heat," Mayhugh said.</TE>
<TE>   In the first hours, the miners had grabbed a case of water, about
six gallons, so they did not have to drink the water flowing through
the mine, which was full of coal dust. They had no food, except some
Lifesavers and a single sandwich, which they shared.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the men lost their tins of chewing tobacco in the
water, so by early Thursday, they ran out. "Local miners like to chew
snuff underground," Hall said. "There was a major shortage. It wasn't
funny to us. It put nerves on end."</TE>
<TE>   The men spent much of their ordeal in complete darkness,
preserving two functioning headlights for the hoped-for rescue. They
also paid close attention to the drone of the rescue effort above,
and would periodically dispatch a two-man team to trudge through the
water to a cavity a few hundred feet away where the drill was
descending. About 10 p.m. Saturday, Foy and another miner, Ron
Hileman, shouted back to the rest of the crew that the drill had
finally burst through.</TE>
<TE>   The other seven men rushed to what would become their escape shaft
and shouted wildly. Shortly thereafter, they heard clear signals on
the nearby air tube. Hileman, 49, beat on it in reply, and then the
pipe disappeared. Just before 11 p.m., a microphone and a neon green
light came down in its place.</TE>
<TE>   John "Flathead" Phillipi, the miner who sent the first message to
the surface, took the opportunity to ask for some snuff. Shortly
before 1 a.m. Sunday, the rescue capsule--filled with blankets,
jackets, water and snuff--arrived.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a lovely sight," Hall said with a smile Sunday. "Everybody
wanted to get in at once. But there was only room for one."</TE>
<TE>   Fogle, who was suffering from chest pain, would go first. Mayhugh
was second. Hall was the seventh man to reach the surface, about 2:20
a.m. Shortly after, they had all been pulled from the mine.</TE>
<TE>   The letters they had written in the first hours of the ordeal were
left behind.</TE>
<TE>   The men were taken to two hospitals, where they were reunited with
their families. Mayhugh embraced his wife and said his first words to
her were: "It's a miracle. I'll never go back in again." Leslie's
father, Tommy Foy--who has a history of heart trouble and ulcers--was
kept overnight at the hospital, where he made a similar pledge to his
daughter.</TE>
<TE>   But for other members of the crew, the mines already beckon. Just
hours after the trauma was over, Hall said he was already preparing
to go back.</TE>
<TE>   "Truthfully, I don't cherish the fact of going back," Hall said.
"But I've been doing it 30 years. It's in my blood. I have a family
to take care of. You do what you have to do."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>   Since Sept. 11, the FBI has budgeted tens of millions of dollars
to turn its massive collection of computerized case files, memos,
tips and phone intercepts from an investigative black hole into a
mother lode of predictive intelligence.</LD>
<LD>   If the effort succeeds, by Sept. 11, 2004, it will have replaced
today's system--so antiquated and cumbersome that many top FBI
executives have never learned to use it--with a high-tech brain that
instantly culls years of records and eventually will simultaneously
check databanks in other government agencies, public records and the
Internet.</LD>
<TE>   And that's just the beginning.</TE>
<TE>   By Sept. 11, 2011, the FBI hopes to use artificial-intelligence
software to predict acts of terrorism the way the telepathic
"precogs" in the movie "Minority Report" foresee murders before they
take place.</TE>
<TE>   The goal is to "skate where the puck's going to be, not where the
puck was," said Robert J. Chiaradio, who until recently oversaw data
system improvements as a top aide to FBI Director Robert S. Mueller
III. "We have to get ourselves positioned for Sept. 10, not Sept.
12."</TE>
<TE>   The technology plan reflects a belief that the chief weapon
against terrorism will not be bullets or bombs. It will be
information.</TE>
<TE>   But intelligence experts, computer scientists and civil
libertarians remain skeptical about whether the FBI can--or
should--reverse 94 years of entrenched bias in favor of shoe-leather
detective work, and turn itself into a high-tech domestic CIA. And
they caution that using databases to foretell acts of terrorism is
still a science fiction fantasy.</TE>
<TE>   "These techniques assume that the past predicts the future," said
Rakesh Agrawal, an IBM Corp. scientist and a leading "data mining"
expert. "But what if the future is completely different?"</TE>
<TE>   Before Sept. 11, no one had crashed a hijacked plane into a
skyscraper. Before Jan. 27, when a blast ripped through Jerusalem's
commercial district, there had never been a female suicide bomber.</TE>
<TE>   FBI leaders insist that effective data mining--sifting
investigative knowledge from voluminous electronic files--will
overcome such obstacles.</TE>
<TE>   They point out that rudimentary data mining already has become
commonplace. Any Internet user can instantly search more than a
billion Web pages for, say, "Middle Eastern flight-training
students." The popular search service Google ranks results by
popularity--pages that receive the most visits and are most often
referenced by other pages are listed first--one formula for making
sense of more information than a person can digest.</TE>
<TE>   Retail stores analyze data on millions of purchases, then draw
conclusions on buying habits to pitch discounts or new products.</TE>
<TE>   "Just as Wal-Mart's trying to figure out what people's buying
patterns are, some of that logic can translate into law enforcement,"
said Mark Tanner, the FBI's deputy chief information officer.</TE>
<TE>   Broad Changes Needed</TE>
<TE>   But to get there will require sweeping changes. Today at the FBI,
a comprehensive electronic search requires separate checks of 42
databanks of case files, memos, video footage, mug shots and
fingerprints. It's as different from Google as the Web is from
government-issue file cabinets, where 1 billion FBI documents still
reside.</TE>
<TE>   That will soon change, FBI leaders promise. In the next fiscal
year alone, the FBI has requested $76 million to combine and enhance
its databases, on top of $730 million more previously budgeted for
"Trilogy"--code name for a general technology upgrade, the third try
after two failed efforts. The bureau says it will replace paper files
and inefficient text-only electronic databases with a "virtual case
file" system that will allow rapid, Web browser-like views of video,
photos and sounds.</TE>
<TE>   Though technologically feasible, that goal remains distant, given
the bureau's primitive technology.</TE>
<TE>   "When I came in I said I wanted it done in a year," Mueller told a
Senate committee in June. Now he estimates two to three years. "We do
not have the data warehousing, we do not have the software
applications [for this] kind of searching."</TE>
<TE>   Still, within the FBI, Mueller is widely viewed as having a better
grasp of technology than his predecessor, Louis J. Freeh, and greater
drive to make changes--especially after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "They're on the right track," said Nancy Savage, head of the FBI
Agents' Assn. Unlike earlier failed technology efforts, she said,
Mueller has involved field agents in the planning and testing.</TE>
<TE>   As a model, experts point to the Defense Department's Global
Command and Control System, an immensely complex and far-flung system
that analyzes intelligence data, satellite imagery, troop movements,
weapon status and a multitude of other inputs from all over the
world, yet operates efficiently and effectively. Unlike typical
government data systems, built from scratch, the Command and Control
system is built largely from off-the-shelf commercial hardware and
software and took less than two years to build in the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   After the FBI gets its data systems operating, it will try to tie
them to information held in the databanks of other agencies or
private entities that may prove crucial in rooting out terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   For example, by combing different agencies' records, the FBI could
find a person who was denied a visa, took a flying lesson and may be
moving next door to a suspected terrorist. An automated process would
connect the information "for an analyst to say, 'Hey look, here's
three clues,' " Chiaradio said.</TE>
<TE>   That process is technically challenging because it involves many
systems that use incompatible software and divergent methods to label
and organize information.</TE>
<TE>   But similarly connected databases are becoming commonplace in the
corporate world and gradually are being adopted in the intelligence
community, according to private data-mining contractors such as
Presearch Inc. and Veridian Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The National Security Agency has linked about 20 disparate
databases containing human intelligence, electronic eavesdropping
files, pictures and sounds using software from Webmethods Inc., said
Len Pomata, a company executive. Pilot projects within NSA and the
Transportation Security Administration are now linking such data to
public records, such as real estate ownership and marriage and death
certificates, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Systems can even be designed to track missing data, said James H.
Vaules, a former FBI executive who heads the National Fraud Center, a
data-mining subsidiary of Lexis-Nexis.</TE>
<TE>   "A lack of information is probably the [biggest] red flag," he
said. "If you are 40 years old and there are no public records on you
in this country, then there's something up--it just doesn't happen."</TE>
<TE>   Effort Was 'Pipe Dream'</TE>
<TE>   The FBI has coveted such abilities since the 1980s--investing
substantial time and resources without success, according to
officials familiar with the project. The entire effort was "a pipe
dream," said an agent who declined to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   But data-mining developments are beginning to produce predictive
abilities--such as banks scanning credit card purchases for anomalies
that suggest fraudulent transactions.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI says such techniques will preempt terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "There was not a specific warning [before Sept. 11] about an
attack on a particular day. But that doesn't mean that there weren't
... dots that should have been connected," Mueller said in May.</TE>
<TE>   But systems that make sense of highly varied inputs are still in
their infancy, independent experts say.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the NSA may be able to find a photo of a cargo plane
and an intercepted flight plan but not know what the plane carried,
even if the flight manifest was accessible. Every scanned document,
film clip and photo must be labeled with multiple codes to allow
efficient searches--and to compare data, the labels must be
consistent. To a computer, "occupation" and "employment category" are
not necessarily equivalent.</TE>
<TE>   The scope of that task will be staggering, given the volume of
terrorism materials in question. Prosecutors in the case of Zacarias
Moussaoui, allegedly the 20th Sept. 11 hijacker, declined to print
out discovery material for the defendant, because the documents
"would leave no room for Mr. Moussaoui in his cell ... and might even
consume the entire jail."</TE>
<TE>   Yet the bureau proposes to sift thousands of times as much data as
a matter of routine.</TE>
<TE>   Chiaradio said the biggest challenge will not be handling huge
volumes of information but securing it.</TE>
<TE>   "Do we want to bet that our technology is going to be one day
ahead of a 13-year-old in Alabama who's getting into the system and
beating it?" Chiaradio said. "It's a business risk that eventually
the director or somebody is going to have to" take.</TE>
<TE>   And internal spies or interagency leaks pose additional security
problems.</TE>
<TE>   "The more people who have access to that information, the surer it
is to leak," said Michael Vatis, director of the FBI's cyber-crime
unit.</TE>
<TE>   Mindful of the damage that FBI spy Robert Philip Hanssen caused by
navigating intelligence files, several senators say they are
concerned that the FBI may be leaning too far toward an open system
in an effort to make files more accessible to all agents.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) said at a recent Senate hearing that
the FBI should keep a separate system for sensitive intelligence
data--available only on a need-to-know basis.</TE>
<TE>   Yet in a technical sense, security problems may seem trivial
compared with the challenge of developing artificial-intelligence
methods that can generate knowledge to stop terrorism before it
occurs.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI is seeking pattern-recognition algorithms that can discern
hints of terrorism from what Jeffrey D. Ullman, professor of computer
science at Stanford University, calls "the soup of billions of
possible coincidences."</TE>
<TE>   Instead of needing the right question, an analyst would merely say
"show me something out there that looks odd," and get, say, a report
about an influx of Middle Eastern men in flight training, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But anticipating acts of terrorism by sorting billions of records
with unknown relevance to unknown future attackers is incomparably
more difficult than detecting credit card fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Ullman called predictive data mining "one of the fundamental
research problems of the age," comparing it to the Manhattan Project,
which produced the atomic bomb during World War II. He said it would
require an investment of at least $1 billion to accomplish the
ultimate goal--"preventing a terrorist group from carrying a nuclear
bomb into this country and setting it off."</TE>
<TE>   Key Departures</TE>
<TE>   Even more modest goals may have been placed in doubt by recent
departures of key executives. Bob Dies, a former IBM executive who
was the FBI's technology visionary, retired in the spring. He has not
been replaced. Chiaradio, appointed to manage the FBI technology
transition, also left in June, joining the accounting firm KPMG after
only six months on the job.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, President Bush has slated the FBI's cyber-crime unit to
move to the new Homeland Security Department.</TE>
<TE>   "That would be a major loss to the FBI," said Vatis, the unit's
founder. "One of the things we were successful at doing was building
a cadre of technical expertise both in headquarters ... and in the
field offices."</TE>
<TE>   Members of Congress have grown impatient over missteps on far less
ambitious projects than today's proposals. Fingerprint computers and
other law-enforcement data systems have cost more than $1.7 billion
since 1993--yet still don't operate reliably.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) recently called the FBI's current
system "fossil technology," and Mueller's two- to three-year estimate
for minimal database efficiency "unacceptable."</TE>
<TE>   Testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee this month,
Sherry Higgins, the FBI's project management executive, acknowledged
that "the problems ... didn't occur overnight and they won't be fixed
overnight either. That is because it is more important to get it
right and know that we have the systems and capabilities that
precisely fit our mission, as well as cure past problems."</TE>
<TE>   Despite repeated requests from The Times, the FBI was unable or
unwilling to detail its plans for technology spending, or to clarify
the relationships among its many technology projects.</TE>
<TE>   Civil libertarians charge that the FBI faces a crisis of
competence that sophisticated new technology will only
exacerbate--more deeply burying the bureau in information. Already
awash in data, the FBI has not even updated its Web-based wanted
posters of leading terrorists. The section on Osama bin Laden makes
no mention of Sept. 11 and the Web site still lists Bin Laden
lieutenant Mohammed Atef as at large, although he was reportedly
killed in November.</TE>
<TE>   Documents released in May under the Freedom of Information Act
showed that the FBI's "Carnivore" program, which monitors e-mail in
criminal probes, had inadvertently gobbled unrelated messages--a
violation of privacy laws. When the error was discovered, an FBI
technician destroyed the entire data file, including e-mail from
presumed terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "The buck really stops at the FBI for their failure to properly
analyze the information they had before Sept. 11," said Marc
Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information
Center, the advocacy group that obtained the FBI documents. He called
the surge of interest in data mining "sleight of hand" designed to
distract focus away from the bureau's failures.</TE>
<TE>   FBI executives agree that there should be some limit on database
surveillance. But they insist that a national crisis warrants a shift
in the balance between security and privacy.</TE>
<TE>   Critics should ask, "How can we create civil liberties protections
that don't get in the way of fighting terrorists?" said Stewart
Baker, a Washington attorney and former general counsel for the
National Security Agency.</TE>
<TE>   He suggested that database abuses can be prevented with automated
audit controls. "One way to protect civil liberties is to make people
prepare to justify how they use the systems," Baker said.</TE>
<TE>   Problems of Accuracy</TE>
<TE>   Yet no matter how careful the FBI is, it faces a larger question
about the accuracy of records. "Garbage in, garbage out," the old
computer adage goes. The accuracy of all kinds of data held by the
government or corporations--as victims of identity theft have
learned, to their dismay--is highly suspect.</TE>
<TE>   Deep within complex databases, errors can rapidly eclipse reality,
as a 1999 Justice Department audit showed.</TE>
<TE>   In a Department of Justice review of an FBI database of 93,000
Florida civil service job applicants, about 12% of those who had
criminal records were not detected, while nearly 6% of applicants
with no criminal record were identified as criminals.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, just as spies create false personas, the Sept. 11
hijackers evaded detection, in part, by setting up bank accounts
using false Social Security numbers. Such moves to pollute the data
stream suggest a flaw in the logic of data mining, skeptics say.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who are the greatest threats are already conducting
themselves in such a way that they fall into the most innocuous
profiles," said Edward Tenner, author of "Why Things Bite Back:
Technology and the Revenge of Unintended Consequences."</TE>
<TE>   "The question is not whether innovations in artificial
intelligence are worth trying," he said. "The real issue is the
opportunity cost--the other things that experienced investigators
could be doing with their time," such as figuring out how to
infiltrate Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Fear of terrorism, the FBI's detractors suggest, has already
pushed database research into the realm of the absurd--where
innocuous behavior, or even the failure to leave an electronic trail,
can arouse suspicion.</TE>
<TE>   "That would be one of the most damaging things terrorism could do
to us," Tenner said.</TE>

<HD>Ukraine Arrests 4 in Air Show Crash</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Four top Ukrainian air force officers were arrested Sunday on
suspicion of negligence in a disastrous air show accident in which an
SU-27 fighter jet hurtled pilotless to the ground and killed 83
spectators.</LD>
<LD>   The officers, including the commander of Ukraine's air force, Col.
Gen. Viktor Strelnikov, were blamed for lax safety standards that
permitted the jet to fly low over spectators during the air show
Saturday in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv.</LD>
<LD>   Ukrainian President Leonid D. Kuchma fired Strelnikov and another
officer Saturday and sacked his military chief of staff Sunday.
Defense Minister Volodymyr Shkidchenko offered to resign over the air
show disaster, the deadliest on record.</LD>
<TE>   The plane's two pilots, who ejected from the plane before it
crashed but suffered spinal injuries, were interviewed by
investigators, who said they found "serious deficiencies" in the
organization of the air show.</TE>
<TE>   The political fallout came as distraught relatives scoured
hospitals and morgues for loved ones missing after the accident. Many
searched in vain, as officials struggled to identify bodies slashed
to pieces in the disaster, which also left 116 people injured.</TE>
<TE>   Yevhen Marchuk, head of the government commission investigating
the crash, said Sunday that the probe was taking two directions. "The
first version is negligence on the part of the senior air force
command. The second version is that the plane failed," Marchuk said.</TE>
<TE>   Aviation analysts in Ukraine and Russia raised questions about
inadequate servicing in Ukraine's impoverished air force and why the
pilots were flying difficult stunts directly over spectators.</TE>
<TE>   Interfax quoted a Ukrainian Defense Ministry spokesman as saying
the SU-27 had been in service 15 years and that spare parts for it
had never been bought.</TE>
<TE>   Underscoring the poor air safety record in the former Soviet
Union, an IL-86 crashed on takeoff from Moscow's Sheremetyevo-1
Airport on Sunday, killing 14 of the 16 crew members aboard. The
plane was not carrying passengers. Early reports suggested engine
failure was the cause.</TE>
<TE>   Two flight attendants survived, one with head injuries and the
other with scratches and bruises.</TE>
<TE>   The two planes involved in the weekend crashes were seen as among
the safest of Soviet-designed aircraft. Until Sunday, the IL-86,
which carries 350 passengers, had never crashed.</TE>
<TE>   In Lviv, a criminal case was opened into the air show disaster.
Air force commander Strelnikov and Sergei Onishchenko, commander of
the 14th Air Corps, faced possible charges of military negligence,
and two other officers faced possible charges of abusing aviation
rules.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said the SU-27 executed two low passes but, during a
third pass, the engines stopped roaring and the plane floundered in
eerie silence before hitting the ground and flipping along the
tarmac.</TE>
<TE>   Nikolai T. Antoshkin, former deputy commander of the Russian air
force, used to organize dozens of air shows in the Soviet Union each
year.</TE>
<TE>   "There are rules and safety regulations. Whatever happened to the
plane, it should not have landed in the middle of the crowd of
people. It should have been flown to a safe area," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "All pilots know that they must direct the plane away from the
people even if they die. There is always a different place to crash
than into a group of women and children."</TE>
<TE>   Igor Votintsev, chief pilot with the Sukhoi Design Bureau, which
designed the SU-27, ruled out any possibility that both engines
stalled.</TE>
<TE>   "There may be plenty of reasons why the pilots lost control of the
plane and crashed, but engine failure is the least likely one," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the spectators should not have been allowed to wander
around the airfield.</TE>
<TE>   "There would not have been any deaths if precautions had been
properly taken, if special areas for spectators had been clearly
marked and fenced off, if the flying zone had been defined properly,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Russian test pilot Anatoly Kvochur speculated that something
unexpected forced the pilots to veer over the heads of spectators,
where they should not have been.</TE>
<TE>   "It is clear that the pilots had to act in an emergency situation,
descending at a very sharp angle. As a result, the pilots lost
control of the plane and the jet crashed into the crowd," he said.
"Maybe there was an emergency situation inside the cockpit."</TE>
<TE>   Kvochur said the SU-27 is reliable, safe, simple to fly and easy
to service, like a good Western car.</TE>
<TE>   Alexei V. Kuznetsov of The Times' Moscow Bureau contributed to
this report.</TE>

<HD>Settlers Riot in Hebron; Palestinian Girl Is Killed</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Jews, Arabs blame each other for starting melee
during Israeli soldier's funeral. Scores of residents and police are
injured.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Enraged Jewish settlers mourning the death of an Israeli soldier went
on a rampage through the West Bank city of Hebron on Sunday, leaving
a Palestinian teenager dead, more than a dozen residents wounded, and
shops and homes damaged, witnesses said.</LD>
<LD>   The violence erupted during the funeral of Elazar Leibovitz, a
young Israeli soldier slain in a roadside ambush by Palestinian
militants near Hebron last week. Israeli police and witnesses
reported that Palestinians threw rocks at the mourners, which
triggered the riot by as many as 100 Jewish settlers in Hebron's Old
City.</LD>
<LD>   Wielding guns and rocks, the settlers smashed car windows, set at
least two Palestinian homes on fire, and beat up and shot at
bystanders, residents said.</LD>
<TE>   One of the bullets hit 14-year-old Nivin Moussa Jamjoum in the
head while she was inside her home. She later died from the wound,
hospital officials said.</TE>
<TE>   At least 15 other Palestinians and 15 Israeli police officers were
hurt during the riot, which lasted through the afternoon, authorities
said. One of the injured was a 7-year-old Palestinian boy who was
stabbed by an elderly Jewish settler, witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   The violence was a boiling-over of tension that had simmered since
Friday, after four Israelis--Leibovitz, a Jewish couple and one of
their 10 children--were gunned down in a surprise attack on a road
south of Hebron.</TE>
<TE>   A Palestinian militant group, the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, claimed
responsibility for the shooting. The group described it as
retaliation for Tuesday's Israeli airstrike on the Gaza Strip, which
killed a Hamas military commander and 14 other Palestinians, most of
them children.</TE>
<TE>   In a bid to stem the spiral of violence, Secretary of State Colin
L. Powell said Sunday that he would meet with senior officials of the
Palestinian Authority next week--the highest-level meeting between
the two sides since President Bush a month ago called for an overhaul
of the Palestinian Authority.</TE>
<TE>   The talks, which will focus on political and security reforms, are
aimed at helping "the Palestinian community transform itself," Powell
told reporters in New Delhi.</TE>
<TE>   The ambush that killed Leibovitz inflamed emotions in Hebron, a
city already rife with hostility between its more than 100,000
Palestinians and the 400 or so Jewish settlers who have laid claim to
land there, protected by Israeli soldiers and tanks.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian residents said reprisals for the ambush began late
Saturday, when Jewish settlers smashed cars and damaged Palestinian
homes.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli police apparently anticipated a flare-up at Sunday's
funeral service and tried to clear the streets before it began. The
army, which had lifted a curfew on residents just a few hours
earlier, set off stun grenades to get Palestinians to return to their
homes, witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   The funeral procession began around noon at a holy site revered by
both Jews and Muslims as the burial place of Abraham and his sons.
Television footage showed some of the thousands of Israeli mourners
shouting at the crowd to avenge Leibovitz's death.</TE>
<TE>   Moshe ben Zimra, a spokesman for the Jewish settlers in Hebron,
told Israeli radio that Palestinians started to throw rocks at the
mourners as they were leaving the sacred site, which prompted the
settlers to fire guns into the air in warning.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of mourners then peeled off from the main cortege and began
attacking people and property in the Old City, a densely packed
warren of Palestinian shops and homes, residents said.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian Mariam Natsche said she tried to shepherd her six
children inside the house before the rioters advanced up her street.
She was able to get five inside, but not 7-year-old Ahmed.</TE>
<TE>   "They attacked us first by throwing stones. Then they grabbed my
son and started kicking him," said Natsche, 37.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said they saw a Jewish settler in his 60s stab Ahmed in
the back with a short-bladed knife.</TE>
<TE>   "That's when I started screaming to my neighbors for help,"
Natsche said.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors on rooftops showered the boy's assailants with stones
until the attackers dispersed. An official at the hospital where
Ahmed was taken said the boy lay in intensive care but was in stable
condition and likely to recover.</TE>
<TE>   Several residents accused the Israeli police and army of doing
little to stop the mob of settlers. Police countered by pointing to
the officers hurt while trying to keep the settlers back.</TE>
<TE>   Four Israelis, including two minors, were detained for questioning
in connection with the melee, the Haaretz newspaper reported. None of
the four lives in Hebron.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Israeli security forces announced Sunday that they had
captured a leading Hamas militant, Hussein abu Kweik, and one of his
deputies near the West Bank city of Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   Abu Kweik, long on Israel's wanted list, is suspected of planning
terrorist attacks. Israel had tried to capture him at least once
before, in March, but succeeded only in killing his wife and three of
their children by blowing up the truck they were traveling in.</TE>
<TE>   Also near Ramallah, an 18-year-old Palestinian man was killed by
Israeli soldiers as he watched an army incursion in a town east of
the city, Israeli media reported.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Robin Wright in New Delhi contributed to this
report.</TE>

<HD>Fair Elections Key in Soothing Kashmir Tensions, Powell
Says</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: The secretary of State calls for India to
release political prisoners and for Pakistan to stop incursions in
the region by Muslim extremists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell on Sunday called on Pakistan and
India to avert war by ensuring that fall elections in disputed
Kashmir are free, fair and devoid of violence as a "first step"
leading to a formal dialogue between the two nuclear powers.</LD>
<LD>   Powell specifically appealed to India to free Kashmiri political
prisoners so they can participate, either as candidates or voters, in
the polling expected by mid-October. He also said international
observers should be allowed to monitor elections in the disputed
Himalayan region.</LD>
<LD>   The secretary then called on Pakistan to follow through on a
promise made last month to end, permanently, all infiltrations by
Muslim extremists into Kashmir.</LD>
<TE>   After talks in New Delhi and Islamabad, the first stops in a
weeklong, eight-nation Asia tour, Powell said he was encouraged.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is focused on the need to get tensions down and ensure
that it doesn't start over again," he told reporters traveling with
him. Escalating clashes, sparked by a Dec. 13 terrorist attack by
Kashmiri militants on India's Parliament, brought the nuclear powers
to the brink of war last month.</TE>
<TE>   The United States is now looking at the election for the Jammu and
Kashmir state parliament as a means to address the major concerns of
both nations--greater political autonomy for Muslim Kashmiris living
under the rule of Hindu-dominated India and an end to terrorist
attacks by Muslim militants against India.</TE>
<TE>   "Elections can be a first step in a broader process that begins to
address Kashmiri grievances and leads India and Pakistan back to
dialogue. Only a productive and sustained bilateral dialogue on all
issues, including Kashmir, will prevent future crises and will
finally bring peace to the region," Powell said Sunday at a news
conference in New Delhi.</TE>
<TE>   Powell began the day in India, where he urged Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee and other top leaders to ensure that the Kashmir poll
is judged to be credible by both Kashmiris and the outside world.</TE>
<TE>   "Moderate elements should be encouraged. There should be the
release of those who have been detained who can play a positive role
in generating turnout. There should be hopefully an atmosphere of
safety and peace provided by both sides," Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   India has jailed about two dozen separatist politicians who do not
support violence, including the leader of a prominent Muslim party,
according to U.S. officials. Without their participation, many
Kashmiris may boycott the polls, fueling more extremism, U.S.
officials fear.</TE>
<TE>   India has balked so far at allowing any organized monitoring of
the election, the first in Kashmir since 1996, although it said it
may permit some individuals to witness the voting.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a very independent election commission. We have a very
proud record of elections in this country, and I can assure you that
the Jammu and Kashmir elections will be free and fair," Indian
Foreign Minister Yashwant Sinha said before meeting Powell on
Saturday evening.</TE>
<TE>   But Kashmiris and Pakistanis have challenged the fairness of past
elections, saying they were marred by intimidation and fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Without open participation and sufficient international observers,
Powell warned, the outside world may not "judge the elections in a
proper way and an opportunity may have been lost."</TE>
<TE>   Powell flew to Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, on Sunday
afternoon for talks with President Pervez Musharraf about reining in
Muslim extremists who have used Pakistan to receive training and
supplies and then cross into Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf publicly turned aside  suggestions from India that he
has failed to follow through on his June promise to clamp down on the
extremists. "Whatever the Indian side is saying is absolutely
baseless. I don't have to do anything because we've already done it,"
he said as he greeted Powell at the presidential complex.</TE>
<TE>   Powell later said the United States was unable to verify the
specific claims of either side, although he said incursions had
continued.</TE>
<TE>   Powell, who described the talks in Pakistan as "forceful," later
told reporters that he had won a solid commitment from Musharraf and
Pakistan's intelligence chief to close the gaps that still allow
extremist incursions into Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf, the increasingly beleaguered general who seized power
in 1999, also reaffirmed that it was a "permanent decision."</TE>
<TE>   The next 10 weeks will be key in determining whether both sides
are serious about peace efforts, Powell told reporters en route to
Thailand, his third stop of the day.</TE>
<TE>   "We have now an interesting period ahead of us where we will
measure how infiltrations have gone down. If it goes down, then we
have the basis for going back to India and saying it's time to take
further de-escalatory steps," Powell said. "As evidence becomes
clear, we're in a better condition to ensure dialogue."</TE>

<HD>Old Mining Maps Often Inaccurate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND and ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The near-tragic accident in Pennsylvania illustrates a hazard that
coal miners have worried about for years: Maps of many abandoned
mines are inaccurate, in part because former operators voraciously
excavated beyond their boundaries.</LD>
<LD>   The nine Quecreek miners rescued late Saturday were trapped after
drilling into a flooded shaft of the long-closed Saxman mine that was
shown on their maps to be at least 200 feet farther along.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, officials at the scene said a federal and state
investigation into the accident will focus on how mining permits are
issued in Pennsylvania and how old mining maps are evaluated.</LD>
<TE>   Old, sometimes faulty maps are an important focus, especially
because 10,000 or so mine maps are archived by Pennsylvania alone,
some hand-drawn and some made more than 100 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   A former worker in the Saxman mine, which was closed in 1963,
recalled a frenzy of activity as the mine was being shut down four
decades ago that was not reflected in official maps.</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted to get as much coal as they could on that last day
... so they just kept that [excavating equipment] going around and
around until it looked like a ball field in there," said Joseph
Jashienski, 89, adding that he told one of the Quecreek workers about
the discrepancy last year. "The old map would show coal, but that
last day, they took it out. There would just be a space."</TE>
<TE>   Mining operations are required by law to leave a 200-foot barrier
at the end of a mine to protect against accidents. But Jim Lamont,
international safety representative for the United Mine Workers of
America, said those rules were routinely ignored before 1969, when
federal scrutiny of mines was increased.</TE>
<TE>   "In the old days, there wasn't the accountability there is now,"
Lamont said. "You would come up to that boundary line and say, 'Hey,
no one's going to know. Let's just go a little farther.' "</TE>
<TE>   Because old maps are notoriously inaccurate, some large mining
companies use costly sensors to detect when a drill is about to hit
dead space. But smaller outfits such as Black Wolf Coal Co., which
operates the Quecreek mine and has 65 employees, typically can't
afford the equipment, Lamont said.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, miners approaching an abandoned shaft may drill small
test holes before making a large cut, Lamont said. It is unclear
whether the trapped miners, who were 240 feet below the surface when
the wall was breached, took such precautions.</TE>
<TE>   The flooded mine will be drained to allow for a full
investigation, said Scott Roberts, deputy secretary of environmental
protection in Pennsylvania. "We want to be sure this doesn't happen
again," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts acknowledged the problem of inaccurate maps, saying, "The
coal industry is replete with stories of people buying coal twice."</TE>
<TE>   Dave D. Lauriski, U.S. assistant secretary of Labor for mining
safety and health, said the federal government would "take a very
close look" at how mapping problems may have contributed to the
accident.</TE>
<TE>   The miners union has lobbied for three years for federal funding
to improve the mapping of old mines, Lamont said. In the last two
years, similar accidents occurred in Kentucky and Virginia, but no
fatalities resulted.</TE>
<TE>   Though still one of the most dangerous jobs in America, coal
mining has become far safer in recent decades, thanks to a
combination of enforcement and improvements in technology that shift
the most onerous work to machines.</TE>
<TE>   Although the total number of coal mining injuries and fatalities
has decreased dramatically in the last century, the number of mining
deaths has risen each year since 1998, from 29 deaths that year to 42
in 2001, according to the Mine Safety and Health Administration and
the National Mining Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Lauriski noted in recent testimony to Congress that small mining
operations were twice as dangerous as larger mines.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, the number of coal miners in the United States shrank to
about a tenth of what it was, from just fewer than 705,000 in 1923 to
71,500 miners last year, according to government and industry
figures. But production doubled, from 564.6 million short tons of
coal in 1923 to 1,121.3 million in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   During the last two decades, the coal industry has been
consolidated into a leaner and more productive operation, dominated
by fewer, larger corporations.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, production increasingly shifted from the
Appalachian region to the West.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Elizabeth Shogren in Somerset, Pa., contributed

<HD>Little-Known Governor Calm Amid Crisis</HD>
<DH>Leadership: The rescue of nine miners thrust Mark Schweiker
into the national spotlight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ZUCCHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>He's a lame-duck governor with low name recognition, even in his home
state. He got the job only because his boss resigned, and he has
promised not to run for reelection.</LD>
<LD>   But when nine men were trapped 240 feet underground in western
Pennsylvania, Gov. Mark Schweiker was at the Quecreek drift mine
within 24 hours. For the next three days, he was a calm and steadfast
presence--updating the news media, consoling families and maintaining
a stubborn optimism when many people feared the miners were dead.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday morning, Schweiker's boyish face was on television
screens and front pages across America. He had announced the rescue
of all nine men with his arms raised triumphantly, his sleeves rolled
up and his dark hair matted with sweat.</LD>
<TE>   "What people saw was a genuinely decent person--he's like your
friendly next-door neighbor," said G. Terry Madonna, a political
analyst and professor at Millersville University in eastern
Pennsylvania who has known Schweiker since he was a county
commissioner in suburban Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a rarity in politics--a man who doesn't know how to be
phony," Madonna said. "He's self-effacing, non-aggrandizing."</TE>
<TE>   Like former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Schweiker was
thrust into the national spotlight at a time of crisis, although on a
much smaller scale. And like Giuliani, he responded with a
performance that left the public--and miners' families--feeling
informed and reassured but not exploited or patronized.</TE>
<TE>   Schweiker, 49, has been governor less than 10 months, taking
office Oct. 5 after Tom Ridge resigned to become director of homeland
security. Schweiker's term expires in January.</TE>
<TE>   Although he spent six years as lieutenant governor, Schweiker has
barely topped 50% on name recognition polls in Pennsylvania, Madonna
said. As a Bucks County commissioner, Madonna said, Schweiker
received the state Republican Party endorsement for lieutenant
governor in 1994 as part of a political deal with a GOP leadership
desperate for suburban Philadelphia votes.</TE>
<TE>   Dressed in jeans and work boots at the Quecreek Mine 55 miles
southeast of Pittsburgh, Schweiker took charge of briefing the media
and the miners' families--referring to himself later as "the lead
dog." When the families complained that they weren't receiving timely
information, Schweiker ordered state officials to brief them every
hour, according to the governor's spokesman, David La Torre.</TE>
<TE>   Before Schweiker arrived Thursday night, the families had decided
not to speak to the news media. The governor made sure the families'
wishes were followed, La Torre said.</TE>
<TE>   Schweiker was careful not to report anything to the media until he
had briefed family members. And when he was mistaken on a couple of
details, La Torre said, the governor quickly corrected himself.</TE>
<TE>   Even when the tapping of the trapped men was not heard after the
first day and experts warned of hypothermia or suffocation, Schweiker
was relentlessly optimistic. "If there's any slogan for this, it's
'nine for nine,' " he said at one point late Saturday. "We're
bringing up nine miners."</TE>
<TE>   Asked during a CNN interview Sunday how he maintained his positive
frame of mind, Schweiker replied: "I saw this growing assembly of the
right equipment, the right insights and the right people to pull off
the rescue."</TE>
<TE>   Between Thursday night and Sunday morning, Schweiker made regular
rounds--talking to miners and experts at the rescue site, briefing
reporters at an abandoned grocery store and sitting with the families
at a nearby firehouse.</TE>
<TE>   More than once, La Torre said, the governor gave his hotel key to
an exhausted driller and told him to use his room for a shower and
nap.</TE>
<TE>   Schweiker's only previous experience at a disaster site came Sept.
11 in Shanksville, 11 miles from Quecreek, after the crash of United
Airlines Flight 93. He broke down in tears that day.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, after the last miner was lifted to the surface, he
said: "I thought these things only happened in movies."</TE>
<TE>   When his term ends in January, Schweiker will keep his promise to
his wife and three children to leave politics, La Torre said. He
previously ran a consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he handled this crisis so well because he wasn't worried
about politics or what his handlers were telling him," Madonna said.
"He's clearly a guy who's not worried about reelection."</TE>

<KH>DISPATCH FROM HEBER CITY, UTAH</KH>
<HD>Immigrant Family Feels Post-9/11 Rage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HEBER CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>Mazhar Tabesh always felt he was not welcome here. He had been
threatened, his wife was spat at and his family received a chilly
reception in stores around town. But he never imagined that anyone
would try to kill him.</LD>
<LD>   The unimaginable happened on a recent Sunday night as Tabesh and
his wife were preparing for bed. Someone deliberately set fire to the
motel owned by the Pakistani native. The family escaped without
injury but watched their future and savings crackle and burn.</LD>
<LD>   Tabesh, a U.S. citizen, said he has received telephone threats for
about a year from an anonymous person who warned, "You don't belong
here, get out." Authorities are investigating the blaze as a possible
hate crime.</LD>
<TE>   Tabesh, his wife, Samina, and in-laws are among the few Muslims in
this dominantly Mormon area. Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on
the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, people of South Asian and
Middle Eastern descent across the country have been targets of verbal
attacks and worse, like what struck this quiet town of 7,300
recently.</TE>
<TE>   Residents were quick to condemn the incident and defend Heber
City, a town of stout turn-of-the-century brick buildings and
scraggly strip malls that draws tourists to its famous attraction, an
antique steam train nicknamed the Heber Creeper.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hoping that whoever did this is from out of town," Mayor Lynn
Adams said. "It's not typical of this community. People treat each
other fairly and with respect. As with any community, there are
people who don't like outsiders and people of other faiths. But
that's not the majority."</TE>
<TE>   Police believe that a man who paid cash for Room 112 started a
fire in that room's closet, then went upstairs and poured a flammable
liquid in the hallway. That person also removed the smoke detectors,
they say.</TE>
<TE>   Tabesh said he heard nothing until about 11 p.m., when a passerby
drove into the motel's parking lot, shouting that smoke was pouring
from the second-floor eaves. Another man, an off-duty firefighter,
stopped to help.</TE>
<TE>   While standing in the motel's u-shaped parking lot, bystanders
told authorities they saw two people on the roof of an adjacent
building. One matched the description of the man who checked in that
night.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe they must have been watching us, because they set the
fire at a time when we normally would have been asleep," Tabesh said.</TE>
<TE>   A soft-spoken man, Tabesh works in Salt Lake City for Wells Fargo
Bank. "Another three minutes and the ceiling would have come crashing
down. That good Samaritan really saved our lives."</TE>
<TE>   The fire destroyed nine rooms in the motel, including those
directly above where Tabesh and his wife live. Damage was estimated
at $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   Tabesh and his father-in-law purchased the modest 22-room motel
five years ago to provide income for Tabesh's in-laws and other
relatives. But some of the extended family were unable to get visas,
so Tabesh had been trying to sell the property.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in a tough spot now; someone is trying to kill me and my
family," Tabesh said, sitting in a chair outside a charred room and
rubbing a hand over his face. "On the one hand, my instincts tell me
to get the heck out of here, take my family and leave everything
behind. Give the business to the bank. On the other hand, I think,
'Why give in to a terrorist?' If I could sell this place, we'd get in
the car and leave this minute."</TE>
<TE>   Heber City straddles a two-lane highway that wends through what
used to be lush farming and ranching land. Today the town is a
bedroom community, about 30 miles southeast of Salt Lake City.
Officials here say that more than 70% of the residents commute to
Salt Lake City for work.</TE>
<TE>   Tabesh and his family never felt comfortable here. Samina Tabesh
said people in the grocery store stare at her, even though she does
not dress in conservative Muslim garb. Ignorance of the Islamic faith
and what Tabesh calls media distortion have led Americans to mistrust
Muslims, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We need a dialogue, we need to let people know what is in the
Koran and what our beliefs are," Tabesh said, adding that he is
strongly against Afghanistan's Taliban, which he said killed a member
of his family.</TE>
<TE>   Naseem Ahmed, president of the Alrasool Islamic Center in Salt
Lake City, said Muslims in the area have generally been left alone,
but they are on guard.</TE>
<TE>   "Since Sept. 11, we are more afraid," he said, citing a handful of
incidents involving arsons at a local mosque and a Muslim-owned
business. "We are safe, but the threat is always out there."</TE>
<TE>   With more than 70% of Utahans identifying themselves as members of
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, it's not unusual for
newcomers to the state to feel as if they are not part of the club.
The Heber Valley was settled by Mormons who emigrated from England.</TE>
<TE>   The complexion of region is changing. Some events in the Winter
Olympics were held here, and local officials say the influx of
international visitors helped temper the region's insular tendencies.
International ski teams return for training every winter, adding to
the mix.</TE>
<TE>   And, mindful of their own history of religious persecution, Mormon
officials preach openness and tolerance. Mormon President Gordon B.
Hinckley in the past has urged Mormons not to be clannish and to
befriend newcomers.</TE>
<TE>   Police say they are following "pretty good leads" in the motel
fire, and few in town seem on edge that an arsonist is at large.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't heard of it," said Ashley Smith, who works at the Sno
Cone shack about a block from the motel. "I didn't even know we had
those kind of people--Muslims--here. But we've got all kinds of
people."</TE>
<TE>   Adams said authorities have been keeping an eye on pockets of
white supremacists and skinheads living in the area. This rugged
region, like many rural enclaves, offers discreet hiding places.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw a buildup of those types in the valley before the
Olympics," Adams said. "I thought they would be a problem."</TE>
<TE>   Gabrielle Braze, who works at a convenience store, said she has
heard only vague rumors about skinheads in the area, but she added:
"I think it would be good for the community if there were more
diversity here. It's pretty white around here."</TE>
<TE>   If minorities are being targeted, it would not make Heber City too
different from other U.S. cities, where harassment of Muslims appears
to be on the rise.</TE>
<TE>   Heather Jacobson, who works at a local flower shop, called Heber
City "your basic small town," warts and all.</TE>
<TE>   "People who live in little towns don't believe things like that
can happen in their town, but it can," said Jacobson, who moved here
from Las Vegas. "Some people are really open, but it's really
weird--I've found that people here are kind of close-minded, kind of
hypocritical. I don't think I'll live in Utah the rest of my life."</TE>

<HD>Bush Treasury Official Talks Up the Economy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said Sunday the economy is
fundamentally sound despite the stock market's troubles and the
business scandals that have shaken consumer confidence.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm a deep believer in the potential and the reality of the
greatest economy ever conceived," said O'Neill, making high-profile
appearances on the talk shows following criticism of his travels
abroad during the recent economic volatility.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration is trying to ward off potential political
damage in the midterm elections this fall by talking up signs that
the economy is well-positioned for growth despite the increasing
reports of companies' accounting irregularities, which have caused
market jitters.</LD>
<TE>   "Out there in our economy, out there in Main Street, the real
growth in our economy is moving just as we thought it would," O'Neill
said on NBC's "Meet the Press." Citing reports on productivity growth
and second-quarter earnings, O'Neill said that "there is good news
out there" drowned out by "the steady amplification of the negative
stuff."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill said that "people who are invested in the American economy
over time are going to win. There has never been an extended period
of time in our history where investments in the U.S. economy didn't
win."</TE>
<TE>   Over the last 10 weeks, investors drove down Dow prices to
five-year lows, although Wall Street last week posted its biggest
weekly gain since May.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're reaching for a bottom, if we're not there now,"
said John Bogle, founder and former chairman of the Vanguard Group of
mutual funds, which manages $590 billion in assets for 17 million
clients.</TE>
<TE>   "I think investors' confidence has been shattered, and it's going
to take a lot more than some congressional action to rebuild it," he
said on "Fox News Sunday."</TE>

<HD>Political Free-Market Prosperity May Be Turning Corner</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald Brownstein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The political equivalent of a market correction is underway in the
relationship between business and politics.</LD>
<LD>   For at least 20 years, business has thrived in the political
world. Candidates with business backgrounds have prospered at the
ballot box. Business arguments against government regulation have
flourished. And reformers in both parties have argued that government
should rely more on market forces in pursuing its goals.</LD>
<LD>   Although some of this has been positive, at times the trend toward
sanctifying markets has gone to extremes. The free market is an
unparalleled engine of prosperity, but it can't guarantee all the
goods a decent society demands. And it isn't the repository of all
wisdom about how society should operate. If the uproar over cooked
books and the collapsing stock market drives home those simple
truths, it could play a useful function--at least as long as this
backlash also doesn't go too far.</LD>
<TE>   Post-Enron and WorldCom, the balance of power between the
political and business worlds is shifting on all three fronts,
starting with campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   There's a long history of business executives with no political
experience seeking top offices; the GOP nominated Wendell L. Willkie,
a charismatic utility executive (no, that's not a contradiction in
terms), as their presidential candidate in 1940. But, much like the
stock markets themselves, the trend has boomed in the last
generation.</TE>
<TE>   Six governors today are business people who held no previous
political office. Four senators also fit that description. In 1992,
Ross Perot applied the model to the most successful third-party
presidential campaign in decades.</TE>
<TE>   The business background hasn't been a sure winner in politics.
Some candidates from the executive suites have stalled on the runway.
Others have won less because they dazzled voters than because they
deluged their opponents with massive TV advertising campaigns
financed from their own thick wallets.</TE>
<TE>   But money doesn't explain all the success of business candidates
in the last generation. They've also had a wind at their backs: the
public's declining confidence in government, and rising faith in
business, especially as the market soared in the 1990s. Business
candidates have sold the argument that their corporate experience
would enable them to run government more efficiently, and they
successfully touted their lack of political experience as an
asset--emphasizing their distance from a political system widely seen
as corrupt.</TE>
<TE>   An unusually large class of business candidates (especially in
gubernatorial races) has been vigorously pressing those arguments
this year. But now almost all of them are under fire for their own
business dealings. The trend is bipartisan: Texas Gov. Rick Perry, a
Republican, has been denouncing the business ethics of his Democratic
rival, banker Tony Sanchez, as aggressively as California Gov. Gray
Davis, a Democrat, has been lashing the record of his GOP opponent,
investor Bill Simon.</TE>
<TE>   Undoubtedly, some of the charges flying against these business
candidates will prove to be exaggerated or misleading. But the
tougher scrutiny they're facing is still a good thing.</TE>
<TE>   By puncturing the illusions about business, the corporate scandals
will allow the business candidates to be judged more on their own
qualities, rather than by a knee-jerk reflex that Washington should
be run more like a company. A business pedigree shouldn't disqualify
candidates, and probably won't. But it shouldn't guarantee them a
presumption of more integrity and common sense than career
politicians, and now it may not do that either.</TE>
<TE>   The scandals may restore the same sort of balance to debates over
government regulation. For years, conservatives portrayed regulation
as a bureaucratic dead weight hobbling dynamic entrepreneurs. House
Minority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) memorably encapsulated that
conviction when he wrote: "The market is rational, and the government
is dumb."</TE>
<TE>   What the accounting scandals remind us is that the market can also
grow irrational, not to say immoral, in its pursuit of profit, and it
needs a strong referee to prevent abuse. The lesson applies not only
to the stock market but to the environment, workplace safety, and
everything else that government regulates.</TE>
<TE>   Markets need rules. Those rules don't always need to be rigid. But
government courts anarchy when it relies too much on the markets to
police themselves--as even Armey seemed to reluctantly acknowledge
last week by voting for the sweeping corporate reform bill in the
House.</TE>
<TE>   Government regulation is often intended to protect markets from
their own worst instincts. Conversely, over the last 20 years,
reformers have tried to adapt more of the best things about
markets--their responsiveness to consumers and openness to
innovation--to government programs. In both major political parties,
for instance, cutting-edge thinkers have argued that schools can be
improved by exposing them to more competition for students
(Republicans through vouchers, Democrats through charter schools and
more freedom to transfer within public schools).</TE>
<TE>   The Wall Street mess is already inspiring a second look at the
extent of the government's reliance on market forces. An immediate
casualty of the meltdown may be President Bush's plan to allow
workers to invest part of their Social Security taxes in stocks and
bonds; to many workers, the chaos on Wall Street is likely to
reinforce the value of maintaining Social Security as an island of
stability beyond the markets' reach.</TE>
<TE>   But that doesn't mean government should abandon all its efforts to
learn from markets. The value of vouchers remains unproved, but
schools can benefit from more competition for students within the
public system. And regulatory programs that create a market in
pollution reduction often can generate more environmental improvement
at less cost.</TE>
<TE>   The common theme here is approaching the intersection of business
and politics with open eyes. Too often--in campaigns or policy
debates--business has been seen as inherently superior to government.
Assuming the reverse would be just as bad. Even after Enron,
understanding the strengths of markets is as important as recognizing
their limitations.</TE>

<LD>Question: I read your recent explanation of contrails, and I don't
believe it. I have seen photos of contrails forming at a plane's
wingtips, not behind the motors.</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Condensation trails at the wingtips are a separate, but
related, issue, according to Jenn Stroud Rossmann of Harvey Mudd
College. Under conditions of high humidity, condensation can occur
anywhere there is a vortex, such as at the tips of wings. The
high-speed flow of the air causes an area of low pressure to form,
and that in turn causes water vapor to condense into visible form.
But condensation trails from the engines contain much larger
quantities of water vapor emitted by the engines themselves, and thus
are more visible and persist longer. Such condensation can occur
whenever there is high humidity and an area of low pressure, Rossmann
notes. One can occasionally see little clouds of condensation over
the wings, where the pressure is lower.</LD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Zinc supplements given to infants in developing countries to improve
growth and reduce susceptibility to infectious diseases could be
harming the children's mental development, British researchers
reported in Saturday's issue of the British journal The Lancet.</LD>
<LD>   In a study of 188 children in Bangladesh, researchers from
London's Center for International Child Health found that babies
whose mothers took zinc supplements during pregnancy had lower scores
on mental and psychomotor tests than children whose mothers were
given a placebo.</LD>
<LD>   The researchers do not know how the supplements exert their
effects. One theory suggests they could cause deficiencies in other
micronutrients in the infants or may have a direct influence on brain
development in the womb. Zinc deficiency is a problem in developing
countries because diets are low in animal protein and high in fiber.
Other supplements may be needed to counter zinc's ill effects.</LD>

<LD>New York researchers have observed a dramatic statistical correlation
between air pollution levels and the prevalence of diabetes, but the
significance of the observations has yet to be determined.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Alan Lockwood and his colleagues at the University of Buffalo
compared the Toxic Release Inventory, which documents emissions into
the air, with diabetes levels in each state.</LD>
<LD>   They reported in the August issue of Diabetes Care that states
with the highest emissions had the highest prevalence of the disease.
Ohio, for example, had very high levels of emissions (147 million
pounds) and a high prevalence of diabetes (7.5% of the population).
Conversely, states with low emissions had a low prevalence. Alaska,
which had 2.6 million pounds of emissions, had a prevalence rate of
4.4%. More research is necessary to explore the link, Lockwood said.</LD>

<HD>String of Fragments Seen Trailing Comet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hawaiian researchers have observed a "zoo" of at least 19 fragments
strung out in a line behind Comet 57P/du Toit-Neujmin-Delporte. One
or two companions to a comet are often seen, but 19 represent a very
rare event. The fragments suggest the comet suffered a catastrophe,
violent enough to break off pieces of its nucleus.</LD>
<LD>   The event was most likely triggered by thermal stresses within the
nucleus when it was warmed by sunlight. The pieces were observed with
the University of Hawaii's Mauna Kea telescope; the comet is too
faint to be seen with the naked eye.</LD>
<LD>   The string of fragments is spread out over 620,000 miles.
Individual pieces probably range in size from a few hundred yards
across to a few tens of yards across. The comet is named after the
three astronomers who first discovered it. The 57P means it is the
57th comet on the list of those that have been observed on at least
two of their passages around the sun. More information and a picture
are available at www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~yan/57p.html.</LD>

<HD>In Dyslexia Study, a Child's Reading Is Written on Brain</HD>
<DH>Learning: The scans of children as young as 7 reliably show
signs of the disorder that makes the mind struggle over text.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT LEE HOTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For those who struggle with dyslexia, a reading problem that
confounds 1 in every 5 Americans, the written word is a misfire in
the mind.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, a lifetime of reading problems can be traced to a
distinctive flaw in the brain that makes the mind strain and stumble
over written words. That telltale signature of dyslexia now can be
detected reliably in brain scans of children as young as 7,
researchers discovered.</LD>
<LD>   In the largest brain imaging study so far of children with reading
problems, Yale University researchers determined that the act of
reading prompted different patterns of mental effort in children with
dyslexia, compared to those who read more easily.</LD>
<TE>   By monitoring so many children while they read, the Yale
researchers also were able to see how these growing minds learned to
compensate for their own imperfections by relying more heavily on
parts of the brain not normally associated with fluent reading.</TE>
<TE>   Their work is the latest study to reveal that reading challenges
the brain in subtle and disconcerting ways, all involving a complex
network of neural circuits called into action every time the mind
encounters a word on the page.</TE>
<TE>   The scans showed that people with dyslexia have a much lower level
of activity in areas at the back of the brain thought to be
responsible for quickly matching words, sounds and meaning, compared
to normal readers.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the pattern of activity in neural circuits that handle
the written word was the same as previously detected in adults with
dyslexia, who have wrestled with the written word for a lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   "We know now that this disruption is not due simply to a lifetime
of poor reading because we see it in children as young as age 7,"
said Dr. Sally Shaywitz, director of the Yale University Center for
Learning and Attention and a co-author of the study published this
month in the research journal Biological Psychiatry.</TE>
<TE>   "The disruption is right there from the time they are beginning to
read," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The results are noteworthy, several reading experts said, because
they encompass so many children.</TE>
<TE>   The brain imaging technique, called functional magnetic resonance
imaging, or fMRI, used by the Yale team, allows researchers to watch
the living brain at work without risking a child's health or well
being. It is painless, noninvasive and does not use X-rays, radiation
or dyes.</TE>
<TE>   Imaging experiments, however, often rely on a handful of
volunteers, making it difficult to consider any finding a definitive
diagnosis of any brain function. There can be less to their gaudy
patterns of brain activation than meets the eye.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first study, not just in dyslexia but in any
cognitive aspect of the brain, that has used a sample so large," said
Guinevere Eden, director of the Georgetown University Center for the
Study of Learning in Washington, who uses brain scanning techniques
to study reading disorders.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very solid," said UCLA neuropsychologist Susan Bookheimer,
who studies dyslexia and other reading disorders. "In the past this
has been done primarily in adults. This is a nice way of getting at
the kids."</TE>
<TE>   USC psychologist Franklin Manis, who is leading a five-year,
$1.8-million study of reading problems and the brain involving
several hundred children, called the findings "striking." They offer
confirmation of evidence that reading disorders such as dyslexia,
which affect as many as 8 million children ages 4 to 13, are caused
by subtle problems in brain cells and synapses, not by any lack of
intellectual ability or motivation.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, they do little to dispel the mystery of the cause and
effect of the many reading problems gathered together under the
single diagnosis of dyslexia, Manis said.</TE>
<TE>   In a real way, dyslexia is less a learning disorder than a symptom
of a society increasingly dependent on reading.</TE>
<TE>   "In a world in which print is everywhere, dyslexia becomes a more
salient problem," Manis said.</TE>
<TE>   Nature long ago crafted sophisticated neural networks for the
brain to almost instantly understand speech.</TE>
<TE>   But the written word is a wholly artificial creation that relies
on parts of the brain designed for other tasks.</TE>
<TE>   "Language comes naturally to us, but reading is a skill we have to
learn," Eden said. "There is no single neural infrastructure for
reading."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, "there are a lot of neural areas that are moonlighting
for reading."</TE>
<TE>   Most people with the disorder have trouble associating written
words and letters with the sounds they represent.</TE>
<TE>   Some troubled readers cannot mentally resolve the pattern of the
characters of the alphabet fast enough. Others stumble because they
cannot properly sound out the phonemes, the sounds that make up
words.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those with dyslexia simply cannot process such
distinctions fast enough to keep up with the fluent flow of text.</TE>
<TE>   To read well, the brain has only a few thousandths of a second to
translate the symbols into sound and meaning. Most children can
process such sounds in less than 40 milliseconds, researchers at
Rutgers University in New Jersey have shown.</TE>
<TE>   Children who have reading problems may need as much as 500
milliseconds.</TE>
<TE>   But experts at the Cognitive Neurosciences Institute at University
College in London argue that dyslexia may be caused by a fundamental
difficulty in perceiving speech rhythms.</TE>
<TE>   In research made public last week in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences, cognitive psychologist Usha Goswami and
her colleagues found that dyslexic children could not track the beat
in speech.</TE>
<TE>   These children were significantly less sensitive than normal
readers to rhythmic beats in nonsense sounds.</TE>
<TE>   The ability to keep a beat seemed to follow skilled reading and
spelling ability, not only in dyslexic children but also in normal
readers and a small group of precocious readers.</TE>
<TE>   Goswami suggested that the ability to adeptly detect a beat
matters when the brain is trying to process syllables.</TE>
<TE>   While most researchers concentrate on flaws in brain circuits
directly involved in language, some scientists have found evidence
that people with dyslexia appear to have flaws in the brain's visual
system that makes it hard for them to track movement.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford University researchers have found other evidence that
reading problems are tied to a specific defect in the brain's white
matter, which plays a key role in transmitting information between
different brain regions involved in language comprehension.</TE>
<TE>   Genes could also play a role in dyslexia. So could family reading
habits. Even the educational system and the nature of the written
language can contribute. For example, the reading disorder is twice
as prevalent in the U.S. than in Italy, where the written word more
consistently matches its spoken word.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, it will take more than evidence of brain imaging alone
to understand dyslexia, reading experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of very fundamental questions to which we don't
have the answer: When we see a pattern in the brain, is it a
consequence of dyslexia or a cause? Does it tell us the underlying
problem or what to do about it?" UCLA's Bookheimer said. "What we
know is that there is an area of the brain that doesn't light up. We
have a lot to learn."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the brain scanning techniques could help detect such
reading problems earlier, when teachers could better help overcome
the difficulty, perhaps even before a child first picks up an
alphabet primer.</TE>
<TE>   Already, they can help researchers better understand which kinds
of reading instruction work best.</TE>
<TE>   But the scanning is much too primitive--and the technology still
too expensive--to be a tool for screening individual children for the
disorder.</TE>

<HD>Deadly Fish Provides Clues to Human Genes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY SINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A deadly Japanese fish may be the next key to illuminating the
mysteries of the human genome.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists have reported decoding the genetic sequence of the
Japanese pufferfish, Fugu rubripes, an expensive delicacy that
contains potentially lethal poison in the organs. The fugu has about
the same number of genes as a human, all stored in a DNA package an
eighth the size.</LD>
<LD>   The simplicity of the fugu's genome offers scientists an
unprecedented ability to identify new human genes. The two
vertebrates share many of the same groupings of genes, even though
they last shared a common ancestor almost half a billion years ago.</LD>
<TE>   "The fugu is like the human genome with a 90% discount," said
Sidney Brenner, a professor at the Salk Institute in San Diego and
one of the initiators of the fugu genome project.</TE>
<TE>   Sam Aparicio, a professor in the oncology department at Cambridge
University in Britain, who coordinated part of the project, called
the fugu "the Rosetta stone of biology."</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first time we can compare on the scale of an entire
genome a list of the protein parts of human and fish," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The fugu genome has approximately 365 million chemical base pairs,
the letters that make up the genetic alphabet. That compares with the
3 billion letters that make up the human genome.</TE>
<TE>   The small size of the fugu genome is one of the main reasons for
its selection for sequencing. So far, only the genomes for the fugu,
mouse and human are publicly available.</TE>
<TE>   The project took only a year to complete through an international
effort that included the Institute for Molecular Biology in Singapore
and the U.S. Department of Energy's Joint Genome Institute.</TE>
<TE>   There are, of course, enormous differences between the fugu and
human genomes. The complexity of the human genome makes finding genes
like looking for a needle in a biological haystack.</TE>
<TE>   While the sequence for the human genome was announced two years
ago, scientists are still sifting through the complex string of
genetic letters, looking for genes that direct the production of
different proteins.</TE>
<TE>   There are computer programs that predict which areas encode
proteins, Aparicio said, but comparing gene sequences with another
species gives more powerful evidence that something is a gene.</TE>
<TE>   That's where the fugu comes in.</TE>
<TE>   Brenner said the fugu genome contains much less "junk
DNA"--repetitive parts of the genetic sequence that exist between
genes--than other vertebrates.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the compactness of the fugu genome, the scientists were
able to easily identify genes, which they then used to hunt for new
human genes.</TE>
<TE>   The group already has identified almost 1,000 new human genes,
with the potential for a few thousand more, Aparicio said.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers are also using the fugu genome to help them understand
the parts of the human genome that regulate the activation of genes
to produce proteins.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the differences between fish and ourselves is not the
gene, it's the way genes are used for development--where and when
they are switched on," Brenner said.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers can take the regulatory portions of genes from the
fugu and put them into mice. The genes function properly, giving
scientists a clue to their purpose.</TE>
<TE>   "When you cross mice and fish you can understand how genomes
evolve and what makes complexities in organisms when the basic gene
language is the same," Brenner said.</TE>
<TE>   John Ngai, a professor of neurobiology at UC Berkeley, who studies
mice and zebrafish, said: "This is going to prove to be a great
resource for the research community and will help us understand how
vertebrate genomes are organized. It will help us in everything we
do."</TE>
<TE>   The next organisms in the sequencing lineup include the chicken,
chimpanzee, several species of fungi, a sea urchin, the honeybee and
a microscopic protozoan called Tetrahymena.</TE>
<TE>   Brenner, a pioneer in selecting animals for scientific study,
doesn't have a favorite up at bat. "Scientists should sequence pieces
of the genomes of many organisms to utilize the continuity of nature
to illuminate the most interesting organism: ourselves."</TE>

<LD>Derek Lowe wasn't going to just watch Manny Ramirez get hit by a
pitch.</LD>
<LD>   Lowe pitched six scoreless innings for his 14th victory and helped
instigate a bench-clearing brawl with a retaliation pitch as the
Boston Red Sox beat the Baltimore Orioles, 12-3, Sunday at Boston.</LD>
<LD>   Lowe hit Gary Matthews Jr. with the first pitch of the fourth
inning after watching Ramirez get hit by a pitch for the sixth time
this season an inning earlier.</LD>
<TE>   "If it was the first time Manny got hit ... ," Lowe said. "You've
got to protect your superstars."</TE>
<TE>   Matthews and Baltimore reliever Willis Roberts were ejected after
the brawl, along with Boston pitching coach Tony Cloninger. There
appeared to be very few punches thrown.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't initiate anything," Boston Manager Grady Little said.
"We do a good job of retaliating before it gets too far out of
balance."</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox had been irked that Ramirez was hit twice against
Tampa Bay on July 18, and no suspensions came of it.</TE>
<TE>   Lowe (14-5), who lowered his major league-leading earned-run
average to 2.23, gave up four hits, walked two and struck out two.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox broke it open with five runs in the third, all coming
with two out. Jason Varitek doubled in the first run after Nomar
Garciaparra singled and Ramirez was hit by a pitch. Shea Hillenbrand
followed with a run-scoring single, and Varitek scored on the same
play on shortstop Melvin Mora's throwing error.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 9, Detroit 6--Jim Thome, in what could have been his
last at-bat for the Indians at Jacobs Field, hit a grand slam with
one out in the ninth inning to rally Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Thome went three for four with five runs batted in, including his
second grand slam this season and seventh of his career.</TE>
<TE>   The first baseman can become a free agent after the season and has
been a constant subject of trade rumors despite saying he will not
void a no-trade clause in his contract.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 12, Texas 2--Barry Zito became the American League's first
15-game winner after Miguel Tejada drove in six runs in the last two
innings at Arlington, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Tejada gave Oakland a 4-2 lead with a three-run homer in the
eighth and hit a bases-loaded double in the ninth. The A's scored 11
runs against the Ranger bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 4, Toronto 0--Johan Santana gave up two hits and struck
out a career-high 13 in eight innings at Minneapolis to lead the
Twins to their fourth consecutive victory.</TE>
<TE>   Torii Hunter went three for four with a solo homer for the Twins,
who maintained a 14-game lead over the Chicago White Sox in the AL
Central.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 4, Kansas City 2--Royce Clayton went three for four with
two doubles, and three relievers combined to retire the last 15
batters to help the White Sox complete a three-game sweep at Chicago.
Bob Howry (2-2) retired the nine batters he faced.</TE>

<HD>Stoneman Loses Shuey to Dodgers</HD>

<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>The Angels lost out on one of the players they most coveted in trade,
when General Manager Bill Stoneman refused to include his top
prospects in a proposed deal for Cleveland reliever Paul Shuey. The
Dodgers had no such hesitation and acquired Shuey from the Indians on
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "The Angels were very seriously and very firmly in on Paul Shuey,"
Cleveland General Manager Mark Shapiro said. "Stoneman was
persistent. He made a very competitive offer."</LD>
<LD>   The Angels believed that Shuey would have made an ideal
acquisition, since he is a proven setup man and not a closer who
would have to adjust to a setup role. The Angels are believed to have
offered two prospects for Shuey, though neither Shapiro nor Angel
officials would discuss the offer.</LD>
<TE>   In the four-player trade, the Dodgers gave up two promising
pitchers, one their top-ranked pitching prospect and another a
Class-A pitcher with 111 strikeouts in 113 innings, neither older
than 23. An equivalent trade for the Angels would have included
dazzling triple-A right-hander Francisco Rodriguez, 20, and a top
lower-level prospect such as right-hander Johan Santana, 18, a deal
Stoneman would not make.</TE>
<TE>   With Stoneman protective of his top prospects and the Angels
reluctant to add substantially to their player payroll, a significant
trade by Wednesday's deadline appears increasingly unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   But a lesser deal remains possible, with potential targets that
include relievers Juan Acevedo (Detroit), Vic Darensbourg (Florida),
Mike DeJean (Milwaukee), Jose Jimenez (Colorado), Braden Looper
(Florida), Dan Plesac (Philadelphia), Ricardo Rincon (Cleveland) and
Scott Sauerback (Pittsburgh) and outfielders Bubba Trammell (San
Diego), Matt Stairs (Milwaukee), Chris Singleton (Baltimore), Eric
Owens (Florida), Kevin Millar (Florida), Carlos Lee (Chicago White
Sox), Trenidad Hubbard (San Diego) and Todd Hollandsworth (Colorado).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Infielder Jose Nieves, at his request, met with Manager Mike
Scioscia before the game to discuss his dwindling playing time.
Nieves has six at-bats since Shawn Wooten returned from the disabled
list 18 days ago, and his primary role at the moment is pinch-runner.
He said he did not ask to be traded, though the Angels would do so
for an extra outfielder or reliever, and said he is happy with a
major league job on a winning team.</TE>
<TE>   Nieves, hitting .289, said he did not necessarily need a chance to
prove himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I had my chance earlier," he said. "I think I took advantage of
it."</TE>
<TE>   And, although Scioscia typically platoons at designated hitter, he
did not use Brad Fullmer to bat for Shawn Wooten in the ninth inning
Sunday against right-handed closer Kazuhiro Sasaki, although Wooten
batted for Fullmer Saturday against left-hander Arthur Rhodes.
Fullmer, with six hits in his last 14 at-bats, said he is content
playing for a winning team and does not wish to be traded, but he
isn't thrilled that he is not the everyday player he was told he
would be in spring training. He said he does not plan to seek
clarification of his role from Scioscia.</TE>

<HD>Angels Get Whiff of First Place</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Appier and Percival limit Mariners to four hits
and Wooten's sacrifice fly in ninth leads to 1-0 victory. Angels win
two of three in series.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>The scent of victory: Benji Gil sat in front of his locker, puffing
away on a cigar.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a first-place thing," Gil said. "I'm trying to get into
smoking shape for when we win the pennant."</LD>
<LD>   No, Gil isn't endorsing smoking. And, no, he isn't fitting himself
for a championship ring in July, or otherwise dismissing the Seattle
Mariners and Oakland Athletics as worthy rivals. But the Angels
allowed themselves a brief moment of satisfaction after another
conquest of the Mariners, this one a tension-filled 1-0 victory that
enabled them to fly home Sunday night as a first-place team, two
percentage points ahead of Seattle in the American League West.</LD>
<TE>   On a July day in which the atmosphere resembled October--a cool,
gray afternoon before a boisterous sellout crowd at Safeco Field--the
Angels played a game worthy of a champion. Kevin Appier and Troy
Percival combined on a four-hit shutout, and Shawn Wooten's
ninth-inning sacrifice fly pinned defeat on Seattle closer Kazuhiro
Sasaki.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, outwardly calm and bordering on nonchalant when they
pounded the Mariners Friday to move into first-place, rebounded from
Saturday's loss and celebrated Sunday's victory. Percival, throwing
as hard as 99 mph, retired the side in order in the ninth inning. As
Garret Anderson caught Desi Relaford's fly ball for the final out,
Percival pumped his fist into the air, then slammed it into the
webbing of his glove.</TE>
<TE>   Percival said he had not pitched in a more important game since
the last week of the 1995 season. While Angel fans recall 1995 as the
year the team coughed up an 11-game lead and lost a one-game playoff
to Seattle, Percival remembered the final weekend that season, when
the Angels had to sweep the A's to make up a three-game deficit and
qualify for the playoff.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what it feels like," he said. "And these fans are
incredible. They're on top of you the whole time. They're even on top
of you in the bullpen. It brings a playoff atmosphere to the game.</TE>
<TE>   "If our fans could do that for us ... well, it's that much harder
to perform when the fans are on top of you."</TE>
<TE>   Edison Field will be rocking this week, with the annual invasion
of expatriates from Boston and New York. On sheer decibel level
alone, Angel fans do not figure to outshout Red Sox and Yankee fans,
but Percival and his teammates would appreciate the effort.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are in a four-team fight for two playoff spots, one
awarded to the AL West champion and the other to a wild-card team.
The Angels and Mariners lead Oakland by three games in both races and
lead the Red Sox by one in the wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't accomplished anything yet," Percival said. "We've
gotten ourselves into the race, but we've got two good clubs coming
in. We can't go out there and think we're world champions."</TE>
<TE>   What the Angels showed the last two weeks was the ability to play
with Seattle and Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels went 10-29 against those teams last year and 3-11
against them in April, but Sunday concluded an 8-3 stretch against
Seattle and Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels swept Seattle in Anaheim last weekend. They won two of
three games here, both by shutout.</TE>
<TE>   "This gives us more confidence, especially the way we were playing
against the West at the start of the season," Appier said.</TE>
<TE>   Appier was spectacular, as was his Seattle counterpart, Jamie
Moyer. Each starter pitched eight innings and gave up four hits. The
four hits off Appier included two bunt singles and a broken-bat
single. The four hits off Moyer included two infield singles and a
bunt single. As each scoreless inning passed, the tension mounted.</TE>
<TE>   The managers summoned their closers for the ninth inning. Tim
Salmon singled to start the ninth, advancing to second base on a
single by Anderson and to third on a wild pitch. After Troy Glaus
struck out, Wooten hit the game-winning sacrifice fly.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really cool when you come out on top, at least afterwards,"
Appier said. "But it's very stressful. Do I look older?"</TE>
<TE>   Appier, one of the few Angels with postseason experience, said he
sensed a playoff atmosphere over the weekend, and over the last two
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "The last few series have had that kind of flavor," he said, "that
kind of smell."</TE>
<TE>   As he spoke, the scent of Gil's victory cigar carried across the
clubhouse.</TE>

<HD>Giants Get Speedy Leadoff Man Lofton</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kenny Lofton always wants to be in a pennant race, and the San
Francisco Giants have always wanted a leadoff hitter who could play
center field.</LD>
<LD>   Lofton, 35, and the Giants both got what they wanted on Sunday
when San Francisco acquired the speedy six-time All-Star from the
Chicago White Sox for two minor leaguers.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a great opportunity to get into a playoff race, and that's
always exciting," Lofton said. "It was tough to leave Chicago, but
sometimes you just have to go with your heart."</LD>
<TE>   Lofton sacrificed a significant amount of potential bonus money to
join the Giants in a trade that nearly was scuttled several times in
the last few days because of financial concerns. When they were
finally resolved, the Giants got the leadoff-hitting outfielder
they've lacked for so long.</TE>
<TE>   "The team thinks this is really a shot in the arm," Giant General
Manager Brian Sabean said. "Kenny wanted to come here in the
off-season as a free agent, and Lord knows we wanted someone here in
the leadoff spot."</TE>
<TE>   The Giants sent right-hander Felix Diaz and left-hander Ryan Meaux
to Chicago for Lofton, who was hitting .259 with eight homers, 42
runs batted in and 22 stolen bases with the White Sox this season.
He's sixth in the AL in stolen bases and third in triples.</TE>
<TE>   Lofton will be expected to contribute immediately to a San
Francisco outfield that was missing Barry Bonds, Reggie Sanders,
Tsuyoshi Shinjo and Marvin Benard during a weekend series against the
Dodgers because of injuries.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York Yankee ace Roger Clemens might make another rehab start
before coming off the disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll watch him throw, and get a feel," Manager Joe Torre said.
"We can always send him back or send him wherever he needs to go for
his rehab, which would be on Thursday."</TE>
<TE>   Clemens, who had a strained right groin, threw 92 pitches in a
rehabilitation start for Class-A Tampa on Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees also activated pitcher Sterling Hitchcock, sidelined
by a lower back injury, from the 15-day disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Houston Astros released veteran reliever T.J. Mathews only 11
days after he came off the 60-day disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   Mathews, signed as a free agent in the off-season, missed more
than two months after straining his right biceps on April 2.</TE>

<HD>Lights Shine at Bighorn</HD>
<DH>Golf: Woods and Nicklaus team up against Garcia and Trevino
tonight at Palm Desert in made-for-TV event.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's played on grass, under the lights, on Monday night, and ABC is
primed. Al Michaels will be there, and so will Melissa Stark.</LD>
<LD>   Are you ready? Are you ready for some ... golf?</LD>
<LD>   In the fourth edition of ABC's version of Monday night golf, four
of the sport's biggest names will be on the same course tonight in
Palm Desert.</LD>
<TE>   Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods will team up against Lee Trevino and
Sergio Garcia in the $1.7-million Lincoln Financial Group Battle at
Bighorn.</TE>
<TE>   They will play the Canyons course at Bighorn Golf Club, a
7,057-yard layout set among rock-studded canyons, copper foothills,
meandering streams and majestic waterfalls. The course, designed by
Tom Fazio, opened in December 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's winners will split $1.2 million, and the losers will
split $500,000. A portion of each player's earnings will be
designated for charity.</TE>
<TE>   ABC's coverage begins at 5 p.m., although the 18-hole, best-ball
round actually gets underway at 3:30.</TE>
<TE>   Under a team best-ball format, the lower score on each team is the
one that counts.</TE>
<TE>   Play is expected to conclude around 8 p.m., so lights have been
set up on the final five holes.</TE>
<TE>   The old guys, Trevino and Nicklaus, are a little concerned about
the timing.</TE>
<TE>   "If we have to play under the lights, Jack and I are goners,"
Trevino said. "We're blind when the sun's out. We can barely see. Do
whiffs count?"</TE>
<TE>   Said Nicklaus: "The last time I played under lights, I was a kid
out at a driving range. I can't see anyway, so it doesn't make much
difference. It will be unique."</TE>
<TE>   Garcia, who played Woods two years ago in this event when there
were lights only on the last four holes, said, "We barely made it to
the lights. I remember we were playing 14 in the dark, with no
lights. But it was a good experience. It was fun."</TE>
<TE>   The first of these exhibitions was played at Sherwood Country Club
in Thousand Oaks in 1999, with Woods defeating David Duval in match
play, 2 and 1, in what was called the Showdown at Sherwood.</TE>
<TE>   The telecast drew 23.2 million viewers and was the second-highest
rated golf event of the year with a 6.9. Only the final round of the
Masters got a higher rating.</TE>
<TE>   The event then moved to Bighorn, where in 2000 Garcia defeated
Woods, 1 up. That match drew a 7.6 rating and 29.2 million viewers.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's competition featured Woods and Annika Sorenstam
against Duval and Karrie Webb, playing an alternate-shot format.
Woods and Sorenstam won in 19 holes. The TV rating dipped to a 6.1.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's competition ends a three-year run at Bighorn. It will be
announced today that the event will move to the Bridges in Rancho
Santa Fe next year.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Michaels and Stark, ABC's announcing team tonight will
also include Mike Tirico and Curtis Strange.</TE>
<TE>   Stark, a sideline reporter on "Monday Night Football," has
replaced Judy Rankin. ABC said the reason for the change was that the
format lends itself more to a reporter/interviewer such as Stark than
an on-course commentator such as Rankin.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's telecast will have an interactive aspect, a first for
golf. Viewers will be able to log on to Enhanced TV through ESPN.com.
and, besides getting different camera angles and graphics, can
attempt to predict the outcome of each hole and win prizes.</TE>

<LD>Tracy Ringolsby of the Rocky Mountain News writes that it's a shame
Ozzie Smith was the only player inducted into the Baseball Hall of
Fame on Sunday:</LD>
<LD>   "Voters were so caught up in the wave to induct Smith that they
seemingly ignored another shortstop, Detroit's Alan Trammell, who did
not incorporate gymnastics into his style of play but was a
first-class defensive player and a middle-of-the-lineup force in an
era when shortstops were not counted on to produce runs.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not as if Trammell is the only player to be slighted, but he
is one of the more glaring oversights, along with reliever Goose
Gossage and pitcher Jack Morris."</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who currently has the highest-selling jersey among
NFL players?</TE>
<TE>   No bargain: It has been estimated that Ryan Leaf earned $13.5
million in his brief NFL career, prompting Nick Canepa of the San
Diego Union-Tribune to do some math:</TE>
<TE>   "I figure Leaf earned $964,285 per touchdown pass. Or, $375,000
per interception. Or, $39,940 per incompletion. If Leaf is not the
most disappointing player in the history of the NFL, he's leaning at
the tape. It's hard to imagine any quarterback producing less bang
for the buck."</TE>
<TE>   Good question: In a letter to Newsday, a reader asked, "Regarding
Ryan Leaf, don't you have to participate in the NFL in order to
retire from it?"</TE>
<TE>   Cleaning house: From Scott Ostler of the San Francisco Chronicle:
"[Wide receiver] Terrell Owens tells USA Today he wants to become a
team leader, then kicks off his campaign by describing the 49ers as
'a lot of two-faced people. And that goes from the top down.'</TE>
<TE>   "No better way to assert your leadership than by exposing those
phony, two-faced water boys."</TE>
<TE>   Keeping house: NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon's slump has been
attributed to his impending divorce and to his wife's threat to take
their $10-million Palm Beach mansion.</TE>
<TE>   Responds Mike Bianchi of the Orlando Sentinel: "Kind of reminds
you of the quote from Zsa Zsa Gabor, 'I'm a marvelous housekeeper.
Every time I leave a man, I keep his house.' "</TE>
<TE>   Sticky solution: Keith Olbermann of ABC Radio, commenting on
golfer John Daly's applying Super Glue to stop the bleeding caused by
a piece of glass in a hand:</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe he can teach this trick to Sergio Garcia. A little Super
Glue on the hands and we won't have to watch Sergio readjust his grip
30 times per shot."</TE>
<TE>   Charles in charge: Charles Barkley, on corporate executives
refusing to testify in corruption cases: "These executives are
ridiculous. The next time they plead the fifth everybody should jump
up and beat the hell out of them."</TE>
<TE>   Prediction: From Dan Daly of the Washington Times: "Before the end
of the NFL season, some team's front four will be nicknamed
'Eight-Legged Freaks.' "</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Chicago Bear linebacker Brian Urlacher's No. 54.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Dallas Maverick owner Mark Cuban, on leading Chicago
Cub fans in singing "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" recently:</TE>
<TE>   "I am just being myself. Somebody had to be the luckiest guy in
the world, and it just happened to be me."</TE>

<LD>   What: "Ernie Harwell: My 60 Years in Baseball"</LD>
<TE>   Author: Tom Keegan</TE>
<TE>   Publisher: Triumph Books, Chicago</TE>
<TE>   Price: $34.95</TE>
<TE>   In writing this authorized biography of legendary baseball
announcer Ernie Harwell, author Tom Keegan, baseball columnist for
the New York Post, interviewed dozens of people.</TE>
<TE>   For one interview he had to go to a correctional facility in
Pennsylvania, where Denny McLain is serving an eight-year sentence
for, among other things, theft from a pension fund.</TE>
<TE>   "How can you write a book about Ernie Harwell?" asked baseball's
last 30-game winner. "He's never done anything bad in his life. What
can you say about Saint Ernie? ... It's nice to know somebody who
nobody says anything bad about."</TE>
<TE>   McLain won 31 games as a pitcher for the 1968 World Series
champion Detroit Tigers.</TE>
<TE>   In the book's foreword, another star on that team, Al Kaline,
writes, "I'm going to try to find somebody who doesn't like Ernie
Harwell. I hope I live long enough to do that because that means I'll
never die."</TE>
<TE>   Keegan proves a book about a true gentleman doesn't have to be
boring. This 290-page book is captivating from start to finish, and
not just because it's about a famous baseball announcer.</TE>
<TE>   Harwell is known as a great storyteller, and the story he and
others tell of his life is a good one.</TE>
<TE>   The book's first chapter is titled "A Gentleman Wronged," taken
from a Page 1 headline in the Detroit Free-Press. Harwell was fired
by the Tigers after the 1991 season. The Detroit News called it "the
most flagrant public relations disaster in the history of sports."</TE>
<TE>   It would be akin to the Dodgers firing Vin Scully.</TE>
<TE>   Harwell, who had been the voice of the Tigers since 1960, was
brought back for the 1993 season, under new Tiger ownership. Now 84,
he announced during spring training that this season would be his
last.</TE>

<HD>Mulholland: Trade Will Help</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>As a condition of Sunday's Paul Shuey trade, the Cleveland Indians
had to take struggling reliever Terry Mulholland and his $3-million
contract, a move that sent Mulholland from a contender to an
also-ran.</LD>
<LD>   "You hate to leave a first place-caliber club, but this move may
help [the Dodgers]," Mulholland said. "They're getting a very capable
reliever, and let's face it, I haven't had the best year. It's been
an uphill climb since I gave up all those runs to start the season.
But going to Cleveland, maybe I'll have a chance to pitch more."</LD>
<LD>   Mulholland, who has been traded six times since 1989, gave up 11
earned runs and 11 hits, including five home runs, in 4 2/3 innings
of his first two appearances. He missed most of May because of back
spasms, and after returning in early June, he was relegated to a
mop-up role.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought I turned the corner to where I might be a bigger part
of the club after the All-Star break, but [General Manager] Dan Evans
is doing the best he can do--I don't fault him for trading me," said
Mulholland, who had a 7.31 earned-run average in 21 games. "Had I
done better earlier in the season, I would have been used more."</TE>
<TE>   Though Manager Jim Tracy didn't use Mulholland in critical
situations, Mulholland didn't feel Tracy lost confidence in him.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's face it, early on, I was getting my brains beat in,"
Mulholland said. "He gave me the opportunity to get things right in
[low-stress] situations. That might have lasted longer than I would
have liked. Obviously, you want to pitch in competitive situations. I
wished I could have contributed more, but it's Jim's job to win
games."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers demoted struggling reliever Guillermo Mota to triple-A
Las Vegas after Sunday's game because they don't believe Mota will
get enough work to further his development after Shuey joins the team
Tuesday in Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   "Pitching in long relief is not a good situation for a young arm
like that," Tracy said of Mota, who is 29 and in his 13th
professional season but has only pitched for the last six years. "The
only way to nurture that is to keep pitching. I don't want to see him
go six or seven days in a row without pitching."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers recalled left-hander Victor Alvarez from Las Vegas
before Sunday's game to fill Mulholland's roster spot and long relief
role. Alvarez was 8-5 with a 4.94 ERA in 26 games at Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pitcher Darren Dreifort, whose rehabilitation from elbow surgery
has been slowed by a right knee injury, returned to Los Angeles
Sunday night and will be examined by team physicians Frank Jobe and
Ralph Gambardella today. Dreifort had to cut Friday's light bullpen
session off at 20 pitches because of pain in the knee.</TE>
<TE>   "I shut it down before the pain got too excruciating and would
force me to alter my mechanics to compensate," Dreifort said. "I'm
still a little unsure what's going on down there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dodger pitching coach Jim Colborn on Ricardo Rodriguez, the
prospect the Dodgers gave up in the Shuey trade: "I liked him a
lot--he's a good pitcher who has a big league career ahead of him.
Obviously, you have to give up quality to get quality, and I don't
think Cleveland has to worry about being cheated in this trade."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy on Rodriguez: "I'd compare him a lot to Pedro Astacio, not
Pedro Martinez. He has the same mannerisms, the same kind of stuff."</TE>

<HD>Ashby Hurts His Situation</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: He gives up key hits to Aurilia and Kent as the
depleted Giants earn a 3-1 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Perhaps Dodger pitcher Andy Ashby missed the memo or failed to notice
teammate Omar Daal's quotes in Sunday's newspapers.</LD>
<LD>   Rich Aurilia and Jeff Kent were the only real threats in an
injury-ravaged San Francisco lineup, but Ashby went right at them in
the first inning of Sunday's 3-1 loss as if Barry Bonds and Reggie
Sanders--sidelined by right hamstring strains--were still in the
lineup behind them.</LD>
<LD>   The two Giants took advantage of two tasty Ashby offerings, as
Aurilia doubled over center fielder Dave Roberts' head and Kent
smashed a two-run home run to left, and that was all the offense San
Francisco would need before 41,642 in Pac Bell Park.</LD>
<TE>   Giant right-hander Jason Schmidt took advantage of home plate
umpire John Hirschbeck's liberal strike zone, limiting the Dodgers to
one run and four hits and striking out 10 in seven innings to end the
Dodgers' win streak at two games and drop them five games behind
Arizona in the National League West. The Dodgers lead the Giants by
one game in the wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco reliever Tim Worrell retired the side in order in
the eighth, and closer Robb Nen struck out the side in the ninth for
his 28th save, stifling a Dodger team that seemed to snap out of its
offensive funk with 16 runs and 29 hits in two previous games.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers struck out 14 times, one shy of their season high,
four times on called third strikes. Brian Jordan and Mark
Grudzielanek each struck out three times, and Jordan went down
looking twice.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like to bad-mouth the umpires," Jordan said, "but it was
a tough day for the hitters."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if Hirschbeck's strike zone was too high, too low or too
wide, Jordan said, "It was all over, but mostly it was away. A lot of
pitches away were called strikes. You start giving up on those
pitches, and then you start swinging at a lot of bad pitches. We
swung at a lot of bad pitches today."</TE>
<TE>   Some Dodgers barked at Hirschbeck, and some just stood in the box
with the bat on their shoulders, shaking their heads at his calls.</TE>
<TE>   "You try not to let it get in your head, you try to stay with it,
and it's tough," Grudzielanek said. "How do you handle it? You have
to adjust, and it was tough to adjust with the throwers they had out
there today."</TE>
<TE>   Schmidt (6-5) had excellent command of his 95-mph fastball, and as
Hirschbeck's strike zone widened, so did Schmidt's pitches.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said Ashby also benefited from
Hirschbeck's zone--Ashby blanked the Giants from the second through
sixth innings--but two of Ashby's pitches in the first caught too
much of the strike zone.</TE>
<TE>   "It's safe to say," Tracy said, "there's one pitch Ashby would
like back."</TE>
<TE>   After Daal limited the Giants to one run and two hits in six
innings Saturday, the left-hander said he pitched around Aurilia and
Kent, "because everyone knows you don't want to get beat by them,"
Daal said.</TE>
<TE>   But Ashby grooved a 3-and-1 pitch to Aurilia, who doubled in the
first, and a first-pitch cut-fastball to Kent, who hit his 18th homer
of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "That early in the game, I was just trying to get into a groove,
to get ahead, and I didn't make pitches," Ashby said. "It's too bad
that cost me the game."</TE>
<TE>   Kent's homer wiped out a 1-0 lead the Dodgers had built in the top
of the first when Roberts singled to left and Shawn Green, with
Roberts running, hit a line drive past the glove of first baseman
J.T. Snow and into the right-field corner for an RBI double.</TE>
<TE>   But the Dodgers advanced only three other runners to second base
the rest of the game, and Ashby, winless in his last six starts, fell
to 7-9.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants added a run in the eighth when Snow doubled off
reliever Paul Quantrill and Shawon Dunston hit a two-out RBI single.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to give credit to their pitcher," Tracy said of
Schmidt. "Very little, if anything, was over the middle of the plate.
We were not over-anxious. His pitch count [104 in seven innings] was
up. He pitched well, and you have to recognize that."</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Get Shuey to Fill Out Bullpen</HD>
<DH>Baseball: L.A. trades three pitchers, including Mulholland
and top prospect, to Cleveland for veteran right-hander.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The Dodgers gave their bullpen a significant shot in the arm with
Sunday's acquisition of hard-throwing setup man Paul Shuey from the
Cleveland Indians, but it came at a considerable cost.</LD>
<LD>   The centerpiece of the package going to Cleveland is triple-A
pitcher Ricardo Rodriguez, a 6-foot-3, 165-pound right-hander from
the Dominican Republic whom Baseball America tabbed the
organization's No. 1 prospect.</LD>
<LD>   That will probably cause concerned Dodger fans to hark back to the
1993 deal that sent another promising young Dominican
right-hander--Pedro Martinez--to Montreal for second baseman Delino
DeShields.</LD>
<TE>   The Dodgers also gave up seldom-used reliever Terry Mulholland,
whose $3-million salary will offset the $2.75 million Shuey makes
this season, and Class-A pitcher Alberto Cruceta for Shuey, who is in
the second year of a four-year, $11.2-million contract that ends
after the 2004 season.</TE>
<TE>   "We like Ricardo Rodriguez a lot," Dodger General Manager Dan
Evans said. "Baseball America had him as our No. 1; that may not
reflect our assessments, but he's a very good prospect, no question.</TE>
<TE>   "But at the same time, we're getting [an eight-year] veteran who
knows how to handle the pressure of a pennant race, and we feel this
guy will help us for years to come. Had [Shuey] not had a multiyear
deal, Rodriguez wouldn't have been discussed."</TE>
<TE>   It's difficult to assess the deal's long-term impact, because it
remains to be seen how Rodriguez--who was 5-4 with a 1.99 earned-run
average at double-A Jacksonville before his recent promotion to
triple-A Las Vegas--will develop, but there's no doubt the trade
bolstered the Dodgers' playoff hopes this season.</TE>
<TE>   Shuey, 31, is 3-0 with a 2.41 ERA in 39 games this season,
striking out 39 and walking 10 in 37 1/3 innings, and has limited
opponents to a .225 average. The right-hander's fastball has been
clocked at 94-96 mph, he has an outstanding split-fingered fastball
and a good curveball, and he's been tougher on left-handers (.194)
than right-handers (.254).</TE>
<TE>   "He's one of the top five nastiest guys I've ever faced because of
that splitter," said Dodger right fielder Shawn Green, a former
Toronto Blue Jay. "Any bullpen he's in, he's going to strengthen."</TE>
<TE>   Shuey, who received $500,000 from the Indians to waive his
no-trade clause to come to Los Angeles, gives the Dodgers two
reliable setup men--Shuey and Paul Quantrill--in front of closer Eric
Gagne and pushes Giovanni Carrara back to middle relief, to which he
is more suited.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not going to see guys with better stuff than him," said
Dodger center fielder Dave Roberts, a teammate of Shuey's in
Cleveland. "Believe it or not, it's comparable to Gagne's when he's
on. He's nasty, and that's huge for us. You talk about Gagne making
it an eight-inning game; with him and Quantrill, we can make it a
six- or seven-inning game."</TE>
<TE>   When the trade came together late Saturday night, Shuey called
Roberts, "and he had nothing but great things to say," said Shuey,
whose Indian teams reached the postseason four times from 1996-2001.
"That pretty much cemented the deal."</TE>
<TE>   So did the fact that the Dodgers lead the National League
wild-card race while the Indians, 17 1/2 games behind Minnesota in
the American League Central, are rebuilding.</TE>
<TE>   "This hasn't been a year where I've had a lot of butterflies in
the bullpen," Shuey said on a conference call with Dodger writers.
"I'm looking forward to getting those butterflies back, getting back
into the thick of things."</TE>
<TE>   Shuey has been on the disabled list 11 times, most because of leg
injuries, the most recent a left groin strain that sidelined him in
June. That was a factor in his decision to waive his no-trade clause.</TE>
<TE>   "The climate has changed here--I don't think these guys are going
to fight for it for a while," Shuey told Cleveland writers earlier
Sunday. "I'm going to a team where I can fight for it now. If I had
given up on this....</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how much longer I can pitch. As you guys know, I'm
not that genetically sound of a guy. L.A. is leading the wild-card
race, and that's where I want to go.... Right now, I'm a luxury I
don't think the Indians need."</TE>
<TE>   And one the Dodgers, whose bullpen has faltered recently, believe
they couldn't live without.</TE>
<TE>   "The bullpen is one of our strengths now, and we know Gagne,
Quantrill and Shuey will be part of the club for the next three
years," Evans said.</TE>

<LD>"Hey, L.A. Times!" bellowed the boom-box voice years ago from across
the compound at Rams Park.</LD>
<LD>   Uh oh.</LD>
<LD>   Marv Goux, the longtime USC and Rams' assistant coach who died
Saturday at 69 of cancer, was a chain-of-command guy who expected
level-best performances from his players and his papers.</LD>
<TE>   Mortified of having committed a journalistic gaffe, not uncommon
for a young beat writer, I met Goux halfway across the asphalt

<TE>   "I have a problem," Goux said.</TE>
<TE>   "What's that?"</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not getting my newspaper on time in the morning," Goux said.</TE>
<TE>   The guy was serious.</TE>
<TE>   Goux left for work at 6 a.m. and needed the paper before he hopped
in the car.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't smile when I mentioned circulation wasn't my department.</TE>
<TE>   He reasoned football clubs and newspapers were both teams.
Everyone had to hold up their end or the game plan collapsed. If the
line didn't block, the quarterback couldn't pass, and if the delivery
boy overslept it didn't matter what I wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Goux, of course, was right, and for a fleeting moment I felt what
it must have felt like in the USC locker room before one of Goux's
legendary pep talks.</TE>
<TE>   Do your job. Do it right.</TE>
<TE>   Block your man. Get to the end zone.</TE>
<TE>   Get the paper out.</TE>
<TE>   I hope Marv got his today.</TE>

<TE>   News item: Lance Armstrong wins fourth straight Tour de France.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Too bad one of sport's most unbelievable
achievements has to come with minority chants of Dop-AY (doped) along
the way. The problem with cycling is that, like boxing, it has become
so polluted with scandal you have to be careful about raising up
heroes.</TE>
<TE>   But if Armstrong, who overcame cancer and has never tested
positive for a banned substance, doesn't qualify, then neither does
Neil Armstrong.</TE>

got in over their sanitary socks in gambling debts and may have fixed
games to make good on bets. The team, if you read between the betting
lines, was the New York Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   Franzese may have as much credibility as Enron, yet baseball has
no choice but to investigate this story with the tenacity in which it

<TE>   News item: John Daly uses Super Glue to close a hand wound during

<HD>Record Victory for Hayes</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>J.P. Hayes won his second PGA Tour title, closing with a
four-under-par 67 for a four-stroke victory Sunday over Robert Gamez
in the John Deere Classic at Silvis, Ill.</LD>
<LD>   Hayes had a 22-under 262 total on the TPC at Deere Run, the lowest
score in relation to par in tournament history.</LD>
<LD>   "I always believed I'd win again," Hayes said. "I'm going to go
out and give it 110% every tournament and that will never change."</LD>
<TE>   After beginning the round tied for the lead with Gamez at 18
under, Hayes birdied the first two holes to take control. Hayes had
birdies on Nos. 11 and 17 in his bogey-free round.</TE>
<TE>   Hayes earned a career-high $540,000, along with a two-year
exemption on the tour.</TE>
<TE>   Gamez, winless since 1990, bogeyed the second hole to fall three
strokes back, and couldn't pick up any ground on Hayes. Gamez earned
$324,000, nearly doubling his earnings for the year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gloria Park, 22, earned her second LPGA Tour victory by making a
six-foot birdie putt on the first playoff hole to beat Hee-Won Han in
the Big Apple Classic at New Rochelle, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Park won $142,500 and got a hug and an apology from her father
after prevailing in her first playoff.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a big fight with my dad last night about my putting stroke.
I cried for two hours and couldn't sleep," Park said.</TE>
<TE>   Park and Han, both from South Korea, held off Annika Sorenstam in
the final group of the day and finished at 14-under 270. Sorenstam
shot a one-under 70 and missed the playoff by one stroke.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bob Gilder's even disposition held up better than his bogeyless
streak in the FleetBoston Classic at Concord, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   His calm and his birdie on the third extra hole gave him his
second consecutive playoff victory on the senior tour as he defeated
John Mahaffey, who surged into contention with a 65.</TE>
<TE>   Mahaffey, who started the day tied for 10th and five strokes
behind Gilder, played the round in seven under after playing the back
nine in five under.</TE>
<TE>   Gilder, who had played 64 consecutive holes without a bogey,
picked the worst time to get one--on the 18th, a 521-yard par five.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Thorpe needed to make only a five-foot putt for a birdie and
the victory. But Thorpe went past the hole by six feet and just
missed coming back.</TE>
<TE>   Gilder shot 70 to finish at 13-under 203.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Japan's Noboru Sugai shot a three-over 74 to finish at three-under
281 and hold off Canadian John Irwin for a two-shot victory in the
Senior British Open at Newcastle, Northern Ireland.</TE>
<TE>   Five-time British Open champion Tom Watson had a triple-bogey
seven on the second hole and shot an eight-over 79, finishing in a
tie for 14th place.</TE>

<HD>A Storybook Moment for Smith</HD>
<DH>Baseball: The definitive shortstop gives a most definitive
speech as he goes into the Hall of Fame.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>COOPERSTOWN, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Fighting back a tear or two, Ozzie Smith joined baseball's elite
Sunday, accepting his position in the Hall of Fame with a wonderful
speech that aptly described his storybook life.</LD>
<LD>   "This is tough," Smith, the only former player to be elected this
year, said, halting to brush away a tear after his son, Dustin, read
the inscription on his plaque. "I've faced many challenges in my
career, and if I was to rank them by difficulty, this moment in
Cooperstown would rank at the top of the list. It's almost an
impossible task to express in 20 short minutes a journey that has
taken me over 20 years to complete."</LD>
<LD>   Not surprisingly, the man who took the defensive aspect of the
shortstop position to another level during his 19-year career
accomplished that--thanking everyone from his mom, Marvella, to his
high school coach, to the man who brought him to St. Louis, former
manager Whitey Herzog.</LD>
<TE>   Comparing his life to Dorothy's journey down the Yellow Brick Road
in "The Wizard of Oz" and holding a copy of the famed children's book
in his hands, Smith, 47, recounted every critical aspect of his
baseball life and detailed what made him a success: the mind to dream
that the Scarecrow cherished, a heart to believe that the Tin Man
ached for, and the courage of the Lion to persevere.</TE>
<TE>   "Ozzie Smith was a boy who decided to look within, a boy who
discovered that absolutely nothing is good enough if it can be made
better, a boy who discovered an old-fashioned formula that would take
him beyond the rainbow, beyond even his wildest dreams," said Smith,
flanked by 46 Hall of Famers, including former Cardinal greats Stan
Musial, Bob Gibson, Lou Brock and Red Schoendienst.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, who holds six career fielding marks for shortstops,
including most assists (8,375), double plays (1,590), and chances
(12,624), revealed a couple of his secrets.</TE>
<TE>   His first glove was a paper bag, and he used to lie on the floor
of his house in Watts, close his eyes and toss a baseball into the
air, then catch it without looking at it. Over and over. He also
would throw a baseball over the roof of the house, then try to run
around and catch it.</TE>
<TE>   "No, I never caught it," Smith, who won 13 straight NL Gold Glove
awards, said with a smile. "But it never stopped me from trying."</TE>
<TE>   In a summer that has been hard on St. Louis fans with the deaths
of longtime Cardinal broadcaster Jack Buck and pitcher Darryl Kile,
Smith, who retired in 1996, gave them and the audience of 19,000
present a reason to smile.</TE>
<TE>   "I sincerely believe that there is nothing truly great in any man
or woman, except their character, their willingness to move beyond
the realm of self and into a greater realm of selflessness," Smith
said before reading a poem he dedicated to the memory of Buck.</TE>
<TE>   "Giving back is the ultimate talent in life," Smith said. "That is
the greatest trophy on my mantel."</TE>
<TE>   Also honored were longtime Detroit sportswriter Joe Falls, who was
given the J.G. Taylor Spink Award for his six decades of work, and
Phillie broadcaster Harry Kalas, who accepted the Ford C. Frick
Award.</TE>

<HD>Nakatani's Comeback Going Strong</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DEL MAR</DL>
<LD>Corey Nakatani's comeback is in full throttle, less than a week after
it began.</LD>
<LD>   Sidelined since May 2, when he suffered a concussion in a spill at
Hollywood Park, Nakatani had his first mounts on Wednesday, opening
day at Del Mar. He won his first races on Friday night, the second of
two wins coming with Humorous Lady in the filly division of the
California Thoroughbred Breeders Assn. Stakes.</LD>
<LD>   After another win Saturday, Nakatani was reunited with a familiar
friend in Sarafan on Sunday and alertly rode the 5-year-old gelding
to a 1 1/4-length win over Beat Hollow, the 1-2 favorite, in the
$400,000 Eddie Read Handicap.</LD>
<TE>   Nakatani sounded ambitious.</TE>
<TE>   "If I can get the opportunities, I think I have a realistic shot
at leading the meet," he said. "I'm healthy again and I'm focused.
I'm hoping for the best."</TE>
<TE>   Nakatani, 31, has won two Del Mar titles, the most recent in 1998.
Nakatani's previous wins in the Eddie Read were with Fastness in 1996
and Approach The Bench in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Nakatani had ridden Sarafan four times for trainer Neil Drysdale
earlier this year, including the Fair Grounds race in March in which
owner Gary Tanaka's horse first defeated Beat Hollow. In five U.S.
starts, Beat Hollow's only two losses have come against Sarafan.</TE>
<TE>   In Sunday's race, before a crowd of 19,665, Nakatani tracked Beat
Hollow behind the two leaders, Redattore and Night Patrol, but when
it seemed as though no room was going to open inside, the jockey
swung his mount to the outside. Sarafan passed Beat Hollow and took
the lead with an eighth of a mile left.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Beat Hollow and his rider, Alex Solis, got clear,
Sarafan had an insurmountable lead. Beat Hollow finished a neck in
front of Redattore, last year's Eddie Read winner, in the six-horse
field.</TE>
<TE>   "It was bad luck," Solis said. "I didn't want to be in that
pocket, but the way the race came up, I didn't have much choice.
Those horses fanned out in front of me and I had nowhere to go. Stuff
happens sometimes. It happened here."</TE>
<TE>   Sarafan finished 1 1/8 miles on grass in 1:46 3/5, tying the
course record set by Al Mamoon when he won the Eddie Read in 1986.
The winner carried 117 pounds, five less than Beat Hollow.</TE>
<TE>   The second choice, Sarafan paid $10.80 and earned $240,000, which
sent his career purses over the $1-million mark. This was only his
third win in 16 starts since the horse left England and was sent to
Drysdale less than two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a little bit of a hard head," Nakatani said. "He's got a
mind of his own, but he has a ton of ability. I'm glad I got to work
him in the morning. I knew he had a great turn of foot to give me,
and he felt strong all the way. It makes a big difference when you're
feeling healthy. I've got my confidence back, and hopefully this is
going to lead to bigger and better things."</TE>
<TE>   Drysdale, who won the Eddie Read with Deputy Governor in 1988,
said that Sarafan might run in the Arlington Million on Aug. 17.</TE>
<TE>   "When they came to the stretch, I had a lot of horse," said Laffit
Pincay, who rode Redattore. "But they came pretty strong at the end."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In an earlier stake, the $100,000 Fleet Treat for California-bred
3-year-old fillies, undefeated Bear Fan registered her third win,
beating Nicole's Pursuit by 7 1/2 lengths in 1:22 3/5 for seven
furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   Bear Fan, paying $2.80 under Mike Smith, had won her two previous
starts, both this year, by nine lengths.</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Wesley Ward bred Bear Fan and also owns her in a
partnership with Peter Fan, a Hong Kong plastics executive.</TE>
<TE>   "She was so big that I wanted to give her some time before racing
her," Ward said. "She was a beautiful foal, but you can find a lot of
beautiful foals. You don't know what's inside them until they run."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Bailey won eight races and three stakes the last two days at
Saratoga, the last of his hot weekend a 3 3/4-length win with
Dancethruthedawn in the $250,000 Go For Wand Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   The upstate New York track drew 50,441 Sunday, with one of the
attractions a Bailey bobblehead doll giveaway.</TE>
<TE>   "You can do a lot of things," said Bailey, a Hall of Fame jockey,
"but in the eyes of my son Justin, I hadn't arrived until they made a
bobblehead after me."</TE>

<LD>Horse racing fans who missed the $250,000 Test Stakes on Saturday at
Saratoga should make every effort to see a replay.</LD>
<LD>   The 77th renewal of the Grade I for 3-year-old fillies was
arguably the best in the history of the Test and belongs on a list of
the great races in the history of the sport.</LD>
<LD>   At the wire, You, the 4-5 favorite, had beaten the talented New
York-bred Carson Hollow by the slimmest of noses after a stretch
duel. As track announcer Tom Durkin aptly said at the conclusion, it
was a photo finish that didn't deserve a loser.</LD>
<TE>   For You, it was her seventh victory in 11 starts and her fifth
Grade I score since she was purchased privately by trainer Bobby
Frankel for owner Edmund Gann last summer.</TE>
<TE>   Both the daughter of You and I and jockey Jerry Bailey showed
exceptional courage, overcoming some early trouble, then squeezing
through a narrow opening to battle a gutty Carson Hollow all the way
to the wire. Those who think Bailey may be on the decline should be
forced to watch the replay of the Test over and over.</TE>
<TE>   A daughter of Carson City who had won her first four starts by a
combined 27 lengths, Carson Hollow lost nothing in defeat. She set
torrid fractions (21 3/5 and 44 1/5) for the seven-furlong distance
and she refused to yield when challenged by You on her inside.</TE>
<TE>   This race came about an hour after Frankel had won another
thriller with Tates Creek--and Bailey--edging favorite Voodoo Dancer
in the $500,000 Diana Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Blind Ambition, who provided Chris McCarron with
his second-to-last win as a jockey on June 23, makes her two turn and
turf debut in today's seventh at Del Mar, a $57,000 allowance for
California-bred fillies and mares.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Jim Chapman. The trainer has struck with two longshots
at Del Mar already, Humorous Lady, who was 40-1 when winning the CTBA
Stakes on Friday and Posadas, who won Saturday's ninth at 20-1.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Scott Lake. The trainer, who ranks second behind Steve
Asmussen in wins for the year, didn't hit the board with any of his
first seven starters at Saratoga.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four using Double Shot Latte, Sainte
Maxime and Bel Air Belle in the fifth, singling A Colt For David in
the sixth, Surprisingly, Blind Ambition and Sunset Serenade in the
seventh and Sonoita, Rippin N Roarin and Sunday In Moscow in the
eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 4/9. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $29.80/$57.20. Total money bet: $88.</TE>

<HD>Union, Owners Continue Talks</HD>
<DH>Baseball: If negotiations go nowhere, the players might
discuss setting strike date for as soon as Aug. 16.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSS NEWHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Baseball's labor negotiations, mired in differences over revenue
sharing and yet to tackle the thornier issue of a payroll tax, resume
in New York today.</LD>
<LD>   Sources close to the process say that barring a sudden surge of
progress in the talks, the executive board of the players' union
could confer by telephone as soon as Friday or, more likely, early
next week to set a strike date.</LD>
<LD>   Although a large group of players has emerged from executive
director Don Fehr's series of briefings with each of the clubs
thinking that the union has tentatively targeted Sept. 16 as a strike
date (as reported recently by The Times and other media outlets),
Fehr and his staff insist they have not decided on a date or
determined if one is necessary.</LD>
<TE>   But according to sources, if the union concludes that negotiations
are going nowhere and calls for an executive board vote as soon as
Friday or early next week, the strike date might be set for as soon
as Aug. 16.</TE>
<TE>   The union is also believed to have circled Sept. 1 and Sept. 28,
but the likely choice, the sources believe, is between Aug. 16 and
Sept. 16.</TE>
<TE>   Said a high-ranking baseball official Sunday:</TE>
<TE>   "The clubs continue to tell me that their players think Sept. 16
is the date, but that could be strictly speculation.</TE>
<TE>   "If the union is determined to set a date, thinking it would serve
some purpose, it could be August, as it was in '94."</TE>
<TE>   The union, hoping to spark negotiations and avoid the prospect of
the owners declaring an impasse and unilaterally implementing new
work rules, set a 1994 strike date of Aug. 14 about two weeks before
that.</TE>
<TE>   When that deadline failed to produce an agreement, the players
began a strike, the World Series was ultimately canceled and the
232-day stoppage ended only when a federal judge found the owners,
who had implemented new work rules, guilty of illegal labor practice.</TE>
<TE>   If the players this time go out Aug. 16 or so, they would run the
risk of losing three paychecks (they are paid on the 15th and 30th of
each month during the regular season), but they would have about six
weeks to reach an agreement that could save the postseason.</TE>
<TE>   If they went out Sept. 16, they would lose only one paycheck and
ensure that they would be playing Sept. 11, the date of last year's
terrorist attacks and a major public relations consideration.
However, the window for saving the postseason would be much narrower.</TE>
<TE>   Fehr continues to say the issues are solvable and that a strike
date is a last resort, but he also believes that a deadline can
stimulate the talks.</TE>
<TE>   Basically, there are three major issues, and the sides seem within
compromise distance on two.</TE>
<TE>   * Simplistically, they agree on the concept of one worldwide draft
and only have to compromise on the number of rounds.</TE>
<TE>   * On revenue sharing, they are basically separated by only $70
million--the owners at about $298 million and the players at $228
million--in the amount to be shared.</TE>
<TE>   In an industry that produces revenue of $3.6 billion or more, that
would seem to be a difference easily compromised, but they also
differ over method of distribution.</TE>
<TE>   Management favors a straight pool that calls for the money to be
spread evenly among the 30 teams.</TE>
<TE>   The union favors a split pool that would find more money going to
the smaller-revenue teams even while taking less from the New York
Yankees and other big-market teams that drive the salary scale.</TE>
<TE>   There is also an issue of how much money will be taken from
baseball's central fund--repository for national TV and licensing
revenue--to help finance the revenue-sharing pool, but the debate, as
union lawyer Steve Fehr said, is over "methodology" and not the
"magnitude" of the $70-million difference.</TE>
<TE>   He said this after the sides met for five hours Thursday and for
an hour Friday before separating to review where they were on the
subject and continue exploring ways to merge, perhaps, the split- and
straight-pool concepts.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Manfred, baseball's executive vice president for labor
relations, was unusually upbeat after Thursday's meeting, but there
is speculation that he is attempting to paint a rosier picture so as
to increase the onus on the players if they strike.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, there is enough onus to go around, and even with an
agreement on the draft and revenue sharing, that still leaves the
contentious subject of a payroll tax that the union considers
tantamount to a salary cap, even though it agreed to a three-year tax
trial at basically inconsequential thresholds in the last bargaining
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   What to expect this week (besides Thursday's arbitration decision
on the union's contraction grievance)?</TE>
<TE>   Based on the eight work stoppages that have evolved from every
previous labor negotiation, the safe bet is that the union's
executive board can be expecting a call from the conference operator
soon.</TE>

<LD>Bill Elliott stalked Sterling Marlin throughout the race, finally
passed him with 21 laps left Sunday and took the crash- and
rain-delayed Pennsylvania 500 to set a record with his fifth career
victory at Pocono Raceway in Long Pond, Pa.</LD>
<LD>   The victory was the first on the mountaintop since 1989 for the
46-year-old driver from Dawsonville, Ga.</LD>
<LD>   It also was the 42nd in the career of the 1988 NASCAR champion.</LD>
<TE>   The race turned into a marathon of 6 hours 35 minutes 51 seconds
because of an accident involving Steve Park on the first lap. Park
was not injured in the crash, which forced a 65-minute delay while
repairs were made to the infield retaining wall just beyond the first
turn.</TE>
<TE>   Less than a half-hour later, rain caused another red flag, which
halted the $3.7-million event for an additional 2:02 after the 27th
of 175 laps.</TE>
<TE>   The race was halted 25 laps short of its scheduled distance
because of darkness.</TE>

<HD>Valentin Makes Most of Chances Again for Mets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Valentin has one of the toughest jobs in baseball, and he's
getting very good at it.</LD>
<LD>   Starting in place of the ailing Edgardo Alfonzo, Valentin hit a
two-run double with two out in the seventh inning to send the Mets
past the Cincinnati Reds, 6-5, Sunday at New York.</LD>
<LD>   Signed as a free agent last winter, the 11-year veteran has 23
runs batted in in only 134 at-bats this season, many as a
pinch-hitter.</LD>
<TE>   "John has made some of the best adjustments," Met Manager Bobby
Valentine said. "He keeps himself ready to play. He has a regular
program and sometimes even hits during the game to keep himself
sharp. He savors these chances when he gets to start."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Trachsel got stronger over seven solid innings, and some
shaky Cincinnati defense helped the Mets recover from a 4-0 deficit
after four innings. New York took two of the three one-run games in a
key series between playoff contenders.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Griffey Jr. homered for the Reds, who are tied with the Mets
for third in the NL wild-card race--within striking distance of the
Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 10, Chicago 9--Edgar Renteria's three-run homer in the
bottom of the ninth inning gave the Cardinals the victory.</TE>
<TE>   Renteria drove in four runs as the Cardinals came back from a 6-0
deficit after three innings.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals entered the ninth trailing, 9-4, but Fernadno Vina
led off the inning with an infield single.</TE>
<TE>   An RBI double by pinch-hitter Miguel Cairo scored Vina and an RBI
single by Jim Edmonds brought in closer Antonio Alfonseca.</TE>
<TE>   Alfonseca (1-2) walked Albert Pujols, struck out J.D. Drew and
gave up an RBI single to Tino Martinez before Renteria hit a towering
shot to left-center to end the game.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona 5, San Diego 4--Luis Gonzalez hit a game-winning single in
the 10th inning at Phoenix and also had an inside-the-park home run
in the fifth to lead the Diamondbacks to their seventh consecutive
victory.</TE>
<TE>   Junior Spivey singled and stole second before Gonzalez, who went
four for four, singled to center off San Diego closer Trevor Hoffman
(1-2). The win gave the Diamondbacks their first 7-0 homestand.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona starter Brian Anderson struck out a career-high 11 in
eight innings. He gave up two runs and five hits.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 4, Florida 1--Bartolo Colon pitched a two-hitter for his
seventh complete game of the season, and Jose Vidro and Fernando
Tatis homered to lead the Expos at Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   Colon (4-1) held the Marlins to a one-out double by Eric Owens in
the first and Andy Fox's two-out triple in the eighth. Colon, who has
one career one-hitter, struck out nine and walked one.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 7, Atlanta 1--Scott Rolen homered, and a strong
outing by Vicente Padilla carried the Phillies at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   The Braves lost two of three games during the weekend at Turner
Field--their first series loss since May 7-9 against the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   Jimmy Rollins had three RBIs for the Phillies.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 5, Colorado 3--Ronnie Belliard hit a tiebreaking two-run
single in the sixth inning at Milwaukee as the Brewers completed
their first series sweep against the Rockies.</TE>
<TE>   The Brewers, who have the worst record in the NL, swept the
three-game series and have won four in a row overall.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 4, Pittsburgh 0--Wade Miller and four relievers combined
on a five-hitter at Houston as the Astros shut out the Pirates for
the third time in four games. Houston swept the four-game series,
outscoring Pittsburgh, 19-3. The Pirates hadn't been shut out three
times in four games since August 1986.</TE>

<KH>Mike Penner SOUND AND VISION</KH>
<HD>Armstrong Is Not Exactly Tiger in CBS' Eye</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Penner</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first one made him the most remarkable human-interest story in
sports.</LD>
<LD>   The second one proved the first one wasn't a fluke.</LD>
<LD>   The third one threw him into a vicious circle of rumor and
innuendo that has yet to be substantiated--or completely shaken.</LD>
<TE>   And now, what are we to make of Lance Armstrong's fourth
consecutive victory at the Tour de France?</TE>
<TE>   The world media, at this point, remain divided.</TE>
<TE>   According to various reports over the weekend, Armstrong is:</TE>
<TE>   a) Batman. "With his golden tunic flying behind him in the wind,"
cycling commentator Paul Sherwen says, "he resembles a Caped
Crusader."</TE>
<TE>   b) Superman. As Armstrong blew away the field in Saturday's Stage
19 time trial, Sherwen's broadcast partner, Phil Liggett, christened
the 30-year-old Texan as "the Superman of world cycling."</TE>
<TE>   c) Robin Hood. Sherwen, not satisfied with scope of 20th-century
superheroes available for comparison, came back Sunday to describe
Armstrong and his United States Postal Service teammates as "Robin
Hood surrounded by his merry men."</TE>
<TE>   d) A higher power than all of the above combined.</TE>
<TE>   During a wrap-up montage of the three-week-long Tour, CBS' cameras
focused on a bit of graffiti painted on a stretch of French blacktop:</TE>
<TE>   "LANCE IS GOD"</TE>
<TE>   If so, CBS kept Sunday services to the barest minimum--one hour,
including commercial breaks for the deity's host of corporate
sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   You might think the Armstrong story is worthy of more, especially
if you happened onto CBS' sports Web site Saturday and studied the
results of a fan poll asking, "Whose accomplishments have been more
impressive, Lance Armstrong or Tiger Woods?"</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong beat Woods, 76.8% to 23.2%.</TE>
<TE>   CBS could easily devote more than an hour to Tiger and a bucket of
balls at the driving range. But Armstrong, a cancer survivor who has
won the world's most demanding sporting competition four years
running, gets only the quick canned-and-cut treatment on Tour
Sundays. CBS leaves the everyday grunt work to the tiny Outdoor Life
Network, which features Liggett and Sherwen providing colorful
commentary, provided your cable provider provides the Outdoor Life
Network.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, whose presence at a major provides the most drama and
suspense? Woods dominates his sport like no one before him, yet as
the British Open recently confirmed, he's always susceptible to an
out-of-nowhere blowout.</TE>
<TE>   Not Armstrong. He has made the Tour de France, with its hairpin
curves and lung-bursting mountain climbs, as predictable as an
assembly line. His riding style, predicated on a consistent rhythm he
actually measures with a "cadence sensor," is mechanical, robotic,
unstoppable. Liggett likens it to a metronome.</TE>
<TE>   By now, even the most casual observers have learned to tell time
according to Armstrong.</TE>
<TE>   If Armstrong is hanging back in the pack, laying low, the Tour is
in its first week.</TE>
<TE>   If Armstrong is heading for the mountains, the rest of the Tour is
in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   If Armstrong is riding into Paris, the other riders are already
planning for next year.</TE>
<TE>   It's tough drumming up enthusiasm for a foregone conclusion. CBS'
Armen Keteyian gave it a go, setting the stage for Sunday's telecast
this way:</TE>
<TE>   "Lance Armstrong has stared long and hard into the valley below.
[Swelling, melodramatic music wafts in the background.] Since then,
he's never looked anywhere ... but up. [More strings, more horns.]
For three weeks every year in France, it's best not to look away.
[Cue heroic trumpets.] Rather come away with the wind lifted up ...
by an ever-advancing armada of warriors on wheels."</TE>
<TE>   A rough start, but Keteyian, an award-winning investigative
reporter, seemed poised to rally during a prerecorded interview with
Armstrong.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, a surprise. Armstrong and his Postal Service team were
booed and heckled at various stages during the tour, greeted by
chants of "Dop-AY! Dop-AY!" during Thursday's ride up Mount Ventoux.
Yet, Keteyian asked no questions about the doping suspicions that
have followed Armstrong more relentlessly than any Tour rider despite
Armstrong's perfect record in passing drug tests.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong points to that record and declares the doping
speculation a non-issue. But how the host country reacts to the
four-time champion of its premier sporting event is an issue. CBS
chose to ignore it entirely, simply piling onto the celebratory
bandwagon instead.</TE>
<TE>   Keteyian did ask Armstrong if he could assess his standing among
cycling's greats, now that Armstrong has churned his way into their
company. Only four riders have won the Tour five times, and only one,
Spain's Miguel Indurain, has won five in a row. Armstrong can equal
that mark with another victory in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong hemmed and hawed and said, "I still look at myself as a
current cyclist. I don't look at myself as someone who broke a record
or joined an elite club.... At the end of the day, it's better to let
others do that."</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the day, at this rate, Armstrong could very well
look up and find himself with more Tour championships than anyone who

nowhere on the schedule.</TE>

<HD>A Much Wiser and Perhaps Finer Agassi</HD>

<LD>When Andre Agassi was 17, when he had hair below his shoulders and a
world of women, young and old, following him everywhere, when there
were parties to be attended and adoration to be accepted and
sometimes tennis to be played but maybe not practiced, it was hard to
imagine Agassi winning tournaments when he was 25.</LD>
<LD>   Now Agassi is 32. The hair is shaved and the only woman is Steffi
Graf, his wife and the mother of his son, Jaden Gil. There is a
coach, Darren Cahill, and a trainer, Gil Reyes. There aren't many
parties. There is the wonder of watching Jaden stop crying because he
can eat a banana and the joy of discovering how Jaden never sits
still, just like Graf.</LD>
<LD>   And it is entirely possible to imagine Agassi playing tennis and
winning tournaments when he is 37. It is not unimaginable to close
your eyes and see Agassi holding over his head a U.S. Open trophy
five years from now while a stadium filled with fans can't stop
cheering.</LD>
<TE>   Sunday in the finals of the Mercedes-Benz Cup, Agassi ran
25-year-old Jan-Michael Gambill into the ground. Agassi beat Gambill,
6-2, 6-4, and at the end Gambill was staggering to his chair,
searching out the shade while Agassi bowed and blew kisses to the
heat-addled patrons sitting in the sun at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Agassi had barely worked up a sweat in winning the title, the 53rd
of his career. In no way was it one of the most meaningful titles of
Agassi's career. Those would be any of his seven Grand Slams.</TE>
<TE>   But it was important. Agassi needs reassurance now. Every week he
searches for signs that his game isn't good enough, that he has
reached the age where there is no stopping the losing.</TE>
<TE>   This was Agassi's first tournament since his desultory
second-round Wimbledon loss to Paradorn Srichaphan. Agassi says he
will know in his heart when he is unable to win tournaments any more.
And he only wants to win tournaments. Being a quarterfinalist isn't
the point.</TE>
<TE>   So for nearly a month Agassi has had to wait and wonder. Is it
gone, his speed? Has it taken off, his strength? Is his superb timing
just average now?</TE>
<TE>   And then he came here and won.</TE>
<TE>   There is a serene fury about Agassi's tennis. There is precise
power. There is wisdom. A beaten Gambill would say later, in wonder,
that Agassi "plays better tennis than he used to. He's cleaned up his
errors. He doesn't make errors any more."</TE>
<TE>   That's the will of Agassi. The will to do it right, to hit hard
but not too hard. To play the angles but not the sharpest angle.
"I've learned," Agassi says, "that it's good not to miss. It always
helps your cause if the ball goes back in play."</TE>
<TE>   It is also the will of Agassi to run longer and faster, to hit
harder and harder, to punish instead of be punished.</TE>
<TE>   That was proved in the second set. A rally had finished, a long
one of more than a dozen strokes. All the time Agassi had Gambill's
fate on the head of his own racket. Gambill was pushed along the
baseline, up to the net, back to the baseline and finally Agassi won
the point with a blistering backhand.</TE>
<TE>   Gambill dragged himself to the lone patch of shade and leaned on
his racket and gasped for air, for energy, for an answer to this man
across the net who is seven years older and so much more relentless.</TE>
<TE>   As this tournament progressed, each of Agassi's vanquished
competitors seemed awestruck by tennis' elder statesman.</TE>
<TE>   Gustavo Kuerten, beaten in a wonderfully fought Friday night
quarterfinal, said he only hoped to partly emulate Agassi's
professionalism and personality. "I try on the court with him to take
from him that energy," Kuerten, 26, said. "But when I am 32, I think
I will be on the beach."</TE>
<TE>   Max Mirnyi, the semifinal loser, said it was an honor to lose to
Agassi, "maybe the best player ever."</TE>
<TE>   And Gambill said it was his privilege to be beaten by the man with
the best return of serve ever.</TE>
<TE>   Agassi accepts this praise quietly. As a kid, when he would skip
from title to title making brash predictions and accepting as his due
the gushing admiration of a Barbra Streisand, Agassi was considered
too much the punk and not enough a tennis gentleman.</TE>
<TE>   Now Agassi is filled with the wisdom gained from his mistakes and
an understanding of how glorious it can be to be playing tennis so
well at the time when most men have had to move on.</TE>
<TE>   "The work is harder now," Agassi said. "It's harder to be away
from my child and my wife. On the other side of the coin, I'm at an
age where I have the ability and capacity to absorb everything more
and use it to my benefit."</TE>
<TE>   Agassi is more eager than a teenager to push his game ahead. "I
enjoy challenging myself," he said. "I enjoy playing the great
matches. I enjoy feeling my game in ways I've never felt it before."</TE>
<TE>   So Agassi moves on to the rest of the summer, continuing his
preparation for the U.S. Open and certain of his ability to win it.
This year, and the next, maybe the next after that. "Why not," Agassi
said. No reason could be found on this afternoon. And no one wanted
to.</TE>

<LD>Stanford forward Marcia Wallis scored two goals and University of
North Carolina defender Cat Reddick scored one, and the United States
under-21 women's national team defeated Germany, 3-1, Sunday at
Turku, Finland, to win the Nordic Cup for the fourth year in a row.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not easy to win a championship and even harder to defend
one," Coach Jerry Smith said.</LD>
<LD>   The Americans were beaten, 1-0, by Denmark Wednesday and needed a
four-goal victory over Greece on Friday and a loss by the Danes to
reach the championship match. They got both.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. beat Greece, 4-0, with Veronica Zepeda of Riverside
scoring one goal and assisting on another, and host Finland upset
Denmark, 2-1, to send the Americans to the final.</TE>
<TE>   Wallis had not scored in the eight-nation tournament. Her goals
came in the 21st and 47th minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "You just have to keep believing your next shot is going to go
in," she said, "and I had two good chances in this game."</TE>
<TE>   Martina Muller brought Germany to within a goal in the 52nd
minute, but Reddick sealed the victory 11 minutes later. The U.S. has
won the tournament five of the last six years.</TE>
<TE>   Norway routed Denmark, 5-1, to earn third place.</TE>
<TE>   Cruz Azul Captures 'Cuna'</TE>
<TE>   Cruz Azul won the final and most important of Mexico's preseason
tournaments, defeating Pachuca, 4-3, on penalty kicks after the teams
had tied, 1-1, to claim the "Cuna del Futbol" trophy for the third
time.</TE>
<TE>   Pachuca took the lead on a goal by Honduran forward Milton Nunez
in the 54th minute, but Uruguay World Cup striker Sebastian "Loco"
Abreu tied the score in the 65th.</TE>
<TE>   The Pumas of UNAM beat Atletico Celaya, 2-0, for third place.</TE>
<TE>   The Mexican league season opens Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Brazilians on the Move</TE>
<TE>   Three of Brazil's World Cup-winning players changed clubs over the
weekend, led by AC Milan's signing of Rivaldo.</TE>
<TE>   Rivaldo, 30, had been released by Barcelona and was the target of
several teams but accepted a three-year contract with the Italian
team that will pay him an estimated $4.4 million per year.</TE>
<TE>   He is Milan's third major signing in the off-season, following the
club's acquisition of Denmark striker Jon Dahl Tomasson from
Feyenoord of the Netherlands and Dutch midfielder Clarence Seedorf
from crosstown rival Inter Milan.</TE>
<TE>   Rivaldo's move means he will face Brazil teammate Ronaldo, who
plays for Inter, when the Milan derby matches are played.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be a huge party for all the fans," Rivaldo said. "I never
imagined that such a scenario could become reality and I am really
curious to see what it will be like."</TE>
<TE>   Milan also has two other Brazil World Cup winners: defender Roque
Junior and backup goalkeeper Dida.</TE>
<TE>   Also changing clubs were midfielders Juninho, 29, who was bought
from Atletico Madrid in Spain for $9.47 million by his former club,
Middlesbrough of England, and Gilberto Silva, 25, who was acquired by
English champion Arsenal from Atletico Minerio of Brazil for an
undisclosed fee.</TE>
<TE>   China Bids Bora Farewell</TE>
<TE>   Bora Milutinovic left China after a farewell banquet in Beijing,
where reports suggested the Chinese will abandon the "happy football"
philosophy of the coach who took them to the World Cup for the first
time.</TE>
<TE>   A report in the Sports Review quoted China's soccer leaders as
wanting a change of direction.</TE>
<TE>   "Soccer must have strict discipline," one official told the
newspaper. "The moment you start talking about enjoyment [it] will
only lead to a breakdown in team discipline and make training
chaotic."</TE>
<TE>   Ardiles Takes Over Racing</TE>
<TE>   Osvaldo "Ossie" Ardiles, whose inspired play on the wing helped
Argentina win the World Cup in 1978, has been hired as coach of
Racing Club of Buenos Aires.</TE>
<TE>   Ardiles takes over from Reinaldo "Mustard" Merlo, who led the club
to its first title in 35 years last season but quit last week because
he had not been given the resources to strengthen his team.</TE>
<TE>   The Argentine season started Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Wanchope to Have Surgery</TE>
<TE>   Costa Rica World Cup forward Paulo Wanchope will undergo knee
surgery in the United States this week and probably won't be
available to his club team, Manchester City of the English Premier
League, until early next year.</TE>

<HD>Playoff Spot Comes Quickly to Sparks</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: They rout Fever, 80-62, and become first in
WNBA to clinch postseason berth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a relatively routine Sunday afternoon, the Sparks took care of a
little WNBA business and began to sketch out their blueprint for the
postseason.</LD>
<LD>   By subduing Indiana, 80-62, before 13,141 at Staples Center, Los
Angeles (20-4) became the first WNBA team to clinch a playoff berth.
The victory, coupled with Houston's loss in New York, enabled the
Sparks to increase their lead in the Western Conference to two games.</LD>
<LD>   The game was a reminder of what makes the Sparks a formidable
opponent.</LD>
<TE>   For all their inside strength in Lisa Leslie, DeLisha Milton,
Latasha Byears and Marlies Askamp, the Sparks need good perimeter
shooting to force opposing defenses from surrounding their bigger
players on the inside.</TE>
<TE>   Enter Mwadi Mabika.</TE>
<TE>   The sixth-year guard, who celebrated her 26th birthday on
Saturday, has been the Sparks' best outside threat this season. And
when she has performances like Sunday's--a game-high 22 points, eight
rebounds and five assists--Mabika opens opportunities for the rest of
the Sparks too.</TE>
<TE>   "Anytime you have someone who can shoot the lights out, it gets
you a lot of cheapies and freebies on the inside," said Milton, who
had 12 points and three rebounds before fouling out. "Mwadi really
helps us out in that aspect. And the funny thing is, we really don't
run plays for her. She is so strong and athletic she can shoot over
anybody. Just imagine if we ran a lot of screens [to free] her. It
would be vicious."</TE>
<TE>   Added Leslie, who had 20 points and nine rebounds: "Mwadi's always
been our shooter. But she's so consistent this year. We pass out to
her, she puts it up, and more often than not it's going in. It feels
good to have someone who's going to make most of the shots she
shoots. It helps the rest of us relax."</TE>
<TE>   Mabika, who made nine of 14 shots overall and four of seven from
beyond the three-point arc, was modest about her play. "Everything is
just working out well," she said. "I decided early this year I had to
come out aggressive every night. And that's what I'm doing."</TE>
<TE>   Mabika quickly served notice it would be her day by drilling a
three-point shot to put the Sparks ahead, 6-2, at the 17:42 mark.
Minutes later, she scored six points during a 12-0 Spark spurt that
increased the lead to 22-6, and the Fever (10-14) never got the
deficit below double digits after that.</TE>
<TE>   On defense, the Sparks limited rookie forward Tamika Catchings to
10 points, eight below her league-leading average. They also
outrebounded the Fever, 42-26, and held Indiana to 35.4% shooting.
The Sparks made 50.7%.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the best team in the league one through 11," Indiana
Coach Nell Fortner said of L.A. "They don't even have to play all
their weapons. They can beat you with the first five."</TE>
<TE>   With Houston's loss Sunday, the Sparks have a two-game Western
Conference lead with eight regular-season games to go.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to keep doing what we did today," Leslie said. "We
executed our offense; we ran when we needed to, slowed down when we
needed to. Today we wanted to keep the turnovers down. You watch the
Lakers play, and you know they get to a point where they have to
tighten the screws. That's where we are now."</TE>
<TE>   Added Milton: "We're thinking 14 more games. That includes the
playoffs. We're not overlooking anybody, not trying to be conceited.
But we have to be in championship mode from now on."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In other WNBA games:</TE>
<TE>   Tamika Whitmore had 15 points and nine rebounds as the Liberty
defeated the Houston Comets, 62-56, at New York.... Sue Bird's 18
points led the Seattle Storm over the Detroit Shock, 72-59, at Auburn
Hills, Mich.... Katie Douglas made a running one-hander in the lane
with 55 seconds to go in overtime to help the Orlando Miracle defeat
the Rockers at Cleveland, 76-70.... Yolando Griffith had 21 points
and 12 rebounds to lift the host Sacramento Monarchs over the
Minnesota Lynx, 66-56.</TE>

<LD>Consistent head-high surf is expected today at the Philips U.S. Open
of Surfing in Huntington Beach, remnants of Hurricane Elida off the
coast of Baja. According to Surfline, the surf forecasting service
for the event, the tropical south swell will peak this afternoon with
some sets shooting through the Huntington Beach pier two to three
feet overhead. Hurricane Douglas, which also originated off Baja,
created similar conditions Thursday along Southern California
beaches.</LD>
<LD>   The best surf of the event is expected to dissipate by the time
current and former world champions C.J. Hobgood, Kelly Slater, Sunny
Garcia, Tom Curren, Lisa Andersen and Pauline Menczer compete later
this week, but a round of Southern Hemisphere swells should keep
waves chest high and very contestable. Competition begins at 7 a.m.
today, Tuesday and Wednesday, and at 8 a.m. Thursday through Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The $100,000 men's final is Sunday at 4:30 p.m., preceded by the
semifinals at 2:30 p.m. The $10,000 junior final is scheduled for
3:30 p.m. The $30,000 women's final is scheduled for Saturday at 4
p.m., preceded by the $10,000 longboard final at 2 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   Free bleacher seating is available on a first-come first-served
basis. All-day parking is available for $6 in city and state lots
adjacent to the beach and metered spaces along Pacific Coast Highway.
In addition to surfing, the U.S. Open will include an action sports,
technology and music festival, live concerts and BMX and
skateboarding competitions.</TE>

<HD>Agassi Has It All Under Control</HD>
<DH>Tennis: He continues mastery of fellow Americans and
doesn't give Gambill any room for error in 6-2, 6-4 victory for L.A.
title.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Instead of Raggedy Andy, the victim was someone named after a
heartthrob, grade-B movie actor. But the result was just the same, as
Andre Agassi played the puppeteer, jerking Jan-Michael Gambill from
side to side, up and back, with power and guile.</LD>
<LD>   Quite simply, the kids aren't all right against Agassi. The
32-year-old rarely loses to an American not named Pete Sampras,
refusing to give an inch, whether it's a practice session, a final or
a routine first-round match.</LD>
<LD>   Gambill, named after Jan-Michael Vincent, won six games against
Agassi in the final of the Mercedes-Benz Cup at UCLA on Sunday, and
many of those seemed to take a supreme effort from the 25-year-old,
which slowly took its toll in the hot sun. Agassi broke his serve
four times, overcame a brief surge in the second set and defeated
Gambill, 6-2, 6-4, in 76 minutes before a crowd of 7,043. (Total
attendance was 83,917, down from last year's record 87,161.)</LD>
<TE>   It is Agassi's fourth title of 2002 and the 53rd of his career.
His wife Steffi Graf was on hand, along with trainer and close friend
Gil Reyes and coach Darren Cahill, who has been with Agassi since the
San Jose tournament in February.</TE>
<TE>   Agassi had played his previous four matches in this tournament at
night but had little trouble adjusting to the early afternoon sun.
Gambill had fits with his service toss and managed to hold serve only
once from the north end, which faced the sun.</TE>
<TE>   Outdoors or indoors. Day or night. There's plenty of company among
those who have had misery inflicted by Agassi under a variety of
conditions. Andy Roddick, who was upset by Gambill in Saturday's
semifinals, won only five games off Agassi in the semifinals at San
Jose in February and was also run ragged.</TE>
<TE>   Gambill has been a longstanding member of the club. In his last
five matches against Agassi, Gambill has not won a set. A flicker of
hope was erased in ruthless fashion in the second set. Gambill broke
Agassi for the first time in the match, making it, 4-4. In the next
game, Gambill was broken at 15, getting only one first serve in play.</TE>
<TE>   "Andre was too tough," Gambill said. "He ran me from side to side
to side to side. I felt like a rag doll out there."</TE>
<TE>   Name an American--young, old or legendary--and Agassi has probably
defeated him in the last three years. The list includes Todd Martin,
James Blake, Paul Goldstein, Taylor Dent, Alex Kim and, of course,
Sampras in last year's L.A. final. This was Agassi's third title at
UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   The last American besides Sampras to defeat Agassi in a completed
match was Vince Spadea at the 1999 Australian Open in the fourth
round. One of Gambill's two victories in his 10 matches against
Agassi came three years ago at Scottsdale, Ariz., but Agassi retired
in the first set because of an injury.</TE>
<TE>   In the previous tournament in 1999, Cecil Mamiit recorded a
victory against Agassi at San Jose. Agassi, though, was defaulted in
the second-set tiebreaker because of repeated code violations.</TE>
<TE>   Years ago, he realized it was going to take an extraordinary
physical effort to bring himself back from No. 141 in the world and
to stay at the top. And now that he has won four titles a year in
four of the last five years, he is willing to make the sacrifice to
keep going.</TE>
<TE>   "Agassi's awareness is not restricted to himself. He hit with
Gambill at UCLA early last week and got a scouting report. It didn't
take Agassi long to detect a slight difference in Gambill's game.</TE>
<TE>   "He noticed my toss was higher," Gambill said.</TE>
<TE>   These observations are part of a larger piece, of what makes
Agassi's return game so overwhelming.</TE>
<TE>   "I still don't think Lleyton Hewitt is as good" as Agassi on his
best day, said Gambill, comparing the return games of both players.</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt, the defending U.S. Open champion, is considered the
leading favorite to repeat in New York. But anyone, especially
Agassi, who wins a hard-court tournament this time of the year has to
be taken seriously.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a lot less questions than a week ago," he said about his
U.S. Open preparation.</TE>
<TE>   His success in L.A. probably helped make his decision to miss the
Tennis Masters Series event in Toronto a lot easier. Although Agassi
showed no apparent sign of injury Sunday, he cited a lower back and
hip injury as the reason for his withdrawal.</TE>
<TE>   One he could not answer was whether he will return to this
tournament next year. The ATP schedule has put the L.A. event
head-to-head against the tournament in Washington in 2003. As fond as
Agassi is of Los Angeles, he has won Washington five times.</TE>
<TE>   Washington is run by SFX Sports Group, the management company of
Roddick and Gambill. While the players aren't contracted to play the
event, it is more than logical to assume that would happen with
Roddick and Gambill.</TE>

<LD>There's more to Venus Williams than pure power.</LD>
<LD>   With savvy shotmaking--and, of course, her booming serve--Williams
defeated Belgian Kim Clijsters, 6-3, 6-3, Sunday to win the Bank of
the West Classic title at Stanford.</LD>
<LD>   The top-seeded Williams won her fifth title this year to maintain
her No. 2 ranking behind sister Serena, the Wimbledon champion.</LD>
<TE>   "To be honest, I think she played very well too," Williams said.
"She brought out the best in me."</TE>
<TE>   Williams kept her 19-year-old opponent on the run throughout the
match with precise shots, compensating for an uncharacteristic 10
double-faults.</TE>
<TE>   "The sun was definitely a factor," she said. "I had to start
moving my toss around a bit."</TE>
<TE>   Williams' serve didn't totally leave her. She was still clocked at
119 mph at one point.</TE>

<HD>A Fourth Is With Him</HD>
<DH>Cycling: Armstrong rides into upper echelon with his fourth
consecutive Tour de France title, the first American to accomplish
the feat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Having confronted his own mortality five years ago, when his body was
invaded by testicular cancer that spread to his lungs and brain,
cyclist Lance Armstrong now finds himself contemplating athletic
immortality.</LD>
<LD>   Armstrong on Sunday won the Tour de France for the fourth
consecutive year, continuing his domination of the three-week test of
stamina, wits and nerves. Although the 2,036-mile course was
reconfigured to save the mountain stages for later than usual on the
theory he might be too depleted to make his characteristically strong
climbs, he was never seriously challenged in the 20-stage race.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a difficult race, three weeks," he said. "It's difficult
mentally. It's good to finish."</LD>
<TE>   The 30-year-old Texan, riding for the U.S. Postal Service team,
won in 82 hours 5 minutes 12 seconds, 7 minutes 17 seconds ahead of
runner-up Joseba Beloki of Spain. Armstrong's average speed, 24.8
mph, was the fourth-fastest in history--and he owns two of the other
top times.</TE>
<TE>   Raimondas Rumsas of Lithuania was third, 8:17 behind Armstrong. No
other rider was within 13 minutes. The only other U.S. rider in the
top 10 was Levi Leipheimer of Santa Rosa, who rode for the Dutch
Rabobank team and finished a surprising eighth, 17:11 out of the
lead. There was never much doubt who the leader would be, even though
Armstrong finished second to Colombia's Santiago Botero in a time
trial in the ninth stage and the ever-critical French press began to
suggest he was cracking.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong silenced his critics by winning consecutive stages in
the Pyrenees, taking the lead in the 11th stage at La Mongie and
forging further ahead at the Plateau de Beille. He added to his lead
by winning a time trial in the 19th stage.</TE>
<TE>   "I love this race. I love what I do," he said. "I love being with
the team, being with eight great guys."</TE>
<TE>   Wearing the maillot jaune--yellow jersey--of the Tour leader,
Armstrong sipped champagne as he and his U.S. Postal Service
teammates began the final stage, from Melun to Paris, at the
traditional leisurely pace. The tempo picked up as the pack of
riders, known as the peleton, came within view of the Eiffel Tower
and reached the Arc de Triomphe.</TE>
<TE>   While rivals scrambled for personal goals, such as Robbie McEwen
of Australia bursting away to end German Erik Zabel's six-year hold
on the best sprinter title, Armstrong cruised home, accompanied by
the cheers of spectators who jammed sidewalks along the
Champs-Elysees waving U.S. and Texas flags.</TE>
<TE>   When he crossed the finish line, this football-loving,
Tex-Mex-eating son of the Lone Star State became the first American
to win the 99-year-old race more than three times, a feat that had
previously been done by compatriot Greg LeMond. Silhouetted against
the majestic Arc de Triomphe, holding a bouquet of yellow flowers
that matched his jersey, Armstrong held his cap over his heart during
"The Star-Spangled Banner" and savored his victory.</TE>
<TE>   "They're all different, unique, emotional and great in many ways,"
he said of his Tour triumphs.</TE>
<TE>   Before his name was inscribed in the Tour record books after those
of five-time winners Miguel Indurain of Spain, Bernard Hinault of
France, Eddy Merckx of Belgium and Jacques Anquetil of France, he was
thinking about next year's race--and setting the record in 2004. To
do that, he said, he would need a solid and cohesive team. This
year's squad, "was one of the strongest in the history of cycling,"
he said. "I hope to ride with them for two more years."</TE>
<TE>   Two months before his 31st birthday, with a wife, three children
and an estimated $10-million annual endorsement income, Armstrong
remains as driven as he was a decade ago. Matching Indurain's record
of five consecutive wins and standing alone with six wins are feats
well within his reach, say those who know him well.</TE>
<TE>   These are friends who saw him finish last in a field of 111 in his
first professional race and almost quit before he accepted their
advice about tactics, teamwork and near-fanatical preparation.</TE>
<TE>   They're the friends who shared his despair when he lost his health
insurance and his biggest sponsor, and when other companies shied
away from someone who seemed unlikely to survive, much less ride
again. They saw him lose his hair, eyebrows and muscles to the
ravages of chemotherapy, but never lost faith in him.</TE>
<TE>   They know the depth of his determination and force of his spirit,
and they know better than to bet against him.</TE>
<TE>   "There are crashes, illnesses, all kinds of variables. But looking
at Lance and where he is in life, I think Lance can do it," said Jim
Ochowicz, a former rider and team leader, the surrogate father who
brought apple fritters to Armstrong's hospital room when chemo left
him too sore to swallow anything else.</TE>
<TE>   "He's definitely in the top 10 historically now. As he continues
to find success, you certainly have to move him up the ladder. Others
have won four tours. However, they didn't win those Tours
post-cancer, which changes the dynamics of what he's done. It's
awfully hard to do a comparison when you bring that into the
equation.</TE>
<TE>   "No other great athlete has done what he's done. I know of other
sportsmen who were not at the level Lance was at who came back from
cancer, but none who was at his level."</TE>
<TE>   Sean Petty, vice president of marketing for USA Cycling and
formerly its athlete performance director, believes Armstrong will be
affected less by age and weariness than will his rivals. Because he
focuses so intently on the Tour de France to the exclusion of other
races--"basically this is what I devote my life to," Armstrong
said--Petty said Armstrong should extend his prime beyond the early
30s.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong, who has a home in Spain and ranch land near Austin,
competes in about six races a year and skips the one-day classics he
rode earlier in his career. His U.S. Postal Service teammate George
Hincapie, by contrast, will probably compete in a dozen races between
late winter and early fall. Because there are few elite races in the
U.S., Armstrong rarely competes in his homeland. However, he's
scheduled to race in the New York City Cycling Championships next
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "Traditionally, 31 has been old," Petty said. "If you look at
Bernard Hinault, who won five Tours, he retired when he was 32. But
Hinault was really riding hard all season in some major events. Not
that Lance isn't riding hard. But he doesn't ride in as many races as
some people did or do.</TE>
<TE>   "The big thing, I think, is that Lance can take his mental and
physical preparation to new levels. As long as Lance is mentally
challenged and hungry, I think he'll do the Tour de France, and
that's the key. He has to feel there's some kind of challenge."</TE>
<TE>   That he found a challenge this year is clear to Mike Plant, an
Olympic speedskater turned cyclist who became president of USA
Cycling and is on the board of directors of the Union Cycliste
Internationale, the sport's governing body.</TE>
<TE>   "I can just see how Lance is riding. He's in an element of his
own," said Plant, an executive vice president of Turner Sports in
Atlanta. "When he's ready to go, he knows when that is and no one is
going to go with him. You can't predict these things, but if he can
hold this kind of form, he should have no problem winning five or
six, and certainly five or six in a row.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to take into consideration he's a very talented and
gifted athlete. He knows how to win when he has to. I've known only
two athletes like that: Lance and [Olympic speedskating quintuple
gold medalist] Eric Heiden. There aren't too many people who know how
to dig that deep. They do."</TE>
<TE>   Said Ochowicz, who flew to Paris for the finish: "Psychologically
he's prepared to go forward and win five or six Tours de France. It's
demanding, no question. It requires a lot of support from close
friends and family, a good sponsor, a good team and good teammates.
You don't win the Tour de France by yourself. You can't race 23 days
and win by yourself. You must have help from your teammates. The
Chicago Bulls didn't win without Michael Jordan. It's the same with
Lance. He's the winner on the team, but they operate as a team, and
he always acknowledges that."</TE>
<TE>   Blessed with a metabolism that lets him take in and use oxygen
more efficiently than most people and produces little lactic
acid--the chemical generated when the body tires--Armstrong was a
swimmer and triathlete as a teenager. He was a good cyclist before
his illness, maybe very good. In 1993, at 21, he persuaded Ochowicz
to let him ride in the Tour de France and he became the youngest
rider to win a Tour stage, finishing first in the 114-mile leg from
Chalons-sur-Marne to Verdun. He didn't finish the Tour, but he did
win the world championship.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, his riding was more a calculated obsession than a passion.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't love the bike before I got sick," he said in his
autobiography, "It's Not About the Bike," a searing account of his
life, illness and recovery. "It was simple for me: It was my job and
I was successful at it. It was a means to an end, a way to get out of
Plano, a potential source of wealth and recognition. But it was not
something I did for pleasure or poetry."</TE>
<TE>   That changed when he became ill. He was diagnosed with cancer on
Oct. 2, 1996, and within a week underwent surgery to remove two
lesions from his brain and began rigorous chemotherapy. He thought
his career was over, that he might go to school or simply play golf.
Only while talking to the nurse who managed his chemo treatments did
he realize he missed riding.</TE>
<TE>   "She asked me about cycling and I found myself telling her about
the bike with a sense of pleasure I hadn't realized I possessed," he
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   That epiphany pushed him back onto his bike. He began with trips
around his Austin neighborhood, outings that exhausted and humbled
him when recreational riders zoomed past him on mountain bikes. But
he forced himself to persevere.</TE>
<TE>   "To race and suffer, that's hard. But it's not being laid out in a
hospital bed with a catheter hanging out of your chest, plutonium
burning in your veins, throwing up for 24 hours straight, five days a
week," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth is, if you asked me to choose between winning the Tour
de France and cancer, I would choose cancer. Odd as it sounds, I
would rather have the title of cancer survivor than winner of the
Tour, because of what it has done for me as a human being, a man, a
husband, a son, and a father."</TE>
<TE>   He described himself as "leaner in body and more balanced in
spirit" after his cancer battle. Petty agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, there's a physical difference. He came out a different
person," Petty said of his slimmer, less muscular post-cancer
physique. "There was a huge difference, making him more of a Tour
rider than a one-day rider.</TE>
<TE>   "Mentally, coming as close to death as possible, it had to affect
him. I don't want to say it has softened him, but that cocky
confidence he had is not as visible. And I think that's not just the
cancer. It's also having a family and kids. Everything has rounded
him out."</TE>
<TE>   Rounded, but not dulled.</TE>
<TE>   Despite persistent rumors he has taken performance-enhancing drugs
and even had doctors add them to his chemotherapy medication, he
adamantly denies being a doper. He has never tested positive, and the
French government recently said its nearly two-year investigation
into allegations against his team has found no evidence of cheating.
However, Armstrong told Cyclingnews that French tax authorities are
claiming he's liable for taxes on his 1999 Tour de France prize
money. The money traditionally goes to the team, which doles out
shares to riders, mechanics and others. This year's prize is about
$438,000.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of it's sour grapes. There's a witch hunt going on," Plant
said. "Maybe it's because a French rider hasn't won since 1985. It's
unfortunate. The facts are the guy gets tested probably more than
anybody, and he always comes up clean."</TE>
<TE>   But someday, those annoyances might become too much. When that
happens, Petty can see him devoting more time to the Lance Armstrong
Foundation, which funds cancer research. "I know for a fact it's not
just his name," Petty said. "He knows all the research that's being
done and where the grants are going."</TE>
<TE>   He's also feeling bound by family ties. He and his wife, Kristin
have a 2 1/2-year-old son, Luke, and 8-month-old twins Isabelle and
Grace, born through in-vitro fertilization using sperm he banked
before his chemo treatments. His children greeted him at the finish
line Sunday, the twins wearing sun bonnets against the summer heat.</TE>
<TE>   "It's harder and harder to be away from home with a wife and three
children," he said. "My girls started crawling while I was away at
the Tour de France. But it's not my last Tour de France."</TE>
<TE>   Nor is it likely to be his last victory.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the day, I don't need to race anymore. I've done a
hell of a lot more than I ever thought I'd do," he told Cyclingnews
in March. "Done better in terms of results, financially, traveling,
experienced, introductions ... you name it, it's been a hundredfold
[more]. So if I didn't love it, I would have been gone by now. But I
still just, I really dig it....</TE>
<TE>   "I still have a ton of passion for bike racing, and it's 12 months
a year. I mean, there's months that I don't do much, but man, I go
three or four days without riding my bike, I get really cranky. I
like riding my bike. I crave it."</TE>

<HD>Emotional Return for Morariu</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Perhaps it's fitting that the Silver Lining Foundation, run by former
professional player Andrea Jaeger, has its main fund-raising dinner
during the Acura Classic on Thursday at the La Costa Resort &amp; Spa in
Carlsbad. A figure of hope and inspiration will be returning to the
WTA Tour for the first time in nearly 15 months.</LD>
<LD>   Corina Morariu, 24, abruptly returned home to Boca Raton, Fla.,
from Europe in May 2001 when she started suffering from nosebleeds
and bruising. She entered the hospital and was diagnosed with a form
of leukemia called acute promyelocytic leukemia.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a gradual struggle," said Morariu. "It's still a little bit
of a struggle. I don't think about it every day, but I have to get
checked once a month and I have to take oral chemotherapy once every
day. So there's still a possibility that it can come back, and that's
always a thought that crosses your mind."</LD>
<TE>   Her closest friends were amazed when she told them of her plans to
return to the circuit so quickly. Morariu and her doubles partner
Kimberly Po-Messerli were given a wild-card spot by tournament
organizers and will play Chanda Rubin-Meghann Shaughnessy today in
the first round.</TE>
<TE>   "When she called me and told me she was coming back, I was so
surprised, I said, 'Are you sure? Is it going to be OK?' " said
Lindsay Davenport, a close friend and former doubles partner of
Morariu. "But Corina said she's fine, she's ready to go. And it'll be
really neat to see her out there again."</TE>
<TE>   The return of Morariu promises to be an emotional highlight of
what is traditionally one of the more prestigious Tier II events on
the tour. Two-time defending champion Venus Williams is in the upper
half of the draw with No. 3 Davenport, No. 5 Kim Clijsters of Belgium
and No. 7 Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia.</TE>
<TE>   In the lower half are No. 2 Jennifer Capriati, No. 4 Monica Seles,
No. 6 Jelena Dokic of Yugoslavia and No. 8 Elena Dementieva of
Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, who beat Clijsters in the final at Stanford on Sunday,
defeated Seles last year to win at La Costa. She also won in 2000 and
lost in the final in 1999. Her younger sister, Serena, the French
Open and Wimbledon champion, is not playing at La Costa, and is
scheduled to next appear at Manhattan Beach, the week after La Costa.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Robin Ventura made history, and Andy Pettitte gave the New York
Yankee pitching staff a lift.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura hit the 16th grand slam of his career and Pettitte gave up
one run in 7 1/3 innings as the Yankees defeated the Tampa Bay Devil
Rays, 9-1, Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura tied Babe Ruth, Hank Aaron and Dave Kingman for sixth
place on the all-time list. The active leader trails only Lou Gehrig
(23), Eddie Murray (19), Willie McCovey (18), Jimmie Foxx (17) and
Ted Williams (17).</LD>
<TE>   "I don't care what category it is ... it's an honor to be in
anything when you mention his name," said Ventura of tying Ruth, who
led the Yankees to seven World Series appearances and hit 714 home
runs overall.</TE>
<TE>   Pettitte (5-4) tied his career-high with 12 strikeouts, equaling
his total against Boston on Sept. 16, 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been throwing good lately," said Pettitte, who has won three
of his last four starts. "I didn't realize I had reached so many
strikeouts. I was just able to locate better, but I've been throwing
really strong."</TE>
<TE>   It was his seventh double-digit strikeout performance, and first
since May 10, 2001, against Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel it's coming around for him," Yankee pitching coach Mel
Stottlemyre said of Pettitte, who missed almost two months earlier
this season with left elbow tendinitis. "I think we needed this
staff-wise. The hitters have been carrying us through some of the
games."</TE>
<TE>   New York had given up 32 runs over the last four games, including
16 in two with Tampa Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Pettitte, who gave up four hits and walked three, is 9-1 in his
career against Tampa Bay. The left-hander gave up two hits in six
innings in the Yankees' 4-0 home opener victory over the Devil Rays
on April 5.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura put the Yankees ahead 4-0 with two out in the third inning
when he lined a 3-1 pitch from Tanyon Sturtze (1-11) into the
right-field stands for his 22nd homer. He homered in all three games
of the weekend series against the Devil Rays after going 26 games
without one.</TE>
<TE>   In his career with the bases loaded, Ventura is hitting .358 (58
for 162) with 193 runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   "I've just been fortunate to be on teams and in situations where
I've been sandwiched between good hitters," Ventura said. "That means
you get more opportunities."</TE>

<HD>MTA Valley Chief Has a Tough Road Ahead</HD>
<DH>Transit: David Armijo faces a challenge to modernize a bus
fleet, revamp service and prevent a breakaway.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When David Armijo toured two buses recently, one made him marvel, the
other made him cringe.</LD>
<LD>   Stepping into a gleaming, plush Simi Valley Transit coach, the new
chief of the MTA's San Fernando Valley sector saw that the
natural-gas-powered vehicle was equipped with the latest
technology--a debit-card fare machine for riders, a digital radio for
drivers and a global positioning system to help the nine-bus network
run more efficiently.</LD>
<LD>   Later, at the same Chatsworth stop, Armijo boarded a second bus--a
battered diesel vehicle with threadbare seats, scratched windows, a
graffiti-splashed rear wall and an ancient analog Motorola radio.
Unlike the Simi Valley coach, this bus is part of the 440-vehicle
fleet that Armijo supervises.</LD>
<TE>   "We're bigger, but we're not necessarily better," Armijo said.
"We're working at it."</TE>
<TE>   Although the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has begun
buying newer coaches, Armijo said it could take three years to
replace this particular bus. Modernizing the fleet is just one of the
challenges facing Armijo as the MTA decentralizes into five smaller
operating units--including the 1,300-employee Valley sector--in an
effort to better serve bus riders.</TE>
<TE>   As the Valley sector chief, Armijo controls a $110-million budget
and has the authority to hire and fire staff members and to modify
bus schedules and routes. He can add or delete routes if he holds a
public hearing and obtains approval from the MTA board.</TE>
<TE>   Part of his $168,000 annual salary is tied to how much he improves
on-time performance and reduces complaints from customers.</TE>
<TE>   Rider advocates say bus routes and schedules in the Valley are in
serious need of an overhaul.</TE>
<TE>   In the last four years, Valley bus passenger boardings--the
measure of how much buses are used--grew by 66%, from 41.1 million in
1998 to 68.4 million in the fiscal year that ended in June, according
to MTA estimates. The increase is in part the result of the 2000
opening of the Metro Red Line subway in the Valley and the creation
of a rapid bus line on Ventura Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   But the local bus lines, in the meantime, have languished.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley sector serves a politically charged region where, until
recently, a group of local officials and community leaders agitated
to break off from the MTA to form a separate transit zone.</TE>
<TE>   Arguing that the MTA was too big, inefficient and out of touch
with the needs of the Valley, zone proponents favored an independent,
locally controlled bus district to provide better service.</TE>
<TE>   Late last year, top MTA executives countered with a sector plan
that promised the same results through decentralization. Sectors for
the San Fernando and San Gabriel valleys began operations this month,
while others in the South Bay, Westside/Central and Gateway Cities
regions are scheduled to start in September.</TE>
<TE>   Armijo was the first sector general manager to be recruited.</TE>
<TE>   "All the eyes are on him. He's the lead in this experiment," said
Bart Reed, executive director of the Transit Coalition, a
Sylmar-based nonprofit advocacy group. "If he stumbles or fails, this
won't bode well for the MTA."</TE>
<TE>   For now, zone proponents say they are waiting to see how well the
Valley sector works. If it doesn't lead to better service and more
response to local needs, they threaten to file papers for an
immediate divorce from the MTA.</TE>
<TE>   "That's Armijo's challenge--make the zone application go away,"
said Kymberleigh Richards, spokeswoman for Southern California
Transit Advocates, an organization of riders.</TE>
<TE>   Those who know Armijo believe he's up to the task.</TE>
<TE>   John Catoe, MTA deputy chief executive, is so impressed with
Armijo that he likes to joke he hired Armijo twice. The first time
was in 1995, when Catoe recommended Armijo to become director of
operations for Orange County Transportation Authority. Then, a few
months ago, Catoe plucked Armijo out of Orange County for the Valley
position.</TE>
<TE>   "He's politically smart," Catoe said of Armijo, a 43-year-old
transit veteran, who also has worked in Texas and New Mexico. "I felt
he fit perfectly in the Valley."</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, Armijo supervised the restructuring of bus
routes, cutting duplicate service and expansion of other lines. Some
changes, which required riders to make more transfers, were strongly
criticized at first. But a recent survey by the Orange County transit
agency showed that its riders are happier now with their bus system
than they were before the restructuring. Ridership grew more last
year in the county than in any other major metropolitan area in the
country.</TE>
<TE>   Armijo also introduced shorter, 25-passenger buses to the Orange
County fleet--something he said he hopes to repeat in the Valley. The
smaller buses could serve some Valley neighborhoods that need bus
service but don't have enough passengers to justify new lines with
standard 40- or 43-passenger coaches, he said.</TE>
<TE>   His other plans include having some buses skip stops so they can
go faster, and improving rail-to-bus connections.</TE>
<TE>   Armijo is planning the changes with his schedulers, meeting with
community groups and seeking ideas from riders and drivers.</TE>
<TE>   "That's good. He gets to see what we see. We are the eyes and ears
out there," said Darryl Richardson, as he steered his diesel coach
down Topanga Canyon Boulevard just after telling Armijo about the
need for newer buses that run on clean fuels.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson, a driver for 20 years, said MTA management never paid
much attention to what drivers had to say, but changes seem to be in
the air.</TE>
<TE>   "It's getting better now, in terms of communications, between us
and management," he said.</TE>

<HD>Fired Officer Is Rehired</HD>
<DH>South Gate: He was dismissed after tipping off drug
suspects. Acting chief defends decision.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>South Gate's new acting police chief has rehired an officer who, an
appeals court found, tipped off two suspected drug dealers targeted
in a federal investigation.</LD>
<LD>   The officer, Taron Valentin, was fired by a previous police chief
in 1996 after informing the suspects that their phones might have
been bugged, according to the court. He also illegally gave one of
the men a firearm, the court found.</LD>
<LD>   Valentin, appointed two weeks ago by acting Police Chief Rick
Lopez, now works patrol in this working-class city 12 miles southeast
of downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   For South Gate, a city awash in investigations of political
corruption, the hiring has generated another round of controversy and
increased tensions between the two police unions and the city's new
chief. The unions also have been at odds with three members who make
up the majority of the five-member City Council and have worked to
recall all three. Lopez defended the hiring of Valentin--one of his
first major moves as chief--saying he had acted on a directive from
the City Council majority and acting City Manager Jesus Marez. He
noted that Valentin had never been criminally charged.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is that the man is qualified to be a police
officer," said Lopez, who took over the 98-member force four weeks
ago.</TE>
<TE>   But others, including fellow officers, see Valentin's hiring as a
disturbing sign that Lopez is willing to jeopardize public safety in
bowing to pressure from City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Since taking over, Lopez has disbanded the narcotics squad and
demoted or reassigned several police union officials who have
criticized the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   The Valentin hiring follows a series of controversial moves
authorized by the City Council, including the appointment of a
convicted embezzler to be the trial specialist.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a pattern of hiring under-qualified people, or people with
dirty backgrounds," said Councilman Hector De La Torre, who opposed
Valentin's reinstatement. "It's scary."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI opened a South Gate investigation last year, subpoenaing
Valentin's employment records. The nature and status of the probe is
unclear, however. The FBI declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The facts of Valentin's dismissal were detailed in March 2000 in a
14-page decision by a three-justice panel of the 2nd Appellate
District in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Valentin was a nine-year veteran working patrol in 1996 when he
learned that the Drug Enforcement Administration suspected that two
of his friends were involved in a drug-dealing operation.</TE>
<TE>   Despite being told by superior officers not to tell the suspects,
Valentin did so, informing them of the possible telephone-bugging and
mentioning the DEA, wrote Justice Miriam A. Vogel.</TE>
<TE>   The suspects were never charged, according to law enforcement
sources.</TE>
<TE>   After an internal investigation, Valentin was fired by then-Police
Chief Ron George.</TE>
<TE>   He was ordered reinstated by a civil service commission, which
recommended that he be allowed to return to work after a one-year
suspension. Valentin also sued the city, arguing that, as an African
American, he had been the victim of racial discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   But Valentin's firing was later upheld by the City Council and the
appeals court, which had the final word on the matter.</TE>
<TE>   The justices threw out Valentin's wrongful-termination lawsuit,
saying there was insufficient evidence of discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   Valentin "compromised an ongoing police investigation and, as he
later admitted, may have placed the investigating officers at risk,"
the ruling said. "By Valentin's own admissions, he gave the chief of
police and the police department good cause for his termination."</TE>
<TE>   The appeals court also reversed a lower court order that Valentin
be reinstated because the city had not observed a technicality in its
termination procedure. The appeals court said it wasn't necessary to
"order the members of the City Council to jump through more hoops in
order to finalize a foregone conclusion."</TE>
<TE>   It is not clear why authorities did not pursue criminal charges.
Valentin could not be reached for comment, but his attorney, Corey W.
Glave, said prosecutors had concluded there was insufficient
evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Glave disputed many of the court's findings, saying they had been
based on a flawed internal investigation by South Gate police. He
said Valentin had been a longtime friend of the drug suspects but had
never informed them of an investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Valentin, Glave said, had given one of the men a handgun as a down
payment for a home improvement project. But he said Valentin hadn't
known that the man was a suspect, or that it was illegal to transfer
a handgun without filling out the proper paperwork.</TE>
<TE>   Valentin's quest to regain his job met with failure until a new
City Council majority gained power in 2000. A few months later, in
2001, council members Xochilt Ruvalcaba, Raul Moriel and Maria
Benavides voted to place Valentin back on the city payroll.
Ruvalcaba, who is also mayor, said a "hidden agenda" had been behind
Valentin's termination, citing racism allegations that were dismissed
by the appeals court.</TE>
<TE>   Ruvalcaba said she didn't remember whether she had read the
decision, but was convinced that Valentin's termination had been
unjust.</TE>
<TE>   "After reviewing the information presented to us, it just didn't
seem to pass the smell test," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Valentin did not immediately join the force, however. According to
Steve Rader, a labor attorney for the city, Valentin had to undergo a
recertification process, which included background checks and
retraining.</TE>
<TE>   The city's decision to rehire Valentin has raised suspicions that
Valentin has close ties to Treasurer Albert Robles, who has been
widely perceived as the city's political boss. Critics say Robles
rewarded Valentin for his help in political campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   They say Valentin, Lopez and other officials whose backgrounds
have come under criticism are indebted to Robles because they could
not have been hired elsewhere. Some say Lopez is not qualified to be
chief.</TE>
<TE>   They "owe their jobs and well-being to Robles," said De La Torre,
the councilman. "They know nobody else would have them ... and that
gives Robles a whole lot of power over them."</TE>
<TE>   Robles said he has no influence over the Police Department, and
denied playing a role in Valentin's hiring. The accusations, he said,
are politically motivated attacks, meant to discredit him.</TE>
<TE>   "He never worked on my campaign or volunteered," he said of
Valentin, adding that political enemies are just trying "to drag my
name into every decision that's made."</TE>
<TE>   Robles faces charges of threatening to kill two state legislators
and South Gate Police Lt. Vince Avila. Avila led the internal
investigation into Valentin. Beyond the political bickering, law
enforcement experts and criminal defense attorneys said Valentin's
past could become an issue when he is called as a witness in future
cases.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to have credibility problems going on," said Public
Defender Ramiro Jacinto, part of the public integrity assurance unit
of the public defender's office. "If I had a case where that guy was
a principal witness, that's what I'd look at."</TE>

<HD>Heat-Related Deaths Spur Call to Lower Power Rates</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DIRMANN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PALM SPRINGS</DL>
<LD>First there was the death of 83-year-old Muree Foy. Three days later,
David White, 47, who was asthmatic, was found dead in his home. A day
after that, the Neill sisters were found, one dead, the other barely
conscious.</LD>
<LD>   The cause of all three deaths earlier this month was intense heat,
authorities have found. Sweltering temperatures in the victims' Palm
Springs homes overtook them. All might have been saved if they had
turned on air conditioners or gotten them repaired.</LD>
<LD>   "We've had quite a few of these deaths this year," said Palm
Springs Police Sgt. Ron Starrs. "It's unusual to have so many. But
there are always people who just didn't turn on their
air-conditioning when they needed to."</LD>
<TE>   The deaths have spurred concern from state Sen. Jim Battin (R-La
Quinta), who has long argued that electric companies should do more
to provide affordable service to people living in the hottest regions
of the state, where power bills routinely skyrocket during the summer
months.</TE>
<TE>   Expensive electricity in desert towns amounts to nothing less than
a health hazard, Battin said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's common sense; it's a no-brainer," he said. "People are
literally dying because they are so afraid to get [an electric] bill
they can't afford." And yet the power companies "go out of their way
to find reasons" not to provide more affordable rates.</TE>
<TE>   On July 11, officers found Foy dead. A thermometer in the house
registered 90 degrees, but officers said it felt much hotter. Foy had
recently told friends that her air conditioner was broken and that
she could not afford to get it fixed, police said.</TE>
<TE>   On July 14, authorities were called to the home of White, whose
father had discovered his son's body in a chair in his bedroom. A
thermometer hanging from the ceiling of the home read 109 degrees,
according to police.</TE>
<TE>   The father later told police that White, who was blind as well as
asthmatic, was supposed to be napping after his noon meal.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, July 15, neighbors called police to the home of two
sisters after noticing newspapers piling up on their doorstep. Police
entered the home just before 8 p.m. and found the temperature inside
hovering around 110 degrees. The air conditioner was not on.</TE>
<TE>   Police found 76-year-old Virginia Neill semi-conscious. She was
rushed to a hospital and survived.</TE>
<TE>   But her sister, Maggie Neill, 77, didn't make it. She was found
dead in her bed, sitting up against the headboard. Authorities said
they found an electricity bill for about $25 in the Neills' home.</TE>
<TE>   That is "clearly indicative of someone who is just not using their
air conditioner," said Starrs, pointing out that neighbors report
their own summertime electricity bills typically exceeding $100 a
month.</TE>
<TE>   Battin said such tragedies happen every year in the desert,
particularly among elderly residents living on fixed incomes.</TE>
<TE>   "They can't afford the high rates," said Kim Glassman, Battin's
chief of staff. "So instead, they suffer with no air conditioning,
and we pay for it with heat-related deaths."</TE>
<TE>   Southern California Edison officials say they provide options for
people, particularly those on limited incomes, in the heat of summer.</TE>
<TE>   Residents living below the poverty line of about $22,600 a year
for a two-person household are entitled to a 20% break on electricity
rates, said Lynda Ziegler, director of customer programs and
services.</TE>
<TE>   Edison also accepts customer donations, distributed through the
United Way, that help cover the bills of those in danger of having
their electricity shut off.</TE>
<TE>   During last year's rolling blackouts, the utility set up cooling
stations at various public places.</TE>
<TE>   Edison also sends out brochures with information on heat
exhaustion and tips such as escaping to a cool mall or movie theater,
if possible. Battin says those efforts are not enough.</TE>
<TE>   "I got news for the" Public Utilities Commission, Battin said.
"People who live in the desert know about heat. Warning them to stay
out of the sun just isn't going to do anything."</TE>
<TE>   Cindra Rowell, Riverside County deputy director of public health,
said it is unusual to have so many heat-related deaths within the
space of a few days.</TE>
<TE>   Rowell said people susceptible to heat exhaustion and heatstroke
can begin to experience symptoms any time temperatures reach 100
degrees. General symptoms, she said, include weakness, dizziness,
nausea and clammy skin. In more serious cases, the skin will feel hot
and dry. The victim may get the chills and experience confusion.</TE>
<TE>   "In serious cases, the person needs to get to a hospital to get
... some fluids, or else they can go into shock and die," Rowell
said.</TE>
<TE>   Battin took on the electricity companies last year with a measure
forcing utilities to exclude the hottest regions from rolling
blackouts. The situation was more critical then, he said, when
California was grappling with an energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The bill was signed into law last August but, so far, the
utilities have not implemented plans for following the order, he
said.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Insurers Tapping a Market for Cross-Border Health
Coverage</HD>
<DH>Trend: Many Southland Latinos seek care in Tijuana, with
its ease of language, faster service and cheaper medicines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TIJUANA, Mexico</DL>
<LD>When the buses, unlicensed taxis and cars packed with families stream
south across the border toward a profusion of clinics and pharmacies,
doctors here know it must be "Holy Saturday."</LD>
<LD>   That's what they call their busiest day of the week, when
thousands of Latinos from across Southern California make a
pilgrimage to Baja California for health care. They could get similar
treatment and medications closer to home, but not, they say, with the
same south-of-the-border cultural empathy, speed--and low cost.</LD>
<LD>   Now, some U.S. insurers are tapping into this market of mostly
cash-paying consumers to offer lower-cost "cross-border" policies.
Between them, California-based insurers like Blue Shield and Health
Net cover an estimated 25,000 people who get some or all of their
care in Mexico.</LD>
<TE>   California officials hope the low cost of this coverage will make
a dent in the state's population of uninsured, estimated at 4 million
to 6 million people. Many of these are low-paid Latino service
workers whose employers don't offer health plans. Cross-border plans
might entice some workers who have no insurance now.</TE>
<TE>   Some doctors, however, fear that people will be forced by
employers and the lower cost to get treatment hundreds of miles from
home--and that the care is both inferior and poorly regulated.</TE>
<TE>   Patients who choose a cross-border plan "are taking a risk not
having the access to the kind of technology that we consider minimal
in the United States," said Santa Monica gastroenterologist Richard
Corlin, past president of the American Medical Assn. "You may be
relying on the hunch of a doctor."</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't worry San Diego hotel worker Raul Jimenez, who went
to Sistemas Nacionales de Salud, just steps from the U.S. border, to
get an explanation for dizzy spells. He jumped at the chance to buy a
cross-border plan when it was offered by his employer through Health
Net.</TE>
<TE>   "When we had the choice between insurance in the U.S. or insurance
in Mexico, we picked Mexico," Jimenez said. "For us, it was cheaper
and the doctors seem to understand us better."</TE>
<TE>   Plans offered by the cross-border insurers, who team up with
Mexican doctors or medical networks, can include primary care in
Mexico and emergency coverage in the United States. A different plan
can cover one family member in California and others living in
Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis recently directed the state Department of Managed
Health Care to encourage health insurers to enter the market, which
began growing more quickly after a 1998 state law allowed foreign
companies to offer health insurance here.</TE>
<TE>   Some U.S. companies already were beginning to offer cross-border
insurance. Since then, some have teamed with Mexican groups.</TE>
<TE>   Laying Down the Rules</TE>
<TE>   Under the law, say state officials, employers are required to
offer a choice of at least one U.S.-based plan in addition to any
cross-border insurance. The cross-border plans also are legally
responsible if patients are improperly denied care in Mexico,
officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if they are going to a place in Mexico, they have the same
rights as if they went to a doctor in California," said Joy Higa,
deputy director of the state managed-care agency.</TE>
<TE>   Patients seem less worried about protection than fast solutions,
cultural comprehension and price. So much so that some with stateside
insurance pay for unreimbursed tests and care in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout this border city, other patients echo the mantra: U.S.
doctors tell them to take over-the-counter drugs instead of
prescribing more aggressive treatment and medication. Many seem eager
for a quick fix that can return them quickly to jobs that provide no
sick pay.</TE>
<TE>   Some patients are miffed by U.S. doctors who don't understand
their accented English, by nurses and assistants who make them wait
weeks for appointments or send them to distant labs for tests.</TE>
<TE>   Debate on Quality</TE>
<TE>   Lower costs remain a primary draw: A Baja doctor's visit can cost
as little as $20; drugs can cost one-fifth as much.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of cross-border insurance say cheaper does not
necessarily mean inferior.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like comparing San Diego to Fresno," said Jim Arriola, who
established Blue Shield's nonprofit cross-border health group, Access
Baja. "Things are cheaper in Fresno [than Los Angeles], but does that
mean that Fresno is worse?"</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Jose Ramiro Lopez, a Mexican native who has practiced medicine
in San Diego and Tijuana, agrees that specialty care in the United
States is superior because there have been advances in such things as
liver transplants, brain surgery and treatment for unusual diseases.</TE>
<TE>   For primary care, however, "what is provided in Tijuana is the
same as in California," said Ramiro Lopez, who is certified as a
physician in both countries. "For the Latino community, the
communication is better in Tijuana. I live in San Diego and when I
have a problem, I go to Tijuana."</TE>
<TE>   Corlin, the Santa Monica gastroenterologist, disagrees sharply on
the quality comparison. Cases in which Mexican pharmacies have
dispensed drugs banned in the United States demonstrate that "there
are not as many checks and balances," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The best health care is that available close to home, Corlin
added, "not from a doctor 150 miles away that you can only see on
Saturdays."</TE>
<TE>   Health Net and Blue Shield officials say they do evaluate Mexican
doctors participating in their plans. They inspect their offices,
review medical licenses and even call the medical schools to verify
that the doctors earned degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Tijuana-based Sistemas Medicos Nacionales was the first Mexican
HMO to get a California license, teaming with Health Net to offer
Salud con Health Net ("Health With Health Net").</TE>
<TE>   Eighty-five employers--representing more than 11,500 Health Net
enrollees--include the Salud con Health Net option in their employee
benefits package. The plan, available in Los Angeles County, will be
offered in Orange County by early 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Health Net's regular HMO coverage, offered for a family of four,
is about $500 per month. A comparable Salud con Health Net plan is
about $303 per month, Health Net spokeswoman Lisa Kalustian said.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of a typical Blue Shield benefit plan for a California
family of four is about $600 a month, Arriola said. The same family
would pay about $300 a month for coverage in Tijuana through the
company's Access Baja plan. Enrollees can opt for primary care in
Mexico and emergency care in California.</TE>
<TE>   Some 3,500 people will be covered through Access Baja by the end
of 2002, Arriola said.</TE>
<TE>   Another company, Transwestern Insurance Administrators Inc.,
oversees a network of Mexican doctors for self-insured California
employers--mostly agricultural companies that pay for some of their
workers' care. There are 25,000 employees covered through
Transwestern, owner Roger Boman said.</TE>
<TE>   For all the growing numbers, some insurance companies are waiting
to see how the pioneers fare. Others have bowed out. Aetna, for
example, offered cross-border coverage in 1998 and 1999, but sold its
Mexican subsidiary and halted the plan.</TE>
<TE>   A Long Bus Trip</TE>
<TE>   U.S. residents like Cristina Iniquez are proof of the demand.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Ana woman awoke before dawn on a recent Saturday to
catch the 6:30 a.m. bus in downtown Santa Ana. She arrived at the
Tijuana border two hours and 45 minutes later.</TE>
<TE>   Iniquez has health coverage in the United States but preferred to
pay $300 at Hospital Delat--a clinic that more closely resembles a
budget hotel lobby--for doctors, lab work and medicine that she says
has cured her of anemia and a kidney infection.</TE>
<TE>   She has considered asking her employer to put cross-border
insurance in the benefit package. "If I could," she said, "I would
have a plan in Mexico because it would cover me for what I really
want."</TE>

<HD>New Hope in Search for Killer</HD>
<DH>Crime: DNA tests bring fresh evidence to light in the 1997
slaying of a Ventura student.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 13-inch stainless steel knife used to kill Buena High School
senior Jake Bush sits wrapped in plastic inside a large freezer at
the Ventura Police Department.</LD>
<LD>   It's been there for five years, since the 16-year-old track star
was stabbed to death after he and his mother walked in on a burglar
inside his family's Ventura-area home.</LD>
<LD>   For most of that time, the only clues from the knife were remnants
of Jake's clothing and blood. But this year, after several scientific
breakthroughs, authorities again tested it along with other evidence
and found DNA they believe will help identify Jake's killer.</LD>
<TE>   Even so, no one knows for sure if the killer will ever be caught.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just been so much time," Gail Shirley, Jake's mother, said
last week. "I have no doubt the police have done the best they can do
with what they have had to work with, but ... it may never be
solved."</TE>
<TE>   But law enforcement and civic leaders--citing evolving scientific
technology, a $10,000 reward and a hope that someone will step
forward with a critical tip--believe they will close the case.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tragedy that hasn't left our minds," said Assistant Police
Chief Gary McCaskill, who was a sergeant assigned to the
investigation in 1997. "It's a very important case, and I'm certain
we will solve it one day."</TE>
<TE>   Det. Pat Stevens, the current lead investigator, said patrol
officers still come into the station and mention seeing someone who
matches the suspect's description.</TE>
<TE>   "There are officers out there who are as passionate as I am about
solving this," Stevens said. "Even crooks I've dealt with say it was
a terrible thing that happened.</TE>
<TE>   "I know in time we will get an answer," he added.</TE>
<TE>   They have the weapon, motive and DNA, and now all the police say
they need is a fresh lead.</TE>
<TE>   Jake Bush was on a roll at the start of the summer of 1997. He had
finished his junior year and, as a standout student and athlete, was
planning to study advanced calculus and co-captain the varsity track
team that fall. He had landed a job at a local movie theater and had
just passed the written portion of the state driving test.</TE>
<TE>   "He was really finding his way," Shirley told The Times shortly
after her only child's death.</TE>
<TE>   On June 24, 1997, Shirley, a Balboa Middle School math teacher,
and her son returned to the family's Montalvo home about noon and
found that it had been burglarized. A bedroom window screen had been
pried off and a small television had been moved a few feet.</TE>
<TE>   As Shirley dialed 911 in one room, the burglar confronted Jake in
the den and stabbed him in the neck, arm and chest with a serrated
folding knife marketed in a mail-order catalog as "The Intimidator."</TE>
<TE>   Jake died in surgery a few hours later. The knife was recovered
the same day on a neighbor's driveway, probably dropped by the killer
as he fled on foot, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Based on information from witnesses in the neighborhood, police
described Jake's killer as a clean-shaven Latino male in his late
teens, about 5 feet 6 and slender with close-cropped black hair.</TE>
<TE>   Tests on the knife revealed Jake's blood, and fibers on the weapon
turned out to be strands of material from a decal on the T-shirt that
Jake had been wearing, Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Cheryl Temple said.</TE>
<TE>   But limits in scientific technology prevented authorities from
turning up more clues. Earlier this year, shortly after the county's
crime lab was certified for DNA tests, investigators handed over six
items from the crime scene for such testing, Temple said.</TE>
<TE>   Using a specialized test known as a Short Tandem Repeater,
analysts found what they believe is the suspect's DNA.</TE>
<TE>   "This evidence is extremely important," Temple said. "When we find
the person who matches this DNA profile, we will be able to place him
in the house with criminal intent on the day Jake Bush was killed."</TE>
<TE>   After obtaining the DNA profile, investigators questioned about
half a dozen men matching the suspect's physical description. Each
gave saliva samples, but none matched the DNA profile.</TE>
<TE>   The profile has been sent for comparison to the Department of
Justice's DNA databank in Sacramento, which contains tens of
thousands of DNA samples of convicted criminals. No match has yet
been found.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1998, state prisoners have been required to submit DNA
samples, along with thumb and palm prints. If Jake's killer is ever
convicted of a crime, authorities said, his DNA would go into the
state index system. Meanwhile, investigators, Shirley, and her
husband, Bob, wait and hope for a break.</TE>
<TE>   "I am relieved to know there is some new evidence and that maybe
they can find out who did this," Gail Shirley said. "But you can't
undo what's been done, so you learn to go forward every day."</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information in this case is urged to contact Stevens
at 339-4479. Anonymous tips can be phoned in to Crime Stoppers at
385-TALK or 494-TALK.</TE>

<HD>Opossum Killings Test Limits of Cruelty Cases</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: Courts focus on state of mind of defendants: Were
animals seen as threat?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When a security guard in Tustin discovered an opossum on a wall one
night, he beat it to death with his flashlight.</LD>
<LD>   When a Santa Fe Springs man spotted an opossum in his backyard, he
shot it three times with a crossbow. The animal survived until the
next morning, Easter Sunday, when the man finished it off with a
shovel and a pipe.</LD>
<LD>   One man pleaded guilty to cruelty to animals. Last week, the other
was acquitted of the same charge.</LD>
<TE>   Which all raises a few questions: What's the difference between
killing a pest, and inflicting cruel and unusual punishment on a
defenseless animal? Is killing the animal the problem? Or is it the
killer's state of mind that becomes the deciding factor?</TE>
<TE>   Such are the questions underlying possum justice.</TE>
<TE>   "I am seeing more people who are taking the law in their own hands
and abusing these animals instead of doing what is right--that is, to
call authorities or educate themselves first," said Aaron Reyes,
operations manager for South East Area Animal Control Authority, a
public agency. "They hide behind the excuse that they feel
threatened, when anyone who knows anything about possums knows they
are docile and terrified of other animals."</TE>
<TE>   Under California law, a person may kill a "fur-bearing mammal"
that is injuring property "at any time and in any manner." But animal
cruelty laws prohibit maliciously and intentionally maiming,
mutilating, torturing, wounding--or killing--an animal.</TE>
<TE>   Malice Is Key</TE>
<TE>   The key in the cases of the security guard and the homeowner were
the words "intentional" and "maliciously": whether the men meant to
inflict cruel and unusual punishment, or simply wanted to kill
animals they perceived as threatening.</TE>
<TE>   The opossum, North America's only native marsupial, dates to the
time of the Tyrannosaurus rex, according to the Opossum Society of
the United States. Members of the American variety, one of 65 opossum
species, have 50 teeth, opposable thumbs on their back feet, and eat
almost anything--cockroaches, figs, snails, garbage and pet food.</TE>
<TE>   But they definitely are not rodents.</TE>
<TE>   One problem, though--from the possum point of view, at least--is
that some people assume that it is an overgrown rat, and that it can
be trapped or killed as such.</TE>
<TE>   Michael S. Elliston, 20, had had his security guard license for
only two days on Feb. 17, when he encountered a possum while
patrolling behind the Tustin Drug Emporium. A witness who saw
Elliston knock the opossum off the wall and beat it flagged down a
police officer. A necropsy later revealed that the opossum was
pregnant.</TE>
<TE>   Elliston could not be reached for comment. But Tustin Police Sgt.
Tom Tarpley said Elliston told officers that he had been attacked as
a child by a possum.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically," said Tarpley, "he had been traumatized by that, and
every time he sees a possum, he kills it."</TE>
<TE>   One month later, on March 30, Kirk Broomall, 41, was sitting with
his family in their backyard when a possum appeared.</TE>
<TE>   "The animal was aggressive, it came toward me, hissed, showed its
teeth, it kept coming and coming," said Broomall, who runs a small
trucking company.</TE>
<TE>   Broomall said his yard had been home to possums before. Some, he
had had no problem with. Others--two, to be exact--had scared his
wife, he said, and he had trapped them in garbage cans, doused them
with gasoline and burned them to death.</TE>
<TE>   This time, Broomall got out his crossbow and shot the animal three
times. When the animal fell into a neighbor's backyard, he said, he
thought that it was dead.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, another neighbor saw the possum walking along a
wall, the arrows in its body. That neighbor took pictures of the
animal and called animal control--after alerting Broomall, who killed
the animal with a shovel and a pipe and disposed of its carcass.</TE>
<TE>   Reyes of the animal control authority, which investigated the case
before sending it to the district attorney's office, insisted that
the incident could have been prevented. "Had this man made a phone
call to the authorities, we would have responded, picked it up and
educated him," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Broomall said that before he shot the opossum, he
called the animal control authority but was discouraged when told he
could rent a trap. "They really failed us," he said. "They were not
informative."</TE>
<TE>   Across Southern California, each animal control agency has
different rules for handling possum reports. While potentially
dangerous animals, such as wayward mountain lions or bears, will draw
a quick response, animals like opossums are almost too commonplace
and harmless to bother with.</TE>
<TE>   Animal Rescue</TE>
<TE>   Some agencies work with the Opossum Rescue Society to recover and
relocate opossums (state law dictates that a possum can be relocated
only within a three-mile radius of where it was discovered). Some
will rent out traps.</TE>
<TE>   Most agencies will first counsel the caller and try to dispel any
misperceptions he or she might have. Experts said that under normal
conditions, the opossum is a docile animal that will stay in one
location two or three days before moving on.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, Elliston was charged with felony animal cruelty, a
charge that was later reduced to a misdemeanor. Broomall was charged
with a misdemeanor--prompting People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals and the Humane Society of the United States to lobby Los
Angeles County prosecutors to reconsider.</TE>
<TE>   "This type of crime is a wobbler," said Tori Richards, spokeswoman
for the Orange County district attorney's office, which prosecuted
Elliston. "We had a total of four attorneys review this case as to
whether it should be a misdemeanor or a felony ... they all thought
it should be a misdemeanor."</TE>
<TE>   So, in the end, who pleaded guilty to the malicious killing of a
possum? The security guard or the homeowner?</TE>
<TE>   The security guard. In May a judge placed Elliston on three years
probation and ordered him to complete 60 hours of community service
involving animal care, pay restitution, attend counseling and donate
$300 to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
Elliston also lost his job as a security guard.</TE>
<TE>   Broomall's case went to trial amid media coverage that prompted
his lawyer to say that he had tried 20 murder cases with less
attention than the possum case.</TE>
<TE>   After leaning toward a guilty verdict, jurors in Broomall's case
eventually decided that, although they found his act objectionable
and questioned whether he was indeed defending his family, they
believed that his was not an intentionally malicious act.</TE>
<TE>   On July 18, they found him not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though we knew what he had done before, and it bothered us,
we had to judge him on his intent," juror Maryann Vizcaino told the
Whittier Daily News. "He never said he didn't want to kill it.</TE>
<TE>   "If he had been charged with the first two [burning] incidents, we
would have found him guilty," she said. "We were mad that we couldn't
try him on everything."</TE>
<TE>   Dana Campbell, staff attorney at the Animal Legal Defense Fund,
said she is hearing about more cases of people being prosecuted
nationwide under animal cruelty laws--in part because of stronger
anti-cruelty laws. There were nine states in 1995 with strong
anti-cruelty laws, she said; today, 35 states plus the District of
Columbia have them.</TE>
<TE>   Of the possum cases in Southern California, Campbell said, "I am
hoping this is an aberration and people don't go around shooting
things in their backyard they are afraid of."</TE>
<TE>   Broomall said he will never again think of the opossum as an
overgrown rodent.</TE>
<TE>   "I've learned a lot," he said. "Quite a lot about our judicial
system, and about possums. I feel really bad, knowing what I know
now."</TE>

<HD>Payout Weighed in Foster Care Death</HD>
<DH>Lawsuit: Board to vote on $1-million settlement to mother
of boy, 9, who died of an asthma attack.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARRETT THEROLF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County officials have recommended paying $1 million to
settle lawsuits filed by a woman whose 9-year-old son died of an
asthma attack while in foster care.</LD>
<LD>   Debra Reid had accused foster care workers of failing to take
basic steps to prevent a fatal asthma attack in her son Jonathan, who
died two weeks after he was placed in a home.</LD>
<LD>   In a second lawsuit, Reid said the county violated her civil
rights by removing another son, Debvin, from her home for 15 months.</LD>
<TE>   Reid, 44, said she felt gratified and vindicated by the
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Before removing Jonathan from her home in 1997, county social
workers said Reid had not provided appropriate care and may have
suffered from Munchausen's syndrome, a malady in which a parent fakes
a child's illness to gain attention.</TE>
<TE>   "This shows that I wasn't crazy and it was important to me that I
at least stay in court on this case long enough to hit the
million-dollar mark and send a message to [the Department of Children
and Family Services] on behalf of children," Reid said. "I want them
to know that they can't take children away from their parents without
cause."</TE>
<TE>   The county counsel's office recommended the settlement after
attorneys predicted Reid could win as much as $2.1 million if the
case over her son's death went to trial. Attorneys also concluded
that a jury would decide in Reid's favor in the second suit, and
potentially award her an additional $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors is scheduled to vote on the settlement
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the Department of Children and Family Services
refused to comment. She said she was barred from discussing the case
until it is finalized.</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Reid was placed in foster care in 1997 after county
officials decided his mother was unable to meet his medical needs
related to his diabetes and asthma.</TE>
<TE>   County social workers said Reid was too busy harassing them for
additional services and not doing her own part in Jonathan's care,
according to court records.</TE>
<TE>   Reid described Jonathan as a shy boy who was reluctant to leave
the family porch without his mother.</TE>
<TE>   After Jonathan was placed in foster care, he repeatedly tried to
run away. After one escape attempt, he jumped from a social worker's
car as he was being driven to see a doctor. His action was called a
suicide attempt, and he was institutionalized for several days and
given an antidepressant.</TE>
<TE>   Six weeks after being committed to the county's care, and just 13
days after Jonathan was sent to a foster home, he suffered a fatal
asthma attack. His foster parents had taken him to a doctor, who told
investigators that she treated the boy without complete medical
records.</TE>
<TE>   In his letter outlining Reid's case against the county, Assistant
County Counsel Kevin C. Brazile told supervisors that the Department
of Children and Family Services failed to inform the boy's doctor of
the severity of his asthma, and that the doctor was ready to testify
that she may have been able to thwart a fatal asthma attack if that
information had been provided.</TE>
<TE>   "A jury could conclude that [the Department of Children and Family
Services] was a cause of Jonathan [Reid's] death," Brazile wrote.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Reid was optimistic that supervisors would
approve the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "[County officials] kept telling me that I was dragging [the
lawsuit] out. But in the end, they said my case was worth $3
million," Reid said. "I think the department has had more to answer
than I ever will. I kept Jonathan alive for nine years. He lasted
only two weeks in their care."</TE>
<TE>   Since Jonathan's death, Reid has supported legislation that would
allow criminal charges to be filed against social workers who file
false reports. Reid said social workers falsified reports to take
Jonathan and Debvin away from her.</TE>
<TE>   She also has organized protests of the county's foster care
system. "We received national attention on TV and things like that,"
Reid said. "If my child had to die, there can be no better cause for
him to die for."</TE>

<CX>   Foster care death--A story in Monday's California section did not
fully identify the disorder that social workers said afflicted Debra
Reid, the mother of a boy who died in foster care. The workers said
she suffered from Munchausen's syndrome by proxy, in which a parent
fakes a child's illness to gain attention. Reid denies the claim.</CX>

<HD>Video Alone Won't Settle Beating Case</HD>
<DH>Inglewood: Experts say that much on the tape is open to
interpretation, and that gas station surveillance footage might aid
accused officer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE BERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At first glance, the home video recording of an Inglewood police
officer beating 16-year-old Donovan Jackson seems to leave little in
doubt. The images are clear and disturbing: Officer Jeremy J. Morse
slams the youth onto the trunk of a patrol car and then punches him
in the jaw.</LD>
<LD>   Case closed? Not by a long shot, say some legal experts in the use
of force and jury selection.</LD>
<LD>   Although the videotape means Morse's attorney will have a lot of
explaining to do if the indicted officer goes to trial on assault
charges, prosecutors also will face problems, the experts say.</LD>
<TE>   To start with, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office
will have to deal with additional videotapes recorded by surveillance
cameras at the Inglewood gas station where the incident took place
July 6.</TE>
<TE>   The grainy recordings, made public by the defense a week ago,
appear to show about 1 1/2-minutes of scuffling between Jackson and
several officers that occurred just before the trunk slamming was
captured on tape by part-time disc jockey Mitchell Crooks from across
the street.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys contend that the surveillance tapes provide
visual evidence, along with the emotional impact it carries,
corroborating police claims that Jackson resisted arrest before he
was handcuffed. They also put Morse's violent actions in context,
they say.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, a video, even when seared into the consciousness of
television viewers, does not necessarily ensure a conviction. That
was demonstrated by the infamous 1991 video of four LAPD officers
arresting motorist Rodney King.</TE>
<TE>   The video shows King being struck with batons more than 50 times
in 81 seconds. Nonetheless, a Simi Valley jury acquitted the
officers. Later, however, the tape was used in a federal trial to
help convict two of them.</TE>
<TE>   "There is still plenty [on the Inglewood tapes] open for
interpretation," said Loyola Law School professor Laurie Levenson, a
former federal prosecutor. "This case is not an absolute winner for
either side."</TE>
<TE>   If prosecutors win a conviction, Morse, 24, could get three years
in prison. His partner, Bijan Darvish, 25, charged with writing a
false police report, also faces a possible three-year prison term.</TE>
<TE>   The Crooks video is expected to be a powerful tool for prosecutors
because, at first impression, such evidence is viewed by juries as an
objective reflection of reality. That makes videos hard to challenge,
said Harland Braun, who successfully defended LAPD Officer Theodore
J. Briseno in the federal Rodney King trial. "They create a
superficial impression that you know what happened because you saw it
with your own eyes," Braun said.</TE>
<TE>   When tapes are enhanced or run in slow motion, they can make an
image seem even more violent than at regular speed, said Joe
Saltzman, associate dean of the USC Annenberg School of
Communications. "Hitting someone with a fist is a [quick] boom, bang
event, but when you slow it down, it looks much more horrific," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, videotapes can be stripped of their impact when
they are played over and over again, said Gary Blasi, a UCLA law
professor who is conducting research on juror attitudes.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is any lesson to be learned from the [acquittals in the]
Rodney King case, it is that the jury saw them over 50 times, frame
by frame, so that over a period it lost all meaning," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you break it down frame by frame, it is no longer a story
about an individual. It becomes an analytical thing, and it loses its
emotional appeal."</TE>
<TE>   Reactions Heard on Tape</TE>
<TE>   The Crooks tape reveals powerful details when viewed without
enhancements or slow motion. For one thing, as Morse reaches the
patrol car carrying Jackson by his shirt and the seat of his pants,
the tape appears to show the officer, like a baseball pitcher rearing
back to hurl a fast ball, hoisting the youth up higher so that he can
throw him down harder.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the shocked reactions of Crooks and his friends are
clearly audible as Morse manhandles Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Yet as harsh as Morse appears, the Crooks tape still gives defense
attorneys room for argument.</TE>
<TE>   Darvish's attorney, Ronald G. Brower, said one image will help him
show that Darvish did not file a false report by failing to reveal
Morse slammed Jackson on the car's trunk. That image, Brower
contends, shows Darvish looking away at the moment that Jackson's
body crashes on the car.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney John Barnett, who is representing Morse, said the tapes
carry a major advantage for the defense that the King tapes did not
provide. Instead of having to explain a cascade of baton blows, he
said he only has to explain two actions by Morse.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the Inglewood video lacks the extremely damaging
audio sounds that the King video carried, said Barnett, who defended
Officer Briseno during the Simi Valley trial in the King beating.
"You could hear the bones breaking, and the metal batons clanging
against the concrete and flesh," he said. "It was a very unpleasant
sound."</TE>
<TE>   Some experts said good defense lawyers also can draw attention to
what cannot be seen on videotape. They say such a tactic probably
will be used to support Morse's claim that he hit Jackson in the jaw
because the youth had grabbed him in the groin area.</TE>
<TE>   Just before Morse struck him, Jackson is seen on tape bent over
the trunk of the car, with Morse standing very close behind.
Jackson's hands are handcuffed behind him, but they are out of view.</TE>
<TE>   "I would want to look at where Jackson's hands could have been,
and say, 'Isn't it possible that he could have been grabbing at the
officer's groin area?' " said Stanley Goldman, a Loyola Law School
professor.</TE>
<TE>   Although Jackson's hands aren't visible on the Crooks tape,
Morse's hands are. Moments before the punch, Morse moves his own hand
down toward his groin, a movement that Barnett is likely to interpret
as the reflex action of a man who has been grabbed in such a
sensitive area.</TE>
<TE>   Such arguments do not address why Morse harshly slammed the youth
into the trunk of the patrol car moments earlier. The defense also
will still have to contend with a jury pool that has seen the Crooks
tape repeatedly and has heard a litany of condemnation of the
officers, some experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Statements by elected officials and community leaders have
inflamed the public, said defense attorney Ira Salzman, who
unsuccessfully defended LAPD Sgt. Stacey C. Koon in the federal King
beating trial.</TE>
<TE>   "These irresponsible comments that say there is no legitimate
defense will make it more difficult to deal with the tape," Salzman
said.</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, say that American society today is less
susceptible to emotion-laden videos than it was when the King tapes
stirred outrage around the world.</TE>
<TE>   America has been around the block a few times since then, said
Philip K. Anthony, head of DecisionQuest jury consultants in Los
Angeles. People are still numb from the horrendous sight of airplanes
crashing into the World Trade Center and remain preoccupied with
terrorism and now a tanking economy, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In today's social and psychological climate, the Inglewood jury
will be more insistent on hearing facts that explain what the
videotape shows and less inclined to let emotions govern their
conclusions, Anthony said.</TE>
<TE>   "They may reach the same conclusions, but they will base it on
facts," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony said the surveillance videos of the fight between Jackson
and the officers before he was handcuffed also may help Morse.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be evidence that the victim deserved to be treated the
way [Morse] did," he said. "Other jurors will see it as police
brutality."</TE>
<TE>   The surveillance cameras pick up the events after Jackson and his
father, Coby Chavis, 41, pulled up in a Ford Taurus to the gas pumps
at a Thrifty station on Century Boulevard. Because the tapes are so
murky, officers can only be identified by linking the scenes to
information in police reports.</TE>
<TE>   Some defense experts say the surveillance tapes can help Morse's
lawyer explain why Morse slammed Jackson onto the trunk. That action,
coming a few seconds after a long tussle in which Morse was injured,
indicates that he still could have been in "the fight mode," said
Charles Duke Jr., a use-of-force expert for the Los Angeles Police
Department and now a private consultant.</TE>
<TE>   "His adrenalin must have really been flowing because he picked him
up pretty easily," said Duke, who usually testifies in court in favor
of police officers. "It looked to me like he didn't realize how
strong he was at the moment."</TE>
<TE>   Station Tapes Grainy</TE>
<TE>   Two gas station surveillance cameras record the events leading up
to the fight. Although they are grainy, and neither had a wide enough
angle to show the entire incident, together they cover a six-minute
span through the conclusion of the scuffle. The violent encounter on
the Crooks tape takes place out of the surveillance cameras' view.</TE>
<TE>   Four minutes into the sequence, one of the cameras captures the
first clear images of a fight, when several officers and Jackson are
seen entering the frame and tumbling to the pavement. But the poor
quality of the tapes and their incomplete range makes it difficult to
determine who started the fight or who was hitting whom.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Jackson was swinging his fists at them, pulling on an
officer's uniform and at one point scratching Morse above his ear,
causing him to bleed. Darvish said he hit Jackson twice. But, without
any improvement to the quality of the video, those fight details
aren't clearly visible.</TE>
<TE>   Near the end of the sequence covered by the system, Jackson
appears to be motionless on the pavement for anywhere from 15 to 30
seconds before Morse is seen picking him up and carrying him to the
police cruiser, where the Crooks tape shows him slamming the youth
onto the trunk.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides have already started putting their own spin on the
surveillance tapes. Lawyers for the Inglewood officers say they show
Jackson as a violent person just seconds before he became the limp,
submissive body being manhandled by Morse.</TE>
<TE>   Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., who briefly represented Jackson, said, "I
think it's going to help our side of the case," because it shows that
an officer "escalates the fray very aggressively."</TE>
<TE>   Salzman, one of the King case lawyers, said he is unsure whether
the prosecution has to worry about the images on the surveillance
tapes. "It was so grainy, I couldn't really make much of it," he
said. "I couldn't see any punches, but it may be of some use to the
defense."</TE>
<TE>   USC law professor Erwin Chemerinsky said the surveillance tapes
have little value for the defense beyond verifying police reports
that a fight took place before Jackson was handcuffed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to imagine anything [on the tapes] to justify a beating
after Jackson was handcuffed," he said.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Ventura County prepares to celebrate the opening of a long-awaited
Cal State campus, a handful of students at the county's branch campus
of Cal State Northridge say they are being forgotten.</LD>
<LD>   After providing the impetus from which the new campus could grow,
those students say they are facing shrinking course offerings and a
lack of academic guidance.</LD>
<LD>   Now, they are concerned about graduating on time. Liberal studies
majors seem particularly hard-hit and fear the problems could hurt
their ability to earn their teaching credentials. "To me this is
ridiculous ... it's like a slap in the face," said Maddie Valenzuela,
a 21-year-old liberal studies major who is scheduled to graduate from
CSUN in spring 2003.</LD>
<TE>   She worries that she won't be able to take the required courses
when she needs them, potentially delaying her graduation and entry
into a teacher credential program.</TE>
<TE>   And even more frustrating, she feels that college administrators
are more focused on smoothing the way for students in Cal State
Channel Islands' first class this fall than they are on helping
existing CSUN students graduate on time.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like they needed students there so they could get
university status, and now that they have their status, they don't
need us," Valenzuela said. "I'm really disappointed in how they
treated us."</TE>
<TE>   University officials acknowledge that some students might have a
bumpy transition as the two schools coexist on the Channel Islands
campus until the CSUN branch phases out by 2006.</TE>
<TE>   But they say they are trying their best to make sure each student
graduates on schedule.</TE>
<TE>   With 1,900 full- and part-time students, the local CSUN branch is
the largest off-campus center in the Cal State University system.</TE>
<TE>   It is unknown how many students are experiencing similar
difficulties, but Steve Lefevre, director of the CSUN campus at
Channel Islands, said he has spoken with about a dozen students who
were concerned about meeting the graduation requirements.</TE>
<TE>   While he reassures them that the school is committed to helping
them graduate in a timely fashion, he said he realizes the transition
between the two schools may not be smooth for everyone. "We want to
be good with our commitment to students," he said. "But I can't say
[the transition] will be perfect....It's a little bit of an
experiment."</TE>
<TE>   The conflict stems from CSUN's plan to slowly phase out its major
programs to make way for similar CSUCI programs.</TE>
<TE>   The branch campus is limiting the number of courses it offers in
certain majors as it attempts to reduce its overall enrollment in the
next few years.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, there are fewer weekend and evening classes, which
makes it difficult for some students who work full time and can't
take classes during the day.</TE>
<TE>   Lefevre said he empathizes with those students, but since there
are a dwindling number of students in the programs slated to be
phased out, there won't be as many sections of certain courses as
there have been in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Students have the option of transferring from CSUN to Channel
Islands, but there is no guarantee the degree requirements will be

<LD>As Ventura County prepares to celebrate the opening of a long-awaited
Cal State campus, a handful of students at the county's branch campus
of Cal State Northridge say they are being forgotten.</LD>
<LD>   After providing the impetus from which the new four-year campus
could grow, those students say they are facing shrinking course
offerings and a lack of academic guidance.</LD>
<LD>   Now, they are concerned about graduating on time. Liberal studies
majors seem particularly hard-hit and fear the problems could hurt
their ability to earn their teaching credentials. "To me this is

<TE>   University officials acknowledge that some students might have a
bumpy transition as the two schools coexist on the Cal State Channel
Islands campus until the CSUN branch phases out by 2006.</TE>
<TE>   With 1,900 full- and part-time students, the local CSUN branch is
one of the largest off-campus center in the Cal State University
system.</TE>
<TE>   It is unknown how many students are experiencing similar

Channel Islands, said he has spoken with about a dozen students who

<TE>   Students have the option of transferring from CSUN to Cal State
Channel Islands, but there is no guarantee the degree requirements
will be the same. But college administrators have pledged to work
with students to make sure they can graduate with a CSUN degree.</TE>
<TE>   "Some students are on a slower track. And we can't guarantee we
will have every class they need seven years down the road," said Sue
Saunders of the Channel Islands advisement center. "But we want to be
flexible and want the transition to be seamless for students."</TE>
<TE>   Northridge students who are having difficulty planning their
course schedules have other options, she said. They can take
independent study or distance learning courses through CSUN or could
work with advisors to see if they can take a comparable course
through CSUCI. Or, in what several students viewed as a last resort,
they could commute to the main Northridge campus to take their final
upper-division courses.</TE>
<TE>   None of those options has been convenient for 30-year-old
Stephanie Grabow. The liberal studies major wants to graduate as soon
as possible, to more quickly realize her dream of becoming an
elementary school teacher.</TE>
<TE>   But before she can begin teaching, she must graduate from a
teacher credential program. She considered CSUCI's program but was
frustrated, she said, by not being able to get advisors to clearly
state the program's entry requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, last spring, she learned she would have to take an
additional four courses to be accepted into the CSUCI program.</TE>
<TE>   The extra courses amounted to about half a year of work, further
pushing back the date when Grabow could receive her teaching
credential.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, that would mean a six-year degree," Grabow said. "And I
want to start teaching now."</TE>
<TE>   That sentiment is shared by fellow liberal studies major Melissa
Lim, who is scheduled to graduate in December. Lim said her
experience at CSUN has been positive.</TE>
<TE>   As of the end of spring term, "nobody knew what the [teacher]
credentialing program would entail, what the requirements would be,"
she said. "I think we've all gotten tired of waiting for them to
figure it out. It's just easier to go somewhere else."</TE>
<TE>   Lim now plans to attend Azusa Pacific University after graduation.
It offers a teaching credential program in which students can earn
both their teaching credential and a master's degree in education in
less than two years.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Valenzuela still hasn't gotten that far. She is working
full time and took summer courses at both the Northridge main campus
and the Channel Islands campus.</TE>
<TE>   This fall, she plans to take two online courses, as well as two
evening classes at the Northridge main campus.</TE>
<TE>   While she resents having to make the commute, she said she doesn't
have any other options.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to get done," she said. "And now this is another
rather large roadblock to getting done. I feel like my whole
education track has been completely uprooted."</TE>

<HD>Cameras Patrol More Schools</HD>
<DH>Security: High-tech measures at five Orange Unified schools
are for safety, officials say. Signs will be posted warning of the
video surveillance.</DH>

<AU>MARJORIE HERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vandals and trespassers beware: new camera systems will be rolling
into five Orange Unified high schools this fall, following the lead
of other school districts that have resorted to high-tech measures to
ensure campus safety.</LD>
<LD>   The Orange Unified School District Board of Trustees has earmarked
$485,045 of its state safety grant for the cameras, which will be
installed at Richland Continuation, Canyon, El Modena, Orange and
Villa Park high schools in September.</LD>
<LD>   School officials believe the cameras' presence will curb
vandalism, gang activity, fights, theft and minor infractions, such
as trespassing or skateboarding because people will know their
actions are being captured.</LD>
<TE>   Principal SK Johnson hopes the 27 cameras to be installed at
Orange High School will prevent break-ins. Last year, vandals damaged
five computers, office furniture and other supplies in the school's
main office.</TE>
<TE>   "If it cuts down the vandalism ... I think it would be a wise
expenditure," Johnson said. "It's another set of eyes out there to
help keep the school safe if something were to happen."</TE>
<TE>   The cameras, which will run 24 hours, seven days a week, will have
the ability to store data on CDs. Signs posted on school grounds will
warn that videotaping is underway.</TE>
<TE>   Privacy concerns were discussed, but school officials noted that
the cameras do not have an audio track and will not be placed inside
buildings. Access to the recorded footage will be controlled.</TE>
<TE>   "I know how some people are going to respond to this--like Big
Brother is watching," said Brent Bailey, Richland Continuation School
principal. "But we are using [the cameras] to make it a safer place
to go to school."</TE>
<TE>   Bailey said he plans to discuss the seven cameras on the Richland
campus during an assembly with the school's 300 students.</TE>
<TE>   The movement for video cameras on campus grounds has increased
throughout the country over the last few years in the aftermath of
several high-profile school violence cases, including Columbine High
School in Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Capistrano Unified has cameras on five of its campuses, with San
Clemente High School installing the first cameras two years ago. The
district also is considering putting video cameras in its school
buses, said Dave Smollar, the district's director of communications.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Unified School District doesn't have a districtwide
video surveillance policy, but Granada Hills and Huntington Park high
schools have cameras with monitors that carry the video feeds to the
offices of campus police and school administrators.</TE>
<TE>   Police say the extra "eyes" on school grounds are a good
investment, not only for preventing vandalism and trespassing, but
also for catching and demanding restitution from those responsible
for the crimes.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you can use video technology to cover your physical
plant, that is a good thing to do," said Alan Kerstein, LAUSD school
police chief. "You will be able to cover more ground and will make
the security force much more efficient."</TE>
<TE>   School officials hope the cameras will be seen as preventive tools
against crime and an important source of physical evidence.</TE>

<HD>Crews Set Scene for County Fair</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Hot musical groups will add spark to more
familiar festivities at the Seaside Park event, which opens
Wednesday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN F. SHERRY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Ventura County Fair, which opens Wednesday, will serve up
everything from cooking competitions to shows by two of the hottest
music groups in the country.</LD>
<LD>   Los Tigres del Norte, a popular group credited with redefining
Mexican music, will perform Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "They're the biggest act going in the Hispanic market," said fair
spokeswoman Teri Raley.</LD>
<TE>   Sugar Ray, a rock band that started in Orange County but now has
an international following, will appear Aug. 5. Other entertainers
include Travis Tritt, Kenny Loggins, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Jim
Belushi &amp; the Sacred Hearts, the Smothers Brothers and K.C. &amp; the
Sunshine Band.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors to the fair--attendance was more than 277,000 last
year--aren't likely to be bowled over by big changes, Raley said.
They might notice a new 7-foot-tall Eiffel Tower model in the Gem and
Mineral Building or be disappointed that senior discounts now start
at age 62 instead of 55, but for the most part, they will find a fair
that echoes the past.</TE>
<TE>   Workers have been putting the last touches on the midway at
Ventura's Seaside Park.</TE>
<TE>   In the Floriculture Building, landscapers maneuvered construction
equipment across the muddy ground as they turned mounds of rocks and
dirt into works of art. Outside, dozens of vendors set up booths
where they will hawk cotton candy, hot dogs on a stick and other
traditional fare.</TE>
<TE>   At their newly painted yellow-and-green stand, Barry Wittenberg
and Robert Fenn said they expect to sell about 20,000 ears of roasted
corn, just as they have in the past.</TE>
<TE>   "It's quick service and it's low entertainment," Fenn said.</TE>
<TE>   The rides are to be set up early this week. Most were to be
trucked to Ventura after the close of the Orange County Fair on
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   As in past years, the fair will have a number of theme days.
Friday is Youth Day, with free admission for children 12 and younger.
Aug. 6 is Seniors and Persons with Disabilities Day, offering free
admission to anyone 62 and older or disabled.</TE>
<TE>   Aug. 7 is Pepsi Family Day, during which two adults and any number
of children 12 and younger from the same family will be admitted for
$15 with a special coupon. Aug. 8 is Military Appreciation Day, when
anyone with a current military ID will be admitted free.</TE>
<TE>   Wristbands that allow 10 rides for $10 can be used until 8 p.m.
Wednesday and Thursday and Aug. 5, 6, 7, and 8.</TE>
<TE>   Parking is available at Seaside Park for $5. Free shuttles will
run continuously between Seaside Park and the County Government
Center, Ventura High School, Pacific View Mall, Ventura Harbor
(corner of Schooner Drive and Harbor Boulevard) and the Oxnard
Performing Arts Center.</TE>
<TE>   The Ventura County Fair runs Wednesday through Aug. 11 at Seaside
Park, 10 W. Harbor Blvd., in Ventura. The fair opens every day at 11
a.m., and exhibits close and fireworks begin at 10 p.m. General
admission is $7. Children 6-12 and adults 62 and older pay $4 and
children 5 and younger are admitted free. For details, log onto

<HD>DWP Project Preserves Reservoir Vistas</HD>
<DH>Access: Two lakes in the Hollywood Hills have reopened with
a new water system but the same scenery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEORGE RAMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To the delight of many, a four-year, $85-million project to improve
the water delivery system at the Upper and Lower Hollywood reservoirs
has been completed, prompting officials to once again allow public
access to the scenic area.</LD>
<LD>   "It's about time," jogger Guillermo Roma, 36, said the other day
as he completed a 3.1-mile run around the two reservoirs in the
Hollywood Hills. "I missed running here because it's so peaceful and
beautiful."</LD>
<LD>   After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the Los Angeles Department
of Water and Power restricted public access to the Hollywood
reservoirs and other DWP facilities to protect against threats to the
system's water quality and to ensure the project's continuation.</LD>
<TE>   DWP officials declined to talk in detail about heightened security
measures, but said no threats against the Hollywood reservoirs had
been detected.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't have anything close to a terrorist-oriented threat,"
said Richard Harasick, the DWP's assistant director of water
resources.</TE>
<TE>   The project, officials and residents said, has accomplished its
two major goals: ensuring water quality and preserving the reservoirs
as scenic spots.</TE>
<TE>   There's also an added benefit. The sometimes-milky appearance of
water from the tap has been eliminated by getting rid of air pockets
created when the new facilities were built.</TE>
<TE>   Conceived in the early 1990s, the improvement project was
undertaken by the DWP to comply with federal and state regulations
requiring stringent treatment for water stored in open-air
reservoirs. Such treatment is deemed necessary because those bodies
of water are exposed to surface water runoff that can affect quality.</TE>
<TE>   Discussions have been underway for years about how best to deal
with water quality at such places as the Silver Lake and Ivanhoe
reservoirs in Silver Lake, and the Elysian Reservoir in Elysian Park.</TE>
<TE>   At the Rowena Reservoir in the Los Feliz district, work on a
10-million-gallon underground storage tank was completed last year,
meeting the goal of protecting water quality there.</TE>
<TE>   To counter the concerns of nearby residents who feared that Rowena
would lose its picturesque atmosphere, DWP engineers agreed to build
an aesthetically pleasing landscape on top of the storage tank.</TE>
<TE>   The artificial vista included two small ponds.</TE>
<TE>   When discussions about the Hollywood project began, residents
accustomed to the panoramic views of the reservoirs feared that they
would lose the vistas. They had heard of the DWP plans to cover the
Silver Lake and Ivanhoe reservoirs, an idea that has since been
discarded, and of the comment by one DWP engineer, who bluntly told
some residents that they would have to lose their scenic views.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to lose that view, but I was afraid to tell the DWP
that," said one Hollywood Hills resident, who asked that he not be
identified. "I guess I'm still afraid of them, but I'm glad we spoke
up. They listened to us."</TE>
<TE>   Residents were skeptical about a DWP proposal to build a water
filtration plant at the reservoirs. Then engineers focused on a plan
that seemed to make everyone happy:</TE>
<TE>   * Bury two 30-million-gallon tanks in a hillside next to the
lakes, replacing the reservoirs, built in 1927, as the source of
water for 500,000 DWP customers in the Hollywood area.</TE>
<TE>   * Retain the two reservoirs as storage areas for water in case of
an emergency, thus maintaining the vistas.</TE>
<TE>   * Construct a pipeline from the San Fernando Valley to transport
water to the two underground tanks.</TE>
<TE>   As the work progressed, some wondered if the project was worth it.
Dust, noise and street detours were commonplace.</TE>
<TE>   But in the end, most in the area appreciated the result: newly
landscaped hillsides that add to the secluded reservoirs' idyllic
ambience.</TE>
<TE>   "It's even a better place to run now," said Roma, the jogger, "and
it's still close to the hustle and bustle of Hollywood."</TE>
<TE>   The DWP and Kiewit Pacific, an Omaha construction company with
offices in Santa Fe Springs that handled the project, staged a
gathering Saturday to thank residents for their patience during the
project and to dedicate the new facilities.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something we can be proud of," the DWP's Harasick said.</TE>

<HD>Caring U.S. Group Helps Heal Vietnam's Outcasts</HD>
<DH>Charity: Organization funds surgery for village children
with disfiguring or debilitating conditions who would otherwise face
ostracism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN LETRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At La Quinta High School in Westminster, Thanh Nguyen teaches
students how to make sense of abstract math equations. Outside the
classroom, he teaches a more important topic: compassion.</LD>
<LD>   The 44-year-old Garden Grove resident is co-founder of Social
Assistance for Vietnam, a nonprofit group that provides medical
assistance to children in rural and remote villages in Vietnam.</LD>
<LD>   In those tiny hamlets, where access roads, electricity, toilets
and clean running water are a novelty, children with conditions such
as cleft palate, clubfoot and polio often are treated as outcasts.</LD>
<TE>   "They are just invisible people," said Chau Nguyen, an optometrist
and another founding member with Thanh Nguyen. The two are not
related. "You will never hear Thanh mention it, but every day after
classes end, he is working on these projects until evening."</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, Thanh Nguyen begins his annual monthlong trip to
Vietnam, taking with him 246,000 pounds of medical supplies that
recently filled a Garden Grove warehouse.</TE>
<TE>   The journey marks a decade of service for Social Assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen and volunteers raise funds with raffles, by courting
private contributors and placing donation boxes at restaurants and
markets. In recent years, the group has raised about $150,000
annually--money that allows them to help as many as 640 children.</TE>
<TE>   The funds pay for surgery, transportation from the remote villages
to hospitals in Saigon, Da Nang and in provinces. Money for food,
medical supplies and recovery beds also is provided.</TE>
<TE>   Social Assistance's main focus is to provide corrective surgery
for children between 18 months and 16 years old, most of whom are
burn victims, or who contracted polio or were born with birth
defects. The group works with doctors and volunteers in Vietnam, plus
nuns and monks who run free clinics there.Nguyen and four others
founded the organization in 1992 with $1,755 from their own pockets.
The group has built homes and schools and provided wheelchairs to the
needy.</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen has seen struggles all his life. Growing up in Saigon, now
Ho Chi Minh City, the third-oldest of nine children, he recalls his
mother's charity.</TE>
<TE>   "My mother only owned a small fabric shop, but any time a stranger
or friend came by our door asking for a few dollars, she gave it to
them," Nguyen said. "I grew up in a family where, if we had something
to eat and someone else didn't, we shared our food with them."</TE>
<TE>   After 1975, his father was imprisoned in a reeducation camp and
his mother's shop was confiscated.</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen escaped Ho Chi Minh City in 1982, staying at refugee camps
in the Philippines and Malaysia. There he began his role as a
volunteer and teacher, helping others adjust to a new life. He also
met his wife-to-be, Ann.</TE>
<TE>   He came to the United States in 1983. Five years later, he
returned to work in a refugee camp in Hong Kong.</TE>
<TE>   "It has to do with the compassion that we were all taught," said
Nguyen, a Buddhist.</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, he graduated from UC Irvine with a degree in computer
science, and married Ann. They have two children. He taught computer
and math classes in Los Angeles before coming to La Quinta in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen envisioned an organization built on compassion, direct
involvement--and one that would last. "I didn't want this
organization to be born and then dissolve in a year," Nguyen said.
"We needed to know that we could control and supervise the program to
make sure our help would go directly to the recipients, and we need
to make sure we had the right people to manage the project here and
in Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   "We see ourselves as a bridge to connect those in need in Vietnam
with those here in the United States who want to help those in need,"
Nguyen said.</TE>

<HD>A Fair at Its Height --in Attendance Too</HD>
<DH>Events: The dizzying Adrenaline Drop, classic rock bands
are among the highlights of the annual attraction. The 17-day run
ended Sunday in Costa Mesa.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Atop the Adrenaline Drop, Jason Rodriguez heard a chorus of boos from
a crowd of onlookers below urging him to take the 85-foot plunge into
the net.</LD>
<LD>   Rodriguez didn't care. He wouldn't budge.</LD>
<LD>   "I just couldn't do it," said Rodriguez, 33, of Oregon. "There is
no way."</LD>
<TE>   Operators of the Adrenaline Drop, one of the most popular "rides"
at this year's Orange County Fair, said Rodriguez was one of the few
thrill-seekers too intimidated by heights to make the 85-foot free
fall.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people that go up there, they want to do it," site manager
Roby Myles said. "If they're not sure, we do our best to talk them
through it."</TE>
<TE>   The attraction's popularity was one of the reasons this year's
fair set attendance records, fair officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Through the first 16 days of the 17-day fair in Costa Mesa,
attendance was 820,577, about 33,000 ahead of last year's 16-day
gate. Total attendance will be released this week.</TE>
<TE>   Another success factor was a music concert series that featured
classic rock bands from the '60s and '70s, including Lynyrd Skynyrd
and Boz Scaggs. In nine of 17 concerts, all 2,000 reserved seats were
sold out before the fair opened.</TE>
<TE>   The rodeo, the demolition derby and the comedy shows also were big
draws for the fair, which ended Sunday after bringing in another huge
weekend crowd.</TE>
<TE>   And the reasonable admission prices didn't hurt: $7 for adults and
$3 for children 6 to 12.</TE>
<TE>   "I think, in Southern California, people are wanting to get out
and celebrate, feel good and be with other people in a community
celebration," said Becky Bailey-Findley, fair director. "We offer a
lot of value for your dollar. There is a lot of free things to do
once you get in here."</TE>
<TE>   Brandon Yee of Monterey Park, age 19 months, came to the final day
of the fair looking for a little less excitement than Adrenaline
Drop. He came to the petting zoo and cuddled with a llama and a few
sheep.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the books we're reading are all about zoos and animals,"
said Brandon's mother, Amanda Lin. "This gives him a good opportunity
to see what they're really like in person. He just loves taking it
all in."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy Sramek, 31, of Huntington Beach waited until the last day
because she was busy planning her wedding. "I come every year for the
[roasted] corn on the cob and the fried zucchini," she said. "I
wasn't about to miss it."</TE>
<TE>   Sramek wasn't the only one who came for the corn. A fair
representative said more than 104,000 ears were consumed, making it
one of the top-selling food items.</TE>

<HD>Chatsworth's Last Stand</HD>
<DH>Residents Opposed to Deerlake Ranch Project Join Forces to
Save What's Left of Old West Lifestyle</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some in semirural Chatsworth see time running out.</LD>
<LD>   After deferring a decision three times, the Los Angeles County
Regional Planning Commission will meet Aug. 21 to decide if Presidio
Chatsworth Partners will get to build Deerlake Ranch, a development
of more than 400 upscale homes on a wild, unincorporated swath north
of the 118 Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   For almost a year, concerned residents have argued that the
project would destroy the Old West character of the area and
overwhelm local schools, police and other city services to the south
of the project. But with the Planning Commission's decision only
weeks away, opponents have geared up for a last-ditch effort to
dramatically reduce the project, if not derail it.</LD>
<TE>   Activist Anna Rapagna Cox said the fate of Deerlake Ranch will
probably determine the area's future.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the beginning of the rest of the building in these
mountains," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, groups opposed to the development formed the
nonprofit Save Chatsworth Inc.</TE>
<TE>   According to its mission statement, the organization aims "to
ensure that all future housing development remains consistent with
the existing rural character and heritage of Chatsworth: We support
development that is family-oriented, low in density,
equestrian-friendly and environmentally sensitive."</TE>
<TE>   Cox, the group's president, said her Chatsworth Homeowners
Alliance for Mountain Preservation and other anti-development
organizations hope to make all Chatsworth residents aware of the
effect the massive project could have on their way of life. She said
the new group hopes "to create a common cause."</TE>
<TE>   Cox, who trains animals for the entertainment industry, lives with
her husband in Twin Lakes, a tiny community on Deerlake Highlands
closest to the 230-acre planned development.</TE>
<TE>   The developer has proposed scaling back the project from 484 to
424 homes, including 30 on large lots where horses could be kept. But
even with a reduction, Cox said, the development will threaten a
local breeding pair of mountain lions and other wildlife, and, she
fears, turn the area into a densely developed Porter Ranch South.</TE>
<TE>   "Porter Ranch is coming over the hills," she said. "I can see it
from my deck.... It's just a flattened hill. It's disgusting. I just
can't imagine more of that."</TE>
<TE>   The new group has several hundred members, Cox said, and plans to
go door-to-door in Chatsworth to inform residents about increased
traffic and other negative effects that opponents believe the
development will have.</TE>
<TE>   Save Chatsworth has raised almost half of the $15,000 it needs to
pay its environmental consultants and has hired land-use attorney
Philip Hess of Los Angeles, Cox said.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter last week to the Regional Planning Department, Hess
argued that a revised environmental impact document for the project,
released earlier this month, requires a 45-day period for public
comment, more than the 30 days scheduled.</TE>
<TE>   The planning department was closed Friday, and no one was
available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry England, an equestrian activist who rides in the highlands
almost every day, is one of the most vocal members of the new group.
Long before its formation, he had been using his computer to get out
the message that old Chatsworth is precious and endangered.</TE>
<TE>   "What is truly unique about Chatsworth is that, while it is in the
city of Los Angeles, it has a rural, almost sleepy, small-town
feeling about it," England said. "It is steeped in Western history.
It's the home of the original stagecoach trail between the San
Fernando and Ventura missions, its rocky scenery is the backdrop to
thousands of Western movies and it's home to a huge equestrian
population."</TE>
<TE>   England, who puts the area's equine population at about 700,
added: "We don't have a shopping mall, a college or even a hospital.
We do have a cowboy bar, two feed stores, one silversmith who also
repairs saddles, and dozens of horse-boarding facilities--and that's
just the way most of us residents want it to remain."</TE>
<TE>   Marty Woll, a retired certified public accountant who has helped
the new group back its position with numbers, said he and his wife
don't keep horses, "but we enjoy having them around. It's part of the
attraction of the area."</TE>
<TE>   Woll said he is especially concerned about the strain on city
services that the development could cause.</TE>
<TE>   "There are many more people affected south of the freeway than
north of the freeway," he said. The project's size worries him, even
if it's slightly reduced. "That density loads our schools, our
streets, without any significant mitigation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Woll has recalculated the projected traffic that the development
could generate, using numbers that reflect Los Angeles' known heavy
reliance on cars rather than national averages. As a result, he said,
"I think, easily, we could be looking at 6,000 vehicle [trips] a
day," instead of the 4,000-per-day figure the developer has used.</TE>
<TE>   Woll is particularly concerned about what increased traffic would
do to Canoga Avenue, now "a little two-lane street" used by almost
everyone seeking access to the canyons of Deerlake Highlands,
including hikers, riders and their horses, and artists with
sketchbooks in hand.</TE>

<CX>   Chatsworth development--In some editions July 29, a story in the
California section on opposition to the Deerlake Ranch development in
Chatsworth omitted comments from Hans Giraud, a consultant to the
developer. Giraud said that the developer's figures on how much
traffic the project would cause had been vetted by the Los Angeles
Department of Transportation, Caltrans and the Los Angeles County
Department of Public Works. He added that "we've met every legal and
technical criterion put before us."</CX>

<HD>Davis Lays Claim to School Success</HD>
<DH>Conference: He speaks to thousands of Urban League
delegates. Group's leader calls progress 'incremental.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Addressing a conference of civil rights leaders, Gov. Gray Davis said
his educational programs have helped provide opportunities for "every
deserving child."</LD>
<LD>   In his brief speech before thousands of delegates at the National
Urban League's annual conference in Los Angeles, Davis claimed
improved test scores and rising minority enrollment rates at colleges
as successes during his tenure as governor.</LD>
<LD>   Davis said he was committed to doing what he could to offer "hope
and opportunity for each child."</LD>
<TE>   The governor's comments were greeted by polite applause from
league members at the Los Angeles Convention Center. The league is
one of the nation's largest and most influential civil rights
organizations.</TE>
<TE>   The league president, Hugh B. Price, while not addressing Davis'
comments directly during his keynote speech, said that urban schools
across the nation remain troubled.</TE>
<TE>   "The progress being made remains incremental at best. Inner-city
children are trapped between lofty academic standards and
low-performing schools," Price said.</TE>
<TE>   Price criticized a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision that allows
public money to be spent on school vouchers for parents who send
their children to private schools.</TE>
<TE>   With Davis clapping in support, Price said that vouchers foster an
"illusion of choice," and that a voucher system would leave urban
students behind.</TE>
<TE>   "That is why the National Urban League staunchly defends public
schools against all the rabidly conservative wolves dressed in
sheep's clothing that come bearing tantalizing gifts like vouchers,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Price touched on numerous national and global issues, calling on
President Bush and other leaders to fight the spread of AIDS and
reduce global warming.</TE>
<TE>   He also criticized excessive penalties for some repeat criminals,
citing California's three-strikes law as the "worst example of
egregious excess."</TE>
<TE>   Though he spared Davis criticism, saying the governor had
inherited the problem, Davis has long supported the law, which sends
three-time felons to prison for 25-year-to-life sentences.</TE>

<HD>Ventura County Strawberry Growers Pick Up the Pace</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County strawberry growers reaped a record harvest this year,
as good weather and an expanded number of plantings combined to fuel
production.</LD>
<LD>   County growers had pumped out 26.6 million trays of berries by the
end of last week. That compares with 21.4 million trays during the
same period last year and 23.4 million trays for all of 2001, the
previous record yield.</LD>
<LD>   Although the main harvest is all but over now, the bumper crop has
accounted for one-third of all strawberries picked statewide so far
this year.</LD>
<TE>   And while the value of those berries won't be known for months,
several growers said prices this season were as high as they have
been in years.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a spectacular strawberry year for anyone involved in the
industry in Ventura County," said Oxnard grower Christopher
Deardorff, who farms 200 acres of strawberries near Camarillo. "Not
only was production up, but prices were fabulous."</TE>
<TE>   Over the last decade, no area of the state has planted more new
strawberry acreage than Ventura County. It remains California's
second-largest strawberry-producing region behind the
Watsonville/Salinas area, according to the California Strawberry
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   County growers had 8,582 acres in production this year, a 10%
increase over last year and double the acreage dedicated to
strawberries a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   The added acreage accounts in part for the boost in production,
growers say. However, farmers say they benefited this year from an
extremely cold winter followed by a cool, dry spring. The cold
temperatures held back early-season production, prompting the harvest
to explode in the spring and early summer.</TE>
<TE>   Agricultural officials say that kind of success has made Ventura
County a desirable place for strawberry growers to set up operations.
And it has firmly placed strawberries among the top cash crops in the
county's $1-billion agricultural industry.</TE>
<TE>   The crop was valued at $186 million in 2000, second only to
lemons.</TE>
<TE>   "The market has been awfully good for strawberry growers," said
county Agricultural Commissioner Earl McPhail. "When you look at the
crop report, the total dollar value keeps going up every year."</TE>

with another man, authorities said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   About 9 p.m. Friday, the gunman entered an area inside the gas
station where the 59-year-old attendant was working, said Police Lt.
Quinn Fenwick.</LD>
<LD>   After striking the man, the gunman and another male fled on foot
north on Kimball Road, Fenwick said. Officers searched the area near
the gas station in the 7800 block of Telephone Road but were unable

<LD>Oxnard police were searching Sunday afternoon for two men who
carjacked an employee of a pizza parlor as he walked to his car in
the restaurant's parking lot.</LD>
<LD>   Police Cmdr. Tom Chronister said the men, one with a black handgun
tucked in his waistband, confronted the employee and demanded his car
as he left the Toppers Pizza Place in the 2000 block of Oxnard

<LD>   The men headed east on Gonzales Road past Oxnard Boulevard in the
vehicle, described as a white Toyota Corolla. The gunman was
described as being 5 feet 9 with blond hair. He was between 30 and 35
and wore dark sunglasses, a black jacket, blue pants and a blue
baseball cap, Chronister said.</LD>

<HD>Dad's Is Hot Spot After Tragedy</HD>
<DH>Business: New patrons flock to Poway bar since it gained
notoriety in the murder of 7-year- old Danielle van Dam.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>POWAY, Calif.</DL>
<LD>It's Friday night at Dad's Cafe and Steakhouse, and a rock 'n' roll
band called the Deadbeats is taking a break from belting out songs of
the Beatles and "Poway's own" Blink 182.</LD>
<LD>   Patrons wander outside the inviting establishment on the eastern
edge of Poway Road to smoke and make telephone calls on the front
patio.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm at Dad's," Jennifer Towles, 23, who sells cosmetics and lives
at the other end of the county, exclaims to an unseen friend. "Yes,
that Dad's!"</LD>
<TE>   That Dad's!</TE>
<TE>   Until early February, Dad's was known, if at all, mostly to
residents of this leafy, tidy suburb and surrounding neighborhoods,
like the upscale Sabre Springs.</TE>
<TE>   A family restaurant. Good place to take the wife on her birthday.
A happy-hour kind of place--lots of televisions, always turned to
sports channels.</TE>
<TE>   Some dancing on Friday and Saturday nights for the professional
and blue-collar set to rub elbows and hipbones.</TE>
<TE>   Now, because of its link to the tragedy of Danielle van Dam, the
7-year-old whose disappearance and murder horrified and riveted much
of the nation, Dad's is the best-known drinking and dining
establishment in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Business is up, even in the summer doldrums. Tourists and
looky-loos are bypassing more conveniently located spots in Pacific
Beach, the downtown Gaslamp Quarter and Mission Valley to make the
drive north, 20 miles from downtown San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   They come to see where Danielle van Dam's mother, Brenda, went
dancing and drinking that Friday night before her daughter
disappeared from the family's Sabre Springs home.</TE>
<TE>   They look at the bar-stool once occupied by David Westerfield, now
on trial for Danielle's kidnapping and murder.</TE>
<TE>   And they look at the dance floor where, if you believe defense
attorney Steven Feldman, Brenda van Dam and her friends cavorted like
sexual whirling dervishes. In the parking lot, they can see where
Brenda van Dam, two girlfriends and two male buddies sat in a truck
and smoked marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   "This is where it all happened," said Jim Martin, a computer
technician who generally goes "clubbing" in Pacific Beach but could
not resist the lure of Dad's.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Lipe, Dad's co-owner and manager, is a mass of conflicting
emotions about the expanding clientele brought by the notoriety.</TE>
<TE>   As a father, he's sickened by the crime. As someone who knew
Westerfield as a casual customer, he's perplexed at how an
average-looking joe could have done what the prosecutors allege.</TE>
<TE>   But as a businessman ...</TE>
<TE>   "This is the best business opportunity any restaurant owner ever
had, but for all the wrong reasons," Lipe said. "A little girl is
dead, and I can't forget that."</TE>
<TE>   Lipe, whose formative restaurant experience came as district
manager for the Soup Exchange chain, bought Dad's two years ago with
the idea of opening up several more Dad's in suburban locations. That
idea is now on hold, for fear he would be accused of trying to
capitalize on Danielle's death.</TE>
<TE>   To the new customers lured to Dad's by the television coverage of
the trial--which has included pictures and diagrams of Dad's, and
testimony by employees and customers--Lipe tries to be accommodating.
He will point out the stool where Westerfield sat, but he has a
disclaimer too.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a pickup bar or a place for swingers," Lipe protested
above the chatter. "This is a family restaurant where, on Friday and
Saturday nights, we have music and dancing."</TE>
<TE>   Dad's new notoriety has also had a downside. Parents of a local
Little League team canceled plans to use Dad's for a team outing. A
local company decided against Dad's for its happy-hour gathering.
Lipe hired a security guard to patrol the parking lot. Some Dad's
regulars grumble that they no longer feel comfortable in the crush of
newcomers.</TE>
<TE>   Festive and comfy perhaps, but it would be a stretch to call Dad's
trendy or hip. Places with walls covered with album covers from the
Doors and Jefferson Airplane do not qualify as trendy or hip.</TE>
<TE>   Dad's makes its money from family diners who sit in the
red-plastic wraparound booths and enjoy the ribs, fish and chips and
pitchers of domestic beer.</TE>
<TE>   For after-dining pleasure, there are two pinball machines, a
Foosball game, and a pool table (where Brenda van Dam, et al, played
pool while Westerfield watched from across the room). On this night,
an attractive woman is playing pool, watched by six men.</TE>
<TE>   This is an affluent area, and the Dad's parking lot is stocked
with Pathfinders, Suburbans, Yukons, Jeeps, a red Corvette, two BMWs
and a canary-yellow 1931 Model A with a '56 Chrysler engine.</TE>
<TE>   "This is Dad's--no place quite like it," said Andrew Moe, who
identified himself as a consultant who specializes in nonlinear
mathematics.</TE>

<HD>Some Cal State Branch Students Feel Abandoned</HD>
<DH>Ventura County: They say courses are shrinking and emphasis
is now on enrollees in new Cal State Channel Islands.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA BLANCHARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Ventura County prepares to celebrate the opening of a long-awaited
Cal State University campus, a handful of students at the county's
branch campus of Cal State Northridge say they are being forgotten.</LD>
<LD>   After providing the impetus from which the new four-year campus
could grow, those students say they face shrinking courses and a lack
of academic guidance.</LD>
<LD>   Now, they are concerned about graduating on time. Liberal studies
majors seem particularly hard-hit and fear the problems could hurt
their ability to earn their teaching credentials. "To me, this is
ridiculous ... it's like a slap in the face," said Maddie Valenzuela,
a 21-year-old liberal studies major who is scheduled to graduate from
Cal State Northridge in spring 2003.</LD>
<TE>   She worries that she won't be able to take the required courses
when she needs them, potentially delaying her graduation and entry
into a teacher credential program.</TE>
<TE>   Even more frustrating, she feels college administrators are more
focused on smoothing the way for students in Cal State Channel
Islands' first class this fall than on helping existing Cal State
Northridge students graduate on time.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like they needed students there so they could get
university status, and now that they have their status, they don't
need us," Valenzuela said. "I'm really disappointed in how they
treated us."</TE>
<TE>   University officials acknowledge that some students might have a
bumpy transition as the two schools coexist on the Channel Islands
campus until the Northridge branch phases out by 2006.</TE>
<TE>   With 1,900 full- and part-time students, the local Cal State
Northridge branch is the largest off-campus center in the Cal State
system.</TE>
<TE>   It is unknown how many students are experiencing similar
difficulties, but Steve Lefevre, director of the satellite campus at
Channel Islands, said he has spoken with about a dozen students who
were concerned about meeting the graduation requirements.</TE>
<TE>   While he reassures them that the school is committed to helping
them graduate in a timely fashion, he said the transition between the
two schools may not be smooth for everyone. "We want to be good with
our commitment to students," he said. "But I can't say [the
transition] will be perfect.... It's a little bit of an experiment."</TE>
<TE>   The conflict stems from Cal State Northridge's plan to slowly
phase out its major programs to make way for similar Cal State
Channel Islands programs.</TE>
<TE>   The branch campus is limiting the number of courses it offers in
certain majors as it attempts to reduce its overall enrollment in the
next few years. As a result, there are fewer weekend and evening
classes, which makes it difficult for some students who can't take
classes during the day.</TE>
<TE>   Lefevre said he empathizes with those students, but since there
are a dwindling number of students in the programs slated to be
phased out, there won't be as many sections of certain courses as
there have been in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Students have the option of transferring from Northridge to
Channel Islands, but there is no guarantee the degree requirements
will be the same. But college administrators have pledged to work
with students to make sure they can graduate with a Cal State
Northridge degree.</TE>
<TE>   "Some students are on a slower track. And we can't guarantee we
will have every class they need seven years down the road," said Sue
Saunders of the Channel Islands advisement center. "But we want to be
flexible and want the transition to be seamless for students."</TE>
<TE>   Northridge students who are having difficulty planning their
course schedules have other options, she said. They can take
independent study or distance learning courses through Cal State
Northridge or could work with advisors to see if they can take a
comparable course through Channel Islands. Or, in what several
students viewed as a last resort, they could commute to the main
Northridge campus to take their final upper-division courses.</TE>
<TE>   None of those options has been convenient for 30-year-old
Stephanie Grabow. The liberal studies major wants to graduate as soon
as possible, to more quickly realize her dream of becoming an
elementary school teacher.</TE>
<TE>   But before she can begin teaching, she must graduate from a
teacher credential program. She considered Channel Islands' program
but was frustrated, she said, by not being able to get advisors to
clearly state the program's entry requirements. Finally, last spring,
she learned she would have to take four more courses to be accepted
into the Channel Islands program.</TE>
<TE>   The extra courses amounted to about half a year of work, further
delaying when Grabow could receive her teaching credential.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, that would mean a six-year degree," Grabow said. "And I
want to start teaching now."</TE>
<TE>   That sentiment is shared by fellow liberal studies major Melissa
Lim, who is scheduled to graduate in December. Lim said her
experience at Cal State Northridge has been positive.</TE>
<TE>   She has had solid help with advising. And until this fall term,
she has been able to take all her classes at the Camarillo branch
campus. Her only complaint has been that Channel Islands'
requirements for entering its teacher credential program are
confusing.</TE>
<TE>   As of the end of spring term, "nobody knew what the credentialing
program would entail, what the requirements would be," she said. "I
think we've all gotten tired of waiting for them to figure it out.
It's just easier to go somewhere else."</TE>
<TE>   Lim plans to attend Azusa Pacific University after graduation. It
offers a teaching credential program in which students can earn their
credential and a master's degree in education in less than two years.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Valenzuela hasn't gotten that far. She is working and
took summer courses at the Northridge main campus and Channel Islands
campuses. This fall, she plans to take two online courses, as well as
two evening classes at the Northridge campus.</TE>
<TE>   While she resents having to make the commute, she said she doesn't
have any other options.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to get done," she said.</TE>

<HD>Orange County's 'Great Park' Comes With a Great Price Tag</HD>
<DH>El Toro: City will need hundreds of millions to add
'jewelry' to lawn. Critics say cost will force massive development.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Talk about an eyesore. Years of neglect have turned the El Toro
Marine base into a bunch of shabby buildings atop an ocean of cracked
asphalt, weeds and dead grass.</LD>
<LD>   But Irvine officials look at this blight and see a lush park with
thousands of trees, rolling meadows and a vibrant museum district--a
vision they promise to fulfill without raising city taxes a dime.</LD>
<LD>   Their plan: Substitute a tax hike with a lot of creativity and a
lot of charity.</LD>
<TE>   Critics say they are dreaming.</TE>
<TE>   Some crafty maneuvering will allow the city to at least get
started. An asphalt recycler will tear out the base's runways for
free so it can then crush the concrete and sell it. Flexible
government bond financing will allow the city to start putting in
sewers and building roads.</TE>
<TE>   But creating the Great Park voters approved in March as an
alternative to a commercial airport is going to require major private
donations.</TE>
<TE>   Since the decade-long battle over whether to build an airport
ended, the city has been working with the Navy to find a way to
reimburse the federal government for the land and finance its
transformation into a park.</TE>
<TE>   City Will Start With Vast Expanse of Lawn</TE>
<TE>   A deal announced last week was lauded as the solution: The Navy
would sell the 4,738 acres to developers, who would then turn 84% of
the land back over to the park project. They would also have to put
money into a trust fund for park construction and maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   That will, indeed, pay for a park. Just not the "Great Park" that
Irvine pitched to voters. More like a vast expanse of lawn.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be a lot of fund-raising to add what we call 'jewelry'
to the park," said City Manager Allison Hart. The jewelry could be
anything from gardens, ponds and stone walkways to gymnasiums and
other community recreation buildings.</TE>
<TE>   These things are not cheap.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the recent Bryant Park project in midtown Manhattan: It
cost $13 million to build that seven-acre gem.</TE>
<TE>   Experts peg the more modestly landscaped El Toro project at closer
to $200,000 an acre--with an additional $50,000 or so an acre to
create a maintenance fund. Still, even park supporters acknowledge
that it adds up to many, many millions.</TE>
<TE>   That has led critics to charge that the park was just a ruse to
stop the airport, and that Irvine will be forced to allow massive
development on the property because it won't be able to afford to
hold onto it--much less build a park.</TE>
<TE>   They also question city assurances that the park is nearly clean
of hazardous materials, pointing to studies that suggest the Navy has
not investigated much of the site for toxic material that could cost
hundreds of millions of dollars to remove.</TE>
<TE>   "The only part of this plan that will become a reality is the
massive development," contends the Airport Working Group of Orange
County, a coalition that has lobbied for an airport.</TE>
<TE>   Yet those involved in designing urban parks elsewhere say there's
nothing outlandish about the city's plan.</TE>
<TE>   Designers of Other Parks Say Idea Is Solid</TE>
<TE>   "There is no reason they cannot pay for this park completely with
private money," said Dan Biederman, who runs the management company
for Bryant Park in New York City. "Irvine offers a climate that is
favorable to free enterprise and is full of a lot of innovative
people and businesses."</TE>
<TE>   The city needs only to scrape together enough to build a quarter
of the 4,000-acre park. The rest--including the golf courses,
university campus and federal wildlife corridor--will be built and
managed by others.</TE>
<TE>   But that quarter is the heart of the proposed park: the 1,000
acres now occupied by the runways. It's those planned meadows,
playing fields, and a cultural complex for museums and libraries that
Irvine must figure out how to finance.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next few months, city officials will estimate those
costs, and determine how much should be funded by developers who will
bid to build 3,400 homes and 2.9 million square feet of retail space
on parcels at the park's perimeter.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of developers are eager for those details," said Christine
Diemer Iger, a lobbyist and past president of the Building Industry
Assn. of Orange County. "They want to put the numbers into their
spreadsheets and see how they can make this pencil out."</TE>
<TE>   Complicating the financials is the fact that the money coming from
the developers may take years to appear. Usually cities get funds
from such deals in increments as homes are built. So some say Mayor
Larry Agran's promises that 50 to 100 soccer fields could be in place
within a few years, as well as thousands of saplings, are wishful
thinking.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually money to do those kinds of things trickles in based on
building permits or sales," said Steve Weston, a land-use attorney.
"That takes time."</TE>
<TE>   Others who have helped develop parks on closed military bases warn
of more potential problems. "You've got to ask the right questions
early on and not just get some funds and start building," said Gregg
Calpino, a landscape designer with SmithGroup in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   While working on converting an Illinois base into a park, his
company came across oozing petroleum where an aquatic nature
education center was supposed to go. The military initially refused
to clean it up, Calpino said, and it took six months of lobbying
Washington to get the job done.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine officials are studying all of this, as well as how to
create a conservancy trust fund modeled after the one for New York's
Central Park. That public-private partnership has generated $250
million for park programs, beautification and maintenance since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Central Park is surrounded by millionaires living in
prewar apartments who are eager to chip in to keep the place up.
Would that model transfer to suburban Orange County?</TE>
<TE>   Ken Ryan of the planning firm Edaw in Irvine believes it will.</TE>
<TE>   "Big central parks are back," said Ryan, whose firm has been
involved in finding private funds to build large parks in Atlanta and
Denver. "These kind of partnerships with private companies for public
projects have been attained many times in the past few years."</TE>

<DH>Justice: Images of teen's violent encounter with police
evoke troubling memories for residents. Many worry about what the
future holds</DH>

<AU>NORA ZAMICHOW</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jay Ahmad, an Inglewood barber, knows how to handle cops. He says
"sir" a lot. He explains he's a family man on his way home. "I know
what they want to hear," said Ahmad, 24.</LD>
<LD>   Ahmad has talked his way out of what's known on the streets as a
face burn--having his face slammed on a hot car hood. So the recent
videotape of Inglewood police beating a 16-year-old came as no
surprise. Maybe the only surprise was his anger.</LD>
<LD>   Ahmad is prepared to swallow the indignity of occasional rude
treatment by police. However, he is also a father who wants to
believe that years from now, the copper color of his son's skin will
not influence police.</LD>
<TE>   For one week, Inglewood captured the attention of the nation.
Today, the throngs of reporters have moved on. But for many people
such as Ahmad who live and work in the city of 130,000, the image of
a white police officer manhandling Donovan Jackson, who is black,
remains indelible.</TE>
<TE>   For many, too, the videotape of the incident became a Rorschach,
reflecting almost as much about the viewer as about the incident.</TE>
<TE>   Remembering the Riots</TE>
<TE>   When Tsering Thondup saw the video, he thought immediately of the
riots sparked after the acquittal of four police officers in the
beating of Rodney G. King.</TE>
<TE>   Thondup, who was born in Tibet, lives above his used book and
magazine shop in Inglewood. During the 1992 riots, he and other
merchants took to the rooftops armed with guns and scared off
would-be looters. His shop was not harmed.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as I saw the tape, it raised my hair," said Thondup, 52.
"It immediately brought back memories of the L.A. riot."</TE>
<TE>   Thondup was sickened to see how the boy was treated. And he became
anxious about how the case would unfold. On the tape, it seemed very
clear, he thought, that Jackson posed no threat.</TE>
<TE>   What if the officers were nonetheless acquitted? He sighed,
thinking over the question that he'd asked himself. He would, he
supposed, take to the rooftop again.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't live your life in fear," he said. "I learned from the
last riot. Life has to go on."</TE>
<TE>   As soon as the video of Jackson aired on national television,
Elizabeth Shapiro's daughter called from New York, pleading with her
mother to come visit. "You are the wrong color to live in Inglewood,"
Shapiro's daughter told her.</TE>
<TE>   "When we first moved to Inglewood, I was the wrong religion,"
quipped Shapiro, 86, who has lived in Inglewood for 54 years.</TE>
<TE>   Shapiro and her husband chose to move to Inglewood in 1948 because
of its school system. They didn't realize they would have a tough
time finding a real estate agent who would sell to a Jewish family.
They eventually purchased a three-bedroom house, built in 1926, that
Shapiro still lives in.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the city's population changed. In 1960, Inglewood
was 96% white. Two decades later, less than 5% of the city's
population was white. But Shapiro stayed.</TE>
<TE>   Shapiro had been attending medical school in Vienna when Hitler
invaded. Her father was taken to a prison camp in Auschwitz. She'd
been the last of her family to reach the United States, arriving on a
banana boat in a convoy of ships dodging bombs.</TE>
<TE>   She pooh-poohed her daughter's words of caution. Sure, her shop
had been looted and burned down once. Sure, she'd been mugged once.
But Inglewood was home.</TE>
<TE>   And in the days since the videotape of Jackson aired, Shapiro has
continued her usual 1 1/2-mile walk to her knitting shop. One recent
afternoon, Shapiro presided over a group of five regulars, black
women whose ages ranged from 65 to 82. The women knit, sitting for
hours around a metal table, drawn by Shapiro's expertise and the
companionship of women who know each other well enough to remember
names of grandchildren and great-grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Talk Turns to Video</TE>
<TE>   A degenerative eye disease has left Shapiro blind in one eye.
Squinting with her good eye, Shapiro worked her way around the table,
undoing snafus, ripping out problems. Until the talk turned to
Donovan Jackson, Shapiro was constantly in motion. As the knitters
began discussing the case, Shapiro halted.</TE>
<TE>   "I was revolted," she said. "It was inhuman. They picked him up
like a rag doll."</TE>
<TE>   Heads nodded. Needles clicked.</TE>
<TE>   "I could have picked him up better than that and held him until he
calmed down," said Connie Campbell, a retired airport security guard.
"They were big, strong men; he was just a little, skinny boy."</TE>
<TE>   Nickelena Smith, 80, looked up from the beige shell she was
knitting.</TE>
<TE>   "That's abuse," sighed Smith, a retired airport custodian who has
13 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Heads nodded. Needles clicked. Shapiro reminded the knitters that
the officer seen on tape punching Jackson had alleged that the teen
grabbed his testicles. Shapiro was skeptical of the claim.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell harrumphed. When her son, now an adult, was a teenager,
he'd been beaten by police in Hawthorne, she said. When she saw the
video of Jackson, she couldn't help but think of her own boy.</TE>
<TE>   "That boy didn't grab nothing," said Campbell. "If you've got five
police officers, whether that boy was resisting arrest or not, those
men could have picked him up and put him in the car."</TE>
<TE>   Across town, Ahmad shaved and clipped a young man's head, giving
him a close-cropped haircut that he calls a shadow-fade.</TE>
<TE>   Ahmad talked about what happened to Donovan Jackson with a
measured tone while his scissors flashed.</TE>
<TE>   "The boy was in handcuffs; you can't beat him up because he made
you mad," said Ahmad. "That's vengeance."</TE>
<TE>   But Ahmad hopes for a just resolution.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a black mayor and a black police chief," said Ahmad,
"that could have been their son."</TE>

<HD>Simon Advisers Hope Worst Is Behind Them</HD>
<DH>Politics: After rough weeks during which Republican
candidate's finances came into question, aides hope to get back to
election.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>As the gubernatorial campaign of Republican Bill Simon Jr. presses
through its roughest patch, aides to the candidate say they are
exhausted but relieved, and hopeful that they have now put the worst
behind them.</LD>
<LD>   "The past two weeks was a trial by fire, and two things happen
when you go through a trial by fire," said Sean Walsh, a GOP
communications strategist advising the campaign. "One, you get
stronger. And two, you get wiser."</LD>
<LD>   That fire has been intense for the Simon camp in recent days: His
top campaign leadership was reshuffled for the fourth time; national
Republican leaders came to town to take measure of his organization;
and he resisted releasing his tax returns, then relented, only to
face withering criticism for the way he handled the disclosure.</LD>
<TE>   Internally, the campaign also has been riven by dissension and
burdened by a staff that is nearly twice the size of Gov. Gray Davis'
reelection team.</TE>
<TE>   All of that put Simon's campaign staff through enormous strain,
aides said, as they have shifted jobs and adjusted to new bosses even
as they are trying to plot out a strategy for the fall.</TE>
<TE>   Still, many members of Simon's campaign team said they felt
optimistic as they ended the week, confident that their candidate has
shown he has paid his fair share of taxes. And although they are
bracing for a barrage of aggressive television commercials from Davis
on the subject, the Republican candidate's top advisors say their
organization has been strengthened by the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "You kind of bear down and bore right through the story and take
your hits," said a top aide who did not want to be named. "OK, we got
whacked. But it won't be long before Gray Davis is taking his hits."</TE>
<TE>   If the mood inside Simon's camp is one of tired relief, however,
outside of the organization, many top political
observers--Republicans as well as Democrats--say the campaign still
needs to demonstrate command over the race.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they clearly need to get back on offense," said
Republican consultant Kevin Spillane, who was political director for
Richard Riordan's gubernatorial bid. "They've been thrown off
stride."</TE>
<TE>   Campaign insiders acknowledge that in the last week, especially,
they have been on the defensive. The staff worked 14-hour days
fielding questions about Simon's finances, even as they tried to plot
out a strategy to expand their candidate's appeal over the next few
months.</TE>
<TE>   "It was kind of like bad medicine we had to take," said one member
of the campaign team.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking to put the best face on recent events, many Simon aides
argue that the pressure actually served a valuable purpose, forcing
the team to confront internal divisions that have flared publicly
throughout the summer. The Republican National Committee meeting in
San Francisco in mid-July, when GOP leaders came to question campaign
officials about their direction, was viewed with much trepidation
internally, several said. A general sense of relief set in once the
meetings were over, and Rob Lapsley, the newest campaign manager, was
put into place.</TE>
<TE>   "After the RNC, everyone was tired of fighting," an aide said.</TE>
<TE>   At times, the pressure of the last few weeks appeared to wipe the
grin off Simon's face as well. He snapped at reporters who questioned
his rules for reviewing his tax returns and tried time and again to
brush off questions on that subject.</TE>
<TE>   By week's end, however, he was attempting to buoy supporters and
staff.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel good," Simon told supporters Thursday during a campaign
stop in Stockton, where he faced his fourth deluge of tax return
questions. "We're having a good week, and it's going to get even
better."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Simon kept smiling during a visit to a Chevron
mini-mart in Oakland, where two dozen protesters chanting, "Pay your
taxes!" greeted him from the sidewalk as he pulled up in a dark SUV.</TE>
<TE>   As eight uniformed police officers held back the shouting
demonstrators, Simon made it through his stump speech, speaking over
catcalls and chants of "Shame on you, simple Simon." A small knot of
supporters tried to drown out his detractors by yelling, "We love
you, Bill!"</TE>
<TE>   One of the candidate's tactics for facing questions on his
personal finances last week was to show a new toughness and anger
toward Davis--a striking contrast to the gentle, soft-spoken manner
that Simon has typically displayed on the stump.</TE>
<TE>   On the John &amp; Ken radio call-in show Friday on KFI-AM in Los
Angeles, Simon adopted the tone of voice of a man who has grabbed a
rival by the collar.</TE>
<TE>   "Gray Davis is in big trouble," he said. "I'm going to beat him on
Nov. 5. You watch. People underestimated me in the primary too. They
make a big mistake when they underestimate Bill Simon."</TE>
<TE>   For a campaign team that surprised even itself by defeating
Riordan in the primary, the new optimism is grounded in part on the
notion that Simon has begun to solidify his standing with his
conservative base and can now begin to pivot to the middle. In the
weeks ahead, for example, Simon plans to visit urban poor areas and
focus more noticeably on family issues.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, however, Simon complicated his effort to soften
his conservative edge by repeatedly criticizing Davis last week for
signing a bill that makes California the first state to fight global
warming by cutting tailpipe emissions that could play a role in
heating up the Earth.</TE>
<TE>   "This is feel-good legislation," he said on KFI--one of Simon's
four appearances last week on conservative radio talk shows. "It's a
photo-op for Davis because he's a desperate man."</TE>
<TE>   As the Simon campaign tries to shrug off recent events, some aides
insist they are unbowed--and prepared now to take on the incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody always thinks the campaign is on the brink of
something, and that's silly," said Sal Russo, Simon's campaign
consultant. "If there's one truism in politics, it's that what's true
today will not be true tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   And yet, even within that determination to move forward, advisors
to the candidate acknowledge that recent events have been trying.</TE>
<TE>   "Were they two weeks that I'd like to live over again?" Walsh
asked. "No. But they're behind us."</TE>

<HD>Probe Into PUC Contracts Sought</HD>
<DH>Utilities: Minority- and veteran-owned firms claim they
were excluded from $100 million worth of energy conservation outreach
work.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM REITERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Four small-business organizations have called for a state
investigation into how utility regulators awarded more than $100
million in contracts for local outreach programs to encourage energy
conservation.</LD>
<LD>   Statewide groups representing disabled veterans and minority-owned
companies alleged last week that the California Public Utilities
Commission had engaged in "disturbing and potentially illegal"
contracting practices that had prevented their members from vying for
the contracts. They said their organizations had never been notified
and that the bidding procedures had been flawed.</LD>
<LD>   This summer the PUC awarded almost 100 contracts to promote use of
fluorescent lightbulbs, energy-efficient appliances and better
insulation in homes and businesses. The program, along with others,
is funded though a public service charge on each customer's utility
bill.</LD>
<TE>   The PUC took the contract awards out of the hands of the utilities
in an effort to foster more innovative and effective methods of
encouraging conservation as the state seeks to avert another energy
crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The program funds everything from education to energy-efficiency
installations. But it has stirred controversy--first over the
selection of an Oregon subsidiary of Enron for a $3.3-million
contract in Bakersfield, then over whether any contracts should go to
out-of-state companies.</TE>
<TE>   Now, some small-business groups are saying that they did not get a
fair shot at the money.</TE>
<TE>   In a July 22 letter to Clothilde Hewlett, interim director of the
Department of General Services, they alleged that the PUC did not
follow state contracting law in the bid process, did not reach out to
small businesses and did not engage in competitive bidding.</TE>
<TE>   PUC officials defended the bidding as fair and said state
contracting rules did not apply to the contracts because the money
came from ratepayers, not the state treasury. They also noted that
the contracts are between the utilities and the companies and that
the PUC merely selects the contractors.</TE>
<TE>   Aubry Stone, president of the California Black Chamber of
Commerce, said, "I am sure they are trying to find a technicality
somewhere.... Is the PUC a state agency, or are they accountable to
no one?"</TE>
<TE>   Paul Clanon, head of the PUC's energy division, said that about
10% of the money had gone to businesses owned by women or members of
minority groups and that the bidding had been so well publicized that
about 250 people had applied.</TE>
<TE>   The Black Chamber of Commerce, California Disabled Veterans
Alliance, California American Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and
Council on Asian Business Assn. voiced the protest to General
Services, which oversees most state contracting.</TE>
<TE>   Stone said the groups expect the agency to serve aggressively as a
watchdog in the contracting dispute, especially since the recent
legislative hearings into the Davis administration's award of a
much-criticized computer contract to Oracle Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "They will be sensitive to how the PUC went out with this, whether
or not it is public money or private money," he said.</TE>
<TE>   General Services officials said they were studying whether the
energy conservation contracts approved by the PUC fall under the
state contracting code. "These complaints are under review," said
spokesman Ken Hunt. "Whether they are valid or not, we will have to
see."</TE>
<TE>   After a San Francisco Chronicle columnist reported that a
subsidiary of Enron's Portland General Electric had won a
$3.3-million contract, the commission voted in June to eliminate the
award on grounds that Enron was in bankruptcy and was under
investigation for alleged misconduct during the energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Over the dissent of PUC President Loretta M. Lynch, the panel
decided not to strip the contract awards from other out-of-state
companies.</TE>
<TE>   Some commissioners argued it would be unfair and illegal to
discriminate against non-California companies.</TE>
<TE>   Clanon of the PUC said that the out-of-state awards represented
about $11 million. "That gives the lie to the notion that we are not
reaching out," he said. "We're reaching out so much, we got in
trouble for it."</TE>
<TE>   Kevin O'Connor, president of the California Disabled Veterans
Alliance, said he believes the PUC awards violated a section of the
state contracts code that requires outreach efforts to attain a 3%
goal for participation by businesses owned by disabled veterans.</TE>
<TE>   "Things like this go on all the time, but this $100 million is a
nice big amount," he said.</TE>

<HD>3 Firefighters Are Killed in Crash of U.S. Forest Service
Vehicle</HD>

<DL>HAPPY CAMP, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Three firefighters were killed and two others injured early Sunday
when a U.S. Forest Service fire engine patrolling the perimeter of a
wildfire in the Klamath National Forest drove off a logging road and
rolled 800 feet down a mountainside.</LD>
<LD>   The engine crew based on the Lassen National Forest in Susanville
was helping to watch over a 500-acre backfire set during the night to
help contain the 1,350-acre Stanza Fire, which was burning 10 miles
south of Happy Camp, when one wheel went off the narrow gravel road
at about 1:30 a.m. and the truck plunged down the steep slope, said
Forest Service incident commander Howard Carlson.</LD>
<LD>   "It was going straight down the road on patrol" when it went off
the road, Carlson said.</LD>
<TE>   The green crew-cab pickup equipped with a 500-gallon water tank,
came to rest on its top in an old clearcut, where a Forest Service
firefighting crew out of Kentucky, who witnessed the crash, and
hotshot crews from the Plumas and Eldorado national forests were able
to reach the survivors.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the fire raging near California's giant sequoias in
Kernville grew by 1,500 acres Sunday, but the ancient trees seemed to
be largely out of trouble, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters on the ground and in the air continued to work on the
western edge of the blaze to protect 11 groves of sequoias, some of
the world's oldest and largest trees.</TE>
<TE>   The sequoias aren't completely safe, but firefighters have
minimized the threat, said fire information officer Jill Slater. The
66,000-acre wildfire was 30% contained Sunday evening, she said.</TE>
<TE>   A Bakersfield woman is accused of igniting the Kernville fire
about 130 miles north of Los Angeles while cooking hot dogs over an
illegal campfire. Peri Van Brunt, 45, was arraigned Friday in U.S.
District Court in Fresno, but entered no plea. She remains in
custody.</TE>
<TE>   That fire has consumed more than 90 square miles. Firefighters
were building more than 80 miles of firebreaks to contain it.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of the fire has climbed to an estimated $9.1 million as
close to 2,278 firefighters worked in shifts around the clock to
build fire lines and douse flames.</TE>
<TE>   About half the fire was within the 327,769-acre Giant Sequoia
National Monument, within Sequoia National Forest. It has burned
within a mile of the Packsaddle Grove, and within two miles of the
Trail of 100 Giants.</TE>
<TE>   The nighttime weather, which was cool and humid, has favored the
firefighters' efforts, although it's still windy in the daytime,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Higher humidity and softer winds the last few days were a change
from the conditions that sent the fire raging out of control its
first few days, said U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Sue Exline.</TE>

<HD>Familiar Ring on TV</HD>
<DH>BellSouth's William Pate is overseeing a timely telecom ad
campaign</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The black-and-white images on the television screen are of vintage
telephones, linemen dressed in early 20th century work clothes and
operators in front of massive old-fashioned switchboards.</LD>
<LD>   But this is not a documentary. It's a commercial for BellSouth
Corp. that has been popping up regularly on national cable TV
outlets, even though the Atlanta-based Baby Bell serves only nine
Southeastern states.</LD>
<LD>   The company has been aggressive in using advertising to shore up
its image at a time when the record-setting bankruptcy filing of No.
2 long-distance provider WorldCom Inc. has further sullied the
already-troubled telecom sector.</LD>
<TE>   Although WorldCom is not mentioned in the commercial that began
appearing about two weeks after the Clinton, Miss.-based company
acknowledged it improperly accounted for $3.9 billion in routine
expenses, its presence is unmistakable.</TE>
<TE>   The soothing voice that accompanies the nostalgic images
emphasizes BellSouth's ability to play a leading role in business,
"even in times like these."</TE>
<TE>   SBC Communications Inc., AT&amp;T Corp. and Sprint Corp. also are
running ad campaigns in print and on TV designed in part as a
response to WorldCom's debacle. Officials at WorldCom and its MCI
unit declined to comment on how they might use advertising to
reassure their customers.</TE>
<TE>   The BellSouth ad campaign is being overseen by William Pate, who
was in charge of MCI's advertising from 1992 to 1996. Pate now is
vice president for advertising and public relations at BellSouth.</TE>
<TE>   The company can use all the goodwill it can muster. Last week,
BellSouth reported its second-quarter earnings were down by more than
half. On Friday, the stock rose 33 cents to $23.32 on the New York
Stock Exchange, far short of its 52-week high of $42.95.</TE>
<TE>   Question: Was this ad campaign launched in direct response to the
WorldCom accounting disaster?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Yes. There was a lot of attention focused on the telecom
industry, especially since [the WorldCom scandal] came not long after
troubles at Global Crossing Ltd. and other companies. We thought
there was a danger of everyone getting tarred with the same brush. It
was important to assure our customers and shareholders that BellSouth
had been here for a hundred years and we're going to be here the next
hundred.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Some telecoms put out ads that blatantly make a pitch for MCI
customers to switch over to them. Why haven't you done that?</TE>
<TE>   A: We're not a company that delights in the pain of others. That
being said, clearly in this environment when you have competitors in
a difficult position, there is opportunity there. Starting Monday
[today], we're going to take this ad campaign to the next stage,
where we will be offering new packages of all kinds of service.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You operate in only nine states. Why run your ads nationally?</TE>
<TE>   A: We are one of the most widely held stocks in the country, and I
think it's important to get our message out to our shareholders as
well as our customers.</TE>
<TE>   Q: In this high-tech age, why go with a nostalgia theme?</TE>
<TE>   A: A couple of years ago, the dot-coms were very hip and the
telephone companies were seen as stodgy and slow-moving. Then after
the Internet bubble burst, it was the dependable, reliable companies
that became cool. Reliability is back in style.</TE>
<TE>   Q: The ads have not helped you on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   A: An ad campaign is almost never going to markedly affect a
stock. The factors that move a stock are market conditions, earnings
and outlook. And as we have seen recently, psychological factors are
very important in the marketplace.</TE>
<TE>   Q: This seems like a very different kind of campaign than you
would have done at MCI. Does advertising play a different kind of
role at BellSouth than it did at MCI?</TE>
<TE>   A: In my prior life at MCI, I was right in the middle of the
long-distance wars. AT&amp;T would put on a commercial, and right away
we'd have one on in answer to that, and so on. Back then, MCI was the
renegade brand with only 10% or 12% share of the market. We had to
make sure people knew we were there and what we could do.</TE>
<TE>   When you have a heritage like we do at BellSouth, you don't need
to be dwelling on the situation of your competitors. You can sit
there and tell a good story yourself.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Was it more fun back then?</TE>
<TE>   A: There was a lot of criticism, probably rightfully so, that
after a while we had stopped talking to the customer and were just
talking to each other.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do you have some advice for your old company, MCI, about what
role advertising could play in trying to get the company back on its
feet?</TE>
<TE>   A: It's hard to speculate. There are so many factors. I think I
would have to leave it to them.</TE>
<TE>   Q: So I take it that you are not in the business of helping out a
competitor?</TE>
<TE>   A: That's true.</TE>
