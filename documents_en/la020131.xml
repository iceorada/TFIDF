<LD>I'm growing a beard. This is not a matter of great significance to
anyone but my wife and my dog, but it's what I did on my vacation.</LD>
<LD>   Growing a beard, like sleeping on the couch, doesn't require a
good deal of either physical effort or intellectual attention. One
just lies there for a sufficient amount of time and hair
automatically appears.</LD>
<LD>   I was on a working vacation, polishing a new book, and rarely left
the house, which meant that though getting up in the morning was a
necessity, shaving was not. I did, however, shower and change
underwear, a condition my wife requires if she is to remain married
to me.</LD>
<TE>   My beard is presently in the old-bum stage, meaning it is the
bristle often found on elderly winos sitting in doorways drinking
Night Train from a bottle in a paper bag.</TE>
<TE>   I wouldn't qualify as one because sipping a martini from a bag
wouldn't work, due to the awkward shape of the glass. Anyhow, not in
all my years have I ever seen an old bum drinking anything but red
wine, although once I did see one drinking cheap wine and reading the
Wall Street Journal. I was so impressed, I gave him a dollar.</TE>
<TE>   Before the old-bum stage, the growth down the side of my face and
around and under my chin was in the Brad Pitt stage, a slight facial
shadowing that young Hollywood males affect as a manifestation of
their manhood. I suspect that in many cases it's makeup and not hair,
but who am I to question anyone who makes $20 million a shot for
being able to read and smile?</TE>
<TE>   My wife likes the beard, although she has some hesitation about
comparing me to Brad Pitt. "I think," she says very diplomatically,
"he's a bit taller than you, dear."</TE>
<TE>   Our dog Barkley views me with suspicion. When he first noticed the
beard, he backed away, bared his teeth and barked furiously. He's an
English springer spaniel and smarter than most people, but sometimes
overly protective. Like Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, he is always on
guard, but not always sure who the enemy is, so he has a tendency to
bark at anyone whose identity he questions. This simultaneously makes
him (Barkley, not Ashcroft) a terrific watchdog and an utter
nuisance.</TE>
<TE>   One night about 3 a.m., he heard a woodpecker outside pecking away
and went to Condition Red. He ran through the house barking and
howling, a combination of noises equivalent to a thousand car alarms
going off at once.</TE>
<TE>   My idea of dog training is to scream and threaten in tones that
even a quadruped can understand, techniques I applied to Barkley when
I discovered why he was barking.</TE>
<TE>   "Stop hollering, for God's sake," my wife said. "He was just doing
his job!"</TE>
<TE>   "Barking at a werewolf is doing his job. Barking at O.J. Simpson
climbing in a window is doing his job. Barking at a woodpecker is
overdoing his job!"</TE>
<TE>   "Go back to bed," she said, "and sleep assured that no woodpecker
will harm you tonight. Good boy, Barkley."</TE>
<TE>   The growing of beards goes back to the time, probably in the early
Pleistocene, when man discovered that he had full control over the
hair on his face. This was no doubt after he discovered marriage and
became aware of the fact that he had control over very little else in
the cave but the hair on his face.</TE>
<TE>   The Encyclopaedia Britannica points out that the wearing of beards
has been a matter of controversy throughout history. For instance,
the ancient Romans considered beards to be the epitome of barbarism,
but Jews regarded them as symbols of virility.</TE>
<TE>   It was during this angry difference of opinion that Jesus emerged.
I'm not saying that he was put on Earth to determine the rectitude of
whiskers, but who knows? Various depictions show him both with and
without a beard. Perhaps, like many of us, he let it grow while on
vacation and shaved to perform his miracles.</TE>
<TE>   There are Internet Web sites devoted to beards. One favors us with
a link to "super" beards, i.e., facial hair that is pretty much out
of control. Among those pictured with such a massive beard is one Kai
Cofer, described as an actor living in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Kai's quest, according to the Web site, is to grow the longest
beard on record. Though that may not seem the most challenging of
ambitions, bear in mind that actors don't get a lot of work, and
growing a beard is something to do while lying on the couch watching
Buffy kick the hoo-hah out of neighborhood vampires.</TE>
<TE>   The Web page that really astounded me features women with beards.
"In the 21st century," a caption declares, "female facial hair will
be the ultimate of sexual seductiveness."</TE>
<TE>   Though that may be a turn-on to some truly peculiar men, I doubt
that it will ever achieve any degree of general popularity. To prove
how desirable a whiskered woman can be, the site features a
full-length, frontal photograph of one Poppy X with a Vandyke beard,
wearing only an open shirt. She is described as a television
producer, which, somehow, doesn't surprise me. I showed the picture
to Barkley. He went crazy barking and howling. I think he thought she
was a woodpecker.</TE>

<LD>Carol Channing returns home to Los Angeles to celebrate her 81st
birthday today after suffering a severe bout of food poisoning in New
York. The singer was rushed to the hospital Tuesday morning from ABC
studios, where she had been scheduled for an interview with Barbara
Walters on "The View."</LD>
<LD>   Channing was so sick when she arrived at ABC that producers called
an ambulance. By the time she reached Lennox Hill Hospital, she was
dangerously dehydrated and had to be fed intravenously. She remained
hospitalized Tuesday night and left the hospital Wednesday against
her doctor's recommendation, saying she was feeling better. "I guess
she knows herself better than her doctors," said her spokesman Harlan
Boll.</LD>
<LD>   It is unclear what caused Channing's illness. The performer
notoriously brings her own food to events, but on Monday night, she
joined members of the Theatre Guild of America at Sardi's restaurant
for a dinner party after the annual Theatre Hall of Fame ceremony at
the Gershwin Theatre. (She'd presented Isabelle Stevenson  a Lifetime
Achievement Award.) "I had dinner. It was delicious," event spokesman
Keith Sherman told us. "I heard of no one else who didn't feel well
the next day."</LD>
<TE>   In November, Channing suffered a fall while rehearsing for a
performance of "Tap Your Troubles Away" with Angela Lansbury at the
Luckman Fine Arts Center in Los Angeles. She tumbled down 27 stairs,
fractured her thumb, chipped her elbow and required stitches to her
forehead. But Channing refused to cancel the show. The next night,
Boll said, "she showed up with Harry Winston diamonds all over her
cast and still performed."</TE>
<TE>   Channing, who won fame on Broadway for her role in "Hello,
Dolly!," shows no signs of stopping. Next month, she is the headliner
at a charity event at San Francisco's Palace of Fine Arts Theatre.</TE>

<TE>   Provocative PR</TE>
<TE>   So we finally met Pat Kingsley's boss. But even he acknowledges
that super-publicist Kingsley, whose clients include Tom Cruise and
Drew Barrymore, "has no boss." Over lunch at the Art Deco restaurant
Cicada in downtown Los Angeles recently, Larry Weber--founder of
Weber Shandwick Worldwide, one of the world's largest public
relations firms, and a principal in the conglomerate that owns
Kingsley's PMK--wanted to talk shop. And to make shop talk easier, he
brought along publicist Howard Bragman and his vice president,
Rebecca Seel Oddsund.</TE>
<TE>   Weber was especially eager to muse about his just-published book
"The Provocateur" (Crown Business), which explains the concept at the
core of his profession: "how to influence behavior."</TE>
<TE>   "You have to have a good bedside manner," Weber said. Bragman cut
in: "I've always said that--your bedside manner is what you're
selling."</TE>
<TE>   Weber ate his pasta.</TE>
<TE>   "Branding is no longer about products," Weber pronounced.
"Although that's controversial with my Madison Avenue colleagues."
Rather, said the man for whom star power is currency, it's about
personalities--famous names. "What Bob Dole did for Viagra," added
Bragman.</TE>
<TE>   Because Hollywood has names in abundance, "L.A. is becoming one of
the most important places in the world for PR," said Weber, modestly
adding that his company "represents probably about 80%" of Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   In his book, Weber identifies two archetypal corporate leaders:
"the general" and "the provocateur." Apple's Steve Jobs is a
provocateur (Weber likes provocateurs).  Unlike the "command and
control" style that typifies the general, the provocateur has a
motivational style, as entertainer and educator.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Branson, of Virgin fame, is the uber-provocateur, Weber
said with reverence. "He made a brand and built a community."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Further Provocation</TE>
<TE>   Photographer-turned-director Dewey Nicks paced the red carpet in
front of the Galaxy Theater on Tuesday night at the premiere of his
first film, snapping photos and using phrases such as "nothing is
sacred" and "pushing it too far" to describe "Slackers." We suspect
he's referring to several outrageous scenes in the picture, including
one in which Jason Schwartzman's character gives a sponge bath to
bare-breasted Mamie Van Doren, best known as a 1950s bombshell, and
an autoerotic interlude featuring "That '70s Show" star Laura Prepon.</TE>
<TE>   Considering such scenes, it's unlikely that this "Slackers" will
ever be confused with Richard Linklater's 1991 cult classic
"Slacker." Nicks' film, which opens Friday, portrays an obsessed
outsider (Schwartzman) who blackmails three cheating college seniors
(Maronna, Devon Sawa and Jason Segel) into fixing him up with his
dream girl (James King). Cameron Diaz and Gina Gershon have cameos.
"Slackers" marks Schwartzman's first released picture since director
Wes Anderson's "Rushmore."</TE>
<TE>   Screenwriter David H. Steinberg, who also penned "American Pie 2,"
said he based the film on his own experience as a 16-year-old Yale
University freshman who "wound up not having much access to the
dating scene" and consequently spent a lot of time daydreaming.
Granted, he said, "the movie takes things a little bit further than
we did."</TE>

<LD>   A Cultural History of How an</LD>
<LD>   Exotic Plant Seduced Civilization</LD>
<TE>   By Iain Gately</TE>
<TE>   Grove Press</TE>
<TE>   320 pages; $25</TE>
<TE>   Think what you will about the merits of tobacco, but it has a
rich, complex history, at least as told by London journalist Iain
Gately, who confesses at the start of his fascinating book that he
"drifted" into the habit when he was 18 and living in Hong Kong,
where smoking was viewed as "a natural act, not a habit."</TE>
<TE>   Reviled and praised, the broad-leafed tobacco plant has played a
central role in global culture and transformed the world economy.
Gately traces tobacco's history and our relationship to it, going
back to its discovery 18,000 years ago. He also goes in search of our
attraction to it: "Why, ultimately, a generation after the practice
has been revealed as a killer, does it persist," he writes, "and even
multiply?"  Somehow it retains its image of glamour, luxury and
success in certain cultures, and its highly addictive nature keeps
vast amounts of tobacco consumed around the world.</TE>
<TE>   The myriad uses of tobacco throughout history are startling and
mysterious. Smoking the stuff wasn't the first thing that came to
mind in 5,000 to 3,000 BC, when it was cultivated in the
Peruvian-Ecuadorean Andes region. It was probably eaten; why it was
eventually smoked is the source of much speculation among
anthropologists. A likely theory, says Gately, is that smoking
evolved from "snuffing," the practice of inhaling tobacco powder
through the nasal passages, then expelling it with a sneeze,
resulting in an almost orgasmic release. (Napoleon Bonaparte was a
notoriously avid snuffer, using the equivalent of  100 cigarettes a
day.)</TE>
<TE>   People drank tobacco--also through their noses--snorted it, chewed
it, licked it and smeared it all over their bodies. It was used as an
insecticide for crops, and certain tribes in South America used
tobacco juice to kill head lice.</TE>
<TE>   Those tribes also found the juice useful for treating toothaches
and snake bites. Further, writes Gately, in ancient civilizations,
"tobacco was considered to be something that youth should aspire to
use--it was part of being grown-up, and children yearned for the day
when they would be treated as adults and be allowed to smoke."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most bizarre method of consuming tobacco was
"drinking" it through the anus, "using a hollow length of cane or
bone, or with a bulb made out of animal skin and a bone or reed
nozzle." Such tools might seem like useful methods for smoking
cessation, but apparently tobacco enemas were quite popular as early
as AD 500 in South America.</TE>
<TE>   There can be no doubt that the plant has played a positive role at
certain times in history, but Gately concedes that its virtues were
bound up in devastating effects.</TE>
<TE>   For example, although it essentially saved the Jamestown colony
from perishing and caused it to eventually prosper, labor-intensive
tobacco cultivation was responsible for introducing slavery to North
America.</TE>
<TE>   "The Dutch traders recognized a promising market," he writes, "and
returned in subsequent years with more slaves for sale, and slavery
quickly became essential to the colony's economy." The book is also
filled with entertaining historical anecdotes, such as when
Jamestown's John Rolfe introduced the concept of branding tobacco by
naming Virginia's product Orinoco, a word "suffused with the
mysteries of Eldorado as described by Sir Walter Ralegh."</TE>
<TE>   Gately's obvious passion for his subject and his impressively
exhaustive research make it challenging for any reader, including the
most fervent anti-smoker, to resist enjoying "Tobacco."</TE>
<TE>   When Europeans first heard rumors about the pleasurable and
profitable qualities of tobacco, they didn't know if they should
embrace it or hate it. (As Christians, they were skeptical of
cultivating a plant so beloved by "savage" Indians, who considered
the herb to have spiritual properties.)</TE>
<TE>   During the 17th century, tobacco slowly gained in popularity,
spreading throughout Europe and the Americas. Yet certain nations at
the time reviled it. In Russia, punishment for tobacco use was by
"slitting the lips of a smoker, or an excruciating, and usually
fatal, flogging with the knout." In Islamic countries, the
persecution was even more horrific: more than 25,000 "suspected"
smokers were put to death within 14 years in Constantinople. In
Persia, molten lead was poured down the throats of all merchants who
sold tobacco.</TE>
<TE>   Gately's engrossing narrative falters only toward the end, as the
author describes tobacco's resurgent popularity in Hollywood, and the
notorious role of the cigar in the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal.</TE>
<TE>   His disdain for the anti-smoking movement is obvious, and he
proceeds to make some irresponsible, or at least hazy statements,
insisting that "reliable studies" in Great Britain have found that
smoking doesn't necessarily have such adverse effects on nonsmokers
after all.</TE>
<TE>   The narrative ends on a limp, somewhat incongruous note, with
Gately  gushing about the joys of tobacco. Although he acknowledges
that smoking is an epidemic, he writes that "to the 1.2 billion
smokers of the world, tobacco is not just a killer, but a pleasure, a
comforter and a friend."</TE>
<TE>   He concludes by touting the supposed benefits of tobacco in
"guarding" against cancer of the womb, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's
disease. The final chapter is followed by an earnest appendix
entitled "How to Grow Tobacco." Still, the rest of the book is so
deeply engaging and witty that the flaws of the last section must be
forgiven.</TE>

<LD>   February is our rainiest month, so it might be difficult
gardening, but don't complain. We need all the rain we can get to
water trees and shrubs deeply and to push mineral salts down through
the soil. You can even begin planting early varieties of tomatoes in
warmer areas.</LD>
<LD>   If you have not gotten around to planting roses, or deciduous
fruit trees, grapes or berries, do so early in the month while they
are still available bare-root. If you buy bare-root roses that have
already broken their dormancy, gently snap off the new growth before
planting. Secondary buds will quickly take their place.</LD>

<DH>Designers have moved toward nostalgic and life-affirming
imagery since Sept. 11.</DH>

<LD>Scott Mires remembers when the marketing materials he designed for
homebuilder Shea Homes consisted of little more than pictures of
houses and how much they cost. After Sept. 11, that all changed.</LD>
<LD>   "The way we're approaching it now is talking about the
aspirational and human qualities of a home and what it means to
people. In one, there's a little bit of nostalgia in the imagery with
sepia tone photography, and the copy really connects with what it
means to buy a home, that it's not just mortar and lumber."</LD>
<LD>   Southern California graphic designers such as Mires have been
noticing a subtle shift in their work since the attacks, toward
images that are more life-affirming, meant not to dazzle but to
strike an emotional chord. These designers, who work on everything
from ads to book covers, logos and corporate reports, have channeled
their feelings about the tragedies into their work and noticed it in
the work of others. Some say they now also feel a greater sense of
responsibility to remind people that life needs to go on.</LD>
<TE>   On the Web site for the New York-based American Institute of
Graphic Arts, designers have been engaged in spirited discussions on
their feelings about the flag and other symbols of America and
patriotism, exploring what can be done for the country via the power
of graphics. Red Maxwell, from North Carolina, talked about a design
he did for a mental health organization: "My hope is that this poster
links my diverse, local community as Americans and communicates the
common pain and need for healing we all must face."</TE>
<TE>   For Mires, principal and creative director of the San Diego-based
Mires brand-consulting and design firm, says that pre-attack American
companies had more of a "strategic, bottom line" attitude about
selling their goods and services. "It was, 'We need to sell more
computer chips.' Now, rather than saying, 'Our chip runs at 40
million megahertz,' you'll see how someone uses the chip to do their
homework. I definitely see that kind of humanity coming into brands
more."</TE>
<TE>   Beverly Hills-based graphic designer Noreen Morioka, of Adams
Morioka Inc., thinks artists will rely more on familiar images of
rolling hills "with a lot of natural colors coming into play, along
with an American palette of red, white and blue. The best design work
you see out there profoundly touches you in an emotional sense and
resonates quality, assurance and reliability."</TE>
<TE>   Graphic designers have "a really powerful role in helping our
clients and our country to stay positive," says MaeLin Levine,
co-founder of San Diego-based Visual Asylum, whose client list
includes Ameristar Casinos. One client felt she should tone down her
annual Christmas card. Levine urged her to go with something more
"empowering." They ultimately decided on a stylized stained-glass
design featuring a heart, a dove and an uplifted hand. The card
contained a quote from Corinthians that read, "Let the light shine
out of darkness, make His light shine in our hearts."</TE>
<TE>   Maureen Erbe of Pasadena-based Erbe Design says that once she
realized the world wasn't going to end, "I felt it was OK to lighten
up a little bit. It's not that I'm turning my back on it; it's more
that sometimes you need a bit of relief."</TE>
<TE>   She recently designed a multi-page foldout about Groundhog Day
that incorporates whimsical illustrations and copy. Erbe says the
purpose of this promotion piece for a client was to "wish people a
short winter and the beginning of a warm spring, and a happy new year
a little later." The hope was for "design to actually make life
better and enrich people's lives. I thought, 'I could do something
meaningful and heavy,' but I felt we've had enough of that."</TE>
<TE>   Mires says he feels more responsibility now to "get really
meaningful dialogues going with the audience. I think this has made a
lot of people look inward to see who they are, what humankind is all
about."</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I could be a Red Cross volunteer," says Morioka, president
of AIGA's L.A. chapter. "But I know I'm a really good graphic
designer. You hope you make somebody's day better, give them a good
laugh and something wonderful to look at."</TE>

<LD>The Creation of Sound</LD>
<LD>   Did you know that vibrations create sound? Sometimes you can see
the vibrations, and other times you cannot. For example, if you pluck
a very tight string, you will see it vibrate as it makes the sound.
But if you snap your fingers or clap your hands, you won't see
anything vibrating. This is because the air is making the vibrations.</LD>
<LD>   Sound is created when the source of the sound makes surrounding
air molecules move around. The air molecules then travel in
vibrations (or sound waves) to your ears. Follow the directions below
for making a homemade drum, and you will be able to see how it works.</LD>
<TE>   Things you will need: plastic wrap; a large, round cake tin; a
large, strong rubber band; a cookie sheet; one teaspoon of brown
sugar; a wooden spoon.</TE>
<TE>   Directions:</TE>
<TE>   Step 1: Stretch a sheet of plastic wrap over the top of the cake
tin.</TE>
<TE>   Step 2: Stretch the rubber band around the cake tin to keep the
plastic wrap tight and in place.</TE>
<TE>   Step 3: Sprinkle some brown sugar on top of the plastic.</TE>
<TE>   Step 4: Hold the cookie sheet in the air above your homemade drum.
Using the wooden spoon, bang the cookie sheet. You should be able to
see the sugar moving around on top of the drum.</TE>
<TE>   How it works:</TE>
<TE>   When you bang the cookie sheet, it vibrates. These vibrations
cause the surrounding air molecules to move. Air then travels through
sound waves (vibrations) to the drum, making it and its plastic sheet
move as well. This causes the sugar on top of the plastic to jump
around. Sound waves also travel to your ear, making you hear the
bang.</TE>
<TE>   All music is made up of sounds. You can observe the creation of
sound Sunday at the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra's Family Concert,
"Tyrannosaurus Sue: A Cretaceous Concerto," composed and conducted by
Bruce Adolphe.</TE>
<TE>   You can travel back in time to the period when dinosaurs lived and
hear music inspired by the sounds they created. Pre-concert
activities with the Museum of Natural History begin at 1 p.m. For
tickets and more information, call the L.A. Chamber Orchestra at
(213) 622-7001, ext. 215 or visit www.laco.org.</TE>

<HD>Going With the Flow</HD>
<DH>In glassblower Caleb Siemon's pieces, color often has a
mind of its own. 'Things can happen that you're not planning on,' he
says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY BRYANT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Looking as tasty as spun candy, Caleb Siemon's multicolored glass
bowls and vases combine ancient Venetian glassblowing techniques and
contemporary zing, with a bit of serendipity thrown in.</LD>
<LD>   "A successful design is one where you set some rules to go by, but
then, within those rules, things can happen that you're not planning
on. That, to me, becomes the beauty of the piece," Siemon says.</LD>
<LD>   Siemon illustrates this with a bowl from his newest collection of
banded pieces. "I'm basically playing with opaque and transparent
colors," he says, picking up the bowl. "I put on three opaques:
celadon, tan and army green. Then three transparents--silver blue,
amber and citron green--go over them. These colors overlap and create
other colors," he says. "There's no way you can control the lines and
the colors as the piece is blown and fired. It's as if nature
designed it." This line, the second he's created, will be introduced
in February at the American Craft Council's Winter Craft Show in
Baltimore, Maryland. His first line featured bright lines of color
swirled around a vase or bowl, almost like string wrapped into a
ball.</LD>
<TE>   Siemon, who was born in Newport Beach, says his glassblowing began
at camp at age 17. "The first time I tried it it, was instant love. I
decided there and then to go into glass full time. That was a scary
decision."</TE>
<TE>   Today, 10 years later, Siemon owns United Glass Blowing, located
in an industrial area of Costa Mesa. He opened the business in 1999.
He designs and crafts pieces in a Italian factory-style studio like
the one where he apprenticed in Venice, Italy, when he studied for
two years under master glass sculptor Pino Signoretto. He went there
after earning a bachelor of fine arts degree at the Rhode Island
School of Design in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most intricate Italian glassblowing techniques Siemon
learned was the art of battuto, or engraving. "I put one color on the
outside, then clear glass, then another color on the inside. You
carve away at the outside color to reveal the inside color," he says.
These engraved pieces are labor-intensive and unique, so they can
retail for as much as $2,000. Other pieces begin at $100 for a small
bowl or vase.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, now that Siemon owns a company, he has little time to
design new works. "When we first opened, we had no customers, so I
was making things all the time and trying to figure out what people
liked. When we finally made a line and had to produce it, it was hard
for me because I wasn't used to doing the same thing over and over,"
he says.</TE>
<TE>   He does feel, however, that he'll never run out of ideas. "One
nice thing about having the shop is it's easy to experiment, and it's
so much fun to see your idea become physical within a matter of
minutes. I have a million ideas and not enough time to develop them
all."</TE>
<TE>   Siemon's pieces are available locally at Barneys, OK on West 3rd
Street and the Orange County Museum of Art. His Web site is at
www.unitedglassblowing.com.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Feb. 6 at 7:30 p.m., Renny Ramakers, founder of
Droog Design, Amsterdam, will give an illustrated lecture at the
Southern California Institute of Architecture, 960 E. 3rd St., Los
Angeles. Free admission. (213) 613-2200; www.sci arc.edu.</TE>

<HD>Family Comes First, at Least as an Excuse</HD>
<DH>Funny how an epidemic number of ousted bigwigs is singing
the same tune. Earplugs, anyone?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROY RIVENBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a surprise move, Motorola is denying reports that it recently laid
off 9,400 employees: "They quit to spend more time with their
families," a spokesman said. "The timing was purely coincidental."</LD>
<LD>   In related news, Ford Motor Co. says the reason it's halting
production of the Mercury Cougar is that the car is "weary of
constantly being on the road and wants to devote more time to its
wife and kids."</LD>
<LD>   OK, not really. But the concept of abruptly resigning to "spend
more time with family" has clearly spun out of control among men. The
roster of bigwigs who have invoked family when quitting includes a
Swedish prime minister, a CIA director, several presidential
advisors, an NFL commissioner, a slew of corporate executives,
assorted congressmen and scads of college and pro sports coaches.</LD>
<TE>   (We started to compile a list of every public figure who has quit
his job in the last decade to "spend more time with the family," but
it got so long we didn't have time for our own family.)</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the family excuse is often a smoke screen for getting
fired, but "that doesn't mean there's not an element of truth to it,"
says John Challenger, chief executive of the Chicago-based
outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas. "Most people really
do relish the chance to spend more time with their families."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the excuse has become so universal that its predecessor,
"to pursue other interests," has all but vanished. Nevertheless, the
latter still comes in handy on occasion.</TE>
<TE>   For example, when the Liggett Group tobacco company announced in
1996 that two of its top execs were resigning on the same day, it
would've looked fishy if both cited family reasons. Solution? A
Liggett spokesman said one wanted to spend more time with family and
the second planned to pursue other interests. Nobody suspected a
thing.</TE>
<TE>   The rise of "more time with family" retirements apparently
began in the 1980s, as society redefined the role of fathers. Before that,
a father's primary mission was to "be a good financial provider,"
says Roland Warren, president of the National Fatherhood Initiative.
If a high-powered executive in the 1960s had quit to spend more time at
home, "it would have been seen as shirking his responsibility to be the
breadwinner," Warren says.</TE>
<TE>   Another impetus for the spend-time-with-family craze is longer
work hours. Thanks to corporate downsizing, some employees find
themselves "doing the work of two, three or even four people,"
Challenger says. "A lot of the joy they once derived from their job
is gone. If they're in a two-income household, some say, 'Why am I
doing this to myself?' and quit."</TE>
<TE>   More recently, Sept. 11 led to some job soul-searching, Warren
says: "It had a tremendous impact in terms of people focusing on how
fragile life is and the importance of spending time with family."</TE>
<TE>   But many observers view the alleged shift in priorities as a
crock. "Ever notice how when these guys resign, they always say it's
to spend more time with their families?" Jay Leno once wisecracked.
"But when they first take the job, you never hear a guy say, 'I came
here because I'm sick of my wife and hate my kids. I want to get an
apartment with a hooker downtown.'"</TE>
<TE>   When Australia's Sun Herald published a guide to what politicians
really mean when they utter various phrases, the translation for
resigning because of "health problems" or "to spend more time with
the family" was: "I am quitting before I get carted away in chains."</TE>
<TE>   So it's not surprising that most of these "retirements" are
short-lived. Sometimes very short-lived. In 1999, Miami Dolphins
coach Jimmy Johnson decided to keep his job just one day after
quitting to spend more time with his family, which must have done
wonders for his family's self-esteem.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, in 1995, one month after Orange County Supervisor Gaddi
Vasquez resigned to spend more time with family, he took a job with
Southern California Edison, only to resign that position after three
months and become a cop, only to quit that job after a few months and
return to Edison. (His latest job, which won Senate confirmation
Friday, is running the Peace Corps.)</TE>
<TE>   Face-saving excuses for losing a job are nothing new.
Archeologists sifting through the ruins of a prehistoric cave will
someday uncover the world's first resignation letter: "Thag quit. Me
want spend more time inventing fire."</TE>
<TE>   Or they'll find a medieval parchment that says: "I do hereby quit
to spendeth more time storming castles and rescuing fair maidens."</TE>
<TE>   No doubt, the 21st century will produce its own brand of euphemism
for abrupt resignation. Enron boss Ken Lay blew a golden opportunity
last week when he failed to say he was stepping down to "spend more
time with my attorneys."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, we're stuck on the family thing. In January alone, the
excuse was invoked by a Sports Illustrated managing editor as well as
by Yahoo president Jeff Mallett. (The fact that Yahoo just announced
its fifth straight money-losing quarter and that Mallett is the third
Yahoo exec in a year to resign for "family" reasons is coincidental.)</TE>
<TE>   To break up the monotony, outplacement consultant Challenger
suggests future ousted bigwigs try some alternative euphemisms, such
as: "going back to school," "taking a sabbatical," "going to work for
a nonprofit," "writing a novel" and "I've decided to be a ski bum for
six months."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, he adds, the ski bum rationale sounds too frivolous
after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "People are looking for something more profound as a reason to
leave their job," he says. Maybe "spiritual pilgrimage" is more
appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   But fatherhood lobbyist Warren prefers hanging on to spending time
with family.</TE>
<TE>   "If it has become a cliche, it's a good cliche," he says. "It
makes the person who hears it evaluate his own priorities and how he
spends his time."</TE>
<TE>   Good point. As humorist Bruce McCall once noted, the joys of home
and hearth are tough to beat: "How can you compare jetting out to
Pebble Beach in the company Gulfstream, yet again, for another boring
client-golfing weekend with wiping soggy Cheerios off the kitchen
floor?"</TE>

<DH>Architect returns to make crime-riddled East L.A. projects
of his youth more attractive and livable.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three young men darted past 21-year-old architecture student Ricardo
Rodriguez, across the unkempt crab grass and sprawling parking courts
that served as public space for the Maravilla housing projects in
East Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   It was 1984, and Rodriguez still lived in this place where he'd
grown up. He had never joined a neighborhood gang, but many of the
gang members were his friends, and he was used to hearing of fights
that ended in gunfire. But this night he and several others witnessed
a friend being shot--a youth named Ernie who had passed out on the
ground in a drunken stupor. Ernie never knew what hit him when one of
the three men fired a bullet through his skull.</LD>
<LD>   By the time police arrived, a few minutes later, the men had fled
through the cars in the sprawling parking courts.</LD>
<TE>   The incident left him with a theory on what may have helped the
assailants get away: The barracks-like design of Maravilla, with its
windowless walls and high fences, allowed criminals to hide out and
go undetected by the police.</TE>
<TE>   Seventeen years later, Rodriguez has returned to the housing
projects. He's among the architects revitalizing Aliso Village, one
of Los Angeles' largest collections of public housing, at 1st and
Clarence streets, a few miles from Maravilla, east of downtown Los
Angeles. Some 685 units in a cluster of two-story concrete
apartments--dating back to the early 1940s--were virtually cleared
away in 2000 to make room for a new neighborhood of 376 rental units
and 93 single-family homes that will be for sale. Nearly one-third of
the homes will be sold at special rates to former public housing
residents.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez's Quatro Design Group--in which he's partnered with
architects David Stokes and Javier Molina--is one of four teams that
have collaborated on the new community, scheduled to begin
construction this summer. The new units will be much closer in design
to suburban townhomes than the giant apartment complexes that have
become associated with public housing.</TE>
<TE>   Quatro is serving as the "architect of note" for the project,
responsible for the details of construction documents. Two other
firms, William Hezmalhalch Architects and Van Tilburg, Banvard &amp;
Soderbergh, were the lead housing designers, while Quatro is creating
the park and management buildings. If funding comes through, Quatro
also will design retail space along 1st Street.</TE>
<TE>   Walking through what is left of the old Aliso projects--a cluster
of buildings southwest of 1st and Clarence streets--Rodriguez points
to rooftop fences placed there to keep gang members from staging
gunfights between buildings. Then he walks among rows of rusted-out
clotheslines, spread out over a wide area of dead crab grass. "The
clotheslines won't be there in the new place," he says firmly. "We
got them to put a washer and dryer into every unit."</TE>
<TE>   Dressed in a mustard-colored shirt and a checked tie, Rodriguez,
38, at first appears shy. But he proudly explains how he and the rest
of the team championed some of the ideas that will go into the new
Aliso Village. For example, large swaths of common grass areas--"a
no-man's land," as he calls it--will be eliminated in favor of
smaller yards, well-defined areas for which each resident is
responsible for the upkeep.</TE>
<TE>   "In Maravilla we had 61/2-foot fences that you couldn't see
through," he recalls. "In the nighttime, the gang members would climb
over to our patio and hide from the cops. You couldn't find them. One
of my ideas was that we eliminated the fences so you couldn't do that
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   William Witte, a partner in Irvine-based Related Cos., one of the
Aliso Village developers, says that Rodriguez "probably gave us more
thoughts and ideas in how to [create a safer community] than anyone
else. He drew on his design experience and his neighborhood
experience in terms of [a building's] staying power and how it serves
the community."</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez's role is unusual in a profession that still bears
remnants of an old-boys' network. According to Statistical Abstract
for 1999, Latinos made up 4.4% of the country's 194,000 architects.</TE>
<TE>   Although he and his partners have worked on a variety of
projects--just before Aliso Village, they designed a
37,000-square-foot home in Newport Beach--some of their bigger
assignments have been in the Boyle Heights area. In addition to
public housing, they are designing an 11-unit affordable apartment
complex being built at Whittier Boulevard and Record Avenue by the
East L.A. Community Corp., as well as the East L.A. Civic Center
Plaza, a 29,000-square-foot shopping center being built on Mednik
Avenue. The latter will feature block-like buildings in colors that
recall a Mexican fiesta, with flat roofs of varying heights. "The
slippage in planes is to emphasize the integration of generations,"
Rodriguez says of the design.</TE>
<TE>   He's been able to bring his personal history to detailed aspects
of the design in Aliso Village. "In the Mexican culture, if you go to
someone's house, you get invited to the kitchen; you don't get
invited to the living room," he says. "You are in the kitchen, and
you are eating food, and you are celebrating. The living room is like
a shrine. You go to some of these units and they have plastic on
their sofas and photographs of all their families. [Other] architects
didn't understand that. They didn't understand we had to design a
great room atmosphere where you open up the kitchen and the dining
room and it is a bigger space." They went with his suggestions.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up in these areas," Rodriguez says. "I understand the
community. I understand the lifestyle."</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez's mother, Margarita, raised her six children by working
factory jobs after separating from her husband, Ruben, an
actor-singer. Ricardo, the second oldest, shared one of the
apartment's four bedrooms with two other brothers.</TE>
<TE>   The buildings "looked like barracks," he says. "There was really
not a sense of a frontyard or a front door. And in back there were a
lot of high fences separating the units. Everything was closed off.
And then there was a wide breezeway separating the buildings. Those
ended up being outlets for gangs to come through. We didn't have a
sense of pride of ownership."</TE>
<TE>   Even at an early age, he was bothered by the design. During the
early 1970s, when housing officials were looking for ways to renovate
Maravilla, they threw a competition for all of the children in the
projects, asking them to create their ideal space. It was a public
relations gesture, but had a big impact on then 7-year-old Ricardo.
He submitted the winning plans. His drawing was of an apartment unit,
but this time the front door had a porch and the yard a short little
fence. "The drawing kind of reclaimed the public space there for our
own," he says.</TE>
<TE>   By the time he reached high school, he was taking drafting and
drawing courses. He credits his mother for keeping her children away
from much of the gang activity in Maravilla. "That was through her
guidance," he says. "She worked really hard to keep us focused, and
she sent us to parochial schools. I had a lot of friends in gangs,
but even they knew that I wasn't going to join," he recalls. "They
would say, 'This is Ricardo. He's got a good head on his shoulders.'"</TE>
<TE>   With the help of grants and scholarships, he enrolled at East Los
Angeles College and later at Cal Poly Pomona, where he studied
architecture and interned at various firms during summer breaks. He
continued to live at home in Maravilla, driving back and forth in a
beat-up 1976 Honda Civic.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating in 1989, he got a job with RTKL Associates and
later worked for STV Architects, two large architecture practices,
where he worked on a variety of projects, including a Marriott hotel,
several public schools and a police training facility.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, Rodriguez started to gravitate toward projects closer to
his neighborhood, if only by coincidence. He had joined the firm of
Irvine-based McLarand, Vasquez &amp; Partners, which had numerous
contracts nationwide to design public housing. One of its projects
was to help plan Las Casitas, a 124-unit development that was to
replace several blocks of two- and three- story apartment buildings
just south of Aliso Village.</TE>
<TE>   The new Las Casitas the first major cluster of public housing to
be built in the area in a half-century--would come to resemble a
townhome community with bungalow-style rooftops and units painted in
a mix of pastel colors.</TE>
<TE>   It was also his entree into the highly charged politics of public
housing.</TE>
<TE>   "The fear [among residents] was that we were lying to them, that
we would displace them and throw them out," says Xavier Mendoza, a
developer who worked on the project for the Housing Authority of Los
Angeles. "But having lived in a public housing project, Ricardo was
very attuned to their concerns. He knew their language. And if they
had ideas, he was able to draw them on paper."</TE>
<TE>   It was not always easy for Rodriguez and other architects to sell
the concept of "defensible space," in which communities are designed
to reduce the likelihood of crime. Units are clustered close
together; windows without bars provide views into ground-level
courtyards. Each unit has its own patio and garden, at almost arm's
length of the neighbors. The ideas, many of them advanced in Oscar
Newman's "Defensible Space: Crime Prevention Through Urban Design"
(MacMillan, 1972), were to "have no place where eyes can't see what
is happening outside," Rodriguez says.</TE>
<TE>   The verdict on these ideas is still out: The first of the new
units opened almost three years ago, and though residents like the
design, crime is still an issue. Three units were broken into just
before Christmas. But "it's not like before," says Cristobol Holguin,
64, who lives in a three-bedroom unit with his wife, daughter and
granddaughter. Even the break-ins don't constitute the level of
danger that once existed.</TE>
<TE>   Dana Cuff, author of "The Provisional City: Los Angeles Stories of
Architecture and Urbanism" (MIT Press, 2000) says that such new homes
are akin to "putting the suburbs downtown" yet lack the "utopian
hope" of 1940s developments. (Back then, Lloyd Wright, son of Frank
Lloyd Wright, was among those who led the design of Aliso Village).</TE>
<TE>   "At the same time, this is going to be better for the people who
are living there than what Aliso Village had become," says Cuff, a
professor of architecture and urban design at the UCLA. "It had
become the worst kind of ghetto for people who lived there. These new
houses will make it harder to do the kinds of things you don't want
seen in the neighborhood. And that is basically what the residents
want."</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez was all set to continue on the project until his mother
suffered a heart attack in 1996. "That kind of changed everything,"
he says. "I told Ernie Vasquez that I needed to be at home with my
mom. I realized that having your own firm was an easier way to be
with your family and do the architecture you want to do." It has also
allowed him to spend time with his wife, Elena, and their 1-year-old
daughter, Alegra. He partnered with Stokes and Molina (the latter of
whom he went to high school with and worked at STV). "I was really
lucky my wife had a job and could help us out," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no set design agenda," Rodriguez says of Quatro. "But we
try to incorporate the social aspect of a project as well as the
cultural aspect. If you get to know the community very well and get
to know their needs and desires, then we can mold it and let it be
what it wants to be."</TE>
<TE>   They will soon get their chance, even closer to Rodriguez's
boyhood home. Last week, he appeared at a community meeting to
discuss his firm's plans to beautify a three-quarter-mile stretch of
Cesar Chavez Boulevard from Mednik Avenue to Ford Boulevard. It is
just around the corner from where he grew up, and he walked the
street daily to school and church.</TE>
<TE>   "This is special, because I am coming back home and doing
something," he says. "People still know you. They know you as little
Ricardo. Or they know you as the architect professional. It's great
to know that."</TE>

<HD>Bridgett's Adventure on the Digital Highway</HD>
<DH>Part 4 The story so far: Bridgett is traveling inside her
computer trying to get information for her report, but she is in
danger from a computer virus. Her friend Bookmark is trying to help.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLAMINA NOGALES-STRUPAT</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bridgett grabbed Bookmark by his cursor and yelled, "What will happen
to me? I don't know how to get back!"</LD>
<LD>   "The virus will destroy you if Hard Drive doesn't get you first.
No escape key there."</LD>
<LD>   "Virus or no, I will not leave until I get the information I need
for my report," Bridgett announced.</LD>
<TE>   "Click! Where shall I hide you?" Bookmark wondered. He stuck her
in the directory drawer. "You will be safe here. Remain quiet until I
fetch you," Bookmark said as he flew off.</TE>
<TE>   Bookmark saw that lights were out on half of the Digital Highway
and broken zeros and ones moved slowly down the path.</TE>
<TE>   One pixel yelled, "Disaster recovery! Someone needs to put in the
command!"</TE>
<TE>   A pixel family floated by and whispered, "Beware, the virus is
near. It found the girl's pencil and knows that a foreign body is
here. The virus lurks close by."</TE>
<TE>   Bookmark thought it could not get any worse. Something pulled
Bookmark's cursor. Hard Drive was aware of Bridgett now and had
evaluated her as an alien object. It spun faster, and the sound was
piercing.</TE>
<TE>   Bookmark felt his cursor shrink in size and his wings grow weak.
He knew what would happen if the girl were caught. "There must be
something I can do," he thought. "This is all my fault. I must make
sure she gets her information and then get her to the computer screen
portal."</TE>
<TE>   He said out loud, "Let me see, I shall take her on the Digital
Highway when the traffic is greatest. Click. Yes, that is the
answer!" Bookmark smiled, and the zeros and ones hummed past faster
than usual.</TE>
<TE>   It was getting darker. Bridgett put her hands over her ears as the
noise grew louder. She grabbed her note pad and realized she had lost
her pencil. She saved the last bit of information in her memory. She
finally had what she needed to finish the report.</TE>
<TE>   Friday: How is Bridgett going to find Bookmark and get out of the
computer before the virus finds her?</TE>

<LD>Sites Can Do More for Their Country</LD>
<LD>   Most congressional Web sites have plenty of room for improvement,
with nine out of 10 providing paltry information and few services to
their constituents, according to a report released this week.</LD>
<LD>   Although some lawmakers and committees have set up innovative Web
sites that allow citizens to easily get in touch or find out about
issues, the Congress Online Project found that most emphasize
rhetoric over content and fail to keep information up to date.</LD>
<TE>   The report gave about 10% of the 605 sites it surveyed a grade of
A or B, with Capitol Hill averaging a C-minus.</TE>
<TE>   House Republicans were more likely than Democrats to have
outstanding sites, the report said, and Senate Democrats had an edge
over their Republican colleagues, echoing the parties' respective
control of the two chambers.</TE>
<TE>   The House Republican Conference's site, www.gop.gov, was singled
out as one of the most innovative sites on the Hill.</TE>
<TE>   Sony Slashes Price of Memory Stick</TE>
<TE>   Japanese electronics giant Sony Corp. said this week that it has
cut the price on its proprietary portable memory format by as much as
40%, bringing the price of the technology closer to the leading
standard.</TE>
<TE>   This is the second price reduction in six months for Sony's Memory
Stick. The flash memory format competes with CompactFlash, which has
the largest market share in devices such as digital cameras, personal
digital assistants and MP3 players.</TE>
<TE>   Sony's Web site listed the top-end 128-megabyte version of the
chewing gum-shaped Memory Stick at $89.95, down from $149.95. In
August, Sony cut the price on the Stick from $279.99.</TE>
<TE>   Prices on the other Memory Stick modules also were cut: 64 MB to
$49.95 from $79.95; 32 MB to $34.95 from $49.95; and both 16 MB and 8
MB to $24.95, from $34.95 and $29.95, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, flash, or nonvolatile, memory in the
postage-stamp-sized Secure Digital format retails from $30 for the
16-MB card up to as much as $150 for 128 MB.</TE>
<TE>   Intel Trims Cost of Pentium 4 Chips</TE>
<TE>   Intel Corp. cut prices modestly this week on some of its
microprocessors, particularly on the Pentium 4 processors as the
world's largest computer chip maker seeks to move the PC market to
those chips.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Clara-based Intel cut the price of its Pentium 4 processor
running at 1.9 gigahertz by 12% to $241 from $273. The biggest price
reduction was 18%, on the 1.6-GHz Pentium 4, dropping to $133 from
$163.</TE>
<TE>   Intel is phasing out its Pentium III processor, replacing it with
the Pentium 4. The fastest Pentium 4 chips are made with 0.13-micron
manufacturing technology, which lets Intel put more transistors on a
single chip and get more chips from a single wafer.</TE>
<TE>   That cuts costs for Intel, helping it to boost margins on the
microprocessors.</TE>
<TE>   The company also cut prices on its Celeron processors by 7% to
14%.</TE>
<TE>   The fastest Celeron, running at 1.3 GHz, costs $103, down from
$118.</TE>

<DH>Rock musican embraces technology in the studio and at home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trent Reznor's original career plan was to build computers. Instead,
he decided to use them--with guitars and drums--to build some of the
most intense, searing music in the modern rock era.</LD>
<LD>   The relentless gloom of Reznor's Nine Inch Nails wore down some
critics over the years, despite his sonic inventiveness and the
melodic hooks within his astringent industrial soundscapes. But he
won plaudits for his 2000 U.S. tour, dubbed "Fragility v2.0," which
mixed pounding hits from Nine Inch Nail's first two full-length CDs
with moody but gentler work from its last studio album, "The
Fragile."</LD>
<LD>   This month, Nothing Records released a live video (in DVD and VHS)
and CD from the tour, both produced by Reznor. The video was directed
by Rob Sheridan, the band's Web master and designer, and shot by its
crew using digital video cameras.</LD>
<TE>   The audio and video were edited entirely on Apple computers,
reflecting Reznor's devotion to the brand. He has nearly 20 of them
at work and at home, many of them effectively converted into
synthesizers.</TE>
<TE>   The 36-year-old Reznor lives in the Garden District of New
Orleans, a few blocks from his studio.</TE>
<TE>   DESKTOP: I've got [an Apple] G4 tower. It's about 6 months old.
And I have a mini sort of writing rig [an Apple G4 with a DVD
burner]. But I try to keep my house life separate.... Otherwise, I
leave work to go home to do work, in a different room but with the
same screen, same software.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What do you have hooked up to the computer you use for
songwriting at home?</TE>
<TE>   A: I tried to creatively limit my options. There's one keyboard I
use to play, and all the sounds are software-based. And sometimes
interesting ideas come from only having that many tools to achieve
them.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Why did you start using computers?</TE>
<TE>   A: The main purpose of having computers around was to record into,
as a compositional tool.</TE>
<TE>   In '93, '94, when I was working on "The Downward Spiral" out in
L.A. ... that was when we first started getting sucked into the world
of finding out what people were writing about our band [online]. But
I still was not an e-mail person until some point after that.</TE>
<TE>   I've got a little bit of that addictive behavior. I wonder if
anybody e-mailed me in the last eight minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Are you the sort of person who'd rather have a conversation by
e-mail than by phone?</TE>
<TE>   A: [With e-mail] I can say what I want to say, in the terms that I
want to say it. Having our Web site, a means to communicate with our
public that usually doesn't have to go through other people editing,
approving, publishing, is pretty interesting.</TE>
<TE>   LAPTOP: I had a G3 powerbook for the longest time. I just got for
Christmas a new [Titanium] G4 Powerbook with a CD burner.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Have you gotten envious looks when you break out the Powerbook
on an airplane?</TE>
<TE>   A: There were some Luddites with some kind of PC-based, primitive
[operating system], I think it's called Windows, who couldn't figure
out how I got a TV on the plane.</TE>
<TE>   HAND-HELD: I end up buying a bunch of [garbage]. I think the last
one I bought was a color Palm. I don't think I've ever used it. I
always have my laptop with me, and I always have my cell phone.</TE>
<TE>   I wish I could use a PDA. I wish I was organized enough to be able
to have an organizer.</TE>
<TE>   CELL PHONE: I've just got a Motorola.... I had to have, of course,
wireless network ability, e-mail, a browser.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Have you ever browsed the Web through your phone?</TE>
<TE>   A: I think I did that one time, when I got to a movie too early.
[He used it to check the weather, and was not impressed.]</TE>
<TE>   You get flooded with information.</TE>
<TE>   BOOKMARKS: I was just working with [music producer] Dave Ogilvy.
We'll exchange links that we have. I find myself needing to check
ridiculous sites--Consumption Junction.</TE>
<TE>   A computer's a good way to mirror what obsessive behavior you have
in your own life. One of my needs is to have the newest, latest,
un-beta-tested piece of gear.... VersionTracker.com.</TE>
<TE>   STEREO: I just have a pair of silly, gimmicky clear speakers, two
thin tubes. A Harman Kardon subwoofer that's clear and
gimmicky-looking.</TE>
<TE>   HOME THEATER: I have a house in the Garden District of New
Orleans. It pretty much dictates what your decor is going to be like
because your house is an 1865 Greek Revival, a big house....</TE>
<TE>   I have a great, big long front parlor where ladies would sit down
and have tea. I soundproofed that room, because I have a neighbor
fairly close to me. I have a projection screen that comes out of the
ceiling. If I want to watch a movie at thunderous volume, I can do
that without the cops coming.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Where do you watch TV?</TE>
<TE>   A: Upstairs in another room ... with an HDTV set.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What kind?</TE>
<TE>   A: An RCA, the biggest tube one they have, in the wide-screen
format. It looked the best in the store, as far as the screen.... But
it has just a terrible first-generation [operating system].</TE>
<TE>   FAVORITE TECH TOY: I've got a whole studio full of them.
Currently, it would be the iPod. I've never been good at walking
around with headphones on. [But] after I got that iPod and loaded up
so much on it ... it's an interesting new thing to have a soundtrack
playing along while I do things.</TE>
<TE>   HOW TECHNOLOGY HAS CHANGED YOUR LIFE: I've never feared computers.
It's more like, I've embraced them as a tool. I've mainly had to
think of that on the musical level. Is it cheating, is it hindering,
is it improving songwriting? To me it's a scratchpad, it's an editor
sometimes.</TE>
<TE>   I often feel I'd be lost without it. It's my tape deck, it's my
phone book, it's my dictionary, it's my thesaurus.</TE>

<HD>An Online Guide to Revenge for Those Who Can't Forgive or
Forget</HD>
<DH>Payback services have become a popular Web feature, serving
up spells, vengeance kits and voodoo dolls--often with a humorous
rather than a spiteful flavor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT BURNS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forgiveness may be divine, but payback is definitely more popular.
And while revenge is best served cold, serving it digitally is fast
catching up.</LD>
<LD>   Some Web sites make it a little too easy. Payback.com (www.the
payback.com) offers to send a box of melted chocolates for $24.99 or
one "dead, smelly fish" for $19.99. It used to have dead flowers, but
regular florists tend to deliver enough of those.</LD>
<LD>   Revenge Unlimited (www .revengeunlimited.com) is the whoopee
cushion version of vengeance, with products such as gum that turns
your mouth blue and "bald man's comb." The library is a little
spookier with titles such as "Be Your Own Undertaker." We'd recommend
being someone else's undertaker first, just for the practice. And you
can pick up ideas and new tricks in the Avengers' Den, a message
board for those who still think law enforcement agencies don't know
how to go online.</LD>
<TE>   Then there's Pranks 4 All (www.pranks4all.com), which has yet more
embarrassing things to send to people, such as a package labeled
"Correcting Serious Character Flaws for Dummies."</TE>
<TE>   Most of these payback services are innocent enough and are closer
to practical jokes than to true vengeance. It's a bit like telling
Machiavelli to act his age not his shoe size.</TE>
<TE>   More serious, however, and somewhat pathological is the Avenger's
Front Page (www .ekran.no/html/revenge), which appears to be aimed at
people who have traded a life for a chip on the shoulder. Let it go,
dudes, you're in the wrong century to go all Medea on us.</TE>
<TE>   Once you're through the real-world sites, there's a slew of pages
dedicated to paranormal payback, because, you know, the spirit world
really cares that the clerk in the shoe department was condescending
to you.</TE>
<TE>   Put a Spell on You has the "ultimate" revenge kit at www.spell
maker.com/revenge.htm for a whopping $79.95. There are several
cheaper alternatives, in case you don't feel $80 worth of been
wronged. And there's a link to the bargain basement for sale items.
When dealing with the dark side, it's always nice to save a few
bucks.</TE>
<TE>   As with fast food and clothing store chains, there's a lot of
competition out there. Spellkit.com (www .spellkit.com/hexspellkit)
has hexes to buy, as does Custom Voodoo
(customvoodoo.com/voodcurandhe .html). If you're planning on a curse
marathon, Custom Voodoo even has savings on bulk orders, as in
graveyard dirt.</TE>
<TE>   But since your money may be better spent on anger management
therapy, there's a free archive of spells at Lucky Mojo (www.lucky
mojo.com/spells.html). Be warned. The supply lists are downright
depressing.</TE>
<TE>   The easiest and most innocuous curse we found was at PinStruck
(www.pinstruck.com), which digitally delivers a nice little
personalized voodoo doll. And it generates less bad karma than
sending an e-card to someone you barely know for a holiday no one
cares about.</TE>
<TE>   Revenge is a lot like candy. Too much and you start to feel sick.</TE>
<TE>   If you'd rather take the high road, there's the Forgiveness Web
(www.forgivenessweb.com), the Campaign for Forgiveness Research
(www.forgivenessweb.com) and the International Forgiveness Institute
at www.forgiveness -institute.org.</TE>
<TE>   Or you could just live well.</TE>
<TE>   And, one last thing: if you didn't like this Click, just get mad.
Please.</TE>

<HD>Updated Shooter Aims to Stay True to Classic</HD>
<DH>'Return to Castle Wolfenstein' creators play off nostalgia
for the original while bringing visuals and sound into the present.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the granddaddy titles of games is "Wolfenstein 3D," a
first-person shooter that spawned "Doom" and "Quake."</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't exactly three-dimensional graphics as most gamers have
come to think of them. The walls met at right angles and the
environments looked flat. Nevertheless, the game gripped a generation
of trigger-happy geeks.</LD>
<LD>   Now comes "Return to Castle Wolfenstein," the great-grandson of
the original, to milk the nostalgia factor. Released nearly 10 years
later, "Return to Castle Wolfenstein" represents a coda to the
evolution of the shooter genre thus far. The graphics are far more
realistic, the enemies react more intelligently and the animation is
more lifelike, thanks to the use of motion-capture techniques that
match character gestures to the movements of live actors.</LD>
<TE>   Three studios collaborated to make the game, including Id
Software, the creators of "Wolfenstein 3D" and the executive producer
of "Return to Castle Wolfenstein." Gray Matter Interactive Studios
built the single-player mode, and Nerve Software developed the
multi-player campaigns. Like the original, the new title focuses on
killing as many Nazis as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Drew Markham, creative director of Gray Matter in Los Angeles who
worked on "Redneck Rampage" and "Kingpin," discussed the pressure of
inheriting the "Wolfenstein" mantle and what his team did to improve
upon the classic.</TE>
<TE>   Question: How did you come up with the idea of a follow-up to
"Wolfenstein 3D"?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: We were working with Id on "The Reckoning," and we kept
seeing the "Wolf" poster on their wall. It was such a seminal title
that we thought somebody needed to do something on this again. So we
asked them if they were ever going to do a sequel. They said they
hadn't really thought about it. Every time we went down to see them
we bugged them about it. So they finally let us.</TE>
<TE>   Q: With a game like this, you're dealing with a host of fan
expectations. How did you work with that?</TE>
<TE>   A: Anytime you have something like this, if you let 100 people
make the game, you'd have 100 different games. For a seminal title
like this, everyone was going to have their own idea of what the game
should be. So it boiled down to working with Id and doing what they
thought was in keeping with the spirit of the original games.</TE>
<TE>   When the first-person shooter genre came out, it was basically
point the gun, pull the trigger, move, pick up health, pick up ammo.
Over the years, the genre hybridized into other genres. Third-person
shooters, action-adventure, puzzle-shooters, you name it. So there
was this big palette of games to choose from.</TE>
<TE>   We wanted to keep the flavor of the original, but fold in as much
of the cool stuff as we could to make it contemporary. Even though
it's a nostalgic game, it still has to survive in a contemporary
market.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What parts of the old version did you keep?</TE>
<TE>   A: The essence of the old game was always wanting to know what was
around the next corner. Secrets also played a big part--secret walls
that move revealing secret areas. You feel so good when you find
those. That was a huge part of ["Wolfenstein 3D"].</TE>
<TE>   The other thing was that the first game was so compelling and
groundbreaking that it led you to believe things were going on that
really weren't. It made your mind more fertile. You have this
experience that's completely real to you. It mixed with your head and
put you in a completely different space. So we tried to recapture
that, too.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How did you approach the use of violence in this game?</TE>
<TE>   A: We tried to keep true to the original. If you look at the
original game, it's not super gory. It's more moody, movie violence.
We wanted to keep it to that, like a movie about World War II. Plus,
we added supernatural elements. You've got zombies and spooky
paranormal activities. One of the elements of the original was an
over-the-top comic book feel.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What are the hallmarks of a first-rate game in this genre?</TE>
<TE>   A: Pacing. That's one of the things that's missing in a number of
games. You can't have the volume at 10 all the time. The notes you
don't play are just as important as the ones you do. If you want the
player to be hyper-aware, you can use silence. I like the
roller-coaster-ride feel of having lots of contrast. I think that's
what makes a great movie and a great game.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, visuals need to be top-notch. And sound is key. If you
don't get the sound right, it can kill a game. There was a game that
came out three or four years ago that was stunning visually, but the
gun sounded like it was shooting Jell-O. You need that sound element
to be on target--the gun has to sound like a gun. We got to play
around with an interactive music system. It was amazing watching
people play the game with and without the music and watching how
their bodies tense up so much more with the music on.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What about the artificial intelligence engine?</TE>
<TE>   A: AI is critical. That's an area that's nascent right now. In the
early days, it was easy because you had the player and you had
enemies. And the enemies were all hostile. That's an easy behavior
model to develop. There's no gray scale; it was pure hostility. When
you get into ambiguity, that's when it becomes a lot more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Q: If processing power were no object, what kind of AI would you
build?</TE>
<TE>   A: The AI is just a matrix of decision making. Right now, it's
difficult when you have 15 enemies on the screen, all scrolling
through all the parameters in real time. All those decisions take
cycles off the [central processing unit]. We have to do tricks to
economize on the CPU. We have to cheat. So the enemies have to think
in little blocks and cycles, taking turns sharing the cycles.</TE>
<TE>   As processor power becomes greater, you can have characters with
steady thought states. He's constantly making decisions based on his
personality, his environment.</TE>
<TE>   We're doing that now, but we're faking a lot of it. In our game,
if I get this monster gun, the guards will run away from me if they
see the gun. They know they're outgunned.</TE>
<TE>   We're just scratching the surface. Someday, these guys will have
real eyeballs and they can make decisions based on what they see, not
whether certain nodes have been triggered, which is one of the ways

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the transition from analog to digital TV grinds along, one key
piece remains stubbornly out of place: a digital successor to the
VCR.</LD>
<LD>   The federal government mandated the shift to digital in 1997,
enabling broadcasters to offer the richly detailed, wide-screen
format called high-definition TV. But as a side effect, consumers are
being forced to replace at least some of their video gear with
digital versions.</LD>
<LD>   For starters, anyone who wants to experience HDTV needs a digital
set. HDTV offers more than 10 times as much detail as analog TV,
which is far more than a conventional set can display.</LD>
<TE>   Nor can a conventional VCR capture or transmit an HDTV signal. And
the current line of personal video recorders, which use built-in hard
drives instead of removable tapes, aren't equipped to receive HDTV.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer electronics companies have put a handful of HDTV-capable
digital videotape recorders on the market, and four Hollywood studios
recently announced that they'll release HDTV videotapes that will
work in some of these D-VHS machines. But those devices can't record
off the vast majority of today's digital TVs and receivers.</TE>
<TE>   That's because these sets don't have digital inputs or outputs.
And as it turns out, digital connectors are proving to be a vital
link in the HDTV recording chain.</TE>
<TE>   Consider this another growing pain for digital TV, which has
endured high prices, battles over standards, antenna disputes and a
shortage of programming. The migration from analog is well underway,
but unresolved issues continue to slow the transition to digital and
threaten consumers who make the investment in costly HDTV sets.</TE>
<TE>   There wasn't much demand for HDTV recorders in previous years,
mainly because there wasn't much to record. Today, however, CBS, ABC,
HDNet, HBO and some pay-per-view services are offering
high-definition programs daily.</TE>
<TE>   Here's the technical challenge for HDTV recording. A digital TV
signal is a stream of data representing millions of tiny points of
color. In its raw form, HDTV consumes up to 1.8 billion bits of data
per second. At that rate you'd need more than 800 gigabytes of
storage to record a single one-hour program, or about seven times as
much capacity as the largest personal video recorder provides.</TE>
<TE>   Broadcasters don't transmit raw digital signals, however. They
compress them, cutting the data stream to less than 20 million bits
per second. A digital receiver then unpacks the data and sends it to
the screen in uncompressed form.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese consumer electronics giant JVC, the inventor of the VHS
format, solved the recording challenge by developing a digital VCR
that stores compressed HDTV signals. These D-VHS machines can either
unpack the data themselves, or send the compressed data digitally to
a TV.</TE>
<TE>   The main problem is that the U.S. models can't tune in a
compressed HDTV signal for themselves. They rely on a digital TV or
set-top receiver to do it for them. And few of the TVs or receivers
on the market have a FireWire output, the digital connector needed to
pass a compressed signal on to a D-VHS recorder.</TE>
<TE>   Forthcoming models of satellite and cable boxes are expected to
provide those connectors, but that raises another issue. One of the
two companies selling D-VHS machines in the U.S. is Mitsubishi, and
its D-VHS machines use FireWire outputs as well as inputs. So they'll
only work with HDTVs that have FireWire inputs, which limits the
field to half a dozen new Mitsubishi and Sony models.</TE>
<TE>   JVC's D-VHS machines have conventional analog outputs as well as
FireWire. However, the Hollywood studios are pressing JVC and other
manufacturers to phase out analog connectors in favor of digital
ones, which provide greater protection against piracy. At the same
time, some studios are demanding copy-protection technology that lets
them block a high-definition tape from being played through analog
connectors.</TE>
<TE>   The compatibility issues will disappear when and if manufacturers
settle on a common digital connector. By then, though, there's likely
to be a disc-based recorder for HDTV, which could sound the death
knell for D-VHS.</TE>

<HD>EverQuest's Place in the Economy</HD>
<DH>Professor says value of role-playing game's transactions
put it just below Russia in GNP.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's unlikely any other economist has made the claim that Edward
Castronova did in his most recent scholarly study.</LD>
<LD>   "I faced many dangers," he wrote, "and died many, many times in
order to gather impressions and bring them back for you."</LD>
<LD>   Castronova, an assistant professor at Cal State Fullerton, did his
economic study on Internet role-playing games such as EverQuest,
where characters created by fee-paying players can die and come back
to life numerous times before amassing vast virtual wealth.</LD>
<TE>   By immersing himself in EverQuest, surveying players and keeping
track of online auctions where virtual goods are sold for real
dollars, Castronova arrived at a startling conclusion.</TE>
<TE>   "The GNP per capita in EverQuest is the 77th largest in the world,
right between Russia and Bulgaria," he said . "If a character, even a
virtual one, is doing something that has a clear marketable value,
that's part of an economy."</TE>
<TE>   Castronova allows that he was stretching the traditional
guidelines of gross national product to arrive at the conclusion in
his paper, "Virtual Worlds: A First-Hand Account of Market and
Society on the Cyberian Frontier."</TE>
<TE>   But experience levels and items gained in game play are regularly
sold for real-world money on auction sites. Castronova determined
that a powerful level-50 character can sell for as much as $500.</TE>
<TE>   Even though relatively few players participate in real-world
transactions involving EverQuest goods, he believes the potential
value is meaningful.</TE>
<TE>   "Every level is worth about 10 bucks. To me, that is value
creation and fits into any standard definition of economic value," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The selling of EverQuest components has been banned by Sony Online
Entertainment, which owns the game. But players, who pay $10 a month
to participate, can find weapons, armor and magical jewelry readily
available on auction sites.</TE>
<TE>   Castronova's study, which also assigns exchange, inflation and
poverty rates to the EverQuest world, was published as a working
paper by the Center for Economic Studies at the University of Munich.
After refinements, he hopes eventually to get it published in a peer
review journal.</TE>
<TE>   So far, he said, the reaction has been positive. "Economists seem
to really dig it when standard economic thinking is applied to
different areas. It shows how economic principals are widely
applicable," Castronova said.</TE>
<TE>   "You should see the economic studies of game shows," he added.
"Whole papers have been done on 'Jeopardy.'"</TE>

<HD>ISP Failures Put E-Mail Into Limbo</HD>
<DH>Internet: Consumer advocates and others are pushing for
stronger laws to protect subscribers, but they face opposition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN KAPLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Steve Donner, a stage manager for Civic Light Opera of South Bay
Cities, relies on electronic mail to keep in touch with producers,
directors and the executive staff of the Redondo Beach theater
company.</LD>
<LD>   So when Excite@Home Corp. abruptly shut down its high-speed
Internet service last month, Donner was suddenly cut off from his
colleagues--not to mention the rest of the global computer network.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm angry," said Donner, who lives in Van Nuys. "There are people
who have my e-mail address from my business card or my online resume
who will try to e-mail me. They won't know that they can't get me by
e-mail."</LD>
<TE>   Donner is one of the more than 12 million customers who have been
separated from their e-mail addresses since the technology meltdown
began in mid-2000.</TE>
<TE>   Now that e-mail addresses are becoming as critical as phone
numbers, some consumers and government regulators are looking for
ways to ensure that they don't simply disappear when Internet access
providers run out of money.</TE>
<TE>   "With all of this constant disruption of small companies going
under and big companies devouring others, what are the rights of the
consumer?" said Casey Corr, a former Internet executive in Seattle
whose e-mail address was a casualty of the Excite@Home meltdown.</TE>
<TE>   "They tell us the service is important to your life, and then when
it goes out they say, 'We'll give you a day's refund.' Well, wait a
minute. If it's essential, give us more," Corr said.</TE>
<TE>   Due to the quirks of history, customers who rely on traditional
phone networks for their Internet service enjoy more government
protection than those who get access via cable, satellite or other
technologies.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Communications Commission is looking into rewriting
its rules so that the consumer protections are uniform, according to
a spokesman in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes no sense at all," said Carl Wood, a member of the
California Public Utilities Commission.</TE>
<TE>   "You have this very fragmented regulatory environment, and so the
regulations can't be very effective. There should be some service
guarantees and some assurances to customers," Wood said.</TE>
<TE>   Current law requires phone companies to give at least 30 days'
notice to state regulators before they can shut down their networks.</TE>
<TE>   That's to ensure that customers have plenty of time to switch to a
new service provider, notify friends, family and business associates
about the change, and, if necessary, print up new business cards and
office stationery, said Scott McCollough, legal counsel for the Texas
Internet Service Providers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   But that law didn't prevent a bankrupt NorthPoint Communications
from abruptly shutting down its network last year, after a judge
approved the sale of the company's assets to AT&amp;T for $135 million.</TE>
<TE>   Internet service providers such as MSN.net, Telocity and MegaPath
relied on NorthPoint for high-speed digital subscriber lines, and
they in turn cut off access to nearly 120,000 customers from Los
Angeles to New York.</TE>
<TE>   In response, the California PUC ordered NorthPoint to turn its
network back on so that 40,000 customers in the state could make an
orderly migration to alternate ISPs. But it did little good. By then,
NorthPoint had already run out of cash and laid off most of its
staff.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators in other states, including Texas and New York, worked
with NorthPoint and other service providers to move as many customers
as possible from the ailing network to a healthier one.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bankruptcy Court was trying to protect the [NorthPoint]
creditors, and the [regulators] were trying to protect the
consumers," said Donna Nelson Geiger, the lead attorney on the
NorthPoint case at the Texas Public Utilities Commission.</TE>
<TE>   "Those goals were somewhat divergent, so it involved a balancing
act. We could have required them to stay in business, but it's not
clear how you'd do that," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer advocates argue that stronger protection laws would help.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Kushnick, executive director of the New Networks Institute
in New York, has drafted a bill of rights for e-mail users. It
includes the right to keep a long-standing e-mail address even if an
ISP goes out of business. There's also a guarantee that e-mail sent
to a defunct address will be forwarded to a new address for six
months, similar to the grace period that follows the introduction of
a new telephone area code.</TE>
<TE>   But ordering a bankrupt ISP to stay in business "is like telling
the heart attack patient not to die until everybody's ready for him,"
said David Robertson, vice president of the Texas ISP Assn. in
Bastrop, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a free market," said Robertson, who is strongly opposed
to regulating Internet service. "It could be a selling point for ISPs
to talk about how they keep everything backed up and will allow
automatic e-mail forwarding and retrieval under any conditions."</TE>
<TE>   Mustering the support to pass new laws aimed at protecting
Internet users will be tough, because "it's become almost like a
religious crusade to keep the Internet unregulated," said CPUC
Commissioner Wood. But if telecom failures continue to leave e-mail
addicts stranded in 2002, consumers may begin to change their minds.</TE>
<TE>   "When they lose their Internet service for a couple of weeks,"
Wood said, "then they turn to us and say, 'Where were you regulators?
Why were you asleep when all this was happening?'"</TE>

<HD>Digital Forecasting Units Can Be as Unpredictable as the
Weather</HD>
<DH>Sometimes looking out the window is more reliable than
reading these instruments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Weather is usually boring in Southern California--haze in the
morning, sun in the afternoon, no precipitation and a layer of fog
and smog to hide mountains and other land forms.</LD>
<LD>   But that all changes in the mid-winter months when we
traditionally get rain showers, hail and the kind of crisp,
brilliantly clear days that made this area a promised land to
weather-weary East Coasters.</LD>
<LD>   This is about the only time of year when a home weather station is
of interest, even in this era of instant weather reports and
forecasts on the Internet.</LD>
<TE>   Southern California is made up of so many mini-climes--some
separated by only a few city blocks--that personal weather
instruments can provide meaningful information.</TE>
<TE>   And in this digital era, a home setup can provide not only
readings of the current temperature and humidity, but also process
barometric pressure data to produce a short-term forecast.</TE>
<TE>   Two companies that make digital gadgets--La Crosse Technology
(www.lacrosse technology.com) and Oregon Scientific
(www.oregonscientific.com)--sell compact home weather stations for
about $100.</TE>
<TE>   The basic readout units are upright, tastefully designed devices
that could fit the decor of just about any desk that harbors a
computer. They also could go nicely on a kitchen countertop, window
ledge or alcove, or even a bedroom nightstand.</TE>
<TE>   Both units tested came with alarm clocks controlled via radio
waves by a government atomic clock. They also came with wireless,
supposedly weatherproof sensors that can be attached to fences,
balcony railings and other outdoor structures for monitoring outside
conditions.</TE>
<TE>   The big question: Are these little weather stations toys or
reasonably scientific instruments? Last weekend's rainstorm offered a
chance to find out.</TE>
<TE>   Setting up both models--the La Crosse WS-7078UF and Oregon
Scientific BAR112HGA--seemed deceptively simple. The temptation was
to pop batteries into the main units and sensors, and then start
playing junior weather forecaster.</TE>
<TE>   I learned the hard way to follow the directions, step by step. For
example, the batteries should go first into the wireless sensor and
then the main unit if they are to make a solid radio connection.</TE>
<TE>   Also, in perusing the La Crosse manual I discovered that the
forecast indicator on this type of unit works by monitoring trends in
barometric pressure, so it isn't of much use until it sits in one
spot for at least 12 hours. Taking the unit up or down even one floor
in a building will affect barometric pressure readings, throwing the
forecast off.</TE>
<TE>   The clocks can be adjusted manually, but for exact settings they
are supposed to align themselves via radio signals overnight.</TE>
<TE>   The La Crosse unit picked up the radio signals nicely but the
Oregon Scientific never did, indicating the signal was too weak where
it sat (right next to the La Crosse). This was especially odd because
a nearby radio-controlled alarm clock also from Oregon Scientific has
picked up the signal nightly for more than a year.</TE>
<TE>   The La Crosse outdoor sensor attached easily to a wood fence with
a couple of provided screws. Once in place, a plastic hat went over
the sensor to protect it from rain. The Oregon Scientific sensor was
more problematic to mount as the company did not provide screws.</TE>
<TE>   By Saturday morning, both the main units and sensors had been in
place for more than 12 hours. The La Crosse readout panel included
both the indoor and outdoor data.</TE>
<TE>   The Oregon Scientific front panel showed only the indoor
readings--a button had to be pushed to get the outdoor data. Score
one for La Crosse.</TE>
<TE>   There was little difference between the units in their temperature
readings. If they varied, it was usually by less than a degree.</TE>
<TE>   Relatively humidity was another story. The readings would often
vary by 10 or more percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   I tended to trust the Oregon Scientific readings more, because
when the rain came down in buckets it was showing 98% outdoor
humidity while the La Crosse showed a suspiciously low 84%.</TE>
<TE>   The forecast mode was the most problematic. On Saturday afternoon,
the La Crosse unit was predicting partly cloudy skies with clearer
weather on the way. It finally started to predict rain on Sunday at 6
a.m., but by late morning was back to its partly cloudy forecast.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday afternoon, the Oregon Scientific unit predicted rain,
but it also began to lose a bit of confidence Sunday about 9 a.m.,
when it also began forecasting partly cloudy.</TE>
<TE>   The rainfall began with sprinkles Sunday at 11 a.m. and was in
full storm mode by midafternoon. By 5 p.m., the National Weather
Service issued a "Special Weather Statement" to warn against effects
of the storm.</TE>
<TE>   The Oregon Scientific unit did a bit better in forecasting the
rain. But it lost major points when, in the middle of the storm, the
link between its outdoor sensor and main unit failed. I reestablished
it briefly with a manual restart but then the link quit.</TE>
<TE>   I brought the sensor inside, opened it up and discovered that
water had seeped inside. Once dried off it began working again, but
it's an obvious drawback for an outdoor sensor if it falters during a
rainstorm.</TE>
<TE>   Both weather stations had good and bad aspects. The La Crosse main
unit was easier to read and its outdoor sensor weathered the storm,
but it didn't do quite as good a job in foreseeing the wet weather.</TE>
<TE>   The Oregon Scientific did better at forecasting, but it lost
points when its outdoor sensor got soggy. Also, its radio clock never
successfully caught the atomic clock signals.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to give either of them a passing grade, except on looks.</TE>

<LD>There are dozens of software programs to help children develop
learning skills, but they are often costly.</LD>
<LD>   The Internet, however, offers a number of educational Web sites
that parents can access for free or a minimal fee.</LD>
<LD>   Two such sites, StoryPlus and Sesame Street Music Zone, debuted
late last year and help children with reading and music.</LD>
<TE>   StoryPlus</TE>
<TE>   StoryPlus features original fiction for children ages 2 to 15.</TE>
<TE>   Designed to promote literacy, the site--founded by Jean Chalopin,
creator of Inspector Gadget--offers stories in text, illustrated text
and animated forms at www.storyplus.com.</TE>
<TE>   Text and illustrated stories can be downloaded as PDF files or
printed from the site.</TE>
<TE>   Animated stories--such as "The Princess and the Pea Test 10024B,"
one author's take on the children's classic--can be downloaded or
sent via e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   As a narrator reads the story, characters move on an illustrated
book page. The accompanying text changes color when each word is
spoken.</TE>
<TE>   Children can access half a dozen stories free. The remaining
stories, updated monthly, cost about $1 each.</TE>
<TE>   The site also offers subscriptions via e-mail. Receive one story a
month for one year or two stories a month for six months for $18.</TE>
<TE>   Stories are offered in English and French.</TE>
<TE>   Before they are posted online, all of the stories on the site are
reviewed by a group of children who vote on their favorites. Those
that do not receive high enough ratings are dropped.</TE>
<TE>   "We apply the rules of television and video games to children's
literature," Chalopin said. "It's a competitive world. We want to
make sure the children like [the stories]."</TE>
<TE>   The StoryPlus Network, of which the site is a part, was
established by Chalopin last year to promote literacy worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Sesame Street</TE>
<TE>   A recent addition to Sesame Street's Web site promotes music
education for children ages 3 to 6.</TE>
<TE>   Although most children are not exposed to music until elementary
school--or sometimes even high school--studies have shown that music
plays a key role in brain development, said Joe Lamond, president and
chief executive of the NAMM-International Music Products Assn., which
collaborated with Sesame Street to produce Music Zone.</TE>
<TE>   The site, which can be found at www.sesamestreet.com, is broken
down into four sections.</TE>
<TE>   In Musical Places, children can visit the city, farm, harbor or
orchestra and learn to associate sounds with the animals and objects
that produce them.</TE>
<TE>   Song Bites teaches children that songs are composed of bars of
music.</TE>
<TE>   When Cookie Monster takes a bite out of a song, the child must
determine which bar should replace it so the song plays correctly.</TE>
<TE>   In Global Groove, Oscar the Grouch plays a jukebox of instruments
from around the world, banjo to bagpipe.</TE>
<TE>   And at the Sesame Street Opera, children can create their own
stage performance. Choose a setting for the opera--Egypt, the desert
or a medieval castle--and determine the order in which the characters
will perform.</TE>
<TE>   Once the choreography is complete, the child can watch the three
acts unfold on the computer screen.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to exploring the musical activities, parents can
request a "Music Works" video, available in both English and Spanish,
at the site as part of Sesame Street's three-year music education
initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Access to the online features and video is free.</TE>

<LD>Voice-Activated System</LD>
<LD>   If you work at home and use Microsoft Outlook, a $300 product
called ArialPhone might make life easier. The odd-looking setup
combines digital cordless phone technology, voice-activated dialing
and computer software that can quickly grab phone numbers.</LD>
<LD>   To make it work, you connect a mini-base station to your computer,
load software onto your computer and plug the mini-base station into
a phone line. You use a wireless headset to issue verbal commands to
ArialPhone.</LD>
<TE>   A typical exchange might go like this: You say, "Call Jim Smith,"
and ArialPhone asks, "Do you want to call Jim Smith?" If you say yes,
ArialPhone would say, "At which location do you want to call Jim
Smith, home or mobile?" When you answer, it dials the number.</TE>
<TE>   The voice recognition technology is not perfect, and ArialPhone
admits that upfront. To remedy that, you can customize ArialPhone by
typing in phonetic spellings for difficult names.</TE>

<HD>Welcome Back 'Wolfenstein'</HD>
<DH>Latest iteration of what was once a simplistic adventure
for the Apple II seals series' spot in gaming canon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AARON CURTISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are sacred places in the video game world--imaginary realms
that intrigue and confound players long after they leave.</LD>
<LD>   The ethereal islands of Myst.</LD>
<LD>   The mysterious glades of Norrath.</LD>
<TE>   And the treacherous corridors of Castle Wolfenstein.</TE>
<TE>   Few could have predicted the long-term impact of "Castle
Wolfenstein" when it debuted in 1983 as a primitive World War II
adventure on the Apple II. Nearly a decade later, though,
"Wolfenstein 3D" for the PC changed forever the way video games are
designed and played.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, gamers could immerse themselves in a world
that felt completely three dimensional. "Wolfenstein 3D" may not have
been the first first-person shooter, but it's the one that stuck and
became the Abraham of the genre.</TE>
<TE>   That was almost 10 years ago, and the latest version, "Return to
Castle Wolfenstein" for the PC, demonstrates the vitality of in
first-person action games. "Return to Castle Wolfenstein" is more
than a simple sequel. It's a complete rethinking of the game. And
it's the first truly three-dimensional experience in the series.</TE>
<TE>   "Return to Castle Wolfenstein" is two distinct games--a
single-player adventure and a multi-player melee. In the
single-player aspect of the game, players are dropped deep within the
bowels of a Nazi stronghold and must blast their way out. The
multi-player game requires teamwork and coordination of squads that
square off as Nazi or Allied soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, the game excels at smothering players with a creepy
ambience. The gloomy castles and forbidding landscapes turn players
all around and push them into dead-ends crawling with Nazi goons.</TE>
<TE>   Every piece of the game is interactive. Food on tables can be
eaten to replenish health. Windows can be shot out. Equipment can be
broken or damaged. Doors can be kicked in. The ability to manipulate
even mundane objects gives "Return to Castle Wolfenstein" a realistic
depth.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than just run and gun through the castle, players explore
it and learn its many secrets.</TE>
<TE>   Play begins in 1943 as Army Ranger B.J. Blazkowicz, trapped in the
dungeon of Castle Wolfenstein. Blazkowicz has been sent into enemy
territory to uncover a Nazi plot to resurrect an army of undead
warriors. SS chief Heinrich Himmler has dispatched troops to uncover
the ancient prison of an occult warrior, which he plans to call into
service of the Third Reich.</TE>
<TE>   So the corridors of Castle Wolfenstein teem not only with German
troops but also with scores of zombies and hideous mutants, the
unfortunate byproducts of Himmler's experiments. None are very nice.
But some are smarter than others and the game's artificial
intelligence endows its characters with surprisingly skillful
tactics.</TE>
<TE>   Like Kenny Rogers' gambler, these shock troops seem to know when
to hold a position and when to fold up and run. When a lone soldier
is staring down the business end of a machine gun, he tends to think
first about his digital hide and scurry away screaming something in
German. But when his buddies are with him, that same coward turns
into a relentless uber-Nazi.</TE>
<TE>   In multi-player mode, "Return to Castle Wolfenstein" forces
players to work together as squads to achieve a variety of
objectives--from stealing enemy documents to seizing and controlling
key territory.</TE>
<TE>   Squads are divided into four player classes: soldier, engineer,
medic and lieutenant. Each has distinct capabilities. Engineers, for
instance, blow stuff up. Lieutenants can call in airstrikes and
resupply troops with ammunition. The balance of attributes and
talents creates a team in which every member is necessary.</TE>
<TE>   But it raises an interesting dilemma: Who would want to play as
the Nazis? Unlike other games of the ilk, which create fictional
factions, "Return to Castle Wolfenstein" draws its characters from a
brutal period of history. Playing as a Nazi is like remaking "Raiders
of the Lost Ark" with Indiana Jones as a pesky intruder.</TE>
<TE>   The game makes no value judgments. The two sides are equally
matched. One of them just happens to be Hitler's goons.</TE>
<TE>   Whether over the Internet or a network, the "Return to Castle
Wolfenstein" takes squad-based combat to new levels of excellence.
The multi-player elements were designed from the ground up as the
game was being developed.</TE>
<TE>   The dual experiences of "Return to Castle Wolfenstein" give the
game a life beyond the standard one-time walkthrough. True to its
roots, "Return to Castle Wolfenstein" expands on the franchise and
refines the relatively tired genre of first-person shooters. Rather
than desecrate the sacredness of its name, as so many updates tend to
do, "Wolfenstein" further cements the place in the gaming
consciousness.</TE>

<HD>Palm Pales Compared With New PDA Rivals</HD>
<DH>The still-leading firm's sparing use of color is at least
part of the reason it's been losing market share.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN KAPLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Palm Inc. essentially created the market for personal digital
assistants with its Palm Pilot hand-held computer. Now the pioneering
company risks falling behind its competitors because of its
lackluster use of color.</LD>
<LD>   It's been nearly two years since Palm introduced its first model
with a color screen, the Palm IIIc. But PDAs made by rivals have
chipped away at Palm's dominance by incorporating color in useful and
innovative ways.</LD>
<LD>   Color screens are increasingly common in PDAs. In 2000, the year
color screens debuted, nearly 11% of the 2.8 million hand-helds sold
in the U.S. had color screens. Among the 3 million PDAs sold last
year through November, the proportion nearly doubled to 21%,
according to market research service NPDTechworld. When December
sales are factored in, the proportion of color PDAs probably will be
even higher, said Stephen Baker, director of research for
NPDTechworld.</LD>
<TE>   In the meantime, Palm's share of the market has slipped from 84%
in January 2000 to 60% in November 2001, the most recent month for
which statistics are available, NPDTechworld said.</TE>
<TE>   All of the current devices running Microsoft's PocketPC operating
system--including Compaq Computer's iPaq, Hewlett-Packard's Jornada
and Casio's E-200--have color screens. Among Palm's offerings, only
the IIIc and the 10-month-old m505 sport color, and they don't make
the most of it.</TE>
<TE>   "They're using it effectively, but it's not as effective as it
could be," said Aaron Marcus, an expert in designing graphical user
interfaces for computerized products. "For the most part, the things
that I see used are still just minimal."</TE>
<TE>   Upgrading from a monochromatic Palm Vx to a full-color m505 should
be like throwing out a black-and-white television set and replacing
it with a Sony Trinitron. Instead, it's like watching an episode of
"I Love Lucy" and seeing color only in the opening credits, said
Roman Longoria, who runs the mobile applications group of Bay Chi, a
Silicon Valley organization of usability engineers and human-computer
interaction experts.</TE>
<TE>   Palm representatives did not return calls to discuss the company's
use of color.</TE>
<TE>   Desktop computers have made color an indispensable part of the
user interface. On a PDA screen, with smaller icons and more
potential for clutter, color could be even more useful.</TE>
<TE>   "Color is a way to highlight things that are important and pull
people's eyes in certain directions," said Elizabeth Rosenzweig,
president of the Chicago-based Usability Professionals Assn.</TE>
<TE>   But that doesn't mean more color is necessarily better.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't use color in a thoughtful way, it could be very
misleading and very confusing," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Among usability experts, the mantra regarding color is "less is
more." Although new hand-held screens can display tens of thousands
of colors, research shows that most people can keep track of just
three to seven colors in their short-term memory. Besides, only three
colors--red, yellow and green--have widely recognized meanings.</TE>
<TE>   "The red-yellow-green of a stoplight is universal around the
world," Marcus said. "Red means there's something that very much
needs your attention. Yellow is a warning that something might need
your attention. Green means everything is OK."</TE>
<TE>   When two events in a Palm Date Book overlap, the conflict is
flagged with a red line. But it is so thin that it's barely
noticeable, which essentially defeats the purpose, Marcus said. A
better use of color, he said, would be to tag work-related meetings
with one hue and personal appointments with another.</TE>
<TE>   Palm's Address program uses color even more sparingly. The only
substitute for black and white is the dark blue used to emphasize the
title bar at the top of the screen and to highlight a selected entry.</TE>
<TE>   Considering that Palm's goal is to persuade consumers to spend $50
to $70 more for models with color screens, "the native Palm
applications could be a little more effective in using color,"
Longoria said.</TE>
<TE>   But Palm isn't solely to blame for the lack of colorful programs.
The independent companies that create programs for PDAs also have
been loath to invest in redesigns.</TE>
<TE>   Vindigo Inc., the New York company that makes a popular program to
help users find places to eat, shop and play, hasn't done so because
"only a minority of Palm devices in circulation support color," Chief
Executive Jason Devitt said. "If we're not going to just colorize
applications but are really going to rework them, there has to be a
significant number of users to be worth it."</TE>
<TE>   The version of Vindigo made for PocketPCs sports full-color maps
and other enhancements because "every single PocketPC is in color,"
he said. As for the Palm hand-helds, "we were a little disappointed
with the way color looks on those devices."</TE>

<LD>Apple's new Mac OS X operating system has been ready to handle
business tasks for some time, thanks largely to the arrival of
Microsoft's Office version X for Mac in November.</LD>
<LD>   But until recently, OS X hasn't been up to the needs of two
markets that are Mac strongholds: video editing, and music and audio
production. Programs in these categories must be able to communicate
with external gear--video decks, camcorders, music
synthesizers--without skipping a beat or a video frame.</LD>
<LD>   Mac OS X's beefy, Unix-based foundation is ideal for real-time
challenges such as these, but adapting older software to fit that
foundation is a big job.</LD>
<TE>   It's finally happening. Within the last month, two major video
programs have made their Mac OS X debut, as have several audio
programs. For video work, the big news is the arrival of native OS X
versions of Apple's $999 Final Cut Pro and Adobe's $649 After
Effects. Final Cut Pro is a professional-caliber video editing
package that has become extremely popular in TV and film studios.</TE>
<TE>   The new version 3.0 still runs under Mac OS 9, but it purrs under
Mac OS X. Apple has tweaked its user interface only slightly--version
3.0 uses OS X's gumdrop-like window controls, but Apple wisely
avoided the temptation to add visually distracting gewgaws.</TE>
<TE>   The new version brings far more than just OS X compatibility. On a
well-endowed system--a Power Mac G4 with a 500-megahertz or faster
processor and at least 384 megabytes of memory--Final Cut Pro
displays common video effects in real time. In previous versions, you
had to either twiddle your thumbs while rendering an effect or buy
expensive third-party acceleration hardware.</TE>
<TE>   Final Cut Pro's real-time talents also shine on the
top-of-the-line, 667MHz PowerBook G4. A 5-pound, 1-inch-thick,
titanium-clad video editing workstation with real-time effects: Pinch
me.</TE>
<TE>   Other Final Cut Pro 3 additions include superb color-correction
filters and something Apple calls OfflineRT. Oversimplified, it's a
way of squeezing massive amounts of video onto a hard drive in
low-resolution form for editing. When you've finished editing, you
choose a few commands, and Final Cut Pro grabs your video at high
resolution and applies your edits.</TE>
<TE>   As for Adobe After Effects, the new version 5.5 builds on the 3-D
animation features that debuted in version 5. The After Effects
Production Bundle, a $1,499 version aimed at film and video pros, can
even swap data with Alias-Wavefront's Maya 3D software--which also is
available for Mac OS X.</TE>
<TE>   In the music and audio realm, the progress hasn't been quite as
dramatic, but things are sounding better. At the National Assn. of
Music Manufacturers convention in Anaheim this month, several
developers showed off OS X versions of their wares.</TE>
<TE>   Propellerhead Software soon will be delivering OS X versions of
its software, including its flagship program, Reason, which combines
recording and sound synthesis and is particularly popular in the
techno-dance worlds.</TE>
<TE>   Bitheadz also demonstrated an OS X version of its Unity 3 Session
software, which turns a Mac into a synthesizer and audio sampler.
Emagic said it would ship the OS X version of its Logic Audio
sequencer software by month's end.</TE>
<TE>   Some OS X audio products are shipping now. Germany-based Ableton
has shipped Live, an ingenious software-based instrument aimed at
live performance.</TE>
<TE>   Bias has delivered its Peak DV audio editor; it's included with
Final Cut Pro 3. And TC Works is shipping two audio editors: the
$19.95 Spark LE and the free (though still quite capable) Spark ME.</TE>
<TE>   Many media producers will need to stay with or occasionally return
to OS 9 until the software plug-ins and other utilities they rely on
become available for OS X. But the pieces are falling into place.</TE>

<DH>The 'Madden' video football game, updated annually, has
become a sure winner for Electronic Arts and a big source of income
for the NFL.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Over its 12-year history, the "Madden" franchise has pulled in more
than $1 billion in revenue for its maker, Electronic Arts Inc.,
making it the most popular football video game ever. The franchise is
so ubiquitous that it's become the second-largest source of licensing
income for the National Football League, after apparel.</LD>
<LD>   Video games are unlikely to supplant live football in either
revenue or fan base. But increasingly realistic and intelligent games
blur the line between sport and simulation. Fox Television, for
example, uses "Madden" to demonstrate plays during broadcasts of NFL
games. NFL players spend hours at a time tossing virtual footballs
after they're through practicing the real thing.</LD>
<LD>   For some football fans, particularly younger viewers, the video
game is more engaging than the real thing. So for the NFL, "Madden"
and other licensed games such as Sega Corp.'s "NFL2K" have become not
only a convenient and reliable source of revenue, but also an
important tool for cultivating new generations of fans.</LD>
<TE>   "That's one thing pro football has to watch out for--they're not
getting young kids," said John Madden, the colorful TV commentator
and former Raiders coach who agreed to lend his name and expertise to
the franchise in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   "If you get a kid, say between 8 and 15, he'll be more of a video
game fan than a fan of football," Madden said. "It used to be that
kids learned about football by playing it in the park or in their
backyard. Now kids learn about it by playing the video game."</TE>
<TE>   That's certainly true for Russ Beaudin and his 9-year-old son,
Grey.</TE>
<TE>   "He likes to watch the real sport on TV and immediately afterward
play the video game," said Beaudin, an Oakland architect. "It's like
he's comparing notes. It's definitely improved his understanding and
participation in the sport."</TE>
<TE>   Making a credible football game is not easy, and the field is
littered with failed attempts. At best, a game would rocket to the
top of the charts one year, but fail to score the next. Only two
studios have consistently put out hit games: --Visual Concepts of San
Rafael, Calif., which develops the "NFL2K" series; and Electronic
Arts Tiburon, which makes "Madden."</TE>
<TE>   The process is grueling and labor-intensive. Every NFL player must
be accurately depicted, right down to his facial hairs. Each team has
its own playbook programmed with dozens of signature plays, and each
play has hundreds of variations. Actual stadiums are modeled into the
games, and even the fields' turf types affect how the football
bounces. Uniforms get muddier as the game progresses.</TE>
<TE>   The animation and the environments are so lifelike that it's not
uncommon for people to mistake the video game for a TV broadcast. Put
it all together, and the video game sometimes can be as engrossing as
the real one.</TE>
<TE>   "Every year, it gets more realistic," said Johnnie Morton, a wide
receiver for the Detroit Lions and an avid video-game player. Like
most players, Morton plays himself in the games. "At first, the
characters were almost cartoonish. Now their facial expressions
change. There are wrinkles in their jerseys. They get injured. It's
almost like the real thing."</TE>
<TE>   Madden recalls a time in San Francisco when a Philadelphia Eagles
player rushed into a hotel room asking, "Where's Madden?" When people
pointed to the Fox commentator, the player said, "No, not that
Madden. I want the game!"</TE>
<TE>   Football video games haven't always been sophisticated. In the
1980s, stick figures were the norm. Then in 1986, Electronic Arts
founder Trip Hawkins talked John Madden into working on a video game.
Because Madden disliked flying, Hawkins worked with him during a
series of train rides as the announcer traveled between games.</TE>
<TE>   The result was "John Madden Football," released in 1989 for the
Apple II computer. Since then, each successive game has sported
ever-greater graphical and technological improvements.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, EA hired Visual Concepts to make a version of "Madden"
for the Nintendo Super NES console. In 1996, Visual Concepts decided
to make its own football game and developed "NFL2K" for Sega's
now-discontinued Dreamcast console.</TE>
<TE>   Its debut in 1999 elicited kudos from fans for its rich game play,
and its ultra-realistic graphics drew double-takes from people who
had never played video games. Sega has sold more than 2 million
copies of the "NFL2K" series. "Madden" is critical to the business of
EA, the world's largest independent game publisher. In 2001, sales of
"Madden" games totaled more than $186million, up from $64million in
1995, according to Credit Suisse First Boston. Not bad for a title
that costs $5million to $10million each year to develop.</TE>
<TE>   That figure, of course, does not cover marketing and licensing
costs. The NFL takes a percentage of retail sales (typically 5% to
10% of gross sales), as does Madden himself. Console manufacturers
also get a slice, generally $5 to $7 for every disc sold. In
December, the average retail price for "Madden 2002" was $48,
according to NPDFunworld, a market research firm in New York.</TE>
<TE>   EA still earns a substantial profit margin on the title, which
accounts for 10% to 15% of the Redwood City, Calif., company's annual
revenue, according to EA President John Riccitiello. Year after year,
millions of game players buy new copies of "Madden" to get the latest
NFL player rosters and team statistics, ensuring a rock-steady stream
of sales for EA.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very profitable business," Riccitiello said. "It's not an
extraordinarily expensive game to produce, but it is an extraordinary
game."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This month, MTV announced a deal to start selling an $1,800 PC
bearing its hip "M" logo. The machine is standard fare with a few
extra goodies designed to lure 18-to-24-year-olds: a DVD drive, a TV
and radio tuner, a drive for burning CDs and a fast Athlon processor.</LD>
<LD>   So, what does MTV know about making computers? Not a thing. And
that's the point.</LD>
<LD>   Computer makers have tried to win the hearts and minds of buyers
for 20 years by battling over every little technical improvement,
from graphical interfaces to easy-open cases. Today, however, most
computers are just like every other computer. They are practically as
interchangeable as paper clips, bottled water or toilet paper.</LD>
<TE>   That's why style has become the new battleground.</TE>
<TE>   MTV probably won't sell enough to make Dell sweat. But the idea of
creating designer computers marks a milestone of sorts for the PC. It
underscores the degree to which computers are moving away from the
office and toward the home, where style is king.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that MTV makes a PC is another way of saying that the
computer has assumed such a familiar place in the family that it is
now worthy of personalization. It strikes at the heart of the human
need to accessorize.</TE>
<TE>   These computers herald a new era of hominess, but they also
underscore the depressing reality that little progress has been made
on what is arguably the most critical problem facing modern
computing--complexity.</TE>
<TE>   One of MTV's main goals is to pre-assemble a variety of computer
components so that consumers don't have to fiddle with the gear
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Gateway also has joined the bundling bandwagon. Last week, the
struggling PC maker introduced a new "EverQuest" computer bundle,
which packages the popular online role-playing game and a GeForce2
video card with a standard Pentium 4 computer.</TE>
<TE>   The "EverQuest" bundle is a nice marketing coup for both Gateway
and Sony Online Entertainment, the maker of "EverQuest." But why does
Gateway think consumers will buy a special computer just because it
has a video card and some software pre-installed?</TE>
<TE>   Because it's true. Installation and configuration are the twin
devils of computing, surpassed only by the messy demons of
uninstallation and upgrade.</TE>
<TE>   For as much as computer components have become a commodity, no one
has yet figured out how to make them work together in a way that
remotely resembles the ease of hooking up a stereo, an answering
machine or even the dreaded VCR.</TE>
<TE>   These new computers entirely miss the point. The real issue isn't
style, but simplicity.</TE>
<TE>   The fact is that most designer computers have passed quietly into
history. Gateway discontinued its Blue's Clues computer a few years
ago. The Barbie PC and the Hot Wheels PC, made by Patriot Computer,
also are gone.</TE>
<TE>   Few people even remember that supermodel Claudia Schiffer tried to
sell a special-edition Palm Vx hand-held, whose main attribute was
its aqua-colored case.</TE>
<TE>   The only company that has made real progress in turning the
computer into a home device is Apple. The company's new iMac, shaped
like a large, articulated lamp, is a brave effort at breaking down
the tyranny of the bland beige box and the oppression of having to
install additional hardware and software.</TE>
<TE>   Don't get me wrong. I'm all in favor of Arnold
Schwarzenegger-branded computers with monitors shaped like Conan
helmets, or Britney Spears computers that grunt and groan when you
click.</TE>
<TE>   But somewhere along the line, someone has to realize that winning
the hearts and minds of home users has nothing to do with all this
stuff. PC makers would do well to make their products more like
toilet paper--cheap, simple to use and functional.</TE>

<HD>Picture Your Own Art</HD>
<DH>Photowow.com and other sites can enlarge, restore, enhance,
add special effects to and even frame your pictures with great
results, but the cost is steep.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I've spent many hours playing with photo-editing software--changing
colors, adding decorative borders and designing artistic effects.</LD>
<LD>   So I had low expectations for Photowow.com, an online photo
imaging and printing  services company that also restores, enhances,
adds special effects and even frames artistic renderings of
customers' photographs.</LD>
<LD>   The field has become fairly crowded, as increasing numbers of
consumers turn to digital cameras and photo-editing software. And
like Photowow, dozens of local photo stores, graphic arts companies
and even  Kinko's will produce giant-size blowups of a photo or print
them onto mugs, T-shirts, artists' canvas, mouse pads, pillows or
various other products.On simple enlarging and transferring jobs,
prices are competitive at Photowow, which ships products nationwide.
It also has stores in Brentwood and Encino and an affiliate in
Valencia.</LD>
<TE>   Printing a photo onto an 11-by-14 sheet of semi-gloss paper, for
example, runs $39; putting the same image on canvas, for a painted
look, is $48.</TE>
<TE>   But Photowow also offers higher-priced products and services that
few, if any, of its competitors offer, resulting in art-like finished
pieces that sure wouldn't be confused with a Kinko's print.</TE>
<TE>   Although the average price for a fully designed Photowow piece is
$300, I had no trouble running up a far bigger tab for a  framed
poster-size design featuring my favorite artistic subject, Molly, my
18-month-old wheaten terrier.</TE>
<TE>   My 22-by-22-inch canvas Molly piece, with a  one-time design cost
of $90, a transfer/print onto canvas cost of $96 and large
stretcher-bars frame for $69, meant a finished, ready-to-hang piece
for $255. A Molly mug  and T-shirt  run $15 and $20,
respectively--something one would do with a designed piece only if
already buying something else, because to buy the mug I got, with no
other piece would mean a $90 design fee on top of my $15, giving me a
$105 mug.</TE>
<TE>   A giant 42-by-42 glossy poster, if purchased by itself, would be
$188 unframed or $416 in a 2-inch-deep black frame--$90 for the
design, $98 for the glossy print and $228 for the frame.</TE>
<TE>   Still, for a special-occasion group gift--say, Grandma and
Grandpa's 50th wedding anniversary--it could be worth it. Think of a
restored wedding picture, for example, blown up to 3 feet by 2 feet.
Now imagine it with images of each grandchild placed in the
background and designed to look as though they  had been photographed
together. Or as though they  had been guests at the wedding, or for
that matter, with their faces superimposed onto doves flying
overhead.</TE>
<TE>   The process begins on Photowow's Web site, where customers can use
dozens of sample pieces or design their personalized photo art.
Prices are a combination of the  one-time cost of creating a stylized
design, if there is one, the price of printing the design onto paper,
canvas or other medium and, if a customer wants, a frame. Once a
design is created, Photowow saves it for possible later reprinting.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the design possibilities are particularly cool, including
turning a photo image into a cartoon rendering.</TE>
<TE>   The site also shows examples of merging two pictures. You could
take your family's picture in front of the Glendale Galleria and make
it look as though your group   were gathered before the Eiffel Tower.</TE>
<TE>   I went with Photowow's pop-art series, a la Andy Warhol,
consisting of several frames of the same image, with wild colors as
the only contrast.</TE>
<TE>   With the magic of Photowow, you can choose how many frames will
make up the piece (up to 36), the specific contrasting colors that
will comprise the finished piece and whether the image will be
clearly defined, softly brushed or so on.</TE>
<TE>   Other than a few Web crashes, the tools on Photowow's site were a
terrific help. I simply chose the pop-art example with the colors and
style I liked best--from a special section of pet images--chose
glossy paper as my medium and picked a frame.</TE>
<TE>   I then sent along a snapshot. To fully appreciate Photowow's
ability to turn  my photographic  efforts into art, I chose a shot of
my dog that also contained half of my husband's arm and another
random puppy.</TE>
<TE>   No problem. What I got was a perfectly excised image of Molly's
head, as if the original shot had been a studio-quality close-up, in
my choice of a four-image design, each with different colors.</TE>
<TE>   Most people probably wouldn't spend the couple hundred dollars it
would take to make a smaller version of my new "Molly art." But I'm
thinking my upcoming birthday is a very special occasion.</TE>

saying that she had gotten a "blank message" from me. She went on to
say, "Not sure I know you, but try again if you want."</LD>
<LD>   Is this some kind of junk e-mail scam? Should I send her a return
e-mail to say I had not sent her a message?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Dubious congratulations are in order. You seem to be the
target of a new wrinkle in junk e-mail. It's so new that experts in
the field are not sure of its purpose.</LD>
<TE>   "We first started getting reports about blank message e-mail a few
days ago," said Scott Hazen Mueller, chairman of the Coalition
Against Unsolicited Commercial E-mail. The group runs the
spam.abuse.net Web site that provides information about junk e-mail,
suggestions on how to fight it and updates on legislation concerning
the topic.</TE>
<TE>   He speculated that the e-mail was a scheme to identify legitimate
e-mail addresses. The sender probably sent that message to a huge
number of addresses. "Some of our anti-spammers got it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   If the mail went through, then the spammer knew the address was
legitimate, or "live." Lists of live address can be sold to bulk
e-mailers at a premium.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, if the e-mail resulted in a computer-generated
"bounce back" reply that the address was not valid, it could be
discarded.</TE>
<TE>   "We are still looking into it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, as with all suspected spam, the best policy is not to
reply.</TE>
<TE>   Q: With the continual rate increases from AT&amp;T, MCI WorldCom,
Sprint and other well-known long-distance companies, where should
customers look for good rates?</TE>
<TE>   A: Increasingly, the best long-distance prices come from reliable,
lesser-known carriers such as Capsule Communications, Uni-Tel
Communications and PowerNet Global, or PNG.</TE>
<TE>   These companies don't have the costly marketing and overhead costs
of their larger rivals, so they can charge less and still make a
profit. The baseline cost for a domestic long-distance call is about
3 cents a minute.</TE>
<TE>   Shoppers still must keep an eye on the fine print for charges and
fees. Be sure to check the universal service fee. But the fact that
you've never heard of a company is no longer reason enough not to
consider it.</TE>
<TE>   Long-distance carrier Univance, for example, charges 4.9 cents a
minute for both in-state and interstate long-distance calls, 24 hours
a day, every day. Customers must have a minimum of $3 worth of calls,
and if not, they pay the difference in a fee. The company charges
8.25% for the federal universal service fee (compared with AT&amp;T's
11.5%). It charges for a 30-second call and then bills in six-second
increments.</TE>
<TE>   Taking into account the fees, the rate from Univance is 5.3 cents
a minute.</TE>

<LD>It is quite possibly the last thing you will ever need to buy online.</LD>
<LD>   For those who want to avoid the unpleasant trip to the funeral
home, Internet funeral services offer a range of burial options
online, from pet caskets to mausoleums.</LD>
<LD>   Though perhaps a little impersonal, sites such as www.urnsand
caskets.com  and www.casket andurn.com (yes there is a difference)
may help you with that one purchase that will last for all eternity.</LD>
<TE>   Besides, at least one site (www.richardlamb.com) offers "live
help" in the form of an online chat.</TE>
<TE>   Webcaskets</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest online funeral services, Webcaskets boasts
hundreds of caskets at www.web caskets.com.</TE>
<TE>   Its collection, which starts at $50 for a cardboard cremation
casket and runs to $11,000 for a solid walnut casket with velvet
interior, includes a range of burial options.</TE>
<TE>   Although the site carries traditional caskets, it features a
number of "art caskets," painted caskets that bear such images as the
Last Supper, the Irish flag and the postal stamp "Return to Sender."
One casket, called "Final Lap," depicts a black-and-white checkered
flag waving on cars at a race.</TE>
<TE>   "Cool caskets for cool people," the product description notes.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its name, Webcasksets also sells urns--wood, ceramic,
metal and marble--starting at less than $100. In addition to boasting
discounted casket prices, Webcaskets advertises several special
offers:</TE>
<TE>   * Order a casket and receive a 10% discount on other merchandise
(flowers, markers, etc.) purchased for the same person.</TE>
<TE>   * Buy matching urns and receive a 5% discount.</TE>
<TE>   * And show your AARP membership card and receive a 2% discount.</TE>
<TE>   Based in Newport Beach, Webcaskets does not charge shipping for
most caskets delivered in California. Residents of other states must
pay $45 to $195 depending on location and priority. (Some casket
prices include shipping fees.)</TE>
<TE>   Caskets and urns might be delivered the next day, depending on
availability and shipping destination.</TE>
<TE>   Classic Urns</TE>
<TE>   Although most online funeral services carry a small selection of
urns, some sites specialize in them.</TE>
<TE>   Classic Urns, for example, offers a wide--and somewhat
weird--variety of urns, including those shaped as golf clubs ($799),
a mallard ($799), and cowboy boots ($535).</TE>
<TE>   The site, at www.classicurns .com, includes regular ground
shipping in its urn prices. Overnight shipping is an additional
$49.95 and second-day shipping is an additional $29.95.</TE>
<TE>   Casket Gallery</TE>
<TE>   Casket Gallery boasts more than three dozen caskets for less than
$3,000. As the site advertises, "A funeral doesn't have to bury you
in debt!"</TE>
<TE>   The site, at www.casketgallery .com, also sells urns, most of
which cost less than $1,000.</TE>
<TE>   Shipping costs for caskets vary. Urns cost $15 to ship. In
addition to its merchandise, Casket Gallery includes a "cyberspace
memorial" on the site.</TE>
<TE>   Our Pals</TE>
<TE>   Though the majority of online funeral services handle human
deaths, a number cater specifically to animal deaths.</TE>
<TE>   Our Pals, at www.ourpals.com, offers pet-sized caskets made of
double-walled styrene plastic starting at $76.</TE>
<TE>   Urns, in a variety of materials, start at less than $50.</TE>
<TE>   The company, which began when the owner's Irish setter died,
strives to preserve the image of a beloved pet.</TE>
<TE>   So if the urn with porcelain figurine of Spot (the site offers 90
breeds of dog and cat to choose from) isn't enough, you can send the
company a picture of your pet and an artist will engrave the image on
a wood urn. Or better yet, on an ostrich egg shell.</TE>

<LD>Some of the most fabled rock 'n' roll images involve someone smashing
or setting fire to a guitar, which in some circles ranks as the best
possible use for the instrument. But for those who love guitars as
much for their craftsmanship as their sound, there's GuitarNation at
www.guitarnation.com.</LD>
<LD>   The site has images of guitars, basses and related instruments
from about 60 builders around the world, along with links to the
builders' sites. Instead of such factory-made staples as Fender
Stratocasters, GuitarNation presents only custom and handmade
instruments. Visitors also can hear samples of several of the
guitars, with more on the way.</LD>
<LD>   Granted, not everyone drools at the sight of ivory tuning pegs or
elaborate fingerboard inlays. The point, said site operator Norman L.
Beberman of Newport Beach, is simply to celebrate the art of the
guitar.</LD>
<TE>   Naturally, it's only for those who prefer their guitars intact and
not aflame.</TE>

<LD>Love Scrabble but need lots of practice? At
www.billsgames.com/wordscram you'll find Wordscram, a puzzle that's a
great workout for the Scrabble part of your brain.</LD>
<LD>   Using Java, the computer displays 16 letters it chooses at random.
You then have 60 seconds to make as many words as possible from these
letters. The longer the word, the more points it earns.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to playing solo, you can play Wordscram against as
many as three other humans.</LD>

<LD>Alan Jackson's "Drive," which features the hit single "Where Were You
(When the World Stopped Turning)," is the nation's best-selling album
for the second consecutive week.</LD>
<LD>   The first-ever No. 1 collection for the veteran country singer
sold 230,000 copies last week, 111,000 more than Creed's "Weathered,"
which was the runner-up in the sales race.</LD>
<LD>   The remaining positions in the Top 10 were claimed, in order, by
Linkin Park, Ludacris, Nickelback, Ja Rule, Nas, Usher, Pink and the
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?" soundtrack. The nation's best-selling
single continues to be B2K's "Un Huh."</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, several albums are continuing to show staying power in
a time when fan loyalty seems to be a vanishing quality in pop music.</TE>
<TE>   Seven albums in the Top 70 this week have sold more than 2 million
copies and have been on the charts for at least 30 weeks. They are,
in order of their current position on the chart, Linkin Park's
"Hybrid Theory" (66 weeks on the chart, 5.9 million sales), the "O
Brother" soundtrack (57 weeks, 3.7 million), Enya's "A Day Without
Rain" (62 weeks, 5.6 million), Alicia Keys' "Songs in A Minor" (31
weeks, 4.4 million), Staind's "Break the Cycle" (36 weeks, 4.4
million), Jennifer Lopez's "J.Lo" (53 weeks, 3.1 million) and U2's
"All That You Can't Leave Behind" (65 weeks, 3.4 million).</TE>

<LD>   Founded in 1974, Ailey II is a 12-dancer ensemble that not only
tours in places that have never seen the larger Alvin Ailey American
Dance Theatre, but also develops its own repertory. In Malibu, the
company is dancing a suite of Ailey excerpts (highlights of "Blues
Suite," "Streams," "Hidden Rites," "Isba" and "Escapades"), plus
three works created since the turn of the century. Scott Rink's "Full
On Night" uses music by PJ Harvey, Darrell Grand Moultrie's "Aspects
of a Vibe," is set to a Tito Puente remix, and Robert Battle's
"Takademe" develops what the New York Times called "a savvy
deconstruction of Indian Kathak dance rhythms" from recordings by
Sheila Chandra.</LD>

<TE>   The intensity that Al Pacino is so well known for in his
30-year-plus film career is on display in two roles that find him on
opposite sides of the law. First up, Pacino plays an undercover cop
who blows the whistle on police corruption in Sidney Lumet's 1973
drama "Serpico." Based on Peter Maas' nonfiction book and adapted by
Waldo Salt and Norman Wexler, the film confirmed stardom for Pacino,
who lets us watch a man undergoing changes, from the idealistic (but
not really naive) rookie to the embattled loner whose sin is that he
refused to take his cut of the precinct's monthly collections. In
"Scarface," Brian DePalma's 1983 remake of the Howard Hawks-Ben Hecht
gangster classic, Pacino growls through his role as a drug-smuggling
Cuban refugee living la vida loca in Miami. Oliver Stone wrote the
screenplay, a savage inversion of the American dream.</TE>
<TE>   Al Pacino double feature, New Beverly Cinema, 7165 Beverly Blvd.,

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Love is something you go into with your eyes wide open and come out
of with your eyes swollen shut," observes our caustic guide at a chic
Ritz-Carlton wedding in Fritz Coleman's seriocomic monologue, "The
Reception," at the Victory Theatre in Burbank.</LD>
<LD>   Providing wry commentary on romance and other natural disasters is
a perfect fit for the sharp-witted Coleman, best known as a local TV
weatherman.</LD>
<LD>   With assured, well-timed delivery, Coleman's character snipes
amusingly from the sidelines at the foibles not only of the bride and
groom (both refugees from previous marriages), but of their assembled
families and ex-spouses as well. From the bride's bitter mother,
who's "often mistaken for the ice sculpture," to the groom's sister
with "husband du jour" in tow, Coleman's narrator chronicles a
cross-section of contemporary relationships in a succession of quick
sketches. Larry Kline's skillful direction sustains focus and pacing
throughout.</LD>
<TE>   Although Coleman is the only onstage performer, he employs a
projected "photo album" to flesh out the other 18 characters (showing
perfectly cast actors in typical reception poses)--an ingenious
conceit that appropriately furthers the wedding theme.</TE>
<TE>   Compared with Coleman's previous solo piece ("It's Me! Dad!"),
"The Reception" is a more formal affair, in concept as well as
staging. Both works rely heavily on Coleman's facility with clever
aphorisms. "The Reception" is a work of pure fiction in which the
narrator seems to have no personal stake. That changes in a dramatic
pivotal revelation, which Coleman's poker face allows him to pull off
with maximum effect.</TE>
<TE>   Still, reserving it for the finale turns most of the show into a
relationship-themed stand-up routine--a consistently clever one, but
not the most judicious pitch to emotional involvement. Playwriting,
like marriage, is all about balance and compromises.</TE>
<TE>   "The Reception," Victory Theatre, 3326 Victory Blvd., Burbank.
Saturdays-Sundays, 8 p.m. Ends Feb. 23. $20. (818) 841-5421. Running
time: 1 hour, 25 minutes.</TE>

<HD>The Viper Is Loaded for Good Times</HD>
<DH>Duff McKagan's new band and Dayle Gloria have the room
rockin'.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>So there I was at the Viper Room, sitting in a booth reserved for
Scott Weiland and Billy Idol (oi!), when Duff McKagan and his new
band Loaded took the stage. In a week of amazing rock shows, Loaded
takes the cake. Despite being famous for Guns N' Roses, Duff's best
years may still lie ahead.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking of the Viper Room, I have excellent news for the world:
As of this week, Dayle Gloria is booking the Viper full time. Dude,
that's so huge, there's a party to mark the event Sunday at Bar
Marmont. Eightish.</LD>
<LD>   The Sunset Strip is looking like the days of yore more and more.
Can't walk an inch without bumping into someone you knew in a
previous decade. After getting a fabulous double dose of Bad
Religion, I ran smack-dab into Pleasure Seekers' Casper, who's
spinning sick rock at the Cat Club on Saturdays.</LD>
<TE>   And speaking of Bad Religion, those boys had something to prove
last week in their three-night run at the Whisky, Roxy and the Key
Club. Veni, vidi, vici, yo. They came, they rocked, and they did
indeed conquer. I stood silently beside Rancid's Tim Armstrong at the
Whisky, just to cop a good look at his Pennywise hat.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of PW, got a jingle from Jim Lindberg of Pennywise,
otherwise known as the last great American band. Seems Jim has teamed
up with Vans to form a new record label.... Each year I buy music for
mi amigo, Li'l Ice--son of rapper Ice T. (Auntie Heidi's hooked him
up with everything from the Carpenters to Sabbath.) Since the
occasion was his 10th birthday, naturally I gave him the Pennywise
catalog. Son of the O.G. calls me up and shouts, "Every song is my
favorite song!" Sweet.</TE>
<TE>   His mommy and favorite Club Buzz tipster, Darlene Ortiz, tells me
to head North on Wednesdays, because the Sunset Boulevard restaurant
is hot, hot, hot that night. She also spotted DMX (yo, that's my
dog!) last Friday at the Hard Rock in CityWalk at a Mekhi Phifer
bash.</TE>
<TE>   Hooked up with Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols at the Loaded show
and totally forgot to tell him that his solo album "Mercy" makes
Sunday morning. Thanks, mate.</TE>

<HD>Evenings Become Really Eclectic</HD>
<DH>The bill at Highland Grounds on Wednesdays is  42 strong,
committed--and chosen at random.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINA LECARO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's organized chaos outside Highland Grounds. It's not quite 7 p.m.,
an hour before the show starts, and a line of arty-looking types,
many with acoustic guitars slung over shoulders, stretches down the
sidewalk.</LD>
<LD>   The mood is jovial as they make their way through the door to sign
up for a chance to take the stage.</LD>
<LD>   Names noted, the hundred or so musicians catch up with one
another, tune their instruments and wait. After 45 minutes or so,
host Karen Fields will announce the 42 people--chosen by lottery--who
will get to play. There are a few disappointed faces, but nobody
leaves. Coffee, beer and munchies are ordered, and those in the
bundled-up crowd take off their coats, get comfy and get ready to do
some serious listening. Outside on the patio, a groovy jam session
filled with familiar tunes begins around the courtyard's crackling
fire-pit. Another Wednesday night of the sonic love-in known as Open
Mind has begun, and the good vibes promise to be as invigorating as
the music.</LD>
<TE>   "Everyone here is seriously committed to their art, as well as
getting to know people and networking," says Fields, a classically
trained musician with an ear for talent who created this weekly open
jamboree seven years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Singer-songwriters get cyclical attention from the mainstream, but
for the music professionals and hopefuls who religiously return to
this hump-night happening, that's of little consequence. Their
melodic motivations are inspired by their colleagues, as they find
other creative souls to talk to or jam with. In this welcoming little
world, being discovered by some A&amp;R guy isn't as important as winning
a paid gig on another night at their favorite coffeehouse.</TE>
<TE>   "A real community has grown out of this night," says Sarah
Gregory, a longtime employee who is now a co-owner of Highland
Grounds. She's seen the best and the worst pass through the place's
various open-mike nights since 1990. They've showcased acts such as
Tenacious D and former MTV veejay Steve Isaacs (who hosted for a
while) in the past.</TE>
<TE>   At Fields' Open Mind night, there are some equally promising
performers, as well as seasoned rockers and studio musicians.</TE>
<TE>   "Art lives outside of the industry," says Danny Peck, an
experienced player. "It's about losing your ego and standing in line,
and then just singing to the universe."</TE>
<TE>   As is true at similar nights around town, you never know what
you're going to hear--from rhythmic rappers to skilled guitar
gods--but what makes this one different is how it's presented. Fields
runs a tight ship; each performer is allowed just one song or
spoken-word piece for four minutes, period, making for a show that's
structured yet spontaneous.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd is attentive as well. The louder element congregates
outside on the patio for a jam session around a crackling fire pit.</TE>
<TE>   "Karen has created a very supportive atmosphere where people can
develop and grow as musicians," says longtime Open Mind regular Marc
Platt. "It's a great place to try out new material and get feedback."</TE>
<TE>   On this brisk January evening, the stage is graced by a motley and
mesmerizing group: young, hip-looking folk crooners, 40-ish
psychedelic rockers, blues mamas, a ponderous spoken-wordsmith and a
few  who defy classification. When somebody is really jamming,
everyone claps, sings or screams encouragement. But if a performer
goes over the time limit, the crowd lets him or her know it in
audible terms. It's like a family gathering with Fields the nurturing
den mother.</TE>
<TE>   Open Mind's respectful spirit makes those who take the stage more
apt to take risks and stretch artistic boundaries. As Fields puts it:
"When everybody is adhering to the same parameters, it's just amazing
how people can shine."</TE>
<TE>   Open Mind night, Wednedays at Highland Grounds, 742 N. Highland
Ave., Hollywood. Signup, 7 p.m. Show, 8 p.m.-12 a.m. $3 cover;
one-drink minimum. (323) 466-1507.</TE>

<DH>The Tibet Nepal House in Pasadena shows how food from the
mountainous region travels well.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAX JACOBSON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tibet Nepal House, the first restaurant of its genre to appear in the
area, is an appealingly modest space of whitewashed wooden beams,
painted devotional scrolls (thangkas) and cheery Nepalese cooks and
waiters.</LD>
<LD>   When my wife, who was reared in Nepal, and I dropped in for a
meal, what struck us, apart from the correct Tibetan and Nepalese
crafts mounted on the soaring walls and the almost obsessively clean
decor, was precisely what surprises visitors to Nepal: its vast
ethnic diversity. The staff represents a variety of castes, religions
and languages. One evening the cook was a Gurung, from the ethnic
group that dominates the British army's famous Gurkha regiment, while
waiters were Newars from Nepal's capital, Katmandu.</LD>
<LD>   Nepalese like to tell you their food is like Indian food, but in
fact there are many differences. For instance, many Nepalese dishes
are cooked with mustard seed oil, and there are few thick gravies and
pungent spice pastes. Tibetan cuisine, meanwhile, is ruled by Tibet's
austere climate and the harsh realities of Chinese rule. These quite
different styles of cooking exist here in delicate harmony.</LD>
<TE>   You really ought to start with the Tibetan fried dumplings
momocha, which trekkers can eat practically everywhere in Nepal. In
the Himalayas, they are generally stuffed with fatty lamb, but here
these crunchy, golf ball-sized orbs have either a finely ground
chicken filling, or a mixture of transparent noodles, potato and
onion. With either kind, you get two light, flavorful chutneys,
tomato and cilantro.</TE>
<TE>   From here, there are different paths to nirvana--veg, non-veg,
Tibetan or Nepalese.</TE>
<TE>   The best Nepalese meat dish is khasi ko masu, chunks of boneless
goat meat stewed with bell peppers, tomatoes, green onions, cilantro,
herbs and a hint of ginger. This gamy meat is cooked quite tender,
obviously not in haste. Another typical Nepalese dish is khukura ko
masu ra saag, stir-fried chicken and spinach laced with spices that
taste freshly ground.</TE>
<TE>   The Nepalese vegetable preparations are delicious too and quite
distinct from their Indian equivalents. Banda gobi, one of my
favorites, is stir-fried cabbage shot through with rye seed, the
cabbage browned around the edges, exuding only enough oil to add
dimension. Tare ko ram tori is tiny bits of okra, fried crisp and
crusted with spice, mixed with chopped tomato.</TE>
<TE>   No Nepalese worth his salt would even consider starting a meal
without daalbaat, boiled white rice drowned in watery lentil gravy.
Perhaps as a concession to our palates, the lentil portion of the
dish is much thicker than it would be in a Nepalese home.
Nonetheless, it's the proper accompaniment for these Nepalese dishes,
as is roti, a whole-wheat flat bread much like a homemade flour
tortilla.</TE>
<TE>   The Tibetan side of the menu isn't quite as rigorously authentic
as the Nepalese side, for many reasons. Tibetans are Buddhists, but
they aren't vegetarians--not when they're living at an altitude of
12,000 feet or above. Not many crops will grow there except barley
and potatoes, so vegetables play too small a part in their diet for
American tastes. On the other hand, yak meat is obviously out of the
question in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   So you'll mostly get transparent noodles (ping) mixed with any
number of toppings. One of the best ping dishes is thoubu: noodles
and tofu spiced up with cilantro, chile, garlic and Sichuan
peppercorns (fagara).</TE>
<TE>   Thukpa, the Tibetan noodle soup, is a mere shadow of itself here.
In Tibet and Nepal, it's a thick soup designed to fill the stomach
and ward off the cold. This version is basically a watery (though
tasty) chicken noodle soup that you might find anywhere in Asia.</TE>
<TE>   For dessert, there's kheer, a delicate pudding made by boiling
down rice and milk, and adding almonds and raisins. There's also
Tibetan butter tea (poecha), served in a pot. But don't fear, this
isn't the notorious tea flavored with rancid yak butter, which has
brought even the most intrepid Western adventurer to heel, but a
tame, even bland fresh-butter version.</TE>
<TE>   In the food world, as we know, some things just don't travel that
well.</TE>
<TE>   Tibet Nepal House, 36 E. Holly St., Pasadena. (626) 585-9955.

<HD>Put Yourself in the Picture</HD>
<DH>Collecting art isn't just for the rich and famous. All it
takes to get started is a bit of cash and a lot of gallery browsing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HILLARY JOHNSON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Next time you're at some bleak outlet mall in Camarillo, about to
splurge $200 on a pair of gleaming faux-croc Ferragamo loafers, stop
and think to yourself: For this same amount of money--this same
substantial yet measly $200--I could own an original work by a
contemporary artist of unlimited potential. I could contribute to the
culture, impress my boss, annoy my mother and, in the process,
finally replace that old yellowed poster of the Van Gogh sunflowers
that hangs over the Ikea sofa in the den.</LD>
<LD>   Then get back in your car and head for the art world. But where,
exactly, do you go?</LD>
<LD>   Emerging artists and emerging collectors are pulled together at
gallery openings--entertaining rituals that take place all over the
city and are easy to slip into unnoticed. The art schools here do
their own bit nurturing the next artistic generation, showcasing work
with student sales where genius is remarkably affordable. There are
classes and special museum symposia that are one part information,
one part social scene. And there are definite rules to negotiating
with dealers.</LD>
<TE>   But first, put your $200 into a CD or money market account,
because everyone in the business, from collectors to art dealers,
will tell you to start by looking at art for a good six months--some
say as long as two years--before you buy so much as an etching.</TE>
<TE>   A good place to start your elementary education is Bergamot
Station, the arts complex in Santa Monica where nearly 30 galleries
share space with the Santa Monica Museum of Art. Bergamot Station
provides an easy point of entry: It attracts a wide cross section of
visitors, making for an egalitarian atmosphere, while the quality of
the art ranges from cutting-edge to indifferent.</TE>
<TE>   Strolling the station on a Saturday afternoon is a little like
visiting an extremely exotic, uncrowded shopping mall. Small groups
of people wander about, tourists, locals, artists: a couple of women
in sweaters and gold earrings who look like prosperous Brentwood
matrons; a guy in a polo shirt with a blond Pamela Anderson clone on
his arm; a few conscripts on furlough from the Westside Armani army;
some young professionals taking their out-of-town relatives for a
spin; a pair of young men who must be artists, with their black
T-shirts and paint under their fingernails.</TE>
<TE>   Track 16 is one of the complex's anchor galleries (think of it as
the Gap for art). You can walk into Track 16 without feeling the
least bit self-conscious about how un-cool you are, because it is
owned by the guy who co-created the '80s sitcom "Alf" (you know, the
one with the nerdy nuclear family and that alien that looked like a
velveteen anteater), Tom Patchett. Patchett, who cut his teeth as a
stand-up comedian and writer for Carol Burnett and "The Bob Newhart
Show," has a vast collection of pretty great contemporary art, but he
also collects things like lunch boxes and neon signs.</TE>
<TE>   He began collecting in the late 1980s, working with an art
consultant at first, then on his own. He found his niche as a
collector one day in 1991, when he walked into a gallery and bought
Sherrie Levine's "Fountain (After Marcel Duchamp)." A brass sculpture
of a urinal, Levine's work was a reference to Marcel Duchamp's
"Fountain," an actual urinal the artist signed and submitted to an
exhibition in 1917, a gesture that shook the humorless art world.</TE>
<TE>   Incredibly, Patchett didn't know a thing about Duchamp when he
bought Levine's sculpture. "I was happy to learn later that I had
appreciated it on the level Duchamp intended," he says wryly. But
after that decisive purchase, his seriocomic collection was off and
running. He now owns several works by Duchamp himself, including
"L.H.O.O.Q.," a reproduction of Leonardo's "Mona Lisa" with a
mustache and goatee doodled in--definitely not in the $200 range.</TE>
<TE>   In February, Track 16 will resume its series of entertainment
events--opening up on a Tuesday or Friday evening with music or
performance. And while you're there, you can dip your toes into some
of the other Bergamot galleries, which recently offered everything
from cardboard armchairs at the Gallery of Functional Art to 3-D
optical-illusion paintings by Patrick Hughes at Flowers West. The
latter works are so mind-bending, you'd be ill-advised to try to
drive immediately after viewing them, and they could tempt you to
liquidate the 401(k) at $25,000 a pop. On the other hand, if you'd
like to start your collection off for $150 with a Jacquelyn Tough
drawing of a cherub smoking a cigarette and leaning on a giant Prozac
capsule, you can do so at Richard Heller Gallery.</TE>
<TE>   This seems so easy. So why don't we all have art? We should live
in a world where the neighborhood manicurist can't decide whether to
give her daughter the Beuys in the foyer or the early Charles Ray for
a wedding present. But we don't. For most of us, the first exposure
to art is in a "look but don't touch" museum--where it seems
unapproachable and unattainable.</TE>
<TE>   To get past that feeling, head to the even more casual and
friendly Chung King Road in Chinatown, a paper-lanterned walk street
lined with galleries, many of which have retained the names of their
original storefronts ("Black Dragon Society" and "China Art Objects"
among them).</TE>
<TE>   "Things are very affordable right now," says Michael Queenland, a
UCLA graduate student who happens to be minding the store at the Lord
Mori Gallery on a Thursday afternoon. Queenland bucks the artist
stereotype: He isn't wearing a single item of black clothing but is
dressed down in what might be called nerd chic. "Art in L.A. is
totally accessible, especially when compared to New York," he says.
"For the past 10 years, this has been the prime city. There are four
major art schools here, and people come from all over the world to
study and teach."</TE>
<TE>   The galleries in Chinatown are mostly artist-owned and often show
student work. At the moment, Lord Mori is featuring work by seven
artists from New Zealand, a good number of which would be easy to
love, including primitive paintings by Saskia Leek in which birds
have musical notes coming out of their mouths and skinny Santas fly
over picket fences.</TE>
<TE>   Queenland, who graduates in May, just made his first purchase, a
drawing from an upcoming show by Thaddeus Strode. "It's really
exciting to come home with a piece of art," he says. "I had a
roommate at UCLA who started collecting. He didn't have a lot of
money, but he would save up, and he was buying good stuff, drawings
by Ray Pettibon for $1,200. And he was just an art student."</TE>
<TE>   In Chinatown, it's easy to feel as if anyone could buy art. After
all, teenage boys spend more on car stereos and CDs than you'd need
to spend here to begin a really interesting art collection. And your
$200 or $600 or $800 would be a real boon to any of the young artists
showing at Lord Mori.</TE>
<TE>   As a beginning collector, it's worth remembering that your
counterparts--the beginning artists--usually have day jobs and are
poor, and your cash makes a huge difference in their lives. Not only
can they now go out and buy a pair of Ferragamo loafers (or pay the
light bill), those artists now have the ability to say, "Oh yes, I've
sold my work." And when those fledgling artists are a bit further
along and start to be asked whose collections their work is in, your
name will come dancing off their tongues (even if it's just to pad an
as-yet thin list), and their listeners will feel cowed by the fact
that you're obviously a prescient, adventurous collector and they've
never even heard of you. This is cultural symbiosis at its
best--you've made your proteges "real" artists; they've made you a
"real" collector.</TE>
<TE>   Once you've had a good look around and can tell your gouache from
your tempera, you can best deepen your knowledge and widen your
circle of acquaintance by joining an art council or signing up for
the collecting seminars that are sometimes offered in conjunction
with major exhibits.</TE>
<TE>   At PhotoLA2002, a popular show organized by Stephen Cohen of the
Stephen Cohen Gallery, dealers from all over the world filled the
Santa Monica Civic Center during a recent weekend in January. The
event began with a gala benefit for the Los Angeles County Museum of
Art hosted by Ben Stiller, and throughout the show several curators
offered private lecture tours before it opened to the public each
day.</TE>
<TE>   On one such tour, LACMA's associate curator for photography, Tim
B. Wride, led a gaggle of 20-odd collectors through a maze of booths,
offering quips and commentary. "I know someone who only collects
pictures of dogs!" Wride says. "Then on the other hand, I know a very
serious collector who has a sub-collection of pictures, all of the
Brooklyn Bridge, and it's amazing what that focus brings out in the
works."</TE>
<TE>   Wride stops in front of a grouping of very small photographs by
young artist Deborah Luster, who produces tintypes of prisoners,
eerily modern little portraits contained in artifacts from a past
century. He talked about the decisions one makes to collect work like
this. "Do you buy one? If you do, it's a portrait. If you buy two, it
invites comparison between the two--you have to be careful. But then
if you buy three, it's suddenly a conversation."</TE>
<TE>   After the lecture, collector Bill Butler, who drove in from the
desert to attend the show and Wride's seminar, is approached by a
woman in a cape, who asks if she can show him her portfolio sometime.
Butler is a trim, sculpted man who manages to make jeans and a work
shirt with the sleeves cut off look crisp and elegant. "Once word
gets around that you're a collector," he says, "you can't help but
meet a lot of artists." Butler asked a lot of questions of Wride
during the seminar, and after careful deliberation bought a pair of
the Lusters at $450 each, along with a couple of other works. "My one
bit of advice: Never buy anything at an opening, when there's wine
being served," he says with a wink and a grimace.</TE>
<TE>   Wride recommends that aspiring collectors consider the art council
route; these generally are museum-sponsored groups combining
fund-raising and volunteerism with education and socializing. LACMA
has 12 councils, each tied to a particular genre, such as
photography, prints and ancient art. Like Butler, Wride urges caution
when it comes to buying a work of art in the heat of passion. "It may
be that affair that's too hot not to cool down," he says. Then he
immediately confesses that he's done just that.</TE>
<TE>   As a curator, Wride is responsible for collecting photographic
work of major historical significance for LACMA, but he is also a
collector in his personal life. "I collect drawings--not photography,
as it would be a clear conflict of interest." And though he's an art
world insider, his personal collecting budget allows for no more than
$400 per work.</TE>
<TE>   The next step is to start talking to art dealers, "the most
underused resource out there," says Dean Valentine, the former
president of UPN (he now describes himself as a "boulevardier"),
whose collection is big enough to require a warehouse. "There isn't a
lot of money in contemporary art. If [art dealers] wanted to make
money they'd be stockbrokers. They do it because they love it."</TE>
<TE>   And they want to talk about it, with anyone who cares to listen.
"I'd walk into a gallery and ask, 'Why would I buy this wretched
piece of string that's glued to the wall?'" Valentine says. "And
they'd explain it. Even if you don't buy anything. This was my
experience before I became a collector, before anyone knew who I
was."</TE>
<TE>   Valentine began collecting in 1994, focusing on contemporary art
because it was what he could afford and, luckily, what he liked. And
he vows that learning to appreciate contemporary art is not as
difficult as it may appear. "There are people you think are jerks the
first time you meet them, and then later you get to like them,"
Valentine says. "It's the same with art." As for the stereotype of
galleries guarded by sallow, beady-eyed wraiths with long noses
the-better-to-look-down-upon-you-with, Valentine shrugs. "The
obnoxious ones are almost always just some employee who feels
empowered by sitting behind some miserable desk. If they're rude,
walk out."</TE>
<TE>   Once you've found a dealer, there are the nuts and bolts of the
actual transaction. For starters, the price on the art is the real
price--there's no dickering to speak of. Galleries take an average
40% to 50% commission on artwork they represent, but despite what may
appear to be a high margin, there is very little wiggle room until
you get to the "blue-chip" level, are buying a number of pieces at
once or unless the dealer has worked with you a long time and expects
a lot of your future business.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, you do not have to buy the art from the dealer who is
showing it. This is the reason it's called an art "gallery" and not
an art "store." Dealers love to develop long-term relationships with
collectors, and this means that they will cooperate with one another,
split commissions and go out of their way to obtain any work that one
of their clients fancies. "Let's say that while on a business trip to
New York or Philadelphia, you see a work you want to buy; you can
come home to L.A. and ask your local dealer to get it for you," says
gallery owner Cohen. Your dealer will appreciate that you included
him or her in the equation, appreciation expressed when the dealer
sets aside particular works you might like or offers you a first
view.</TE>
<TE>   There are many fringe benefits to cultivating friendships with
artists and dealers, aside from the simple pleasure of their company.
Once you're in, you may be invited to an artist's studio open house,
events that take place all the time and are publicized entirely by
word of mouth--or, as is more frequently the case, by much-forwarded
e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   E-mail is the only way you would have found out about a recent
studio show by Anne Militello, a preview of her installation show
"Radiate Not Fade Away," currently running in New York. Militello is
an architectural lighting designer, responsible for Disneyland's Toon
Town, the stylishly minimalist Avalon Hotel in Beverly Hills and the
much-touted New 42nd Street Studio Building in New York's Times
Square, the entire face of which is an ever-changing light show. But
she's best known for lighting Sam Shepard's plays and concerts for
Tom Waits, Lou Reed and Pearl Jam.</TE>
<TE>   The show is in her studio space, a converted warehouse wedged
between Stadium Way and the Los Angeles River. The studio is reached
by passing through the living quarters of the loft's primary tenant,
restaurateur Michael Leko, proprietor of Eat Well and the Silver Lake
scene-of-the-moment, the 4100 Bar on Sunset. From 6 to 8 p.m., guests
come and go, wearing whatever they wore to work and pouring
themselves wine or soda from the modest Trader Joe's spread.
Militello, in glitter-flecked hip-huggers and stiletto boots, tends
to the sound system, playing ambient music by Bill Lazwell. The room
is dark as a disco, because Militello's "light paintings" are fluid,
softly evolving projections of colored light on a blank wall.</TE>
<TE>   The guests are a diverse lot of Silver Lake rock musicians,
artists, writers, editors and design professionals: Militello's
friends and friends of friends of Militello, including Roger
Trilling, a political journalist who used to be the West Coast editor
of Details; Ray Lopez, the art editor for the Mary Kate &amp; Ashley
Olsen magazine; and Hank Koening and Julie Eizenberg, the L.A.-based
architects behind the renovation of the Avalon.</TE>
<TE>   You probably won't buy one of Militello's works, which run to the
tens of thousands of dollars (the industrial lighting equipment
involved is pricey), but you might end up getting invited to have a
private look at work by John Williams, Militello's ex-husband, whose
innovative paintings sometimes wrap around corners and doorways (he
has described them as "viral"). And Williams' work might lead you to
discover his friend Anthony Ausgang, who layers cartoon-like images
onto "found" thrift store paintings. Both Williams and Ausgang show
in major galleries, but it's a gratifying adventure to seek out
artists like these on the private circuit, especially when you find
that they are approachable and friendly.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, there are as many ways to start an art collection as
there are collectors. Screenwriter Laurie Frank has taken an
entrepreneurial approach to building a collection by mounting shows
herself. "My writing partner, Floyd Byars, bought a still photograph
by a cinematographer at his kid's school fund-raising auction, and it
started from there." Frank and Byars organized a show. Since then,
Frank's Mediarare Gallery has put up more than 30 exhibits, most of
which have roots in what she calls "the extended Hollywood
community." The show she has running currently at Miau Haus in
Hollywood includes work by directors, cinematographers, even actor
Yul Brynner. "I've collected everyone I've shown," she says.</TE>
<TE>   For Valentine, art collecting isn't simply a way of looking at
art, it's a way of thinking. "That's when it really gets exciting,"
he says.</TE>
<TE>   This is why it pays to take time, learn everything you can--and
then go with your gut. "Buy what you love," virtually all experienced
collectors say, and "Trust your instincts." The worst mistake
Valentine sees young collectors make is succumbing to brand
consciousness. "I see people buying 10th-rate art by big names, and
the work is worthless the minute it walks out of the gallery. Better
to buy something you love from an unknown."</TE>
<TE>   One of the better places to seek out your first work of art is at
the senior shows held at the top-notch art schools scattered around
L.A.: Otis College of Art and Design, Art Center College of Design,
UCLA and CalArts. "I've bought a lot of art at these shows,"
Valentine says. "The art stars of tomorrow are in those graduate
shows."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, taste really does matter more than money. Even the
Broad collection of late 20th century art, recently exhibited at
LACMA, drew mixed responses from viewers. Even though Edythe and Eli
Broad are the most magnanimous art patrons in town, some thought the
collection lacked vision, or had great names but not great works.
This isn't to say that the Broad collection isn't wonderful, just
that it's all a matter of preference. And isn't it heartening to know
that someone might find your collection, however modest and obscure,
to be a more satisfying oeuvre than that of the richest couple in
L.A.?</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: LAURIE FRANK Frank holds one of the first photos she
collected, a 1962 portrait of actor Jack Nicholson by photographer
Monte Hellman. Frank's Mediarare Gallery has mounted more than 30
shows of Hollywood-centric photographic art. One of her discoveries,
the  late Horace Bristol, will have a show at the Getty in October.
"If you find an artist from the '40s, take them to the galleries,"
Frank says. "You might get them a show, and then their value will go
up!"</CP>

<LD>People commonly speak of the art world as if it were one thing: a
clique of snobs who like to intimidate newcomers, all the better to
distinguish themselves from ordinary folks. Like all stereotypes,
this one oversimplifies. What galleries actually do is strive to
distinguish themselves from one another, all the better to build
larger market niches. In general, novices need to know that galleries
with expensive inventories tend to station a staff member by the
door. That person's job is to identify collectors and greet frequent
visitors. Newcomers may get a welcoming smile or be ignored
completely, leaving them free to look at their leisure. (That's one
of the greatest pleasures of gallery-going--unimpeded,
take-your-time, inside-the-store window-shopping.)</LD>
<LD>   Dealers with less expensive works often run their own spaces. They
may leave you alone for a while, but eventually they will strike up a
conversation. After all, they are salespeople. Most dealers love what
they're selling, are fairly knowledgeable about it and remarkably
unpretentious toward buyers and browsers alike.</LD>
<LD>   The following list of user-friendly galleries, roughly organized
from east to west, suggests the diversity of the Los Angeles scene.</LD>
<TE>   1. By far the friendliest, most casual and least expensive venues
are the funky storefront galleries on Echo Park Avenue: Show Pony,
Ojala Fine Arts &amp; Crafts, Fototeka, Delirium Tremens and Nicole
Dintaman Gallery (at, respectively, 1543, 1547, 1549, 1553 and 1555
Echo Park Ave.). Open weekends, these small, far-from-polished
showrooms have a comfortable, neighborhood feel. Most of the owners
also have day jobs. The works cover a wide range of styles and media,
and tend to be a bit rough around the edges.</TE>
<TE>   2. Located in a downtown warehouse, Post (1904 E. 7th Place)
provides young artists with more square footage of floor and wall
space, giving their works a more sophisticated setting that is still
raw. The front door is always locked, but artist Habib Kheradyar, who
runs the place, is quick to answer the buzzer. Three or four shows
are regularly on display (one in the elevator shaft). Many artists
who first showed here have gone on to more prestigious galleries.</TE>
<TE>   3. At Jan Kesner Gallery (164 N. La Brea Ave.), you'll probably be
greeted by Zoa, a standard poodle who just wants to play. Kesner and
her friendly assistant, Sam Lee, bring a wealth of historical
knowledge to their photography exhibitions, which include vintage
works and first-rate contemporary pictures, all exquisitely printed.
The atmosphere is that of a well-used library. The more time you
spend, the better your chance of seeing the back-room treasure trove.</TE>
<TE>   4. The recently refurbished Iturralde Gallery (116 S. La Brea
Ave.) features contemporary art from Latin America. Run by sisters
Ana and Teresa Iturralde and a courteous staff, the airy space is
often filled with poetic works by young and more established artists,
many of whom are well-known in Mexico or South America.</TE>
<TE>   5. The nearby Tobey C. Moss Gallery (7321 Beverly Blvd.), is an
old-fashioned atelier that focuses on California Modernism. The door
is always open but the metal gate latched. After opening it, an
assistant hands you a multi-page price list for dozens of paintings,
drawings, collages, prints and sculptures--never in the order they're
hung. Moss is available to answer questions or offer firsthand
stories from the 1940s and '50s, including colorful anecdotes about
artists both famous and forgotten.</TE>
<TE>   6. Another doorbell worth ringing is at Kiyo Higashi Gallery (8332
Melrose Ave.), an elegant, streamlined showroom designed by artist
Larry Bell. Higashi descends on an exterior staircase to open the
front door and enter with you. Her program, which features Minimalist
painting, is one of the city's most focused. A visit is an education
in perceptual refinement.</TE>
<TE>   7. In the gallery recently opened by Peter Bartlett (148 N.
Hayworth), a stairway links two tiny spaces, making for intimate
nooks that Bartlett fills with his booming voice and modestly sized
works by recent art-school graduates. He's a talker whose excitement
for art is only exceeded by his love of spirited discussion.</TE>
<TE>   8. During the last two years, Susanne Vielmetter has presented
more solo debut exhibitions than any other venue. Her L.A. Projects
(5363 Wilshire Blvd.) is a not-to-be-missed stop on any gallery tour,
showcasing an eclectic roster of talented young artists and
middle-aged misfits.</TE>
<TE>   9. In West Hollywood, at Manny Silverman Gallery (619 N. Almont
Drive), works by second-generation Abstract Expressionists can get
expensive, but there are values to be had, especially among their
West Coast counterparts. Inch for inch, some paintings are a steal,
especially compared with trendy works by young art stars.</TE>
<TE>   10. Finally, Yoram Gil's tiny Galerie Yoramgil (319 N. Canon
Drive) is a breath of fresh air in Beverly Hills. Jampacked into the
storefront space are works in all media by Israeli artists,
overlooked historical figures and a smattering of recent graduates.
Gil's passion is indiscriminate; if the phone isn't ringing, he'll
pour his energy into a conversation about art for its own sake.</TE>

<HD>A Colorful Era in Filmmaking History</HD>
<DH>The 'Technicolor Dreams' series, which includes visually
slick Bond films, salutes the celebrated process that created vibrant
hues and clarity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL DESOWITZ</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This year marks the 40th anniversary of "Dr. No," the film that
introduced James Bond to the movies, made Sean Connery a star and
ushered in the '60s spy craze.</LD>
<LD>   "Dr. No" also brought Pop art to the cinema with its super-slick
design, thanks to cinematographer Ted Moore, production designer Ken
Adam and Technicolor, whose celebrated dye-transfer printing process
made those primary colors scream almost as loudly as the famous James
Bond theme.</LD>
<LD>   So with Bond mania amazingly still going strong after all these
years ("Bond 20" is due in November, and the films have grossed more
than $1.04 billion worldwide), it is fitting that the American
Cinematheque lead off its second "Technicolor Dreams" series with
"Dr. No" and "From Russia With Love" on Friday night at the Egyptian
Theatre.</LD>
<TE>   Talk about enhanced reality. Bond and dye-transfer were a perfect
visual match through the early '70s, even in these first two films,
which relied more on glossy surfaces and exotic locations than fancy
gadgets and fantastic settings.</TE>
<TE>   In "Dr. No," dye-transfer contributes an overripe look to the
Caribbean locale. The same goes for Ursula Andress' sensual presence.
In "From Russia With Love" (1963), the race for the elusive Lektor in
Istanbul and aboard the Orient Express offers a darker and richer
palette.</TE>
<TE>   To this day, the dye-transfer process arguably achieves greater
clarity and vibrancy than conventional film printing by separating
the primary colors and then individually applying complementary dyes
directly to the film. A modern version of the process, which reigned
from 1935 to 1974, was reintroduced a few years ago, but has been
used only sporadically, mainly because it's more expensive.</TE>
<TE>   The best recent examples are "Apocalypse Now Redux," "The Thin Red
Line" and reissues of "Funny Girl" and "Rear Window."</TE>
<TE>   "Technicolor Dreams" runs on two consecutive weekends through Feb.
10. The series offers 16 classics, including nearly half a dozen rare
nitrate prints, and covers a more diverse range of styles and genres
than the previous series in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The best of the nitrate-era films is "Black Narcissus" (1947), the
eerie and erotic British drama from Michael Powell and Emeric
Pressburger that also screens Friday. Deborah Kerr plays a troubled
nun overwhelmed by both the physical beauty and harsh climate of her
new home in the Himalayas. This hothouse of repression and sexual
longing was exquisitely photographed by cinematographer Jack Cardiff,
the master of Technicolor and the Vermeer of his craft when it came
to manipulating light to convey sheer beauty and spiritual
transcendence.</TE>
<TE>   Cardiff won an Oscar for his work on "Black Narcissus," and it's
hard at first to believe it wasn't shot on location. Using
oatmeal-colored tones and chaste-looking light in the early scenes
and crimson tones and a fog filter for the sexually charged climax,
Cardiff certainly pushed the aesthetic envelope, because during this
time Technicolor was also a photographic process.</TE>
<TE>   From 1935 to 1955, Technicolor (founded by Dr. Herbert Kalmus)
utilized its own special three-strip camera that simultaneously
exposed individual black and white film strips with a series of
mirrors and prisms, because color negative film didn't exist. Each
strip was light sensitive to red, blue or green, and the colors were
achieved during dye-transfer printing. The three-strip era ended with
the advent of the color negative, yet dye-transfer endured, with some
clever modifications.</TE>
<TE>   But what an era it was. Not for nothing did they call it "glorious
Technicolor." Audiences experienced films as much as watched them,
with Technicolor providing a surreal, 3-D-like experience. As
director Martin Scorsese and others have pointed out, it was the
equivalent of discovering masterworks in a museum. You were
intoxicated by the colors and swept away by the emotions. Above all,
these were films about color--both electric and refined--and were the
result of brilliant collaborations between engineers, filmmakers and
technicians.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On the oversaturated side, the series offers two more nitrate
delights on Saturday: "Forever Amber" (1947), the 17th century
costume drama directed by Otto Preminger that stars a blond Linda
Darnell as a chamber-hopping maiden who sleeps her way to the court
of Charles II (George Sanders), and "Blood and Sand" (1941), the
smoldering melodrama from director Rouben Mamoulian in which dashing
bullfighter Tyrone Power throws over Darnell for an even hotter Rita
Hayworth (in her Technicolor debut).</TE>
<TE>   Both are examples of Fox's use of Technicolor at its most
theatrical. "Forever Amber" may be a terrible movie, but it's
sumptuous to look at, with garish costumes and decor. "Blood and
Sand," which earned Oscars for cinematographers Ernest Palmer and Ray
Rennahan, is imbued with the seductive style inspired by some of the
great Spanish painters.</TE>
<TE>   Delirious is probably the best way to describe the look of Cecil
B. DeMille's biblical film "Samson and Delilah" (1949), which screens
Feb. 10 in a nitrate print.</TE>
<TE>   It's yet another feast for the eyes with little else to offer. An
Academy Award winner for best art direction and costumes, you can
decide who was more gorgeous: Victor Mature or Hedy Lamarr.</TE>
<TE>   On the tamer side are two early examples of Technicolor from 1939
(screening on Feb. 9): "The Little Princess," a Victorian
rags-to-riches story starring Shirley Temple in a mint nitrate print;
and "Gulliver's Travels," the animated classic from Max and Dave
Fleischer that bravely followed in the footsteps of Walt Disney's
"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs." Both feature a sepia tone that is
typical for the period, when Technicolor had to compensate for
various printing deficiencies.</TE>
<TE>   For sci-fi fans, two cult favorites, "Destination Moon" (1950) and
"Robinson Crusoe on Mars" (1964), screen on Feb. 9.</TE>
<TE>   The former is a colorful three-strip gem from producer George Pal
that catapulted the genre in the '50s, earning an Oscar for special
effects. The latter is a rarely revived film full of '60s angst and
featuring a more muted look.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of which, the series offers several later examples of
dye-transfer from the mid-'60s to the early '70s when it had to cope
with a darker, grainier and more naturalistic trend in
cinematography. This includes "Fiddler on the Roof" (1971), screening
on Saturday; "Cabaret" (1972), "A Fistful of Dollars" (1964) and "For
a Few Dollars More" (1965) screening on Feb. 8; and "A Man for All
Seasons" (1966), the best picture Oscar winner about the clash of
principles and wills between Sir Thomas More (Paul Scofield) and his
former friend King Henry VIII (Robert Shaw), screening on Feb. 10.</TE>
<TE>   Fittingly, cinematographers Oswald Morris ("Fiddler on the Roof"),
Geoffrey Unsworth ("Cabaret") and Ted Moore ("A Man for All Seasons")
all won Oscars for their work.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Bond's screen debut isn't the only anniversary being
celebrated during "Technicolor Dreams." There are also
50th-anniversary salutes on Sunday to John Ford's "The Quiet Man" and
John Huston's "Moulin Rouge." Like "Black Narcissus," they each boast
subtle palettes.</TE>
<TE>   Filmed on location in Ireland, "The Quiet Man" stars an unusually
sexy and sensitive John Wayne as a former boxer who returns to his
birthplace and falls in love with the fiery Maureen O'Hara. The film
offers a soft, misty look while emphasizing the gorgeous green
countryside. Ford won an Oscar as did cinematographers Winton C. Hoch
and Archie Stout.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Baz Luhrmann's sultry "Moulin Rouge," Huston achieves a
flatter, monochromatic look to simulate the style of painter
Toulouse-Lautrec in his portrait of the notorious Parisian dance
hall.</TE>
<TE>   "Technicolor Dreams" is not to be missed. Although dye-transfer is
fade-proof, there aren't many prints available anymore, especially
those films shot in three-strip. And the highly flammable nitrate,
replaced by safety film in the early '50s, is even scarcer.</TE>
<TE>   So the window of opportunity is rapidly closing.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>February is Black History Month, and numerous celebrations,
commemorations and events are taking place in and around Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Navigating the melange of museum exhibitions, theater
presentations, musicals, dance performances and film festivals can be
a little daunting. So what's a parent, aunt, uncle or guardian of an
impressionable young mind to do?</LD>
<LD>   "Parents should determine the activities by the age of their
children," says Alvin F. Poussaint, director of the Media Center of
the Judge Baker Children's Center in Boston. "Anything at a
children's museum is something you can take young children to as
early as 1 or 2. Not that they'll understand much, but they'll see
pictures of people who look like them, and that in its own way is a
celebration."</LD>
<TE>   It's a little trickier for those kids reared on BET, MTV and VH1
who may need a little more prodding. "For some kids, you can connect
the African American experience to the African experience," Poussaint
says, noting that teens would be more partial to activities involving
music and dance.</TE>
<TE>   "You can attend festivals where African drums and other things are
being played, and this teaches them how this music became a part of
American culture," he says, "even programs that discuss the
contributions to dance and hip-hop and to language that came
primarily from blacks, words like 'cool' and 'right on.'" He adds
that children can also be engaged through reading and film festivals,
which provide opportunities to explore pop culture icons of the
present and past.</TE>
<TE>   "They should take the opportunity to look at current people who
are alive and prominent, like Stanley O'Neal, and Richard D. Parsons
[chief executives of Merrill Lynch and AOL Time Warner, respectively]
and Kenneth Chenault [chief executive-designate at AOL Time Warner],
as well as people who are at the end of their careers, like Harry
Belafonte and Sidney Poitier, the first black man to win an Oscar.
These are just some of the things you can focus on."</TE>
<TE>   With so much to choose from, being selective is key. "You can't
just go to any event because it has 'black' in it," cautions Maulana
Karenga, chairman of the department of black studies at Cal State
Long Beach and creator of Kwanzaa.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason children find certain things about history
uninteresting is that they don't know why they're studying it," says
Karenga, noting that children, who are never shy about receiving
gifts, relate well to activities that offer tokens, such as books, a
piece of art or sculpture, or culturally inspired jewelry.</TE>
<TE>   "From that book, you study history; from that art object, you
explain it and they can display it proudly. One of the things that we
have to do with children is let them know that they're not just [to
study] history, but that they are a part of history."</TE>
<TE>   Like the community- and ancestral-based fundamentals he used in
developing Kwanzaa, Karenga encourages programs that foster positive
affirmations "that teach the best in African values and the greatness
of African people." But he cautions against productions such as
"'Uncle Tom's Cabin,' ... which does not affirm dignity. Children
have to see themselves in their most expansive way."</TE>
<TE>   "Parents will have to use their judgment," said Poussaint,
referring to the programs featuring classic literature readings and
plays about slavery.</TE>
<TE>   "'Uncle Tom's Cabin' is an old-style view, but it's historical. I
think it would be good for teenagers because it's such a key part of
American history," Poussaint says.</TE>
<TE>   It is beneficial, Poussaint adds, to involve all American children
in Black History Month programs. "Black people who have white
friends--or Asian and Latinos--should bring them and their children
to these events," he says. "This should be an opportunity to bring
people together to celebrate the achievements of key Americans who
have not been properly celebrated or recognized."</TE>

and pretend like I'm someplace else. And that's easy because I live
in Los Feliz, nowhere near the water. I can be pampered and get a
massage. Then if I'm down in that area, I go to Venice, which is very
cliche, but I don't get to do it very often. .</LD>
<TE>   Taking the High Trail: I also like to go hiking in Griffith Park.
That's one of my favorite places to decompress. I like some of the
less-traveled trails. There are miles and miles of trails there. I
can walk right out the door of my house, go down the street two
blocks and up a series of steps--the famous steps that are all over
L.A. Up those three sets of steps is the best aerobic workout. And at
the top of the three I'm at the entrance to one of the trails near
the Observatory. One of the trails leads to Dante's Point, which is
one of the highest in the park. I'll take the trail all across the
crest of the mountains and go all the way to the other side of the
park.</TE>
<TE>   Secrets and the City: I also like to go to the Village Coffee Shop
at the top of Beachwood Canyon. It's fantastic, up in Beachwood
Village, which was created in the '20s when they created
Hollywoodland. The Village Coffee Shop is quaintly decorated with all
sorts of obsolete kitchen wares in the cases and Depression glass
with Shirley Temple's picture on it. It's a very comfortable and
low-key place, one of the best kept secrets in the city. They also
have the best French fries I've ever had.</TE>
<TE>   One Man's Junk: The other thing I love is to hit all the
second-hand stores and antique houses in the Sunset Junction part of
Silver Lake. All along Sunset Boulevard are these antique places that
have more junk kind of stuff than fine furniture. I like those places
because I look for old records and sheet music, or Oscar Levant press
photos. Living in L.A., one can find interesting things from the
estates of famous individuals. I found all sorts of items that have
belonged to this famous ballerina, Tamara Toumanova. I found a menu
that had a caricature of her on the back from the '40s. Those places
always yield gold for me.</TE>
<TE>   A Haven of 78s: I've discovered Amoeba Records. It's the only
place I know that still carries 78s. And I'm a collector of 78s.
There's also a place on Hillhurst called Eastside Records that I go,
and a place in Glendale on Brand Boulevard that doesn't seem to have
a name. You take the records up to the counter there, and the guy
says, "Well, what are they worth to you?" It's like buying by weight
or something.</TE>
<TE>   Like Mama Used to Make: There's several restaurants I got to in
Los Feliz on Vermont Avenue. Capriccio is probably my favorite in the
neighborhood because they have the best homemade pasta I've ever had.
It's one of those BYOB places. The owner is the stereotypical Italian
mother. If you don't finish your plate, she's personally offended.
They also have fantastic desserts and I love the atmosphere because
it's truly family-style.</TE>

<HD>'Steel' Adds Depth to Fable of John Henry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>F. KATHLEEN FOLEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The legend of John Henry, the steel-driving railroad man who gave up
his life in a titanic clash of man and machine, would seem a natural
for a musical. After all, the legend itself, which can be traced back
to the early 1870s, has been passed down in music--a famous folk
song, one with many variants. A few versions present John Henry as an
inveterate womanizer killed by a jealous lover. Most, however, cast
him in the heroic mold, as a valiant African American champion who
martyrs himself in a noble cause.</LD>
<LD>   In "Steel: John Henry &amp; the Shaker," a world premiere musical at
[Inside] the Ford, playwright Leon Martell opts for an appropriately
heroic interpretation of this enduring American legend. Whether
founded in fact or wholly fictitious, John Henry has obvious
historical significance, both as a post-slavery paradigm of black
proficiency and as a proletarian prototype in an era before the rise
of American labor unions.</LD>
<TE>   Martell understands the importance of those archetypes. His John
Henry, played with (literally) towering resonance by the imposing
Michael A. Shepperd, is a legend incarnate--noble, sage, larger than
life. Yet Martell wisely balances the legendary with a gripping
coming-of-age story, that of young Willy, John Henry's "shaker,"
i.e., the young man who performed the perilous task of holding the
steel rods steady for John Henry's pounding hammer. Played with
affecting passion by Randy Guiaya, Willy must wrestle with those
moral dilemmas that John Henry is above. It's a clever augmentation
that lends the familiar fable emotional depth it would otherwise have
lacked.</TE>
<TE>   The problem with "Steel" lies not in its story, but in its music.
There's a jarring disparity between the folkloric heft of Martell's
story and the anemic, experimental rhythms of composer Penka
Kouneva's music.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, as in John Henry's bluesy number "This Hammer," the
twain meet, and the toe taps. More often, the songs seem desultory
and tuneless. In her musical melange, Kouneva only occasionally
references the traditional American music that this piece cries out
for.</TE>
<TE>   That's a shame, and the production's fatal flaw. Musical director
David O, who also heads up the production's live band, valiantly
attacks the obliquities of Kouneva's score, with intermittent
success. Director Wendy McClellan draws thoughtful performances from
her cast. Ameenah Kaplan's wonderfully percussive choreography is
memorable. Among the lesser roles, Christopher Gerson stands out as a
simple laborer haunted by visions of cave-ins and catastrophe. Akeime
Mitterlehner's set, Jerry Browning's lighting and Barbara M. Lempel's
costumes are all top-notch.</TE>
<TE>   Now, for a little more indigenous "oomph" to that music.</TE>
<TE>   "Steel: John Henry &amp; the Shaker," [Inside] the Ford, 2580 Cahuenga
Blvd. East, Los Angeles. Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 3 p.m.

<HD>Crooner in Cruise Control</HD>
<DH>Luis Miguel has secured his place as Julio Iglesias'
successor, but can he find new artistic challenges?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After 10 years of polishing his image as a mature romantic crooner,
Luis Miguel has emerged as the successor to Julio Iglesias, the
reigning Spanish heartthrob of a previous generation. When Iglesias
set a box-office record with a series of 10 sold-out concerts at the
Universal Amphitheatre in 1984, the princely newcomer was barely a
teenager.</LD>
<LD>   Now, with six consecutive shows this week at the same venue, Luis
Miguel comes closer than any other performer to matching his
predecessor's success. But unlike Iglesias, who drew multiethnic
crowds in the wake of crossover duets with Diana Ross and Willie
Nelson, Luis Miguel, who has resisted recording in English, performs
for an audience that remains almost exclusively Latino.</LD>
<LD>   The dashing Mexican with the million-dollar smile opened his show
Tuesday with the new single "Amor, amor, amor," dispensing quickly
with his rushed and heartless rendition of the tender, lilting
classic. Appearing tanned and vigorous, Luis Miguel performed like a
cross between Elvis Presley and Frank Sinatra, an old-school crooner
in a black tuxedo who hops around and sweats like a rock star with
tousled hair.</LD>
<TE>   Paradoxically, Luis Miguel's current U.S. tour follows lukewarm
sales of his new album, "Mis Romances," a fourth volume in his series
of romantic standards. His repertoire of classic ballads and boleros
sparked a Latin American nostalgia craze, beginning with 1991's
"Romance." For the generation of fans who turned 20 along with their
idol at the start of the decade, Luis Miguel would provide the first
exposure to classics such as "El dia que me quieras" and "La ultima
noche."</TE>
<TE>   To those already familiar with such lyrical jewels, the singer's
upbeat treatments at times crushed all their vintage sweetness, like
doing a disco version of "My Funny Valentine."</TE>
<TE>   But if Luis Miguel can sometimes overpower his material, his
physical charisma and exceptional talent also combine to create
moments of convincing passion on stage. Songs such as "Historia de un
amor" and "Delirio" were especially effective Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Those numbers came in the middle of the concert, after the singer
had fussed for more than an hour with his earpiece, which lets him
properly hear his punchy, nine-piece band. The temperamental
perfectionist kept taking the small device on and off, giving
frustrated signals to somebody offstage to adjust the volume. The
sound problem wasn't noticeable from the audience, but his struggling
became such a distraction that you felt like getting up and going
backstage to fix it for him.</TE>
<TE>   The singer seemed to relax after changing into loose shirts, first
black then white. His short ranchera segment was forgettable except
for a thrilling version of Guadalupe Trigo's postmodern mariachi
composition "Mi Ciudad," an unusual and challenging choice.</TE>
<TE>   By the show's climactic closing, Luis Miguel seemed completely in
command, with fans standing and singing along to such early,
adolescent hits as "La chica del bikini azul." Without returning for
an encore, the singer left his audience ecstatic in a flourish of
confetti, glitter and colored streamers.</TE>
<TE>   But where does Luis Miguel go from here? Will he fade away like
Iglesias? Or will he be bold enough to go beyond the matinee-idol
mold and look for new material to redefine himself, rather than
simply redefining old material?</TE>
<TE>   Wherever he goes, Luis Miguel proved again Tuesday that he's got
the magnetism to take us with him.</TE>
<TE>   Luis Miguel plays through Sunday at the Universal Amphitheatre,
100 Universal City Plaza, Universal City, 8:15 p.m. Friday and
Sunday, $59 to $139. Other nights sold out. (818) 622-4440.</TE>

<HD>Roney Moves Past Davis Comparisons</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wallace Roney kicked off his opening set at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill on
Tuesday night with a wildly virtuosic trumpet solo. Ranging with
seeming effortlessness across the full scope of his instrument, he
instantly revealed how far he has come since the early days of his
career, when he was seen by many as a Miles Davis musical clone.</LD>
<LD>   It's true that elements of Davis' style are still apparent in
Roney's soloing, but for the most part he is very much his own person
now, as he slowly but surely allows his improvisational vision to
move into the foreground.</LD>
<LD>   Devoting the entire set to extended performances of only a few
numbers, and identifying none of them, Roney made no concessions to
entertainment values, instead offering a moderate-sized crowd the
opportunity to experience free-flowing, no-holds-barred contemporary
jazz improvisation.</LD>
<TE>   For the most part, that was a productive decision. Roney was
joined in the front line by veteran alto and soprano saxophonist Gary
Bartz, whose plaintive, emotion-filled lines provided a warm counter
to Roney's soaring flights of fancy. And Patrice Rushen, on
keyboards, and Buster Williams, on bass, brought structure and
cohesion to what might otherwise have emerged as rambling, uncentered
numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Roney has worked frequently with Lenny White, so he presumably was
getting what he wanted from the drummer's incessant playing, despite
its tendency to submerge everything in waves of percussion and
cymbals.</TE>
<TE>   But, even if one grants that the '80s Miles Davis style--the
foundation of the set's lengthy pieces--calls for a roiling,
turbulent undercurrent of rhythm, White's playing seemed oversized
for the room's acoustics. Solos by Williams and Bartz, in particular,
were often overwhelmed by the sheer torrent of decibels pouring out
of the drums.</TE>
<TE>   What was missing from the set, in fact, was a stronger sense of
overall focus from Roney, a feeling that the evening's musical
viewpoint, and not simply his individual playing, was the reflection
of his creative perspective. Clearly finding his own path as an
improvising jazz artist, Roney now needs to discover his way as a
leader.</TE>

<HD>Brazilian Rendezvous</HD>
<DH>Smokey Hormel is from L.A. and Miho Hatori from Japan, but
they have found common ground in the bossa nova.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ask guitarist Smokey Hormel how he came to love Brazilian music, and
he sets a scene that could come from a freewheeling contemporary
novel.</LD>
<LD>   "I grew up in the '60s in L.A., and my mom was a French ballerina
and my dad was this rich guy who loved music and having parties,"
says the musician, a grandson of the man who invented Spam and the
guitarist during the past decade for Beck, Tom Waits and the
Blasters.</LD>
<LD>   "One of their best friends was the Brazilian consul, and whenever
Brazilian artists came to town he would call and say, 'Sergio Mendes
is in town.' My dad would say, 'Cool, let's have a party.' So when I
was a kid, people like Gilberto Gil and Antonio Carlos Jobim were all
at these parties at our house, up all night drinking."</LD>
<TE>   For singer Miho Hatori, who grew up in Tokyo and was part of the
New York art-pop band Cibo Matto, the connection to Brazilian music
seems almost mundane.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was a teenager in Tokyo in the '80s, I was into
alternative rock," she says. "But one friend of mine played [a record
by] Sergio Mendes &amp; Brasil '66, and I felt, 'Man!' Even though I was
into rock and noise, I loved this feeling of the music. Generally,
Japanese listeners just love Brazilian music. Every time I go back
there, I find more great Brazilian records I cannot get here."</TE>
<TE>   So, perhaps it was fated that these two artists from seemingly
different worlds would team up to play music of and inspired by their
'60s bossa nova heroes, in earnest exploration of mutual, if
unlikely, roots.</TE>
<TE>   Billed as Smokey &amp; Miho, they've assembled a small band that will
make its Los Angeles debut tonight at the Knitting Factory Hollywood,
performing songs by such Brazilian figures as Baden Powell and
Vinicius de Moraes, as well as original takes on the slinky, sensual
sounds.</TE>
<TE>   They've recorded demos of three new songs--one of which was used
in the Golden Globe-nominated Mexican film "Y Tu Mama Tambien" last
year--and are writing more, with plans to make a full album.</TE>
<TE>   The recordings show that they've already put their distinctive
stamps on the music, expanding beyond the boundaries of bossa nova
while remaining true to the spirit. One of the songs is from Angola
(like Brazil, a former Portuguese colony), and in addition to
Portuguese, Hatori sings in Japanese, English and the Angolan
language Kinbundu.</TE>
<TE>   "I have English with a Japanese accent, and I have that too with
Portuguese," says the 30-year-old Hatori, who is also a featured
singer in the "virtual" band the Gorillaz. "I'm willing to learn. And
Japanese sounds are close to Portuguese. Actually, the first white
person to come to Japan in the 15th century was Portuguese."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The genesis of the project came in 1998 when Cibo Matto was the
opening act on a Beck tour, and the two musicians hit it off. Hormel,
who had concentrated on blues and rock as a performer, had
reconnected with Brazilian music via Beck, an aficionado of the
quasi-psychedelic tropicalia style of the '60s and '70s. Having
renewed his enthusiasm for bossa nova, Hormel gave Hatori a copy of a
Baden Powell album, and the music became central to their friendship.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I went to New York, we'd have a jam session," says
Hormel, 41. "A year later I was living [in New York] and had just
seen Baden Powell play what would be his last show ever, actually.
And Miho and I were talking about that tape I'd given her, and we
decided to try to perform the songs from that album just as a
challenge."</TE>
<TE>   In December 2000, they performed the entire album, "Os Afros
Sambas," at the club Tonic in New York. The effort proved not just a
diversion, but also a haven for the two.</TE>
<TE>   "Cibo Matto was struggling at the time to get played on the
radio," Hormel says. "I'd been watching Beck's frustration with
[lower-than-expected sales for] the 'Midnite Vultures' album. It felt
good to just play music without thinking of the business."</TE>
<TE>   That aspect, they say, became even more important in recent
months. The post-Sept. 11 slowdown meant less demand for Hormel on
tours and recording sessions, and Hatori and her Cibo Matto partner,
Yuko Honda, decided to put the group on indefinite hiatus.</TE>
<TE>   "Since [Sept. 11], Miho and I have been focused on this project,"
Hormel says. "I'm not making a lot of money on it, though I
definitely think it has the potential to make some money. But that's
not why we're doing it. For me, it's nice to play quiet and hear
beautiful melodies. The beat is so natural, like a heartbeat.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the imagery is very romantic, but also about people
trying to find a place in the modern world and be connected to their
spirit.</TE>
<TE>   "You turn on the radio these days and the beats you're hearing are
so unnatural. They sure don't make me feel sexy."</TE>
<TE>   Smokey &amp; Miho, with Brazaville and Gwendolyn, tonight at 8 at the
Knitting Factory Hollywood, 7021 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood, $10.

<LD>   "Oleanna"--During the last decade or so, David Mamet's story has
intrigued audiences with its "Rashomon"-like perspective on a
privileged, pedantic professor and the disgruntled female student who
accuses him of sexual harassment. Is the professor an abusive sexist?
Or is the student a dangerous ideologue with an ax to grind? That
perceptual uncertainty was once the play's primary thrust. But after
the Sept. 11 attacks, the shifting sands of Mamet's drama fuse into
harder substance. What was essentially an exercise about the
uncertainty of individual perception can now be better construed as a
devastating parable about intellectual relativism and moral
absolutism.</LD>

<LD>   Hello on the Go. Music Workshop for Kids. CD: $16. Ages 3 to 6.
(888) 470-1667.</LD>
<LD>   The award-winning Music Workshop for Kids (Mary Jane Alm, Pat
Frederick, Kathy Mueller, Mark Mueller, Scott "Scooter" Nelson)
rarely disappoints parents. After all, Mom and Dad are as much the
Minneapolis group's target audience as children.</LD>
<TE>   Its most recent release is no exception. Performed by professional
artists (who also compete in the world of music for adults), this
terrific, jazz-fueled collection includes the stylings of the
Hornheads, a respected brass and winds group that has performed with
Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Tony Bennett, Janet Jackson and others.</TE>
<TE>   Preschooler favorites such as "This Little Light of Mine" and "Pop
Goes the Weasel" get new treatments.</TE>
<TE>   New songs include "An Inch Tall," an imagination-stirring look at
the world from the ground up; "Wipe Wash Flush and Brush," a
remarkably sunny--and clean--celebration of personal hygiene; and an
irresistible, funk-and-rap-style philosophical look on "The Bright
Side."</TE>
<TE>   The most unusual offering is a child's narrative about "My Dad
(and Me)"--an observation of small but important moments of
companionship and communication, deepened with nostalgic, wistful
musical accompaniment.</TE>
<TE>   The loveliest tracks, most likely to linger in adult minds, are
"Cranberry Red Balloon," about a child who comes to realize that
actually catching an errant balloon is less meaningful than the
chase; and the poignant lullaby "Ship of Dreams."</TE>

<LD>Soft, creamy egg salad is pure old-fashioned comfort food.</LD>
<LD>   Barney Greengrass: The chunky egg salad, made with capers,
homemade mayonnaise and green onions, is piled high on your choice of
bagel (try the walnut or the pumpernickel) along with arugula and a
handful of flavorful sunflower sprouts. It comes with cole slaw or
potato salad. (Egg salad sandwich, $8.) Barney Greengrass, Barneys
New York, 9570 Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills, (310) 777-5877.</LD>
<LD>   Johnny Rockets: This retro chain makes an egg salad "just like Mom
used to make"--it's just fresh hard-boiled eggs, mayo and a secret
seasoning (no one will divulge the contents) on wheat, white,
sourdough or rye. One the side are a few plump black olives; try
slicing them up and adding them to the sandwich. (Egg salad sandwich,
$3.89.) Johnny Rockets: Check for listings throughout Los Angeles and
Orange counties.</LD>
<TE>   Apple Pan: This one is simplicity at its best: just freshly
hard-boiled eggs and mayo. Served on white bread unless specified,
with sweet pickles and black olives on the side. Leave some room for
pie afterward. (Egg salad sandwich, $4.25.) Apple Pan, 10801 Pico
Blvd., West Los Angeles, (310) 475-3585.</TE>
<TE>   Brent's Deli: The egg salad is so popular here that sometimes they
have to make a second batch in the afternoon. The rich, slightly
bland eggs and mayo are spiked with mustard, celery and white pepper.
This gooey, man-size sandwich comes on freshly baked rye bread
(unless you prefer egg bread or an onion or Kaiser roll). Comes with
cole slaw or potato salad. (Egg salad sandwich, $5.95.) Brent's Deli,
19565 Parthenia Ave., Northridge, (818) 886-5679.</TE>
<TE>   Greenblatt's Deli &amp; Fine Wines: Some come here for the corned
beef, but this is also a great place for a classic egg salad with
mayonnaise, mustard and a little salt and pepper. Have a crunchy
pickle on the side. (Egg salad sandwich, $6.50.) Greenblatt's Deli &amp;
Fine Wines, 8017 Sunset Blvd., Hollywood, (323) 656-0606.</TE>
<TE>   Zinc Cafe &amp; Market: This  egg salad is made with cilantro, green
onions, butter and mayo, with lettuce and tomato on whole wheat bread
spread with mustard. (Egg salad sandwich, $6.25.) Zinc Cafe &amp; Market,
350 Ocean Ave., Laguna Beach, (949) 494-6302.</TE>

<LD>   Sophia Loren Sits Down to a Plate of Polish Pasta</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Poland's second-largest pasta-maker is hoping an endorsement from
Italian superstar Sophia Loren will propel it to the No. 1 spot.</TE>
<TE>   "Sophia Loren is a symbol of great Italian taste, and she has
repeatedly said she owes her great looks to pasta," said Robert
Mrozinski, general manager of Danuta SA, maker of the Malma brand of
macaroni.</TE>
<TE>   Loren's endorsement of a Polish pasta hasn't gone over well in the
Italian media, where some reports say she should be endorsing a
home-grown product. Last week, the Italian daily Il Mattino urged
Loren to rethink her decision.</TE>
<TE>   "More than a dish, a plate of spaghetti is a worldview," it
commented. "Sophia, how does one say 'al dente' in Polish? One just
can't."</TE>
<TE>   Mrozinski argues that the commercial would promote Italy's
national cuisine, regardless of who makes the pasta.</TE>

<TE>   Poet Sues the FCC</TE>
<TE>   Over Radio Fine</TE>
<TE>   New York poet Sarah Jones is suing the Federal Communications
Commission, claiming the agency violated her 1st Amendment rights
when it deemed one of her songs indecent and fined a radio station
for playing it.</TE>
<TE>   Though the 1999 song "Your Revolution" didn't include any of the
seven words prohibited by the FCC, it contained vivid sexual imagery.
Jones said she was surprised by the ruling because she wrote the song
as a criticism of the degradation of women in hip-hop.</TE>
<TE>   Her lawsuit, filed in federal court on Tuesday, asks the court to
overturn the FCC ruling and seeks an injunction against a $7,000 fine
the FCC imposed on Portland, Ore., radio station KBOO-FM for airing
the song. The station contested the fine in July, but no action has
been taken, said Jones' lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   The FCC declined to comment on the case. In the past year, the
agency has come under scrutiny for what some say is inconsistent

<TE>   NYC's Arts Losses</TE>
<TE>   Former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani urged the public to
get out and support cultural institutions in the wake of the Sept. 11
attacks. But according to an insider, an upcoming report from the New
York State Council on the Arts shows that arts groups in the five
boroughs lost nearly $30 million between Sept. 11 and Oct. 31.</TE>
<TE>   The study, based on 419 responses, documented both lost income and
physical damage, the Village Voice reports.</TE>
<TE>   Box office alone was down $11.6 million, and foundation money from
recession-plagued corporations was $3 million less than anticipated.
Arts groups received less money from state government agencies, where
budgets were cut by 10%. And nonprofit groups were told to tighten
their belts so that city funds could be diverted downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the Andy Warhol Foundation provided $600,000 to assist
small and mid-size arts organizations in lower Manhattan, and the
Andrew W. Mellon Foundation has given $50 million to cultural groups.
But arts institutions are anxiously awaiting the new city budget to
get a true reality check.</TE>

<HD>The Night's Familiar but Uneasy Mysteries</HD>
<DH>David Deany's idiosyncratic installation evokes darkness,
and is unpretentious and alluring.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>There's something inexplicably entrancing about "Take Back the
Night," David Deany's gallery-subsuming installation at Diannepruess
Gallery. Though composed of only a few idiosyncratic individual
elements, it evokes a sense of humble mystery akin to that of one's
childhood backyard at night: a familiar place made unfamiliar by a
veil of darkness. It feels cozy but uncanny, safe but uneasy.</LD>
<LD>   The unifying element in the installation is a synthetic tone of
midnight blue. The gallery's windows are covered with blue spray
paint, and blue light seeps through the planks of a rough, splintery
wood floor that is built about a foot above the gallery's cement
floor. Two large paintings--one that conveys a horizontal wave
pattern meant to suggest running water, another that depicts a large,
silhouetted tree--stew in similar shades.</LD>
<LD>   A large, steaming tub of fresh tar and a kitschy but daunting
painting of an owl pose an earthy contrast to the cold atmosphere of
blue. A spattering of small, beige, unevenly ovular forms are set
into the wall above the owl and are lighted from within like an
otherworldly hybrid of stone and star.</LD>
<TE>   This dichotomy between blue and beige, sky and earth is loose and
perhaps even unconscious. But it anchors the space into a rich,
organic state of tension. No single element of the installation seems
calculated or particularly potent in itself--indeed, they're all
disarmingly amateurish--but their casual cooperation spins this
tension into an alluring web.</TE>
<TE>   It is a refreshingly sloppy, intelligently ambiguous and
wonderfully unpretentious project, all in all. One is tempted to
pitch a tent alongside its lava-like pool just to see what spirits
might emerge at the stroke of midnight.</TE>

<DH>Two short films from Iran offer moving but bleak looks at
the desperate plight of women who have few options in a
male-dominated society.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The UCLA Film Archive's outstanding 12th annual Celebration of
Iranian Cinema continues tonight with a pair of formidable short
films that offer further evidence of the oppression of women in Iran.</LD>
<LD>   Amir Ali Abdollah Zadeh's 35-minute "Gol Chador" was shot through
the veil of a young woman--except in those moments when she is
talking to another woman in private--desperately seeking someone to
care for the unborn child fathered by a lover who has disappeared.
The film unfolds almost entirely through the eyes of the pregnant
woman, who elicits a wide range of advice and a few offers of help.
An older woman and a younger woman, the two who take the greatest
interest in the woman's plight, see abortion as the only way out; the
men tend to be more impractical and several have less than noble
intentions.</LD>
<LD>   Whether the imploring voice that we hear belongs to an actual
unwed pregnant woman or an actress ultimately doesn't matter; what
does is the revealing range of responses. "Gol Chador" screens at
7:30 p.m. in Melnitz Hall's James Bridges Theater.</LD>
<TE>   Bahman Moshar's terse 57-minute documentary "My Name Is Rocky"
(screening after "Gol Chador") focuses on the plight of runaway
teenage girls and young women who in desperation have fled homes that
have become unendurable, only to end up in a Tehran courtroom, where
their stories of brutal parents or husbands fall on the deaf ears of
an unseen judge. He either sends them home or to prison, with only a
precious few remanded to a rehabilitation center.</TE>
<TE>   Moshar cuts back and forth to various street scenes, maintaining a
brisk tempo. In contrast to the despairing young women who rightly
believe they have no futures, Rocky and Mona, whom he meets in a
park, have learned how to survive on their own against all odds. He
also interviews a young man who freely admits to beating his sister
if she should "get out of line," unquestioningly taking it as his
prerogative. "My Name Is Rocky" is yet further evidence of the lack
of status of Iranian women under Islamic rule.</TE>
<TE>   Rakhshan Bani-Eternad's "Under the Skin of the City" (Saturday at
7:30 p.m.) is a classic drama of a family struggling in a Tehran
dominated by skyscrapers and freeways. Golab Adineh heads the cast as
the family's strong matriarch who tends a loom at a textile factory
and has a lame husband at home, along with an ambitious son trying to
scrape together money for a visa and transportation to Japan so that
he might get a higher-paying job. She also has a son and daughter
still in their teens; her married daughter curses her brutal spouse.</TE>
<TE>   The family's story unfolds with powerful simplicity in a society
grown impersonal and corrupt. The result is a bleak, unflinching film
that is sometimes hard to follow, but the message of frustration and
despair comes across loud and clear. (310) 206-FILM.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The American Cinematheque opens its two-day Best of the Slamdance
2002 Film Festival on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. at the Egyptian Theatre
with Mark Moskowitz's stunning "Stone Reader," which took the
audience and special jury prizes.</TE>
<TE>   Moskowitz is a commercials director specializing in political
campaigns and works out of his beautiful old home in rural
Pennsylvania. He explains that back in 1972 when he was 18 he tried
to read "The Stones of Summer," a novel that a New York Times
reviewer proclaimed defined his generation. At the time he only got
to Page 20, but he recently came across it, couldn't put it down and
felt that he had stumbled upon a truly great American novel.</TE>
<TE>   Moskowitz's cross-country search for its virtually forgotten
author, Dow Mossman, makes this documentary a literary suspense
tale--will he find Mossman? Is the author alive? But "Stone Reader"
is a lot more. It's a comment on the perils of publishing--of how a
great novel can get so totally lost because its original publisher
was not a powerhouse company. It's also a comment on the amount of
hoopla it now takes for any work to get attention or appreciation. As
for the gifted artist, if deserved fame eludes him or her, the
consequence can be total oblivion.</TE>
<TE>   "Stone Reader" is also a celebration of nature and of literature,
and as such it is refreshing as a presentation of a wide array of
American men, middle-aged and older, holding forth on the joys of
literature with the passion and knowledge usually reserved for
baseball. Some of these men are renowned, such as literary critic and
historian Leslie Fielder; Frank Conroy, head of the Iowa Writers
Workshop; and Robert Gottlieb, who edited "Catch-22" and other
landmark works and is now editing President Clinton's memoirs. By the
finish of this singularly resonant and beautiful film, Moskowitz has
discovered the purpose of his odyssey: to drum up enough attention to
get "The Stones of Summer" back into print. (323) 466-FILM.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From Friday through Sunday at 8 p.m., with a Sunday matinee at 1
p.m., the Silent Movie will present one of the major epics of early
American cinema, Rex Ingram's 1921 film of Vicente Blasco Ibanez's
best-selling "The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse."</TE>
<TE>   Pioneer Metro screenwriter June Mathis, who adapted the novel for
the screen, not only had persuaded studio head Richard A. Rowland to
buy the novel, but also to star Rudolph Valentino, who from 1913 on
had played mainly villains and second-billed leading men at
Universal.</TE>
<TE>   A complicated and sprawling World War I epic in which cousin is
ultimately pitted against cousin, "Four Horsemen" cast Valentino as a
Buenos Aires playboy whom we meet in a gloriously seedy cabaret. When
Valentino, in gaucho attire, stepped onto the dance floor for a tango
(with Helena Domingues), he became an instant superstar and the
smoldering sensuality of his dancing was one of the cinema's great
epoch-making moments. It is entirely appropriate that the plump and
unglamorous but highly talented Mathis rests next to Valentino at the
Hollywood Forever Cemetery. (323) 655-2520.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The 10th annual Pan African Film Festival opens Wednesday with the
premiere of Eriq La Salle's directorial debut film, "Crazy as Hell,"
at the Century Plaza before getting underway Thursday at its regular
venue, the Magic Johnson Theaters ([213] 896-8221). Meanwhile, the
fourth annual Hollywood Black Film Festival starts Tuesday at the
Harmony Gold Preview House, with Ben Ramsey and Kantz's action drama,
"Love and a Bullet." (310) 348-0858.</TE>

<HD>A 20-Year Ongoing Experiment</HD>
<DH>L.A. Philharmonic's New Music Group celebrates two decades
of innovation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES MUSIC CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The creation of the New Music Group in 1981 was a bold idea for the
Los Angeles Philharmonic. But it wasn't that bold. A new sense of
adventure entered into life of the American symphony orchestra in the
'80s. The New York Philharmonic initiated an annual festival of new
music. The Boston Symphony had its new music ensemble. And many
orchestras around the country supported an active
composer-in-residence program.</LD>
<LD>   All that is now ancient history, all but the New Music Group. What
is truly remarkable about the Los Angeles Philharmonic's venture is
that it wasn't a brief experiment. The New Music Group has survived
changing administrations and budget crises, and in the process it has
become part of what defines the feisty spirit of the Philharmonic.</LD>
<LD>   Tuesday night at the Colburn School for the Arts, the New Music
Group celebrated its 20th anniversary in a special concert in the
Green Umbrella series--the Philharmonic's new music concert series.
Under a rafter hung with green umbrellas and with Zipper Hall bathed
in green light, the four composers who have been most closely
associated with the New Music Group--William Kraft, John Harbison,
Steven Stucky and Esa-Pekka Salonen--came together to conduct their
own works.</LD>
<TE>   The evening served as a well-deserved tribute to Ernest
Fleischmann, the former general manager of the Philharmonic who
founded the New Music Group and then refused to let it die, no matter
what the budget demanded. It further honored board members, such as
Robert Attiyeh and William Brady, who have spent their own money to
commission works, as has new music patron Betty Freeman. In fact, so
strong is the belief in the worth of this enterprise that Salonen,
Fleischmann and the current general manager, Deborah Borda, recently
made personal donations when the New Music Group was threatened again
by a budget crunch.</TE>
<TE>   But the main purpose of Tuesday's program was to do what the New
Music Group regularly does, which is to give an interesting and
relevant concert.</TE>
<TE>   In his address to the audience, Salonen described the group as a
landing pod for the orchestral mother ship, dropping in on other
planets and "making the first contact with alien life-forms."</TE>
<TE>   On this occasion the musical life-forms, and certainly the
well-known four composers, were hardly alien. The Double Trio, by
Kraft, the first director of the New Music Group, was the earliest
work, premiered 35 years ago at the Monday Evening Concerts. The
piece represents musical issues of the '60s, about pitches and
rhythms as mathematical sets, but it is also the music of a virtuoso
percussionist with a lively imagination, an irrepressible rhythmic
energy and a theatrical bent.</TE>
<TE>   Fascinating sounds percolate from a strange ensemble of two pianos
(one prepared), electric guitar, tuba and percussion. A Lisztian
cadenza for prepared piano (written for Michael Tilson Thomas and
played here with fine flourish by guest pianist Jeremy Haladyna) is
the kind of gesture that brings a smile to the face.</TE>
<TE>   The character of Harbison's Concerto for Oboe, Clarinet and
Strings (1984) is Baroque music brought up to date; it gives the
sensation of a bewigged couple arguing about events of our day.
Oboist Marion Arthur Kuszyk and clarinetist David Howard were superb
as the nattering soloists, their melodic lines full of intertwining
fantasy, with the string ensemble attempting, rarely with success, to
calm them down.</TE>
<TE>   Stucky's "Etudes," for recorder and chamber orchestra, was a new
piece receiving its U.S. premiere, and the soloist was Danish
recorder player Michala Petri. The brief "etudes"--one for sopranino
recorder as chirpy as Vivaldi, another full of floating Berio-like
sonorities, a third full of rushing scales and jazzy
syncopations--are irresistible studies in good cheer. Petri is a
marvel in the amount of expression she can achieve from a sonically
primitive Baroque instrument, and Stucky's ear for color and nuance,
as well as the ever engaging vivacity of his music, perked up to all
the possibilities she presented him.</TE>
<TE>   Salonen's contribution was his song cycle "Five Images After
Sappho." Laura Claycomb, the soprano who premiered the work at the
Ojai Festival in 1999 and sang it with the Philharmonic the following
year at Royce Hall, was, once more, that soloist. This short visit
into the inner life of a young girl's awakening sexuality is an
example of the dazzling new personality that has entered into
Salonen's music in recent years. And it now proudly and happily takes
its place among the vast list of new works that the New Music Group
has performed over 20 seasons.</TE>
<TE>   That list--taking up five pages of double columns in small type in
the program--is a monument. The music is not the usual snapshot of
our era that you get from other orchestras, but a hard, deep and
astonishingly thorough look at our life and times.</TE>

Hollywood, [323] 957-5782). Neil Simon's comedy, based on the Jewish

ancient curse. Jay Edward Anthony, left, plays Count Gregor, who
lords it over his dimwitted subjects. Fri.-Sat., 8 p.m. Ends March 2.

<LD>"The Tonight Show," "Today," "60 Minutes," "All My Children"--when
something works on television, it stays. And to those venerable
small-screen institutions one must add "The Price Is Right," the
simplest of game shows and yet the longest lasting. "The Price Is
Right" celebrates its 30th anniversary tonight with a one-hour
prime-time edition (8 p.m., CBS), and what's amazing about that is
it's only the 30th anniversary in this incarnation, with Bob Barker
as host. The show itself dates back to 1956, when it premiered on
NBC. There was also a version on ABC in the '60s.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight's celebration, taped in Las Vegas, is actually about seven
months early in terms of the anniversary date, but there's no reason
to doubt that the show will get there. With its simple premise of
having everyday people try to guess the retail value of items ranging
from potato chips to new cars, "The Price Is Right" remains one of
the most popular programs on daytime television (weekdays at 10 a.m.,
CBS), averaging 5.8 million viewers per program this season.</LD>
<LD>   And Barker--a TV institution himself, having hosted "Truth or
Consequences" for 18 years in addition to his stint on "The Price Is
Right"--remains at 78 an affable host who still seems to get a kick
out of the contestants.</LD>
<TE>   And why not? They continue to go bonkers when Rod Roddy calls for
them to "come on down." You'd think they'd wait to celebrate until
they actually won something, but apparently the chance to compete is
thrill enough. After all, they're on television.</TE>

<HD>'Atlantis' Not Lost and Forgotten Yet</HD>
<DH>Original story lines surface on the DVD, along with deleted
scenes and fresh commentary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Directors Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise and producer Don Hahn are the
team responsible for the 1991 Disney animated film "Beauty and the
Beast," which made history when it became the first animated film
nominated for a best picture Oscar.</LD>
<LD>   Their latest creation, "Atlantis: The Lost Empire," is a
disappointment. This action-adventure about an underwater exploration
to find the lost city of Atlantis is really geared more for boys than
for families. There are no cute animal sidekicks or Broadway-style
musical numbers.</LD>
<LD>   Nevertheless, the two-disc collector's DVD ($40) is vastly
entertaining and informative. The first disc includes a wide-screen
edition of the film--"Atlantis" was the first Disney cartoon shot in
CinemaScope since 1959's "Sleeping Beauty"--and a "Disneypedia,"
which offers fun and interesting facts about Atlantis geared to the
kiddies and a crash course in how to speak Atlantean.</LD>
<TE>   Besides interesting audio commentary with Hahn, Trousdale and
Wise, the disc also includes visual commentary that has the three
going behind the scenes during key moments in the film. Highlights of
the visual commentary include early characters and story lines that
were later discarded, such as a rat cohort for Milo Thatch (Michael
J. Fox), the eager linguist who leads the expedition to Atlantis.</TE>
<TE>   The second disc features two hours of extras on how the story was
created; the development of the character designs, art direction,
music and sound; the publicity for the film; how the voice actors
were chosen for the project; and deleted scenes, including an
exciting prologue.</TE>
<TE>   Disney is also offering "Atlantis" in a standard DVD ($30), which
features the commentary, the deleted prologue, the Disneypedia and
the course on Atlantean.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After directing more dramatic fare such as "Ghost," Jerry Zucker
returned to the slapstick comedy genre last year with the wacky "Rat
Race," starring such farceurs as Rowan Atkinson, John Cleese, Whoopi
Goldberg, Cuba Gooding Jr., Seth Green, Jon Lovitz, Breckin Meyer and
Kathy Najimy. They're involved in a "It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad
World"-like race to collect $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD ($30) features the wide-screen version of the film, the
trailer, several outtakes, a funny gag reel, deleted scenes--Zucker
made a wise move when he decided to cut them--an average
behind-the-scenes featurette and an interview with Zucker and writer
Andy Breckman. The best extra on the disc finds Zucker and Breckman
calling up each member of the cast and talking to them about the
film.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Black History Month kicks off this week with several new DVDs.</TE>
<TE>   Though it gets a bit too reverential in tone, the documentary
"Muhammad Ali: Through the Eyes of the World" (Universal, $15 for
VHS; $20 for DVD) is a nifty, thorough look at the life and legend of
the famous boxer. The documentary is filled with archival fight
footage, photos and interviews with Ali, including his first
appearance on a local TV show, his first publicity photo and rare
footage of the champ at home with his family. Also included are
interviews with Billy Crystal, James Earl Jones, Lennox Lewis, Tom
Johns, Richard Harris, Billy Connelly, his daughter Hana and ex-wife
Veronica. The DVD features a photo gallery, a music video, a
chronology of his fights and a featurette.</TE>
<TE>   Paramount is celebrating Black History Month with the release of
five Eddie Murphy flicks on DVD ($25 each): the three "Beverly Hills
Cop" movies, "Vampire in Brooklyn" and "Harlem Nights." The best of
the lot is 1984's "Beverly Hills Cop," which is one of Murphy's
biggest hits. He plays Axel Foley, a maverick Detroit policeman who
travels west to track down the killer of his best friend. The cast
also sports Judge Reinhold, John Ashton and, in a scene-stealing
performance, Bronson Pinchot.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD is an enjoyable viewing experience, thanks to a
retrospective documentary on the making of the film that includes
interviews with producer Jerry Bruckheimer, screenwriter Daniel
Petrie Jr., Reinhold and director Martin Brest. Murphy's involvement,
though, is limited to a brief clip from a recent interview.</TE>
<TE>   There are also featurettes on the film's casting, locations and
the music. Rounding out the disc are a photo gallery, a theatrical
trailer and commentary by Brest ("Scent of a Woman"). One interesting
note: Sylvester Stallone originally was set to play Axel Foley.</TE>
<TE>   Also on tap for Black History Month is the 1954 musical "Carmen
Jones" (Fox, $20), Oscar Hammerstein II's reworking of the Bizet
opera with an African American cast. Dorothy Dandridge became the
first African American woman to be nominated for a best actress Oscar
for her role as a femme fatale who seduces a soldier (Harry
Belafonte). The DVD features a lovely new wide-screen transfer of the
film and the original trailer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Saturday is Groundhog Day, when the famous Punxsutawney Phil will
come out of his home in Punxsutawney, Pa., to predict how much longer
winter will last. Accordingly, Columbia TriStar has just released a
special edition of the rollicking 1993 comedy hit "Groundhog Day"
($25), starring Bill Murray in one of his best performances as a
cynical Pittsburgh TV weatherman assigned to cover the event. When he
finds himself stuck overnight in Punxsutawney due to a blizzard, he
wakes up the next morning and discovers that it is Groundhog Day
again. Andie MacDowell plays Murray's cheerful producer.</TE>
<TE>   The digital edition includes a retrospective documentary on the
making of the film, "The Weight of Time," which features interviews
with director Harold Ramis, MacDowell and co-star Stephen Tobolowsky
and behind-the-scenes clips of Murray cracking wise on the set.</TE>
<TE>   There is also a wide-screen version of the film, talent files,
production notes, trailers and amusing commentary from Ramis.</TE>
<TE>   The film, Ramis reports, was not shot in Punxsutawney, but in
Woodstock, Ill., because it was more visually appealing with its town
square.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Neither critics nor audiences embraced "The 6th Day," the 2000
Arnold Schwarzenegger futurist thriller about an evil corporation
that illegally duplicates human beings. But Columbia TriStar has just
released a two-disc "special edition" ($25) anyway, and it isn't very
special. There isn't commentary from Schwarzenegger or director Roger
Spottiswoode; only composer Trevor Rabin is on hand to discuss his
work on the isolated music track. The second disc includes nine
passable behind-the-scenes featurettes, a documentary on the
production that aired on Showtime, storyboard-to-film comparisons,
trailers and talent files.</TE>

<CX>   Format of Disney film--In the home video column in the Jan. 31
issue of Calendar Weekend, the animated film, "Atlantis: The Lost Empire"
was incorrectly called Disney's first CinemaScope production since
"Sleeping Beauty" in 1959. The two films actually were only released to
theaters in the CinemaScope format. "Sleeping Beauty" was filmed in
Technirama and "Atlantis" was created digitally.</CX>

<LD>"I'm jealous of my dog, Godot,</LD>
<LD>   No fields to plow, no seeds to sow;</LD>
<LD>   With lifted leg, tail taut and curled,</LD>
<TE>   He leaves his mark upon the world.</TE>
<TE>   I'm jealous of my dog, Godot,</TE>
<TE>   For all the things he does not know.</TE>
<TE>   He leads a fuller life than I,</TE>
<TE>   Not fearing that some day he'll die."</TE>
<TE>   --from "Godot," by Ruth Buell</TE>
<TE>   "Uncle Ruthie" Buell, host of L.A.'s longest-running children's
radio show, "Halfway Down the Stairs" on KPFK-FM (90.7), is mourning
the loss of her beloved companion, Godot, a canine of indeterminate
breed that she had taken to identifying, straight-faced, as a "New
Zealand Penguin Hound," after hearing the joking term from another
fond mutt owner.</TE>
<TE>   "He used to come to school every day," she said of the stray she
took in more than 18 years ago, when he was found outside the East
L.A. school where she taught music to children with disabilities.</TE>
<TE>   "He would pull the kids in their wheelchairs, he would be the
reward for doing work and," she laughed, "if we had an assembly, he
would sing off-key for us."</TE>
<TE>   Buell's show this Sunday will be something of a Godot
memorial--she will read her poem and reminisce--but also, through
story and song, Buell will celebrate the special connection between
humans and dogs, and reach out with comfort and empathy for listeners
who may have lost a pet of their own.</TE>
<TE>   Reaching out--with storytelling, music, humor and sensitivity--is
what Buell does in her signature low-key way. As with the death of
Godot, real life fuels her choices, especially when events occur that
may make children feel alone, sad or fearful.</TE>
<TE>   Buell has done shows about the Oklahoma bombing and the events of
Sept. 11; after the 1998 killing of gay University of Wyoming student
Matthew Shepard, she devoted one show to reading the series of comic
strips by Lynn Johnston (creator of "For Better or Worse") about a
teenage character's difficult coming-out to his friends and family.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time something happens I'll deal with it on the radio,"
Buell said.</TE>
<TE>   One of L.A.'s</TE>
<TE>   Best-Kept Secrets</TE>
<TE>   Buell started with KPFK at its inception in 1959. (Her late
husband was longtime classical music radio personality Bruce Buell;
she is now married to sculptor Stan Schwartz.) More than 30 years
ago, the folk singer and teacher adopted the name "Uncle Ruthie" and
began hosting "Halfway Down the Stairs."</TE>
<TE>   She's wryly aware that it's still one of L.A.'s best-kept secrets:
an eclectic, thoughtful, feel-good children's show on local radio's
counterculture haven for progressive politics, multiculturalism and
alternative programming.</TE>
<TE>   Buell calls her quirky mix of entertainment, education and
empowerment her "radio ministry," created for "warm, loving,
community-active beings" of all ages.</TE>
<TE>   It includes readings from authors ranging from Maurice Sendak,
Tomie de Paola and Daniel Pinkwater to James Thurber, Pablo Neruda
and William Saroyan, because she knows that at least as many adults
as children are fans.</TE>
<TE>   "If I like a story, it will be multilevel. Most good stories for
children are very good for adults." Her musical picks are equally
eclectic, with "hundreds of folk singers," children's artists and her
own songs, too.</TE>
<TE>   But Buell, warm-voiced, impish and indefatigable, isn't just a
radio personality. She does artist-in-residencies at schools,
workshops for teachers, records independently and performs in
concert. After Sunday's show, she'll appear at McCabe's Guitar Shop,
her own guitar in hand, where she'll perform an upbeat family matinee
with a varied program of folk tales, funny stories and children's
songs, along with multi-instrumentalist Fred Sokolow.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, she'll be back at her staff job of the past
three years: teaching music and chorus to vision-impaired children at
the Frances Blend School in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Did we mention that Buell, 71, is also a long-distance runner?</TE>
<TE>   "I can outrun all of the P.E. teachers at school," she joked. "I'm
turning into my mother: At 90 she would bat her eyes at people and
say, 'How old do you think I am?'"</TE>
<TE>   Buell, whose teaching partner is musician David Wulff, thought
that she had retired as an educator until three years ago, when she
joined the teaching staff at Frances Blend. She has no intention of
retiring again and Principal Joy Efron is grateful.</TE>
<TE>   "She's tremendously energetic," Efron said. "She's creative, she
does an outstanding job of linking music to language and
communication, she has an intuitive sense in working with
multi-handicapped students, and she does tremendous things for
self-esteem. And she makes everything so much fun. We are so lucky to
have her."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Today capitalists in New York City and anarchists, socialists and
radicals of every stripe in Porto Alegre, Brazil, will take on the
same big issue: how to convince rich nations to invest in the well-
being of poor people in poor countries. There is precious little
common ground between the powerful men and women attending the World
Economic Forum and the angry outsiders convening for Porto Alegre's
World Social Forum. But it's encouraging that the latter group, which
vehemently opposes corporate globalization, has matured to the point
that it's seeking legal and nonviolent means to achieve change. More
heartening still is that the people meeting in New York seem to
acknowledge that while globalization is now a fact of life, the world
won't fully accept--and free trade and international cooperation
won't truly thrive--until power brokers address the monumental matter
of social and economic inequity.</LD>
<LD>   The 30-year-old World Economic Forum, traditionally held in Davos,
Switzerland, is a well-known platform for debate and action on key
global issues. About 3,000 invitees, including 30 heads of
government, the archbishop of Canterbury and Hamid Karzai, the
interim leader of Afghanistan, will attend this year's event.</LD>
<TE>   The so-called global justice movement is a hodgepodge of activists
within a very loosely knit network in the United States, Europe and
the Third World. Some participants come from labor, others from
religious or peasants' organizations, with environmentalists,
students and teachers swelling the ranks. What unites them is the
fight to rid the world of sweatshops and the overuse of fossil fuels
and their support for the rights of workers, indigenous people, women
and immigrants. About 60,000 of these folks are due today in Porto
Alegre, where discussions will center on alternatives to
corporation-led globalization.</TE>
<TE>   With luck, the Social Forum organizers will be able to avert the
street violence that has marred anti-globalization protests from
Seattle to Davos to Genoa. And while the power brokers meeting in New
York will certainly--and should certainly--ignore the naive
anti-capitalist ravings of the fringe protesters, they'd be well
advised to pay attention to certain underlying themes.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of globalization, for instance, encourage the strategic
cancellation of poor nations' debt. Already some labor groups are
working with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to
this end. This is not just a give-away. It can have positive
reverberations even in the strongest economies. In 1999, the leaders
of the seven major industrial countries agreed to erase up to $27
billion in debts owed by as many as 41 impoverished countries. To
qualify, the countries had to funnel the savings into health and
education programs. The participants at the Economic Forum should
look at this as a blueprint for addressing the Social Forum's
concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Another thing: At the World Trade Organization meeting last fall,
governments agreed to give poor countries better discounts on drugs
for AIDS and other killer diseases. This is the sort of progress that
can occur when people with competing visions let their fiery rhetoric
cool and start to listen. Let's hope that happens again this week.</TE>

<LD>Japanese officials love speaking of their devotion to consensus,
harmony, inclusion. Bosses ask employees for their opinions on new
programs and products. Everyone knows well the aphoristic warning:
"The nail that sticks out gets hammered down." Apparently someone
forgot to tell the foreign minister.</LD>
<LD>   Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi called in Foreign Minister Makiko
Tanaka on Tuesday and fired her, ending a 10-month drama that rivals
any Noh or Kabuki play. In a country that throws a blanket over
controversy, Tanaka and her underlings in the Foreign Ministry
quarreled publicly virtually from the start of her reign. Japan ate
it up; her favorable ratings were around 70%, about the same level as
Koizumi's--and for much the same reason: a promise of change after
years of stagnation.</LD>
<LD>   The prime minister swept into office promising to restore an
economic system that not long ago had positioned Japan at the top of
the world. The last decade has been so disastrous that a generation
with little recollection of Japan's postwar devastation wonders
whether the problems are systemic. Hint: yes.</LD>
<TE>   Tanaka too promised to change a hidebound ministry. Not that the
U.S. State Department or Britain's Foreign Office are hotbeds of
innovation. But Japanese ministries are notorious for resistance to
change, and Tanaka had difficulties almost from the start. She tried
to get to the bottom of a series of ministry scandals involving
padded expense accounts and slush funds. That quickly earned her
enemies who were happy to detail all her blunders to the press.</TE>
<TE>   Women especially saw Tanaka as powerful in a land where women have
little power. But she bungled much of it away. She complained about
not being invited to a party--very bad etiquette in this traditional
culture. She stood up a visiting U.S. diplomat. She skipped meetings
and committed verbal gaffes. It was surprising that after watching
her father, Kakuei Tanaka, preside in the 1970s as one of the
country's most powerful prime ministers, she hadn't picked up a few
more political skills.</TE>
<TE>   Koizumi let it go on far too long. He has not made much use of his
own high ratings, instead puttering around the edges while the
banking system rots and industrial production drops. Average
Japanese, frozen out of the system but hoping for a louder voice
under Koizumi, now may see their hopes dashed.</TE>
<TE>   Japan's impressive comeback from the ruins of war provides the
foundation for continued success in a more open society with a more
involved electorate. Koizumi needs to use his constituents' good
feelings to change the nation to one where elected officials, not
career bureaucrats, determine policy.</TE>

<LD>Like an effective tonic misplaced at the back of the medicine chest,
the idea of adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare has been
gathering dust since both parties shelved it after the 2000 election.
In his State of the Union speech Tuesday, President Bush called for
more affordable prescription drugs. He had already told legislators
he wanted to set aside $77 billion over 10 years to help states
provide prescription drug coverage to people in families with incomes
of up to about $20,000 a year. The president has also asked Congress
to shell out an additional $113 billion over 10 years for a still
murky "comprehensive Medicare reform" plan that would give a
prescription drug benefit to all seniors in Medicare.</LD>
<LD>   Now legislators should press Bush to improve his plans before he
finalizes the 2003 budget proposal he will submit to Congress next
Monday. Leaders of both parties have already promised to set aside at
least $100 billion more than the president has proposed. The
challenge will be to do more than fling money at a problem that
voters are eager to see remedied. At a minimum, congressional members
must ensure that the plan meets these two basic goals:</LD>
<TE>   * Washington must cover all drugs that doctors deem medically
essential. The current Bush plan would let states decide which drugs
should be covered. This could encourage state legislators to spend
erratically, funding drugs for a favorite disease of the month at the
expense of other treatments--paying for Viagra, for instance, but not
for infertility treatments, as California's managed care agency once
recommended.</TE>
<TE>   * Give the neediest middle-class Americans relief from soaring
drug costs now. Under the Bush plan, states could use some of the $77
billion to help low-income Americans as early as this fall, but they
wouldn't receive a penny of the $113 billion until fiscal year 2006.
That's scant comfort to the thousands of working-class families that
every year teeter on the edge of bankruptcy to pay for the medicines
their loved ones need to stay alive. What's needed is a new
"catastrophic drug benefit" to help the sickest Americans, not just
those in families making less than $20,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   These families' hardships are likely to grow with the recession
and the increasing cost of drugs. When 77 million baby boomers start
retiring in 2010, things will only get worse. That's why Congress and
Bush must stop playing at reform and commit serious time and money to
the problem now, even if it is more fun to bask in foreign policy
triumphs and patriotic fervor.</TE>

<LD>Your sad report on squatters ruining Mexico City's green areas
("Urban Spread Is Staining Greenery of Mexico City," Jan. 28)
unfortunately misses the real problem. The article focuses on Mexican
proposals to tighten law enforcement, subsidize farmers to avoid
sales to developers and even, incredibly, to prevent squatters from
voting. These measures will fail because they don't face the real
problem, which is that the squatters are part of a wave of
environmental and economic refugees from the rural areas forced off
their land by government policy to get rid of peasant farming and
turn it over to chemical-intensive, capital-intensive big
agribusiness.</LD>
<LD>   The roots of the policy go back decades, but it was officially
enshrined in the North American Free Trade Agreement--in spite of
studies predicting it would wreak ecological havoc on the countryside
and would push 5 million to 15 million farmers into the cities and
across borders. This is the specific reason that the Zapatista
peasant rebels chose to rise up against the Mexican government on the
day NAFTA went into effect--Jan. 1, 1994, and declared: NAFTA is our
death sentence. We do not accept our death sentence.</LD>

<LD>In "We Have the Inalienable Right to a Quiet Dinner," (Commentary,
Jan. 28), Robert Kuttner calls for the government to regulate
something that people can regulate on their own: the use of their own
telephone. If people are bothered by calls during a meal, or during a
shower, or during lovemaking, or while sleeping at night, they can:</LD>
<LD>   Turn off the ringer; or let the machine or the voice mail take the
call; or buy caller ID and don't answer unknown calls.</LD>
<LD>   So many people are slaves to their telephones. There is absolutely
no reason to answer it if you are busy with something else. I don't
answer the phone when it's inconvenient, and I doubt I have missed
very many important calls. We don't need more government--we just
need some common sense.</LD>

<LD>Mayor James Hahn's current selection of appointees fails to
accurately represent the districts that helped him win the mayoral
office, much less Los Angeles itself ("Most Hahn Appointees Are From
Wealthy Areas," Jan. 24). Hopefully, Hahn will not allow the fate of
poorer districts to be shaped by those who see the communities' needs
in terms of facts and figures instead of people.</LD>
<LD>   If there are any postelection favors to be done, Hahn needs panels
that are more diverse for decisions affecting South-Central, the San
Fernando Valley and everywhere between. To suggest that some areas
are not home to potential civilian panel members is a poor excuse.
Those willing to serve are qualified for one simple reason--it's
their home.</LD>

<LD>Re "Justice Dept. Puts Statues Under Wraps," Jan. 29: Let me get this
straight. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft recuses himself from the Enron
issue; something to hide? Now, he decides that there is something
more important to hide. He protects us from some of our country's
historic artwork by purchasing $8,000 in drapes to cover nude statues
that have been in place for some 70 years. When did his job become
one of being art critic and moral arbiter for our nation? The hiding
of the artwork is reminiscent of the type of judgments made by the
Taliban. Isn't it time that he focused on the duties of the job and
paid more attention to legal judgments rather than religious
judgments?</LD>

<TE>   The $8,000 spent on the blue drapes covering Lady Spirit of
Justice and her mate could have been saved. The statues could have
been covered with blue burkas discarded by liberated Afghan women.
This could be most symbolic, and Ashcroft would be spared future
embarrassment.</TE>

<LD>Re "Poll Says College Freshmen Lean Left," Jan. 28: According to
UCLA's survey of college freshmen, volunteering is at an all-time
high. Yet young adults are the lowest-voting population in the
country. The survey confirms a well-observed trend among young
adults. Fortunately, young adults are not apathetic; they choose not
to vote because they feel they have a greater impact on their
communities through volunteering than they do through voting.</LD>
<LD>   The gap between volunteering and voting deserves immediate
attention by all those concerned with strengthening California's
democracy. The gubernatorial candidates are in a unique position to
engage young adults in the upcoming general election. By pledging to
participate in a televised youth debate, the candidates could
communicate to California's young adults that their votes are
instrumental to the future of their communities and California's
democracy.</LD>

<TE>   It is not surprising that many college freshmen define themselves
as "liberal," as most students have not yet encountered the realities
of life that will surely change their political outlook. Once those
students graduate, there will be no student loans or "parental
scholarships" to support them. Upon gainful employment, they will be
subject to the same punitive tax system designed for wealth
redistribution as the rest of us. Their perceived rights and freedoms
will be imposed upon by the liberal concepts of social engineering,
over-regulation and "political correctness." The 73.6% of college
freshmen who said they want to be "very well off financially" will
surely see that liberal political beliefs and their financial goals
are not compatible.</TE>

one who noticed in the article that the freeway signs are going to be
replaced over a three-year period as part of the normal
sign-replacement maintenance cycle at an additional cost of $30
million? If the signs are going to be replaced anyway, why the
$30-million cost?</LD>
<LD>   I suspect there isn't much more than a few thousand dollars worth
of paint in graffiti covering nearly every exit sign and overpass on
the freeway system. Maybe we should have those caught painting
graffiti do the work, since they seem to be better cost managers.</LD>

<LD>Re "Bush Vows to Take War on Terror to Hostile Nations, Calls for
Unity," Jan. 30:</LD>
<LD>   To accomplish several highly diverse, ambitious (and probably
conflicting) goals, the president calls for bipartisanship. As our
representatives attempt to resolve just how those initially appealing
goals are to be interpreted and achieved, deep divisions are bound to
exert powerful forces.</LD>
<LD>   It appears that the president has not visibly recognized that the
influence of big money has heavily distorted the democratic voting
process in government. We have seen the nation's resources of all
kinds increasingly stolen away from the public good and wasted.
Campaign finance reform is a most essential first step that can
restore some of the influence of the ordinary voting citizen on his
or her representatives, and I am convinced that until major reform is
brought into effect the state of the union will have a disastrous
future.</LD>
<TE>   Robert A. Willett</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   President Bush's speech consisted of boasts and promises made with
transparent intent. Where is the honor in boasting that our nation's
military defeated an unsophisticated, little-trained, under-armed,
loosely assembled militia? Where is the dignity in a promise of
deficit spending followed by proclamations of increased domestic
funding for social projects?</TE>
<TE>   John Waters Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Palm Springs</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After the State of the Union address, Democratic congressmen were
falling over themselves praising the president's speech in ways
reminiscent of "the emperor's clothes look wonderful." Aren't there
any real Democrats anymore who aren't afraid to speak their minds?</TE>

<TE>   Huh? I too applaud President Bush's State of the Union message. A
strong military, beefing up Social Security, better pay for teachers,
help with medical drugs for seniors, protecting workers and their
retirement funds. Sounds like a Democrat to me.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Once again Bush is waving the flag over the war he doesn't have
the guts to come out and declare. Let's remember that the
administration doesn't want an overt war because it might mean giving
those nasty "rights" to people Bush has personally decided are
subject to secret trials. Just because we catch someone and put him
in a cage in Cuba doesn't mean that person is guilty of anything. I
am tired of seeing this undeclared war used as a cover for every
controversial and scurrilous position that politicians of both
stripes want to push through.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It amazes me to read about the struggle for public beach access in
Southern California ("Activists Press Geffen for Beach Path," Jan.
29). I just returned from Maui, Hawaii, where multimillion-dollar
houses are adjacent to very public beaches, with no access difficulty
whatsoever. I can imagine that a homeowner there, attempting to block
access, would be confronted with instant rebellion from the locals
and tourists. Why have Californians accepted this two-tier beach
society for so long?</LD>

<TE>   Excuse me for another rehash of the public's right to access the
beach, but isn't this the law? And what on Earth makes these
extremely wealthy folks believe they are above the law? Isn't this
why we make laws? Let's all set a good example and obey the law.</TE>

<HD>Oil Isn't All the Saudis Offer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD HRAIR DEKMEJIAN</AU>
<BD>Richard Hrair Dekmejian is a professor of political
science at USC and author of "Islam in Revolution: Fundamentalism in
the Arab World" (Syracuse University, 1995) and "Troubled Waters:
Geopolitics of the Caspian Region" (I.B. Tauris, 2002).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ever since the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States, U.S.-Saudi
relations have been under extreme stress. After a half-century of
cooperation and friendship, the giant oil kingdom and the world's
biggest superpower are fast reaching a point of crisis, unless both
take steps to decrease tension.</LD>
<LD>   After months of reticence, Saudi Arabia took a first step last
week when Crown Prince Abdullah reached out to the U.S. to make
amends about the role of Saudi citizens in the September attacks.</LD>
<LD>   "[Osama] bin Laden is a deviant, regardless of his nationality,"
he said in an interview with the New York Times and Washington Post.
Bin Laden's objective, the prince added, "was to drive a wedge
between the kingdom and the United States."</LD>
<TE>   But, at the same time, the prince voiced his concerns about the
drift of U.S. policy in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S., he said, "has a duty to follow its conscience to reject
repression" of the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, Saudi public opinion is strongly opposed to the U.S.
military presence in Saudi Arabia and to the maintenance of close
ties with the U.S., particularly in view of the deteriorating
Israeli-Palestinian situation. To be able to justify to their own
people their close relationship with the U.S., the Saudis want to see
a decisive peacemaking role by the Bush administration to stop the
bloodshed in the Mideast and resume an Israeli-Palestinian peace
process.</TE>
<TE>   Given unfavorable popular sentiments within Saudi Arabia, the
country's leadership is taking a risk in continuing its pro-American
stance.</TE>
<TE>   While it is true that the country still needs a U.S. guarantee to
defend itself against regional enemies, such as Iraq, the risk of its
alliance with the U.S. could become unmanageable as a threat to a
regime's legitimacy and power. Then, self-interest would require a
change in policy.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the kingdom's self-interest could prompt it to refuse
the United State use of its bases to attack Iraq, should it decide to
do so. Such an attack would likely trigger a convulsion in the region
that would be a disaster for both Saudi Arabia and the United States.</TE>
<TE>   As for the United States, it is imperative that the Saudis make
changes in the kingdom's conservative educational system and
religious socialization--the system that gave birth to Bin Laden and
his followers, including 15 of the 19 hijackers involved in the Sept.
11 attacks--and further curtail financial aid to Islamist extremist
groups abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the negative tenor of the American media and public
opinion about Saudi Arabia, it should be understood that the United
States and Saudi Arabia need each other and that there are no good
alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   Any harm to Saudi rule would be ruinous for all concerned--the
United States, the West and the Islamic world.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, there is no substitute for Saudi oil for the foreseeable
future. And none of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries or
neighboring Arab states would permit a United States military
presence as an alternative to Saudi bases, at least not under the
present circumstances. But to alleviate concerns within Saudi Arabia,
it would be best for the United States to maintain a lower military
profile with fewer soldiers, while seeking Saudi cooperation against
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   In view of the serious strategic and economic implications of a
rupture between Saudi Arabia and the United States, both must take
preventive measures to strengthen their commonality of interests. Yet
the ultimate fate of the special relationship may well depend on
whether the United States can broker a peace in the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</TE>

<HD>New Nurse-Patient Ratios Will Ensure Better Care</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSE ANN DeMORO</AU>
<BD>Rose Ann DeMoro is executive director of the California
Nurses Assn., a union and professional association that represents
44,000 nurses.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Release of California's proposed new nurse-to-patient ratios is
welcome news for those who have experienced long waits for care in
understaffed hospitals and emergency rooms.</LD>
<LD>   The new ER ratios will have an especially dramatic impact at a
time when emergency rooms are closing and patients are enduring long
waits for access to medical services while unstaffed beds sit empty.</LD>
<LD>   California's regulations are the first in the nation, but they
won't be the last as policymakers grapple with a seemingly
intractable shortage of nurses.</LD>
<TE>   The problem is the direct result of 10 years of reckless,
market-driven practices by a hospital industry pressured by health
maintenance organizations, pharmaceutical companies and other
industry giants in pursuit of profits at the expense of patient care.</TE>
<TE>   After years of losing jobs to unlicensed staff, many frustrated
registered nurses simply voted with their feet and refused to work in
hospitals that they felt endangered patients' and their own
well-being.</TE>
<TE>   Hospitals have tried a variety of gimmicks such as huge signing
bonuses to attract nurses.</TE>
<TE>   But nurses will not remain in unsafe hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   The shortage problem is not just that nurses are getting older. A
National Institutes of Health study last May found that one-third of
nurses younger than 30 said that they plan to leave their jobs in the
coming year because of poor conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Although the total number of RNs continues to grow, fewer work in
hospitals, with many now choosing to work in medical offices,
insurance companies, home health agencies or schools.</TE>
<TE>   Only a comprehensive approach can stop the exodus of nurses from
hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   Ratios are an essential first step in this effort to repair
patient care standards and persuade nurses that hospitals are again a
safe place for their patients and themselves.</TE>
<TE>   All other approaches can succeed only after safe ratios are
imposed.</TE>
<TE>   Safe ratios will help stop the hemorrhaging of the current nurse
work force.</TE>
<TE>   Through collective bargaining, the California Nurses Assn. has won
other workplace changes, giving nurses a greater voice in
patient-care decisions and banning dangerous practices such as
mandatory overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis deserves praise for his bold actions and support
for nurses and patients. But the state should not bear the financial
burden alone.</TE>
<TE>   The health care industry that created this crisis through
shortsighted cost-cutting should provide a dollar-for-dollar match
for programs to retrain other staff and help pay for training
registered nurses.</TE>
<TE>   The hospitals, which bitterly opposed the safe staffing
regulations that Davis proposed, should embrace them immediately to
restore safe patient care conditions.</TE>

<HD>So What If They Hate the U.S.?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWARD BERNARD GLICK</AU>
<BD>Edward Bernard Glick is a professor emeritus of
political science at Temple University in Philadelphia.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The purveyors of international opinion, particularly in Western
Europe, are at it again. This time, they're criticizing the United
States for its supposed mistreatment of the Taliban and Al Qaeda
prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Before that, they criticized us
for detaining people from the Middle East who may be here illegally,
as if that were not a serious offense.</LD>
<LD>   I wonder, though, how would Frenchmen, Britons and Swedes be
behaving now if, instead of destroying New York's World Trade Center
on Sept. 11, terrorists had killed 3,000 people in attacks on the
Eiffel Tower in Paris, the area around Big Ben in London or the
Swedish Parliament in Stockholm?</LD>
<LD>   Americans should be very wary of European public opinion.</LD>
<TE>   With few exceptions, Europe's elites, particularly on the left,
always have been publicly contemptuous (and privately jealous) of the
U.S. They have mocked our dynamism, openness, diversity, informality,
social mobility and our appeal to the huddled masses of the world.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the fact that the U.S. saved Europe in both world wars,
and left thousands of its soldiers buried in its graveyards while
doing so, Europe cannot forgive history for its having ceded to us in
the New World the Old World's erstwhile cultural, diplomatic,
economic and military dominance.</TE>
<TE>   When European intellectuals and their U.S. counterparts proclaim
that the peoples of the world hate the U.S., they forget that
Americans are not the ones who are paying fortunes of money to be
smuggled into other countries. It's the other way around.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing delights liberal Americans and foreigners more than
seeking solutions acceptable to world public opinion. Yet nothing is
more difficult for them to grasp than the myth of international
public opinion. Because of different perceptions of justice,
democracy, self-determination, colonialism and imperialism, world
public opinion is a phenomenon that really doesn't exist.</TE>
<TE>   In the heat of an issue, how many people stop to realize that what
passes for world public opinion isn't based on an agreed-upon value
system, that it is not always objective, that it is hard to define,
that it is easily manufactured or manipulated, that it is fragmented
and ephemeral, that it has a short memory and that it can often turn
out to be wrong?</TE>
<TE>   Take the matter of definition. How should one define world public
opinion on a given issue? By the level of violence committed in its
name? By its repetition? By its media coverage? By the language and
number of resolutions that the United Nations has adopted on the
issue?</TE>
<TE>   Or take its fickle and forgetful nature. The world public opinion
that condemned U.S. intervention in Vietnam is the same that ignored
China's conquest of Tibet. The foreign intellectuals who condemned
U.S. use of nonlethal tear gas during the Vietnam War were the same
intellectuals who maintained silence when Iraq used lethal poison gas
during the Iraq-Iran War.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, when a democracy such as the U.S. enters something as
momentous as the war on terrorism, it is obliged to debate, explain
and, if possible, justify its actions. But when Thomas Jefferson
admonished us, in the Declaration of Independence, to afford "a
decent respect to the opinions of mankind," he did not mean blind
obedience.</TE>
<TE>   When U.S. national interests are involved, when there is no other
choice in, say, fighting terrorism or preventing rogue states from
using weapons of mass destruction, the U.S. must do what it must do,
even if that means defying the multifarious voices of mirage-like
public opinion.</TE>

<HD>Anarcho-Terrorists Cut Their Teeth on Video Games</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NORAH VINCENT</AU>
<BD>Norah Vincent is a senior fellow at the Foundation for
the Defense of Democracies, a think tank set up after Sept. 11 to
study terrorism.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The best thing about it," he said, "is you can do anything. You can
kill a cop, take his squad car, pick up a prostitute and make a drug
deal with her."</LD>
<LD>   I had just bought a Sony Play- Station 2 and was asking a
knowledgeable twentysomething acquaintance of mine about two
PlayStation games.</LD>
<LD>   Buying a video game system seemed innocent enough at the time, a
little distraction from the daily scribble, a harmless dabble in the
technographics culture I'd been hearing so much about.</LD>
<TE>   But now that I've already got tendinitis from playing the thing
for hours on end, I've come to realize that there's nothing innocent
about it.</TE>
<TE>   On the contrary. It's pernicious. Not only is it as addictive as
gambling but it also elicits and abets the worst and darkest
instincts in human nature.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, it allows you to act them out at your own warped
discretion.</TE>
<TE>   The guy was right. You can do anything. Anything at all. The sense
of freedom--no, unmitigated license--is intoxicating. It's as if
you've been handed Plato's ring of Giges, making you invisible,
unaccountable, unencumbered by fear of retribution and monstrous as a
result. It's the ultimate ticket to ride.</TE>
<TE>   There you are, a lone figure in a ripe dystopia where every door
opens, every fence can be climbed, every car can be stolen, every
pedestrian can be beaten to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Everything is permitted. Nothing matters.</TE>
<TE>   There are no consequences, and so the urge to see what happens if
you do "this" or "that" is irresistible. Flattened by a truck? Just
get up again. Crashed the car? Steal another. Someone in your way?
Whack him. And all of this mayhem at the jerk of a joystick. Not
exactly the most adaptive use of those handy opposable thumbs, but
devilish entertainment nonetheless.</TE>
<TE>   But as legions of protesters are poised like locusts to descend on
New York City to protest the World Economic Forum beginning today, it
strikes me as not in the least surprising that the wired generation
(of whom these legions are mostly composed) should have turned to
anarcho-terrorism as a form of political protest.</TE>
<TE>   Weaned on video games such as Urban Chaos and Grand Theft Auto
III, which are virtual seminars in sociopathy, and neurologically
conditioned through hours of practice to indulge their basest urges,
it makes sense that today's extremists behave badly in the real
world--a world they no doubt have difficulty distinguishing from
their free-for-all fantasies.</TE>
<TE>   Scenes from Seattle in 1999, where a World Trade Organization
meeting was beset by rioters throwing urine and scrap metal at cops
and tossing newspaper boxes and trash cans through store windows,
could be stock footage from any of the PlayStation or the Microsoft
Xbox or the Nintendo GameCube games you can rent at Blockbuster.</TE>
<TE>   Same goes for the melees that erupted in 2000 at the World Trade
Organization meeting in Melbourne and again at the G8 economic summit
in Genoa last summer.</TE>
<TE>   The law enforcement tendency to use nonlethals such as tear gas
and rubber bullets lends an even greater sense of unreality to these
outbursts, which may be why everyone was so shocked when a rioter was
killed by real police bullets in Genoa after he threw a fire
extinguisher at their police cruiser.</TE>
<TE>   The deterrent effect of using deadly force combined with the
no-nonsense aura post-Sept. 11 also may be why the New York Police
Department is promising to institute what amounts to martial law,
complete with sniffer dogs and checkpoints, for the next four days
while the meeting is going on.</TE>
<TE>   But I'm all for it.</TE>
<TE>   If they can make it real, maybe the authorities can jolt these
pseudo-road warriors out of their cyber-induced taste for wanton
destruction and confront them with the harsh lesson that when real
blood and nasty fallout are involved, anarchy isn't all it's mocked
up to be.</TE>

<KH>SURROUNDINGS / THE BRIDGE TO NOWHERE</KH>
<HD>A Span Without a Reason, Frozen in Time</HD>
<DH>An elegant Depression- era structure exists in a remote
part of the Angeles National Forest, unattached to any road.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID FERRELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If Rod Serling were inventing a bridge, this would be it: a two-lane
highway span 4 1/2 miles from the nearest road. A bridge completed
high in a rocky river gorge and all but forgotten for 66 years. A
bridge of uncommon architectural elegance that has never carried a
single car.</LD>
<LD>   Government maps do not even show the single-arch span that crosses
the East Fork of the San Gabriel River, deep in the Angeles National
Forest. The Thomas Guide, however, does note the bridge along with
its nickname--a name that Serling, the late "Twilight Zone" host,
would have loved:</LD>
<LD>   The Bridge to Nowhere.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a shock when you see it, it seems so far out of place," says
veteran hiker and wilderness writer John W. Robinson, whose book,
"The San Gabriels," recounts the ill-fated attempt to forge a road
through the forbidding terrain.</TE>
<TE>   The project, begun in 1929, took nearly a decade. Los Angeles
County highway engineers relied heavily on prison labor to dig and
blast the snaking route along the East Fork's steep canyon walls,
Robinson says. The low-lying highway was intended as a new means of
travel from the Los Angeles Basin to the ski resorts of Big Pines and
Wrightwood. Running east of Angeles Crest Highway, it would have
served Azusa, Irwindale and other towns of the San Gabriel Valley.</TE>
<TE>   At the Narrows of the East Fork, engineers encountered the
steepest river gorge in Southern California--a V-shaped cut between
Mt. Baden-Powell (elevation 9,400 feet) and Iron Mountain (8,000
feet). Pine-covered ridges conceal the mountaintops, but the vertical
feel of the space makes it daunting and breathtaking.</TE>
<TE>   The concrete bridge was constructed across the lower part of the
chasm even while roadway work was underway. The bridge extends about
230 feet from a heavy rock buttress on one end to a steep ridge on
the other. From the concrete balustrade you can peer down more than
100 feet to the rocky churn of the rapids.</TE>
<TE>   Downpour Doomed Highway Project</TE>
<TE>   Stamped on the end of the balustrade is a date: 1936. The bridge
had yet to open--the highway was still under construction--when Los
Angeles was hit by a so-called 100-year downpour.</TE>
<TE>   "The great storm of the night of March 2, 1938 ... the biggest
storm of the 20th century," says Robinson, who was in grammar school
at the time. He would later, as part of his research, examine the
swelling of the East Fork from its normal depth--2 or 3 feet--to a
torrent 30 or 40 feet high.</TE>
<TE>   "It brought down boulders as big as garages. It washed out
hundreds of [miners'] cabins--anything that was close to the stream,"
he says.</TE>
<TE>   Evidently, no one kept rainfall totals deep in the forest,
Robinson says. But the storm ascending over the mountains probably
resulted in twice or three times the deluge that fell in the city, he
figures.</TE>
<TE>   Heavy snowpack melted by the relatively warm rains also may have
contributed to the flood, says Glen Owens of the Big Santa Anita
Historical Society.</TE>
<TE>   After the skies cleared, the road was so broken up and washed out
the county decided to abandon it. Only the bridge remained intact,
along with a tunnel through the ridge immediately north of it.</TE>
<TE>   Some years later, the county sealed the tunnel--apparently because
of liability concerns--and ceased maintenance of the bridge. What it
cost to build, who designed it and even its exact dimensions are lost
to the historical record.</TE>
<TE>   "We're really not dealing with the bridge anymore," says Ken
Pellman, a spokesman for the county Department of Public Works. "We
vacated it a long time ago."</TE>
<TE>   A few short chunks of the bridge railing have fallen away, but
otherwise it's in remarkably pristine condition. The roadbed is not
only uncracked but unmarked. Builders had yet to even paint the
yellow stripe down the center.</TE>
<TE>   The design is characteristic of other notable bridges of the era:
The main arch is formed of two closely set parallel arches joined by
short spokes. Columns are arranged the same way, in identical linked
pairs, creating a fine latticed appearance also evident at the
more-famous Colorado Street Bridge, constructed in 1913 in Pasadena,
and the Bixby Creek Bridge, finished in 1931 on California 1 south of
Carmel.</TE>
<TE>   "What stood out in my mind," says Gene Mezereny, who hiked to the
Bridge to Nowhere recently, "was how well it blends into the
surrounding landscape." He voices a love of those old arch bridges,
which he says look so beautiful compared with "the concrete
monstrosities you see nowadays."</TE>
<TE>   Mezereny, a longtime outdoorsman who has visited the bridge half a
dozen times, says he has noticed comparable lines in the rock
formations of Utah's Natural Bridges National Monument.</TE>
<TE>   "There's one [sandstone formation] I've been to several times ...
that's similar in shade and texture," he says. "It's a bit of a
stretch, but as far as the arch of the bridge [is concerned], it has
a similar look and feel."</TE>
<TE>   Finding the bridge is easy--you just follow the river north from
the ranger station on East Fork Road. But the nine-mile round trip is
an all-day journey. For stretches, the trail disappears and you walk
on the rocks and push through brush.</TE>
<TE>   There are stands of alder and sycamore, towering yuccas, banks of
scrub and sage. Here and there the precipitous bank contains broken
ledges of asphalt left over from the road project. Where immense
boulders and rock faces make one side of the river impassable, you
have to cross and continue up the other flank.</TE>
<TE>   Inaccessible During Rainy Season</TE>
<TE>   I hiked in December and had to make 10 crossings before reaching
the bridge. Now that the rains are swelling the rapids, rangers
advise against making the trek at all.</TE>
<TE>   A bullet-riddled metal sign marks a rise in the trail just before
the bridge. It warns against loitering, hunting, prospecting or
bungee jumping. For a time, before authorities cracked down, the
bridge was a popular bungee-jumping location.</TE>
<TE>   Owens, the historian, has hiked to the bridge by traveling south
from Angeles Crest Highway. From that direction, the bridge comes
fully into view at once--a startling sight that, to Owens, mars the
beauty of the Narrows. He calls the bridge a monument to man's defeat
by the forces of nature.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson, the author, more bluntly labels the bridge a monument to
man's folly. He has tried to research the bridge's name. The original
name--if there was one--is also apparently lost to the record.</TE>
<TE>   As far as he can tell, the new appellation may have surfaced in
the 1950s. "By the 1960s, it was an established name," he says. "I
don't know who first thought of it. It just sort of appeared.
Everybody calls it the Bridge to Nowhere."</TE>

<HD>R. Bolt, 90; Studied Nixon Tape</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Richard H. Bolt, an acoustics expert whose findings on a mysterious
18-minute gap in a crucial Watergate tape intensified pressure on the
Nixon White House, has died. He was 90.</LD>
<LD>   He had Alzheimer's disease and died Jan. 13 at a nursing home in
Rochester, N.Y.</LD>
<LD>   Bolt formed a small consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass., in 1948
when he was hired to design the acoustics for the grand hall of the
U.N. building in New York City.</LD>
<TE>   Bolt, Beranek and Newman, later BBN Corp., rose to the top of its
field primarily by designing acoustics for schools and businesses. It
rarely accepted forensic work.</TE>
<TE>   But in 1973, Bolt was one of six experts chosen jointly by the
White House and the special prosecutor's office to examine a tape
made June 20, 1972, three days after the infamous break-in at the
Democratic National Headquarters in the Washington office building
called Watergate.</TE>
<TE>   According to handwritten notes by President Nixon's then-chief of
staff, H.R. "Bob" Haldeman, the tape contained a conversation between
the two men in which Nixon ordered a public relations offensive to
counteract negative publicity from the break-in. Reporters had
questioned why the Watergate burglars had phone numbers to the White
House.</TE>
<TE>   When investigators examined the tape, that part of the
Nixon-Haldeman exchange was missing. The only mention of Watergate in
the conversation apparently had been erased.</TE>
<TE>   Was the erasure "caused by accident," as U.S. District Judge John
J. Sirica, who presided over the Watergate case, put it, "or was it
deliberately done?"</TE>
<TE>   Accidental, the White House said. Nixon's personal secretary, Rose
Mary Woods, testified that she had stopped transcribing the tape to
answer a phone and that she must have stepped on the wrong pedal and
pressed record when she meant to press stop. She insisted, however,
that she had taken no more than five minutes to handle the phone
call.</TE>
<TE>   But Alexander Haig, who succeeded Haldeman as Nixon's top aide,
said women that often lose track of time on the phone and that Woods
was probably responsible for the whole gap.</TE>
<TE>   What Bolt and the other technical experts found cast serious doubt
on the White House's explanation.</TE>
<TE>   After coating the tape with a magnetic fluid, the experts examined
it for minute markings made by the operation of the recording
machine. During two months of study, they found what they called the
"quartet signature"--four tiny lines, each less than a millimeter
high--made by the Uher 2000 tape recorder every time erasing was
halted. There were five such magnetic "stop" signatures on the
18-minute length of tape. Also found were markings that showed nine
starts to the erasures.</TE>
<TE>   What this meant, the experts said in testimony presented in
January 1974, was that the 18-minute gap was the result of at least
five and as many as nine separate attempts to erase and rerecord.
That contradicted the notion that it was caused by one long, mistaken
press of a pedal.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the obliterations were deliberate, as congressional
investigators believed, or a mistake, as the White House asserted,
could not be determined. But when Bolt, who headed the expert panel,
was asked whether the erasure could be an accident, he said it would
have to be an accident that was committed at least five times in 18
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, if you want to say a monkey jumped up and down on the keys,
or that stones fell on them nine times, fine," he said later.</TE>
<TE>   Most in Washington quickly understood what the sound analysis
meant.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the most serious single bit of evidence to date," Rep.
John B. Anderson of Illinois, then the leader of the House Republican
Conference, told the Washington Post after the experts' findings were
disclosed. Echoing the sentiments of other influential Republicans,
he added, "The theory that there has been a conscious effort to
conceal evidence is no longer a theory."</TE>
<TE>   Nixon left office seven months later.</TE>
<TE>   Bolt, the son of an American medical missionary, was born in
Beijing. He attended UC Berkeley, earning a bachelor's degree in
architecture in 1933 and a master's degree in physics in 1937. After
doctoral work in acoustics at UCLA, he earned a doctorate from
Berkeley in 1939. He joined MIT as a physics fellow, later rising to
professor of acoustics. During World War II, he helped the Navy
develop methods for using sound to detect submarines.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, he returned to MIT and headed its acoustics lab.
When the United Nations approached him to design the acoustics for
the General Assembly Hall, he realized he needed help and recruited
MIT colleague Leo Beranek. Later, former student Robert Newman joined
them, forming the partnership that became BBN.</TE>
<TE>   Described as a charming and irrepressibly enthusiastic man, Bolt
"was not particularly interested in business administration, and
preferred to take part in national activities," Beranek said. His
posts included principal consultant to the National Institutes of
Health and associate director of the National Science Foundation. He
also was a fellow of the Center for the Advanced Study of Behavioral
Sciences at Stanford University.</TE>
<TE>   Bolt retired after 23 years as chairman of BBN Corp. in 1976, just
as the company was making a name for itself as a pioneer of the cyber
age. BBN scientists are credited with helping build the ARPANET, the
precursor of the Internet, sending the first e-mail and sparking the
use of the @ symbol in e-mail addresses. Now called BBN Technologies,
the company was sold in 1997 and is a division of Verizon.</TE>
<TE>   After Bolt put the firm in the national spotlight with his
participation in the Watergate case, BBN was hired to analyze a sound
recording of the gunshots fired on John F. Kennedy's motorcade in
Dallas in 1963.</TE>
<TE>   The company concluded that a fourth shot may have been fired from
the so-called grassy knoll of Dealey Plaza, which supported theories
that a second gunman was involved.</TE>
<TE>   Bolt is survived by two daughters, a son, seven grandchildren and
eight great-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Daniel De Luce, 90; '44 Pulitzer Winner</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Daniel De Luce, who as a World War II correspondent for Associated
Press won a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on the strength of
partisan resistance to the Nazis in Yugoslavia, has died. He was 90.</LD>
<LD>   De Luce died Tuesday at Palomar Medical Center in Escondido of
complications from a fall at his home in San Diego, said his brother,
Richard, of Palos Verdes Estates.</LD>
<LD>   A native of Yuma, Ariz., De Luce had lived in the Rancho Bernardo
area of San Diego with his wife, Alma, since 1980.</LD>
<TE>   De Luce, whose coverage of World War II took him to North Africa,
South Asia and throughout Europe, began his career as an office boy
in AP's San Francisco bureau in 1929.</TE>
<TE>   He later transferred to the Los Angeles bureau, where he worked
until 1934, when he received a bachelor's degree in economics from
UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   De Luce spent a year reporting for the now-defunct Los Angeles
Examiner before rejoining Associated Press as a reporter.</TE>
<TE>   In the spring of 1939, AP sent him to Budapest, Hungary, where he
began reporting on the conflicts that led to World War II. Later that
year, he covered Germany's invasion of Poland.</TE>
<TE>   While covering the Italian and German invasion of Greece, he and
Alma, a photographer, had to flee with other correspondents in a
fishing boat to Turkey.</TE>
<TE>   His coverage included the British retreat from Burma, the American
campaigns in North Africa and Italy, and the war crime trials at
Nuremberg.</TE>
<TE>   In 1943, he ignored the warning of a British naval captain and
traveled to war-torn Yugoslavia to get a firsthand look at partisans
led by Marshal Josip Broz Tito, who went on to become the country's
Communist leader.</TE>
<TE>   De Luce's four-part series gave readers the most extensive account
to date on underground forces in the region and won the 1944 Pulitzer
Prize for international reporting.</TE>
<TE>   Years later, De Luce said that winning the Pulitzer Prize meant he
could stop trying to prove himself.</TE>
<TE>   ''I could relax,'' he told an interviewer. ''It's like some guy
getting into a movie and it's a big, big success. Well, you know, he
doesn't have to be a star anymore.''</TE>
<TE>   After the war, De Luce reported from Jordan on the Arab-Israeli
war of 1947-48.</TE>
<TE>   He then returned to Europe to serve as AP bureau chief in
Frankfurt, Germany.</TE>
<TE>   De Luce returned to the United States in 1956 to work at AP
headquarters in New York. He retired from the news cooperative as a
deputy general manager in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   His survivors include his wife, brother and a sister.</TE>

<HD>Dick 'Night Train' Lane, 73; Set Record as Rookie on L.A.
Rams</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dick "Night Train" Lane, a pro football Hall of Fame defensive back
who had a record-setting rookie season for the Los Angeles Rams in
1952, has died. He was 73.</LD>
<LD>   Lane died of a heart attack Tuesday night at an assisted living
facility in Austin, Texas. He suffered from diabetes and chronic knee
problems and had moved into the assisted living facility two years
ago.</LD>
<LD>   Lane was a Pro Bowl selection in six of his 14 NFL seasons with
the Rams, Chicago Cardinals and Detroit Lions. His 68 career
interceptions is third on the NFL's all-time list and his 1,207
return yards is second best.</LD>
<TE>   He made 14 interceptions in 1952, his rookie season, which is
still a record. And he did it in only 12 games--the NFL regular
season has been 16 games since 1978.</TE>
<TE>   "He was far and away the greatest pass interceptor of all time,"
said Bob Oates, who has covered pro football for newspapers in Los
Angeles for more than 60 years.</TE>
<TE>   "When I think of him, I think of how far in the air he used to get
to make his interceptions. I've never seen a defensive back who could
jump as high as Night Train. He could play today and be an All-Pro."</TE>
<TE>   Lane got his nickname in his first training camp with the Rams
because of his affinity for the Buddy Morrow song "Night Train."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Fears, the Rams' great receiver, was the only player in camp
who had a copy of Morrow's record, and Lane made regular visits to
Fears' room to hear it on the phonograph--and talk football.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, he didn't like the name. "I'd been called all sorts of
names by that time, and I wasn't sure what they meant by that
nickname," Lane told the Austin American-Statesman last year.</TE>
<TE>   Gradually, he warmed to it. In 1954, after he was traded to the
Chicago Cardinals, he was thrilled when, after a good game in a
victory over the Washington Redskins and running back Charlie "Choo
Choo" Justice, a Chicago newspaper headline read: "Night Train
Derails Choo Choo."</TE>
<TE>   A member of the NFL's All-Time Team for its first 75 years, Lane
stood 6 feet 3 inches and weighed 185 pounds. He was bigger and
faster than most receivers and, early in his career, he tackled
opponents by wrapping his arms around their neck and taking them to
the ground.</TE>
<TE>   The move--dubbed the "Night Train Necktie"--was eventually banned
by the league as too dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Murray, the late Times columnist, once said of Lane: "He
played the game with a ferocity that's seldom been equaled.
Quarterbacks avoided Night Train's part of the field as a hunter
would avoid a rattlesnake nest. There were games in which Night Train
had more receptions than the receivers he was covering."</TE>
<TE>   Lane was inducted into the Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, in 1974.
He was the second defensive back and seventh African American
inducted.</TE>
<TE>   "I played with him and against him, and he was the best I've ever
seen," former New York Giants kicker Pat Summerall, now a broadcaster
for Fox, once said.</TE>
<TE>   Lane's Hall of Fame biography describes him as a "gambler on the
field who made spectacular plays." But Lane once said he took only
calculated chances. "I never gamble on the ball, just the angles I
take on receivers," he told The Times in 1962. "And I study the
receivers to perfect the angles."</TE>
<TE>   The son of a prostitute and pimp, Lane was raised in Austin by a
Ella Lane, a widow with two children who found him abandoned in a
Dumpster when he was 3 months old.</TE>
<TE>   Lane was a three-sport athlete at Anderson High. The school was
part of the Prairie View Interscholastic League, which was made up of
black schools throughout Texas. Lane led the football team to a state

<LD>Leonard Victor Martin, 81, who purchased the abandoned Del Monte
cannery in San Francisco in 1963 and turned it into the successful
shopping and dining attraction known as the Cannery, died earlier
this month at his home in Ross, Calif., after a long illness.</LD>
<LD>   Martin's purchase of the ramshackle cannery near Fisherman's
Wharf, along with nearby Ghirardelli Square, helped launch a national
movement to renovate older commercial buildings.</LD>
<LD>   Martin, whose given name was Leonid Matveyeff, was born in
Manchuria to Russian parents who had fled Siberia. He immigrated to
San Francisco in 1940 and, after earning a law degree at UCLA, opened
a law practice in San Francisco.</LD>
<TE>   Newspaper columnist Herb Caen once lauded Martin as one of "those
San Francisco individuals who are Slightly Mad in the nicest possible
way."</TE>
<TE>   The Cannery is still family-owned; Martin's son, Christopher, is
managing partner.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Van L. Swearingen, the owner of the Iverson Location Movie Ranch in
Chatsworth, died of cancer Tuesday at a hospital in Woodland Hills.
He was 62.</LD>
<LD>   Swearingen and his wife, Phyliss Murphy, bought a six-acre portion
of the 2,000-acre movie ranch in 1997, keeping the location available
for film and television production. The once-sprawling ranch served
as a backdrop for such film classics as ''The Grapes of Wrath'' and
''The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.''</LD>
<LD>   An avid automobile enthusiast who at one time raced cars at the
Saugus Speedway, Swearingen was restoring the Iverson ranch house and
building a 3,200-square-foot garage to keep his collection of more
than 80 cars, about half of them 1957 Chevys, Murphy said.</LD>
<TE>   Swearingen became involved in Nascar racing at 15, Murphy said,
and was well-known in racing circles for helping to launch the
careers of young drivers.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years,  Swearingen had hosted the Wild, Wild West Days
festival at the ranch to benefit the Happy Trails Children's
Foundation, a nonprofit organization founded by the late Roy Rogers
and Dale Evans to help abused youth.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Summerfield, Fla., Swearingen was a resident of the San
Fernando Valley for more than 30 years. In addition to his wife,
survivors include a daughter, Sharon Swearingen Sabo of Bellview,
Ill.; a stepson, Michael Murphy of North Hills; and three
grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Services are scheduled for 1 p.m. Feb. 9 at the Iverson Ranch.</TE>
<TE>   In lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations be made to the
Happy Trails Children's Foundation, 10755 Apple Valley Road, Apple
Valley,  CA 92308.</TE>

<HD>IRS Supports a Deadline Extension for E-Filers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service said
Wednesday that they would support legislation to extend tax deadlines
for consumers who agree to file their returns electronically.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush intends to include this proposal, as well as one to
make electronic tax filing free to everyone, as part of his upcoming
budget, Treasury officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The new electronic-filing initiatives would give participating
taxpayers 10 extra days to file and pay their federal income tax
bills, which are usually due April 15.</LD>
<TE>   However, the changes won't come in time for this year's tax
season, Treasury spokeswoman Tara Bradshaw said.</TE>
<TE>   That's mainly because the proposals require congressional approval
and no supporting legislation has been proposed.</TE>
<TE>   The proposals are part of an effort to meet the goal set by
Congress in 1998 that 80% of all taxpayers--corporate and
individual--file and pay their taxes electronically by 2007.</TE>
<TE>   That goal was set partly because it's cheaper and less
time-consuming for the government to process electronically filed
returns, which are less prone to error.</TE>
<TE>   However, an IRS task force on electronic initiatives told Congress
last year that it isn't offering sufficient incentives for taxpayers
and tax practitioners to flock to electronic filing.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS projects that 34% of individual taxpayers will file
electronically this year--up from 30.7% in 2001--and 43% will e-file
by 2003. That's well short of what is needed to meet Congress' goal.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury officials said there are several reasons taxpayers are
sometimes reluctant to e-file. Paper returns can be filed for the
cost of postage. But taxpayers usually must go through a third party
to file electronically, which can add a $10 to $12 fee for routing
the e-filing to the IRS. And some taxpayers are hesitant to send tax
information through a third party.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS believes allowing taxpayers to file late and for free when
they file electronically might be just the inducement many need.</TE>
<TE>   House and Senate staffers said it's too early to say whether
lawmakers would sponsor an e-filing bill.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), ranking minority member on the
Senate Finance Committee, supports e-filing, a committee spokeswoman
said. However, he needs to know what the Treasury's proposal might
cost and how it would work before he could support or oppose it, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Treasury Department didn't provide cost estimates or a
proposal for setting up the program. It probably would involve
working with the private sector, officials said.</TE>

<HD>AOL Time Warner Says Quarterly Loss Widens</HD>
<DH>Media: A downturn in advertising hurts results. But the
company sees rise in cash flow.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AOL Time Warner Inc., in its first profit report since vowing earlier
this month to give frustrated investors more realistic financial
projections, said Wednesday that its fourth-quarter loss widened to
$1.8 billion from $1.09billion a year earlier partly because of the
severe advertising slowdown.</LD>
<LD>   The entertainment giant's results were in line with revised,
tempered forecasts it provided Wall Street on Jan. 7. Even still, the
company's stock on Wednesday dropped 30 cents to $26.40 a share,
after trading as low as $24--a 52-week low--on the New York Stock
Exchange. AOL Time Warner's stock is at less than half the high of
$58.51 it reached last spring and has slid 43% since the merger of
AOL and Time Warner a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   The advertising downturn hurt AOL Time Warner across many of its
holdings, including the WB television network, CNN, the America
Online Internet service and magazines.</LD>
<TE>   But the company's cash flow--earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization--rose 14% in the quarter to $2.76
billion on a 4% increase in revenue to $10.6 billion. Cash flow is
used by many Wall Street analysts as a measurement of financial
health for media companies because they often have high debt loads
and large amortization costs stemming from acquisitions.</TE>
<TE>   Bright spots included a stellar performance by AOL Time Warner's
film units, where cash flow soared 90% to $347 million. During the
quarter, the company's Warner Bros. unit released the hits "Harry
Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," which has pulled in $890million
worldwide in box-office receipts, and "Ocean's 11," while its New
Line Cinema division in December released the box-office smash "The
Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," which already has
topped more than $600 million in ticket sales.</TE>
<TE>   The fall in the company's stock, however, reflects not only the
weak economy and sagging advertising market, but continued investor
skepticism with AOL Time Warner forecasts. Chief Executive Gerald
Levin, who is taking early retirement in May, was especially
criticized for promising double-digit growth and numerous synergies
from the union of Internet giant AOL and entertainment giant Time
Warner Inc. Designated Chief Executive Richard Parsons has promised
to reverse that, providing investors more realistic guidance.</TE>
<TE>   "They are going to try to under-promise and over-deliver. They'll
focus on methodical ways of steadily building up the company rather
than putting targets up in the air that are difficult to achieve,"
said UBS Warburg media analyst Christopher Dixon.</TE>
<TE>   In a marathon two-hour conference call with analysts, top company
officials--Levin, Parsons, Chief Operating Officer Robert Pittman and
Chief Financial Officer Wayne Pace--were clearly restrained in
reporting the quarterly results and in making projections for the
year. Setting a tone for the session, Parsons said: "The good news is
there are no surprises."</TE>
<TE>   The executives said revenue and cash flow should be flat in the
first quarter assuming the economy remains soft. They said revenue
should rise a sluggish 5% to 8% in 2002, with cash flow rising from
8% to 12%.</TE>
<TE>   Although the merger is now 1 year old and was announced two years
ago this month, company officials are still working overtime selling
it. A telling sign came during the conference call when executives
spent most of the time reiterating why they believe the merger will
work, talking about promotional opportunities such as marketing
movies such as "Harry Potter" to AOL users and discussing the promise
high-speed broadband Internet connections portends for the
distribution of entertainment and information.</TE>
<TE>   The executives reiterated that the company plans a huge
$40-billion to $60-billion noncash charge in the first quarter to
comply with accounting rule changes for goodwill. Goodwill is an
intangible asset that reflects the premium paid when AOL acquired
Time Warner. Under the new rules the company must take a write-down
since the high-priced stock it used in the deal has since plunged in
value.</TE>
<TE>   The company also eased Wall Street concerns by showing healthy
growth in subscriptions for its various Internet, cable, network and
publishing businesses. The company said it had two special charges:
$45 million for costs related to the merger and $1.7 billion in
write-offs because of a drop in the value of their investments in
Time Warner Telecom and Hughes Electronics.</TE>
<TE>   In reports after the results were announced, analysts repeatedly
stressed that the results were in line with the company's new
conservative forecasts, with some expressing surprise that the stock
closed down.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon said he suspects that because of its complex financial
structure, AOL Time Warner's stock is caught in the downdraft of
investor queasiness about potential accounting abuses growing out of
the Enron scandal.</TE>

<HD>Enron Fallout Claims BofA Execs</HD>
<DH>Banking: Company says its potential losses from energy
trader's collapse could total $500 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bank of America Corp., which recorded $231 million in Enron
Corp.-related losses for the fourth quarter, has fired three veteran
employees in Texas who managed loans to Enron. And the head of its
group in New York that financed energy companies has resigned, the
bank said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   They are the first bank executives to be ousted in connection with
Enron's collapse.</LD>
<LD>   Thousands of employees of Enron, a Houston energy trading company
that filed for bankruptcy last month, have lost their jobs and, for
many whose 401(k) accounts were invested in Enron stock, their
retirement savings as well.</LD>
<TE>   Charlotte, N.C.-based Bank of America, the nation's third-largest
bank, said Wednesday that three managers left the firm last week:
21-year employee Jo Tamalis, a client manager for the bank's natural
resources group in Houston; 25-year veteran Marcia Bateman, a loan
portfolio manager in Dallas; and 14-year employee James Allred, a
loan portfolio manager in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Bank of America spokesman Jeff Hershberger declined to discuss the
circumstances of the workers' departure, but one of the three
workers, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said they were
forced out because their duties had included the Enron account.</TE>
<TE>   The other workers didn't return telephone calls.</TE>
<TE>   The bank also said Steve Bragg, a New York investment banker who
headed the natural resources group at Banc of America Securities,
"has decided to resign from the company to pursue other
opportunities."</TE>
<TE>   The bank said Bragg will stay on for a few weeks while a "new
leadership structure" is worked out for his group, which provided
loans, securities underwriting and other services to energy firms.</TE>
<TE>   Bragg didn't return telephone calls Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the $231-million charge recorded against its
quarterly earnings, Bank of America had an additional $272 million in
potential Enron losses as of Dec.31, spokeswoman Eloise Hale said,
bringing its total exposure to more than $500 million.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, its fourth-quarter profit rose by 49% to $2.06
billion, beating estimates, as falling interest rates spurred
lending.</TE>
<TE>   Bank stocks rose Wednesday after taking a drubbing Tuesday after
PNC Financial Services Group restated its earnings amid regulatory
scrutiny over its accounting.</TE>
<TE>   Bank of America's stock rose by $2.46 Wednesday to close at $61.66
on the New York Stock Exchange, compared with $60.80 before its
earnings were announced Jan. 22.</TE>
<TE>   Though Bank of America's Enron losses were large, other banks were
more gravely wounded when Enron filed the largest-ever Chapter 11
bankruptcy petition.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest loser, J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., has more than $2
billion in potential exposure to Enron losses after taking $450
million in fourth-quarter charges related to Enron.</TE>
<TE>   J.P. Morgan, which unlike Bank of America was one of Enron's lead
lenders, reported a $332-million fourth-quarter loss, contrasted with
a $708-million profit a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for J.P. Morgan, the second-largest U.S. bank, said
the firm has had no Enron-related job losses.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's largest banking company, Citigroup Inc., had teamed
up with J.P. Morgan to arrange $3 billion in bank loans for Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup wrote off $228 million before taxes in the fourth
quarter as a result of losses on Enron loans and securities holdings.</TE>

<HD>Huge Payoff at No Risk: SEC Giving Scam Lesson</HD>
<DH>Fraud: Regulator is using bogus investment Web sites to
lure and educate those looking for unbelievable deals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission is using bogus investment Web
sites in an effort to slap a little sense into the terminally
gullible, the securities watchdog agency said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC last week created www.mcwhortle.com, a Web address for
bogus company McWhortle Enterprises Inc. that supposedly makes
battery-powered biohazard detection devices.</LD>
<LD>   The site, replete with testimonials and audio feeds, promises that
investments in McWhortle will be worth 400 times the initial offering
price within three months.</LD>
<TE>   But when investors hit the button to buy, up pops a page
proclaiming: "If you responded to an investment idea like this, you
could get scammed!"</TE>
<TE>   The site received more than 150,000 hits late last week after a
news release seemingly issued by McWhortle that was distributed to
hundreds of Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   McWhortle is one in a series of similar Web sites that the SEC is
sponsoring as part of its investor education effort.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC is borrowing a tactic that the Federal Trade Commission
has used for several years. The FTC hosts several bogus business
opportunity sites, which admonish those who click through several
pages of over-optimistic claims that they're ripe targets for con
artists with offers that are too good to be true.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a low-cost, high-impact way to reach the people that we
need to reach in the way that they want to be reached--over the
Internet," said Susan Wyderko, director of the SEC's Office of
Investor Education and Assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Internet-based scams have become a growing problem in recent
years. Although auction frauds are by far the most common complaint,
Nigerian money scams, investment and business-opportunity frauds are
becoming increasingly prevalent.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Mission Viejo teenager Cole A. Bartiromo was
accused by the SEC of using the Internet to swindle more than $1
million from investors.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC won't reveal the names and locations of its other
"investment" sites, but says several already have been launched in
partnership with the FTC, the North American Securities
Administrators Assn. and other law enforcement agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Although regulators have no data indicating how successful these
sites are in deterring investors from being taken by scams, agency
officials say consumers responding by e-mail have been highly
positive.</TE>
<TE>   The McWhortle page includes links to sites run by the SEC and FTC,
the securities administrators group and the National Assn. of
Securities Dealers. It also urges consumers to check out company
financial data on the SEC's Edgar site and includes a link to sites
where investors can verify if a company is registered with the SEC or
state securities regulators.</TE>
<TE>   The site also warns investors that requests for Social Security
and credit card numbers--as the McWhortle site does--are the
hallmarks of identity fraud, the fastest-growing financial crime.</TE>

<HD>Global Crossing Became a Top Contributor Fast</HD>
<DH>Politics: The telecom firm gave to both parties as it
focused on its undersea cable.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr. and P.J. HUFFSTUTTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Financially troubled Global Crossing Ltd. catapulted from nowhere
four years ago to become one of Washington's biggest political
givers, although its lobbying focus was far narrower than most other
corporate giants.</LD>
<LD>   Barely a player in 1998, Global Crossing grew to No. 23 on the
list of top donors to federal parties and candidates in the 1999-2000
election cycle, according to a study released Wednesday by the Center
for Responsive Politics, a Washington watchdog group.</LD>
<LD>   The telecommunications company gave more than $2.8 million in soft
money, political action committee money and individual
contributions--84 times what it gave during the 1997-98 election
cycle.</LD>
<TE>   "They just came out of nowhere and ... began flashing a lot of
money all over town," said Holly Bailey, a researcher for the center.</TE>
<TE>   The top recipient was Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the ranking
member of the Senate Commerce Committee, which oversees the telecom
industry. McCain received $31,000 in 1999, according to the study. He
was followed by Sen. Conrad R. Burns (R-Mont.), another member of the
Commerce Committee who received $30,750.</TE>
<TE>   As prolific fund-raisers and veterans of Washington's political
scene, Global Crossing co-chairmen, Gary Winnick and Lodwrick Cook,
tapped into their political network when the company was still
privately held.</TE>
<TE>   Former President George Bush made a speech on behalf of Global
Crossing in 1998, and accepted an estimated 230,000 shares instead of
an $80,000 speaking fee. At the company's stock peak, the shares were
worth $14 million.</TE>
<TE>   Terry McAuliffe, now the chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, was an early investor in the company, netting a windfall
of just under $18 million when he sold most of his shares in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Though a wide spectrum of politicians were beneficiaries, Global
Crossing cited less than a dozen legislative issues of interest on
its federal lobbying disclosure forms.</TE>
<TE>   "It was kind of unusual in that you would expect a company
spending like that to have a long laundry list of things they wanted"
to influence, Bailey said.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing spokeswoman Becky Yeaman, declined to directly
address why Global Crossing's political donations skyrocketed. She
noted the Bermuda-based company, which has its corporate offices in
Beverly Hills, was started in 1997 and said: "The senior executives
... share a strong commitment to being a good corporate citizen and
part of that is participating in the political process."</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, Global Crossing doled out $724,000, placing it No. 29
among the biggest political donors.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing has had an almost singular policy focus:
protecting its massive investment in a 13,000-mile undersea optical
cable linking the U.S. and Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing boasted in 1999 it was the first to take the huge
financial risk of building a privately owned and operated cable
system across the Pacific Ocean.</TE>
<TE>   That same year, however, rivals AT&amp;T Corp., WorldCom Inc. and
Sprint Communications Co. announced they would jointly build an
undersea cable that would compete with Global Crossing's link.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with the challenge from three of the world's largest
telecommunications firms, Global Crossing filed an antitrust
complaint with the U.S. Justice Department and asked the Federal
Communications Commission to block the three long-distance carriers
from building the undersea link.</TE>
<TE>   It also signed up Anne Bingaman, a former assistant attorney
general at the Justice Department, as their chief lobbyist on the
issue. Between January and June 1999, Global Crossing paid Bingaman
$2.5 million, according to the company's lobbying records. At the
same time, Global Crossing solicited letters of support from several
lawmakers, including McCain.</TE>
<TE>   However, the undersea project of Sprint and its partners was
completed after the FCC gave its approval and the Justice Department
closed its antitrust inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, Global Crossing also has used its lobbying
muscle to protect its huge investment in NextWave Telecom Inc., a
bankrupt wireless telecommunications company, whose principal
asset--cellular phone licenses--were seized by the FCC and resold in
a government auction to rival carriers last year for $16 billion.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Global Crossing was among a group of four key investors
that pledged a $1.6-billion investment in NextWave.</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge ruled that the FCC's license seizure was illegal,
and in the fall NextWave and the FCC entered a controversial deal.
NextWave was to be paid $6 billion in cash if it gave back its
licenses. Congress had to sign off on the settlement before the end
of 2001, but Congress adjourned in December without endorsing the
accord.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Global Crossing's contributions, McCain opposed the deal
as a bad deal for taxpayers. The dispute is now before the Supreme
Court, where a final resolution, and any investment gain for Global
Crossing, remains months, if not years away.</TE>

<HD>Profit Rises 7.6% for Philip Morris</HD>
<DH>Earnings: Tobacco giant names new leader. Results for
fourth quarter meet analyst expectations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Philip Morris Cos., the largest tobacco company, on Wednesday named
Chief Financial Officer Louis Camilleri as its leader and reported a
7.6% increase in fourth-quarter profit that matched Wall Street
expectations.</LD>
<LD>   Camilleri, 47, will succeed Geoffrey Bible as chief executive and
president effective April 25 after the annual shareholders meeting,
Philip Morris said.</LD>
<LD>   Bible, will remain chairman until August, when he reaches the
company's mandatory retirement age of 65. At that time, Camilleri
will take on the chairman position as well.</LD>
<TE>   Philip Morris, whose products include Miller beer and Kraft foods
as well as Marlboro and other cigarette brands, said earnings in the
fourth quarter rose to $2.16billion, or 99 cents a share, from $2.01
billion, or 90 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose 13% to $22 billion,
helped by an increase in cigarette prices.</TE>
<TE>   Camilleri will take the reins at Philip Morris after profit rose
every year but one since Bible became CEO in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been involved in all the company's high-level decisions,"
said Thomas Russo, a partner at Gardner Russo &amp; Gardner, which had
1.82 million Philip Morris shares as of September. "He understands
all aspects of the company."</TE>
<TE>   During Bible's tenure, Philip Morris shed less profitable
businesses such as Log Cabin Syrup to focus on boosting profit and
sales at the tobacco and Miller units. The company also shed many
lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   The company is being challenged by low-priced private-label
cigarette brands for new customers in the United States, its largest
market, and internationally, investors said.</TE>
<TE>   Camilleri must figure out a way to boost flagging cigarette sales
overseas and fend off lawsuits still pending against the company,
analysts and investors said.</TE>
<TE>   "The reaction [to Camilleri] is that there's not going to be any
change," said Keith Patriquin, an analyst at Loomis Sayles &amp; Co.,
which owned 1.42 million Philip Morris shares as of September. "I'm
just happy somebody new isn't coming in."</TE>
<TE>   Camilleri, who analysts said beat out Philip Morris USA CEO
Michael Szymanczyk for Bible's job, will review senior management
positions and address employees today, company spokesman Steven
Parrish said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no timeline" for when other appointments may be
announced, Camilleri said during a conference call with investors and
analysts. "I expect something to be done before April 25."</TE>
<TE>   Camilleri, a smoker of Marlboro Ultra Lights, helped oversee
Philip Morris' $18.9-billion purchase of Nabisco Holdings Corp. in
December 2000, the company's biggest acquisition.</TE>
<TE>   Before becoming CFO in 1996, he worked at the company's Kraft food
and European units.</TE>
<TE>   Camilleri's experience in dealing with legislators will help as he
tackles the company's legal problems, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   More than three years after the industry negotiated a landmark
$206-billion settlement of health-related claims with 46 states,
Philip Morris has hundreds of lawsuits to fight and is under
increased scrutiny from countries outside the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of New York-based Philip Morris fell 22 cents to $49.57 on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Other earnings, excluding one-time items except as noted, include:</TE>
<TE>   * AT&amp;T Corp. reported fourth-quarter operating profit of
$211million, or 5 cents a share, a penny better than analysts'
estimates, but said revenue fell 9.5% as it lost long-distance
customers to rivals and phone use declined.</TE>
<TE>   The telecommunications giant said that with one-time items,
including a $1-billion write-down in the latest quarter related to
job cuts, it had a loss of $1.39 billion, or 39 cents a share,
compared with a year-ago loss of $1.64 billion, or 45 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Total revenue fell to $12.59 billion, with consumer long-distance
revenue down 18.3%. Revenue in the cable TV operations rose 10.2% to
$2.38 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The company expects consumer long-distance revenue to decline in
the mid-20% range this year, better than its earlier estimate of a
drop of up to 30%. It also said cable revenue should grow in the low
to mid-teens in 2002, helping offset the decline in phone sales.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of New York-based AT&amp;T fell 36 cents to close at $17.45 on
the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   * Electronic Arts Inc. reported profit and revenue growth that
handily beat analyst expectations for its fiscal third quarter,
helped by sales of "Harry Potter" titles and other new video games.
Earnings excluding one-time items climbed 61% to $147.1 million, or
$1.03 a share, on a 30% jump in sales to $832.9 million. Analysts
were expecting earnings of 89 cents a share on sales of $735million.</TE>
<TE>   * New York Times Co.'s profit fell 31% in the fourth quarter to
$76.9 million, or 50 cents a share, matching analysts' forecasts,
amid a slump in advertising. Sales fell 16% to $780.6 million,
missing analysts' expectations of $805.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Reebok International Ltd.'s profit fell 16% to $5.17 million, or
9cents a share, but beat analysts' expectations of 5 cents. Sales
rose 6.8% to $664.6 million as higher clothing sales offset declines
in shoe sales.</TE>
<TE>   * Tommy Hilfiger Corp.'s fiscal third-quarter profit declined 13%
to $37 million, or 41 cents a share, as sales fell less than 1% to
$474.8million.</TE>

<HD>Stock Fund Inflows Plunge 90% in 2001</HD>
<DH>Investing: Falloff, which appears to continue, raises
questions about market's prospects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Americans' love affair with stock mutual funds continues to cool, new
data show: The funds last year took in the smallest amount of net new
cash since 1990, and inflows for January, traditionally a strong
month, appear to be weak.</LD>
<LD>   The sharp falloff in fund investing raises questions about the
stock market's prospects for this year. Though mutual funds control
only about one-fifth of total stock assets, the record cash inflows
the funds enjoyed in the late 1990s helped propel the bull market.</LD>
<LD>   Those inflows dwindled dramatically last year amid Wall Street's
worst decline since the mid-1970s. Stock funds took in a net $32.3
billion in 2001, a 90% drop from the record $309-billion inflow in
2000, according to data released Wednesday by the Investment Company
Institute, the fund industry's chief trade group.</LD>
<TE>   In December, stock funds had a net inflow of $3 billion, down from
$15.3 billion in November.</TE>
<TE>   Net new cash flow is gross fund purchases minus redemptions.</TE>
<TE>   After two straight years of losses in the stock market, many
investors continue to shift assets to more stable and conservative
accounts such as bond funds and money market funds, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Ultra-safe but low-yielding money market funds saw a record inflow
of $375 billion in 2001, fueled by institutional investors, ICI data
show. Bond funds took in a net $87.4 billion--their best annual total
since 1986 and their first positive year since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the deep bear market on Wall Street, more stocks rose than
fell on the New York Stock Exchange and on Nasdaq in calendar 2001,
thanks to the fourth-quarter rally. Yet 83% of stock mutual funds
lost money, according to data firm Weiss Ratings Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "These results confirm that even professional [stock] mutual fund
managers can't protect investors from losses in a broad market
decline," said Martin Weiss, chairman of Palm Beach Gardens,
Fla.-based Weiss Ratings. The average U.S. stock fund sank 11% last
year, according to fund tracker Morningstar Inc.</TE>
<TE>   But, some analysts, such as fund industry consultant Avi Nachmany
of New York-based Strategic Insight, say still-positive cash
flows--in the face of dismal returns--show investors have
considerable faith in stock funds as a long-term investment.</TE>
<TE>   While gross stock fund purchases fell 28% in 2001 from 2000,
redemptions also declined, off 14%. Overall, the numbers suggest that
many investors continued to make automatic stock fund investments
through retirement plans such as 401(k)s, while holding off on
discretionary fund purchases.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a typical shareholder reaction to a bear market," said ICI
spokesman Chris Wloszczyna. "Many people do nothing."</TE>
<TE>   But some investors say they've had it with stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Lance Dore, 41, an analyst for a San Diego real estate company,
said he stopped buying stocks and stock funds for his individual
retirement account and other accounts about a year and a half ago,
shortly after the bull market began crumbling.</TE>
<TE>   "I just said, 'I don't need this grief,'" Dore said. "I stopped
cold turkey." He and a partner began investing in apartment complexes
instead.</TE>
<TE>   After the strong fourth-quarter market rally, some fund managers
may have been hoping for a jump in cash inflows in January. Fueled by
year-end bonus money, January is typically a big month for stock fund
purchases: From 1998 through 2001, for example, January inflows
averaged $25 billion.</TE>
<TE>   This year, increased federal limits for annual IRA and 401(k)
retirement plan contributions were expected to boost fund inflows in
January.</TE>
<TE>   But the market is off to a poor start this year, putting a damper
on fund cash flows.</TE>
<TE>   TrimTabs.com Investment Research of Santa Rosa, Calif., projects a
$1.6-billion net outflow from stock funds this month, and another
data tracker, AMG Data Services of Arcata, Calif., expects a modest
inflow.</TE>
<TE>   Bond funds and money market funds, meanwhile, are expected to have
inflows again.</TE>
<TE>   Some major fund companies say their customers continue to buy
stock funds. Fidelity Investments and Strong Funds are reporting
inflows this month, while Vanguard Group said it is having one of its
strongest sales months ever.</TE>
<TE>   Still, after growing at a 20% annual clip through the 1990s, the
fund business has "reached a meaningful plateau," said Geoff Bobroff,
an independent consultant to the industry based in East Greenwich,
R.I.</TE>
<TE>   ICI data show that 52% of U.S. households owned mutual funds in
2001, including stock funds in most cases. In 1990, only one in four
held funds. From here, further penetration is "likely to prove costly
and difficult," Bobroff said.</TE>
<TE>   Whether that will mean less fodder for a new stock market rally
isn't clear, however. Automatic retirement plan purchases provide a
continuous stream of new money to funds: Even after a two-year market
downturn, about 80% of 401(k) contributions still are being directed
to stocks, according to a survey by Chicago-based benefits consultant
Hewitt Associates.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, because investors typically "chase" performance, if a
strong new bull market takes hold on Wall Street, stock funds are
likely to enjoy a new cash windfall, some say.</TE>
<TE>   Bobroff said fund inflows may surge again this decade as aging
baby boomers increasingly focus on retirement saving and if a
brighter economy allows more people to take advantage of higher IRA
and 401(k) limits.</TE>

<HD>State Farm Subsidiary's Rating Cut</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Liz Pulliam Weston</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A leading rating agency downgraded State Farm's California operations
this week because of significant losses in the insurer's homeowner
business.</LD>
<LD>   A.M. Best cut its financial strength rating on State Farm General
Insurance Co., a subsidiary of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance
Co., from A-minus, or "excellent," to B-plus, or "very good." The
action follows last week's announcement by rival rating agency
Standard &amp; Poor's that it had put California's largest insurer on a
credit watch after losses eroded reserves to $390 million from
$566million a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   A.M. Best attributed the losses to rising construction costs and
State Farm's strategy of trying to win market share with
lower-than-average rates.</LD>
<TE>   State Farm's finances will not be directly affected by the
downgrade, but the move is considered a blow to the company's
reputation.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts have said the rating actions make it more likely that
State Farm will ask for rate increases beyond the two 6.9% hikes it
already has requested, and that other insurers may follow suit.</TE>
<TE>   Homeowners' insurance premiums have risen significantly in the
state. In the last two years, Farmers Insurance Group, the state's
second-largest insurer, has asked for five rate increases ranging
from 5% to 6.9%, while Allstate Corp. has applied for a 22.3% hike.</TE>

<HD>Rebounding LAX Sees Its Bonds Taken Off Moody's Watch List</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James F. Peltz</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Moody's Investors Service said Wednesday that it removed Los Angeles
International Airport bonds from the credit agency's "watch list" for
a possible downgrade, making LAX one of the first major international
airports to earn that distinction since Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   After the attacks, the bond-rating agency had placed LAX's
$234million of general revenue bonds on its watch list, portending a
possible downgrade in the bonds' credit rating. The bonds currently
carry an investment-grade rating.</LD>
<LD>   But in removing LAX's bonds from the list, Moody's noted the
airport's "prompt management cost reductions," and that passenger
traffic had increased steadily during the last four months of 2001.
Also, "LAX's debt load is quite modest when compared with other large
airports," Moody's said.</LD>
<TE>   The agency also said it initially was concerned about the
potentially negative effects of the stringent security measures
affecting LAX's revenue in the aftermath of the attacks, including
the closure of the airport's central parking area. But the area has
since reopened, Moody's said.</TE>

<HD>Wall St. Embraces Fed Notice</HD>
<DH>Markets: The Dow is spurred to a 144-point gain in heavy
trading after the central bank says it sees more signs of economic
recovery. Bond yields edge higher.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The stock market liked what it heard from the Federal Reserve on
Wednesday: The central bank's midday announcement that "the outlook
for economic recovery has become promising" helped send stocks into
positive territory after morning losses.</LD>
<LD>   Trading was heavy as buyers poured into the market in the
afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   By the market's close, key indexes had recouped 40% to 55% of
Tuesday's sharp decline, when worries about new accounting
controversies drove the blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index to its
worst loss since Sept. 20.</LD>
<TE>   The S&amp;P rose 12.93 points, or 1.2%, to 1,113.57 Wednesday, after
diving 2.9% Tuesday. The Dow industrials rose 144.62 points, or 1.5%,
to 9,762.86, after losing 247.51 points Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite index gained 20.45 points, or 1.1%, to
1,913.44.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow had been down 90 points at its low Wednesday morning, amid
continued selling tied to worries that Enron-like accounting scandals
may engulf many more U.S. companies. Financial stocks also were hard
hit on concerns about possible losses from a new round of corporate
bankruptcies.</TE>
<TE>   But share prices already were in a rebound when the Fed announced
about 11:15 PST that it would keep its key short-term interest rate
at the current 40-year low of 1.75%--opting against another rate
cut--because of more signs that "economic activity is beginning to
firm."</TE>
<TE>   The Fed's statement helped propel the market in the final 90
minutes of trading. Winners topped losers by 3 to 2 on the New York
Stock Exchange and by 19 to 16 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   "The Fed clearly believes we are on the cusp of a recovery," said
Stuart Freeman, chief equity strategist at brokerage A.G. Edwards in
St. Louis. Though short-term interest rates may not fall further, the
benefits of the 11 cuts made in 2001 should continue to filter into
the economy and the stock market this year, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, investors have yet to see improvement in corporate earnings
overall: Fourth-quarter profit reports have generally been dismal.
And the market on Tuesday signaled its growing concern that corporate
financial data can't entirely be trusted, in the wake of Enron's
collapse and accounting controversies at other companies, including
banking firm PNC Financial, energy firm Williams and oil and gas
exploration firm Anadarko Petroleum.</TE>
<TE>   Some traders said Wednesday's rally stemmed in part from "short
covering" by bearish investors who had previously borrowed stock and
sold it, betting on lower prices. When the rally gained steam
Wednesday, some of those short-sellers opted to buy back stocks to
close out their bets, traders said.</TE>
<TE>   Others said the market's strength reflected the Fed's soothing
language: Though the central bank predicted recovery, it also said it
sees significant risk that the economy could weaken again. That
language indicates that the Fed is ready to cut rates further if need
be, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   In the bond market, long-term Treasury bond yields rose as the Fed
halted its rate-cutting campaign, at least for now. But the increases
were relatively modest. The 10-year T-note yield rose to 5.01% from
4.94% Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Longer-term yields are slightly below where they started the year,
suggesting that even if the Fed has stopped cutting short-term rates,
investors don't believe the central bank will begin raising rates
soon.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, that is the prevalent view among economists. Ken
Goldstein, economist at the Conference Board in New York, said the
Fed may not raise rates before late summer, even if the economy
continues to gain strength.</TE>
<TE>   That would keep rates on money-market mutual funds and other
short-term accounts near current record-low levels. The average
money-market fund yield is 1.46%, Imoneynet.com reported.</TE>
<TE>   But whether low yields will encourage more investors to shift
funds to the stock market remains to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, however, the bulls were in control again on Wall
Street. Retail stocks led the market higher, as investors bet that
retailers will be major beneficiaries if the economy is rebounding.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart rose $1.84 to $59.75, Home Depot jumped $2.07 to $49.07,
and Target gained $1.91 to $43.76.</TE>
<TE>   Many technology stocks also rebounded. Intel added $1.18 to
$33.86, Apple Computer rose $1.02 to $24.09 and IBM gained $2.55 to
$105.55.</TE>
<TE>   But some major telecom stocks continued to be weighed down in the
wake of fiber-optic-network operator Global Crossing's bankruptcy
filing this week. WorldCom Group slumped 55 cents to $9.85, the
lowest closing price since 1995. Qwest Communications fell $1.01 to
$10.75.</TE>
<TE>   Drug maker Elan tumbled $5.95 to $29.25 after a published report
questioned the company's accounting methods.</TE>
<TE>   But conglomerate Tyco, long rumored to use aggressive accounting,
rose $1.20 to $34.85 after plunging for much of this month. Tyco's
two top executives said they will buy a total of 1 million shares to
show their faith in the company.</TE>

<HD>MGM Pulls 'Rollerball' Ads After Judge Bars Campaign</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. said Wednesday that it has pulled television
and radio advertisements linking its upcoming action film
"Rollerball" to Universal Studios' street-racing summer hit, "The
Fast and the Furious."</LD>
<LD>   The move came after Universal took MGM to court, alleging that the
rival studio was misleading the public by stating in ads that
"Rollerball" was "from the film makers that brought you 'The Fast and
the Furious' and 'Die Hard.'"</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge A. Howard Matz issued a court
order barring MGM from "stating or suggesting" in ads that anyone
responsible for creative content of "The Fast and the Furious" also
was responsible for "Rollerball."</LD>
<TE>   Although "Rollerball" director John McTiernan directed the 1988
blockbuster, "Die Hard," the link to "The Fast and the Furious" was
more of a stretch. John Pogue, co-writer of "Rollerball," has an
executive producer credit for "The Fast and the Furious."</TE>
<TE>   "Rollerball" is scheduled to open Feb. 8.</TE>

<HD>Media Firms May Report Losses on NFL Contracts</HD>
<DH>Earnings: Walt Disney Co. and News Corp. may announce
write-downs as advertising on telecasts of professional football
games declines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walt Disney Co.'s ABC and ESPN networks and News Corp.'s Fox
Television may write down the value of their contracts to broadcast
National Football League games by as much as $1 billion, analysts
say.</LD>
<LD>   Such a move would be an admission that the broadcasters, along
with Viacom Inc.'s CBS network, paid too much when they signed a
record $17.6-billion, eight-year contract with the NFL in 1998, said
Richard Read, an analyst with Credit Lyonnais Securities Inc. CBS
said it doesn't plan a write-down because its NFL broadcasts are
profitable.</LD>
<LD>   The prospect for NFL write-downs comes in the slowest advertising
market in at least a decade.</LD>
<TE>   Reducing the value of the current contracts may be used by
networks to gain lower prices during the next round of TV-rights
negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   "Sports may help promote prime-time [programming] and draw younger
viewers, but the economics don't make sense anymore," Read said.</TE>
<TE>   Read and other media analysts said one or more of the companies
may announce a write-down when they report earnings in the days
before and after Sunday's Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Disney, which owns the ABC broadcast network and sports cable
channel ESPN, might write down at least $600 million and Fox might
write down as much as $400 million, Read said.</TE>
<TE>   Fox spokesman Andrew Butcher and Disney spokeswoman Christine
Castro declined to say whether the networks would write down their
NFL contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Viacom spokesman Carl Folta said CBS' broadcasts of professional
football are "profitable for us." A write-down of NFL rights would be
the first by a network in seven years.</TE>
<TE>   Turning a profit on the NFL has become even more difficult in one
of the worst media markets since World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Advertising on NFL games on broadcast and cable TV has declined
24% this year, according to Competitive Media Reporting, a New York
ad-tracking firm.</TE>
<TE>   "There's just a glut of sports content and advertising spots out
there right now," said Tom Wolzien, a media analyst with Sanford C.
Bernstein &amp; Co.</TE>

<HD>Northrop's Profit Climbs 4.8% After 2 Acquisitions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Northrop Grumman Corp., maker of the Global Hawk unmanned
surveillance aircraft in use over Afghanistan, said fourth-quarter
profit rose 4.8% as sales almost doubled after acquisitions.</LD>
<LD>   Net income rose to $131 million, or $1.28 a share, from $125
million, or $1.73, in the year-earlier period. The average number of
shares outstanding increased by 35%. Sales rose to $4.3 billion from
$2.2 billion, Northrop said in a statement.</LD>
<LD>   The profit increase came from Northrop's recent acquisitions of
Litton Industries Inc. and Newport News Shipbuilding Inc., making
Northrop the No. 1 builder of warships.</LD>
<TE>   Some investors have said they're concerned that Northrop may have
expanded too quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "The big question is, how are they going to be able to get cash
out of those businesses to pay down the debt," said Jonathan
Schrader, an analyst with Morningstar Inc., who follows the defense
and aerospace industries and says he doesn't own Northrop shares.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop Grumman shares rose 27 cents to $106.81 on the New York
Stock Exchange. They've risen 22% in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Century City-based Northrop, whose most notable program in recent
years was the B-2 stealth bomber, now gets about 25% of its profit
from shipbuilding, a business it entered last year after buying
Litton for $5.1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The company completed the $2.6-billion acquisition of Newport
News, the only maker of nuclear aircraft carriers, this month, after
the U.S. government blocked a bid by rival General Dynamics Corp. It
also expanded its businesses in systems and information technology,
areas in which Northrop Chairman Kent Kresa said he expects to see
growth.</TE>
<TE>   "The strategy that created the new Northrop Grumman has been
validated by the current defense spending priorities," Kresa said in
a conference call.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop's debt at the end of 2001 was $5 billion, almost five
times the $1.3 billion in debt the company had at the end of 2000.
Interest expense in the fourth quarter rose to $104 million from $40
million a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. and Moody's Investors Service have
assigned Northrop's debt their lowest investment-grade ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop will be able to get sufficient money out of its acquired
businesses to pay down debt, Chief Operating Officer Ronald Sugar
said in an interview. Northrop has acquired and successfully
integrated at least 14 companies in the last decade, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sales at Northrop's Electronic Systems business, which includes
air-traffic control and defense electronics, rose 60% to $1.5
billion, mostly because of the addition of Litton businesses.
Operating profit almost tripled to $145 million from $55 million a
year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop's Integrated Systems division, whose programs include the
B-2 and Global Hawk unmanned aerial vehicle, had a 24% drop in
operating profit, to $42 million from $52 million.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop said it expects to benefit from increases in spending on
intelligence, homeland security and precision-guided weapons.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Other California companies reporting earnings, excluding one-time
gains or charges unless noted:</TE>
<TE>   * Chiron Corp. reported net income was $44.8 million, or 23 cents
a share, compared to a loss of $134.4 million, or 74 cents, because
of acquisition costs, a year earlier. The Emeryville-based
biotechnology company said revenue increased 8.3% to $317.9 million
from $293.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   * McClatchy Co. reported net income fell to $20.9 million, or 46
cents a share, from $26.7 million, or 59 cents, a year earlier. The
Sacramento-based newspaper publisher said revenue fell to $276.7
million, down 10.7% from $310 million.</TE>

<HD>Enron Counsel Warned About Partnerships</HD>
<DH>Probe: Company's legal executive asked opinion of law firm
in April. Congressional investigators say it was to 'halt this
practice.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONE TEMPEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>The earliest warning sign yet about Enron Corp.'s outside investment
partnerships may have come from the company's in-house legal counsel.</LD>
<LD>   In April, Enron legal Vice President Jordan Mintz independently
asked a prominent New York law firm to review the partnerships and
provide legal advice.</LD>
<LD>   The resulting opinion, issued six weeks later by law firm Fried,
Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson, advised Enron to "halt this
practice," according to congressional investigators.</LD>
<TE>   Sources in Enron said Mintz was concerned about the partnerships
and took action without the knowledge or approval of senior
management, including Enron General Counsel James V. Derrick Jr. and
Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow.</TE>
<TE>   Mintz's action came four months before Vice President Sherron S.
Watkins sent her memo to Chairman Kenneth L. Lay warning of the
energy company's impending collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Mintz used the law firm's opinion to write one of several memos
opposing the network of off-the-books partnerships in which some
senior executives, notably Fastow, had financial interest. Enron used
some of the partnerships to hide debt from shareholders' view.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, it was a precarious route for Mintz, a 45-year-old
father of five, in the still-highflying corporation. Fastow had
recruited him for vice president and general counsel for Enron Global
Finance. Contacted Wednesday, Mintz declined to comment, citing
attorney-client privilege.</TE>
<TE>   Mintz's role in the Enron saga began to emerge this week as
congressional investigators asked Enron to provide a copy of the
Fried Frank report.</TE>
<TE>   The disclosure of Mintz's concerns is seen by investigators as
more evidence that top Enron executives were aware of the company's
problems long before they were publicly acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   Financial analysts began scrutinizing the company when Jeffrey K.
Skilling resigned as chief executive Aug. 14, but Skilling and Lay
insisted that the company was on solid footing.</TE>
<TE>   Another executive who may have been aware of the company's
problems was Jeffrey McMahon, the former company treasurer promoted
to president this week.</TE>
<TE>   In an Aug. 22 memo to Lay, Watkins identified McMahon (and former
Vice Chairman J. Clifford Baxter, who was found dead last week from
what police say was a suicide) as one of the executives concerned
about the partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   McMahon was asked Wednesday about his objections to the
partnerships. But McMahon, speaking to reporters in a conference call
about the company's restructuring, declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   "All these things are under investigation by a variety of
departments and authorities and whatnot. So in lieu of that, I think
I'd prefer just to stick on the restructuring topic today," McMahon
said.</TE>
<TE>   Mintz was recruited to Houston to work with Exxon Corp. and later
was hired by a large local law firm, Bracewell &amp; Patterson, where he
worked as a tax attorney for nine years.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, Enron was one of his firm's clients during a thwarted
hostile takeover attempt by Houston energy magnate Oscar Wyatt.
Impressed with his work, Enron hired Mintz later that year to work in
the corporate tax division.</TE>
<TE>   In October 2000, Fastow recruited Mintz to the legal team of Enron
Global Finance. It was there that Mintz first encountered the system
of partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   Mintz was one of several in the legal department wary of the
possible conflict of interest involved in doing business with
entities controlled by other Enron insiders.</TE>
<TE>   By April of last year, Mintz's concern was such that he believed
Enron could benefit from outside scrutiny. One reason for this, as
Watkins noted in her memo to Lay, was that Enron law firm Vinson &amp;
Elkins had approved many of the controversial partnerships. Derrick
was a former partner at Vinson &amp; Elkins.</TE>
<TE>   Among colleagues at Enron, it was understood that one of the main
reasons Mintz hired Fried Frank was that it had strong expertise in
securities law and had no affiliation with Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Six weeks later, the review by the New York law firm, according to
a letter to Derrick from the chairman of a House congressional
committee, concluded that Enron should "halt this practice" of the
special partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   In the letter to Derrick, Reps. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.),
chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and James C.
Greenwood (R-Pa.), chairman of the subcommittee on oversight and
investigations, asked for a copy of the law firm report.</TE>

<HD>Regal Cinemas Completes Chapter 11 Recovery Plan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Regal Cinemas Inc., the biggest movie theater chain, completed its
Chapter 11 reorganization and emerged from bankruptcy under the
ownership of an investors' group led by Denver billionaire Philip
Anschutz.</LD>
<LD>   In October, Regal became the eighth major U.S. theater operator to
file for protection from creditors in the last two years. U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Marian F. Harrison in Nashville approved the
company's recovery plan, which was supported by 95% of Regal's
creditors.</LD>
<LD>   Investors led by Anschutz Corp. and Oaktree Capital Management
converted their controlling stake in Regal's debt into new shares in
the closely held company.</LD>
<TE>   Knoxville, Tenn.-based Regal owns about 335 theaters with more
than 3,800 screens. Besides Regal, theater chains such as Loews
Cineplex Entertainment Corp. and General Cinemas Theaters Inc. have
filed for bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   The industry is suffering from a construction glut of so-called
multiplex and megaplex theaters, analysts say. The trend is being
reversed, they say, toward fewer screens and consolidation.</TE>

<HD>J&amp;J's Alza Sues Mylan to Block Generic Drug</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Johnson &amp; Johnson's Alza Corp. and Janssen Pharmaceutica filed a
lawsuit seeking to block Mylan Laboratories Inc. from selling a
version of Duragesic, a skin patch that administers painkillers.</LD>
<LD>   Alza, of Mountain View, Calif., said it owns the patent rights to
the skin patch. Johnson &amp; Johnson's Janssen, based in Titusville,
N.J., is the exclusive U.S. distributor of Duragesic.</LD>
<LD>   The company said the Duragesic patch had worldwide sales of $875
million last year.</LD>
<TE>   Mylan filed an application with the Food and Drug Administration
in December seeking approval to sell a generic version of the patch.
That application infringes the Alza patent, Alza and Janssen said in
a federal lawsuit filed Friday in Pittsburgh, where Mylan is based.</TE>
<TE>   The generic-drug maker filed a statement with the FDA saying its
skin patch wouldn't infringe the Alza patent, and alternatively that
the patent is invalid. Mylan officials couldn't be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Mylan shares fell 11 cents to $32.76, and shares of New Brunswick,
N.J.-based J&amp;J rose 2 cents to $57.20, both on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>* A legal assistant who tried to sell the trial strategy of
plaintiffs suing cigarette makers to tobacco industry lawyers was
sentenced to 21/2 years in prison. Said Farraj, 28, a former
paralegal at the New York office of Orrick, Harrington &amp; Sutcliffe,
pleaded guilty in October to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and
interstate transportation of stolen property.</LD>
<LD>   Orrick Harrington is one of several law firms that represented the
Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust, which paid out more than
$1 billion in claims by asbestos workers.</LD>
<LD>   The trust sued the tobacco industry to recoup a large portion of
the funds, alleging that cigarette makers concealed information that
smoking heightened health risks to asbestos workers.</LD>

<HD>American Shifts Airbus Jets to U.S., Caribbean</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>AMR Corp.'s American Airlines is moving 10 Airbus A300 jetliners from
transatlantic routes to flights in the U.S. and Caribbean, replacing
the planes with longer-range Boeing Co. aircraft.</LD>
<LD>   The move comes about 10 weeks after an American A300 crashed in
New York and after some pilots called for the company to ground its
34 A300s until the cause is determined. The change is part of a plan
created last year and isn't related to the accident or safety
concerns, American spokesman John Hotard said.</LD>
<LD>   Concern that the aircraft may be unsafe prompted some pilots to
transfer from A300s, union spokesman Capt. Sam Mayer said.</LD>
<TE>   Some A300 pilots want to be sure that the Nov. 12 crash wasn't
caused by a defect that could exist in other A300s.</TE>
<TE>   American, the largest airline, said in May that it would use
Boeing 767 and 777 aircraft to replace A300s flying across the
Atlantic. Ten A300s now used on those flights are better suited to
flights within the U.S. and to the Caribbean, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Fort Worth-based AMR fell 5 cents to $25.02 on the NYSE.</TE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The European Union is poised to clear the $23.1-billion merger of
Hewlett-Packard Co. and Compaq Computer Corp. without requiring
divestitures, a source close to the negotiations said.</LD>
<LD>   The EU has a deadline today to announce whether it will approve
the deal or launch a four-month investigation into antitrust
concerns.</LD>
<LD>   Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for EU Competition Commissioner Mario
Monti, said only, "There has been no decision. There will be an
announcement Thursday."</LD>
<TE>   An in-depth probe by the European Commission would be especially
problematic for Hewlett-Packard as it tries to rein in rebellious
shareholders, observers said. Instead, early clearance in Europe
could help Hewlett-Packard win over some shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett-Packard and Compaq together would have about 22% or 23% of
the European market for personal computers but about 47% of the
market for more powerful servers and disk storage units, according to
researcher firm Gartner-Dataquest.</TE>
<TE>   Palo Alto-based HP and Houston-based Compaq have said they would
await regulatory clearance before setting a date for a shareholder
vote.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. review is still underway.</TE>
<TE>   HP shares gained 39 cents to $29.92, while Compaq rose 77 cents to
$11.99, both on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Chile Agrees to Buy Lockheed Fighter Jets</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chile agreed to buy 10 Lockheed Martin Corp. F-16 fighter jets for
$660 million in the first sale of advanced U.S. warplanes to South
America in two decades.</LD>
<LD>   Chilean President Ricardo Lagos agreed to the purchase in part
because the air force secured an agreement by General Electric Co.,
which will make the F-16s' engines, to build a center that will
provide global technical support for the company's civilian and
military aircraft engines, Defense Minister Michelle Bachelet said.</LD>
<LD>   Officials didn't give a value for so-called offsets by GE and
Lockheed.</LD>
<TE>   Bachelet rejected criticism that such a purchase could trigger an
arms race in the region.</TE>
<TE>   The Chilean air force has tried for four years to buy the aircraft
to replace 30-year-old A-37 fighters. The air force chose F-16s over
Boeing Co.'s F-18 jet among others.</TE>
<TE>   The sale would be the first since former President Clinton lifted
a two-decade-old arms embargo to Latin America in 1997. The jets are
scheduled to be delivered in 2004 and 2005.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Skechers U.S.A. Inc., a maker of platform and other trendy shoes,
claims in a lawsuit that L.A. Gear used its design for Sport Energy
and other sneakers for a competing line of less expensive footwear.</LD>
<LD>   Manhattan Beach-based Skechers said it has patents for the
athletic sneaker, popularized with ads featuring pop singer Britney
Spears, as well as Sport Noogies and Sport Gators shoes. It claims
L.A. Gear is using Skechers' logo and likeness to confuse shoppers.</LD>
<LD>   Skechers is seeking a court order barring the sale of the shoes,
sold under brand names such as Kiana, and at least $10million in
damages from L.A. Gear, which filed for bankruptcy protection in
1998.</LD>
<TE>   L.A. Gear was the third-largest branded athletic shoemaker in the
late 1980s before it suffered a string of annual losses and filed for
Chapter 11 protection in 1998. The firm, which is controlled by PCH
Investments, now licenses products and no longer manufactures shoes.</TE>
<TE>   A call to Los Angeles-based L.A. Gear was not returned.</TE>

<HD>Bowl's Ad Prices Take a Dip</HD>
<DH>Marketing: Second year of falling rates for most-watched
show comes as advertisers reassess commitments to other big events.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Super Bowl advertising rates are dropping for the second straight
year, the first back-to-back decline and a sign that even the
nation's most-watched show cannot avoid the recession and growing
competition from other media events.</LD>
<LD>   The rate drop comes as advertisers are reassessing commitments to
other widely watched broadcasts, including the Academy Awards and the
upcoming Olympic Winter Games.</LD>
<LD>   Rates for a 30-second spot in Sunday's Fox network broadcast from
New Orleans' Superdome will slip below the $2-million average that
CBS commanded last year, Fox executives said Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   The News Corp.-owned network has sold 95% of the commercial time
available and expects to sell out its inventory before kickoff. Fox
said earlier that it had trimmed its pregame show by 21/2 hours, to
just more than four hours, because of the weak ad market.</TE>
<TE>   Fox's sales team also has been hampered by competition from a
crush of media events, most notably the Winter Olympics, which begin
Feb. 8 in Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   "Getting close to $2 million in this advertising environment is
still pretty respectable," said Lou D'Ermilio, Fox's vice president
of media relations.</TE>
<TE>   The Super Bowl isn't the only big-ticket attraction scrambling to
court recession-wary advertisers. The U.S. Olympic Committee is
jump-starting efforts to market the Olympic movement, and Advertising
Age magazine reported Monday that the cost of a 30-second spot on
ABC's March 24 Academy Awards broadcast will slip below last year's
$1.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   "There's definitely not the same kind of fight" for advertisers to
get on big-ticket broadcasts because of the stalled economy, said
Connie Dotson, head of marketing and communications for Super Bowl
halftime show sponsor ETrade Group Inc. Rather than simply signing on
the dotted line, advertisers are carefully selecting alliances "where
you're going to get the biggest bang," Dotson said.</TE>
<TE>   Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. is among those picking and choosing its ad
commitments. Despite its role as an Olympic supplier, Sears isn't
running advertising during NBC broadcasts of the Winter Games.</TE>
<TE>   "February typically is not a big broadcast month for us," said
Sears spokeswoman Lee Antonio. Sears instead used print advertising
in late December and early January to promote a contest offering
customers a trip to the Salt Lake City games. Late last year American
Express Co. opted not to renew its longtime sponsorship of the
Academy Awards show.</TE>
<TE>   "We're moving toward sponsorship where we can build in special
experiences for our cardholders," said spokeswoman Judy Tenzer. One
key example of that sponsorship model is the World Golf Championship;
American Express can use its sponsorship relationship with Tiger
Woods to reward cardholders.</TE>
<TE>   The slow economy and the wealth of competing events translates
into "some real opportunities" for advertisers, said Carolyn Bivens,
the Los Angeles-based president and chief operating officer at
media-buying firm Initiative Media North America.</TE>
<TE>   But Bivens maintains that the two-year dip in Super Bowl
commercial prices doesn't necessarily signal serious problems for the
Super Bowl broadcast. A "wild spike in pricing" generated by
cash-rich dot-coms in 2000 pushed rates far beyond what the market
could support. "Pricing started to come back to reality in 2001,"
Bivens said.</TE>
<TE>   Fox's D'Ermilio maintains that Super Bowl advertising remains
relatively strong compared with the overall broadcast market. Super
Bowl rates soared by 67% between 1997 and 2000, D'Ermilio said, while
prime-time rates on the Big Four networks rose by only 18%.</TE>
<TE>   A handful of companies, including Volkswagen and Cingular
Wireless, walked away from the Super Bowl after last year's
broadcast. Electronic Data Systems Corp., which advertised in the
last three Super Bowl broadcasts, this year opted to run 50
commercials during NBC's Olympic broadcast.</TE>
<TE>   EDS Senior Vice President Don Uzzi described the Olympics as
"wildly successful" for EDS, which ran funny spots that showed
cowboys struggling to herd cats and squirrels running free in
Pamplona.</TE>
<TE>   Why shift? EDS' new message about its services is "too complex" to
fit into a single, 60-second spot, Uzzi said. "With the Olympics,
we've got 17 days to bang home our message, and that's very appealing
to us."</TE>
<TE>   Strategy is as important for the more than two dozen advertisers
suiting up for the big game as it is for the St. Louis Rams and the
New England Patriots.</TE>
<TE>   If advertisers are lucky, Sunday's football broadcast will mirror
the 2000 Super Bowl, when the Rams defeated the Tennessee Titans in a
game that wasn't decided until the final play. If they're unlucky,
the game will be a blowout like last year's game won by the Baltimore
Ravens, and viewers will be more worried about the supply of
guacamole than the game.</TE>
<TE>   Such Super Bowl veterans as Anheuser-Busch Cos., with 10 spots of
30 seconds, and Pepsi-Cola Co., with six 30-second spots, guaranteed
themselves a strong showing by paying premiums to run most of their
spots during the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Several rookies also are making their Super Bowl debut with costly
first-half commercials.</TE>
<TE>   The Quizno's sandwich chain purchased a single 30-second spot
during the first quarter to kick off a national television
advertising campaign. The relatively small chain, with 1,500 units,
paid a premium because "the Super Bowl audience is right in the
middle of our demographic," said Quizno's President Rick Schaden.
"There will be 90 million of them, all in one place, and all there to
watch the advertising."</TE>
<TE>   H&amp;R Block's second-quarter commercial is a satirical look at the
avalanche of tax code changes consumers must wade through this year.
The firm hired the movie-making Coen brothers ("O Brother," "Fargo")
to produce its spot, which features the Beatles' "Taxman" in the
soundtrack</TE>
<TE>   For the sixth year in a row, Pizza Hut has purchased the last
commercial spot before the coin toss. Phone orders peak just minutes
before the game begins.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't make sense for us to be selling pizzas in the second
half," said spokeswoman Julie Hildebrand.</TE>

<HD>Viacom's Board Tells Top Executives to Work It Out</HD>
<DH>Media: The directors want Redstone and Karmazin to
concentrate on running the entertainment giant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Moving to contain a management crisis at Viacom Inc., the company's
board of directors Wednesday instructed the two feuding top
executives to patch up their differences and concentrate on running
the world's second-largest entertainment giant, according to sources
close to the situation.</LD>
<LD>   The board told President and Chief Operating Officer Mel Karmazin
to fulfill his employment contract, which expires at the end of next
year, the sources said. One source said Karmazin informed the board
at the meeting that he would not seek to renew the contract, allowing
Chairman and Chief Executive Sumner Redstone to name a successor.</LD>
<LD>   It is unclear whether Karmazin was seeking to resign or exit from
his contract early.</LD>
<TE>   Some Viacom investors were bracing this week for the departure of
Redstone's second-in-command after a stormy 20-month marriage that
has created uncertainty on Wall Street, put pressure on the company's
stock and created division within top management.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the board's efforts to resolve the conflict, analysts and
investors privately doubted Wednesday that the two executives could
share power and co-exist for another two years.</TE>
<TE>   Karmazin, a former chief executive of CBS Corp., gained operating
control of Viacom as part of the May 2000 merger of the two
companies. But Redstone, who owns 68% of Viacom's voting stock,
increasingly has chafed under this arrangement after calling the
shots at his company for so many years.</TE>
<TE>   The company's bylaws prevent Redstone from firing Karmazin without
the approval of 14 of the board's 18 directors. Redstone would be
hard-pressed to force out Karmazin in a board vote, since eight of
the 18 directors are CBS appointees.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Karmazin is beloved by investors and money managers,
who could drive down the stock further if he departed.</TE>

<HD>Credit Agency Gives Anaheim a Breather</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC BALLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Responding to a rebound in Anaheim's tourist business, a major
credit-rating agency Wednesday lifted its threat to lower the city's
bond rating.</LD>
<LD>   Standard &amp; Poor's in October had placed Anaheim's "AA" general
obligation bonds on "credit watch" because of the city's heavy
exposure to a tourism slump after the terrorist attacks. Anaheim gets
about half its revenue from hotel and sales taxes.</LD>
<LD>   Although the credit watch covered only $8.2 million in general
obligation bonds, a downgrade could have made future borrowing more
costly.</LD>
<TE>   The rating agency said Anaheim's hotel-tax revenue jumped to 89%
of budgeted levels in November, after plummeting to 59% in September
and 60% in October. The city's sales tax revenue, meanwhile, has met
and slightly exceeded monthly projections, S&amp;P said in a release.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly, in an annual speech that coincided with
S&amp;P's announcement, said the removal of the credit watch reflects the
city's improved outlook. He said  the city already had jettisoned its
unofficial hiring freeze imposed shortly after the terrorist attacks.
Daly's comments were echoed by Charles Ahlers, president of the
Anaheim/Orange County Visitor &amp; Convention Bureau. He said the
convention center expects to draw 1 million to 1.1 million visitors
this year, up from 960,000 in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Frederik Kluvers, general manager of the Radisson Hotel Maingate
in Anaheim, said his hotel  has ended the deep discounts it began
offering after the attacks cut deeply into occupancy. He said his
hotel's 51% occupancy in January was only three percentage points
lower than last year's rate in the same month.</TE>

<HD>$100-Million Bolsa Chica Plan OKd</HD>
<DH>Environment: Lands panel signs off on the most expensive
wetlands project in state history. But mesa battle continues as court
ruling is reversed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California State Lands Commission quickly and unanimously
approved a $100-million plan to restore the Bolsa Chica wetlands
Wednesday, even as a judge allowed a landowner's lawsuit to go
forward on a development proposed for the bluffs above the marsh.</LD>
<LD>   The decisions Wednesday provided the latest twists in the
three-decades-long tale of Bolsa Chica, once a flourishing coastal
marsh that was cut off from the ocean a century ago by duck hunters
and later contaminated by oil fields. Still, Bolsa Chica--meaning
"Little Pocket" in Spanish--is the largest remaining wetlands complex
in Southern California and a key stopover for migratory birds.</LD>
<LD>   The restoration plan--approved on a 3-0 vote by the State Lands
Commission--aims to turn the 1,200-acre coastal expanse of polluted
salt marshes, mudflats, pools and oil rigs into a flourishing
ecosystem. The plan, the most expensive wetlands restoration in state
history, calls for cutting a 360-foot-wide channel through five acres
of sandy beach that lie between the ocean and the wetlands, and
building a traffic bridge over the channel. The resulting infusion of
seawater and tidal circulation is expected to restore wildlife
habitat and help several species of imperiled birds and fish.</LD>
<TE>   "It took five years of hard work to acquire the land and design a
restoration project that would meet environmental goals and satisfy
the local community," state Controller and Commission Chairwoman
Kathleen Connell said in a written statement.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's vote to adopt the project clears the way for a viable
marine wetland that will preserve wildlife and leave a lasting legacy
for future generations of Californians."</TE>
<TE>   The plan still needs nods from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Santa Ana Regional Water
Quality Control Board--all expected to be easily gained. Restoration
work is expected to begin in 2003 and to take about three years.</TE>
<TE>   However, the fate of the two-tier mesa remains at the center of an
ongoing dispute.</TE>
<TE>   A San Diego County Superior Court judge reversed herself, deciding
to allow a lawsuit by developer Hearthside Homes and landowner Signal
Landmark against the California Coastal Commission to go forward.</TE>
<TE>   The sister companies claim that the commission illegally "took"
the property by so severely restricting what could be built that
development was no longer economically feasible.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Sheridan E. Reed had issued a tentative ruling in August
that tossed out many of Hearthside's and Signal's claims, saying they
had been decided in previous litigation and that they had not proved
the commission acted improperly.</TE>
<TE>   However, in Wednesday's ruling, she said these issues were open to
debate.</TE>
<TE>   "We're pleased with" Reed's ruling, said Hearthside and Signal
attorney Michael Berger. "It means that our case against the
commission will go to trial."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Douglas, the Coastal Commission's executive director, said
the ruling was rife with factual errors. "I'm really puzzled by this,
but our attorneys are going to have to spend time and the court is
going to have to spend time dealing with issues that seem to me to be
pretty clear-cut."</TE>
<TE>   Development proposals have been repeatedly scaled back since
Signal's predecessor, the Signal Bolsa Corp., bought about 2,000
acres at Bolsa Chica for close to $20 million in 1970. Since then,
Signal and its affiliates have spent about $90 million trying to
develop the land, but received $25 million from the state when it
purchased 880 acres of wetlands five years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Various proposals have won Coastal Commission approval--in 1986,
'96 and '97--and seen involvement by Congress, federal agencies and
state officials. The project was once envisioned as a marina, hotels
and 5,700 homes on 1,547 acres of wetlands and mesa, but it has been
dramatically scaled back over the years in the wake of a series of
court challenges by activists.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, the developer wants to build 1,235 homes on the
230-acre mesa. But the state Coastal Commission in November limited
that the development to 65 acres on the upper bench of the mesa, a
ruling that led to the suit.</TE>

<LD>Emergency officials Wednesday said they will be notified "within
minutes" if federal authorities uncover a threat of a terrorist
attack in Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   Sheriff Michael S. Carona also said the county's Emergency
Operations Center has been activated several times since the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks because of perceived threats.</LD>
<LD>   Carona talked with reporters during a daylong training exercise to
prepare for an attack. More than 200 law enforcement, fire, health
and other emergency personnel hunkered down in a remote hilltop
bunker near Irvine Lake, practicing responses to a variety of
terrorist threats on potential targets.</LD>
<TE>   For security reasons, Carona declined to disclose specific
scenarios. However, the results of the drill were reassuring, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are safe. We are very safe," Carona said. "We're prepared to
respond to any incident that may take place."</TE>
<TE>   George V. Vinson, whom Gov. Gray Davis recently hired as his
special advisor on state security, came to watch the exercise and
brief local officials on the latest directives from the White House.</TE>
<TE>   "The protection of all Californians rests in the hands of the
sheriffs, the police chiefs, the fire chiefs, the emergency medical
people on the ground in the geographical location," Vinson said. "Not
at the bureaucratic federal level."</TE>
<TE>   Vinson met with President Bush last week along with other state
security chiefs, and he said Bush assured them that the federal
government will do whatever it takes to protect the American public.</TE>
<TE>   Vinson said the newly created federal Office of Homeland Security
is developing a four-level warning system to alert state and local
officials when terrorist threats surface--a major improvement over
the bureaucratic protocol before the September attacks.</TE>

<HD>Family in Deadly Fire Removed Sole Alarm</HD>
<DH>Tragedy: Broken device found in bedroom. Blaze killed
Placentia man and his three young sons.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The only smoke alarm in the house where Donald Ybarra and his three
young sons died in a fast-moving blaze was broken and had been
removed shortly before the fire, his wife told authorities.</LD>
<LD>   Fire investigators combing through the blackened ruins of the
Placentia home said Wednesday that the detector was found on the top
of a dresser in a bedroom, where Melodie Ybarra last remembered
seeing it.</LD>
<LD>   "We found it exactly where she said it was," said Bill Crow, a
case investigator for the Orange County Fire Authority who has
interviewed Ybarra twice.</LD>
<TE>   Ybarra, who escaped Monday night's fire with second-degree burns,
told officials that the alarm was removed this month from a wall
outside the two upstairs bedrooms where her sons slept.</TE>
<TE>   The boys--Brandon, 7, Connor, 4, and Jacob, 2--died along with
their dad as flames engulfed their home too quickly for neighbors and
firefighters to rescue them.</TE>
<TE>   Many municipal building codes require at least one smoke detector
and sometimes additional ones for new homes, depending on their size
and layout, said Capt. Stephen J. Miller, a spokesman for the Orange
County Fire Authority. And older homes must be brought up to code
when they are sold.</TE>
<TE>   But the agency has the jurisdiction to inspect and enforce only in
apartments and businesses; it lacks such jurisdiction over private
homes, Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   At the Ybarra home Wednesday, more than a dozen investigators were
re-interviewing witnesses and canvassing the charred shell of the
house on Joan Way as they searched for clues about how the fire
started and why it spread so swiftly. They worked under tents at a
makeshift command center set up in the middle of the cul-de-sac.
"They're still working diligently to find a cause," Miller said.
"We've got every available investigator working on it."</TE>
<TE>   Officials believe the fire may have started in the living room or
adjacent kitchen, given the extent of damage to those areas. They
have yet to find any flammable materials that may have acted as an
accelerant, Crow said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators are also trying to determine where in the house
Donald Ybarra was when the fire started. His wife has told
investigators and friends that she had gone to bed and that as far as
she knew, her husband was alone in the living room watching
television.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to have to keep putting the puzzle together," Crow
said. "Right now, the timeline makes huge S-turns."</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors searching for answers themselves occasionally milled
beyond the police tape, some staring silently and others sobbing.
Flowers, candles and toys were lined up at the foot of a chain-link
fence put up by investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Word that the Ybarras had no working smoke detectors spread
quickly along Joan Way and nearby streets. Many families say they've
been scrambling to make sure their homes have them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a life-and-death decision," Crow said. "Over and over again,
[smoke detectors] prove how successful they are. Even if it buys 20
more seconds, it could be enough to save you."</TE>
<TE>   Michelle Bishop, a friend of the Ybarras who lives across the
street with her three young children, said her house had only one
detector before Monday's fire: downstairs, near her and her husband's
bedroom. On Tuesday, her husband installed two more alarms, putting
them upstairs where the kids sleep and where the furnace is. He also
bought four more to put up around the home. "If there's anything we
can learn from this," Bishop said, cradling her infant daughter,
"it's that smoke detectors are definitely important."</TE>
<TE>   Funeral arrangements for Donald Ybarra and the children are
pending, but a memorial fund has been established at the McAulay
Wallace Mortuary, 902 N. Harbor Blvd., Fullerton CA 92832.

<LD>The campaigns to build new stages for Orange County's two leading
performing arts organizations reaped some of the largest rewards
among $1.6 million in grants being given to 166 charitable groups by
the Pacific Life Foundation.</LD>
<LD>   The grants announced Wednesday also will assist construction of a
new cathedral in Los Angeles and help preserve one of the state's
oldest churches, Mission San Juan Capistrano.</LD>
<LD>   A flagging economy, however, will reduce overall giving this year
by the foundation set up by Pacific Life, a privately held insurance
company based in Newport Beach.</LD>
<TE>   The grants are about half the $3 million the foundation expects to
disburse this year; that is down 13.3% from the record $3.4 million

<LD>Drug dealers, gang members and even murderers have filed uneventfully
through the metal detectors at Orange County's main courthouse in
Santa Ana for years. Now a former congressional candidate has become
the first person arrested for bringing a loaded weapon into the
building.</LD>
<LD>   Johnnie Robert Crean, who lost a 1982 bid to represent parts of
Orange and San Diego counties in Congress, was arrested Tuesday when
sheriff's officials discovered a handgun in a bag he was carrying.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a senior moment," Crean, 52, said Wednesday. He said he'd
forgotten he'd put the weapon in his bag last week.</LD>
<TE>   An Orange County sheriff's spokesman said an officer operating the
X-ray machine at the building's entrance noticed what looked like a
gun in a black canvas bag Crean had placed on the machine.</TE>
<TE>   Crean, son of a travel-trailer industry tycoon, said he was at the
courthouse for a hearing on a dispute about equipment he had leased
and suddenly recalled the firearm while watching the officer.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a really funny look on his face. And I said, 'Oh, I think
I need to take my bag back to my car,'" Crean said.  Crean granted
the officer permission to search the bag, and he found a fully loaded
9mm Glock handgun, sheriff's spokesman Jim Amormino said.</TE>
<TE>   Crean was arrested on suspicion of possessing a weapon in a public
building. He posted $10,000 bail.</TE>

<DH>Farming: Berry growers in Orange and Ventura counties go on
defensive against the cold weather.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE and FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the second night in a row Wednesday, Orange County strawberry
growers were preparing to stay up past midnight in case temperatures
fall below freezing as they had the night before.</LD>
<LD>   Below-freezing temperatures, they say, are a major threat to the
county's strawberry crop, worth about $80.5 million a year.</LD>
<LD>   "So far, no one has reported any major damage," said Rick
Lefeuvre, the county's agricultural commissioner. "Strawberry farmers
are pretty sophisticated and they watch the temperatures like a
hawk."</LD>
<TE>   The same appeared true in agriculture-rich Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   "We dodged a bullet, no question about it," said Earl McPhail,
Ventura County's agricultural commissioner. That's not to say it was
easy.</TE>
<TE>   After only a few hours' sleep, Santa Paula citrus and avocado
rancher Bob Pinkerton was up at 10 p.m. Tuesday, responding to an
alarm warning that the temperature had dropped to 34 degrees in one
of his orchards.</TE>
<TE>   He had spent Tuesday afternoon running sprinklers in his groves, a
frost-protection measure that can raise the temperature by as much as
4 degrees. Now he had to hop out of bed to fire up his 15 wind
machines, a move aimed at circulating the warmer air hovering closer
to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "When that alarm rings, you go," Pinkerton said. Pinkerton would
be at it all night. As the wind machines buzzed overhead, the veteran
rancher monitored a series of thermometers staked throughout his
orchard.</TE>
<TE>   The temperature would have to drop to 28 degrees or below, for at
least a couple of hours, to cause significant crop damage, Pinkerton
explained.</TE>
<TE>   By 5 a.m., temperatures were still below freezing. But it had only
dropped to 28 degrees once during the night, and then for less than
half an hour.</TE>
<TE>   By sunrise Wednesday he was prepared to declare victory, at least
for the night. "I think we won," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Temperatures in some areas of Orange County fell even lower than
those in Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   Late Tuesday night, thermometers fell to 26 degrees in some
agricultural areas, the lowest in years.</TE>
<TE>   To protect their strawberry crops, Lefeuvre said, most growers
turned on sprinkler systems, dousing the berries with a layer of
water that freezes and provides them with insulation. "The cold [air]
freezes the fruit, which turns black and isn't marketable," said
Leonel Garcia, manager of Pinnacle Farms, which grows strawberries on
about 400 acres in Irvine. "What the sprinkler does is create a
coating of ice over the fruit that insulates it from the cold."</TE>
<TE>   As a result of the action, he said, losses Tuesday night were
limited to about 30% of the crop on 10 to 20 acres of land--damage he
described as negligible.</TE>
<TE>   But workers would be on hand late Wednesday, he said, to again
monitor the temperature.</TE>
<TE>   "We will most likely turn it on again," he said. "The cold could
last another two days and maybe into early next week."</TE>
<TE>   Other farmers said they were doing the same.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unseasonably cold," said Doug Circle, owner of Sunrise
Growers of Placentia, "probably the coldest we've had in the last
five or six years."</TE>
<TE>   While Tuesday's low temperatures caused "a big amount of damage"
to the February crop, he said, it probably affected less than 5% of
the total. The main economic drain, Circle said, was the "huge cost"
of people working overtime to monitor the weather, the cost of water
for the sprinkler systems and the disruption to the harvesting cycle.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Circle said, the industry would survive. "This is outside
the norm, but not unexpected. We'll get through it because we're
prepared to live with the weather--it's all part of farming."</TE>
<TE>   Minor damage was reported in some of the coldest pockets of
Ventura County.</TE>

<HD>7% of CSU Freshmen Are Ousted for Lack of Skills</HD>
<DH>Education: Proportion who fail to master basic English and
math concepts climbs slightly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA TROUNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California State University system has kicked out more than 2,200
students--nearly 7% of last year's freshman class--for failing to
master basic English and math skills within a year of enrollment.</LD>
<LD>   This and other evidence of the Cal State system's continuing
effort to crack down on unprepared students was released Wednesday in
an annual report on remedial education to the system's board of
trustees.</LD>
<LD>   The proportion of students ousted at the end of the freshman year
is just slightly higher than in the two previous years. The
university began dropping students it deemed unprepared three years
ago.</LD>
<TE>   Students' lack of preparation shows as well in the number of
incoming freshmen who this year failed proficiency tests and were
required to take remedial math and English composition courses.
Forty-six percent of those who enrolled systemwide in the fall needed
at least one remedial class in math, and the same proportion needed
help in basic English composition skills. The figures were similar to
the previous year's.</TE>
<TE>   Locally, Cal State Fullerton freshmen generally scored better than
the systemwide average when it came to math, but slightly worse in
English. The proportion who needed to study remedial math was 38%,
while the proportion required to take English was 49%.</TE>
<TE>   About 6% of Cal State Fullerton freshmen, 166 of them, were kicked
out of school for failing the remedial classes. An additional 3%
dropped out before the term ended.</TE>
<TE>   The number of Cal State Fullerton freshmen required to take
remedial classes has been falling steadily, down from 54% in 1998 to
43.5% this fall. The number required to take remedial English has
dropped much less, from 51% to 49%.</TE>
<TE>   Cal State officials said they were disappointed in the systemwide
trends, noting particularly that they had hoped to see more
improvement in math skills, which had been steadily rising in recent
years.</TE>
<TE>   The level of English skills among incoming freshmen has remained
constant for the last three years, Spence said, with only 54%
demonstrating proficiency.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the lack of improvement, university officials said they
believed that some of their efforts to boost student proficiency
would ultimately pay off, and they urged trustees to continue to
support the reform efforts launched by the university in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "While we have not yet achieved the trustees' goals, it was
acknowledged from the beginning that these were ambitious goals,"
said David Spence, vice chancellor of the university system, who
presented the report.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to stay the course. We really believe that within two to
three years, we will see more results, better results," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the policy adopted by trustees six years ago, the 22-campus
system was directed to reduce remedial education to no more than 10%
of Cal State freshmen by 2007. Even as it tries to ease out remedial
education, the university system has been working to help high school
juniors and seniors boost their skills before they reach college.</TE>
<TE>   One part of the policy was to get tough on Cal State students who
arrive on campus unprepared to do the required university-level work.</TE>
<TE>   So, as classes ended last spring, the university notified 2,277
students throughout the system that, because they had not passed
their remedial classes, they could not re-enroll at the university
for their sophomore year. Instead, they were encouraged to go to a
community college to learn the skills needed to pass the exams in
math and English.</TE>
<TE>   Spence and other Cal State officials said enforcement of the
policy varies from campus to campus. But in general, they said, those
students who were kicked out had demonstrated little effort to
acquire the necessary skills, either failing to register for remedial
classes during their freshmen year or rarely attending.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the university system is trying in a variety of
ways to persuade students to learn--and schools to teach--these
skills much earlier, well before entering college.</TE>
<TE>   Under a $9-million program, Cal State faculty members work closely
with 172 high schools around the state that historically send the
university system the greatest number of students needing remedial
help. Through this outreach program, now in its second year, the
university focuses on students likely to be admitted, to make sure
that those who need extra help are identified early and receive
remedial courses, if possible while they're still in high school.</TE>
<TE>   University officials said that there are no studies yet to show
the effectiveness of the program but that anecdotal evidence from the
participating high schools indicates significant improvement in the
skills of students.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope we'll see that [improvement] in the students who are
applying for college in the fall of 2002," said Allison Jones,
assistant vice chancellor for access and retention.</TE>
<TE>   But, he said, Cal State now believes that it has identified the
problem and that the issue is not the writing skills of the tested
students, but their ability to read analytically.</TE>
<TE>   "What we found was that students were really falling down on the
reading part, with 78% not passing," Spence said.</TE>
<TE>   As part of an existing program for high school teachers, he said,
the university has developed a system for helping them learn to
better convey to their students the necessary skills in reading and
critical thinking. Spence also said Cal State has the highest
placement standards of any public university in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from taking the university's own placement tests when they
arrive, students can get out of remedial classes by scoring a minimum
of 550 on the math part and 550 on the verbal portion of the SAT.
Most others set that standard at 500, he said, with some even lower.</TE>

<LD>A San Fernando police officer was recovering from leg and shoulder
wounds a day after being shot by a suspected car thief, officials
said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The man who shot Officer Carlos Gutierrez, 25, was killed by
return fire from police, officials said. The Los Angeles coroner's
office identified him as Robert Contreras, 21, of San Fernando.</LD>
<LD>   Gutierrez was in a Mission Hills hospital, where he was scheduled
for more surgery, San Fernando Police Lt. Dan Peavy said.</LD>
<TE>   The three-year veteran was shot early Tuesday as police chased
four suspects who fled from a stolen truck that crashed into a
Sepulveda Boulevard median, south of Chatsworth Street.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Contreras hid behind a car and opened fire as
Gutierrez approached. Gutierrez was among the officers who returned
fire. Contreras collapsed as he tried to run and died in the driveway
of a Halbrent Avenue home, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Two juveniles were arrested Tuesday on suspicion of felony
joy-riding after a witness led police to a San Fernando home. They
will not be charged in connection with the shooting, Los Angeles
Police Officer Jason Lee said.</TE>
<TE>   A fourth suspect is still being sought, police said. All the
suspects are believed to be gang members, officers said.</TE>

hate crime.</LD>
<LD>   Vandals broke into the van while it was behind Agape Community
Church, 45313 Beech Ave. in Lancaster, and defaced it with swastikas,
white-power symbols and hateful words, a sheriff's report said.</LD>

a month ago.</LD>
<TE>   "Most people are aware the skinheads started here and there is

<HD>Recent Quakes Unearth Some Unpleasant Memories of '94</HD>
<DH>Fear: This week's series of small jolts have rattled nerves
among many who recall the Northridge temblor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA and GARIOT LOUIMA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's been eight years since the Northridge quake and twice that long
since Chris Hess was taught the earthquake drill so familiar to
California schoolchildren.</LD>
<LD>   But for each of the dozens of small quakes that have rolled
through the region since Monday--all aftershocks of the 1994
temblor--Hess remembered the childhood drill and ran for the nearest
doorway.</LD>
<LD>   This week's quakes, the largest a 4.2 shaker Monday night, have
prompted the 25-year-old Cal State Northridge student and many other
Southern Californians to brush up on quake preparedness skills and
try to calm their nerves.</LD>
<TE>   "Northridge started small, then it escalated and the shaking
didn't seem to stop," Hess said. Monday night's quake "started off
small, and thank God it stayed little."</TE>
<TE>   Those who have religiously kept their water bottles filled and
valuables glued to the shelves since January 1994 said the
aftershocks of the 6.7-magnitude quake justify their preparations for
the Big One.</TE>
<TE>   "Northridge taught us to be prepared rather than just run around
being scared," said Robin Galvez, 54, who lives in Simi Valley near
the epicenter of the recent quakes.</TE>
<TE>   Galvez said she keeps a 55-gallon tank of water and a week's
supply of canned food in the kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   Monday night's temblor, however, sent her cat--which was wedged
between a couch and an end table for days after the 1994 quake--under
her bed.</TE>
<TE>   Tara Condon, a Simi Valley manicurist who is eight months
pregnant, said she didn't realize there had been a quake Monday night
until her husband ran to tell her.</TE>
<TE>   "I just thought it was me walking because I'm so fat," said
Condon, 37.  "But my husband comes running in, screaming and yelling
about the Big One coming. I just laughed at him."</TE>
<TE>   The couple have started putting their shoes by the bed before
going to sleep, and her husband has insisted she wear pajama bottoms,
Condon said. "He's just Mr. Paranoid," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Curtis Swartley, 22, said customers at Brunswick Valley Bowl in
Simi Valley weren't worried.</TE>
<TE>   "If the pins fall, they reset them," Swartley said. "No one freaks
out about earthquakes--this is California."</TE>
<TE>   Those who weren't around during the 1994 quake tended to be more
concerned, including a student who started crying at Tessa Niega's
sorority meeting Monday night when the first aftershock hit.</TE>
<TE>   "But she's from, like, Minnesota, so she doesn't know better,"
said Niega, 24.</TE>
<TE>   Some native Southern Californians developed earthquake phobias
after the 1994 shaker, including Yoseya Taylor, now 18, who said she
ran under a closet doorway when the ground shook Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   "I was freaked the heck out," said Taylor, who lives in a Cal
State Northridge dorm. "I've been in earthquakes in L.A. Those are
nothing. Earthquakes in Northridge are scarier."</TE>

<HD>Rocketdyne Official Denies Cover-Up Attempt</HD>
<DH>Court: The Santa Susana Field Lab manager testifies in his
defense that the 1994 explosion that killed two scientists occurred
during legitimate testing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A retired Rocketdyne manager on Wednesday denied approving phony
tests to cover up illegal waste burnings at the Santa Susana Field
Laboratory near Chatsworth, where two scientists were killed in a
1994 explosion.</LD>
<LD>   Joseph E. Flanagan, one of two former Rocketdyne employees on
trial in Riverside, testified in his defense. He is charged with
federal environmental crimes and could be sentenced to prison if
convicted.</LD>
<LD>   For three months, Flanagan, 61, has listened to the case against
him. He told jurors Wednesday that he had waited seven years to
testify.</LD>
<TE>   Flanagan, the former director of Rocketdyne's Chemical Technology
Group, and Edgar R. Wilson, 65, a lab technician and former sheriff's
deputy, are charged with two felony counts of illegally burning
chemical waste. Flanagan also is charged with illegally storing the
materials.</TE>
<TE>   Blast Killed Physicist, Chemical Engineer</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. William Carter has alleged that five men,
including Wilson, were burning waste without a permit at the field
laboratory on July 26, 1994, when an explosion occurred.</TE>
<TE>   The blast killed chemical engineer Otto K. Heiney, 53, of Canoga
Park and physicist Larry A. Pugh, 51, of Thousand Oaks. Both men
reported directly to Flanagan, who was not at the lab when the
explosion occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Carter alleged that Flanagan authorized the illegal burns. But
Flanagan and Wilson have insisted the burns were part of legitimate
scientific research.</TE>
<TE>   To win a conviction, the prosecution must prove that the men knew
they were breaking the law.</TE>
<TE>   No 'Phony Testing,' Defendant Testifies</TE>
<TE>   Attorney John D. Vandevelde wasted no time Wednesday in getting to
the essence of his client's defense. Vandevelde asked Flanagan if he
directed, approved or planned any "phony testing."</TE>
<TE>   "No, I did not," Flanagan answered.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you direct, approve or plan any kind of illegal storage?"</TE>
<TE>   "Not of any kind."</TE>
<TE>   The defense portrayed Flanagan as a family man and loyal
Rocketdyne employee who is respected in the international scientific
community.</TE>
<TE>   Flanagan said he grew up in Hollywood and married his high school
sweetheart. They raised three daughters in Woodland Hills and moved
to Stanwood, Wash., after Flanagan left Rocketdyne.</TE>
<TE>   Flanagan went to work for Rocketdyne in 1962 after graduating from
college and later earned a master's degree and doctorate in chemical
engineering. He retired in January 1996.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving Rocketdyne, Flanagan said he began a consulting
company and continued to work on government contracts, even after his
1999 indictment.</TE>
<TE>   He said he left Rocketdyne on good terms. He showed jurors a
receipt for a $133,000 bonus paid to him in 1997 by the Chicago-based
Boeing Co., which bought Rocketdyne in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Defendant Worked on Secret Projects</TE>
<TE>   To show jurors that Flanagan's group worked on a range of
research, Vandevelde questioned him about top-secret government work.</TE>
<TE>   For those projects, Flanagan said, he had a special phone at work
that scrambled voices and required a key to activate.</TE>
<TE>   He said he also traveled to Russia at least 14 times to try to
sell that nation's leaders Rocketdyne technology to dispose of
chemical and biological agents stored there since the Cold War.</TE>

<HD>L.A. County Labor Federation Joins the Opposition to
Secession</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mayor James K. Hahn gained a major ally in his battle against
secession when a panel of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor,
AFL-CIO, announced Wednesday it will oppose efforts in the San
Fernando Valley, Hollywood and the harbor area to break away from Los
Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The federation's Committee on Political Education, with about 100
members, voted unanimously to oppose secession. The federation is an
umbrella group for unions representing 800,000 workers.</LD>
<LD>   "If any of these areas secede from Los Angeles, the city of Los
Angeles will have less clout in Sacramento and Washington," said
Miguel Contreras, executive secretary-treasurer of the federation. He
said he's concerned thousands of city workers could lose their jobs
if the new cities adopt pared-down government structures.</LD>
<TE>   Richard Close, chairman of the secession group Valley VOTE,
downplayed the significance of the federation's position, saying it
is based on mistaken information.</TE>

<HD>Students Leap at Opportunity to Perform Ballet</HD>
<DH>Culture: Channel Islands troupe brings the dance to Oxnard
schools. Youngsters will team up with the professionals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Looking at him in his scruffy T-shirt, sweatpants and tennis shoes,
you would never guess that Glovani Hernandez loves to dance.</LD>
<LD>   Four months ago, the chubby-cheeked 8-year-old didn't really know
it, either. Living in the La Colonia neighborhood of Oxnard, the
extent of his creative movement had been lunging for a basketball on
the Ramona Elementary School playground.</LD>
<LD>   But then, they brought ballet to the barrio.</LD>
<TE>   Last week, the shy third-grader, arms outstretched at his sides,
swooped and swirled. He stomped his feet, slapped his hands and moved
to a tribal beat.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes me feel happy," Glovani said, after rehearsing a dance
piece created by the Camarillo-based Channel Islands Ballet.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, he and about 320 other youngsters from Ramona and
Driffill elementary schools will give a public performance of
"Breezes of the Sea: A Multicultural Dance Adventure" at the Oxnard
Performing Arts Center.</TE>
<TE>   The production culminates weeks of training at each school as part
of Arts for Youth, an outreach program of the ballet company. Begun
more than a decade ago, the program has expanded to include a student
performance this year, thanks to a $48,800 state grant.</TE>
<TE>   "These kids are learning what being an artist is and that there
are possibilities out there for them to perform," said Yves de
Bouteiller, the ballet company's choreographer. "By dancing, they
also gain self-confidence. There is a discovery that they can
actually do this sort of thing."</TE>
<TE>   Ashley Villavicencio, 8, said working with the dancers who visit
Ramona has strengthened her dreams of becoming a ballerina.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was 3 years old I knew I wanted to do the ballet," she
said. "I like how they stretch."</TE>
<TE>   Bouteiller has worked with teachers in each grade level at both
schools to tie the content of the dance piece he and the dancers
created to lessons the children are learning in language arts,
science and social studies.</TE>
<TE>   First-graders learning about the difference between fact and
fiction play mermaids and mermen. Sixth-graders studying ancient
civilizations dance as Greek gods. Second-graders learning about
ocean life become fish in the production.</TE>
<TE>   And at Ramona last week, Bouteiller and two of the company's
professional ballerinas helped two third-grade classes practice a
dance interpretation of a famous Chumash Indian tale.</TE>
<TE>   The story goes that Hutash, the Earth goddess, created their
people from seeds she made from a magic plant on Santa Cruz Island.
As the people thrive and the island becomes too crowded, she decides
to make a rainbow bridge that many can cross to the mainland.</TE>
<TE>   But some of the tribe looked down as they were crossing, became
dizzy and fell. Before they hit the ocean, Hutash turned them into
dolphins so they would not drown.</TE>
<TE>   During a dress rehearsal at the performing arts center Wednesday,
Bouteiller watched as the story came to life.</TE>
<TE>   Dancing alongside the children, who wore colorful homemade
costumes, were professionals from the ballet company.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very impressed," Bouteiller told the students before
practicing the grand finale. "You guys did a wonderful job."</TE>
<TE>   Integrating the performing arts into the elementary schools has
become increasingly crucial, as budget cuts over the years have all
but eliminated art and music programs in many schools statewide,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Channel Islands Ballet Company launched the program in
1991 with a ballet demonstration for 1,200 students, it has expanded
it and now offers annual performances for schoolchildren, classroom
visits and training for young ballerinas.</TE>
<TE>   "This has given us an opportunity to make the arts a vehicle for
learning," said Eva Leckman, an Oxnard Elementary School District
administrator who has helped coordinate this year's production. "It
really is so exciting for these students."</TE>
<TE>   Kathleen Dwyer, a new member of the ballet company, said she has
been impressed with the students' grasp of the choreography.</TE>
<TE>   "They're incredible," she said. "Some of the sixth-grade boys were
so shy at first. But now you can see it in their faces, they know
they've accomplished something."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FYI</TE>

<TE>   The Channel Islands Ballet Company Arts for Youth program will
perform "Breezes of the Sea: A Multicultural Dance Adventure" at 7
p.m. in the Oxnard Performing Arts Center, 800 Hobson Way. Tickets
are $5 and can be purchased at the door. For more information, call

<HD>Murder Suspect to Be Tried as Juvenile</HD>
<DH>Court: Prosecutors drop attempt to have 14-year-old charged
as an adult with three others in homeless man's beating death.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 14-year-old Ventura boy charged with murder in the beating death of
a homeless man will not be tried as an adult.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County prosecutors told a judge Wednesday they are
abandoning an earlier push to move the case to adult court, where
Rocky Mattley would have faced tougher penalties if convicted.</LD>
<LD>   The youth is one of four teens accused of kicking and throwing
stones at homeless veteran James Clark, 58, as he lay in his sleeping
bag at a Ventura River encampment.</LD>
<TE>   "It is the right thing to do for many reasons," Senior Deputy
Dist. Atty. Maeve Fox said. "I believe the juvenile system works in
certain cases and I think Rocky is the kind of kid who should be
dealt with in Juvenile Court."</TE>
<TE>   Fox said prosecutors considered the defendant's age, family
background and his level of participation in the crime before
reaching the decision.</TE>
<TE>   She also said the youth's defense lawyers provided some
information that tended to mitigate his role in the slaying.</TE>
<TE>   "We took a long hard look at him as a human being, and not every
juvenile should be prosecuted in adult court," Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Public Defender Howard Asher praised prosecutors for their
decision to let the case remain in Juvenile Court. He declined to
comment further on the case.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted of murder in a juvenile proceeding, Mattley could be
held in state custody until his 25th birthday.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura residents Timothy Becker, 18, Robert Coffman and
Christopher Dunham, both 19, each faces robbery and murder
charges--and potential life sentences--for his alleged role in
Clark's killing on June 29.</TE>
<TE>   Becker, Coffman and Dunham are scheduled to appear in Ventura
County Superior Court today for a preliminary hearing.</TE>
<TE>   The court hearing, however, is expected to be postponed because
the county medical examiner, who was expected to testify, will not be
available.</TE>
<TE>   Clark was killed at his encampment next to the Ventura River. He
had lived on the streets for two decades.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say the teens were partying near the beach when they
came upon Clark and stole some of his belongings.</TE>
<TE>   Later, authorities say, the teens pelted Clark with rocks and
kicked him repeatedly in the head as he lay in his sleeping bag.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities suspect the slaying was done for fun.</TE>
<TE>   The teenagers each face 25 years to life in prison if convicted of
murder and two to six years in prison if found guilty of robbery.
They have denied the charges.</TE>

<HD>Delgadillo Urges Enlisting State in Billboard Fight</HD>
<DH>Advertising: The city attorney calls on the council to rid
L.A.'s 'most visually blighted areas' of the signs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his strongest call yet for greater restrictions on billboards, Los
Angeles City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo on Wednesday urged council
members to take action to remove the giant signs in the city's "most
visually blighted areas."</LD>
<LD>   Delgadillo suggested that the City Council work with state
legislators to change a California law that limits cities' abilities
to take down the signs.</LD>
<LD>   "We think it's high time the state Legislature abolish its
preferential treatment of the billboard industry and give back to the
cities our vital regulatory capabilities," Delgadillo said.</LD>
<TE>   Since his election last year with the strong support of the
billboard industry, Delgadillo has taken steps to limit the signs in
Los Angeles. He sought to assure council members Wednesday that
removing billboard clutter from neighborhoods is one of his top
priorities.</TE>
<TE>   "We can realize the day when all the neighborhoods and communities
are free from the blight of billboards," Delgadillo said.</TE>
<TE>   Several council members agreed, suggesting that not only should
the city lawmakers urge the Los Angeles contingent of legislators to
propose change but should also visit Sacramento to personally lobby
for new laws.</TE>
<TE>   Council members also signaled their support Wednesday for an
ordinance--proposed by Councilman Jack Weiss--that would require
billboard companies to pay an annual fee to have their signs
certified. The objective, Weiss said, is to identify illegal
billboards and force companies to remove them.</TE>
<TE>   Although the measure did not receive the required 12 votes
necessary to pass on Wednesday, it is expected to receive approval
next week.</TE>
<TE>   The council also moved several proposed billboard regulations to
its Planning Committee for consideration. One measure calls for a ban
on new billboard construction, and another seeks to allow companies
to build signs along freeways in exchange for the removal of existing
billboards in neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Hal Bernson told council members that his staff is
compiling a list of billboards in his district. Bernson said he will
ask the city's Building and Safety Department to tear down any signs
found to be illegal.</TE>
<TE>   Although there is a growing consensus among council members to
exert greater control over billboards, the industry's top lobbyist
sent a letter to the board urging them to seek a compromise with
companies instead of issuing a ban.</TE>
<TE>   "Large and medium-size businesses are the primary clients of the
outdoor advertising industry," lobbyist Ken Spiker Jr. told council.</TE>
<TE>   "The hundreds of legitimate businesses that advertise are
responsible for a substantial portion of the sales tax generated in
the Southern California area and indirectly support thousands of
Southern California jobs."</TE>

<HD>$100-Million Restoration of Bolsa Chica OKd</HD>
<DH>Environment: Lands panel signs off on the most expensive
wetlands project in state history. Mesa fight continues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California State Lands Commission quickly and unanimously
approved a $100-million plan to restore the Bolsa Chica wetlands
Wednesday, even as a judge allowed a landowner's lawsuit to go
forward on a development proposed for the bluffs above the marsh.</LD>
<LD>   The decisions Wednesday provided the latest twists in the
three-decade-long tale of Bolsa Chica, once a flourishing coastal
marsh that was cut off from the ocean a century ago by duck hunters
and later contaminated by oil fields. Still, Bolsa Chica--meaning
"Little Pocket" in Spanish--is the largest remaining wetlands complex
in Southern California and a key stopover for migratory birds.</LD>
<LD>   The restoration plan--approved on a 3-0 vote by the State Lands
Commission--aims to turn the 1,200-acre coastal expanse of polluted
salt marshes, mudflats, pools and oil rigs into a flourishing
ecosystem. The plan, the most expensive wetlands restoration in state
history, calls for cutting a 360-foot-wide channel through five acres
of sandy beach that lie between the ocean and the wetlands, and
building a traffic bridge over the channel. The resulting infusion of
seawater and tidal circulation is expected to restore wildlife
habitat and help several species of imperiled birds and fish.</LD>
<TE>   "It took five years of hard work to acquire the land and design a
restoration project that would meet environmental goals and satisfy
the local community," state Controller and commission Chairwoman
Kathleen Connell said in a written statement.</TE>
<TE>   The plan still needs nods from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Santa Ana Regional Water
Quality Control Board--all expected to be easily gained. Restoration
work is expected to begin in 2003 and to take about three years.</TE>
<TE>   However, the fate of the two-tier mesa remains at the center of an
ongoing dispute.</TE>
<TE>   A San Diego County Superior Court judge reversed herself, deciding
to allow a lawsuit by developer Hearthside Homes and landowner Signal
Landmark against the California Coastal Commission go forward.</TE>
<TE>   The sister companies claim that the commission illegally "took"
the property by so severely restricting what could be built that
development was no longer economically feasible.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Sheridan E. Reed had issued a tentative ruling in August
that tossed out many of Hearthside's and Signal's claims, saying they
had been decided in previous litigation and that the plaintiffs had
not proved the commission acted improperly.</TE>
<TE>   However, in Wednesday's ruling, she said these issues were open to
debate.</TE>
<TE>   "We're pleased with" Reed's ruling, said Hearthside and Signal
attorney Michael Berger. "It means that our case against the
commission will go to trial."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Douglas, the Coastal Commission's executive director, said
the ruling was rife with factual errors. "I'm really puzzled by this,
but our attorneys are going to have to spend time and the court is
going to have to spend time dealing with issues that seem to me to be
pretty clear-cut."</TE>

<HD>Documents Seized From O.C. Official</HD>
<DH>Probe: D.A. steps up investigation of a Seal Beach
councilman whose votes benefited a business associate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investigators served search warrants Wednesday on Seal Beach
Councilman Shawn Boyd as part of probe into conflict-of-interest
allegations involving Boyd and a business associate.</LD>
<LD>   A dozen investigators retrieved documents from Boyd's Seal Beach
home and an apartment where he has been staying. The Orange County
district attorney's office confirmed that the warrants were served on
"residences where Mr. Boyd is known to have stayed" in the last year,
spokeswoman Tori Richards said. She declined to elaborate.</LD>
<LD>   Boyd, who faces reelection in March, could not be reached for
comment. His attorney, Al Stokke, declined to comment.</LD>
<TE>   The district attorney's office has been investigating since
October whether Boyd violated state law by voting on the use of city
funds to buy a mobile-home park owned by Richard Hall, for whom Boyd
was working on at least two other real-estate ventures.</TE>
<TE>   Hall bought the Seal Beach Trailer Park in December 1998 for $3.5
million. Two years later, Hall sold it to a nonprofit group for $7.4
million, backed by city financing.</TE>
<TE>   The Times reported last year that Boyd voted seven times and
abstained four times on park matters without disclosing his work for
Hall. He said he didn't reveal the relationship, or abstain from
voting, because he hadn't been paid yet by Hall and didn't consider
the votes to be a conflict.</TE>
<TE>   State law bars elected officials who receive $500 or more in
income within the previous year from voting or influencing decisions
on matters that could financially benefit the giver. The prohibition
includes money paid to or formally promised to officials.</TE>
<TE>   Complaints against Boyd were lodged with the district attorney's
office and the state Fair Political Practices Commission in September
by a Seal Beach resident. The FPPC has been cooperating with the
district attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Boyd Worked With Hall on Real Estate Projects</TE>
<TE>   In an interview late last year, Boyd said he had an oral agreement
to be paid $12,000 for acting as Hall's agent on a Castaic
mobile-home park project, and that he also expected to be paid $4,000
from an aborted apartment project in Anaheim. He acted as Hall's
developer for the Anaheim project.</TE>
<TE>   But he said he believed that he had complied with state law in his
votes. "It's the right of every citizen to raise this question if
they want," he said about the complaints. "I guess I would be
[nervous] if I had something to hide, but I don't."</TE>
<TE>   Boyd is up for reelection March 5. He has three challengers for
the four-year term in the 1st District council seat: retired
accountant Walt Miller, county planner Charles Antos and relocation
consultant Beverly S. Pearce. Two other council incumbents are
running unopposed.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation is the second by Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas'
office into conflict-of-interest allegations involving local elected
officials.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, former Huntington Beach Councilman Dave
Garofalo pleaded guilty to one felony and 15 misdemeanors for
violating state laws that prohibit officials from voting on matters
involving sources of income.</TE>
<TE>   Garofalo, who resigned from office in December, admitted
soliciting thousands of dollars from advertisers to his publishing
business while voting as many as 300 times on matters affecting the
advertisers. The probe into his financial dealings took about 18
months.</TE>

<HD>City's  Budget Gap to Affect Services</HD>
<DH>Government: Officials predict a $250-million shortfall, due
in part to a drop in tourism. Hahn vows to protect public safety, but
parks, streets and libraries may suffer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD  and TINA DAUNT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles is facing a $250-million shortfall in next year's budget,
city officials announced Wednesday as they moved to expand a freeze
on hiring workers and warned that some services may soon be
curtailed.</LD>
<LD>   A dramatic drop in projected city revenue--the result of a
drop-off in tourism, among other things--and a sharp increase in
expected costs for workers' compensation, police reform and other
programs means lawmakers must begin wrestling with how to pare back
the city's $3.6-billion operation.</LD>
<LD>   The budget problem may hobble Mayor James K. Hahn's efforts to
address some of his political priorities, notably his campaign to
quell separatist sentiments in the San Fernando Valley and other
parts of the city, in part by improving city services.</LD>
<TE>   In dollar terms, the shortfall estimates released Wednesday
represent a budget gap even larger than the one that confronted Los
Angeles in the recession of the early 1990s, when officials raised
fees, laid off workers and slashed money from departments.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know that there's any way to minimize it," Hahn said in
an interview. "Any way you characterize it, it's as bad as any budget
problem I've seen in my 20 years in office.</TE>
<TE>   "We will be able to keep the city government functioning, but
maybe not at the same level and the same way in every department,"
the mayor added. "We're going to try to cut to our core mission."</TE>
<TE>   In a memo distributed Wednesday, the mayor asked department heads
to give him proposals for consolidating or suspending all but their
highest-priority programs. In addition, Hahn expanded a hiring freeze
he imposed in October to include civilians in the police and fire
departments and temporary employees.</TE>
<TE>   Police officers, firefighters and sanitation workers are the only
ones exempted from the freeze.</TE>
<TE>   A dismayed councilman said the severity of the shortfall means
every city service must be reexamined.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't single out any one service that's going to be cut," said
Councilman Nick Pacheco, chairman of the Budget Committee.
"Everything but major public safety and public health [programs] is
open for discussion."</TE>
<TE>   Pacheco said residents may see the cuts in reduced library hours,
longer lines for permits or delays in public works projects.</TE>
<TE>   "We're moving aggressively to save people's jobs," Pacheco said.
But he added, "$250 million is a very serious number."</TE>
<TE>   Pacheco and Councilman Dennis Zine have proposed a stricter
version of the hiring freeze, one that could be changed only by
further council action. The City Council will consider that motion
next week.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn would not specify what services are being considered for
cutbacks, saying he wants to wait to hear from his department heads.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we need to provide public safety, to keep fire, police
and paramedic services," Hahn said. "What we're hoping to do is find
cost savings in other places."</TE>
<TE>   Julie Butcher, general manager of the city employees union, said
city workers will try their best to do more with less.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to do everything we can to make sure folks get
services they deserve and are paying for," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But she added that the hiring freeze will hamstring efforts to fix
more potholes, trim more trees and improve other basic services.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest place we need people is in the parks, where we have
150 vacancies for gardeners," Butcher said. "And unfortunately, you
see it when you look at the parks. We can't keep up with mowing the
lawns, keeping the bathrooms clean."</TE>
<TE>   Department heads, who must give the mayor their reduction
proposals by Monday, tried to remain optimistic even as they looked
for services to trim.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll take a look to see what cuts hurt the public the least,"
said Susan Kent, who heads the city's $96-million library system. "I
would expect both the mayor and the City Council will have to
struggle with these cuts, as we all will."</TE>
<TE>   The anticipated shortfall in next year's budget comes even as city
officials are struggling with a gap in the current year's spending
plan. The fiscal year ends June 30, and officials are already dipping
into the city's surplus.</TE>
<TE>   "We get through this year by the skin of our teeth, but I think we
start off next year with nothing in our reserves," the mayor said.
"What we're faced with is not saving money fast enough."</TE>
<TE>   Because of that, the city does not have a cushion to help absorb
the projected $250-million gap in next year's budget.</TE>
<TE>   The shortfall is a result of a $150-million projected drop in tax
revenue, along with a $100-million increase in the cost of workers'
compensation, health care and implementing the federal consent decree
for reform of the Los Angeles Police Department, said Deputy Mayor
Matt Middlebrook.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn added that a large share of the increased costs come from
multiyear contracts with employees with built-in pay increases.</TE>
<TE>   The shortfall projected for next year's budget does not include an
estimate of the city's increased security costs.</TE>
<TE>   The tab for police overtime and other security measures taken
since the September terrorist attacks is expected to be at least $45
million by June.</TE>
<TE>   One option that city officials do not have is running a deficit.
Unlike the federal government, Los Angeles is required to balance its
budget every year.</TE>
<TE>   "Last night, the president said in the State of the Union, 'Well,
there may be a deficit,'" Hahn said. "I can't be that cavalier as a
mayor."</TE>

<HD>A Comment Davis Won't Let Riordan Forget</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>George Skelton</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis is all over TV with an ad blistering Richard
Riordan about abortion, and political junkies are asking why. Why
attack so soon when the November election is still eight months away?</LD>
<LD>   Davis has many reasons, including the fact that hitting Riordan on
abortion is plain irresistible.</LD>
<TE>   The former L.A. mayor is campaigning for governor as an
enlightened Republican who favors abortion rights. "I'm pro-choice,"
he says repeatedly. "I strongly support the right of women to make
their own decision with respect to their bodies."</TE>
<TE>   The GOP "will turn from an endangered species into an extinct
species," he asserts, unless it becomes "inclusive" and accepts
people of wide-ranging views--including the majority who support
abortion rights.</TE>
<TE>   So with this backdrop, it's easy to understand why Davis couldn't
resist smacking Riordan after he watched an old TV interview of
Riordan calling abortion "murder."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan did the interview for a Westside cable station in the
spring of '91, two years before he ran for mayor. The megabucks
businessman and civic activist was asked by interviewer Lauren
Steiner whether he had any quarrel with his Catholic Church. He
disagreed with the church's "socialistic" views on economics, Riordan
said.</TE>
<TE>   But he added: "Abortion and things like that, I agree with the
church. Abortion, I agree very strongly. In fact, being fairly
liberal-minded, I surprise myself at my emotions on the abortion
issue because I feel very--I think it's murder."</TE>
<TE>   Davis' campaign advisors showed that tape to focus groups. "I've
never seen a clip of someone as devastating," says chief strategist
Garry South. "What kills people is when he says, 'I'm fairly
liberal-minded,' but agrees with the church that abortion is murder.</TE>
<TE>   "When women see this, they say, 'If he were conservative and had
come around, I could accept this.'"</TE>
<TE>   That tape isn't running in the current TV ad. But you can bet it
will in some future Davis spot.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The current commercial points out that Riordan has contributed
many thousands of dollars to "pro-life" candidates who oppose
abortion rights. He raised $500,000 in a failed attempt to win Senate
confirmation of antiabortion Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork in
1987. He also donated to other antiabortion groups before he was
mayor.</TE>
<TE>   "You can go back over somebody's life and prove anything you
want," Riordan told reporters Monday.</TE>
<TE>   That's the start of a response, but Riordan needs to be more
upfront. And about the worst possible answer is the one he gave
reporters Monday, which essentially was: Californians needn't concern
themselves with this, because L.A. voters already have decided it's
irrelevant.</TE>
<TE>   "That issue was in front of the voters when I was elected mayor,"
he protested. "All the voters had those facts.... They believed me,
they trusted me.... They knew I was pro-choice."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor, here's a little political primer: The impact of L.A. city
voters on your political aspirations has dramatically diminished.
They account for only 10% of the state's registered voters; indeed
only 6% of the Republican voters.</TE>
<TE>   And the other 90%--or 94%--have not as yet delegated Angelenos to
make decisions for them.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If you're Davis and South, you don't sit on these gift weapons.
You use them while they're potent, before Riordan can weaken their
effectiveness by publicly explaining himself.</TE>
<TE>   And while you're at it, you also let fly other ads--attacking
Riordan about rising L.A. crime and gouging the state on energy.</TE>
<TE>   Why now? If you're Davis, you've:</TE>
<TE>   * Given up on anybody beating Riordan in the Republican primary.
You've got to slow your opponent's momentum and undermine his general
election support among moderates, the voter base you covet. It
matters little that you help Riordan with GOP conservatives by making
him more acceptable on abortion.</TE>
<TE>   * Offered the other GOP candidates a way to attack Riordan's
credibility, if they're smart enough to see it. Just steal from your
ad: "Where does Richard Riordan really stand.... Is this a record we
can trust?"</TE>
<TE>   * Made sure abortion is an issue, after all. It's a powerful
Democratic weapon in California. Riordan can't neutralize it merely
by being pro-choice.</TE>
<TE>   * Sent this message to voters: You may not especially like me, but
the other guy is goofy.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, Davis and Riordan are running even, according to the
Times Poll.</TE>
<TE>   For Riordan not to fall back, he'll need to explain why he
believes abortion is murder, but still should be legal. This
shouldn't be that hard. It's about religious beliefs and individual
choice. Inclusion.</TE>
<TE>   But all those donations to right-to-lifers? That may require a
political mea culpa.</TE>

<HD>Officer Kills Alleged Carjacker</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An off-duty Baldwin Park police officer shot and killed one of two
men who were allegedly trying to carjack his vehicle late Tuesday at
a Pico Rivera service station. The second man was wounded.</LD>
<LD>   David Montanez, 36, of Pico Rivera was pronounced dead at the
scene, said coroner's spokesman Scott Carrier. Neither the wounded
man nor the 26-year-old officer, who was not in uniform at the time,
was identified.</LD>
<LD>   Dieter C. Dammeier, an Upland attorney who represents the Baldwin
Park Police Officers Assn., said the officer was pumping gas into his
Ford truck at a Mobil station at Beverly and Rosemead boulevards
about 10:25 p.m. Tuesday when he was accosted by two men.</LD>
<TE>   "He was willing to give up his truck and leave," Dammeier said.
"He grabbed a gun out of his truck and ran across the street. But
they chased him, knocked him down and kicked him in the head. That's
when he decided he'd better defend himself, and he opened fire."</TE>
<TE>   Dammeier said it was unclear whether the officer's assailants were
themselves armed, but one of them tried to grab the officer's gun.
Dammeier said the officer had identified himself to them as a
policeman.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, it's a tragedy that the officer had to take this
action, but he had no choice," Dammeier said. "The carjackers forced
his hand."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies, who were called to the
scene after the shooting, were investigating the matter, sheriff's
Sgt. Joe Efflandt said. He said the assailants were shot several
times in their upper bodies.</TE>

<HD>A Degree of Success for Growers</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: Ventura County ranchers use orchard heaters
and wind machines to protect their crops against the freeze.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County growers scrambled early Wednesday to beat back a
bone-chilling freeze, firing up orchard heaters, wind machines and
even helicopters in all-night battles to protect their crops.</LD>
<LD>   Minor damage was reported in some of the coldest pockets of the
county. But most growers escaped serious problems as predictions of
the lowest temperatures in years--as low as 23 degrees in the
citrus-rich Ojai Valley--never came to pass.</LD>
<LD>   Frost protection efforts, which have forced growers to operate on
little sleep since the start of the week, were aided by winds that
prevented temperatures from plummeting as expected.</LD>
<TE>   Agricultural officials were hoping that light winds would prevail
through this morning to again stave off the threat to crops.</TE>
<TE>   "We dodged a bullet, no question about it," said Earl McPhail, the
county's agricultural commissioner. "Everybody I know came through
this real well."</TE>
<TE>   That isn't to say it was easy.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Paula citrus and avocado rancher Bob Pinkerton had spent
Tuesday afternoon running sprinklers in his groves, a
frost-protection measure that can raise the temperature by as much as
4 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Later, after only a few hours of sleep, he was up at 10 p.m.,
responding to an alarm that warned that the temperature had dropped
to 34 degrees in his orchard. He fired up his 15 wind machines to
circulate warmer air hovering closer to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "When that alarm rings, you go," Pinkerton said. "There's no
pulling the covers back over your head."</TE>
<TE>   Pinkerton was working all night. As the wind machines buzzed
overhead, sounding like a squadron of helicopters, the veteran
rancher monitored thermometers staked throughout his orchard.</TE>
<TE>   The temperature would have had to drop to 28 degrees or below for
at least a couple of hours to cause significant crop damage,
Pinkerton said.</TE>
<TE>   By 5 a.m., temperatures were still below freezing as Pinkerton
bumped along the rutted dirt roads that slice through his ranch. But
it only dropped to 28 degrees once during the night, and then for
less than half an hour.</TE>
<TE>   By sunrise Wednesday, he was prepared to declare victory, at least
for the night.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we won," he said. "On a night like this, when you expect
the worst, you throw everything you've got at it. There's not much
else you can do."</TE>
<TE>   Like many growers, Pinkerton carries crop insurance to guard
against significant damage. And if the cold wreaks widespread havoc,
there is always the possibility that the government will offer
assistance. That is what happened the last time a winter freeze
damaged Ventura County's crops.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of a 1998 cold snap that caused $74.3 million damage
to the citrus and avocado industries, the county was declared a
federal disaster area, opening the door for farmers who sustained
heavy losses to apply for low-interest loans.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing close to that has happened this winter.</TE>
<TE>   In some areas, growers reported minor frost burn on leaves and
damage to new growth. And they were trying Wednesday morning to make
sure it didn't get any worse.</TE>
<TE>   At the Santa Paula-based Limoneira Co., the county's largest
farming enterprise, Chris Taylor, senior vice president of farming,
said workers fired up orchard heaters for the first time in years to
stave off the chill.</TE>
<TE>   And farm manager Don Reeder, who oversees production of 3,000
acres of avocados and citrus in the county, brought in helicopters to
accomplish the same mission.</TE>
<TE>   "Depending on where you were standing, it wasn't as cold as it
could have been," said Reeder, adding that the temperature in
Moorpark dropped to 27 degrees for a short time. "All in all, it
could have been a lot worse."</TE>
<TE>   For a while, Ojai avocado and tangerine grower Jim Churchill
thought it would be worse. After learning that the forecast called
for 23-degree temperatures, he spent much of Tuesday picking as many
avocados as possible before the cold could get them.</TE>
<TE>   In half an hour Tuesday night, the temperature at his ranch
plunged from 37 degrees to 33. Then the wind picked up, raising
temperatures to the high 30s until about 3 a.m. The temperature
dropped again, to 26 degrees for a short time in one area, but the
threat had diminished by then.</TE>
<TE>   "If the wind hadn't come down, we would have been toast," he said.
"We were incredibly lucky."</TE>

<HD>Cal State Ouster Rate Rises Slightly</HD>
<DH>Education: Nearly 7% of the freshman class fails to master
basic English and math. The university began dropping unprepared
students three years ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA TROUNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California State University system has kicked out more than 2,200
students--nearly 7% of last year's freshman class--for failing to
master basic English and math skills within a year of enrollment.</LD>
<LD>   This and other evidence of the Cal State system's continuing
effort to crack down on unprepared students was released Wednesday in
an annual report on remedial education to the system's board of
trustees.</LD>
<LD>   The proportion of students ousted at the end of the freshman year
is just slightly higher than in the two previous years. The
university began dropping students it deemed unprepared three years
ago.</LD>
<TE>   Students' lack of preparation shows as well in the number of
incoming freshmen who this year failed proficiency tests and were
required to take remedial math and English composition courses.
Forty-six percent of those who enrolled in the fall needed at least
one remedial class in math, and the same proportion needed help in
basic English composition skills. The figures were similar to the
previous year's.</TE>
<TE>   Cal State officials said they were disappointed, noting
particularly that they had hoped to see more improvement in math
skills, which had been rising in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   The level of English skills among incoming freshmen has remained
constant for the last three years, Spence said, with only 54%
demonstrating proficiency.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the lack of improvement, university officials said they
believed that some of their efforts to boost student proficiency
would ultimately pay off, and they urged trustees to continue to
support the reform efforts launched by the university in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "While we have not yet achieved the trustees' goals, it was
acknowledged from the beginning that these were ambitious goals,"
said David Spence, vice chancellor of the university system, who
presented the report.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to stay the course. We really believe that within two to
three years, we will see more results, better results," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the policy adopted by trustees six years ago, the 22-campus
system was directed to reduce remedial education to no more than 10%
of Cal State freshmen by 2007. Even as it tries to ease out remedial
education, the university system has been working to help high school
juniors and seniors boost their skills before they reach college.</TE>
<TE>   One part of the policy was to get tough on Cal State students who
arrive on campus unprepared to do the required university-level work.</TE>
<TE>   So, as classes ended last spring, the university notified 2,277
students throughout the system that, because they had not passed
their remedial classes, they could not re-enroll at the university
for their sophomore year. Instead, they were encouraged to go to a
community college to learn the skills needed to pass the exams in
math and English.</TE>
<TE>   Spence and other Cal State officials said enforcement of the
policy varies from campus to campus. But in general, they said, those
students who were kicked out had demonstrated little effort to
acquire the necessary skills, either failing to register for remedial
classes during their freshman year or rarely attending.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the university system is trying in a variety of
ways to persuade students to learn--and schools to teach--these
skills much earlier, well before entering college.</TE>
<TE>   Under a $9-million program, Cal State faculty members work closely
with 172 high schools around the state that historically send the
university system the greatest number of students needing remedial
help. Through this outreach program, now in its second year, the
university focuses on students likely to be admitted, to make sure
that those who need extra help are identified early and receive
remedial courses, if possible while they're still in high school.</TE>
<TE>   University officials said that there are no studies yet to show
the effectiveness of the program but that anecdotal evidence from the
participating high schools indicates significant improvement in
student skills.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope we'll see that [improvement] in the students who are
applying for college in the fall of 2002," said Allison Jones,
assistant vice chancellor for access and retention.</TE>
<TE>   The level of English skills has remained constant for three years,
Spence said. But Cal State now believes that it has identified the
problem and that the issue is not the writing skills of the tested
students, but their ability to read analytically. "What we found was
that students were really falling down on the reading part, with 78%
not passing," Spence said.</TE>
<TE>   As part of an existing program for high school teachers, he said,
the university has developed an institute for helping them learn to
better convey to their students the necessary skills in reading and
critical thinking.</TE>
<TE>   Spence also said Cal State has the highest placement standards of
any public university in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from taking the university's own placement tests when they
arrive, students can get out of remedial classes by scoring a minimum
of 550 on the math part and 550 on the verbal portion of the SAT.
Most other public universities set that standard at 500, he said,
with some even lower.</TE>

<HD>Legislature Cuts Budget by $2.2 Billion</HD>
<DH>Spending: Senate and Assembly seek to address $12.5-billion
shortfall. More difficult decisions lie ahead with the remaining
$10-billion imbalance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Lawmakers took a crucial step Wednesday toward erasing an anticipated
$12.5-billion budget shortfall by trimming nearly $2.2 billion from
California's current spending plan.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis proposed a series of reductions in November in
response to the state's growing fiscal woes. The more than 80
proposals cut or delay spending on everything from social services to
criminal justice, with education taking the biggest hit.</LD>
<LD>   Legislators altered the plan slightly earlier this week to reflect
some of their priorities, which include restoring discretionary
funding to schools, helping poor people with their energy bills and
providing planning money for an effort to bolster struggling schools.
In a show of bipartisan support, the package cleared the floor 40 to
0 in the Senate and 66 to 6 in the Assembly.</LD>
<TE>   "These are the types of reductions you have to make when the state
has been overspending for three years," said Senate Republican Leader
Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a long way to go," added state Sen. Steve Peace, the El
Cajon Democrat who heads the Senate Budget Committee. "This is the
easy part of the process."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's action set the stage for a much more difficult task
still facing legislators: agreeing on a way to close the remaining
$10 billion or more of the shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly Republicans put Democrats on notice that their support
will be harder to come by later this year unless serious efforts are
made to reduce government spending.</TE>
<TE>   They also used the occasion to criticize Democrats for failing to
cut the budget sooner and for allowing thousands of unfilled state
jobs to remain on the books.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe if you listen to the Republicans this year we won't be in
as much trouble next year," Assembly GOP Leader Dave Cox (R-Fair
Oaks) said.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Rod Pacheco (R-Riverside) added in a heated speech:
"You favored bureaucrats over crumbling schools."</TE>
<TE>   Rhetoric aside, the Davis administration welcomed the legislative
action, which officials said will enable the state to end the current
fiscal year with a positive balance. Davis is expected to sign a
series of bills adopting the reductions in several days.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe it's a historic action," said Sandy Harrison, a
spokesman for Davis' Department of Finance. "Current-year cuts of
this magnitude are unprecedented, which makes this a very significant
step toward getting a balanced budget implemented."</TE>
<TE>   A key issue dividing Republicans and Democrats is how the state
will erase the rest of the shortfall, which is expected to
materialize over the next 17 months. Republicans say they will oppose
any efforts to push expenses into future years.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to reducing spending by $5 billion, Davis wants to
free up $5.6 billion by borrowing against California's tobacco
settlement funds and deferring state contributions to pension funds
that serve public employees and teachers, among other proposals. The
governor is also counting on state legislators to sign off on nearly
$600 million in funding shifts.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Republicans took issue with a proposal Wednesday to shift
payment for a variety of capital projects from the general fund to
bonds.</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Ross Johnson (R-Irvine) said the plan would ''delay
tougher decisions until after our much-beloved and universally
admired governor stands for election in November.''</TE>
<TE>   Senate President Pro Tem John L. Burton (D-San Francisco) labeled
the GOP's criticism ''only the opening gambit of a long campaign''
against Davis and the Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Senate legislators voted 27 to 12 to approve the funding shift,
with only one Republican voting in favor of the plan.</TE>

<HD>Lottery's 34-Cent Gamble</HD>
<DH>Gaming: Officials create mail-in game to make amends to
those who bought Scratchers after top prizes were claimed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A crack at $1 million in prizes will cost Californians the price of a
postage stamp under a special one-time contest the California Lottery
will run in a bid to regain players' trust.</LD>
<LD>   Embarrassed by revelations in The Times in December that they had
allowed the sale of millions of dollars' worth of tickets for popular
Scratchers games even after all top prizes had been awarded,
California Lottery officials hope to make amends with a contest that
requires no ticket purchase.</LD>
<LD>   To enter, California residents must write their name, address,
phone number and age on a piece of paper and mail it to the Lottery.
Details about the contest will begin appearing at stores and gas
stations next week. Entries must be received by March 18. People can
enter as many times as they like.</LD>
<TE>   The 240 prizes range from $1,000 to $25,000. The $1 million in
prize money and the roughly $1-million cost of advertising and
setting up the contest will come from the Lottery's administrative
budget and not cut into the revenue the Lottery gives to public
schools, spokesman Vince Montane said.</TE>
<TE>   Theoretically, the one-time contest is open only to people who
have played Scratchers. Winners will be asked to sign a form stating
that they have purchased Scratchers tickets in the past. But Lottery
officials admit they have no way to verify such a claim.</TE>
<TE>   Republican candidate for governor Bill Jones argues that the
Lottery should offer 10 $100,000 Scratchers prizes and give away
tickets at stores.</TE>
<TE>   "What is the Lottery trying to hide behind the new game, the Big
Scam?" asked Jones spokesman Sean Walsh. "We have numerous Public
Records Act requests that still have not been complied with to see if
this fraud is occurring at a much deeper and broader level than the
Lottery has acknowledged."</TE>
<TE>   Lottery officials revealed that from 1996 to April 2001, 11 of 137
Scratchers games had been "active" after all the grand prizes had
been awarded, so that ticket purchasers had no chance of winning the
biggest prizes.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson said that since December, the California Lottery has begun
canceling Scratchers games as soon as only two big prizes are left.</TE>
<TE>   The most popular of the Lottery's games, Scratchers generate $1.2
billion of the Lottery's annual revenue of $2.6 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The address for entries to the free drawing is: Scratchers $1
Million Drawing, P.O. Box 5056, Lake Forest, CA 92609-9903</TE>

<HD>Drug Seizures Up at State Borders</HD>
<DH>Contraband: Haul of cocaine and heroin rises dramatically
in the last three months of 2001. Increased anti-terror efforts are
credited.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM OVEREND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cocaine and heroin seizures along California's coast and on the
border with Mexico have increased dramatically in recent months--a
sign to officials that the nation's war on terror may be benefiting
the war on drugs.</LD>
<LD>   Figures from October through December show 2,650 pounds of cocaine
seized by U.S. Customs Service agents on the Mexican border. That was
more than twice the 1,132 pounds seized during the same period the
previous year.</LD>
<LD>   An even larger increase was seen in heroin seizures at the state's
border crossing stations. Customs officers seized 197.5 pounds of
heroin during the three-month period, more than 20 times the 9.1
pounds for October-December of 2000.</LD>
<TE>   Officials said seizures by customs agents at ports and
international airports from San Francisco and Oakland to Los Angeles
also rose significantly. In the Bay Area, heroin confiscations more
than doubled and cocaine busts were more than 15 times higher than
the same period in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Though officials were cautious about interpreting too much from
three months of statistics, they said the numbers confirm a pattern
that first emerged in late November.</TE>
<TE>   The increases in drug seizures are related to anti-terrorism
operations along the border and at major ports and airports since
Sept. 11, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "Three months only gives us a snapshot of what may be going on,
but there is obviously a substantial impact from Sept. 11," said
Jayson Ahern, director of field operations for the Customs Service in
San Diego. "The seizures reflect the heightened state of alert at the
border since then."</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, customs officers
went on full alert, searching every car crossing the border. During
that time, officials say, drug seizures actually dropped to almost
nothing as smugglers delayed their usual shipments.</TE>
<TE>   Customs agents remain on full terrorist alert, but have modified
search practices slightly. Agents are generally much more aggressive
in questioning border crossers, but smugglers may now believe there
is at least some chance of getting drugs into the country, officials
say.</TE>
<TE>   "We are searching more cars and searching more people," Ahern
said. "We are also doing much more intense inspections, taking more
time to focus on people and their documents. One of the results has
been that we are finding more drugs."</TE>
<TE>   The increased seizures in California have been matched by similar
increases at ports of entry throughout the nation, customs officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Heightened security against terrorism has clearly benefited our
overall efforts to defend our nation from drug smugglers," said
Customs Commissioner Robert C. Bonner, who will tour customs
facilities in San Diego today.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide heroin seizures were up 135% in the last three months
of 2001 compared with the previous year, said officials in
Washington. Cocaine seizures by customs nationally increased from
45,665 to 71,209 pounds. And marijuana seizures from October to
December showed a 19% increase.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Fleming, a customs spokesman for the region extending from
Orange County to the northern tip of California, said the increased
seizures reflect more aggressive searches at major seaports and
airports as well as along the border.</TE>
<TE>   "Our highest priority is anti-terrorism, and we have been on
full-alert status now for several months," he said. "Agents are
working more hours and they are conducting more examinations. The
more you look, the more you find."</TE>

<HD>City Plans to Go After Valley Gang With Injunction</HD>
<DH>Crime: Delgadillo will seek a court order to curb the
activities of the Canoga Park Alabama group in a nearly
five-square-mile 'safety zone.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo said Wednesday that he will
seek a court injunction against a west San Fernando Valley gang that
has been on the streets for 70 years.</LD>
<LD>   The injunction, which must be approved by a Los Angeles Superior
Court judge, would prohibit members of the Canoga Park Alabama gang
from associating with each other inside a 4.65-square-mile "safety
zone."</LD>
<LD>   The public-nuisance suit against the gang also seeks to impose a
daily 10 p.m. curfew on its estimated 565 members, city prosecutors
said.</LD>
<TE>   "Some of the residents in these areas can't go out at night, and
it's difficult to lead normal lives where they live and own homes,"
Delgadillo said.</TE>
<TE>   "With this, we are trying to bring back some basic freedoms and
liberties to the residents of these neighborhoods, who have been
terrorized for generations," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-gang effort targets Canoga Park Alabama members operating
within the boundaries of Winnetka Boulevard to the east, Topanga
Canyon Boulevard to the west and Vanowen and Nordhoff streets to the
south and north.</TE>
<TE>   Targeting gang associations through the courts dates back to 1993,
when city and county authorities imposed restrictions on the Blythe
Street gang in Panorama City via a lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   A Canoga Park Alabama gang injunction would be the 11th in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County district attorney's office also has secured
anti-gang injunctions in Compton, Inglewood, Lennox, Long Beach,
Pasadena and Norwalk, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Gang injunctions have been widely embraced by municipal officials
because the court orders give police broad latitude to arrest gang
members for seemingly innocuous activities, such as loitering or
being in the presence of someone with a weapon or selling drugs.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Deputy Chief Ronald Bergman, commanding officer of the San
Fernando Valley Bureau, said he believes the injunctions are
effective because they target the most violent and active gangs.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at the injunctions that we have in the Valley, they
go after gangs that have been a major thorn in the side of police and
the community," Bergman said. "I think gang injunctions are just
another tool to deal with gang violence."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone is sold on injunctions. Pasadena Police Chief Bernard
Melekian said they can be an effective tool in curbing gang activity,
but they often work for only a limited time.</TE>
<TE>   "If, in fact, a community has lost control of the neighborhood,
it's a very effective tool in the short run," Melekian said of the
two injunctions in his city. "But if you don't address the underlying
issues--like prevention and intervention programs for kids in
gangs--you don't solve the problem."</TE>
<TE>   The injunctions have drawn the ire of the American Civil Liberties
Union, which considers the court orders unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   The group, which led an unsuccessful fight against the Blythe
Street gang injunction, says such policies push gang members into
other neighborhoods and do little to mitigate overall criminal
activity.</TE>
<TE>   But in the end, Delgadillo said, injunctions are not used
exclusive of other crime prevention tools. "The most effective public
policy combines enforcement with prevention," he said. "The ultimate
goal is to improve the quality of life."</TE>

<HD>Assembly Passes Bill to Control Emissions of Greenhouse Gas</HD>
<DH>Environment: The measure would reduce cars' carbon dioxide
emissions, a cause of global warming. Davis and auto makers may win
changes in Senate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY POLAKOVIC and MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a move that could lead to sweeping changes in how cars sold in
America are built, the Assembly passed a bill Wednesday that would
make California the first state to regulate vehicle exhaust linked to
global warming.</LD>
<LD>   The bill now goes to the state Senate, where amendments to answer
concerns held by Gov. Gray Davis and auto makers are a virtual
certainty.</LD>
<LD>   The measure, written by Democrat Fran Pavley of Agoura Hills,
barely cleared the Assembly on a party-line vote.</LD>
<TE>   Democrats argued that California needs to take a leading role in
the fight against global warming, whereas Republicans said the air
quality board that would set the new standards could not be trusted.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great step for the state of California, but the hard work
now begins," Pavley said.</TE>
<TE>   The bill is a pioneering attempt to require reductions in carbon
dioxide emitted by cars and light trucks. Vehicles in California
account for about 60% of those emissions, which are not a direct
health threat but are a major contributor to climate change.</TE>
<TE>   About 10% of the nation's new car sales occur in California.</TE>
<TE>   "California has a unique and historic role in the design and
manufacturing of automobiles," said state Resources Secretary Mary
Nichols. "Whatever California chooses to do with cars is important
for the rest of country and world market."</TE>
<TE>   Mindful of the bill's potentially far-reaching effects, the
governor's office plans to seek revisions once it reaches the Senate
to identify the best methods to achieve reductions, win acceptance
from auto makers and define how the state Air Resources Board can
implement it.</TE>
<TE>   "We need some thoughtful consultation to find a bill the auto
industry can live with. This administration would prefer to find a
path that brings the interested parties together in the end," said
California Environmental Protection Agency Secretary Winston H.
Hickox.</TE>
<TE>   Although the bill probably faces a more favorable reception in the
Democratic-controlled Senate, Republican lawmakers and a few moderate
Democrats questioned whether California should seek a leadership role
against global warming.</TE>
<TE>   "This bill represents the worst form of environmental extremism,"
said Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman John Campbell (R-Irvine) argued that efforts to
control carbon dioxide emissions would divert resources from a
successful campaign to improve air quality by removing common air
pollutants.</TE>
<TE>   But supporters argued that California, long a national leader in
cleaning up smokestack and tailpipe exhaust, is obliged to act
against global warming.</TE>

<HD>Boater Who Saved 4 Pins on a Medal</HD>
<DH>Heroism: Retired firefighter regrets only that he was
unable to rescue two others aboard a sinking vessel.</DH>

<LD>They gave Ronald May a medal for bravery Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   It was solid gold and presented by Vice Adm. Ernest R. Riutta, the
U.S. Coast Guard's Pacific Area commander, in front of 50 officers
standing at attention.</LD>
<LD>   May's name was engraved on the back, along with a date: Oct. 23,
2000.</LD>
<TE>   That night, under a moonless sky, May was heading back from Santa
Catalina Island on his pleasure boat, the Mystic, when he picked up
radio chatter about a boating accident at a mooring buoy 11/2 miles
off El Segundo.</TE>
<TE>   May is 58, trim and fit with brown eyes and gray hair. Retired
from the Beverly Hills Fire Department after 28 years, he lives in
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   He swung the Mystic around and scanned the sea for signs of the
accident.</TE>
<TE>   A mile ahead, he spotted the running lights of a 23-foot pleasure
craft, the Charades, which was taking on water. Six panic-stricken
passengers huddled in the ship's cabin.</TE>
<TE>   "We're sinking!" they screamed. "We're sinking!"</TE>
<TE>   The deck was just 6 inches above the water.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, the stern of the boat sank, tossing four terrified
passengers into the chilly water. All four managed to grab hold of
ropes May and a friend who was with him, Richard Tracy, tossed their
way. They were safely hauled onto the Mystic.</TE>
<TE>   But two more--petrified with fear--were trapped inside the
Charades' cabin: 8-year-old Donta Perry and his grandmother, Mildred
Griffin, 66.</TE>
<TE>   May grabbed a snorkel and fins and plunged fully clothed into
oil-slickened, 60-degree water.</TE>
<TE>   He found his way into the submerged cabin and managed to grab hold
of Griffin. He pulled and pulled, but he couldn't get her out. The
Charades was sinking fast.</TE>
<TE>   May was forced to surface for air. He dove back into the boat's
cabin that was cluttered with debris. No luck.</TE>
<TE>   He surfaced once more and then dove a third time.</TE>
<TE>   He ran out of breath, returned to his boat and fired off a flare.
Griffin and the boy had been trapped for about 10 minutes when Harbor
Patrol Deputies Mark Ballin and Max Doke arrived.</TE>
<TE>   By then, only the tip of the Charades bobbed above the water.</TE>
<TE>   Ballin tied the boat to his vessel, put on scuba gear and dove in.
He found the boy and his grandmother, still wearing life jackets,
pinned inside the flooded cabin.</TE>
<TE>   The life jackets complicated the rescue, he recalled later,
because they made it hard to pull them low enough to get them out and
away from the cabinets.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, he freed the boy, then the woman.</TE>
<TE>   On the surface, sheriff's deputies who had joined the rescue
administered CPR to the boy and grandmother, both of whom were by
then in full cardiac arrest. Their lungs were filled with water and
both suffered from hypothermia.</TE>
<TE>   Donta, a third-grader at Oak Street Elementary School in
Inglewood, was taken to UCLA Medical Center. He died a few hours
later.</TE>
<TE>   Griffin, a subscription saleswoman for the Los Angeles Times who
had been in a coma in the intensive-care unit at Daniel Freeman
Marina Hospital, died three days later.</TE>
<TE>   "I think about it a lot," May recalled Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I did my best. But it still bothers me that I couldn't save
them."</TE>
<TE>   May was flanked by his wife, Candy, and his mother, Sally, as a
Coast Guard officer read aloud the rare citation for "extreme and
heroic daring" on that October night.</TE>
<TE>   "If not for [May's] selfless actions, the lives of all six
passengers on board the Charades might have been lost," the citation
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. May risked his own life in an attempt to save others. His
unselfish actions and valiant service reflect the highest credit upon
himself and are in keeping with the highest traditions of
humanitarian service."</TE>
<TE>   Only 600 other such medals have been awarded since the honor was
established by Congress in 1874. They are reserved for people who
risk their own lives while saving or attempting to save another from
drowning, a shipwreck or other perils of the water.</TE>
<TE>   The first recipients were three brothers who rescued two people on
Lake Erie in 1875.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been in the Coast Guard 34 years, and this is the second
Gold Lifesaver Medal I've ever seen or awarded to anyone," Riutta
told May. "I'm very proud to stand in your presence, sir."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel that I did all that much," May said.</TE>

<HD>Recent Earthquakes Unearth Memories</HD>
<DH>Fear: The series of small jolts rattles nerves of many who
recall the '94 Northridge temblor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA and GARIOT LOUIMA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's been eight years since the Northridge quake and twice that long
since Chris Hess was taught the earthquake drill so familiar to
California schoolchildren.</LD>
<LD>   But for each of the dozens of small quakes that have rolled
through the region since Monday--all aftershocks of the 1994
temblor--Hess remembered the childhood drill and ran for the nearest
doorway.</LD>
<LD>   This week's quakes, the largest a 4.2 shaker Monday night, have
prompted the 25-year-old Cal State Northridge student and many other
Southern Californians to brush up on quake preparedness skills and
try to calm their nerves.</LD>
<TE>   "Northridge started small, then it escalated and the shaking
didn't seem to stop," Hess said. Monday night's quake "started off
small, and thank God it stayed little."</TE>
<TE>   Those who have religiously kept their water bottles filled and
valuables glued to the shelves since January 1994 said the
aftershocks of the 6.7 magnitude quake justify their preparations for
the Big One.</TE>
<TE>   "Northridge taught us to be prepared rather than just run around
being scared," said Robin Galvez, 54, who lives in Simi Valley near
the epicenter of the recent quakes.</TE>
<TE>   Galvez said she keeps a 55-gallon tank of water and a week's
supply of canned food in the kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   Monday night's temblor, however, sent her cat, which was wedged
between a couch and an end table for days after the 1994 quake, under
her bed for 24 hours.</TE>
<TE>   Tara Condon, a Simi Valley manicurist who is eight months'
pregnant, said she didn't realize there had been a quake Monday night
until her husband ran to tell her.</TE>
<TE>   "I just thought it was me walking because I'm so fat," said
Condon, 37, as she filed nails at the Get Nailed salon. "But my
husband comes running in, screaming and yelling about the Big One
coming. I just laughed at him."</TE>
<TE>   The couple have started putting their shoes by the bed before
going to sleep, and her husband has insisted she wear pajama bottoms,
Condon said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's just Mr. Paranoid," she said. "I'm sure I won't forget to
put on pants, even if there's a big earthquake."</TE>
<TE>   Curtis Swartley, 22, said customers at Brunswick Valley Bowl in
Simi Valley haven't worried.</TE>
<TE>   "If the pins fall, they reset them," Swartley said. "No one freaks
out about earthquakes--this is California."</TE>
<TE>   Some native Southern Californians, however, developed earthquake
phobias after the 1994 shaker, including Yoseya Taylor, 18, who said
she ran under a closet doorway when the ground shook Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   "I was freaked the heck out," said Taylor, who lives in a Cal
State Northridge dorm. "I've been in earthquakes in L.A. Those are
nothing. Earthquakes in Northridge are scarier."</TE>

<HD>Car Plows Into School Crowd</HD>
<DH>Accident: Eighteen students and teachers are injured, four
severely, as driver loses control of vehicle in a parking lot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON and JOE MATHEWS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A woman who apparently lost control of her car plowed into a row of
students waiting for their rides Wednesday outside a private
elementary school in Eagle Rock, injuring 15 children and three
teachers, four of them severely.</LD>
<LD>   The woman, who was there to pick up her grandchild, accelerated
through the parking lot at Westminster Academy Christian Day School
"at unexpected speed," said Brian Humphrey, a spokesman for the Los
Angeles Fire Department.</LD>
<LD>   "She stepped on the accelerator instead of the brake," said LAFD
Capt. Steve Ruda.</LD>
<TE>   Humphrey said the children "were standing in alignment. That is
why a significant number were hit."</TE>
<TE>   David Thibault, principal of the academy, said he saw four or five
victims trapped beneath the car. A group of people, including members
of a basketball team from Arcadia who were visiting a nearby school,
lifted the car so the victims could be freed, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It took many of them to lift it," Thibault said.</TE>
<TE>   The Fire Department responded in force, setting up a triage center
in the school's parking lot, providing emergency treatment before
taking the most seriously injured to hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the injuries were described as "bumps and bruises," but
three children and at least one adult were more severely hurt.</TE>
<TE>   Two boys ages 6 and 9 were taken by helicopter to Childrens
Hospital at Sunset Boulevard and Vermont Avenue where they later were
reported alert and in stable condition with multiple fractures. The
injuries were said not to be life-threatening.</TE>
<TE>   A 9-year-old girl who suffered head injuries and a music teacher
with multiple leg and pelvic fractures were taken to County-USC
Medical Center, where both are expected to recover. Other children
with less serious injuries were taken there and to Huntington
Memorial Hospital in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   Police quickly cordoned off the area around the school,
frustrating the efforts of worried parents to find out whether their
children were among the victims.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me through! Let me through!" shouted one woman whose way was
blocked by police and emergency personnel.</TE>
<TE>   Don Hanson rushed to the school after getting a call that his
wife, Jan, a music teacher, was among those struck.</TE>
<TE>   "All I know is she was under the car and they had to pick it up
off her," Hanson said as he tried to find out how badly his wife had
been hurt and where she had been taken.</TE>
<TE>   The academy in the 1400 block of Colorado Boulevard serves
children from kindergarten through eighth grade. The school is not
affiliated with the adjacent Eagle Rock Baptist Church.</TE>
<TE>   Police said that at about 3:15 p.m., as customary, about 80 of the
school's 220 students had formed two parallel queues in the parking
lot, which doubles as a playground, to await their rides, which turn
in from a side street and drive between the lines of children.</TE>
<TE>   The cars normally drive slowly, but this time, an older
Mercedes-Benz accelerated suddenly into one of the lines of children,
scattering victims across the asphalt, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the kids, they just didn't see it coming," said Jaryl
Mordeno, an 11-year-old student at the school who escaped injury.</TE>
<TE>   Jan Gabrielson, who has taught at the school for 30 years, was
patrolling the parking lot when she saw the car lurch forward. She
quickly moved herself and several children from its path.</TE>
<TE>   "It happened too quickly for most everyone else to get out of the
way," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The car ran over and dragged several children and one teacher,
Gabrielson said. Other teachers and several basketball players
gathered and lifted the car to free those trapped.</TE>
<TE>   Student Jonathan Villegas, 11, ran inside and shouted for help.
Another student, Jeffrey Arilar, 12, said he "saw smoke and kids
lying around everywhere and kids lying under the car."</TE>
<TE>   The driver, described as a woman in her 60s, suffered minor
bruises and was hospitalized for observation. "She was deeply
shaken," Humphrey said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our preliminary investigation revealed that this was a tragic
accident, with no criminal intent," said Los Angeles Police Sgt. John
Pasquariello.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they had no plans to file any charges.</TE>
<TE>   The school will be closed today, but a prayer service will be held
there at 9 a.m.</TE>

<HD>Sale Links 2 Pristine Coastal Mountain Sites</HD>
<DH>Environment: Conservationists purchase a 417-acre portion
of Tuna Canyon. Along with land acquired last year, it will be
preserved as a wilderness area.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA MURILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A conservation group has acquired 417 acres in Tuna Canyon between
Malibu and Topanga canyons, linking two large pieces of land set
aside last year to protect a stretch of undeveloped landscape above
Pacific Coast Highway.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a perfect example of a Southern California canyon in its
pristine state," said Garrie Mar of the Mountains Restoration Trust,
which completed the deal last week.</LD>
<LD>   The land connects 1,659 acres purchased by the state last year to
extend Topanga State Park to the ocean and 1,256 acres acquired in
December by the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a really strategic wedge piece between the two properties,"
said Rorie Skei, acting deputy director of the conservancy.</TE>
<TE>   The three parcels, covered with coastal scrub and chaparral,
constitute a rare swath of wilderness in Southern California. The
land has been highly coveted by conservationists.</TE>
<TE>   Trust staffers said they will work with the state and the
conservancy to protect wildlife habitats and explore recreational
uses for the land.</TE>
<TE>   They hope to connect the areas with a nature trail and build links
to the Backbone Trail, which runs 60 miles from Will Rogers State
Park in Pacific Palisades to Point Mugu State Park in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy have said they
plan to keep the land as open space, with the exception of a camp for
students from low-income neighborhoods to enjoy the wilderness.</TE>
<TE>   The trust acquired the land, valued at $13 million, from John Paul
DeJoria, founder of Paul Mitchell Hair Care Systems, said Mountains
Restoration Trust President Steve Harris.</TE>
<TE>   DeJoria, who bought the property to develop it, sold a portion of
the land for about $1.4 million and donated the rest. Under terms of
the sale, the land must be kept as open space, except for some nature
trails and necessary maintenance buildings, said real estate agent
Matthew Rodman, who brokered the deal.</TE>
<TE>   DeJoria will be able to write off the deal as a charitable
donation.</TE>

<DH>Memorial: The pair, killed in a helicopter crash, are
called men of honor and courage.</DH>

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Two Marines killed in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan were
eulogized Wednesday as young men of honor and courage who "made the
world a safer place" by volunteering to serve in the war against
terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   "Their country called in November, and they volunteered," Lt. Col.
David L. Spasojevich said of Staff Sgt. Walter F. Cohee III and Staff
Sgt. Dwight J. Morgan. "They were chosen because they were the best.
They were Marines' Marines."</LD>
<LD>   Cohee, 26, of Mardela Springs, Md., and Morgan, 24, of Willits in
Northern California, were killed in the Jan. 19 crash of a CH-53E
Super Stallion in the snowy mountains near Kabul while on a resupply
mission. Five members of the crew were injured.</LD>
<TE>   At a memorial service in the chapel at the Marine Corps Air
Station Miramar, several hundred Marines and family members heard
Cohee and Morgan praised as dedicated to the Marine Corps and their
families. The chapel was decked in red, white and blue flowers and
pictures of the two Marines.</TE>
<TE>   "When I think of Dwight, he was a Marine you could look up to,"
said Cpl. Jesse D. Phipps. "He was always squared-away.... An empty
space in my heart will be hard to fill. I wasn't ready to say
goodbye."</TE>
<TE>   Master Sgt. Thomas G. Villarreal said Cohee's motto was: "Get it
right. Get it right the first time. There is no room for error. We're
Marines."</TE>
<TE>   The emotional service was the second such farewell held at Miramar
this month for Marines killed in the war zone.</TE>
<TE>   Seven Marines from Miramar died when their KC-130 Hercules cargo
and refueling plane crashed in Pakistan while attempting a night
landing Jan. 9. No cause has been determined.</TE>
<TE>   The two crashes give Miramar the grisly distinction of being the
U.S. military base that has suffered the most war zone fatalities in
the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Navy chaplain Lt. George R. Bradshaw said Morgan's 4-year-old son,
Alex, can be proud that "the world is safer because his father had
the courage to confront evil in a land faraway."</TE>
<TE>   Morgan's widow, Teresa, is expecting the couple's second child.</TE>
<TE>   Cohee and his fiancee, Vanessa Gerritsen, a graduate student at UC
San Diego, planned to be married. Using military e-mail, he had asked
her sister and parents for their blessing for the marriage.</TE>
<TE>   "When I found out [Cohee] had died, I felt I died too," a tearful
Gerritsen told reporters after the memorial. "I have no idea what my
future holds or how I'm going to go on without him. He was the love
of my life and always will be."</TE>
<TE>   Cohee and Morgan were part of heavy helicopter Squadron 361, known
as the Flying Tigers. Both had completed a deployment in the Middle
East when the U.S. sent forces to Afghanistan to rout the Taliban
government and Al Qaeda terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   "In disbelief, anger, grief and sorrow, we grasp for memories,"
said Spasojevich, the squadron's commanding officer. "They will be in
our hearts forever."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ever wonder why some people become irritating bureaucrats? It's
because they get paid more, judging from a notice discovered by
Sheila Berman of L.A. (see accompanying).</LD>
<LD>   No wonder the siren was so loud! Ernie Riesen was driving in the
San Fernando Valley when he heard a siren sound and pulled over. So
did a nearby motorist.</LD>
<LD>   Only Riesen noticed that this driver unknowingly stopped in the
driveway of the fire station where a truck was trying to exit.</LD>
<TE>   "Regardless of how loud they blasted their horn and siren, she did
not move," Riesen said. "Finally, a fireman jumped out and confronted
her and she moved."</TE>
<TE>   Unclear on the concept: Visiting New York, Pam Schulz found some
interesting kids' dishes listed on a brewery sign (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Deja noodle: Your eyes aren't playing tricks on you as you drive
down Valley Boulevard in Alhambra. That really is a Noodle World
restaurant close to a Noodle Planet restaurant as well as a Noodle
City restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   World was started by John Mekpongsatorn and specializes in all
manner of Asian dishes. After World began drawing crowds, he opened
Planet, giving it a different name so as not to confuse people
phoning for take-out. Noodle City, a rival, specializes in Vietnamese
food.</TE>
<TE>   Mekpongsatorn, by the way, also owns a Noodle Star in nearby
Monterey Park.I guess he's not afraid of overusing the old noodle.</TE>
<TE>   A crumby rumor: Stanley Marcus, of Neiman Marcus fame, died the
other day at the age of 96, but one urban folk tale about the
high-brow store refuses to die.</TE>
<TE>   Just a few months ago, I received an e-mail from still another
person who claimed to know a victim of the Neiman Marcus Cookie
Recipe scam.</TE>
<TE>   As the tale is usually told, the victim dines in a Neiman Marcus
restaurant and as an afterthought asks for the ingredients in the
delicious cookies.</TE>
<TE>   A waitress supposedly tells her that the cost is "two fifty" and
the diner agrees to have that sum added to her credit card statement.</TE>
<TE>   Days later, she notices to her horror on the credit card statement
that the cost was $250.</TE>
<TE>   So she puts the recipe on the Internet, supposedly getting her
revenge on Neiman Marcus.</TE>
<TE>   Problem is: The store doesn't make its own cookies and doesn't
sell cookie recipes. Not only that, but urban folk tale historians
have traced this yarn back to the 1930s, when the alleged fee was
$100 for a cake recipe at the Waldorf Hotel in New York.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: The police log of the Los Alamitos News-Enterprise
reported that "a resident suspected illegal gambling was occurring at
a neighbor's home.</TE>
<TE>   But it was just the family playing dominoes loudly." Good to hear
that everything was above board.</TE>

<HD>Postal Workers Flee Mystery Package</HD>
<DH>Hazards: Inglewood facility is evacuated, but investigators
find the parcel contains a bottle of an exotic Haitian beverage that
broke during shipment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ F. KAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It started with a leaky package.</LD>
<LD>   Workers at the north Inglewood post office noticed it Wednesday
morning. Several examined it. Six began to complain of headaches,
nausea and dry mouth.</LD>
<LD>   Managers called the Los Angeles County Fire Department's
hazardous-materials unit, and about 30 postal employees and four
customers were evacuated.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities established a containment area, closing off La Brea
Avenue between Centinela Avenue and Hyde Park Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Hazardous-materials team members, wearing surgical green suits,
went in to retrieve the package for testing.</TE>
<TE>   After emerging with it, each member was hosed down in a children's
wading pool to reduce danger from possible contaminants.</TE>
<TE>   Postal investigators contacted the sender, using the return
address in Coral Gables, Fla. But the sender seemed to have trouble
understanding their concern.</TE>
<TE>   Then they called the intended recipient, 26-year-old Rosenne
Germille of Inglewood.</TE>
<TE>   She told them that the package, sent by her family, contained
cinnamon sticks, a breadfruit, and two glass bottles containing
Essence de Vanille, a drink made of vanilla, caramel and alcohol that
is popular in her native Haiti.</TE>
<TE>   One of those bottles had broken.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell my family near Miami to send it to me" because the drink
is not available for sale here, Germille said after driving to the
containment site at authorities' request. "I don't like to drink
Pepsi and I don't like to drink 7-Up. You mix in lemon and sugar and
water and drink it like juice," she said.</TE>
<TE>   A friend who came with Germille was not surprised by the response,
particularly after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "If that's the first time you smell something like that, then of
course the post office gets scared," said Alfred Macksa.</TE>
<TE>   Fire Department public information officer Roland L. Sprewell said
it was unclear whether employees were ill or frightened.</TE>
<TE>   "Because the contents of the box had an alcohol base and because
they opened it in an enclosed space, they may have been overcome by
the fumes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Or it could be completely psychosomatic."</TE>

<HD>No Damage, Injuries From Northridge Aftershocks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A swarm of Northridge earthquake aftershocks continued for the third
day Wednesday, with magnitude 3.5 and 3.0 temblors recorded in
midmorning 10 minutes apart.</LD>
<LD>   There were also several smaller jolts.</LD>
<LD>   All of the quakes occurred in the same vicinity as Monday's and
Tuesday's quakes, in the Santa Susana Mountains six miles northeast
of Simi Valley and six miles west of Valencia. None caused any damage
or injuries.</LD>
<TE>   The 3.5 quake, at 10:47 a.m., was felt throughout the Santa
Clarita, Simi and San Fernando valleys and as far east as Pasadena,
according to a map produced by the U.S. Geological Survey.</TE>
<TE>   There have been more than 15,700 aftershocks of the 1994
Northridge quake, including 440 in the 3.0 range, 57 in the 4.0 range
and 11 over 5.0.</TE>
<TE>   Although the original quake was centered in the San Fernando
Valley, about 70% of the energy was expended north of the Valley, and
some of the hardest shaking was in the Santa Clarita Valley,
earthquake scientists have concluded.</TE>

<LD>The only smoke alarm in the house where Donald Ybarra and his three

shortly before, his wife told authorities.</LD>
<LD>   Fire investigators combing the ruins of the home said Wednesday
that the detector was found on top of a dresser, where Melodie Ybarra
last remembered seeing it.</LD>
<LD>   She escaped the fire with second-degree burns. Her husband and
their sons, ages 7, 4 and 2, died when flames spread too quickly for

<HD>UC Faculty Panel Urges New Admissions Test</HD>
<DH>Education: Group says SAT I exam should be scrapped for one
that measures what students learned in high school.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA TROUNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A key faculty committee of the University of California has
recommended that the university drop the SAT I college admissions
test in favor of developing an exam more closely aligned with high
school course work.</LD>
<LD>   University officials said the proposal by a committee of the
university's systemwide Academic Council will now go through a
faculty review at UC campuses before final consideration by the Board
of Regents, probably in July.</LD>
<LD>   The committee recommendation is a significant step in a process
launched nearly a year ago, when UC President Richard Atkinson sent
shock waves through the higher education community nationwide with a
proposal to scrap the SAT I as a requirement for UC admission.</LD>
<TE>   Atkinson said then--and even more forcefully in the months
since--that the test, long considered the "gold standard" in college
admissions, is unfair to many students and fails to measure how much
they learned in high school.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Atkinson says he wants a test closely aligned with
California state standards for a high school diploma that attempts to
measure a student's general aptitude for college. The SAT I measures
general aptitude in verbal and math skills. The SAT II measures
knowledge of specific subjects.</TE>
<TE>   In its proposal, the faculty committee--the university's
influential Board of Admissions and Relations with
Schools--recommended that the University of California work
separately with the nation's two top testing agencies, ACT Inc. and
the College Board, which owns the SAT, to develop a new admissions
test.</TE>
<TE>   Both said Wednesday that they would work with UC to develop a new
test.</TE>
<TE>   The committee said the proposed three-hour test should be based on
California public school curriculum and should measure a student's
mastery of reading, writing and math, the fundamental skills needed
at the university.</TE>
<TE>   No test now available meets those specifications, the committee
said in its report, which was discussed Wednesday by the Academic
Council.</TE>
<TE>   Dorothy Perry, who chairs the committee, said its members believed
strongly that standardized tests should continue to play a role in
the university's admissions process: the new three-hour test, for
example, along with two one-hour exams in specific subjects.</TE>
<TE>   UC applicants now are required to take either the SAT I aptitude
test or the ACT achievement test, in addition to three SAT II
achievement tests. But many more applicants--about 73% of last year's
total--choose to take the SAT I. Far more college admissions rely on
SAT scores rather than ACT scores.</TE>
<TE>   ACT President Richard Ferguson, who returned to Iowa City on
Wednesday after meetings with UC officials, said that the proposal
was "exceedingly positive" from his perspective, and that the current
ACT test--with the addition of a writing sample--seemed likely to
meet UC's needs.</TE>
<TE>   College Board spokeswoman Chiara Coletti said her company viewed
the proposal as an "exciting opportunity," but said she hoped it
would not create confusion for college applicants and their parents.</TE>
<TE>   Coletti also said there is no indication that other universities
would follow UC in moving away from the SAT I. "The vast majority are
very, very partial" to the test, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The UC committee recommended that the new test, if approved,
should go into effect for the freshman class entering in the fall of
2006, at the earliest. Perry said the committee recommended that UC
stick with the current testing requirements while the new test is
being developed.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the committee said the new test should be formulated
so scores can be translated into equivalent SAT I or the ACT results.
This would keep California students from having to take those tests
to apply to other schools, the committee said.</TE>

<LD>The San Diego Unified Port District has agreed to pay $50,000 to a
company owned by Padres owner John Moores to settle a suit involving
a hotel development project.</LD>
<LD>   Moores' JMI Realty sued the port in April over a failed deal to
build a hotel on a former shipyard site near the convention center.
The lawsuit said that in 1999, the port chose a rival developer to
build a 1,000- to 1,200-room hotel, despite a previous agreement with
JMI. No hotel has been built, and last year the port regained rights
to develop the property.</LD>

<LD>Despite opposition from numerous cities, the Assembly narrowly
approved legislation that would force cities in the Sacramento
metropolitan region to share future growth in sales taxes.</LD>
<LD>   Supporters of AB 680, by Assemblyman Darrell Steinberg
(D-Sacramento), say it would encourage regional cooperation to fight
problems such as traffic and urban sprawl, and to stop unproductive
competition among cities for big-box retailers and auto malls.</LD>
<LD>   Opponents say it is a socialistic scheme that favors Sacramento
and punishes wealthier suburbs, and does not deal with the real
reason cities thirst for sales tax dollars: They don't get enough
from the state to provide basic services. The bill now goes to the
Senate.</LD>

<LD>A gimpy black bear that became a celebrity in the city late last year
will be moved to new accommodations in Sacramento County--complete
with a hot tub.</LD>
<LD>   Arthur, a 300-pound black bear, languished for weeks with shotgun
pellets in an arthritic hip before public protest prompted the state
Fish and Game Department to capture the bruin and start treatment.</LD>
<LD>   Spokesman Steve Martarano said the bear will have recovered
sufficiently to be moved in about a month to the Performing Animal
Welfare Society, a wildlife center in Galt, Calif. His
1,000-square-foot enclosure will include a hot tub to help ease
lingering arthritic pain.</LD>

<LD>The family of an 11-year-old boy accidentally killed during a SWAT
team raid agreed to a $450,000 settlement with the federal
government, the family's lawyer said.</LD>
<LD>   The family of Alberto Sepulveda is still suing the city and its
police officers. Trial is set for July.</LD>
<LD>   The family's deal could make it difficult for the city to win its
own lawsuit against the federal government over the boy's death Sept.
13. A SWAT team raided the family's home after reports of drug
activity, and drug charges against the boy's father remain in place.</LD>

<HD>Suspicious Shoes Shut Down Part of San Francisco Airport</HD>
<DH>Security: Thousands are evacuated after a questionable
substance is detected on a man's loafers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A man with suspicious residue on his shoes set off a security alert
that shut down part of San Francisco International Airport on
Wednesday morning, forcing the evacuation of thousands of passengers
and the diversion of two jetliners.</LD>
<LD>   But the havoc created by the incident did not affect the traveler
with the suspect loafers, who walked off with his shoes before he
could be questioned by authorities.</LD>
<LD>   A screening machine detected the potentially volatile substance on
the shoes, leading to the shutdown of the airport's domestic airline
terminal for more than three hours during the morning rush hour.</LD>
<TE>   Officials later said the substance could have been innocuous,
clinging to the man's shoes in trace amounts.</TE>
<TE>   The middle-aged traveler apparently left the security checkpoint
unaware that the high-tech screening device had signaled a problem
with his shoes. He is not considered a criminal suspect.</TE>
<TE>   Screening employees have focused more rigorously on passengers'
shoes since December, when British citizen Richard C. Reid allegedly
tried to blow up a Miami-bound American Airlines jet with explosives
hidden in his sneakers.</TE>
<TE>   The incident is the latest in a string of evacuations triggered by
security breaches at airports nationwide in the months after the
September terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Passengers were forced to disembark from planes parked at the
gates and join others outside in the cold morning air.</TE>
<TE>   The man, described by airport officials as white, about 5 feet 11,
and in his 40s, so flummoxed airport and airline employees that they
worried he might have boarded a plane and made it into the sky.</TE>
<TE>   United diverted two flights bound for the East Coast that left San
Francisco in the 10 minutes after the disappearance. Both flights,
originally bound for New York and Washington, were sent to Chicago's
O'Hare International Airport, where the planes and passengers were
searched by bomb sniffing dogs. A third plane from San Francisco,
bound for Chicago, was searched when it landed at O'Hare at midday,
said Joe Hopkins, media relations manager for United Airlines.</TE>
<TE>   "The possibility existed that this person got on one of those
airplanes," Hopkins said. "This is not unprecedented. This has
happened at other airports. Our view is that we will be conservative
and that safety is more important than inconveniencing people."</TE>
<TE>   The man went through security at the airport's crowded domestic
terminal about 6:35 a.m. and was randomly selected for a shoe check
by Argenbright Security Inc. employees, who operate security
checkpoints at San Francisco for United.</TE>
<TE>   He stepped to the side, and an employee ran a metal instrument
with a cloth attached to the end over his brown penny loafers. Then
the cloth was taken off and put into a machine that detected a trace
of suspicious residue, said Mike McCarron, an airport spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   When the monitor momentarily turned away to look for a supervisor
to discuss the results, the man figured he was finished and took the
shoes off the table and walked away, McCarron said. When the employee
turned around, the shoe owner was gone, along with his loafers.</TE>
<TE>   The monitor contacted a supervisor, who called a security alert.
Officials began evacuating the facility.</TE>
<TE>   "His bags went through and they came out clear with no residue on
them," McCarron said. "His shoes must have had incidental contact
with fertilizer or something that caused the machine to come up
positive."</TE>
<TE>   He added that the man "could be totally unaware he was the source
of this" and most likely stood outside with other evacuated
passengers waiting for officials to clear the terminal.</TE>
<TE>   Up to 3,000 people were evacuated from the United terminal, which
was reopened about 10 a.m. The incident threw off United's schedule
for most of the day at one of its major Western hubs, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the security
breach to determine what went wrong, McCarron said. "It appears the
security employee wasn't following standard procedure by keeping an
eye on the customer and the shoes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The incident underscores the effectiveness of some 700 "trace
detection" machines in place at airports around the country, security
experts said. The machines were purchased by the federal government
in the mid-'90s, and airlines were required to use them to randomly
check passengers' belongings and bags for suspicious substances.</TE>
<TE>   "They provide an extra layer as far as explosives detection goes,"
said Thomas Hartwick, chairman of a National Academy of Sciences
panel on aviation security. "If you were a terrorist building a bomb
you could build it in many shapes. Molecules are only built in one
way--so these machines have an advantage over X-ray machines, where
they're trying to detect shape."</TE>
<TE>   But security experts expressed concern about a pattern of security
breaches at the nation's commercial airports since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "This has happened over and over," said Michael Boyd, president of
the Boyd Group, an aviation consulting firm in Evergreen, Colo.
Indeed, in the last few months there have been numerous security
breaches at commercial airports. A sampling:</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 26, a security guard allowed an impatient passenger to
slip past a screening checkpoint at St. Louis' Lambert Field, forcing
an evacuation and delaying 3,900 passengers and 70 flights.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 16, a passenger walked past security screeners at
Detroit's Metro Airport, delaying 35 Northwest Airlines flights.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 4, a traveler in a wheelchair bypassed security, forcing
the shutdown of three wings at Portland International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   On Christmas, a terminal at Las Vegas' McCarran International
Airport was evacuated after two people rushed through a security
gate.</TE>

<HD>Region's Farmers Weathering Cold Spell--Though It Isn't
Easy</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: Growers say their efforts to ward off crop
damage from this week's subfreezing temperatures have been largely
successful.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Southern California's farmers watched their thermometers late
Wednesday as temperatures threatened to drop below freezing for the
second consecutive night, endangering sensitive crops such as
strawberries and avocados.</LD>
<LD>   "So far, no one has reported any major damage," Rick Lefeuvre,
Orange County's agricultural commissioner, said Wednesday afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   "Strawberry farmers are pretty sophisticated, and they watch the
temperatures like a hawk."</LD>
<TE>   The same appeared to be true in agriculture-rich Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   The farmers there dodged a bullet Tuesday night, said Earl
McPhail, Ventura County's agricultural commissioner. "Everybody I
know came through this real well."</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say it was easy.</TE>
<TE>   After only a few hours of sleep, Santa Paula citrus and avocado
rancher Bob Pinkerton was up at 10 p.m. Tuesday, responding to an
alarm planted in one of his orchards warning that the temperature had
dropped to 34 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   He had spent Tuesday afternoon running sprinklers in his groves, a
frost-protection measure that can raise the temperature by as much as
4 degrees. That night, he had to hop out of bed to fire up his 15
wind machines, a move aimed at circulating the warmer air aloft and
directing it closer to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "When that alarm rings, you go," he said. "There's no pulling the
covers back over your head."</TE>
<TE>   Pinkerton was up all night. As the wind machines buzzed overhead
like a squadron of helicopters, the veteran rancher monitored a
series of thermometers staked in strategic locations throughout his
orchard.</TE>
<TE>   The temperature would have to drop to 28 degrees or below, for at
least a couple of hours, to cause significant crop damage, Pinkerton
explained. It did drop to 28 degrees once during the night, but for
less than half an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Overnight temperatures in some areas of Orange County fell even
lower. Late Tuesday night, thermometers dipped to 26 degrees in some
agricultural districts, the county's lowest in several years.</TE>
<TE>   Growers there also used sprinklers to protect their crops, which
limited losses Tuesday night to about 30% of the crop on 10 to 20
acres, Lefeuvre said--damage he described as negligible.</TE>
<TE>   But field hands were back again Wednesday night in case it got
cold again before dawn today.</TE>
<TE>   "The cold could last another two days and maybe into early next
week," Lefeuvre said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's probably the coldest we've had in the last five or six
years," said Doug Circle, owner of Sunrise Growers of Placentia.</TE>
<TE>   While the low temperatures have caused "a big amount of damage" to
the February crop, he said, the cold probably affected less than 5%
of the total. The main economic drain, Circle said, was the cost of
people working overtime to monitor the weather, the cost of water for
the sprinkler systems and the disruption to the harvesting cycle.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to pick much today, because the fields are wet,
and we're probably not going to pick much for the next two days," he
said. "It will be a while before we get back to our normal cycle."</TE>
<TE>   Still, he said, "we'll get through it, because we're prepared to
live with the weather. It's all part of farming."</TE>

<DH>O'Ree, NHL's First Black Player, Proud of League's Progress</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There weren't any big celebrations or much attention on Jan. 18,
1958, when Willie O'Ree made his NHL debut as a winger for the Boston
Bruins.</LD>
<LD>   But 44 years later, people still talk about the night he broke the
NHL color line.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm getting more coverage now because everywhere you look,
there's a story about all of the players of color coming into the
league," said O'Ree, who is in Los Angeles this week conducting
hockey clinics for inner-city boys and girls leading up to Saturday's
All-Star game at Staples Center. "When that happens, they end up
talking about Willie O'Ree breaking the color barrier."</LD>
<TE>   For years, O'Ree's name was mainly remembered as an answer for a
hockey trivia quiz but not much else. There are many sports fans who
think hockey is still played only by whitesBut the number of black
players in the league has grown to a record 15 this season, including
Calgary's Jarome Iginla, who leads the NHL--with more than 700
players--in goals scored.</TE>
<TE>   While league officials and others acknowledge that more can be
done to expand the NHL's recruiting pool, O'Ree wants to take a
moment to savor the progress already made.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel really wonderful," said O'Ree, who became the NHL's
Director of Youth Development and Diversity Task Force four years ago
to find ways to expose inner-city youths to hockey. "I'm happy that I
was in a position to break down barriers and open doors for these
players of color to play now."</TE>
<TE>   In the first half of the 20th century, black players were fully
integrated in Canadian hockey. But as the NHL grew to prominence from
a loosely organized six league team, the league's two Canadian
franchises adopted the U.S.'s active policy of exclusion and began to
shun black players.</TE>
<TE>   Many black players chose to stay in Canada, however, and play for
other professional leagues, where the pay and the level of
competition were comparable to the NHL.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until 1958 that O'Ree became the NHL's first black
player, an especially notable achievement because O'Ree had been
legally blinded in one eye years earlier, after being struck in the
face by a puck.</TE>
<TE>   He said his teammates welcomed him.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt as I belonged, because the Boston Bruins organization was
very supportive, and made me feel a part of the team," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It took another 15 years until a second black player, Mike Marson,
joined the Capitals. All told, it has taken nearly 75 years for
blacks to gain a foothold into the NHL</TE>
<TE>   No one can say for sure, but racism is believed to have played a
role in the time gap between the two players. And O'Ree believes that
it also cost Stan Maxwell, a former teammate and close friend, his
chance to play in the NHL.</TE>
<TE>   "We turned pro together in 1956 with the Quebec Aces and went to
the Bruins' training camp together," O'Ree said about Maxwell. "I got
the call in 1958, but Stan could have gotten the call just as easy.
He could skate, shoot, pass ... he had all the equipment. They just
didn't call on him. He was really good."</TE>
<TE>   After two seasons with the Bruins and only four goals, O'Ree went
to the minor-league Los Angeles Blades.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just fortunate enough to reach the NHL, I wish I could have
played longer," said O'Ree.</TE>
<TE>   Now players such as Edmonton's Anson Carter, whose dreadlocks make
him difficult to overlook, can just play hockey and not worry about
race.</TE>
<TE>   "When I look outside, I don't see myself as a black hockey player,
I see myself as a hockey player," Carter said. "When I'm behind my
eyes, and looking out to see the world, I don't think 'I'm a black
hockey player.' I know I am, but that's not how I see things. I have
a job I have to do."</TE>
<TE>   Getting the job done is something black players are doing well
this season.</TE>
<TE>   Iginla, whose father is a Nigerian native, has led the league in
scoring for most of the season and his play earned him a spot on the
Canadian Olympic team.</TE>
<TE>   Carter leads the Oilers in scoring and goals scored. St. Louis
goaltender Fred Brathwaite has the third best goals-against-average
in the league and Tampa Bay goalie Kevin Weekes has one of the NHL's
top save percentages.</TE>
<TE>   And then there is Edmonton's Georges Laraque, Philadelphia's
Donald Brashear and Florida's Peter Worrell, who are not only three
of the best fighters in the league but also key contributors to their
respective teams.</TE>
<TE>   Like a proud father, O'Ree looks at today's black players with
admiration.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew that players of color would someday have a bigger role in
hockey but I didn't expect to see as many coming into the league at
one time," said O'Ree, who grew up the youngest of 12 children in New
Brunswick, Canada. "Look at Edmonton. [The Oilers] have four black
players on the team."</TE>
<TE>   For many of today's black players, former NHL goaltender Grant
Fuhr, who won five Stanley Cup championships with Edmonton, was the
player they watched while growing up.</TE>
<TE>   Although Fuhr didn't get mainstream attention for being a black
player in the NHL--probably because he wore a mask during games--that
didn't discourage Iginla, who grew up in Edmonton.</TE>
<TE>   "It was nice to see a black player not just playing, but starring
in the NHL," Iginla said earlier this season.</TE>
<TE>   O'Ree said he has enjoyed following the development of players
such as Iginla and Carter and believes the best is yet to come for
blacks in the NHL.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody says that I think we need a person of color to be the
next Wayne Gretzky, I don't agree with that," O'Ree said. "I think we
need more players of color coming into the league and there will be a
Wayne Gretzky. Maybe not next year or five years from now, but
eventually it would happen.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys in the league now are good hockey players. They have
talent and skill. They are there because they are good and not
because they are black."</TE>
<TE>   Although O'Ree played in only 45 NHL games, there are some people
who believe that he should be in the Hockey Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   But don't count on him to push for the honor.</TE>
<TE>   "If it happens, it happens," O'Ree said. "I am not going to lose
any sleep over it. I'm going to continue what I'm doing because I
enjoy what I am doing."</TE>
<TE>   Besides breaking the color barrier, he said, the "the greatest
thing that has happened to me" is having the change to introduce
hockey to young girls and boys.</TE>
<TE>   And watch his legend grow each time another player of color
reaches the NHL.</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Sign Bichette for Pinch-Hitting Role</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodgers, looking to bolster a bench that has lacked power from
the right side, signed power-hitting outfielder Dante Bichette to a
minor league contract Wednesday and invited him to spring training.</LD>
<LD>   Bichette, 38, will have an outside shot at playing left field if
newly acquired Brian Jordan, tentatively slated for left, proves he
can play center field this spring. But the Dodgers are looking at
Bichette more as a pinch-hitting complement to left-handed-hitting
utility player Dave Hansen.</LD>
<LD>   "We've been looking for a right-handed hitter off the bench since
late July," Dodger General Manager Dan Evans said. "We didn't have
that second guy we could go to after Hansen, someone who could drive
the ball late in the game and who could turn a real good reliever
around before we went to Hansen."</LD>
<TE>   Bichette, who received interest from St. Louis, Cleveland, Tampa
Bay, the New York Yankees and the Angels during the off-season, would
make a base salary of $575,000 if he makes the opening-day roster.
His contract includes incentives that could push the figure to $1
million.</TE>
<TE>   "I might come off the bench, I might play some left field if
Jordan is in center, nothing is guaranteed," Bichette said. "First I
have to make the club. But I'm in good shape, and I can still swing
the bat if I get the chance."</TE>
<TE>   Bichette, who first came to the big leagues with the Angels in
1988, is a career .299 hitter with 274 home runs in 14 seasons with
five teams. He hit .286 with 12 homers and 49 runs batted in for the
Boston Red Sox in 2001, mostly as a designated hitter. He played 37
games in left field and 16 in right last season.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-2, 235-pound Bichette had his best season in 1995, when
he hit .340 with 40 homers and 128 RBIs for Colorado and finished
second to Cincinnati shortstop Barry Larkin for the National League's
most valuable player award. That began a string of five consecutive
seasons in which Bichette, playing home games in hitter-friendly
Coors Field, had at least 22 homers and 118 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   Bichette is considered a below-average defensive player, a
potential deterrent to him playing much outfield in pitcher-friendly
Dodger Stadium, but he feels he has made strides in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   "I had knee surgery after the 1996 season, it took me a long time
to recover, and I think I developed a bad rap defensively," Bichette
said. "But I think I'll open some eyes this spring. My knees feel
good, I'm in great shape, I feel strong.... I really feel I can help
this team out."</TE>

<TE>   With two weeks left before the start of spring training, Jeffrey
Loria still was negotiating his purchase of the Marlins, leading to
the possibility Florida will not have a manager until just before
camp opens.</TE>
<TE>   Loria, who owns the Montreal Expos, does not have a signed
agreement for his contemplated $158-million purchase of the Marlins
from John Henry, two lawyers with knowledge of the talks said on the
condition they not be identified.</TE>
<TE>   Henry heads the group buying the Red Sox for $660 million from the
Jean R. Yawkey Trust. After the Boston sale was approved by major
league owners Jan. 16, Commissioner Bud Selig said he hoped Loria's
deal for the Marlins would be finalized quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Loria's talks with Henry had narrowed their differences to just a
few, and a deal could be signed this week, the lawyers said. Selig
hasn't scheduled another owners' meeting and, according to baseball's
rules, he must give teams 10 days' notice.</TE>
<TE>   That means the earliest Loria's purchase of the Marlins could be
approved is Feb. 11, three days before spring training camps start
opening in Florida and Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Once Loria gains approval to buy the Marlins, he is expected to
quickly shift his top executives to his new team, including Expo
Manager Jeff Torborg and interim General Manager Larry Beinfest.</TE>
<TE>   Loria intends to sell the Montreal franchise to the other 29 teams
for $120 million, and the commissioner's officer would run the Expos
this season. Frank Robinson, Selig's vice president in charge of
discipline, is the leading contender to run the Expos, several
baseball officials have said.</TE>
<TE>   Short a veteran starter, the Seattle Mariners finalized a $1.25
million, one-year contract with former Dodger James Baldwin.</TE>

<LD>A look at the history of black players, coaches, executives and
referees in hockey:</LD>
<LD>   1899-1910</LD>
<LD>   * Hipple Galloway and Charley Lightfoot played in the Central
Ontario Hockey Assn. in 1899, and are credited as the first blacks to
play professional hockey. Galloway was expelled the following summer
from an Ontario Baseball League team because an American player took
exception to his presence on the roster.* In 1900, the Colored Hockey
League of the Maritimes in Nova Scotia was formed. Fans paid 25 cents
to see decent hockey as well as a Harlem Globetrotter style act. The
league ceased operation in the '20s.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   1910-40</TE>
<TE>   * Frank Selke called Bud Kelly, "the best Negro hockey player I
ever saw." Legend has it that Kelly learned to skate on two whiskey
flasks that were tied to his shoes. Kelly excelled on Selke's 118th
Battalion squad and flirted with the prospect of joining the NHL's
Toronto St. Pats (later the Maple Leafs).</TE>
<TE>   * Another outstanding black player of the '20s was George Barnes,
who played for Cayuga in the Ontario Hockey Association. According to
local lore, Barnes was involved in a nasty fracas in which an
opposing player bled to death.</TE>
<TE>   * From 1937 to 1941 the all-black St. Catharine's Orioles played
in the Niagara District Hockey League.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   1940-70</TE>
<TE>   * "I'll give any man $10,000 who can make Herb Carnegie white."
That statement was attributed to Conn Smythe, owner of the Toronto
Maple Leafs in the '40s, and was typical of the era. Herb Carnegie,
along with his brother, Ossie, and Manny MacIntyre were known as the
"Black Aces," a swift, rugged, high scoring line in the Quebec Senior
Hockey League. The Black Aces were talented enough to play in the
NHL, but they made great money barnstorming in the Quebec League and
had side jobs with the team's corporate sponsor. In 1947 the Brooklyn
Dodgers broke the color barrier in baseball with the debut of Jackie
Robinson. The New York Rangers may have had the same history-making
idea when they invited Carnegie to training camp that same year. But
Carnegie was instead offered a contract to play for the Rangers' top
farm club and he decided to go back to the security of the Quebec
League.</TE>
<TE>   * Arthur Dorrington became the first black professional hockey
player in the U.S. when he signed a minor league deal with the
Rangers in 1950. Dorrington chose instead to play for the Atlantic
City Seagulls of the Eastern League, and led them to a league
championship in 1951. Dorrington continued to play minor league
hockey throughout the '50s and likely saw plenty of hockey players in
the off-season, as he was a practicing dentist.</TE>
<TE>   * Willie O'Ree broke the NHL's color barrier on Jan. 18, 1958,
when he played for the Bruins in a 3-0 win over the Montreal
Canadiens at the Forum. O'Ree was playing for Quebec City's
minor-league pro team when he got the call-up from the Bruins. Known
for his speed but not his hands, O'Ree scored only four goals in 45
games over two seasons with Boston. O'Ree went on to have a
successful career with the Los Angeles Blades and San Diego Gulls of
the Western Hockey League until 1974. * Center Stan Maxwell joined
O'Ree in Los Angeles as the only other black player in professional
hockey in the U.S. in the '60s.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   1970-95</TE>
<TE>   * As only the second black hockey player in NHL history, Mike
Marson made his NHL debut with the Capitals in 1974-75 and recorded
career-highs of 16 goals and 28 points in 76 games. Marson bounced
between the minors and the NHL for five more seasons until calling it
quits as an L.A. King in 1980. A third black player, Bill Riley, also
entered the league with the Capitals in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   * With 344 goals over a 13-year career, including eight seasons
with more than 20 goals (including a 40-goal season in 1987-88), Tony
McKegney was the NHL's first black offensive star.</TE>
<TE>   * Hard hitting right winger Ray Neufeld joined the NHL in 1979 and
enjoyed a solid 10-year NHL career with the Whalers, Jets and Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   * In 1982, Val James became the first African-American to play in
the NHL, when he laced up the skates for the Sabres.</TE>
<TE>   * A shoo-in for the Hockey Hall of Fame, Grant Fuhr was the NHL's
first black goaltender, as well as the first black hockey player to
win the Stanley Cup. Fuhr won five Cups with the Edmonton Oilers and
continued to have a phenomenal career until he retired with the
Calgary Flames in 2000. Fuhr won a Vezina Trophy as the NHL's best
goaltender in 1988 and his 403 wins rank sixth all-time.</TE>
<TE>   * The Chicago Blackhawks' Dirk Graham was an outstanding two-way
player, as evidenced by the Selke Trophy he won as the NHL's best
defensive forward in 1991. Graham was named the NHL's first black
coach in 1998-99. However, the Blackhawks' woeful 16-35-8 record
under Graham had him out the door before the end of the season.</TE>
<TE>   * John Paris was the first black head coach in professional hockey
and led the Atlanta Knights to the International Hockey League
championship in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   1996-PRESENT</TE>
<TE>   * Forwards Anson Carter, Mike Grier and Jarome Iginla all entered
the league at about the same time in 1996-97, each with enough talent
and ability to become future stars.</TE>
<TE>   * Donald Brashear, Peter Worrell, Georges Laraque, and Jean-Luc
Gran Pierre are known to be among the toughest players in the league.</TE>
<TE>   * Jay Sharrers became the NHL's first black to referee a game when
he worked a Flyers-Panthers game on April 3, 2001. Sharrers had
worked 642 games as a linesman previously.</TE>
<TE>   * Ex-NHL player Graeme Townshend is the coach and director of
player personnel for the Greensboro Generals of the ECHL.</TE>
<TE>   * The Edmonton Oilers opened the 2001-02 season with four black
players on their roster, Mike Grier, Georges Laraque, Anson Carter
and Sean Brown. The St. Louis Blues began the season with three, Fred
Brathwaite, Jamal Mayers and Bryce Salvador.</TE>
<TE>   * There are 15 black players currently in the NHL.</TE>

<HD>Millikan Has Boxed-In Feeling</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Are rival coaches in the Moore League choosing to play host to the
Long Beach Millikan High boys' soccer team on smaller fields to
improve their chances of ending Millikan's Southern Section-record
unbeaten streak in league play?</LD>
<LD>   Millikan Coach Rod Petkovic says yes, but two coaches from
Lakewood say that when the Lancers played visiting Millikan to a 0-0
tie last week, it was on the same field they've played on since the
late 1980s.</LD>
<LD>   "I think you see what you perceive," said Mike Flynn, who began
his 20th season at Lakewood in November before being sidelined in
December by surgery and subsequent chemotherapy for colon cancer.
"And your view can be different when you're on the top of the heap
looking down."</LD>
<TE>   A good-size high school soccer field is 70 yards wide and 120
yards long. But Petkovic says Millikan frequently found itself
playing road games on fields measuring 50 yards in width and 110
yards in length last year, when the Rams were closing in on the
previous section record of 45 consecutive games without a loss in
league play.</TE>
<TE>   The trend has continued this season, according to Petkovic, whose
team was 20-1-2 with a 52-game unbeaten streak in league play before
Wednesday's contest at Long Beach Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   Rules do not require varsity games to be played on 70- by 120-yard
fields. But a smaller field, especially when it comes to width, makes
it easier for a team with lesser talent to defend against a team with
greater skills because it lessens the speed advantage that a superior
team might possess and makes it easier for the inferior team to
defend the area surrounding the goal.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no place to move when a team puts eight or nine guys in
the box," Petkovic said.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Brandts, who has coached the Lakewood varsity since Flynn's
surgery on Dec. 8, said the Lancers' home field is only 50 yards wide
but points out it has been that size for years because the team plays
its games on the football field.</TE>
<TE>   Lakewood's junior varsity field is larger and better maintained
than the varsity field, according to Petkovic, but Flynn said the
field has drainage problems and ruts in it.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Mason, a four-year starter for defending section Division I
champion Millikan, said he has noticed that the Rams tend to play on
smaller fields in league games on the road, but it doesn't bother him
or his teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, it's just respect," he said. "We're going into their house
and yet they're changing things to try and compete with us."</TE>
<TE>   End of the coaching line: Flynn, who started the Lakewood boys'
program the same year Petkovic founded Millikan's, said doctors gave
him a 30% to 40% chance of living longer than five years after he was
diagnosed with colon cancer.</TE>
<TE>   But no matter what happens, the 54-year-old native of Scotland
says his coaching days are over.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to return to soccer again," Flynn said.</TE>

<LD>Skip Bayless of the San Jose Mercury News writing on the Super Bowl:
"For the third time, New England will be the Big Easy in the Big
Easy. Las Vegas makes the Rams a 141/2-point favorite and forecasts a
high-scoring game with an over-under of 52.</LD>
<LD>   "But most of the points will be scored by Coach Mike Mardi Gras
and his Rams. Martz has never been shy about pouring it on. Of
course, I reserve the right to soften this prediction after a week of
dining on Eggs Belichick (a special dish being served at Brennan's
near Bourbon Street).</LD>
<LD>   "But from what I saw Sunday, the Patsies have no more chance than
the Louisiana sheriff did against James Bond in 'Live and Let Die.'"</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Why bother to watch? Drew Sharp of the Detroit Free Press agrees
with Bayless: "Maybe there will be some compelling television on PBS
around 6:18 [EST] Sunday. The migration trail of the African killer
bees might be more intriguing than what we'll see in the Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "Either way, America gets stung ... The Patriots' only chance of
averting disaster is if the explosive Rams aren't permitted inside
the Superdome as a security measure."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ho hum: Bernie Miklasz in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch: "The
Patriots are here to pursue their obligatory 15 minutes of fame, and
if they are fortunate, they can stretch their illuminated state to
halftime.</TE>
<TE>   "The Rams are here to collect their damned trophy and go home."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the Super Bowl record for most touchdown
passes in a game?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Secure hiding place: Tom FitzGerald in the San Francisco
Chronicle: "Two Cuban soccer players defected to the U.S. during the
Gold Cup tournament in Los Angeles. 'Obviously, they're pretty scared
and want to disappear,' says [reader] Mike Gaynes, 'because they've
asked to be placed not in a federal protection program but in the one
place where no one will ever find them--Major League Soccer.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Don't rile the fans: UCLA's game with Oregon tonight in the
hostile environment of McArthur Court, a.k.a. The Pit, once prompted
then-UCLA coach Gene Bartow to refer to the fans there as "deranged
idiots."</TE>
<TE>   So, on the Bruins' next visit to Eugene, an Oregon fan paraded
around the court before the game on a wooden horse carrying a sign
that proclaimed him as the "Lone De-Ranger."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1999, the Denver Broncos defeated the
Atlanta Falcons, 34-19, in Super Bowl XXXIII in Miami.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Steve Young of the San Francisco 49ers, six against
San Diego in Super Bowl XXIX.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Bernie Lincicome in the Rocky Mountain News on
visiting New Orleans: "I was here one other time during a national
crisis, when Iran grabbed American hostages. The Louisiana Superdome
had the world's largest yellow ribbon tied around it, which made it
look like an enormous puff pastry.</TE>
<TE>   "It inspired one of the great off-the-cuff lines from Beano Cook,
now an ESPN talking head, who upon hearing the returning hostages
would be given a lifetime pass to baseball blurted, 'Haven't they
suffered enough?'"</TE>

<LD>Corey Maggette suffered a strained left knee in the Clippers' victory
Tuesday against the Dallas Mavericks and is not expected to play
tonight against the San Antonio Spurs.</LD>
<LD>   Darius Miles is expected to take Maggette's place as the starting
small forward. Maggette has been filling in for Lamar Odom, on the
injured list because of a sprained right wrist.</LD>
<LD>   Maggette underwent an MRI exam Wednesday, the results of which
will be known today. Odom was examined Wednesday and the Clippers
will announce an update on his expected return today.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Miles, only 20, continues to play well. He had 13
points, took eight rebounds, added five assists and played sound
defense on Dallas' Dirk Nowitzki in 30 minutes Tuesday. Perhaps what
stood out most of all, though, was Miles' thunderous second-quarter
dunk off a lob pass from Quentin Richardson.</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   at San Antonio, 5:30</TE>
<TE>   Site--Alamodome.</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KLAC (570).</TE>
<TE>   Record--Clippers 23-23, Spurs 29-14.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Spurs--0-1.</TE>
<TE>   Update--Tonight's game matches two of the league's best scorers
and rebounders in Elton Brand of the Clippers, who has 31
double-doubles, and Tim Duncan of San Antonio (a league-leading 35).
The Spurs haven't been playing like an elite team recently at home. A
78-73 loss Tuesday to the Charlotte Hornets was the Spurs' third
consecutive at the Alamodome. They have lost six of their last 10
overall and are expected to be without David Robinson tonight.
Robinson suffered a bruised thigh Saturday against the Golden State
Warriors and did not play against the Hornets. Cherokee Parks, a
former Clipper, took Robinson's spot in the starting lineup Tuesday.
The Clippers have lost 15 in a row to the Spurs, last winning Dec. 4,
1997 at the Sports Arena.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Investigative Reports, Special Edition: Wide Open: Inside
the World of High School Football"</LD>
<LD>   Where: A&amp;E, Friday, 9 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   This two-hour documentary isn't about injuries, deaths,
recruiting, cheating or anything else that is bad about high school
football. It's about the good, about what young men can gain from a
team sport.</TE>
<TE>   The A&amp;E film follows two high school teams through a season.</TE>
<TE>   One team is from the Texas prairie town of Stephenville, located
amid cattle ranches and dairy farms in a place where high school
football is king. The athletic facilities are better than those at
many colleges, games attract 10,000 fans and after games players and
students attend church dances.</TE>
<TE>   The other team is Jefferson High in South Central Los Angeles,
where the players practice on a dirt field, have to clean the
graffiti off their lockers and, as star running back Trey Jackson
says, "Pray every night just to wake up the next morning."</TE>
<TE>   The two coaches, Jefferson's Hank Johnson, a 20-year veteran, and
Stephenville's Mike Copeland, are featured, along with several
players from both teams. Stephenville linebacker Scott Lee worries
about such things as what college will give him a full-ride
scholarship. Jefferson quarterback John Brown, who became a father at
16, has different kinds of worries.</TE>
<TE>   Stephenville has one minority player, black receiver Jeremy
Madkins, the son of a strict Baptist minister. Almost all of
Jefferson's players are black. Stephenville, which has won four state
championships, has a winning season; Jefferson does not.</TE>
<TE>   But the similarities between the teams are amazing. Both coaches
emphasize they're teaching their players to be winners in the game of
life, instilling a sense of discipline, respect, pride and teamwork,
and giving them the tools to become good citizens.</TE>

<HD>Dorsey Suffers for Role in Fight</HD>
<DH>Basketball: Two players suspended and Dons banned from
playoffs for scuffle that halted game against Gardena Serra.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Dorsey High boys' basketball players have been suspended for
their role in a December scuffle with Gardena Serra players and the
Dons have been declared ineligible for the playoffs, City Section
assistant commissioner Jeff Halpern said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Reserves Garnett Pickens and Michael Ledwith-Ball were suspended
for the remainder of the season and Dorsey, which lost its first
Coliseum League game on Wednesday, has been placed on probation for
the same span. The players fought during the intersectional game at
King-Drew High in Los Angeles that resulted in injuries to players
from both teams.</LD>
<LD>   The game was called after the third quarter with Serra leading,
54-45. Dorsey will take a loss in the game, but does not have to
forfeit any victories.</LD>
<TE>   No action has been taken against Serra.</TE>
<TE>   The Dons fell, 76-67, to Fremont on Wednesday but still lead the
Coliseum League standings at 6-1. Fremont and Crenshaw, which play
Feb. 8 for what could be the No. 1 league seeding into the City
Section playoffs, are tied for second at 5-2.</TE>
<TE>   Fremont (18-4) handed the Dons the defeat Wednesday by outscoring
Dorsey, 23-9, in the third quarter to build a 58-42 lead. Mark
Bradford led the Pathfinders with 17 points and Daaron Brown finished
with 14 points and 12 rebounds for Fremont, which lost, 75-70, at
Dorsey on Jan. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "The difference this time was time management," said Fremont's
Shelvion Williams, who scored eight points. "We controlled the ball
for most of the game. In the second half, we boxed out, we took good
shots and we pressed them. We had something to prove to them and we
did."</TE>
<TE>   Drew Gibson led the Dons (14-5) with 19 points. . Donald Wilson
had 14 points and Gary Hamilton added 12 for Dorsey. Leading scorer
Eric Flournoy was held to two points.</TE>

<LD>There has been a noticeable difference in the Mighty Ducks' top line
for a little more than a week. They are scoring goals.</LD>
<LD>   All season, Coach Bryan Murray has been trying to find a pair of
forwards who could take the pressure of right wing Paul Kariya.
Center Andy McDonald and left wing Mike Leclerc seem to be doing the
job.</LD>
<LD>   Before Wednesday's game with Columbus, the Ducks' top line a goal
in the six games since Leclerc joined McDonald and Kariya.</LD>
<TE>   Leclerc's size (6 feet 2, 208 pounds) has meshed well with the
smaller, quicker Kariya and McDonald.</TE>
<TE>   "When you play against a tough defensive team, it helps to have
Mike out there to get some grinding stuff and some plays behind the
net," Kariya said. "He does a great job in front of the net in
creating the dirty kind of goals that we've been getting lately."</TE>
<TE>   Leclerc was one of several players tried out on the top line
earlier this season. This time, moving Leclerc to Kariya's line has
worked. Leclerc has scored four of the line's six goals in the
five-game streak.</TE>
<TE>   "They are a creative line," Murray said. "Mike Leclerc has really
provided some energy and size. Andy and Paul are small, but they play
like a bugger."</TE>
<TE>   The line added to its numbers in the second period Wednesday when
McDonald scored off an assist from Leclerc.</TE>
<TE>   Columbus' center Espen Knutsen, a former Duck, was named to the
World team for the All-Star game, which will be played Saturday at
Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Knutsen had eight goals and 31 points in 49 games before
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   He replaces Dallas' Jere Lehtinen, who is injured. Knutsen is the
first Norwegian to play in the NHL All-Star game.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what to expect, really," Knutsen told reporters
Tuesday. "Actually, I'm kind of nervous about all of this. To be
around all those great players."</TE>

<HD>Ducks Keep It Going</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Anaheim beats Columbus, 3-1, to reach break with
five-game win streak.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now the Mighty Ducks can consider themselves hot.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, victories over Dallas and St. Louis in the last week are
fine moments. Beating two of league's better teams on the road looks
good on any team's resume. But a victory over the Columbus Blue
Jackets, that falls into the special category.</LD>
<LD>   The only team that has dominated the Ducks more is the Detroit Red
Wings. Yet Wednesday the Ducks treated the Blue Jackets like the
second-year expansion team they are in a 3-1 victory.</LD>
<TE>   Jeff Friesen, Andy McDonald and Matt Cullen scored goals in front
of an announced crowd of 9,498 at the Arrowhead Pond.</TE>
<TE>   The fans got a glimpse of a confident Duck team.</TE>
<TE>   They didn't crumble when down, played aggressively with the lead
and cruised into the All-Star break with a season-high five-game
winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   It's the Ducks' longest streak since winning seven consecutive
games during the 1998-99 season.</TE>
<TE>   "We've played well defensively basically the whole season," team
captain Paul Kariya said. "We do a good job penalty killing and
keeping the other team from creating chances. It's just a matter of
just getting some goals."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks got their goals Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Leclerc fought off two Columbus players in the corner and
slid the puck to McDonald, who drove the net. McDonald's backhand
shot at the crease beat goalie Ron Tugnutt to give the Ducks a 2-1
lead 15 minute 17 seconds into the second period.</TE>
<TE>   The goal gave the Ducks' top line at least one goal in the six
games since Leclerc joined McDonald and Kariya.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike made a great play, he battled in the corner and then made a
great pass," McDonald said.</TE>
<TE>   Cullen then gave the Ducks what they have lacked so often this
season ... a third goal.</TE>
<TE>   He re-directed a Jason York shot for a power-play goal 1:22 into
the third period for a 3-1 lead. It was Cullen's fourth goal in four
games.</TE>
<TE>   "Early in the year, every game was 2-1 or 3-2," Coach Bryan Murray
said. "We couldn't get that third goal. We are finally scoring enough
goals."</TE>
<TE>   Against a team that has made life difficult for the Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Jackets, last in the Western Conference, may be the lamb
in every other team's petting zoo. But the Ducks haven't been able to
touch them. In the seven previous games, Columbus has never failed to
take away at least a point in a game with the Ducks, going 6-0-0-1.</TE>
<TE>   "They play a patient game and we always seem to try to do too much
against them," Duck defenseman Jason York said.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks' only other shining moment against Columbus was a 5-4
overtime victory Dec. 13, 2001. The next day, the Ducks fired Coach
Craig Hartsburg.</TE>
<TE>   Murray could sleep soundly.</TE>
<TE>   "We asked them to do certain things and to work hard," Murray
said. "As coaches, all we want right now is good discipline and hard
work. It taken a while, but everyone is buying in."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks were coming off three consecutive road victories,
including ones at Dallas and St. Louis, and proceeded to put
themselves in a hole.</TE>
<TE>   Ruslan Salei took a holding penalty 42 seconds into the game.
Keith Carney, the Ducks' steadiest and most experienced defenseman,
then made a rookie-like mistake. He tried to clear the puck from
behind the net, but centered a pass to Columbus' Mike Sillinger
instead, who scored.</TE>

<HD>Costa Rica Is a 3-1 Winner</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Central Americans advance to CONCACAF Gold Cup
title game by eliminating South Korea.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hernan Medford is 33 now, a little long in the tooth for an
international soccer player and certainly for a forward. But the lone
survivor from Costa Rica's memorable 1990 World Cup team still
commands a starting place, and on Wednesday night he showed why.</LD>
<LD>   True, the penalty kick that he sent soaring into the night sky at
the Rose Bowl, to the dismay of the Costa Rican fans, was not his
finest moment.</LD>
<LD>   But the 37th-minute faux pas was a momentary lapse, nothing more.
Seven minutes later, the bald-headed Medford, a fast, powerful and
crafty player, made up for the miss.</LD>
<TE>   Taking a pass out on the right flank from midfielder Harold
Wallace, Medford shrugged off a late-arriving South Korean defender
and sent a perfect pass into the goal area.</TE>
<TE>   There, teammate Ronald Gomez got to the ball seconds before
defender Choi Jin-Cheul's sliding tackle and Gomez first-timed the
ball into the back of the net from about seven yards. Goalkeeper Kim
Byung-Ji had no chance.</TE>
<TE>   The goal was all Costa Rica needed to put it on the road to
victory. Paulo Wanchope scored twice in a five-minute span in the
second half and the Central Americans advanced to Saturday's
championship game of the sixth CONCACAF Gold Cup with a convincing
3-1 victory.</TE>
<TE>   In the second game, the United States and Canada played to a
scoreless tie in regulation and the match entered sudden-death
overtime to decide the second finalist. The Americans had dominated
play but could not find a way to beat Canadian goalkeeper Lars
Hirschfeld.</TE>
<TE>   The Costa Ricans, who will play Brazil, China and Turkey in the
World Cup this summer, appeared to be initially surprised by the
speed of the South Koreans, but once they realized that the Asian
side's game is based on quickness and tenacity but lacks a finishing
touch, they settled to the task.</TE>
<TE>   That said, it should have been the Koreans who took the lead. For
reasons known only to him, referee Rodolfo Sibrian of El Salvador did
not call Costa Rican defender Mauricio Solis for a foul after he
shoved down Choi Tae-Uk from behind in the 34th minute.</TE>
<TE>   The South Koreans did not protest the non-call, but they were
furious three minutes later when Sibrian awarded Costa Rica a penalty
kick for an alleged hand ball after Wanchope had fired a cross
directly onto the arm of defender Song Chong-Gug.</TE>
<TE>   It appeared to be a case of ball to hand, rather than hand to
ball, but the penalty award stood. Justice was served, however, when
Medford blasted the ball high over the crossbar from 12 yards.</TE>
<TE>   One minute before halftime, Gomez scored and it appeared Costa
Rica would take charge in the second 45 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, it was the South Koreans who battled back. Although they
were the more determined team, the Asian side had a puzzling
inability to put the ball in the net.</TE>
<TE>   But Costa Rica scored twice on counterattacks.</TE>
<TE>   Wanchope made it 2-0 in the 77th minute when he took a pass from
Wallace and fired the ball at goalkeeper Kim, who got down to block
the shot only to see the ball bounce off his body and into the net.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea finally ended its scoring drought in the 81st minute
when Choi scrambled the ball into the Costa Rican net while lying on
the ground after his first shot had been blocked.</TE>
<TE>   Wanchope answered within seconds, latching onto a pass and sending
a rising rocket of a shot into he roof of the Korean net to secure
Costa Rica's place in the championship game.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very happy," said the team's Brazilian coach, Alexandre
Guimares. "We wanted to have a game like this, against a team that
pushed us to play better, to show the quality of the team."</TE>
<TE>   The three World Cup-bound teams each face a far more significant
tests in two weeks. The U.S. plays three-time world champion Italy in
Catania, Sicily, on Feb. 13, the same day that Costa Rica plays
two-time world champion Argentina in Miami and South Korea plays
two-time world champion Uruguay in Montevideo, Uruguay.</TE>
<TE>   Attendance showed a steep decline from the first four game days at
the Rose Bowl. Those games drew a total of 117,895 fans, or an
average of 29,473.</TE>
<TE>   But with Mexico, El Salvador and Guatemala all eliminated, the
crowd dropped to about 10,000 Wednesday night.</TE>

<DL>PEBBLE BEACH</DL>
<LD>Jeff Julian is playing his second AT&amp;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, beginning
today. He played it last year, and with any luck, he would like to
play again next year. The odds don't look too good, though.</LD>
<LD>   Julian doesn't want to miss it and it's easy to know why. The
scene at Pebble Beach is always refreshing, with the views of the
ocean and its salty spray, the sea lions flopping around in the
shallow water, cypress trees framing a near-perfect panorama.</LD>
<LD>   Julian is going to take it all in. He wants to remember all of it.
He would like to tell the story for years to come, if he has that
long.</LD>
<TE>   Julian has amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly known as Lou
Gehrig's disease. The 40-year-old former touring pro has a sponsor's
exemption to play this week. And he feels fortunate to be able to tee
it up.</TE>
<TE>   "I am lucky I can still play, that's the way I look at it," Julian
said. "I thought that if I could touch someone out there who sees me,
it might start a chain reaction that leads to a cure."</TE>
<TE>   There is no cure for ALS and the survival statistics are not
favorable. Fifty percent of ALS victims die within 18 months of being
diagnosed. Only 20% survive five years.</TE>
<TE>   Julian noticed a sharp pain in his shoulder in April and had
trouble swallowing. Not long after, doctors at Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore gave Julian the news he had no reason to
expect. Now, Julian is making the most of his golf.</TE>
<TE>   It's not at all like 1996, his first and only year on the PGA Tour
when he didn't know his way around. Julian lost his card and played
the next three years on the Buy.com Tour, but last year, he won only
$55,132 and lost his playing privileges on that tour too.</TE>
<TE>   On this level, there are far worse things than losing a tour card.
And at least for this week, Julian has a place to play.</TE>
<TE>   Open Up</TE>
<TE>   Is the U.S. Open coming to Riviera in 2008?</TE>
<TE>   Michael Yamaki of Riviera and representatives from Torrey Pines
will pitch their cases at the USGA meeting this weekend in Colorado
Springs and it is considered likely that the 2008 Open is going to be
held at one of the two courses in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   The only other time the Open was held at Riviera was 1948 when Ben
Hogan won. Torrey Pines has not staged an Open.</TE>
<TE>   Both Riviera and Torrey Pines have undergone extensive course
renovations in the past year with the idea of attracting an Open.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of the USGA toured last month and told Riviera
officials that the notion of an Open being held at the Pacific
Palisades layout is a matter of "when, not if." No decision is
expected before June.</TE>
<TE>   Casey Update</TE>
<TE>   Casey Martin says he hopes to play again in March in two Buy.com
events in Australia, if all goes well. If he doesn't play in
Australia, Martin is looking at playing the Buy.com Tour in Louisiana
in April.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm feeling so much better," Martin said. "I'm getting around by
myself."</TE>
<TE>   Martin is resting at home in Eugene, Ore., three weeks after he
had emergency surgery because of a potentially fatal bacterial
infection. Martin developed the infection after the second of two
operations to improve blood flow in his right leg, affected by a
degenerative circulatory disease.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had three weeks of torture," Martin said. "But it could have
been worse. I'm glad they got it when they did. It was touch and go
for a while. It could have gone either way."</TE>
<TE>   Martin, 29, won a Supreme Court decision last year that allowed
him to use a cart while playing.</TE>
<TE>   He lost his Buy.com Tour card when he made only nine of 21 cuts
and won $17,197. He can play with sponsor's exemptions this year.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Update</TE>
<TE>   Everything Tiger Woods does is news and that includes when he
stays in bed, which is what he did Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Woods, who usually takes the first tee time in the morning for a
practice round, instead waited until the afternoon to play the back
nine at Poppy Hills. Woods had been resting to try to shake off the
effects of flu-like symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   Woods, who hasn't played a PGA Tour event since he tied for 10th
at the Mercedes Championship the first week of January, might not be
at full strength. He said he broke his fever on his second hole.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a little bit under the weather," said Woods, who then
coughed. "I'll be all right. I'm not on my deathbed or anything."</TE>
<TE>   Woods said he had only small goals in his nine-hole practice
round.</TE>
<TE>   "Just slapped the ball around, tried to get a feel for playing
again, tried to get a feel for the course," said Woods, who expects
bumpy greens and cold weather. "Just like always," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Woods and his amateur partner, former Stanford teammate Jerry
Chang, have a 9:10 a.m. tee time today at Poppy Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Programming Note</TE>
<TE>   Dumb move of the week: The last half-hour of CBS' telecast of
Sunday's final round at Pebble Beach goes head-to-head with the Super
Bowl and its 3:15 p.m. PST kickoff on Fox.</TE>
<TE>   Justin Time</TE>
<TE>   Good move of the week: Justin Leonard is getting married Saturday,
thus guaranteeing he will never forget the date of his
anniversary--02/02/02.</TE>
<TE>   Ty One On</TE>
<TE>   Bad rumor of the week: Ty Tryon was supposedly offered $1 million
to play at Dubai. Not true.</TE>
<TE>   And he's not going to Dubai, either. Tryon is going to play the
Honda Classic instead.</TE>
<TE>   Daly News</TE>
<TE>   News item: John Daly, who joins the European PGA Tour, make his
debut at the Heineken Classic in Melbourne.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: Perfect.</TE>
<TE>   Youngsters</TE>
<TE>   For what it's worth, Charles Howell is a combined 186 under par
since the 2001 U.S. Open at Southern Hills, where he missed the cut.</TE>
<TE>   Howell, 22, David Gossett, 22, and Matt Kuchar, 23, have entered
the Nissan Open in two weeks at Riviera.</TE>
<TE>   Nickname</TE>
<TE>   Howell has picked one up. Last week at Phoenix, he answered to
"Thurston," for Thurston Howell, the character played by Jim Backus
on "Gilligan's Island." Davis Love III says he and Howell would make
a good best-ball team.</TE>
<TE>   Said Love: "Think of it ... Thurston and Lovey."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Lovey was the name of Backus' wife on the show.</TE>
<TE>   Remembering Payne</TE>
<TE>   Peter Jacobsen is using Payne Stewart's former caddie, Mike Hicks,
this week.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobsen has two bag tags--one celebrating the late Jack Lemmon,
Jacobsen's longtime partner, and the other from the 2000 AT&amp;T, when
Stewart was honored.</TE>
<TE>   Numbers Game</TE>
<TE>   The number of Crosbys still associated with the AT&amp;T tournament is
down to one. Nathaniel Crosby resigned recently from the Monterey
Peninsula Golf Foundation, which governs the tournament, because he
couldn't attend enough meetings. Nathaniel Crosby's older brother,
Harry, remains on the board.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>All signs pointed to a successful season for the Riverside King
girls' soccer team.</LD>
<LD>   Several players returned from a squad that relied on a stalwart
defense and just-enough offense to win the Sunkist League
championship and reach the second round of the playoffs last season,
the program's first.</LD>
<LD>   And there were Tina Cochran's flying fingers and hand-hewn
sentences, which spoke volumes.</LD>
<TE>   Cochran, a sophomore left midfielder who earned all-league honors
as a fullback last season, enrolled in an American Sign Language
course last fall at Riverside City College.</TE>
<TE>   It is a class for which she received early college credit and,
after some misgivings, Coach Lance Riley's blessing.</TE>
<TE>   "We kind of prided ourselves on our defense last year, and my
all-league defender comes to me and says she's taking this class,"
Riley recalled.</TE>
<TE>   "I went, 'You're going to miss practice every Wednesday during the
season?' I kind of freaked out and wasn't too happy at first."</TE>
<TE>   But he understood why Cochran enrolled in the course.</TE>
<TE>   Her mother, Martha, was born deaf and is still hearing-impaired
despite receiving a cochlear implant in her right ear last year.</TE>
<TE>   The family always said a lot without speaking and signing was no
foreign language.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm used to signing," Tina Cochran said. "I didn't know the whole
book, but I knew enough to get around."</TE>
<TE>   She plans to enroll for the second part of the course when the
spring semester begins in two weeks, but the winter break has allowed
Cochran to practice throughout league play and helped ease her
coach's concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Cochran's willingness to sit out the start of Thursday games in
accordance with team rules regarding missed practices and her smooth
transition from fullback to midfielder have also helped.</TE>
<TE>   "Before I found out I would have this break, I just assumed I was
going to miss half of every game on Thursdays, and I was OK with
that," said Cochran, who has three goals and three assists.</TE>
<TE>   "I know soccer's not a career for me, and sign language was
something I was doing for fun. But it's got the added benefit that
I'm getting college credit for it."</TE>
<TE>   Young guns: The development of freshman forwards Miranda Montejo
and Kelleye Lazarus and sophomore midfielders Laila Gramalki and
Jessica Aquino has helped King to a 19-2 record, 6-0 in the Sunkist
League.</TE>
<TE>   Montejo leads the Wolves with 19 goals and 10 assists.</TE>
<TE>   Lazarus has 19 goals and five assists. Gramalki has a team-high 18
assists to go with two goals, and Aquino has 10 assists and five
goals.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore goalkeeper Raegan Finnie has 15 shutouts.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of streaks: Westlake High is in the midst of an 11-game
unbeaten streak that has given the Warriors the Marmonte League lead.</TE>
<TE>   Westlake (11-3-2, 6-0-1), ranked seventh in Division II, scored
key victories this week over Moorpark and Simi Valley. Westlake tied
Simi Valley, 0-0, two weeks ago.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Earlier in the Santa Anita meet, trainer Bobby Frankel had the classy
Lord Flasheart ready to fire after an extended layoff.</LD>
<LD>   The bay horse, who had been away since June 2000, beat a solid
field in an allowance race Dec. 30, including the well-regarded South
American Straight Flush.</LD>
<LD>   Frankel will try to repeat the feat this afternoon when Beat
Hollow makes his long-awaited U.S. debut in today's seventh, a
11/8-mile turf allowance that drew five others.</LD>
<TE>   Away since winning a Group I at Longchamp in France on June 25,
2000, Beat Hollow is the 4-5 favorite on Jeff Tufts' morning line as
he goes for his fourth win in his fifth start.</TE>
<TE>   A 5-year-old son of Sadler's Wells owned by Juddmonte Farms, Beat
Hollow will race on Lasix for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   Besides his victory in the Grand Prix de Paris, the bay horse
broke his maiden at first asking at Yarmouth in England on Sept. 16,
1999, and won a listed stakes at Newmarket on May 5, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   If Beat Hollow is upset, the most likely winner is Little Ghazi. A
6-year-old gelding, he has won two in a row since arriving in
California and has won 10 of 26 on the grass in a career that began
in New York. Claimed for $80,000 earlier in the month by Pat
Gallagher, Little Ghazi again will be ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the field are Sign Of Hope, Lily's Lad, a four-time
winner on the turf, Green Jaro and longshot Res Judicata.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The fourth is for cheap fillies and mares, but
the 51/2-furlong dash looks wide open. The 3-1 choice on the morning
line is the comebacking My Bouquet.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Greg Gilchrist. He has the highest winning percentage
of any trainer in the top 10 at Golden Gate Fields. The veteran won
with 11 of his first 38 starters at the meet.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not:  Inspector Tennison. The World Stage filly has been
blitzed in all four of her races and figures to get pounded again in
today's fourth at Gulfstream Park.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking:  A pick four using Patio Boy and Buzzword in
the fifth, Lake Perris Red and While We're Here in the sixth,
singling Beat Hollow in the seventh and Shadow Face, Lady Boundary,
My Darling Brocco and Hurry Up Haleigh in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous Day/Meet Total: 2/75. Money: Previous Day/Meet
Total: $12.80/$486.40. Total money bet: $444.</TE>

<HD>Taylor Looks for Forward</HD>

<DL>ST. PAUL, Minn.</DL>
<LD>General Manager Dave Taylor is still hoping to make a trade to add a
top-six forward to the King roster for the stretch run, but Taylor
said Wednesday from Los Angeles that nothing is imminent.</LD>
<LD>   "We're not particularly close to anything," he said. "We'll
continue to see what's out there between now and the [March 19] trade
deadline. Right now, it's pretty competitive around the league and
everybody's still somewhat in the hunt.</LD>
<LD>   "There's not a lot of movement."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coach Andy Murray, while also questioning a few calls made against
his team, said the Kings put themselves in a bad position Saturday
and Monday, giving the Colorado Avalanche 15 power-play opportunities
in two games.</TE>
<TE>   In splitting the two games, the Avalanche scored five power-play
goals against the Kings' league-leading penalty-killing unit.</TE>
<TE>   "We're playing pretty good because we're playing aggressive,"
Murray said. "The thing you have to eliminate are some of the
unnecessary penalties. To take a penalty, it should be something you
have to do to stop a goal or a matter of trying to change momentum by
doing something physically to assert yourself or get your team going.
Those are necessary penalties.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to eliminate the unnecessary penalties--the holding the
stick, interference because you're not in good position, hooking
because you're not moving your feet. Stuff like that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Kings claimed former Mighty Duck winger Ted Donato off waivers
from the New York Islanders and put defenseman Mathieu Schneider on
the injured list because of a left shoulder strain.</TE>
<TE>   Donato, 32, was loaned to the Kings' American Hockey League team
at Manchester, N.H., for conditioning purposes. He is expected to
join the Kings on Sunday for their first practice after the All-Star
break.</TE>
<TE>   After signing a 25-game tryout contract with Manchester, Donato
scored 32 points in 25 games with the Monarchs before the Islanders
signed him Jan. 16.</TE>
<TE>   He played one game with the Islanders before they waived him.</TE>
<TE>   Schneider, 32, will be eligible to come off the injured list after
Monday night's game against the Philadelphia Flyers at Staples
Center.</TE>

<HD>Kings on Road to Easy Street</HD>
<DH>Hockey: They head into All-Star break by beating Minnesota
for 11th victory in last 15 away games.</DH>

<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. PAUL, Minn.</DL>
<LD>When most teams hit the road, the road hits back.</LD>
<LD>   Not the Kings.</LD>
<LD>   Not in the last two months.</LD>
<TE>   Continuing their exemplary road work Wednesday night, the Kings
got 20 saves from Felix Potvin and goals from Philippe Boucher and
Nelson Emerson in a 2-0 victory over the Minnesota Wild before 18,658
in the Xcel Energy Center.</TE>
<TE>   During a 17-5-3 surge that has taken them from six games below
.500 on the morning of Dec. 9 to six games above .500 heading into
the All-Star break today, the Kings are 11-2-2 on the road. And with
a 14-9-4-1 record outside of Staples Center, they have earned more
points on the road than any other team in the NHL.</TE>
<TE>   Their latest victory gave them an 11-3 record in January,
including a 7-1 mark on the road, setting a club record for victories
in a month.</TE>
<TE>   They earned their three-day break--they'll reconvene for practice
Sunday in El Segundo before playing the Philadelphia Flyers on Monday
night at Staples Center--by matching an 11-year-old club record for
points in a month.</TE>
<TE>   So, will a hiatus halt their run?</TE>
<TE>   Or will it revitalize them?</TE>
<TE>   "I think right now is a good time to take a break," said
defenseman Mattias Norstrom after the Kings had completed their first
22-point month since a Wayne Gretzky-led team went 10-2-2 in February
1991. "It's great that we're rolling, but I think right now for
everybody in this league it's a good time for a break."</TE>
<TE>   Said Potvin: "I think everybody's going to come back fresher. We
had a [two-day] break at Christmas and we came back and had this
[record-setting] month. So, hopefully, we can recharge and do it
again."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings had lost at Montreal in the last game before their
Christmas break, and Coach Andy Murray made a point of reminding them
early Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We let two points slip away on us late in that game," Murray said
he told his players before the game. "That shouldn't have happened.
The break starts tomorrow. Tonight, we've got to work and battle a
hard-working team."</TE>
<TE>   Duly advised, the Kings bottled up the slumping Wild from the
start, beating Coach Jacques Lemaire's second-year expansion team for
the second time in six days and extending its winless streak to six
games.</TE>
<TE>   The shutout was the Kings' fourth of the month, Potvin's third.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the bottom line is, when our team plays that well, we
make the goaltender's job a little bit easier," Murray said.
"Certainly, our goaltenders have been good. And we've been good for
our goalies."</TE>
<TE>   After a scoreless first period, Boucher gave the Kings the lead
with a power-play goal at 8:07 of the second period, taking a pretty
pass from Emerson and rifling a shot from the left faceoff circle
past goaltender Dwayne Roloson.</TE>
<TE>   Emerson, who contemplated retirement last fall while he sat out 22
games because of a concussion, scored his second goal in five games
with 11:50 to play, a long tip-in giving the veteran winger his first
multiple point game of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "He's showing lots of jump right now," Murray said. "When you come
as close as he did with that concussion to not knowing where things
are at in your career, you get that real passion for the game, and
he's always been a real passionate player. I think he's really
showing that right now."</TE>
<TE>   Said Emerson: "You sit and kind of take everything in, put
everything in perspective [when you're 34 and sidelined for a long
period]. It gives you a little sense of where you're at when you come
back, for sure."</TE>
<TE>   High in the slot, Emerson tipped in a shot from the left point by
rookie Andreas Lilja. Lilja's assist, after Boucher's goal, was the
second point of the game for the King defense, the league's
highest-scoring blue-line corps with 110 points.</TE>
<TE>   "We talk about the need for our defensemen to get involved in the
play because in this league now, you need your defensemen to be
involved in the offense if you're going to score," Murray said. "We
work in practice on that all the time. Probably no more than any
other team, but for whatever reason, it seems to work for us."</TE>

<HD>Fisher Will Do What's Best for All</HD>

<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>At the conclusion of a very trying, very emotional year, the last
place Derek Fisher figured to find himself was on the Laker bench.</LD>
<LD>   So, when Phil Jackson came to him a week ago and put him there,
Fisher momentarily lost his breath.</LD>
<LD>   Jackson wanted Lindsey Hunter in the starting lineup, and while
Fisher hasn't lost a lot of playing time to the decision, clearly the
starting status meant something to him.</LD>
<TE>   One of the most approachable Lakers, Fisher refused to publicly
discuss his role change until Wednesday night, an hour before his
fourth game as a reserve.</TE>
<TE>   "The most frustrating part about the situation is we haven't
played well as a group," Fisher said. "Whatever decision Phil makes
... I'm OK with that as long as the group is playing well.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact we struggled, that's what made it hard to deal with."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers had lost two in a row and five of seven when Hunter
replaced Fisher, and they are 3-1 since. Jackson had always believed
Hunter would be more effective as a starter. It also put Fisher, a
triangle veteran, with the second team, where he could lend a sure
hand.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Fisher retook his starting position almost immediately upon
returning from foot surgery, his second procedure in nine months, and
never considered losing it.</TE>
<TE>   After all, hadn't he been a critical part of things when the
Lakers concluded last season with 23 wins in 24 games?</TE>
<TE>   "That's the feeling that I had," he said, "like I really had
improved and put myself in a position where I could be a starter in
this league. So, I didn't know where it came from.</TE>
<TE>   "[But] it's not new. I just have to go through this adjustment
period again."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hunter, who has a strained lower back, played 15 minutes and did
not score against the Magic.... Fisher sprained his left ankle
slightly late in the third quarter and missed the start of the fourth
quarter while it was retaped.</TE>

<HD>Laker Rally Says  a Lot</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Late 25-4 run is the key to 111-93 victory
over Magic. O'Neal scores 30, but he isn't too impressed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal scored 30 points and the Lakers found their
fourth-quarter sensibilities on Wednesday night, a combination that
might eventually improve the mood of a certain dour center.</LD>
<LD>   But, although O'Neal spoke to the masses for the first time in
more than two weeks, and he smiled for the folks of his adopted
hometown, he was not ready to love these Lakers after a choppy eight
weeks.</LD>
<LD>   "Not yet," O'Neal said. "Not yet. But I'll be able to tell around
March and April. ... We lose to [bad]  teams and all that stuff. But,
around March or April, I'll be able to tell."</LD>
<TE>   On the broad back of O'Neal, the Lakers defeated his former
Orlando Magic, 111-93, at TD Waterhouse Centre, where he also had 14
rebounds. Despite playing two consecutive nights, the kind of thing
that irritates his arthritic and sensitive big toe, O'Neal was
powerful and accurate on offense; he made 13 of 19 attempts and had
four assists.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers scored the first 12 points of the fourth quarter and
from late in the third to well into the fourth they outscored the
Magic, 25-4. It was a disturbing way to lose for the Magic, which
could not defend itself against O'Neal and still led by 11 points
with nine minutes left in the third quarter. It did not go well after
that.</TE>
<TE>   "We had too many guys hanging their heads," Magic Coach Doc Rivers
said.</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant scored 15 of his 23 points in the final 18 minutes.
The Magic shot 45% for three quarters, then missed its first eight
shots of the fourth quarter, when it shot 29.2%, and lost its seventh
consecutive game to the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando was  seven for 15 from the three-point arc in the first
half, four for 16 in the second.</TE>
<TE>   So, the Lakers are 2-1 on a trip that still has Memphis and Dallas
ahead, and O'Neal has come out of his shell, and Phil Jackson finally
got his fourth quarter back.</TE>
<TE>   "We made up for the fact that we were on our heels for much of the
night," Jackson allowed. "The contrasts in games and the contrasts in
outside versus inside was very obvious. I called a couple of timeouts
and yelled at the team for not going inside. But the Magic were
really packing it in."</TE>
<TE>   He'd harped frequently lately on their recent careless fourth
quarters, particularly in the midst of losses to Chicago, Miami,
Denver and the Clippers in that dismal 11 days. They stood Wednesday
two points behind the Magic at the start of the fourth, then rode
Orlando from the defensive side. Devean George denied the ball to
Tracy McGrady, and Brian Shaw had a key steal, and the Magic players
became unsure of themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "We picked up our defense a little bit," O'Neal said. "In the
first half, they shot the lights out, but we knew we had a chance.
They weren't shooting the same in the second half and we just got it
inside and Kobe lit it up."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson sat O'Neal for the first three minutes of the final
quarter, by which time the Lakers had scored the first eight points.
Bryant, who missed a breakaway dunk in the first half, had two loud
ones in the fourth quarter, sending Magic fans into the night.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant missed 14 of 23 field-goal attempts, most of the kind that
fell Tuesday in Atlanta. But, being Bryant, , he kept firing, and his
offense pushed the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "I was persistent," he said. "Being persistent was the key.</TE>
<TE>   "It's weird. But you knew because you were hot for a week, you
knew it can come back really quickly."</TE>
<TE>   George scored 13 points and Rick Fox scored 12.</TE>
<TE>   Former Laker Horace Grant, the Magic's best interior player, was
said to be suffering from an intestinal virus and he stayed home, and
the Lakers got a huge kick out of that.</TE>
<TE>   A few had predicted at the afternoon shoot-around that Grant might
come down with something, seeing that Patrick Ewing was on the
injured list, leaving only Grant and Shaq and a national television
audience. Veteran savvy, they called it, amused. They had figured
back spasms.</TE>
<TE>   On the greaseboard in the Laker locker room, "Where's Horace?" was
written in what looked very much to be Jackson's hand. Beneath it,
someone else wrote, "Shaq-arhea."</TE>
<TE>   It's like Shaq-itis, but doesn't travel as well.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't blame Horace," Jackson had said. . "And I'll miss him
tonight."</TE>
<TE>   For a lot of the game, the Laker defensive strategy appeared to be
to leave the Magic shooters open and hope they missed. Pat Garrity
made a lot of shots that way. He scored 22 points, which held off the
Lakers while McGrady worked up his offensive appetite. McGrady also
scored 22, only three in the fourth quarter, when it all went wrong
for him.</TE>

<LD>This is the team Allen Iverson expected to see before the season
started.</LD>
<LD>   Iverson scored 38 points and Derrick Coleman had 18 points and
nine rebounds, leading the Philadelphia 76ers past the Minnesota
Timberwolves, 96-91, Wednesday night at Philadelphia.</LD>
<LD>   The 76ers have won 11 of 15 this month.</LD>
<TE>   "We're just coming together as a team," Iverson said. "We're
understanding where we need to be on the floor. We understand how to
win with each other. This team is so much different than last
[season]. Last [season] we could be 10 points behind with two, three
minutes left and we just knew we'd win. We just have to get that
fight like last [season]. The new guys want to get that fight because
they don't want to be a loose link."</TE>
<TE>   Wally Szczerbiak had 31 points and Kevin Garnett had 18 points and
nine rebounds for Minnesota, which has lost four of five.</TE>
<TE>   Utah 90, Chicago 78--Karl Malone scored 18 points for the Jazz at
Salt Lake City, putting him squarely at 34,000 in his 17-year career.</TE>
<TE>   John Stockton had 16 points and 10 assists for Utah. Rookie Andre
Kirilenko had 15 points.</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Robinson led the Bulls with 18 points.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana 83, Memphis 82--Jalen Rose scored 25 points, Jermaine

<HD>Agassi Splits With Longtime Coach Gilbert</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lisa Dillman</AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Andre Agassi's season of upheaval continued Wednesday with the
announcement of his split with longtime Coach Brad Gilbert, raising
questions about Agassi's future in the game.</LD>
<LD>   Though Agassi, 31, has not hit a ball in sanctioned tournament
action in 2002, he already has made plenty of news. Earlier this
month, he withdrew on the eve of the Australian Open with an injured
right wrist and returned home. Gilbert and Agassi had forged a
beneficial partnership, starting with a casual arrangement after a
dinner in March 1994. Since then, Agassi has won six Grand Slam
singles titles, including four in the last three years, became No. 1
and won an Olympic gold medal at Atlanta in 1996.</LD>
<LD>   "Brad is clearly the greatest coach of all time," Agassi said in a
statement from Las Vegas. "I have been lucky to have him as my
guiding force during the past eight years of my career. More
importantly, I am lucky that I have been able to call him friend for
eight years and that our friendship remains intact."</LD>
<TE>   There have been questions about Agassi's continued commitment to
tennis after the Australian withdrawal. It is believed that the
decision to make this split was made in the last couple of days.</TE>
<TE>   "It has no ramifications on whether Andre is going to continue,"
said his manager, Perry Rogers. "It's a decision they made together.
The last time he had to make a decision like this was in the spring
of '94, and we thought he made an incredible decision."</TE>
<TE>   Rogers said one option would be to go without a coach. Agassi's
next event is in late February at San Jose. Rogers said the injured
wrist is "better but still not 100%."</TE>

<TE>   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out a jury decision
that gave former boxer Randall "Tex" Cobb a $10.7-million libel award
against Sports Illustrated and its owner, Time Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Cobb argued that Sports Illustrated and Time libeled him by
publishing a story in the magazine's Oct. 4, 1993, edition reporting
he knowingly participated in a fixed match that opponent Paul "Sonny"
Barch had arranged to lose. The magazine also reported that Cobb used
cocaine with Barch and Rick Parker, promoter of the Sept. 15, 1992,
bout at Fort Lauderdale, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   The court of appeals rejected the jury's January 2000 verdict
because there was no evidence Sports Illustrated published the story
with "actual malice" intent against Cobb.</TE>

<HD>Coslet Is Hired to Jump-Start the Cowboys' Offense</HD>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bruce Coslet has just what the Dallas Cowboys are looking for: NFL
play-calling experience and a vast knowledge of the West Coast
offense.</LD>
<LD>   Coslet, the former coach of the Cincinnati Bengals and New York
Jets, was hired Wednesday as the Cowboys' offensive coordinator.</LD>
<LD>   Coslet replaces Jack Reilly, who was reassigned after Dallas
finished with a 5-11 record for the second consecutive season.</LD>
<TE>   Cowboy owner Jerry Jones hopes a more up-tempo offense will be the
solution.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say the offense I'm used to running is a multiple
offense," Coslet said. "We'll do some West Coast, some vertical
passing, some old San Diego Chargers' downfield stuff. It's really
hard to pin one little name on it. I would like to hope it's the
offense that gets us into the end zone the most."</TE>
<TE>   Coslett was 47-78 in nine seasons as coach of the Jets and
Bengals.</TE>
<TE>   But Coslet was successful as an offensive coordinator for the
Bengals, who had the NFL's top-rated offense in 1986 and 1988 and led
the league in rushing in 1988 and 1989.</TE>

<TE>   New England receiver Terry Glenn sued the NFL, saying it
discriminated against him for a disability that prevented him from
following certain rules in the league's substance-abuse policy.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan alleged that
since at least 1999, Glenn has had chronic depression, a disability
recognized by the Americans with Disabilities Act.</TE>
<TE>   Glenn argued in the lawsuit that he should not have been suspended
by the NFL for the first four games this season for violating the
substance-abuse policy by missing a drug test.</TE>
<TE>   NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said the league hadn't seen the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Buffalo re-signed quarterback Alex Van Pelt to a five-year
contract worth about $6 million.... Linebacker Richard Jordan and
cornerback Central McClellion agreed to two-year contracts with the
Kansas City Chiefs.... Kurt Schottenheimer was hired as defensive
coordinator of the Detroit Lions. He has been an NFL assistant for 15
years. Schottenheimer's brother, Marty, is San Diego's new coach.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former New York Giant coach Bill Parcells and his wife, Judith,
were granted a divorce Jan. 16 by a judge in Monmouth County, N.J.,
the New York Post reported Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   In court documents, Judith Parcells complained her husband of
nearly 40 years had grown "cold and distant."</TE>
<TE>   The couple has three grown daughters.</TE>

<HD>Yashin Adds Some Punch to His Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alexei Yashin got his seventh career three-goal game and his first
NHL fight.</LD>
<LD>   No one was surprised the latter came against the New York Rangers
at Madison Square Garden.</LD>
<LD>   Yashin scored three goals in the first period and threw some
punches in a second-period melee as the New York Islanders beat the
Rangers, 6-3, Wednesday night.</LD>
<TE>   "It's the exception for him," Coach Peter Laviolette said of
Yashin's fighting, "but against the Rangers, you never know what will
pop up."</TE>
<TE>   The game featured 172 minutes in penalties, 113 for the Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always a rivalry with them," said Ranger captain Mark
Messier, who returned after missing 11 games with a shoulder injury.
"Unfortunately, tonight, by the time we realized we were in one, the
game was over."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Parrish also scored in the first period as the Islanders took
an early 4-0 lead to chase Ranger goalie Mike Richter.</TE>
<TE>   The brawls began in the second period and Yashin threw his first
punches in nine seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't really want to fight, I just went to see what was going
on," Yashin said. "But he pulled my shirt up and sometimes you have
to fight back."</TE>
<TE>   Calgary 4, Detroit 3--Marc Savard scored three goals as the host
Flames beat the NHL-leading Red Wings for the third time this season.</TE>
<TE>   Nashville 5, Colorado 2--Scott Hartnell scored two goals as the
Predators beat Colorado and ended a six-game unbeaten streak in
Denver.</TE>
<TE>   After allowing just four goals in three road games, Colorado has
allowed 11 goals in two home losses.</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa 3, Philadelphia 1--Marian Hossa scored the go-ahead goal
with 3:39 left and Patrick Lalime made 18 saves as the Senators won
at Ottawa.</TE>
<TE>   Jeremy Roenick reached 1,000 career points with a first-period
goal for Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 4, Montreal 3--Sean O'Donnell scored 1:16 into overtime as
the Bruins recovered from blowing a two-goal lead late in the third
period to win at Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 6, Atlanta 0--Curtis Joseph made 17 saves for his fourth
shutout of the season as six players scored for the Maple Leafs at
Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 3, Florida 1--Radoslav Suchy ended a 30-game scoreless
streak and Sean Burke made 41 saves to lead the Coyotes at Sunrise,
Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina 3, Tampa Bay 1--The Hurricanes outshot host Tampa Bay,
40-19, to end a seven-game (0-2-5) winless streak.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 4, Washington 1--Pavol Demitra scored two goals in a
three-goal second period and the Blues ended a three-game losing
streak with a victory at Washington.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose 6, Pittsburgh 3--Alexander Korolyuk scored the go-ahead
goal and set up another as the Sharks scored four goals in fewer than
18 minutes at Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 3, Chicago 1--Scott Gomez set up goals by new linemates
Bobby Holik and Sergei Brylin, and Martin Brodeur had 27 saves as the
Devils beat the Blackhawks at East Rutherford, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Vancouver 2, Edmonton 2--Henrik Sedin scored 8:37 into the third

Canada.</TE>

<LD>Jason Williams grew up a North Carolina fan.</LD>
<LD>   "When I was little, yeah," Williams said.</LD>
<LD>   Just one more regret for Tar Heel fans to stomach as they watch a
disastrous season continue tonight against Williams and No. 1 Duke in
a game some believe the Tar Heels could lose by 40.</LD>
<TE>   Already, Maryland and Connecticut have beaten Carolina by more
than 30 points, and Kentucky and Wake Forest have beaten the Tar
Heels by 20 or more. Carolina is 6-11 and has lost to Hampton,
Davidson and College of Charleston.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone's talking about the strange things that happen in rivalry
games and the famous 1995 game when a woeful Duke team took a Final
Four-bound Carolina team to double-overtime in a 102-100 loss.</TE>
<TE>   But you might want to keep this statistic handy: Duke's largest
margin of victory over the Tar Heels in the history of the series is
35 points, in 1964.</TE>
<TE>   For North Carolina, the famous streaks of 39 winning seasons, 31
consecutive 20-win seasons and 27 consecutive NCAA tournament
appearances are all but over.</TE>
<TE>   That leaves two questions: How did this happen? And how long will
it last?</TE>
<TE>   Coach Matt Doherty, the national coach of the year last season,
has made mistakes in his two years, but won't face real heat unless
North Carolina fails to improve considerably next season with the
arrival of one of the nation's top two recruiting classes. (Duke,
predictably, has the other.)</TE>
<TE>   Whether a group that includes three of the nation's top 10 high
school players can transform a team recently reduced to rejoicing
over beating Clemson remains to be seen--especially considering this
team's two best players, Jason Capel and Kris Lang, are seniors.</TE>
<TE>   "Will North Carolina immediately return to the stature they're
accustomed to?" Bob Gibbons, a national recruiting expert and editor
and publisher of All Star Sports Publications, asked rhetorically. "I
think not."</TE>
<TE>   Assessing responsibility for the Carolina collapse has become a
local pastime.</TE>
<TE>   Even Doherty succumbs.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, your mind wanders when you're driving down the road on a
recruiting trip, or on a plane," he said. "You think of things that
were done in the past that may have impacted the future. You just try
to learn from things."</TE>
<TE>   The blame is hardly all Doherty's. Somewhat surprisingly, in a
decidedly unscientific poll on Goheels.com, Doherty was polling only
15% of more than 17,000 votes.</TE>
<TE>   Incredibly, 4% went to Kansas Coach Roy Williams, the former
assistant whose only crime was turning down the Carolina job.</TE>
<TE>   Ten percent, in seeming sacrilege, voted for Dean Smith. Athletic
Director Dick Baddour drew 12% for his handling of the coaching
search that ended with Doherty.</TE>
<TE>   And 58% of the votes went to Bill Guthridge, the longtime Smith
assistant who is blamed for some of the recruiting shortcomings but
took two teams to the Final Four in three seasons before retiring.</TE>
<TE>   A look at some of the reasons for the collapse:</TE>
<TE>   * The departure of Joseph Forte: A first-team All-American on
North Carolina's 26-7 team last season, Forte jumped to the NBA after
his sophomore year. Plenty of teams survive such blows, but some
wonder whether Forte would have stayed if Doherty and Forte had
formed a closer bond or if Doherty had held over a member of
Guthridge's staff, such as Phil Ford.</TE>
<TE>   * Ronald Curry and the football problem: How North Carolina ever
got in the position of losing two basketball players who want to
prepare for the NFL draft is preposterous, but it happened. Julius
Peppers, a likely top-three pick, was always a football player first.
But Curry was a national prep player of the year in basketball and
football, and Guthridge's staff proved wrong in believing he would be
most committed to basketball. He never became a star on the hardwood,
and when he decided his future is in the NFL, Doherty's Tar Heels
were caught short at point guard--finally turning to Adam Boone, at
least for now.</TE>
<TE>   * Jason Williams chooses Duke: In other fallout from Curry's
recruitment, Williams--a class behind Curry--decided against
following him to Carolina, eliminating the Tar Heels fairly early.</TE>
<TE>   "I talked to them, but just decided not to go there," said
Williams, cagey about it now.</TE>
<TE>   Gibbons, the recruiting expert, recalls the scenario that unfolded
under Guthridge.</TE>
<TE>   "Like Dean Smith's program always did, they were always very
honest that they never wanted to over-recruit or mislead players.
They said, 'We have Ronald Curry and we expect him to be our point
guard. If you come here, you'll be primarily a two guard.' That
turned Jason off, because he envisioned himself at point guard--but
whether North Carolina could have beaten out Duke, we'll never know."</TE>
<TE>   * Jason Parker's transcript: Parker, an extremely talented
6-foot-9 inside player, signed with North Carolina but wasn't
admitted because of academic shortcomings. Kentucky found an error on
his high school record and he landed with the Wildcats. Parker
started as a freshman last season, but is sidelined this season
because of a knee injury.</TE>
<TE>   * Failure to recruit a big man: Seven-footer Brendan Haywood
became a first-round draft pick after his senior season last year,
but Doherty struck out on a number of prospects and didn't pursue
Emeka Okafor, who was interested. Okafor landed at Connecticut--and
helped beat the Tar Heels this month.</TE>
<TE>   Front-line players Lang and Capel are seniors this season, and 7-5
reserve Neil Fingleton has transferred, leaving Doherty scrambling.
The commitments for next season are from Damion Grant, a raw 7-footer
from Jamaica playing at a New Hampshire prep school, and Byron
Sanders, a Mississippi player whose other top choice was South
Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   Amid all the discussions of who should have or could have been
recruited--Omar Cook and Eddie Griffin are other players some believe
North Carolina could have signed--there are the players who will
arrive next season.</TE>
<TE>   Gibbons calls Tar Heel recruit Raymond Felton from South Carolina
the top high school point guard in the nation. Forward Sean May, the
son of former Indiana star Scott May, figures to be Mr. Basketball in
Indiana this year. Shooting guard Rashad McCants, attending prep
school in New Hampshire, also ranks among Gibbons' top 10 players.</TE>
<TE>   Knight Moves</TE>
<TE>   Now that Texas Tech is in the top 25, we know you've all been
wondering:</TE>
<TE>   Who's Bob Knight's target this time?</TE>
<TE>   In the tradition he upheld with Steve Alford, Calbert Cheaney and
Alan Henderson, Knight singles out a particular player, usually
talented, and stays after him.</TE>
<TE>   The Dallas Morning News says it's Andre Emmett, a freshman reserve
guard last season who has blossomed this season.</TE>
<TE>   Emmett's average has gone from 7.7 points to 18.3, and he's
shooting 52.4% after shooting less than 40% last season.</TE>
<TE>   Emmett scored 30 points against Southern Methodist, 32 against
Oklahoma State and 26 against Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   A few comments from Knight, culled by the Morning News:</TE>
<TE>   "His effort slips on occasion, but 'slips' is not a word that
covers the drop in his effort. Tumble is more like it. He
cascades....</TE>
<TE>   "Emmett scores 27 points, and I can take you through the film and
show you how he gave up 27 points on defense...."</TE>
<TE>   View From the Bench</TE>
<TE>   The Florida-Kentucky game Tuesday wasn't the clash of high-flying
teams predicted, but a meeting of struggling Southeastern Conference
rivals.</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky Coach Tubby Smith benched three starters--Keith Bogans,
Gerald Fitch and Jules Camara.</TE>
<TE>   Florida Coach Billy Donovan kept Brett Nelson on the bench for
tipoff for the second game in a row for an unspecified breach of team
rules.</TE>
<TE>   Bogans, sub-par for much of the season, scored 20 points,
including a big three-point shot at the end.</TE>
<TE>   The result: a 70-68 victory for Kentucky--and Florida's third loss
in a row.</TE>

<KH>OLYMPICS HELENE ELLIOTT</KH>
<HD>Appeal Is Next for Jovanovic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. bobsledder Pavle Jovanovic, disqualified from the Salt Lake City
Winter Games after testing positive for the banned steroid
19-norandrostenedione, was suspended Wednesday for nine months by the
North American Court of Arbitration for Sport. However, his attorney
was heartened that it wasn't worse and hopes the sanction will be
reversed or modified on appeal.</LD>
<LD>   Had Jovanovic intended to take a performance-enhancing substance
instead of unknowingly consuming it in a dietary supplement, attorney
Adam Driggs said, he would have gotten the two-year sentence standard
in such cases. The relative brevity led Driggs to believe their
appeal, which will be heard by the International Court for
Arbitration in Sport next Wednesday in Salt Lake City, has a chance
to succeed.</LD>
<LD>   "The nine months is significant because that's the lowest
suspension the CAS panel has given," Driggs said. "Obviously, they
found it came from a contaminated supplement, or they would have
given him two years."</LD>
<TE>   Driggs said he will draw parallels to Latvian slider Sandis
Prusis, who tested positive for nandrolone in November and was
suspended by the international bobsled federation (FIBT). Prusis said
he had ingested the substance in a dietary supplement and appealed to
the FIBT, which made the suspension retroactive and allowed him to
compete at Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   Jovanovic, a former Rutgers football player from Toms River, N.J.,
cannot appeal to the FIBT because the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency has
authority to handle drug testing and adjudication of U.S. Olympic
athletes. He was scheduled to be part of Todd Hays' crew in the
four-man event and possibly the two-man event.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Olympic Committee got permission from the International
Olympic Committee to submit the names of 11 bobsledders instead of 10
when it submitted its team rosters to the IOC on Monday. If Jovanovic
can't compete, Steve Mesler will replace him.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish we could go to the FIBT," Driggs said. "The reason Prusis
was given three months is that's what the Latvian federation asked
for. It would give him a punishment but would allow him to compete at
the Olympics. We would accept a punishment, because unfortunately,
Pavle did take a contaminated supplement unknowingly, but he is
responsible for that.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd take punishment like letting him compete in only one event,
not two, or letting him compete at the Olympics and suspending him
for the start of next year's World Cup, or having him lecture at high
schools about the consequences of taking these things. He shouldn't
be treated like an athlete who stuck an injection in his side with
nandrolone. One good thing about this is it does say he's not a
cheater, for what solace that gives."</TE>
<TE>   Matt Roy, executive director of the U.S. Bobsled and Skeleton
Federation, acknowledged his federation's program to educate athletes
about dietary supplements "is not very organized," and added "there
is a lot being contemplated" for future efforts. He also acknowledged
the prevalence of supplements among bobsledders and said AdvoCare, a
producer of supplements and dietary aids, gives products and "a small
amount of cash" to the USBSF in its role of sponsor.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say as we actually go as far as to recommend
supplements," he said. "I think there are a number of people,
athletes and coaches, within the federation that would say it's
required to compete at a high level, weight and strength being
important. ... Our athletes and coaches basically live on protein
shakes."</TE>
<TE>   He also said testing the supplements for banned substances was
considered. "We were told it's a non-issue," he said, "because one
batch could be clean and the next could be contaminated. We have a
letter from AdvoCare saying its products are clean and stating that
of 60 athletes [who used its products] in Sydney, none tested
positive for banned substances."</TE>
<TE>   Losing Jovanovic "is certainly not going to help Todd's chances in
the two-man," Roy said. "In the four-man, Billy Schuffenhauer would
step in. I'm not sure he's of Pavle's ability, but Billy is also a
great athlete and he's one-quarter of the team in the four-man, so
[adjusting to a new crewmate] is less of a factor."</TE>
<TE>   An Aptitude for Skating</TE>
<TE>   Russian figure skater Alexander Abt's medical history is almost as
long as his competitive resume.</TE>
<TE>   He has had two serious knee operations, treatment for a badly cut
thigh muscle he suffered in a freak accident during an exhibition,
sinus infections and surgery to remove a cyst from his sinuses last
spring. He showed enormous promise on the rare occasions he was
healthy, finishing third at the 1998 European championships.</TE>
<TE>   Since he and coach Rafael Arutunian moved to Lake Arrowhead last
summer, Abt seems to have put his medical crises behind him. A
spectacular jumper who has a quadruple toe-triple toe in his
repertoire, Abt finished second at the Russian national championships
and again at the European championships, thrusting him into the medal
picture at Salt Lake City. Although Alexei Yagudin missed the Russian
competition and Evgeny Plushenko missed the European meet, Abt was
thrilled to skate well and built his confidence before the Games.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my last season, so I'm just trying to do my best," said
Abt, 25, who coaches part-time at the Ice Castle rink at Lake
Arrowhead. "Nothing is broken now, so I'm hoping to compete hard and
do my job."</TE>
<TE>   Abt and Arutunian were invited to the rink by owner Carol Probst,
a former skater, after she saw Abt's fifth-place performance at the
2000 Skate America event.</TE>
<TE>   "We are happy in America," Arutunian said. "Mrs. Probst does
everything for us. Michelle Kwan is here, Sasha Cohen is here
sometimes, and it is the right place for us."</TE>
<TE>   Said Abt: "It was very difficult to change from Russia to America
and learn new rules, but there are a lot of good skaters here every
day, so it's like a competition. It's a very beautiful place and I am
enjoying it very much."</TE>
<TE>   Is His Other Car a Sled?</TE>
<TE>   Georg Hackl of Germany, trying to win his fourth consecutive men's
luge gold medal, won the last race of the World Cup season on a sled
that engineers from Porsche helped build.</TE>
<TE>   His placement in the race at Winterberg, Germany, ensured him a
good start position at Salt Lake City. "This win was very important,
first for the starting place, and second for the morale," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The overall World Cup title was won by Markus Prock of Austria,
with Armin Zoeggeler of Italy second and Hackl third. Those three are
expected to vie for gold at Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   No Snow Job</TE>
<TE>   It's not that snowboarder Rosey Fletcher was blase about competing
at the Olympics for the second time. But it took the enthusiasm of
teammate Lisa Odynski, who will make her Olympic debut at Salt Lake
City, to rekindle Fletcher's fervor.</TE>
<TE>   "On the plane ride back from Munich [after a competition], she was
so excited, I had to ask, 'Are we going to the same Games?'" Fletcher
said. "It made me a little less serious and made me realize it's a
fun event. She changed my whole perspective about the whole thing."</TE>
<TE>   Fletcher, of Girdwood, Alaska, is also enthusiastic about the
format change in her event, parallel giant slalom. Two snowboarders
will compete side-by-side on the course, instead of one athlete at a
time competing against the clock.</TE>
<TE>   "I actually prefer parallel giant slalom because it's a little
more spectator-friendly than giant slalom, which snowboard
desperately needs," Fletcher said. "It's just pure competition. I
take chances I normally wouldn't take if there weren't somebody next
to me."</TE>
<TE>   Here and there</TE>
<TE>   The Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles awarded a grant of
$612,000 to Kids in Sports, Los Angeles to provide year-round
programs at 14 parks and school-based sites that serve 12,000
inner-city kids, and a grant of $397,500 to LA's BEST, to be used for
after-school programs for more than 17,500 kids at 101 elementary
schools in the L.A. Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   Those were the largest grants of the more than $2.3 million
awarded by the AAF, which is endowed with Southern California's share
of the surplus from the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   The AAF has disbursed more than $115 million to start or help
youth sports programs in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Four U.S. figure skating pairs ended their partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   Most noteworthy was the senior pair of Laura Handy and Jonathon
Hunt, who skated together for two years and finished sixth at the
recent U.S. championships at Staples Center. Junior pairs silver
medalists Janey Mayne and Josh Martin, who trained in Torrance, also
split.</TE>

<LD>Alpine Skiing: Austrian downhiller Florian Seer was found to have a
tumor on his spine. It reportedly wasn't cancerous, but he was
scheduled for surgery this week. Injuries have already idled
Austria's Hermann Maier, Josef Strobl, Hannes Trinkl, Werner Franz
and Mario Matt.... Most of the U.S. women's team will skip the last
pre-Olympic World Cup downhill, slalom and combined events this
weekend at Are, Sweden, to train for the Games. The men's tour is in
St. Moritz, Switzerland, for a downhill and giant slalom.</LD>
<LD>   Biathlon/Cross-Country: Raphael Poiree of France and his wife,
Live Grete Skjelbreid Poiree of Norway, won biathlon World Cup
pursuit events last weekend at Anterselva, Italy. He won a
12.5-kilometer race to lead the World Cup standings, while she
recorded her fourth consecutive World Cup victory.</LD>
<LD>   Bobsled/Luge/Skeleton: German lugers won the men's singles and
doubles and women's singles overall World Cup titles. Patric Leitner
and Alexander Resch were the men's doubles champions, while Silke
Kraushaar, Sylke Otto and Barbara Niedernhuber led the women's
standings. Markus Prock of Austria won his 10th overall men's singles
title. The highest-ranked U.S. woman was Becky Wilczak, who was
fifth.</LD>
<TE>   Curling: The U.S. women's team will get an Olympic send-off Monday
at the Madison (Wis.) Curling Club. The team will practice there
before the party.... The women's team will also be featured in a
demonstration of the sport on the "Today" show Friday, with the
show's anchors expected to participate.</TE>
<TE>   Figure Skating: U.S. ice dance champions Naomi Lang and Peter
Tchernyshev won the Four Continents title last weekend in South
Korea. Most Olympians skipped the event because it's close to the
Games, but the U.S. duo wanted competitive experience after missing
most of this season while Tchernyshev fought shin splints.... Rena
Inoue and John Baldwin Jr., who train in Aliso Viejo, finished
seventh among pairs.... Second-ranked U.S. pair Tiffany Scott and
Philip Dulebohn are training in Colorado Springs to prepare for the
altitude at Salt Lake City. Other skaters have joined them or will do
so soon, including Timothy Goebel and Sarah Hughes.</TE>
<TE>   Freestyle Skiing: Jeret Peterson of Boise, Idaho, who replaced the
injured Emily Cook on the U.S. Olympic aerials team, recorded the top
U.S. result with a seventh-place finish at a World Cup event last
weekend at Blackcomb, Canada. Peterson was told about his Olympic
selection in a phone call from Cook, a classy gesture. "This isn't
the way I wanted it to be, but now I have the opportunity," Peterson
said.</TE>
<TE>   Hockey: The U.S. women's team, 30-0-0, plays its final Olympic
warmup game tonight at Denver against China.... Nancy Drolet, a
mainstay of Canada's women's team since 1992, appealed Coach Daniele
Sauvageau's decision to drop her from the Olympic roster. Drolet took
her case to the Canadian Hockey Assn. for a hearing Wednesday. Drolet
scored the winning goal for Canada at the 1997 and 2000 world
championships but had been in a slump and wasn't a factor in Canada's
eight consecutive losses to the U.S. ... The coach of Sweden's
women's hockey team, Peter Elander, resigned after admitting he
falsified documents to help two Slovenian players get residency and
work permits. Daniel Morger replaced him.</TE>
<TE>   Nordic Combined/Ski Jumping: Alex Glueck of Colorado Springs won a
silver medal in the combined individual event at the world junior
nordic championships at Schonach, Germany. However, the nordic
combined sprint was canceled because of bad weather .... U.S.
Olympian Clint Jones tied for seventh in the 90-meter jumping event
at the world junior nordic championships. Brian Welch, another
Olympian, finished 36th.</TE>
<TE>   Snowboarding: Pre-Olympic training for the U.S. team is underway
at Park City.... U.S. halfpipe Olympian J.J. Thomas, a medalist in
the X Games, isn't awed by the prospect of competing in the Olympics.
"They should be pretty close," he said. "The X Games were cool."</TE>
<TE>   Speedskating: With the long-track World Cup tour taking a break
for the Olympics, Canadians dominate the men's standings. Jeremy
Wotherspoon ranks first in the 500 and 1,000, with Casey FitzRandolph
second in the 200 and fourth in the 1,000. Dustin Molicki of Canada
is first in the 1,500, followed by Derek Parra of San Bernardino.
Gianni Romme of the Netherlands leads the men's 5,000/10,000
standings. For the women, Catriona LeMay Doan leads the 500
standings, with Sabine Volker of Germany the leader in the 1,000 and
Anni Friesinger of Germany leading the 1,500 and the 3,000/5,000
standings.... Many short-track skaters will compete this weekend in
an Olympic warmup meet at Calgary, Canada.</TE>

<KH>SUPER BOWL XXXVI NEW ENGLAND VS. ST. LOUIS</KH>
<HD>The Snap Decision Is Brady</HD>
<DH>Patriots: Belichick announces former backup will start at
quarterback instead of Bledsoe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>His team might be a heavy underdog, but New England Coach Bill
Belichick went with the favorite Wednesday night, appointing Tom
Brady the starting quarterback for the Super Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   Belichick made the decision hours after watching Brady glide
through the first practice of the week wearing a sturdy plastic brace
on his sprained left ankle. The injury knocked him out of Sunday's
victory at Pittsburgh, allowing supplanted starter Drew Bledsoe to
briefly reclaim his job.</LD>
<LD>   But Brady showed no signs of pain and all week has looked ready to
face St. Louis on Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   "I feel normal," he told a pool reporter as the two walked off the
artificial turf of Tulane's practice field.</TE>
<TE>   Belichick would not immediately divulge which quarterback he
planned to start, instead saying he wanted to first study the
videotape from practice with his assistant coaches, then inform the
quarterbacks of the decision.</TE>
<TE>   True to form, the secretive Belichick asked that the identity of
who took the most snaps, or who practiced with the No. 1 offense, not
be revealed.</TE>
<TE>   "They both worked, and I was satisfied with how they worked,"
Belichick said. Asked if he was pleased with the way Brady moved in
and out of the pocket, the coach said: "I'm going to take a look at
the tape on that one."</TE>
<TE>   This St. Louis team is most familiar with Brady, the starter in
November when the Rams posted a 24-17 victory at New England. Both
teams met with media representatives Wednesday morning, and several
Ram defenders said they would prepare the same way whether the
starter was Brady or Bledsoe.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not talking about two ends of the spectrum," Pro Bowl
cornerback Aeneas Williams said. "You're talking about two guys who
are pocket passers. Brady may be able to move a little bit to buy
some time, but you don't have that vast difference. As far as the
defense running things, one of the things we focus in on, what we do
well, is hustling to the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Ram linebacker London Fletcher said Brady is mature beyond his two
NFL seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a very calm and cool quarterback," he said. "You aren't
going to rattle him."</TE>
<TE>   Bledsoe, who had not played in 126 days, came off the bench at
Pittsburgh late in the first half of the AFC championship game and
led his team to victory.</TE>
<TE>   He started the first two games of the season, before suffering a
serious chest injury on a tackle by New York Jet linebacker Mo Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   Asked Wednesday morning whether he thought he would start, Bledsoe
said: "I would certainly love to play in this game. There's no
question this game is the one that everybody plays for and, if given
that opportunity, I would take it and run with it. But, as I said
[Tuesday], I don't know if that opportunity is going to be given to
me or not."</TE>
<TE>   Brady received treatment on his ankle Tuesday night and Wednesday
morning and said he felt ready to go. That was evident from the start
of workouts Wednesday, when he joined the rest of the offense in a
jog before practice.</TE>
<TE>   Security was described by an observer as "tight, but not
oppressive," with three yellow-coated NFL officers patrolling the
side of the field lined by three houses, and two Louisiana State
Police officers watching the field's perimeter.</TE>

<KH>Bill Plaschke SUPER BOWL XXXVI NEW ENGLAND VS. ST. LOUIS
Sunday, 3:15 p.m., Channel 11</KH>
<HD>THE RAM That Time Forgot</HD>
<DH>Ollie Matson Has No Connection to That Team in St. Louis</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He awakens every morning at 4:30, dresses quietly in a soft sweat
suit, steps outside before the sun.</LD>
<LD>   He walks up Hudson, down Olympic, on to the track at Los Angeles
High, around and around and around in the dark.</LD>
<LD>   If looking for Ollie Matson these days, this is the best place and
time to find him.</LD>
<TE>   A Hall of Fame running back walking invisibly amid us.</TE>
<TE>   A ghost of the Ram football past.</TE>
<TE>   "They act like I'm dead," he says.</TE>
<TE>   If so, then the 71-year-old rests in a catacombs shared by many,
an entire generation of Rams memories left behind six years ago when
the team moved to St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   As football's quickest, coolest franchise dances toward the
threshold of greatness for the second time in three years, its oldest
stars slip further into the shadows.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't even know I exist," Matson says.</TE>
<TE>   The new Rams have no alumni director. They have had no old-timer
reunions. Some of their old stars have never even been invited to St.
Louis.</TE>
<TE>   "The connection has been lost," Matson says.</TE>
<TE>   In Sunday's Super Bowl against the New England Patriots in New
Orleans, most of the sports world thinks the Rams will be playing for
their second championship.</TE>
<TE>   Few remember that this would actually be their fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Few still count the 1945 Cleveland Rams' title or the 1951 Los
Angeles Rams' championship.</TE>
<TE>   Even the Rams' "Ring of Fame" in St. Louis, the one spot where
they still remember the likes of Bob Waterfield and Tom Fears, is not
strictly about the Rams.</TE>
<TE>   It also contains the name of three members of the old St. Louis
Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   When asked about their alumni relations, Ram officials directed
questions to Harry Thompson, a guard on the 1951 NFL championship
team and unofficial alumni liaison.</TE>
<TE>   Yet when reached, Thompson agreed with Matson.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they've forgotten about some of the old guys," he says
from his hotel room in New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   He's there, but only because he paid his own way.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the lay of the land," says Thompson, who still lives in Los
Angeles. "The team is not in L.A. anymore, so what happened there has
been sort of lost."</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere is that more profound than with Matson.</TE>
<TE>   Lost, yet he has lived in the same duplex for 42 years.</TE>
<TE>   Lost, yet he has had the same phone number for 42 years.</TE>
<TE>   Lost, yet he was once the most celebrated runner in football, a
Marshall Faulk before there was a Marshall Faulk.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, I was like him," Matson says softly during a recent
interview in his living room. "Only, I could do more things."</TE>
<TE>   He still holds the NFL record for most career kickoff returns for
touchdowns with six.</TE>
<TE>   He and Jim Thorpe remain the only two Pro Football Hall of Famers
with Olympic medals, as Matson won a silver and bronze in track in
1952 in Helsinki.</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, there was the trade.</TE>
<TE>   Marshall Faulk is good, but has he ever been traded for nine
players?</TE>
<TE>   Such was the case in 1959, when a Pete Rozelle-engineered
transaction brought Matson to the Rams from the Chicago Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   It remains one of the biggest deals in Los Angeles sports history.</TE>
<TE>   And maybe the worst thing that ever happened to Matson.</TE>
<TE>   "The trade was bad business," said Mary Matson, Ollie's wife of 47
years. "It was bad, bad business."</TE>
<TE>   Her voice pierces the quiet of their home, a comfortably cluttered
space with aging football photos on the wall and a replica of his
bronze Canton bust on a coffee table.</TE>
<TE>   Mary does most of the talking. Ollie's memory isn't what it used
to be.</TE>
<TE>   She talks, and he nods. She talks, and he smiles.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't know about him," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't know," he says.</TE>
<TE>   They say they have never met Ram owner Georgia Frontiere. They say
they wince when they hear television people talk as if Ram history
was invented by Kurt Warner and refined by Isaac Bruce.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost like Ollie doesn't exist," she says.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't drive anymore, so his appearances at charity golf
tournaments have dwindled. He hasn't done an interview with this
newspaper for more than 20 years, so his voice has been lost.</TE>
<TE>   All those sports business stories praising the economic merits of
franchise relocation inevitably fail to mention men like this.</TE>
<TE>   The men left behind.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody has anything against Ollie Matson, he was a great player,"
says Bob Oates, a longtime NFL reporter for The Times. "But he just
played at the wrong time."</TE>
<TE>   That was evident as early as 1951, when Matson should have won the
Heisman Trophy as a senior at the University of San Francisco,
leading the nation in yardage, touchdowns and scoring for an unbeaten
and untied team.</TE>
<TE>   Yet with many voters still not accepting of blacks, he finished
ninth.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first of many times when he would encounter the sort of
athletic racism that some wrongly think began and ended with Jackie
Robinson.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had to roll with many things in my life," Matson says.</TE>
<TE>   "If we worried about everything that happened to us, we would be
dead," his wife says.</TE>
<TE>   Returning to California after six good pro years in Chicago, they
thought their worries were over.</TE>
<TE>   Until they realized, the Rams didn't just trade nine players for
Matson.</TE>
<TE>   They traded nine white players.</TE>
<TE>   "One black for nine whites? In those days?" recalls Mary. "Lot of
people in Los Angeles never got over that."</TE>
<TE>   They purchased their duplex just six months after they arrived in
town. But they had to preview the house after dark.</TE>
<TE>   "People around here were a little more closed-minded back then,"
Mary says.</TE>
<TE>   Then once he joined the team, Matson realized that nine-for-one is
more than a trade, it's a target.</TE>
<TE>   "It was no picnic," he says.</TE>
<TE>   His two Ram coaches, Sid Gillman, then Bob Waterfield, never used
him as he had been used in Chicago. There, he had been co-rookie of
the year in 1952 and had gained more than 1,000 total yards in three
of his six seasons, big numbers for that era.</TE>
<TE>   Some felt the Rams were worried about catering to a star. Others
felt there was too much jealousy to overcome.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever, Matson suddenly caught fewer passes and gained fewer
yards.</TE>
<TE>   "He never had a shot here," Mary says. "We were so thrilled to be
here, but it never felt right. So much resentment. Dissension right
away. The Rams sabotaged themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed they did, as in Matson's four years here, they won a total
of 11 games.</TE>
<TE>   He was traded to Detroit in 1963, then to Philadelphia for the
final three years of his career.</TE>
<TE>   With the children still in school, he retired in Los Angeles,
where he has been since.</TE>
<TE>   "Children settle you down," Mary says.</TE>
<TE>   Their four children are indeed their greatest accomplishment, with
their family including a dentist, a banker, a high school coach and a
health care worker.</TE>
<TE>   As for Ollie, after football, he bounced around from jobs as a
scout, a high school coach, an assistant football coach at San Diego
State and a figurehead at the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   When all he wanted to do was coach in the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   "But that wasn't available then," says his wife. "Lots of things
weren't available."</TE>
<TE>   Ollie Matson was voted into the Hall of Fame in 1972. He has since
been to several reunions there. Always as simply a great football
player. Never as a former Ram.</TE>
<TE>   When a Raider makes the Hall of Fame, even one who played there
only one season such as Eric Dickerson, he is celebrated in the same
manner as Jim Otto or Howie Long.</TE>
<TE>   But in the Ram media guide, on the pages dedicated to their Hall
of Famers, Matson doesn't even rate a biography like 16 other guys.
He is given only one line.</TE>
<TE>   "There are times I still ask myself, do I wish I had never been
traded from Chicago," Matson says.</TE>
<TE>   He might return to the spotlight this summer when he's one of the
greats featured in a book by Kristine Clark about the 1951 USF team,
titled, "Undefeated, Untied and Uninvited."</TE>
<TE>   And, oh yes, on Sunday, he will be watching the Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Cheering, of course, for the Rams.</TE>
<TE>   "That's still my team," says the old running back, smiling. "They
may not know it, but I'm always a Ram."</TE>

<LD>Shrine Football Returns to North-South Format</LD>
<LD>   The Shrine All-Star Classic football game will return to a format
matching the top players from Southern California against their
counterparts from Northern California.</LD>
<LD>   The game is scheduled for July 13 at Mount San Antonio College.</LD>
<TE>   John Monger of Chino High has been chosen to coach the South team.</TE>
<TE>   For the last seven years, the game featured top high school
players from California against the best players from Texas.
California had a 6-1 lead in the series.</TE>
<TE>   The change in format was made to save costs and help refocus
attention on the California-based Shrine hospitals, according to game
spokeswoman Sandy Stewart.</TE>

<HD>Any Controversy Soon Takes a Hike</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>It has been the most polite quarterback controversy in the history of
football.</LD>
<LD>   "You start, Tom." "No, you start, Drew." "No, really, Tom, you
should start." "But, Drew, you should be the guy."</LD>
<LD>   Finally, Wednesday night, New England Patriot Coach Bill Belichick
selected Tom Brady over Drew Bledsoe as the starter for Sunday's
Super Bowl XXXVI against St. Louis.</LD>
<TE>   One suspects Belichick was toying with us all in this
super-friendly Super Bowl week. Brady had replaced Bledsoe in the
second game this season after Bledsoe was injured. Brady got hurt in
the AFC championship game against Pittsburgh and Bledsoe led the
Patriots to the upset of the Steelers.</TE>
<TE>   First, Belichick said he would announce his starter Wednesday
morning. Then it would be Wednesday after practice. But after
practice, Belichick announced his announcement wouldn't come until
later, after he watched video of practice. While he did, we had video
of breathless interviewers asking Brady and Bledsoe how practice
went. The answer was fine.</TE>
<TE>   But thank goodness Belichick, the Bill Parcells disciple, turns
out to have a devilish sense of humor. What's the point of having a
Super Bowl if a coach can't have a little fun? If you're going to
make all the players sit at tables in hotel ballrooms for an hour
every morning to answer questions, might as well give them the same
question to answer over and over and over.</TE>
<TE>   Won't it be hard, the Rams are asked, to prepare for a game when
you don't know who the quarterback is?</TE>
<TE>   "Well," said Ram defensive back Aeneas Williams, "it's not that
big of deal. Brady and Bledsoe are pretty similar. It's not like one
is a scrambler and one stays in the pocket. They're both big, strong
guys with rifle arms. Doesn't really matter to us who plays. We're
kind of laughing about all this. Brady, Bledsoe, doesn't matter.
Plus, I think Belichick is going to pick Brady. You take the guy who
has been doing it all year."</TE>
<TE>   That's the thing.</TE>
<TE>   The only controversy would have been if Belichick had chosen
Bledsoe.</TE>
<TE>   Belichick is not ruled by sentiment. The choice of Sunday's
starter is not about history or a body of work. The job of starting
quarterback for a single Super Bowl game is not a lifetime
achievement award.</TE>
<TE>   Brady has started for three months. He's got the timing with the
receivers. He's got the confidence and rhythm. He had a sprained
ankle, not a broken leg. He's not walking with a limp. He's not
talking with any hesitation. "I'm fine, I'm healthy, I'm ready,"
Brady has said this week. Over and over.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm ready, I want to play, I can do the job," Bledsoe has said
this week. Over and over.</TE>
<TE>   So we all have something to chew on. The Irish blokes from the
band U2, the scheduled halftime entertainment, gave a news conference
Wednesday. They said they would not announce whether Brady or Bledsoe
would start Sunday. They claimed a vow of silence over who looked
better in practice Wednesday. It was a great joke. The whole
"controversy" has been a great joke.</TE>
<TE>   This is the first time that a Super Bowl team arrived at practice
five days before the big game without a starting quarterback having
been announced.</TE>
<TE>   There have been unusual quarterback situations before:</TE>
<TE>   * In 1969, Johnny Unitas came off the Baltimore bench to replace
Earl Morrall after Morrall threw three interceptions against the New
York Jets. Unitas had missed most of the season with a sore elbow.
Unitas led Baltimore to its only touchdown, but the Joe Namath Jets
won the game.</TE>
<TE>   * In 1971, Morrall ended up relieving an injured Unitas and the
Colts beat Dallas on that memorable Jim O'Brien field goal.</TE>
<TE>   * Jim Plunkett became Oakland's starting quarterback in the sixth
game of the season and led the Raiders into the Super Bowl, then to
its 27-10 win over Philadelphia in 1981. Plunkett became the starter
only after Dan Pastorini broke his leg and because the Raiders
thought rookie Marc Wilson wasn't ready.</TE>
<TE>   * Doug Williams had started only two regular-season games for the
Washington Redskins before the 1988 Super Bowl and had been involved
in a quarterback controversy with Jay Schroeder that was touched by
racial questions. Joe Gibbs finally made Williams the starter as the
playoffs began and Williams ended up being the first African American
quarterback to win a Super Bowl and be named Super Bowl most valuable
player.</TE>
<TE>   What has happened with Brady and Bledsoe is nothing like this.</TE>
<TE>   What happened with Brady is what happened to Kurt Warner three
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   An unknown backup, an undiscovered gem, is thrust into the front
of the line and he does his job better than anyone expects and he
becomes a star and goes to the Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy for the Patriots will come after the Super Bowl,
when it is time to figure out who will be the starting quarterback
next season. And whether the Patriots can afford to keep both Brady
and Bledsoe for very long. And if Bledsoe is going to be the backup,
won't he finally get cranky and not be so darn nice about the whole
thing?</TE>
<TE>   For now, though, we can all breathe a sigh of relief.</TE>
<TE>   "Tom Brady demonstrated in practice today that he is fit to play,"
Belichick said to a pool reporter, the only person allowed to
chronicle this momentous announcement. "He will be our starting
quarterback Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   OK, but what do we talk about for the rest of the week?</TE>

<LD>My Super Bowl Diary: Day Three</LD>
<LD>   NEW ORLEANS--Some people might think I'm not hip because I don't
know that much about music and don't know anything about the rock
band You-Two, which will be performing at halftime of Super Bowl 36.
But I'm willing to learn.</LD>
<LD>   When Green Bay publicist Lee Remmel, who goes back to the
beginning with Vince Lombardi, made an announcement Wednesday that
"the legendary band You-Two" would be appearing at a news conference
shortly, I knew these guys had to be as big as Perry Como to get that
kind of endorsement from Remmel.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, NFL publicist Steve Brener said You-Two is as big as the
Beatles were, but when I asked him to name everyone in the band, he
could only think of two names, which doesn't quite put them up there
with John, Paul, George and Ringo in my book, or Peter, Paul and
Mary, for that matter. You see, I know more than you think.</TE>
<TE>   If I remember correctly, Brener said the You-Two members he knew
were The Edge--and I would presume Mr. and Mrs. Edge were counting on
a professional wrestler when their child was born--and Sonny Bono. I
thought I'd heard something about Sonny Bono no longer being with us,
but I can't imagine a PR specialist like Brener not knowing what he's
talking about.</TE>
<TE>   When I got to the news conference, it was jammed with reporters
and cameramen. I could see this was going to be almost as big as the
Chunky Soup news conference. Frankly, I didn't know Sonny and his
friends were that popular, but then I realized the game will be over
at halftime and this will be it for the Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone was very friendly while waiting, music was playing, and
the guy next to me said, "It's a beautiful day," and I said, "I'll
take your word for it, but I've been locked in the press room
studying Xs and O's," and he said, "No, 'It's a Beautiful Day,'" and
I've heard stories about musicians and drugs, but this was my first
experience with it at a Super Bowl from anyone other than a football
player.</TE>
<TE>   What a surprise, of course, but the rock band was late for the
news conference. So I read about the NFL's patriotic entertainment
plans with the Boston Pops, known as "America's Orchestra,"
performing American classics, Mariah Carey singing the national
anthem and Mary J. Blige and Marc Anthony doing "America the
Beautiful." Four former presidents--well, five, if you include Nancy
Reagan--will read the work of Abraham Lincoln, and then another great
American, Paul McCartney, will offer a tribute "to the spirit of
everyday heroes."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AFTER 30 minutes, the piped-in music was beginning to get on my
nerves, so I said to a woman something about being stuck here waiting
for You-Two, and she said, "Stuck in a moment," and I said, "That's
what I just said," and she said, "'Stuck in a Moment,'" as if she
knew something I didn't, and I'm so glad now I never let my daughters
watch MTV.</TE>
<TE>   The news conference finally began with NFL official Brian McCarthy
telling everyone Jonathan Kraft, son of the Patriots' owner, had just
whispered into Bono's ear who the starting quarterback will be
Sunday--"making him the first person at Super Bowl 36 other than the
Patriots to know." The NFL has almost 2,000 accredited members of the
media here, and Sonny gets the scoop.</TE>
<TE>   McCarthy told everyone the events of Sept. 11 had led to a change
in entertainment this year. "It's always been patriotic over the
top," McCarthy said, "but this year we're going to have it be
meaningful and relevant."</TE>
<TE>   I made a note to ask McCarthy later how an Irish band makes this
whole patriotic thing more relevant in America, and why someone like
Bruce Springsteen wasn't called on to rock the place with "Born in
the USA." I credit Springsteen with giving me my first look at
Courtney Cox, and for you people who have no idea what I'm talking
about, you really do need to study up on your music trivia.</TE>
<TE>   McCarthy told the media You-Two could only take a few questions
"because the band needs to get to rehearsal." I thought about
yelling: "The band should have been on time," but I didn't want to
get a Raider-like reputation with the NFL, and some day have them
review my request to cover the Super Bowl and make up some rule to
keep me out.</TE>
<TE>   At that point four middle-aged men came on the stage, cameras
flashed, and it has been a long time since I've seen Sonny Bono, but
he wasn't there.</TE>
<TE>   "Where's Bono?" I asked, and three people pointed to this guy
carrying a football wearing sunglasses and an ugly coat. "Sonny?" I
said, and one of them said, "Bono?" and I said, "Yes," and they
pointed to the guy with the football, and I'm telling you these
people in the music business are wacko.</TE>
<TE>   And I thought Xxxxxxx Xxxxxxxxx was out to lunch, and once too
often--but that really doesn't matter, does it? As you know, I'm not
allowed to write about her while I'm here, which explains why I was
hanging on every word The Edge had to say.</TE>
<TE>   When it was over, I still hadn't heard one of their songs, and
asked someone if they could name one of their hits. "Sunday Bloody
Sunday," I was told, and I can't imagine the NFL requesting that. So
I prevailed on halftime show producer Dennis Despier, who operates
Select Productions in our very own Tustin, to tell his very own
hometown newspaper what You-Two will be singing Sunday--just in case
I get stuck in the restroom and miss it.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe the NFL likes a little suspense," Despier said, and I
had to be honest with him:</TE>
<TE>   "I've never heard 'a little suspense.' How does that one go?"</TE>

<HD>Waves Turn This Rivalry Into a Rout</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It wasn't long ago that Pepperdine and Loyola Marymount was the
rivalry in the West Coast Conference.</LD>
<LD>   As far as the Waves go, there is no such rivalry. These days,
Pepperdine is battling Gonzaga for conference titles and NCAA
tournament berths. . Despite a sloppy second half, the Waves
dismantled the Lions, 84-59, before 2,007 Wednesday night at
Firestone Fieldhouse.</LD>
<LD>   Pepperdine (14-6, 7-0) got another balanced effort, winning its
ninth game in a row and its seventh consecutive in the series with
Loyola Marymount.</LD>
<TE>   Glen McGowan had 17 points, Jimmy Miggins had 15 and Boomer
Brazzle added 13. The first-place Waves got points from all but one
player and remained a game ahead of Gonzaga. "Even though they
weren't turning the ball over a lot, I thought we did get the game to
our tempo," Pepperdine Coach Paul Westphal said. "When they missed
some of their early shots, it allowed us to run. It was the
difference."</TE>
<TE>   Cedric Suitt, who tied a WCC record with 10 blocks in the Waves'
double-overtime victory at San Diego, had three blocks in the first
nine minutes and finished with five.</TE>
<TE>   In the first half, Craig Lewis and McGowan came off the bench to
spark a 17-8 run that pushed the Waves' lead to 31-18.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the best half we've had in a while," Miggins said.</TE>
<TE>   Loyola (9-12, 2-5) lost its fourth in a row and remained in sixth
place. Greg Lakey was one bright spot for the Lions, finishing with
16 points and eight rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "Transition defense beat us in the first half," Lion Coach Steve
Aggers said. "We didn't get back defensively like we should have. And
we just continue to shoot poorly."</TE>

<HD>Hahn, Tagliabue Plan to Meet Before Game</HD>

<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James Hahn will meet Sunday with NFL Commissioner
Paul Tagliabue before the Super Bowl, and the two are expected to
talk informally about the prospects of bringing the NFL back to L.A.</LD>
<LD>   Two months ago, Hahn met at his office with Roger Goodell, the
league's chief operating officer who oversees stadium and franchise
issues.</LD>
<LD>   L.A. has been without an NFL team since the Raiders and Rams left
in 1995.</LD>
<TE>   Hahn has expressed interest in helping bring a team to the
area--an endeavor that probably would involve building a stadium--as
long as it doesn't come at taxpayers' expense.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting with Tagliabue is intended to be a get-to-know-you
session.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn is due to arrive in New Orleans on Saturday afternoon and
will attend a private party that night hosted by Saint owner Tom
Benson. Sunday, Hahn and Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook will go to the
game.</TE>

<TE>   Patriot owner Bob Kraft said Wednesday he was inundated with calls
and letters to fire Bill Belichick when the team was 1-3.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not how we run our businesses," said Kraft, who owns an
international paper company. "We try to pick good people and stick by
them and support them."</TE>
<TE>   Kraft said he always gives his employees, inside and outside
football, at least two years to prove themselves. That accounts for
highs and lows in, say, paper sales.</TE>
<TE>   "People ask me what's the difference in Bill coaching here and
coaching in Cleveland," he said. "I think it's that this organization
is on the same page."</TE>
<TE>   Belichick has job stability. The pressing question concerns the
future of Drew Bledsoe, the Patriots' $107-million quarterback. Kraft
was asked if he will listen to offers from interested teams.</TE>
<TE>   "That's Bill Belichick's decision," he said. "If I have a vote, I
would not be against having both of them play for us next year,
unless someone comes up with a blockbuster offer for either one."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   They were college teammates at Washington, roommates in a tiny
house outside Seattle, and now Ernie Conwell and Damon Huard will be
across the field from each other at the Super Bowl. Conwell is the
starting tight end for St. Louis; Huard is New England's No. 3
quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   The two lived rent-free in a one-bedroom, ramshackle house in
Kent, Wash., when they were sophomores with the Huskies. The place,
which belonged to Conwell's grandmother, was across the street from a
roofing company, and train tracks practically ran through the
backyard.</TE>
<TE>   Best friends through college, Huard and Conwell shared the lone
bedroom for a year, then moved out after the place was burglarized
and all their possessions stolen.</TE>
<TE>   "Damon was pretty clean and tidy," Conwell said. "Damon was kind
of borderline feminine. He'd wash his face every night with Noxzema.
He probably had a luffa."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While everybody is focused on the Arena Football League success
story named Kurt Warner, they might be missing a similar story named
David Patten.</TE>
<TE>   He is the Patriot wide receiver who, like Warner, was undrafted
and unwanted out of college.</TE>
<TE>   While Warner worked in a supermarket, Patten hauled 75-pound cases
of coffee beans.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like football was over for me," said Patten, who attended
Western Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   While Warner began his career with the Iowa Barnstormers, Patten
joined the Albany Firebirds.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a long road," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And, wouldn't you know it, the two men once met each other on the
Arena League field, even though they didn't know it.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was on the sideline [for Albany], I was thinking about how
accurate the quarterback was; he was hitting everybody, putting it
right on the chest," Patten recalled. "At the time, I didn't
recognize Kurt Warner."</TE>
<TE>   At times this year, Patten has had wildly successful and
surprising games.</TE>
<TE>   Against Indianapolis on Oct. 21, he became the first NFL player in
22 years to run for a touchdown, catch a touchdown pass, and throw a
touchdown pass in a game.</TE>
<TE>   The next week against Denver, he caught a touchdown pass, had a
13-yard run, and made a tackle. And, oh yeah, threw an interception.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Belichick, a former New York Jet defensive coordinator, used to
have to prepare for Marshall Faulk twice a season when Faulk was
playing for Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Asked how he felt when Faulk was traded to St. Louis, Belichick
said it "was one of the happiest days of my life."</TE>
<TE>   "I was happy to get rid of him for two games a year," Belichick
said. "Of all the players in the league, Marshall Faulk is probably
the hardest to match up against."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Outspoken Patriot linebacker Bryan Cox has given serious
consideration to coaching an NFL team or working as a general manager
after his playing career is over. But he doesn't like his odds.</TE>
<TE>   "I continue to talk about all these things that I could do," he
said. "But at this time, the chances of me becoming a head coach or a
general manager in this league, being a minority, are not very good.
Compared to baseball and basketball, the NFL [stinks] in that area.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the fact of the matter. It's not good in that area. So for
me to be a minority and for me to say that one day I'm going to be a
head coach or a general manager, I'm kidding myself. That's a dream."</TE>

<HD>Tyson Looks to L.A.</HD>
<DH>Boxing: Heavyweight, facing new rape allegations, to apply
for California license to fight Lewis at Staples Center.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Shelly Finkel, Mike Tyson's manager, says his fighter will apply to
the California State Athletic Commission for a license to fight
heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis at Staples Center sometime this
spring.</LD>
<LD>   The next commission meeting is Feb. 9.</LD>
<LD>   "We would very much like to hold the fight there," Finkel said.</LD>
<TE>   "It's up to the commission," Staples Center president Tim Leiweke
said. "Assuming they approve, yes, we would be interested, but it's
such a fluid situation right now."</TE>
<TE>   Tyson had signed to fight Lewis on April 6 at Las Vegas' MGM Grand
Garden Arena, but MGM was forced to drop out Tuesday after the Nevada
State Athletic Commission denied Tyson a boxing license by a 4-1
vote.</TE>
<TE>   If Staples Center is occupied on the date requested, the Forum
would also be a possibility, according to Leiweke.</TE>
<TE>   He conceded he couldn't match the site fee of more than $10
million put up by the MGM Grand.</TE>
<TE>   "That site fee was based on gaming revenue," Leiweke said.</TE>
<TE>   No one in the commission office wouId comment Wednesday, but it
appears it will be extremely tough to get commission approval. The
California commissioners will be under pressure to follow the lead of
the Nevada commissioners, who--in rejecting Tyson's bid--cited his
failure to continue the psychological treatment and medication
prescribed for him three and a half years ago as a condition for
fighting in Nevada, along with his role last week in a brawl with
Lewis at a New York news conference.</TE>
<TE>   California commissioners may have even more serious concerns to
deal with. Las Vegas police revealed Wednesday they are investigating
a second felony rape allegation against Tyson.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Las Vegas police said they had found probable cause to
charge Tyson with sexual assault in an earlier case. According to
police and prosecutors, a woman they said had been in a six-month
romantic relationship with the former two-time heavyweight champion
went to a Las Vegas hospital in mid-September with injuries she said
she suffered when Tyson raped her at his Las Vegas home.</TE>
<TE>   The newest allegation concerns a November 2000 incident with a
woman police identified as an out-of-state resident in her 20s.</TE>
<TE>   Clark County District Attorney Stewart Bell told the Associated
Press it could be "a few days or several months" before his office
decides whether to prosecute either of the cases.</TE>
<TE>   Referring to the second allegation, Booker Evans, a Tyson
attorney, said legal authorities "have committed to allow Mr. Tyson's
legal team to present favorable evidence prior to any charges being
filed."</TE>
<TE>   With the allegations hanging over him, the only venues open to
Tyson might be overseas. Promoters from South Africa joined those
from Denmark Wednesday in expressing interest in the fight.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not in a position to charge him yet," Bell said. "We would
be reluctant to let someone leave the country if we had any doubt we
could find him if we needed to, but he's easy to find."</TE>
<TE>   In London, Lewis expressed an interest in going ahead with the
match after appearing to waver in a statement released after
Tuesday's hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "My main aim for staying around is Mike Tyson," Lewis said. "It's
the last notch on my belt, icing on my cake. I would love it to
happen before I retire."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis said he required a tetanus shot after Tyson bit a chunk of
flesh out of his left thigh during last week's melee. But the
champion described as "minor setbacks" the brawl and the Nevada
commission ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "He took a bite of me," Lewis said, "and I want to take a bite of
him."</TE>

<DL>EUGENE, Ore.</DL>
<LD>The screeching sound at Oregon's McArthur Court tonight will be UCLA
trying to put the brakes on the Ducks' fast-paced offense.</LD>
<LD>   Oregon loves a footrace, and has won enough to be tied for the
lead in the Pacific 10 Conference. UCLA also liked life in the fast
lane early in the season, but has come to realize patience has its
virtues.</LD>
<LD>   "We know their offense wants to score quickly," Bruin guard Rico
Hines said. "But we don't want to shoot fast. We want to make them
play defense for 35 seconds. They won't want to play defense that
long. They want to get the ball back and score."</LD>
<TE>   UCLA Coach Steve Lavin isn't against his team scoring in
transition. But he doesn't want the Bruins dashing down the floor on
offense simply because the Ducks are doing so.</TE>
<TE>   "When we have opportunities in the break we want to take
advantage," Lavin said. "But when we are playing against a set
defense, we want six or seven touches on the leather and get deeper
into the shot clock. We want our shooters to get fouled and get some
of their key players in foul trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Oregon has several scoring threats. Guards Frederick Jones, Luke
Ridnour and Anthony Lever are excellent three-point shooters and
forward Luke Jackson is versatile.</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>

<TE>   Site--McArthur Court, Eugene.</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KXTA (1150).</TE>
<TE>   Records--No. 13 UCLA 14-5, 6-3 in Pac-10; Oregon 15-5, 7-2.</TE>
<TE>   Update--The Bruins could use a quality road victory on their
resume before NCAA tournament seeding takes place. Beating the
co-leader in the Pac-10 at The Pit would qualify. The Ducks are 11-0
at home for the first time since 1937-38 and are 7-2 in conference
games for only the second time. Jones (16.4 points), Jackson (15.5)
and Ridnour (14.9) are prolific shooters.</TE>

<DL>CORVALLIS, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Given USC's success with its full-court press last weekend, it would
seem natural for the Trojans to employ it tonight against Oregon
State and its plodding, deliberate style, right?</LD>
<LD>   "That's what I expect to do, right from the beginning," Trojan
senior point guard Brandon Granville said. "We're probably going to
come out and try to put a lot of pressure and get the game up-tempo,
cause a lot of chaos."</LD>
<LD>   The Trojans pressed Stanford enough Saturday to force 27
turnovers.</LD>
<TE>   And Oregon State is not Stanford. In Pacific 10 Conference games,
the Beavers are the lowest-scoring team in the league (64.0) and the
worst rebounding team (29.3). But they are  second in three-point
field goal percentage (42.1%) and in scoring defense (67.7).</TE>
<TE>   "Oregon State plays such a methodical game that it kind of throws
you off a little bit," USC Coach Henry Bibby said. "They're very
precise in what they do. They're very slow and they don't pick up the
pace, so ... we're going to try to pick up the tempo a little more.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the press, but I don't like to press all the time. I think
there are areas and times that you press, but I'm not a 40-minute
press guy."</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   at Oregon State, 7</TE>
<TE>   Site--Gill Coliseum, Corvallis.</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KMPC (1540).</TE>
<TE>   Records--No. 23 USC 15-4, 7-2 in Pac-10; Oregon State 10-9, 3-6.</TE>
<TE>   Update--Oregon State has lost 11  games in a row to nationally
ranked teams. The Beavers, riding a modest two-game winning streak,
have not won three  consecutive league games since 1999. Jerry
Dupree, who is attending a funeral, and Derrick Craven, who has
personal business, did not make the trip for USC.</TE>

City</KH>
<HD>Yagudin's Passion Plays Out on Ice</HD>
<DH>Figure skating: Three-time world champion's rivalry with
Plushenko expected to decide the gold.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He sobbed in his coach's arms when he knew he had won the Grand Prix
Final, overcome by the joy of achieving the redemption he so
desperately wanted after a year of physical and emotional struggle.</LD>
<LD>   Alexei Yagudin wasn't ashamed to reveal his emotions to his coach,
Tatiana Tarasova, or to the world on that day last December. The
three-time world figure skating champion from Russia leads with his
heart, a trait that could be his strength at the Salt Lake City
Winter Olympics but also carries the potential to be his downfall.</LD>
<LD>   "It means a lot for me," he said of his victory over rival Evgeny
Plushenko, achieved by a 4-3 margin in the final part of the
three-phase competition.</LD>
<TE>   "I was sure I was capable and I was ready to skate good this year
but still, until you face the competition, it's hard to prepare for
something.... I kind of lost that power in myself and it was really
hard last season for me to believe that actually I could beat him,
because he was so good all the time and I had a terrible season last
year. I was pretty scared. I began to cry because I've been waiting
for this for a long time."</TE>
<TE>   Yagudin, 21, hadn't defeated his younger compatriot in a major
competition since the 2000 World Championships at Nice, France. In
that event Plushenko, then 17, fell apart in the long program, while
Yagudin landed two quadruple jumps in winning his third consecutive
title.</TE>
<TE>   But Plushenko, a superb technician, beat Yagudin last season at
the Russian and European championships, the Grand Prix Final and the
World Championships, ending Yagudin's reign. Haunted by that loss,
Yagudin worked himself into a frenzy last summer.</TE>
<TE>   Obsessed with the notion that losing weight would enhance his
speed and jumping ability, he shed nearly 20 pounds, but was too weak
to perform well at the season-opening Goodwill Games in September. He
finished third behind Plushenko and Michael Weiss of the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "It affected my whole life," he said of losing the world title. "I
was alone for the whole summer. I was working so much. I was not
eating....</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty hard to see yourself in second place, and that's part
of my life. I'm happy, at least, that's in the past. I'm looking to
the future," said Yagudin, who has since moved back up to a healthier
weight. "I feel really good and I feel that I am back."</TE>
<TE>   Yagudin and Plushenko seem to have made a game of dodging each
other. They had no overlapping Grand Prix assignments this season,
and after Yagudin pulled out of the Russian championships because of
an ankle injury, Plushenko withdrew from the European championships
because of a groin injury.</TE>
<TE>   That merely enhances the drama that will unfold at Salt Lake City,
where Yagudin and Plushenko will compete, quad for quad, for the gold
medal.</TE>
<TE>   They are unquestionably the class of the pack. Tim Goebel of the
U.S. is in their class as a jumper but lacks their refinement and
musicality. U.S. champion Todd Eldredge is expressive, but he lacks
the Russians' technical prowess. And Russia's Alexander Abt, who
trains at Lake Arrowhead and was second at last month's European
championships, doesn't have their international success or
experience.</TE>
<TE>   All signs point to Yagudin or Plushenko standing atop the podium
at Salt Lake City. But will it be Plushenko, who inexplicably hid his
talents behind herky-jerky music and garish costumes at the Grand
Prix Final? Or the soulful Yagudin, who acknowledges having been
"maybe wild" when he was younger but denies persistent rumors that a
drinking problem led to his expulsion from the 2000 Tom Collins
Champions on Ice tour?</TE>
<TE>   Even the experts can't pick a winner.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Plushenko is just a touch stronger from a technique point
of view," said Ilia Kulik of Russia, the 1998 Nagano gold medalist.
"When I watch jumps, I see cleaner technique in Plushenko's jumps
than Yagudin's jumps. But Yagudin is a touch physically stronger and
he can compensate sometimes for a couple of technical mistakes ... It
will be fun to watch who can handle it."</TE>
<TE>   Viktor Petrenko, who in 1992 became the first skater from the
former Soviet Union or its republics to win the men's singles gold
medal, also sees little separating them.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they're both very strong technically and artistically,"
Petrenko said. "The good thing about them is that they both present
two different styles.</TE>
<TE>   "Their technique has a different level. Plushenko is more like an
entertainer. Yagudin is more like a drama skater. All his programs
are like that. It depends on who likes what, an entertainer or
drama."</TE>
<TE>   Yagudin's dramatic gifts spring from the events of his life.</TE>
<TE>   He was born in St. Petersburg, Russia, a sickly child whose
mother, Zoya, took him skating when he was 41/2 to improve his
health. His parents divorced when he was 12 and his father,
Konstantin, moved to Germany, severing contact with his wife and
son.Young Alexei took to skating quickly. Under the tutelage of
Alexei Mishin, a former pair skater who had coached Alexei Urmanov to
the 1994 Olympic gold medal, Yagudin became the world junior champion
in 1996 at age 15 and won his first senior title in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   But he and Mishin, both strong personalities, clashed. Mishin had
other students who needed his time, among them Urmanov and Plushenko.
Yagudin didn't want to share Mishin--particularly with Plushenko. The
former rinkmates barely speak.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say that we are close friends, but we are from the same
team and we just compete against each other," Yagudin said. "We can
talk, but still I don't have anything to say to him and he probably
doesn't have anything to say to me. But of course we say to each
other, 'Congratulations.' If I win, he'd say this to me. If he
wins--and that was often last season--I say, 'Congratulations.'"</TE>
<TE>   Yagudin took the bold step in 1998 of leaving Mishin and Russia
for Tarasova and the U.S., settling first in New Jersey and later in
Newington, Conn. He won the 1999 and 2000 world titles under
Tarasova, but seemed to have a tough time adjusting to a new culture
and new riches and was sent home from the 2000 Tom Collins tour.</TE>
<TE>   Collins declined when asked to discuss what happened.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a touchy issue," he said. "It's a buried thing, and I want
it to stay buried."</TE>
<TE>   But insiders say Yagudin was rowdy, destructive and allegedly
drank too much.</TE>
<TE>   Yagudin, however, claimed he didn't know why he was expelled. He
also said he didn't abuse alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just a little bit silly maybe," he said. "But right now I
am a little bit more focused. I never had a problem.... When people
see me in a bar, drinking wine, they think I am sitting there a long
time. But that is not true.</TE>
<TE>   "We are the same [as non-skating] people. We have birthdays. There
is time to have a glass of wine. There is nothing bad about that.
People like to talk about that. There's nothing bad about it. I know
myself and I'm fine with that."</TE>
<TE>   He also knows and uses his skating assets: fast footwork,
exceptional jumps and a theatricality that enthralls audiences. He's
evocative in his "Winter" short program, tossing ice chips into the
air like snowflakes at one point to create a contemplative mood. He's
bold and forceful in his "Man in the Iron Mask" long program, using
swift turns and thrusts to pantomime the climactic fencing scene.</TE>
<TE>   But he also has a sharp sense of humor. During the exhibition that
followed his victory at Skate Canada, he joined ice dancers Shae-Lynn
Bourne and Victor Kraatz to form an impromptu threesome.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have to be just technically strong. We also have to be
artists on the ice," he said. "You have to play with the crowd and
make them more interested in figure skating.</TE>
<TE>   "It's boring doing the same thing all the time. You want to
change, and that's what I try to do on the ice. I try to change
things a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   Although he has lived in the U.S. for nearly four years and plans
to settle here, Russia remains in his soul.</TE>
<TE>   "I am still Russian and I am really proud of my home country," he
said. "Unfortunately, we are not doing that well as, for example,
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "But I am still going to be Russian the rest of my life and I'm
really proud of that.... The Russian people, they won almost every
war they were in ... They like to fight until the end. That's what I
am like on the ice."</TE>
<TE>   He has one more big fight coming at Salt Lake City. And although
he was admittedly far from his best at the European championships,
Yagudin is confident he will be the victor.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm 100% sure that I'm capable to be really really good and to be
first. Now, for sure, I believe in myself and my power," he said. "I
feel like I'm back on my track. It feels like I'm the real Alexei
Yagudin."</TE>

<HD>Cheney Faces Suit Over Energy Panel</HD>
<DH>Politics: The vice president claims legal privilege to conceal who
helped him form policy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The General Accounting Office, the investigative agency of
Congress, announced Wednesday that it would sue the White House for
refusing to reveal the inner workings of Vice President Dick Cheney's
energy task force, foreshadowing a high-stakes constitutional battle
laced with political overtones.</LD>
<LD>   The struggle over executive privilege--the right claimed by the
president to withhold information from Congress or the judiciary--has
been simmering since last spring, when the GAO initially sought
information about the energy task force and was rebuffed by the White
House.</LD>
<LD>   That dispute gained momentum in recent weeks as it became intertwined
with the Enron Corp. collapse. Questions arose over the now-bankrupt
company's role in the task force that produced the administration's
controversial national energy policy last spring.</LD>
<TE>   Under public and congressional pressure, Cheney recently disclosed
that he or his staff met with Enron representatives six times while
preparing their plan.</TE>
<TE>   But both he and President Bush have flatly rejected efforts seeking
more information about meetings between the vice president and his staff
and outside interest groups and experts.</TE>
<TE>   That White House stance is supported by congressional GOP leaders but
has perplexed many rank-and-file members, who fear that such obstinacy
will feed public perceptions that the Bush administration and the GOP are
too cozy with big business--and that they may have something to hide.</TE>
<TE>   The GAO will make history when it files its lawsuit in U.S. District
Court here next month; never in the agency's 80-year history has it sued
the executive branch. The suit is expected to be filed in the next two to
three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts differed on the merits of the case, but some joined the
large body of political analysts in forecasting that the White House--for
practical, if not legal, reasons--eventually will turn over the
information.</TE>
<TE>   "In the long run, [presidents] usually give in--after they've been
pilloried for covering up," said Georgetown University law professor Sam
Dash, former chief counsel to the Senate Watergate Committee, which
clashed repeatedly with the Nixon White House.</TE>
<TE>   Harold H. Bruff, dean of the University of Colorado Law School, added:
"My prediction is that if Congress wants to push hard, they will get the
stuff from Cheney--end of story."</TE>
<TE>   As their lawyers prepare for legal combat, the dispute's central
players--Bush, Cheney and GAO Comptroller General David M.
Walker--already are waging a vigorous battle in the court of public
opinion, reflecting the political stakes involved.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and Cheney insist that they are standing up for "the executive
branch's ability to conduct business," as the president put it Monday.
The White House also portrays the GAO's demands as a fishing expedition.</TE>
<TE>   Walker argues that Congress is entitled to such information as a part
of its constitutional oversight responsibilities, noting that four Senate
committee chairmen, all Democrats, have instructed the GAO to go after
the information. He has said that agency was prepared to go to court last
fall but set the issue aside after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Walker insisted that "a significant majority" of Republicans "are with
us."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Walker noted that Bush has yet to officially claim
executive privilege in the matter.</TE>
<TE>   "If he does that, it's a new ballgame. The GAO would have to
reconsider whether to continue to go to court," Walker said.</TE>
<TE>   USC constitutional law professor Erwin Chemerinsky described the clash
as one involving "two interrelated questions: the scope of Congress'
investigative power and the scope of executive privilege."</TE>
<TE>   But there are few court cases on the controversy because most such
disputes have been settled out of court, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The leading case is United States vs. Nixon, the landmark 1974
decision arising out of former President Nixon's attempt to keep secret
White House tapes that special prosecutor Leon Jaworski was seeking as
part of the Watergate investigation.</TE>
<TE>   In a unanimous ruling, the Supreme Court acknowledged that there was
an inherent right of executive privilege--but then flatly rejected
Nixon's contention that he alone determined its scope.</TE>
<TE>   The language of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, a 1972 law that
governs how federal advisory committees operate, indicates that Cheney
would have to reveal the membership of the task force, said Noah Feldman,
a constitutional law professor at New York University.</TE>
<TE>   "Traditionally, executive privilege has been extended to the substance
of what people said to the president and not to the identity of who spoke
to him. To withhold identities would go beyond what executive privilege
has meant in the past," Feldman said.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Wednesday, the pressure on the White House escalated on two
other fronts.</TE>
<TE>   The San Francisco Chronicle reported that Kenneth L. Lay, the recently
ousted chairman of Enron, had handed Cheney a three-page document in
April arguing against price caps on electricity, which were being sought
by California officials to stabilize prices there.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, the Natural Resources Defense Council filed a motion
asking the federal court here to compel the Energy Department to hand
over documents about Cheney's task force.</TE>
<TE>   Bush spoke about the dispute during a Rose Garden session with
reporters on Monday, calling the demands by Congress for such information
an "encroachment on the executive branch's ability to conduct business."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>Data Hint at End of Recession</HD>
<DH>U.S. economy: Report says growth resumed last quarter. The Fed
keeps rates stable, citing prospects for recovery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The U.S. economy grew slightly during the final quarter of 2001,
the Commerce Department said Wednesday, surprising analysts and
suggesting that the recovery may have already begun.</LD>
<LD>   Within hours of the government's upbeat report, the Federal Reserve
announced it will leave interest rates unchanged, ending a yearlong
streak of back-to-back rate reductions designed to counteract the
downturn.</LD>
<LD>   But Washington officials and Wall Street economists warned against
reading too much into the fourth-quarter figures. The uptick is a
preliminary estimate that could be revised downward, and the recovery,
even if underway, may prove anemic.</LD>
<TE>   "There's enough wiggle room in the numbers that I wouldn't say the
recession's over, but there definitely are signs of an upturn," said
Chris Varvares of Macroeconomic Advisers in St. Louis. "What's still at
issue is how vigorous it will be."</TE>
<TE>   President Bush, whose push for passage of an economic stimulus package
could be undermined by a recovery, found himself downplaying Wednesday's
data. "Today's GDP report is positive, but we cannot take growth and job
creation for granted," he said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's gross domestic product, the broadest measure of U.S.
economic activity, expanded at an annual rate of 0.2% in the fourth
quarter, the Commerce Department said. The increase reflected strong
consumer spending, particularly on autos, and surging government outlays
in the aftermath of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   GDP declined 1.3% in the third quarter, and the consensus view of
analysts was that it would shrink by 1% or more in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   The standard definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of
GDP contraction, so if the GDP numbers hold up, the nation would have
technically skirted a recession.</TE>
<TE>   However, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the
official arbiter of economic cycles, the recession began in March. If the
economy began expanding in the fourth quarter, the downturn would turn
out to have been as short as a recession can be, and unusually mild. But
the official group would still consider it a recession.</TE>
<TE>   "Recession is a loaded word," said economist Ian Shepherdson of Higher
Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. "But the unambiguous, undeniable
thing that screams out of this report is that the economy did a heck of a
lot better in the fourth quarter than just about everybody expected."</TE>
<TE>   The positive interpretation was endorsed by the Fed's Open Market
Committee, which emerged from a two-day meeting to announce it would keep
the benchmark federal funds interest rate at 1.75%. It was the first time
since December 2000 that the rate-setting panel left the key short-term
rate unchanged.</TE>
<TE>   "Signs that weakness in demand is abating and economic activity is
beginning to firm have become more prevalent," the Fed said in a
statement. "With the forces restraining the economy starting to diminish,
and with the long-term prospects for productivity growth remaining
favorable and monetary policy accommodative, the outlook for economic
recovery has become more promising."</TE>
<TE>   The announcement appeared to lift spirits on Wall Street, which
rallied from losses earlier in the day. The Dow Jones industrial average
rose 144.62 to close at 9,762.86, while the Nasdaq composite index
climbed 20.45 to 1,913.44. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index increased
12.93 to 1,113.57.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed warned, however, that the strength of business and household
spending remain uncertain, and that it would continue to err on the side
of monetary easing. Many economists do not expect the central bank to
begin raising rates again until the job market firms, possibly late in
the year.</TE>
<TE>   "The job market is going to be very slow to turn around," said Allen
Sinai of Primark Decision Economics in New York. "Aggressive hiring, or
even a return to normal hiring practices, still seems a long way off."</TE>
<TE>   Don Wainwright, chairman of the National Assn. of Manufacturers and
chief executive of Wainwright Industries in St. Peters, Mo., said he
expects the recovery to proceed slowly, with little immediate effect on
employment. More than 1 million factory jobs have been lost since the
economy began to soften.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't see a lot of hiring going on right now," Wainwright said
in an interview with several reporters. "If anything, with the [negative]
earnings that are going to be released in this quarter, we could see some
more layoffs."</TE>
<TE>   The economy's fourth-quarter growth was fueled by a 5.4% increase in
consumer spending, which has remained surprisingly resilient throughout
the economic downturn. Spending on big-ticket durable goods soared 38.4%,
led by record auto sales as Americans responded to interest-free
financing and other incentives.</TE>
<TE>   Another big contributor was government spending, which jumped 9.2% as
Washington responded to the Sept. 11 attacks with emergency outlays for
New York reconstruction, homeland security and the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Business investment continued to fall, however, and firms reduced
their inventories at a record clip. But economists noted that the rate of
inventory reduction should begin to slow soon, stimulating increased
factory production and, eventually, job creation.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said the strong consumer spending reflected in Wednesday's
figures show that last year's tax cuts helped soften the blow of the
recession. He urged lawmakers to enact another package of tax re ductions
and spending to make sure the recovery doesn't falter.</TE>

<KH>THE FALL OF ENRON</KH>
<HD>Enron's Web of Complex Hedges, Bets</HD>
<DH>Finances: Massive trading of derivatives may have clouded the
firm's books, experts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL A. HILTZIK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As accountants and investigators begin poring over Enron Corp.'s
books, they are likely to collide head-on with a factor that makes its
finances particularly impenetrable--the extent to which the company
relied on financial instruments known as commodity derivatives to inflate
income, hide losses and misrepresent the true nature of its business.</LD>
<LD>   Although to this day Enron is generally known as an energy trading
company, a close review of financial records and interviews with
accounting experts show that at its heart it had become a massive trading
operation in derivatives, which are financial contracts that can entail
significant risks.</LD>
<LD>   Missteps in such trading have cost highly sophisticated investors
billions in past years. Among other cases, derivatives trading was behind
Orange County's bankruptcy filing in 1994 and the failure of Barings Bank
in 1995.</LD>
<TE>   Derivatives, which come in many forms, allow investors to bet with
other investors on changes in an underlying asset or index, such as
stocks, interest rates, weather or electricity prices. Properly used,
derivatives are effective at hedging against an almost infinite variety
of business risks ranging from crop failures to changes in interest rates
and oil prices. But they can sharply exaggerate market gains or losses.</TE>
<TE>   There are signs that, in the company's hands, derivatives evolved into
more than risk-hedging devices. They became tools of fiscal concealment
and manipulation, some experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, derivatives allowed Enron to inflate the value of
its assets and transactions while understating their risks and obscuring
their real nature, they say.</TE>
<TE>   "Enron used derivatives to manipulate accounting standards and tax
reporting," said Randall Dodd, head of the Derivatives Study Group, an
economics watchdog. "They used them to fabricate income. It was a bit of
a shell game."</TE>
<TE>   Enron spokesman Mark Palmer on Wednesday declined to discuss the
company's accounting. He said the issue "is being investigated by a
special committee of our board, the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the Department of Justice. They may reveal facts that may lead us to
take further action."</TE>
<TE>   It is still unclear to investors and government investigators how big
a role losses on these contracts played in Enron's collapse. Nor is the
full extent of the damage yet known. Some analysts believe the company
still may be losing money on some contracts.</TE>
<TE>Much Derivatives Trading Unregulated</TE>
<TE>   Enron could engage in its complex trading strategy without fear of
regulatory intervention because the government explicitly exempted much
derivatives trading from oversight. That's at least in small part because
of a ruling by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's former
chairwoman, Wendy L. Gramm, just five weeks before she joined the Enron
board in 1993. Gramm is the wife of Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas).</TE>
<TE>   The trading market for the contracts has blossomed in the last decade,
with nearly $100 trillion traded worldwide as of last June, according to
the Bank for International Settlements.</TE>
<TE>   Most of these were so-called over-the-counter or OTC
derivatives--those not traded on a registered futures or options
exchange, but rather contracts between big investors.</TE>
<TE>   Enron did not entirely conceal that aspect of its business. As early
as October 1999, its then-chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, told
CFO Magazine that the company's finance business would "buy and sell risk
positions."</TE>
<TE>   "Enron may have been just an energy company when it was created in
1985," said Frank Partnoy, a law professor at the University of San Diego
who testified before the Senate last week. "But by the end it had become
a full-blown OTC derivatives trading firm."</TE>
<TE>   The world of derivatives was almost tailor-made for the aggressively
secretive Enron. Accountants still have not settled on a consistent way
to represent their value and risk on a company's books. The relevant
standard set by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, an independent
agency that sets guidelines for corporate auditors, is Rule 133--a
behemoth that stands at more than 800 pages.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's derivatives-related assets soared to $21 billion in 2000 from
$3.1 billion the year before, according to the company's 2000 annual
report. This enormous growth, apparently related to its Internet trading
system, Enron Online, made it the fifth-largest commodity derivatives
dealer in the U.S., according to figures compiled by Swaps Monitor, a
market research firm.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the company also reported last year that its net
financial exposure to derivatives was only $66 million. Although that
figure tripled from the year before, analysts contend that it is absurdly
low, considering that a large portion of the contracts covered long-term
energy deals subject to dramatic price fluctuations.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly these values are no longer credible," said Robert McCullough,
a Portland, Ore., energy consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's accounting treatment of these highly complex transactions,
including stock options and loan guarantees, raises the possibility that
millions more in liabilities lie concealed in transactions yet to be
unwound.</TE>
<TE>   In one deal alone, a financing arrangement with a partnership called
Whitewing, formed to hold a melange of Enron assets including a Brazilian
utility and European power plants, Enron's exposure to losses may be as
much as $2.1 billion rather than the $600 million the company has
disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   "These are transactions evolving daily, but disclosed only
periodically," said McCullough, who analyzed the deal. "This is a bucking
bronco by any investment standard."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, because trades in OTC contracts are entirely unregulated,
"OTC derivatives dealers don't have to register, report, maintain a
capital base," Dodd said. "You could set up a lemonade stand and run a
$250-billion derivatives book."</TE>
<TE>   Former regulator Gramm's ruling covered only a small category of swaps
negotiated between two parties. But it helped open the floodgates to a
huge variety of derivatives contracts, which were labeled "swaps" to fit
within the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it was unclear whether all OTC derivatives could remain
unregulated indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   Banks, hedge funds and traders, including Enron and its fellow energy
trading companies, strove desperately to keep government hands off. They
argued that the participants in the market were mostly huge institutions
savvy enough to protect themselves from fraud without government help.</TE>
<TE>   When the Commodity Futures Trading Commission proposed in 1998
regulating the OTC market, "the large derivative interests, including
Enron, went up in arms," recalled I. Michael Greenberger, then the
commission's director of trading and markets and now a law professor at
the University of Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   The traders won the battle in December 2000, when Congress passed a
law rendering OTC derivatives permanently exempt from regulation.</TE>
<TE>   Around that time, Enron's participation in the market mushroomed.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's ability to keep losses off its books through complex swaps and
option contracts is demonstrated in its deal with Raptor, one of the
investment partnerships about which Enron Vice President Sherron S.
Watkins raised questions in a now-famous anonymous letter in August to
Chairman Kenneth L. Lay.</TE>
<TE>   Enron had transferred to Raptor ownership of $1.2 billion in shares in
Rhythms NetConnections, a high-tech company whose stock had rocketed in
value after Enron invested in it. Enron recorded the transfer as a
financial gain, but did not clearly disclose that it also entered a
derivatives contract that required it to cover Raptor's losses if Rhythms
declined in value, as it eventually did.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the web of this transaction, hundreds of millions of dollars in
losses in Rhythms fell through the cracks, unrecorded on Enron's books.
The complexity confounded Watkins.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't find an equity or debt holder that bears that loss," Watkins
told Lay. Nevertheless, she suspected the truth--that the losses belonged
on Enron's books. "If it's Enron," she wrote, "then I think we do not
have a fact pattern that would look good to the SEC or investors."</TE>
<TE>   In at least one case, Enron apparently used derivatives to help
inflate the value of an asset as it was transferred off its books. This
may have allowed the company to revalue similar assets that remained in
its hands, using the inflated value as a benchmark.</TE>
<TE>   The asset in question was "dark" fiber-optic cable that Enron
transferred in June 2000 to LJM2, a partnership managed by Fastow, then
its own CFO. At the time the real value of dark fiber--installed data
lines not yet equipped to carry traffic--was conjectural. About 40
million miles of fiber optics had been installed in the U.S., but within
a year a glut would bankrupt several communications companies.</TE>
<TE>   LJM paid $100 million in cash and credit to Enron, which promptly
claimed a $67-million profit on the deal, suggesting that the real value
of the fiber was $33 million.</TE>
<TE>   LJM subsequently transferred most of the fiber to yet another
Enron-associated partnership, this time for $113 million. This step
implicitly revalued the fiber at more than triple its original value.</TE>
<TE>   Supporting the second sale, however, was a derivative issued by Enron,
in effect covering any loss the buyers might incur if the fiber's value
collapsed, as it did during 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually Enron would have to declare the loss on its own books. But
Watkins' letter suggests that this would not happen until the
partnerships were closed out in 2002 and 2003--years after Enron reported
a profit from the original sale.</TE>
<TE>'Not the Only One of Its Kind'</TE>
<TE>   Analysts suspect deals like this were more common than Enron has
disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems likely that the 'dark fiber' deal was not the only one of
its kind," Partnoy said last week in testimony before Congress.</TE>
<TE>   He and others also believe that Enron traders may have manipulated
their profit and loss figures by improperly valuing derivative contracts
in illiquid markets--that is, those in which there is so little activity
that a small transaction can move prices sharply. These include contracts
to deliver energy at some point far in the future; indeed, the company
disclosed that at year-end 2000, it held about $13 billion in energy
contracts denominated in terms of up to 24 years.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer, the Enron spokesman, rejected any suggestion that the
company's traders manipulated energy prices. "This is stuff that's in the
past and been investigated by half the Western world," he said, referring
to probes of West Coast electricity price spikes during the power crisis
last year. "We need to look ahead, not engage in this sort of
proctology."</TE>
<TE>   Accountants are well aware that such derivatives are prone to
"mismarking."</TE>
<TE>   "We recognize that some fair values are more difficult to set than
others," said Timothy S. Lucas, director of research and technical
activities for the Financial Accounting Standards Board. "In some cases,
we may not have a really good idea of fair value."</TE>
<TE>   To some professionals this is only a further sign that Congress erred
in removing OTC derivatives from regulatory oversight.</TE>
<TE>   "OTC derivatives are as powerful as futures and securities,"
Greenberger said. "If there's anything we're learning, it's that the big
boys maybe can't take care of themselves."</TE>

<HD>Warning to 3 Nations Downplayed</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Bush was not revealing strike plans against Iraq, Iran
or North Korea, aides say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Despite his threatening words toward the three nations he
characterized as the "axis of evil," President Bush apparently does not
intend to launch major new military initiatives against Iraq, Iran or
North Korea--yet.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. officials scrambled Wednesday to temper the tone of the
president's first State of the Union speech, in which he said the United
States "will not wait on events while dangers gather," specifically
citing the three nations' programs on weapons of mass destruction.</LD>
<LD>   For now, administration sources said, the Bush administration does not
intend to break off efforts to negotiate a missile deal with North Korea
that would end its production and exporting of ballistic missiles. The
administration's offer of a dialogue with Iran on nuclear, biological and
chemical weapons and other disputes is still on the table. And its top
demand of Iraq is still that Baghdad allow U.N. inspectors to return
after a four-year absence to track and destroy Iraq's remaining weapons
of mass destruction.</LD>
<TE>   "The president emphasized his determination on this issue but did not
change current efforts or U.S. strategy," a senior administration
official said Wednesday. "He did not take anything away from the military
options, but he did not name the next three countries the United States
is going to attack."</TE>
<TE>   At the White House, spokesman Ari Fleischer said the use of the term
"axis of evil" was "more rhetorical than historical," referring to the
use of the term "axis" to describe Germany, Italy and Japan during World
War II.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's an expression of how serious the president takes protecting
our country. As the president said, time is not on our side. The
president will be deliberate," Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   With the war in Afghanistan still its primary focus, the Bush
administration appears to be conducting psychological warfare against the
three regimes. The White House is not cutting off the prospect of
diplomacy, but the president did signal a greater willingness to act
decisively if the three governments continue to balk.</TE>
<TE>   Baghdad, Tehran and Pyongyang have effectively been put on formal
notice that their actions are now high on the U.S. list of foreign policy
priorities--and Washington will not allow them to stall indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   "I will not wait on events while dangers gather--the United States of
America will not permit the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us
with the world's most destructive weapons," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   The United States is, however, already trying to increase the pressure
on all three countries, according to U.S. officials. The State Department
hosted Russian officials this week for talks on further limiting Moscow's
military exports to Tehran. Washington has also become more insistent
about arrangements for inspections in North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   But the president's pledge to "do what is necessary" did set off a
storm of reaction Wednesday in all three capitals.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi officials scoffed at Bush's charge that Baghdad has been
plotting to develop anthrax, nerve gas and nuclear weapons. A senior
member of the ruling Baath party charged that Washington is preparing the
world for another American offensive in the oil-rich Gulf nation.</TE>
<TE>   "Little Bush's accusation against Iraq is baseless," said Salim
al-Qubaisi, chairman of the parliament's foreign relations committee.
"The American administration led by Bush has been threatening Iraq from
time to time to prepare world public opinion for a new aggression against
Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   However vague Bush's threats were, they encouraged leaders of the
opposition Iraqi National Congress, who were in Washington on Wednesday
and secured renewed U.S. funding--$2.4 million over three months--for its
campaign to overthrow Saddam Hussein. The funding had been suspended over
an accounting dispute, and the new money is considered a stopgap measure
while that dispute is investigated.</TE>
<TE>   In Iran, Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi rejected Bush's allegations
that Tehran "aggressively pursues" weapons of mass destruction and
exports terror "while an unelected few repress the Iranian people's hope
for freedom."</TE>
<TE>   Kharrazi told state-run radio that Washington should provide proof of
its charges.</TE>
<TE>   "We reject the U.S. accusations and we think that the world will not
tolerate the hegemony of the U.S," he said. "The American president had
better back up his assertions with evidence instead of repeating old and
unfounded claims. . . ."</TE>
<TE>   Former president Hashemi Rafsanjani, now head of Iran's powerful
Expediency Council, condemned Bush's "combative tone." "It is possible
that Americans will cheer Bush as the congressmen did, but we will not be
threatened by such aggressive language," said Rafsanjani, as quoted by
state-controlled media.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea also blasted the U.S. administration for charging that it
has missiles and other weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   A commentary in the state-owned media said the "U.S. loudmouthed
threat" was intended to justify the U.S. military presence in South Korea
and a policy of aggression against the communist regime.</TE>

<HD>Immigration Judges Call for Independent Court</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GETTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>In a rebuke to Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, the nation's immigration
judges are asking Congress to remove their courts from control of the
Justice Department.</LD>
<LD>   The judges are particularly concerned about complaints that America's
"core legal values" have been compromised since the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks, according to a 20-page report sent to Congress by the union
representing the judges.</LD>
<LD>   This is the first time the judges have taken a public stand on an
issue since their union was created 23 years ago. The report follows a
series of executive orders by Ashcroft that limited the judges'
discretion in hundreds of cases of immigrants detained after Sept. 11 and
kept secret hearings that would normally be open.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not something we take lightly in doing. As employees of the
Department of Justice we don't have a lot of freedom to speak out," said
San Francisco Immigration Judge Dana Marks Keener, speaking as president
of the National Assn. of Immigration Judges, the AFL-CIO-affiliated union
that represents the 220 judges.</TE>
<TE>   The union's report concludes that a separate court is the only way to
restore public confidence. "It is the most fundamental aspect of due
process that one be given the opportunity to present one's case and
confront the adverse evidence in an impartial forum," the report states.
"At present, there is at least the perception that this is not always
provided."</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department spokesman Dan Nelson said Wednesday that the agency
would not support the judges' proposal "principally because the
immigration courts and Board of Immigration Appeals exercise the
authority of the attorney general to enforce the immigration laws of the
United States."</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft said previously that, since Sept. 11, his office has sought
to strike a balance between the rights of detainees and the need to
protect the United States from further attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The report, which was obtained by The Times on Wednesday, will be used
to lobby Congress. It calls for creation of a new agency in the executive
branch to house the judges, one that would guarantee "independence and
impartiality in the hearing process." The judges currently work for the
Executive Office for Immigration Review, an arm of Justice that was
created in 1983. The judges used to work for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service. But that posed a potential conflict because INS
lawyers argue the government's cases before the judges.</TE>
<TE>Conflict of Interest Seen as 'Pervasive'</TE>
<TE>   The judges say that the conflict still exists. "The taint of inherent
conflict of interests caused by housing the Immigration Court within the
DOJ is insidious and pervasive," the union's report says.</TE>
<TE>   The judges say that INS influence over the Justice Department's
immigration policies and practices spills over into judicial matters.
They cite Ashcroft's Oct. 31 rule that allowed the INS to override
immigration judges' decisions to release Sept. 11 detainees on bond.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the issues in the union's report have been smoldering for
years. In 1996, Congress mandated that immigration judges had the right
to cite people in their courtrooms with contempt. But before the mandate
could become law, the attorney general had to write rules for how the
power could be used.</TE>
<TE>   No such rules were ever written. The reason: the INS objected. The
judges cite that as a "blatant example" of the immigration service's
undue influence in their department.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Keener said due process protection for immigrants cannot be
guaranteed when the same person--the attorney general--oversees the
judges and the INS. The report notes that the attorney general's dual
role "creates, at the very minimum, the appearance of partiality. Thus it
is not surprising that the public perceives this system as 'rigged.' "</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Commission for Immigration Reform, a bipartisan panel
appointed by Congress, came to the same conclusion in 1997, noting that
the judges should not be in the same department as the "enforcement
agency that is initiating the proceedings against the alien."</TE>
<TE>   The union has hired Bill McCollum, a former Republican congressman
from Florida, to pitch their case on Capitol Hill. McCollum had
introduced a bill in recent years that would have created a separate
federal court for immigration judges, but his plan did not have
widespread support.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what our chances of success are," McCollum said of the
judges' new proposal. "They have been after this for some time. This is
an opportune moment."</TE>
<TE>   But some congressional aides were pessimistic. "I don't think it would
receive an enthusiastic reception on the House side," said Jeff Lungren,
spokesman for the House Judiciary Committee. He said some members think
the judges need more accountability, not more independence.</TE>
<TE>   The judges' proposal comes amid plans to reorganize the INS. After the
terrorist attacks, Ashcroft said he wanted to restructure the agency that
oversees the judges as well. But he has offered no details, except to say
he wants to reduce the backlog of cases. His top aides have privately
told the immigration review office that he wants the judges "on the same
page" as the rest of the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   The union's report notes that a new agency for the judges would free
the Justice Department "to focus its mission on the prosecution of those
in the United States illegally--an increasingly compelling focus." Rick
Kenney, the spokesman for the immigration review office, said the
department would not comment on the union proposal. "They have a right to
petition government officials outside this agency. We don't monitor that
and we don't make comment on that," Kenney said.</TE>
<TE>Arbitrary Justice Is Cited in Study</TE>
<TE>   A Los Angeles Times study last year of U.S. immigration courts
documented a system of arbitrary justice, in which similar cases would
have widely varying outcomes, depending on the judge hearing the case.
Immigrants are not entitled to government-paid lawyers for immigration
court hearings. Most immigrants did not have lawyers, but those who did
were 17 times more likely to win their cases.</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, Ashcroft tightened the rules for hundreds of mostly
Middle Eastern men held on immigration violations. Although federal
regulations gave judges the right to close hearings on a case-by-case
basis, he ordered that every Sept. 11-related case be closed. Detainees'
names are not even listed on court dockets.</TE>
<TE>   Justice officials have said the measures were necessary to protect
against disclosure of information that might compromise federal
investigations into the Sept. 11 terrorist hijackings and other possible
plots.</TE>
<TE>   "Strong criticism has been leveled against the president, the attorney
general and the Department of Justice that legal rights have been
curtailed in the aftermath of Sept. 11," the judges wrote. "There are
those who say the terrorists have won if we abandon the freedoms which
characterize the American way of life."</TE>
<TE>   They conclude that an independent immigration court would ease those
criticisms and "go a long ways towards achieving the appropriate balance
between fundamental fairness and security concerns."</TE>

<HD>L.A. to Integrate Disabled Pupils</HD>
<DH>Reform: The change will end special education schools, mainstream
35,000 students. Critics, backers agree that huge financial and emotional
challenges are ahead.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Unified School District is starting a dramatic
overhaul of its special education programs, aiming to place into regular
classes 35,000 disabled students who now are segregated. The reforms will
end separate schools for disabled children over the next four years.</LD>
<LD>   Virtually all 660 campuses in the district will be affected as many
physically and psychologically handicapped youngsters currently in
separate classes join mainstream students, officials say. Sixteen special
education centers will be at the forefront of the integration.</LD>
<LD>   Many parents of disabled children welcome the shift, which comes as a
result of a 1996 settlement of a federal lawsuit and a recent
implementation plan. Some families worry whether the children, whose
disabilities can include cerebral palsy, blindness, retardation and
severe learning problems, will be traumatized in regular classrooms. Some
mainstream teachers fear that disruptions in already difficult classroom
situations could hinder other children's learning.</LD>
<TE>   Though many details remain to be worked out, everyone agrees that
there are huge financial costs and emotional challenges ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking about a real cultural change in the embracing of all
children and meeting the needs of all children," said Donnalyn
Jacque-Anton, assistant superintendent for special education.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say the changes are long overdue, and that the Los Angeles
district lags behind other big cities.</TE>
<TE>   For example, San Francisco began integrating its disabled students
five years ago and New York City started four years ago, although those
and other large systems report that making the changes was difficult,
especially in recruiting teachers and adapting buildings.</TE>
<TE>   "LAUSD operates the biggest segregated system in the U.S.," said
Robert Myers, attorney for parents in the federal lawsuit which alleged
that handicapped children were getting an inadequate education. "Our
system is inferior, and it is getting in the way of students'
development."</TE>
<TE>   Studies show that most physically and psychologically disabled
students progress faster when they are placed in at least some classes
with non-disabled peers. In Los Angeles only 18% of all disabled children
attended regular classes last year; that is less than half the national
average.</TE>
<TE>   Under the integration plan, most Los Angeles district schools,
including 16 current special education centers, would have a disabled
student population of no less than 7% and no more than 17% of their
enrollments.</TE>
<TE>   Most special education youngsters would attend mainstream schools, and
many would spend at least part of the day in special classes as more than
45,000 already do. Exceptions would be made for some who are deaf or
severely disabled.</TE>
<TE>   District officials say tens of thousands of teachers and principals
will need extra training and buildings will require renovation at a cost
of millions, but details haven't been worked out.</TE>
<TE>   "We're at the planning and implementation stage," said Supt. Roy
Romer. "But we don't have all the answers."</TE>
<TE>   He said he is uncertain whether the goals are reachable by the
federally mandated deadline of 2006. Other educators point out that Los
Angeles schools also will have to contend with budget shortfalls and a
lack of qualified teachers.</TE>
<TE>   Alejandro Hernandez looks forward to mainstreaming. His 4-year-old
daughter, Marijose, has a genetic disorder that has left her unable to
speak, walk or feed herself. Though he is pleased with her classes at
Willenberg Special Education Center in San Pedro, he would rather his
daughter attend school with non-disabled peers.</TE>
<TE>   "My daughter is so happy when she hears other kids singing, laughing,
talking," he said. None of Marijose's current classmates can talk. An
integrated class will be "better for her development."</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Unified plans to build on the successes at Alfonso B. Perez
School in East Los Angeles. Perez has 430 special education students,
ages 3 to 22. Some are in wheelchairs, others wear braces to hold their
heads up; some teenagers wear diapers.</TE>
<TE>   About 100 non-disabled children also attend Perez, mostly taught
separately but integrated during recess and lunch.</TE>
<TE>   Wendy Matsutani, the school's Title I coordinator, said parents of
non-disabled students were attracted to the teachers' expertise and the
tolerant atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   Principal Beverly Feinstein is not certain that classroom integration
will work districtwide. Mainstream teachers "have their plate full with .
. . reading and math," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Some parents and educators worry that regular classrooms won't offer
disabled children the attention they need and that the youngsters may be
stigmatized by non-disabled students.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not going to accept these children," said Lisa Delgado, whose
16-year-old severely disabled daughter, Jennifer, attends Perez. Jennifer
was mainstreamed in kindergarten, but moved to Perez when she started
having daily seizures. She is mute and immobile.</TE>
<TE>   "Can the district really say they can provide for my daughter in a
general education setting?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Mendoza tried to place her 17-year-old disabled son, who cannot
speak, in a regular school but he was badly teased there. "I saw my son
suffer," she said. "When the bus arrived here to pick him up, he didn't
want to go." He is now at Frank D. Lanterman High School, a special
education campus.</TE>
<TE>   Cal State Los Angeles education professor Mary Falvey, who co-wrote
the integration plan, said the goal is an inclusive environment where
such traumas are rare.</TE>
<TE>   "The more kids go to school together," she said, "the more likely they
are to accept each other. And, yes, this will be tough."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles district officials said special education teachers will
still concentrate on children with disabilities. But in some cases, they
will be in a regular classroom, helping its teacher. Some special
education teachers fear that will mean double duties for them.</TE>
<TE>   Tonya Hollis-Theus, PTA president at Clover Avenue Elementary School
in West Los Angeles, has doubts about the plan.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm all for putting special needs students in a regular class, but
the district needs to provide teaching assistants in the class to assist
on an individual basis," she said. "With the recent cutbacks, I don't
think they can provide that."</TE>
<TE>   The plan resulted from a 1993 class-action suit initiated by the
family of Chanda Smith, then a disabled Los Angeles student who flunked
10th grade twice after her requests for help were denied.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit was among similar cases that swept the nation after
passage of the 1973 Individuals With Disabilities Act required schools to
provide extra assistance to children with special needs. The U.S.
Department of Education has repeatedly found Los Angeles out of
compliance with the law.</TE>
<TE>   Falvey, the Cal State L.A. professor, said there should be
opportunities for even the most severely disabled students to be included
in regular activities as lunch and assemblies. "To the maximum extent
possible, they should be educated in the same classrooms [as general
students]," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The district has $93 million in annual contracts with about 85
nonpublic special schools for the severely emotionally disturbed,
autistic or learning disabled. The district must try to reduce such
referrals.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Gartner, a special education consultant, agreed that almost any
disabled child can be integrated to some degree.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a question of what the district is willing to do," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A key finding in the federal court's investigation into Los Angeles
was that too many African American children were identified as disabled
and too few limited English speakers.</TE>
<TE>   Over the past two years, New York schools reduced the number of
children defined as disabled from 160,000 to 140,000 by making more
careful evaluations, said Francine Goldstein, who oversees New York's
special education programs.</TE>
<TE>   Deborah McKnight, interim director of the San Francisco Unified School
District, said that nearly all of the system's 7,100 special education
students go to regular classes for at least part of the day.</TE>
<TE>   However, it has been difficult to retrain regular teachers, and there
is a shortage of special education instructors. The change in San
Francisco has been, she said, "very hard. It's an ongoing process."</TE>

<HD>Palestinian Bomber Stood Out From the Rest</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Wafa Idris, 30, the first female suicide attacker, grew up
in a Fatah family.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARJORIE MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>Wafa Idris told her friends and family in the Al Amari refugee camp
that she wanted to sacrifice herself for her country, but they didn't
believe her.</LD>
<LD>   She was a supporter of the Fatah movement of Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat, they said, not an Islamic extremist. She was a
volunteer Red Crescent paramedic who risked her life to save others. Most
important, she was a woman, and all 46 of the suicide bombers who had
attacked Israel in the 16-month Palestinian uprising were male.</LD>
<LD>   Then they heard that the 47th bomber was a woman.</LD>
<TE>   "My heart began to pump faster," said Idris' mother, Wasfiyeh. "I
feared it was her."</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, a Palestinian woman with doe-brown eyes and softly curled
hair carried a knapsack full of explosives into the heart of Jerusalem.
When she blew herself up, she also killed an 81-year-old Israeli man and
wounded scores of other people.</TE>
<TE>   For days, no one claimed responsibility for the attack. No videotaped
testament appeared, and no one set up a mourning tent for the shahid--the
martyr--as Palestinians usually do after a suicide bombing. Israeli and
Palestinian authorities said they were stumped.</TE>
<TE>   But Idris' family knew that she had not returned to the one-room
cinder-block home she shared with her mother, and the truth gradually
dawned on them. On Wednesday, they received confirmation that the
30-year-old was the first female suicide bomber of the intifada.</TE>
<TE>   The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a militia affiliated with Fatah, claimed
responsibility for the attack in a leaflet that began circulating in
Ramallah early in the day. By nightfall, posters began to appear on walls
around this West Bank city showing Idris and the Fatah insignia. The
Palestinian liberation movement and the Al Amari refugee camp "proudly
announce the first heroine martyrdom operation inside the Zionist
entity," the posters proclaimed.</TE>
<TE>   "She said it was better to die a martyr than to live in humiliation,"
said her sister-in-law, Wisam Idris. "But we were shocked. We didn't
expect her to do this."</TE>
<TE>   That may have been the point. Palestinian women have been involved in
a few recent terror attacks. In one case, a woman allegedly led a suicide
bomber in August to his target at a pizzeria in Jerusalem, an attack that
killed 16 people.</TE>
<TE>   In another, Amneh Mona befriended an Israeli over the Internet and
lured him to Ramallah, where Fatah activists killed him last January. She
is serving a life sentence in an Israeli jail.</TE>
<TE>   But no one expected a Palestinian woman to commit the ultimate act of
desperation--to blow herself up. Israeli police still wonder whether
Idris detonated the bomb intentionally or was killed in a premature
detonation, but either way, the attack has forced Israeli officials to
redraw the profile of a suicide bomber and to reconsider the security
threat that Palestinian women may present to Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   Idris apparently had no problem entering Jerusalem from Ramallah. She
didn't attract attention until she entered a shoe store, looked around
nervously and left without buying anything. Before anyone could react,
there was a devastating explosion.</TE>
<TE>   At a neighbor's home in the Al Amari camp, her mother sat cross-legged
on a floor cushion hugging a photograph of Idris and alternating between
grief, anger and the pride she knew she was supposed to feel for a child
who had given her life in the struggle for a Palestinian homeland. She
was surrounded by family and friends in mourning.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had known what she was going to do, I would have stopped her,"
she said. "I am proud of her, of course. But I still feel sad."</TE>
<TE>   Why did Idris take her own life to kill an Israeli?</TE>
<TE>   "There was nothing specific, no one thing. It was what she saw every
day at work with the ambulance, all of the people who were wounded and
killed by the Israelis," her sister-in-law said.</TE>
<TE>   Idris grew up in a Fatah family. Her older brother, Khalil, was
arrested for being a Fatah member in 1985 and spent eight years in an
Israeli prison.</TE>
<TE>   "We were schoolmates, and we used to visit our brothers in prison
together," friend Itimad abu Libdeh said.</TE>
<TE>   Idris was a founder of the Fatah women's committee in the refugee camp
and spent a lot of time visiting families of prisoners and "martyrs"
during the first intifada, which began in 1987. She married, lost a baby
to a miscarriage and divorced, but her friends rejected the idea that
this drove her to desperation.</TE>
<TE>   "Her love for her homeland and her love for martyrdom was such that I
don't think that if she had children it would have changed her mind," Abu
Libdeh said.</TE>
<TE>   "She was very strong-willed," her friend said. "She was very active
and always wanted to join demonstrations. She would say: 'I wish I would
be sacrificed for the country. I want to do something for the country.' I
thought she was joking."</TE>
<TE>   She wasn't. Idris woke early Sunday, dressed and bid her mother
goodbye, saying she was late for her volunteer work at the Palestinian
Red Crescent Society. But Idris wasn't scheduled to work Sunday and never
showed up at the Ramallah headquarters, according to the coordinator,
Hossam Sharkawi.</TE>
<TE>   "Typically, she worked Friday and during the clashes," he said. "She
worked in the ambulances. She evacuated victims, and she did first aid.
That's what we know her as."</TE>
<TE>   But he and others were left wondering just how well they knew Idris.
Was she traumatized by all that she saw, including the 15-year-old boy
shot twice in the head during a demonstration 10 days ago? Sharkawi
didn't know.</TE>
<TE>   Did she have a secret life with a clandestine paramilitary
organization? Her brother Khalil didn't know. Neither did her
schoolmates.</TE>
<TE>   "No one would do something like this on her own," Abu Libdeh said.
"She had to have someone behind her."</TE>
<TE>   Like the dozens of other women who came to pay their respects to the
grieving family, Abu Libdeh said she admired her friend for what she had
done. The women said they had no qualms about killing Israeli civilians,
because, they said, Israelis kill Palestinian civilians.</TE>
<TE>   "I think she will be a role model," Abu Libdeh said.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have any objections to a woman doing anything like this,"
Idris' mother added. "If I could do it myself, I would."</TE>

<HD>It's Japan, for Crying Out Loud</HD>
<DH>Many are upset over premier's remark--after official's
outburst--that tears are the ultimate female weapon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO
</DL>
<LD>This land of stalwart samurai and knife-wielding ninja is getting
positively teary-eyed.</LD>
<LD>   The spigots opened a few days ago, before Foreign Minister Makiko
Tanaka was fired Tuesday for squabbling with political rivals. As the
pressure mounted, the nation's top diplomat, a woman so tough she's been
called "an untamed stallion," cried in public.</LD>
<LD>   The next day, archrival Muneo Suzuki, a conservative lawmaker credited
with helping engineer her downfall, shed a few of his own tears. Whipping
out a handkerchief, he told voters in his constituency how hard his early
life had been compared with many of his political colleagues--i.e.,
Tanaka--who were born into elite political families.</LD>
<TE>   Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, who has admitted to getting
misty-eyed himself listening to Elvis songs or seeing romantic movies,
added to the ruckus by volunteering that tears have long been the
ultimate female weapon.</TE>
<TE>   That prompted a countercharge Wednesday from opposition lawmaker
Tsuyoshi Saito, among others, that Koizumi's comments were decidedly
sexist.</TE>
<TE>   The government's four remaining female Cabinet ministers were then
paraded before parliament to give their views on tears, women and
weaponry. Justice Minister Mayumi Moriyama acknowledged that women's
tears can be a powerful force in weakening men's resolve. Then again, she
added, men's tears can have the same effect on women.</TE>
<TE>   Chikage Ogi, Japan's strong, steady transportation minister, said she
cries a lot and finds it cathartic. "I think tears are little treasures,"
she said. "They're like jewels."</TE>
<TE>   Tears have sometimes played a prominent role in the U.S. political
landscape, undercutting at various times the careers of former lawmakers
Edmund S. Muskie and Pat Schroeder, even as a discreet sob at a funeral
or disaster site has boosted the fortunes of others.</TE>
<TE>   But Japan, with its often sharp distinction between public and private
behavior, has long considered public tears by prominent social and
political figures a major faux pas. This tradition dates at least to the
nation's long feudal period.</TE>
<TE>   "Suppressing your emotions in Japan has been a mark of the samurai
spirit," said Takashi Tomita, psychology professor at Komazawa Women's
University. "Keeping your eyes dry has been a virtue."</TE>
<TE>   Virtually the only acceptable form of male tears in Japanese
literature or Kabuki theater occurs when a master says goodbye to a loyal
subordinate after losing a great battle, mindful that the two will never
meet again, said Masahiro Ueno, communications professor at Shizuoka
University of Arts and Culture.</TE>
<TE>   "Even kamikaze pilots during World War II would only tie a banner on
their heads and say goodbye," Ueno said. "While they may have cried in
secret, they never did so in public."</TE>
<TE>   After World War II, more women entered politics, bringing with them a
less militaristic mind-set. As newcomers in a traditional world, however,
they were also under strong initial pressure to conform.</TE>
<TE>   "Women didn't cry in the political arena," independent political
analyst Minoru Morita said. "It was important to look tough in a man's
world."</TE>
<TE>   A lot has changed as the nation debated whether Suzuki and Tanaka's
tears were even real--one political satirist quipped that the foreign
minister must have used eyedrops--and as another weepy episode down the
road at the sumo ring is earning unabashed praise.</TE>
<TE>   In a sport known for its tough, loincloth-clad giants, sumo fighter
Tochiazuma sobbed on national television Sunday evening after
unexpectedly winning a tournament. "Seeing his tears, I felt his passion
for victory," gushed one fan in the daily Tokyo Shimbun newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few years, Japanese society has been softened markedly,
with several men turning into veritable weeping willows. A key juncture
came in November 1997, when Shohei Nozawa, then president of the failed
Yamaichi Securities, sobbed in shame at a news conference announcing the
firm's bankruptcy. Although fellow executives criticized him at the time,
the depth of his emotion moved many Japanese.</TE>
<TE>   In mid-2000, the governor of Kagawa prefecture cried at the suffering
of local residents when a long-standing industrial waste lawsuit was
settled. In March 2001, Japan's defense minister wept while apologizing
for a rape by a Japanese soldier. And Sunday, a food company executive
cried after admitting a scheme to defraud taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the past five years, things changed a lot," said Isamu Saito,
social psychology professor at Tokyo's Rissho University. "Men started
crying all over the place. The price of men's tears has become quite
cheap."</TE>
<TE>   Political analysts say sobs from a strong woman such as Tanaka
arguably engender stronger public sympathy than male tears these days,
particularly among her middle-aged female supporters, of which she has
many.</TE>
<TE>   Telephone operators at ruling Liberal Democratic Party headquarters
Wednesday morning recorded more than 600 calls during a four-hour period,
10 times the usual volume, with 80% strongly against Koizumi's decision
to sack her.</TE>
<TE>   The tears of her rival Suzuki, however, were viewed far more
skeptically. "Tanaka's tears were heartfelt," political analyst Morita
said. "But Suzuki's were a joke. He tried to follow her lead, but tears
and his [tough] personality just don't go together."</TE>
<TE>   Experts attribute Japan's growing weepiness in part to foreign
influence and to despair.</TE>
<TE>   The cultures of Europe and the U.S. over the last several decades have
bolstered the idea that it's acceptable, even desirable, to express your
emotions, said Tomita of Komazawa Women's University, while television
and movie cameras have zeroed in on tears, sending a similar message.</TE>
<TE>   "The media love to show tears," said Chio Saito, leader of the Agora
Woman Rights Network. "It's become something of a cheap show."</TE>
<TE>   Also, experts say, Japan has a lot to cry about as its economy
founders, crime increases and many of its social institutions break down.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people in Japanese society these days feel trapped, like
there's no way out," Tomita said. "People feel more like crying, like
there's no way to survive."</TE>
<TE>   Koizumi tried to defend his statement that tears were a traditional
female weapon during questioning in parliament Wednesday. But several
members of women's rights groups remained sharply critical. "Koizumi's
comments show a real lack of basic respect for women," said Midori Ito,
an official with the Tokyo Women's Labor Union.</TE>
<TE>   Koizumi's comments were particularly ironic given how hard he's
courted the women's vote, others said. "He was the one who tried to be so
liberal and recruit as many women into the Cabinet as he could," said
Hisae Makino, a 54-year-old homemaker. "Now he's essentially saying that
women are too emotional and aren't logical. It's absolutely incredible."</TE>
<TE>   As Japan struggles with its emotions, some believe that all these
overactive tear ducts are a bit much.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand Tanaka may have been having a tough day," said Kichiya
Kobayashi, an independent political analyst. "Still, ministers and
lawmakers really should be more conscious of their position in society
and avoid crying in public."</TE>

<HD>Lawmakers Ban Stem Cell Imports in German Vote</HD>
<DH>Science: Only existing embryos in the country can be used for
research, Parliament decides. Some see a blow to promising treatments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN
</DL>
<LD>German lawmakers Wednesday rejected a move to allow imports of
embryonic stem cells for research, ignoring the pleas of a paraplegic
politician as well as the warnings of scientists that the search for
medical breakthroughs will go on elsewhere.</LD>
<LD>   The vote after nearly five hours of debate made one concession to the
scientific community, allowing research on 40,000 existing embryos.</LD>
<LD>   The excess embryos had been created here for in vitro fertilization
and frozen in the event their use in regenerating tissue and organs might
one day be approved.</LD>
<TE>   However, the "no, but" option--one of three measures facing the
lawmakers Wednesday--clearly forbids using any stem cells created in
Germany for infertile couples in the future or acquiring them from
countries with more liberal laws governing biotechnology.</TE>
<TE>   Germany has one of the world's most prosperous biotech industries,
partly the result of a generously funded higher education system. But the
industry has also benefited from the return of successful genetics and
genome specialists who made discoveries achievable only in less
restrictive environments such as Britain and the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Most biotechnology research was forbidden here through the 1980s,
chasing the leading researchers to foreign laboratories, where they
developed everything from artificial insulin to procedures that have
helped crack the human genetic code.</TE>
<TE>   The curbs on biotechnology have been eased over the past decade, but
Germans outside the scientific community remain deeply distrustful of any
activity that can be construed as human engineering. They also are
stridently opposed to genetic modification of crops and foods.</TE>
<TE>   Still haunted by the country's Nazi past, when scientists engaged in
human experimentation, Germans remain more wary than many Europeans of
the risks of letting scientific opportunity undermine the dignity of
mankind.</TE>
<TE>   In the process of harvesting stem cells--the master cells that govern
the development of tissues and organs--scientists destroy the fertilized
eggs they are taken from, thus inviting the debate over when life begins.</TE>
<TE>   As in the clash over abortion, opponents see the fertilized eggs as
unborn life, while proponents see the opposite, saying early-stage
embryos aren't viable outside the womb.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters also argue that stem cells hold the promise of generating
tissues and organs that could cure the sick and disabled.</TE>
<TE>   One advocate of the defeated move to approve stem-cell imports, former
Christian Democratic Union leader Wolfgang Schaeuble, who was paralyzed
in a 1990 assassination attempt, urged fellow lawmakers to broaden their
views about what constitutes an infraction of human dignity.</TE>
<TE>   Embryonic stem cells could enable doctors to reverse the afflictions
of those with damaged organs, spinal cords or debilitating illnesses such
as diabetes or Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, the conservative
noted.</TE>
<TE>   "Man's striving for ever more knowledge is an aspect of human life
that makes it unique," Schaeuble argued before the packed session of the
Bundestag, the lower house of Parliament. "Scientific freedom to develop
the possibilities for improving the quality of life is part of this
inviolable respect for mankind."</TE>
<TE>   Others pushing for relief from restrictions on embryonic research
asked their legislative colleagues how Germany will react when cures and
treatments are developed in other countries and are available only to
those Germans who can afford to travel and pay for services deemed
criminal in their own country. The deeply emotional debate cut across
political lines, with both left-leaning Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and
the head of the opposition Christian Democrats, Angela Merkel, arguing
for some liberalization and keeping the door to discovery open.</TE>
<TE>   The Bundestag members faced three choices Wednesday: to allow imports
of embryonic stem cells for scientific research; to ban such imports but
permit research on excess embryonic stem cells created here for in vitro
fertilization; or to ban any research on the cells.</TE>
<TE>   The vote came in two stages. The first ballot gave less than 20%
support for importing the cells, with the rest of the votes split almost
equally between the outright ban and the qualified rejection. The latter
option won, 340 to 265, on the second ballot as the disappointed
supporters chose the less restrictive of the remaining choices.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the research got backing from many of Germany's leading
scientific organizations, foremost among them the prestigious Max Planck
Society. Although he expressed disappointment that the most liberal
option was rejected, Peter Gruss, the incoming president of the research
network, said he was relieved that the political leadership refrained
from the outright ban.</TE>
<TE>   "If German scientists are to continue on the way to creating new
therapies, the German Parliament must take up this issue again in the
near future to allow Germany access to human embryos," Gruss said after
the voting.</TE>
<TE>   Pope John Paul II has long lobbied against the use of human embryos
for any scientific research, regardless of whether the embryos were
created for that purpose or left over from in vitro fertilization. But as
evidence of the prevailing mixed emotions and confusion, even heavily
Roman Catholic Italy has no law on the subject.</TE>
<TE>   Britain allows research on embryos up to 14 days old for fertility
purposes and, since a year ago, for work on developing therapies for
serious diseases. Spanish politicians are pressing for a law similar to
Britain's, and French lawmakers are expected to relax a 1994 ban on such
research later this year, with the bill sailing through Parliament on its
first reading last week.</TE>
<TE>   The Swedish Research Council has also recently deemed therapeutic
cloning of tissues and organs "ethically defensible," although like the
French and the British, the Swedes remain broadly opposed to human
cloning.</TE>
<TE>   Embryonic stem cell research is also controversial in the United
States, with a bill that would outlaw the practice making its way through
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Work on adult stem cell lines--and on embryos in countries, such as
Britain, where some such work is permitted--is showing much promise as
regenerative therapy that could improve the quality of life for the
disabled and prolong it for the terminally ill.</TE>
<TE>   Current German laws forbid the creation of embryos for research
purposes but have left vague the legality of importing cell lines. The
Bundestag vote, which will become law after expected upper house
approval, now makes it clear that all embryonic work, except on the
existing stock of frozen cells, is forbidden.</TE>

<HD>Mexico Ends Practice of Giving Land to Poor</HD>
<DH>Latin America: Government scraps program that symbolized nation's
revolution but became mired in corruption and disputes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY
</DL>
<LD>President Vicente Fox's administration has declared an end to the
85-year-old practice of making land grants to the poor, a program that
embodied the spirit of the Mexican Revolution but was rife with
corruption and property disputes.</LD>
<LD>   The agrarian reform movement, which had faded in recent decades,
transferred more than half of Mexico's arable land to the indigenous and
poor, most of them organized into communal groups called ejidos. About
30,000 such communal groups exist today, and there is little unoccupied
land left to redistribute.</LD>
<LD>   The move comes at a time when Mexican agriculture is in crisis,
hampered by urban migration, foreign competition resulting from
free-trade agreements and low productivity caused by laws that restrict
individual farm sizes to 256 acres, too small for the economies of scale
enjoyed by international giants.</LD>
<TE>   Agrarian Reform Secretary Maria Teresa Herrera Tello said Monday that
redistribution of land had failed to solve rural poverty and that the
government must redirect efforts into making farming more productive.</TE>
<TE>   While addressing rural Mexicans' yearning for land, the program's
vague ownership rules left a morass of title disputes. More than 343,000
such conflicts are now before special agrarian tribunals. Some of them
date to the 1940s, said Arturo Alvarado, a sociology professor at Colegio
de Mexico here.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a program that has pretended to deliver social justice but,
unaccompanied by government support or technical assistance, has often
just been a tool for political demagoguery," Alvarado said. Members of
the ejidos were perennially subject to political pressure from local or
federal bosses who threatened eviction, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The general disorganization and uncertainty of Mexican real estate
laws compounded the confusion. Ejido members fight among themselves as
much as with neighbors over property rights.</TE>
<TE>   Previous owners of land awarded to ejido members in the 1970s have
successfully gone to court to recover their property. One successful
appeal led to the eviction of hundreds of Baja California homeowners
south of Ensenada, many of them U.S. retirees, who had bought houses on
disputed land.</TE>
<TE>   Fox said Monday that the government will try to make legal reforms
that would settle ownership disputes. He said about 23,000 disputes were
resolved in 2001, his first full year in office.</TE>
<TE>   Fox is only the latest Mexican president to try to clarify property
ownership. As part of his extensive land reforms in 1992, then-President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari ordered a census of all ejidos and their
members. The initiative did little to untie the legal knots that plague
land ownership nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico's 1917 constitution guaranteed land to all citizens who could
prove they were poor, landless and bona fide members of certain
communities. With varying degrees of commitment, Mexican presidents
thereafter redistributed land, which frequently had been under the
control of huge estates.</TE>
<TE>   Land grants have slowly come to a stop since the early 1970s, when the
last spurt of transfers was made under President Luis Echeverria.</TE>
<TE>   Salinas' 1992 reforms included a clause that gave ejido members the
right to sell off entire grants or individual shares for private
development if they could establish ownership. The reforms also
eliminated the government's obligation to make land grants to qualified
groups, making it more discretionary.</TE>
<TE>   "Salinas tried to restore authority in these matters to the
communities themselves, for them to manage their land grants as they
chose, including selling land into the local real estate market," said
John Womack, a Harvard University history professor who has written
extensively about Mexican land policy.</TE>
<TE>   But less than 1% of all ejido land has been privatized during the past
decade, according to a spokesman for the Agrarian Reform Ministry, partly
because of the ownership disputes.</TE>

<LD>Investigators trying to determine what sank the Kursk nuclear
submarine say they have been surprised to find many documents preserved
by water and are hoping to find the ship's log. That could provide the
key to what caused the disaster.</LD>
<LD>   Lead investigator Artur Yegiyev said the papers survived because water
instantly flooded the control room after it was ripped open by a blast,
putting out flames.</LD>
<LD>   Since the Kursk was raised from the Barents Sea floor and put in a dry
dock in October, investigators have been examining the wreck for human
remains and clues about what brought down the vessel in August 2000,
killing all 118 crewmen.</LD>

<LD>After years of denials and painful negotiations, the Roman Catholic
Church in Ireland agreed to pay $110 million to people who were sexually
abused as children by priests, nuns and other church officials in decades
past.</LD>
<LD>   The deal was designed to conclude a 10-year struggle by the church to
overcome sex scandals involving its clergy going back to the 1940s.</LD>
<LD>   In exchange for the church's financial commitment, the government
agreed to indemnify the church against further legal action by victims in
Ireland. Any victim who accepts money from the fund must agree to drop
legal action against the church or state.</LD>

<HD>Milosevic Wants His Freedom Until War Crimes Trial Starts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>THE HAGUE
</DL>
<LD>Slobodan Milosevic vented his anger in war crimes court Wednesday,
saying he is being treated like a culprit rather than a victim and asking
the U.N. tribunal to free him until his trial begins in two weeks.</LD>
<LD>   The former Yugoslav president asked the five-member panel to order his
release, promising to return for a "battle I will not miss" when
prosecutors open their case against him Feb. 12.</LD>
<LD>   Milosevic appeared at an appeals hearing on a motion to combine the
three indictments against him into a single trial.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors said top witnesses who once were close to the ousted
leader might be unable to testify in The Hague more than once. They also
argued that the cases should be merged because the crimes Milosevic is
accused of--in Kosovo, Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina--were part of a
broad plan to create a greater Serbian state by clearing non-Serbs from
areas.</TE>
<TE>   The tribunal said it would deliver its decision later and did not
respond to Milosevic's plea for freedom.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in his six tribunal appearances, Milosevic was
allowed to speak at length, voicing the political theme he was not
permitted to deliver previously.</TE>
<TE>   "I would call this [trial] an evil and hostile action aimed at
justifying the crimes committed against my country," he said. Putting him
on trial was "an attempt to turn the victim into the culprit," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Milosevic is charged with 66 counts related to nearly a decade of war
in the Balkans, including a genocide charge resulting from the 1992-95
Bosnian conflict. He could be jailed for life if convicted.</TE>

<HD>India Says Militants Attempted an Incursion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>JAMMU, India
</DL>
<LD>India's army said Wednesday that Pakistani fighters from an Islamic
militant group had launched a major attempt to cross into the Indian-held
portion of Kashmir.</LD>
<LD>   The claim was likely to raise tensions between India and Pakistan,
which reinforced troops along their border after militants attacked the
Indian Parliament in December. Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee
said Wednesday that there are no plans to pull forces back.</LD>
<LD>   Lt. Col. H.S. Oberoi, an Indian army spokesman, said it was the "first
major attempt by Pakistan to send infiltrators into the Indian side"
since Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf announced a crackdown on
militant groups Jan. 12.</LD>
<TE>   There was no immediate reaction from Pakistan. The government denies
giving military or logistical support to Pakistan-based Islamic militants
fighting Indian rule in Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   Indian soldiers battled a group of gunmen that was discovered trying
to cross into Indian territory Tuesday night about 300 miles southwest of
Srinagar, the summer capital of India's Jammu and Kashmir state, Oberoi
said.</TE>
<TE>   Five bodies were recovered Wednesday along with five rifles, a pistol,
four antitank mines, explosives and documents indicating that the
intruders belonged to a Pakistan-based militant group, Hezb-i-Islami,
Oberoi said.</TE>
<TE>   He said Indian troops were searching for other members of the group
who they believe crossed into India.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a Pakistani official was killed and three people were
wounded Wednesday after Indian forces opened fire across the Kashmir
border, Pakistani officials said.</TE>
<TE>   They said an agriculture official from the Muzaffarabad district in
Pakistani-controlled Kashmir was killed when the jeep in which he was
traveling was fired on by Indian forces. Another person in the vehicle
was wounded, police and district officials said.</TE>
<TE>   A 16-year-old girl and a 26-year-old man were wounded by Indian fire
into two border villages in Pakistan's Sialkot district, Pakistani
military sources said.</TE>

<HD>Health at Issue as Mail Gets Irradiated</HD>
<DH>Safety: Post-anthrax complaints on Capitol Hill of headaches,
nausea, lead some to blame the Postal Service program.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Among the staff in Sen. Dianne Feinstein's Capitol Hill office, the
complaints have been numerous and disturbing: headaches, burning hands,
nausea and, in one case, a metallic taste in the mouth.</LD>
<LD>   The suspected cause: mail being irradiated by the U.S. Postal Service
to protect federal employees from additional bioterrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   By this week, enough Hill staffers had complained of problems that a
task force had been convened and top postal officials felt compelled to
call a news conference Wednesday to say they "knew of no medical link
yet" between the reported symptoms and more than 300,000 pieces of
government mail being sanitized daily.</LD>
<TE>   Feinstein (D-Calif.), has said she felt "strongly" that any health
problems related to the mail should be closely monitored. Other lawmakers
have echoed her concerns.</TE>
<TE>   The alarm about possible side effects from the treated mail--as well
as from the cleanup of anthrax-contaminated buildings--marks growing
worries in Washington that the efforts to protect people may well be
creating new hazards.</TE>
<TE>   Postal officials on Wednesday attempted to dampen concern about
handling the mail. They raised the possibility that unseasonably warm
weather here may be as much to blame for the reported symptoms as
anything else.</TE>
<TE>   "At this time we've found no medical or scientific link to the
problems--other than extra paper dust [caused by the irradiation] and
other environmental changes that have happened," Deborah Willhite, a
Postal Service vice president, said at a news conference at the agency's
headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Willhite said people prone to allergy or sinus troubles might be more
sensitive to the dust created by the irradiation procedure. But, she
said, they might also be affected by a string of 60-degree-plus January
days.</TE>
<TE>   In order to calm the nerves of postal customers beyond the nation's
capital, officials also stressed that plants in Ohio and New Jersey are
only irradiating government mail destined for Washington ZIP Codes that
start with 202 through 205.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a common misperception that we are irradiating mail that is
going throughout the country," said Thomas Day, the Postal Service's vice
president for engineering. "We are not."</TE>
<TE>   The move to irradiate the government mail, with doses that Day
described as "much higher" than those used for either food safety or
medical equipment, was made in the weeks after attacks through the mail
of anthrax killed five people and sickened at least 13 others.</TE>
<TE>   Federal law enforcement officials recovered anthrax-laden letters sent
to NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw, the New York Post, Senate Majority Leader
Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), and Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.). They believe
more likely were mailed to other media outlets where employees became ill
with the rare disease.</TE>
<TE>   The letters to Daschle and Leahy, investigators said, contained a
fine, powder form of anthrax spores. Officials believe the high quality
of the powder was responsible for the most serious inhaled cases of the
disease.</TE>
<TE>   Among the dead were two Washington-area postal workers, who initially
had been told they were not at risk. Postal officials decided to
irradiate mail coming to the federal government in Washington because
they believed workers here were at the greatest risk for more attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Public advocates, as well as some lawmakers and postal union
officials, question whether the move was an overreaction. Public Citizen,
a national consumer organization, has called for a moratorium on the
irradiation of the mail until officials have a better understanding of
its health effects.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, plans to expand the irradiation of mail now are on hold,
Day said, because of cost concerns and limited irradiation facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Postal officials have conceded that carbon monoxide can build up as a
result of the irradiation process, but said frequent testing of the mail
indicated gas levels at or below Environmental Protection Agency
standards.</TE>

<HD>Fewer Detainees Will Be Held at Cuba Camp, Rumsfeld Says</HD>
<DH>Prisoners: Besides cell shortage, disease issues, 'we're trying to
sort out the Al Qaeda and the more senior Taliban,' Defense secretary
says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld predicted Wednesday that the
number of detainees from the Afghan war taken to the U.S. naval base in
Cuba will be far fewer than the 2,000 earlier projected, and he said U.S.
military forces are still sorting through thousands of other captives to
determine where they should be sent.</LD>
<LD>   The lengthy process has prompted criticism of the Pentagon and of the
Bush administration because U.S. officials have not yet spelled out how
the detainees will be prosecuted. A growing number of civil liberties
groups, such as the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, is worried that
the longer it takes, the less likely the system will be fair.</LD>
<LD>   "We're concerned they are setting themselves up to become the world's
prison," said Liz Vladeck, a spokeswoman for the committee.</LD>
<TE>   Rumsfeld offered new insight into the process of how the detainees are
being handled, in the Middle East and in Cuba, and it suggests that it
has been a learning process for the U.S. military.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, while it originally was thought that as many as 2,000
detainees would end up at the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Rumsfeld now
believes that number will be much smaller.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be honest," he said. "The number is somewhere between, say, 400
and 2,000. I don't know where it is. I suspect it's closer to the bottom,
and therefore, I'm so conservative and respectful of taxpayers' dollars,
I'm disinclined to start ordering 2,000 permanent cells for those
people."</TE>
<TE>   So far, 158 detainees from at least two dozen countries are housed in
open-air cages on the base, where they are being interrogated while the
military begins the process of how to decide their fates. But the
Pentagon last week suspended all flights of detainees to the base, saying
that more interrogators were needed and additional cells had to be built.</TE>
<TE>   Once the flights are reinstated, Rumsfeld said, he would like to send
detainees to Guantanamo Bay in groups of about 30 at a time.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the problems is, there is an issue of tuberculosis, and there
is the question that the cells' proximity to each other suggests that you
may need two cells for a person that may have tuberculosis," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said Navy Seabees are working "24 hours a day" to build more
temporary cells. But Rumsfeld said the Pentagon has not yet ordered the
construction of permanent cells, and that he is waiting to find out what
the final number of detainees there will be.</TE>
<TE>   He said "thousands of these people" still are being held in Central
Asia by the Afghans, the Pakistanis and U.S. forces.</TE>
<TE>   "As we go through and look at them, we're giving a large number back
to the Afghans as people that were foot soldiers in the Taliban, and a
lot back to the Pakistanis that were foot soldiers in the Taliban," he
said. "And we're trying to sort out the Al Qaeda and the more senior
Taliban."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials have discussed four options for the detainees in
Cuba--a military tribunal, a federal court trial, deportation home, or
transfer to a third country for prosecution. Decisions will be made on a
case-by-case basis, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to find which countries may or may not be appropriate to
return their nationals so that they can process them," he said. "And
therefore, getting a fix on the total number of people that ultimately
would fit [and] would be appropriate to have at Guantanamo is an open
question."</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon sources said there also have been differences among the
various armed services about how the military tribunals should be set up,
further delaying the announcement of what will happen for many of the
detainees.</TE>
<TE>   But "they will not be characterized as prisoners of war," Rumsfeld
said, "because that is not what they are. They're terrorists."</TE>

<HD>Karzai Seeks More Peacekeepers</HD>
<DH>Security: The interim Afghan leader asks U.N. council to approve an
increase in troops. Washington and others oppose the idea.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS
</DL>
<LD>Afghanistan's new leader asked the Security Council on Wednesday to
approve the deployment of peacekeeping troops throughout his war-racked
country, a request opposed by Washington and the European powers leading
the small U.N.-backed force now in Kabul.</LD>
<LD>   "Security is the key issue" in Afghanistan today, interim Prime
Minister Hamid Karzai stressed in a brief but pointed address to the
Security Council. Saying he was reflecting a broad national consensus,
Karzai asked the council to increase the size and duration of the
peacekeeping mission, now restricted to Kabul, the capital, and scheduled
to end in May.</LD>
<LD>   "The extension of the presence of the multinational forces in Kabul,
and expanding their presence in other cities, will signal the ongoing
commitment of the international community to peace and security in
Afghanistan," Karzai said in his first appearance at the United Nations,
which engineered the installation of his government. "We hope that you
would authorize an extension and expansion of the mandate of these
forces."</LD>
<TE>   Although diplomats here say Karzai is unlikely to secure anything
close to the tenfold expansion of the force that some U.N. officials have
privately urged, many now expect the foreign military presence in
Afghanistan to grow larger and last longer than the council originally
envisioned.</TE>
<TE>   Donors cannot deliver the nearly $5 billion in aid recently pledged to
Afghanistan unless the government gets help in controlling criminal gangs
and tribal warfare, U.N. officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "Security is the foundation for peace, for stability and for
reconstruction as well," Karzai said in his speech.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai is riding a wave of popularity both at home and in Western
leadership circles, where he is viewed as an astute political mediator
with a sophisticated grasp of global politics--and an unassailable
domestic pedigree as an aristocrat from a leading tribe in the country's
dominant ethnic group.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush singled him out as an honored guest Tuesday at the
State of the Union speech, and Karzai was embraced by a clutch of
ambassadors here Wednesday morning like a triumphant athlete. His day in
New York also included a somber visit to the World Trade Center site,
where he left flowers, and a well-received speech to the Council on
Foreign Relations.</TE>
<TE>   "Karzai is considered the best possible partner, not only by the
United States, but by the rest of the Security Council," said a European
ambassador who asked not to be named.</TE>
<TE>   Many diplomats posted here don't disguise their hopes that Karzai will
emerge as Afghanistan's president if elections are held as expected next
year.</TE>
<TE>   "Our people deserve the creation of a democratic government, and we
intend to act on their wishes," Karzai promised the council Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The electoral process got underway formally last week, when the chief
U.N. envoy to Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi, named 21 people to a panel
that will in turn convene a loya jirga, or grand council. The loya jirga
will be charged with drafting a constitution and rules for electing a
permanent government.</TE>
<TE>   Informally, the election campaign may already have begun. After
Karzai's brisk, businesslike presentation to the Security Council, he
held a long and often emotional meeting with about 500 members of New
York's Afghan community a few blocks away at a midtown hotel. His
appearance prompted a thunderous ovation, followed by a rousing,
eye-misting chorus of the Afghan national anthem and the presentation of
enormous bouquets by children in traditional dress.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to his plea for outside military help to the Security
Council, Karzai spoke passionately to the New York Afghans of the need
for self-sufficiency based on "national unity" and a submergence of
ethnic differences.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to build a new future, a new Afghanistan, and in that
Afghanistan we are not going to seek revenge," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As Karzai noted--he pointed out, to enthusiastic applause, a row of
black-turbaned Afghan Sikhs on one side of the ballroom and a group of
Orthodox Afghan Jews to his left--the New York crowd itself reflected a
remarkably broad spectrum of Afghan society. He urged the diverse
assemblage of sharp-suited bankers, leather-jacketed workmen and
professional women dressed in both Park Avenue finery and elegant
traditional head scarves to "come back home and raise your children in
Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   But to lure back emigrant talent, he acknowledged, the new Afghanistan
must be governed "by the rule of law," and he made it clear at the United
Nations that he believes the country needs many more foreign troops in
more places to make that transition possible.</TE>
<TE>   About 2,000 foreign peacekeeping troops patrol Kabul and its environs,
and there are plans to boost that to 5,000 by the end of February.</TE>
<TE>   Authorized by the Security Council and commanded directly by British
Maj. Gen. John McColl, the multinational International Security
Assistance Force ultimately is subject to the control of the Pentagon,
which wants peacekeepers far away from areas where the U.S. is conducting
reconnaissance and combat missions.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, diplomats here say that Britain, France and other nations
with troops in Kabul fear that acceding to Karzai's request could lead to
an open-ended military commitment in Afghanistan and delay the creation
of a national security force.</TE>
<TE>   "All those who have troops on the ground are against it, and all those
who will never have troops there are for it," the European ambassador
said.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai didn't cite numbers in his request for more peacekeepers. But
the U.N.'s former top diplomat in the region, Francesc Vendrell, was said
to be reflecting the interim government's view when he called this month
for 35,000 foreign troops to be stationed around major transportation
routes and population centers.</TE>

<DH>Pakistan: Second e-mail warns that apparent captors will target
other U.S. journalists. It accuses seized writer of spying for Israel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB DROGIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A group claiming to have abducted a Wall Street Journal reporter in
Pakistan threatened Wednesday to kill him within 24 hours and then target
other U.S. journalists if they don't leave Pakistan in three days.</LD>
<LD>   An e-mail message from the purported kidnappers to the Los Angeles
Times and other U.S. and Pakistani news organizations included two new
photographs of journalist Daniel Pearl--one with a pistol aimed at his
head, the other showing his hands in chains. The message had a far more
menacing tone than a weekend e-mail that first served notice that Pearl
had been kidnapped.</LD>
<LD>   The new e-mail message says the group had wrongly accused Pearl of
spying for the CIA. Instead, the group claimed, Pearl works for the
Mossad, Israel's intelligence service.</LD>
<TE>   "Therefore we will execute him within 24 hours unless amreeka fifils
our demands," the group wrote, using odd misspellings, grammar and syntax
throughout the five-paragraph statement.</TE>
<TE>   The group apologized in advance to Pearl's family but added a cruel
promise--to send them food packages "just as amreeka apologized for
collateral damage and dropped food packets on the thousands of people"
killed during the war in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope Mr danny's family will be grateful for the food packets that
we send them just as the amreekan public expected the afgans to be
grateful for the food packets its airforce was dropping on them," the
group wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The e-mail message also charged that "many" U.S. journalists in
Pakistan work as spies. "Therefore we give all amreekan journlists 3 days
to get out of pakstan. anyone remaining after that will be targetted."</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of U.S. and other journalists have flocked to Pakistan in
recent months to cover the war on terrorism, but it wasn't clear how many
were still there Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The group, which identified itself as the National Movement for the
Restoration of Pakistani Sovereignty, also warned that if Pakistan's
government doesn't ensure the rights of its citizens "in custody the
world over," then other Pakistanis "are ready to take steps." Americans,
it added, "are sitting ducks."</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli Embassy in Washington firmly denied that Pearl had any
link to the Mossad or the Israeli government. "It's total rubbish," said
Mark Regev, spokesman at the embassy.</TE>
<TE>   The Journal said in a statement that Pearl, 38, was born in the United
States, is a U.S. citizen and has never worked for any U.S. agency or
foreign government. He joined the Journal in 1990 and is the paper's
South Asia bureau chief.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a reporter for us--nothing more or less," the Journal said. "He
cannot affect the policy of the U.S. or Pakistani government. Nor can
we."</TE>
<TE>   The paper pleaded for Pearl's immediate release, saying his writing
has "always been respectful of Islam" and the people of Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Others also called for his safe return. In Los Angeles, former
heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali released a statement saying, "It
is my most sincere prayer" that Pearl be allowed to return safely to his
family.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl disappeared Jan. 23 in the violence-plagued port city of
Karachi, in southern Pakistan. Colleagues said he was working on a story
about ties between Pakistani Islamic groups and alleged "shoe bomber"
Richard C. Reid, who has been charged with trying to detonate explosives
aboard a flight last month from Paris to Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl had gone to a Karachi restaurant to meet an intermediary who
apparently had promised to introduce him to members of an extremist
Islamic group. The meeting, however, was part of an elaborate trap, and
Pearl didn't return.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani police have told reporters that the kidnappers used false
identities and hard-to-trace e-mail accounts to hide their tracks.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani police carried out raids in several cities Wednesday in
connection with the investigation, according to the Associated Press.
Among those detained was Sheik Mubarak Ali Shah Gilani, head of a
militant Islamic group. Police said Pearl was seeking to meet Gilani when
he disappeared. A Wall Street Journal spokesman declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials say the photographs of Pearl appear genuine and show no
evidence of computer manipulation. The photos e-mailed Saturday included
one of Pearl holding a Thursday edition of a Karachi newspaper. The new
photos show him in the same clothes, before the same backdrop, and it
isn't clear whether they were taken later than the first photos.</TE>
<TE>   Intelligence and law enforcement agencies in the United States rushed
agents and resources to assist Pakistan in the search. But investigators
in both countries said they had never heard of the group and have yet to
identify its members.</TE>
<TE>   Although some officials speculate that the group is an offshoot of a
larger terrorist organization, others say it may represent a new wing
that has adopted terrorist tactics to pursue a separate, more nationalist
agenda.</TE>
<TE>   The group noted--but did not condemn--Pakistan's role as a U.S. ally
in the war on terror, for example. It aimed its ire instead at the
treatment of Pakistanis arrested or detained in its wake.</TE>
<TE>   But the second message was far more strident than the first. Though
the first e-mail outlined the group's grievances in almost legalistic
fashion, Wednesday's spoke to "brother pakstanis" and appeared more of a
public political message.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the two e-mail messages never refer to Allah, to jihad or
martyrdom, or to any of the potent political and religious issues and
sites that are a staple of extremist Islamic rhetoric, especially among
those tied to the Al Qaeda terror network.</TE>
<TE>   The apparent captors instead demanded that Pakistanis held in U.S.
detention in Cuba be repatriated to Pakistan to stand trial. They also
demanded that lawyers and family visits be provided to Pakistanis held in
U.S. jails as part of the Sept. 11 investigation.</TE>
<TE>   One U.S. official said the group's e-mails made domestic political
demands that have broad appeal to nationalists and intellectuals in
Pakistan. "Nothing has been ruled out, but it doesn't have the earmarks"
of Al Qaeda, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   A former intelligence official familiar with the region agreed. "There
are things that are out of pattern," said the official, who asked not to
be identified. "It doesn't sound like an Al Qaeda group. They seem to be
fairly knowledgeable about lawyers and civil rights."</TE>
<TE>   The Journal's managing editor, Paul Steiger, has tried to make contact
with Pearl's abductors. On Tuesday, he sent them a six-paragraph e-mail
message that sought, in part, to humanize Pearl and his wife, Mariane.</TE>
<TE>   "She is a citizen of France, and also a journalist," Steiger wrote.
"She is also six months pregnant with their first child. I would like you
to know that she is greatly distressed over Danny's situation."</TE>
<TE>   The only reply was the e-mail Wednesday threatening Pearl's execution.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl's wife, who was traveling with him and has remained in Pakistan,
told CNN that she and her husband believe that their job as journalists
is to create dialogue. She appealed to the kidnappers to open a dialogue
with her to help win her husband's release.</TE>

<DH>Media: Reporter's kidnapping in Pakistan highlights an occupational
hazard for correspondents abroad, news executives say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID SHAW</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite threats to American journalists made by the Pakistani
kidnappers of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, executives at
major U.S. news organizations said Wednesday that they have no plans to
pull their reporters or photographers out of the country. Most said,
however, that they have reinforced earlier warnings to their journalists
in the region to exercise extreme caution and to take no unnecessary
risks.</LD>
<LD>   "I just talked with both the people we have there, and I reiterated
what we always say: that no story is worth putting yourself in grave
danger," said Colin McMahon, foreign editor of the Chicago Tribune. "I
know the attraction of going out on a limb for a story . . . but it
doesn't do you any good if you're kidnapped and you can't file the
story."</LD>
<LD>   McMahon said it's difficult to know how large or widespread the
kidnappers' group is and what its actual intent and capabilities are, but
he said its actions so far won't change the newspaper's coverage. Other
editors agreed.</LD>
<TE>   "There are times when it's dangerous to be a journalist, but as
journalists, part of our mission--our calling--is an obligation to report
the good and the bad and the dangerous," said Bob Dubill, executive
editor of USA Today.</TE>
<TE>Reporters in Rotation</TE>
<TE>   Dubill said his paper has three journalists in Pakistan--two of whom
will be returning to the U.S. on scheduled home leaves this week. "They
will be replaced there as the news dictates and as logistics make
possible," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Other news organizations said they also are moving reporters in and
out of Pakistan in accordance with previous plans, although Martin Baron,
editor of the Boston Globe, said, "We have a reporter who's been
scheduled to come out Friday . . . and the reporter who is supposed to
replace her will wait a few days in London to see how things develop."</TE>
<TE>   In an e-mail sent Wednesday to several U.S. news organizations, a
group that had previously identified itself as the National Movement for
the Restoration of Pakistani Sovereignty threatened to execute Pearl
"within 24 hours" if the U.S. did not release all Pakistanis taken into
its custody during the war in Afghanistan. The group accused Pearl of
spying for Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency, and said other U.S.
journalists in Pakistan also are spies.</TE>
<TE>   Any U.S. journalists who do not leave the country within three days
will be "targeted," the e-mail said.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Steiger, managing editor of the Wall Street Journal, has
vigorously denied that Pearl is a spy, and other news executives have
issued similar denials about their journalists. In an e-mail sent to the
kidnapping group Wednesday, Steiger said Pearl is a professional
journalist, with "no ability to change the policies of the U.S.
Government or the Government of Pakistan."</TE>
<TE>Appeals to Kidnappers</TE>
<TE>   Steiger has appeared on CNN and BBC radio and television in recent
days, hoping the kidnappers will see or hear him and agree to his request
that Pearl be freed unharmed.</TE>
<TE>   In light of the threat to Pearl and other journalists, editors at the
Journal and several other news organizations were guarded Wednesday when
talking about the assignment of, or security precautions taken by, their
staff in Pakistan. Associated Press declined to comment, and a spokesman
for the New York Times said, "We don't wish to discuss the specifics of
correspondent whereabouts or movements for obvious security reasons."</TE>
<TE>   But Edward Cody, deputy foreign editor of the Washington Post, said
his paper is about to have "even more people than usual in Pakistan"
because the newspaper's foreign editor is en route to Islamabad for a
weekend meeting with Post reporters in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Butler, a foreign editor for Knight Ridder, said one of his
reporters, Jonathan Landay, had been in Pakistan, pursuing the same story
that Pearl was working on "when we had to pull him out to cover
Afghanistan two weeks ago."</TE>
<TE>   "He's very relieved," Butler said. "He could have gone down the same
path as Pearl."</TE>
<TE>   In response to Wednesday's developments, Butler said he sent a message
to all his correspondents in the area, "restating our standard-issue
advice."</TE>
<TE>   "We told them, as we have from the beginning of this war, to keep
moving around; don't establish a regular routine that makes it easy for
people to track you. Don't go anywhere alone. Take every precaution you
can--and remember that just because some extremists might seem friendly
to the press, that doesn't mean they have the same view of the press that
we do, and it doesn't mean you shouldn't continue to be very careful."</TE>
<TE>   Mary Braswell, deputy foreign editor of the Los Angeles Times, said
she told Times reporters in Pakistan of the kidnappers' threat and asked
them to "make your own decision" about whether they want to leave.</TE>
<TE>   She said she would talk to them again today as events unfold.</TE>
<TE>   CNN spokesman Matthew Furman echoed several news executives, saying:
"Nobody has a better sense of the danger than the reporters on the
ground. Most of our people there are seasoned war correspondents, and we
rely on them to exercise good judgment.</TE>
<TE>   "But we're reminding them to be careful, and we're making sure they
know that if they want to leave, we encourage them to do so."</TE>
<TE>   None of the "dozen or so" CNN staff members in Pakistan has asked to
leave, Furman said.</TE>
<TE>   Eight Western journalists have been killed since the war in
Afghanistan began, and more than a dozen others have been robbed,
arrested, kidnapped or shot at.</TE>
<TE>   More than 700 journalists have died covering wars--66 in World War II,
65 in Vietnam--according to the Freedom Forum, which has erected a
37-foot-high glass and steel monument to them in Freedom Park, adjacent
to the Newseum in Arlington, Va.</TE>
<TE>   The vast majority of these journalists were not singled out as
targets; most were killed because they were in or near combat action or
were accidental victims of violence. But in 1985, during the Lebanese
civil war, reporter Terry Anderson of Associated Press was kidnapped and
held hostage for almost seven years, and in several more recent wars,
journalists have been specifically targeted for death.</TE>
<TE>   Before the collapse of the Taliban in Afghanistan, reports were
widespread that Taliban and Al Qaeda leaders had offered $50,000 to
$100,000 to anyone who killed a journalist.</TE>

<DL>QUETTA, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>Two former top officials from Afghanistan's vanquished Taliban
regime were detained Wednesday near the southwestern Pakistani city of
Quetta, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Nazar Jan Baluch, a senior Quetta police official, said the two men
had been identified as the Taliban's supreme court chief justice, Noor
Mohammed Saqib, and the deputy foreign minister, Abdur Rahman Zahid.</LD>
<LD>   Baluch said the two men had been detained in predawn police raids on
two villages.</LD>
<TE>   But Shoaib Suddle, chief of police in Baluchistan province, of which
Quetta is the capital, said he did not know the whereabouts of the two
men.</TE>
<TE>   "They are not with the police. We don't know if they are with someone
else," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It is possible that the men were handed over to Pakistani intelligence
agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Baluch said the two Taliban officials arrived in the Quetta area some
time ago and had been living with relatives.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the Taliban's top leadership, including the movement's leader,
Mullah Mohammed Omar, has evaded capture.</TE>
<TE>   But a senior Taliban spokesman, Abdul Hai Mutmaen, and the Taliban's
ambassador to Pakistan, Abdul Salam Zaeef, have been captured. Zaeef was
deported from Pakistan to Afghanistan, where he was picked up by U.S.
forces.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan cut ties with the Taliban after Sept. 11 when President
Pervez Musharraf threw his support behind the U.S.-led war on terrorism.
The Taliban were swept from power late last year under relentless U.S.
bombing and a lightning advance by the opposition Northern Alliance.</TE>

<HD>U.S. to Investigate Dispute Over Raid</HD>
<DH>Military: American attack on suspected Al Qaeda compounds killed
some officials loyal to interim Afghan leader, new government says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The American commander of the war in Afghanistan ordered an
investigation into a Jan. 24 raid on two compounds after the new Afghan
government said some of those killed and captured were not enemy fighters
but officials loyal to interim leader Hamid Karzai.</LD>
<LD>   Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
Wednesday that basic facts about the raid--including who shot first--have
yet to be verified. He was unwilling to say whether U.S. forces
misidentified the targeted compounds as hide-outs for Al Qaeda or Taliban
fighters.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. troops killed at least 15 people and took 27 prisoners. One
U.S. soldier was wounded.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think it was any sense on our part that we've done something
wrong," Myers said. Gen. Tommy Franks, head of the U.S. Central Command,
ordered the investigation because "when there are allegations, you've got
to go run them to ground," Myers said.</TE>
<TE>   Myers said it was too early to conclude that the wrong people had been
killed or captured. But he acknowledged that it is difficult in some
cases for the American military to distinguish friend from foe.</TE>
<TE>   "The situation over there can be very, very complex, with allegiances
changing depending on the situation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Appearing with Myers, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said Franks
ordered the investigation after hearing from Afghan officials.</TE>
<TE>   "In their view, there were some people involved in that shooting that
were killed who were not Taliban or Al Qaeda," Rumsfeld said. Thus,
Franks considered it appropriate to open a formal investigation, Rumsfeld
said.</TE>
<TE>   Some Afghans say that Taliban renegades were handing over weapons to
Karzai's government at the site and that some pro-Karzai figures were
killed and others--including a police chief, his deputy and members of a
district council--were among those arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Afghan security sources told the Reuters news agency that the U.S.
forces had been deliberately misled by tribal factions. An anti-Taliban
commander, Abdul Qadoos, was among those killed in the attack in the
Kharz district of Uruzgan province, one of the sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Myers said the affiliations of the 27 captives, who are being
questioned in Kandahar, are not yet clear.</TE>
<TE>   Two other U.S. military officers, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said it appears that at least some of those killed and captured were
neither Al Qaeda nor Taliban members but were Karzai supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld acknowledged that infighting among Afghan factions is
complicating the situation for U.S. forces.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon's description of the raid, its target and the
circumstances has changed. For example:</TE>
<TE>   * U.S. officials initially told reporters that large amounts of
ammunition--not weapons--were stored at the two compounds, about 50 miles
north of Kandahar. But on Wednesday, Rumsfeld contradicted that by saying
"large numbers of weapons" were confiscated by the U.S. raiders.</TE>
<TE>   * In the immediate aftermath of the raid, Myers told a Pentagon news
conference that although U.S. intelligence indicated that Al Qaeda
fighters were occupying the compounds, the raiders found Taliban forces
were there instead. And he said those taken prisoner were primarily
Taliban members.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, however, a spokesman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Rear.
Adm. John D. Stufflebeem, said, "It just wasn't clear whom exactly we
were dealing with." Nonetheless, Stufflebeem said, Franks was "confident
in the intelligence derived as to what this appeared to be"--an enemy
outpost and a legitimate target.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Franks, Rear Adm. Craig Quigley, said Wednesday that
those captives being questioned in Kandahar who turn out not to be Al
Qaeda or Taliban members will be released.</TE>

<HD>Report Cites Blood Bank Deficiencies</HD>
<DH>Health: In the three months after Sept. 11, supplies were discarded
at five times the usual rate, partly explaining the drop in donations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES HEALTH WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After the terrorist attacks, blood banks discarded supplies at
nearly five times the usual rate and gave such mixed messages about the
need for blood that donations since have plummeted, an industry report
says.</LD>
<LD>   In the three months after Sept. 11, a national sample of 25 blood
banks collected 191,000 more units of blood than average, according to
the National Blood Data Resource Center. But at least 111,633--or 58%--of
those units were discarded because they remained unused and were no
longer fresh after 42 days.</LD>
<LD>   Experts say the true amount of waste was far greater, because the
sampled centers account for a third of U.S. blood collections. Also, the
figures do not include blood discarded by hospitals.</LD>
<TE>   The report, penned by a task force of blood centers, is the most
thorough measure to date of blood industry shortcomings after the Sept.
11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to wasted blood, the report cites increased error rates in
donor screening; "donor confusion and disenchantment"; and financial
losses associated with collection.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Shoos Lipton, chief executive of the American Assn. of Blood
Banks, said the consequences could be severe.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're very concerned about is having [donors] look and say, 'You
had plenty of blood and you didn't really need all the blood for the
emergency,' " Lipton said.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the industry's concern has been directed at the American Red
Cross, which supplies 45% of the nation's blood and sought to stockpile
blood collected after Sept. 11 for future needs.</TE>
<TE>   For whatever reason, donors are feeling a lot less generous. Donations
plummeted quickly in the wake of the disaster, and by December, blood
banks were issuing urgent calls for donors to meet seasonal demands.</TE>
<TE>Twice as Many Errors Committed</TE>
<TE>   In many centers, fewer than 8% of the September donors have responded
to telephone calls, reminder cards and other pleas from blood centers for
repeat donations, according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   "For the most part, the blood community was unable to sustain the
momentum created by the Sept. 11 tragedy,' the report said.</TE>
<TE>   The task force also reported that selected centers committed twice as
many errors as usual--in some cases, failing to properly question donors
about their health.</TE>
<TE>   "Although most of these errors did not compromise the safety of the
collected units, any increase in error rates is cause for concern," said
the report, to be presented today to a blood advisory committee to the
Department of Health and Human Services.</TE>
<TE>Several Layers of Safety Mechanisms</TE>
<TE>   Blood banks have several layers of safety mechanisms--including
laboratory tests of all collected blood--to ensure tainted products are
not used in transfusions.</TE>
<TE>   The blood banks' response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks exposed
deep divisions in the industry, which has often split on strategic and
safety issues, and resulted in mixed messages to donors. The Red Cross
called on donors to continually give blood while other centers asked them
to hold off.</TE>
<TE>   Three days after the attacks, federal health officials convened a
meeting of blood industry leaders, hoping to issue a joint statement
encouraging donors to wait several weeks before giving. But because of
opposition from the Red Cross, no statement was issued.</TE>
<TE>   Red Cross officials say they were concerned at the time about the
possibility of other terrorist events in the ensuing days and weeks. They
also froze some blood for use in future shortages.</TE>
<TE>   Criticism about the discarded units is 20-20 hindsight, said Alan
Ross, the Red Cross' vice president of technical operations.</TE>
<TE>   "In times of uncertainty, I think being prepared is much better than
not having any blood on the shelf," Ross said. "We need to be prepared at
all times in having adequate amounts of blood on the shelf.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now [the federal government] is stockpiling Cipro and vaccines
as part of its disaster preparedness," he added. "We need to do the same
thing with blood."</TE>
<TE>   Officials at America's Blood Centers say they had to discard few units
because their centers turned away excess donors early on. The group is a
consortium of independent blood centers that gather 45% of the nation's
blood supply.</TE>
<TE>   "We have such a great communication with all of our members," said
Lisa Marie Brody, the group's director of government relations. "Perhaps
that communication was not there with the Red Cross national office
because they take care of a lot of things, including blood. Our members
are trained and have expertise in assessing and determining medical
need."</TE>
<TE>   The task force cited two lessons learned from the disaster response:
Don't collect more blood than can be used and ensure that all blood
centers have adequate supplies on hand to respond to disasters at any
time.</TE>
<TE>Hints to Achieve a Better Response</TE>
<TE>   To better respond in an emergency, the group recommended better
coordination between different industry players and common messages to
donors.</TE>
<TE>   Among the task force's recommendations:</TE>
<TE>   * The blood center located closest to the disaster should determine
the medical need for blood and should not accept more blood than it can
possibly use.</TE>
<TE>   * The industry should develop messages to inform the media and the
public that "most disasters do not generate a need for massive amounts of
blood."</TE>
<TE>   * The industry should establish ways to transport blood if disasters
create disruptions to air traffic or other modes of transportation, as
occurred around Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   While criticizing the blood industry's reaction to the terrorist
attacks, the task force also said blood centers, as a whole, must do more
to collect blood every day to ensure that adequate supplies exist if a
disaster occurs.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The state's Legislature became the first in the nation to vote to
repeal term limits for all state and local lawmakers, with Republicans
leading the charge to undo a measure they championed during the GOP's
resurgence in 1994.</LD>
<LD>   In Boise, Gov. Dirk Kempthorne has promised to veto the measure, but
the 27-8 Senate vote Wednesday and last week's 50-20 vote in the House
showed there is enough support to override a veto.</LD>
<LD>   The Idaho Republican Party once endorsed term limits as a way to end
the careers of liberal members of Congress. But the state GOP made the
repeal part of its platform two years ago.</LD>
<TE>   Currently, 18 states limit the terms of state lawmakers.</TE>

<HD>Olympian Effort to Handle Homeless</HD>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>Construction worker Michael Fletcher arrived here from Idaho with
hopes of finding work in the Olympic economy but instead is standing in a
soup kitchen line.</LD>
<LD>   Fletcher is among the city's new homeless, a population that is
expected to increase by 20% during next month's Winter Games. Some, such
as Fletcher, came searching for Olympic employment. Others have lost
their jobs, victims of the recession and terrorism's toll on the tourist
economy. Still others were evicted from their motels and apartments by
landlords who are bumping up rents to profit from the Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   The homeless huddling in the cold for food and shelter present an
image an Olympic city might strive to cloak. Salt Lake City is putting on
its finest civic face--erecting fanciful public art and hanging huge
banners from the sides of buildings depicting athletes in competition.
Downtown especially glistens at night when trees decorated with white
lights shimmer against the fresh snow.</LD>
<TE>   Yet as the city prepares to take the world spotlight Feb. 8, it is
proving as hospitable to the down-and-out as it is to the moneyed.</TE>
<TE>   Fletcher is receiving shelter and food in a complex of homeless
service providers fully visible to tourists visiting downtown's newest
upscale shopping complex. He received a voucher for a new pair of work
boots and was given a bus pass so he could look for a job.</TE>
<TE>   The city has gathered hundreds of volunteers to help the homeless and
last week opened a new emergency homeless shelter--not in some distant
suburb but just a few blocks from where the figure skaters and ice
dancers will compete.</TE>
<TE>   It's the first time, officials say, that an Olympic host city has
added an emergency shelter--with 450 beds--to accommodate the expected
overflow of homeless people.</TE>
<TE>   The opening of the shelter--financed with city, county and state
funds--stands in contrast to Atlanta, where in advance of the 1996 Summer
Olympics, police arrested 10,000 homeless people. Homeless advocates
complained that the tactics were intended to scare the homeless away or
cajole them to lay low during the Games. Officials there also offered
free one-way bus tickets under a clean-the-streets program
euphemistically called, "Project Homeward Bound."</TE>
<TE>   Salt Lake City instead is putting out the welcome mat. "We respect the
human and civil rights of everyone, including the homeless, during these
Olympics," said Mayor Rocky Anderson, a former attorney for the American
Civil Liberties Union. "We won't be doing roundups or anything like that.
This community is very caring toward the homeless."</TE>
<TE>   The ACLU said it has received no complaints of mistreatment from
homeless people.</TE>
<TE>   The city and the surrounding county have a long, established history
of caring for the homeless. A coalition of 40 public, private, church and
charitable organizations tend to an estimated 2,500 homeless people who
live here.</TE>
<TE>   It's now bracing for as many as 500 more, said Sheila Walsh-McDonald,
chairwoman of the Salt Lake County Homeless Coordinating Council.</TE>
<TE>   "We think we're going to be the first Olympics city to be prepared to
handle the homeless," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Salt Lake City is hardly a target for the migrating homeless, given
its cold winters and Utah's tightfisted welfare system. Its homeless
population is relatively small, in part because the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints, whose members make up 70% of Utah's
population, admonishes its followers to be responsible for themselves
and, if they run into financial crises, to turn first to family before
seeking church or civil assistance.</TE>
<TE>   But not everyone has family to turn to. Robert Aldrich, 45, lost his
job in October as a food and beverage director at an upscale hotel in
Park City, 30 miles southeast of here. Business there plummeted after the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on New York City and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   With no paycheck and dwindling savings, he moved from a mountain
rental condominium to a Salt Lake City house he shared with two other
men. He got a part-time telephone job for $8 an hour. Unable to make his
rent, he now sleeps in his car.</TE>
<TE>   "This town is a piece of cake to be homeless in," he said while
waiting for lunch at the St. Vincent de Paul center, known locally as St.
Vinny's. "We're almost coddled. I'm getting three meals a day, and I
could get six if I wanted. There aren't any skinny homeless people in
Salt Lake."</TE>
<TE>   Lynette Phillipsen's take on Salt Lake City was less sunny.
Phillipsen, 50, arrived in town 10 days ago from Arizona with $11 in her
purse. She ended up at the Road Home, the city's largest homeless
shelter. "I think it's cruel, the way the homeless are treated here," she
said. "The shelters don't have kitchen facilities, and to eat you're
treated like cattle--coming in two at a time."</TE>
<TE>   Fletcher, 53, came here hoping for an $18-an-hour job hanging drywall.
Instead, he'll earn $8 an hour attending an Olympic park-and-ride
facility, not enough to pay for an apartment. After the Olympics, he
said, he'll probably take his job hunt to Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Hamilton, who chairs the Humanitarian Services Committee of the
Salt Lake Organizing Committee, said untold numbers of construction
workers have flocked here because of construction slowdowns elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "I talked to eight carpenters who showed up here from Las Vegas
assuming there'd be jobs here," she said. "They told me more were headed
this way."</TE>
<TE>   The city is most sympathetic to those who have lost affordable housing
because their landlords evicted them to rent rooms to visitors at higher
rates during the Games.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody should be profiting during the Olympics at the expense of
persons needing affordable housing," Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   At Zion's Motel, along the street that leads directly to the state
Capitol, owner John Purdue evicted the tenants of his two dozen units on
Jan. 15--including those who were paying $220 a week--and raised the
rates to $105 a night.</TE>
<TE>   "We're anticipating being very busy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Of the people he evicted, Purdue said: "We're a for-profit business.
We're not a charity. . . . We're sympathetic [toward the homeless], but
this is a supply-and-demand world."</TE>
<TE>   Homeless advocates say they've heard of similar evictions at
low-income apartments--and are helpless to stop it. Utah law allows
landlords to evict month-to-month tenants without cause with just a
15-day notice. "Salt Lake City has the fastest evictions in the West,"
said Marty Blaustein, a housing attorney for Utah Legal Services. "And
residents who live in some awful conditions are being evicted so the
owners can rent those units sight-unseen for $250 to people coming here
from out of state."</TE>
<TE>   Although the Olympics can be partly blamed for increasing the number
of homeless, the Games also are helping to feed them. Hilton's
humanitarian committee arranged for Olympic food vendors--who provide box
lunches to athletes, volunteers and others on the slopes and in the
arenas--to return unopened ones daily for distribution to the city's soup
kitchens.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the increased need for volunteers, the federal government
dispatched 250 of its AmeriCorps volunteers to help.</TE>
<TE>   As men and women enter the new emergency shelter, the volunteers fill
out admission forms and politely but firmly check bags for weapons, drugs
and alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   Once admitted, the homeless walk across the concrete floor and claim a
cot, laid out in sharp, straight rows in the middle of the cavernous
room. At dinner, they walk to the Salvation Army hall, which serves as
many as 500 meals nightly and is gearing up to serve 1,000 during the
Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "We anticipate a lot more people who need assistance will be coming to
town during the Games," said Wayne Froderberg, a major with the Salvation
Army. "We have a compassionate network of providers. We want to be good
hosts to all who come here."</TE>

<HD>Tough Economic Times Ahead, N.Y. Mayor Says</HD>
<DH>Reforms: Bloomberg, in his first state of the city speech, details
steps to curb spending to close the projected $4-billion budget
shortfalls.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>In his first state of the city speech, New York Mayor Michael R.
Bloomberg on Wednesday praised the Big Apple's recovery and spiritual
resiliency after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, but he warned that
residents will be facing tough economic cutbacks in the days ahead.</LD>
<LD>   Noting that the city must close an estimated $4-billion budget gap in
each of the next three years, the mayor outlined steps to shrink spending
and promote reforms. Yet he conceded that several of his plans--including
bringing public schools under mayoral control and reducing the money New
York pays to settle lawsuits--must be approved by state legislators.</LD>
<LD>   "In many cases it will be necessary to postpone plans and delay
dreams," Bloomberg said, making a pointed reference to some of former
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's pet projects--including new baseball stadiums
and an expensive refurbishing of Lincoln Center. "But we have no choice.
We cannot raise taxes at this time, and the law requires us to live
within our means."</LD>
<TE>   During a 40-minute speech before City Council members, the Republican
mayor pledged to run an open administration that reaches out to New
York's diverse communities. He vowed to lobby Democratic and Republican
party officials to bring their 2004 presidential conventions to New York,
and said he also would push hard to lure the 2012 Summer Olympics to the
city.</TE>
<TE>   Calling for more development along the city's 500 miles of waterfront,
Bloomberg backed construction of a bike and jogging path around the
entirety of Manhattan; he also said New York should expand the number of
daily commuter ferries into Manhattan from New Jersey, Staten Island and
Brooklyn--noting that they have become popular with former bus and subway
riders after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Most of his remarks, however, focused on why the city would have to
pursue a less expansionist agenda in the next four years. He repeated a
call made in his Jan. 1 inaugural address for all city departments to
voluntarily reduce staffing by 20%, something he already has done in the
mayor's office.</TE>
<TE>   "New York's municipal work force is one-seventh the size of the whole
federal government, if you don't count the military," Bloomberg noted.
"But our people serve 8 million citizens, and they serve 250 million. . .
. We just don't have the money to continue this level of staffing."</TE>
<TE>   (According to the 2001-02 city fact book, New York has 255,443
full-time employees. By comparison, the city of Los Angeles employs
34,433 people.)</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg, who amassed a $4-billion fortune in his business media
information company, vowed to root out waste and inefficiencies in all
city departments. A key example, he said, is the more than $500 million
New York City spends annually to settle lawsuits. But cutting those
costs, he noted, would require major tort law reform to be passed by
state legislators.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor got an ovation when he repeated his demand that the Board of
Education be abolished, giving him control over public schools. He said
the board "doesn't work for parents, for students, for teachers or even
its members," and he urged politicians in the state capital of Albany to
give him such control.</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic-controlled Assembly, however--led by New York Speaker
Sheldon Silver--long has refused to approve this change. And few
observers expect Bloomberg to push through such dramatic reform any time
soon.</TE>
<TE>   Despite all the barriers, Bloomberg voiced confidence in the city's
ability to bounce back from the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been attacked, we have been tested and now we are on the path
to renewal and recovery," the mayor said. "New York is strong. And New
York is open for business."</TE>

<HD>Bush Sees Tax Credits as Way to Insure Poor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICKI KEMPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration unveiled a plan Wednesday that relies
largely on tax credits to help low-income Americans buy health insurance.
The proposal set the stage for another partisan battle on Capitol Hill
and renewed doubts that the growing number of Americans without health
care would get any government help this year.</LD>
<LD>   In his budget proposal for fiscal year 2003, which he will submit
Monday to Congress, President Bush will ask for $89 billion over 10 years
to help individuals and families buy private health insurance. Currently,
about 39 million Americans have no health insurance, and the recession
and spiraling health costs threaten to push the numbers even higher.</LD>
<LD>   Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson, speaking at a
community health center in a transitional neighborhood about two miles
from the White House, said the tax credit--as much as $3,000 for a family
with two or more children with a household income of less than
$25,000--would bring health insurance to 6 million people over 10 years.</LD>
<TE>   Conservatives say tax credits support the existing system of private
insurance and allow consumers to choose their own health care plans, all
without establishing new government bureaucracies.</TE>
<TE>   But congressional Democrats and consumer advocates, citing private
studies that indicate that the average group policy for a family of four
costs more than $7,000, said the proposed credits would be far too small
to help people most in need. And by encouraging a movement away from
employer-based insurance to an individual market, the critics said, tax
credits ultimately could make health insurance more expensive and harder
to get for everyone.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Pete Stark of Hayward, the top Democrat on the House Ways and
Means health subcommittee, called the tax credit proposal "a terribly
naive and poorly crafted idea. What they're doing is so marginal as to be
next to useless."</TE>
<TE>   Ron Pollack, executive director of the consumer group Families USA,
likened the proposal to "giving a person a 10-foot rope to get out of a
40-foot hole."</TE>
<TE>   Such deep disagreement about tax credits is not new in Washington. The
conflict over how to best help laid-off workers keep health
coverage--with credits or subsidies--in large part was responsible for
stalling the president's economic stimulus package in December.</TE>
<TE>   And tax credits for the uninsured is just one of several divisive
health care issues on the political agenda this year. A patients' bill of
rights is bogged down over House-Senate differences in the amount of
damages a patient could win from an HMO that had denied needed medical
care. And the administration and lawmakers of both parties are proposing
different ways to help senior citizens afford prescription drugs.</TE>
<TE>   But even critics of the administration had kind words for other
initiatives Thompson announced Wednesday. They include:</TE>
<TE>   * $114 million in new funds for community health centers, an 8%
increase over last year.</TE>
<TE>   * $3.2 billion for state programs for uninsured children, money that
went unused after being set aside for other purposes, and that would
otherwise be returned to the federal Treasury.</TE>
<TE>   * $350 million in Medicaid services for families moving from welfare
to work.</TE>
<TE>   * A $44-million increase in funds to encourage health-care
professionals to work in inner cities and rural areas.</TE>
<TE>   * Fewer restrictions on medical savings accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Some even praised the size of the tax-credit proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "It's putting $89 billion on the table for expanded access in a time
of tight budgets" Pollack said. "An increase in the level of their
commitment [last year's proposal was about $72 billion] is good news."</TE>
<TE>   But overall, the "disproportionate focus" on tax credits is
disappointing, Pollack said.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson, defending the plan, said another initiative, which would
make it easier for states to custom-design their health-care programs for
the poor, would help 1.8 million people get health insurance and expand
health benefits for 3.5 million more people.</TE>
<TE>   "We're using all of these programs to attack the problem" of the
uninsured, Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   The health insurance industry praised the plan, which would also
provide a credit of as much as $1,000 for individuals who earn up to
$15,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Don Young, president of the Health Insurance Assn. of America,
said the uninsured could use the credits to buy good, basic health
insurance policies. Such policies are available for as little as $800 to
$1,200 for individuals, he said, and from $3,000 to $6,000 for families.</TE>
<TE>   "We are delighted that the president has moved forward with this
approach," Young said. "The strength of the president's proposal is that
it lets people look around for the best deal and be good shoppers."</TE>
<TE>   An aide to a Democratic House member, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, strongly disagreed. "There's an extreme degree of skepticism
that these programs help anyone but insurers," he said. The biggest
problem with tax credits, he said, "is that it's a way to get government
out of health care, get employers out of health care."</TE>
<TE>   No one, however, called the administration's plan a nonstarter. "There
is a vast difference of opinion between the two parties on how it should
be done," Stark said. "But I would be happy to work with [Thompson] to
expand on the idea."</TE>

<HD>Bush Pushes His Volunteerism Plan</HD>
<DH>Policy: President seeks backing for his Freedom Corps, aimed at
helping to spur a communal spirit in the terror fight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.
</DL>
<LD>President Bush, on a trip to friendly Southern territory,
campaigned Wednesday to build support for the USA Freedom Corps he has
created to foster the communal spirit sparked among many Americans after
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The president and his aides put flesh on the $560-million volunteerism
program he outlined in his State of the Union address Tuesday night,
unveiling its Web site and a toll-free telephone number to help spur what
he hopes will evolve into a vastly expanded U.S. commitment to voluntary
action.</LD>
<LD>   "History has called us to action, and action we will take," Bush said,
speaking to about 6,000 people, many of whom lined up before noon to
attend the mid-afternoon appearance at a local arena.</LD>
<TE>   The White House has presented the volunteerism proposal as a key part
of Bush's domestic agenda this year, one that appears less controversial
than his faith-based initiative, which seeks to meld the charitable works
of religious groups with the social welfare role of government. That
initiative has stalled in Congress amid questions about government
funding of religious groups.</TE>
<TE>   The Freedom Corps reflects the administration's effort to answer the
question, "What can I do?" that public officials have heard often in
response to Bush's call for the country to come together to fight
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "If people want to fight terror, do something kind for a neighbor.
Join the USA Freedom Corps," Bush said. "We will show the world that
values, universal values, must be respected, and must be adhered to. And
as a result, the world will be more peaceful."</TE>
<TE>   The program, created by Bush's signature Tuesday on an executive order
but dependent on funding by Congress to take root, would have multiple
roles. It would give citizens a more direct role in domestic security
through a new group known as the Citizen Corps; expand the AmeriCorps and
Senior Corps started by President Clinton; and double the size of the
Peace Corps, which sends American aid workers overseas.</TE>
<TE>   The Citizen Corps would include:</TE>
<TE>   * Retired doctors and other health care professionals who would be
asked to augment local medical personnel in an emergency;</TE>
<TE>   * A corps of transportation workers, truckers, letter carriers, train
conductors and others who would be asked to report suspicious activity to
a hotline;</TE>
<TE>   * An expanded Neighborhood Watch program that would grow beyond its
original role to include unspecified missions to prevent terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's father sought to encourage voluntarism as president,
establishing a "Points of Light" office in the White House that honored
the work of volunteer groups and individuals. The younger Bush's program
is more ambitious--and costly--in nature.</TE>
<TE>   The president said that while the United States can "fight evil" with
its military, "at home you fight evil with acts of goodness. You overcome
the evil in society by doing something to help somebody."</TE>
<TE>   Bush urged his listeners to call up http://www.usafreedomcorps.gov,
the Web site established for the program.</TE>
<TE>   "Or you can call this number--it sounds like I'm making a pitch, and I
am," he said, drawing laughter. "1-877-USACorps. If somebody out there is
interested in figuring out how to serve, it's 1-877-USACorps."</TE>
<TE>   In his State of the Union speech, Bush called on all Americans to
spend 4,000 hours over the course of their lives performing volunteer
work--a cumulative total of two years.</TE>
<TE>   John Bridgeland, the presidential assistant who will head the
eight-person USA Freedom Corps office in the White House, said surveys
found such specific calls to volunteer action produced a marked response,
more than doubling participation.</TE>
<TE>   Suggesting a high level of presidential interest, Bush plans to chair
the council overseeing the program.</TE>
<TE>   Under Bush's plan, the number of volunteers in the Peace Corps,
created by President Kennedy in 1961, would double to 15,000, equal to
its peak number in 1966. The program would expand its "crisis corps"
teams to serve in Afghanistan and would seek to increase its work in
Islamic nations.</TE>
<TE>   AmeriCorps, whose participants serve U.S. rural and urban communities
by teaching, helping build homes and performing other tasks, would see a
50% increase in its numbers, growing to 25,000. The administration hopes
AmeriCorps participants, in turn, will attract an additional 75,000 local
volunteers to their efforts.</TE>
<TE>   The Senior Corps, in which volunteers age 55 and older provide
community service, would expand by 100,000.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's trip concludes today with events in Daytona Beach, Fla., and
Atlanta. It is intended to give him a continued political bounce from the
State of the Union speech, presenting him among cheering supporters and,
during his stop in Winston-Salem, on a stage filled with uniformed police
officers, firefighters and emergency medical personnel.</TE>
<TE>   Reiterating a point he made in his State of the Union speech, he said:
"Corporate America must be open about its books and accounting systems,
so that shareholders and employees know the full truth about what's going
on, on balance sheets."</TE>

<LD>President Bush's State of the Union address Tuesday was watched by
an estimated 51.8 million viewers, representing the annual speech's
largest audience in four years.</LD>
<LD>   Tune-in ratings on eight broadcast and cable networks surged 30%
compared with last year's address, based on data from Nielsen Media
Research.</LD>
<LD>   No address has approached that level since 1998, when more than 53
million people were estimated to have viewed President Clinton's speech,

<HD>Protesters Primed for Economic Forum in N.Y.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Behind a blue door marked International Action Center in a small
Manhattan office building sandwiched between two shops, protesters
practiced shouting for the benefit of television cameras: "Money for jobs
and not for war!"</LD>
<LD>   They put the finishing touches on stacks of yellow signs with black
lettering for such causes as "End U.S. Aid to Israel" and "U.S. Out of
Afghanistan."</LD>
<LD>   Amalgams of like-minded activists--Vietnam War protest veterans,
anti-globalization demonstrators, college students and labor union
members--are expected to take to the streets of New York to oppose the
World Economic Forum, which opens today.</LD>
<TE>   The forum, which was held in the Swiss ski resort of Davos for more
than three decades, moved its meeting to New York to show support for the
city after the attack on the World Trade Center. Some officials in Davos
also had complained about the growing cost of protecting the conference,
which had become a magnet for anti-globalization demonstrations.</TE>
<TE>   This year will be no exception. The International Action Center, a
major group coordinating the protest, has been granted a police permit
for a major demonstration Saturday on Park Avenue outside the
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, where 3,000 forum delegates--including corporate
leaders and heads of state--will meet.</TE>
<TE>   About 4,000 police officers have been assigned to guard the
conference, along with agents from the FBI, the State Department and the
Secret Service.</TE>
<TE>   Strategists at the action center, which was founded to oppose the
Persian Gulf War, view the Davos conference not only as a symbol to test
the strength of the protest movement after Sept. 11, but also as a chance
to recruit members for a larger demonstration planned in the nation's
capital this spring.</TE>
<TE>   "They want to shut our movement down. This is a test for us," the
action center's co-director Larry Holmes told activists preparing signs
for street protests. "We have to show the movement is not dead. It is
alive. It is militant and defiant."</TE>
<TE>   Just how militant is a touchy question. Holmes and other strategists
at the action center are aware that violent clashes with police could
hurt the movement's recruiting base and drive away civil rights
organizations, labor unions and other groups necessary for growth.</TE>
<TE>   "There are the young people who will come if they can get here. They
will crawl on the ground to make it. Then there are the people from my
generation who want to fight the good fight. They want to come out to the
demonstration," Holmes said.</TE>
<TE>   As she put tape on a sign this week, Nina Hawe, 50, a nurse,
reminisced about her first demonstration.</TE>
<TE>   "I was 16 at the time. It was against the war in Vietnam. It started
off with a rally and then we marched down Fifth Avenue. It think it was
1967 or 1968. Oh, I loved it. It was just great. It was good to be around
so many people."</TE>
<TE>   The veteran activist said she plans to protest for several reasons.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like we're in a phase now or we're going into a phase of a
lot of negativity and destruction and violence. I wouldn't say I am
totally a pacifist, but what's the purpose? Violence just to dominate and
control and manipulate other people is so unnecessary. So I guess the
purpose of this demonstration is to try to say there is another way and
people can live together in peace."</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, Emily Tarasuk, 20, a student at the Fashion Institute of
Technology in Manhattan, said it would be her first demonstration.</TE>
<TE>   She said a friend who is active in the movement gave her literature
and persuaded her to march. "I didn't know these problems existed, and I
just want to learn," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Tarasuk said her parents were anti-Vietnam War demonstrators, but
never talked to her about their experience.</TE>
<TE>   Michelle Quintus, 32, a flight attendant, said one of the reasons she
planned to demonstrate was growing unemployment after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "Thousands of flight attendants and others in the aviation industry
have lost their jobs. But our CEOs and our owners are walking away with
millions of dollars," she said. "None of their salaries are getting cut.
They are asking for pay concessions. But it is us that are risking our
lives every time we get on an airplane so that they can make money."</TE>

<KH>THE FALL OF ENRON</KH>
<HD>Firm Accused of Withholding Data</HD>
<DH>Probe: Senate panel chairman says the company has not produced some
requested documents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Already under fire for shredding documents, Enron Corp. is now
facing accusations that it failed to turn over records to congressional
investigators looking into the company's collapse.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.), who chairs a subcommittee that will
hear from former Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay next week, is not
satisfied that Enron released all the records that investigators are
seeking, a source close to the probe said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The records relate to the controversial off-the-books partnerships
that masked the company's financial problems. Among other things, the
Senate Commerce Committee's subcommittee on consumer affairs is seeking a
list of investors in those partnerships.</LD>
<TE>   The partnerships are a key focus of investigators piecing together the
causes of Enron's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing on Dec. 2, less than a
month after it announced previously unreported losses of $586 million
over nearly five years.</TE>
<TE>   Dorgan was unavailable for comment Wednesday, and an Enron attorney
did not return a call for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Senate investigators are pushing Enron to turn over the partnership
documents before Monday's hearing with Lay, who is appearing voluntarily
and without a grant of immunity.</TE>
<TE>   Lay is likely to be grilled about why Enron failed so abruptly,
costing investors and employees billions of dollars in stock and
retirement fund losses. He resigned as chairman and chief executive Jan.
23.</TE>
<TE>   At least one congressional committee appears satisfied that Enron has
provided all requested documents.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. James C. Greenwood (R-Pa.), who chairs a House Energy and
Commerce subcommittee, said his investigators have not been stymied by
Enron's resistance to turning over documents.</TE>
<TE>   But Greenwood lambasted Enron's continued shredding of internal
documents until earlier this month, even after the company was aware of
numerous government investigations.</TE>
<TE>   "What they have shredded is their credibility," Greenwood said. "It's
outrageous that while Enron was the subject of investigations by the
Justice Department, the SEC and multiple committees of Congress, it would
get anywhere near a shredder. They shouldn't shred so much as an old
newspaper without carefully clearing it with investigators."</TE>
<TE>   In Houston, an Enron spokeswoman declined to say whether the firm had
ceased all document destruction.</TE>
<TE>   "We have and will continue to comply with requests for information,"
said spokeswoman Karen Denne. "We asked the Department of Justice to come
in and investigate, and the FBI is currently conducting an
investigation."</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Cooper, the bankruptcy consultant selected this week as
Enron's interim chief executive, said a special committee of the energy
giant's board should complete an internal investigation in less than a
week.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper participated in a conference call with reporters Wednesday
along with former Chief Financial Officer Jeff McMahon, who was promoted
this week to president. McMahon was one of several executives who
complained about the firm's off-the-books partnerships, according to a
memo written by Enron Vice President Sherron S. Watkins.</TE>
<TE>   McMahon declined to answer questions about his complaints, and Cooper
said he was not focused on the causes of Enron's fall.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not gonna spend my time here looking in the rearview mirror," he
said. "The fact of the matter is, there are a lot of people here who
deserve our best shot at reorganizing this company, and the only way
that's going to happen is if we look forward," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts say the remains of Enron are likely to be sold off in
pieces in order to pay creditors. Cooper said that although Enron has
sold its biggest revenue-generating divisions, the small pipelines and
other remaining assets are "very manageable, very steady businesses" that
may propel the firm enough so it can emerge from bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   aid the firm had about $10 billion in secured debt (debt guaranteed by
the pledge of assets) and $30 billion in unsecured debt.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, congressional investigators indicated they would ask
Enron officials for more information about a warning made in August to
Lay and the company's board of directors about Enron's accounting
irregularities.</TE>
<TE>   Margaret Ceconi, a former sales director at Enron Energy Services,
alleged in an Aug. 29 e-mail that her division had hidden losses of more
than $500 million. House Energy and Commerce Committee leaders wrote to
Lay, asking, "What happened to Ms. Ceconi's e-mail after you received it
and how has Enron responded to it?"</TE>

<HD>GAO Chief Puts Agency in the Limelight</HD>
<DH>Politics: Though he has a history with GOP, David Walker has proved
to be nonpartisan--he is suing the White House over energy policy
meetings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>While some here question the motives of congressional committees
investigating the Enron Corp. collapse, it is harder to attack the man
who has decided to sue the Bush administration to get information about
its energy policy task force.</LD>
<LD>   David M. Walker, head of the General Accounting Office, has a solid
Republican background and leads a nonpartisan congressional agency known
for tough, independent scrutiny of the executive branch.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, before Walker was named in 1998 by President Clinton to the
post of U.S. comptroller general, his resume included stints in the
Reagan and Bush administrations. Congressional Republicans were among the
strongest champions of his bid to become the government's top auditor.</LD>
<TE>   "He was the choice of the Republican leadership for this position,"
said Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), chairman of the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Lieberman said, "there was some concern on the Democratic
side about whether he'd be as nonpartisan as this office calls for, and I
think he's dispelled any doubts about that."</TE>
<TE>Lawsuit a First for the Agency</TE>
<TE>   Walker's announcement Wednesday--that he would sue the White House to
obtain records from a task force led by Vice President Dick Cheney to
design the administration's energy policy--was a singular moment for a
previously little-known public official and for the agency he heads.</TE>
<TE>   Though the GAO over the years has developed a reputation as a tough
investigator, never since the agency's founding in 1921 has it sued the
executive branch for access to records.</TE>
<TE>   The brewing legal clash has prompted the White House and many of its
GOP allies in Congress to launch fierce attacks on Walker's request for
information. Cheney, explaining his refusal to answer the GAO chief,
insisted Sunday that giving in would set a bad precedent for future
administrations seeking candid advice.</TE>
<TE>   The Enron scandal has put the task force under fresh scrutiny as
congressional investigators have sought to determine how much influence
the now-bankrupt energy company and other special interests have had with
the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   Walker has been unyielding in his insistence that the GAO, Congress
and the public have a right to know what individuals or groups met with
the vice president's task force, when they met and what they talked
about. Walker, in an interview, said he did not relish challenging the
White House, "but it's something I need to do to do my job in an
objective and nonpartisan fashion."</TE>
<TE>   A native of Alabama, Walker, 50, describes himself as a onetime
conservative Democrat, then a moderate Republican and now, in his new
job, a political independent. Among his heroes, he names Presidents
Theodore Roosevelt and Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   Before taking the GAO post, Walker, a certified public accountant, was
a partner in Atlanta and in Washington for the accounting firm Arthur
Andersen--perhaps best known today as Enron's former auditor. At
Andersen, he specialized in human resources issues.</TE>
<TE>15-Year Term Gives Post Independence</TE>
<TE>   In the mid- to late 1980s, Walker worked for the federal government as
a mid-level Labor Department official and as acting executive director
for the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. He also served as a public trustee
of Social Security and Medicare from 1990 to 1995.</TE>
<TE>   When the comptroller general position came open in 1996 with the
retirement of Charles Bowsher, Walker surfaced as the leading candidate
in a search led by a bipartisan panel of lawmakers. As Democrats
recalled, the panel was supposed to offer Clinton a pool of candidates.</TE>
<TE>   But Lieberman and Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) said that Sen.
Trent Lott (R-Miss.), then the Senate majority leader, insisted on making
Walker the top recommendation. Clinton ultimately agreed, and the Senate
unanimously confirmed Walker's nomination in October 1998. The position
has a 15-year term, giving Walker an extraordinary degree of
independence. He makes $150,000 a year, the same as a member of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Lott was out of town Wednesday on a Republican Party retreat and could
not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Republican congressional aides said Walker still has the confidence of
key lawmakers, including Rep. Dan Burton (R-Ind.), chairman of the House
Government Reform Committee, and Sen. Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.), ranking
member on the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.</TE>
<TE>   It is hard to gauge how much support Walker has in Congress for his
legal battle. "Needless to say, I've got 535 clients--100 senators and
435 House members," Walker said. "Obviously there are a number of those
that strongly support us, some that have mixed emotions and some that
don't like what we're doing."</TE>
<TE>   But lawmakers have given the GAO a vote of confidence--in its budget.
Last year the agency was given a major funding increase, to $421 million
annually, up from $384 million the previous year. Walker heads a staff of
nearly 3,300 employees.</TE>
<TE>   Walker is not shy about touting his agency's achievements--for
example, he has testified before a congressional committee that the GAO
saved taxpayers $23 billion in 2000 by rooting out fraud and abuse in
government programs. Among the agency's targets in recent years: the
Medicare system, the Defense Department's F-22 fighter acquisition
program, the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Housing and
Urban Development.</TE>
<TE>   "We are the nation's--and possibly the world's--leading accountability
organization," Walker told Congress.</TE>

<LD>Hamilton College--A Jan. 27 Southern California Living story about
judging others mistakenly reported that one-fifth of students in
professor Robert Simon's classes at Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y.,
were unwilling to morally condemn the Holocaust. Although about a fifth
of Simon's students professed to be "nonjudgmental," only a small
fraction of them said they would not condemn the Holocaust.</LD>
