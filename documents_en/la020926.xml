<HD>Collision of Wills in San Francisco</HD>
<DH>Drivers and anti-car activists brace for an anniversary
showdown</DH>

<AU>SHAWN HUBLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Cars get no love at this end of California. Take this month: First
the toll for crossing the Golden Gate Bridge was nearly doubled, to
$5. Then an anti-car Web site had to beg sympathizers to stop gluing
"I Kill Children" fliers onto bumpers in the East Bay. Then, as part
of its Sept. 11 moment of silence, San Francisco mandated a
four-minute blackout of green traffic lights.</LD>
<LD>   And more dings and arrows are coming down the pike this week. On
Friday, radical bicyclists will convene here to celebrate a decade of
wheeled uprisings on these city streets.</LD>
<LD>   It's the 10th birthday party of Critical Mass, the in-your-face
bike movement whose last-Friday-of-the-month mass rides have spread
from the Bay Area to displace and hassle motorists worldwide.
Thousands of cyclists are expected to gather downtown for the
anniversary swarm into afternoon rush-hour traffic.</LD>
<TE>   "Everybody is pretty excited and looking forward to a fun
celebration," said Chris Carlsson, a 45-year-old San Francisco
graphic artist and Critical Mass co-founder. "Although I don't know
how enthused the city is going to be."</TE>
<TE>   Neither does the city, as it turns out. On one hand,
demonstrations are a way of life here. On the other, Critical Mass
has a history of complicating the city's famously delicate traffic
situation; the movement's leaderless, grass-roots structure verges on
anarchy, and routes are withheld until the last minute. Even the
least eventful rides swamp evening commutes with a surging sea of
small Lycra shorts and big plastic helmets and shring-shringing bike
bells.</TE>
<TE>   "Three hundred people rode last month, even with Burning Man,"
said a twentysomething "masser" who complained that the ride made her
late to the annual counterculture art rave. This ride, cyclists
predict, will be bigger by far, though probably smaller than the
headline-making 1997 ride that drew more than 5,000 cyclists and
ended in violence. Also, like most things in San Francisco, it has a
left-versus-lefter political component. In this case, the Critical
Mass anniversary coincides with a separate municipal anti-car action,
San Francisco's first Car-Free Day.</TE>
<TE>   Based on a French experiment that caught on in Europe, that event
would bar car traffic from part of the city during business hours,
encouraging alternative forms of transit. Unlike car-free days in
Europe, San Francisco's observance won't really free much of the city
from traffic for a full day. At the behest of the affected merchants,
it instead will clear only four blocks of Montgomery Street downtown
from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.--a compromise that backers say will promote
future cooperation and that Critical Mass riders say has made the
event pointless.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're going to have a car-free day, it ought to last all
day," said Kay Hoskins, a 36-year-old event planner and regular
Critical Mass rider. "My guess is that when 2 o'clock rolls around, a
bunch of people are going to just stay out there in the street, no
matter what the police say. I've talked to people who will be going
down there. I might just be one of them."</TE>
<TE>   Such only-in-San-Francisco political theater underscores the
city's almost un-Californian ambivalence about cars. If California
had an anti-car-culture capital, it would be this city.</TE>
<TE>   About 485,000 motor vehicles a day roll in and out of San
Francisco, but they get little of the respect accorded to those in,
say, L.A. Populist revolts against freeways--both proposed and
existing--date to the 1950s; in the last one, the city voted to do
without the Central Freeway, damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta
earthquake. The scarcity of real estate--and of political will to
build parking garages--has squeezed parking capacity to the point
that, at any moment, hundreds of drivers are circling in a vain
search for a meter. Front lawns have been paved over by
garage-deprived vehicle owners. Cheap tricks have arisen to
facilitate the hoarding of curb space, from strategically placed
traffic cones and fake "No Parking" signs to the practice of covering
fire hydrants with upside-down metal trash cans and then parking next
to them as if they weren't there.</TE>
<TE>   Other adaptive behaviors, meanwhile, have stuffed the city with
scooters, skaters, skateboards, Italian motorcycles, motorized
wheelchairs, Segways and countless other wheeled gizmos. And each has
its lobbyists.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, in the last decade, narrow city streets have been narrowed
further to triple the space allotted to bike paths. Street signs have
been installed, scolding that bicycles have as much right to the road
as do cars. Anti-car lobbies have forced the city to extend crossing
times at crosswalks and to close chunks of Golden Gate Park to motor
vehicles on weekends. A pedestrian campaign against the new Segway
has City Hall scrambling even before the storied invention has hit
the market. Ridership on public transit is six times the state
average. Politicians hoping to get elected make it a point to say
nothing nice, ever, about SUVs.</TE>
<TE>   It is in this climate that Critical Masses, Car-Free Days and
other anti-car actions have come to flourish and--this year, at
least--to collide. Local alternative transit advocates say they were
planning their own Car-Free Day for next year when San Francisco
Supervisor Sophie Maxwell picked up the concept from the visiting
former mayor of Bogota, Enrique Penalosa, and made it her pet
project.</TE>
<TE>   "When they told me the date, I suggested they wait, because
Critical Mass could end up getting all the attention," said Marilyn
Smulyan, who sits on one of the city's transit committees. "But I was
told the supervisor wanted to do it this year."</TE>
<TE>   Maxwell said that easing into the car-free idea with a small,
experimental project seemed preferable to pushing for a big event
whose logistics might undermine it. And although she had hoped to
schedule it for the previous week to coincide with Europe's car-free
observances, she couldn't because City Hall staffers were just coming
back from a three-week recess. There would have been too little time
for planning, and "we just wanted to get something started," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   And, she added, the city is prepared should Critical Mass attempt
a disruption. "We're very concerned," she said. "The police are going
to be there."</TE>
<TE>   Critical Mass' Carlsson says that if the authorities end up
pushing people back onto the sidewalks, "they will essentially have
had a bogus event." In any case, he said, "stodgy, moribund,
government entities" can't compare to the excitement of Critical
Mass.</TE>
<TE>   Founded after the Gulf War, the movement rose from the belief
that, as Carlsson puts it, "we're living in a world rushing toward
insane destruction and barbarism driven by the oligarchy." He and his
friends saw "car-free behavior" as a way to subvert the nation's
reliance on fossil fuels and the general forces of globalization.</TE>
<TE>   But, he said, they also sensed that "guilt-tripping and scaring
people" might not be the best way to wean them from Big Oil. Their
solution was a consciousness-raising "party on bikes" that "would
infect people with an idea of what the world could be like" if they
were to "refuse to participate in the nexus of power." Forty-eight
people--about four times more than the organizers expected--showed up
on the last Friday of September 1992 for that first ride.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the Masses have grown to the far-less political
thousands, and spread from Albuquerque to Zurich--317 cities at last
count. Not all have been as successful as San Francisco's. Los
Angeles, for example, has three Critical Mass groups--downtown, in
Los Feliz and on the Westside--but Ron Milam, executive director of
the Los Angeles County Bicycle Coalition, says only a few dozen
bicyclists regularly show up. The biggest L.A. turnout, he said, was
during the 2000 Democratic National Convention, when police arrested
and jailed 71 Critical Mass riders for two days. The charges were
dropped, and civil class actions are pending against Los Angeles
County and the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   The 1997 police clash in San Francisco--which occurred after
months of tension between Mayor Willie Brown and the bike lobby--also
ended in mass arrests and charges that later were dropped. Brown has
since been more attentive to bicyclists, and disruption and publicity
have diminished, though attendance at most rides continues to average
between 500 and 1,000 cyclists.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Critical Mass has claimed credit for transit progress
(although more conventional transit lobbyists say its contribution
has been overblown). One city report this year found that the number
of San Franciscans who commute by bicycle had doubled since 1990, a
development that Carlsson attributes to hard-won municipal traffic
improvements.</TE>
<TE>   "There is this sense that you can't ride here because of the
hills, which is bunk, and this sense that it's scary to ride because
the streets aren't safe enough, which is true," he said. "But under
the pressure of mass seizure once a month, this city has made some
changes. There are now bike lanes all over town that didn't exist
before."</TE>
<TE>   This is why Critical Mass has kept up the pressure, though the
movement is far less ideological than it used to be. Some riders
still come to demonstrate, but for most, a Mass is more a street
scene, delightful to behold, if not to be caught in. Families ride
next to drag queens; hippies pedal next to yuppies. Tourists gawk
from sidewalks. Halloween massers have coursed through the city in
costume; Deadhead massers rode in tie dye after the death of Jerry
Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   It is an intimate, even old-fashioned spectacle, and San
Franciscans have come to cherish their bike movement even as it honks
them off. On Friday, as the dominant paradigm gets yet another
monthly subversion, the bicyclists plan to demonstrate that the mixed
feelings are mutual--they'll be handing out random anniversary gifts.</TE>

<LD>EXTRAVAGANCE</LD>
<LD>   By Gary Krist</LD>
<LD>   Broadway Books</LD>
<TE>   288 pages, $24</TE>
<TE>   Superlatively and consistently engrossing, Gary Krist's new novel,
"Extravagance," tracks the first act of the epic financial career of
William Tobias Merrick.</TE>
<TE>   Right out of Indiana, 20-year-old Merrick sweeps into New York
City to seek his fortune; he stumbles regularly, errs often and lucks
into a heady mix of big-city denizens and fellow aspirants, some of
whom befriend him.</TE>
<TE>   Krist tells this story on two levels, one occurring today, the
other taking place 300 years ago in a London awash in high-energy
financial dealings not unlike those of today's New York. The several
characters are the same but the technologies and neighborhoods
necessarily different. It is a masterfully realized conceit, and
never confusing to the reader, although the back-and-forth grows more
frequent as the tale progresses.</TE>
<TE>   In both eras, Merrick's new friends, and his successful uncle and
sponsor, Gilbert Hawking, propel the activity. Things move fast;
though some details may surprise, they do not halt the action.</TE>
<TE>   Starting with little cash but savvy instincts and a credible
amount of luck, the insatiable Merrick finds himself on both the
buying and selling ends of a financial scheme, greedily parlaying his
connections with his uncle and Ted Witherspoon, the financial genius
who has helped him score a series of sizable monetary coups. The
climax comes when--in the very moment a tragedy befalls him--he is
caught between loyalties to these two mentors as his double-dealing
is exposed.</TE>
<TE>   Will's genuine problem, however, is that he lacks the maturity to
understand clearly the implications of his moral choices. He is smart
but naive. And he is reminded of this regularly, almost
humiliatingly, by the bright woman he is courting, Eliza Fletcher.
She is the privileged sister of a technological sleight-of-hand
artist whose invention--in both time zones--precipitates Will's
crisis of conscience at the climax.</TE>
<TE>   Getting to that point is a romp through the author's keen
observations of our turn-of-this-century urban world. He prods his
subjects with unpretentious good humor.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the moment Merrick begins to feel his oats, Krist
describes: " ... An impeccable dove-gray Hickey-Freeman suit, along
with an off-white linen shirt and a Hermes silk tie, had been set out
on my bedspread. I dressed quickly and was pleased to find the suit
an almost perfect fit. Looking at myself in the full-length mirror
was something of a revelation. The figure in the glass was
unmistakably a New Yorker, and a New Yorker of some consequence. I
put my hand to my ear, cell-phonically, and said, 'Four thousand
shares of Cisco, at the market. And do it now!' "</TE>
<TE>   Later, meeting Eliza at a new restaurant, Merrick observes: "The
dining room was all red, emphatically red--crimson walls, vermilion
carpeting, cerise paper wall sconces, tomato-red upholstered
chairs--and its clashiness was both clearly intentional and blatantly
aggressive. A stiletto-thin black woman (slinky scarlet dress slit to
her upper thighs) led us to our table and produced two palm-sized
electronic devices on which the evening's menu was displayed ... "</TE>
<TE>   Aphorism is one of Krist's talents, but not the grandstanding
kind. Here, he sneaks one in while extolling the profits to be made
by attending the opera:</TE>
<TE>   " 'Each? You spent $600 to see this opera?'</TE>
<TE>   " 'Worth every penny. And besides, it's tax deductible. Did you
see that bar as we came in? I made one of my best business
connections there two years ago, while waiting for a glass of
champagne. It was Tosca, as I recall. Puccini makes people very
susceptible to persuasion.' "</TE>
<TE>   The author also describes his characters pointedly: "Sir
Reginald--in London for a short time, up from the family seat in
Devonshire--sipped his chocolate disdainfully. He sat beside his
wife, Lady Dorothea, a substantial female, who was as silent as her
husband was garrulous, her face as grey as his was pink. Sitting
there, they called to mind nothing so much as two great fat prawns,
only one of which had been cooked."</TE>
<TE>   "Extravagance" is substantial and a fun, fast read. Now, like
Krist's insatiable character Merrick, we are left wanting more.</TE>

<HD>Creativity That Is All in Good Fun</HD>
<DH>Modular play structures and colorful furniture from an
architect, and for speed fans, a zippy remote-control car will keep
the wheels rolling</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET EASTMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Playing is work for Barbara Butler. The San Francisco architect has
been making climbable outdoor structures and whimsical kids'
furniture since 1987, long before her young clients were born.</LD>
<LD>   Walt Disney Productions used her celestial-motif basketball hoop
in "Bicentennial Man," Robert Redford tapped her to create a
children's theater for the Sundance Institute in Utah, and her
twisted wood throne was displayed at the Laguna Art Museum in Laguna
Beach. But her favorite seal of approval comes from kids.</LD>
<LD>   When they blast a water cannon from the top of a fort, bounce on
an earthquaky platform mounted on car springs or tunnel through
escape doors into secret hiding places, she knows she's reached their
endless imagination.</LD>
<TE>   That's why she sits down with them--and, of course, their parents,
who are paying thousands of dollars for her work--before settling on
a design. Together, they make a wish list and fill up sketch pads
with colored-pencil drawings of what could be. Some of her young
partners' concepts aren't practical. Nixed are ziplines--overhead
ropes with gliding handles--that fly them into tight spots without
enough landing room. But ideas that free them to play-act in castles,
pirate ships and jails are good to go.</TE>
<TE>   The modular structures can grow along with their owners by adding
towers, bridges and roofs.</TE>
<TE>   And learning comes with the lollygagging. "We use red and other
colored stains to highlight structural elements like support beams to
show how things are built," Butler says.</TE>
<TE>   Her wood furniture has wavy edges and carved images. Trains,
planes and UFOs cover the pine Zephyr trundle bed. An ash table has
relief carvings of fish, and a locking safe has its combination
hidden underneath a sliding shield.</TE>
<TE>   There's a one-year wait for Butler's furniture and six months for
the play structures, but don't fret yet about getting one sooner: A
garden playhouse with tulips on the front door that would sell for
$4,600 will be auctioned off at the Caring for Children and Families
with AIDS fund-raiser on Oct. 13 at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel
in Los Angeles.</TE>

<TE>   Tricked-Out Turbos</TE>
<TE>   Competing for attention among the vintage wheels at the Petersen
Automotive Museum in Los Angeles is a zippy upstart: a mini
remote-control racer with more customizable parts than a Barris
Kustom car.</TE>
<TE>   The ZipZaps, introduced by RadioShack on Wednesday at the museum,
are modeled after the Chrysler PT Cruiser, Ford SVT Mustang Cobra and
Honda Civic coupe.</TE>
<TE>   But they can be modified on the outside and under the hood. Gold
hubcaps, rear air foils and suspension bars snap on, and engines can
be turbocharged to 21,500 rpm.</TE>
<TE>   The car is 2 1/2 inches long, roughly the size of Bit Chargers and
Micro-sizers. The plastic body is hand-painted and detailed down to
its teeny windshield wiper blades. It has a built-in Ni-MH
rechargeable battery; the wireless controller-charger is powered by
two AAA batteries. Connect the car to the charger, wait 60 seconds
and you're off ... for another five minutes of zooming. The
controller can maneuver the ZipZaps in six directions.</TE>
<TE>   The basic kit with a car, controller-charger and trading card is
$20. Upgrades and an obstacle course are $5 to $10 more. For more

<TE>   Those who appreciate flashbacks, hold on to your handlebars:
Kronan Cycle of Stockholm is finally sending its classic one-speed
bike to our shores 50 years after it was designed. New parts and
streamlined production methods carefully duplicate the original
style, which was used by the Swedish army during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Urban commutes may be more enjoyable astride a steel-framed
bicycle with wide balloon tires and a spring-cushioned saddle. Other
practical features include fenders and chain guards that protect
pants from roadside splatter and grabby chain links, a rack that
secures a grocery bag or briefcase behind the seat, and
generator-powered lights in the front and back to illuminate your
comings and goings. For fun, there's a cast-aluminum license plate to
identify the coaster as yours, and, yes, there's a bell.</TE>
<TE>   The bike--painted in black, red, orange, green, silver or
cream--costs $350 and takes five weeks to ring at your door. For more
information, call (866) 465-7662 or visit www.kronan cycle.com.</TE>

<LD>A Meat Tray Car!</LD>
<LD>   There are many ways to get people and things from place to place:
automobiles, trains, planes, trucks and bicycles--just to name a few.</LD>
<LD>   This activity will show you how to create a new kind of
transportation--a meat tray car powered by the air in a balloon!</LD>
<TE>   Materials needed: small rectangular meat tray; tape; 3 straws; 2
bamboo skewers; 4 lids from 35-millimeter film canisters; balloon;
some help from an adult.</TE>
<TE>   Step 1: Clean and dry the empty meat tray.</TE>
<TE>   Step 2: Turn the tray so the long sides are at the top and bottom.
Tape two of the straws across the tray, one on the right and the
other on the left side of the tray.</TE>
<TE>   Step 3: Slide a bamboo skewer through both of the straws.</TE>
<TE>   Step 4: Ask an adult to poke a hole in the center of each film
canister lid.</TE>
<TE>   Step 5: Place the lids onto the ends of the bamboo skewers, making
sure they fit snugly. Your car now has wheels!</TE>
<TE>   Step 6: Turn the meat tray over again, so the wheels are ready to
roll.</TE>
<TE>   Step 7: Tape the balloon securely onto one end of the third straw.</TE>
<TE>   Step 8: Tape the straw onto the center of the meat tray, so the
end without the balloon extends over the back edge of the meat tray
forming the "exhaust pipe."</TE>
<TE>   Step 9: Have an adult cut a small notch in the meat tray to make
the "exhaust pipe" fit better.</TE>
<TE>   Step 10: Now blow into the straw to inflate the balloon. Set the
car down and see how fast it goes.</TE>
<TE>   See how far your car will go with one blow into the balloon. Will
it go twice as far if you blow twice into the balloon? What do you
think will happen if you use a larger balloon? Have fun!</TE>
<TE>   You can learn more about the different types of transportation at
Discovery Science Center's "Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles" exhibit
through November.</TE>

<LD>* My favorite dinosaur is seismosaurus. They were not meat eaters.
They ate tall trees and plants and drank water. Also, the
seismosaurus was the longest land animal ever to have lived. It
measured 120 feet. It was discovered in New Mexico. It weighed up to
110 tons.</LD>
<LD>   --Laura, 9</LD>

<TE>   Huntington Beach</TE>
<TE>   * My favorite dinosaur is stegosaurus. It is my favorite because
if a predator came along, it could defend itself by using its tail or
by using the spikes on its back. There's one more good thing about
the stegosaurus: If a person came near it, it wouldn't eat the
person. It would just walk away because it was a plant eater. The
worst thing that could happen is that the dinosaur would smack the
person with its tail.</TE>
<TE>   --Vincent, third grade</TE>
<TE>   Clover Avenue Elementary</TE>

<TE>   * Triceratops is my favorite dinosaur. Triceratops means
"three-horned face." It weighed up to 12 tons. It had a beak. Some
people say that it used its beak to knock down trees. It was a plant
eater. I like its bony frill.</TE>

could fly.</TE>

<HD>Center Shines Its Art Through Clouds of War</HD>
<DH>Directors hope performances will help Americans better

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>In a bright yellow rehearsal room at a new arts center in Century
City, a troupe of eight actors and dancers practices a play about a
mythic Persian hero named Arash. The decor suggests eclectic tastes.
An African sculpture and an Indian porcelain elephant are tucked into
the corners. Chinese and Moroccan lanterns light the evening.</LD>
<LD>   The part of the world these objects represent may seem remote to
some Westerners, but not to the artists, writers, musicians and
filmmakers who will present their work here. For them, the eastern
Mediterranean is the heart of the world.</LD>
<LD>   Shida Pegahi, director of this new Pacific Arts Center, opened it
this summer as a school for children and adults. From the beginning,
she wanted to attract not only students but also working artists and
performers, and she offered to make the space available to the
Levantine Cultural Center, a group of arts activists she helped
found.</LD>
<TE>   Since it began two years ago, the Levantine Center has been a
state of mind more than an actual place. It has sponsored
performances held in various spaces around the city, featuring
artists from the eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East. Starting
this month, the Pacific Arts and Levantine Cultural centers will
share a home address.</TE>
<TE>   "When you don't have a lot of funds, you have to pool resources,"
says Pegahi, who was born in Iran, educated in England and has been
teaching ballet and modern dance in Los Angeles for 18 years. "More
than ever in America," she says, "people want to know what the Middle
East and the Levantine area are all about. This city is very open to
new ideas."</TE>
<TE>   The term "Levant" was first applied to Syria and Lebanon in the
'20s when the French governed them. Lever, to rise, suggests the
East, where the sun comes up. A looser definition came to include all
the countries on the eastern Mediterranean shore, from Greece through
Turkey and Lebanon to Israel into Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   Now, even as the Levantine Center sets down roots, it is again
broadening the definition of the territory. Its board of directors
includes Los Angeles residents with family ties in Pakistan,
Afghanistan, Morocco, Iran and Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   Pegahi got involved with the Levantine Center when she met Jordan
Elgrably, a Los Angeles native whose father was raised in Morocco.
Elgrably has traveled the world as a freelance journalist. "Jordan
had an idea for a cultural center, and he had a name in mind," Pegahi
says. "We both wanted to see a gathering place where people from the
Middle East and the eastern Mediterranean cultures could meet."</TE>
<TE>   The center's fall lineup, which can be found at
www.levantinecenter.org, lists plenty of opportunities. A Turkish
author, Syrian dervishes, and an evening of Jewish music from Turkey,
Greece and Jerusalem are among the planned events. A number of them
are promoted by the Levantine Center but funded and hosted by major
arts institutions, including the Getty Center, Skirball Cultural
Center and the Armand Hammer Museum. Others are joint efforts with
the Richard Riordan Public Library and Beyond Baroque Literary/Arts
Center in Venice.</TE>
<TE>   Frederick Dewey, Beyond Baroque's artistic director, met Elgrably
when he stopped in to the Venice bookstore more than a year ago. They
discovered they think alike. "If there is one thing we can say about
this time in American history," Dewey says, "it is that
narrow-mindedness is a very dangerous position. The Levantine
initiative combats that position. They create ways to promote
dialogue between groups that might not otherwise have a voice. They
focus on culture, not politics, which so often falls into
irresolvable conflict."</TE>
<TE>   The wide cultural diversity the Levantine Center's monthly
calendar represents helps to explain its vision. "We want to build up
a crossroads sensibility in Los Angeles," says Elgrably, who is
director of the center. As an Arab Jew of mixed ancestry who was
raised in Echo Park, he considers himself a good example of the
ethnic diversity the center represents.</TE>
<TE>   "Levantine is a metaphor for an immigrant and American identity,"
he says. "It is to be Turkish and Armenian and American, for example.
Or, Arab and Christian with an Israeli passport and a U.S. green
card."</TE>
<TE>   It has taken two years of working nights from home offices,
building an international board of directors and hosting music,
literature and dance events in borrowed or rented spaces, to reach
this point.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw disparate arts and cultural groups around Los Angeles with
no official address," says Elgrably, whose home office in West
Hollywood is decorated with textiles from Yemen, an Egyptian mirror
and an Iranian carpet. "From the beginning, my proposal was to look
at the similarities between these cultures and at the same time put
each of them into a larger cultural context."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the countries the center includes have been at war for
generations. That, says Elgrably, is all the more reason to bring
them together in Los Angeles. "We won't let war keep us apart because
we will insist that the arts become part of the conversation," he
says. "We'll talk about politics and other issues through the arts."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the events he is proudest of so far include an evening of
Arab female poets from around the world, held at Beyond Baroque last
fall, and an evening with Amiel Alcalay in July. Alcalay is a poet
and essayist with family roots in the Balkans, Greece and Turkey, who
lives in Massachusetts. He developed the idea of a Levantine culture
that Elgrably uses as his guide. "For me," Alcalay said during his
visit to Los Angeles this summer, "Levantine has come to represent
more than geography. It is a melting pot and a particularly rich mix
because of the many cultures it represents."</TE>
<TE>   The Persian play in rehearsals at the center tells the story of
Arash, a shepherd chosen to shoot the arrow that will mark one border
of the Persian empire. Famous archers have declined the challenge for
fear their arrows might fall short. Arash accepts the challenge and
sends his arrow farther than anyone dreamed it could go. In an
unusual twist, Arash is played by a woman in this version.</TE>
<TE>   If the idea for a cultural center that promotes education through
the arts sounds right, the funding has been limited. The Levantine
Center relies on grants, the board of directors and the $60 annual
dues from its 400 or so members for its main financial support.
Members receive free tickets to all the events the center sponsors,
including a monthly book group. "Half the members are Americans who
are curious about that part of the world; the rest have heritage
there," Elgrably says.</TE>
<TE>   Jawad Ali, who was born in Pakistan and now teaches English
composition at Irvine Valley College, joined the Levantine Center
board to help bring attention to playwrights and novelists from
western Asia. "We can be a forum for discussing issues through the
arts," he says. "It is imperative that we in this country get better
informed about that part of the world."</TE>
<TE>   A photo exhibit on the Levantine Web site this month is the sort
of discussion starter that Ali calls "emancipatory." The exhibit, "A
9/11 Gallery," looks at the terror attacks of last September from a
wide range of perspectives. One image shows an art gallery where a
Muslim man wearing ethnic dress sits inside a fenced cage. It is
titled "Cultural Isolation."</TE>
<TE>   Ali says that to air ethnic and political tensions through the
arts is part of the work of the Levantine Center. "If we humanize the
people involved and show that we're not just talking about stick
figures, we can help bring about peace," he says. "We all can get
along."</TE>
<TE>   After the attack on the World Trade Center, Ali's friends advised
him to change his name. "That's not right," he says. "We need to feel
free to talk about what concerns us."</TE>

<HD>In Little Ways, Moms Foil Big Risks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN REIMER</AU>
<BD>BALTIMORE SUN</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Closeness to Mom Can Delay First Sex Among Younger Teens," the
headline read.</LD>
<LD>   "Teenagers are less likely to start having sex when their mothers
are involved in their lives, have a close relationship with them and
successfully communicate their values on sex to them," according to
the latest findings from the largest-ever survey of American teens.</LD>
<LD>   One word jumped out at me, and it wasn't "sex." It was "mom."</LD>
<TE>   Mom? Don't they mean "parents?" Doesn't "closeness to parents"
delay sex and a list of other risky behaviors? Aren't we a team, even
if only a tag team? Aren't we in this together? Apparently not.</TE>
<TE>   "This does not mean dads are irrelevant," University of Minnesota
researcher Dr. Robert Blum, author of the study, is quick to say. "It
just means they weren't available when the surveys were being done."</TE>
<TE>   Blum and his associates have learned a great deal about teens
after following 12,000 junior high and high school kids for five
years. And, if this latest report is any indication, they have
learned a great deal about the teens' mothers too.</TE>
<TE>   But not about their fathers.</TE>
<TE>   "Fathers are harder to come by," admits Blum. "It is a matter of
who is available. Who fills out the forms. Who is there when the
researcher arrives for the in-depth interview. In most families,
women are responsible for these kinds of things."</TE>
<TE>   It could be that "closeness to fathers" is just as significant in
delaying early sexual behavior, especially among girls whose fathers
stand very close when the boyfriend comes to call. We just don't
know. But my guess is, if the fathers didn't have time to fill out
the survey and weren't there for the follow-up interview, then that
"closeness" thing isn't happening.</TE>
<TE>   Mothers who are already struggling to supervise their elusive
teens and keep some communication going in the midst of regular
emotional explosions have been told something they already knew.</TE>
<TE>   It is up to us to keep our teenagers safe, and it can't be done
from a distance. But how can you judge the closeness of your
relationship with your teens when they are likely to slam the door in
your face or storm out of the room shrieking that they hate you?</TE>
<TE>   "There are many ways to do this without telling yourself, 'It is
time to find my child and grill them,' " says Sarah Brown, director
of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy and the mother of
three girls. "There are small ways to pay attention to them. Know the
names of their friends, their teachers. Ask about these people. This
is not a small thing. It is another subtle way of signaling that you
care about them."</TE>
<TE>   Blum says this "connectedness" that is so important in protecting
kids from their own bad judgment is not necessarily established
during big-ticket, scripted adventures.</TE>
<TE>   "What it is about is talking, listening, being available," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Blum once asked a group of teens, who described their
relationships with their mothers as "close," what that meant.</TE>
<TE>   "They said things like: 'She's at work, but she always calls to
make sure I am home from school' and 'She always leaves me a note
telling me where she is and when she will be home' and 'She knows all
my friends' and 'She always leaves me a snack in the fridge.'</TE>
<TE>   "It is about asking about the French test," Blum says, "about
knowing there was a test and it was in French class."</TE>
<TE>   There are caveats in this report. Mom's influence doesn't seem to
be as strong with sons, and it wears thin with daughters as they
enter their junior year in high school.</TE>
<TE>   The report also demonstrates that we don't do a very good job of
letting our kids know just how strongly we disapprove of their having
sex as young teenagers. And the really bad news? Half of all mothers
are unaware when their children become sexually active.</TE>
<TE>   But the study also reinforces a concept: "What we say and do
impacts our kids, sometimes directly and sometimes by shaping their
perceptions," says Blum. "We matter in the lives of our teens."</TE>
<TE>   Adds Brown: "We have not totally lost our teens to peers and pop
culture. We are rediscovering the power of parents."</TE>
<TE>   Well, the power of mothers, anyway.</TE>

<LD>Taking down his display, which had been on the bulletin board all
week, a boy told those gathered near, "I'm going to paste some of
these pictures in my autobiography book."</LD>
<LD>   "My mom bought me a larger and fancier notebook to put my writings
in," boasted a girl.</LD>
<LD>   Several students begged the teacher, "Read some more about your
school days."</LD>
<TE>   The teacher responded, "We learned to read in first grade by using
a big chart about a dog named Rover. In fifth grade, when we were
good, our teacher read the latest Raggedy Ann and Andy books."</TE>
<TE>   Rhonda laughed. "You've got to be kidding!"</TE>
<TE>   The teacher gave her a stern look.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm ready for a new topic to write about," said a boy.</TE>
<TE>   "What gives with these eager beavers?" Rhonda asked Tonya.</TE>
<TE>   "How many of you have responsibilities at home?" the teacher
asked.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly every hand shot up in the air.</TE>
<TE>   "Here were some of mine: Doing dishes, and I hated it because we
didn't have hot running water and had to heat kettles full of water
on the stove. However, I loved to iron and would do it for anyone in
the neighborhood. Shoveling snow at night when everything was still
and quiet gave me enjoyment. I'd watch the snowflakes reflecting in
the street lights as they danced in flickering paths down to earth."</TE>
<TE>   Tonya passed a note to Rhonda telling her that once she lived in a
snowy area and loved it and planned to write about it.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile the teacher said, "It's a good time to start thinking
about a name for your autobiography. I'm using the title 'Getting to
Know Me.' And by the way, we'll be sharing our work with parents and
friends on 'Back to School Night.' "</TE>
<TE>   "Uh, oh," Rhonda said out loud. "My mom always attends."</TE>
<TE>   Friday: Uh, oh. Now what?</TE>

she is still writing today and hopes her students are doing likewise.

<HD>Inside 'Trading'</HD>
<DH>What really happens when two couples redo each other's
places for a TV show</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEANNINE STEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sonja Teri and Caroline Krabach were your typical "Trading Spaces"
fanatics: Caroline would tape the show daily and watch it when she
got home. They'd dish about Vern's cool minimalist bedroom makeover
or Frank's funky country kitchen redo. They even got their respective
boyfriends, Paul Hogan and Chris Wylde, hooked.</LD>
<LD>   Then, one day, they crossed the line. They applied to appear on
the show.</LD>
<LD>   Teri: "We were all sitting around and I said, 'Oh, wouldn't it be
funny ...?' And Paul and Chris wrote this really clever application."</LD>
<TE>   Hogan: "What did we write?"</TE>
<TE>   Teri: "Something sarcastic."</TE>
<TE>   Hogan: "Yeah, like 'We're the greatest people in the world.' "</TE>
<TE>   Teri: " 'Cause we're young and we're fun.' "</TE>
<TE>   Wylde: "We totally lied about the dimensions. The room has to be
at least 14 by 14, but our living rooms are rectangular, and, you
know, we didn't understand if it was supposed to be meters or inches.
It was 14 something. Cubits, I think."</TE>
<TE>   Every day some 300 to 500 people apply to be on "Trading Spaces,"
the Learning Channel show in which two couples agree to trade homes
for 48 hours and redo one room in the other's house on a $1,000
budget (paid for by the show). Each couple works with an interior
designer who plans the makeover, and an on-site carpenter builds
whatever is necessary, from kitchen counter tops to a coffee table.
The contestants, designers and carpenter paint, hammer, grout and
sand while the clock ticks down to the much-anticipated
"reveal"--when the couples, eyes squeezed closed, are led into their
new rooms and the audience gets to see them gasp with delight or
stare in open-mouthed horror.</TE>
<TE>   Now in its third year, "Spaces" has become a certified hit,
winning its Saturday night time slot against other cable shows and
spawning two knockoffs: "While You Were Out" on TLC and "Surprise by
Design" on sister-station Discovery Channel. It's also turned rather
anonymous designers and carpenters into superstars--Genevieve Gorder,
Vern Yip, Frank Bielec, Laurie Hickson-Smith Douglas Wilson, Ty
Pennington--and inspired effusive posts to the official fan-site chat
room, such as: "So far the best rooms of the new season were the two
kitchens and Doug's sage/squares bedroom. The rest of them were
absolutely horrible," and "What was up with the vertical blinds? I
just can't get past the vertical blinds!"</TE>
<TE>   As it happened, the ultramodern makeover of Teri and Hogan's
living room would become one of the show's more talked about
episodes.</TE>
<TE>   Although the four friends, all in their 20s, have many things in
common, "Trading Spaces" may have been in the top five when they
applied in December. They met in Washington, D.C.--Krabach, Wylde and
Hogan as students at American University, and Teri and Hogan while
working at Crate &amp; Barrel. Krabach and Wylde moved to L.A. a couple
of years ago when Krabach transferred to USC; she now works on "The
Wayne Brady Show" as assistant to the executive producer and
director, and he's an actor who hosted Comedy Central's now-defunct
"The Chris Wylde Show." Teri, who works for an Italian clothing
company, and Hogan, a TV production assistant, moved here a year ago
and took the apartment downstairs from their friends.</TE>
<TE>   Within a few weeks of submitting their online application, the
couples were told a location scout would check out their apartments
and interview them. They got the official OK in January, and the show
was shot in February.</TE>
<TE>   Hogan: "First they let you know they're interested, and they talk
to you on the phone to make sure you have a personality and aren't
like Sheetrock."</TE>
<TE>   Teri: "We were kind of nervous."</TE>
<TE>   Wylde: "The worst part was showing people the way we lived
before."</TE>
<TE>   Krabach and Wylde's "before" apartment shouldn't have shocked
anyone who was ever young and struggling and living in a utilitarian
one-bedroom. Their living room contained a much-hated futon sofa, a
shabby slipcovered armchair, a Roy Lichtenstein poster and a
bookcase. The otherwise presentable hardwood floor was spotted with
stains left by a previous tenant's dog.</TE>
<TE>   Teri and Hogan's place had a red-shag area rug, a white
slipcovered sofa, a wall-mounted CD rack and a TV stand. Their
fondness for modern design was evident in their retro-patterned
curtains and kidney-shaped side tables.</TE>
<TE>   Although couples on the show are asked to interpret their friends'
taste, the make-overs are almost entirely guided by the designers.</TE>
<TE>   Wylde: "They wanted Vern, and we wanted Laurie. Or Genevieve."</TE>
<TE>   Teri: "I cannot stand Laurie! Why do you like her?"</TE>
<TE>   Wylde: "Because I like what she does!"</TE>
<TE>   Teri: "You don't find her annoying?"</TE>
<TE>   Hogan: "Sonja wanted Vern because Vern does a lot of clean, modern
stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Wylde: "She had the whole thing figured out. It was definitely
going to be Vern."</TE>
<TE>   Teri: "I had seen the show the week before, and this woman cried
because she said she didn't want her fireplace touched and Doug built
a facade around it. So when the crew got here I was told we got Doug,
and I was crying. But Doug was so cool."</TE>
<TE>   The crew set up camp the day before shooting started, and the
carpentry tent was pitched in the building's small adjacent parking
lot. Ty Pennington was the episode's carpenter.</TE>
<TE>   Designer Doug Wilson used one of Teri and Hogan's pillows as
inspiration for a bold red-and-white stenciled supergraphic covering
three walls.</TE>
<TE>   "Gen" Gorder went with a Havana-revisited theme for Krabach and
Wylde's room, using a serene aqua on the walls and ceiling and black
on the floor, and designing an entertainment center with a scorched
wood-grain finish.</TE>
<TE>   Krabach: "Just to walk into my apartment and have Genevieve and
Doug and Ty in my kitchen was so surreal. The first season I watched
this show I was obsessed with these people. Now I couldn't even walk
into my own kitchen, it was like this sacred space."</TE>
<TE>   Wylde: "My favorite show is 'The Simpsons,' and it would be like
having Bart and Homer and Marge in my kitchen."</TE>
<TE>   Teri: We really hit it off with Genevieve. She and Paul went to
the same camp together. She went to design school, I studied
environmental design. I'm a flamenco dancer and she used to live in
Spain. The times we weren't on camera we'd just sit up there and
paint and talk."</TE>
<TE>   Hogan: "We didn't talk to Chris and Caroline before the show about
what they wanted, we all went into it so open. We had a nice place we
liked, but we didn't care if it got changed. Their place looked like
crap, and they admitted it."</TE>
<TE>   Teri: "On TV I said their place is dingy and dark, and they will
never forgive me for saying that."</TE>
<TE>   Hogan: "You meant to say 'dim.' "</TE>
<TE>   Teri: "I didn't mean dirty. But if you go on the show, you really
have to let go of any of your expectations. You sign up for it, so
you have to be ready to suffer the consequences, good or bad."</TE>
<TE>   Shooting in neighboring apartments proved something of a
challenge, and the crew went to great lengths to make sure "no beans
were spilled, no cats were let out of any bags," as Wylde puts it.</TE>
<TE>   The couples were blindfolded before they stepped out, cast and
crew put tape over any paint stains, and windows were covered with
blackout curtains. Well past midnight after the first day of filming,
the couples rendezvoused on the corner to talk (not about the design
plans) and snack on Oreos.</TE>
<TE>   Wylde: "We were up until 5 a.m. stenciling the walls. We had one
stencil. The most difficult thing was stenciling the radiator."</TE>
<TE>   Teri: "We had to do the floors solely on our own. The hardest
thing for me was putting the rivets in the place mats to make the
sconces."</TE>
<TE>   Hogan: "The hardest thing for me was looking like I knew what I
was doing when I was with Ty."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the red and white walls, Teri and Hogan also got a
custom-made U-shaped platform sofa with red cushions and lighting
along the base.</TE>
<TE>   Krabach and Wylde had their futon mattress re-covered in white
vinyl and their chair slipcovered in camouflage and black fabric, and
gained some lighting with wall sconces made from vinyl place mats.</TE>
<TE>   After two days, it was finally time for the grand payoff.</TE>
<TE>   Wylde: "The reveals are absolutely, 100% not faked. Everyone's
huddled behind the monitor watching, and you have to be completely
quiet. I was so excited when I saw our place that I said the F-word.
Paul did too."</TE>
<TE>   Teri: "We were done at 4 in the afternoon, and we waited two hours
before our reveal, and we were just sitting there freaking out."</TE>
<TE>   Hogan: "They said we were going to reveal second because it's
based on who had the most work done and how different the room is.</TE>
<TE>   "And we're like, 'The room we did is nothing like it was before,
so what could they have possibly done in our place?' "</TE>
<TE>   Wylde: "We knew Paul and Sonja would love their place. They wanted
their living room to look like a really cool cocktail lounge. And
everyone's, like, 'What the heck did you do to their room? What is
that?' "</TE>
<TE>   Teri: "I don't expect everyone to like it because we don't think
everybody could live in it, but I expect people to understand that we
like it."</TE>
<TE>   Krabach: "In the chat rooms people were talking about how much
they hated Paul and Sonja's place. They hated it."</TE>
<TE>   Hogan: "Everyone thinks that being in the room is going to make
you dizzy or give you a headache, and it doesn't at all."</TE>
<TE>   The couples have made small changes to their rooms. Teri and Hogan
have put a chrome and wood bookcase next to the TV. Krabach and Wylde
have returned a round mosaic-framed mirror to the wall, and Connor
and Parpie, their dogs, have made a small tear in the vinyl futon
cover.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after the show aired in April the four started getting
recognized, from the racetrack to restaurants. They've stayed friends
with the designers and Pennington, and get together or trade e-mails
when they can. The experience, they say, was "fantastic"--except for
one thing.</TE>
<TE>   Wylde: "We can't watch the show anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Krabach: "I'm more into just the reveals now. I used to like
watching the whole process."</TE>
<TE>   Wylde: "It was fun watching it, and then we did it, and that was
so much more fun than watching it, and now we're like, 'Let's see if
there are any good music videos on.' "</TE>

<LD>Television star Kelly Clarkson is now officially a pop star. The
winner of the "American Idol" talent competition leaps from the
airwaves to the top spot on the singles chart this week with her
ballad "Before Your Love," which sold 236,000 copies in its debut
week. The Fox network show was followed rabidly by millions, and more
"Idol"-related events are on tap in coming weeks: A full album by the
20-year-old Clarkson, and a disc and concert tour featuring the
"American Idol" finalists.</LD>
<LD>   On the album chart, the grim hard rock of Disturbed takes over the
top spot, with the Chicago band's "Believe" debuting at No. 1 with
284,000 copies sold during the week that ended Sunday, according to
Nielsen SoundScan.</LD>
<LD>   Disturbing Tha Peace, an Atlanta hip-hop collective, scored the
second-highest debut with "Golden Grain," which sold 95,000 copies to
rank No. 6. The other top 10 debuts were by Lifehouse's "Stanley
Climbfall" at No. 7 and Kenny G's "Paradise" at No. 9. The other
positions in the top 10 are held by, in order, Dixie Chicks, Avril
Lavigne, Nelly, Eminem, Norah Jones and Toby Keith.</LD>

<LD>   Garth Brooks once sang about "Unanswered Prayers" sometimes being
the greatest blessing, and sophomore country singer Brad Paisley
probably feels like the beneficiary. Brooks reportedly passed on
recording Paisley's new hit "I'm Going to Miss Her (The Fishin'
Song)," as did Alan Jackson and George Strait, but Paisley finally
bit and took it to No. 1 on the country charts. The West Virginian's
continuing success has helped him step up to headliner status, and he
tops the lineup for the CMT Most Wanted Tour, which stops Friday at
Universal Amphitheatre.</LD>

<TE>   Andy Garcia stars as a writer on the skids in George
Hickenlooper's "The Man From Elysian Fields." Backed into a desperate
economic situation, Garcia's Byron Tiller, a once-promising novelist,
finds himself reduced to working for proprietor Mick Jagger's
high-class escort service. Tiller's clients include the lonely wife
(Olivia Williams) of an aging Pulitzer Prize-winning writer (James
Coburn), and he is led into an unimaginable situation with his
literary hero.</TE>

<TE>   Jim Morrison is commonly lionized as the bad boy of the '60s L.A.
rock scene, but purists recognize Love frontman Arthur Lee as the
seminal wild child, a volatile and enigmatic performer who set the
standard of possessed performance. Love's career has had more ups and
downs than a schoolyard teeter-totter, and he spent the last several
years in prison on a firearms conviction, resuming touring shortly
after his release in December. He and the current Love lineup return
Friday to his old Hollywood stamping grounds, albeit at the tony (and
recently refurbished) Henry Fonda Theatre, as well as Saturday at the
Coach House in San Juan Capistrano.</TE>

<TE>   The shimmering energy and glowing detail of traditional Balinese
music and dance is the birthright of the 30 Cudamani dancers and
musicians coming to the World Festival of Sacred Music with a program
never before seen outside their island homeland. Under the direction
of I Dewa Putu Berata, their gamelan style is as comfortable in the
contemporary as it is in the most antique classical repertory. On
this first U.S. visit, they are reviving a rarely seen form of Legong
dancing, one that includes potent symbols of good and evil: elaborate
masks of the Barong (a kind of beneficent red lion) and Rangda (an
all-powerful female demon). These two figures remain in eternal
combat, and as a result, existence remains a balancing act as intense
and subtle as Balinese dancing itself.</TE>

<LD>   Marlene Dietrich, who became one of the most iconic of
international film stars, was launched from the relative obscurity of
German comedies and melodramas with the dual-language production in
1930 of "The Blue Angel." Dietrich stars as cabaret singer Lola Lola
who ruins the life of love-obsessed professor Emil Jannings in the
tragedy directed by Josef von Sternberg. The film opens "The Devil Is
an Angel: The Films of Marlene Dietrich," LACMA's 13-film
retrospective, which brings together Dietrich's many collaborations

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Eclectic Orange Festival is sweating out visa clearance for two
Moroccan horse riders, crucial performers in Theatre Zingaro, an
international equestrian troupe whose 20 performances in Costa Mesa,
starting Oct. 12, would likely have to be canceled without them.</LD>
<LD>   Eclectic Orange director Dean Corey said Wednesday that the
Zingaro engagement is "critical" to the success of the festival,
which runs Oct. 11 to Nov. 9. A 1,500-capacity tent is being built
near the Orange County Performing Arts Center to house Theatre
Zingaro, which accounts for about $2.2 million of the $3.5-million
budget for the annual, multi-venue festival.</LD>
<LD>   Corey said he began worrying about three weeks ago when it became
clear that four Zingaro performers--three Moroccan riders and a Cuban
dancer--were caught up in the post-Sept. 11 security checks that have
bogged down the visa-granting process and led to a number of missed
U.S. engagements for foreign performers.</LD>
<TE>   Two of the Moroccans have been scheduled for interviews tomorrow
and next week at the U.S. consulate in Paris, Corey said--an
indication that they are likely to receive their visas. Prospects
remain murkier for the third Moroccan and the Cuban, but the show can
go on without them.</TE>
<TE>   "We think we're OK, but it's not over until it's over," said
Corey.</TE>
<TE>   All of the visa-less artists have performed in the United States
before as part of the French-based Zingaro troupe. Festival
administrators and Zingaro's U.S. agents have tried to enlist help
from U.S. government officials in securing the visas, Corey said;
French President Jacques Chirac wrote to the U.S. Embassy on the
troupe's behalf.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that helped," Corey said.</TE>

<HD>The Mystique's in the Mix</HD>
<DH>The all-ages electronic club Twine celebrates sonic
diversity weekly at the AlterKnit Lounge</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HEIDI SIEGMUND CUDA</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In any other town, a night of experimental electronic music might be
an acquired taste, but in a vast L.A. clubland dotted with everything
from death rock clubs on hump night to drag queen karaoke, the
electronic club called Twine, at the Knitting Factory's AlterKnit
Lounge, is an underground hit.</LD>
<LD>   The 21st century digital boys and girls who flock to Twine on
Wednesdays look like parishioners worshiping at the church of
electronica. It's an all-ages scene that celebrates sonic diversity
and can mean anything from DJs like Brooklyn's Joshua Gabriel, who
plays bongos, tweaks the turntables and projects hand-drawn films, to
San Francisco's two-laptops-and-a-microphone Under the Radar, from
the tech-house style of DJ John Tejada to the husband-and-wife team
Mashup Soundsystem.</LD>
<LD>   At the heart of the weekly club is promoter Lynn Hasty, a partner
in the media company Green Galactic, an L.A.-based crew specializing
in getting the word out on underground dance, hip-hop and electronic
music events.</LD>
<TE>   Hasty's commitment to the edge is considerable and consistent,
making Twine one of the area's truly experimental spaces. Like its
predecessor, Public Space, a club Hasty promoted at such venues as
Hollywood Moguls and LACE in the '90s, Twine's purpose is to expand
your musical mind.</TE>
<TE>   The AlterKnit Lounge is an ideal spot for it. A small performance
room tucked away in that vast maze known as the Knitting Factory, the
AlterKnit Lounge is an alternate universe with a cover of only $5,
filled with music heads spreading the word on a grass-roots level.
The Twine scene has a futuristic hippy vibe that goes well with the
Knitting Factory. On any given night, the Hollywood nightclub feels
like a cross between a New York cyber cafe and a punk-rock dance
hall. On Wednesdays, when Twine is added to the mix, you get
everything and the kitchen sink.</TE>
<TE>   With laptops tucked under their arms, Twine devotees connect
global musical dots. Performers and audience members alike turn one
another on to musical happenings in a setting that's so mellow and
cool, even outsiders feel like part of the family. And because it's
at the multi-tasking Knitting Factory, you never know what you'll be
in for. While a rocker crowd checks out Linda Perry on the main
stage, DJ Panic is spinning a mash-up of Nirvana and Destiny's Child
over in Twine. Directly outside Twine, in the bar, two Cholita DJs
throw down some old-school hip-hop.</TE>
<TE>   Although the main stage requires a separate admission, the various
crowds get a chance to mingle with one another and, more than likely,
get turned on to something new.</TE>
<TE>   The beauty really is in the mix. After you've had an earful of
hard-core techno at Twine and gotten the chance to check out a
vintage punk set by a DJ in the bar, you've really had a night on the
town. By the time you take the flier from the rock en espanol kid out
to promote a Pastilla show, you realize: L.A. rocks.*</TE>

Hollywood, Wednesdays, 10 p.m. (323) 466-5141 or

<DH>USC and UCLA tailgaters take to the field (or parking lot)
equipped with plenty of school spirit and more</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY ROMMELMANN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's 105 degrees, and the helicopters overhead blow fiery air over
the SUVs and folding tables and beach chairs set up in front of the
Natural History Museum of L.A. County. Sun umbrellas, pennants and
Mylar balloons whip on a breeze that carries the smell and sizzle of
burgers. Babies are put to sleep on blankets in the shade of trees,
boys toss footballs in high arcs over women setting out platters of
deviled eggs, while their husbands confer around kegs of beer,
deciding the best way to bypass the foam.</LD>
<LD>   If it weren't for the cardinal and gold everywhere, this might
pass for another Labor Day picnic on the lawns and lots surrounding
the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. From bunting to clothing to
cupcake frosting, it's a world painted scarlet and gold.</LD>
<LD>   "They even have their car in SC colors," says a woman, nodding at
a friend's burgundy Explorer, "with a little cardinal and gold--and
of course the USC license plate holder."</LD>
<TE>   While some football fans are content to plunk a bowl of chips near
their elbows and play armchair quarterback, there are those for whom
the game is a participatory sport, one that begins hours if not days
before kickoff; people for whom heat wave or snowstorm are but
factors in packing more or less ice; fans who watch their teams win
and lose on television only if it's run off the car battery.</TE>
<TE>   These are the tailgaters, and they've been waiting for this
day--the opening game between USC and Auburn--since last season. Many
have had the car packed for days, and have been here since sunup for
the 5 p.m. kickoff. Granted, the heat and helicopters don't exactly
say "tailgate," a get-together with more of a wool muffler-mulled
cider vibe.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's the matter of the team. We're not a city exactly
known for cherishing our pro football teams, the Raiders and the Rams
having both departed in 1995. We are, however, very much enamored of
our college teams. And with the huge and historic football rivalry
between USC and UCLA as a subtext, fans swarm the lots and lawns of
the Coliseum and Rose Bowl nearly every weekend through the fall (and
especially for the game between the two teams, this year at the Rose
Bowl, on Nov. 23), in essence defining what qualifies as the L.A.
tailgate experience.</TE>
<TE>   Although it would be tidy to classify USC's fan base as, say,
genteel and UCLA's as gritty, it would not come close to the truth:
Both tailgates feature preppy alumni, drunken underclassmen, pep
squads, statistics nuts and visiting-team fans looking for the
bathrooms. Certainly, one of the hometown veterans will show them, as
tailgates are always bighearted, openhanded affairs, with stories of
lifelong friendships forged, family-team loyalty, and the time the
In-N-Out truck ran out of oil and had to borrow from the fan with the
biggest deep-fryer.</TE>
<TE>   "The allure is the social aspect," says Steve Brown, son of a USC
professor and a USC alumnus who's been tailgating since the mid-'60s.
"Some of these people, we only see during the season. Others," he
says, indicating 30 or so friends milling about half a dozen cars,
"we go on vacation with. And we keep meeting new people and new
fans."</TE>
<TE>   "We come to every home game and at least two away," says Sharon
Stephens of Pacific Palisades. An Alpha Chi Omega "big sister" to
Steve's wife, Sue, Sharon is futzing with the buffet table,
straightening the USC tablecloth, pouring bags of cardinal and gold
tortilla chips. "And she even made little USC flags as centerpieces,"
Sue Brown says.</TE>
<TE>   More important than the school-spirit paraphernalia is the right
parking spot. "The cell phone rang about three times in the car, our
friends frantically asking, 'Where will you be?' " says the Browns'
daughter, Kim, who's snagged a prime spot in the shade on the lawn
just north of the Coliseum. How did she get it?</TE>
<TE>   "You have to make a donation to Cardinal &amp; Gold," says Sue,
referring to a group that supports athletic scholarships. "They give
you a parking pass." Is it possible within her family not to like
football?</TE>
<TE>   "No, not at all," she says. "And she's dating a Notre Dame fan."
She tips her head toward Kim's boyfriend, who's nearby pretending
he's invisible. "He sabotaged the brownies," says Kim, tossing a beer
can onto the grass. "He put 'Notre Dame' where we had the 'SC.' "</TE>
<TE>   Within a minute, a raggedy guy pushing a grocery cart picks up the
can. "One of the nice things is your cans get recycled
automatically," says Steve, as the guy stomps on the can and tosses
it in the cart.</TE>
<TE>   While the privileged few secure grass, shade and a personal
recycler, most USC tailgaters, who number in the thousands, do not.
Being in the middle of the city, a certain coarse urbanity sets both
the aesthetic tone and comfort zone of the USC tailgate experience,
with loci of fans forming wherever there's room. Fraternity boys,
some shirtless and painted red, sprawl against curbs like spent
concertgoers and, whenever cute girls or Auburn supporters pass,
raise their beers and shout, "Trojans rock!" Families eat Popeye's
fried chicken at the feet of the headless statues in front of the
stadium's entrance, and RVs line the many treeless concrete parking
lots in the vicinity. The most intensely crowded tailgate area,
however, is just west of the Coliseum, where several hundred USC and
Auburn fans have camped together in a patch of shade the size of a
tennis court. The scarlet-and-gold sea is here punctuated by orange;
USC and Auburn car blankets overlap; twin girls have their pigtails
secured with orange pompoms; the melting icing of a sheet cake once
spelled "Go Auburn." The competitive spirit is gentle: Fight songs
are sung in tandem, and tiny football-helmet dispensers of bean dip
shared, until an hour before game time, when the tension ratchets up.</TE>
<TE>   "I promise you, Auburn will end up in the top 10 in the country!"
a young Auburn supporter who's flown in from Georgia smugly tells two
USC fans wearing cardinal wigs. "USC will not be in the top 25!"
Wig-boys' retort is drowned out by the 100-plus members of the USC
marching band, singing, "Beat that tiger!" to the boom of the bass
drums and the blare of the tubas.</TE>
<TE>   "War eagle!" shouts an Auburn contingent in response, invoking the
second of the team's mascots. (For naught: USC will go on to beat
Auburn, 24-17.) At 4:40 p.m., kids get their faces wiped off, grills
and coolers are hustled back to cars, and everyone chugs their beers,
which means the lines for the port-o-johns are really long. By 5 p.m.
the street is empty, the ground littered with rib bones and empty
bottles. Although die-hards will come back afterward to have a few
cocktails and relive the game play-by-play, the tailgate is
essentially over. Until the next game ...</TE>
<TE>   "UCLA--Fight! Fight! Fight!" chants a group of UCLA students, who
circle two young women power-chugging from the fat plastic tubes that
emerge from a UCLA megaphone held overhead. How much beer did they
just suck down? "Three," says Melinda Haffey, a blond,
cutoffs-wearing UCLA student who high-fives Michelle Escovar.</TE>
<TE>   "So far, we've drank three 24-packs, but we got a late start,"
says Bryan Lui, who was a cheerleader last year for the Bruins--who
open their season on this day at the Rose Bowl against Colorado
State--but quit because he missed tailgating too much. "That
megaphone," he says, pointing at the beer bong, "was mine from last
year." It's 4 p.m., and Liu and his buddies have been here since noon
for the 7 p.m. kickoff. While there are a few potato chip bags strewn
about, and black smoke puffs from beneath the dome of a
rickety-looking grill, food does not appear to be an essential
ingredient to the success of this tailgating party.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not important as the alcohol," says Dan Bartelson, as a
friend gets his hair spray-painted Bruin blue and gold. "Whip up some
margaritas, Dan," commands Liu.</TE>
<TE>   Bartelson sets a wood box with a hole in the top at his feet. "I
made this after I saw a Jimmy Buffett concert; it's perfect for
tailgating," he says, and yanks the starter cord to the 35cc
weed-whacker motor fitted inside the box; the hole on top whirs to
life. Dan screws on a blender, pours in some tequila, some limeade.
"UCLA--Fight! Fight! Fight!" chant the students, as Bartelson sloshes
the drinks into waiting plastic cups.</TE>
<TE>   "Welcome to the Blue Side!" shouts Liu.</TE>
<TE>   Although the students may well be revisited by their libations
later in the day, at least they'll be on an absorbent surface:
There's nothing but grass to tailgate on at the Rose Bowl, with RVs
and cars parked on pastoral fields as far as the eye can see. "Be
True to Your School" blares from the speakers mounted high above the
Rose Bowl, and onto the honey-wagons lined up around the stadium's
east side, vendors selling burgers and lemonade, barbecue and ice
cream. None of the fare draws as many hungry stares as what's being
cooked up at Darrell Newsome's tailgate. "Ain't nobody do it like the
Bruins do," says Newsome, watching as his buddy Shawn Clark plunges
chicken parts into a stovepipe fryer. "We met at 5 this morning, and
we were here by 10. My little brother is the running back for UCLA;
his name is Manuel White Jr. We try to have a tailgate to the fullest
because we got so many family members out here. We have about 40 now,
later it will be up to about 75."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm also marinating some hot links and ribs," says Clark, holding
up a plastic bag full of sauced meats. "Next week, I'll deep-fry a
turkey." Another friend, Ken Fields, mans the grill. "We got lemon
chicken, we got catfish nuggets, we got Cordon Bleu sandwiches--ham,
grilled chicken breast and Swiss cheese on a Kaiser roll."</TE>
<TE>   "Don't forget about the grilled onions, bell peppers and so on,"
Newsome says. "We got everything, we put the thing on it!" sings
Fields, telling everyone who passes by that they are welcome to eat.
Many take up his offer, spending a few minutes beneath the canopied
tent where a TV is tuned to a pregame show.</TE>
<TE>   "We been out here the last three years doing this. The majority of
us have season passes," Newsome says. "Everywhere the team travels,
we go too. We support them to the fullest. And you're welcome to eat
anything we got. Join in." This spirit of generosity is endemic to
the tailgate; one cannot walk three feet without being offered a
bottle of water, a glass of wine, a place to sit. People do not
appear to do this to top one another, but like a football team, to
see how they can improve on last season.</TE>
<TE>   "We used to do just a blanket and beach chairs and sandwiches,"
says Jeff Hecox, who graduated from UCLA in 1989. "Luckily, I found a
friend who wanted to set the bar a little bit higher." Hecox and Rob
Crawford's structure is a large square tent, its outer walls wrapped
in thick paper emblazoned with photos of UCLA teams and tickets and
great moments. "I had the memorabilia but he did all the printing,"
Hecox says.</TE>
<TE>   The photos are beautiful and evocative: a Deco ticket from 1934,
streams-of-color, Supergraphic-inspired poster from the '70s, Coach
Bob Toledo celebrating a victory by leaping six inches into the air
("The highest he's ever jumped," Hecox says). People cannot help but
stop and spend a few minutes poring over the images. "For any UCLA
fan, this just stirs the emotions and memories," Hecox adds.</TE>
<TE>   "Jeff is a hero among UCLA fans," says Derek Timm. "Everyone comes
by his setup, they stop, they stare, they love what he's done, and
they take pride in having a fan in the class of '89 like this." Hecox
laughs and gives Timm a bear hug, revealing that the back of his
shirt reads, "There's Absolutely Nothing Like Bruins Football."</TE>

<HD>A Few Tips From the 'Commissioner'</HD>
<DH>Joe Cahn has made the outdoor party his life's work</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Rommelmann</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joe Cahn, the self-appointed "Commissioner of Tailgating," was
reached while driving his Monaco motor coach on Interstate 95,
"somewhere between Baltimore and New York," en route to the opening
NFL game between the Giants and San Francisco. "I'm seeing America
and eating my way around the country," says the former New Orleans
cooking school owner, who seven years ago decided to devote himself
to what he calls "the world's largest covered-dish dinner party."</LD>
<LD>   "The first couple of years, I would cook jambalaya," says Cahn,
whose recipes and more can be found on www.tailgating.com. "But I
wanted to see how other people celebrated. Now I park, put out a
little snack food and a sign that says 'Help Yourself,' and walk
around sampling other people's food. I stop and schmooze, go to maybe
10 or 20 parties.</LD>
<LD>   "Tailgating is somewhere between a food festival and a sporting
event. But you don't even have to like football to come out to this
community social."</LD>
<TE>   There are two main theories on the origin of the tailgate,
according to Cahn. One dates it to the very first college football
game between Rutgers and Princeton in 1869, when fans traveled to the
game by carriage, grilling sausages and burgers at the "tail end" of
the horse.</TE>
<TE>   The second says it all began at Yale in 1904. At least that's what
they'll tell you. Is it true? The Yale story has been verified by,
you guessed it ... Yale. As the story goes, there was a train made up
of private railcars bringing fans to a Yale game. By the time the
fans arrived at the stadium, they were hungry and thirsty. So the
idea of bringing a picnic hamper of food was born.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the history, Cahn will log 30,000 miles and tailgate in
47 stadiums this season. He is so fascinated by the demographics of
tailgating, he got a grant to study it.</TE>
<TE>   "We live in an America where we don't talk to our neighbors; we
check our caller ID; if someone knocks at the door at 9 p.m., we
don't open it," he says. "But in the parking lot, we talk to
strangers, we share food with them--and it happens in parking lots
across the country every weekend. Religion and ethnic group are not
factors, nor is age; you have 10-year-olds hanging out with
80-year-olds. This adds to the sociability, and makes tailgating
magical."</TE>
<TE>   Here are Joe Cahn's Top 10 Tips for Successful Tailgating:</TE>
<TE>   1. Dress in team colors. You are the 12th man on the team, so show
your team spirit. Decorate your site with team pennants and other
team stuff.</TE>
<TE>   2. Plan your menu and do prep work a day or two before the game.
Keep the menu simple and pack prepared food in disposable containers.</TE>
<TE>   3. Make a list of the items you want to take along, and check them
off as you pack. Pack paper products (plates, napkins, towels, etc.)
the night before. Remember such items as a small first-aid kit, trash
bags, water and damp towels in plastic bags to clean up.</TE>
<TE>   4. Plan to arrive three to four hours early and stay one to two
hours after the game.</TE>
<TE>   5. Find a good spot to park. Not all parking spaces are created
equal. Park next to a grassy area or at the end of the parking row.
This gives you more room for setting up tables, schmoozing,
rubbernecking. In short, for serious tailgating.</TE>
<TE>   6. Fly a flag on a very high pole so friends can find you.</TE>
<TE>   7. Meet your tailgate neighbors, share food, swap recipes, throw
the football with friends, read the paper.</TE>
<TE>   8. Food should be ready 1 1/2 hours before game time, so there is
plenty of time for those going to the game to eat, clean up and
extinguish fires. (Those not going to the game can pull out the
generator and TV.)</TE>
<TE>   9. Leave the area clean. Begin thinking about food and friends for
the next game.</TE>
<TE>   10. And don't forget ... jumper cables, toilet paper, more trash
bags than you think you need, an extra cooler full of ice, rain gear
or sun block, comfortable shoes, antacid and a friend.</TE>

<HD>A Bruin Fan's First Rule: Maintain Fluidity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF  WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are no hard and fast rules for proper tailgating, but among
true Bruin fans, a few simple ones generally apply.</LD>
<LD>   For starters, tailgating is not really meant for teetotalers.
Sure, you can walk proudly into the stadium without a drop of alcohol
in your veins, but strolling in languidly (if not staggering) after a
few drinks tends to make the first quarter much more
enjoyable--especially based on the team's uneven performances in
recent seasons.</LD>
<LD>   The Rose Bowl, moreover, is a beautiful venue at which to sit
outside enjoying a cold anything, with the mountains providing an
idyllic backdrop--assuming the smog doesn't obscure them--as you
watch the eclectic, attractive crowd file into the stadium.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, my friends and I have distinctly noticed over the years
that the crowd keeps getting younger--the only acceptable explanation
for how we perceive, and are perceived by, all those marauding groups
of sorority girls.</TE>
<TE>   My personal choice of beverage, by the way, is a self-devised
concoction of vodka, lemon-lime soda and lemonade, with Triple Sec
and a splash of orange juice--perfect before noon, preceding a 12:30
p.m. kickoff. This libation alone has more than once provided me with
the fortitude necessary to enter the Coliseum for the UCLA-USC game,
knowing full well that I will be subjected to 3 1/2 hours of the
dreaded, droning Trojan band playing "Conquest" and "Fight On"
without interruption.</TE>
<TE>   Bringing food is a good idea too, although the planning that goes
into meals outside the Rose Bowl can be somewhat jarring--especially
seeing folks lay out elaborate spreads complete with tablecloths and
wineglasses.</TE>
<TE>   Those of us who prefer grabbing sandwiches from Bristol Farms or
the local deli would like to remind our fellow ticket-holders that
they are attending a football game, not the Hollywood Bowl. Besides,
overdressing for casual occasions is traditionally a Trojan trait.</TE>
<TE>   One more thing to remember: No matter how good your tailgate party
is, memories of the day will be poor ones if your team goes out and
stinks up the field. Of course, if you've done a proper job of
tailgating, it does tend to dull the impact of a subpar performance
without missing out on the fun of being there. As for being
clearheaded enough to savor every play, well, isn't that why they
invented VCRs and TiVo?</TE>

<HD>Trojan Tailgating Gets a Little Too Comfy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SACHS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a half-hour until kickoff, and for me and my party of USC
football fans, the inevitable could be put off no longer: It was time
for the tailgate party to end. Sure, the game's the thing. But dining
and dallying among several thousand of your like-minded friends is a
sublime way to let the anticipation build.</LD>
<LD>   In my group's early years, leaving Exposition Park and following
the thundering herd of Cardinal-and-Gold-clad faithful into the
Coliseum was a snap: Toss the fast-food trash, fold up the blankets
and head for the game.</LD>
<LD>   But as the seasons went by, the trappings became more elaborate.
Picnic baskets and lawn chairs appeared. Then came folding tables,
real dishes and even a portable grill for the tri-tip. After some
games, the tailgate feast turned out to be more memorable than the
final score. But on this particular Saturday afternoon, the gradual
evolution for these fans had taken a prodigious leap into luxury, or
more specifically, into a 30-foot, fully equipped RV.</LD>
<TE>   In the great tailgating hierarchy, we had finally arrived. (For
one day, at any rate--the RV was rented.) But for one member of our
party, leaving the comfort of his plush new surroundings was almost
painful to consider. Finally, looking down at his end-zone ticket and
then back again at the gleaming RV, he came to a decision: "I think
I'm going to watch the game here," he told the rest of us, motioning
to the TV set inside the vehicle. "I'll see you all after the game."
Another blissed-out victim of the seductive charms of tailgating,
Coliseum-style.</TE>
<TE>   Although powers-that-be in the pro football world would have you
believe that the classic stadium and its environs should be plowed
under to make way for a sprawling new venue, Trojan fans know better.
The Coliseum's open-end, peristyle design allows the very history of
the grand old place to pour out toward Figueroa Street, flooding the
adjacent green expanse of Exposition Park with a sense of tradition
and permanence few stadiums can match.</TE>
<TE>   When you see tailgaters from across the country setting up their
spread on concrete parking lots, or on frozen tundra, or in the
shadow of a grotesquely anonymous new stadium, you can only smile.
They may never know what they're missing.</TE>
<TE>   But beware the upward spiral of the tailgating evolution. You just
might find yourself on the inside looking out.</TE>

<HD>New Moonshadows Rising on Malibu Shore</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>S. IRENE VIRBILA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the beach, gray skies that hung on for what seemed months haven't
made it an ideal summer. A Santa Monica friend laments her tomatoes
are way behind schedule this year. I don't get to the beach often
enough to have really noticed the drawbacks of this particular
summer. But recently, I finally made it to Malibu, to see what new
owners and a new executive chef have done with that 30-year-old
Malibu institution, Moonshadows.</LD>
<LD>   On a beautiful, balmy night, the narrow strip of parking lot
looked like an SUV dealer's outdoor showroom, but inside, I found
only a handful of people enjoying a quiet dinner at tables by the
window. In the aquarium that divides the host's station from the bar,
gaily striped fish swim laps around living coral.</LD>
<LD>   "Inside or out?" asks the sultry hostess. I turned to the friend
I'd brought along, a familiar of Moonshadows in the old days--well,
more like the old old days--when he lived four doors down from the
restaurant and bar.</LD>
<TE>   Definitely, outside, he indicates. A long narrow deck set just
above the crashing waves has been refurbished and extended to create
what's now called the Blue Lounge. White wooden booths that seat
four, or even six, march along one side. But the primo seats are on
the new rolling "chaises" perched at the very edge of the deck.
Carved wood, they look vaguely Southeast Asian and are outfitted with
floppy navy cushions, the better to sprawl as you watch the waves
come rolling in. Settle in for drinks, or even dinner, though the
coffee tables seem awfully small for dining.</TE>
<TE>   To start, order up a dozen hama hamas on the half shell, or a bowl
of the incongruous, but delicious New England clam chowder laced with
tender clams or a puree of corn soup. There's a skillful chilled
lobster salad with fresh English peas and asparagus in a lemon
vinaigrette or a skewer of grilled jumbo cilantro shrimp with a
salty-hot Thai chili sauce.</TE>
<TE>   The smart, beachside menu comes from Moonshadows' new chef, Deidra
Henry, who worked at Gramercy Tavern in Manhattan. Her main courses
include seared Florida snapper in shallot caper sauce, roasted
organic free-range chicken in herb butter and several decent steaks.</TE>
<TE>   The old Moonshadows this is not. Lulled by the waves and the dark,
I could have easily fallen asleep on one of those blue chaises (which
are really more like sofa beds), but it was time to get back.</TE>
<TE>   Just before 10, more people were arriving, sliding into one of
those booths for drinks and a snack or even a late-night dinner. (On
the weekends there's a DJ.)</TE>
<TE>   I asked Tyrone, "You really used to live four doors down?" Yeah,
he did.</TE>

<HD>'Family' CD Puts Them to Sleep</HD>
<DH>'Golden Slumber,' lullabies from Dave Koz and his
smooth-jazz collaborators, is the first release on his new record
label.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNNE HEFFLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saxophonist Dave Koz, one of smooth jazz's top headliners, is
reaching out to a new audience. Really new. We're talking babies.</LD>
<LD>   Koz, who co-hosts the morning drive-time show on the "Wave"
(KTWV-FM 94.7), hosts his own syndicated radio show and has a string
of hit singles and gold albums, is now in the rock-a-bye-baby
business. His "Golden Slumbers: A Father's Lullaby" album, is the
debut of Koz's record label, Rendezvous Entertainment, associated
with the jazz division of Warner Bros. Records.</LD>
<LD>   A friends-and-family affair, the sweet and tender CD--it's "like a
sacred sound between a father and a baby," said Koz--features a
stellar list of smooth-jazz talent, including pianist David Benoit,
trumpeter Rick Braun, guitarists Norman Brown and Peter White,
keyboardist Bryan Culbertson and Koz's brother, jazz guitarist Jeff
Koz, whose wife, Unique, suggested the project.</LD>
<TE>   Inspired by the birth of Jeff's first daughter, Jordan, it was "a
labor of love," Dave Koz said. "That's where it came from first. My
sister-in-law was looking for some quality lullaby music and most of
the stuff that she found didn't quite work."</TE>
<TE>   "Ninety-nine percent were vocal songs," Jeff Koz explained. "Every
time the singer came in, our daughter would pop her head up--she was
attracted to the human voice."</TE>
<TE>   "My brother and I have been making music together for years," Dave
Koz said. "This was fun for us, because it wasn't about making
records or showing how much chops you have on your instrument; it was
to make music that would soothe this little new baby."</TE>
<TE>   That intimate family affair gradually expanded to include plans
for future albums, books and a Web site (www.goldenslumbers.com)
featuring a monthly forum with child-development specialists and
pediatricians.</TE>
<TE>   The "father's lullaby" theme emerged as the artists chose songs
with their own families in mind. Their personal dedications, included
in the album's liner notes, increased over the three years that it
took to put the album together.</TE>
<TE>   During that time, the birth of Jeff's second daughter inspired the
brothers to write "Lullaby for Isabella," White wrote "Charlotte's
Song" for his recently adopted daughter and guitarist Bruce Watson
arranged and performed the traditional "Hush Little Baby" and "Afro
Cuban Lullaby" for his new baby.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a double kind of snuggle factor," Jeff Koz said, "because
it was inspired by their relationship with their child. And it was
music where less is more, so each artist's contribution was very
beautiful and evocative and personal."</TE>
<TE>   The CD's tracks are "old, new and unexpected," said Dave Koz. "The
unexpected ones are like the title track, 'Golden Slumbers,' by the
Beatles--it's not a lullaby, but when you slow it down it really
works--and the James Taylor song 'You Can Close Your Eyes.' "</TE>
<TE>   Braun performed "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" because his mother,
who had recently died, used to sing it to him. "When You Wish Upon a
Star" was Benoit's sentimental childhood favorite. Benoit, who
volunteers with the Mr. Holland's Opus Foundation and who founded the
Asia America Youth Honor Orchestra in Palos Verdes, was looking
forward to the finished CD to "officially try it out" on his
2-year-old.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of us are involved with kid stuff because I think we're all
kind of kids at heart anyway," said Dave Koz, who serves as a global
ambassador for the Starlight Foundation, while brother Jeff is
involved with the L.A.-based Inner-City Filmmakers, both
youth-oriented charities.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't jazz musicians when we were in the studio," he added.
"We were parents and uncles and family members making these little
love melodies."</TE>
<TE>   The Kozes have dedicated the album to their late father, who, with
their mother, encouraged the sons to explore their passions.</TE>
<TE>   "When I picked up the sax," Dave Koz said, "they were very
supportive. When my dad bought me my first saxophone, it was probably
one of the happiest days of my life."</TE>

<LD>The actress who stars in the sitcom "Grounded for Life" on Fox also
has appeared on "Lateline," "Quantum Leap" and "The Drew Carey Show."</LD>
<LD>   There's No 7-Eleven Here!: I just had my first wedding
anniversary. Since my husband is a doctor, we are not able to go on
vacation very often with an actress and a doctor living together. But
recently, we went to Catalina and took the Island Express Helicopter.
I was so terrified before we got on this thing, but it turned out to
be amazing. You just float over the sea.</LD>
<LD>   We decided that we were going to camp for a couple of days. We
didn't know that there wasn't going to be any shop on the backside of
the island where we were camping. We didn't bring even close to
enough food or water or anything. And we were in this campground that
was just dirt. So, we pitched our tent and laid out the sleeping bag
and then we basically arm-wrestled over the last Clif bar and a
couple of pieces of candy. There's nothing much on the island, but
there are buffalo. That blew my mind. You only see them in old
westerns and Kevin Costner movies.</LD>
<TE>   The Trip Improves: For the second leg of our trip, we stayed in a
little bed-and-breakfast in Avalon called the Snug Harbor Inn and
there are only six rooms. They had a shower! Otherwise, the arcade in
Avalon has great Skee-Ball, and Armstrong's Seafood Restaurant has
the best ceviche. We just read books and did nothing. It is such a
relaxed island. All the people are so nice, and there is really
nothing to rush to.</TE>
<TE>   Essential Ingredients: We always cook on the weekends because my
husband is an amazing cook, and I'm a pretty good cook. He cooks the
best homemade pasta with the full-on crank machine. He also loves to
make that Thai coconut soup, tom kha kai, or anything with coconut.
That makes him go over the moon. And for me, it's anything with
truffle oil. I could put truffle oil on socks and it would be good.
Usually, I put it on heirloom tomatoes that we grow in our backyard
and then a little bit of sea salt and a little bit of truffle oil.</TE>
<TE>   Unhurried Pace: I love all the beach towns. They don't really have
a vision of the future or a vision of the past. They're just about
right now. It's a nice way to escape and not worry about what's going
to happen tomorrow or your skin damage from the sun. Hermosa and
Redondo Beach are my favorites. I love to go to play tennis and then
go to the Kettle in Manhattan Beach, which is the best breakfast
place with horribly unhealthy food, but after you play tennis you
feel kind of OK about it. Redondo has the most beautiful beach
restaurant, Chez Melange.</TE>
<TE>   Fish and Guilt: Fishing is my new thing. My husband is a
fly-fisherman. For him, I organized this little trip to Lake Piru.
But I realized along the way that I love fishing. We decided on our
first fishing trip that we were going to club other people over the
head and steal their fish because we hadn't caught anything. But then
we finally caught six trout in Lake Piru. When we were in Mexico on
our honeymoon, I caught this gigantic dorado, which is like a
mahi-mahi. I was reeling him in for 45 minutes. And when I pulled him
out of the water, I felt horrible. I thought, "This is a creature."
But when you catch trout, there is no remorse. Trout are a little
easier for me to stomach than catching big sport fish. I think sport
fish are kind of sad.</TE>

<AU>F. KATHLEEN FOLEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Furious Theatre Company, an up-and-coming group that has recently
staged two well-regarded U.S. premieres, tests its creative mettle on
a classic in "The Playboy of the Western World" at the Armory
Northwest in Pasadena.</LD>
<LD>   It's hard to believe that John Millington Synge's fiercely poetic
comedy occasioned riots when first produced by the Abbey Theatre in
1907. The play, about a wandering Irish lad whose proclaimed act of
patricide makes him a popular hero in a rural County Mayo community,
outraged Dubliners of the day, who found Synge's earthy, feckless
peasant characters unacceptably coarse, a violation of the
sentimental folk archetypes they held dear.</LD>
<LD>   Under the direction of Damaso Rodriguez, this "Playboy" traverses
the familiar terrain of Synge's masterpiece with earthiness and
lyricism intact. This is a rock-solid, even occasionally inspired
staging, marred only by slow-starting performances in a couple of
critical roles.</LD>
<TE>   The play's provenance and period are perfectly re-created--no mean
feat for an American company not accustomed to the quicksilver
cadences of the Irish tongue. The appealing cast's impeccable accents
lend authenticity to the proceedings, as does the beautifully
realized set by Shawn Lee and Melissa Teoh, two talented designers
whose work bears watching. Teoh also did the impressive period
costumes, Vonessa Martin the superlative sound, and Christie Wright
the effective lighting. Hair and makeup stylist Christa McCarthy
makes the actors look convincingly scruffy, as if they had dug a few
potatoes and trotted through a few bogs before convening in this
modest rural pub.</TE>
<TE>   That pub, owned by the boozy Michael James (Robert Harlan Greene)
and presided over by his young and feisty daughter, Pegeen Mike (Sara
Hennessy), is the unlikely setting for mystery, romance, high drama
and low comedy--all part and parcel of Synge's bittersweet romp. When
Christy Mahon (Brad Price), a befuddled wayfarer, staggers into the
pub with the story of how he murdered his abusive father with a
shovel, the locals embrace him as their favorite son, marveling at
his daring.</TE>
<TE>   Prickly Pegeen Mike falls for Christy in short order, openly vying
for his affections against the likes of the Widow Quin (effectively
sultry Laura Russell), a scheming mantrap who wants Christy for her
own. The tone of the play is pitch perfect--almost. Effective in the
play's wrenching conclusion, Hennessy and Price are a bit anemic in
their early scenes, seldom conveying the full-bodied longing under
their characters' artless inexperience. Matthew Henerson is an
unalloyed delight as Christy's boozy father, a raucous, filthy
crowd-pleaser who takes the action to manic new heights whenever he's
on stage.</TE>

<HD>Chris Potter Practices Saxophone Wizardry at Bakery</HD>
<DH>At 31, the musician plays with magisterial authority, and
his accompanists are up to the challenge.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chris Potter is one of the most highly praised young saxophonists to
arrive on the jazz scene in recent years. And with good cause. Since
recording his first album as a leader a decade ago, the 31-year-old
South Carolinian has worked in a far-ranging series of musical
environments, including gigs with Dave Douglas, Dave Holland, the
Mingus Big Band, Ray Brown, Larry Carlton and Steely Dan.</LD>
<LD>   In 2000 he was the youngest musician ever to receive the
prestigious $26,500 Danish Jazzpar Prize.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, Potter opened a six-night run at the Jazz Bakery
leading a virtual all-star ensemble of similarly well-regarded young
players: pianist Kevin Hays, bassist Scott Colley and drummer Bill
Stewart.</LD>
<TE>   In past local appearances, his principal attributes have been
centered in his great versatility--a capacity to find creative
avenues of expression in genres stretching from straight-ahead jazz
to edgy, avant-garde sounds. At the Bakery, however, he primarily
focused upon originals such as "Migrations" and "Any Moment Now" from
his just-released Verve CD, "Traveling Mercies."</TE>
<TE>   In the peak moments of his performance--a stunning soprano
saxophone cadenza, brilliantly controlled and executed fast-note
passages, the engaging warmth of his tone--it was easy to understand
the acclaim Potter has received. A magisterial-looking figure despite
his relative youth, he fully controlled center stage when he was
playing, chest thrust forward, arms held out in positions of power,
playing his saxophones with an utter sense of physical and musical
mastery.</TE>
<TE>   His musical companions were fully up to Potter's performance
level. Hays was a bit too busy at times, but there was no disputing
his quest for new ideas as he occasionally reached inside the piano
to add plucked string accents to his keyboard efforts. Colley, as
always, was both a consummate accompanist and a probing soloist. And
Stewart, who has appeared frequently enough at the Bakery recently to
be viewed as one of the venue's house drummers, characteristically
operated in pure rhythmic synchronization with the other players.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the relative absence of the sort of musically
shape-shifting adventurousness of some past appearances, Potter fully
affirmed his ascension to the upper levels of the jazz arts. And it
was interesting to note that the near-capacity audience seemed to
consist primarily of listeners in his age range, underscoring the
scope and reach of his career potential.</TE>

<HD>Negativland Finds Its Muse at the Auto Wrecking Yard</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For more than 20 years, Negativland has earned renown for
manipulation of both tape and media.</LD>
<LD>   A 1989 news release by the audio-visual art collective falsely
claimed that a Minnesota teen who killed his family had cited
Negativland's provocative track "Christianity Is Stupid" as
inspiration. The "news" was reported as fact by several print and
electronic outlets, proving the group's underlying point about media
unreliability.</LD>
<LD>   Two years later, the Bay Area-originated group released a single
featuring chopped-up and rearranged bits of U2's "I Still Haven't
Found What I'm Looking For" mixed with purloined outtakes of an
expletive-laced rant by radio and TV personality Casey Kasem. That
spurred protracted and costly legal action by both U2's label, Island
Records, and Kasem, while also putting the group front and center in
the debate over copyright and fair-use issues.</LD>
<TE>   All of its albums, its weekly radio show on Berkeley's KPFA-FM and
the various publications and projects carried out on the Web site
www.negativland.com are rife with tape-splicing, topical high jinks
and surreal satire that incisively stand pop and corporate cultures
on their heads with equal parts Stockhausen, Chomsky and Firesign
Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   So, when Negativland started showing friends and fans its latest
project, a book and CD revolving around letters, notes and other
written material found in vehicles at a wrecking yard, the group got
some puzzled reactions.</TE>
<TE>   "The first friend who saw it said, 'Where's the joke? Where's the
hoax?' " says Mark Hosler, one of Negativland's five members. "The
joke is there is no joke."</TE>
<TE>   Nor is there any hoax involved. "Deathsentences of the Polished
and Structurally Weak," which was released earlier this week on the
group's Seeland label, is uncharacteristically straightforward, and
quite moving.</TE>
<TE>   In the book, packaged as an auto owner's manual and maintenance
log, each found document is shown on a left-hand page, with a photo
of the demolished car it came from on the facing page.</TE>
<TE>   "Dead Daddy, I Love you. Michelle" is scrawled in crayon on a
magazine insert card, a rainbow and three red hearts added. On the
right-hand page is a red minivan, its front end smashed and twisted.</TE>
<TE>   A young woman's letter to a friend chronicles her tortured life,
with the facing page a photo of a red car that appears to have been
in a brutal head-on collision. Another is a certificate of completion
of a drug-and-alcohol rehab program, with the accompanying photo
showing the trunk of the car littered with beer cans and bottles.</TE>
<TE>   There's nothing to indicate the fate of the people in the autos,
or whether they were the writers or recipients of the missives,
although the states of the cars imply tragedy. The eerie,
heartbreaking aura is enhanced by the audio on the companion CD, an
ambient soundscape that evokes metal impacting metal in slow motion.</TE>
<TE>   Hosler says it was that emotional aspect that drew Negativland to
the material, which originated with group member Richard Lyons' trips
to a wrecking yard to scavenge car parts. Lyons made 10 or 15 copies
of a small book of retrieved materials and gave them to friends. Two
years ago, Ira Glass, host of the public-radio show "This American
Life," heard about it through a mutual friend and asked Lyons to do a
spoken essay about his finds.</TE>
<TE>   "The reaction to that was so strong, and from people clearly not
our normal audience," says Hosler, who now lives in Olympia, Wash.
"And that made us think, 'Wow, this is good. It's evoking a wide
range of reactions, seems to be really compelling. Maybe we should
expand it into a real project."</TE>
<TE>   Initially, the group approached it much as it had such works as
the 1997 album "Dispepsi," which tackled the topic of advertising
with both audio and cover graphics taken from or parodying PepsiCo
campaigns. But the usual approach proved inappropriate for
"Deathsentences."</TE>
<TE>   "We kept doing the things we do in other Negativland projects--add
funny stuff and layers and explanations," says Hosler. "And
everything we tried didn't work. And the more we worked on it, the
answer became, 'Get Negativland out of the way and let it speak for
itself.' "</TE>
<TE>   The change in tactics turned out to be particularly satisfying,
given that the group's collage style has lost some of its novel edge
over the years, becoming commonplace both in professional media and
among the public with cut-and-paste techniques accessible to anyone
with a computer.</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly, what the members of Negativland find themselves
speaking for are the copyright issues implicitly challenged by their
work. They've become the center of a community of artists working
with sound collage for similar aims, including Canadian
"Plunderphonics" artist John Oswald, the group the Tape-beatles and
English DJ Vicki Bennett (a.k.a. People Like Us).</TE>
<TE>   They're also in demand in academic and legal circles as experts on
intellectual property matters. Hosler says he actually makes most of
his income now as an invited speaker at symposiums and seminars.
"Issues of fair use, what is property, what is the culture and who
owns it have become a lively debate since the arrival of Napster," he
says, likening Negativland's activities in the field to the tactics
of the environmental militants in Earth First!</TE>
<TE>   "Negativland is more interested in staying on the outside and
lobbing our little mind bombs over the fence. Even though we're
clearly associated with the issues, I don't want to turn into a
lobbyist. We don't want to go in there and stay there--partly because
it's more fun out here."</TE>

<KH>The Fall Season</KH>
<HD>Overcooked, Underplayed</HD>
<DH>'Good Morning, Miami' is an exercise in comedic excess,
while 'Without a Trace' is stern almost to the point of stoniness.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOWARD ROSENBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's not what you are but what precedes you that often determines
success or failure in prime time. In that regard, powerhouse lead-ins
are expected to benefit two fall series that premiere tonight.</LD>
<LD>   Following a popular show can be a mixed blessing, with high
expectations looming like a guillotine. "Will &amp; Grace" surely will
deliver a large, primed-to-laugh audience to "Good Morning, Miami,"
for example, putting pressure on the comedy newcomer to retain enough
of those viewers to ensure its own future in a Thursday night lineup
that annually has NBC strutting, well, like a peacock. In this crowd,
having respectable ratings may not suffice.</LD>
<LD>   And on CBS, how much of "CSI's" usually epic audience will
"Without a Trace" hold? If there's a large drop-off against NBC's
highly charismatic "ER," the new crime series may face its own
disappearance.</LD>
<TE>   Although only moderately distinctive, both new shows deserve time
to evolve.</TE>
<TE>   When Jake Silver (Mark Feuerstein) jets in with thoughts of
becoming executive producer of a viewer-starved local TV show titled
"Good Morning, Miami," he finds chaos and complete disaster, starting
with wimpy station manager Frank Alfano (Jere Burns). What's more,
the show's in a creative rut, and its narcissistic cohosts are
feuding.</TE>
<TE>   One of them is washed-up network personality Gavin Stone (Matt
Letscher), the other Lucia Rojas-Klein (Tessie Santiago), a
Charoesque Latina who dolls up like a hooker. In addition, Sister
Brenda (Brooke Dillman), the show's outspoken weathercasting nun,
habitually thanks the "big guy" for sunny skies.</TE>
<TE>   This is sitcomdom, remember, meaning that Jake signs on anyway. He
takes up residence with his lusty grandmother, Claire (Suzanne
Pleshette), who is no typical granny.</TE>
<TE>   Why would such a solid citizen even consider taking this
cockamamie job? Try perky station hairdresser Dylan (Ashley
Williams), who at first sight launches Jake's libido into orbit,
although he learns later that she's Stone's girlfriend.</TE>
<TE>   Delivered by "Will &amp; Grace" creators David Kohan and Max
Mutchnick, "Good Morning, Miami" is occasionally funny while broad,
crude, gratuitously sexual and plump with stereotypes. They range
from the puffed-up, egotistical Stone to spitfire Rojas-Klein, who in
a coming episode mocks the cliches that define her character.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sorry, I cannot control myself," she apologizes in her thick
accent after blowing up at Jake. "With the Latinas, you get the saucy
sex appeal, but you also get the fiery, unpredictable passion."</TE>
<TE>   "Why couldn't you be Swiss?" he groans.</TE>
<TE>   It's that level of sharp dialogue that almost makes up for these
characters being overcooked to a crisp (except for Jake), Sister
Brenda's grating presence and Claire's raunchy wisecracks.</TE>
<TE>   "Without a Trace" is as under the top as "Good Morning, Miami" is
over it.</TE>
<TE>   The stoniness of that good actor Anthony LaPaglia, as missing
persons maven Jack Malone, sets a stern tone for a premiere that
introduces a team of FBI agents who specialize in creating
psychological profiles that help them track down the disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   This is nothing to build a night around. Yet the cast is good,
action is crisp, flashbacks are seamlessly interwoven and dialogue is
terse and effective as Malone and his team reconstruct the activities
of missing marketing executive Maggie Cartright, who is recalled
differently by her family, friends and colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   Agent Samantha Spade (Poppy Montgomery): "It may not mean
anything."</TE>
<TE>   Malone: "But it could mean everything."</TE>
<TE>   There's some nice competitive interplay here between young agents
Danny Taylor (Enrique Murciano) and Martin Fitzgerald (Eric Close),
and a glimmer of erotica when Spade briefly touches Malone's
shoulders. But he lets us know he's married, and that she has a
boyfriend. So enough of that. Maybe.</TE>
<TE>   Malone is one of those know-it-all sleuths who sees and hears what
mortals don't. "This is a very lonely girl, I think," he says about
the victim, 51 hours into the case. That's his overbearing side. He's
also refreshingly underplayed by LaPaglia, and you have the feeling
that if he smiled, his face would crack like Humpty Dumpty.</TE>
<TE>   LaPaglia, Montgomery and Marianne Jean-Baptiste (as investigator
Vivian Johnson) have done more significant work in meatier roles that
demanded more of them. But "Without a Trace" offers up a nice little
mystery in its opener, even though that effort is marred by a cheap
ending.</TE>
<TE>   It may not mean anything. But it could mean everything.</TE>
<TE>   "Good Morning, Miami" will be shown at 9:30 p.m. Thursdays on NBC.
The network has rated it TV-PG (may be unsuitable for young
children).</TE>
<TE>   "Without a Trace" will be shown at 10 p.m. Thursdays on CBS. The
network has rated it TV-PGV (may be unsuitable for young children,
with an advisory for violence).</TE>

<LD>   The Lover and The Collection --Harold Pinter's "The Collection"
and "The Lover" were first presented on television in 1961 and 1963,
respectively, before they were converted into short stage plays.
Detailing sexual role-playing and power games, with plenty of
Pinter's early sense of mystery lurking in the corners, they were
televised in England when most of America was watching TV westerns
and "The Beverly Hillbillies." "The Lover" depicts a proper English
suburban home in which the wife (Susan Priver) has scheduled
afternoon sessions with a lover. We quickly realize, however, that
the "lover," Max (Henry Olek), is really the husband, and that he's
increasingly restive in the role. "The Collection" is about two
couples whose boundaries are temporarily porous, as one man accuses
another of sleeping with his wife, much to the consternation of the
alleged seducer's older gay lover and mentor. In the Fridays and
Sundays cast, David Purdham and Brian Foyster are excellent as the
snide older man and his suggestive, androgynous housemate. Colin
McCabe and Yvette Brooks are somewhat less successful as the
aggrieved husband and manipulative wife.</LD>

<LD>DVD</LD>
<LD>   Barbie as Rapunzel. Artisan's Family Home Entertainment/Matell
Entertainment. DVD and VHS: $19.98. www.barbie.com</LD>
<LD>   Sure, the store shelves will be loaded with all kinds of
merchandise related to this lavish, computer-animated fairy tale--all
those Rapunzel Barbies, fancy dresses, the rose-covered carriage, the
cute purple dragon sidekick....</LD>
<TE>   But there's much more going on in this Oct. 3 release than a big
fat marketing opportunity. It's simply terrific storytelling.</TE>
<TE>   If Rapunzel's hair moves as one piece and her bunny pal's fur
doesn't fluff, the artwork is gorgeously rendered and the characters
are quirkily brought to life through the multilayered story and voice
talent headed by Anjelica Huston as Rapunzel's evil guardian, Gothel.</TE>
<TE>   An artist, sweet and spunky Rapunzel uses a magic brush to escape
her tower prison. She falls for a prince and saves a dragon's life.
Meanwhile, the prince's dad has been feuding for years with a
neighboring king. Could wicked Gothel be involved? And who are
Rapunzel's real parents?</TE>
<TE>   The super DVD bonus features are another surprise: "Dress-Up
Rapunzel" is what you might expect. "Rapunzel's Art Gallery,"
however, is a genuinely interesting tour of paintings by famous
artists. A 26-minute documentary, "The Artist in Me," celebrating
self-expression through art, is fine enough to be a stand-alone
feature. It profiles 19-year-old artist Amanda Dunbar, and other
women artists and crackles with the enthusiasm of children, mostly
girls, as they create their own art.</TE>

<LD>   Something Old: Viewers Pick 'Frasier' and 'Blue'</LD>
<LD>   For all the focus on new programs, two series kicking off 10th
seasons won their time periods Tuesday night, as NBC's "Frasier"
attracted its biggest audience in nearly two years--helping the new
sitcom "Hidden Hills" get off to a solid start--while ABC's "NYPD
Blue" ranked first at 10 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   ABC's John Ritter comedy "8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage
Daughter," meanwhile, dropped 25%--or by 4.5 million viewers--from
its lofty premiere numbers but still fared reasonably well, finishing
second in its slot (behind the season premiere of CBS' "JAG") with
12.8 million estimated viewers.</TE>
<TE>   Featuring the marriage of Niles and Daphne, "Frasier," attracted
more than 21 million viewers, with the audience dropping a
respectable 25% for "Hidden Hills." NBC's "In-Laws" also premiered to
modest tune-in. "Blue" averaged 13.2 million viewers, edging a
preview of CBS' new medical drama "Presidio Med."</TE>

<TE>   Barnes Petitions to Move Out of Suburbs</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for Philadelphia's cash-strapped Barnes Foundation have
asked a court for permission to move its world-renowned collection of
Cezannes, Picassos, Renoirs and Van Goghs from the suburbs of
Philadelphia to the city.</TE>
<TE>   The move will attract more patrons and shore up its shaky
finances, the group maintains.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation is projected to run an $800,000 deficit this year
and has less than $1 million in cash reserves. The
multibillion-dollar collection, containing more than 9,000 pieces,
has been handicapped financially by zoning regulations that limit the
museum to 400 visitors a day, three days a week.</TE>
<TE>   The Pew Charitable Trusts and the Lenfest Foundation have promised
to help the Barnes raise $150 million to construct a new building in
Philadelphia and establish a substantial endowment, but such
assistance is contingent on court approval of the move, because
Albert C. Barnes' will forbids removal of the paintings from the
present site.</TE>
<TE>   Stretton Resigns as Royal Ballet Director</TE>
<TE>   Only 13 months into his three-year contract, Ross Stretton
resigned Wednesday as director of Britain's prestigious Royal Ballet.</TE>
<TE>   Stretton, 50, is the former director of the Australian Ballet and
former assistant director of the American Ballet Theatre, where he
was a principal dancer. His sudden departure comes on the heels of
disagreements with dancers over his management style and negotiations
to resolve casting issues.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though I have enormous respect for the great heritage of
this company, my interest lies primarily in developing the future of
ballet, and that is what I want to spend my time doing," Stretton
said.</TE>
<TE>   Until a new director is appointed, Monica Mason, the assistant
director, will lead the company.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Barbra Streisand will sing nine songs at a Sunday benefit for the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee at the Kodak Theatre in
Hollywood. Barry Manilow and comedian Steve Harvey will also
perform.... Tom Hanks will again team with director Robert Zemeckis
("Forrest Gump," "Cast Away") on "Polar Express," playing a conductor
on a magical train taking a boy to visit Santa Claus....  Ben Stiller
and Owen Wilson will star in a feature film version of the TV series
"Starsky and Hutch" for Warner Bros.</TE>

<LD>* Ryan Adams, "Demolition," Lost Highway. For this album, Adams took
the best 13 songs from the four albums he had on the shelf and has
made his most immediately appealing and consistent album so far.
Where his two earlier solo albums tended to focus on specific sides
of his music, this celebrates all of them, and makes him seem more
interesting and human in the process. The music benefits from the
intimate nature of the recordings, which are little more than the
demo tapes an artist makes before going into the studio and putting
on the final polish. Adams, nominated by many critics and fellow
musicians last year as the young singer-songwriter of the day, has
never sounded so free vocally or more consistently heartfelt as a
writer.</LD>

<LD>* New this week: Even though "Enigma" has a plot almost as hard to
crack as the Nazi coding device that gives this World War II thriller
its name, it is such grand, romantic entertainment that it sweeps the
viewer along in its swiftly escalating suspense. More unpredictable
than it first seems, "Enigma" crackles with Michael Apted's vigorous,
perceptive direction from a superior script by Tom Stoppard based on
the 1995 Robert Harris bestseller. A complex, meticulous period
re-creation down to the tiniest detail, this handsome production
suggests that there may have been a Nazi spy at Britain's Bletchley
Park, where code-breakers toiled in top secrecy. With Dougray Scott,
Kate Winslet, Saffron Burrows and Jeremy Northam.</LD>

<LD>"I want it never to have happened, but it did."</LD>
<LD>   Thus begins Artie Van Why's "That Day in September," now playing a
limited engagement at the Celebration Theatre. This recounting of
what one American encountered on Sept. 11, while equivocal as
theater, commands unalloyed admiration for its dedication to
chronicling the terrorist attacks from firsthand experience.</LD>
<LD>   One reason is its appealing chronicler, the sort of fellow whom
mothers pray their daughters (or sons) will bring home. His piece,
developed after the outpouring of reactions to his cathartic Internet
accounts, is spare in performance, most closely resembling the
heartfelt sharing associated with 12-step meetings.</LD>
<TE>   Under Richard Masur's direction, which mainly entails adroit
lighting cues and letting the material do the rest, Van Why simply
speaks his truth, reading the text from a music stand with
unvarnished directness.</TE>
<TE>   The trajectory moves back and forth across time in semilinear
manner. Van Why charts his Maryland roots, collegiate acting
aspirations and realization of same-sex orientation, migration to
Manhattan and departure from show business to work for a law firm.
Then, in June 2001, his office moved to a downtown site across from
the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   Van Why's recollections of the attacks and their aftermath are
harrowing, marked by an eyewitness perspective that has the sober
authenticity of diary entries. If anything qualifies the proceedings,
it is that these descriptions overshadow the narrative line, which
follows his traumatized process toward generating this show, ending
with his ongoing daily goal: "I will not forget to live."</TE>
<TE>   To apply conventional theatrical criteria to such a document
misses the point and dishonors the purpose. Countless heroes emerged
from the chaos of Sept. 11, and by selflessly sharing his story, Van
Why must be counted among their number.</TE>

<LD>"They don't make them like they used to" is a fairly common complaint
among moviegoers of all ages. In the case of grand wide-screen epics,
it's actually true. Beginning tonight, the American Cinematheque's
3rd Great Big 70mm Festival looks to bring back those days of
outsized movies, if only for the weekend.</LD>
<LD>   From 1955 to 1970 some 60 features were shot in large format and
toured around the country in the then-common "roadshow" style.
Twentieth Century Fox developed the 70mm "Grandeur Film" process in
1929, which, though not a hit, would ultimately provide the basis for
such later formats as Todd-AO, Panavision, Super Technirama and
others. In all, four different methods were used to either expand the
size of the film stock or squeeze big images onto 35mm film and
unsqueeze them in projection.</LD>
<LD>   The Cinematheque series opens with a screening of a newly struck
Super Panavision 70 print of "Lord Jim." Directed in 1965 by Richard
Brooks", this adaptation of Joseph Conrad's novel stars Peter O'Toole
as the title character seeking redemption and adventure on the high
seas, with terrific supporting turns by Eli Wallach, James Mason and
the perennially sleazy Akim Tamiroff.</LD>
<TE>   A seemingly unlikely candidate for the restoration treatment,
"Lord Jim" on the wide screen enhances its thrilling exploration of
man against both nature and his own baser instincts, with many
reverberations of Conrad's now better-known "Heart of Darkness."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday the series screens a restored print of Franklin J.
Schaffner's 1970 film "Patton," winner of seven Academy Awards,
including best picture, actor, director and screenplay (the last
award was shared by veteran Edmund H. North and a promising young
writer named Francis Ford Coppola). It was one of only two films shot
in the Dimension 150 format, which featured a special lens that
rendered a 150-degree point of view. This explains both how Schaffner
achieved his sweeping, panoramic battlefield shots and why there are
so many of them.</TE>
<TE>   Truly big-screen films demand a certain largeness from everyone
involved, and few films exemplify this better than "Patton." In its
own way quite daring for its portrayal of a military man at the
height of the Vietnam War era, it is neither a puff piece nor a
condemnation, but a portrait of a complicated man torn apart by his
own contradictions. The film's storytelling is confident and relaxed,
in an unfussy fashion that seems refreshing compared with today's
thrill-a-minute joy rides.</TE>
<TE>   George C. Scott's performance as the difficult general is justly
regarded as one of the era's finest, bursting with manic energy. In
the film's final moments, he walks toward the camera until he fills
the oversize frame with his overgrown, swaggering girth. Schaffner
then deftly cuts to a shot which shrinks this towering figure to a
speck within the landscape, as the enormous screen, like the passing
of time, overcomes him.</TE>
<TE>   The series ends Saturday with an unlikely pairing of "2001: A
Space Odyssey" with "Hello Dolly." "2001" is one of the most
ambitious films ever produced with Hollywood's money (it was largely
made in England). Even if one has reservations about the
philosophical-cum-mystic point of view, there is no denying the
majesty of the film's technical achievements.</TE>
<TE>   Much pioneering special-effects work was done in the making of the
film, and nothing shows off the product of those labors quite like a
spectacular 70mm print.</TE>
<TE>   At the other end of the spectrum from the high-minded pomp of
"2001" is the unadulterated, rapacious glee of "Hello Dolly." The
sheer mad exuberance of Barbra Streisand's take on the title role is
overwhelming on the smallest of screens; here it takes on the energy
of a gale force. Though ultimately not as good as some of the other
directing efforts by musical legend Gene Kelly, the film is
nevertheless a real kick in the pants.</TE>
<TE>   The use of 70mm film died off by the early 1970s, in part because
of the success of smaller-scale, youth-oriented films such as "Easy
Rider" and in part because of the relative failure of the last
handful of wide-screen films, including, according to some, "Hello
Dolly." The format enjoyed a brief revival in the late 1970s and
early 1980s (with films such as "Star Wars," "Close Encounters of the
Third Kind" and "Apocalypse Now" shot on 35mm and blown up to 70mm)
in large part due to its capabilities for a more dynamic soundtrack.
Even this advantage died down with the rise of digital sound. The
last major Hollywood production shot on the larger format was Ron
Howard's 1991 film "Far and Away."</TE>
<TE>   With the onset of digital projection, this sort of lush,
transcendently enveloping experience may someday be no more. Enjoy it
while you can.</TE>

<LD>Chadwick Closes: Chadwick, the 2-year-old Beverly Hills restaurant
dedicated to the ideals of organic growing, closed on Sept. 14. Named
after Alan Chadwick, the British-born gardening guru, the restaurant
is owned by chef Ben Ford, the son of actor Harrison Ford. Ford,
along with co-chef Govind Armstrong, had earned acclaim for cuisine
that was both serious and playful. He said that the restaurant would
reopen early next month, after a review of its finances. "It's simply
a financial restructuring," Ford said. "Chadwick will remain Chadwick
with me as the chef. I'll know more in the next week." So will all of
us. Stay tuned.</LD>

<LD>   Ago Goes National: Agostino Sciandri and his partner, actor Robert
De Niro, plan to open an Ago Restaurant in Ian Schrager's Shore Club
in Miami in December, followed by branches in Chicago and New York
City. The Chicago Ago will be housed in a 1926 building on Michigan
Avenue that the Hard Rock Corp. intends to turn into a 400-room
hotel. It will open in the fall of 2003. As for New York, Sciandri
says, "It's another big project, but I can't discuss it yet."</LD>

blend California and Provencal cooking to create a simple, flavorful
menu. Szonntagh will oversee the hotel's main restaurant, Cezanne, as
well as food at the hotel spa and cafeteria.</TE>

<TE>   A Sunset Make-Over: Dodd Mitchell has another venture to add to
his long list of restaurant design projects. He'll be remaking the
Hyatt on Sunset, a hotel known for its marvelous views but never
considered one of the hippest spots in town. Mitchell is planning
poolside dim sum on the roof and a downstairs restaurant that will
included a hand-carved Indian stone bar and an atmosphere "dripping
with sexuality." He's looking for a chef to head a Pan-Asian kitchen.
The name is still in the works, but the opening is firmly scheduled
for mid-November. The Hyatt on Sunset is at 8401 Sunset Blvd., West

<LD>"Heroes, Traitors and Collaborators: The Netherlands Under
Occupation" will open tonight at 7:45 p.m. at the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences with a 25th anniversary screening of Paul
Verhoeven's Oscar-winning "Soldier of Orange," which will be
introduced by Verhoeven.</LD>
<LD>   This series of six features, plus lectures, continues through the
weekend at the James Bridges Theater in UCLA's Melnitz Hall.</LD>
<LD>   Before Verhoeven became a big-budget Hollywood director, he
pioneered a flowering of the Dutch cinema in the 1970s, which in turn
encouraged other filmmakers to confront Holland's wartime experience
under Nazi rule. Based on an autobiographical novel by Erik
Hazelhoff, "Soldier of Orange" follows six privileged university
students from the first German bombings, through capitulation, to
liberation in May 1945. The key figures are Rutger Hauer's Erik, a
reluctant but shrewd hero, and his best friend, the handsome,
devil-may-care Guus (Jeroen Krabbe).</LD>
<TE>   "Soldier of Orange" is a splendid period re-creation so typical of
the Dutch, and Verhoeven here is a filmmaker of immense vitality,
following the young men as some join the Resistance and one joins the
Germans.</TE>
<TE>   Recklessness comes to characterize Renee Soutendijk's beautiful
and fiery-tressed Johanna (Hannie) Schaft, the real-life heroine of
Ben Verbong's 1981 "The Girl With the Red Hair," which screens Sunday
at 10:30 a.m. Just as Hannie is up for a doctorate, she drops out of
school to become a Resistance assassin. Teamed with a tough-minded,
experienced man (Peter Tuinman), the headstrong Hannie becomes so
obsessive in her mission that she endangers others as well as
herself. On a wintry night in January 1945, in the city of
Haarlem--also the setting for Verbong's film--a family of four sits
around the dining room table at the beginning of Fons Rademaker's
1986 "The Assault," which screens Sunday at 3:30 p.m. The sound of
gunshots pierces the evening's silence, and the family's younger son
sees some neighbors dragging the body of a much-hated Nazi
collaborator into the front yard. Moments later, this 12-year-old boy
Anton (Marc Van Uchelen) will be torn from his parents and older
brother, never to see them again, saved only by his youth.</TE>
<TE>   From this terrifying beginning, the film becomes a somber, complex
saga of that boy's struggle to repress this traumatic event, right up
to adulthood in the near-present.</TE>
<TE>   "The Assault" is also a mystery, a probe of the convoluted
workings of the human psyche, and at last a quest for the precise
reason why it happened that those neighbors hauled that body in front
of the boy's It is not until 1952 that Anton (now played by Derek de
Lint), returns to Haarlem for a friend's graduation ceremony. From
here on, "The Assault" leapfrogs over the years until 1983, stopping
along the way for vivid and painful meetings with numerous people who
inadvertently offer pieces of the puzzle.</TE>
<TE>   It's not until "The Assault's" ironic concluding sequence that it
becomes fully clear that the use of newsreels has not been merely for
punctuation. At that moment, we realize that Anton has never involved
himself in the events of his time. It's only when he does that he
stumbles upon the truth of the past, which will set him free. (310)

<TE>   The American Cinematheque is presenting "Beyond the Mainstream: A
Tribute to Director Romuald Karmakar in Person" through Oct. 9 at the
Goethe Institut. Although Film Comment magazine recently hailed
Karmakar as one of the most fascinating figures in current European
cinema, he has heretofore remained little-known in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Opening the series tonight at 7:30 is the local premiere of the
highly entertaining "Manila" (1999), which focuses on 13 major
characters, Germans, mainly tourists, stranded at the Manila
International Airport. This situation sounds the stuff of
conventional melodrama, and it is that, but what's different is how
deeply Karmakar and his co-writer Bodo Kirchhoff probe these
characters..</TE>
<TE>   Among the key figures are two cousins, Rudi (Jurgen Vogel),
haunted by his experiences serving in the German armed forces in
Somalia, who is on his way home with his older cousin Herbert
(Manfred Zapatka), who has worked 20 years in Saudi Arabia and the
Philippines. Both men begin to pour out their stories to an
attractive German-speaking American (Elizabeth McGovern).</TE>
<TE>   Walter (Michael Degen) and Knut (Peter Ruhring), who is a retired
teacher from eastern Germany, are older men and hit it off. Walter
threw over his Mercedes dealership and family back in Germany to
start a new life running a popular brothel in the Philippines with
his pretty young wife (Chin Chin Gutierrez). As a jovial extrovert,
Walter gradually loosens up the uptight Knut, who has a heart
condition and an overly solicitous wife, also a retired teacher
(Margit Carstensen, an R.W. Fassbinder favorite). "Manila's" climax
is as satisfying as it is unexpected.</TE>
<TE>   In its annual New Films From Germany series, the Cinematheque
screened in 1996 and 1997 "The Deathmaker," which returns Wednesday
at 7:30 p.m. Karmakar's 1995 debut film is a grueling,
higdramatization of the 1924 interrogation of the accused serial
killer Ernst Schultze (Gotz George), the Jeffrey Dahmer of his day.

<TE>   Note: On Tuesday, the 21st Academy/Contemporary Documentaries
series begins at 7:30 p.m. at the James Bridges Theater in UCLA's
Melnitz Hall with Chuck Braverman's 30-minute "Rocky and Rolanda,"
about two teenagers, one abandoned in Hollywood, the other born to a
drug-addicted mother. It will be followed by Edet Belzberg's
"Children Underground," about homeless children living in a Bucharest
subway station. (310) 206-FILM.</TE>

<HD>Small Theaters Join in Discount Plan</HD>
<DH>Modeled on a Vancouver, Canada, program, Play7 will offer
subscription passes for seven admissions to 15 venues.</DH>

<LD>Fifteen small theater companies are joining forces to offer
subscription passes good for seven admissions to productions by any
of the participating companies.</LD>
<LD>   The project is called Play7. For $77, each subscriber will receive
seven admissions, valid for 380 days from the date of purchase. The
tickets can be used in configurations ranging from solo admissions at
seven different plays to seven admissions to the same performance of
the same play.</LD>
<LD>   Organizer Jonathan Winn predicts that more than 40 productions
will be eligible in any given 380-day period. Ticket prices at most
of the participating theaters normally begin at about $15.</LD>
<TE>   Winn, an actor affiliated with Circle X Theatre Company and an ad
agency employee in his day job, got the idea from a similar service
in Vancouver, See Seven. He proposed an L.A. venture at a May
conference organized by Theatre LA, the service and advocacy
organization for local theaters, and began enlisting member theaters.</TE>
<TE>   Participating companies must be "independent," he said, defining
it as "producing for the play's sake, not as an industry showcase or
for religious or other reasons."</TE>
<TE>   The companies that accepted the initial invitation all operate out
of sub-100-seat venues, usually in the geographical swath from East
L.A. to West Hollywood, including Circle X, Ensemble Studio Theatre,
Evidence Room, Greenway Arts Alliance, Lodestone Theatre, Met
Theatre, Open Fist, Robey Theatre, Sacred Fools, Theatre of Note and
Zoo District. Farther afield, the group also includes Pasadena's
Furious Theatre, the Westside's Padua Playwrights, Ziggurat Theatre
and Taper, Too, a project of the Mark Taper Forum that will use the
Ivy Substation in Culver City beginning next year.</TE>
<TE>   Actors' Gang, Fountain Theatre and Bilingual Foundation of the
Arts declined invitations to participate, Winn said.</TE>
<TE>   Use of the tickets is subject to availability, so reservations are
recommended but not required. The passes can be redeemed only at the
box office. "I want it to be as easy as going to the movies," Winn
said.</TE>
<TE>   The project isn't unprecedented on its home ground. In 1985-88,
five prominent 99-seat companies combined to offer the L.A. Theatre
Pass. Each subscriber was required to use one ticket at each
participating theater in a year.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Sossi, whose Odyssey Theatre was one of the Theatre Pass
participants, applauded the idea of Play7 but not the ability of
subscribers to use all of their tickets at one show. "You're giving
discount tickets to hits," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The See Seven program in Vancouver, which was modeled after a
Toronto program, changed its rules this year to limit the seating of
pass holders at a performance to about 15% of the house, said Tammy
Isaacson, one of the program's founders. She said that pass holders
tended to come on the already busy weekends, especially the last
weekend of a run. But she said that, overall, the program has
"improved the health of the participating companies remarkably."</TE>
<TE>   In 1992 Theatre LA offered a Sampler Series, which included six
tickets to specific shows at three larger theaters and three
sub-100-seaters, for $66. It died after only one year. "Getting
people to drive all over L.A. was the biggest problem," said Tom
Mitze, who was president of the Theatre LA board then. But that may
not affect the more geographically concentrated Play7 theaters.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Play7 tickets will be available beginning Oct. 28. For

<LD>"Scrubs" begins its second year of residency on NBC tonight at 8:30
facing a critical test: Can it live up to the expectations that come
with its new time slot, after ratings heavyweight "Friends," which
won its first Emmy for best comedy series on Sunday?</LD>
<LD>   Only time will tell. Interestingly enough, that wait-and-see
sentiment is also one of the themes with which the young doctors of
Sacred Heart Hospital must grapple tonight.</LD>
<LD>   For J.D. (Zach Braff), Elliot (Sarah Chalke) and Turk (Donald
Faison), the three residents, the world is full of dangerous
liaisons: Turk is having problems with his nurse girlfriend, Carla
(Judy Reyes); J.D. is feeling guilty for having betrayed his
hilariously idiosyncratic mentor, Dr. Cox (John C. McGinley); and
Elliot is literally hiding from rekindling a relationship with J.D.</LD>
<TE>   As viewers have come to expect from the first season, the show
deftly weaves bittersweet material with outright nutty humor, as
observed and fantasized by J.D. It also employs music as a key
element, and in the season opener, former Men at Work frontman Colin
Hay appears as a troubadour of sorts.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the musical side of "Scrubs" is threatening to turn into
a cottage industry, with the release this week of a soundtrack CD
featuring songs by Hay, Guided by Voices, Eels and many others. The
show's theme song, Lazlo Bane's "Superman," is being made into a
music video, directed by none other than series star Braff.</TE>

<HD>We'll Drink to That</HD>
<DH>Oktoberfest started in Bavaria in 1810; locally, we're
still trying to get it right</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT SANDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Which of the following is a purely fictitious event?</LD>
<LD>   (A) Rocktoberfest</LD>
<LD>   (B) Talktoberfest</LD>
<TE>   (C) Spocktoberfest</TE>
<TE>   (D) Bugtoberfest</TE>
<TE>   Actually, all are real. Oktoberfest is so ingrained in the U.S.
that we have twisted its very name like a pretzel for everything from
concerts and talk radio to "Star Trek" parodies and conventions of VW
enthusiasts.</TE>
<TE>   And that's without mentioning the innumerable Oktoberfests brewing
in Southern California bars now, such poor cousins of the real thing.
Just dress up some hot dogs with canned sauerkraut, put the Beck's on
tap, slap funny hats on the bartenders and you're in business: Roll
out the barrel, and while you're at it, spin poor King Ludwig I of
Bavaria another turn in his grave.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are some places more Germanic, like Alpine Village in
Torrance, Old World in Huntington Beach and the Phoenix Club in
Anaheim. They have beer, food and music much closer to what's
available at the original Munich celebration, which began its 16-day
run Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Yet no matter where you go in the L.A. area, the Oktoberfest
spirit seems watered down. At the best celebrations, people still
link arms and rock back and forth to the brass band's oom-pah-pahing
(naturally, Germans have precise words for this activity, schunkeln,
and song-craft, Blasmusik). But participants are no longer allowed to
dance on the tables, as they did some 20 years ago, thanks to
liability laws and overzealous security guards. In short, the
Teutonic tomfoolery is lacking.</TE>
<TE>   It shouldn't be that way. L.A., Orange and Ventura counties are
home to about 1 million people of German ancestry, according to the
latest census. There are still enough German speakers here to support
two regional newspapers, a few hours of weekly radio programming and
some churches. You'd think more people, stubborn in their heritage,
would be protective of it.</TE>
<TE>   Take Cincinnati. It claims to host the largest authentic
Oktoberfest in the U.S., but it saw last weekend's celebration marred
by controversy, as the German-American Citizens League withdrew its
sponsorship. The league said it did so, in part, because the festival
is no longer German enough.</TE>
<TE>   When you consider the event's last three grand marshals, it's hard
to argue too much with that: Davy Jones of the Monkees, singer Tony
Orlando and, this year, Verne Troyer, Mini-Me from "Austin Powers."</TE>
<TE>   Bavarian Partying</TE>
<TE>   Even in Munich, Oktoberfest draws so many American tourists to its
14 beer tents that there are times it might seem as if you've
remained stateside. Yet, chances are, the extremes of Bavarian
partying will quickly reorient you. Beer is served in 1-liter steins,
and 5 million to 6 million are downed annually, along with several
hundred thousand chickens and about 80 oxen, among other creatures.</TE>
<TE>   Such unabashed consumption carries a price, and many tourist
guides advise leaving one or two hours before last call. As one of my
female friends from Munich puts it: "It's just not Oktoberfest unless
it ends in fights breaking out and people puking all over the place."</TE>
<TE>   The festival has come a long way since it began Oct. 12, 1810, to
celebrate the marriage of Ludwig to Princess Therese of
Saxony-Hildburghausen. Back then, five days of festivities ended with
a horse race. It was such a good time that Bavarians decided to
celebrate the next year, and one thing led to another, so that now
they start in September to fit in all the activities.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, we can't all jet off to Munich, which leaves us back
where we started: here in some dark Southern California bar, limp
pretzel in one hand and plastic cup of Bud in the other. But it
doesn't have to be that way.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Lion Tavern in Silver Lake, perhaps the hippest German
hangout around, is a step in the right direction, even if it has no
special festivities. The waitresses there, one-third of whom are
German, will tell you that every Friday and Saturday night are like
Oktoberfest--and they're right, except for the fact that there's no
brass band in the beer garden.</TE>
<TE>   Bands From Germany</TE>
<TE>   For that you must go to bigger venues like Alpine Village, Old
World and the Phoenix Club. They import bands from Germany, and their
beer and food selections range from limited to spectacular (see
sidebar). The emcees typically speak in an admixture of English and
Bavarian, overseeing events ranging from endurance beer stein holding
to speed wood-sawing to those with a more lascivious bent, such as
cow milking and bratwurst eating. And there's the chicken dance, a
tradition started in the 1970s involving much arm-flapping and
rear-wiggling.</TE>
<TE>   As for a truly authentic experience ... well, that's open to
debate, and one best waged in English at that. Try ordering food or
drink auf deutsch and you could very well get a stare resembling
bitter-beer face (or a response en espanol). A better bet for
conversation is one of the regular attendees, usually older gentlemen
in lederhosen or ladies in dirndl, though they too tend to speak the
Germanglish of the emcees.</TE>
<TE>   It's yet another sign of how Oktoberfest has meshed with U.S.
culture. Depending on your viewpoint, it's a loss of German identity
or a victory of the melting pot. Either way, to drown your sorrows or
toast the American way, it's worth raising a glass and saying,
"Cheers!" ... er, wait ... "Prost!"</TE>

<HD>Beatles' 'A Hard Day's Night' Is Still Fab</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It only took 16 weeks to complete the Beatles' seminal 1964 movie "A
Hard Day's Night." The spectacular new two-disc DVD (Miramax, $30)
was 2 1/2 years in the making.</LD>
<LD>   Miramax gave Beatle historian Martin Lewis carte blanche to
produce the digital edition of the joyous musical comedy that starred
the Fab Four--John, Paul, George and Ringo--at their most fab.</LD>
<LD>   "You get this opportunity once in a lifetime," Lewis says. "I
don't think they thought I would be as zealous and obsessed. How many
DVDs do you know that have 30 separate interviews? I couldn't stop."</LD>
<TE>   Lewis obtained terrific interviews from director Richard Lester,
musical director George Martin (who discusses each song in the film),
producer Walter Shenson, associate producer Denis O'Dell, United
Artists executive David Picker, actors John Junkin, David Janson,
Jeremy Lloyd and Kenneth Haigh, director of photography Gilbert
Taylor, hairdresser Betty Glasgow, tailor Gordon Millings,
photographer Robert Freeman and the Beatles' buddy, German artist
Klaus Voorman.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis even found actress Isla Blair, whose role in the film--as an
actress who encounters Paul--had been cut. "She had never spoken
about it," Lewis says. "Can you imagine the exhilaration being cast
in a movie with the Beatles and then you are cut? Even though it
wasn't her fault, she felt embarrassed. She was the most charming
lady and such a good sport."</TE>
<TE>   "A Hard Day's Night" has been digitally transferred from the
original 35-millimeter negative. The original soundtrack also has
been digitally restored.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis believes the film has never become dated because it captured
the truth of the Beatles' personalities as well as their spirit.
"There is almost a giddy exuberance, a joyous optimism with life," he
says. "Seventy-five percent of the people who buy Beatles records are
25 and under, so the Beatles aren't nostalgia to them. What they
react to is the spirit, the joy that they bring and communicate. It
has nothing to do with the '60s; it has everything to do with the
passion for life."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Next to "A Hard Day's Night," Paramount's digital edition of the
1978 musical comedy blockbuster "Grease" ($20) is pretty much a
fizzle. The John Travolta-Olivia Newton-John musical comedy features
a trailer, a songbook and a passable retrospective that was produced
four years ago for the 20th anniversary theatrical re-release. On the
plus side, the wide-screen transfer is crisp and pristine.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There's also a lot of toe-tapping music in Mira Nair's joyous
romantic comedy "Monsoon Wedding" (Universal, $33). This delightful
Indian import--which is guaranteed to put a smile on your
face--revolves around an upper-middle-class New Delhi family that is
preparing for the arranged marriage of its eldest daughter.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD includes a nice documentary on the making of the film that
originally aired on the Independent Film Channel, and sparkling
commentary from Nair, who made this art-house hit in 30 days.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New from Warner Home Video are two-disc collector's sets of the
Oscar-winning best films "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" from 1975
and the 1992 Clint Eastwood western "Unforgiven" ( $27 each).</TE>
<TE>   The digital edition of "Cuckoo's Nest" includes an excellent
documentary on the inspired drama that stars Jack Nicholson and
Louise Fletcher in their Oscar-winning roles, several fascinating
deleted scenes (including an alternative first meeting between
Nicholson and Fletcher), a beautiful new wide-screen digital transfer
and amusing, intelligent commentary from director Milos Forman and
producers Michael Douglas and Saul Zaentz.</TE>
<TE>   Clint Eastwood biographer, documentary filmmaker and film critic
Richard Schickel is actually the star of the digital edition of
"Unforgiven." He supplies the thought-provoking, informative
commentary featured on the first disc, and the second disc includes
two of his documentaries: the candid, on-set piece "Eastwood &amp; Co.
Making 'Unforgiven' " and the acclaimed career retrospective,
"Eastwood on Eastwood."</TE>

<HD>Blues Festival Near Ojai at Lake Casitas</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEF WOODARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new blues boom was established around the country and the world by
the early 1980s. A bounty of aficionados--mostly white and
obsessive--created venues and organizations for this Great American
Music, one in need of extra loving care.</LD>
<LD>   In this region, like elsewhere, the blues found friends and gig
opportunities where none had previously existed.</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Barbara Blues Society started up in 1977 and is now the
oldest continuously running blues society in the nation. And in 1982,
roots music enthusiast and impresario Michael Kaufer kicked up the
Bowlful of Blues in Ojai, an important annual blues and roots event
celebrating its 20th anniversary Saturday. The festival moved in 2000
from its original location at Libbey Bowl to an idyllic waterfront
site at Lake Casitas.</LD>
<TE>   Headlining this year will be Baton Rouge's Kenny Neal, who mixes
Cajun sauce in with his blues; honking saxist Big Jay McNeely;
Louisiana's Lil' Brian &amp; the Zydeco Travelers; and former Stax
recording artist May Ann "Tweety" Woodard. Tapping into Ventura
County's considerable talent pool, we'll also hear Jimmy Calire,
Jackie Lomax, Ball and Sultan, Leslie Lembo and 11-year old guitar
wunderkind Devon Geyer.</TE>
<TE>   The lakeside Bowlful of Blues has become one of the county's more
predictably good times for the having, bolstered by a strong sense of
history.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bowlful of Blues, Saturday, 2-10 p.m., Lake Casitas, near Ojai.
Advance, $23; at the gate, $25; senior citizens 65 and older and
students 13-19, half-price. Children 12 and younger, free. Parking
$3. (805) 646-7230. www.bowlfulofblues.com.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Picturing Artists: Photographer-administrator Donna Granata has
given considerable effort to putting a face on Ventura County's art
scene, both through her organization, Focus on the Masters, and
through her own expressive medium. Her portraits of the artists, a
healthy selection of which are now on display at Ojai Center for the
Arts, tend to peel back the curtain on otherwise faceless creative
energies.</TE>
<TE>   As seen in this crop of lush color portraits, Granata doesn't
follow any strict guidelines in her portraiture.</TE>
<TE>   One striking shot is her portrait of famed photographer and
portraitist Arnold Newman, amid photography apparatus. Whereas
Newman's work strips away external tricks and focuses on the subject,
though, Granata stays flexible in her approach.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, we get a surreal image of landscape artist Norman Kirk, part
photograph and part unfinished painting, the artist playfully
immersed in his art. Art/Life publisher Joe Cardella is seen in a
doppelganger image, holding a copy of Art/Life, mimicked in a frame
around the portrait. Composer Miguel del Aguila, a once dominant
force in the area who now spends most of his time in New York, is
seen as both a sharp unflinching presence and a fuzzy reflection in
his piano lid.</TE>
<TE>   Other notable pieces here include a new photo of conceptual
sculptor Dennis Oppenheim, whose rainbow-like, dynamic bus
centerpiece on Telegraph Road was recently featured in the magazine
Art in America. Red arcs swirl about him, as if his mind has gone
dizzy with possibilities for his public art notions.</TE>
<TE>   In other photos of Ojai artists, witty Mad magazine cartoonist
Sergio Aragones sits--swimming in ideas, one assumes--at his busy
desk, and celebrated Ojai-based painter Michael Dvortcsak seems
caught between thoughts among his luminous paintings.</TE>
<TE>   Some images work their charms in unexpected ways, like the shot of
painter Carlisle Cooper, a mild figure on a couch, in a light blue
sweater. The artist's own cool, aloof visage is in marked contrast
with the radiant splashiness of his unique painting style. The
image's duality suggests the old adage--never solely judge the artist
by the art, and vice versa.</TE>

<HD>Rocker Has an Artist's Eye</HD>
<DH>The exhibit opening was fairly tame, but Marilyn Manson's
watercolors can be oddly appealing</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA HUNDLEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There may have been raven-haired Amazons in black bustiers,
porcelain-skinned boys with kohl-rimmed eyes and bottomless glasses
of milky green Absente (absinthe's less potent American cousin), but
in the end the most surreal thing about the VIP premiere for Marilyn
Manson's debut watercolors collection (aptly titled "The Golden Age
of Grotesque") was its remarkable lack of surrealism. Not that there
wasn't the prerequisite weirdness.</LD>
<LD>   A smattering of Hollywood's edgy celebs made their usual dramatic
arrivals at Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions gallery. A
swaggering Nic Cage waltzed in arm-in-arm with a grim-faced,
stiletto-heeled Lisa Marie Presley. Andy Dick hammed for the MTV
cameras while Crispin Glover skulked nervously in a corner. Even
little Jack Osborne made an appearance, rushing through the gallery
trailing adolescent hormones and an ever-present camera crew.</LD>
<LD>   There were whispers that Anna Nicole Smith was due to appear at
any moment with her own show's entourage, but alas, the collision of
two reality TV series in one small room was not to be.</LD>
<TE>   Yet despite all the hoopla, the opening (sponsored by the
L.A.-based magazine Flaunt) was surprisingly tame, simply a small
horde of press, publicists and assorted hangers-on pretending not to
look at one another while they waited for something extraordinary to
happen.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing did.</TE>
<TE>   The fact of the matter was that Manson (rock 'n' roll antihero,
occasional pop pariah and facile media manipulator) had merely
produced some strangely appealing, delicately colored, sometimes
unsettling paintings using a medium normally favored by landscape
artists and third-graders.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they're very heartfelt," said local artist Camille Rose
Garcia, gazing up at a canvas that featured a prettily rendered
depiction of the infamous Black Dahlia murder. "They remind me a
little of Egon Schiele, but he's definitely bringing in his own
Marilyn Manson thing, which is nice to see. Critics might be ready to
dig the guy a grave, but these are actually really sincerely
painted."</TE>
<TE>   In the midst of the crowd the man of the hour shuffled about in
crepe-soled Frankenstein boots, humbly fielding compliments and
occasional reaching up to brush a lock of ebony hair from his
meticulously blackened eyes. At his side was lover Dita Von Tease,
queen of the new burlesque renaissance and subject of several of the
show's more interesting portraits.</TE>
<TE>   "People are actually buying my paintings," said Manson, as if this
fact came as some surprise. Talking to Manson is not easy to do. He
is nearly 7 feet tall in his boots, and he wears a thick coat of
alabaster face makeup, which is disconcerting enough, but it is the
one opaque contact lens that throws you. This eye catches and
reflects the light, which means Manson sees out but you can't see in.</TE>
<TE>   Yet when he speaks about his work, Manson changes. A blush creeps
up from under the white, and it becomes apparent that he may be the
last thing you expected: just an ordinary guy who likes to paint.
"I've been drawing since I was a kid," Manson says, his one clear eye
glowing. "It was an escape for me. And it still is. Painting is just
you and a piece of paper, and no one can tell you what the rules are
because there aren't any.</TE>
<TE>   "I never intended to paint for anyone other than myself. But I
realized eventually that this is something I should show people
because this is a part of who I am."</TE>

<HD>Asbestos Suits Become More Widespread</HD>
<DH>Study: The number of companies affected is triple previous
estimates, report says. Concerns about victims renewed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Asbestos litigation has ensnared more than 6,000 companies--triple
previous estimates--and is affecting nearly every industry, a Rand
Institute study said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. companies have paid out $54 billion on more than 600,000
asbestos injury claims filed since the early 1970s, the Rand
Institute for Civil Justice reported. Asbestos claims ultimately
could cost as much as $210 billion, according to projections cited in
the study, and more than 60 companies--22 of them in the last two
years--have sought bankruptcy protection to staunch their losses.</LD>
<LD>   The rising cost of the lawsuits has brought calls for reforms, and
on Wednesday corporate defenders, insurers and lawyers for
asbestos-related cancer victims seized on the Rand report as evidence
of the need for change in a hearing on asbestos litigation before the
Senate Judiciary Committee.</LD>
<TE>   The hearing coincided with this week's opening of a massive
class-action suit in West Virginia involving more than 5,000
plaintiffs and dozens of corporations including Exxon Mobil Corp.,
Owens-Illinois Inc., Westinghouse Electric Corp. and Union Carbide,
now part of Dow Chemical Co.</TE>
<TE>   In a measure of the breadth of the litigation, Rand found asbestos
suits had been filed against companies in 75 of 83 industry sectors
tracked by the government, said Stephen Carroll, the Rand senior
economist who headed the study.</TE>
<TE>   "The bankruptcies are the tip of the iceberg," Carroll said.
"Under the surface there are a lot of corporations that are being hit
hard by asbestos liabilities and they are putting their money into
compensation payments instead of investment."</TE>
<TE>   The Rand study also renewed questions about whether the growing
pile of lawsuits is benefiting the victims of asbestos. Despite the
enormous economic costs, the authors conclude that asbestos
litigation is failing to adequately compensate the most seriously ill
victims and no longer poses a deterrent to the pursuit of profits at
the expense of worker health.</TE>
<TE>   After the costs of litigation, asbestos claimants now receive 43
cents of every dollar spent on asbestos compensation, a slight
improvement over the 37 cents that Rand researchers said reached
plaintiffs' pockets 20 years ago. At the same time, the most
seriously ill victims--people with lung cancer and mesothelioma, an
incurable asbestos-related cancer--get little more than a third of
all payouts, the study said.</TE>
<TE>   The study echoes others' concerns that a surge in claims in the
last four years from people who may have been exposed to asbestos but
are not sick is draining money away from cancer victims who have high
medical expenses and are no longer able to earn a living.</TE>
<TE>   "The system looks worse 20 years later," said Deborah Hensler, a
Stanford University law professor who contributed to Rand's first
asbestos litigation study in 1982 and to its latest. "The system [in
1982], however inefficiently, was performing its job of corrective
justice. It was making the bad guys pay. And by making the bad guys
pay, the system was sending a very strong message to other potential
bad guys working with other products that 'If you engage in this kind
of behavior, you might find yourself in bankruptcy.' "</TE>
<TE>   Today, Hensler said, high legal costs and payouts to claimants
without serious injuries are diverting money away from cancer
victims, and corporate America no longer believes that only the most
culpable companies pay.</TE>
<TE>   Because litigation has spread to hundreds of companies outside the
asbestos mining and manufacturing business, Hensler said, executives
of recently targeted companies are saying, " 'This is not fair. We
are being asked to pay for something that other blame-worthy
companies did.' "</TE>
<TE>   Fred Baron, a pioneering asbestos lawyer from Texas and a recent
president of the Assn. of Trial Lawyers of America, disputed the idea
that "uninvolved companies" are being unfairly swept into the fray.</TE>
<TE>   "While these companies did not manufacture asbestos, they used,
distributed or otherwise sold products to others knowing that their
asbestos content was likely to injure downstream users," Baron said.
"Other defendants purchased companies, often at a discount, knowing
these companies had substantial asbestos liability."</TE>
<TE>   Baron's comments came during the Judiciary Committee hearing.</TE>
<TE>   But Steve Kazan, an Oakland lawyer who represents only cancer
victims, told the committee that unless Congress steps in, there will
be no money left to compensate people who fall victim to asbestos
cancers over the next 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 27 million workers were heavily exposed to asbestos
between 1940 and 1973. But, because mesothelioma can take 40 years or
more to appear, at least 2,500 new cases are diagnosed each year, and
the disease is widely expected to claim hundreds of thousands of
lives in 30 to 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   To preserve funds for future mesothelioma victims, Kazan has taken
the unusual position of joining corporations and insurers in
proposing that Congress establish medical thresholds that would bar
claims from people who are not functionally impaired. Other asbestos
reform efforts have failed over the years, and, despite more than a
year of lobbying, the latest idea has not found its way into a bill.</TE>
<TE>   Baron, testifying on behalf of the trial lawyers
association, urged the congressional committee to continue its restraint,
saying the proposed reforms would harm the rights of most asbestos
victims.</TE>
<TE>   "Although they will argue that the only way to pay more to the
sickest is by paying less to others, the defendants' real goal is to
pay less total asbestos compensation," Baron said. "The concept that
a victim must be impaired before their claim can be heard is an
invention of the asbestos defendants designed to limit their
liability."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), who chairs the committee, said he
was interested in coming up with a bill that would respond to the
neediest victims, but he said the comittee was unlikely to take it up
before Congress adjourns for the year.</TE>

<HD>Analysts Say Management Buyout at DirecTV Unlikely</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investment bankers say a media buyer such as News Corp. would have
the upper hand in any bidding war for DirecTV's parent, Hughes
Electronics Corp., if the satellite TV concern's proposed sale to
EchoStar Communications Corp. is blocked by federal regulators.</LD>
<LD>   Although Hughes' management may be able to assemble its own bid to
buy the company by bringing in a financial backer, a media giant such
as News Corp. probably would be able to pay a higher price,
investment bankers and analysts said Wednesday. One reason is that
News Corp. already has satellite operations worldwide and could count
on cost savings from combining DirecTV's operations to justify a
higher price, analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   El Segundo-based Hughes on Wednesday issued a statement by Chief
Executive Jack Shaw denying that the company is "working on plans"
for a management buyout, and saying the company's top priority is
getting the EchoStar merger approved by regulators.</LD>
<TE>   But in recent weeks, sources within the company said, Hughes'
executives have pondered the idea of a buyout as a fallback position.
This comes as regulators appear ready to block the DirecTV-EchoStar
merger or impose conditions too onerous to accept.</TE>
<TE>   Last October EchoStar outbid Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. to
purchase Hughes in a cash and stock deal then valued at $26 billion.
But the merger presents clear antitrust concerns, according to many
analysts and economists, because it would combine the nation's only
two satellite-TV providers into a monopoly serving nearly one-fifth
of U.S. homes</TE>
<TE>   The future of Hughes has been uncertain for almost three years,
since speculation first surfaced that its parent, General Motors
Corp., might sell the fast-growing satellite unit. GM owns a
controlling 30% stake in Hughes, which is a GM tracking stock.</TE>
<TE>   In early 2000, the satellite subsidiary had a market value of more
than $40 billion, compared with $11 billion today. Part of the Hughes
loss is due to the general stock market meltdown. But the decrease
also is partly due to soaring operating costs at DirecTV, which
accounts for about two-thirds of Hughes' revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Shareholders blame GM for allowing Hughes to drift as the auto
maker's management waffled on whether to keep the satellite
subsidiary or sell it. GM also spent more than a year negotiating a
Hughes sale to News Corp., only to change course at the eleventh hour
when EchoStar trumped the offer.</TE>
<TE>   If the merger is rejected, Hughes shareholders could face another
prolonged period of uncertainty as GM decides whether to keep
operating Hughes, find another buyer or spin off the satellite group.</TE>
<TE>   "GM will be 0-2 if the merger is rejected, so they need their next
move to succeed because shareholders are already frustrated," said
analyst Jimmy Schaeffler of the Carmel Group, a market research firm.</TE>
<TE>   Investment bankers said the heavy level of borrowing that probably
would be required for a management-led buyout of Hughes would make
such a bid a longshot given today's conservative lending environment
and Wall Street's disdain for heavy debt.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to see any leveraged buyout getting done here because
of today's more conservative lending practices and because the
financial markets are spooked," said one investment banker.</TE>

<HD>Musicians, Labels Launch Campaign Against Piracy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With CD sales drooping and online piracy booming, a high-profile
group of musicians, labels and their organizations is launching a
campaign today to convince the public that it's wrong to swap music
through the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   The group, which includes such hit makers as Madonna, Eminem and
Shakira, plans a series of print and broadcast advertisements that
paint a grim picture of the harm caused by online file sharing. The
ads will be funded, at least initially, by the major record labels'
trade association, the Recording Industry Assn. of America.</LD>
<LD>   The effort comes more than two years after now-defunct Napster
Inc. made it simple for consumers to copy music online for free.
Although three federal courts have ruled that such copying is
illegal, the number of online file-sharing companies has skyrocketed,
as has the number of people downloading music for free.</LD>
<TE>   Some skeptics say the campaign is coming too late to make a
difference in public attitudes about file sharing. They also
criticize the RIAA for tarring legal forms of copying along with
illegal ones in an attempt to educate consumers about the evils of
piracy.</TE>
<TE>   "They're trying to make it simple, and it isn't," said Allen
Baden, a copyright expert at law firm Kenyon &amp; Kenyon in San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   RIAA executives say the vast majority of today's file sharing is
illegal, yet surveys show that most people see nothing wrong with it.</TE>
<TE>   "We try to be as circumspect as possible but at least give some
guidance to consumers," said Cary Sherman, the RIAA's president.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign also attempts to answer one of the most common
defenses that people assume for downloading music on file-sharing
networks: that musicians don't receive money from CD sales, so they
are not harmed if people download songs instead of buying them. In
the advertisements, dozens of artists argue that downloading their
songs without permission is the same as stealing and that file
swapping hurts new artists and emerging music entrepreneurs.</TE>
<TE>   Notably absent from the campaign is the Recording Artist
Coalition, a group of musicians that has battled the labels over
contract terms and accounting issues.</TE>
<TE>   But Jay Rosenthal, an attorney for the coalition, agreed that
unauthorized downloads hurt artists, not just in lost royalties but
also in diminished funds for promoting CDs and developing new acts.</TE>
<TE>   "Behind every major label there are real artists being harmed,"
Rosenthal said.</TE>
<TE>   Analyst Phil Leigh of Raymond James &amp; Associates, an investment
bank, said the advertising campaign may lay the groundwork for the
labels' suing consumers who make heavy use of file-sharing networks,
as the RIAA has threatened to do.</TE>
<TE>   Leigh said the labels have to do more than scold consumers--they
have to offer a legitimate alternative to file-sharing networks.</TE>

<HD>Report Foresees $3 Prices at Pump</HD>
<DH>Energy: Environmental group says phasing out MTBE in gas
will lead to a 5% decline in supplies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ROBINSON-JACOBS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California motorists could see gasoline prices spike to near $3 a
gallon in the next few years unless the state substantially reduces
its demand for oil, according to an environmental group.</LD>
<LD>   In a report being released today, the Natural Resources Defense
Council says California's refinery capacity will be unable to keep up
with demand because of population growth and other factors, including
the state's planned phaseout of the additive MTBE, or methyl tertiary
butyl ether.</LD>
<LD>   Ending the use of MTBE, which is added to make gasoline burn
cleaner but contaminates ground water, will reduce refinery output by
5%, the report says, and that will have to be made up from
out-of-state gasoline suppliers.</LD>
<TE>   The state's refineries already are operating near their
capacities, and construction of new ones is unlikely because of
clean-air rules and other regulatory hurdles, a spokesman for the
environmental group said.</TE>
<TE>   Claudia Chandler, assistant executive director of the California
Energy Commission, termed a 5% decrease in supplies significant.</TE>
<TE>   "The gasoline lines of the '70s were caused by a 5% disruption,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   The state currently imports about 30,000 barrels of gasoline a day
to augment supplies that cannot be provided by local refineries, the
report says.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be tougher and tougher to get imported supplies of gas,"
said Roland Hwang, author of the report and a senior policy analyst
with the group. "Within the next several years, we're looking at an
increased likelihood of a $2-per-gallon average and the real
possibility of $3 spikes."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Langland, a spokesman for BP, which sells gasoline in
California under the Arco and Thrifty brands, said predicting how
much gasoline will cost in the future is tricky because of continuing
improvements to oil refinery technology, which could increase
production, as well as the uncertain price of oil.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, he noted that BP is funding significant research
into fuel cells and alternative fuels because "everyone understands
that the era of the hydrocarbon will come to an end at some time in
the future."</TE>
<TE>   To reduce dependence on gasoline, the report proposes that the
state give auto makers more incentives to increase the fuel economy
of passenger vehicles sold here to 42 miles per gallon by 2015, up
from the current average of 24 mpg.</TE>
<TE>   The group also says the state should promote the development of
hydrogen-powered fuel-cell vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   The plan further calls for a public education effort similar to
the successful "Flex Your Power" campaign and encourages developers
and municipal planners to adopt so-called smart-growth policies that
include increased use of mass transit and market pricing for parking.</TE>

<HD>Homestore's Ex-Execs to Aid Investigators</HD>
<DH>Internet: The three also will plead guilty and pay $4.6
million as probe continues into revenue-inflation scam.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD, JOSH MEYER and EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Three former executives of Homestore Inc. will plead guilty to
criminal charges and pay $4.6 million to settle civil charges in
connection with a phony-revenue scam and cooperate with investigators
as the probe moves forward, officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The cases against the executives of the Westlake Village Internet
company were announced by U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, who said the
case was an example of the Bush administration's pledge to crack down
on corporate corruption.</LD>
<LD>   Ashcroft and Securities and Exchange Commission officials
suggested that others are already targets in the probe.</LD>
<TE>   "Whether you are an executive at a Fortune 100 firm or an Internet
start-up, if you victimize investors and employees, you will face
investigation, prosecution and prison for your crimes," Ashcroft
said.</TE>
<TE>   In a complaint filed in federal court in Los Angeles on Wednesday
against the three former executives, prosecutors allege that a "major
media company," identified by federal sources as AOL Time Warner
Inc.'s America Online unit, was involved in "round-trip" financial
transactions in 2001 that allowed Homestore to inflate its financial
results by booking its own money as advertising revenue.</TE>
<TE>   "We are confident that our deal with Homestore and our accounting
for it was appropriate," AOL spokesman John Buckley said.</TE>
<TE>   As reported Wednesday in The Times, former Homestore executives
John Giesecke Jr., Joseph J. Shew and John DeSimone have agreed to
plead guilty to conspiracy, fraud and insider trading.</TE>
<TE>   Giesecke, 42, of Malibu, a former chief financial officer who was
Homestore's chief operating officer at the time of the offenses, will
plead guilty to one count of conspiracy and one count of wire fraud.
In agreements with the SEC, he also will repay $3.4 million in stock
option gains and pay a $360,000 fine.</TE>
<TE>   Shew, 37, of West Chester, Pa., a former Homestore CFO, will plead
guilty to one conspiracy count and repay $1.1 million in stock gains.
Giesecke and Shew also will be barred for life from serving as
officers or directors of a public firm.</TE>
<TE>   DeSimone, 33, of Hermosa Beach, a former vice president of
Homestore, will plead guilty to one count of securities fraud for
selling stock while knowing about the accounting fraud. He agreed to
repay the $177,796 profit from the stock sales and will be barred
from serving as an officer or director of a public company for 10
years.</TE>
<TE>   Giesecke's attorney, Jan Handzlik, said his client "did not
concoct or suggest the scheme" and feels remorse for his role. Shew's
attorney, Terry Bird, said Shew would cooperate with the government
and private plaintiffs.</TE>
<TE>   DeSimone's lawyer, John Vandevelde, said his client is "fully
cooperating." Vandevelde said DeSimone acted at the direction of
higher-ups.</TE>
<TE>   Debra Yang, the U.S. attorney for Los Angeles, said that even with
their agreements to cooperate, Giesecke could be sentenced to as many
as 10 years in prison, and Shew and DeSimone could each face five
years.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said Homestore wasn't charged because of its
"extraordinary" cooperation with criminal and civil probes once it
discovered the revenue-inflating scheme.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement sources and defense attorneys said those under
investigation include former Homestore Chief Executive Stuart H.
Wolff, who resigned in January, and Peter Tafeen, a former executive
vice president who coordinated the advertising deals that led to the
charges. Tafeen left the company about a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Wolff's attorney, Howard M. Privette of Los Angeles, declined to
discuss the investigation. Wolff, an engineer who co-founded
Homestore and remains a major shareholder, "relied on folks around
him to do their jobs with integrity," Privette said.</TE>
<TE>   Tafeen's lawyer, Robert C. Friese of San Francisco, said Tafeen
was "one of the earliest to cooperate with the SEC" and has offered
to cooperate fully with the federal criminal probe as well.</TE>
<TE>   Friese said Tafeen is not an accountant and wasn't knowledgeable
about details of how Homestore booked its revenue. Friese said
investigators are looking into whether there was a legitimate
business purpose for the ad deals, but said Tafeen regards the
complex transactions as legitimate.</TE>
<TE>   AOL is facing probes into its own accounting by the SEC and the
U.S. attorney in Alexandria, Va. Earlier this year, Dulles, Va.-based
AOL was assured that it was not the target of the Homestore probe,
but government investigators now want more details about AOL's role,
sources said.</TE>
<TE>   AOL executives have told investigators that one of its former
managers, Eric Keller, might have participated in the Homestore
scheme, according to sources at the company. He resigned under
pressure last year after an internal investigation of his dealings
with Homestore and PurchasePro, a Las Vegas software firm that also
is the target of a government probe.</TE>
<TE>   Keller could not be reached for comment Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>Hewlett-Packard to Cut 1,800 More Jobs</HD>
<DH>Computers: Layoffs would be on top of the 15,000 planned.
Weak tech spending persists.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co. said Wednesday that it would cut 1,800 jobs on
top of the 15,000 layoffs planned as part of the acquisition of
Compaq Computer Corp. amid persistent weakness in technology spending
by consumers and large corporate customers.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's largest personal computer and printer maker had
promised to accelerate cost-cutting efforts last month when it
reported declining revenue in most product lines. HP President
Michael Capellas said this week that the company would meet its goal
of cutting 10,000 jobs by the end of next month, a month earlier than
planned.</LD>
<LD>   Other cuts will be completed by the fall of 2003.</LD>
<TE>   About 8,200 jobs will be eliminated from the Hewlett-Packard side
of the operation and about 8,600 from the former Compaq by the end of
October 2003, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Hiring will continue in the printer and services operations, a
company spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   HP bought rival Compaq for $18.9 billion--the largest technology
merger ever--to boost efficiencies. Since the deal closed in May,
technology spending has worsened more than expected, especially
corporate spending for information technology.</TE>
<TE>   The two companies had a total 150,000 employees when they merged,
and about 6,500 were let go by late August.</TE>
<TE>   In reporting the first results as a combined company Aug. 27, HP
cited overall weakness in the technology sector rather than problems
with the Compaq acquisition for its disappointing sales.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue of $16.5 billion missed analysts' expectations of $16.7
billion. The company had a net loss of $2.03 billion in the fiscal
third quarter that ended in July, including one-time charges related
to the acquisition, job cuts and other restructuring costs.</TE>
<TE>   One bright spot for Hewlett-Packard was its printing and services
operations. Sales of printers and accessories rose 10% to $4.7
billion in the third quarter, making up about 28% of total revenue.
Revenue from technology services, which was touted as a key rationale
for the merger, was down 7% to $3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Hewlett-Packard introduced new printers, digital
cameras and other products as part of a $1.2-billion plan announced
in June to overhaul its consumer offerings.</TE>
<TE>   In early June, Hewlett-Packard lowered its expectations for sales
growth in fiscal 2003 to 7% to 9% from earlier expectations of 8% to
10%.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Palo Alto-based Hewlett-Packard closed up 55 cents at
$12.84 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>IMF Says U.S. Woes Hurt Recovery</HD>
<DH>Outlook: The fund lowers its estimates of global economic
growth, citing corporate America's financial scandals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>America's corporate accountability crisis is sapping the strength of
the world economy, the International Monetary Fund said Wednesday as
it reduced its estimates of global growth in 2003.</LD>
<LD>   IMF economists said U.S. financial scandals were contributing to a
sluggish recovery from last year's global recession by undermining
investor and consumer confidence around the world, depressing markets
and slowing the cycle of production and consumption. They predicted
the world economy would expand at a 3.7% rate next year, instead of
the 4% rebound they forecast six months ago.</LD>
<LD>   The revised estimates are contained in a 246-page World Economic
Outlook that will be presented to several hundred world finance
officials gathering in Washington for weekend meetings of the IMF,
World Bank and Group of 7 industrialized nations.</LD>
<TE>   In an unusual appeal to the thousands of protesters expected to
fill the streets, IMF chief economist Kenneth Rogoff praised their
idealism and passion but denounced efforts by some to halt the
increasing integration of rich and poor economies.</TE>
<TE>   "Anarchy does not breed prosperity," Rogoff said. "The process of
globalization needs to be strengthened, its benefits broadened, but
it should not be reversed."</TE>
<TE>   Rogoff's search for common ground did not still the institution's
critics. An independent think tank issued a report predicting that
the IMF's efforts to support Brazil's debt-laden economy are doomed
to fail.</TE>
<TE>   An anti-globalization group reported progress in organizing a
boycott of World Bank bonds. Protest leaders outlined their plans to
disrupt Washington traffic by occupying major intersections.</TE>
<TE>   The chorus of criticism illustrates the increasingly fractious
debate about the "Washington consensus" approach to managing
globalization.</TE>
<TE>   Nongovernmental organizations have become more aggressive in their
attempts to influence actions by the IMF, which acts as lender of
last resort for economies in crisis, and the World Bank, which
finances programs to promote economic growth in developing countries.</TE>
<TE>   The institutions themselves have become more outspoken in their
critiques of policies of member nations. In its report, the IMF
scolded the United States, Europe and Japan. Those economic powers
say they want to help poor countries, but they are hurting them by
subsidizing overproduction of grain and cotton at home, according to
the IMF.</TE>
<TE>   The fund offered an equally pointed assessment of forces weighing
on the world economy. Besides scandals involving U.S. chief
executives, it cited the burgeoning U.S. trade deficit, Europe's
inflexible labor markets and Japan's reform-resistant banking sector.</TE>
<TE>   Rogoff told reporters there was no "magic elixir" that could cure
the ailing economies of Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   The European Union, he said, "needs to decide whether it's going
to be a locomotive in the world economy or a caboose."</TE>
<TE>   Offering unsolicited advice to U.S. policymakers, the IMF said
that more interest rate cuts might be needed to keep the global
recovery from faltering and that future tax hikes may be required to
prevent the federal debt from ballooning.</TE>
<TE>   Although the IMF does not expect the global recovery to stall, it
said growth could be slowed by additional stock market declines, a
rapid dollar depreciation or a spike in oil prices accompanying U.S.
military action in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The fund said Argentina is experiencing an economic contraction of
"unprecedented magnitude."</TE>
<TE>   But it expressed confidence that market anxiety about Brazil's
financial stability would subside after the election of a new
president in October.</TE>
<TE>   The fund's optimism was challenged by the Center for Economic
Policy and Research in Washington. The think tank issued a study
concluding that Brazil ultimately will be forced to default on its
public debt, no matter who wins next month's elections.</TE>
<TE>   "Not since the fall meetings of 1997, when financial crisis was
spreading through Asia, have the IMF and World Bank convened on the
brink of such a large potential policy failure," said economist Mark
Weisbrot, coauthor of the study.</TE>

<HD>Music Labels Seek Piracy Payback</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: The firms consider whether to sue
Bertelsmann for allegedly helping Napster users.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>A three-year hunt by the major record labels to make someone pay for
the rampant digital piracy on Napster might ultimately lead them to
one of their own.</LD>
<LD>   Several labels and music publishers are debating whether to sue
German media powerhouse Bertelsmann, owner of the BMG label, for
allegedly helping Napster Inc. users infringe song copyrights.</LD>
<LD>   If successful, a lawsuit could fetch as much as $1 billion--the
amount that Napster would be on the hook for if each alleged
copyright violation resulted in a maximum fine of $150,000. That
would dwarf the $90 million Bertelsmann has loaned Napster since
October 2000.</LD>
<TE>   The potentially costly twist stems from evidence recently
unearthed in Napster's Delaware bankruptcy case showing that
Bertelsmann exerted more control over Napster's service than
previously known.</TE>
<TE>   "The recording studios that we represent are looking at the
question of whether or not there can be claims for copyright
infringement that could be brought directly or indirectly against
Bertelsmann," attorney David Stratton said during a bankruptcy
hearing this month. Stratton's clients include A&amp;M and Geffen
Records.</TE>
<TE>   Other lawyers involved in the discussions say the chance of a suit
are better than ever, given the strength of the evidence and
Bertelsmann's deep pockets.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a good deal of sentiment among a number of music
publishers that this is a claim that should be pursued up the chain
against Bertelsmann," one person familiar with the talks said. "The
odds are significantly better than 50-50." A decision could come
within a month, the person said.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers and executives said Vivendi Universal's Universal Music
Group and EMI are among the labels most likely to sue. Because of the
corporate politics involved--including joint ventures by the labels
to put authorized music online--the companies' boards might have to
make the final call.</TE>
<TE>   A Bertelsmann spokeswoman and executives at rival labels declined
to comment. The Recording Industry Assn. of America is staying out of
the fight because it represents BMG and the other labels.</TE>
<TE>   Among the music publishers, the National Music Publishers' Assn.
is a leading candidate to be a plaintiff. Asked about the possibility
of a suit, NMPA attorney Carey Ramos said: "This matter raises
serious issues. We are studying the situation and considering what
action is appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   Now dormant and down to a single employee in Redwood City, Calif.,
Napster was founded in 1999 and pioneered the use of peer-to-peer
technology, which used the Internet to connect tens of millions of
users searching for songs to copy in the unrestricted MP3 format. In
one survey of more than 1,000 Napster users, an expert hired by the
labels found that every subscriber to the free service was offering
to share copyrighted songs.</TE>
<TE>   Napster shut down its service under court pressure in July 2001
and filed for bankruptcy reorganization three months ago.</TE>
<TE>   The labels' resentment against Bertelsmann for keeping Napster
alive surfaced as soon as the owner of BMG and Random House announced
its initial investment nearly two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Loan Kept Napster Up</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Bertelsmann said that the then-undisclosed loan
amount would go toward developing a new, legal version of the
file-swapping phenomenon that respected music copyrights.</TE>
<TE>   But the new evidence shows that much of the initial $60 million
went for operating expenses that kept the pirate system running.</TE>
<TE>   Bertelsmann executive William Sorenson testified in a deposition
last month that although Bertelsmann intended the money to go toward
the legal service, he assumed it also was used for rent and salaries.</TE>
<TE>   And Napster Chief Financial Officer Carolyn Jensen testified that
equipment costs, legal fees and small settlement payments also came
out of the Bertelsmann bankroll.</TE>
<TE>   With the cash infusion, Napster was able to stay in business for
eight more months at the peak of its popularity.</TE>
<TE>   Napster filed for bankruptcy protection before a final judgment
came in the lawsuits against it by record labels and music
publishers. But a judge ruled in granting a preliminary injunction
against Napster that it was likely to be found liable for
contributory and vicarious copyright infringement, and the injunction
was upheld by San Francisco's 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.</TE>
<TE>   A more complicated suit against Bertelsmann might follow along the
same lines, lawyers said.</TE>
<TE>   To establish contributory infringement, the plaintiffs would need
to show that Bertelsmann knew about the Napster users' wrongful
behavior and contributed to it in some way.</TE>
<TE>   Because Bertelsmann's BMG label had sued Napster before the
investment, it will be difficult for Bertelsmann to disavow knowledge
about the problems with its service, the opposing attorneys said.</TE>
<TE>   In one internal memo, then-Bertelsmann Chief Executive Thomas
Middelhoff acknowledged that file-trading by Napster users "has thus
far infringed upon the copyrights of artists and record companies."
Through a spokeswoman, Middelhoff declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   And a task force of executives from Bertelsmann's electronic
commerce group and BMG recommended to Middelhoff just before the loan
that the old Napster stay in operation "in order to provide the
traffic and technology needed to build" a revamped system later.</TE>
<TE>   "Bertelsmann knew the money was being used to continue to run the
infringing service until the legal service could be developed,"
concluded music publishers' attorney Andrew Rosenberg.</TE>
<TE>   Experts said Bertelsmann could argue that Middelhoff isn't a
lawyer, mitigating the damage from his memo. And they said BMG's
lawsuit might not establish definitively that Bertelsmann knew
Napster's users were lawbreakers.</TE>
<TE>   "Notwithstanding the documents, that's not a slam dunk either
way," said Wayne State University law professor Jessica Litman, who
helped draft a friend-of-the-court brief on Napster's behalf two
years ago. At the time of the initial Bertelsmann funding, she
pointed out, the appeals court had not approved the injunction, so
many were arguing that it was legitimate.</TE>
<TE>   To establish vicarious liability, the plaintiffs would have to
show that Bertelsmann controlled the activity of Napster users and
benefited from it financially. The judge in the 1999 lawsuit
determined that Napster had "supervisory control" because it steered
users to what they were looking for and could bar specific users or
songs.</TE>
<TE>   Data Suggest Control</TE>
<TE>   The new evidence suggests that Bertelsmann had a large degree of
at least general control in the situation, though the Napster board
was dominated by investors from San Francisco's Hummer Winblad
Venture Partners.</TE>
<TE>   Napster finance chief Jensen testified that she was unable to get
a bank loan, even to buy new equipment, before Bertelsmann rode to
the rescue with a loan at 3 percentage points below the prime rate.</TE>
<TE>   "If Bertelsmann had come in and said, 'You can have the money, but
shut it down today,' they would have had no choice," an attorney
working on the matter said.</TE>
<TE>   One Napster executive who left the firm this year said of the
other labels, "They could definitely make a case. There was a lot of
control."</TE>
<TE>   Proving financial gain might be more difficult. Yet the initial
Napster rulings set a low threshold. U.S. District Judge Marilyn
Patel determined that Napster benefited financially because its worth
as a private company increased with the additional traffic brought in
by purloined material.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, the labels could argue that Bertelsmann's loan--which
was convertible into a majority equity stake--was worth more as
traffic soared into the tens of millions of users.</TE>
<TE>   Loan Questioned</TE>
<TE>   The new evidence came to light as music publishers and the record
labels sought to block Bertelsmann from including its loans in the
overall value of its bid to buy Napster's assets this month. They
argued that the loan was disguised equity because it was convertible
into stock and was designed to avoid the greater potential liability
of a part-owner.</TE>
<TE>   Bankruptcy Judge Peter Walsh hasn't ruled on that point. Instead,
he blocked Bertelsmann's plan because Napster's last CEO, Konrad
Hilbers, appeared to be too close to his former colleagues at
Bertelsmann during the sale negotiations. Walsh noted he could have
blocked the sale for other reasons.</TE>
<TE>   The next skirmish most likely will come in the same Delaware
court, where Bertelsmann is expected to seek much of the proceeds
from the sale of Napster's assets to the highest bidder. Because
Bertelsmann's loans were secured by those assets, the company is
still first in line as a creditor.</TE>
<TE>   But other creditors, including the frustrated record label
plaintiffs from the 1999 suits against Napster, plan to object,
citing the evidence of collusion that might later be displayed in a
new federal lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   If they do file a separate suit, copyright law permits
infringement victims to collect either actual damages or statutory
damages, which can rise as high as $150,000 per work infringed if the
violations are found to be willful. The music publishers alone warned
Napster that 90,000 works were being infringed, for a potential total
of more than $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Judges have wide discretion to set lower awards, and the new, more
conservative leadership at Bertelsmann might also be willing to
strike a bargain and settle.</TE>

<HD>Abortion Pill Sales Below Expectations</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Danco Laboratories said 100,000 women have used its abortion pill
since it become available in November 2000. The figures confirm
anecdotal reports that few women seeking abortions choose the pill
and few doctors offer it.</LD>
<LD>   The pill, sold as Mifeprex in the United States but better known
by its European trade name, RU-486, has been used in fewer than 4% of
abortions in the U.S. since its introduction.</LD>
<LD>   According to Danco, abortion clinics account for 83% of its sales.
It is the first time that Danco, a closely held New York company, has
provided sales figures.</LD>
<TE>   The pill has fallen short of early expectations for it. Feminists
who brought the pill to the United States from Europe predicted that
it would make abortion widely available outside clinics, where women
often face harassment. But the pill is expensive, requires up to
three office visits and, if it fails, must be followed with a
surgical abortion.</TE>
<TE>   A surgical abortion is $75 to $100 cheaper than a pill-induced
procedure, involves a single office visit and is over in minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Danco remains optimistic about the pill. The company said it is
beginning to make inroads with private physicians and that the pace
of sales is increasing.</TE>

<HD>Shipping Lines, Dockworkers Differ on Status of Port Talks</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shipping lines late Wednesday said they reached a breakthrough in
contract negotiations with union dockworkers, but the union issued a
news release complaining that the talks had been fruitless.</LD>
<LD>   Officials with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union
could not be reached for comment. A spokesman for the Pacific
Maritime Assn., which represents shipping lines and terminal
operators at West Coast ports, said he was unable to explain the
apparent contradiction.</LD>
<LD>   Negotiations on a contract covering 29 West Coast ports began more
than four months ago. The main point of contention has been over the
introduction of technology, such as sensors and scanners, that would
eliminate hundreds of union jobs on the docks. The union and
employers' have been unable to agree on a system for resolving
disputes over the technology, with the union wanting veto power and
the PMA wanting an arbitrator to have the final word.</LD>
<TE>   The PMA said a negotiating subcommittee agreed to give the
arbitrator final authority. "This could be the critical milestone to
move these negotiations to a conclusion," PMA President Joseph
Miniace said.</TE>
<TE>   The PMA said union negotiators asked for a recess to analyze the
deal.</TE>
<TE>   However, in a news release the union said the subcommittee had
"produced no substantive agreement due to the unwillingness of the
PMA to bargain."</TE>
<TE>   The statement by the union said it hoped "to be back in
negotiations with the PMA in the near future with the goal of
agreeing on a contract as soon as possible."</TE>
<TE>   The two sides agreed that they remain far apart on two issues.</TE>
<TE>   The union wants minimum staffing levels written into the contract
and the PMA has refused. The union also wants the PMA to move certain
key planning jobs into the union's jurisdiction.</TE>

<HD>Farmers to Stop Selling Home Policies in Texas</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Bloomberg News</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Farmers Insurance Group of Cos. said it is getting out of Texas.</LD>
<LD>   The insurer said it will not sell or renew homeowners policies in
the Lone Star state because regulators there won't let it raise
premiums to offset the $1.3 billion in claims paid over the last 18
months.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles-based insurer will stop renewing home policies as
of Nov. 1, affecting about 700,000 policyholders. Farmers said it
will continue selling auto, flood, commercial and life policies in
Texas.</LD>
<TE>   The company said the Texas Department of Insurance has made
"unreasonable demands" and has refused to accept actuarial evidence
justifying rate increases and policy term changes.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers, which lost a $30-million Texas court case over water and
mold damage claims in August 2001, sought to exclude such claims from
future coverage.</TE>

<LD>* Power company Allegheny Energy Inc. said it was suing investment
bank Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. for a breach of confidence and fraud related
to a transaction between the two groups last year. Allegheny, in a
suit filed in the Supreme Court of New York, charged Merrill with
inflating revenue at its energy-trading business, which Allegheny
bought from the investment bank. The suit comes a day after Merrill
said it was suing Allegheny for not paying $115 million as part of an
agreement to buy the business.</LD>
<LD>   * James Copeland, a vociferous opponent of accounting industry
reform, will step down in May as head of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu,
the world's No. 2 accounting firm, and its U.S. partnership. A
replacement was not immediately named.</LD>
<LD>   * Vanguard Airlines Inc. rejected a buyout offer from a group of
investors headed by the owner of restaurant chain Hooters.</LD>
<TE>   * Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc., the largest U.S. household-goods
retailer, said second- quarter profit rose 40% to $75.5 million, or
25 cents a share, from $54 million, or 18 cents, a year earlier.
Sales rose 27% to $903 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Handspring Inc., a Mountain View, Calif., maker of hand-held
computers, fired about 80 workers, or 20% of its worldwide work
force, as part of an effort to reduce costs and become profitable as
sales decline.</TE>
<TE>   * Resources Connection Inc. reported net income of $2.5 million,
or 11 cents a share, for its fiscal first quarter, a 42% drop from
$4.3 million, or 19 cents, for last year's first quarter. The Costa
Mesa professional services firm posted revenue of $43.5 million for
the quarter ended Aug. 31, down 12% from last year.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>LJM2 Co-Investment, an Enron Corp. partnership used to keep debt off
the energy trader's books, said it filed for bankruptcy protection in
the face of lawsuits seeking to recoup at least $70 million in loans.</LD>
<LD>   LJM2 officials said they filed for Chapter 11 protection in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Dallas because of suits brought earlier this year
by a unit of Dresdner Bank and other lenders over the partnership's
failure to pay back loans.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuits contend LJM2 investors removed Michael J. Kopper, the
former Enron executive who ran the entity, and illegally changed the
partnership agreement to get out of having to repay the loans.</LD>
<TE>   Kopper pleaded guilty in August to fraud and money laundering in
connection with financial maneuverings that led to Enron's bankruptcy
filing in December.</TE>

<HD>American Changes Ticket System</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James F. Peltz</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>American Airlines unveiled a program to make its lowest Web fares
available to conventional travel agents both as a way to sell more
seats and eventually cut its ticket-distribution costs.</LD>
<LD>   The AMR Corp. unit said cheap fares previously limited to
American's Internet site, and to selected Web sites such as Orbitz
Inc., would now be available to agencies that sign up for the
five-year EveryFare program.</LD>
<LD>   In turn, the agents would potentially shoulder some of the booking
fees that American now pays third-party reservations systems, such as
Sabre Holdings Corp., used by the agents. The agents might eventually
be able to book directly through American's Web site, which also
would drive down American's distribution costs.</LD>
<TE>   The program is the latest effort by American to slash more than $1
billion from its annual operating expenses to survive the slump in
travel and stem its massive financial losses.</TE>
<TE>   The move also is meant to satisfy corporate travel managers who
complained that they didn't have access to American's cheapest prices
at a time when passengers--especially business travelers--are
increasingly looking for lower fares in the face of the weak economy.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, American said it raised $617 million from selling
bonds secured by its aircraft. AMR's stock, which had been hammered
in recent days, rebounded 60 cents, or 17%, to $4.20 a share on the
New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Hartford Financial Services Group Inc., St. Paul Cos. and Royal
Indemnity Co. are liable for coverage of one attack on the World
Trade Center, not two as the leaseholder for the complex claims, a
U.S. judge said.</LD>
<LD>   The three insurers are among 22 battling an attempt by trade
center leaseholder Larry Silverstein to collect $7.1 billion for the
destruction of the twin towers. Silverstein was insured for $3.55
billion "per occurrence." It wasn't immediately clear how the ruling
would affect the other 19 insurers since each issued its own binder
to Silverstein, laying out the terms of coverage.</LD>
<LD>   A trial to assess whether the attack was one or two events for
insurance purposes is scheduled to begin Nov. 4. Hartford, St. Paul
and Royal Indemnity, which must pay $112 million, will not face
trial.</LD>

now demand may be dropping.</DH>

<LD>People stick all kinds of junk into self-storage centers. Now, many
centers are becoming junk themselves.</LD>
<LD>   In an example straight out of Economics 101, supply is now
outstripping demand in the self-storage industry, dragging down a
business that once seemed practically recession-proof.</LD>
<LD>   In a humbling setback, Glendale-based Public Storage Inc. was
forced earlier this year to roll back its prices after a sharp
increase in 2001 prompted customers to store their stuff in cheaper
facilities being built by an ever-growing number of rivals.</LD>
<TE>   "Our timing was not very good," acknowledged Harvey Lenkin,
president of Public Storage, the industry leader with about 1,500
locations nationwide. "We began to be impacted by our competitors
offering incoming specials and discounts."</TE>
<TE>   Across the country, the number of storage facilities has shot up
by more than 60% in the last decade to 35,176 properties, according
to MiniCo Inc.'s Self-Storage Almanac. Officials at the publication
said they had no figures for California specifically, but industry
executives say the pace of growth in the state has been equally
swift. There are about 6,000 storage centers statewide, with more
than half of them in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Certain spots in Southern California are especially overbuilt.
Construction of self- storage centers has surged in such places as
north Orange County, the San Fernando Valley and the Inland Empire.
And since storage centers draw from a fairly small geographic area,
it doesn't take much to throw a market out of whack.</TE>
<TE>   In La Habra, for instance, the managers of a Shurgard Storage Inc.
center must compete with a new A-1 Self Storage center, while a new
Public Storage facility goes up just down the street.</TE>
<TE>   "The business environment is difficult," said Jim McNamee,
regional vice president for Seattle-based Shurgard, the nation's
second-largest self- storage provider. The company's facilities in
Southern California, he added, "have certainly seen erosion in rates
and occupancy over the past year."</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, self-storage executives have bragged that their
business was immune to the ups and downs of the economy. That's
because demand seemed to be driven primarily by milestones in
consumers' lives--new jobs, unemployment, divorce and births--that
remained constant. But now, industry representatives say, there are
even signs that besides supply shooting up too fast, demand may be
slackening.</TE>
<TE>   For example, calls from potential customers to Public Storage and
other companies began to decline at the end of last year as the
booming housing market moved many families from apartments to more
spacious homes. Industry executives estimate that self-storage
occupancy rates in Southern California have dropped as much as 10%
from year-ago levels.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the cutthroat environment, some insist that the right
location can still make self-storage a lucrative business. In the
rapidly growing Inland Empire, executives of real estate firm Empire
Cos. said they had no qualms about nearly doubling its number of
self-storage units. The occupancy rate remains above 95% even though
the company has raised rents.</TE>
<TE>   "We like the business," said James Brooks, president of Empire's
commercial real estate division. "It's a business of collecting
rents."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the relative ease of building and operating
self-storage centers and the entrepreneurial nature of the
business--the top 100 operators control less than 15% of the
industry--continue to attract newcomers.</TE>
<TE>   It takes only about $3 million to $5 million to build a typical
suburban storage center that--thanks to minimal construction and
staffing costs--can break even if it is only 30% occupied, according
to industry analysts. Owners of favorably located centers can reap
rents on a per-square-foot basis that equal those of apartments but
without the high maintenance and investment costs.</TE>
<TE>   Enticed by these fundamentals, many go into the business with big
dreams, determined to become the next B. Wayne Hughes.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes, an industry pioneer and Public Storage co-founder, ranks
as one of California's richest individuals, with a net worth
estimated at about $1.6 billion. At this week's Inside Self Storage
Expo, a large industry convention in Orlando, Fla., one of the
seminars is titled "Who Wants to Be a Self-Storage Millionaire?"</TE>
<TE>   But too many would-be millionaires are clearly bad for the
industry.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too easy to get into the business," said Irvine real estate
investment manager Robert M. Campbell, whose CT Realty is investing
in self-storage centers. "That gets everybody and their grandmother
into self-storage."</TE>
<TE>   The difficult conditions have prompted some to become more
cautious. For its part, Public Storage plans to add only about 35 new
locations this year, which, the company notes, is a small increase
over its existing portfolio.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to play conservatively," said Lance Watkins, head of
Storage Outlet, which operates a small chain in Southern California.
"I'm ready to pass on certain sites to make sure we're building at
the right locations. I think the yellow [warning] light is on and
strong on overbuilding."</TE>

<HD>United's Unions Offer Pay-Cut Plan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Unions for UAL Corp.'s United Airlines late Wednesday proposed $5
billion in labor-cost savings over the next five years to help the
beleaguered carrier stay out of bankruptcy proceedings.</LD>
<LD>   The coalition of unions at United--the nation's second-largest
airline behind AMR Corp.'s American and the biggest operator at Los
Angeles International Airport--didn't disclose how much each employee
group would sacrifice and that it was still to be worked out. But it
said a viable recovery plan would have to include "significant" cost
cutting by management.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed reduction represents a 14% cut from United's labor
costs in 2001, when the carrier lost an industry record $2.1 billion
amid the protracted slump in travel.</LD>
<TE>   In August, United proposed slashing its labor costs by $1.5
billion a year, or 21%, for the next six years. The airline, based in
Elk Grove Village, Ill., warned that without cuts it would face a
cash squeeze later this year, wouldn't qualify for a $1.8-billion
federal loan guarantee it's seeking and might have to reorganize
under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws.</TE>
<TE>   But that plan met stiff resistance from unions for United's
pilots, mechanics, flight attendants and other ground workers. Along
with two other unions, they began forming an alternative
cost-reduction package, which they delivered to new UAL Chief
Executive Glenn Tilton on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "Now United can successfully amend its application for a loan
guarantee ... get access to near-term financing, avoid bankruptcy and
rebuild," said Greg Davidowitch, president of the United master
executive council at the Assn. of Flight Attendants.</TE>
<TE>   United said "we appreciate this quick but thorough effort" by the
unions and said it would have a response soon in order to finalize
its loan-guarantee application.</TE>
<TE>   United, with 84,000 employees and 1,900 daily flights, is 55%
owned by its workers. Its pilots' and mechanics' unions also have
seats on UAL's board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   The unions' announcement came after the close of markets. UAL's
stock edged up 9 cents, to $2.21 a share, on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Vans Reports Profit Off 52% in 1st Quarter</HD>
<DH>Earnings: The company says the key problem was falling
sales of its women's shoes. Decline in attendance at its skate parks
also hurts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE EARNEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shoemaker Vans Inc., which has been struggling to improve both its
products and the financial performance of its indoor skate parks,
said Wednesday that earnings plunged 52% in its fiscal first quarter
as sales of its women's shoes dropped 40%.</LD>
<LD>   Still, the Santa Fe Springs-based company managed to beat Wall
Street's already lowered expectations by a nickel.</LD>
<LD>   In the first quarter ended Aug. 31, profit was $5.4 million, or 30
cents a share, compared with $11.3 million, or 61 cents, in the same
period last year. Analysts polled by Thomson First Call were
expecting earnings of 25 cents a share.</LD>
<TE>   Vans' sales increased 5.5% to $124.6 million, from $118.1 million
in the first quarter of last year. Sales at stores open at least a
year, a key industry indicator, declined 4.9%.</TE>
<TE>   Vans' stock closed Wednesday at $6.31, up 11 cents, in Nasdaq
trading. The stock has lost 50% of its value this year. The earnings
report was released after the market closed.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive Gary H. Schoenfeld said sales have fallen off this
month after improving somewhat in August. Schoenfeld said this is
baffling because the current month is being compared to September
2001, which was battered by the repercussions of the terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be honest, I'm a bit stumped," Schoenfeld told analysts
during a conference call. "I think there's a lot of people that are
more than a bit surprised that September isn't stronger against the
post-Sept. 11 comparisons, that people aren't seeing gains."</TE>
<TE>   The key problem for Vans in the first quarter was the falling
sales of its women's shoes, Schoenfeld said. Vans expects new
products will halt the sales slide in the second half of the fiscal
year, he said.</TE>
<TE>   A continued decline in attendance at its skate parks created
additional difficulty for Vans, which is struggling with increasing
competition from free public skate parks.</TE>
<TE>   In California alone, about 200 public skate parks have been built
since 1996, said Heidi Lemmon, executive director of Skate Park Assn.
of the USA in Venice.Combined first-quarter losses at its skate parks
was about $300,000, Vans said. For the remainder of the fiscal year,
the company expects the parks will drain 10 cents to 15 cents from
per-share earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Vans began opening the parks four years ago, scoring points with
skateboarders who began buying more of the company's shoes. Vans now
has 12 skate parks nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   However, the company plans to close an under-performing park in
Bakersfield within the next six months and is delaying the opening of
a park in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not pleased with the trends we're seeing," Schoenfeld said.</TE>
<TE>   He acknowledged that it is possible more parks could close but
said the company has not analyzed that option. "It's possible, but I
think that's premature and something I can't speak to very
specifically," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The last year has been a tough one for the 36-year-old company,
which saw its annual sales drop in the fiscal year that ended May 31
for the first time in eight years.</TE>
<TE>   Vans also stated for the first time its expectations for the rest
of the fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   For the second quarter, the company said it expects to lose about
20 cents a share on sales of about $60 million to $65 million.</TE>
<TE>   For the second half of the year, Vans expects income to range
between a loss of 10 cents a share to a profit of 10 cents a share,
and sales between $145 million and $155 million.</TE>
<TE>   Vans operates 169 namesake stores in the U.S. and Europe. Its
distribution network includes surf and skate shops, and large chains,
such as Pacific Sunwear, Footlocker, J.C. Penney and Nordstrom.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi Shakes Up Board, Denies Messier's Severance</HD>
<DH>Media: CEO Fourtou derides his predecessor and announces
the resignation of six directors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER and CORIE BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vivendi Universal's new chief executive, Jean-Rene Fourtou, has
figured out how to save his debt-heavy multinational conglomerate
nearly $20 million: He's vowing not to pay a dime in severance to his
free-spending predecessor.</LD>
<LD>   Following a board meeting in Paris, Fourtou departed from his
widely expected presentation on the company's future to take a harsh
look back at former CEO Jean-Marie Messier, who spent billions of
dollars buying Universal's entertainment assets in Los Angeles and
New York.</LD>
<LD>   "He enjoyed making deals too much and overpaid," Fourtou told
reporters. "This all went to his head.... I decided nothing would be
paid to Jean-Marie Messier, upon advice of lawyers."</LD>
<TE>   The normally understated Fourtou--unlike the flamboyant
Messier--said he has been inundated with letters and e-mails from
shareholders who have seen the value of their holdings fall 80% this
year as the company became buried in debt resulting from its
acquisitions.</TE>
<TE>   "We are traumatized by what happened," Fourtou said.</TE>
<TE>   Messier could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Fourtou, 63, also announced that six board members resigned--four
of them tied to Messier and his failed strategy for transforming the
water utility into the world's second-largest media company.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Vivendi said the move was intended to streamline
the board to 12 members from 18 and bring it into compliance with new
U.S. and European governance standards. A source close to the board
described the resignations as "a housecleaning."</TE>
<TE>   Among the outgoing board members was attorney Samuel Minzberg, who
unlike other resigning directors was a fierce critic of Messier.
Minzberg represents part of the Bronfman family, the company's
largest shareholders. Sources close to the board say Minzberg had
antagonized many colleagues with his confrontational style and
repeated rebukes of the company's French directors for not acting as
swiftly as he wanted. Minzberg could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Even with Minzberg's departure, the Bronfmans have two strong
voices on the board: Edgar Bronfman and his son, Edgar Bronfman Jr.
The younger Bronfman built Universal Music Group into the world's
largest music company and was responsible for the studio until his
family sold the business to Vivendi two years ago for $34 billion.
During the last year, he has exerted his influence mostly through his
position on the board.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, CEO Fourtou said he had asked Bronfman to take a
more hands-on role with executives in Universal's music, movie and
theme park divisions.</TE>
<TE>   "Now the real work starts," Bronfman said, adding that he would
help the management "try to determine how these businesses grow and
prosper--hopefully intact." In the meantime, the board is preparing a
new financial incentive program because executives' stock options are
worthless after the plunge of the company's share price.</TE>
<TE>   The future of the entertainment assets has been the big question
in Hollywood since Messier's downfall. There has been speculation
about spinoffs, sales and partnerships. After emerging from the
two-hour board meeting at Vivendi's headquarters near the Arc de
Triomphe, Fourtou answered the question--sort of. He said that during
the next two years, Vivendi would remain an international
entertainment company "whether we like it or not."</TE>
<TE>   Fourtou said the time was wrong for moving forward with any
ambitious sales or reorganizations because of depressed market
conditions for media companies. Some change, he said, inevitably
would come in the partnership between Vivendi and many of its
entertainment properties overseen by Hollywood mogul Barry Diller.</TE>
<TE>   "We both know that in the long term, things are going to have to
be unwound, but for the moment it's in our interests to keep it
moving as it is," Fourtou said. "[Diller's] contribution is very
valuable, but it can't last in the long term.... We're both aware of
that."</TE>
<TE>   Fourtou did not elaborate on his statement.</TE>
<TE>   "They are purposely keeping things tight-lipped to see what they
can buy and sell," said Michael Nathanson, an analyst with Sanford C.
Bernstein &amp; Co. "These guys have a menu of problems, and at the
bottom of the list is what to do with Vivendi Universal
Entertainment."</TE>
<TE>   Among those problems is what to do about Vivendi Environnement ,
France's largest water supplier. The government there has insisted
that the company not sell its 40% stake to a foreign buyer. On
Wednesday, Fourtou again was vague about the issue. Responding to
reports that he would put the utility on the block, he would only
say: "I never said I wanted to sell."</TE>
<TE>   Fourtou had hoped to be able to present the board with a
comprehensive strategy for refashioning Vivendi. But he said reality
intruded. In his 45-minute conference with reporters, he stressed
that he was confronted with financial problems so severe that they
consumed all his attention.</TE>
<TE>   "I had planned to do a good job and work in a serene environment
in order to be ready for the Sept. 25 meeting," Fourtou said. "In
fact, on the very first day I was confronted with a dramatic crisis
which was about as unexpected as it was violent."</TE>
<TE>   Two hours into his job, Fourtou said, he received a call from
Moody's Investors Service informing him that Vivendi's debt rating
was being lowered to "junk" status because of the company's
$19-billion media-related debt.</TE>
<TE>   The Moody's action prompted some creditors to demand that their
loans immediately be paid before the situation deteriorated further.
"I was fighting fires daily just so we could survive," Fourtou said.</TE>
<TE>   In the next two months, Fourtou said, he and his new management
team worked frantically with an army of bankers and lawyers to keep
the company afloat. Last week, Vivendi succeeded in persuading its
bankers to provide a nearly $3-billion loan to meet its cash needs
for this year.</TE>
<TE>   With the liquidity crisis "nearly solved," he said, the challenge
now is to raise billions more in asset sales to lower the debt.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm working for [Vivendi Universal] shareholders who lost all
their money, especially those who lost all their life savings."</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Vivendi signed a deal to sell its money-losing
Italian pay-TV operation Telepiu to Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. for
about $976 million.</TE>

<LD>Walt Disney Co. announced Wednesday that its ABC network would
broadcast in high-definition television the Super Bowl in January,
next summer's National Basketball Assn. finals and the Stanley Cup.
ABC also will begin digitally broadcasting "Monday Night Football"
next year, said ABC network President Alex Wallau.</LD>
<LD>   Disney's ESPN network simultaneously announced that it plans to
launch in April a high-definition simulcast service, called ESPN HD,
which will include 100 live telecasts of select games of the NBA,
major league baseball, National Football League and the National
Hockey League. ESPN HD also will provide cable and satellite
providers high-definition coverage of college championship basketball
tournaments as well as the X Games, Great Outdoors Games and the ESPY
Awards.</LD>
<LD>   Beginning in 2004, ESPN HD will include most studio shows,
including SportsCenter, and an additional 3,700 hours of originally
produced HDTV programming, said ESPN President George Bodenheimer.</LD>
<TE>   High-definition provides a more detailed picture and
higher-quality sound than current broadcast formats. This fall, ABC
is broadcasting most of its scripted series shows in HDTV, including
"NYPD Blue," "The Practice," "8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage
Daughter," "Life with Bonnie" and "Push, Nevada."</TE>

<HD>Proposed Digital TV Deadline Is Criticized</HD>
<DH>Legislation: Lawmakers say a plan that would make analog
sets obsolete probably won't make it into final bill.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A controversial proposal to jump-start digital television by making
most existing TVs obsolete by 2007 was panned Wednesday by lawmakers
and industry officials, strongly suggesting that the idea will not
make it into the final bill.</LD>
<LD>   Draft legislation, circulated last week by the staff of Rep. W.J.
"Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), recommended that the government order TV
broadcasters to stop sending analog signals, the current norm, and
shift to digital TV transmissions by Dec. 31, 2006. If adopted,
millions of Americans would have to buy new TVs or expensive
equipment to receive the digital signals, which won't work on analog
sets.</LD>
<LD>   "The end of analog signals in 2006 would also be the end of most
of our political careers," said Rep. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), adding
that consumer outrage over such a plan would be immense.</LD>
<TE>   Gene Kimmelman, senior director of Consumers Union, said, "Such a
requirement would place the digital changeover squarely on the backs
of consumers."</TE>
<TE>   Even Tauzin, who is chairman of the House Commerce Committee, and
the ranking Democrat, Rep. John D. Dingell of Michigan, expressed
reservations about setting a firm conversion deadline. Current law
sets 2006 as a target date for broadcasters to switch to digital, but
it permits a delay if fewer than 85% of homes have digital sets.</TE>
<TE>   Tauzin said Americans would not be required to buy new TVs until
broadcasters began offering more compelling digital programming, such
as high-definition TV or interactive features. "If all they get is
the same old TV, consumers are going to be asking, 'Why did you make
me buy this new box?' " Tauzin said.</TE>
<TE>   However, lawmakers said they would continue to push various
industries to accelerate the rollout of digital TV, largely because
the government wants to reclaim billions of dollars' worth of analog
spectrum. Rep. Jane Harman (D-Venice) said the spectrum is urgently
needed to improve wireless communications for emergency workers.</TE>
<TE>   Other provisions of the draft bill received broader support,
including a provision that would require cable TV companies to adopt
nationwide technical standards. That would clear the way for the sale
of digital TVs that do not need set-top boxes, and of set-top boxes
that could be used on any cable system in the country, eliminating
the need for consumers to rent or buy boxes each time they move.</TE>
<TE>   A formal bill is not expected to be introduced for several months.</TE>

<HD>Sales of Existing Homes Drop 1.7% in August</HD>
<DH>Economy: Data suggest consumer confidence is waning amid
job pressures and plunging stocks, analysts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Sales of U.S. existing homes fell 1.7% in August, a national real
estate trade association said Wednesday, as home buying settled from
record levels earlier in the year.</LD>
<LD>   Sales of previously owned homes slid to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 5.28 million units from an upwardly revised 5.37
million pace in July, the National Assn. of Realtors said.</LD>
<LD>   The August sales level fell short of the expectations of analysts
polled by Reuters who, on average, had expected a 5.4-million-unit
pace.</LD>
<TE>   "It's still a very healthy pace, but certainly we are winding down
from the boom," NAR chief economist David Lereah said.</TE>
<TE>   But other analysts said the data show signs consumer confidence is
beginning to crack in the face of job pressures, tumbling stock
markets and the prospect of war with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "Even with low interest rates, if jobs and the economy stay weak,
and risks to balance sheets from the bad stock market and
international risks remain, I think we're going to see hesitation in
buying big ticket items like homes," said Allen Sinai, chief
economist for Decision Economics.</TE>
<TE>   Home-buying levels surpassed a 5.7 million sales pace in four of
the first five months of 2002, but have been below the 5.4 million
pace for the last three months. Lereah said his forecast is for home
sales to hit more than 5.4 million units for the year, breaking last
year's record of 5.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   But Sinai said that outcome would reflect the performance of the
first half of the year, not the slowing trend.</TE>
<TE>   "The housing area has begun to soften and will weaken more as we
move through the autumn and into next year," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Housing has been thriving even as much of the economy has stayed
lackluster in the aftermath of last year's recession. Buyers have
taken advantage of the lowest rates in over four decades to buy,
refinance and remodel homes.</TE>
<TE>   Rates on the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage hit new lows this week.
The Mortgage Bankers Assn. said Wednesday that rates dipped to 5.85%,
the lowest since the MBA began tracking rates in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Still, in spite of attractive rates and the volatile stock market,
housing is feeling the effect of the uncertain U.S. economic
recovery, Lereah said.</TE>
<TE>   "We could not sustain a record-setting pace. The economy is still
sluggish," he said. But rising mortgage applications and deeper
inventories are signs home sales will continue at a strong level, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The median house price rose to $163,600 in August from $162,500
the preceding month, and was up 6.4% from August a year ago, NAR
said. Inventories also rose. There were 2.2 million homes for sale in
August, or a five months' supply at current sales rates, up from a
4.7 months supply in July.</TE>
<TE>   Existing-home sales rose 2.2% in the West, but fell 1.8% in the
South, 5.9% in the Midwest, and 1.6% in the Northeast.</TE>

<HD>Profit Forecasts Boost Stocks</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Dow racks up its biggest one-day gain in six
weeks as investors fuel a strong rally. But some analysts remain
skeptical.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks leaped off multiyear lows Wednesday after General Electric
helped calm worries about the U.S. economy and corporate earnings
with a reassuring profit forecast.</LD>
<LD>   GE helped push the Dow Jones industrials to their biggest one-day
gain in almost six weeks, one day after they sank to a four-year low.
Technology investors took heart after wireless chip maker RF Micro
Devices raised its outlook for earnings and revenue, helping lift the
Nasdaq composite index off six-year lows.</LD>
<LD>   But some market watchers remained skeptical as they fretted about
a possible U.S. war on Iraq and concerns over the fragile economic
recovery, the primary reasons why September is on track to be the
worst month for the market this year.</LD>
<TE>   "We got a nice bounce after hitting a four-year low, but I don't
expect this to be the start of a turnaround," said Stephen Carl, head
of U.S. equity trading for Williams Capital Group. "There's still too
much uncertainty over the third-quarter earnings outlook and the
prospects for war."</TE>
<TE>   The Dow climbed 158.69 points, or 2.1%, to 7,841.82. The Dow
dropped 2.4% on Tuesday, pulling it down to its lowest point since
October 1998. Even including a small gain on Friday, the Dow had lost
almost 500 points over the previous four trading sessions.</TE>
<TE>   The technology-laden Nasdaq composite shot up 40.12 points, or
3.4%, to 1,222.29, after falling Tuesday to its lowest close since
September 1996. The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index surged 20.37
points, or 2.5%, to 839.66. The benchmark S&amp;P remains about 5% above
the five-year low it reached in July.</TE>
<TE>   Winners trounced losers by almost 3 to 1 on the New York Stock
Exchange and by nearly 2 to 1 on Nasdaq. Trading was heavy.</TE>
<TE>   GE climbed $1.10 to $27 after it said third-quarter earnings are
on track to rise at least 20%--good news at a time when many
companies are slashing outlooks.</TE>
<TE>   Rival and fellow Dow component United Technologies added to the
positive mood after it reaffirmed its 2002 earnings outlook. Its
shares gained $1.66 to $57.64.</TE>
<TE>   Pension fund managers and other investors who are required to keep
a set percentage of their portfolios' value in stocks helped drive
Wednesday's rally, said David Guy, who helps manage $20 billion at J.
&amp; W. Seligman &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   After the S&amp;P 500 plunged to a five-year low in July, Guy bought
stocks to bring the equities portion of the stock-and-bond fund he
runs up to its required 60%. "Such a rally could occur in coming days
[because] the Dow and Nasdaq returned to their July lows," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The rush into stocks pulled money away from gold and Treasury
securities, which have rallied in recent days as investors sought
refuge from war worries and falling stock prices.</TE>
<TE>   Yields on Treasuries had their biggest jump in six weeks as the
yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed to 3.75% after hitting a
40-year low of 3.64% on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "It just shows that it's hard for investors to be excited about
buying Treasuries when yields are at generational lows," said Mike
Ryan, fixed-income strategist at UBS PaineWebber.</TE>
<TE>   Supply issues also weighed on the bond market with the Treasury
auctioning a record-matching $27 billion in new two-year notes. The
sale attracted bids for twice the amount of debt offered, a little
above the average for the year--respectable given that the yield of
1.96% was the lowest for any two-year auction.</TE>
<TE>   The day's economic data were soft, with sales of existing homes
down 1.7% in August, confounding analysts who had looked for a rise.</TE>
<TE>   Gold dropped $3.70 to $322.20 an ounce in New York trading, its
biggest loss in more than five weeks.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights Wednesday:</TE>
<TE>   * RF Micro climbed 15 cents to $6.23 on its positive outlook and
gave a boost to the whole chip sector. The SOX semiconductor index
soared 7% with all 17 members rising. Among the biggest gainers:
Xilinx, up $2.15 to $16.44; KLA-Tencor, up $2.05 to $30.01; and
Novellus Systems, up $1.65 to $22.66.</TE>
<TE>   Other tech winners included IBM, up $3.26 to $63.01, and Cisco
Systems, up 53 cents to $11.96.</TE>
<TE>   * International Paper climbed $1.39 to $33.33 after saying
third-quarter earnings will be in line with estimates. The news came
as a positive surprise after rival Weyerhaeuser said Tuesday that
quarterly profit would lag behind forecasts after struggling with low
wood prices. Weyerhaeuser shares rose $1.04 to $44.83 Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   * Bank stocks rallied. Bank of America gained $1.50 to $63.50,
Comerica rose $1.43 to $48.86 and East West Bancorp jumped $2.32 to
$33.42.</TE>
<TE>   * Beaten-down biotech shares attracted buyers. Amgen rose $1.99 to
$44.06, OSI Pharmaceuticals surged $2.37 to $19.10 and Myriad
Genetics was up $1.68 to $15.52.</TE>

$240 million by a jury that decided the company stole their idea for
its Wide World of Sports Complex at Walt Disney World.</LD>

<LD>   The settlement ended Disney's appeal of the August 2000 verdict
for Palm Harbor, Fla.-based All Pro Sports Camps. All Pro founders
Edward Russell and Nicholas Stracick met with Disney executives in

They showed Disney a model and gave them a business plan.</LD>

within a few years the entertainment giant began crafting the sports
facility that became Wide World of Sports, which opened in 1997.</TE>

<HD>Salomon Seeks Broad Settlement in Probes</HD>
<DH>Brokerage: Firm's lawyers plan to meet with regulators this
week to discuss deal on investigations into IPOs, analyst conduct.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Salomon Smith Barney, beset by high-profile financial scandals, will
propose on Friday a detailed settlement offer to federal regulators
that will include a large fine and structural reform, sources said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The brokerage first approached regulators about a settlement in
mid-August but was told it would have to produce additional documents
regarding its business practices--including the conduct of its
research analysts and how the firm allocated new stock issues in
recent years--before an offer would be considered, the sources said.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal will be made to the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the National Assn. of Securities Dealers and the New York
Stock Exchange at the SEC's offices in Washington. The regulators
have told Salomon that any deal must include a financial penalty and
significant structural reform.</LD>
<TE>   The regulators at the meeting will include Stephen Cutler, the
SEC's enforcement chief; Barry Goldsmith, head of enforcement for
NASD; and David Doherty, who heads NYSE enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   The offer will be "a very serious proposal," said one source.</TE>
<TE>   Federal and state authorities are investigating whether Salomon
analysts in recent years intentionally misled investors with bullish
stock picks aimed primarily at winning investment-banking business.
They're also studying whether the firm doled out coveted initial
public stock offerings to corporate executives to win banking work,
which could violate securities laws.</TE>
<TE>   Salomon, a unit of Citigroup Inc., has signaled its desire to put
the probes behind it. When Citigroup CEO Sanford Weill installed
Charles Prince at Salomon's helm this month, he said in a memo to
employees that Prince's first priority was to "resolve promptly the
particular issues" facing Salomon.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Salomon agreed to pay $5 million to settle NASD charges
that a former star analyst, Jack Grubman, misled investors in hyping
a telecom stock.</TE>
<TE>   A universal settlement would help Salomon by potentially halting
the stream of bad publicity the firm has suffered this year.</TE>
<TE>   A deal also would eliminate the cloud of uncertainty that has hung
over the company, depressing Citigroup's share price. The stock has
plunged 40% this year, double the drop of the average bank stock.</TE>
<TE>   For regulators, a universal settlement could free up limited
personnel and resources for other Wall Street investigations, experts
said. The agencies could claim to have acted quickly, while at the
same time avoiding lengthy legal battles with uncertain outcomes.</TE>
<TE>   Any settlement also could serve as a template for deals with other
brokerage firms.</TE>
<TE>   There is ample precedent for a deal between multiple regulators
and Salomon: Credit Suisse First Boston earlier this year agreed to a
$100-million fine in a joint settlement with the SEC and NASD over
allegations of IPO abuses. And Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in the spring
agreed to pay $100 million to settle stock-analyst fraud allegations
brought by New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer.</TE>
<TE>   In both cases, the brokerages were permitted to settle without
admitting or denying guilt.</TE>
<TE>   But a Salomon settlement could be more difficult because it would
involve several related, though distinct, issues, said Henry Hu, a
University of Texas law professor.</TE>
<TE>   Salomon also would have to reach deals not only with the SEC, NASD
and NYSE, but with Spitzer, whose probe of the firm has been the most
far-reaching.</TE>
<TE>   Prince met Tuesday with Spitzer, sources said. Massachusetts
regulators last week recommended that Spitzer consider bringing
criminal charges against Salomon, alleging a pattern of wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators don't want to give the impression that they are
treading lightly on Wall Street given the firestorm of revelations
over bull-market abuses of investors.</TE>
<TE>   "They'd want to have something people will look at and say, 'the
government did a good job here,' " said John Sturc, a Washington
lawyer and former SEC official.</TE>
<TE>   For Salomon, one of its top priorities is structuring a settlement
that would not increase its vulnerability to the mountain of lawsuits
from private investors, experts said. "They will try very hard to get
the F-word--fraud--left out of charges," said Samuel J. Winer, a
securities-law partner at Foley &amp; Lardner in Washington.</TE>

<HD>FCC Drops Rule Requiring Cell Phone Coverage Area Maps</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Federal regulators have quietly eliminated a rule that required
cellular phone service providers to inform potential customers about
their geographic service areas.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Communications Commission said that in today's
competitive marketplace, the government mandate is no longer needed.
Wireless carriers such as Sprint PCS that were exempt from the
20-year-old rule because they don't use cellular technology have
nevertheless chosen to provide maps that show their coverage areas to
compete with carriers that were required to comply, such as Verizon
Wireless Inc., AT&amp;T Wireless Services Inc. and Cingular Wireless.</LD>
<LD>   "We believe the rule is no longer necessary because, even in the
absence of the rule, cellular carriers will continue to make this
information available while marketing their services in today's
competitive marketplace," the FCC said.</LD>
<TE>   The rule change, which was considered over the last two weeks and
approved Tuesday in a nonpublic vote, becomes effective at the end of
November.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer advocates criticized the FCC decision, which they said
could undermine efforts to improve wireless coverage as providers
slash spending on their networks amid a financial meltdown in the
telecommunications industry.</TE>
<TE>   The change also could have public safety ramifications,
considering the increasingly prominent role wireless phones have
played in search and rescue efforts after national disasters, said
one FCC staff member who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   "Efficient markets depend on consumers getting reliable and
plentiful information," said Chris Murray, legislative counsel for
Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. "It's hard
to see how allowing companies to provide less information makes the
marketplace better for consumers."</TE>
<TE>   With the number of wireless phone subscribers ballooning to more
than 137 million, inadequate cellular phone coverage has emerged as a
key issue among mobile phone users, according to experts. Wireless
providers are putting up an average of 55 new cell sites a day,
according to the Cellular Telecommunications &amp; Internet Assn., a
trade group based in Washington. Yet the Wireless Consumer Alliance
in San Diego says service area coverage and billing problems remain
the wireless industry's top two complaints.</TE>
<TE>   The intense competition to build out wireless networks seems to
support the FCC's determination that the market competition will
improve coverage, even without government mandates.</TE>
<TE>   "Coverage is totally the No. 1 concern of customers," said Verizon
spokesman Jeffrey Nelson. "If your call doesn't go through, you are
going to be unhappy."</TE>
<TE>   Verizon has designed an entire marketing campaign to tout its cell
phone coverage. For months, the company has been airing commercials
featuring a wandering network tester, trudging through mountains and
other remote areas and bellowing into his cell phone: "Can you hear
me now? Good!"</TE>
<TE>   Other carriers, such as Cingular and AT&amp;T, also have begun to
stress their coverage areas. Many have said they will continue to
provide coverage maps after the FCC rules expires in November.</TE>
<TE>   But some experts advise consumers not to put much stock in
coverage maps because most are inaccurate.</TE>
<TE>   "Coverage maps provide very, very rough guidelines and their
correlation with the quality of cellular phone service in a
particular area you might care about, is not great," said Charles
Golvin, a wireless analyst for Forrester Research Inc. in Cambridge,
Mass.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer groups agree that today's maps are inaccurate but say
improving their accuracy should have been the FCC's focus rather than
eliminating the coverage rule.</TE>

<HD>Myers Expected to Plead Guilty</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Reports say former WorldCom controller is
cooperating with the government in its case against former CFO Scott
Sullivan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The former controller of WorldCom Inc., David Myers, is expected to
plead guilty today for his role in the telecommunications company's
accounting scandal, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online
edition.</LD>
<LD>   Myers is expected to plead guilty to two felony counts as part of
a plea bargain and cooperate with the government, the newspaper
reported, citing people familiar with the matter.</LD>
<LD>   WorldCom officials were not available for comment.</LD>
<TE>   The guilty plea, which would be the first in the case against the
telecommunications giant, comes after WorldCom's former chief
financial officer, Scott D. Sullivan, and director of general
accounting, Buford Yates Jr., pleaded not guilty this month to
charges that they directed employees to hide $3.9 billion in expenses
at WorldCom, which owns MCI. WorldCom, which transmits nearly half of
the world's Internet traffic, filed for bankruptcy protection in July
after disclosing that it inflated profit by improperly booking $3.9
billion in expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Less than a week ago, sources said additional accounting errors of
nearly $3 billion had been found. Myers' cooperation, the Journal
said, is expected to be key in the case against Sullivan.</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors, who have spoken to 40 to 50 people, have been
trying to link former Chief Executive Bernard J. Ebbers to the
accounting fraud scheme, sources have said.</TE>
<TE>   After building the Clinton, Miss.-based firm into the nation's No.
2 long-distance company through two decades of mergers, Ebbers was
forced out in April over concerns about declining revenue,
mushrooming debt and questionable accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   Myers was known to have been in plea negotiations with the
government.</TE>
<TE>   For weeks, prosecutors have threatened potential defendants in the
WorldCom case with jail time to get them to cooperate with the
government in bringing additional charges against more senior company
executives, including Ebbers.</TE>
<TE>   The government is said to be weighing several new charges against
Sullivan and possibly other defendants. The charges include insider
trading on nonpublic information, obstruction of justice, perjury and
filing false financial reports.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that WorldCom prosecutors have faced off in court against
drug lords and organized crime groups, some experts say racketeering
charges against some former WorldCom executives also are a
possibility. To prove racketeering, prosecutors would have to show
that WorldCom executives had engaged in a criminal enterprise to
shortchange investors and employees.</TE>
<TE>   The threat of more charges ups the ante in a criminal case that
could have significant repercussions for corporate bookkeeping and
for Wall Street, where negative investor reaction to the scandals has
pummeled stock prices.</TE>

<HD>Tyco Cuts Profit Forecast for the Quarter</HD>
<DH>Earnings: The firm says the move is unrelated to alleged
financial abuses by previous managers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New management of conglomerate Tyco International Ltd. on Wednesday
sharply cut the company's earnings estimate for this quarter but said
the move is unrelated to alleged financial abuses by the previous
management team.</LD>
<LD>   Operating profit in the fourth quarter ending this month will be
30 cents to 33 cents a share, new Chief Executive Edward Breen told
investors on a conference call. Previous management had forecast 45
cents to 47 cents.</LD>
<LD>   Breen said Tyco also will incur costs of as much as $2.5 billion
in the quarter to consolidate its fiber-optic cable business.</LD>
<TE>   The forecast is the first Breen has given since taking over in
July amid charges that former CEO L. Dennis Kozlowski and other
executives looted the company.</TE>
<TE>   Breen on Wednesday tried to reassure investors that liquidity is
stable and debt is manageable, and he said an internal accounting
review isn't showing evidence of inaccuracies or fraud. Tyco's
problems are fundamental, he said: Sales are still slow at the Tycom
undersea cable business and at Tyco's electronics unit.</TE>
<TE>   But sales overall this quarter will match the $9.1 billion of the
previous quarter, Breen said.</TE>
<TE>   Investors responded positively to his comments, pushing the stock
up $1.41 to $15 on the New York Stock Exchange. The price has plunged
75% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Wall Street probably will remain concerned about the
company's future until the accounting review is complete, analysts
said.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, New Hampshire regulators Wednesday sent a letter to
Breen insisting that the nine board members who served under
Kozlowski resign immediately. "It is disingenuous to believe that the
same board that breached its fiduciary duties in exercising oversight
responsibility over certain wayward employees is the best arbiter of
appropriate corporate governance," wrote Mark Connolly, the state's
director of securities regulation.</TE>

<HD>Mortgage Write-Off to Cut Cendant Profit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters, Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Residential real estate and travel firm Cendant Corp. said Wednesday
that its quarterly earnings would be cut by about $175 million
because the mortgage refinancing wave is hurting its loan-servicing
business.</LD>
<LD>   Cendant, whose franchises include Coldwell Banker and Century 21,
said it expected third-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 28
cents, down from its previous estimate of 42 cents.</LD>
<LD>   The $175-million write-off within the New York company's
mortgage-servicing unit will be slightly offset by strength in its
other businesses, including Avis Rent a Car, which has benefited
recently from stronger pricing.</LD>
<TE>   Cendant's stock slumped $1.71, or 13%, to $11.46 on the New York
Stock Exchange, a 52-week low.</TE>
<TE>   Companies that provide mortgage services such as billing
frequently get pinched during refinancing waves because they must
lower the previously booked value of those servicing rights, as loans
are paid off at a faster-than-expected pace.</TE>
<TE>   Cendant said it is adopting a more conservative model to evaluate
and predict the value of mortgage servicing rights.</TE>

<LD>War in Iraq is projected to cost $100 billion to $200 billion. Surely
there are other ways to achieve President Bush's desired
result--removing Saddam Hussein from power, or at least denying him
weapons of mass destruction--with far less money and without the
inevitable human tragedy of a war.</LD>
<LD>   Is there any price at which Saddam Hussein could be bribed to
leave, for example? For $1 billion, or even $5 billion or $10
billion, Hussein might well be persuaded to step down rather than
engage in a war that he's sure to lose.</LD>
<LD>   Could a huge bounty on Hussein's head, say $1 billion or even $10
billion, end his rule without an American invasion that could trigger
his use of whatever weapons he possesses? Some in the palace guard
might turn on him if the price were right.</LD>
<TE>   Could the scientific talent in Iraq, those who have the capacity
to build weapons of mass destruction, be bribed to leave? In all
likelihood, there are at most a few dozen people in the country who
have the technical knowledge to build weapons of mass destruction.
Through intelligence information and weapons inspections, they could
be located and offered huge sums to defect.</TE>
<TE>   For a small fraction of the cost of a war, Iraq could be flooded
with weapons inspectors who could look in every nook and cranny of
the country and find any weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine sending 10,000 weapons inspectors, an absurdly large
number and enough to turn over every imaginable stone in Iraq. If
each was paid $100,000 a year, the cost would be $1 billion. Even
paying all of their expenses and keeping them there for 10 years
would cost less than 10% of the cost of a war and without the risk of
killing thousands.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, an invasion of Iraq would result in significant
casualties and increase the risk of Hussein unleashing weapons of
mass destruction, the very thing the war is trying to prevent.</TE>
<TE>   Such options may seem silly at first, but on reflection they
illustrate how many alternatives less expensive than war are not
being considered, such as feeding starving people around the world.</TE>
<TE>   A war on Iraq doesn't make rational sense.</TE>
<TE>   But why aren't the Democrats asking these questions? Why aren't
they pushing for consideration of a much larger range of options?</TE>
<TE>   In 1962, faced with nuclear missiles just 90 miles from the U.S.
shore, President Kennedy refrained from the use of force, pursued
other strategies, and tragedy was averted.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy acted rationally; it's time for the Democrats and the
country to insist that Bush do the same.</TE>

<HD>'Suitcase Nukes' Pack Little Risk</HD>
<DH>Resources devoted to intercepting such devices could be
better used elsewhere.</DH>

<AU>NIKOLAI SOKOV</AU>
<BD>Nikolai Sokov, a former Russian diplomat, is a senior
research associate at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies. Web
site: cns .miis.edu.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1997, then-Russian Gen. Alexander I. Lebed stunned the world when
he alleged that almost 100 miniature, portable nuclear devices from
the former Soviet Union could not be accounted for. Russian officials
denied such weapons existed, but the suspicions persisted.</LD>
<LD>   Weapons of mass destruction are the most feared tool of
terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   Among them, portable nuclear devices, commonly referred to as
"suitcase nukes," are particularly dangerous because of their small
size and full-scale nuclear-explosion effects.</LD>
<TE>   In the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, another look at the
threat posed by suitcase nukes is particularly urgent.</TE>
<TE>   The Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Monterey Institute
of International Studies undertook such a study. It used its database
(available to the public through the Nuclear Threat Initiative at
www.nti.org), carried out additional information searches and
conducted interviews. The results represent perhaps the first
encouraging news in this area in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Official denials notwithstanding, there is good reason to believe
that the Soviet Union possessed so-called small atomic demolition
munitions, just as the U.S. did during the Cold War.</TE>
<TE>   These devices reportedly weighed 60 to 180 pounds and had yields
of 100 to 1,000 tons of TNT.</TE>
<TE>   In our view, the discrepancies the Russians reported about devices
transferred from other former Soviet republics more likely reflected
poor accounting rather than the loss of weapons.</TE>
<TE>   A special commission on suitcase nukes reported in 1996 that it
found all such weapons that had been in Russia before 1991, when the
Soviet Union collapsed, but not those that had been in other former
Soviet republics.</TE>
<TE>   Most withdrawals of such weapons to Russia were, in fact,
completed in 1989 and 1990, many months before the collapse of the
Soviet Union, when the troops charged with control of nuclear weapons
were still reliable.</TE>
<TE>   The priority attached to safe withdrawal was demonstrated by a
shooting incident in Azerbaijan in 1990, when a demonstration
organized by the local opposition tried to prevent the takeoff of
aircraft carrying nuclear weapons. The crowd dispersed after warning
shots, but an officer involved said that troops had been authorized
to use deadly force if necessary to prevent the seizure of nuclear
weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Belarus and Kazakhstan in
1992 proceeded smoothly.</TE>
<TE>   The governments of these states did not challenge the control of
nuclear weapons by the Russian Defense Ministry.</TE>
<TE>   It was the nuclear weapons in Ukraine that generated considerable
concerns.</TE>
<TE>   But because of these concerns, accounting and on-site verification
were conducted independently by the Russians and the Ukrainians in
1992, with close monitoring by the United States. So far, there has
been no credible information about the loss of even a single nuclear
weapon.</TE>
<TE>   Within Russia itself, the safety of portable nuclear devices is
subject to the same risks as that of all other nuclear weapons. These
risks are addressed by the U.S. through the Nunn-Lugar cooperative
threat reduction program.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, even if a small number of portable nuclear devices were
lost (improbable, but vital to assess nevertheless), they probably
are not operational today.</TE>
<TE>   These devices apparently had a short shelf life and had to be
serviced frequently. Consequently, since the early 1990s they would
have missed 20 or more scheduled servicings and can hardly be
efficient weapons in terrorists' hands.</TE>
<TE>   Our findings suggest that resources for interception of "suitcase
nukes" could be more productively used against other, more likely
threats, such as "dirty" bombs, in which conventional explosives are
used to disperse highly radioactive materials.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it would be only prudent to keep a close eye on further
developments with regard to portable nuclear devices.</TE>
<TE>   We intend to continue to do just that.</TE>

<HD>The Battle to Win Hearts and Minds Has to Begin at Home</HD>
<DH>Pro-American sentiment appears to be unwelcome at top U.S.
campuses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NORAH VINCENT</AU>
<BD>Norah Vincent is a New York writer and a senior fellow
at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a think tank set up
after Sept. 11 to study terrorism. Web site: www.norahvincent.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reeducating Saudis and Pakistanis about the United States will be key
in winning the war on terror, but it is beginning to seem like we
will have to begin the propaganda wars at home.</LD>
<LD>   Since the Sept. 11 attacks, conservatives and libertarians have
been trying to counterbalance academia's left-lurching views on
terrorism and the Middle East. They have recently redoubled their
efforts.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, for example, the American Council of Trustees and
Alumni, co-founded by Lynne Cheney, wife of the vice president,
released a report titled "Restoring America's Legacy," which asserted
that of the top 50 colleges rated by U.S. News &amp; World Report
magazine, not one makes American history a requirement for
graduation.</LD>
<TE>   In his Sept. 17 Rose Garden speech on education, President Bush
cited that report's findings as he announced new initiatives on
history education.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, as American studies are in decline, Middle East studies
programs and courses are flourishing, and Middle East Forum Director
Daniel Pipes has reported they are largely tainted by
"disinformation, incitement and ignorance," and the usual
blame-America-first rhetoric, almost all of which goes unchallenged.</TE>
<TE>   In response to this trend, Pipes has just launched Campus Watch,
(www.campus-watch.org) a Web-based project intended to "reverse the
damage" by keeping dossiers on offending professors and institutions
and posting relevant news articles.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent article, Pipes recounts how at Colorado College,
Palestinian spokeswoman Hanan Ashrawi spoke Sept. 12 above quiet,
nonviolent protests.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, at Concordia University in Montreal, a riot by
anti-Israel groups prevented former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
from speaking. A similarly unsavory incident took place at San
Francisco State University last spring, when an anti-Israel group
displayed a poster on campus accusing Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of
ritualistically killing Palestinian children. There is the problem in
a nutshell. And it is widespread.</TE>
<TE>   The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a libertarian
legal action group, has been involved for the last year in some of
the most controversial cases surrounding American-Muslim relations on
campus.</TE>
<TE>   The group's Web site (www.thefire.org) contains detailed
information on a startling list of civil liberties abuses including,
most egregiously, the suspension last fall of Kenneth Hearlson, a
professor at Orange Coast College who, classroom audiotapes later
showed, was falsely accused of calling four Muslim students
terrorists. (Hearlson has been reinstated.)</TE>
<TE>   Though the group has fought for the civil rights of both pro- and
anti-American professors and students, its case list shows it has had
many more of the former to defend.</TE>
<TE>   On another front, conservative activist David Horowitz has
launched his Campaign to Take Back Our Campuses. Horowitz's
FrontPageMagazine.com is featuring, among other articles, the text of
Lawrence H. Summers' controversial recent speech in which the Harvard
president condemned a militant and one-sided pro-Arab climate in
academe.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-Israel views are increasingly finding support in progressive
intellectual communities, Summers said, adding that such views have
been "anti-Semitic in their effect if not their intent."</TE>
<TE>   Most people agree that campus life should foster debate, not
indoctrinate young people with one-sided views.</TE>
<TE>   Those who are honest also concede that academe is dominated by the
left. A recent survey by the Luntz Research Cos. for the Center for
the Study of Popular Culture confirmed this: Only 3% of Ivy League
professors reported they were Republicans, and only 6% considered
themselves to be even somewhat conservative.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, the balance is out of whack, and this is potentially
disastrous.</TE>
<TE>   If we stand by and let young people learn to condemn their nation
while eschewing study of its best traditions, and if we do nothing
while they are encouraged to silence rather than confront opposing
views, then we are well on our way to creating a network of madrasas
far more harmful to our way of life than those in the Arab world.</TE>

<DH>East Coast candidates aren't the ticket for our police
chief.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH WAMBAUGH</AU>
<BD>Joseph Wambaugh is a former LAPD detective whose
latest book is "Fire Lover," a true story (William Morrow, 2002).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1991, four LAPD cops gave a severe beating to ex-convict Rodney
King. In 1999, four NYPD cops fired 41 rounds at innocent West
African immigrant Amadou Diallo. King became rich eventually. Diallo
became dead immediately. In 1996, two LAPD cops shot and framed a
local youth, Javier Ovando. In 1997, two NYPD cops tortured and
sodomized Haitian immigrant Abner Louima in their precinct station.</LD>
<LD>   In this tale of two cities, the Los Angeles episodes were
determined to be part of a "cop culture" of violence and
"symptomatic," not "aberrant" like those of their New York Police
Department counterparts, whose city and media maintained confidence
in their police.</LD>
<LD>   Just three months after the King beating, outsiders from the
Christopher Commission, armed with preconceptions and a Thomas Guide,
decided that the Los Angeles Police Department "routinely" committed
brutal acts "under color of law" and labeled 44 cops as "potential"
problem officers. No such warp speed inquiry and tea leaf
prognostication plagued the NYPD.</LD>
<TE>   L.A.'s 1996 Ovando incident escalated the so-called Rampart
scandal, claims of widespread corruption and a federal consent
decree, but it all fizzled with the prosecution of only two crooked
cops.</TE>
<TE>   Two former officials of the NYPD are finalists for the job of LAPD
chief. One of these, William Bratton, lauded for computer crime
fighting (years after it was pioneered by the LAPD) got into a public
dust-up with then-Mayor Rudy Giuliani over a Big Question: Which of
them should get credit for the crime decrease in the 1990s, when age
demographics and big-time jail terms made crime drop everywhere in
the nation? Giuliani ultimately showed Bratton the door.</TE>
<TE>   The other finalist, rumored to be the favorite, is John Timoney,
who bolted from the NYPD after not receiving a promotion, a man who
loves the spotlight only slightly less than Bratton and who himself
called America's Mayor "a screw-up." Irish-born Timoney likes to say
that his "immigrant understanding" would serve him in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Yet immigrant experience wasn't impressive enough to make Cmdr.
George Gascon a finalist. He fled Castro's Cuba, mastered English and
earned a law degree while serving with the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   The third finalist, Chief Art Lopez of the Oxnard Police
Department, formerly a deputy chief with the LAPD, is the only
"outside" finalist with inside knowledge and the only Latino to make
the cut. He is highly educated, experienced and greatly respected by
the cops and the community--a uniter, not a grandstanding divider,
without limelight lust.</TE>
<TE>   But if Lopez is not selected, neither he nor any of the LAPD
rejects among the applicants should ape their Eastern counterparts
and go job hunting in New York, even though most of the "innovations"
that the Easterners crow about were begun by the LAPD, from community
policing (under other names) to SWAT.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine the Big Apple hoots if any of them had the chutzpah to
knock on Mayor Michael Bloomberg's door looking for work. New York
has unique problems, is too socially layered, too culturally
sensitive, too politically complex for a West Coaster. It's another
country there. On the other hand, Los Angeles is ... well, it's L.A.,
birthplace of Valley-speak and Planet Hollywood. What's to know,
Laker stats? It takes vast local knowledge to lead the NYPD; the LAPD
can be led by a boss from anywhere. Or so it seems.</TE>
<TE>   At a time when LAPD morale is nearing meltdown, the selection of
Bratton or Timoney would announce to the rank and file--especially
Latinos who make up one-third of the department and nearly half of
the city--that no matter how educated, experienced and talented they
are, no matter how long they've waited, it is not yet their time. But
if not now, when?</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, most of the negative press that has buried the department
during the last 10 years is the result of two decades of abysmal
media relations.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the LAPD's legendary excellence, its chiefs have been
condescending to the press and insular at best, contemptuous and
taunting at worst. The working cop has reaped media spin that their
leaders have sown, chiefs who have never understood that a mistreated
media is a lethal adversary.</TE>
<TE>   No police force can succeed with hostile journalists at its
throat. On the East Coast, where corruption and bribery were routine,
the NYPD maintained public confidence because its leaders grasped
that perception of the police is in large part media-driven. Both
Bratton and Timoney have glowing press notices to prove it.</TE>
<TE>   However, what the LAPD critics have never understood is just how
easy it is for a cop to answer calls, write neat reports, study for
promotions and stay out of trouble. In fact, many a cautious police
chief has skated through his entire career doing just that: avoiding
risky proactive work that might result in danger, controversy or, God
forbid, public criticism.</TE>
<TE>   But when police morale falls low enough, proactive policing ceases
completely, and the public's protective shield shatters.</TE>
<TE>   The City of Angels is still served by wonderfully trained,
courageous officers (remember the North Hollywood shootout?), and
working cops would rally around Art Lopez, who knows the misery they
have endured for 10 years because of a very few bad apples and a
string of media-myopic chiefs.</TE>
<TE>   If Timoney is selected (L.A. does love celebrity), it will be the
final insult, leading cops to conclude that the city secessionists
are not such crackpots after all. If another carpetbagging farce
plays out, call it Willie Williams Revisited, but a reprise of that
debacle would doubtlessly delight news junkies.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine the glee when Timoney pushes that Celtic kisser at the
cameras, sneers toward City Hall and announces that Hizzoner the
mayor is just another "screw-up." Stand by, media watchers, for some
donnybrooks.</TE>

<LD>The Rev. Jesse Jackson and the Rev. Al Sharpton need to get out
more--maybe even break down and catch a matinee of "Barbershop," the
movie that has Jackson demanding apologies and Sharpton threatening
boycotts. Anyone who takes himself so seriously could use a good
laugh.</LD>
<LD>   Produced, directed and written by African Americans and with a
virtually all-black cast (the one white character wants to be black),
the movie is a reworked classic--"It's a Wonderful Life" set in a
rough Southside Chicago neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   Just as Jimmy Stewart's George Bailey felt trapped into taking
over his father's bank, Ice Cube's Calvin Palmer wants to be a music
producer, not a barber--until he realizes how lucky he has it and how
important the barbershop is to the community.</LD>
<TE>   The fun is in how he comes to that epiphany. The 2002 version is
more salty and less saccharine (sorry, Frank Capra fans) than the
1946 one.</TE>
<TE>   The singular two-minute scene that sent Jackson and Sharpton into
orbit cast comedian Cedric the Entertainer as Eddie, an old-timer who
never seems to actually cut anyone's hair. The irascible Eddie pokes
fun at several African American public figures, including O.J.
Simpson and Rodney King. No one escapes his sharp tongue, not even
civil rights icons Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King Jr. or Jackson
himself. Never mind that the character is meant to be over the top
and that a dozen other folks in the barbershop tell him so. Thin skin
comes in all shades.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson and Sharpton, joined by members of the King family and
friends of Parks, want a public apology by Friday and the scene
excised when MGM releases the movie on video.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, please. Even if this protest didn't take the lines out of
context, the movie makers would still have the right to use them,
just as Jackson and Sharpton have the right to object. Comedy doesn't
have sacred cows, and free speech is protected in studios and
barbershops alike.</TE>
<TE>   Look, it's no surprise that groups--especially those who have
suffered due to bigotry, discrimination and stereotypes--want to
control how they are seen and portrayed. This year, an unflinching
documentary about gay Orthodox Jews caused an uproar in the Jewish
community.</TE>
<TE>   A movie that "lets the world eavesdrop on the conversation that
black folks can have when white people aren't around," as one critic
(admiringly) described "Barbershop," breaks these rules.</TE>
<TE>   The good news is that the new, post-civil rights generation may
not need the old rules. The multiracial crowds who are making this
bighearted movie a box office hit may not yet be colorblind, but they
all laugh at the same jokes and come away with the same, surprisingly
sweet lesson about the importance of community.</TE>
<TE>   They simply recognize a wonderful movie when they see one, and so
might Jackson and Sharpton if they'd just join the audience and not
be so desperate to draw one.</TE>

<HD>FDA Needs Bold New Chief</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Food and Drug Administration in its way does as much as the
Pentagon to protect Americans in their daily lives. So it's scary
that the agency has gone leaderless for 20 months.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, the president nominated a 39-year-old medical
economist to head the FDA, which regulates everything from
after-shave to apple cider--goods whose sales make up one-quarter of
the U.S. gross national product.</LD>
<LD>   Mark McClellan looks like a shoo-in. But the Senate should use his
confirmation hearing to let him know that after years of inattention,
the agency needs a leader willing to kick over apple carts.</LD>
<TE>   Here are three important fixes:</TE>
<TE>   * The agency needs to fast-track genuinely promising new drugs.
But the next head must do so without further demoralizing the agency;
its own drug evaluation director has called it "a sweatshop
environment that's causing high staffing turnover." The agency has
allowed dangerous drugs to slip through the screening process and
almost entirely fails to track their efficacy after approving them.
The next FDA head needs to change that.</TE>
<TE>   * The agriculture industry's indiscriminate use of antibiotics as
growth promoters in livestock is contributing to the declining
utility of antibiotics for people. The chance that genetically
modified fish or insects might escape into the environment and
disrupt or wipe out existing species is another threat. The new head
needs to address these problems fast.</TE>
<TE>   * Alarming shortages of key childhood vaccines hobble the U.S.
health-care system. On Tuesday, the General Accounting Office said
some of the shortages were due to the FDA's failure to "expedite the
review of these vaccines." It's time to fix this failure.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), head of the Senate committee
that will confirm the next FDA head, has praised Bush's nominee.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, McClellan, who previously worked as an economic policy
aide under Clinton, appears to be the sort of able and relatively
nonpartisan policy wonk the FDA needs.</TE>
<TE>   But the position demands something else too: a leader able to
produce bold change.</TE>

<LD>The United States did it after Pearl Harbor and John F. Kennedy's
assassination. The Senate voted Tuesday night to establish an
independent commission to investigate 9/11, putting the nation on
track to witness another solemn inquiry into whether a national
catastrophe could have been averted. History does not provide many
successful models, but the government is right to try, with a panel
independent of both the White House and Congress.</LD>
<LD>   Congress has its own investigation and has issued three
preliminary reports that are alarming enough: They point to a lack of
cooperation between the FBI and CIA and to FBI lawyers who refused
pleas last year by a New York agent to hunt down a man who became one
of the hijackers.</LD>
<LD>   But Congress has an obvious conflict of interest because it
oversees intelligence agencies. Its investigators also are hampered
by a lack of funds, staff and time. With an insufficient number of
investigators and a deadline of early next year--and facing
resistance from FBI and CIA officials who want to run out the
clock--Congress can't finish the job.</LD>
<TE>   The Senate proposal needs to be reconciled with a more limited
House version passed in July. Under the Senate legislation, the
10-member panel of prominent national figures who are not currently
serving in government would be armed with a $3-million budget and the
power to subpoena witnesses and documents. The measure calls for the
panel to include members with backgrounds in areas such as
intelligence, homeland security and the military.</TE>
<TE>   Among the logical candidates would be former CIA Director Robert
Gates and former Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Unlike the
congressional investigative committee, it would have a mandate that
would extend to diplomacy, law enforcement and immigration and
aviation policy. How was it, for example, that all 19 hijackers came
to the U.S. on legal visas?</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), who championed the
legislation, has said the commission would not be used to "point
fingers" and even political scores. We hope he's right. The panel
probing Pearl Harbor made scapegoats of Adm. Husband E. Kimmel and
Gen. Walter C. Short for intelligence and military failures that
deserved wider blame.</TE>
<TE>   That does not mean individuals should be exempt from scrutiny. The
9/11 commission should take a close look at CIA Director George
Tenet's leadership of the agency. After Tenet's warning in 1998 that
"we are at war" after the bombing of two American embassies in
Africa, did the agency fail Tenet--or did Tenet fail the agency? Does
the CIA director need more power over other government agencies to
truly direct intelligence?</TE>
<TE>   No commission will ever banish conspiracy theories--look at the
Web sites dedicated to arguing over who really killed JFK. The panel
would have to beware the 20-20 hindsight that gives too much weight
to vague warnings that only look on-target in retrospect.</TE>
<TE>   But the victims' families, who lobbied mightily for the panel, are
right to insist on a full accounting, and President Bush was right to
finally drop his opposition. Knowing what happened is necessary to
fixing what's wrong.</TE>

<HD>Gore Speaks Out on the Bush Team's War Plans</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Gore Assails Bush's Stance on Iraq, Questions Motive for War,"
Sept. 24: It's too bad to see Al Gore allowing himself to be taken in
by Saddam Hussein. Hussein's game from Day One has been to shine us
on, to "agree" to inspections but to chip away at what he allowed to
be inspected until, by and by, he could refuse inspections outright.
Now that we've turned up the heat, Hussein wants to repeat his
outstanding success in this sort of gamesmanship and, yet again, Gore
wants to let him do so.</LD>
<LD>   The problem, however, is not just seeing the U.N. vindicated, or
forcing Hussein to play by the international rules. It is the clock
ticking on our own and the world's safety. Hussein is a known user of
biological weapons, such as anthrax. He is known to be trying to
achieve nuclear weapons capability. Gore is so caught up in Hussein's
gamesmanship, however, that he has lost sight of the purpose for the
inspections. The purpose was to disarm a man willing to use whatever
weapons come to hand in order to keep himself in power and to invade
and devastate his neighbors, given the chance.</LD>
<LD>   The clock is ticking. We have the opportunity to make sure that
Hussein can't launch a new series of attacks against his neighbors
and against the U.S. Too bad Gore can't keep his eye on the ball.</LD>

<TE>   While I have never been a big Gore fan, I have to admit that he
showed a lot of backbone in speaking out against the administration's
planned invasion of Iraq, particularly when the war seems to enjoy
such broad popular support. He is right to point out that we should
fulfill our obligations to Afghanistan before charging off to another
conquest and that President Bush's domestic agenda has been a
failure.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps by making his position known, Gore will infuse the
congressional Democratic doormats with the courage to stand up
against this misguided war juggernaut.</TE>

<TE>   Robert Scheer's railing against the president's plan for a

lessons (Commentary, Sept. 24). Many of us still living remember the
horrors of World War II and the family losses we endured because the
Scheers of the world made excuses while that lunatic in Germany built
the most powerful army in history. It was almost too late when it
became clear to the world what was going on.</TE>
<TE>   In this age of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, the
United States won't have the time and distance buffer that we had
during World War II.</TE>

<TE>   I am proud to be an American and love this country with all my
heart, but in light of the presidential election fiasco of 2000, for
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld to describe the people of Iraq
as "hostages to a small group of dictatorial, repressive government
officials" (Sept. 23) seems the height of irony.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After reading "Europe's Food Regions Fight to Keep Their Good Names"
(Sept. 16), I shared in Andrea Bonati's outrage that some cheeses not
made in Parma, Italy, are nevertheless called "parmesan." After all,
how could a non-Parma parmesan ever hope to capture that je ne sais
quoi that defines the original? (I hear it's the breeze that makes
the cheese.) Lest your readers get the impression that such cultural
crimes are only perpetrated against Europeans, allow me to relate two
tales from a recent trip to France.</LD>
<LD>   At a restaurant in Paris, I was shocked to see "Philly cheese
steak" listed on the menu. As you can imagine, I felt that a part of
my American-ness had been ripped from my soul. It's the subtle flavor
imparted by Philadelphia's unique climatic conditions--combining a
hint of auto exhaust with the tang of the Delaware River--that
separates a run-of-the-mill cheese steak from a genuine Philly cheese
steak. Later that evening, at a bar, I was forced to endure a further
cultural indignity as a patron next to me ordered a "Long Island iced
tea." Obviously, when made by a cheerful Parisian, such a drink would
lack the special qualities that only a truly surly Long Island
bartender can impart.</LD>
<TE>   From Key lime pie to Tex-Mex to Boston baked beans, our precious
cultural heritage is being stolen from right under our noses. Someone
should pay. Now if you'll excuse me, my hamburger is getting cold ...
oh, sorry, Hamburg; I mean my "Washington-urger."</TE>

<LD>George Skelton is concerned about a low voter turnout in November
(Sept. 23). Rightfully so. Every indicator shows that Californians
are not in agreement with the two mainstream parties.</LD>
<LD>   If fewer than 50% turn out to vote, we will again have an
administration that represents far fewer than the majority. So much
for democracy in California.</LD>
<LD>   The Times must share the blame for this condition. By refusing to
recognize a historic inevitability and clinging to the past by
refusing to include credible third-party candidates like Green
nominee Peter Camejo in its debates, it is depriving the Los Angeles
electorate of a true democratic choice. Voters are far from convinced
that the two parties represent us anymore. How long will it take The
Times to catch up?</LD>

Who are these others, other than the smoke-and-mirror scam artists
and energy-thief cronies of President Bush and Vice President Dick
Cheney? Not only were these conservative Republicans responsible for
the so-called energy crisis, but the misconceived energy policy of
this administration is still based on the input of these people. By
the way, I remember when the brainy and money-making dad of Simon Jr.
was involved in the energy crisis of the '70s, and his great wisdom
was to "keep your tank topped off," which only exacerbated an already
bad problem.</TE>

<LD>   When you see and talk to the many individuals who find their own
ways to survive in these areas, you get a sense of just how diverse
the causes of homelessness are. Everyone has a story to tell--a
reason or excuse, depending on what side of the fence you're on.</LD>
<LD>   There is no magic solution, single program or cure-all to this
situation. It will require many efforts by competent professionals,
organizations and ex-homeless people who all have the patience and
well-managed resources to commit to a long-term battle to attack the
reasons for the problem, and not just label the people who need the

<LD>Re "Council to Decide Fate of 4 Old Oaks," Sept. 22: Widening the
road and smoothing the turn may increase the number of accidents at
this problem intersection, as the more open sight lines and
less-intimidating approach will encourage faster driving by those
approaching the new curve. And engineers admit they haven't bothered
trying to post signs or warning lights on the downhill portion of the
road where the problem occurs.</LD>
<LD>   Are we being stupid here, or what? Cut down the oaks, reconfigure
a local roadway as a speedway, and expect that people will just
naturally slow down? Instead, narrow the road uphill from the oaks,
install a center divider to provide further visual narrowing (and a
modest measure of protection from lane-drifters) and put in warning
signs. Maybe revoke a liquor license or two as well; city engineer
Rand Disko said a sober driver going the speed limit should have no
trouble making the bend around the trees.</LD>

<LD>Re "Locked Out of a House," Opinion, Sept. 22: Joel Kotkin is guilty
of not seeing the forest because of the trees. Mass immigration,
especially by Latinos, legal and illegal, generated a housing boom in
the last 20 years that has caused many cities and counties to be
"built out." Demand continues to press prices higher as available
land disappears.</LD>
<LD>   Kotkin also ignores the extended reality of housing needs. Housing
is much more than four walls. What about water, roads and other
infrastructure support for the community that housing brings, such as
schools, hospitals, police, fire and municipal buildings and waste
management needs? And how about the continuing urbanization of
wildlife habitat? We are plowing under thousands of acres of trees
and open space.</LD>
<LD>   Kotkin tries to lay a guilt trip on any white person who owns
property by implying that the Latinos must do without. However, he
ignores the fact that the rapid increase in population by Latinos is
the very reason Latinos don't have an easy time getting housing.</LD>

the time and money to fight this kind of thing (building new homes)

illegal immigration?</TE>

<LD>I read "N. Korea Admits Kidnappings" (Sept. 18) with a mixed feeling.
Although my heart goes out to the victims' families, what about the
estimated 150,000 sex slaves, most of them abducted from Korea,
during World War II? Worse yet, after more than 50 years, heartfelt
apologies and compensation to the survivors are yet to come from the
Japanese government. More evil than an "axis of evil" in this case?</LD>

<HD>Eduard Gufeld, 66; Soviet Grandmaster Tutored Chess Greats
of 1970s, '80s</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eduard Gufeld, the Soviet chess grandmaster known as a top trainer
when the Soviets dominated the chess world in the 1970s and '80s, has
died. He was 66.</LD>
<LD>   Gufeld, who moved to Hollywood from the Georgian Republic in 1995
and was the only grandmaster in Southern California, died of a stroke
Monday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   A Ukrainian chess master in his native Kiev in the 1950s, Gufeld
participated in eight national Soviet Union chess championships in
the 1960s.</LD>
<TE>   In 1967, Gufeld earned the title of International Grandmaster of
Chess, the highest title awarded by the World Chess Federation.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people, especially the best players, just play to win
and they don't care about how it's done, but he always wanted to
create something new, to have an original idea in every game," said
Times chess columnist Jack Peters, an international master who was a
friend of Gufeld's.</TE>
<TE>   "He was motivated always by a love of the art of chess, the beauty
of the game," said another friend, international chess master Anthony
Saidy.</TE>
<TE>   Gufeld's personality--gregarious, humorous and emotionally
impetuous--made him a fascinating figure both as a player and away
from the board.</TE>
<TE>   "He was unrestrained," said Peters, who became friends with Gufeld
after he moved to Hollywood. "When he felt bad, it was obvious he
felt bad; when he felt good, it was obvious he felt good. There was
no reserve at all.</TE>
<TE>   "He just loved chess passionately his entire life. There wasn't
anything he liked better than showing people a wonderful game."</TE>
<TE>   As a Soviet chess coach, Gufeld was the trainer of the Soviet team
that dominated the Chess Olympiad in the 1970s and '80s.</TE>
<TE>   He also worked for many years with one of the world's top male
stars, Ukraine grandmaster Yefim Geller, and after moving to Tbilisi
in the Georgian Republic, he guided Maya Chiburdanidze to the women's
world championship. In early 1998, Gufeld opened a club, Chess
Academy, in his modest apartment building on La Brea Avenue near
Sunset Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a microcosm of the Soviet Central Chess Club in Moscow,"
Saidy said.</TE>
<TE>   "He had the walls lined with photos of the world chess champions,
with Russian captions to read. He had an active club until the rent
was raised and he decided to close it" after about 3 1/2 years.</TE>
<TE>   Until a few months ago, Gufeld continued to compete in nearly all
of the major U.S. tournaments, and he won the 1999 American Open.</TE>
<TE>   Gufeld, who had traveled to more than 100 countries over the
years, was well known in chess circles as a journalist, lecturer and
best-selling author. He wrote more than 80 books on chess, which sold
3.5 million copies in many languages, Peters said.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the amazing things about him was his travel," Peters said.
"Back when he was in the Soviet Union, he was one of the very few
Soviet grandmasters who got to play in tournaments outside the Soviet
Union." And wherever he traveled, the gregarious Gufeld charmed those
who met him.</TE>
<TE>   When news of his death spread over the Internet, a Dutch friend of
Gufeld's remarked on his "unrivaled ability to make friends with
people from all over the globe instantly without reservation.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot think of anyone who had the ability to transform a room,
by creating an instant, joyous atmosphere by his sense of humor, his
way of disarming shy and sometimes reserved--even hostile--people."</TE>
<TE>   Gufeld is survived by his sister, Lydia Valdman, and his mother,
Eva Yulievna, both of Hollywood, and a stepson who lives in the
former Soviet Union. A funeral service will be held at 2:30 p.m.
Monday at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery, 6000 Santa Monica Blvd.,
Hollywood.</TE>

<HD>Jan de Hartog, 88; Novelist, Award-Winning Playwright</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jan de Hartog, Dutch writer of half a dozen plays including the
Tony-winning "The Fourposter" and nearly two dozen novels based
primarily on his own adventurous life, has died. He was 88.</LD>
<LD>   De Hartog died Sunday of causes associated with aging in Houston,
his home for many years.</LD>
<LD>   A former sea captain and a resistance fighter who escaped from the
Nazis during World War II, De Hartog was probably best known in the
U.S. for the 1951 Broadway hit "The Fourposter," about a couple
during several phases of marriage. Starring the real married couple
Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn, the initial production earned a Tony
for best play and ran for 632 performances.</LD>
<TE>   It was made into a motion picture in 1952 starring Rex Harrison
and Lilli Palmer and became a popular comedy. The marital saga was
re-created on Broadway in 1966 as a Tom Jones-Harvey Schmidt musical
called "I Do! I Do!" starring Mary Martin and Robert Preston.</TE>
<TE>   De Hartog's plays have been performed in 23 languages and his
novels and nonfiction books have been translated into 17.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike many of his books, De Hartog apparently did not base "The
Fourposter" on his own life. He wrote the play while hiding out from
Nazis in 1942--posing as an old lady in a senior citizens' home in
Amsterdam.</TE>
<TE>   Under a death sentence, De Hartog was wanted for writing what was
probably his best-known and best-loved work in his native
country--"Holland's Glory." Published in 1940, the book was based on
his experiences working on oceangoing tugboats. It became a symbol of
the Dutch Resistance movement and sold 500,000 copies in the
Netherlands, prompting the Nazis to ban it and charge De Hartog with
exciting "national passions."</TE>
<TE>   For the rest of his life, the author once said, Dutch readers
would say of whatever was his latest novel, "It's very nice,
mijnheer, but it's not 'Holland's Glory.' "</TE>
<TE>   Born in Haarlem, Netherlands, the minister's son who became a
devout Quaker ran off to sea at 10. His father retrieved him, but he
left again and worked as cabin boy on fishing boats, ocean steamers
and tugboats. He briefly attended the Netherlands Naval College and
continued to work as a sailor and captain as he began his writing
career.</TE>
<TE>   Under the pseudonym F.R. Eckmar, De Hartog wrote several detective
novels in the 1930s and for five years was an actor and playwright
for the Amsterdam Municipal Theater.</TE>
<TE>   After escaping to England during the war, he joined the Dutch
merchant marine as a correspondent from 1943 to 1945. Years later, in
collaboration with his third and surviving wife, Marjorie Mein, he
wrote the book "Escape," about his flight through occupied Europe.</TE>
<TE>   De Hartog did not switch to writing in English until his 1951
novel "The Lost Sea," about a Dutch boy who runs away to sea.</TE>
<TE>   Always a sailor at heart, De Hartog converted a 90-foot barge into
a houseboat and lived on it for some years. During severe flooding in
Holland in 1953, he and his family turned the houseboat into a
floating hospital. He described the experience in his book "The
Little Ark," which was made into a movie in 1972 starring Theodore
Bikel.</TE>
<TE>   Other De Hartog books turned into films included "The Spiral
Road," starring Rock Hudson and Burl Ives in 1962; "The Key,"
starring William Holden and Sophia Loren in 1958, based on his novel
"Stella," and "Lisa," starring Stephen Boyd and Dolores Hart in 1962,
based on his novel "The Inspector."</TE>
<TE>   De Hartog told his own story and also achieved his social goals
with such works as "The Children: A Personal Record for the Use of
Adoptive Parents" about adopting two Korean girls, and, more notably,
with his nonfiction book "The Hospital."</TE>
<TE>   That book about deplorable overcrowding and understaffing at a
Houston charity hospital stemmed from the volunteer experience of De
Hartog and his wife when they moved to Texas in 1962 while he taught
playwriting at the University of Houston. When the book was released,
it drew more than 400 volunteers to the Houston hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Other books, all written with strong socially conscious overtones,
include "Distant Shore," "A Sailor's Life," "The Captain," "Peaceable
Kingdom," "The Trail of the Serpent," "Star of Peace" and "The
Centurion."</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, De Hartog donated a complete collection of his books and
manuscripts to the Whittier College Wardman Library. That fall he
delivered a series of Whittier campus lectures on "The Three Crises
in Quaker History."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife of 41 years, Marjorie, he is survived by
two children from each of his three marriages: Sylvia and Arnold de
Hartog of Holland; Catherine Dennison and Nicholas de Hartog of
England; and Eva Kim Kovach of Brookline, Mass., and Julia Kim
Sailler of Ferndale, Mich.</TE>

<HD>Frances Howard, 88; Sister of Former Vice President</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frances Humphrey Howard, 88, a public service advocate and the
younger sister of former Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, died
Monday of congestive heart failure at a Washington hospital.</LD>
<LD>   Howard was one of four Humphrey children who grew up in Doland,
S.D. She studied sociology, earning a bachelor's degree and then a
master's degree from George Washington University in 1937 and 1941.
She was two years younger than Hubert, who died in 1978 at age 66.</LD>
<LD>   Her lengthy career as a civil servant dates to the early 1940s,
when she served as an assistant to Eleanor Roosevelt in the National
Civil Defense Office and the United Nations Assn.</LD>
<TE>   With Roosevelt, she helped integrate Washington hotels. Roosevelt
asked her to arrange a staff party at the Shoreham Hotel. When Howard
and a black colleague arrived to check on the arrangements, they were
told that the reservation could not be found.</TE>
<TE>   Howard picked up a phone and called Roosevelt at the White House,
she told the Washington Post a few years ago. "Mrs. Roosevelt marched
into the hotel and announced, 'We shall occupy the room.' We all did,
and that was the way the first hotel in Washington was integrated."</TE>
<TE>   In between campaigning for her brother, Howard held a variety of
Washington jobs. As a foreign service officer, she directed the
Agency for International Development's War on Hunger. Beginning in
1970, she worked at the National Library of Medicine, a branch of the
National Institutes of Health, serving as a liaison between the
library and other federal agencies.</TE>
<TE>   She also served on the boards of numerous Washington institutions,
including the Washington Opera, the National Theatre and the Capital
Children's Museum.</TE>

<HD>Stephanie Reinhart, 58; Head of Dance Festival</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stephanie Reinhart, an influential, award-winning arts administrator
who co-directed the American Dance Festival in Durham, N.C., and
dance programming at the Kennedy Center in Washington, died Monday of
leukemia in New York City. She was 58.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Washington, D.C., she specialized in cultural history at
the University of Wisconsin and graduated with honors. She received a
fellowship for graduate studies at George Washington University, and
later attended the Harvard University Summer Institute in Arts
Administration. She joined the National Endowment for the Arts in
1969 as administrator of dance and education programs and first
worked for the American Dance Festival in 1977, the year she married
festival director Charles L. Reinhart.</LD>
<LD>   In 1980, the Reinharts made a trip to Asia to search for dance
companies to present at the festival and, two years later, gave the
U.S. its first look at the nightmarish, neo-Expressionist Japanese
idiom butoh.  They followed this coup with a festival of five
contemporary French companies the next year and showcased China's
first modern dance company in 1991.</LD>
<TE>   Stephanie Reinhart became co-director of the American Dance
Festival in 1993, and the couple were named directors of dance at the
Kennedy Center three years later. Their activities at the latter
institution included the innovative, multi-company Balanchine
Festival held in 2000. But perhaps their greatest impact came from
the modern dance workshops they organized in Japan, South Korea and
Russia--helping establish contemporary American styles of movement in
cultures with very different dance traditions.</TE>
<TE>   Reinhart also served as a panelist on arts councils in Kentucky
and North Carolina, worked on the boards of the Martha Clarke and
Laura Dean dance companies, and contributed articles to the books
"East Meets West in Dance: Voices in the Cross-Cultural Dialogue" and
"Dancing Female: Lives and Issues of Women in Contemporary Dance." In
1993, she was awarded a Fulbright research grant to study the history
of modern dance in Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Reinhart was honored by the French government with the
title Chevalier dans l'Ordre des Arts et Lettres for her
contributions to French dance. She also won an Emmy as an executive
producer of the PBS special "Free to Dance," a history of black dance
in America.</TE>
<TE>   Besides her husband, Reinhart is survived by her daughter, Ariane
Malia Reinhart; her mother, Florence Keren; three stepsons, Adam,
Taylor and Scott; and three step-grandchildren, Chelsea, Taylor and
Jeremy. In her memory, the American Dance Festival has established an
ADF Stephanie Reinhart Fund for New Works and Scholarships, 1697
Broadway, Room 900, New York, NY 10019.</TE>

<HD>New Ahmanson Traffic Study Not Urged</HD>
<DH>Development: Report says the builder should do more to
protect endangered species on the project site.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new traffic study for the proposed 3,050-home Ahmanson Ranch
subdivision near Calabasas is not warranted, but developer Washington
Mutual should take additional steps to protect an endangered frog and
flower species during construction, according to a new report.</LD>
<LD>   Rincon Consultants affirmed its earlier conclusion that the
proposed suburb would substantially affect the California red-legged
frog and San Fernando Valley spineflower, but that safeguards could
reduce the loss to acceptable levels.</LD>
<LD>   In a 4,000-page report that includes additional protection
measures, the consultants recommend that no grading occur near the
frog's habitat from January through May, the species' prime breeding
period.</LD>
<TE>   Surveys on frog and flower populations found during construction
should also be monitored more closely and reported to state and
federal authorities frequently, the report states.</TE>
<TE>   Rincon Consultants, the Ventura firm hired by the county to
conduct the supplemental environmental impact report, also
recommended the developer protect burrowing owls. If the owls are
found during their breeding season, the developer should consult with
state Department of Fish and Game on how to protect them, the report
said.</TE>
<TE>   But, as expected, the report makes no recommendation for further
traffic studies, something project opponents have insisted should
occur because data are at least a decade old.</TE>
<TE>   "That really shows it is a flawed document," said Tsilah Burman,
spokeswoman for Rally to Save Ahmanson Ranch, an opposition group.
"Not only have volumes changed, but the traffic patterns as well. We
gave them significant new information and they ignored it."</TE>
<TE>   The new community would produce an additional 37,000 vehicle trips
a day on the Ventura Freeway and other major roads, according to the
initial environmental study approved in 1992. That estimate still
holds, Ventura County Senior Planner Dennis Hawkins said.</TE>
<TE>   Hawkins said he will recommend that the county committee reviewing
the report approve it and forward it to the Planning Commission for a
second phase of public hearings.</TE>
<TE>   After the planners' review, the study will be brought to the
Ventura County Board of Supervisors for final approval.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for developer Washington Mutual said the report proves
the project has taken many steps to reduce the environmental
degradation that would come with construction of homes, a shopping
center, golf course and elementary school.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very happy to see the process moving along," spokesman Tim
McGarry said. "It's been close to two years for this supplemental
review, and it adds to the already very extensive environmental and
judicial review this project has had. It must be one of the most
studied projects in the history of California."</TE>
<TE>   At the request of project opponents, a water well near Ahmanson
Ranch was tested for possible contamination from the nearby
Rocketdyne Santa Susana Field Laboratory. None was found, Hawkins
said.</TE>
<TE>   But comments during months of public hearing prompted Rincon
Consultants, which conducted the study, to make additional
suggestions to keep pollutants out of downstream watersheds.</TE>
<TE>   At the golf course, for instance, fertilizers containing selenium
should be prohibited, the report says. Application of nitrogen
fertilizers should also be kept to a minimum, it said.</TE>
<TE>   County supervisors asked for the follow-up study in 1999, after
the endangered frog and flower species were found on the site.</TE>

<HD>County Pushes for More Arts in Schools</HD>
<DH>Education: Officials are compiling database of resources,
but stop short of allocating new funds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County encouraged local school districts on Wednesday to
reinvigorate arts education during the next decade, saying it is a
valuable goal even in this time of tight budgets.</LD>
<LD>   In a new Regional Blueprint for Arts Education, the county is
urging the 82 school districts to include arts in their core
curriculum and to train teachers to meet California standards in arts
education.</LD>
<LD>   The blueprint's sponsors--the county Board of Supervisors, county
Arts Commission and county Office of Education--are putting together
a database of 300 arts organizations that often provide free programs
for schools and training for teachers. The blueprint also proposes
making that database available online soon.</LD>
<TE>   The county, however, struggling with its own budget crisis, is not
offering any new significant funds for arts education.</TE>
<TE>   The plan is undergirded by research that shows students perform
better in school when involved in the arts.</TE>
<TE>   "This is about making arts an integral part of our curriculum just
like geography, algebra and social studies," Zev Yaroslavsky,
chairman of the Board of Supervisors, said at a Pasadena news
conference announcing the program.</TE>
<TE>   Newly appointed county Office of Education Supt. Darline P. Robles
said she hopes districts will support arts spending even in this
tougher financial environment. She said it was important to support
officials who advocate for the arts.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Slavkin, a former member of the Los Angeles Board of
Education who is now vice president of education at the county's
Music Center, said he welcomed ways to better connect with other arts
groups in the effort.</TE>
<TE>   "Each of us doing our own thing hasn't proven to be a reliable
policy," Slavkin said. The Music Center provides dance, theater,
music and visual arts performances to hundreds of schools.</TE>
<TE>   While other area districts have cut back on arts spending, the Los
Angeles Unified School District has spent $25 million the last four
years revitalizing arts in its elementary schools. But even if no
other district follows suit, Laura Zucker, executive director of the
county Arts Commission, said she hopes schools can stretch what arts
resources they have.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important that we do planning when [financial] times are
bad," she said. "When the pendulum shifts the other way, we'll be
prepared and we'll get more funding."</TE>
<TE>   A report in 2000 said 78% of the county's districts spent less
than 2% of their budgets on arts education. Zucker said spending
needs to be increased to 5% for the plan to succeed during the next
10 years.</TE>

<HD>Davis Signs More Curbs on Gun Makers</HD>
<DH>Firearms: The two bills will allow victims of shootings to
sue manufacturers, who had been exempt from such litigation since
1983.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER WARREN and DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>In a major triumph for victims of gun violence, Gov. Gray Davis on
Wednesday signed twin pieces of legislation allowing manufacturers of
firearms to be held liable for harm their products cause.</LD>
<LD>   The measures repeal a special exemption created for gun makers by
the Legislature in 1983. They also overturn a 2001 state Supreme
Court ruling upholding that law.</LD>
<LD>   Supporters called the governor's action a stinging setback for the
firearm industry because it will permit victims of violence to sue
for negligence.</LD>
<TE>   "When companies deliberately put people in danger by their
irresponsible and negligent conduct, they need to be held
accountable," said Sarah Brady, whose husband, James, was disabled in
the 1981 assassination attempt on President Reagan. "California is
leading the country once again, [becoming] the first state to repeal
special immunity for the gun industry."</TE>
<TE>   Davis said the bills will give victims their "day in court,"
ending an era in which the gun industry was "allowed to hide from its
own harmful conduct."</TE>
<TE>   "Current laws shield a gun manufacturer from its own negligence,"
he said in a conference call with reporters. "These new laws strip
away that shield."</TE>
<TE>   Predicting an outcry from the firearms industry, Davis said the
bills hold gun makers to the same standard "of good conduct that we
hold all businesses in this state."</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the National Rifle Assn. called the law a
substantial blow to the gun industry. She said it would allow "greedy
trial lawyers" to bankrupt gun makers by forcing them to fight what
some predict could be a flood of lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   "The focus of any effort to curb violent crime ought to be on the
criminal and not on a lawful industry," the spokeswoman, Kelly
Whitley, said from NRA headquarters in Fairfax, Va. "We don't see
lawsuits against Ford [Motor Co.] because someone drives drunk and
kills somebody."</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the law challenged that analogy, arguing that some
gun makers design and promote their products to appeal to criminals.
Specifically, they cite the episode that gave rise to last year's
Supreme Court decision--a 1993 shooting rampage at a San Francisco
office tower.</TE>
<TE>   Armed with a pair of semiautomatic pistols capable of firing 32
rounds apiece without reloading, Gian Luigi Ferri killed eight people
and wounded six in the attack. As police closed in, Ferri killed
himself.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives of the victims sued, alleging that the manufacturer of
Ferri's TEC-DC9 pistols, Navegar Inc., aimed its advertising at
people attracted to violence. In a brochure to retailers, Navegar
said its weapons "are as tough as your toughest customer." One ad
said the weapon was resistant to fingerprints.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court threw out the case, citing the 1983 law granting
immunity to gun makers.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, two plaintiffs--whose husbands were killed in the
rampage--said that although their case is over, the new law will aid
future victims.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no further action we can take, but the gun sellers will
be held accountable now," said Marilyn Merrill of San Francisco.
"This is an awesome thing for us."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the state law, two bills pending in Congress would create
a new, federal immunity shield for gun manufacturers, preempting
California's action.</TE>
<TE>   Davis sent a letter to the chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, expressing his concern, but late Wednesday the
committee passed the House version of the bill.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' signing of the gun control measures--carried by Sen. Don
Perata (D-Alameda) and Assemblyman Paul Koretz (D-West
Hollywood)--caps a trend he set early in his term, when he approved
limits on assault weapons and the sale of so-called Saturday night
specials.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the governor has signed measures limiting gun
purchases to one a month, requiring that safety locks be installed,
and requiring that handgun purchasers receive a license and prove
that they can handle a weapon, said Luis Tolley of the Brady Campaign
to Stop Gun Violence.</TE>
<TE>   "California has enacted more strong gun laws in the last four
years than all the other states combined," Tolley said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' Republican opponent, Bill Simon Jr., said he would have
vetoed the measures Davis signed Wednesday. "I don't think it's
appropriate to hold a manufacturer liable for something they did not
have control over," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon said that he supports current gun-control laws, including
trigger locks, but that he would not back additional measures.</TE>
<TE>   Other gun-related bills signed by Davis on Wednesday will:</TE>
<TE>   * Assist cities suing gun dealers in obtaining data about the
transfer and sale of firearms. Now, such information is compiled by
the state but can be used only for law enforcement purposes (SB 1490
by Sen. Don Perata, D-Alameda).</TE>
<TE>   * Permit state law enforcement officials to conduct spot checks of
handguns in gun stores to determine whether they meet safety
standards. Gun makers now send their wares to labs for such
inspections (AB 2902 by Koretz).</TE>
<TE>   * Require that gun dealers check with the Department of Justice
before shipping firearms into California to ensure that the
recipients are legitimate dealers (AB 2080 by Assemblyman Darrell
Steinberg, D-Sacramento).</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, Davis signed 14 measures dealing with the growing
problem of identity theft. Those and other bills signed include:</TE>
<TE>   * A measure that helps people whose names were fraudulently used
by suspects in criminal cases. AB 1219 by Assemblyman Joe Simitian
(D-Palo Alto) lets the court clear up the confusion over the names,
without requiring the victim to hire a lawyer and start legal
proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   * A bill requiring credit reporting agencies to give identity
theft victims the right to block fraudulent information and get a
free copy of their credit reports once a month for a year to monitor
their financial information (SB 1239, by Sen. Liz Figueroa,
D-Fremont).</TE>
<TE>   * A measure requiring state agencies that maintain computerized
data to disclose any breach of security that includes personal
information. The bill, SB 1386 by Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon),
notifies consumers if their personal or financial information was
accessed by unauthorized individuals.</TE>
<TE>   A bill designed to protect Californians who live near active
nuclear power plants from accidental radiation exposure. AB 2067 by
Assemblyman George Nakano (D-Torrance) requires state health
officials to oversee the distribution of potassium iodide tablets to
those who live, work or attend school near a plant.</TE>

<LD>A butane tanker crash Wednesday morning shut down part of the Golden
State Freeway for much of the day, the California Highway Patrol
said, but the driver escaped injury.</LD>
<LD>   Patrick Coffee, 37, of Porterville, Calif., fell asleep while
driving south near California 138, Officer Doug Sweeney said.
Coffee's truck drifted off the road about 4 a.m. and slammed into a
high-voltage transmission tower, causing wires to fall on the
freeway.</LD>
<LD>   Traffic lanes were closed after butane was discovered leaking from
the tanker, Sweeney said.</LD>
<TE>   The officer described the traffic disruption as "monumental," with
backups stretching north and south for miles. Lanes were closed for
several hours in the morning and again in the late afternoon while
crews worked to transfer the load to another tanker.</TE>

<LD>A new traffic study for the proposed 3,050-home Ahmanson Ranch
subdivision near Calabasas is not warranted, but developer Washington
Mutual should take additional steps to protect an endangered frog and
flower species during the project's construction, according to a new
report.</LD>
<LD>   Rincon Consultants, hired by the county, affirmed its earlier
conclusion that the proposed suburb would substantially affect the
California red-legged frog and San Fernando Valley spineflower, but
that safeguards could reduce the loss to acceptable levels.</LD>
<LD>   In a 4,000-page report that includes additional protection
measures, consultants recommend that no grading occur near the frog's
habitat from January through May, the species' prime breeding period.</LD>

<LD>The Los Angeles City Council decided Wednesday to approve a $935,000
road improvement project in Tujunga that will destroy four old oak
trees. In the last seven years, 43 accidents have been reported on
the curvy roadway.</LD>
<LD>   The project will widen and realign the intersection of Honolulu
Avenue, Tujunga Canyon Boulevard and La Tuna Canyon Road, near the
Foothill Freeway. Thirty-four oaks will be planted nearby to offset
the removal of the four trees.</LD>
<LD>   City law protecting oaks allows trees to be removed if they
interfere with road improvements.</LD>

<HD>For Camejo, Broadening the Left Is Worth a Loss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>George Skelton</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>CONCORD</DL>
<LD>CONCORD</LD>
<LD>   Peter Miguel Camejo understands he is not going to be elected
governor. "Look, I'm not an idiot," says the Green Party candidate.</LD>
<LD>   Oh, if he could wangle into three televised debates with Gov. Gray
Davis and Republican nominee Bill Simon Jr., then it'd be possible,
he contends. "That's my posture."</LD>
<TE>   But that's never going to happen. Davis won't allow it. "A total
political coward," Camejo asserts.</TE>
<TE>   Political prudence is a gentler characterization. Davis is not
about to shine the media spotlight on a left-winger who could siphon
away votes from him on Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, Camejo's argument for debating the governor is weakened
by his poor showing in polls.</TE>
<TE>   A new statewide survey by pollster Mark Baldassare for the Public
Policy Institute of California shows Camejo with only 5% of the
likely vote. Davis leads Simon 40% to 32%, with 17% undecided and 6%
for other candidates.</TE>
<TE>   There seems to be a market for fringe, protest candidacies.
Baldassare found that only 38% of voters are satisfied with their
choices for governor. But relatively few voters ever actually buy
into such markets, especially in California.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't like to throw away their vote," notes veteran
pollster Mervin Field. He says interesting third-party candidates
usually wind up with only about half the votes they record in polls.</TE>
<TE>   So why is Camejo running? I asked him that at his tiny campaign
headquarters, in the back of a modest Bay Area office building where
he operates a "socially responsible" investment firm.</TE>
<TE>   "We really believe we should try to build an alternative party,"
he said. "There is a domination of corporations over our society and
over the two political parties that endangers democracy. My campaign
is to broaden the base of the Green Party."</TE>
<TE>   At last count, the Green Party had 147,243 registered voters in
California, about 1% of the total.</TE>
<TE>   Camejo, 62, was born in New York to Venezuelan parents. After they
divorced, he spent summers in Venezuela with his father, who was
getting rich building resorts. The rest of the year, he lived with
his mother in middle-class New York. The mix of lifestyles he
witnessed radicalized him, Camejo says.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't see any poverty in middle-class America, obviously not
venturing far from home. But in Venezuela, he saw both extreme wealth
and, nearby, desperate poverty. "I began developing the concept that
it is possible to have a society where everybody is about equal, like
I saw in the United States," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was 16 years old, I went to the top of a building my
father had built. I watched the sun rise and promised myself that I
would spend my whole life trying to help poor people."</TE>
<TE>   Camejo chuckles when he recalls this. His words often are fiery,
but he projects modesty and smiles easily.</TE>
<TE>   At UC Berkeley in the '60s, Camejo was an antiwar protester who
got expelled for using an unauthorized microphone. In 1976, he ran
for president as the Socialist Workers candidate and received
one-tenth of 1% of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   He's about as liberal as they come in American politics, even on
the fringe.</TE>
<TE>   On some liberalism, he's mainstream--like favoring abortion
rights.</TE>
<TE>   On other issues--like opposing the death penalty--he's where the
Democratic Party used to be before it wised up politically. "I agree
with Gandhi's statement: An eye for an eye leaves everybody blind."</TE>
<TE>   He'd legalize marijuana and tax it heavily. "Tobacco is far more
dangerous." He'd also decriminalize cocaine and heroin, making it
available through doctors. "Then you'd undermine the criminal world."</TE>
<TE>   On the environment, he believes no tree older than the state
should be cut--anything that took root before 1850. Only 4% of these
original old-growth trees remain, he says. Greens are pushing for a
2004 ballot measure.</TE>
<TE>   "There are too many people on the planet," Camejo continues. The
answer? Only two children per woman, achieved voluntarily through
education and empowerment.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to fight the Vatican on this. Oppression of women under
the guise of religion is not acceptable. That goes for Muslims and
that goes for Catholics."</TE>
<TE>   But Camejo admits to "a contradiction." While worried about
population growth, he also advocates legalizing all immigrants who
are here illegally. "I'm against having a caste system."</TE>
<TE>   Camejo thinks Davis is corrupt. But isn't he concerned about
helping elect a conservative?</TE>
<TE>   "If Davis were knocked out because the Greens got a big vote," he
replies, "it would move all politics in California in the direction
of a more progressive agenda. And that's more important long term
than whether Simon or Davis are in."</TE>
<TE>   Camejo is a credible anti-Davis protest vote for Democratic
libs--if they're willing to risk electing a right-winger.</TE>

<HD>Rivals for Police Chief's Job Pal Around in Los Angeles</HD>

<LD>There are 469 square miles in Los Angeles--and that still wasn't
enough room to prevent a couple of high-profile out-of-towners from
bumping into each other this week like a pair of movie stars vying
for the same award on Oscar night.</LD>
<LD>   But these two traveled in rental cars, not limos.</LD>
<LD>   John Timoney, one of three finalists for the job of Los Angeles
police chief, walked into the New Otani hotel Tuesday morning and got
the star treatment: A TV news crew popped from around a corner and
started taping him checking into his $140-a-night room. (He balked at
spending the city's money on the $350-a-night rooms available at the
downtown Marriott.)</LD>
<TE>   Then the desk clerk answered the phone and told Timoney, the
former commissioner of the Philadelphia Police Department, "It's for
you." It was hotel security asking if he wanted the TV crew thrown
out.</TE>
<TE>   After settling into his room, he rode an elevator down to the
lobby and stepped out to see William Bratton, the former commissioner
of the New York Police Department--and his rival for the LAPD
job--being trailed by the same film crew.</TE>
<TE>   Timoney ducked back into the elevator, and Bratton walked in
behind him.</TE>
<TE>   "Billy Boy," Timoney said, chuckling, as the doors closed on the
cameras.</TE>
<TE>   Competitors this week and NYPD colleagues during the 1990s,
Bratton and Timoney are, coincidentally, best friends.</TE>
<TE>   The two chatted on the ride up to Timoney's 16th-floor stop, at
which point they decided, hey, a police chief finalist's gotta eat,
right?</TE>
<TE>   The former officers, neither of whom carries a gun, went off to
lunch together at the Azalea restaurant on the lobby level of the
hotel. Somehow, they had shaken the camera crew. Or, more precisely,
the camera crew had moved on to something else.</TE>
<TE>   Both men insist that the contest for Los Angeles police
chief--which has been whittled down to them and Oxnard Police Chief
Art Lopez, a Los Angeles native who needs no introduction to the
city--will not dampen their friendship.</TE>
<TE>   "We're always going to be the best of friends," Bratton once told
a reporter.</TE>
<TE>   "The competition is no big deal for us," Timoney has said.</TE>
<TE>   They've been through plenty already.</TE>
<TE>   Since they parted ways in New York, the two cops have stayed in
touch and found ways to help each other: Timoney defended Bratton
when New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani feuded with his former
commissioner; Bratton recommended Timoney for the top policing job in
Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Bratton was first up. The former New York commissioner
met with Mayor James K. Hahn and his entourage.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton, a native Bostonian, told the group to consider his strong
accent a warmup for what they were about to get: Timoney's thick
"Bronx brogue," a New York and Irish mixture.</TE>
<TE>   Later that afternoon, Timoney got in his rental car (nothing
fancy) with his rental company map and motored across Wilshire
Boulevard, through the fading, once-elegant stretches of Los Angeles,
to Getty House, the grand mansion in Windsor Square that the mayor
uses for ceremonial purposes.</TE>
<TE>   For the balance of the day, Timoney was cloistered with Hahn, the
mayor's staff and City Council members, mostly in the small,
book-lined library of Getty House. The mayor supplied chocolate
cookies to tide them over.</TE>
<TE>   A dinner of chicken and twice-baked potatoes was ordered in from
Whole Foods Market and served on the long, polished table under a
crystal chandelier in the formal dining room.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the evening, Timoney retired to his hotel room to
finish rereading "Rizzo," the biography of former Philadelphia police
chief and mayor Frank Rizzo. He is writing an introduction to a new
edition of the book.</TE>
<TE>   But once again Wednesday morning, Timoney's and Bratton's paths
crossed at breakfast at 7:30 a.m. in the same hotel restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Timoney, who likes to get up before dawn, was gearing down from a
90-minute workout in the hotel gym, while Bratton was gearing up for
his day of interviews with the mayor, et al.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor said Wednesday afternoon that he believes all three
candidates are experienced and have come to the interviews--Lopez had
his round of meetings Monday--well-prepared.</TE>
<TE>   The question, Hahn said, ultimately will come down to who can make
the city safer.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn intends to mull that over for at least several more days.</TE>
<TE>   Already, however, Timoney and Bratton have gotten a handle on the
little things--Bratton has mastered the freeways and pronunciation of
"La Cienega."</TE>
<TE>   Timoney, an avid rower, has already investigated the Los Angeles
Rowing Club, which rows out of Marina del Rey.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton's interviews stretched through Wednesday. As with Timoney,
he and Hahn hunkered down in the library. While they talked, city
crews trimmed trees nearby.</TE>
<TE>   By early afternoon, Bratton was getting his meal with the mayor.
Bratton's was ordered from California Chicken Cafe, and, like
Timoney's, eaten with Hahn in the formal dining room. When they were
done, Hahn walked Bratton to his rental car, a silver Ford Taurus,
and saw him off.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor later told reporters that he might talk to his three
finalists again before making up his mind, but that he was not
planning to meet with them in person until after deciding on his
nominee for chief.</TE>
<TE>   By then, his pal Timoney had shed a suit for jeans, polo shirt,
and favorite Teva sandals to eat salmon enchiladas in East L.A. at La
Serenata de Garibaldi--the kind of hip Mexican restaurant you only
know about if you're cool and live in Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Boy Scouts Ban Voice Teacher Accused of Abuse</HD>
<DH>Aftermath: The former merit badge counselor faces
molestation charges. Officials of the O.C.-based chorus say the man
cleared the background screening.</DH>

<LD>The singing instructor charged with molesting a former member of the
Costa Mesa-based All-American Boys Chorus also has been barred from
the Boy Scouts of America, where he volunteered as a merit badge
counselor for Orange County troops.</LD>
<LD>   Local and national Boy Scout officials on Wednesday said Roger A.
Giese of Irvine, a former Eagle Scout, is prohibited from working
with any of the nation's scouts, but would not disclose when he was
blacklisted or whether the ban is related to the chorus allegations.</LD>
<LD>   Giese, 27, was arrested Friday on suspicion of molesting a Buena
Park teenager over four years starting in May 1998, when the youth
was 13. Giese met the boy through the choir and was giving him
private singing lessons at the youth's home, where the alleged abuse
may have occurred.</LD>
<TE>   Giese was released on a $200,000 bond after his arrest Friday, and
is scheduled to appear in court Oct. 18. He could not be reached for
comment Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   A day after the allegations became public, parents of some of the
150 boys in the internationally acclaimed All-American Boys Chorus on
Wednesday expressed shock and disbelief. At least one parent said she
was considering removing her son from the choir.</TE>
<TE>   "It's crossed my mind. How could it not?" said Diane Chacon of
Corona. "I just couldn't believe it. This organization is just run
really, really smooth."</TE>
<TE>   Chacon and other parents said chorus officials have taken
extraordinary measures to protect the boys and said they were
confident that no boys--including the youth who has accused
Giese--were sexually abused while at any choir practices or events.</TE>
<TE>   The allegations come about eight years after two former choirboys
won settlements from the chorus, and the Diocese of Orange, over
allegations they were molested by the chorus' founder, the Rev.
Richard T. Coughlin. Coughlin, who started the choir in 1970 was
never charged.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony S. Manrique, executive director of the chorus, said the
organization has strict guidelines about contact between staff
members or volunteers and the boys in chorus.</TE>
<TE>   Chorus staff also must undergo an FBI criminal background check,
ensuring they have "impeccable" records, Manrique said Wednesday.
Giese underwent the same background check and had no criminal
history, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Manrique said many distressed parents have called, but that all he
has spoken with have expressed support for the organization.</TE>
<TE>   No performances have been canceled, and no financial backers have
withdrawn support, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some parents also are concerned about how the choir's reputation
will reflect on the boys and their families.</TE>

parish youth project, was never charged.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony S. Manrique, executive director of the chorus, said the
organization has strict guidelines about contact between staff
members or volunteers and the boys in chorus.</TE>
<TE>   Staff can never be alone with boys; at least two staff members
have to be present at all times. When touring the country or the
world, the staff and boys stay in separate rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Chorus staff also must undergo an FBI criminal background check,
ensuring they have "impeccable" records, Manrique said Wednesday.
Giese underwent the same background check and had no criminal
history, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously this is a distressing situation. We are very confident
in the youth-protection policies we have in place," Manrique said.
"We are very committed to protection of the boys in our care, and
living up to the trust of the parents."</TE>
<TE>   Manrique said many distressed parents have called, but that all he
has spoken with have expressed support for the organization.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, he sent letters to all parents restating the security
measures the chorus has in place and inviting anyone with information
about possible crimes to contact police.</TE>
<TE>   No performances have been canceled, and no financial backers have
withdrawn support, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our program stands on its merits, and I think people who have
their sons in our program are aware of the quality and value of our
programs," he said. "I don't feel there will be a negative impact in
the long run."</TE>
<TE>   The All-American Boys Chorus does not charge for membership, and
has performed around the world--recently returning from a six-week
tour of Asia. The chorus has also been popular with advertisers,
providing soundtracks for commercials for Mazda, Kentucky Fried
Chicken and TWA.</TE>
<TE>   "They are going to take a hit national-reputation-wise, but those
associated with them still have great confidence in them," said Pat
Cottrell, senior pastor at the Calvary Baptist Church of Huntington
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Cottrell has two sons in the choir, and two others have graduated
from the chorus. He said he hasn't given a second thought to keeping
his boys in the program.</TE>
<TE>   "They've been very proactive. We have absolutely no concern about
the safety or emotional well-being of our boys," he said. "We
continue to believe it's one of the safest and healthiest
organizations we know of."</TE>
<TE>   Cottrell also expressed concern about the allegations against
Giese, who he said had a good reputation among the boys. If Giese was
wrongly accused, he would probably never recover, he said. "But if
he's guilty, I'm glad it came out, no matter the consequences," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Some parents also are concerned about how the allegations will
affect the choir's reputation and reflect on the boys and their
families.</TE>
<TE>   "Those around me are going to judge us, about why we're going to
let our sons in the organization," Chacon said. "Will boys want to
join? You have to question and wonder that now, especially with two
things in the past."</TE>
<TE>   According to Giese's biography on the chorus Web site--which
officials removed after his arrest--the former voice coach had been
affiliated with the group since he joined as an 11-year-old performer
in January 1988. Giese sang alto.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after graduating from the chorus in 1991, Giese joined its
production staff and worked as the chorus' communications director
before he became the paid voice coach.</TE>
<TE>   While attending Chapman University in Orange, Giese served as
president of the college choir and was a member of the university's
"peer conduct board," a student-run judicial body. He graduated with
a degree in communications, and currently was employed as a senior
account executive at the Rankin Group Ltd., a marketing and
advertising firm in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Giese was an Eagle Scout and later volunteered as a merit badge
counselor for the Boy Scouts of America. The organization has a
behavior code under which volunteers can be dismissed for a variety
of reasons, including giving a boy a ride home without another adult
in the car. And any misconduct suspected of being criminal in nature
is immediately reported to police, said Brett Beck, a spokesman for
the Orange County Council of the Boy Scouts of America.</TE>

<HD>2 Battle D.A. to Regain Old Jobs</HD>
<DH>Personnel: Lawyer says the prosecutors were 'sent to
Siberia for backing the wrong candidate.' Ventura County officials
deny the allegation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two prosecutors who were reassigned after openly supporting the
candidate who challenged retiring Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael
D. Bradbury's handpicked successor are now fighting to get their old
jobs back.</LD>
<LD>   Mark Pachowicz and Adam Pearlman were stripped of their felony
cases three weeks after the March 5 election and ordered to report to
the child support enforcement division, a transfer they contend was
politically motivated and an abuse of the district attorney's power.</LD>
<LD>   "They don't care about a person's constitutional rights, they
don't care how good you are as an attorney," Pachowicz said. "The
only thing they really care about is their own political existence
and power."</LD>
<TE>   Pachowicz, Pearlman and Vivian Rackauckas, a third prosecutor
transferred to child support, have asked the county's Civil Service
Commission to intervene and plan to press their case at a hearing
today.</TE>
<TE>   "Experienced, highly qualified prosecutors have been emasculated
and sent to Siberia for backing the wrong candidate," the
prosecutors' attorney wrote in a brief to the five-member board.</TE>
<TE>   But attorneys for Ventura County don't see it that way.</TE>
<TE>   They contend in a written response that the commission has no
jurisdiction to hear employee appeals of reassignments or transfers.</TE>
<TE>   And because the lawyers were not demoted and did not suffer pay
cuts, their brief states, they have no right to a hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if Appellants' feelings have been hurt," wrote Leroy Smith,
litigation supervisor for the county counsel office, "they have
suffered no cognizable wrong."</TE>
<TE>   The transferred lawyers, however, believe they have been wronged,
and are eager to argue their case--if they can persuade the
commission to listen.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to go back," Pearlman said. "It's not that difficult."</TE>
<TE>   Pachowicz and Pearlman were vocal supporters of candidate Ron
Bamieh--a fellow deputy district attorney--during a contentious
election to replace Bradbury, who is stepping down after six
consecutive terms. Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Greg Totten, Bradbury's
chosen replacement, won March 5 by a wide margin.</TE>
<TE>   During an election-night interview, Bradbury said he would extend
an olive branch to those who had supported Bamieh and focus on
healing wounds.</TE>
<TE>   On March 28, Pachowicz and Pearlman were separately called into
meetings with their supervisors and told they were being reassigned
to the child support division.</TE>
<TE>   Pachowicz, an 11-year veteran of the office who spent three years
building a drug-and-racketeering case against the Hells Angels and
put a convicted killer on death row in 1998, said he was not given an
explanation.</TE>
<TE>   Bradbury, who was out of town, could not be reached to respond to
the allegation, but relayed a statement through an assistant. "It is
a personnel matter that is being handled by county counsel," he said.
"It would be inappropriate for me to comment."</TE>

<HD>2 Battle D.A. to Regain Their Former Posts</HD>
<DH>Personnel: Lawyer says prosecutors were 'sent to Siberia
for backing the wrong candidate.' Ventura County officials deny the
allegation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two prosecutors who were reassigned after openly supporting the
candidate who challenged retiring Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael
D. Bradbury's handpicked successor are now fighting to get their old
jobs back.</LD>
<LD>   Mark Pachowicz and Adam Pearlman were stripped of their felony
cases three weeks after the March 5 election and ordered to report to
the child support enforcement division, a transfer they contend was
politically motivated and an abuse of the district attorney's power.</LD>
<LD>   "They don't care about a person's constitutional rights, they
don't care how good you are as an attorney," Pachowicz said. "The
only thing they really care about is their own political existence
and power."</LD>
<TE>   Pachowicz, Pearlman and Vivian Rackauckas, a third prosecutor
transferred to child support, have asked the county's Civil Service
Commission to intervene and plan to press their case at a hearing
today.</TE>
<TE>   "Experienced, highly qualified prosecutors have been emasculated
and sent to Siberia for backing the wrong candidate," the
prosecutors' attorney wrote in a brief to the five-member board.</TE>
<TE>   But attorneys for Ventura County don't see it that way.</TE>
<TE>   They contend in a written response that the commission has no
jurisdiction to hear employee appeals to reassignments or transfers.</TE>
<TE>   And because the lawyers were not demoted and did not suffer pay
cuts, their brief states, they have no right to a hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if Appellants' feelings have been hurt," wrote Leroy Smith,
litigation supervisor for the county counsel office, "they have
suffered no cognizable wrong."</TE>
<TE>   The transferred lawyers, however, believe they have been wronged,
and are eager to argue their case--if they can persuade the
commission to listen.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to go back," Pearlman said. "It's not that difficult."</TE>
<TE>   Pachowicz and Pearlman were vocal supporters of candidate Ron
Bamieh--a fellow deputy district attorney--during a contentious
election to replace Bradbury, who is stepping down after six
consecutive terms. Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Greg Totten, Bradbury's
chosen replacement, won March 5 by a wide margin.</TE>
<TE>   During an election-night interview, Bradbury said he would extend
an olive branch to those who had supported Bamieh and focus on
healing wounds. On March 28, Pachowicz and Pearlman were separately
called into meetings with their supervisors and told they were being
reassigned to the child support division. Pachowicz, an 11-year
veteran of the office who spent three years building a
drug-and-racketeering case against the Hells Angels and put a
convicted killer on death row in 1998, said he was not given an
explanation. But he was not surprised.</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted to get rid of us," Pachowicz said. Some deputy
district attorneys agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "I expected that there would be some form of consequence for
supporting someone who wasn't chosen by the district attorney," said
one prosecutor who asked not to be identified. "They really went out
there in the heat of the political battle and I think that led to
problems for them."</TE>
<TE>   As a member of the union representing prosecutors and public
defenders, Pachowicz said he was involved in bringing a lawsuit
against the county amid stalled contract negotiations six years ago.
A settlement was later reached to give union members an
across-the-board 3% pay raise.</TE>
<TE>   In his brief to the commission, attorney Stephen Silver argued
Pachowicz was "banished" for his support of Bamieh as well as his
union activities.</TE>
<TE>   Bradbury, who was out of town, could not be reached to respond to
the allegation, but relayed a statement through an assistant. "It is
a personnel matter that is being handled by county counsel," he said.
"It would be inappropriate for me to comment."</TE>
<TE>   Smith at the county counsel office also declined to comment on the
issues raised by Pearlman and Pachowicz in their appeal. But in his
brief to the commission, Smith said the lawyers' allegations are
false.</TE>
<TE>   "Appellants' true complaint is no secret," Smith wrote. "They
believe that the District Attorney unlawfully retaliated against them
for exercising their political right and/or engaging in union
activities. The District Attorney adamantly denies this."</TE>
<TE>   For Rackauckas, the third attorney requesting a hearing before the
commission, the issues are different.</TE>
<TE>   Also a veteran prosecutor, she was transferred to child support in
April 2000 after bouncing back and forth between the unit and
criminal prosecution assignments.</TE>
<TE>   But when the child support division splintered from the district
attorney's office on July 1 and became a separate county agency,
Rackauckas and a dozen other attorneys lost the ability to handle
criminal prosecutions.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas said she now wants assurances her retirement and
benefits won't be affected as a result of the reorganization created
by state legislators. "I don't think anyone is retaliating against
me," she said. "I just want to make sure that my rights are
protected."</TE>
<TE>   C. Stanley Trom, director of the child support division, said
Pachowicz, Pearlman and Rackauckas are the only lawyers who have
asked to return to the district attorney's office and that he is not
opposed to the request.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't have a problem if they went back," Trom said. "They
are fine attorneys."</TE>
<TE>   Trom said the 13 lawyers in his now independent agency, which
tracks deadbeat parents and collects $50 million in child and medical
support payments annually, are not trial attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   "They are like corporate counsel who give legal advice and then
tend to the court-related business that we have," said Trom, who
supervises 340 workers. "While three attorneys are important to us,
this operation is a lot larger than just three individuals. This is a
big business here."</TE>

<HD>Agents Seize Pot Harvest Near Ojai</HD>
<DH>Drugs: Annual sweep in Los Padres National Forest has
netted 7,000 marijuana plants so far. Six suspects, all undocumented,
have been arrested.</DH>

<LD>The war on drugs in Ventura County was on full display Wednesday,
replete with guns, thumping helicopters and sweaty, bug-bitten troops
in camouflage scouring the rugged hillsides for the enemy.</LD>
<LD>   As they have done each fall for the last three decades, county and
federal agents this week descended on another small patch of the
giant Los Padres National Forest north of Ojai, seizing piles of the
annual marijuana harvest.</LD>
<LD>   By late Wednesday, after months of surveillance and several
smaller raids, machete-wielding deputies had chopped down about 7,000
mature marijuana plants and were anticipating a total of more than
10,000 by Friday.</LD>
<TE>   In addition, authorities arrested six undocumented residents from
Mexico who were allegedly attempting to flee the plantations.
"There's marijuana in all of the these canyons, as far as the eye can
see," said sheriff's pilot David Nadon as he directed a helicopter
into a narrow mountain channel called Wheeler Gorge.</TE>
<TE>   This year's largest eradication effort focused on the
rock-and-brush-covered pass off California 33, about 15 miles north
of Ojai.</TE>
<TE>   Towering trees and dense chaparral make excellent cover for pot
farming, authorities say, and black plastic piping, which can be
purchased in rolls of 1,000 feet, stretches easily to nearby creeks
to nourish plants.</TE>
<TE>   "Each and every year, the growers come back ... to the forest,"
said Eric Nishimoto, a spokesman with the Ventura County Sheriff's
Department. "There's not too many places that offer these
conditions."</TE>
<TE>   The forest, which covers about 860 square miles of the county's
back country, has long been a popular place for Mexican drug cartels
to plant high-grade sensimia, a potent pot plant that can be worth
more than $3,000 a pound on the street.</TE>

<TE>   The forest, which covers about 860 square miles of the county's
back country, has long been a popular place for Mexican drug cartels
to plant high-grade sensimia, a potent pot plant that can be worth
more than $3,000 a pound on the street.</TE>
<TE>   The total value of this month's haul will exceed several million
dollars, assuring that Ventura County will remain on the short list
of the state's leading dope-growing regions, which include Humboldt
and Mendocino counties, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Plans for the eradication effort started in early summer when
Forest Service pilots and later sheriff's chopper pilots began a
series of day and nighttime flyovers in the north county.</TE>
<TE>   Trained narcotics experts can sometimes spot the bright green
stalks hidden among the dense brush, even from altitudes of 500 feet.
But the best tools for finding the farms are still night vision
goggles and infrared sensors, which can detect body heat during low
passes by a helicopter.</TE>
<TE>   The joint federal-county team struck first on Sept. 3 in an area
called Cherry Creek. Agents uprooted nearly 4,000 plants, Nishimoto
said.</TE>
<TE>   Four smaller plantations totaling about 500 plants were discovered
Sept. 18 and 21 in the Sespe Gorge area west of California 33. On
Sunday, two Los Angeles men were arrested and 85 plants seized near
Mutah Creek.</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert Ramirez, 25, and Bernardo Bueno, 46, were being held at
Ventura County Jail on suspicion of marijuana cultivation. Because
they are undocumented, there is no bail, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, after additional surveillance revealed at least four
more pot plantations lining a two-mile stretch of Upper Matilija
Creek, a team of deputies fanned out and blocked every dirt entry to
the gorge.</TE>
<TE>   At 11:30 p.m. Tuesday, deputies arrested two men and a juvenile
boy, all from Mira Loma, as the group emerged from the forest. A
fourth man from Ventura County was arrested nearby.</TE>
<TE>   The three who were found on the street gave deputies little
information, other than to say they were hired for a few hundred
dollars to tend to the plants.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm absolutely elated we found people ... because the locations
are so far off the beaten path and very hard to sneak up on," said
Ray Gould, a patrol captain with the Forest Service.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities believe the men were caring for up to 1,000 plants at
various sites scattered along the gorge. At campsites, deputies found
a shotgun, a pistol and piles of garbage, as well as pesticides,
detergents and poisons used to enhance plant growth.</TE>
<TE>   The agents returned to the gorge Wednesday to continue uprooting
and cutting down plants.</TE>
<TE>   At least 2,000 more plants were bundled into large bricks and
flown to a small landing area, where they were lowered onto a flatbed
truck.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the pot will be taken to a county jail facility, where
deputies will bury the dead plants. Deputies may remain in the gorge
for several more days, removing more pot plants and looking for more
suspects, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   "During the cultivation season, we are effective because we can
take a little piece of their pie away," said Sgt. Bob Garcia, who
headed the operation. "We do what we can do."</TE>

<HD>Roofless Refuge on Skid Row</HD>
<DH>Aid: Foldaway beds in a parking lot lure many from
doorways. 'It does point out the absence of other options,' says one
grateful man.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARLA RIVERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the corner of 4th and Los Angeles streets downtown, homeless
people begin lining up at 8:30 a.m. for a chance to sleep that night
in skid row's newest shelter.</LD>
<LD>   But rather than swapping cold sidewalks for a bed inside, the
early birds are waiting much of the day for a bunk under the stars.</LD>
<LD>   For about a week, the Midnight Mission has been using its parking
lot as an overnight refuge--with 60 fold-away beds, three portable
toilets, heat lamps and security--for homeless people who would
otherwise sleep on the streets.</LD>
<TE>   The bivouac--erected each afternoon in the narrow lot and taken
down in the morning--was scheduled to be formally dedicated this
evening in ceremonies attended by city officials.</TE>
<TE>   Called Project Safe Sleep, it is being applauded for providing a
sanctuary for people with nowhere else to go and by business owners
pleased by the prospect that fewer homeless people will seek shelter
in their doorways.</TE>
<TE>   But it is also lamented by many advocates for the homeless as a
reflection of skid row's sorry conditions; that beds exposed to the
elements have become an acceptable alternative for the 11,000 people
experts estimate live on the streets or in other temporary shelters
or hotels in downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The new program has served nearly 500 people since it began and
turns away about 30 people each night, said Midnight Mission
President Larry L. Adamson.</TE>
<TE>   It is funded by a $25,000 neighborhood block grant from the city
of Los Angeles and about $15,000 of the mission's own funds. The
program may expand to more parking lots.</TE>
<TE>   "If somebody can come to us and we can give them a bed rather than
sleep on the sidewalk or in a cardboard box--it's small dent but it's
a start," said Adamson.</TE>
<TE>   The Midnight Mission, an institution downtown for nearly 90 years,
has other programs that house and feed homeless people, helping them
to overcome addictions. But those occupying the 172 beds inside the
mission's skid row headquarters can't come and go as they please and
must follow a much stricter regimen than those in the parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent evening, dozens of homeless people filed into the
44-foot by 108-foot lot, registering at the gate and being assigned
cots, which are lined up in five rows with crisp white bedding and
orange blankets.</TE>
<TE>   Men's and women's beds are on opposite sides of the lot. Residents
are allowed to bring a bag of personal belongings to the bed and a
storage shed provides space for other articles.</TE>
<TE>   One of the portable toilets is equipped for those with handicaps
and another has a sink for washing up. There are trash bins and the
mission provides books to read before the floodlights--attached to
the side of the building--go out at 10 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Frequently, evening snacks are available and the mission cooks
breakfast before residents must head out by 6 a.m. In anticipation of
winter, the mission hopes to construct an awning to shelter people
from rain, said program director Carrie E. Gatlin.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the residents get to their beds and quickly fall asleep,
but others chat. Darrell Carter, 37, who has been homeless for a few
years, was bunking next to newfound friend Stan Watson, 41, who was
newly homeless after staying with relatives. Both had spent several
nights at the facility since it opened.</TE>
<TE>   "It's cool, because you can come get in line and get a bed without
going through hoops or having connections," said Carter, who has
stayed in traditional shelters and camped next to the Los Angeles
River while trying to overcome drug addiction. "I feel comfortable
here. I don't mind being outside; I can smoke. But it does point out
the absence of other options. There are not nearly enough shelter
beds or SRO's [single room occupancy hotels]."</TE>
<TE>   Bob Erlenbusch, executive director of the Los Angeles Coalition to
End Hunger and Homelessness, said the open-air facility made him
uneasy.</TE>
<TE>   "On one level it's a decent thing to do to provide a safe space
for people, because the homeless are far more often the victims of
violence," he said. "But it's sad that this is acceptable."</TE>
<TE>   Adamson, of the Midnight Mission, acknowledged that the outdoor
beds could be perceived negatively. But cost constraints and lack of
space in his program and other programs downtown hinder more
ambitious plans, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Many homeless people suffer from mental illnesses and alcohol and
drug addictions and often resist entering traditional indoor shelters
with more rules, said service providers. The new camp prohibits
drinking and violent behavior but its popularity, said mission
officials, shows that this difficult population may eventually be
coaxed into accepting other services.</TE>
<TE>   Getting homeless people off the streets is essential for the
business community and for new residents in downtown lofts who have
complained about conditions, said City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo. He has
asked business owners to identify other parking lots where the
program might expand, he said, and some have indicated a willingness
to help pay the cost.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not a cure, nor is it the ultimate answer," he conceded.
"But it does offer them added amenities and hopefully a window of
opportunity to get to a place where they do have a roof over their
head and dignity."</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Capt. Jim Rubert, whose territory includes skid row, said his
Central Division office has received no negative reports about the
facility. Officers drive past each evening and provide the mission
with a telephone line to the watch commander in case of trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "This is another alternative we can give to people, especially
those who are shelter-resistant and don't like going inside," said
Rubert.</TE>

<HD>3 Ordered to Stand Trial in Teen Death</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three people, including a 16-year-old girl, were ordered Wednesday to
stand trial in the stabbing death of a student who tried to break up
a gang fight outside his Glendale high school.</LD>
<LD>   Anait Msryan, 16; Rafael Gevorgyan, 17; and Karen Terteryan, 20,
are charged with murder in the May 5, 2000, gang slaying of
17-year-old Raul Aguirre, the attempted murder of rival gang member
Jimmy Orozco and street terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Terteryan, who also is charged with the special circumstance of
intentionally killing Aguirre to further criminal street-gang
activities, faces life in prison without parole if convicted. The
other two could be sentenced to a maximum of 35 years to life.</LD>
<TE>   "This is your classic case of gang warfare," Deputy Dist. Atty.
Darrell Mavis said.</TE>
<TE>   During the preliminary hearing, police witnesses testified that
Terteryan, an Armenian Power gang member, was in a black car driven
by Msryan when he flashed gang signs at Orozco in front of Hoover
High School as students were leaving school for the day. Orozco
responded with signs from his own Westside Locos gang.</TE>
<TE>   Police officers testified that Terteryan and Gevorgyan, armed with
a tire iron, jumped out of Msryan's car and assaulted Orozco while
students looked on.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't care about witnesses; they were there to send a
message: Don't mess with Armenian Power," Mavis said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say that Aguirre, a high school senior planning to
join the Marines after graduation, tried to disarm Gevorgyan when
Terteryan stabbed him to death. Orozco fled the scene and was not
seriously injured.</TE>
<TE>   In court, defense lawyers argued that their clients should be held
on lesser charges.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Theodore Flier said Msryan, who was 14 when she was
charged with murder as an adult, is not a gang member and drove the
others to the school not knowing that someone would be killed. He
said her worst offense is being an accessory after the fact--but not
the more serious charge of aiding and abetting in Aguirre's murder
and Orozco's attempted murder.</TE>
<TE>   Mavis, however, said Msryan turned her car around and was a
getaway driver for Gevorgyan, and wore a bloodied sweatshirt after
the killing. He also showed the judge photographs from Msryan's
scrapbook of her wearing gang clothes and pointing a handgun.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Andrew Flier told the judge that although Gevorgyan might
have hit Aguirre with a tire iron, "My client did not kill anyone."</TE>
<TE>   He said Gevorgyan was on the ground in a defensive position when
Aguirre was stabbed twice in the chest and twice in the back, causing
his death. He also argued that Gevorgyan is not a gang member and
should be charged with the less serious crime of assaulting Aguirre
with a deadly weapon.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Mark Geragos said Terteryan was acting in self-defense
when he stabbed Aguirre, who was standing over a fallen Gevorgyan
when he was killed. He said his client should be charged with
manslaughter but not murder.</TE>
<TE>   Despite those arguments, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge
William R. Chidsey Jr. found sufficient evidence to order each
defendant to trial on all the pending charges. The next court hearing
is Oct. 8.</TE>
<TE>   Chidsey also denied defense motions to reduce the $1-million bail
now set for Msryan and Gevorgyan. Terteryan is being held without
bail. All three defendants have been in custody since their May 2000
arrests.</TE>

<HD>Jones Calls for Federal Probe of Davis' Fund-Raising</HD>
<DH>Politics: Secretary of state says he suspects that the
governor 'has crossed the line ... into criminal activity.' Davis
camp denies links to policy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIRGINIA ELLIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Secretary of State Bill Jones urged the U.S. Department of Justice on
Wednesday to investigate Gov. Gray Davis' fund-raising, likening it
to the activities of a former state senator convicted of racketeering
because he sold access to his office.</LD>
<LD>   Jones, a Republican whose daughter works in the campaign of Davis
challenger Bill Simon Jr., cited newspaper stories reporting the
proximity of contributions to official action as evidence of possible
illegal activity.</LD>
<LD>   "I believe that recent evidence strongly suggests that Gov. Davis
has crossed the line from simply poor judgment into criminal
activity," Jones said.</LD>
<TE>   Democratic campaign officials scoffed at the accusation, insisting
that Jones' attack on Davis was an attempt to ingratiate himself to
the Republican Party in the hope of finding employment when his term
expires in January. Jones was defeated by Simon in the gubernatorial
primary election.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor does not connect contributions to policy decisions,"
Davis campaign spokesman Roger Salazar said. "He only bases his
policy decisions on what is in the best interest of the people of the
state of California. If he receives contributions, he puts them out
there for everybody to see and they can judge them for themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Jones announced his appeal to the Justice Department on the steps
of the new federal building in downtown Sacramento as uninvited
Democrats paraded behind him carrying placards lettered in red with
the words "Simon fraud." It was a reference to a Los Angeles Superior
Court jury's decision to order William E. Simon &amp; Sons to pay $78
million in damages for fraud and other misconduct. A Superior Court
judge later ruled that the Simon family did not commit fraud and
overturned the verdict.</TE>
<TE>   The accusations from Jones, a longtime advocate for campaign
finance reform, come as Davis is facing increasing criticism for his
fund-raising activities. Since taking office nearly four years ago he
has collected more than $62 million in campaign contributions.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not indicting fund-raising," Jones said. "I'm indicting a
process that apparently links fund-raising with policy."</TE>

<HD>In Mailers, Davis Keeps Up Attack</HD>
<DH>Politics: Hit pieces are sent to specific groups. Message
to women says Simon will try to end abortion rights.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After months of questioning Republican gubernatorial nominee Bill
Simon Jr.'s business ethics, Gov. Gray Davis is opening a new front
of attack against his opponent: painting him as a right-wing
extremist.</LD>
<LD>   In a new multimillion-dollar direct mail campaign launched this
week, Davis accuses Simon of siding with the most radical members of
his party and warns that the GOP candidate will try to overturn
abortion rights--something Simon has said he will not do.</LD>
<LD>   The glossy campaign mailers--and others that will go after Simon's
record on the environment and education--will be sent to millions of
Democrats and independents around the state throughout the rest of
the campaign, even as the governor maintains a heavy presence on
television.</LD>
<TE>   The tactic is one that Davis strategists indicated they would use
when Simon, a conservative businessman, won the GOP primary last
spring. But Simon stumbled badly throughout the summer, delaying the
release of his tax returns and enduring a fraud verdict against his
family's investment firm--events that gave the governor material for
a series of television commercials. With the tax issue behind Simon
and the verdict thrown out, the governor's campaign is now going
after Simon's conservative stances, a theme Davis used four years ago
against former Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren.</TE>
<TE>   Davis "didn't have to use this before, because Simon has been
shooting himself in the foot," said Barbara O'Connor, the head of the
Institute for Media and Politics at Cal State Sacramento. "So he
saved this one for later."</TE>
<TE>   Several political analysts said that Davis' assault on Simon's
conservatism, coupled with his recent signing of several bills
favored by liberals, indicates that the Democratic governor is
anxious to motivate his core supporters during a campaign in which
many voters have indicated dissatisfaction with both candidates.</TE>
<TE>   "He has to do it, because he can't afford the base of the party to
be indifferent to the election," said Bruce Cain, director of UC
Berkeley's Institute of Governmental Studies. "The whole point is you
aren't worried that they're going to vote for Simon," Cain added.
"You're worried that they won't show up at all."</TE>
<TE>   Davis spokesman Roger Salazar insisted that Simon has a bigger
problem holding onto his base than Davis does, but he agreed that the
new mailers are designed to energize Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   "What we want to do is make sure our base voters do know what the
difference is between the two candidates," Salazar said. "As they
learn more and more about where [Simon] stands, they'll come out in
force."</TE>
<TE>   And by sending mail pieces specifically to women,
environmentalists and ethnic groups, Davis is attempting to get out
his message without alienating other voters, experts said. In fact,
just as the mailers are being sent out, the Davis campaign began
airing two new positive television commercials that focus on the
governor's work on education and veterans' issues.</TE>
<TE>   "People are truly, truly nauseated by the persistent drumbeat of
negative ads, and I'm sure their focus groups are telling them that,"
O'Connor said. "So it's very smart to send this message in a
different venue."</TE>
<TE>   This week, women around the state will receive the first round of
mailers, which warn that Simon is opposed to abortion. The GOP
candidate has stated that he is pro-life, but that he would uphold
current California laws protecting abortion.</TE>
<TE>   However, the Davis mailers claim that Simon "would overturn the
right to choose" and that he has ties to "anti-choice extremists."
One piece features a photo of a stern young woman on the cover with
her arms crossed and the words "Don't Go There." Inside, the mailer
reads: "There's only one way to stop Simon and his radical
anti-choice agenda. Vote to protect your rights." Another mailer
called "Women We Trust" features photos of Sens. Hillary Rodham
Clinton, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer and Rep. Loretta Sanchez,
and highlights Davis' endorsements from pro-choice groups such as
Planned Parenthood. Future pieces will focus on crime, education and
the environment.</TE>
<TE>   The Simon campaign blasted the Davis mailers as "scare tactics."</TE>
<TE>   "Gray Davis has sunk to a new low," said Simon campaign spokesman
Mark Miner, noting Simon's promise not to overturn abortion rights.
"You have a desperate governor that is attacking like a rabid dog in
a cage."</TE>
<TE>   Salazar defended the mailers, saying that Simon has not had a
consistent position on abortion. "It's hard to take him at his word,
when his track record shows he's very much involved in the movement
to overturn a woman's right to choose," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some Republican political experts said the governor's campaign
will have a difficult time convincing voters that Simon is an
extremist on certain social issues.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a tough sell," said GOP consultant Dan Schnur.
"Abortion and guns were the issues Davis relied on to get elected
four years ago, but to a large degree, Lungren cooperated with him by
emphasizing those issues as much as Davis did. Simon has been much
more careful."</TE>
<TE>   Miner said that voters would not be moved by the pieces, adding
that soon the Simon campaign will launch its own paid media effort to
combat Davis' campaign. Simon, who is currently not running
television ads, filmed footage for new commercials in Los Angeles on
Tuesday, but his campaign would not say when they would air. On
Wednesday, Republican National Committee Chairman Mark Racicot said
that national Republicans would be funneling some $1 million to $2
million to Simon's campaign for governor, enough to buy about a
week's worth of statewide television ads.</TE>
<TE>   "We will have a game plan in place that we are confident will
bring votes to Bill Simon," Miner said.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Simon reiterated his criticism of how the governor
managed the state's finances, a message he has been hammering at all
week. During an address to the California Fire Chief Assn.'s annual
convention, the GOP nominee said that Davis mishandled the budget,
creating a shortfall that will force local governments to cut money
for fire and police.</TE>
<TE>   "Gray Davis shouldn't be playing politics with firefighting, but
that's exactly what he's doing when he nickel-and-dimes you," said
Simon, speaking at an Ontario hotel. "Firefighting isn't some luxury
that can be dispensed with."</TE>
<TE>   As the candidate spoke, the massive Williams Canyon blaze raged
along the San Gabriel Mountains just miles away, clouding the air
outside the hotel with thick ashy smoke.</TE>
<TE>   During his speech, however, Simon did not mention the nearby
wildfire.</TE>

<HD>Action on Homeless Delayed</HD>
<DH>Santa Monica: The council puts off a decision on tougher
policies for two weeks amid intense debate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTHA GROVES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After hearing nearly four hours of emotional testimony, the Santa
Monica City Council early Wednesday postponed for two weeks a vote on
two ordinances designed to make the city's downtown less hospitable
to homeless people.</LD>
<LD>   The proposals have launched a highly charged debate in this
seaside community of 88,000, which has long had a reputation for
compassion toward the homeless but appears to be growing weary of the
seemingly intractable problem.</LD>
<LD>   One proposal would prohibit lying or sitting in downtown doorways
from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. The other seeks to limit food giveaways in
city parks by requiring the distributors to comply with
community-events laws and county health codes.</LD>
<TE>   Some residents, business owners and tourists complain that the
abundant weekday meals lure indigents, who then linger and, in some
cases, exhibit antisocial behavior, such as public defecation or
aggressive panhandling.</TE>
<TE>   It was 12:40 a.m. Wednesday when the seven bleary-eyed council
members heard from the last of more than 130 individuals, many of
them homeless men and women toting duffel and shopping bags, who had
signed up to offer their two minutes' worth on the topic.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can't be on public property and can't be on private
property, what are we supposed to do? Levitate?" asked Jennafer
Yellowhorse, editor of Making Change, a newspaper for the homeless.</TE>
<TE>   Several homeless individuals offered tearful testimony, saying
that it would violate their civil rights to curb the handouts. One
activist vowed to go to court should the ordinance pass.</TE>
<TE>   "Voices were heard from sides of the issue we didn't even know
existed," said Mayor Pro Tem Kevin McKeown, who has spoken out
against the ordinances. "We now have two weeks to think about it."</TE>
<TE>   Residents who paraded before the council differed sharply in their
views, with some advocating the new rules and others saying that they
feared that vagrants would migrate into residential areas.</TE>
<TE>   Many observers said the decision to postpone the council
discussion and vote to Oct. 8 reflected the overwhelming complexity
of the homeless problem.</TE>
<TE>   On any given day, the city has about 1,000 transients. The 22
social service agencies that help homeless people do not have the
resources to help them all.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of homeless individuals take advantage of brown-bag meals
doled out most weekdays by as many as 30 groups that travel from as
far away as Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the food giveaways said the meals should be indoors and
linked to services, such as job training or treatment for mental
disorders or substance abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Several activists who attended the meeting, which began early
Tuesday evening, voiced hope that the food distributors might start
joining forces on their own with social service organizations.</TE>
<TE>   John Maceri, executive director of the Ocean Park Community
Center, has been talking with HOPE (Helping Other People Eat), Loyola
Marymount University and other food providers about collaborating.
"My sense," Maceri said, "is there will be some sort of compromise."</TE>

<LD>Several law enforcement agencies issued 45 citations to truckers
Wednesday and took three vehicles off the road during inspections at
two checkpoints.</LD>
<LD>   The checkpoints were at Warner Avenue and Construction Circle, and
at Barranca Parkway and Construction Circle, said Irvine police
spokesman Wally Prestidge.</LD>
<LD>   Forty-one of the citations were for mechanical violations, such as
oil leaks and faulty lights, he said. The three vehicles taken off
the road had such defects as cracked frames, defective brakes and
illegal tire tread depth, Prestidge said.</LD>

<LD>There was no problem--it was just a case of faulty arithmetic. The
Los Alamitos News-Enterprise said a report of "a small child heard
screaming frequently for the last month" turned out to be 2-year-old
twins.</LD>
<LD>   Here's something that will keep tots quiet: Debbe Nye found a
product for parents who want their kids to start knitting at a very
early age (see accompanying).</LD>
<LD>   Not a banner year: One of the innumerable sideshow characters of
the O.J. Simpson trial was Pilot Bob, who delivered his own
commentary on aerial banners towed over the courthouse. One
complimented prosecutors Marcia Clark and Chris Darden on their work
(see photo), and another asked Clark out to lunch.</LD>
<TE>   Pilot Bob, whose last name is Dobry, runs an aerial advertising
service out of Long Beach, and he was back in the news the other day,
protesting Huntington Beach's ban against such banners. I guess it
wasn't a good time to ask him about the invitation to Clark.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just a guy asking a girl out to lunch," he said. Did Clark
get back to him?</TE>
<TE>   "I'd rather not comment," Pilot Bob said.</TE>
<TE>   He did say that he plans to fly over Huntington Beach to test the
constitutionality of the law. I can't wait to see what Pilot Bob has
to say then.</TE>
<TE>   Word imperfect: Tony LaHood of Irvine noticed a typo in an
appropriate book title (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Life's little ironies: I'm sure Will Rogers, the cowboy-turned-
humorist, would have gotten a chuckle out of the sign spotted by
Stuart Muller at Will Rogers State Beach: "No Horseback Riding."</TE>
<TE>   Sizing Up Saddam: An Orange County chiropractor sent The Times a
fax saying he could transform Saddam Hussein into a more humane
person.</TE>
<TE>   "He obviously has what I refer to as a subluxated mind," the
specialist said. "His behavior would change dramatically if his body
and mind were, to use a chiropractic term, 'properly adjusted.' " The
chiropractor, needless to say, is not the only one who would like to
get his hands on Saddam.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Matt Mulqueen of North Hills submitted today's "Duh!"
award-winner: instructions for a Timex watch that include a chapter
titled: "How to Tell Time." Example (in case you're a bit hazy): "The
minute hand points to the minute numbers. The minute numbers are the
small numbers."</TE>
<TE>   I wonder if the instructions for my watch also said: "The minute
hand will be running five minutes fast after six months." Glitches
like that really subluxate my mind.</TE>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>California prisoners have a constitutional right to be released on
parole if they meet the requirements of state law, the U.S. 9th
Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   A three-member panel of the federal appeals court decided
unanimously that Carl McQuillion, 53, who was convicted of two Long
Beach murders in 1973, should be released from state prison.</LD>
<LD>   The court said state parole officials presented no evidence to
justify revoking McQuillion's 1994 parole date six months before his
scheduled release. Gov. Pete Wilson had appointed the parole board
that rescinded the release date.</LD>
<TE>   McQuillion, who has become a motivational speaker in prison, had
unsuccessfully appealed the recision in state courts, including the
California Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Monica Knox, a deputy federal public defender who is representing
McQuillion, said the ruling will remove one hurdle prosecutors erect
to prevent inmates from being released on parole, but the effect on
the parole system should not be dramatic.</TE>
<TE>   No significant impact is expected on a major parole case pending
before the California Supreme Court. In that case, the state high
court will decide whether Gov. Gray Davis can block the release of
inmates who have been found suitable for parole by the state Board of
Prison Terms.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's ruling, written by Judge William A. Fletcher, said the
state needed to present some evidence to support its 1994 decision to
rescind McQuillion's release date. The court found that there was no
new evidence.</TE>
<TE>   The original decision to grant McQuillion parole was made in 1977,
when a board determined that he was no longer a threat to the public.
Based on his conduct in prison, he received the 1994 release date in
1979. In rescinding parole as "improvidently granted," the board in
1994 considered all the same evidence that the earlier panel had
studied, the court said.</TE>
<TE>   "The recision panel obviously disagreed with the substance of the
granting panel's decision," Fletcher wrote. "But this does not mean
that the granting panel did not adequately consider the evidence
before it."</TE>
<TE>   McQuillion and an accomplice entered a sporting goods store in
Long Beach on Dec. 26, 1970, and killed the proprietors, a father and
his son. McQuillion said he was in the process of tying up the son
when the son tried to reach for his gun. McQuillion shot him, and his
accomplice shot the father.</TE>
<TE>   McQuillion was sentenced to life in prison. While a prisoner, he
has formed organizations to help new inmates adjust and has helped
inmates with legal questions.</TE>
<TE>   Knox said McQuillion met an ex-convict when he was 18 and went on
a three-year rampage of robberies. He had no previous record, she
said. "They always went to great lengths not to hurt anybody," she
said. "In the Long Beach robbery, the plan was not to hurt anybody."</TE>
<TE>   Knox has said McQuillion will work with other convicts to help
them adjust to life after prison when he is released. He already has
been permitted to leave prison for short periods to give speeches.</TE>

<HD>Tide Turns for Rescued Sailor as Offers of Boats and Aid
Pour In</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEE ROMNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Offers of free boats and financial help poured in Wednesday for a
Vietnamese-born sailor who says he spent nearly four months drifting
at sea after a Santa Catalina Island voyage went horribly awry.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Van Pham's saga may never be fully confirmed--he lived and
sailed alone, and many details of his life remain uncertain. But his
unlikely tale of survival--he says he subsisted on tuna, sea turtles
and rainwater as he drifted aimlessly with a broken mast, motor and
radio--captivated and amazed recreational sailors and others across
the Southland. Several said they'd like to give Pham another boat.</LD>
<LD>   "He has an inner strength that is not based on education or money,
but on personal strength," said Erwin Freund, a 49-year-old Amgen
scientist who hopes to donate a 25-foot Coronado Sloop to Pham, who
lost nearly all his possessions when he abandoned his disabled
26-foot home, the Sea Breeze, about 300 miles off Costa Rica.</LD>
<TE>   Freund said he has sailed for two years and is "super-cautious,
overcautious" about safety, never leaving his slip without his Global
Positioning System and radar equipment. But, faced with the
conditions that sidetracked Pham, he would have faltered.</TE>
<TE>   "His boat was not properly equipped. He did not have the proper
gear. But he maintained a positive attitude where I would have
panicked," said Freund. "He's someone who is really a role model."</TE>
<TE>   The diminutive Pham recounted his harrowing tale from a hotel room
Tuesday, proudly sporting a crisp baseball cap from the Navy frigate
McClusky, which rescued him off the Central American coast last week.</TE>
<TE>   An Elusive History</TE>
<TE>   That story, like the 62-year-old Pham, proved elusive Wednesday.
Although he says he lived for several years on his boat in Long
Beach's downtown marina, city records show he paid to stay there for
only four days in May. Addresses on identification cards that Pham
carried show that he had bounced around downtown Los Angeles and
MacArthur Park since 1998, living the life of a drifter.</TE>
<TE>   When he left for what he says he intended as a three-day jaunt to
Catalina, Pham filed no float plan, so no one knew where he was
going. When he disappeared for nearly four months, no one reported
him missing. Wednesday, as offers of help poured in, Pham was swept
into a broadcast news vehicle after meeting with a Travelers Aid
social worker at Los Angeles International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Pham had arrived at LAX at 9 p.m. Monday on a flight from Mexico
City. Sailors aboard the McClusky had taken up a collection to
provide him enough money for a ticket back to Los Angeles after they
rescued him. After he arrived, he was kept overnight in the custody
of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in downtown Los
Angeles, said Francisco Arcaute, a spokesman for the INS.</TE>
<TE>   A man found alone in a boat in a highly trafficked drug corridor
raises obvious suspicions, and officials were eager to ensure that
Pham's record was clean.</TE>
<TE>   "We had multiple questions on this individual, given the
circumstances of his rescue and whatnot," the spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, INS officers ran his name through law enforcement
databases, but no pending charges or immigration irregularities were
found, the spokesman said. Pham was finally allowed to leave sometime
Tuesday afternoon and was taken to Travelers Aid, the spokesman
added.</TE>
<TE>   A Navy spokesman said the McClusky sailors were on a
counter-narcotics mission and would have spotted anything untoward.
Still, Pham's story is spectacular, and his solitary nature ensures
that many parts of it cannot be entirely corroborated.</TE>
<TE>   According to that account, after arriving from Vietnam in 1976,
Pham built a life as a successful entrepreneur. He opened three
furniture stores, in North Hollywood, Culver City and Los Angeles,
and an auto repair business. But about a decade ago, he said, an auto
accident left him in a coma for six months. When he regained
consciousness, he had lost much of his memory and was forced to
relearn even the most basic tasks.</TE>
<TE>   "My memories before the accident, they are gray, with no
pictures," Pham explained.</TE>
<TE>   Pham said the accident also drained his savings. He slowly built a
new life, living on disability checks and "traveling a lot."</TE>
<TE>   "I had a girlfriend for a while, but she didn't like that I
traveled so much," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His dream was the ocean: "I love nature. I love the ocean. I
wanted to sail it every day."</TE>
<TE>   For the past few years, he said, he took mostly short trips, to
Catalina and the Channel Islands. But he also took one six-month
round-trip voyage to the coast of Chile. And he had carefully
calculated that it would take six months to cross the ocean to his
native Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   It was on yet another of his trips to Catalina, he said, that his
misadventure began: a hook that secured his mast to the boat snapped
and his radio failed. From that point, Pham drifted for 2,500 miles,
never catching a glimpse of land or a single boat or plane, he said.
He had a two-month supply of water, rice and canned beans and
tomatoes. But when they ran out, he was forced to collect rainwater
and eat from the sea.</TE>
<TE>   He caught plenty of tuna, hooking them easily without bait. He
cooked one seagull, but although he thought it looked like a chicken,
"it tasted worse."</TE>
<TE>   Turtles Top Menu</TE>
<TE>   Best of all, he said, were the sea turtles, docile giants that
swam right next to his silent boat. He was able to tie a rope around
their front legs, then winch the creatures--which weigh several
hundred pounds--onto the deck.</TE>
<TE>   The turtles swam by only on occasion, Pham recounted, so he would
trap them and save them alive until he needed them. When they moaned
from the heat, he sprayed them down with water to cool them. He
cooked the meat on a makeshift grill fed by wood paneling he tore
from the boat.</TE>
<TE>   Pham was finally spotted by a U.S. Customs drug-hunting plane,
which directed the McClusky, a 453-foot guided-missile frigate, to
the dilapidated sailboat.</TE>
<TE>   When they found him, he asked only for help repairing his boat and
some vitamin B supplements. When sailors were forced to sink his
vessel as unsound, he fetched few belongings, his green card among
them, the ship's captain recounted.</TE>
<TE>   It was those details that touched strangers Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Emberson, a Los Angeles actor and "adventure guy," said he
read Pham's story and cried.</TE>
<TE>   "You hear survival stories all the time. But people on Mt. Everest
have money, resources and family. This guy had nothing," said
Emberson, who was trying to pool donations from fellow actors at the
Playhouse West Repertory Theater. "If there's anybody worthy of my
time, it's someone like this."</TE>
<TE>   'Like Robinson Crusoe'</TE>
<TE>   "I've never heard of a story like this before. It's a lot like
Robinson Crusoe, but with a Vietnamese person," said Hiep Cao Nguyen,
35, of Garden Grove.</TE>
<TE>   What awaits Pham is unclear. Tuesday night, he said he might
settle into an apartment for a short while to regain his bearings.
Then, he added, he will probably drift some more.</TE>
<TE>   If Freund catches up with him, Pham might do his future drifting
aboard a 1968 sloop that seems to be more seaworthy than Pham's boat
ever was. It has five sails, a radio, flare kit, first aid kit, man
overboard pole and float, and quite a few spare ropes, Freund said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty neat," Freund said. "I'd like him to have it."</TE>

<HD>Irvine Will Spend $13 Million to Replace 3 Swimming Pools</HD>
<DH>Recreation: City and the school district OK plans to
create the county's largest aquatic center.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>School and city officials in Irvine have agreed on an ambitious plan
to plow under three public swimming pools and construct a
$13.4-million aquatic facility, creating the largest such complex in
the county.</LD>
<LD>   The work already has displaced the Novaquatics, a nationally
renowned swim program.</LD>
<LD>   "You either pay me now or pay me later," said John McAllister,
Irvine's deputy director of community services. "You have to do it
now because the pools are failing. It's a hard bite to take for a lot
of people, but it'll be worth it in the long run."</LD>
<TE>   The plan, which calls for the city to spend $10.4 million to
refurbish the three pools at Heritage Aquatic Park Complex, was
unanimously approved Tuesday by the City Council. In August, the
Irvine Unified School District agreed to spend $3 million to help the
city renovate and expand Irvine High's pool, one of the three at the
park. The expansion means the park will have two Olympic-size
50-meter pools and one 25-meter pool for recreational swimming. No
other facility in the county has two 50-meter pools.</TE>
<TE>   The Novaquatics, which produced 2000 Olympic medalists Amanda
Beard, Aaron Peirsol and Jason Lezak, will be the main beneficiary of
the remodeled pools, which are expected to open in spring 2004.</TE>
<TE>   But for the next 18 months, the Novaquatics will be scattered
around the county. Some members are training at Soka University in
Aliso Viejo; others are at Los Caballeros Sports Village in Fountain
Valley. Novaquatics head coach Dave Salo also is negotiating with
several homeowner associations in Irvine for temporary pool space.</TE>
<TE>   The program also is trying to raise $200,000 for a temporary
above-ground 25-meter pool that would be built in an industrial park
on Barranca Parkway. If funds can be raised in the next few months,
Salo said the pool could be ready by March.</TE>
<TE>   Lately, Salo has been simply struggling to keep his team together.
"We've lost a few families but 95% have stayed and endured the
discomfort," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The repairs also will require all four city schools to share
University High's pool for swim meets and water polo games.</TE>

<HD>Top Grade for Garden Grove Unified</HD>
<DH>Education: The district is one of five national finalists
for an achievement prize that will bring the winner $500,000 in
scholarship funds.</DH>

<LD>Garden Grove Unified School District is one of five finalists for a
new national education achievement award that will distribute $1
million in college scholarships.</LD>
<LD>   The Broad Foundation, a Los Angeles organization that promotes
achievement in urban public schools and sponsors the prize, will
announce the winner Wednesday at a ceremony in Washington, D.C.</LD>
<LD>   Garden Grove school officials said they already feel like winners.</LD>
<TE>   "This is the result of the efforts of 5,000 on our staff who all
combined to produce results," the district's board president, Bob
Harden, said Wednesday. "We are one of the top five urban [school
systems] in the entire country. That's a pretty good accomplishment."</TE>
<TE>   The 50,000-student district will receive at least $125,000 in
college scholarship funds reserved for the four runners-up. The
winning district will receive $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   The other finalists are Long Beach Unified School District,
Atlanta Public Schools, Boston Public Schools and Houston Independent
School District.</TE>
<TE>   The Broad Foundation, founded in 1991 with an endowment from
businessman Eli Broad and his family, unveiled the annual Broad Prize
for Urban Education in March. The five finalists were chosen from a
list of 100 large urban school districts. A review board looked at
several factors, including test scores, attendance, dropout rates and
achievement gaps between ethnic and socio-economic groups.</TE>
<TE>   The winner and its teaching and management practices will be
showcased by the foundation over the following year, officials said,
to inspire other urban school systems.</TE>

<HD>Legislators Criticize Proposition 51</HD>
<DH>Politics: Lawmakers decry the proposal's inclusion of
transit projects that would benefit large donors to initiative
campaign.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Saying they'd be in jail if they tried to do what the drafters of
Proposition 51 have done, lawmakers Wednesday lashed out at the
nonprofit Planning and Conservation League as "initiative pimps" who
loaded a traffic congestion relief and safe school bus ballot measure
with special projects for large donors.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm frankly at the point where I'm just kind of disgusted," said
Sen. Kevin Murray (D-Culver City) at the end of a three-hour
legislative hearing about the ballot measure. "I hope the people of
the state of California find it disgusting also."</LD>
<LD>   Planning and Conservation League Executive Director Jerry Meral,
the target of lawmakers, did not appear at the hearing. But he said
afterward that there is nothing illegal about Proposition 51, which
is on the November ballot.</LD>
<TE>   "If those guys were not acting in the role of legislators today,
they would be subject to slander suits," Meral said. "They are
objecting to the fact that we are allowing citizens to decide budget
priorities, and they find that outrageous."</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 51 would not raise additional money for transportation
projects, but instead transfer 30% of the state's sales tax receipts
on used and new vehicles into a new fund loosely aimed at easing
traffic congestion, building bike paths and replacing old school
buses. Experts testified that the measure could shift nearly $1
billion from the general fund next year, forcing lawmakers to cut
spending on public safety, health care and other services.</TE>
<TE>   Written largely by Meral and others at the Sacramento-based
environmental group, Proposition 51 would dedicate money to many
narrowly tailored projects that benefit some financial backers of the
initiative. For example, it includes a $120-million rail line near a
casino in Palm Springs. The casino owners, the Agua Caliente Band of
Cahuilla Indians, donated $125,000 to the Yes on 51 campaign.</TE>
<TE>   In another example of what lawmakers called possibly criminal quid
pro quo in the crafting of Proposition 51, Hillwood Development LLC,
a Texas company trying to develop an industrial site in San
Bernardino, donated $120,000 to the initiative. Proposition 51
earmarks $30 million over four years to separate railways and roads
leading to the company's property.</TE>
<TE>   Such a project doesn't even rank as a priority with San Bernardino
traffic planners, said Norm King, executive director of San
Bernardino Associated Governments. He called Proposition 51 "a sweet
little treat for a handful of PCL favorites."</TE>
<TE>   Meral acknowledged that there is now little congestion along the
route near the former Norton Air Force Base. But preparing the area
for heavier truck and train traffic from Hillwood's proposed
distribution center could help revive San Bernardino economically, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Hillwood is a supporter [of Proposition 51]; that project is in
there; we're happy with both of those situations," Meral said. "We
don't agree with [King's] priorities, sorry. He can make his case,
we'll make our case."</TE>
<TE>   In pointed questioning of the league's transportation director,
Eddy Moore, lawmakers implied that the environmental group did
something forbidden in the Legislature--drafting law in order to win
campaign contributions.</TE>
<TE>   "You find the people you think will benefit, and you seek to raise
money from them?" Assemblyman Rod Pacheco (R-Riverside) said in an
incredulous tone as he repeated one of Moore's answers.</TE>
<TE>   Moore argued that each project listed in Proposition 51 offers
regional or statewide public benefits, regardless of contributors.
The campaign has raised $3 million, $2 million of which was spent
gathering 700,000 signatures to qualify it for the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, lawmakers passed a bill, aimed at the Planning and
Conservation League, to prohibit initiative sponsors from including
projects in exchange for campaign contributions. The league
challenged the law, and in 1995 an appellate court declared it
unconstitutional, finding that it violated the group's right to free
speech.</TE>
<TE>   "The essence of corruption is secrecy," wrote the appellate court.
"However, there is nothing secret about the quid pro quo arrangements
forbidden by SB 424. On the contrary, the voting public is fully
informed of specific appropriations made in an initiative measure and
can decide for itself whether to vote for it."</TE>

<HD>Secessionists' Strategy Team Quits</HD>
<DH>Breakup: Some blame lack of funds for loss of consultants
six weeks before election. Valley, Hollywood campaigns are taken by
surprise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With six weeks to go before election day, the consulting firm that
has been guiding the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood secession
movements said Wednesday that it is quitting the campaign, a move
that sources linked to the breakup drive's failure to pay its bills.</LD>
<LD>   The resignation of Sacramento-based Goddard Claussen Porter
Novelli came a day after the secession drive got a boost by landing
the endorsement of the influential Valley Industry and Commerce Assn.</LD>
<LD>   But the departure of the consulting group adds to the secession
effort's mounting problems. It now approaches the homestretch of the
campaign without a consultant and without money for significant
advertising--and it faces an opponent that has both.</LD>
<TE>   "Goddard Claussen has resigned from both the Valley and Hollywood
independence campaigns," firm partner Rick Claussen said in a
statement. "We have left the door open for scenarios where Goddard
Claussen might assist the campaign with specific assignments. We wish
the campaign all the best and a victory in November."</TE>
<TE>   Claussen declined to elaborate. Sources familiar with the
campaign, however, said a major factor in the firm's decision was
that the Valley Independence Committee owed Goddard Claussen about
$100,000 in fees, and was not raising enough money to run an
effective campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "The fund-raising fell far short of expectations to run the kind
of campaign that needs to be run," one source said.</TE>
<TE>   Another source said Goddard Claussen felt the Valley campaign
should have been sending out mailers and running television ads by
now, but the lack of money delayed those efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Katz, the Valley Independence Committee co-chairman, said
it owed the firm only about $25,000. He was surprised to learn from a
reporter that the campaign firm had resigned, but he downplayed the
loss.</TE>
<TE>   "Campaigns go through different stages and [Goddard Claussen] had
done a lot of their work," Katz said, noting the firm had completed a
media strategy plan.</TE>
<TE>   "We have everything we need," Katz said. "We were talking about
keeping them on. But I don't think it's a very big deal at all."</TE>
<TE>   Katz did concede that the secession campaign is "underfunded." The
Valley committee reported in July that it had raised $75,000, of
which $50,000 came from Hollywood secession leader Gene La Pietra.
Secession leaders originally predicted they would raise between $4
million and $5 million.</TE>
<TE>   In comparison, Mayor James K. Hahn's anti-secession campaign
reported $2 million raised in July and now has more than $3 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley and Hollywood secession proposals are on the Nov. 5
ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Valley mayoral candidate Mel Wilson called Wednesday's development
bad news. "I'm glad I'm not dependent on [the Valley Independence
Committee] for my campaign," said Wilson, a Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   In Hollywood, La Pietra also was caught off guard.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to be kidding," he said when told by a reporter of the
Goddard Claussen announcement.</TE>
<TE>   However, La Pietra said the Hollywood campaign had not used the
company much since August, as it brought on its own campaign manager
and media consulting team. "It's not disappointing to us because
we've got our own campaign team," La Pietra said.</TE>
<TE>   According to sources within the Hollywood campaign, Hollywood
secessionists essentially stopped paying a share of the fees to
Goddard Claussen in July for budget reasons, choosing instead to hire
their own staff for public relations.</TE>
<TE>   The hiring of Goddard Claussen was announced with great fanfare in
April. But signs of discord were present from the beginning.</TE>
<TE>   In an incident shortly after the firm was hired, Gerry Gunster,
who was assigned by the firm to manage the Valley campaign, was
confronted by secession activists about why the campaign was not
doing more.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Gunster said he had a secret plan that he did not
want to discuss in front of the public.</TE>
<TE>   "We learned one thing: They were able to keep their plan secret,"
said Kam Kuwata, an advisor to Hahn. "Because the people of Los
Angeles haven't seen it."</TE>
<TE>   Republican political consultant Arnie Steinberg, who has advised
the secessionists, said he had long predicted that Goddard Claussen
would quit. Steinberg said the firm failed to take advantage of early
momentum to push the campaign forward.</TE>
<TE>   "It really leaves them in the lurch," Steinberg said. "It really
shows what can happen to good, well-meaning authentic grass-roots
people who make a bad choice....</TE>
<TE>   "The reason there's no money is that there was no campaign put
together," Steinberg said. "Within a matter of weeks, [Goddard
Claussen] lost the confidence of volunteers, activists and donors."</TE>
<TE>   Secession opponents also said the resignation could be a crippling
setback.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a huge blow to the secession effort to weeks before
the election lose the professionalism and lose the rudder that might
have steered the ship," said Larry Levine, a political consultant and
a founder of the anti-secession group One Los Angeles. He said he
doubted that anyone else would sign on to run the campaign with the
word out that it hasn't paid its bills.</TE>
<TE>   "In my experience in this business, if one of us gets stiffed, the
rest of us don't stand in line to say, 'Hey, stiff me too.' "</TE>
<TE>   Without professionals, Levine said, the secession campaign is in
dire straits.</TE>
<TE>   "All of us in this business from time to time get put in a
position of having to pull a rabbit out of a hat, and we do it," he
said. "But you've got to at least know where the hat is and know a
rabbit when you see it."</TE>
<TE>   Fernando Guerra, director of Loyola Marymount University's Center
for the Study of Los Angeles, said he was "not shocked" by the news.</TE>
<TE>   "They can certainly see when a campaign is going down in flames,
not just because of lack of money, but because of lack of
organization," Guerra said. "And they know if the campaign loses,
they'll never get paid."</TE>
<TE>   Allan Hoffenblum, a longtime Republican strategist, said the
resignation suggests that the secession campaign was unable to scrape
together enough cash to afford many television or radio ads.</TE>
<TE>   "I was somewhat surprised when Goddard Claussen got the contract
to begin with," Hoffenblum said, "because they're known for statewide
initiatives. Their forte is really broadcast media--television and
direct mail--and frankly, that's where the money is in political
consulting. They don't make money on the grass-roots, recruiting
volunteers and knocking on doors and such."</TE>
<TE>   Besides the money, Hoffenblum said he had heard that the
secessionists and Goddard Claussen disagreed about campaign strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Katz renewed a written request Wednesday to have Hahn
face him in a debate.</TE>
<TE>   "Hiding behind his downtown powerbrokers and lead spin-ster Kam
Kuwata is not much of a legacy for the mayor," Katz said.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn told reporters later that he will "probably not" debate Katz,
although he is taking his message to the public daily. He denounced
what he called "shrill" personal attacks by Katz as not adding to the
discussion.</TE>

<HD>Woman Is Acquitted in Road Rage Shooting</HD>
<DH>Trial: Jurors find she acted in self-defense when she
wounded a man during argument on Panorama City street.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 36-year-old mother accused of shooting a man in the head was
acquitted Wednesday on all criminal charges after jurors found she
acted in self-defense.</LD>
<LD>   The jury of nine women and three men deliberated for half a day
before finding Oreyda Paramo not guilty of attempted murder, two
counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm and shooting into an
occupied vehicle.</LD>
<LD>   Paramo hugged her attorneys in the courtroom and was later
reunited with her fiance, Anthony Domio, and 11-year-old son outside
the Van Nuys Courthouse.</LD>
<TE>   Paramo has been held at Twin Towers Correctional Facility in lieu
of $500,000 bail since her Feb. 13 arrest. Domio said Paramo believed
she was innocent and wanted to try to prove it at trial--a decision
that one of her lawyers said was courageous.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really the strong will of [Paramo]," attorney James
McNamara said. "I don't know if I would have done it."</TE>
<TE>   At trial, defense lawyers called a witness who testified that he
saw the victim, Edwin Saltorrez, 37, of New York brandish a gun.
Police, however, did not find a weapon in his vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Saltorrez's sister, Emma Rodriguez, was trying to
pass Paramo, who was double-parked on Willis Street in Panorama City.
There was a heated exchange between the women drivers, and a few
blocks away on Parthenia Street, Paramo shot Saltorrez. He was not
seriously wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Omar Bakari said the witness got Paramo's license plate
number and wrote her a letter offering to help. "This is a good
reason why people should get involved," he said. Otherwise, Paramo, a
first-time offender, faced life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Paul Bronstein said he doesn't believe this is
a case of self-defense. "To me, an argument on the street like that
should not be enough to provoke a gun being exhibited or a gunshot,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   When Paramo gets home, Domio said, he will "take her away and let
her have a couple of days to herself." He said Paramo, who lost 66
pounds while incarcerated, also lost her business and her life
savings paying for her lawyers.</TE>

<LD>At least 8,000 adult salmon have died in the lower Klamath River as
of Wednesday and the numbers are expected to rise over 10,000, said
the California Department of Fish and Game.</LD>
<LD>   The die-off began last week and is believed to be Northern
California's largest in recent years.</LD>
<LD>   Wildlife officials suspect that increased Klamath water
temperatures have made the fish vulnerable to "gill rot," a disease
that prevents salmon from breathing.</LD>

<HD>Hahn Speaks Out on Gift</HD>
<DH>Politics: Mayor says he returned film agency's donation
because it became a distraction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mayor James K. Hahn said Wednesday his return of $25,000 he solicited
from a film-permitting agency for his anti-secession campaign is not
an admission of impropriety, but that the city attorney should
clarify whether the agency is barred from making political donations.</LD>
<LD>   Hollywood secessionists sent a letter Wednesday to City Atty.
Rocky Delgadillo asking that he disqualify Hahn from any review of
spending by the Entertainment Industry Development Corp. because the
$25,000 contribution posed a conflict of interest.</LD>
<LD>   The letter, signed by Alejandro Lopez, a member of the elected
Central Hollywood Neighborhood Council, also called on Hahn to return
$2,000 that EIDC gave his mayoral campaign.</LD>
<TE>   Lopez wrote that Hahn and EIDC Chairman Frank Scherma, whose
company landed a $341,000 contract with the agency, have "taken money
illegally from the public."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said Scherma should also be disqualified from any financial
review of EIDC.</TE>
<TE>   In his first public comments on the issue since he returned the
$25,000, Hahn said on KFWB radio's "Ask the Mayor" program that he
did not consider EIDC a public agency handling public funds, though
it collects film permit fees for the city.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there was anything wrong taking contributions,
because EIDC is not part of city government," Hahn said. "It's a
separate corporation set up to help expedite film permits."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said he gave the money back because the EIDC controversy had
become a distraction to the anti-secession campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor also said Delgadillo's office should determine whether
EIDC is free to make political contributions.</TE>
<TE>   The office said it is researching the matter.</TE>
<TE>   "We ought to get this sorted out," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office is investigating EIDC's spending
practices. Hahn said he welcomed the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor is leading the campaign against the San Fernando Valley
and Hollywood secession measures on the Nov. 5 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, production accountants and location managers on
Wednesday criticized EIDC for its failure to promptly refund unused
portions of deposits they make for city services used during
television and film productions. They said they have been complaining
about the tardy refunds for years.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, they said, it takes months, even years for EIDC to
return the money.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very frustrating," said Victoria Zamora, production
accountant with Oberman, Tivoli, Miller &amp; Pickert, whose clients
include television, film and commercial producers. "The EIDC says
that they're backed up with paperwork."</TE>
<TE>   Ande Hecht, president and co-owner of the accounting firm the
Audit Trail, said, "It's always taken a long time ... it's not in
tune with how we [in the film industry] work." She said it especially
hurts low-budget productions, where "every dime counts."</TE>
<TE>   Another accounting firm said despite regular calls to EIDC, it is
still waiting for deposits from a 1999 project.</TE>
<TE>   EIDC acknowledged it can take from a few months to years to refund
deposits.</TE>
<TE>   "It happens when we haven't received actual charges from the
city," said Sally Lee, the EIDC treasurer. She said city officials
are sometimes late in receiving information from their own employees
on how much money the production companies are due. Interest on those
deposits is reported on financial statements as income by EIDC.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, EIDC said it returned $181,451.55 for 86 projects. So
far this year, the agency has returned $139,034.05 for 63 projects.</TE>

<HD>Exxon to Pay for Cleanup of '91 Spill</HD>
<DH>Oil: The agreement tops $4.7 million. The pipeline break
dumped 75,000 gallons into the Santa Clara River.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eleven years after a broken oil pipeline spilled 75,000 gallons of
sticky crude into the Santa Clara River, an oil company has reached
an agreement with the federal government to pay the cleanup costs.</LD>
<LD>   Within the next few months, Exxon Mobil Corp. will shell out more
than $4.7 million to reimburse a host of public agencies and help pay
for the cleanup of future spills nationwide.</LD>
<LD>   "This was a tough spill," said Laurie Williams, an attorney with
the federal Environmental Protection Agency's Pacific Southwest
Region, which had filed a lawsuit against the oil company before the
agreement was reached.</LD>
<TE>   "The meaning of our action is to alert other companies that not
only are the spills environmentally damaging but it will be expensive
for them."</TE>
<TE>   The spill occurred Jan. 31, 1991, when a 12-inch-diameter pipeline
ruptured in Valencia, near the border between Ventura County and Los
Angeles County. Corrosion caused the section of pipeline to split.</TE>
<TE>   Before the spill was contained in about 10 minutes, oil had dumped
into the adjacent Santa Clara River.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, it was the seventh major accident in less than a
decade for the oil company, then called Mobil Oil.</TE>
<TE>   The company was replacing portions of the pipeline, according to
Williams.</TE>
<TE>   About 250 birds and other animals died in the spill, which
occurred as the oil was being pumped along a 90-mile stretch of
pipeline from a gathering station in Kern County to a refinery in
Torrance, Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly $2.7 million will go to continuing cleanup of the spill
area.</TE>
<TE>   Another $600,000 will go into the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund,
which is set aside for oil-spill cleanups nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Just less than $1 million will be used to reimburse the state
Department of Fish and Game. Crews from the agency assisted in the
cleanup and assessments of the long-term damage to nearby plants and
wildlife.</TE>

<HD>County Is Rated Tops in Food Stamp Accuracy</HD>
<DH>Services: Error rate in administering the program was just
4.5% in 2001, compared with 17.4% statewide.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State and federal officials have lauded Ventura County as the
California county with the highest rate of accuracy in awarding food
stamps.</LD>
<LD>   In a presentation before county supervisors this week, they noted
that Ventura County's success comes as other counties are being
penalized by the federal government for their dismal records.</LD>
<LD>   "Ventura County is a clear example of the best in California and
one of the best in the country," said Dennis Stewart, regional
director of the food stamp program for the U.S. Department of
Agriculture. "It's a very difficult thing for most of the large
counties in California."</LD>
<TE>   In 2001, Ventura County doled out food stamps worth $17 million to
needy families, with an error rate of a little more than 4.5%.
Statewide, the error rate was nearly 17.4%--twice the national
average. The state's error rate brought it a $115-million sanction
from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers the food
stamp program.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers do not necessarily reflect fraud, according to federal
data. In Los Angeles County, which was blamed for most of the
mistakes, there were about 193,000 errors. Roughly two-thirds of the
households on food stamps received more than their legal share and
one-third received less. The county blamed a balky computer system
for the mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, the key to averting error has been the
diligence of employees, said Barbara Fitzgerald, director of the
county's Human Services Agency.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no magic bullet," she told the supervisors as she
accepted a trophy for her staff from state food stamp chief Gary
Swanson.</TE>

<HD>Father Shot, Child Freed as Standoff Ends</HD>
<DH>Crime: Santa Ana police recover the girl unharmed in
23-hour hostage drama. The gunman is reported in critical condition
in Orange hospital.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 23-hour standoff between police and a gunman holding his baby
daughter hostage inside a Santa Ana home ended Wednesday afternoon
when officers shot the suspect and recovered the girl unharmed.</LD>
<LD>   It was a sudden end to a hostage drama that begin as a domestic
dispute between the man and his ex-girlfriend and was punctuated
several times by the suspect's gunfire.</LD>
<LD>   Gabriel Anthony Leon, 25, was in critical condition at UC Irvine
Medical Center in Orange with wounds to the lower back and groin,
authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   His daughter was reunited with her mother. During the standoff,
Leon told police that he had fed his daughter and changed her diaper.
He also threatened to hurt himself and the baby.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Police Sgt. Baltazar De La Riva said Leon was "one of
the most aggressive suspects we've encountered in some time," firing
three times at officers and once at the toddler's mother.</TE>
<TE>   The incident began Tuesday afternoon when Maribel Ramirez brought
Alexis, the daughter she had with Leon, to his grandmother's house on
West Wilshire Avenue for a visit, according to police. The two were
not married and did not live together. Leon stayed at the
grandmother's house occasionally.</TE>
<TE>   Leon and Ramirez argued, then Ramirez ran from the bedroom and
Leon fired a shot at her, according to police.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities arrived around 2:30 p.m. with an armored vehicle. They
evacuated dozens of nearby residents, and SWAT members took positions
behind fences and on roofs. Leon's worried relatives converged on the
neighborhood and slept on cots the Red Cross placed on the sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   During the ordeal, Leon walked outside the house several times,
his curly-haired daughter cradled in his arms. One time Leon held his
gun to her stomach. In another instance early Wednesday, as police
tried to break down the front door, he fired shots with one hand
while holding his daughter with the other.</TE>
<TE>   About 11:45 a.m., Leon walked to the porch carrying his daughter.
Police blasted him with a water hose, and he ran back inside.</TE>
<TE>   The standoff ended about 1 p.m. Wednesday when Leon, wearing a
baseball cap, walked backward out of the house, apparently talking to
himself.</TE>
<TE>   Leaving the baby inside, he walked onto the driveway. He turned
toward police and appeared to reach into his waistband or pull up his
shirt.</TE>
<TE>   De La Riva said officers ordered Leon to surrender. When he
refused, they shot him. He said they found the gun on his body, but
would not say whether he was holding it. As police rushed to the man,
Jessica Mendoza, the mother of his 8-year-old daughter, became
hysterical, screaming "Gabriel, Gabriel!"</TE>

weapon.</TE>

<HD>Father Shot as Standoff Ends</HD>
<DH>Crime: Santa Ana police recover the girl unharmed in
23-hour hostage drama. The gunman is reported in critical condition.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 23-hour standoff between police and a gunman holding his baby
daughter hostage inside a Santa Ana home ended Wednesday afternoon
when officers shot the suspect and recovered the girl unharmed.</LD>
<LD>   It was a sudden end to a hostage drama that begin as a domestic
dispute between the man and his ex-girlfriend and was punctuated
several times by the suspect's gunfire.</LD>
<LD>   Gabriel Anthony Leon, 25, was in critical condition at UCI Medical
Center in Orange with wounds to the lower back and groin, authorities
said.</LD>
<TE>   His daughter was reunited with her mother. During the standoff,
Leon told police that he had fed his daughter and changed her diaper.
He also threatened to hurt himself and the baby.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Police Sgt. Baltazar De La Riva said Leon was "one of
the most aggressive suspects we've encountered in some time," firing
three times at officers and once at the toddler's mother.</TE>
<TE>   The incident began Tuesday afternoon when Maribel Ramirez brought
Alexis, the daughter she had with Leon, to his grandmother's house on
West Wilshire Avenue for a visit, according to police.</TE>
<TE>   The two were not married and did not live together. Leon stayed at
the grandmother's house occasionally.</TE>
<TE>   Leon and Ramirez argued, then Ramirez ran from the bedroom and
Leon fired a shot at her, according to police.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities arrived around 2:30 p.m. with an armored vehicle. They
evacuated dozens of nearby residents, and SWAT members took positions
behind fences and on roofs. Leon's worried relatives converged on the
neighborhood and slept on cots the Red Cross placed on the sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   During the ordeal, Leon walked outside the house several times,
his curly-haired daughter cradled in his arms. One time Leon held his
gun to her stomach.</TE>
<TE>   In another instance early Wednesday, as police tried to break down
the front door, he fired shots with one hand while holding his
daughter with the other.</TE>
<TE>   About 11:45 a.m., Leon walked to the porch carrying his daughter.
Police blasted him with a water hose, and he ran back inside.</TE>
<TE>   The standoff ended about 1 p.m. Wednesday when Leon, wearing a
baseball cap, walked backward out of the house, apparently talking to
himself.</TE>
<TE>   Leaving the baby inside, he walked onto the driveway. He turned
toward police and appeared to reach into his waistband or pull up his
shirt.</TE>
<TE>   De La Riva said officers ordered Leon to surrender. When he
refused, they shot him. He said they found the gun on his body, but
would not say whether it was tucked into his pants or if he was
holding it.</TE>
<TE>   As police rushed to the man, Jessica Mendoza, the mother of his
8-year-old daughter, became hysterical, screaming "Gabriel, Gabriel!"</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana police said Leon is on parole for assault with a deadly
weapon.</TE>
<TE>   His former girlfriend and her mother said Leon had spent time in
the California Youth Authority as a juvenile.</TE>
<TE>   Mendoza's mother, Sherry Mendoza, 45, said she telephoned Leon
shortly after police arrived. "Gabriel said, 'Today's my last day. I
think I'm going to take myself out.' "</TE>
<TE>   Mendoza said that three to four months ago he showed up at her
house with a gun on his hip, saying someone was after him.</TE>
<TE>   At times, she said, he would stick the gun to his head and
threaten to shoot himself, saying "I don't want to be here no more."</TE>
<TE>   Mendoza said that when Leon finally gave her the gun 15 hours
later, he was crying hysterically.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why I do this," he told her. "I need help."</TE>

<HD>Suit in Slaying Leads to Apology</HD>
<DH>Settlement: The family of a man killed by El Monte police
during a drug probe will get $3 million. Deal includes department
reforms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSE CARDENAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The city of El Monte agreed Wednesday to pay $3 million to the family
of a 65-year-old man who was fatally shot in the back after officers
stormed his bedroom during a narcotics investigation.</LD>
<LD>   The city also agreed to comply with 15 conditions--including
apologizing to the man's wife and a series of reforms for its Police
Department.</LD>
<LD>   The wrongful-death settlement at Compton Superior Court appears to
climax a case that began three years ago when the El Monte Police
Department's SWAT team went to the Compton house of Mario Paz looking
for evidence in a wide-ranging narcotics investigation.</LD>
<TE>   The investigators came to the Paz house armed with a search
warrant because one of their suspects was known to have received mail
there. In the chaos of the drug operation that night, Paz was shot.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement was announced by attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. at
his offices in Los Angeles. He was joined by eight members of the Paz
family, including the dead man's widow, Maria Paz.</TE>
<TE>   "Paz means peace and my father was truly a man of peace," said
Maria Derain, one of his children. "The Paz family will begin the
healing process."</TE>
<TE>   Cochran said two of the conditions--the apology and changes to
make sure that police officers treat relatives of shooting victims
sensitively after such incidents--were keys to preventing the case
from going to trial.</TE>
<TE>   "We think this is a unique settlement," Cochran said. "This family
has been relentless ... in trying to change the way this department
does its work."</TE>
<TE>   He acknowledged El Monte officials for agreeing to the conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "This is unprecedented," he said. "We have to give credit to the
lawyers on the other side, the City Council of El Monte."</TE>
<TE>   El Monte settled primarily to avoid additional litigation costs
for a case whose outcome was too uncertain, said Eugene Ramirez, the
special attorney who represented the city.</TE>
<TE>   As for the concessions, some are established policies already or
practices that now will become part of the Police Department's
written record, according to city officials.</TE>
<TE>   The department's policies are "constantly being reviewed and
updated ... for the protection of our community members," said Clarke
Moseley, El Monte's city attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Regarding the apology, the city did not deny that the officers
were involved in "a series of actions" that resulted in the death of
a person.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't view it as whether we were liable for his death,"
Moseley said. "The city of El Monte regrets the loss of any life. We
did not have any difficulty in expressing our concern for the loss of
a family member."</TE>
<TE>   City officials also noted that long before the civil suit was
settled, the incident was investigated by the Los Angeles County
district attorney's office and the U.S. Justice Department--both of
which declined to file charges against the officers involved.</TE>
<TE>   By agreeing to the conditions in the civil suit, El Monte
officials said, the city is showing progressive thinking.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting on Aug. 9, 1999, occurred during an investigation
into suspected drug dealers Marcos Beltran Lizarraga and Paul
Lizarraga.</TE>
<TE>   A few days before the Paz shooting, officers had searched a home
in Chino connected to Marcos Lizarraga and found $75,000 in cash.
Then they searched his home in Valinda and found 400 pounds of
marijuana and three loaded assault rifles.</TE>
<TE>   The investigators, who believed that Lizarraga received mail at
the Paz home, acquired a warrant and went to the Compton house.</TE>
<TE>   The officers burst into the house about 11 p.m., finding several
members of the family at home, including the older Paz and his wife
in their bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, the officers' explanation for the shooting varied--that
they believed Paz was armed or that he was reaching for a weapon.</TE>
<TE>   The officers found $10,000 in cash and weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the settlement, El Monte police officials still believe
there was enough connection to the Paz home to suspect someone in the
house was involved in narcotics.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said that mail sent to the Paz home for Lizarraga was
found in Lizarraga's possession at the other houses searched. They
point out that three weapons found in the Paz house were stolen.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe the family was involved to some extent," Moseley said.</TE>
<TE>   The family has denied involvement throughout the case. No family
member was ever charged, and the money was returned to the family.</TE>
<TE>   According to the conditions, El Monte's mayor or chief of police
must apologize within 10 days of the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Other key conditions address some of the family's main concerns
about the events that night.</TE>
<TE>   They include the training of officers on how to give commands in
Spanish--members of the Paz family said they did not understand that
police had entered their home and feared they were being robbed.</TE>
<TE>   Another condition says police may not "unreasonably" delay getting
medical help for a person who has been shot.</TE>
<TE>   They call for better communications when El Monte police travel to
other cities to conduct operations and for the officers to make
reasonable efforts to find out who is in a house targeted for a
high-risk warrant.</TE>
<TE>   One of the key conditions, though, is that the city "implement a
policy ensuring the humane treatment of individuals and particularly
family members who have witnessed and suffered the [loss] of a loved
one as a result of a police officer's use of force."</TE>
<TE>   This condition was prompted, Cochran said, by the hours of
interrogation the family of Mario Paz was put through after some of
them witnessed the patriarch's death.</TE>

<HD>The Real-Life Land of Famous Movie Scenes</HD>
<DH>Beneath Mt. Whitney on the east slope of the Sierra Nevada,
hundreds of familiar shots have been filmed since 1920.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID FERRELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you look closely, as Dave Holland remembers doing, you can find
uncanny similarities in the scenes of many old Hollywood Westerns and
action films.</LD>
<LD>   Where Errol Flynn rode in "Charge of the Light Brigade" is also
the landscape where John Wayne starred in "Westward Ho." In "Riders
of the Purple Sage," Tom Mix stalks the same terrain that James
Stewart crosses a quarter-century later in "Broken Arrow." Scenes of
Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon in "The Great Escape" were shot among the
same rock formations and passes where Cary Grant labored in "Gunga
Din."</LD>
<LD>   Holland, 67, a retired press agent and assistant director, recalls
making the connection many years ago following a conversation with
film director John Ford. Their talk inspired Holland to start poring
over movie stills.</LD>
<TE>   "Looking at a Gene Autry photo from 'Boots and Saddles,' " Holland
later wrote, "I noticed that he and his sidekick ... were sitting
their horses by a tall, thick cucumber-shaped rock which was--it was
so obvious, it was startling--at the very same spot where the Indian
chase in 'How the West Was Won' began, and where Tim Holt had tried
ditching a posse in one of his RKO pictures called 'Guns of Hate'! "</TE>
<TE>   That spot was in the Alabama Hills just outside Lone Pine, west of
U.S. 395. The area, known as Movie Flats, is a rugged, eerie jumble
of granite outcroppings and sloping, brush-covered plains, almost
unparalleled for outdoor filmmaking. So far, by Holland's count,
scenes from 312 motion pictures have been shot here, directly beneath
Mt. Whitney on the east slope of the Sierra Nevada. Recent footage
includes scenes of Russell Crowe in "Gladiator," as well as alien
landscapes used in the multi-part "Star Wars" saga.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just cowboy movies," said Holland, who moved to the
hills himself in 1991 and published a 100-page pictorial guide, "On
Location in Lone Pine."</TE>
<TE>   "Alan Ladd was here in the French Foreign Legion [in 'Desert
Legion']. The cops chased Humphrey Bogart through the Alabama Hills
in 'High Sierra.' "</TE>
<TE>   Shooting began in these hills in 1920. A plaque dedicated by Roy
Rogers marks the entrance to gravel-covered Movie Road, which winds
past scores of shoot locations on land owned by the federal Bureau of
Land Management and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.</TE>
<TE>   During the Lone Pine Film Festival, scheduled this year for Oct.
11-13, volunteers set up photo markers throughout the hills, allowing
visitors to see scenes from movies alongside the natural terrain
where they were shot.</TE>
<TE>   You can stand at the spot where the camera filmed Cesar Romero,
for example, in 1939, during the making of "Cisco Kid and the Lady."
About 100 such markers bring the landscape to life for hundreds, if
not thousands, of movie fans who roll through the hills on tour
buses.</TE>
<TE>   Lone Pine's population of 2,000 more than doubles during the
festival, said Director Dorothy Bonnefin. The Lone Pine High School
auditorium screens only movies shot here. Fans dress up as Hopalong
Cassidy and Buffalo Bill.</TE>
<TE>   "Our Roy Rogers look-alike even brings his palomino horse,"
Bonnefin said.</TE>
<TE>   The festival was created in 1990 and has become one of
California's most popular. Many of Movie Flats' spectacular rock
formations are named after old-time stars--Gary Cooper Rock, Lone
Ranger Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   Another is being christened this year in honor of actor and World
War II hero Audie Murphy, who was here in 1960 to star in "Hell Bent
for Leather."</TE>
<TE>   The rocks are immense, haunting and otherworldly. They rise out of
the sloping desert like dark sculptures. Gargantuan mounds of
boulders resemble clumps of melted raisins. Tall ridges rise like
storm surf, jutting skyward in a froth of craggy rocks rounded by the
wind. Smoothly contoured formations give way to serrated spikes. In
the jumble and chaos, there are patterns to find.</TE>
<TE>   Lined hemispheres and globes seem to have been fitted together in
preformed halves and thirds. Squarish blocks, all tilted slightly to
one side, form the face of one immense hill. Rocks are gray,
rust-colored, streaked, blackened.</TE>
<TE>   "I swear they're all animal shapes," said visitor Anne McAndrews,
pointing out a tall series of boulders that resembled a triceratops,
and others that looked like reptile scales. "Look at that--that's a
skull. Isn't that cool? Imagine being out here at night, sleeping,
and the shape-shifting that goes on then."</TE>
<TE>   A two-sided map is available at the Chamber of Commerce. On one
side are the rocks' movie names. On the other are more fanciful
monikers: Elephant Rock, the Spooks, Peter's Pumpkin, Hannibal the
Cannibal, Hands from Hades.</TE>
<TE>   "It's incredible," Holland said of the area. He goes on at length
about the sunrise, the pink light on the Sierra Nevada, the shadows
creeping through the boulders.</TE>
<TE>   Brian and Grace Webb built a home on one of the few residential
streets in the hills. They are situated among 60-foot boulders, their
bedroom facing Mt. Whitney.</TE>
<TE>   "It's magical," Brian said.</TE>
<TE>   Sacha Stuart, a former Swiss actress, bought a place 10 years ago
surrounded by oversized gardens of rocks. Thunderstorms come in,
booming between the Sierra and Inyo mountains, seemingly trapped
between the ranges, illuminating granite arches and valleys. The
display provides her an answer when people ask why she spends her
time in the Alabama Hills.</TE>
<TE>   "I say, 'That's where God lives.' "</TE>

<HD>State Puts Century High on Notice</HD>
<DH>Education: Auditors will visit the Santa Ana school because
it hasn't met academic targets for four years. A takeover is possible
but unlikely.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Auditors from the California Department of Education will visit Santa
Ana's Century High School next week, a prelude to a possible state
takeover of the struggling campus for its failure to meet academic
targets for four consecutive years.</LD>
<LD>   A takeover of the school is unlikely, state education officials
said. Auditors will discuss steps to shore up student achievement
before taking such drastic action.</LD>
<LD>   "There are a range of sanctions that can be considered," said
Nicole Winger, a spokeswoman for the state education department.
"This is just to let the school know 'you've been flagged.' "</LD>
<TE>   Century is among 11 schools in nine districts statewide that will
be audited this year.</TE>
<TE>   The yearly reviews are conducted under Title I of federal law,
which provides about $9 billion a year in funding to disadvantaged
schools, but also demands steady improvement in academic scores.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, 13 schools, 10 of them in the Los Angeles Unified
School District, were targeted.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the Santa Ana high school could not be reached for
comment Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   A district representative said state officials would first meet
with district administrators next week and then with the school
staff.</TE>
<TE>   "The school has already turned some significant corners," said
district Supt. Al Mijares. "The efforts that are being pursued right
now are consistent with what is necessary for a school like Century."</TE>
<TE>   Mijares said the district has already replaced the school's
administration, including the principal, with interim leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Century High School has some of the poorest standardized test
scores in the state.</TE>
<TE>   Less than 12% of its students scored as proficient or higher in
the state's English language standards test this year, and less than
a quarter scored at or above the national average on reading tests.</TE>
<TE>   The school also faces challenging odds; more than half its 2,700
students are not fluent in English.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the district narrowly missed its Academic Performance
Index target set by the state. The index, which measures improvement,
is a formula that relies on test scores and other measures.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, Century's API score was 492, while the state set 800 as
the target. Every year schools are supposed to get closer to that
number.</TE>
<TE>   Century's score met its requirement for the school as a whole, but
the state also mandates that subgroups, such as minorities and
low-income students, meet individual targets. All subgroups in
Century did, except for one. Asian American students had to meet a
group score of 592. They scored 587.</TE>

<HD>County Launches Screen Tests for E-Voting Machines</HD>
<DH>Elections: Residents can try out three competing devices.
Board's pick goes online in 2004.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Almost 100 senior citizens turned out Wednesday to cast their ballots
for the county's next voting machine, helping push Orange County into
the electronic voting age.</LD>
<LD>   At the fourth meeting organized by county election officials,
residents at Leisure World in Laguna Woods tested the dials,
headphones and touch screens. For the next three weeks, residents can
test the machines at public meetings around the county before the
Board of Supervisors makes a decision in November.</LD>
<LD>   The Leisure World residents, many of whom were longtime voters,
told election officials what they thought of the machines, which
allow voting in five languages and can be used by disabled voters.</LD>
<TE>   Some were impressed with the technology. Others wondered what all
the fuss was about.</TE>
<TE>   "Voting is the only way we have of putting our two cents in the
system," said Jean Smith, 70, who volunteered to count ballots during
the 1960 presidential election, which John F. Kennedy won, and has
missed only one election in her life.</TE>
<TE>   But her husband, Vern Smith, 74, found the price of the electronic
units, which range from $2,250 to $3,500, too steep.</TE>
<TE>   "Except for the speed in counting, I don't see a thing wrong with
the old system," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Compared to the cost of wars, this is chicken feed," countered
Jim Murphy, an election precinct inspector for more than 10 years.
More important, he said, is that "Americans want their elections to
be truthful."</TE>
<TE>   After careful inspection and detailed questioning of the three
vendors, Murphy concluded that the electronic voting machines would
not be susceptible to ballot tampering.</TE>
<TE>   The three machines under consideration are each about the size of
a briefcase, with images depicting ballot pages.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of punching a hole next to the name of a candidate, voters
touch the candidate's name, either with their finger or a voting tool
before electronically flipping to the next page.</TE>
<TE>   Visually impaired voters can use the optional headsets.</TE>
<TE>   The technology will speed up ballot counting and reduce errors,
the companies' representatives say.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the three units fared well with residents. Most preferred
the touch-screen versions over the one with dials.</TE>
<TE>   The text was readable and the electronic ballot pages were
intuitive, they said.</TE>
<TE>   The county has set aside $22 million to buy the system, but Steven
Rodermund, chief deputy registrar of voters, said that figure could
rise.</TE>
<TE>   While Registrar of Voters Rosalyn Lever initially was leery of the
electronic-voting technology, she said she's now "quite excited"
about it and has confidence in the selection process.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Pinzler, a consultant hired by the county to manage the
three-week test, said the Asian-language versions have had glitches.
Some early literal translations of Asian languages were garbled, and
character languages such as Chinese may not be legible on the
computer screens, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Test sessions for Latino and Asian American residents are
scheduled in Santa Ana and Westminster next week.</TE>
<TE>   Lever also shares the concerns of some of the 7,500 election
workers about the machines' ease of use, such as their weight and
portability, especially because many poll workers are senior
citizens.</TE>
<TE>   By the March 2004 primary, the county plans to place 9,000
electronic voting machines in the 1,700 polling places for the
county's 1.3 million registered voters.</TE>
<TE>   While Orange County is not among the nine California counties that
were ordered by a federal judge to discard punch cards by the 2004
presidential election, its election officials said they are simply
being forward-thinking by switching to paperless elections.</TE>

<DH>Water: MWD staff cites environmental, drought and financial
concerns over the Mojave Desert storage project.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL A. HILTZIK and NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Metropolitan Water District staff recommended Wednesday that the
district's board indefinitely defer the controversial Cadiz water
storage program in the Mojave Desert because environmental concerns
and a drought on the Colorado River have dramatically reduced the
chances it will provide useful quantities of water to Southern
California.</LD>
<LD>   The recommendation, which was transmitted to the board over the
signature of MWD Chief Executive Ronald R. Gastelum, said the MWD
staff is also concerned about rising cost estimates of the project
and about the financial condition of its principal backer, Cadiz Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Gastelum's recommendation could mean the demise of the project
that has undergone five years of federal and state review but has
remained an environmental and political lightning rod.</LD>
<TE>   Among its opponents is U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who
has asked the MWD to reject it on grounds that it could do
irreparable damage to the Mojave Desert ecosystem. The 37-member
board will take up the issue at its next scheduled meeting Oct. 8.</TE>
<TE>   Even a temporary deferral of the project would represent a severe
financial blow to Cadiz Inc., which has never turned an annual profit
and has borrowed heavily against expectations that the project would
go forward.</TE>
<TE>   The Cadiz project envisions the storage of as much as 1.5 million
acre-feet of surplus Colorado River water in a Mojave Desert aquifer
for extraction in dry years.</TE>
<TE>   It was conceived by Cadiz, a Santa Monica company led by Keith
Brackpool, a major financial backer of Gov. Gray Davis and one of the
governor's closest advisors on water resource issues.</TE>
<TE>   Cadiz Inc. stands to earn $500 million to $1 billion over the
50-year life of the program, some of it by selling as much as 1.5
million acre-feet of ground water already present in the natural
aquifer under its land.</TE>
<TE>   Critics have contended, however, that extraction of ground water
on that scale would dramatically exceed the natural rate of
replenishment, damaging the fragile desert environment.</TE>
<TE>   Under tentative contract terms reached in April 2001, the
project's estimated cost of $150 million was to be shared equally by
Cadiz and the MWD, which would pay for its share by issuing bonds.</TE>
<TE>   But district sources said cost estimates have risen, requiring
further negotiations with the company.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the expense covers construction of a 35-mile pipeline
between the MWD's Colorado River aqueduct and the storage site
northeast of Palm Springs.</TE>
<TE>   Under the tentative partnership terms, the MWD was to deliver an
upfront payment of more than $54 million to Cadiz upon final approval
of the project.</TE>
<TE>   But the district has long been concerned that those funds could be
attached by Cadiz creditors, leaving the company without the
wherewithal to meet its partnership obligations.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Gastelum said in his memo to the board that among the
unresolved issues in the district's negotiations with the company is
"the difficulty of fully insulating Metropolitan from a Cadiz
default."</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Cadiz said late Wednesday that the company
believed that its program fit in with the state's long-term water
supply program.</TE>
<TE>   "Our program is one of the solutions to help reduce California's
reliance on the Colorado River," said Wendy Mitchell, director of
external affairs. "It provides both storage and supply."</TE>
<TE>   Still, MWD officials said the major impediment to the project's
implementation now is the dearth of surplus Colorado River water
needed to fill the storage basin. Because a two-year drought has
sharply reduced the river flow, MWD officials said their expectations
of available surplus over the next 15 years--even under average
rainfall conditions--have been cut to 4 million acre-feet from as
much as 9 million. One acre-foot would serve the water needs of two
average families for one year.</TE>
<TE>   That's not enough to justify the construction of major storage
project, MWD officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "Water doesn't appear to be readily available for storage," MWD
General Counsel Jeffrey Kightlinger said Wednesday at a joint hearing
of the state Assembly Water, Parks and Wildlife Committee and the
Senate Agriculture and Water Resources Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Because Colorado River supplies have become so uncertain, Gastelum
said, the money earmarked for Cadiz might be better spent securing
new water sources that aren't dependent on the river surplus.</TE>
<TE>   The Cadiz program reached an important regulatory milestone Aug.
29, when the U.S. Department of the Interior ruled that the desert
ecosystem could be protected from damage by the installation of
monitoring wells that would alert officials before the drawdown of
native ground water became excessive.</TE>
<TE>   On that understanding the agency approved leasing a 35-mile strip
of land to the MWD as the path for the water pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   Gastelum is recommending that the board accept the government's
lease terms but stop short of actually executing the lease or paying
the annual rent of $10,698.</TE>

<HD>Sheriff Is Reluctant Witness in Drug Case</HD>
<DH>Court: Defendant says Baca told him 'it was OK' to
distribute medical pot; Baca denies it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A man charged with growing and selling marijuana rested his case in a
preliminary hearing Wednesday after calling a single defense witness:
Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca.</LD>
<LD>   Steve Corchado said the 26 plants police found in his home in
October 2001 were for medical use by himself and members of his Santa
Monica cannabis club. He said Baca told him "that it was OK" to
distribute the drug if he followed California law that decriminalized
marijuana use for medical purposes.</LD>
<LD>   Baca, who had tried to avoid testifying, acknowledged that he
posed for a photograph with Corchado at a West Hollywood festival,
but denied Corchado's account of the conversation.</LD>
<TE>   "I do not conduct office business in a parade atmosphere at a
booth," Baca testified.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview later Wednesday, Baca said he supports cannabis
clubs if they are well-run, lawful and supervised.</TE>
<TE>   California voters approved an initiative legalizing marijuana use
for medical purposes by a margin of 56%.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a social, human issue of great importance to all Americans,"
Baca said.</TE>
<TE>   "I have great empathy for people who are HIV-positive and who are
on the slope of death. We have to defer to the medical community ...
and we as law enforcement need to remain on the table of reason and
see how the use of marijuana could save lives."</TE>
<TE>   Baca said Corchado tried to use the Sheriff's Department to
justify illegal behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "What I'm saying, without calling someone a liar, is that it
didn't happen," he said. "I would never condone any illegal act in
any circumstances."</TE>
<TE>   Several medical marijuana activists and users came to watch the
preliminary hearing Wednesday in the Santa Monica courthouse. One
wore a T-shirt that read "Access Now" and had a picture of a
marijuana plant over a red cross.</TE>
<TE>   Corchado, who was ordered to stand trial after the hearing, is not
charged with using marijuana for his own medical purposes, but for
cultivating and selling it. If convicted, he could be sentenced to
four years and eight months.</TE>
<TE>   "He was selling marijuana under the guise of it being a medical
situation," contended the prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Wendy Moss.</TE>
<TE>   Corchado, 53, said he suffers from asbestos in his lungs, which he
said causes nausea, diarrhea and shortness of breath. Moss said he
has failed to produce proof that he is ill or that a doctor has
prescribed marijuana for him.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 215 gives seriously ill patients or their caregivers
the right to obtain marijuana for pain relief with a doctor's
prescription. Two years later, Corchado opened the Comfort Care Group
and said he has since provided marijuana to hundreds of patients,
many with AIDS or cancer.</TE>
<TE>   But in 2001, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that federal law
prohibits giving marijuana to sick people, and federal authorities
shut down several cannabis clubs in California.</TE>
<TE>   Acting on a tip, an undercover Santa Monica police officer bought
marijuana from Corchado after getting a note from the doctor he
recommended, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Police arrested Corchado and searched his condo, finding 26
marijuana plants and drug-making materials, a credit card machine,
and a product list showing the names, prices and quantities for the
medical marijuana, court documents say.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney David Nick said Corchado "received the green
light from Sheriff Baca." Had Corchado been advised not to continue
running the club, he would have closed down the club himself, Nick
said. The preliminary hearing was held after Corchado, who is out on
bail, turned down an offer to plead guilty and agree not to sell
marijuana in exchange for no jail time. Two other defendants in the
case pleaded no contest and were placed on probation.</TE>

<HD>Off-Base Behavior in Korea</HD>
<DH>By allowing GIs to patronize certain clubs, the U.S.
military is seen as condoning the trafficking of foreign women for
prostitution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TONGDUCHON, South Korea</DL>
<LD>Directly across from the U.S. Army base known as Camp Casey is a
warren of tiny streets lined with shops and nightclubs. The shops
sell everything from sleeping bags to telephone calling cards to
sequined bikinis. The nightclubs sell titillation, at the very least.</LD>
<LD>   With names like America, Vegas, Seattle, New York and USA, the
clubs are geared to lonely and homesick GIs out for a night on the
town. Many have signs outside saying they're for foreigners
only--meaning no Koreans--and some won't admit anyone without a U.S.
military ID.</LD>
<LD>   This is the after-hours playground for troops stationed just 12
miles from the demilitarized zone that borders Communist North Korea.
The United States has 37,000 troops in South Korea, on a mission that
is most frequently described as defending democracy.</LD>
<TE>   But life is anything but democratic for the women--mostly from the
Philippines and the former Soviet Union--who work in the nightclubs.</TE>
<TE>   Cherilyn Dela Pena Mallari found out just how undemocratic the
clubs are after she was recruited from the Philippines to work in the
Double Deuce.</TE>
<TE>   In a diary being used in a civil lawsuit about to be filed by
Mallari and 10 other Filipinas against the Double Deuce management,
the 22-year-old wrote about how she and the others were locked in
their rooms above the nightclub, their passports and travel documents
taken away. They weren't permitted to make phone calls. They were
threatened with a knife. They didn't get a regular day off. They were
given less than $10 a week for food, leaving them with nothing to eat
but rice, noodles and an occasional can of Spam.</TE>
<TE>   Mallari knew that her job as hostess would require her to chat
with soldiers and wear shorter skirts than she might otherwise
choose, but she had been assured that she wouldn't have to go any
further.</TE>
<TE>   Then reality intruded.</TE>
<TE>   "My Gosh! It really appears that our job here will be prostitute.
That's why we are all very afraid," Mallari wrote April 3, the day
she arrived in Tongduchon.</TE>
<TE>   Then on April 8: "We received a scolding from our boss because he
said we were not entertaining customers. According to him, we should
let our customers touch us a bit."</TE>
<TE>   And on April 17: "I'll do anything to get out of this hell, just
so that they don't molest me.... This is the biggest mistake of my
life."</TE>
<TE>   Pressured by the Philippine Embassy in Seoul, South Korean police
busted the nightclub June 17. Eleven women were sent home to the
Philippines. The youngest was 16. The nightclub's South Korean
manager, Park Byoung Young, was convicted of assault and served two
months in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Although no charges have been filed against Americans, the case
and others like it raise tough questions for the military. The clubs
are owned by Koreans, and the recruiters are usually Koreans, or
sometimes Filipinos and Russians. The customers are primarily
Americans. By merely allowing soldiers to patronize such clubs, some
say, the U.S. military is condoning not only prostitution but,
perhaps more seriously, the trafficking of women and minors.</TE>
<TE>   "These clubs understand the law of the market. If the soldiers
didn't go to clubs with these kinds of practices, it would contribute
to the eradication of trafficking," said Reydelus Conferido, the
labor attache at the Philippine Embassy.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of news reports on the women's treatment, U.S.
commanders in South Korea say they are beginning to educate
themselves and their soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   "From a personal standpoint, I find this morally repugnant. From a
policy perspective, we have taken a clear stand that these are not
circumstances that are condoned, supported, encouraged or would allow
our soldiers to participate in," said Maj. Gen. James Soligan, the
deputy chief of staff for U.S. forces in South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   From a practical standpoint, however, Soligan says he is unsure
what to do beyond keeping soldiers confined to base or barring them
from clubs with Russian or Philippine hostesses.</TE>
<TE>   As an interim measure, Soligan has ordered all commanders to talk
to their soldiers about trafficking. The military also is considering
placing some clubs off-limits if they are found to be violating human
rights.</TE>
<TE>   The issue has piqued the interest of Congress. Rep. Christopher H.
Smith, a New Jersey Republican, says conditions in the nightclubs
make a mockery of any claim of defending democracy.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to practice what we preach," said Smith, who was a
driving force behind the Victims of Trafficking and Violence
Protection Act of 2000, designed to put the United States solidly
against the growing international trade in women. "We have to make
sure that Americans are not complicit in the trafficking of women and
hopefully stand on the other side of the equation."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, U.S. Army Secretary Thomas E. White asked the
service's inspector general to open an investigation into the
trafficking of women near all Army bases, including those in South
Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Until very recently, there was little awareness in the U.S.
military about trafficking.</TE>
<TE>   "In fairness to the military, every soldier knows what
prostitution is, but trafficking is something they did not
understand," said Katharine Moon, a political scientist at Wellesley
College who has written extensively on the subject.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the term "trafficking" is a source of some confusion. The
most commonly accepted definition comes from a U.N. protocol adopted
last year that describes it as the "recruitment, transportation,
transfer, harboring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or
use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of
deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability
... for the purpose of exploitation."</TE>
<TE>   Even if they don't know the legal definition of trafficking, many
GIs have noticed that something is amiss in the nightclubs.</TE>
<TE>   "You know something is wrong when the girls are asking you to buy
them bread," said Chris Hollis, 27, of Ohio, who is stationed at Camp
Casey. "They can't leave the clubs. They barely feed them."</TE>
<TE>   Several soldiers remarked that the new arrivals look healthy. But
after a few months, their skin takes on a strange pallor and
flabbiness as a result of rarely being allowed outdoors.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole thing is wrong," said John Osmun, 28, from Indiana,
also based at Camp Casey. "There are only Americans in these clubs.
If they're bringing these women over here to work for us, they should
get paid a fair wage. They should have the right to a day off like in
America."</TE>
<TE>   About 6,500 foreign women work in nightclubs in South Korea.
Around dusk, when the neon lights are switched on to illuminate the
clubs, the women appear in short, tight skirts in the doorways,
beckoning men to come in. Exactly what happens inside varies from
club to club and town to town, and depends on how closely South
Korean or U.S. military police are patrolling at a given moment.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the USA club--which promotes its Americana theme with a
logo of the Statue of Liberty--the lights are dim and the music loud.
A couple of soldiers in civilian attire hunch over beers at the bar,
chatting casually with a Russian woman. But there appears to be more
intimacy at a private banquet tucked in a dark corner.</TE>
<TE>   The scene is raunchier in the town of Songtan, where the U.S. Air
Force's Osan Air Base is located. At the Playboy Club outside the
base, a Philippine dancer in a black bikini writhes around a
floor-to-ceiling pole on the stage. Video monitors replicate her
image around the room. Under a bank of monitors, a Filipina wearing
just a thong and bra straddles the lap of a soldier who is fondling
her buttocks, while his buddies drink beer and laugh.</TE>
<TE>   Although prostitution is against South Korean law and patronizing
prostitutes is prohibited by U.S. military regulation, the brothels
near the bases have long been an open secret.</TE>
<TE>   Patronizing a prostitute can lead to discharge from the military.
But unless a service member is caught in the act--and caught paying
for it--it is impossible to bring charges against him. Moreover,
prostitution near the military bases is disguised by an elaborate
system of euphemism.</TE>
<TE>   The women working in the clubs often hold the title of "guest
relations officers" but are more popularly called "juicy girls." If a
GI wants to chat with a woman, he is expected to buy her a
drink--usually a tiny glass of juice--that can cost between $8 and
$20. Depending on the bar, the glass of juice might mean some idle
chitchat or perhaps serious groping.</TE>
<TE>   If the customer wants more privacy with the woman, he can buy a
table in what is called a VIP room--a quiet, dark booth in the back
or a small room upstairs. If he wants to spend more time alone with
the woman, he usually has to pay the nightclub what is called a "bar
fine," which allows him to take her out overnight.</TE>
<TE>   While the system disguises the obvious, it also puts the women in
a situation where it is difficult to say no. Their salaries are
low--usually less than $300 per month--and when they arrive here,
they usually have to pay off a debt of more than $1,000 for air fare,
visa and employment agency fees. Without earning commissions on the
juices or on going out for "bar fines," they have no way to break
even.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't allow yourself 'to be used,' you will not have
money," Cherilyn Mallari wrote in her diary.</TE>
<TE>   People familiar with the industry say psychological pressure plays
an even bigger role than locked doors in keeping women at the clubs.
Conferido, the attache at the Philippine Embassy, says many people,
including police, "do not believe that women can be pushed into
prostitution without physical force. I try to explain to them that if
you take somebody far from home, under certain condition, you can get
them to do whatever you want.... It could happen to anybody."</TE>
<TE>   "There are some nasty clubs where women are locked in, but mostly
women don't leave because they are scared," said Veronica, a
24-year-old from the outskirts of the Russian city of Vladivostok who
once worked in Tongduchon.</TE>
<TE>   A nightclub owner in Songtan, who asked not to identified, said:
"Some of the women are locked up. If a fire breaks out, they can't
escape. But the main method of coercing them is psychological. They
know no one. They have no money. The only way they can get money is
by prostituting themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Paula, 32, who like most women asked that her family name not be
published, was recruited with a group of her friends in 1999 in the
Philippine city of Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "There was this lady we knew. She said, 'Hey, you want to go to
Korea and work as a waitress?' I had been before working in Malaysia.
That's a Muslim country, and you didn't have to do that sort of
thing," Paula said. "I'd heard stories about Korea, but this lady
said, 'No. It's just waitressing.' We were all from poor families, so
we said yes."</TE>
<TE>   Denise, 22, who worked at the same club, concurred. "I read the
contract. And it was supposed to be only waitressing. No dancing."</TE>
<TE>   The women were flown to Bangkok, Thailand, where they received
South Korean visas. Once they arrived, they learned that they would
have to wait a year before being paid and then get only $2,000. The
bar penalized them if they didn't meet a quota for selling drinks,
and, as Paula said, "to get a guy to buy you a lousy juice, you were
supposed to open his zipper." They were also to wear sexy outfits and
dance.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so shocked. I had tears coming down my eyes when I danced,"
Denise said. "I was a virgin. I was totally innocent."</TE>
<TE>   Paula eventually escaped from the club with the help of an
American boyfriend, a soldier, who gave the club $3,000 to pay off
her debt.</TE>
<TE>   Denise was less fortunate. She quickly became pregnant, she said,
by an American soldier whom she was seeing regularly. She went back
to the Philippines to have the baby but then needed money to support
him. So she returned to Songtan to work again in the nightclubs. But
she found that she couldn't stomach the work, so she ran away. She
now works illegally in a factory preparing kimchi, the ubiquitous
Korean delicacy, making $500 a month. She sends the money back to the
Philippines to support her child, who lives with her parents.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard work, but it's honest work, and they pay overtime,"
Denise said of the kimchi factory.</TE>
<TE>   Regulations in South Korean make it extremely difficult for
foreign women to work in factories but quite easy to work in
nightclubs. They are allowed in the country under what is known as an
"entertainment visa," another euphemism.</TE>
<TE>   Until the mid-1990s, most women in the sex industry here were
Korean. But the breakup of the Soviet Union and the collapse of the
Philippine economy made foreign women readily available. At the same
time, the booming South Korean economy was making jobs near the bases
less desirable than they'd been in the hardscrabble days after the
Korean War.</TE>
<TE>   "The Korean girls didn't want to work here anymore. The GIs aren't
rich. The girls could get better tips working in clubs for Korean
customers," said Kim Kyoung Su, a Tongduchon club owner and president
of the Korean Special Tourism Assn., a trade organization for clubs
near the U.S. bases.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, the group began lobbying the government for the right to
bring in foreign women to work in the nightclubs. Kim says it was
essential to prevent GIs from harassing Korean women and straining
the important military alliance between the U.S. and South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "If it hadn't been for us, there would be sexual violations, maybe
rapes. We are contributing to United States and Korean relations in
our own way, and nobody appreciates that," Kim said.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody in the South Korean government will publicly confirm Kim's
account. But one bureaucrat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
he believes that many Koreans thought it better that foreign women,
rather than Koreans, entertain U.S. service members.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s and '80s, the Korean Special Tourism Assn. enjoyed
favorable treatment by the South Korean government, according to
political scientist Moon. Her 1997 book, "Sex Among Allies," alleged
that the South Korean government tacitly supported prostitution near
the U.S. bases as a way of solidifying the military alliance and of
bringing in scarce hard currency. The tourism association also enjoys
the privilege of selling tax-free liquor to Americans and other
foreigners in its bars.</TE>
<TE>   Under regulations for entertainer visas, applicants must submit
resumes and evidence of their experience in the performing arts to a
quasi-governmental agency, the Korea Media Rating Board.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, the board approved applications for 6,980 entertainers,
98% of them women. The largest numbers came from the Philippines,
Russia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Moldova.</TE>
<TE>   "These entertainment visas are a cover for prostitution," charged
Kim Kang Ja, a South Korean police superintendent who heads the women
and juveniles division.</TE>
<TE>   Lee Jong Hwa, the head of the Korea Media Rating Board, doesn't
dispute her accusation. He concedes that the board is not able to
carefully check the applications, which are submitted by
recruiters--or sometimes directly by the tourism association.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a certainty that there are some false documents submitted.
The obvious ones are rejected. But because of manpower and resources,
we cannot investigate them all," Lee said.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever support the nightclubs enjoyed in the past from the South
Korean government, there is now a move underway to crack down on the
most egregious cases of trafficking. Bad publicity about the bars has
prompted some legislators to call for a tightening of the rules for
granting entertainer visas.</TE>
<TE>   And although the South Koreans don't think they can eradicate
prostitution, they are now paying much closer attention to the
question of human rights for women in the sex industry.</TE>
<TE>   Superintendent Kim has made several recent forays into
Tongduchon--not to investigate whether prostitution was taking place
but to inspect the living conditions in the clubs.</TE>
<TE>   On one excursion last month, she traipsed through bedrooms and
opened refrigerator doors as a nightclub manager, a middle-aged
woman, screamed in indignation.</TE>
<TE>   "When I visited this place the last time, there were bars on the
windows and nothing but old porridge in the refrigerator," Kim said,
noting with satisfaction that the clubs are cleaning up their act
under increased scrutiny. "Now there is food and soda in the
refrigerator. The bars are off the windows. It's much cleaner."</TE>
<TE>   The police are distributing stickers in the nightclubs informing
women of their legal rights and giving out the number of a police
hotline.</TE>
<TE>   The Philippine Embassy is skeptical about whether the measures
will be effective. Many women are reluctant to call the police for
fear that they, not the owners, will be the ones arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the case of the Double Deuce nightclub, police initially
planned to charge Mallari and the other women with prostitution.
After being dissuaded by the Philippine Embassy, the women were
simply deported.</TE>
<TE>   The club has since reopened under the same management but a
different name. The women are now Russian, not Philippine.</TE>

<HD>Israelis Prepare for Life in the Bull's-Eye Again</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Many fear attack by Iraq if war erupts. But unlike
in '91, nation might hit back.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MITCHELL LANDSBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>In the corner of a parking garage in Israel's largest shopping mall,
a peculiar ritual is taking place. All day, streams of people arrive
carrying what appear to be shoe boxes with black plastic shoulder
straps. Soldiers sitting behind folding tables open each box, remove
and inspect the gas mask inside and replace any outdated parts.</LD>
<LD>   In most countries, this would be considered an odd, even paranoid
practice. In Israel, it is accepted as a part of life--especially
lately, as talk of a U.S. military attack on Iraq has swelled the
lines at the gas mask stations and reminded Israelis that, as during
the 1991 Persian Gulf War, they are likely to be the bull's-eye for
any Iraqi retaliation.</LD>
<LD>   One important difference: There are indications that this time
Israel might strike back.</LD>
<TE>   Iraq launched 39 Scud missiles at Israel in the Gulf War, most of
which either were shot down or exploded in unpopulated areas.
Israelis feared attacks with chemical or biological weapons, but the
Scuds were equipped with conventional warheads.</TE>
<TE>   Still, two people were killed and more than 200 injured in the
attacks, and nearly everyone living in Israel at the time has
indelible memories of air raid sirens, gas masks and rooms sealed
with tape and plastic sheeting.</TE>
<TE>   Most Israelis seem certain they are about to experience deja vu.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of bottled water, canned tuna, televisions and VCRs have
soared. The factory that produces gas masks for the government is
working triple shifts to keep up with demand.</TE>
<TE>   Shavrav, a company that makes a $1,000 home-filtration system that
it claims will protect people from chemical and biological agents as
well as radiation, can't keep up with demand.</TE>
<TE>   "The main question is: When can you install it?" said company
President Mordechai Larry. "They don't even ask the price. They want
it yesterday."</TE>
<TE>   For all the concern, Israeli officials and defense analysts insist
that the country is in far less danger from an Iraqi attack than it
was nearly 12 years ago. Iraq is a weaker opponent than it was during
the Gulf War, they say.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they've been able to save more than a few launchers
and at the most a few tens of Al-Hussein missiles that can reach us,"
said Shai Feldman, director of the Jaffee Center for Strategic
Studies in Tel Aviv. The Al-Hussein is an Iraqi variation of the
Soviet Scud B missile.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Iraq has chemical or biological weapons, as the United
States and Britain claim, it is another matter to effectively deliver
them in a missile warhead, Feldman and others say.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Israel says it is far better equipped to defend
itself than it was during the Gulf War, when the United States
hurriedly delivered mobile Patriot missile launchers to shoot down
Scuds. Critics have said that the Patriots were ineffective and that
casualties were relatively low only because the Scuds were such crude
missiles.</TE>
<TE>   A Touted Defense Shield</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the Patriots have been improved, Israeli officials
say. But, more important, Israel and the U.S. have jointly developed
the Arrow antiballistic missile system, which officials here are
touting as a nearly foolproof shield.</TE>
<TE>   "We will destroy all the missiles that are fired on us within five
minutes, without the citizens of Israel even feeling it," Deputy
Defense Minister Weizman Shiri boasted to the Knesset, Israel's
parliament.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone is quite so confident about the Arrow.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no evidence that it will work against a real ballistic
missile," said Reuven Pedatzur, director of the Galili Center for
Strategy and National Security at Tel Aviv University and one of
Israel's leading experts on antimissile defense.</TE>
<TE>   True, Pedatzur said, the Arrow has performed brilliantly in tests.
But, he said, "all the tests are very sterile tests.... During the
war, it will be different."</TE>
<TE>   So is he worried? Not particularly. Pedatzur is among those who
believe that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein will think twice about
attacking Israel this time, particularly with unconventional
weapons--"because he knows exactly what Israel has," Pedatzur said,
"and he is going to be deterred."</TE>
<TE>   At the urging of the United States, Israel refrained from
retaliating during the Gulf War. The thinking was that an Israeli
entry into the war would alienate the United States' Arab allies and
fracture the broad coalition arrayed against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   This week, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's office denied a New York
Times report that the Israeli leader had told the Bush administration
that his nation would strike back this time if hit by Iraqi missiles.</TE>
<TE>   Edward S. Walker Jr., president of the Middle East Institute in
Washington and a former ambassador to Israel, told the Los Angeles
Times this month that he believes Sharon's government would hold back
if Iraq fired conventional missiles and would strike back with
conventional weapons if hit by a chemical attack. If Israelis were
hit with biological weapons, he added, "I have no doubt that they
will give it everything they've got."</TE>
<TE>   Some officials here say Israel would show restraint to avoid
interfering with the U.S. military's strategic aims in a war with
Iraq. But others say Israel would strike, particularly if hit with
unconventional weapons. After all, they say, there is not yet an
extensive American-led coalition and most Arab countries oppose the
idea of a U.S. invasion.</TE>
<TE>   That gives Israel a freer hand, said Moshe Arens, who was Israeli
defense minister during the 1991 conflict. "This time," he told the
Israeli newspaper Yediot Aharonot, "Israel will have no problem
reacting."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli defense officials also said the country is much better
prepared to deal with the consequences of an attack, although this
contention has been sharply questioned in the media and among
government critics.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Gulf War, every new house and apartment unit has been
required to include a bomb shelter--essentially, a room with
reinforced walls and airtight seals on the doors and windows.
However, as many as 2 million Israelis, or about one-third the
population, are estimated to live in homes without shelters. Although
there are public shelters, defense officials have conceded that they
fall short of needs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's true that there's a gap to close, but we've made amazing
progress," Defense Ministry Director-General Amos Yaron told Israeli
radio.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Israelis will be told to do what they did in
1991: Seal a room using tape, plastic or, if necessary, rags.</TE>
<TE>   Shots Against Diseases</TE>
<TE>   In preparation for a biological attack, authorities have reported,
health officials have vaccinated 5,000 doctors and nurses against
smallpox, and they plan to give shots to more than 15,000 people to
resist bubonic plague. There are talks about vaccinating the entire
population against plague.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the gas masks. Israeli newspapers have been filled
with reports about controversies over the equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Since the 1991 conflict, Israel has poured millions of dollars
into research into and production of a higher-tech gas mask that was
expected to be a vast improvement over the Gulf War-era model. So
far, the new mask has been a failure. Now the government is sticking
with the tried and true, which makes the wearer look a bit like an
anteater but has the advantage of apparently working.</TE>
<TE>   A potential shortage is looming, however, with 600,000 masks set
to reach their expiration date in January, when they will need to be
replaced in whole or part. The government has insisted that it will
meet the demand in time.</TE>
<TE>   For now, there is no shortage, and thousands of people a day
emerge from government centers with new or updated masks.</TE>
<TE>   Evgeny Karan got his mask updated with a new filter recently at
the resupply center in the garage of Jerusalem's Malkha Kanyon Mall.
Karan, an associate professor of biomechanics, moved to Israel from
Russia in the fall of 1990 and was told to get a gas mask right away.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was nonsense," he said.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the following February, he had already used the mask
during Iraqi Scud missile attacks and was ready to rethink his
position.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I know it's not nonsense," he said. "I live in Israel, and
even if there's no imminent danger, you always have to be prepared."</TE>

<HD>Victims of Attack in Pakistan All Christian</HD>
<DH>Violence: Slaying of seven staff members at the
headquarters of a peace group 'appears to be an act of terrorism,'
police chief says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Two gunmen who killed seven Christian workers here Wednesday morning
tied up most of their victims and shot them in the head one by one,
execution style.</LD>
<LD>   The morning attack on the Institute for Peace and Justice, a Roman
Catholic group trying to promote harmony between all religions, left
another staff member critically wounded, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The dead included the agency's communications outreach
coordinator, a computer operator, an accountant, an office assistant
and two drivers, all Pakistanis between the ages of 25 and 56. The
seventh victim, who was not further identified, died later at a
hospital.</LD>
<TE>   The attackers escaped, leaving uninjured one worker--a man who
served tea and did other menial jobs in the office. He was found with
his mouth taped shut and in shock, and was hospitalized with heart
problems.</TE>
<TE>   Karachi, a bustling port city and Pakistan's commercial center, is
also a key battleground in the war against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   With the help of FBI agents, Pakistani security forces have had
several successes here in recent weeks. Those included the arrest of
Ramzi Binalshibh, alleged by U.S. authorities to be a planner of the
Sept. 11 attacks. He is in U.S. custody at an undisclosed location.</TE>
<TE>   There is no evidence that Wednesday's shootings were carried out
in revenge for Binalshibh's arrest or any other counter-terrorism
operations, said Inspector General Syed Kamal Shah, who heads the
Sindh province police.</TE>
<TE>   Although the assault "appears to be an act of terrorism," Shah
said, he cautioned that investigators are still trying to determine
the motive and whether an organization is behind the slayings.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not linking this incident with recent ones," Shah told
reporters outside the Christian group's third-floor office. "What I'm
saying is we will investigate with an open mind. We will look at all
angles."</TE>
<TE>   The agency's office manager opened the electronically locked door
about 8:30 a.m. Wednesday, and other staff members started arriving
about 10, Shah said.</TE>
<TE>   One of them apparently buzzed in the killers, who herded five of
the victims into the office library. Hands bound, mouths taped shut
and sitting in office chairs around a conference table, the staff
members were shot one after another, Shah said.</TE>
<TE>   Their bodies were found on the library floor. A sixth victim, who
was not tied up, was slain sitting in a chair near the office
bathroom.</TE>
<TE>   Workers in neighboring offices, who peered nervously into the dark
hallway full of police, said they didn't hear shots.</TE>
<TE>   The slayings was discovered about 10:15 a.m. when two Muslim staff
members of the Catholic-run agency rang the doorbell and the unharmed
witness let them in.</TE>
<TE>   "We are examining why the one was spared when he is also a
Christian," Shah said.</TE>
<TE>   The office publishes a monthly magazine called Jafakash, or The
Worker, and police suggested that the organization may have been
singled out because the publication has opposed Pakistan's harsh
blasphemy laws.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights activists have long accused Pakistani President
Pervez Musharraf of undermining his own campaign against Islamic
extremists by refusing to reform the laws, which have been used to
have Christians, members of Muslim sects and other religious
minorities sentenced to death for allegedly offending Islam.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan's government doesn't carry out the death penalties
imposed in blasphemy cases, but the convicted prisoners often
languish on death row for years while awaiting appeals. Several
Pakistanis accused of blasphemy have been slain in prison or by mobs
before they could stand trial.</TE>
<TE>   Yousuf Mustikhan, general secretary of the National Workers Party,
said he had worked closely with the Institute for Peace and Justice
in a campaign against the sectarian violence that has ravaged
Pakistan for years.</TE>
<TE>   "Peace and justice have been murdered by terrorists in Pakistan,"
Mustikhan, a Muslim, said after six bodies shrouded in bloodstained
white cloth were carried on stretchers down a dingy stairwell to
waiting ambulances.</TE>
<TE>   "The victims were very great people," he added. "They were
struggling for the downtrodden people of Pakistan. Mostly Christians
were working here, but they were not working as Christians. Muslims
worked with them."</TE>
<TE>   Staff members never mentioned any specific threats but knew they
could be a tempting target for terrorists, said Usman Baloch, a
Muslim member of the agency's board. But they didn't have security
guards because they thought that would contradict their message, he
added.</TE>
<TE>   "If they were getting threats and they did not talk to anybody to
keep this [religious] harmony intact, it was a great sacrifice,"
Mustikhan said.</TE>
<TE>   The killings were the latest in a series of assaults on Christians
in Pakistan that has seen at least three dozen people slain in the
last year. But the attacks Wednesday were different because the
killers used a single, small- caliber pistol and did not fire
indiscriminately, said Shah, the police inspector general.</TE>
<TE>   "In previous incidents, hand grenades and Kalashnikovs were used,"
Shah said. "But this incident is very well planned. They have tried
to pass unnoticed."</TE>
<TE>   Other Christian targets in Pakistan have included a church, a
hospital and a school for children of foreign missionaries, all
easily spotted and attacked from the street. But the office hit
Wednesday is not well marked and shares a floor in a rundown building
with a chest doctor, a lawyer and computer businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "To find it must have been very difficult because it was not an
obvious place," Shah said.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Karachi police reportedly found hand-drawn maps of two
churches and a Christian school when they arrested two suspected
members of the Harkat-ul-Moujahedeen al-Almi.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani authorities say Al-Almi is a breakaway faction of
Harkat-ul-Moujahedeen, a banned militant group fighting Indian rule
in the disputed territory of Kashmir. The parent organization's
leader, Fazlur Rehman Khalil, was a signatory to Osama bin Laden's
1998 religious order calling for all Muslims to kill Americans.</TE>

<HD>Bush Plans to Send Envoy to N. Korea</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Since a July trip was canceled, the Communist
nation has made new contacts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration eased its almost nonexistent relationship
with North Korea forward Wednesday, announcing that it would send an
envoy to meet with the Communist nation's reclusive leadership, for
the first such contact between the U.S. and the North in nearly two
years.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush disclosed the decision in a telephone call
Wednesday morning to President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea, White
House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said.</LD>
<LD>   The dispatch of an envoy, expected to be Assistant Secretary of
State James A. Kelly, suggests that the administration has concluded
that North Korea is meeting the toughened standards the U.S. has set
for new contacts.</LD>
<TE>   Fleischer put at the center of any developing U.S.-North Korean
talks an easing of the military tensions that remain 50 years after
the end of the Korean War.</TE>
<TE>   He said Bush and Kim "agreed that real progress with the North
depends on full resolution of the security issues on the Korean
peninsula, including the North's possession and pursuit of weapons of
mass destruction and ballistic missiles."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly had been scheduled to visit North Korea in July, but the
trip was canceled after North and South Korean naval vessels
skirmished in the Yellow Sea in June. Talks between the United States
and North Korea have been suspended since the Bush administration
took office last year.</TE>
<TE>   Since the original mission was put off, North Korea has reached
out on economic and diplomatic fronts to Japan, the U.S., Russia and
China. Several experts on the politics of the Korean peninsula said
the measures Pyongyang has taken were sufficient to draw the
increased contact and to overcome objections from hard-liners in the
Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, North Korean leader Kim Jong Il has confessed
that his country kidnapped at least a dozen Japanese to assist its
spies--an act the North had denied for decades. He made the admission
during a visit to North Korea by Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro
Koizumi that many believe will lead to normalization of relations
with Japan.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea agreed to permit mine-clearing work along the border
with South Korea so that the two nations can connect their rail
lines.</TE>
<TE>   Pyongyang also announced the creation of a special economic zone
in the city of Sinuiju, on the border with China, and appointed a
Chinese businessman to run it. The action has been seen as moving
North Korea in the direction of the Chinese economic reforms favored
by Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Britain announced Wednesday that it is upgrading its relationship
with North Korea by naming its first ambassador to the Communist
country.</TE>
<TE>   "It is an encouraging development that the United States will
dispatch a high-ranking envoy in the near future," Kim Ki Man, a
spokesman for the South Korean president, said today.</TE>
<TE>   Still, any move toward rapprochement with North Korea could prove
awkward for the Bush White House.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing has changed in the president's thinking about North
Korean President Kim Jong Il and the North Korean leader's starvation
of his own people, the militarization efforts that he's leading, the
... proliferation of weapons of mass destruction," Fleischer said.
Bush has labeled North Korea part of an "axis of evil," along with
Iraq and Iran.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bush administration thinks it has a problem because people
will say, 'How come you're bashing one arm of the axis of evil and
dealing more amicably with another?' " said Donald Gregg, U.S.
ambassador to South Korea during the previous Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   But, said Gregg, "to not send an envoy at this point would be
unnecessarily stiff-necked. What North Korea is doing is
demonstrating very clearly they want to change the way they relate to
the outside world."</TE>

<HD>Two Former L.A.-Area Priests Are Arrested</HD>
<DH>Church: They allegedly molested children years ago. A
warrant is issued for a third cleric.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON and MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Authorities arrested two former Catholic priests Wednesday on charges
that they sexually molested children during their tenure in Los
Angeles-area churches and issued an arrest warrant for a third priest
after unexpectedly discovering the 82-year-old retiree had left the
country on a cruise.</LD>
<LD>   The arrests, the first in Los Angeles County since the Roman
Catholic scandal that broke nine months ago, signal the start of more
than a dozen planned prosecutions of former Los Angeles Archdiocese
priests considered by investigators to be the worst offenders.</LD>
<LD>   "It doesn't matter who is accused of molesting children, we are
going to do our best to bring them to justice," said Sheriff's Sgt.
Dan Scott.</LD>
<TE>   The three priests targeted Wednesday are accused of molesting more
than 20 girls and boys--as young as 8 years old--between the late
1940s and the mid-1980s, police officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Taken into custody by the Los Angeles Police Department early
Wednesday was Carlos Rene Rodriguez, 46, on a single count of
molesting a 12-year-old altar boy between 1985 and 1987. Bail was set
at $400,000.</TE>
<TE>   The law enforcement operation then took a chaotic turn when
authorities could not find two of the men, who had both been under
investigation for months.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Stephen Baker, 54, was arrested eight hours after
sheriff's investigators began looking for him. Baker, who admitted to
Cardinal Roger M. Mahony in 1986 that he had molested boys, was
booked on suspicion of child sexual abuse and held on $1-million
bail.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD also was seeking to determine the whereabouts at sea of
G. Neville Rucker, a retired priest who, authorities say, is accused
of molestation by 16 girls.</TE>
<TE>   The action came a day after a former Orange County priest was
arrested on suspicion of sexually abusing a teenage girl in the
1970s. Sheriff's deputies engaged in a sting operation taped him
making an alleged confession to an undercover officer. He believed
the officer was his grown daughter by a then-teenage parishioner.</TE>
<TE>   The push for criminal prosecution marks a turning point in the
nationwide molestation scandal in the Catholic Church that has seen
top church officials--including Mahony--conceding that they knew
about abuse of children by troubled priests for decades but did not
inform local law enforcement authorities.</TE>
<TE>   In some instances, including the cases of Rucker and Baker, church
officials instead chose to transfer the alleged offenders from parish
to parish.</TE>
<TE>   The move by Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley to prosecute the priests--and
his expressed intent to pursue many more cases--was praised by
alleged victims and their attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   "This is another step toward accountability and prevention," said
Jeffrey Anderson, a St. Paul., Minn., attorney who represents alleged
victims of Baker. "Now we want justice."</TE>
<TE>   Church officials in Los Angeles, who have had a testy relationship
with Cooley over his pursuit of personnel files of alleged abusers
and their past handling of molesters in their ranks, expressed sorrow
over the charges and said they hoped for a quick resolution.</TE>
<TE>   "My heart aches with the pain and suffering endured by victims of
sexual abuse by clergy," Mahony said in a prepared statement. "The
archdiocese will continue to reach out to all victims and their
families with pastoral care and counseling."</TE>
<TE>   Ongoing Investigation</TE>
<TE>   Cooley issued a brief statement Wednesday saying the investigation
is ongoing.</TE>
<TE>   "It is expected that the suspects arrested today will be charged
and arraigned in court within the next 48 hours," he said, adding his
office had been working closely with the LAPD and the L.A. County
Sheriff's Department on the case. Prosecutors would not detail the
evidence they plan to present. Crimes dating back as far as the
allegations in the priests' cases require clear and convincing
contemporary corroboration, officials said, and can be difficult to
prove.</TE>
<TE>   But there was clearly confusion Wednesday on the part of
authorities over the whereabouts of two of the suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators had mistakenly believed Rucker, one of seven priests
removed from the ministry earlier this year by Mahony under a
retroactive "zero-tolerance" policy for molesters, would be available
to turn himself in by noon Wednesday at LAPD headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, officials learned Wednesday morning from Rucker's lawyer,
Donald Steier, that his client had "left the country" on a cruise a
week ago.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD officials, who said Rucker has been accused of molesting 16
girls while serving in parishes in Los Angeles, East Los Angeles and
El Segundo between 1947 and 1979, downplayed the significance of his
absence.</TE>
<TE>   "When the D.A. called to arrange that this morning, Rucker was on
vacation out of the country. He is not considered a fugitive," said
LAPD Cmdr. Gary Brennan.</TE>
<TE>   Brennan said the retired priest had not been under day-to-day
surveillance.</TE>
<TE>   "There was nothing to suggest he needed to be watched," Brennan
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We aren't going to send out the Coast Guard."</TE>
<TE>   Steier said he told Rucker, who has worked as a cruise ship
chaplain, that it was OK to travel because prosecutors gave no
indication until Wednesday that they wanted to make an arrest.
"Frankly, this could have been avoided if someone made a phone call
to me earlier than today," the attorney said.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office also expressed frustration.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement "investigators are charged with knowing the
whereabouts of suspects the district attorney's office is about to
charge," said Joe Scott, a spokesman for Cooley.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD officers apprehended Rodriguez shortly after 6 a.m. at his
home in Commerce. Rodriguez was booked on suspicion of lewd acts with
an altar boy over a two-year period in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   The alleged victim, now an adult, reported the alleged molestation
in April to the LAPD's sexually exploited child unit, Brennan said.
Rodriguez allegedly molested the boy at St. Vincent de Paul Church on
West Adams Boulevard. He left the priesthood in 1993, and was living
privately when he was taken into custody, Brennan said.</TE>
<TE>   During the investigation into Rodriguez, detectives discovered
that the LAPD had received a prior allegation of sexual abuse against
a minor by the former priest.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona Incident</TE>
<TE>   In 1987, the parents of another boy alleged that their son had
been sexually abused by Rodriguez during a trip he took with the
priest to Arizona, Brennan said. LAPD investigators at the time
referred the matter to authorities in Arizona because the incident
occurred in that jurisdiction.</TE>
<TE>   Early Wednesday morning, sheriff's deputies tried to serve an
arrest warrant for Baker at his downtown Long Beach high-rise
apartment but failed to find the former priest.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators then ordered Baker, through Steier, to turn himself
in by 1 p.m., a deadline that came and passed.</TE>
<TE>   He was tracked down by deputies at a La Mirada residence in the
early afternoon, according to law enforcement officials.</TE>
<TE>   The home is a short distance from St. Paul of the Holy Cross, a
church where he once served and at least one man has alleged he was
molested as a boy by Baker.</TE>
<TE>   He was taken to the Norwalk sheriff's station.</TE>
<TE>   Scott said the allegations against Baker involve multiple victims
and incidents that allegedly took place between 1977 and 1985.</TE>
<TE>   Baker resigned from the priesthood in 2000. After his 1986
admissions to Mahony, he was sent for treatment and transferred to
several parishes before resigning. In 2000, the archdiocese and Baker
settled a lawsuit with two Mexican brothers for $1.3 million after
they alleged the priest had molested them over a period of 15 years
until 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Steier said his client was on his way to surrender when he was
arrested. He said Baker's arrest would have been far simpler if
prosecutors had arranged for him to turn himself in rather than come
to his apartment to make a surprise arrest.</TE>
<TE>   As to the allegations, Steier said, "We'll see if their case meets
the requirements of the law."</TE>
<TE>   Steier acknowledges that Baker has admitted to Mahony that he
molested boys but said the acts involved may not be of a serious
enough nature to warrant prosecution. "The statute may have expired,"
Steier said, of potential lesser crimes. Under state law, there is a
10-year statute on sex crimes, except in the most serious violations,
such as rape and sodomy, involving children 15 and under.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said Wednesday that he hoped for a "quick resolution" of
the charges against Rodriguez, Rucker and Baker "so that all parties
can move forward toward healing and reconciliation." In his
statement, he made reference to Pope John Paul II's statement that
there is no place in the priesthood or religious life for those who
would harm the young.</TE>
<TE>   News of the arrests brought a mixture of reactions at Catholic
parishes in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   At St. Vincent, where Rodriguez once served, Blancarosa Gonzalez,
48, said that despite the arrests and the wider church scandal, her
lifelong faith in the church remains unmoved.</TE>
<TE>   She was visiting the sanctuary, bathed in light from stained-glass
windows and votive candles to seek comfort for the murder of her son
six months ago in Mexico. "Only here," she said gesturing to the
building behind her, "is there comfort for me."</TE>
<TE>   Faith Is Shaken</TE>
<TE>   But other worshipers had strong words for church officials they
say have shaken their faith--not in God--but in church leaders.</TE>
<TE>   David Figueroa, 22, and Christopher Rivera, 21, who were at the
church to dip their hands in holy water, said they have stopped going
inside to pray since the sex scandal has escalated.</TE>
<TE>   Struggling to stay out of gangs and prison, they said they are
disgusted that members of the priesthood have been accused of
committing crimes against children.</TE>
<TE>   In prison, Rivera said, he learned that the bad things in life
will always be easier to pursue than a moral path. But if priests
cannot resist temptation, what guidance are people left with, they
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's messed up--you can't trust anybody," Figueroa said. "We're
trying to do positive things for ourselves, and this really shakes my
faith."</TE>

<HD>An Inferno in the Mountains</HD>
<DH>Blaze: As it threatens homes in Mt. Baldy Village,
officials say fire may burn for a month.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An out-of-control blaze that began as a remote brush fire in the
Angeles National Forest continued Wednesday to travel the northern
rim of the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, threatening thousands of
homes as it advanced on Mount Baldy Village and sending smoke as far
as Las Vegas.</LD>
<LD>   The fire swelled to an estimated 30,000 acres by 6 p.m. Wednesday,
stretching along 11 miles of the San Gabriel Mountains. Nearly 3,000
firefighters from dozens of agencies battled the blaze, which
officials said was 10% contained and could burn in the Angeles
National Forest for as long as a month.</LD>
<LD>   Fire officials said 71 structures, mostly cabins in San Dimas
Canyon, have been destroyed. Authorities have closed the national
forest until the end of the fire season.</LD>
<TE>   A steady storm of ash fell over the foothills, and the heat from
the towering flames could be felt two miles away.</TE>
<TE>   The plume of smoke reached 26,000 feet and continued to blanket a
mammoth swath of Southern California. The South Coast Air Quality
Management District issued an advisory Wednesday for foothill
communities from Pasadena to San Bernardino County, urging people to
"avoid unnecessary outdoor activities."</TE>
<TE>   By Wednesday night, walls of flames were advancing on three fronts
through the rugged canyons north of Glendora, La Verne, Azusa, San
Dimas and Claremont.</TE>
<TE>   By 11 p.m., firefighters were bracing for flames that had advanced
within half a mile of evacuated homes in northern Claremont's Palmer
Canyon. Fire also had come within two miles of Mt. Baldy Village and
was moving that way.</TE>
<TE>   Flames churned through brush that front-line firefighters compared
to 7-foot-tall shag carpet--brush that has not burned in 35
years--and leapt northeast across Glendora Ridge Road and East Fork
Road. Another wall of fire moved slowly toward the southeast. A third
edge of the fire rocketed through a basin known as Cow Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   "We are positioning ourselves to defend the community," San
Bernardino County Fire Division Chief Mike Conrad told his troops
during an afternoon briefing in Mt. Baldy Village. "It's up to nature
now."</TE>
<TE>   Though the most dangerous flames appeared to be moving deeper into
the mountains to the north and northeast, officials remained
concerned about metropolitan areas to the south, including the
northeast portions of Azusa, La Verne, San Dimas and Glendora.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 10,000 homes remained in some danger, fire officials
said. More than 2,000 people were forced to evacuate Tuesday and
Wednesday, mostly around Mt. Baldy, as well as from Palmer Canyon and
Padua Hills, north of Claremont.</TE>
<TE>   Forest Service spokesman Bruce Quintellier said firefighters
believe they know where the blaze started, but that point is now
buried in rubble, and the cause remains under investigation.
Authorities said they have ruled out campfires and barbecues as the
possible cause.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the cost of fighting the fire has exceeded $4 million,
fire officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Many foothill residents stayed home from work Wednesday, trying to
decide what to take with them and what to leave behind. They were
packing up family keepsakes, photographs, laptop computers and
financial records.</TE>
<TE>   "These quilts, I can't lose them," Glendora resident Sandra Hoodye
said. "It's the little things that seem so important now."</TE>
<TE>   At the end of one cul-de-sac in Glendora, Suzanne Safavi, 44,
stood holding a hose outside her home. "It's like a priest coming in
and giving last rites to someone on their death bed," she said. "My
whole purpose in life is this house."</TE>
<TE>   Heightening the tension, firefighters trying to keep the flames
away from more populated foothill neighborhoods were forced to
abandon the fire line Wednesday because of terrain that was
impossible to negotiate on foot. Officials were largely relying on
helicopters and bulldozers in steeper areas.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of what the fire is doing we just have to let it do," Conrad
said. "We can't put people on the fire line in some areas. It's too
treacherous."</TE>
<TE>   Farther up in the mountains, flames reached the peak of Sunset
Ridge late Tuesday, triggering the evacuation of Mount Baldy Village,
said Jim Wilkins, a San Bernardino County Fire Department captain. An
estimated 900 residents of the mountain community, located 4,000 feet
above the Los Angeles Basin, were told to leave.</TE>
<TE>   If the fire breached Mt. Baldy Road, fire officials said, it could
funnel through the canyon and block the only paved exit for lingering
residents and firefighters.</TE>
<TE>   "There's one way in and one way out," said John Klopp, a Mt. Baldy
resident and, like many of his neighbors, a member of the local
volunteer fire department.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters had established a safe zone in a rocky area close to
the peak of Mt. Baldy. They were preparing contingency plans to yield
the village if they were overrun by flames.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the threat, as many as 150 residents of Mt. Baldy stayed.</TE>
<TE>   John Norris, 74, a retired engineer, has lived on Mt. Baldy since
1965--long enough to have fought five fires and four floods.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday afternoon, he was on top of his roof, sweeping off
dry leaves.</TE>
<TE>   "The people that went down are the kids who haven't lived here
very long. All the old-timers will stay," he said from his roof. "The
people who have lived here don't abandon their homes. The ones who
run come back to burned out houses. The ones who stay and fight have
something to show for it.</TE>
<TE>   "Every fire so far I've followed the last firetruck down the hill.
And I'll do it again this time."</TE>
<TE>   Norris, who said he has a heart condition, became short of breath
and had to sit down. But he said he was determined to finish his
task.</TE>
<TE>   "You see me up here with a bad heart valve sweeping off these
leaves," he said. "But I don't want the bonfire of the vanities on my
roof."</TE>
<TE>   Stan Tibbetts was out of town on business in 1988 when a small
brush fire destroyed his Mt. Baldy home.</TE>
<TE>   This time, he said, he isn't going anywhere and would stave off
flames with a hose if he had to.</TE>
<TE>   "I packed up the wife and the kids and the dog, but I'm here," he
said. "I have to be here. I agree totally with them getting everybody
out of here. People would just be in the way, and that's why my
family is not here. And I'm not so dumb to stand there and burn up.
But if there is anything I can do, I will."</TE>
<TE>   Even with a stiff chin turned toward the flames, "I don't think
there's anyone who is not afraid," said Missy Ellingson, who, with
her husband, owns the Mt. Baldy Lodge, a restaurant and a collection
of cabins.</TE>
<TE>   "It could conceivably trap us in here," she said. "We'd leave if
in danger. We are not going to go down with the ship."</TE>
<TE>   Barbiann Schmeiser, who lives in a Mt. Baldy cabin, spent Tuesday
night at a Red Cross center established at the Magnolia Recreation
Center in Upland. Schmeiser had time to grab six of her eight cats
before fleeing. She dropped them off at the vet, but when she
returned to retrieve the last two, she was told she could not go back
up the mountain.</TE>
<TE>   "It was kind of a scary feeling," she said. "There was no sky at
all except for smoke."</TE>
<TE>   In Cow Canyon, just west of Mt. Baldy, dozens of firefighters were
forced to merely sit and watch late Wednesday afternoon as flames
burrowed up a hillside.</TE>
<TE>   "It's basically a death trap," Wilkins said.</TE>
<TE>   On the northern end of the fire, however, firefighters won one
skirmish with the blaze.</TE>
<TE>   It happened shortly after noon, when the fire took off across East
Fork Road and tore around the Julius Klein Conservation Camp, which
houses about 125 inmates, many of whom were out fighting the fire.</TE>
<TE>   As flames approaching 100-foot heights crested a ridge, about 22
firefighters from the California Department of Forestry took
positions around the perimeter. They set several backfires, and
watched as the advancing blaze whipped around them, sparing the camp.</TE>
<TE>   "It went exactly as we thought it would go," said Battalion Chief
Jack Consol, who led the Forestry Department strike team.</TE>
<TE>   As the fire raced past, it tore through mountainsides like the
flame from a cigarette lighter through paper, officials said, at
times consuming 100-acre swaths in minutes. But as it advanced toward
Camp Follows and Camp Williams, both also were saved by backfires.</TE>
<TE>   The fire appeared to be headed north toward the boundaries of the
so-called Curve Fire, which burned an estimated 18,000 acres near
Rattlesnake Peak two weeks ago. Firefighters are hoping the remains
of that fire will help extinguish this one.</TE>
<TE>   The fire has forced the closure of the Angeles National Forest,
one of California's most popular recreational areas, for the first
time in more than 25 years.</TE>

<HD>Medical Pot Farm Puts Neighbors in Middle of Drug War</HD>
<DH>Marijuana: Residents feel relief, guilt after feds raid
operation in Sonoma County.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEBASTOPOL, Calif.</DL>
<LD>First came the snarling guard dogs, then the barbed-wire fence and
24-hour security patrols, all of it smack in the middle of a leafy
neighborhood on the outskirts of this wine country town.</LD>
<LD>   Residents along Martin Lane reached a collective conclusion this
summer: Robert Schmidt's medicinal pot farm was a problem. An armed
camp, they called it. A magnet for thieves. A danger to neighborhood
kids.</LD>
<LD>   Their worries seemed to abate when carbine-toting federal drug
agents rumbled in Sept. 12, arrested Schmidt and uprooted 3,454
marijuana plants reputedly intended as medicine. But concern lingers
on this dead-end gravel lane in the heart of get-along Sonoma County.</LD>
<TE>   Schmidt's neighbors remain perplexed that their pleas for help
went unheeded for so long. But they're also troubled that Schmidt,
52, could face a long prison sentence--10 years to life--for what
they consider a desire to help the sick. The punishment, they say,
doesn't fit what should have been simply a residential zoning
violation.</TE>
<TE>   "Here in California," concluded Jayne Garrison, a neighbor, "we're
living in a legal twilight zone when it comes to medical marijuana."</TE>
<TE>   The latest clash on Martin Lane is only one of many messy
conflicts to erupt since 1996 when California voters approved
Proposition 215, the landmark initiative that made medical use of
marijuana legal under state law but set up a testy conflict with the
federal government's unwavering prohibitions on pot.</TE>
<TE>   The fight has centered on the more than 50 nonprofit cannabis
dispensaries that have sprung up in California since the initiative
passed. Though it allows patients or caregivers with a physician's
recommendation to grow pot for their own use, dispensaries were
fashioned as sources for shut-ins or those too ill to cultivate the
plant they had permission to use. Growers like Schmidt supplied such
dispensaries.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last year, the rift between the state and the U.S. has
only widened. In May 2001, the U.S. Supreme Court declared that
federal law doesn't allow a medical exception for marijuana use.
Although eight other states allow medical use of pot, California has
remained the top target. Federal drug officials say growers in the
Golden State are simply more visible--thus easier to arrest--and apt
to bring raids to the attention of the news media.</TE>
<TE>   As more growers have been busted, advocates for the medical use of
pot have increasingly voiced outrage, in particular over a Sept. 5
raid that shut down a collective in Santa Cruz; activists countered
by defiantly distributing marijuana in front of City Hall last week.</TE>
<TE>   The conflict flared again Monday, as police arrested about 30
demonstrators blocking a federal courthouse in Sacramento to protest
the conviction of the leader of a Chico dispensary of marijuana for
medical use. Federal drug agents also are targeting small operations
once considered not worth the bother. On Tuesday, drug enforcement
agents uprooted a San Diego activist's 26-plant pot garden.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very controversial issue, this so-called medical
marijuana," said Richard Meyer, a Drug Enforcement Administration
spokesman in San Francisco. "But we get lots of calls from
communities thanking us."</TE>
<TE>   Residents on Sebastopol's Martin Lane didn't know what to make of
Schmidt when he swept into the neighborhood last spring, renting a
farmhouse atop six acres at the end of the road. Schmidt, now being
held in a Bay Area jail, could not be reached for comment, and his
attorney, Alexandra McClure, declined to discuss the case.</TE>
<TE>   With his beard and gray ponytail, Schmidt seemed a cross between
Willie Nelson and Col. Sanders, neighbors said. He rode horses,
fancied western garb and sometimes clomped around in a black duster.
Schmidt was friendly, they say, with a dash of bravado. Among
advocates for medicinal use of marijuana, Schmidt styled himself the
"cannabis cowboy." He told folks on the lane his crop would consist
of sunflowers and corn. But he also referred them to a Web site for
"Genesis 1:29," the marijuana operation Schmidt established shortly
after California became the first of nine states in the U.S. to
legalize medical use of marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   For its first years, Genesis sat shoehorned in a Petaluma
subdivision, 20 miles down the freeway. But in 1999, armed robbers
burst in and stole 50 plants at gunpoint.</TE>
<TE>   His neighbors griped, and Schmidt moved Genesis 1:29 (named for a
Bible verse about God inviting man to use all of Earth's seed-bearing
plants as food) to a business park. Eventually he found the farm on
Martin Lane.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of the 11 ranchettes fronting the lane weren't exactly
shocked to learn from his Web site that Schmidt considered himself a
purveyor of medical marijuana. Like many folks in Sonoma County,
where more than 70% of the electorate backed Proposition 215, no one
on Martin Lane is philosophically opposed to medical use of
marijuana. They figured Schmidt would plant a few seeds and be done
with it. Summer came, and there was no sign of sunflowers or corn.
Instead, cannabis grew.</TE>
<TE>   As the crop came in, the protection arrived--barbed-wire fences,
patrols and guard dogs. Infrared scopes and videotape equipment were
deployed, neighbors say.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole thing had an air of absurdity to it," said next-door
neighbor Mary Roth. "Until we got scared."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the guards had crossbows. A few neighbors had scary
confrontations with the dogs. A silhouette paper cutout of a human
figure was pinned on hay bales. Schmidt's crew left it up for target
practice. "It was plainly meant to intimidate," said Roth's husband,
Ted.</TE>
<TE>   Janine Carpenter, who lives directly across the narrow street,
said she hadn't slept well most of the summer: Any bump in the night
had her up, fearing a threat. She kept her children, ages 5 and 8,
from playing out front. The Roths insisted their visiting
grandchildren stay inside.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors started calling the sheriff's narcotics division, but
were told nothing could be done. "They said they knew about Robert,
but their hands were tied," said Fran Begun, 77.</TE>
<TE>   The Sonoma County sheriff's narcotics task force did not return
calls for comment. But other county officials say their reluctance to
intercede springs in large part from a 2001 court case on the medical
use of marijuana. Two proponents accused of growing 899 pot plants
for a San Francisco dispensary were acquitted after contending they
were caregivers for patients.</TE>
<TE>   Schmidt, likewise, told neighbors that his marijuana was justified
under Proposition 215. Though county regulations set a limit of 99
plants per patient, Schmidt told neighbors he had more than 1,000
letters from sick people needing his pot as medicine.</TE>
<TE>   Such arguments are considered pointless by federal drug agents.
Under U.S. law, the possession, use or cultivation of marijuana for
any purpose is a felony. Unfettered by state law, the DEA had been
conducting surveillance on Schmidt for more than a year, neighbors
later learned At dawn on a cloudless late-summer day, agents stormed
in with guns and chainsaws. Schmidt was handcuffed in a lawn chair,
left to bellow: "This is all legal, you know!" By the end of the day,
the pot crop he had nurtured for months had been hauled away.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors were elated to see it disappear. But Schmidt's crew was
irate. None had been arrested, so they lingered for days afterward,
trying to clean up the mess.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something that doesn't make sense," said farmhand Jeremy
Mayfield. "The DEA is supposed to be fighting the war on drugs.
Instead they're putting 1,200 patients on the street to look for
drugs on the black market."</TE>
<TE>   A lanky man with flames tattooed on his arms, Mayfield understands
the concerns of neighbors. But workers at the Genesis pot farm simply
wanted to keep the "medicine" safe for needy patients, he said. They
didn't mean to scare anyone except potential thieves.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the house, a message from Schmidt is still scrawled on a
board: "Safety first; friendly fire is not friendly; good
neighborhood relations." If intruders approach, guards were told,
call 911 and alert the sheriff.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, a graveyard of plant roots litters the property. Drug
agents punched holes in water tanks, Mayfield said, and cut
electrical lines. Mayfield said Schmidt fashioned Genesis 1:29 as his
redemption, his payback to society. In the early 1980s, federal
officials say, Schmidt was busted for pot smuggling and spent several
years in prison. The goal of Genesis, Mayfield said, was to free
people who couldn't cultivate--the old, the infirm, those stuck in
cramped apartments--of the black market's dangers.</TE>
<TE>   Though drug agents put the value of the Genesis crop at more than
$1 million, Schmidt told medical marijuana activists he planned to
sell it for far less. Top grade pot goes for about $4,800 a pound on
the street, but Schmidt's marijuana was expected to sell for $2,000 a
pound, said Lynette Shaw, founder of the Marin Alliance for Medical
Marijuana. "This," she said, "was a devastating loss for patients in
the North Bay Area."</TE>
<TE>   But the neighbors on Martin Lane say all the risk was being dumped
on them.</TE>
<TE>   What's needed now, the neighbors reason, is for government to sort
out the conflict between state and federal law. That won't come
quickly, they realize, so they have united behind a push for change
in local law. Last week, they dispatched a letter to Sonoma County
supervisors asking that zoning rules be altered to put residential
areas off limits to medicinal marijuana farms.</TE>
<TE>   "We want it regulated, zoned," Begun said. Mike Mullins, Sonoma
County district attorney, said the folks on Martin Lane "had every
right to be afraid." But zoning restrictions would merely shift the
problem to rural areas, he added. The solution must be faced head on:
Either legalize medical use of marijuana across America or end what
in California has become "an absurd situation."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Mike Reilly, a Proposition 215 supporter, admits he's
unsure how land-use rules apply to a crop that is "quasi-legal to
begin with." Reilly hopes the medical marijuana community will learn
to avoid farming in residential areas.</TE>
<TE>   On Martin Lane, the old peace has returned. Schmidt is in federal
custody. His pot farm is dismantled. But some neighbors remain ill at
ease--about being cast as villains by medical marijuana boosters,
about retribution. And about the fate of Robert Schmidt.</TE>

<HD>Daschle Accuses Bush of Playing Politics on Iraq</HD>
<DH>Debate: Senate majority leader, in rare outburst, demands
an apology over what he sees as an attack on Democrats' concern for
U.S. security.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK and JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In a blow to White House efforts to unite Congress behind a potential
war with Iraq, the Senate's top Democrat on Wednesday accused
President Bush of politicizing the debate and demanded he apologize
for questioning the commitment of Democrats to the nation's defense.</LD>
<LD>   "That is outrageous," Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) said in
an angry speech on the Senate floor. He lambasted Bush for saying
recently that Democratic-controlled Senate was "not interested in the
security of the American people."</LD>
<LD>   The bitter outburst--which touched off a vitriolic exchange
between party leaders--is likely to slow efforts to win congressional
approval of a resolution giving Bush broad authority to use force
against Iraq.</LD>
<TE>   That, in turn, could complicate Bush's effort to build support in
the international community for a tough new stance toward Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional leaders had earlier said they hoped to reach
agreement with the White House on the wording of the Iraq resolution
by the end of this week and bring the measure to a vote next week.</TE>
<TE>   Now, there are doubts about whether such quick agreement is
possible.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a ways to go," said House Minority Leader Richard A.
Gephardt (D-Mo.). "I don't know if we'll pull that off or not."</TE>
<TE>   Daschle's speech brought to the surface the deep anxieties many
Democrats have expressed privately that Bush has been pushing for a
preelection debate on Iraq to bolster GOP candidates and to eclipse a
Democratic agenda that focuses on domestic issues.</TE>
<TE>   But White House officials and other Republicans said Daschle had
taken Bush's comments out of context, and urged Democrats to cool
their rhetoric.</TE>
<TE>   "Now is a time for everybody concerned to take a deep breath and
stop finger-pointing," said White House spokesman Ari Fleischer.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the tensions over the Iraq issue contributed to an already
poisonous political atmosphere that has made it difficult for
Congress to resolve differences on an array of issues, including
legislation to create a Department of Homeland Security.</TE>
<TE>   Members of both parties who support Bush's Iraq policy said they
hoped Wednesday's collapse of bipartisanship will be only temporary.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, we will see this as a blowing of the whistle, which
leads to a lowering of voices on all sides," said Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman (D-Conn.), who supports the option of preemptive action
against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic concerns about Bush's motives in the Iraq debate have
become more acute in recent days as Republicans began airing campaign
ads in such conservative states as South Dakota and Arkansas
suggesting that Democratic Senate candidates were weak on defense.</TE>
<TE>   In several states, GOP ads have also spotlighted contributions
Democratic candidates have received from the Council for a Livable
World, a group that advocates arms control and a smaller Pentagon
budget.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, meanwhile, is in the midst of an aggressive schedule of
political appearances and has been speaking with increasing
forcefulness about Iraq while campaigning for GOP candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Targeting Democrats</TE>
<TE>   In a clear reference to Daschle and other Senate Democrats, Bush
said in Trenton, N.J., on Monday, "The Senate is more interested in
special interests in Washington and not interested in the security of
the American people."</TE>
<TE>   Until Wednesday, Daschle had studiously avoided accusing Bush of
using the prospect of war for political purposes. But he dropped that
reserve Wednesday after reading a story in the Washington Post that
noted Bush's New Jersey remark. The story also said that at a
fund-raiser in Kansas on Monday, Vice President Dick Cheney had
suggested that a vote for a Republican House candidate would help the
war effort.</TE>
<TE>   Those reports were particularly galling to Daschle because
he--like Gephardt--has taken considerable heat from rank-and-file
Democrats who believe their leaders have done too little to slow
Bush's rush to confront Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   A source close to Daschle said that on Wednesday, the majority
leader felt that "his efforts to work with the president are not
being reciprocated in a meaningful way."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the usually mild-mannered Daschle rose angrily on the
Senate floor to defend his party's record on national security. He
invoked the many Democratic lawmakers who are military veterans, such
as Sen. Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii, who lost an arm in World War II
combat.</TE>
<TE>   "The president ought to apologize to Sen. Inouye and every veteran
who has fought in every war who is a Democrat in the Senate," said
Daschle. "Our founding fathers would be embarrassed by what they are
seeing going on right now."</TE>
<TE>   Inouye also spoke, saying to Bush: "It is American to question the
president.... I stand before you a proud member of the Democratically
controlled Senate.''</TE>
<TE>   Daschle's remarks infuriated Republicans, who joined the White
House in saying he quoted Bush out of context. They noted that he
made his comment about Democrats as he was discussing legislation to
create a Department of Homeland Security, not a possible war with
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The homeland security bill has bogged down in the Senate over
Bush's insistence on a provision--opposed by Democrats and their
labor union allies--to give him more flexibility in managing
employees of the new department.</TE>
<TE>   In that context, Fleischer defended Bush's comment.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no doubt about it: If (the homeland security bill) does
not pass into law because special-interest provisions will have
prevailed, the Senate will not have acted in the best interest of the
American people," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional Republicans joined in the defense, saying Cheney's
remarks in Kansas had been misinterpreted by Democrats because of a
headline in the Topeka newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, in a speech Wednesday night, broached the impasse over the
proposed Department of Homeland Security and again raised the
national security issue that so angered Daschle.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to a fund-raising dinner in Washington for the National
Republican Senatorial Committee, Bush complained that "some senators,
not all senators, but some senators" are thwarting his plan over the
labor rights dispute.</TE>
<TE>   He added: "The Senate must hear this, because the American people
understand it: They should not respond to special interests in
Washington, D.C. They ought to respond to this interest--protecting
the American people from future attack."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, Bush offered a low-key response when asked
whether he was "politicizing the war."</TE>
<TE>   "My job is to protect the American people," he told reporters.
"And I will continue to do that, regardless of the season."</TE>
<TE>   Bush also equated Hussein and the Al Qaeda terrorist network,
saying, "They're both equally as bad, and equally as evil, and
equally as destructive.</TE>
<TE>   "They work in concert. The danger is, is that Al Qaeda becomes an
extension of Saddam's madness and his hatred and his capacity to
extend weapons of mass destruction around the world," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   Aiming at Critics</TE>
<TE>   His remarks seemed directed at answering criticism, included in a
speech Monday by Al Gore, the 2000 Democratic presidential nominee,
that the focus on Iraq has undermined the fight against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans in the Senate were more vitriolic in their response to
Daschle's speech.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought he was way over the top," said Senate Minority Leader
Trent Lott (R-Miss.). "It's almost as if they think President George
W. Bush is the problem, instead of Saddam Hussein."</TE>
<TE>   Daschle's remarks on the Iraq issue were welcomed by fellow
Democrats, who flocked to the Senate floor during his speech and
offered support in speeches of their own.</TE>
<TE>   His comments were especially gratifying to those who thought their
party leaders had been too willing to embrace Bush's policy.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very alone in urging caution," said Sen. Dianne Feinstein
(D-Calif.). "There's been a rush on both sides to go [into Iraq] and
wage war."</TE>
<TE>   Some said they hoped that Daschle's comments would open more
political space for Democrats to raise more questions about the
wisdom of military action.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, this will lead to a period when we talk about the
merits of Iraq policy," said Sen. Russell D. Feingold (D-Wis.), a
leading critic of Bush's policy. "As time has gone on, significant
questioning about the wisdom of military involvement is occurring."</TE>
<TE>   But an aide to another anti-war Democrat in the Senate predicted
that the political controversy would not change the outcome of the
debate on the war resolution, but only reduce the margin by which it
passes.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of there being 85 votes for the resolution, there may be
just 70," said the aide.</TE>

<HD>Prominent Physicist Fired for Faking Data</HD>
<DH>Research: Bell Labs says scientist 'recklessly'
misrepresented work on microprocessors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An influential physicist whose work in superconductivity and
molecular-scale electronics seemed poised to revolutionize his field
has been fired by Bell Labs for falsifying experiments over a
four-year period.</LD>
<LD>   A panel of scientists appointed by Bell Labs found that Jan
Hendrik Schon misrepresented data 16 times, publishing identical
charts to support his thesis in several scientific papers even though
the experiments were different. Schon was fired Tuesday, according to
a spokesperson from Bell Labs' parent company, Lucent Technologies
Inc.</LD>
<LD>   "It is not possible that this set of curves represent real data,
and therefore, this is a clear, unambiguous case of scientific
misconduct," the panel concluded. It added that Schon "did this
intentionally or recklessly and without the knowledge of any of his
coauthors."</LD>
<TE>   In a statement included with the panel's report, Schon stopped
short of acknowledging fraud.</TE>
<TE>   "I made various mistakes in my scientific work, which I deeply
regret," he said. "I truly believe that the reported scientific
effects are real, exciting, and worth working for."</TE>
<TE>   Experts say the episode probably spells the end of his
once-soaring scientific career. Schon could not be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   The case represents what some experts say is one of the most
egregious examples of scientific misconduct in recent memory, and it
is the first case of fabrication at Bell Labs, whose researchers have
won six Nobel prizes in physics since the facility's founding 77
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The affair follows a similar case of fakery at Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory. Last month, an internal investigation at the lab
criticized a team of its own scientists for failing to verify claims
by a former colleague who three years earlier said he discovered
element 118--an addition to the periodic table of elements and a
scientific milestone.</TE>
<TE>   Those claims later proved to be fabrications, according to the
lab, which issued a retraction in July. The scientist implicated,
Victor Ninov, was fired earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   Both incidents have stunned the usually staid world of physics and
sparked a round of soul-searching over whether science has become too
competitive, too ambitious or just too careless in its rush to
discover the secrets of nature.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, Schon seemed to stand as a shining example of all
things prized by science--curious, rigorous and relentless.</TE>
<TE>   Schon, who did his graduate studies at the University of Konstanz
in Germany, looked ready to continue the brilliant legacy of
discovery at Bell Labs--remarkably producing dozens of scientific
papers in two years.</TE>
<TE>   His work focused on the daunting problem of how to wire together
minute transistors so that they could function as miniature
electronic devices--a major step toward the eventual goals of
creating microprocessors many times smaller and more powerful than
those based on conventional silicon chip technology.</TE>
<TE>   "The claims were so extraordinary that if they have proved true,
[a Nobel] would not have been out of the question," said Thomas N.
Theis, director of physical sciences at the IBM Watson Research
Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y. "We were all over [Schon's studies]
from the very hour" they appeared, he said, because the results could
not be explained by known models in physics.</TE>
<TE>   "If true, they would have been revolutionary," Theis said. "We
spent many months trying to replicate the results, but were unable
to."</TE>
<TE>   Nor could any other researchers--some of whom noticed the
identical-looking data curves and contacted Murray Hills, N.J.-based
Lucent with their concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Many of Schon's results between 1998 and 2002 were published in
Nature and Science, two of the most important scientific journals.
The panel indicated that Schon's actions made it impossible for them
to determine the validity of his results.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the process of trying to validate Schon's mysterious
data on molecular "monolayers"--a single layer of molecules used to
create an electronic switch, or transistor--may have indirectly
advanced the field.</TE>
<TE>   "By checking the claimed results and finding different results,
[the Schon studies] pointed the way toward further possibilities,"
said Theis. "It's probably a wash--some people have wasted their
efforts, yet the interest in the field continues to grow rapidly."</TE>
<TE>   The Lucent panel exonerated Schon's 20 collaborators on the
articles in question. But the panel's chairman, Malcolm Beasley, a
professor of applied physics at Stanford University, said the extent
of the misconduct raises troubling questions.</TE>
<TE>   "Did [Schon's collaborators] meet their scientific
responsibilities?" he asked. "We struggled with that."</TE>
<TE>   Collaborators in complex research rely on the personal integrity
of their colleagues, but this case suggests other checks and balances
might be warranted.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to soul-search about this," Beasley said. He noted that
rigorous participation in data analysis by all co-authors in a given
study--which did not occur at Bell Labs or the Lawrence Berkeley
Lab--might prevent a recurrence of such episodes. Lucent has already
moved to tighten its internal processes for reviewing scientific
manuscripts.</TE>
<TE>   Beasley suggests that journals such as Nature and Science could
use this episode as a stimulus to examine their peer-review process
by which outside experts comment on submitted papers before they are
accepted for publication. He urged them to rethink the balance
between reasonable precautions to prevent misconduct and the free
flow of scientific information.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the peer-review process was ever designed to be a
guarantor against clever fraud, and I don't think we can create one
that is," said Donald Kennedy, editor of Science. But he agreed that
the Schon papers are "a signal that you need to go in and examine
your procedures and make something work better."</TE>
<TE>   The discovery of the problems in the course of further examination
reflects the self-correcting nature of the scientific process,
experts agree.</TE>
<TE>   "Scientific misconduct occurred. That's not a good thing," Beasley
said. "But the normal processes of science worked--they ferreted it
out. There's some comfort in that."</TE>
<TE>   "Carl Sagan said that extraordinary claims require extraordinary
evidence," Theis said. "What I see here is that extraordinary results
cause extraordinary scrutiny."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The second 24-hour subway strike in two months made a mess of
Londoners' commutes, leaving an estimated 3 million passengers
stranded or struggling for alternative transportation.</LD>
<LD>   "It totally messes up my life," said Aviva Morris, emerging from a
packed overland train.</LD>
<LD>   Members of the Rail Maritime and Transport Union and the train
drivers union ASLEF walked out Tuesday night. Train service was not
expected to return to normal until this morning. The workers want a
pay raise; they have rejected London Underground's offer of a 3%
hike. Drivers on the subway, which is often criticized for its
delays, make about $51,000 a year.</LD>
<TE>   Mayor Ken Livingstone said the strike would cost London's economy
$93 million.</TE>

<LD>Ukrainian President Leonid D. Kuchma bowed to pressure and met with
opposition leaders who spent the night in the corridors of his
offices, but he bluntly rejected their demands for him to quit.</LD>
<LD>   Under pressure from Washington over allegations that he approved
the sale of a radar system to Iraq, Kuchma agreed to have parliament
investigate the charges. He has repeatedly denied arms sales in
violation of U.N. sanctions.</LD>
<LD>   But he refused the lawmakers' written demand to step down or call
new elections, despite a rally this week by more than 5,000 people
seeking his ouster.</LD>

<LD>Georgian officials said they had agreed to hand over to Russian
authorities 13 Chechens detained last month. The news came as
Georgian border guards said they had arrested four gunmen trying to
cross from Georgia into Russia.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutor General Nugzar Gabrichidze said Georgia would heed
Russia's repeated requests to extradite the 13 suspected rebels, who
were detained in early August.</LD>
<LD>   Russia has long been demanding that Georgia turn over the 13 and
do more to halt rebel activity in the Pankisi Gorge area. Moscow
claims the gorge is a base and supply line for rebels in the
breakaway Russian region of Chechnya.</LD>

<HD>Hindus Denounce 'Jihadi Terrorism'</HD>
<DH>South Asia: Angry over a temple attack that killed at least
32, group plans a strike. India blames Pakistan for assault, but
Islamabad denies involvement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>AHMADABAD, India</DL>
<LD>Indian troops stood by for deployment in the western state of Gujarat
today as Hindu groups called for a nationwide strike over an attack
on a temple that left at least 32 people dead.</LD>
<LD>   The World Hindu Council, a group tied to Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, led the
call for the strike.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, Indian officials blamed Pakistan for the attack and
said the assault was carried out by gunmen apparently bent on
avenging Muslim deaths in religious riots in Gujarat earlier this
year. That violence killed 1,000 people, mostly Muslims.</LD>
<TE>   Islamabad said India's allegation was false and irresponsible and
would only heighten tension between the two nuclear-armed nations.</TE>
<TE>   Most of those killed Tuesday at the Akshardham Temple on the
outskirts of Gandhinagar were worshipers, but the dead also included
at least one government commando and two policemen. Although initial
reports said three gunmen were involved, officials later said there
were only two and that both were killed by commandos. Seventy-four
people were wounded, including at least 23 police officers.</TE>
<TE>   Brig. Raj Sitapathy said letters found on the gunmen said they
carried out the attack "because they could not tolerate what happened
to children, women and Muslims during the Gujarat riots."</TE>
<TE>   The letters said the men, who were not identified, belonged to a
previously unknown group called Tehreek-e-Kasas, or Movement for
Revenge. No other group has claimed responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   The Indian army sent 3,000 soldiers to Gujarat on Wednesday to
guard against any new violence. The Defense Ministry said the troops
were requested by the state government, which had been criticized for
not acting quickly to quell the rioting earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   The police commissioner in Gujarat's commercial capital,
Ahmadabad, said some soldiers would patrol the city today.</TE>
<TE>   The World Hindu Council called for the strike to protest what it
called "jihadi terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   "The strike is to warn that if the government does not act in
time, people will take the law into their own hands," said Mohan
Salekar, the group's secretary general.</TE>
<TE>   The prime minister, who flew into Gandhinagar and visited the
temple Wednesday, said: "First there is a violent incident in one
place, then there is mindless revenge. We need to end this."</TE>
<TE>   Up to 500 pilgrims, priests, museum guides and souvenir traders
were in the complex when the attackers, armed with grenades and
AK-47s, zoomed up in a car and leaped over a fence. At first they
were mistaken for policemen.</TE>
<TE>   Jitu Shah, a 26-year-old tour guide, had just seen off a group of
tourists at the main gate.</TE>
<TE>   As he walked back, he was stunned by the explosion and the sight
of a man with a submachine gun.</TE>
<TE>   "He was in his early 20s, was wearing a pair of black trousers and
an olive green shirt," Shah said. "He suddenly started firing."</TE>
<TE>   One bullet hit Shah's left leg. He fell to the ground, writhing in
pain, and crawled to a nearby bush. He said he saw another man,
firing from another direction, before he passed out.</TE>
<TE>   Another witness, Rajubhai Sardar, a 31-year-old cloth merchant,
said: "They had grenades in their pockets and in their hands. Each of
them was armed with one big gun. They threw the grenade at us, and we
were all injured when the grenade exploded."</TE>
<TE>   Sardar grabbed his injured 5-year-old daughter when he saw the two
gunmen just in front of him. "One of them pulled my daughter. I fell
at his feet and begged him to let her go. The other terrorist then
gestured to let my daughter go, and they both left us."</TE>

<HD>American Kids Rescued From War Zone</HD>
<DH>Ivory Coast: French soldiers evacuate 161 schoolchildren
from a city held by insurgents. The president says a battle is
imminent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>BOUAKE, Ivory Coast</DL>
<LD>Shouting "Vive la France!" and waving U.S. flags, 161 American
schoolchildren were rescued Wednesday by French troops from a
rebel-held Ivory Coast city.</LD>
<LD>   The students and about 30 adults from the International Christian
Academy in the city of Bouake were escorted by French soldiers to an
airfield in nearby Yamoussoukro, where U.S. C-130 airplanes will fly
them to Ghana this morning, Pentagon officials said. U.S. troops
arrived at the airfield Wednesday afternoon from Ghana.</LD>
<LD>   The evacuation came amid concerns that a full-scale battle could
envelop Bouake, a central city of half a million residents. "We're
running out of everything," said one Ivorian woman, reached by
telephone. "We are scared."</LD>
<TE>   At least 270 people have been killed in the former French colony
since a coup attempt failed last week and insurgents seized control
of Bouake, the northern city of Korhogo and other towns. President
Laurent Gbagbo has pledged an all-out battle to crush the rebels.</TE>
<TE>   About 300 Americans live in Bouake, Ivory Coast's second-largest
city, which has been cut off from water, electricity and food since
last week's rebel takeover.</TE>
<TE>   "Our idea is to get as many out as possible," Richard Buangan, a
U.S. diplomat helping to coordinate at the staging area, said after
another night of gunfire outside the school on the city's outskirts.</TE>
<TE>   Those rescued Wednesday were elated. "We thank God that the French
came for us," said Sam Parham, an American living in Benin who was
picking up his two sons at the school when the uprising began. "There
was tracer going over the compound, and one mortar round hit inside
the compound."</TE>
<TE>   The insurgents--a group of disgruntled soldiers discharged from
the army--remained in control of Bouake on Wednesday, cruising the
streets in commandeered vehicles. In Korhogo, the mutineers went door
to door, rounding up paramilitary police and soldiers and
confiscating their weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Trapped in their houses, with no sign of the promised government
offensive, residents were becoming increasingly frustrated.</TE>
<TE>   "All my activities are paralyzed. I'm having trouble feeding my
family," mechanic Souleymane Coulibaly said. "If this continues, it
is us who will go dislodge the mutineers."</TE>
<TE>   A summit scheduled for today in the Moroccan city of Marrakesh to
try to defuse the crisis was called off without explanation. However,
West African leaders said they would meet Saturday in Senegal's
capital, Dakar.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-foreigner sentiment is growing in Ivory Coast after officials
said neighboring countries helped the rebels. Westerners have often
been accused of bias in favor of the opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of pro-government youths demonstrated outside the French
Embassy in Abidjan, which has sheltered opposition leader Alassane
Ouattara from what he has said was an attempt to seize and kill him
by Ivorian security forces during the chaos.</TE>
<TE>   Youths also attacked Burkina Faso's consulate and smashed shops
owned by some of the 3 million Burkinabe immigrants in this country
of 16 million. Ivory Coast has accused Burkina Faso of harboring
armed dissidents opposed to its president. Burkina Faso denies any
role in the coup attempt.</TE>

<HD>Russian Oil Exec Freed, Reportedly Without Ransom</HD>
<DH>Mystery: Victim is mum about his release. He was dropped
off at his home after 13 days of captivity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>A highly publicized kidnapping of a prominent Russian businessman
ended quietly and mysteriously Wednesday, with the executive
returning to his house in broad daylight and a prosecutor saying that
no ransom had been paid.</LD>
<LD>   Sergei Kukura, chief financial officer of Lukoil, made no public
statement upon his release by unknown gunmen after 13 days of
captivity. Russia's interior minister also was silent about the case.</LD>
<LD>   Police said Kukura was dropped off by his abductors outside his
gated home in a Moscow suburb. Authorities said they had made no
arrests but were investigating.</LD>
<TE>   Newspapers here printed various conspiracy theories, suggesting
that Kukura was not abducted for money but for information on the
labyrinthine financial structure of Lukoil. Such data could be useful
to investors, competitors or even government officials.</TE>
<TE>   "Sergei Petrovich [Kukura] is safely home. He feels OK now. That
is all we can say for now," said Mikhail Mikhailov, spokesman for the
powerful energy company. "As for all the absurd stories in the press,
I don't even want to comment on them," he added. "They must be the
result of an absolute lack of tact, taste, conscience and common
sense."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, newspaper accounts of the kidnapping tended to
express doubts about whether it was motivated only by a quest for
ransom, as Lukoil executives and police have portrayed it.</TE>
<TE>   One skeptic is columnist Yulia Latynina, who wrote Wednesday in
the Moscow Times: "Small-time criminals don't kidnap big businessmen
in Russia. Oligarchs are only nabbed when old personal feuds are
involved."</TE>
<TE>   Other articles suggested that Kukura was targeted because of
factional rivalries within Lukoil; as a means to drive down the price
of the company's stock; or to tap his knowledge of where Lukoil might
have hidden assets.</TE>
<TE>   "The wider public will never learn what really happened," Latynina
said.</TE>
<TE>   The 48-year-old Kukura was en route to work Sept. 12 when his
Mercedes was stopped by at least five masked men armed with automatic
rifles who took him away, according to his driver and bodyguard. The
two aides said they were injected with drugs and left unconscious by
the kidnappers, who had posed as police and were driving a car
bearing the type of license plate used by Russia's Interior Ministry.</TE>
<TE>   Lukoil offered a reward of nearly $1 million for information
leading to Kukura's release. There were reports that the company had
made contact with the kidnappers and that they were seeking a
$6-million ransom.</TE>
<TE>   Dmitri Dolgov, head of the Lukoil press service, said he could not
confirm whether any money had changed hands.</TE>
<TE>   However, Moscow regional prosecutor Alexander Mitusov was quoted
by the Interfax news agency as saying that "no ransom was paid."</TE>
<TE>   Lukoil accounts for more than 20% of Russia's oil exports. The
state owns a 7.5% stake in the company, which in August became the
first Russian firm to list its shares on the London Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

report.</TE>

<HD>Permanent Settlement Declared on West Bank</HD>

<DL>REHALIM, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Jewish settlers inaugurated a West Bank community Wednesday in a
high-profile challenge to government promises to bar new settlement
on land that Arabs claim for a future Palestinian state.</LD>
<LD>   "We won't let them take it. This is my home," Oshrat Aton, 21,
said at the celebration declaring a permanent settlement at Rehalim,
25 miles north of Jerusalem near the Palestinian city of Nablus.</LD>
<LD>   Indicating at least unofficial government support, Deputy Internal
Security Minister Gideon Ezra attended the ceremony and praised the
settlers' determination. "We won't move from here," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Successive Israeli governments, including that of Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon, have said they would expand settlements to accommodate
natural population growth but not establish new ones. The ceremony at
Rehalim apparently marked the first time that permanent houses have
been built in a settlement that the government officially views as
illegal.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian Cabinet Minister Saeb Erekat said the Palestinian
Authority would protest Rehalim's establishment to the United States
and Europe, which have called on Israel to stop building settlements.</TE>
<TE>   Rehalim is named for a mother of seven slain by Palestinian gunmen
in 1991.</TE>

<HD>Rumsfeld Reports Unsolicited Support Over Iraq</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: U.S. defense chief says NATO allies have given
quiet backing to potential war. Paris and Berlin don't appear to be
among them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WARSAW</DL>
<LD>Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said he did not come to a NATO
meeting here to drum up support for a potential war with Iraq but
that it came unsolicited anyway.</LD>
<LD>   Those giving their quiet backing Wednesday, however, did not
appear to include representatives of Germany or France, who have
expressed reservations.</LD>
<LD>   After an intelligence briefing Tuesday that linked Iraq both to
weapons of mass destruction and Al Qaeda, some defense ministers at a
meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization voiced support for
the Bush administration's policy of "regime change" in Iraq, Rumsfeld
told reporters.</LD>
<TE>   "I was not there yesterday or last night or this morning
soliciting support. You ask if it just happened to come over the
transom without being asked for. And the answer is yes," Rumsfeld
told reporters, declining to name the nations. "People did come up to
me and indicate in a variety of ways the views of their governments."</TE>
<TE>   The secretary has said he has not sought NATO backing for a
prospective war because President Bush has not decided to declare
one.</TE>
<TE>   The closed-door presentation of classified intelligence reports by
Rumsfeld and Deputy CIA Director John E. McLaughlin prompted animated
discussion during the meetings and at an informal dinner that
followed, NATO Secretary-General George Robertson said.</TE>
<TE>   Although no minister reported a consensus of opinion, Robertson
said: "There is a growing feeling that weapons of mass destruction
... present a growing threat to the international community."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Rumsfeld nor Robertson would describe the extent of
support for the U.S. position that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is
developing weapons of mass destruction in violation of international
sanctions and should be deposed, possibly by force. But it was clear
that NATO's most vocal critic of that policy, Germany, was not among
those offering the backing.</TE>
<TE>   The rift between the U.S. and Germany remained deep and wide
Wednesday, and American defense officials--whose displeasure is said
to reflect Bush's view--remained visibly not appeased by German
efforts at rapprochement.</TE>
<TE>   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder narrowly won reelection Sunday
after criticizing the U.S. policy toward Iraq. His justice minister
was forced to resign Monday after allegedly saying that Bush was
talking of war to distract Americans from a weak economy in much the
same way Adolf Hitler did, an accusation she denies.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Rumsfeld and National Security Advisor Condoleezza
Rice have said that Germany has "poisoned" a cooperative relationship
with the United States that had endured since shortly after World War
II.</TE>
<TE>   German Defense Minister Peter Struck apparently sought to smooth
things over during the three days of meetings. He said he shook his
American counterpart's hand. He also was visible near Rumsfeld when a
photograph of the ministers was taken, although the two did not
speak.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Rumsfeld challenged reports that he had left the
room before his German colleague spoke at the dinner.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he had spoken at that meeting earlier," Rumsfeld said.
"There was no snubbing that I saw in the entire meeting by
anybody--that was visible."</TE>
<TE>   Asked what advice he had for the Germans--whose defense minister
skipped Rumsfeld's intelligence briefing and returned to Berlin for a
political party meeting Tuesday--Rumsfeld at first said it was not
his place to offer other nations advice. Then, apparently unable to
resist, he added, "We do have a saying in America: If you're in a
hole, stop digging." After a pause, he shook his head and added with
a wry smile, "I'm not sure I should have said that."</TE>
<TE>   Minutes later, Rumsfeld left the meeting, apparently without
mending the rift with the longtime U.S. ally.</TE>
<TE>   Germany is not alone in voicing concern about the U.S. strategy on
Iraq. Among the skeptics was French Defense Minister Michele
Alliot-Marie, who said a war in Iraq could unite Muslims against the
West and initiate a precedent that would lead nations to launch
preemptive strikes.</TE>
<TE>   Russia, which has an economic relationship with Iraq, has also
expressed reservations about the prospect of war. Although Russia is
not a NATO member, it has had a formal relationship with the alliance
since May that involves consultations on a wide range of issues.</TE>
<TE>   As his Air Force plane headed toward Washington, the flight crew
played a film at Rumsfeld's request: "The Gathering Storm," the saga
of Winston Churchill's successful pre-World War II push to end
London's campaign of appeasement of a dictator known for his brutal
methods and of Britain's entry into a conflict that Churchill had
argued was inevitable.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Accuses Hussein of Aiding Al Qaeda Members</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush's national security advisor Wednesday accused Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's regime of sheltering Al Qaeda members in
Baghdad and helping Osama bin Laden's operatives develop chemical
weapons.</LD>
<LD>   Condoleezza Rice's comments--by far the strongest statements yet
from the U.S. government alleging Al Qaeda contacts with the Iraqi
government--were aired on PBS' "The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer."</LD>
<LD>   "We clearly know that there ... have been contacts between senior
Iraqi officials and members of Al Qaeda," Rice said. "We know too
that several of the [Al Qaeda] detainees, in particular some
high-ranking detainees, have said that Iraq provided some training to
Al Qaeda in chemical weapons."</LD>
<TE>   Although Hussein and Bin Laden both oppose the United States, many
analysts say their motivations are too different for them to work
together. U.S. intelligence officials have said some Al Qaeda members
have been detected in Iraq but they appeared to be passing through
after fleeing Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Rice did not offer direct proof of Iraq-Al Qaeda links, suggesting
only that details would be released later.</TE>
<TE>   "No one is trying to make an argument at this point that Saddam
Hussein somehow had operational control of what happened on Sept. 11,
so we don't want to push this too far, but this is a story that is
unfolding, and it is getting clearer, and we're learning more," she
said.</TE>

<HD>U.N. Examines Cracks in Iraqi Import Shield</HD>
<DH>Gulf: Ukraine's suspected radar sale is one of many alleged
deals by which Hussein is said to flout sanctions and exploit an 'oil
for food' program.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAGGIE FARLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>As the Security Council waited for a U.S. resolution on Iraq's
alleged failure to disarm, the United Nations on Wednesday examined
breaches in the program that regulates the Persian Gulf nation's
imports.</LD>
<LD>   A report on the "oil for food" program notes that the Iraqi
economy is improving under rules that allow President Saddam
Hussein's regime to buy humanitarian goods with the revenue from oil
sales. But the report also looks into ways Iraq has tried to skirt
the program's restrictions.</LD>
<LD>   In the Security Council session, program chief Benon Sevan said
Wednesday that Iraq appears to have ceased asking for kickbacks on
oil sales, and Syria insisted that the illegally built pipeline
between the two countries is not operational.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Ukrainian government announced that its foreign
minister will meet here today with senior U.N. officials to account
for its alleged sale of an advanced radar system to Iraq, in
violation of the world body's ban on selling military equipment to
Hussein's regime.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign Minister Anatoly Zlenko will respond to U.S. allegations
that Ukrainian President Leonid D. Kuchma personally approved the
sale to Iraq through a Jordanian middleman of a Kolchuga radar system
designed to detect aircraft without alerting the pilots. Kuchma
reportedly discussed the transaction in July 2000, the same month his
nation held the Security Council's rotating presidency.</TE>
<TE>   The White House made its charge after analyzing tape recordings
made secretly by a Ukrainian presidential bodyguard who later
defected to the United States. Bush administration officials believe
the tape to be authentic and have suspended about $54 million in aid
to the Kuchma government.</TE>
<TE>   The allegation is another in a series suggesting that Hussein has
flouted U.N. sanctions designed to limit the acquisition of military
goods and manipulated the oil-for-food program designed to ensure
that profits go to improve the Iraqis' health and education. The U.N.
program has been criticized for not letting enough money through for
humanitarian purposes.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue has dropped sharply in the last six months, the report
released Wednesday says, partly because of the sudden political
unpopularity of paying illegal surcharges that Baghdad has demanded
as part of its oil sales. As war looms, Iraq also is regarded as a
potentially unreliable supplier for customers who sign contracts for
future purchases.</TE>
<TE>   The resulting decrease in Iraqi oil shipments--from a high of 2.5
million barrels a day two years ago to just 1 million barrels
daily--has created a $2.5-billion shortfall in the program's
U.N.-controlled escrow account, Sevan said.</TE>
<TE>   However, U.N. diplomats observed several weeks ago that Iraq has
lowered and in some cases dropped the surcharge, apparently to revive
sales. Exports rebounded last week to an average of 1.9 million
barrels a day.</TE>
<TE>   "They have reduced their request for surcharges," said Norwegian
Ambassador Ole Peter Kolby of the U.N. Sanctions Committee. "I'm very
pleased sales have gone up, because everyone is concerned about
insufficient funds."</TE>
<TE>   Hussein has long demanded an end to the stringent U.N. sanctions,
which were imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. The requirement
that all imports must be funneled through the U.N. slows down the
delivery of food and medicine, the Iraqi leader says, and is
responsible for the deaths and suffering of hundreds of thousands of
his citizens.</TE>
<TE>   While U.N. humanitarian agencies agree that the sanctions system
needs to be more efficient, they blame the Hussein regime for the
Iraqi people's poverty. The Security Council says sanctions will not
be lifted until U.N. inspectors declare that Iraq is free of weapons
of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, the United States put finishing touches Wednesday on
a draft resolution to ensure Iraq's disarmament and sent it to
officials in Moscow, Beijing, Paris and London for feedback. The
resolution is expected to be introduced before the end of the week
but has been delayed by division over how explicit it should be about
military intervention.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration expresses little faith in the weapons
inspection system and wants the U.N. to authorize the use of force
against Iraq if the inspectors are stymied. Most Security Council
members appear to favor giving inspectors time to work before
resorting to an attack.</TE>
<TE>   "The trick is the balance," said a European diplomat. "It must be
something that is firm enough for the Americans and something with a
large enough threat so there is no wiggle room, but not so direct [on
the use of force], to allow France and Russia to sign on. This is a
difficult one to get right."</TE>

<HD>Researchers Probe Whether Sonar Caused Deaths of Whales</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At least a dozen beaked whales--including eight that died--beached
themselves in the Canary Islands off the coast of West Africa on
Tuesday following a NATO exercise that involved a cluster of warships
and submarines.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities are investigating whether powerful sonar caused the
deaths, and the government of the islands, a part of Spain, has asked
NATO to suspend all military maneuvers in the area, including those
by warships.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this year, an extensive study by the U.S. National Marine
Fisheries Service determined that sonar was to blame for the mass
stranding of whales during U.S. Navy exercises off the Bahamas in
2000. The study indicated that the Navy's mid-frequency sonar system
caused inner-ear bleeding, disorientation and other injuries that
drove the whales to beach themselves.</LD>
<TE>   NATO officials could not be reached for comment Wednesday. At the
Pentagon, a spokeswoman for the Navy said officials could not
immediately determine if U.S. warships were part of the multinational
NATO exercise.</TE>
<TE>   On the islands, veterinary school faculty members and whale
researchers began performing necropsies on seven whales Tuesday to
help determine the cause of death.</TE>
<TE>   The necropsy of an eighth whale, which washed ashore Wednesday,
was underway late Wednesday night, said Teri Rowles, coordinator of
marine mammal stranding response for the U.S. fisheries service.</TE>
<TE>   Four whales washed ashore alive and were pushed back to sea in the
hope they would survive, Rowles said. Because those animals were not
tagged, she said, there is no way to know if the animal that washed
ashore Wednesday was one of those pushed back out to sea.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that it was both males and females," Rowles said, "and
most of the animals are juveniles."</TE>
<TE>   Rowles and other U.S. marine mammal experts have been advising
Canary Island officials on what type of tissues to preserve to
determine the probable cause of death.</TE>
<TE>   Rowles said at least seven whale heads were removed and taken by
refrigerated truck to be preserved at a veterinary school on Grand
Canary Island.</TE>
<TE>   "It will probably be several weeks before we know the extent of
injury and the potential causes of death," Rowles said.</TE>
<TE>   Canary Island officials appeared to have acted promptly and
correctly in collecting and preserving tissue needed to determine if
sonar, explosive blasts or disease were responsible for the deaths,
she said. The tissue samples should contain the clues researchers
need, she added.</TE>
<TE>   The fisheries service has developed expertise in this area as a
result of its 18-month investigation of the mass stranding in the
Bahamas in March 2000.</TE>
<TE>   In that case, a quick-thinking researcher collected the heads of
dead whales.</TE>
<TE>   Analysis of the tissues showed that bursts of loud sound had torn
apart delicate areas around the brain and ears, causing them to
hemorrhage.</TE>
<TE>   Some whale researchers believe that sonar was linked to the mass
die-offs of whales off the coast of Greece after a NATO exercise
using both low-frequency and mid-frequency sonar in 1996. But, unlike
in the Bahamas, no tissue samples were collected for researchers.</TE>
<TE>   This week's stranding included three types of whales: the Cuvier's
beaked whale, Blainville's beaked whale and Gervais' beaked whale.
These whales are smaller than the great baleen whales, ranging in
size from 15 to 23 feet and weighing 2 to 3 tons.</TE>

<HD>Forced Migration Is Key to N. Korean Trade Zone</HD>
<DH>Asia: The ambitious plan would require the large-scale
transfer of people in and out of the proposed capitalist enclave.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>With a dose of wishful thinking, they are calling it the Hong Kong of
North Korea, but the plan to create an autonomous zone within the
communist country is riddled with questions, especially about who
would live there.</LD>
<LD>   To populate the new capitalist enclave in the northwestern city of
Sinuiju, the North Koreans intend to relocate up to 700,000 people,
roughly 3% of the country's population.</LD>
<LD>   The 50-square-mile enclave would be walled off to prevent North
Koreans from entering or leaving at will, which some say would be an
inauspicious beginning to a project that is supposed to bring new
freedom.</LD>
<TE>   "That is the vulnerable underbelly of this project," said Bradley
O. Babson, a North Korea expert and senior advisor to the World Bank.
"They are bringing in politically correct people and taking out the
old people. It is not a trivial percentage of the population of the
whole country, and you wonder what the social and political costs
will be."</TE>
<TE>   The forcible relocation of such large numbers could cloud the
project on human rights grounds and make international financial
institutions wary of getting involved, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Yang Bin, the Chinese tycoon sworn in as minister of the enclave,
told reporters Monday in Pyongyang that over the next few years
200,000 residents of Sinuiju would be moved out, while 500,000 others
with technical and administrative skills would move in. In other
accounts, the figures have varied.</TE>
<TE>   "Those living within the special zone will have to be moved within
the next few years," Yang said. "I cannot reveal details of the
plan."</TE>
<TE>   In Seoul, people familiar with the project say the North Koreans
in 1997 quietly began moving people out of Sinuiju--usually people
considered politically undesirable--in anticipation of designating it
a special economic zone. The North also started erecting walls and
barbed-wire fences, in some places adding on to dikes and flood walls
surrounding the low terrain.</TE>
<TE>   Sinuiju lies just across the Yalu River from the Chinese city of
Dandong. Its proximity to China has made it more prosperous--or at
least less impoverished--than other parts of stricken North Korea and
somewhat less beholden to the rigid central government in Pyongyang.</TE>
<TE>   "Sinuiju has been a rather troublesome city in North Korea because
its population is rather liberal and they are more resistant to
central government," said Lee Kyo Kwan, a journalist with the Chosun
Ilbo newspaper in Seoul who published the first reports last year
about people being moved out of Sinuiju. He estimated that 20,000
people--about 10% of the city's population--had been moved so far,
mostly those whose loyalty to the regime of North Korean leader Kim
Jong Il was in question.</TE>
<TE>   "They have been doing it slowly for five years to avoid creating
unrest," Lee said.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea has made large transfers of population in the past
with no apparent resistance from the generally obedient populace but
nothing so abrupt or massive since the early 1960s. The North Koreans
did not need to relocate such large numbers when they created a
special economic zone in 1991 in the sparsely populated Rajin-Sonbong
area.</TE>
<TE>   "People will be very angry they have to move. Maybe people will
not be able to express their anger, but this will lead many more to
defect," said Kim Eun Chul, 32, a former schoolteacher from Sinuiju
who escaped North Korea in 1997 and now lives in Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   How much instability will be created also depends on who is being
moved and to where. According to some reports, the entire population
of the city will be uprooted, but others say most of those moved will
be soldiers and government bureaucrats who are not originally from
Sinuiju.</TE>
<TE>   As with many aspects of life in North Korea, there was confusion
about the city's population. The permanent population of about
200,000 is believed to be supplemented by a "temporary" population of
government workers that may number another 200,000.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, experts on North Korea say, uprooted people were
moved to different areas to prevent collective grumbling. But Yang
said in an interview published Wednesday in the Hong Kong-based South
China Morning Post that large numbers of the dislocated would be
moved to a $50-million housing complex outside the walls of the
enclave.</TE>
<TE>   Jean-Jacques Grauhar, head of the Seoul branch of the European
Union Chamber of Commerce and a frequent visitor to North Korea, said
the North Koreans for years have been building a district south of
Sinuiju with the idea of moving the population.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm quite optimistic this can work," Grauhar said.</TE>
<TE>   Although he believes that European companies will be interested in
the project, he says it is mostly geared to trade with China. "The
location is ideal."</TE>
<TE>   Under the leadership of Yang, the enclave is to enjoy freedoms
unimaginable elsewhere in North Korea. It is to have its own
government, its own laws, the right to issue passports and a basic
law that guarantees "no discrimination on the basis of sex,
nationality, political belief or religion." Foreigners--Americans
included--are to be allowed not only to invest but to participate in
local government.</TE>
<TE>   "Kim Jong Il, when he does something, he wants to do it on a big
scale," said Lee Jong Seok, a North Korea specialist with South
Korea's Sejong Institute. "He wants to show the world his
determination in going forward."</TE>
<TE>   In combination with the liberalization of prices and exchange
rates in July, the creation of the capitalist enclave indicates that
North Korea is belatedly adopting the kinds of reforms enacted in
almost every other communist country. If the project is successful,
it is unclear to what extent tax revenue from the enclave would be
siphoned off for use by the rest of North Korea, but Pyongyang has
promised to keep hands off as much as possible for 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   As has been the case with other reforms enacted in North Korea
recently, the experts are divided on whether the bold, new measures
are charting a new direction for the economy or are merely gambles
made out of desperation.</TE>
<TE>   "They are throwing everything but the kitchen soup at the problem
and hoping to see what delivers," said the World Bank's Babson.</TE>

<HD>Abortion-Refusal Bill Wins Approval in House</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The House passed a bill Wednesday that would let hospitals and
insurance companies refuse to perform or pay for abortions without
forfeiting Medicare and other federal funding.</LD>
<LD>   Anti-abortion activists hailed the 229-189 vote as a key action
that would shield Catholic hospitals and other health providers that
oppose abortion. Supporters of abortion rights accused conservatives
of attempting to scale back women's access to the procedure.</LD>
<LD>   The debate provoked strong emotions among lawmakers.</LD>
<TE>   "The question before us is not the question of abortion," said
Rep. W. Todd Akin (R-Mo.). "The question is whether we protect the
various health-care organizations, whether we want to protect their
right to have a choice, to even have an opinion."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) countered: "This bill is not about
religious freedom or protecting the right of conscience. This bill is
simply about making it harder for women."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration earlier in the day offered its support.</TE>
<TE>   "Hospitals and health care professionals should not be forced to
perform or participate in abortions," the Bush administration said in
a statement Wednesday. "This legislation makes clear that they may
not be subjected to discrimination by the federal government, or by
any state or local government ... because they oppose or choose not
to participate in abortions or abortion training."</TE>
<TE>   It is unlikely the measure will win enough support for passage in
the Democratic-controlled Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters have maintained the bill is necessary to clarify
entities covered by a conscience clause in current law.</TE>
<TE>   Two Democrats from Ohio, Marcy Kaptur and Dennis J. Kucinich,
voted "present" on the bill.</TE>

<HD>Dueling Strategies Drive Fight to Control Congress</HD>
<DH>Politics: Democrats hope to persuade the public that
economic issues are more pressing, while the GOP stresses national
security.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>National security. Or economic security.</LD>
<LD>   Increasingly, the battle for control of Congress is pivoting on
which of these two issues end up dominating the campaign agenda in
November's election.</LD>
<LD>   Amid the pounding of war drums over Iraq, Democratic candidates
are struggling to focus public attention on economic issues,
especially the long-term stability of Social Security.</LD>
<TE>   But Republicans--in states from Minnesota to Texas and South
Carolina to Colorado--are stressing defense issues, hoping to paint
their Democratic opponents as weak on national security and
capitalize on strong public approval of President Bush's performance
as commander in chief.</TE>
<TE>   These efforts are clearly angering Democrats, as demonstrated by
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle's impassioned accusation Wednesday
that Bush is politicizing the debate over war with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, many analysts say, defense issues are playing a larger
role in congressional campaigns this year than at any point since the
Vietnam era. "In recent times, there's been nothing like this," said
David Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union.</TE>
<TE>   Two new national surveys suggest that, against the backdrop of the
sharpening confrontation with Iraq, voters are elevating national
security over the economy in their priorities, as Republicans hope.
But Democrats insist that voters remain more concerned about
kitchen-table economics--and will tilt even more in that direction
once Congress completes action on a resolution authorizing Bush to
use force against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The election may turn on which party is right: Polls have
consistently shown that voters give Democrats the lead on most
domestic issues, but prefer Republicans on questions relating to
defense and the war against terrorism. Each party is now working
feverishly to keep voters focused on the side of the equation that
favors them.</TE>
<TE>   "You have two completely different strategies," said Jennifer
Palmieri, communications director for the Democratic National
Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Now that Daschle has struck the first chord, some party operatives
expect Democrats to unify around charges that Republicans are
politicizing the war or unfairly questioning their patriotism. But
Republicans show no sign of being dissuaded by those charges.</TE>
<TE>   "We take it as a given that every one of these Democratic
candidates is a fine American," said Mitch Bainwol, executive
director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. "The
question is whether or not they have the judgment to make decisions
that are consistent with a strong America."</TE>
<TE>   The contrasting strategies are starkly apparent in state after
state.</TE>
<TE>   In Minnesota, for instance, Democratic Sen. Paul Wellstone this
week unveiled a new ad attacking his Republican challenger, former
St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman, for proposing to allow workers to divert
part of their Social Security payroll taxes into individual accounts
they could invest in the stock market. "Can we trust Norm Coleman on
Social Security?" the ad asks. "Absolutely not."</TE>
<TE>   Coleman essentially asked the same question Monday about Wellstone
on national security--and gave the same answer. While Wellstone has
expressed resistance to military intervention in Iraq, Coleman in a
major speech urged Congress to approve a resolution authorizing Bush
to "act forcefully on behalf of our interests."</TE>
<TE>   Alluding to Wellstone, Coleman argued that those resistant to
unilateral U.S. action would in effect "give a blank check for
unilateral action to [Iraqi President] Saddam Hussein."</TE>
<TE>   In one sense, Minnesota is unusual in this campaign. Wellstone's
skepticism about unilateral military action against Iraq has created
a clear contrast with Coleman.</TE>
<TE>   In many more states--especially those Bush carried in
2000--Democratic incumbents and challengers have said they would
support a resolution authorizing Bush to use force. But even in those
states--which include South Dakota, Texas and South
Carolina--Republicans are betting that broader Democratic views on
defense will be more vulnerable in an environment shaped by last
year's terrorist attacks and the prospect of a second war with
Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   In South Dakota, Republican Rep. John R. Thune has been
criticizing Tim Johnson, the Democratic senator he is trying to
unseat, over Johnson's vote against the 1991 congressional resolution
authorizing then-President George Bush's use force to drive Iraq out
of Kuwait.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Republicans ran an ad in South Carolina
criticizing Democratic Senate nominee Alex Sanders for accepting
contributions from the Council for a Livable World. The ad said the
council, a liberal arms control group founded in 1962, combined "a
peaceful name with a radical agenda, hostile to our men and women in
uniform."</TE>
<TE>   The GOP also has funded similar ads attacking Johnson in South
Dakota and Democratic Senate challengers in Colorado and Arkansas for
accepting funds from the council. In Texas, the state Republican
Party has funded an ad attacking Democratic Senate nominee Ron Kirk
over his support from the group.</TE>
<TE>   John D. Isaacs, the council's president, said Republicans are
correct to say the group advocates less defense spending and opposes
Bush's plan for a national missile defense system. "But to say
therefore that we are anti-military, against the men and women in
uniform, and would undermine this country smacks of the old
McCarthyism," he contended.</TE>
<TE>   The council recently organized 38 former government officials to
issue a statement defending it. But tellingly, Isaacs said, the
Democrats under attack generally have encouraged the group not to
respond more visibly.</TE>
<TE>   "They mostly say they want to focus on other issues; let's not
blow this up any more than necessary," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Democratic Senate candidates in Missouri, South Dakota,
North Carolina, South Carolina and elsewhere are betting as heavily
on voter interest in Social Security as the GOP is on national
security. Under fire for his defense views, Sanders in South Carolina
this week aired a new ad criticizing his Republican opponent, Rep.
Lindsey O. Graham, for supporting private investment accounts in
Social Security--what the ad called "a risky Social Security stock
market scheme."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Carrick, a Los Angeles-based Democratic strategist advising
Sanders, argued that Social Security is likely to move voters more
than Iraq, partly because the two candidates agree that Bush should
be authorized to confront Hussein. "I think there is going to be more
traction in these economic issues because there is a distinction"
between the candidates, Carrick said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, amid all the media focus on Iraq, a CNN/USA Today/Gallup
Poll this week found that 50% of likely voters now say the
possibility of war with Hussein will be most important in their vote,
compared to 38% who cited the economy. Similarly, in a new CBS
survey, 55% of adults said terrorism and national security should be
the country's top priority while 33% cited the economy and jobs.</TE>

<HD>Auction Puts a Price Tag on Enron's Spoils</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN K. STACK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>These were the remnants of a fallen corporate giant: the air hockey
tables and leather sofas; the IBMs and the paper shredders; the
fleets of ergonomic chairs left empty when thousands of energy
workers lost their jobs, and the infamous "E" for Enron.</LD>
<LD>   In a ritual of iconography and free market recycling, Enron Corp.
hawked the scraps of its disgraced empire at auction Wednesday.
Throngs of curiosity seekers and scavenger hunters packed the
ballroom of a chain hotel--and paid hefty prices to get their hands
on a souvenir of corporate downfall.</LD>
<LD>   "It's show and tell," said Michael Kowalczyk, a hardware
specialist who lined up hoping to scoring some cheap computer parts.
"People want a piece of Enron."</LD>
<TE>   True to form, the Enron artifacts carried no warranty--and nothing
came cheap. The cash goes straight to creditors--a sliver of the
company's debt, which has climbed higher than $50 billion,
spokeswoman Karen Denne said. "This is a drop in the bucket," she
said with a sigh.</TE>
<TE>   When the sun rose Wednesday, former Enron programmer Stephen
Bennett pulled on his old Enron T-shirt, slipped a Christian rap CD
into his portable disc player and stuck a book about conspiracy
theories under his arm. He came to the sale in search of something,
but he wasn't sure what. He'd know it when he saw it, he
said--something that would remind him of the old days.</TE>
<TE>   "Owning a little bit of it is a way of stepping on top of it," he
said. "It's saying, 'I've lasted, I'm above it and I'm still here.'
It'll be a good lesson down the road."</TE>
<TE>   People began to gather before dawn. Some came to scrimp on used
furniture, and others came to splurge on pricey trinkets. They came
to gawk. They came to salvage. And they came thicker than anybody
expected. "It's controlled chaos," DoveBid project manager Gary Bean
said.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1,500 shoppers packed the makeshift auction hall, and
hundreds more stood on the hot pavement outside in the hopes of
getting in. They shifted their weight all morning, and by noon hotel
workers hauled out coolers of ice cream and pitchers of water to
relieve the long wait. From 49 states and more than a dozen
countries, 12,000 online bidders jammed the auction house Web site.</TE>
<TE>   "We do auctions all the time, and I've never seen anything like
this," DoveBid auction director Todd Moutafian said. "These are
novice bidders. They need a lot of education and hand-holding."</TE>
<TE>   Things got rolling with the sale of a $175 basketball hoop. "They
worked long days--they needed to relax sometimes," explained
spokesman Eric Thode.</TE>
<TE>   Prices started out inflated--and grew progressively fatter. Used
computer screens fetched twice their sale cost. A marble coffee table
went for $1,000. "It shows you they're going crazy," Bean said,
"simply because of the name." The plasma screens that once piped CNBC
and the Weather Channel onto Enron's frenetic trading floors went for
$7,500 each.</TE>
<TE>   There were plenty of scavengers who hoped to flout superstition
and seed their own small businesses with the discounted crumbs of
Enron. These entrepreneurs hunched intently over their catalogs,
circling equipment they needed and muttering into their cell phones
to their bosses. As the bids climbed higher, they moaned, raked their
hands through their hair and cried, "That's 3-year-old technology!"</TE>
<TE>   And then came the piece de resistance: The 200-pound, stainless
steel "E" that once jutted skyward outside the company's downtown
offices. Set askew on its marble base, the Paul Rand creation was a
shiny and familiar landmark at the head of Energy Alley. After the
company's inglorious collapse, the letter was dubbed "crooked E," a
bitter symbol of a band of workers--and a city--defrauded by the
fallen energy giant.</TE>
<TE>   "I was going to get it as sort of a reminder," Houston lawyer John
Quindlan said. "I was going to look at it every time I thought about
doing a stupid thing. Or a fraudulent thing."</TE>
<TE>   But as the quotes whisked past $25,000 with barely a pause,
Quindlan shook his head and lowered himself into his seat. The statue
had proved too pricey, after all.</TE>
<TE>   Within minutes, the Internet bidders dropped back, and two men
near the back of the ballroom faced off. Journalists jostled through
the crowds to swing their cameras from the face of one bidder to the
next. Each new price drew gasps and claps from an adrenalin-driven
crowd. The price hit $40,000, and kept climbing.</TE>
<TE>   When Jimmy Luu's $44,000 bid snagged the looming logo, the crowd
erupted in a roaring cheer and Luu's fist thrust victoriously into
the air. His boss at a Houston computer store instructed him to pull
out all the stops to get the infamous sculpture, an exuberant Luu
explained.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'Just do anything to get it,' " he told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   The morning was getting late when Brian Cruver strolled toward the
ballroom. Laid off from Enron's trading floor less than a year ago,
the enterprising Cruver went on to cobble his misfortune into a new
career.</TE>
<TE>   From the ashes of Enron, Cruver penned a successful book, "Anatomy
of Greed: The Unshredded Truth From an Enron Insider." He arrived at
the auction after a jaunt to Winnipeg, Canada, where he filmed a
cameo in the made-for-TV movie based on his book. Glancing
impassively at the throngs of would-be shoppers--and at a poster for
the job fair next door--he quipped that he'd come to recover his
onetime chair.</TE>
<TE>   "Getting laid off from Enron," he said, "was the greatest
experience."</TE>

<HD>Balloon Mission Is Abandoned</HD>

<DL>HEBRON, Conn.</DL>
<LD>A British balloonist abandoned his attempt to become the first person
to cross the Atlantic in an open wicker basket and crash-landed
Wednesday in a stand of trees in Connecticut.</LD>
<LD>   When asked if he was hurt, 45-year-old David Hempleman-Adams
responded, "Only my pride."</LD>
<LD>   Hempleman-Adams said he decided to land because the autopilot
mechanism on his balloon was malfunctioning.</LD>
<TE>   "On a solo trip, you need an autopilot. Otherwise you're not going
to get any sleep. You'd be nuts to try without it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The basket landed on the ground, but the balloon top stuck out
over the trees in a dairy farming area 20 miles east of Hartford.</TE>
<TE>   Hempleman-Adams was alone in the 7-by-4-foot basket, carried by a
hot-air-and-helium balloon 12 stories high.</TE>
<TE>   The trip started Tuesday near Pittsburgh and was meant to end
Saturday or Sunday in Portugal.</TE>
<TE>   The solo distance record for such a balloon is 3,318 miles.</TE>
<TE>   The first balloon voyage across the Atlantic was made in 1978 by
Americans Maxie Leroy Anderson, Ben Abruzzo and Larry Newman. The
first solo voyage was completed in 1984 by another American, Joseph
Kittinger.</TE>
<TE>   Hempleman-Adams said he chose the open wicker basket because he
wanted to "recapture the golden age of balloonists and explorers."
His flight team said he will try again next year.</TE>

<HD>Las Vegas Bingo Scam Discovered</HD>
<DH>Crime: Case is linked to engineer who jumped to his death.
Use of game devices halted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Nevada gambling regulators on Wednesday were trying to gauge the
extent of a Las Vegas bingo scam they think was developed by a Reno
software engineer who jumped to his death from the Golden Gate Bridge
before he was questioned.</LD>
<LD>   "We're investigating whether this individual acted alone," Dennis
Neilander, head of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, said of former
GameTech Inc. engineer Brett Norman Keeton. "It's unfortunate that
you have an individual that, because of his inside knowledge, was
able to do this."</LD>
<LD>   Nevada's top gambling regulator said the state pulled the plug
late Monday on GameTech electronic hand-held and console bingo card
tracking systems at 13 off-Strip Las Vegas casinos and one bingo hall
each in Reno, Pahrump and Mesquite.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a fairly drastic move to shut down an entire system,"
Neilander said. "We still don't know how he did it. He corrupted the
system and altered the system after it was installed."</TE>
<TE>   Neilander said almost 3,200 hand-held electronic bingo card
counters were allowed back in service late Tuesday, while
investigators continued to try to determine whether other players
were affected and how much money the scheme netted.</TE>
<TE>   Keeton probably acted alone, Neilander said, and may have kept
winnings below $1,200 to avoid having to fill out Internal Revenue
Service paperwork.</TE>
<TE>   He stressed that the bingo ball draw and random number generators
at the heart of the grid game were not affected.</TE>
<TE>   About 280 console-style bingo card minders were still idled
Wednesday while GameTech officials fixed a program that Keeton
allegedly used to increase his odds of winning. Officials said he
obtained free electronic bingo "cards" and increased the number he
could play at once.</TE>
<TE>   GameTech has sold about 7,000 console-style bingo counters and
50,000 hand-held devices to casinos and bingo halls in 30 states and
to 14 Indian tribes, a company spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   Players can use the devices to track and tally dozens of bingo
cards electronically.</TE>
<TE>   GameTech chief Clarence Thiesen issued a statement calling Keeton
one of the developers of the company's software and said he was one
of the few people with the knowledge to get around software safety
designs.</TE>
<TE>   Keeton, 38, worked for the company for six years, but he was
dismissed Friday, Walsh said.</TE>
<TE>   Family lawyer David Houston of Reno said "suspicion and
allegation" about Keeton had not been proved.</TE>
<TE>   Neilander said gambling investigators, acting on a tip, observed
Keeton playing bingo at a casino in Las Vegas on Sept. 19.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators were waiting for Keeton at his job on Friday
morning, but he did not show up while they were there, Neilander
said.</TE>
<TE>   Keeton plunged from the middle of the Golden Gate Bridge about
8:25 p.m. Friday, said Ken Holmes, coroner in Marin County.</TE>
<TE>   Neilander said casinos where GameTech use was suspended were able
to continue games with paper cards and ink daubers.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge in Green River sentenced a carpet layer to six life terms in
prison for pushing his wife and young son off a 200-foot cliff in
1996 and for soliciting the murder of his parents a couple of years
later.</LD>
<LD>   A jury last month found James Robert Duke, 29, guilty of two
counts of first-degree murder, two counts of soliciting the murders
of his wife and son and two counts of soliciting his parents'
murders.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Jere Ryckman sentenced Duke to life terms on all six counts;
all but two will run consecutively.</LD>
<TE>   While Duke's attorney LaVoy Taylor sought concurrent terms, County
Atty. Harold Moneyhun urged consecutive sentences.</TE>
<TE>   Duke said he will appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Duke killed Liana Mae Duke, 22, and Erik Duke, 5,
because he was in an unwanted marriage and did not want to pay child
support. The couple married right after high school when Liana Duke
was pregnant.</TE>

<HD>Baltimore Archdiocese Paid $5.6 Million in Abuse Cases</HD>
<DH>Scandal: Cardinal also releases a list of clerics accused
of molestation. Some of the allegations dated to the 1950s.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Roman Catholic Cardinal William Keeler of Baltimore disclosed
Wednesday that his archdiocese and its insurers have spent more than
$5.6 million in the last 20 years on legal settlements, counseling
and other expenses stemming from incidents of child sexual abuse by
priests.</LD>
<LD>   Keeler also released a list of 56 priests and members of Catholic
religious orders who were accused of molesting children while serving
in the archdiocese, with some of the allegations dating to the 1950s.
Their names were posted on the archdiocese's Web site Wednesday,
along with the details about which parishes they served, when their
alleged misconduct occurred and how church officials handled the
case. Previously, the archdiocese had named 28 priests accused of
child sexual abuse.</LD>
<LD>   The cardinal's announcement is one of the most comprehensive
accountings that any of the nation's Catholic dioceses have provided
on the scope and financial cost of child abuse by priests, according
to church analysts and victim advocacy groups.</LD>
<TE>   "I think it's extraordinarily significant and may well become the
model for all 195 dioceses," said Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, head
of a national lay review board set up by U.S. Catholic bishops to
monitor compliance with their new child abuse policies. "This is
precisely what the children need, what lay Catholics demand and what
God's church must do."</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to the 180,000 registered families in the Baltimore
Archdiocese, which includes Howard and Anne Arundel counties, Keeler
said he was releasing the information to protect children, encourage
more victims to come forward and remove suspicion from priests who
are innocent of misconduct. He also said the disclosures were part of
the "transparency and openness" called for in the document that U.S.
Catholic bishops approved in June to address the church's national
abuse scandal.</TE>
<TE>   "Ultimately, there is nothing to be gained by secrecy except the
avoidance of scandal," wrote Keeler, who became head of the Baltimore
Archdiocese in 1989. "And rather than shrinking from this
scandal--which, too often, has allowed it to continue--we must
address it with humble contrition, righteous anger and public
outrage. Telling the truth cannot be wrong."</TE>
<TE>   According to the information it released Wednesday, the
archdiocese's insurers have negotiated and paid legal settlements
totaling $4.1 million in eight abuse cases over the last 20 years.
Archdiocesan spokesman Steve Kearney declined to disclose the names
of the accused priests in those eight cases, although he said that
six of the cases were publicly covered in the news media.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the archdiocese reported that since 1987, it has
spent $419,186 in counseling expenses for abuse victims; $112,520 in
legal expenses for accused priests; $387,019 for psychiatric and
other medical treatment for suspended priests; and $616,201 for
suspended priests' living expenses. Kearney said that only four of
the 56 clergy members named Wednesday were still receiving any
financial support from the archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   Kearney said the archdiocese did not release pre-1987 spending
figures because the records from those years are less reliable.</TE>
<TE>   Few other Catholic Church officials have been willing to provide
such financial data. A Washington Post survey in June found that 26
dioceses had released some financial information, including $106
million in acknowledged legal settlements. In May, Bishop Wilton
Gregory of Belleville, Ill.--who is also president of the U.S.
Conference of Catholic Bishops--disclosed that his diocese had paid
$3.1 million for legal settlements and counseling over the last 10
years.</TE>
<TE>   The Archdiocese of Washington does not plan to make a similar
financial disclosure, spokeswoman Susan Gibbs said Wednesday. She
added that she did not have a dollar figure for "the very few
financial settlements" the archdiocese has made and that it does not
release "personal medical information," including the amount spent
for counseling victims.</TE>
<TE>   Gibbs said that such medical and legal expenses have "primarily
come from insurance" and that none of it comes from the money
collected under the annual Cardinal's Appeal.</TE>
<TE>   The 56 accused of child sex abuse whose names were released by
Keeler on Wednesday consisted of 26 diocesan priests, 16 priests from
religious orders, three brothers in religious orders and 11 priests
from other dioceses who allegedly committed abuse while in Baltimore.
Also posted is the name of a diocesan priest convicted of possessing
child pornography.</TE>
<TE>   None of the men listed is currently serving in any ministry with
the archdiocese.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Is Urged to Quit Executing Youth Offenders</HD>
<DH>Crime: In plea, Amnesty International says the nation is
one of few left to allow such action.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ARIANNE ARYANPUR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Glen McGinnis' mother was a crack addict and prostitute who worked
out of the family's apartment in Texas. As a child, he was brutally
beaten, burned and sexually abused.</LD>
<LD>   At age 17, McGinnis robbed and fatally shot a store clerk and was
sentenced to die. After a decade on death row, he was executed by
lethal injection two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   McGinnis' case and those of juvenile offenders like him were cited
at a news conference Wednesday by Amnesty International USA, which
released two reports urging the United States--one of the few
remaining countries in the world that executes juvenile offenders--to
end the practice altogether.</LD>
<TE>   "Our law says that a person under 18 is not mature enough to vote,
not mature enough to serve on a jury, not mature enough to buy beer
and wine, not mature enough to serve in many jobs, not mature enough
to occupy most government positions, but is mature enough to be
executed in some states," said William F. Schulz, the group's
executive director. "Where is the logic in that?"</TE>
<TE>   The report, which was released a day after a U.S. district judge
in Vermont ruled the federal death penalty unconstitutional, comes at
a time of recent judicial action and growing national opposition to
the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, three Supreme Court justices called for the high court
to review the constitutionality of executing juvenile offenders.</TE>
<TE>   And despite public concern about rising youth crime rates, a
Gallup Poll in May indicated that 69% of Americans oppose capital
punishment for juveniles, while 26% support it. That is nearly a
reversal of a similar Gallup Poll in 1994, in which 61% supported
juvenile execution and 30% opposed it.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 38 states that still have the death penalty in the United
States, 22 execute juvenile offenders age 17 or younger, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   "In Louisiana, a person under 18 isn't permitted to witness an
execution, but is permitted to be executed," Schulz said.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of capital punishment contend that, even in cases where
the offender is a minor, the death penalty may be warranted. They say
attorneys often use a defendant's youth or--as in McGinnis'
case--cite a horrendous childhood as reasons for leniency.</TE>
<TE>   But Elkhonon Goldberg, a neuropsychologist and author who spoke at
Wednesday's news conference, said scientific data about the
physiological development of juveniles calls into question their
ability to fully control their actions. Even by the most conservative
estimates, the brain's frontal lobe--which controls impulses,
moderates emotions and influences decision-making--may not reach
maturity by age 18, said Goldberg, a professor at New York
University's Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   One of the reports released Wednesday, titled "Indecent and
Internationally Illegal: The Death Penalty Against Child Offenders,"
deals specifically with capital punishment of juvenile offenders in
the United States and draws parallels to the June Supreme Court
decision that abolished the death penalty for the mentally retarded.
Amnesty said it hopes that the Atkins vs. Virginia ruling, in which
the Supreme Court cited "evolving standards of decency," may have an
effect on future court decisions regarding juvenile executions.</TE>
<TE>   The second report, "Children and the Death Penalty: Executions
Worldwide Since 1990," explores what Amnesty called the growing
diplomatic isolation of the U.S. on the issue of juvenile offenders.</TE>
<TE>   In the last two years, the only countries known to have executed
convicts who committed crimes while they were under age 18 are Iran,
Pakistan and Congo, Amnesty said.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan, however, recently commuted the sentences of its juvenile
offenders on death row, and Congo has placed a moratorium on such
executions, Schulz said.</TE>
<TE>   "So now it's just the U.S. and so-called axis-of-evil member Iran
alone in the executioner's corner," Schulz said, referring to
President Bush's reference in January to Iran, North Korea and Iraq
as part of an "axis of evil."</TE>
<TE>   "This is not good company for the United States to keep when it
comes to being a model of respect for human rights," Schulz said.</TE>

<HD>Teen's Expulsion Over Threat OKd</HD>
<DH>Education: Federal court upholds Arkansas school district
action. Boy had written a letter saying he wanted to rape and kill
his ex-girlfriend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LITTLE ROCK, Ark.</DL>
<LD>A school can expel a teenage boy who wrote a letter during summer
vacation threatening to rape and murder his ex-girlfriend, a divided
federal appeals court ruled Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Pulaski County school district learned of the threat after one
of the eighth-grader's friends stole the letter.</LD>
<LD>   Northwood Junior High principal Bob Allison expelled the boy,
citing the district's conduct rules.</LD>
<TE>   The boy's parents sued. A federal judge in Little Rock ruled the
letter was not a true threat, concluding that the boy, identified in
court papers as J.M., did not intend to communicate it to the girl.</TE>
<TE>   A split panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed last
year.</TE>
<TE>   But in a review by the full court, judges split 6-4 on Wednesday
in ruling that the district could expel the boy, who was 14 when he
was expelled in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The court said a reasonable person would view the letter as a
threat, particularly his ex-girlfriend, identified as K.G., and that
the boy intended to communicate the threat to her because he let a
friend read the letter.</TE>
<TE>   "J.M.'s previous portrayal of himself as a tough guy with a
propensity for aggression made his threat more credible and
contributed to K.G.'s reaction," Judge David R. Hansen wrote for the
majority.</TE>
<TE>   In a dissent, Judge Gerald W. Heaney said that while the content
of the letter was chilling, the boy wrote the letter as a private
response to his breakup with the girl.</TE>
<TE>   Further, Heaney wrote, the school district failed to exercise
sound judgment in expelling J.M.</TE>
<TE>   "The board's draconian punishment is unprecedented among the
school threat cases across the nation," Heaney wrote, citing
instances where children who went to court were still allowed to
attend classes while the cases were pending.</TE>

<HD>Bush's FDA Nominee Finds Himself in a New Arena</HD>
<DH>Cabinet: Mark McClellan is strong on economics side of
health care, but lacking on policy issues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Dr. Mark McClellan, an authority on the wonky price side of health
care, faces a completely different challenge as President Bush's
choice to head the agency responsible for the safety of medical and
consumer products used by every American.</LD>
<LD>   If the Senate confirms the economist-physician nominated Wednesday
as Food and Drug Administration commissioner, it would be a new arena
for Bush's top advisor on health policy.</LD>
<LD>   McClellan's resume lists strong credentials relating to Medicare
and other funding issues the FDA is not supposed to consider, but no
experience in how to tell whether a new drug is safe enough to be
sold, what to do about tainted food or how to ensure blood safety.</LD>
<TE>   Bush, in a statement announcing McClellan's selection, gave him
the task of paying special attention to measures to protect the
nation from bioterrorism threats, speeding patient access to
breakthrough medical treatments, and making medical treatments safer.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters say he is a quick study whose understanding of everyday
health constraints will bring a fresh perspective to the FDA, which
regulates products that make up a fourth of the economy.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a very, very smart guy who ... has very sophisticated
understanding of policy and the many needs that need to be balanced
in setting policies, including those governing drug approval," said
Dr. Alan Garber, a health-economics professor at Stanford University,
where McClellan once worked.</TE>
<TE>   "FDA needs some strong leadership," said Dr. J. Edward Hill,
chairman of the American Medical Assn. He said McClellan was "a very
thoughtful person who's willing to hear all views," important in a
regulator.</TE>
<TE>   Also, McClellan meets a line-in-the-sand requirement from Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat whose endorsement is
critical, that no prospective FDA commissioner have ties to the many
industries the agency regulates.</TE>
<TE>   The long-awaited nomination comes at a crucial time for the FDA,
which has been leaderless since Bush took office.</TE>
<TE>   A General Accounting Office report this week said the FDA has a
hard time keeping skilled scientists it needs to evaluate drug
safety, with turnover rates higher than among any other federal
scientific agency. Critics also contend that increasingly speedy
approvals of new drugs have contributed to the recent banning of a
number of unsafe medications--and they worry that McClellan's lack of
experience with such issues could hurt.</TE>
<TE>   "He's inheriting a situation with low morale, due in our view to a
sweatshop atmosphere that now exists at the agency, which requires
both a management and stronger scientific response. He doesn't show
evidence of either," said Dr. Peter Lurie of Public Citizen, a
consumer advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate must confirm McClellan, and aides could not say whether
the required hearing before Kennedy's Health, Education, Labor and
Pensions Committee could be scheduled before Congress adjourns this
fall.</TE>

<HD>Ohio Executes Man for Rape, Murder of Child</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LUCASVILLE, Ohio</DL>
<LD>A man convicted of abducting an 11-year-old girl from a park 20 years
ago and then raping and strangling her was executed Wednesday for the
crime.</LD>
<LD>   State and federal courts had turned down Robert Buell's
last-minute appeals that were based on objections to the hypnotizing
of witnesses at his trial.</LD>
<LD>   Buell's execution was the state's fifth in three years.</LD>
<TE>   Buell, a former Akron city planner who lived in nearby Clinton,
claimed he was innocent and that there was no eyewitness or DNA
evidence connecting him to the crime. Prosecutors said fibers found
on the girl's body matched fibers taken from carpet in Buell's van.</TE>
<TE>   The victim, Krista Harrison, was abducted July 11, 1982, as she
collected cans in a park across the street from where she lived in
the village of Marshallville.</TE>
<TE>   In another execution Wednesday, Texas put to death a former
landscaper and parolee for killing a man during a 1994 drug deal.</TE>
<TE>   Calvin King, 48, became the 28th person executed this year in
Texas, the nation's death penalty leader, and the second in as many
days.</TE>
<TE>   King was the 283rd person executed in Texas since it resumed
capital punishment in 1982, six years after the U.S. Supreme Court
lifted a national death penalty ban.</TE>
<TE>   King was convicted of stabbing drug dealer Billy Wayne Ezell, 21,
to death at a Beaumont motel on Feb. 26, 1994.</TE>
<TE>   King, who had several theft convictions, was on parole during the
killing.</TE>
<TE>   Strapped to the gurney in the Texas death chamber, King made a
brief statement:</TE>
<TE>   "I want to say God forgives as I forgive. God is the greatest.
Thank you." Lethal drugs were then injected into his veins.</TE>
<TE>   King's execution was the second of two scheduled on consecutive
days this week in Texas. On Tuesday, Rex Mays, 42, was put to death
for fatally stabbing two young girls after they refused to turn down
loud music.</TE>
<TE>   For his final meal, King requested fried chicken cooked with
garlic powder and red pepper, French fries, a Dr Pepper and hot
sauce.</TE>

<HD>Ashcroft Orders Review of Asylum Cases</HD>
<DH>Security: Attorney general wants to identify immigrants who
may have terrorist links.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG KRIKORIAN and PATRICK J. McDONNELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft has ordered the INS to launch a "prompt
review" of potentially tens of thousands of political asylum cases to
identify any immigrants who have acknowledged being accused of links
to terrorism abroad.</LD>
<LD>   The directive stems from Ashcroft's concerns that INS officials
years ago overlooked the possibility the Egyptian immigrant
responsible for the July 4 rampage at Los Angeles International
Airport may have been connected to a terrorist organization before he
arrived in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   Although investigators from the FBI and other federal agencies
have found no links between Hesham Mohamed Hadayet and terrorist
groups, the Orange County resident acknowledged in an unsuccessful
bid for asylum that Egyptian officials had accused him of belonging
to Gama'a al-Islamiyya, also known as the Islamic Group. The
organization was subsequently labeled a terrorist group by the U.S.
State Department.</LD>
<TE>   Hadayet told the INS in 1993 that he had signed a statement in
Egypt admitting membership in the group but insisted it was a false
admission made under duress. Federal records show Hadayet told an INS
officer that in Egypt he had been beaten, immersed in water for 14
hours and forced to admit falsely that he was trying to overthrow the
government.</TE>
<TE>   Hadayet's bid for asylum was rejected by the INS, although he
managed to remain in the U.S. with a temporary work permit while the
case dragged on. The asylum case became moot when his wife won an INS
lottery that gave the family legal residency in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   On July 4, Hadayet, a limousine driver whose business was
struggling, went to the El Al Airlines ticket counter and gunned down
two people before he was shot and killed by a security guard.</TE>
<TE>   In a memo sent last week to INS Commissioner James Ziglar,
Ashcroft expressed irritation with the handling of the Hadayet case.</TE>
<TE>   "I direct you to undertake a prompt review of existing asylum
files to ascertain whether other individuals may be present in the
United States who have admitted that they have been accused of
terrorist activity or terrorist associations," Ashcroft wrote.</TE>
<TE>   INS officials have defended their handling of the Hadayet case,
while conceding that the Egyptian immigrant--like tens of thousands
of asylum applicants in the early and mid-1990s--probably scammed the
political asylum system to drag out his time in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Then, the system was overwhelmed with new applicants--many of them
with no legitimate asylum claim who were seeking a way to remain here
and work. The process ground to a virtual halt until reforms in
Washington cut down on the frivolous applications.</TE>
<TE>   How sweeping an inquiry the attorney general is seeking remains to
be seen. In the fiscal year that ended last October, the nation's
immigration courts received about 60,500 asylum applications.
Reviewing all the INS' voluminous asylum files could involve hundreds
of thousands of applications--most of them still in paper format and
not computerized--when the agency is behind on many of its principal
tasks.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll have to discuss this with the Department of Justice to see
how we'll proceed," said one INS official. "Yes, we'll do whatever we
have to do, but it's got to be realistic."</TE>
<TE>   At a news media briefing Wednesday, Ashcroft said his concern
about the asylum applications sprang from the Hadayet case.</TE>
<TE>   "I recently learned of a series of disturbing INS actions that
were connected to a particular subject from the West Coast in the
1990s, a subject that was involved in ... the LAX shootings,"
Ashcroft said.</TE>
<TE>   "And I want to know whether there are procedures or practices,
which would expose Americans to a kind of vulnerability to jeopardize
the safety of Americans that's part of the system."</TE>
<TE>   While the inquiry would encompass many other asylum cases, it
remains uncertain how any INS action could have resulted in Hadayet
having been immediately deported for any links to the terrorist
group.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond Hadayet's denial, according to those familiar with the
case, it would have been difficult for authorities to connect him to
a terrorist group, because his initial application was filed at least
five years before the U.S. State Department began designating certain
militant groups as Foreign Terrorist Organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, INS officials say that because of the backlogs
plaguing the system, it is specious to suggest Hadayet could have
been deported sooner if authorities had promptly acted on his
purported ties to a terrorist group.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, an extensive investigation of the July 4 shooting spree
has yet to uncover any connections between Hadayet and Islamic
extremists.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles FBI spokesman Matthew McLaughlin said Wednesday: "We
still have not confirmed any link between the LAX shooter and any
known terrorist groups."</TE>

<HD>Dismissal of Holocaust Case Rejected</HD>
<DH>Litigation: Federal judge turns down Italian, Swiss
insurance firms, who argued U.S. was not proper venue for claim on
Nazi-era policies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A federal court Wednesday rejected efforts of Italian and Swiss
insurance companies to dismiss a case by Holocaust victims and
surviving family members seeking payments on Nazi-era insurance
policies.</LD>
<LD>   Italian insurance company Assicurazioni Generali SpA and Zurich
Life Insurance Co. of Switzerland sought to get a judge to dismiss
the litigation, claiming that the United States was not the proper
venue to decide the case.</LD>
<LD>   Attorneys for the insurance companies argued that courts in
European countries in which the policies were issued should be used
to resolve the case. They also said a private commission--the
International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims--had been
set up to deal with such issues.</LD>
<TE>   But U.S. District Judge Michael Mukasey rejected those arguments,
ruling that the case could go forward in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The judge also found that the ICHEIC was not an adequate
alternative forum for the resolution of the plaintiffs' claims,
suggesting a possible conflict of interest on grounds that the
commission was financially dependent on the European insurance
companies.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's decision represents a victory for the tens of thousands
of persons whose parents or other relatives perished in the
Holocaust, and who are the potential beneficiaries of insurance
policies issued by Generali or Zurich Life," Morris Ratner, an
attorney for the plaintiffs, said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Ratner said his side was seeking not only payoffs of known
insurance policies from the Nazi era but a full accounting of
policies held by the insurance companies during the German campaign
of genocide against Jews and others during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   "There may be people who are heirs or beneficiaries who don't even
know the policies existed," Ratner said.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for the insurance companies were not immediately
available to comment on Wednesday's rejection of their efforts to
have the case dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve cases involving one or more plaintiffs each were directly
affected by the ruling, Ratner said. But the attorney said he planned
to move for certification of a plaintiff class that could allow many
more people to have their claims resolved in this U.S. court.</TE>
<TE>   However, he said that a trial was still a long way off.</TE>
<TE>   "There are many hurdles along the way between now and trial,"
Ratner said of Wednesday's developments, "but it's definitely a good
sign."</TE>

<HD>Actions in Senate Imperil Bill on Homeland Security</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Democrats offer new compromise on worker rights.
GOP rejects the idea.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Legislation to create a new Cabinet department for homeland security
edged deeper into peril Wednesday as key senators and the White House
traded accusations over who would be at fault if the bill falls
apart.</LD>
<LD>   With no end in sight to the Senate debate, now in its fourth week,
Democrats pushed a new compromise on rights for workers in the
proposed department. But Republicans said it was a nonstarter.</LD>
<LD>   In a sign of jeopardy for the bill--one of President Bush's top
priorities--party leaders on both sides warned of a legislative
collapse if a deal cannot be struck.</LD>
<TE>   "It would be a shame to let this go down the drain," Sen. Harry
Reid of Nevada, the Senate's second-ranking Democrat, told reporters.
"It appears to me that they [Republicans] do not want homeland
security. I'm dumbfounded."</TE>
<TE>   Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) asserted that
Democrats must give Bush more flexibility to manage the proposed
department, unencumbered by the usual government rules.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're not going to do it right ... then we shouldn't do it,"
Lott warned. "And let the American people decide who's to blame for
that."</TE>
<TE>   Bush and most congressional Republicans say the leadership of the
new department, which would have as many as 170,000 employees, must
be given maximum leeway to hire, fire, demote and promote its
workers. They also are seeking to loosen civil service rules on pay
rates, job classifications and other personnel matters in an effort
to create a system that would enable a quick response to terrorist
threats.</TE>
<TE>   Most Democrats and a few Republicans back the opposing position of
government employee unions. They say that the legislation, to be
effective, should not demoralize the employees that would staff the
new department.</TE>
<TE>   The compromise offered Wednesday, prepared by a centrist
Republican, Sen. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, and Democratic Sens.
John B. Breaux of Louisiana and Ben Nelson of Nebraska, would grant
Bush some flexibility on civil service rules but would limit his
ability to waive collective bargaining rights for certain employees
within the department. Republicans, though, complain that such limits
would undermine Bush's authority in a time of war.</TE>
<TE>   But White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Bush would veto
the bill if it includes the compromise language.</TE>
<TE>   "If homeland security does not pass in the Senate, it will be true
that the Senate will not have acted to protect the American people's
security," Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   As the rhetoric escalated, stalemate prevailed on the Senate
floor. Efforts to schedule votes on the key labor-management issue
foundered as Republicans and Democrats jousted in a series of
parliamentary maneuvers.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans, allied with maverick Democratic Sen. Zell Miller of
Georgia, sought to force the Senate to vote first on an
administration-backed plan. Democrats, backed by the Republican
Chafee, insisted on voting first on their plan.</TE>
<TE>   A senior Democratic leadership aide put the party's position
bluntly: "When [Republicans] get the majority, they'll get to vote
first. It's as simple as that."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's developments could be mostly bluster as the two sides
grope for a deal. It would be a monumental surprise if Congress fails
to approve a homeland security bill before it adjourns for the year.
The House passed its version in July.</TE>

<HD>INS Agents Indicted in Death of Worker</HD>
<DH>Crime: Three in Texas are accused of beating,
pepper-spraying an undocumented man.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three U.S. immigration agents in San Antonio have been indicted on
federal civil rights charges in connection with the death of an
undocumented worker whom they allegedly beat and doused with pepper
spray after handcuffing him in a raid last year.</LD>
<LD>   Serafin Olvera-Carrera, 47, a roofer who suffered a broken neck
and went without medical attention for several hours, died Feb. 24 as
a result of complications caused by the injuries received 11 months
earlier, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The Immigration and Naturalization Service deportation officers
were arrested Tuesday when they reported for work, triggering the
unsealing of a five-count indictment against each man.</LD>
<TE>   The indictment alleges that in a March 2001 raid at a Bryan,
Texas, home where more than a dozen undocumented workers resided, INS
agent Carlos Reyna, 42, assaulted Olvera-Carrera, a Mexican. Richard
Henry Gonzales, 36, later sprayed him with pepper spray. Reyna,
Gonzales and a third INS officer, Louis Rey Gomez, 36, were charged
with deliberate indifference to Olvera-Carreras' subsequent medical
needs.</TE>
<TE>   "The Justice Department is committed to vigorously prosecuting
those law enforcement officers who abuse their sworn positions of
trust and mistreat those in their custody," said Assistant U.S. Atty.
Gen. Ralph F. Boyd Jr. "Such conduct undermines the tireless efforts
of the many courageous law enforcement officers throughout our
nation."</TE>
<TE>   The trio's arraignment in Houston has not been scheduled. Each was
freed Tuesday on $30,000 bond.</TE>
<TE>   Conviction on all five counts carries a maximum penalty of 10
years in prison and a $250,000 fine.</TE>
<TE>   A separate civil lawsuit against the government, filed before
Olvera-Carreras' death, claims he did nothing to provoke the beating.
It alleges that after agents stormed the house, Olvera-Carrera was
thrown against a kitchen wall and onto the floor, hit, kicked and
struck in the upper back by a knee.</TE>
<TE>   The agents forced Olvera-Carrera to walk to a waiting INS bus and
dropped him on the ground, the lawsuit alleges, and then placed him
on a bus bench where he was pepper-sprayed.</TE>
<TE>   Hours later, Olvera-Carrera was taken to a Comal County jail,
where a nurse called an ambulance, according to the lawsuit. His
injuries left him paralyzed from the neck down.</TE>
<TE>   The civil suit seeks more than $9 million in damages for denial of
civil rights, assault and battery, negligence and denial of medical
care.</TE>

<HD>Wet Blankets the Party Spirit of Bourbon Street</HD>
<DH>Weather: Rains ahead of Tropical Storm Isidore pound New
Orleans, dampening tourism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIANNE HART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>The historic French Quarter was a sodden sight Wednesday as rains
from Tropical Storm Isidore pounded the city, sending party-goers
into hiding and tourist-dependent shopkeepers into a funk.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a fun city, a party town, but with this rain everyone
just wants to stay in bed and sleep," said a doleful Bob Sid as he
folded stacks of unsold T-shirts at his empty Bourbon Street souvenir
shop.</LD>
<LD>   On the wall, hot-pink feather boas wilted in the humidity. Mardi
Gras beads of every description hung from hooks and still the only
question from the occasional shopper was: "Where are your umbrellas?"</LD>
<TE>   It was a disheartening, if practical, question. With Isidore
bearing down on the Louisiana Gulf Coast, New Orleans--most of which
sits a few feet below sea level--was flooding in some areas. Pumps
worked overtime to keep down the water level in this basin-like city.</TE>
<TE>   Emergency officials Wednesday ordered 8,000 people in low-lying
coastal towns to evacuate. Another 8,000 people in nearby coastal
Jefferson Parish were told to leave earlier this week, said Walter
Maestri, director of emergency management for the parish. In New
Orleans, officials Wednesday set a 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. curfew to keep
streets clear for emergency vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Let the good times roll, they usually say here. But up and down
the quaint--and now flooded--streets of the French Quarter, the scene
was anything but festive: Torrents of rain sloshed and puddled
everywhere, soaking the few die-hard tourists determined to salvage
their vacations.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Hoffman and Cindy Cooper flew to New Orleans from Portland,
Ore., this week to celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary. "We're
used to rain," said Cooper with a good-natured shrug. Her hair hung
in damp ringlets around her face and a flimsy plastic poncho flapped
against her bare legs. "At least it's warm here."</TE>
<TE>   The couple had shopped for their children, sampled
chicory-flavored coffee, and taken a tour of haunted houses, but many
of their vacation evenings were spent at the hotel restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Although they planned to return to Portland today, Isidore may
change their plans. "We don't know if we'll be able to get out of the
city," Hoffman said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the downpour, Cheryl and Dennis Weber, who flew to New
Orleans from Virginia Beach, Va., were having fun at the Jazz Funeral
store trying on wigs.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing about the storm is that all the serious
restaurants seem to be closed," Dennis Weber said as he tried on a
baseball cap outfitted with a blond pageboy wig. "But on the other
hand, every place that serves serious alcohol is open. I guess if the
storm gets worse, you just drink more."</TE>
<TE>   That's what they're evidently hoping at Patout's, which is
advertising a 16-ounce Hurricane--a rum and fruit punch drink--for
$4.75, a bargain here.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a 'Brave the Storm' special," manager Carlos Carrasco said.
"I thought opening today would be an exercise in futility but I guess
we're getting all of the tourists who are stranded here."</TE>
<TE>   Usually Patout's is blasted by karaoke music blaring from two
neighboring clubs. On Wednesday, the loudest sounds came from the
pounding rain and the occasional curse as a gust of wind turned an
umbrella inside out.</TE>
<TE>   Isidore is expected to sweep ashore early today, bringing high
winds and the potential for as much as 20 inches of rain.</TE>
<TE>   Residents fled flooded coastal communities Wednesday night in
Louisiana and Mississippi as the storm approached. In Alabama,
pounding surf eroded beaches and storm preparations were underway as
far north as Birmingham, 200 miles from the Gulf of Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   The storm spawned a tornado east of New Orleans near the Florida
Panhandle town of Santa Rosa Beach late Wednesday but there were no
reports of injuries.</TE>
<TE>   As a storm precaution, many schools in the region were to be
closed today.</TE>
<TE>   City Hall in New Orleans also will be closed, but Boudreaux's
Backyard Country Store in the French Quarter will be open--much to
the disgust of store clerk Tee Bato.</TE>
<TE>   Already the store's roof is leaking water onto the voodoo dolls
and dried alligator heads. What will the morning bring? she asks.
"Who's going to be in the mood to shop after a storm? Baby, I tell
you this, the answer is no one."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MONTGOMERY, Ala.</DL>
<LD>A lawyer suing to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the Alabama
Judicial Building's lobby mistakenly sent a letter to his adversaries
in which he calls the state Supreme Court's chief justice a
"religious nut."</LD>
<LD>   Last year, Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore had the
5,280-pound monument moved into the lobby of the Judicial Building in
the middle of the night without notifying other justices.</LD>
<LD>   Southern Poverty Law Center director Morris Dees, who is suing to
have the monument removed, intended the letter for another attorney
on his legal team.</LD>
<TE>   "I was laying our trial theme, i.e., how this was the act of a
lone religious nut," Dees wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Moore's lawyer, Stephen Melchior, received the letter and filed it
in the court record in response to a motion asking a federal judge to
order removal of the monument without a trial.</TE>
<TE>   Dees is seeking to have the letter stricken from court record,
saying it was private correspondence that got into the hands of
Moore's attorneys through "a clerical error."</TE>
<TE>   Moore has said he installed the monument because he believes the
Ten Commandments were the basis of the American system of laws.</TE>

<HD>Ore. Capitol Emptied After Powder Found</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALEM, Ore.</DL>
<LD>The Capitol here was evacuated Wednesday after an envelope containing
white powder and a threat was found in a mailroom, but initial tests
found the substance was not hazardous, a state health official said.</LD>
<LD>   The powder will be sent to the FBI office in Portland for further
testing, said Grant Higginson, state public health officer. Officials
will conduct a third test to make sure no anthrax spores grow.</LD>
<LD>   The envelope bore a Pakistan postmark, Police spokesman Lt. Bill
Kohlmeyer said. Gov. John Kitzhaber said the envelope, found in the
third-floor mail room, was addressed to his office. He did not
disclose the nature of the threat or say whether it was against him.</LD>
<TE>   A mailroom worker and three state troopers called to the scene
were quarantined in the mail room, given showers and sent home.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of police and fire vehicles surrounded the building, and
the street in front of the Capitol was blocked off.</TE>
<TE>   Higginson said there have been many anthrax scares around Oregon
since the anthrax attacks last year, but all were hoaxes.</TE>

<HD>Skull Found Near Site of Girl's Disappearance</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MADISON, N.C.</DL>
<LD>A man reported Wednesday that his dog found a small human skull in
this rural area about 30 miles from where a 9-year-old Virginia girl
disappeared last month, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities--including a contingent from Henry County, Va., where
officials have been hunting for Jennifer Short since Aug. 15--quickly
descended on the site. Dogs were brought in to look for the rest of
the remains.</LD>
<LD>   The skull "appears to be from somebody young," said Jeannie
Justice, a spokeswoman for the Rockingham County Sheriff's Office.</LD>
<TE>   Jennifer Short disappeared almost six weeks ago. Officials believe
the girl was kidnapped after her parents were slain in their Bassett,
Va., home.</TE>
<TE>   For days after Jennifer's disappearance, authorities combed the
hills by her parents' house on horseback and four-wheelers.</TE>
<TE>   The parents, Michael Short, 50, and Mary Hall Short, 36, were shot
to death in their house along U.S. 220, about 35 miles south of
Roanoke. No arrests have been made.</TE>

<HD>Couple Charged in Starving of Teenager</HD>
<DH>Crime: Mother, stepdad likely will face homicide count. The
18-year-old weighed just 62 pounds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HAZLETON, Pa.</DL>
<LD>A severely malnourished teenager who authorities said was starved by
his mother and stepfather died Wednesday, four days after he was
found wandering a Florida town.</LD>
<LD>   Chester Lee Miller, 18, knocked on a stranger's door in Milton,
Fla., on Saturday and asked if he could take a shower and rest. The
woman gave him a sandwich and something to drink, then phoned for
help.</LD>
<LD>   The 5-foot-3 teen told police his stepfather in Hazleton had put
him on a bus to Florida and told him to go look for his real dad.</LD>
<TE>   Miller's mother and stepfather, Lyda Miller, 37, and Paul Hoffman
Sr., 38, were charged Tuesday in Pennsylvania with aggravated assault
and recklessly endangering another person. Hazleton Police Chief
Edward Harry said the couple will be charged with homicide.</TE>
<TE>   At a hearing Tuesday, Hoffman said he was on disability for mental
illness and that he was "deeply sorry" for his actions. "I have no
idea why I did it," he told the judge.</TE>
<TE>   Janice Goodman said Miller arrived on her doorstep Saturday with
sunken eyes and barely able to stand. He weighed just 62 pounds. She
said he told her he had been turned away from the home of an uncle in
the nearby town of Bagdad.</TE>
<TE>   "He looked like a Holocaust victim," she said. "I felt worried for
his safety. I felt as though he was going to die right there."</TE>
<TE>   Officials in Milton said they did not know how long Miller was
there before he was hospitalized.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he had been here maybe a week, but we aren't sure. He was
so malnourished, we weren't sure how clear his mind was," Det. Mike
Daughtery said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said Miller told Goodman that "his parents had been
very mean to him."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Miller's mother and stepfather confined him to
one room, beat him every day, fed him only scraps and didn't let him
out of the house to go to school or see friends.</TE>
<TE>   Two other children living in the couple's home were taken into
state custody when the couple were charged.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators believe the neglect started in May, Harry said. He
said the couple admitted abusing the boy, but didn't explain why. The
couple did not yet have attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   The family lived in Hazleton, a small city 80 miles north of
Philadelphia. Miller's grandmother lived in an apartment across the
hall. His cousin, Clifford Shipps Jr., 22, said the teen seemed
healthy and weighed at least 110 pounds when he last saw him about
six weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   "We were wrestling around in the living room, and he seemed fine
to me," Shipps said. "He had all kinds of energy. He's always been
small."</TE>
<TE>   Shipps said he hadn't seen any signs that Miller was being
neglected. He said the family chastised the teen for his grades and
occasionally made him stand in a corner as punishment. He said Miller
was "slow" and acted younger than his age.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said they had located Miller's birth father and
planned to interview him.</TE>
<TE>   School officials in Florida said Miller had gone to middle school
in Milton and attended high school for two-thirds of a year before
transferring to a charter school for students with behavioral
problems.</TE>

<HD>Scientists Bemoan Lack of Availability of Embryonic Cells</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Almost 14 months after President Bush first allowed federal funding
of limited human embryo cell research, U.S. scientists remain
frustrated by a lack of access to the controversial cells,
researchers told a Senate subcommittee Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The number of laboratories making the cells available to
scientists has begun to increase, senators were told. And a handful
of labs has now received grants from the National Institutes of
Health to help scale up production and distribution of the medically
promising cells.</LD>
<LD>   Nonetheless, scientists said, the restrictive nature of the Bush
policy, patent conflicts and the technical difficulty of keeping the
fragile cells alive have conspired to stifle research in what they
had hoped would be, by now, a highly energized research field.</LD>
<TE>   "Embryonic stem cell research is crawling like a caterpillar,"
said Curt Civin, a pediatric oncologist at Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine. The cells, Civin said, are accessible "only to
those persistent and patient enough to jump through a series of hoops
and endure lengthy waits. I am still waiting to receive my first stem
cell line."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, the ranking Republican on the
Appropriations subcommittee on labor, health and human services and
education, said he is worried that delays could undermine the U.S.
lead in the stem cell field. He noted that one expert witness
appearing before the subcommittee had already moved his research from
California to Britain's more inviting stem cell research climate.</TE>
<TE>   "A big issue arises as to whether [the Bush policy] is adequate to
carry on the research," said Specter, who supports proposed
legislation--widely regarded as unachievable this year--to broaden
federal support of the field.</TE>
<TE>   Embryonic stem cells show therapeutic potential against a wide
range of degenerative diseases, but the research is contentious
because 5-day-old human embryos must be destroyed to obtain them.
Opponents of the research point to evidence that similar cells taken
harmlessly from adults may have equal potential.</TE>
<TE>   Bush struck a compromise, funding research on cells derived from
embryos destroyed no later than Aug. 9, 2001. Since then a debate has
raged over whether those 70 or so cell lines are robust and diverse
enough to satisfy scientists' needs.</TE>
<TE>   Elias Zerhouni, the new NIH director, told the subcommittee that
his agency is working hard to make the eligible cells more available.
The NIH has awarded $4.3 million to five laboratories that account
for 23 approved cell lines, he said. Those and two additional pending
awards are to help labs scale up the growth, testing, quality
assurance and distribution of cells.</TE>
<TE>   The NIH has also helped four cell-supplying laboratories develop
material transfer agreements that spell out the intellectual property
rights of distributors and receivers. Six labs on the NIH campus have
received cells under those agreements, Zerhouni said, as have about
74 researchers at dozens of institutions in the United States and
abroad. The NIH has awarded scientists more than $4.2 million to
initiate experiments on the cells.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Pedersen, the California researcher who moved to Cambridge
University in England, said none of the cell lines approved by Bush
have real therapeutic potential because they were cultivated with
mouse cells, making them all but ineligible for transplantation into
humans. In contrast, he said, his team is developing new colonies
that he hopes will pass muster with the Food and Drug Administration.</TE>

<HD>Backers of U.S. Muslim Held in Terror War Call for His
Release</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Supporters of a Muslim man charged with trying to establish a
terrorist training camp in Oregon demanded his release Wednesday,
saying the government has offered no reason for keeping him in
"appalling" conditions in a federal jail.</LD>
<LD>   Earnest James Ujaama, a U.S. citizen who recently lived in London,
has been kept in solitary confinement at the Federal Detention Center
in SeaTac, south of here. He has been barred from contacting his
mother or the rest of his family, and has been granted just one phone
call to his lawyers in the last two weeks.</LD>
<LD>   There has been so much secrecy surrounding his case that officials
at the center routinely say they have no public record of him. Even
his lawyers were told that.</LD>
<TE>   "We were told that he wasn't there," Seattle lawyer Peter
Offenbecher said Wednesday. "And it's certainly true that he has not
been able to call or visit with his family. These conditions are
unwarranted and unnecessary."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, jail officials granted Offenbecher and co-counsel Bob
Mahler permission to meet with Ujaama, and they have seen him several
times since, Offenbecher said.</TE>
<TE>   But Ujaama's family and friends are furious. They called a news
conference Wednesday on the steps of the federal courthouse here.
Ujaama is scheduled for a detention hearing Tuesday at the
courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   "What threat does the government feel that I am, that I present,
that they deny me the right to meet with my son?" asked Ujaama's
mother, Peggi Thompson.</TE>
<TE>   She said she received a letter from him Saturday saying that he
was in good spirits.</TE>
<TE>   King County Councilman Larry Gossett said Ujaama volunteered with
black youth while growing up in Seattle's Central Area. "I'm
concerned about the appalling way the federal government is treating
Mr. Ujaama," Gossett said. "What's happened to him has happened to a
lot of other citizens caught up in the war on terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. attorney's office in Seattle declined to comment, and
Russell Heisner, a spokesman for the Federal Detention Center in
SeaTac, refused to discuss Ujaama's conditions there.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no public information about this person," Heisner said.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, a federal Bureau of Prisons spokeswoman in Washington,
D.C., said she had no record of anyone named Ujaama. She recommended
typing his prisoner reference number into a search engine on the
Bureau of Prisons Web site; doing so yielded only a statement
reading, "We have no record of an inmate with a Register Number of
31117-013 in our database."</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. Marshals spokesman in Seattle was the only government
official to confirm that Ujaama, 36, is being held in SeaTac.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities arrested Ujaama on July 22 in Denver, where he was
visiting his brother, and held him as a material witness.</TE>
<TE>   He wasn't accused of a crime until Aug. 29, when a grand jury in
Seattle indicted him on one count of conspiracy to provide material
support for the Al Qaeda terrorist network, and another count of
using, carrying, possessing and discharging firearms during a crime.</TE>
<TE>   Ujaama has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Published reports
have indicated he is a friend of the radical London cleric Abu Hamza
Al-Masri and ran a now-defunct anti-American Web site.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment says a cooperating witness described a conspiracy
in which Ujaama tried to set up a terrorist training camp in Bly,
Ore. The Justice Department has offered little in the way of
evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Nestor, president of the National Lawyers Guild, a New
York-based group, said Ujaama's case illustrates the dangers of
expanding the executive branch's powers since the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Ujaama is one of an unknown number--in the range of 2,000--of
people who were picked up, jailed in secrecy and routinely denied
access to attorneys, to family," Nestor said.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless the government can make a compelling case to the contrary,
we call for James Ujaama to be removed from isolation and allowed to
communicate with his family and friends."</TE>

<LD>A good field of geldings will run for the money over 350 yards
tonight in the $12,550 seventh race.</LD>
<LD>   A Secret Account won four stakes races in 2001 for owner Rodney
Hart and is coming off an Aug. 23 allowance victory in which it beat
Laura Lukas' Go Green Go. Meddlin In Money has won seven of 11 races
and earned nearly $200,000 in 2001 for the Double Bar S Ranch
syndicate. Go Green Go gets a rematch after having finished first in
six of the last 10 races it has entered.</LD>
<LD>   Panther Mountain, who won Sunday's 350-yard eighth race, will be
aimed toward the Nov. 1 Los Alamitos Derby, according to trainer
Charlie Treece.</LD>
<TE>   Trials for the Derby are Oct. 18. Before Sunday, there was some
question whether Panther Mountain was over the hill after a
seventh-place finish in the Aug. 17 Golden State Derby.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Mtc Hollywood Hunk 2. Bobbin Lee 3. Emmy Time 4.
Adriannas Cruisin 5. Delusively 6. A Secret Chick 7. A Secret Account
8. Chasen Moms Dream.</TE>
<TE>   Four: In the first, Mtc Hollywood Hunk and Hi Karate Aftershave.
In the second, it's Bobbin Lee. In the third, take Emmy Time and Cee
A Dash. In the fourth, it's A Choice Effort, Adriannas Cruisin and
Sharin The Cash. Cost: $12.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: In the fourth, the Sorrell filly Sharin The
Cash, with Carlos Bautista aboard, could earn a win in a field full
of geldings. In the eighth, take Flight 243 on the outside.</TE>

<HD>Boston's Hopes Are Dashed at Chicago</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They've won 91 games and had what would be considered by most
standards a stellar season. Still, the Boston Red Sox won't be in the
playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   Their slim hopes for a playoff spot were officially ended
Wednesday night when the Chicago White Sox hit three homers in a 7-2
victory at Comiskey Park, eliminating Boston from the American League
wild-card chase.</LD>
<LD>   "We tried to prolong it as long as we could," first-year Manager
Grady Little said. "It was a situation where for this thing to
happen, we had to win 10 in a row and [the Angels] had to lose eight
in a row.</LD>
<TE>   "It is possible, but it was definitely a long shot. But as long as
you still have a pulse, you have hope."</TE>
<TE>   Boston needed to win its final five games and have the Angels lose
their last five to set up a playoff for the wild card. The Angels
lost to Texas, 4-3, Wednesday, but the Red Sox already were out of
the wild-card mix.</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander Derek Lowe (21-8) gave up five runs and two homers in
seven innings.</TE>
<TE>   Lowe gave up a single to Frank Thomas and a walk to Jeff Liefer in
the fourth, and Joe Crede hit the next pitch into the left-field
bullpen for his 12th homer and a 4-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Liefer hit a solo homer against Lowe in the seventh. Magglio
Ordonez hit a two-run homer, his 37th, in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   New York 4, Tampa Bay 3--Alfonso Soriano hit a tiebreaking double
at Yankee Stadium and Mariano Rivera got his first save in more than
a month.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees reached 100 victories for the 16th time in franchise
history.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Clemens recovered from a rocky start to retire 14 of the
last 15 batters and Jeff Weaver (11-11) pitched three scoreless
innings for his first relief victory ever.</TE>
<TE>   Rivera, who came off the disabled list Saturday, earned his 28th
save and first since Aug. 15.</TE>
<TE>   Soriano doubled twice but remained stuck on 39 homers. He is
trying to become the fourth player in major league history with 40
homers and 40 stolen bases. Soriano leads the AL with 41 steals.</TE>
<TE>   Clemens gave up three runs and four hits in five innings. He
remained at 293 career victories.</TE>
<TE>   Tanyon Sturtze (4-18) became the first AL pitcher to lose 18 games
since Minnesota's Scott Erickson had 19 losses in 1993. Albie Lopez
lost 19 games for Tampa Bay and Arizona last season.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 3, Baltimore 2--Vernon Wells homered at Toronto to reach
100 runs batted in, and the Blue Jays sent the Orioles to their
eighth loss in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Wells' 23rd homer made the 23-year-old outfielder the youngest
Toronto player to drive in 100 runs.</TE>
<TE>   Former NBA player Mark Hendrickson (3-0) won his third consecutive
start. The 6-foot-9 rookie gave up one run and five hits in seven
innings.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 7, Cleveland 5--David Ortiz hit a two-run homer in the
12th inning to lift the Twins at Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland's Jim Thome hit two home runs to give him a career high
50, tying Albert Belle's team record set in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 7, Kansas City 6--A sacrifice fly by Chris Truby in the
12th inning lifted the host Royals.</TE>

<HD>One Is Loneliest Number</HD>
<DH>Angels: Anaheim still stuck on its magic number after 4-3
loss to Rangers, the fourth consecutive setback.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ARLINGTON, Texas</DL>
<LD>The Angels slipped out of the clubhouse late Wednesday night, very
quietly. They had lost, again. They did not hang around to see
whether they would celebrate together, for in defeat they saw nothing
to celebrate.</LD>
<LD>   As it turned out, there was nothing to celebrate. No playoff berth
has been clinched. The Seattle Mariners stayed alive with a victory
over Oakland, a couple of hours after the Angels lost, and the
American League's wild-card berth remains unclaimed.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday, the Angels needed one victory to clinch their first
playoff berth in 16 years. They still do, after losing their fourth
consecutive game, this one 4-3 to the Texas Rangers.</LD>
<TE>   "We are going to get to the playoffs," Angel closer Troy Percival
said, an air of defiance about him. "There's no panic whatsoever."</TE>
<TE>   But, said outfielder Tim Salmon, "Everybody's frustrated."</TE>
<TE>   The wild-card picture, so scrambled Tuesday, became abundantly
clear Wednesday. The Boston Red Sox lost to the Chicago White Sox, so
they were eliminated. That leaves the Angels and Mariners standing in
the race for the wild-card playoff entry.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners would have to win all four remaining games, and the
Angels would have to lose all four, to force a one-game playoff
Monday in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, we have the luxury of having a few lifelines," Salmon
said.</TE>
<TE>   The order before the Mariners is imposing, to be sure, but far
from impossible. The Mariners have won four in a row, and the Angels
have lost four in a row. After today's games, the Mariners and Angels
conclude the regular season with three games in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   That leaves the Angels with this stark choice: Beat rookie Colby
Lewis today, or risk facing the Mariners at a time when they would be
the hottest team in the major leagues, the Angels would be the
coldest, and the Mariners would be only too happy to remind people
about the Great Collapse of '95.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle trailed the Angels by 13 games that August and--omen
anyone?--beat the Angels in a one-game playoff.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels had not lost four consecutive games since June. They
had not lost seven of nine games since April, when they opened the
season with the worst start in franchise history, but they lost for
the seventh time in nine games on this trip. They have failed to
score more than four runs in all but one game of the trip.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a rotten time for things to cool off," Salmon said.</TE>
<TE>   The clubhouse attendants had put up plastic sheets Tuesday, to
protect the Angels' belongings from champagne showers in the event
they clinched. The attendants did not bother putting the plastic back
up Wednesday, and the Angels did not bother to take a lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Rangers took a 2-0 lead in the second inning on back-to-back
home runs from Hank Blalock and Alex Rodriguez (his 57th), but the
Angels tied the score on a run-scoring double by Benji Gil in the
fifth inning and a solo home run from Troy Glaus in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   In the eighth, Rafael Palmeiro snapped the tie with his 43rd
homer, a solo shot off reliever Scott Schoeneweis. Later in the
inning, phenom Francisco Rodriguez struck out Kevin Mench, tying
Nolan Ryan's franchise record by striking out his eighth consecutive
batter. But Rodriguez also hit Donnie Sadler to load the bases and
then walked Michael Young, forcing home the Rangers' final run. The
Angels scored one in the ninth on Brad Fullmer's RBI single but fell
one run short of victory and one victory short of the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have won 96 games, and outfielder Garret Anderson
scoffed at suggestions the Angels might qualify for the playoffs only
by the grace of other teams losing.</TE>
<TE>   "To say we went in through the back door," he said, "discredits
what we've done all year."</TE>
<TE>   But, if the Angels don't get in the playoff door at all, they will
be remembered not for the most victories in club history but for a
legendary collapse, in a franchise cursed with enough of them. The
Angels get their fifth consecutive chance to clinch today, and
they're running out of chances.</TE>

<HD>Disney Hires Bank for Attempted Sale</HD>

<DL>ARLINGTON, Texas</DL>
<LD>In the most significant expression of its determination to sell its
two money-losing sports teams, the Walt Disney Co. has retained a New
York investment bank to find buyers for the Angels and Mighty Ducks,
according to two sources familiar with the sales process.</LD>
<LD>   Even while engaging in on-again, off-again talks to sell the teams
over the past three years, Disney declined to hire an investment
bank, hoping that qualified buyers would come forward after reading
or hearing that the teams were on the market. The decision to retain
Lehman Brothers reflects in part an admission that Disney has been
unable to attract buyers it deems qualified and in part a corporate
urgency to sell non-essential assets at a time Disney stock has
plunged to eight-year lows.</LD>
<LD>   Lehman is expected to market the teams aggressively, separately
and together, soliciting potential investors and determining their
financial qualifications. Disney has pledged that, as a condition of
any sale, a buyer must agree to keep the team or teams in Anaheim.</LD>
<TE>   Paul Pressler, the Disney executive who oversees the Angels and
Ducks, could not be reached for comment Wednesday. Sal Galatioto, the
head of Lehman's sports finance group, declined to comment.</TE>

<TE>   While baseball writers vote for the major postseason awards,
including most valuable player and Cy Young, major league players
vote for the "Players' Choice Awards," under the auspices of their
union. The winners will be announced next month, but three finalists
in each category were announced Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The finalists for outstanding player in the American League did
not include the Angels' Garret Anderson but did include Alex
Rodriguez of the Texas Rangers, Alfonso Soriano of the New York
Yankees and Miguel Tejada of the Oakland Athletics. Tim Salmon was a
finalist for comeback player of the year, along with Ruben Sierra of
the Seattle Mariners and David Wells of the Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While the Angels respect Aaron Sele's work in rehabilitating his
partially torn rotator cuff over the past five weeks, they do not
plan to use him during this final week of the season or during the
first round of the playoffs. He will continue his work, however, so
that the Angels can consider him for a possible start should they
advance to the league championship series.</TE>
<TE>   Sele said he would be "disappointed" if he did not get to pitch
again this season.</TE>
<TE>   "Disappointed isn't a negative thing," he said. "You have to look
at the big picture."</TE>

<TE>   Update--With the Angels still mathematically alive in the race for
the division title, Manager Mike Scioscia opted to start Lackey
today. Jarrod Washburn starts Friday, but his outing could be
shortened, because he is scheduled to pitch the first game of the
playoffs on three days' rest. Kevin Appier, slated for the second
game of the playoffs, starts Saturday. The Angels' weekend series
against Seattle is sold out.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Although it wasn't listed in morning newspapers, Wednesday night's
game was televised by Fox Sports Net because the Angels had not yet
clinched a playoff berth. Jay Lucas, the Angels' director of
broadcasting, said the team and Fox Sports Net weren't able to
finalize the logistics until Wednesday morning. Lucas said ESPN's
contract with baseball would not allow Channel 9 to televise
Wednesday night's game because it is an over-the-air station. Today's
game is also on Fox Sports Net.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Milwaukee Brewers, nearing the completion of their worst season
in the 34-year history of the franchise, replaced team President
Wendy Selig-Prieb and General Manager Dean Taylor Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Ulice Payne, a managing partner in the law firm Foley &amp; Lardner,
takes over as team president, becoming the first black president of a
major league team. Former Texas general manager Doug Melvin replaces
Taylor.</LD>
<LD>   Bob DuPuy, baseball's chief operating officer and the longtime
lawyer for Commissioner Bud Selig, also is a partner at Foley &amp;
Lardner.</LD>
<TE>   Payne said he took the job to help the team and the city.</TE>
<TE>   While he says he doesn't have all the answers on how to fix the
team's problems, "I'm going to take this challenge quite seriously,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Payne, a former Marquette University basketball star, has no
baseball experience but is the chairman of the Bradley Center Board

<HD>When Do Rams Panic? How About Right Now</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What are we to make of the St. Louis Rams? Conventional wisdom
suggests they have no chance to repeat as NFC champions. Wrote Bernie
Miklasz after the Rams fell to 0-3 after losing Monday night against
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers:</LD>
<LD>   "The beautiful passing game: gone.</LD>
<LD>   "The stylish running game: gone.</LD>
<TE>   "The physical toughness: gone.</TE>
<TE>   "The mental toughness: gone.</TE>
<TE>   "The relentless hunger to be the best: gone.</TE>
<TE>   "The swagger: gone."</TE>
<TE>   That's a crying shame.</TE>
<TE>   More Rams: "Now would be a very good time for the St. Louis Rams
to panic," radio talk show host Jim Rome said. "They ought to jump on
that panic button with both feet and blast it with a sledgehammer
because they have fallen and they're not going to get back up. They
are done."</TE>
<TE>   Promise?</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who was the starting pitcher in the Angels' last
playoff game?</TE>
<TE>   B-a-a-a-d Albert: When former Baltimore Oriole and Cleveland
Indian grouch Albert Belle was arrested recently on charges of
driving under the influence of alcohol in Scottsdale, Ariz., he spent
the night in jail rather than pay for a taxi to take him home. Police
rules prohibit an intoxicated person from walking or driving home
after booking. Belle, who continues to receive a $13-million salary,
had $299 on him, according to the Baltimore Sun.</TE>
<TE>   But he waited until the next morning for a friend to pick him up
at the jail.</TE>
<TE>   League night: Ben McGrath in the New Yorker magazine on pro bowler
Pete Weber, who favors loud shirts, gold chains and wears sunglasses
indoors: "Around cameras, especially television cameras, Pete becomes
someone named P.D.W. [his initials]. P.D.W. isn't entirely unlike
Pete Weber, but, in the words of his alter ego, he's 'a little more
colorful.' He speaks in the third person: 'That's right, and it's Pee
Dee Dubya!' He taunts his opponents: 'You better bring it!' ...
P.D.W. acts more like a professional wrestler, in other words, than
like a bowler."</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't get it: Jon Saraceno of USA Today on Pete Rose: "Of
course, Pete being Pete, he keeps sticking it in baseball's ear,
trying to pressure the commissioner's office through public sentiment
and public-relations stunts. That [and making money] was the purpose
of Monday's non-MLB-sanctioned promotion, one night after the Reds'
official goodbye to Cinergy Field, an event from which Rose was
banned. Commissioners want to be liked. They don't like being shown
up, but there was Pete flexing his popularity muscle."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: John Candelaria, who gave up seven unearned runs in
3 2/3 innings of the Angels' 8-1 loss to the Boston Red Sox in Game 7
of the 1986 American League championship series.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Bill Simmons of ESPN.com on the Red Sox: "Here in
Boston, we're like Lt. Kaffee interrogating Col. Jessup--we want
answers, we want the truth and we're not going to be denied [even if
it's risking a potential court martial]. A trite expression like
'They don't have it this year' simply doesn't fly. Not only has this
team gone 84 years without winning a World Series, New Englanders are
dying every day without having seen the Red Sox win a championship in
their lifetimes."</TE>

<LD>Ken Dorsey complained about Boston College to his teammates, his
coaches and referees. On Wednesday, the Miami quarterback went
public.</LD>
<LD>   Dorsey was hurried repeatedly, sacked once and knocked down
several times Saturday in No. 1 Miami's 38-6 victory over the Eagles.
Four days later, he said many of the hits were cheap shots.</LD>
<LD>   "They're not a bunch of choir boys," Dorsey said. "This was Boston
College's scheme: Run the ball the entire game to try to keep our
offense off the field. And when we're on the field, they're going to
blitz and try to hit me any way possible--late, on time, whatever.
And they'll twist a knee at the bottom of the pile. They'll do
anything."</LD>
<TE>   Then he added, "I just hate Boston College to be perfectly
honest."</TE>
<TE>   Boston College Coach Tom O'Brien said he had not heard any
complaints from Hurricane Coach Larry Coker.</TE>

<TE>   The Louisville Cardinals aren't where they thought they would be
heading into one of their biggest home games ever.</TE>
<TE>   Unranked and a disappointing 2-2, the two-time defending
Conference USA champions play host to fourth-ranked Florida State
(4-0) tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of us expected to be 4-0," Louisville quarterback Dave
Ragone said.</TE>
<TE>   Louisville has been looking forward to this game since a 31-0 loss
at Florida State in 2000. The Cardinals went 11-2 in 2001 and wanted
to show how much progress their program has made.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the last game where we're going to be able to prove to
the nation that we're a good team," defensive end Dewayne White said.
"We're going to play some conference teams that aren't going to be
ranked, so this is the big game on our schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "If we win, we'll be the talk of the town again."</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Deal Own Wild Card</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Jordan's two-out RBI single in ninth beats
Rockies, 3-2, and keeps L.A. barely alive in race for spot in
playoffs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Do you believe in miracles? If you're a Dodger fan, you better,
because it's going to take nothing short of a divine act, something
of the supernatural variety, for your team to reach the playoffs this
season.</LD>
<LD>   Something like the bottom of the ninth inning Wednesday night.
Times four.</LD>
<LD>   Trailing by a run and facing one of baseball's best closers, the
Dodgers rallied to pull out a dramatic 3-2 victory over the Colorado
Rockies before 28,189 at Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   Marquis Grissom had an RBI double and Brian Jordan hit a two-out
RBI single during the rally.</TE>
<TE>   Tempering the Dodger celebration, however, was San Francisco's 6-0
win over the San Diego Padres, which kept the Giants three games
ahead of the Dodgers in the National League wild-card race with four
games remaining.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco reduced its magic number for clinching a playoff
berth to two, and the Giants, who have won 22 of 30 games, moved
within two games of slumping Arizona in the NL West and have now set
their sights on a division title.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers were eliminated from the division race with an
uninspiring 1-0 loss to the Rockies on Tuesday night, but they were
finally able to break through and put a little pressure on the Giants
Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great game for us to win," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said.
"I know it's late, I know our heartbeat is faint, but we're still
breathing."</TE>
<TE>   Their offense coughed and wheezed for the first eight innings
Wednesday--the Dodgers managed only one run, on Jordan's RBI
fielder's choice in the first, and advanced only one runner to third
base over the next seven innings.</TE>
<TE>   Then Colorado closer Jose Jimenez, who had converted 41 of 46 save
opportunities, took the mound with a 2-1 lead in the ninth and was
promptly greeted by Alex Cora's leadoff single to right-center.</TE>
<TE>   Seldom-used utility player Jeff Reboulet dropped a perfect
pinch-hit sacrifice bunt, advancing Cora to second, and Grissom,
whose two-run single in the ninth inning gave the Dodgers a 5-3
victory over San Diego on Saturday night, lined a double just inside
the first base bag and into right field to score Cora for a 2-2 tie.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Lo Duca flied to right for the second out, and Shawn Green
was intentionally walked. Jordan, after fouling off a 2-2 pitch,
poked a single to center to easily score Grissom with the winning
run.</TE>
<TE>   "Miracles can happen, you never know," Jordan said. "As soon as
the game was over, I was running off the field saying, 'We've still
got a pulse.' "</TE>
<TE>   Jordan has been the heart of the Dodger team this month, with an
NL-leading 26 RBIs in September, and when the Rockies walked Green in
the ninth, Jordan made them pay.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm challenged more in September," said Jordan, who hit behind
Mark McGwire in St. Louis and Chipper Jones in Atlanta. "In the past,
it's been Jones and McGwire and now it's Green. I know they don't
want those guys to beat them. They put it on my shoulders, and I love
the challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Closer Eric Gagne, who struck out three of four batters in the top
of the ninth, got the victory, capping a superb relief effort that
included two scoreless innings by Guillermo Mota and a scoreless
eighth by Paul Shuey.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers also got an excellent start by
reliever-turned-emergency-starter Giovanni Carrara, who gave up two
runs and four hits in five innings, striking out five and walking
one.</TE>
<TE>   "Tonight sums up a lot of the season," Tracy said. "When you talk
about character, this is a perfect example. To come up with two runs
in the ninth was huge. From an effort standpoint, just look at Jordan
sliding into first base in the first inning. He didn't have to do
that."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers played the first inning with the sense of urgency that
Jordan said was missing Tuesday night. Lo Duca reached on a one-out
infield single and took third on Green's single to left.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan followed with a one-hop smash to third baseman Todd Zeile,
who gloved it, spun and threw to second to start a potential double
play.</TE>
<TE>   But Green's slide forced second baseman Jose Ortiz to come far off
the bag on his pivot, giving Jordan just enough time to dive into
first before the throw, and Lo Duca scored for a 1-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   But the Rockies snuffed out any momentum the Dodgers gained by
scoring twice in the top of the second.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Perez's Winter Plans Concern Team</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After doubling his previous all-time high with 222 1/3 innings this
season, throwing 23 innings in spring training and about another 50
innings in winter ball--giving him some 295 innings in the past
year--it would seem the last thing Dodger left-hander Odalis Perez
needs this winter is to pitch again in his native Dominican Republic.</LD>
<LD>   But Perez plans to begin pitching for Estrella, the San Pedro de
Macoris-based team he has played with for six seasons, in December, a
decision the Dodgers are concerned about but can do nothing to stop.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a very delicate issue, and it's a no-win situation to say a
guy can't go home and pitch in his own country," Dodger Manager Jim
Tracy said. "So I'm not going to venture into that. They also have a
say-so in how much they'd like to pitch, and that's where you hope
sensible heads prevail. Moderation is the word. As brilliant a future
as he has, I would hate to see him jeopardize that if he goes off the
deep end with it."</LD>
<TE>   Perez, who is 15-10 with a 3.00 earned-run average, has discussed
his plans with Tracy, General Manager Dan Evans and Senior Vice
President Dave Wallace, who would like Perez to throw no more than 20
innings in four or five winter starts.</TE>
<TE>   They feel more comfortable with the decision knowing Mark Brewer,
the Dodgers' roving minor league pitching instructor, will be
Estrella's pitching coach this winter and will keep a close eye on
Perez, who missed most of 2000 after undergoing elbow reconstruction
surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't completely solidified our thoughts, but if he pitches,
it will be in extreme moderation," Evans said. "His focus has to be
on Vero Beach and repeating the year he had this year. We can't
prohibit him from pitching there, but we have to work with him to do
what's in his best interests."</TE>
<TE>   Perez, acquired from Atlanta in the Gary Sheffield trade last
January, believes pitching in the Dominican Republic last winter
helped prepare him for this season.</TE>
<TE>   "I learned how to challenge guys, and I became more consistent,"
Perez said. "Most of the guys in the Dominican are big leaguers, and
that helps you a lot."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Several Dodger officials, including Evans and Senior Vice
President Tom Lasorda, will travel to Ogden, Utah, today to announce
the Dodgers' new Class-A affiliate in the Pioneer League. The Dodgers
left Great Falls, Mont., for a new facility in Ogden.</TE>

<LD>The Dodgers aren't quite finished in 2002, but they already have
announced their 2003 schedule.</LD>
<LD>   They will open against Arizona at Phoenix with an afternoon game
Monday, March 31, with the home opener also against the Diamondbacks
on April 7.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers again will play six games against the Angels, but
instead of facing the rest of the AL West in interleague play, they
will take on four teams from the AL Central. However, they will not
play the division champion Minnesota Twins.</LD>
<TE>   The Kansas City Royals visit Dodger Stadium for the first time
June 3-5, followed by the Chicago White Sox (June 6-8). The White
Sox, who last faced the Dodgers in a non-spring training game during
the 1959 World Series, make their first trip to Dodger Stadium since
September 1965, when they played the Angels, who called Chavez Ravine
home from 1962-65.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers then make their inaugural visits to Detroit (June
10-12) to face the Tigers at Comerica Park and Cleveland (June 13-15)
for three games against the Indians at Jacobs Field.</TE>

<KH>Chris Dufresne ON COLLEGE FOOTBALL</KH>
<HD>Irish Making Something Out of Nothing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Notre Dame has the week off and that's a shame because anytime the
Irish burp it's news and anytime they're good it's good for college
football.</LD>
<LD>   Loathe them, love them, the Irish and their 4-0 start have been
the September story.</LD>
<LD>   The sidebar is how little Notre Dame actually has accomplished. It
defeated mediocre Maryland (without star back Bruce Perry), outlasted
pathetic Purdue (lost last weekend to Wake Forest), overcame
overrated Michigan (most recently a Big Ten-7 winner over Utah) and
squeezed out a miracle at Michigan State (California spanked the
Spartans at home by 24).</LD>
<TE>   Notre Dame might as easily be 1-3 with first-year Coach Tyrone
Willingham this week housed at an undisclosed location, but it
appears the Leprechaun has finally gotten off his (Vontez) Duff.</TE>
<TE>   The madcap, green-cap, recap: Gerome Sapp returned a fumble for a
touchdown in a 24-17 victory over Purdue on a play in which a
Boilermaker coughed up the ball without being touched. Michigan fans
are still apoplectic over Irish quarterback Carlyle Holiday's phantom
touchdown in a 25-23 victory and, last week, two Michigan State
defenders collided to allow Arnaz Battle to race 60 yards for the
winning score.</TE>
<TE>   "The difference is," Battle said after Saturday's game, "we used
to lose games like this."</TE>
<TE>   Bottom line: It doesn't matter how Notre Dame got here, Notre Dame
is here, and quite naturally leapfrogged to No. 10 in the national
polls this week by sheer power of its ageless star power--Mr.
DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Oregon State, which walloped Notre Dame two years ago
in the Fiesta Bowl, also is 4-0 and may still be a better team.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon State's four victories have earned it a poll boost to No.
23. Because it lacks jumper cables, Oregon State probably has
virtually no shot at making the bowl championship series national
title game even if it goes unbeaten.</TE>
<TE>   In case you haven't heard, Notre Dame is different.</TE>
<TE>   "They're the only team that captures the front page of multiple
national newspapers," Pat Haden, the former USC quarterback and now
an analyst for Notre Dame home games on NBC, said. "It's like the
Yankees."</TE>
<TE>   The only difference is the Yankees have to pay a luxury tax.</TE>
<TE>   At Notre Dame, as in the Bronx, the highs are lunar and the lows
subterranean.</TE>
<TE>   The play Notre Dame receives in good times is matched only by the
headlines posted when Irish eyes are crying, the reason the program
was so savaged last winter over the George O'Leary debacle.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been on virtually every college campus for football over the
last 20 years," Haden said, "and it's the most difficult football job
in the world, the demands are like no other job."</TE>
<TE>   There is nothing worse for football than indifference about Notre
Dame. When Notre Dame is on top, fans crawl out from green crevices,
television ratings soar and legends of detractors pray this is the
year Navy pulls off an upset.</TE>
<TE>   For those hell-bent against, a victory against a top-ranked Notre
Dame is always more satisfying than kicking a 5-6 dog around the
yard.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame's revival has an impact on the national landscape. It
makes Notre Dame's trip to Air Force on Oct. 19 a fascinating prelude
to Notre Dame's possibly epic Oct. 26 trip to Florida State, and
raises the face value of the annual USC-Notre Dame clash.</TE>
<TE>   How to explain Notre Dame's best start since 1993 is more
complicated.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of it has been good circumstance, some of it has been good
coaching," Haden said.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, just rearranging the office furniture helps.</TE>
<TE>   "Change is as good an explanation as anything else," Haden said of
the coaching switch, from Bob Davie to Willingham. "These are young
people. They got pulled down by the undertow of negativism around the
program. Last year was like the Bataan Death March, they were waiting
for something bad to happen."</TE>
<TE>   Haden, though, notes a distinct change of philosophy on defense.</TE>
<TE>   The Irish are playing much more zone defense than man-to-man and
jumping opposing receivers on their routes. With man coverage, which
former coach Davie preferred, cornerbacks often play with their backs
to the quarterback on coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Haden says the zone is one reason why Notre Dame already has seven
interceptions and why senior cornerback Shane Walton's four
interceptions in four games match his career total entering the
season.</TE>
<TE>   And while Haden thinks the Irish have received a few breaks, he
says success is a potent elixir.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a difference in the way you play when you're confident,"
Haden said. "From this point forward, they are a different team."</TE>
<TE>   Here's another reason Haden knows Notre Dame is back:</TE>
<TE>   "I have guys call me every Monday, the Golden Domers, objecting to
something I said on the air, kind of in a kidding way," Haden, the
ex-Trojan, said. "They're fired up. People are talking about them at
lunchtime again, they're on the news.</TE>
<TE>   "If you really love college football, even if you are kind of
neutral, or agnostic about who wins, I think it's a good thing."</TE>
<TE>   Add Domers</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame fans are hyperventilating over the prospects of being
7-0 headed to Florida State on Oct. 26, but Irish watchers had best
keep eyes glued to that Oct. 19 game at Air Force.</TE>
<TE>   The Falcons are 3-0 after last week's 23-21 victory over
California and appear to be on the triple-option rebound after last
year's 6-6 disappointment. Saturday's victory marked the first time
in school history Air Force has defeated a team from the Big Ten
(Northwestern) and the Pacific 10 (Cal) in the same season.</TE>
<TE>   Air Force Coach Fisher DeBerry has had only two losing seasons
since becoming coach in 1984 and has defeated Notre Dame three times.</TE>
<TE>   The last two Air Force-Notre Dame games have been overtime
thrillers, Air Force winning, 20-17, in 1996 and Notre Dame winning
in 2000, 34-31.</TE>
<TE>   Class Acts</TE>
<TE>   Need your faith in humanity restored in the wake of that ugly
father-and-son assault on a first base coach at Comiskey Park last
week?</TE>
<TE>   There could not have been a more civil sporting atmosphere than
last weekend's Air Force at California game at Berkeley. Cal fans
cheered Air Force players as they entered Memorial Stadium and sang
along with the Falcon Band as it played "Off We Go (Into the Wild
Blue Yonder)."</TE>
<TE>   The Cal athletic department paid tribute to the men and women of
Air Force who have dedicated their lives to military service.</TE>
<TE>   With talk of war in the news, and the Air Force a big part of
those plans, everyone seemed to understand the game's context.</TE>
<TE>   After Air Force held on for a 23-21 victory, DeBerry would say of
his players: "These guys are going to do a great job representing
your nation in the coming years."</TE>
<TE>   Air Force quarterback Chance Harridge, who led his team's victory
with three touchdown runs, said he felt the same way about Cal
players.</TE>
<TE>   "This is probably one of the classiest group of guys that I have
ever played against in my life," Harridge said. "There was no trash
talking and they would say things like 'good play, good hit, good
run' and they would try to help you up after the play."</TE>
<TE>   Hurry-Up Offense</TE>
<TE>   A lot of schools are hiding behind the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 as a reason why they can't
disclose player injuries without permission, when in fact injury
obfuscation has always been an important part of the game plan.
Despite HIPAA, reporting of injuries still varies widely from campus
to campus.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona Coach John Mackovic says full disclosure of injuries makes
the most sense for one reason: gambling. Mackovic says shutting off
public information only gives the advantage to illegal bookmakers and
those associated with organized crime, who will get their information
by whatever means necessary. "And they play for keeps," Mackovic
said.</TE>
<TE>   On the injury subject, here's the latest on Notre Dame quarterback
Holiday. "Carlyle has a shoulder injury," Willingham reported, "the
specifics of it I'm not going to discuss."</TE>
<TE>   It could end up a numbers crunch when Oklahoma hosts South Florida
in Norman on Saturday. Oklahoma has won more national titles (seven)
than South Florida has played seasons (six). The Bulls first fielded
a football team in 1997, moved to Division I-A in 2001 and will join
Conference USA in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the four schools involved in two potential national title
deciding games Oct. 12 are almost cinches to get there with their
present top-five rankings.</TE>
<TE>   No. 2 Oklahoma and No. 3 Texas are all but dialed in for their
annual Red River Shootout at Dallas. Oklahoma plays host to South
Florida, then plays at Missouri, while Texas plays at Tulane and then
plays host to Oklahoma State. We like Texas' chances this weekend.
The Longhorns own a 15-1-1 series record, nine of the victories
coming by shutout. Of course, no Longhorn fan over 105 years old will
forget the time Tulane beat Texas at Austin in 1908.</TE>
<TE>   No. 4 Florida State at No. 1 Miami, also scheduled for Oct. 12,
also should hold up. Miami will certainly be 5-0 going in with byes
the next two weeks (an open date followed by Connecticut), while
Florida State's path is complicated only slightly by consecutive
Thursday night games against Louisville and Clemson.</TE>
<TE>   The latest on Notre Dame and the BCS flap: The Irish need nine
victories or a top-12 finish to become eligible for one of two
at-large BCS berths, but the season-opening victory against Maryland
does not count toward that total because the Kickoff Classic is
considered an "exempt" game. The Irish could have scheduled a 13th
game but declined for philosophical reasons, and now will ask the BCS
commissioners to reconsider its case. It's hard to image the BCS
re-writing its rules in midseason, but never underestimate Notre
Dame's power of persuasion especially when you consider the financial
impact of having the Irish in a BCS game.</TE>

<LD>The way Jimmy O took to these tight turns in wiring the field nine
days ago in the Beau Brummel, you would have to think he poses
another elusive target in today's $50,000 Gateway to Glory Stakes.
While the gelding was very impressive in that race, now he's being
asked to stretch his speed over 1 1/16 miles, and he figures to have
a host of challengers hot on his trail.</LD>
<LD>   After missing in his first three attempts at Hollywood Park this
summer, Jimmy O was an instant success at Del Mar and romped home in
late July, then ran up against one of the early favorites for the
Breeders' Cup Juvenile in Vindication.</LD>
<LD>   Sent off at nearly 8-1 in the Beau Brummel at 6 1/2 furlongs, he
shook loose of plenty of other speed types to get the job done that
afternoon under Matt Garcia, who is back for an encore.</LD>
<TE>   Pat Valenzuela, fresh from taking the riding titles at Hollywood
Park and Del Mar, figures to attract plenty of attention as he makes
his first appearance at this meet aboard Manhattan Express from the
cozy rail slot.</TE>
<TE>   This colt is still a maiden after four starts, but he's coming off
a third at Del Mar and has distance experience. If they get carried
away on the front end, he could be the spoiler with a late kick.</TE>
<TE>   Pine For Java will be trying to rebound after coming up empty when
well backed in the Beau Brummel.</TE>
<TE>   The son of Pine Bluff never got into the spirit of things, but go
back a race and there he is finishing nicely for second at Del Mar,
five lengths clear of Jimmy O.</TE>
<TE>   The price should be better this time around.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Lil Bit Devilish 2. Saboya 3. George Bailey 4.
Nipper Nelly 5. Grand Visions 6. Archdiesis 7. Tioga Lake 8. Segovia
9. Correct Meow 10. Comstock King 11. Jimmy O 12. Tenma.</TE>

<HD>For Ruiz, Overtime Is His Prime Time</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Forward's winning goal gives Galaxy a 3-2 victory
over Kansas City in playoff opener.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A drenched, sweaty mess, Sigi Schmid was roaming the Rose Bowl field
late Wednesday night, dodging celebrating fans and teal and gold
confetti while searching for that someone special with whom to share
the moment.</LD>
<LD>   As the sea of television cameras parted, the Galaxy coach spotted
him, an exhausted Carlos Ruiz. The burly Schmid zeroed in on the
slight Ruiz, grabbed him by the shoulders and kissed him on the crown
of his head, the same body part that had just given the Galaxy a
dramatic, come-from-behind 3-2 overtime win over the Kansas City
Wizards in Game 1 of the first-round Major League Soccer playoff
series.</LD>
<LD>   "That's what he does," Schmid said of Riuz's penchant for the
spectacular. "He's always down there [around the net] sniffing
around. That's who he is."</LD>
<TE>   Ruiz's game-winning header, which was his second goal of the
night, came with one minute remaining in overtime, in the 99th
minute, off a left-footed Simon Elliott free kick from about 35 yards
out. Ruiz jostled his way free and outjumped the Wizard defense to
redirect the curling kick off the top of his head and into the left
corner of the net, past Kansas City's prone goalkeeper, Tony Meola,
and setting off the celebration among the crowd of 14,585.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a set piece that we work on in practice during the
week," Ruiz said. "I know that Simon usually goes for the far post on
that kick but this time he went for the first post and I was there
for it.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a distinct win for the team."</TE>
<TE>   It was almost a disappointing loss.</TE>
<TE>   The No. 1-seeded and Western Conference champion Galaxy, which won
six of its last seven league matches, came out flat against the No.
8-seeded Wizards and fell behind in the 25th minute.</TE>
<TE>   The Wizards, who won one of their last seven and usually play a
more deliberate game, forced the action in the early going and broke
through on the left foot of Preki.</TE>
<TE>   From the left sideline, Kansas City forward Chris Brown found the
Wizard midfielder in the middle of the field. The 39-year-old Preki
juked past Elliott, 28, and, with Alexi Lalas coming over a bit late,
the Wizard midfielder unleashed a true shot from 20 yards out past
Galaxy goalkeeper Kevin Hartman.</TE>
<TE>   It was Preki's fourth goal against the Galaxy this year.</TE>
<TE>   Then Kansas City began packing it in, moving its entire team in
front of the ball when the Galaxy held possession, a strategy that
frustrated the Galaxy mightily.</TE>
<TE>   The Wizards, though, cracked in the 60th minute. With Ruiz
dribbling at the top of the box, he was pushed to the ground by Nick
Garcia a foot inside the box.</TE>
<TE>   Referee Richard Heron awarded a penalty kick to the Galaxy, much
to the chagrin of Meola, who had not faced a penalty kick in league
play this year and cursed Heron long and loud.</TE>
<TE>   With the crowd rising to its feet, Ruiz fired to the upper-right
corner of the net.</TE>
<TE>   But 10 minutes later, the Galaxy seemed beaten again.</TE>
<TE>   That's when Brown headed in Chris Klein's corner kick on a broken
play in which Hartman fell to the ground after running into Galaxy
defender Ezra Hendrickson in the scrum.</TE>
<TE>   But as was the case all night, the Galaxy answered.</TE>
<TE>   With the Galaxy forcing the momentum in the 85th minute and the
ball bouncing around the perimeter of the box, Tyrone Marshall
attempted a bicycle kick from the left side. The ball skimmed off the
side of his right foot and toward the middle of the field.</TE>
<TE>   Cobi Jones was there and immediately pounced on the wayward ball,
firing from the top of the box and into the net, setting up Ruiz's
heroics in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Said Kansas City Coach Bob Gansler: "That's playoff soccer.
Entertaining for the fans and exciting for the players. Game 1, there
will be a Game 3."</TE>
<TE>   Only if the Wizards can get at least a tie Saturday at Arrowhead
Stadium in Game 2 of the series, in which teams earn three points for
a victory and one point for a tie.</TE>

<DL>SUTTON COLDFIELD, England</DL>
<LD>They've played the Ryder Cup 33 times since 1927 and it wasn't very
competitive until the composition of the teams was fundamentally
changed. The U.S. was 19-3 against Great Britain until 1979, when the
opposing team was expanded to include all of Europe.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, the U.S. is 7-4, but it had lost twice in a row until
winning the last Ryder Cup in 1999 at the Country Club in Brookline,
Mass.</LD>
<LD>   Many are familiar with Samuel Ryder, the golf-playing son of a
corn merchant from Manchester, England. There is no suitable
explanation to account for the dramatic leap from selling kernels of
corn to selling international amateur golf competition, just go with
it.</LD>
<TE>   The Ryder Cup trophy itself is only nine inches wide, from handle
to handle, and is 17 inches tall. It looks like something you could
chill wine in. The small figure on top of the trophy is Abe Mitchell,
who in addition to being Ryder's friend, was also his golf teacher
and a player on three Ryder Cup teams.</TE>
<TE>   So after Ryder got some money behind it, the event took off and
Sam got to see two of them played on his home soil.</TE>
<TE>   When Ryder died in 1936 at 77, he was buried with his five-iron.
It was probably fortunate they hadn't invented golf carts yet.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder's vision for the Ryder Cup was that it become a "small,
friendly lunch party."</TE>
<TE>   These days, it's a whole new ballgame. But that doesn't mean there
aren't some Ryder Cup factors you can count on.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, you could make a list of them and check them off one by
one when they happen this weekend at the Belfry. No fair saying it's
going to rain. That's way too easy.</TE>
<TE>   So here's the list:</TE>
<TE>   10 Sure Things</TE>
<TE>   at the Ryder Cup</TE>
<TE>   1. The clothes the players wear will be blown up into a big issue.
Look for the Europeans to stick with shades of brown and black and
the U.S. players to wear so much red, white and blue, you won't know
whether to salute them or run them up the flagpole.</TE>
<TE>   2. Somebody is going to figure out that there are way too many
names given to the site of the matches and it's best to leave a few
of them on the cutting room floor. For instance, this is how the name
of the course is written on the dais in the media interview room:
"The De Vere Belfry, Sutton Coldfield, North Warwickshire, England."
Presumably, all they left out was Europe, Northern Hemisphere, Earth,
Milky Way Galaxy.</TE>
<TE>   3. The Philip Walton-Howard Clark Factor. Who will it be this
time? This is pretty much a European phenomenon, the transformation
of a virtually nondescript player, whose main function is to even out
the rows on the team picture, into a hero for an instant. Walton and
Clark? Didn't they discover the Northwest Passage? No, Walton and
Clark won their singles matches on the last day at Oak Hill in 1995,
the two points Europe needed to win, 14 1/2--13 1/2. Neither are in
the pro game anymore. Early favorite to embody the Walton-Clark
Factor: Phillip Price, who has missed four cuts in his last seven
tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   4. Something bizarre will happen at the 10th hole, a par-four.
It's measured at 311 yards but may play longer because new tees have
been built, back and to the right. It's 262 yards to the front of the
green, but because the tee has been relocated, trees affect the line
to the hole and virtually every player in the field will lay up ...
or maybe not. Tiger Woods drove the hole with a three-wood in a
practice round. Not one player on either side likes the change,
mostly because it was a perfect match-play hole, with water front and
to the left, with any score from a two to a six possible. Why was it
changed? Speculation centers around Sam Torrance, who wanted to make
up an obvious advantage held by the United States' longer hitters.</TE>
<TE>   5. Someone will heckle Scott Hoch, whose face will turn crimson.</TE>
<TE>   6. No one will heckle Colin Montgomerie, whose face is naturally
crimson.</TE>
<TE>   7. Europe will take an early lead Friday and Saturday, and the
U.S. will be trailing, thus forced to come from behind when the
deciding singles matches begin Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   8. Someone will fail in his attempt to surpass the verbal
accomplishments of Jim Furyk, who managed to use the words
"ultimate," "pressure," "microscope" and "pinnacle" in an
introductory clause.</TE>
<TE>   9. Someone will complain about slow play. For the first time,
there is no practice putting permitted at the end of a hole. Even
though there is a policy against slow play in effect (three "bad
times" result in the loss of a hole), someone, let's say Bernhard
Langer, is going to run afoul of the law. It will cause a big stink
and strain the good will between captains Curtis Strange and
Torrance. In the end, all sides will again agree to play faster, if
not better.</TE>
<TE>   10. Civility will win out, the opposite of what happened at
Brookline. As Davis Love III said, "I think aside from a few,
isolated drunk fans, the Ryder Cup has been excellent."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, we'll see about that. But you've been warned.</TE>

<HD>Gore Would Get Lift From Another Win</HD>

<LD>Jason Gore enters the Buy.com Tour State Farm Open beginning today at
Empire Lakes Golf Course in Rancho Cucamonga seeking much more than
his third consecutive victory and PGA Tour playing privileges. He is
seeking history.</LD>
<LD>   Gore won Buy.com Tour events in Idaho and Oregon the last two
weeks, but a victory this weekend would make him the first to win
three consecutive Buy.com tournaments.</LD>
<LD>   Gore, who became the sixth player in the 13-year history of the
tour to win consecutive events, jumped from No. 64 to No. 4 on the
season money list over the last two weeks. The top 15 earn an
automatic exemption for the 2003 PGA Tour and Gore, with $230,472 in
earnings, is a comfortable $95,196 ahead of No. 16 Jason Caron.</LD>
<TE>   Another victory, however, would get Gore on the big tour for the
final five events this year. Any player winning three Buy.com Tour
events in one season earns an immediate bump, known on tour as a
"battlefield promotion." Only Chris Smith in 1997 and Heath Slocum
and Chad Campbell last year have done it.</TE>
<TE>   Gore, who led Pepperdine to the 1997 NCAA championship, made it
through PGA Tour qualifying in 2000 and played a full schedule in
2001. He finished 178th on the money list and lost his card.</TE>

<LD>   Livingston said she plans to make a choice after visiting UC Santa
Barbara next weekend. She already has visited Pepperdine and UCLA.</LD>

Hawaii.</LD>
<TE>   Dominique Lestrapes of Laguna Hills, a second baseman who batted
.559 last season, has committed to Washington for softball.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Renno, an outfielder from Chatsworth, has committed to Cal
State Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Smith, a receiver and safety from Woodland Hills Taft, said
he plans visits to Texas, Michigan, Notre Dame and Tennessee,
although USC and UCLA remain possible choices.</TE>
<TE>   Defensive tackle Matthew Malele of Carson has scheduled a trip to
Tennessee in November. He visited Stanford before the season.</TE>
<TE>   Minnie Choi, a golfer at Fountain Valley, has committed to UC
Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Arianna Criscione, a national team age-group soccer goalkeeper who

<LD>Gino Riney, a senior guard at Van Nuys Grant High who averaged 29.1
points last season, has pleaded not guilty to two counts of
automobile theft with a firearm and is being held in Sylmar Juvenile
Hall, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Dan Feldstern.</LD>
<LD>   Grant High basketball Coach Howard Levine said Riney was arrested
Sept. 13 for alleged incidents that took place on April 21 and June
28 in the San Fernando Valley..</LD>
<LD>   "He claims he's innocent and we're hopeful," Levine said. "It
seems so unlike him."</LD>
<TE>   A hearing is scheduled next month to determine whether Riney, 17,
will be prosecuted as a juvenile or adult.</TE>

<TE>   Dorsey will have to forfeit its season-opening victory over Sylmar
because school officials did not turn in transfer paperwork on one of
its players to the City Section before the Sept. 13 game.</TE>
<TE>   The player, a transfer from Playa del Rey St. Bernard, has been at
Dorsey since the summer and participated in the victory. City Section
administrator Jeff Halpern confirmed that he did not receive the
California Interscholastic Federation Form 510 until after the game.</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey Coach Paul Knox said that dealing with a change in athletic
directors and a fire in the athletic offices over the summer may have
contributed to the oversight.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Stephens</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kyle Weatherspoon lost his appeal before the Southern Section's
executive council on Wednesday and is ineligible to play football for
Lynwood.</TE>
<TE>   An all-league player last year at Paramount, Weatherspoon was
ruled ineligible by San Gabriel Valley League principals because of
undue influence surrounding his transfer.</TE>
<TE>   It is a blow to Lynwood (1-1), which was 3-6 last season.
Weatherspoon would have started at receiver and cornerback as well as
returned punts and kickoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Second-year Coach Jeff Jenkins said Weatherspoon would have been
the featured player in the offense. Jenkins said that despite the
ineligibility, Weatherspoon will not return to Paramount, which was
3-6-1 last season.</TE>

<TE>   Erick Maldonado of Chino Don Lugo is expected to run in the
Division I race of the Stanford Invitational after missing the Irvine
Woodbridge Invitational last Saturday because of a leg injury.</TE>
<TE>   Maldonado, the defending state Division I champion, set a course
record in winning the Division I race of the Bronco Invitational in
Chino on Sept. 14. But he missed eight days of training after that
because of soreness in a tendon that runs from his left knee to his
hip.</TE>

<TE>   Al Gragnano has stepped down as boys' and girls' golf coach at Los
Alamitos after retiring from teaching at the school, he said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Gragnano has also coached baseball, basketball, cross-country,
track, softball and football during his 34 years at Los Alamitos.
John Haygood replaces Gragnano as coach of both golf teams.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>INTERSECTIONAL</LD>
<LD>   Manhattan Beach Mira Costa (2-0) vs. Wilmington Banning (2-0) at
Gardena High, 7 p.m., Friday</LD>
<LD>   Can Mira Costa stop Banning's veer offense? Last week, Banning
running backs A.J. Tuitele and Patrick Perry combined for 314 yards
rushing in a 28-7 victory over North Hollywood. Mira Costa, ranked
No. 9 by The Times, counters with Michael Okwo, an inside linebacker
who has three sacks and 13 tackles and is drawing attention from
UCLA, USC, Stanford and Oregon State. Okwo, who also plays running
back, rushed for 187 yards and a touchdown in 15 carries in last
week's 35-6 victory over Warren.</LD>
<TE>   Mike Bresnahan</TE>
<TE>   *Santa Monica (1-1) at Venice (2-0), 7 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   Big-play receivers B.J. Vickers and Antwuan Giddens have made
their marks in Venice's spread offense, guided by quarterback Eddie
Miller (21 of 35 passing for 497 yards and three touchdowns with
three interceptions). The versatile Vickers has averaged 23 yards a
catch in nine receptions. He also averages more than 16 yards a carry
in occasional rushing attempts, plays free safety and returns
kickoffs. Giddens has seven receptions for an average of 27.1 yards.
Santa Monica won the Division X title last year, handling Venice,
47-27, in a regular-season game. But the Vikings, now in Division IV,
lost 25 seniors from that team. Ricky Johnson, a three-year reserve,
is at quarterback and Adrian Gonzalez gained 100 yards while leading
Santa Monica to a 20-9 victory over Palisades last week.</TE>
<TE>   Lauren Peterson</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Dorsey (1-1) vs. Santa Margarita (2-0) at Saddleback College,
7:30 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey's record slipped to 1-1 this week when the Dons learned
they would have to forfeit their season-opening victory over Sylmar
for using an ineligible player. But that makes beating Dorsey no less
formidable a task for No. 7 Santa Margarita, which has ridden the
running of Ashton White (270 yards, three touchdowns) to victories
over Orange El Modena and Redlands. The Dons will rely on a cast of
playmakers that includes Jody Rucks, who rushed for 182 yards against
Sylmar, and Hakeem Washington, who sealed a 28-24 victory over
Oakland McClymonds last week when he made a late interception at the
Dorsey five-yard line.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Bolch</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SOUTHERN SECTION</TE>
<TE>   Riverside North (1-1) vs. Santa Ana Mater Dei (1-1) at Santa Ana
Stadium, 7, tonight</TE>
<TE>   North fell out of The Times' rankings this week after losing to
Fontana Kaiser, 24-21, in a game that could have gone either way. The
Huskies could return in a big way by knocking off No. 17 Mater Dei,
which looked much better last week against Mission Viejo than it did
in its opener against Orange Lutheran. Quarterback Jason Forcier was
nearly unstoppable last week during a late 80-yard scoring drive that
brought the Monarchs to within two points in the 21-19 loss. North
has a balanced offense led by quarterback Dion Morton (311 yards
passing and two touchdowns) and running back Joshua Barnett (188
yards and four touchdowns rushing, 76 yards receiving).</TE>
<TE>   Ben Bolch</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hacienda Heights Los Altos (2-0) at La Mirada (1-1), 7:30 p.m.,
Friday</TE>
<TE>   La Mirada ended Los Altos' 23-game winning streak last season with
its huge special teams advantage--it returned a kickoff for a
touchdown; Los Altos missed an extra-point and field-goal attempt--in
a 14-13 victory. La Mirada is coming off a mistake-filled 35-7 loss
to Crenshaw, and must control the ball with running back Garrett
Busk. Los Altos' strength is its defense, but its offense has scored
91 points in two games.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Henderson</TE>
<TE>   *Inglewood (2-0) at Compton Dominguez (1-1), 7:30 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   Expect a track meet in this game that features two teams loaded
with speed. Brian Flowers, Paul McCalope and Solomon Jones all have
more than 100 rushing yards in Inglewood's double-wing offense and
quarterback Troy Durk has 205. Dominguez counters with mobile
quarterback Anthony Wheat, who played receiver last season and is the
safety. The Dominguez defense stifled Tustin in a 20-12 victory last
week.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Yoon</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CITY SECTION</TE>
<TE>   San Pedro (1-1) at L.A. Fremont (2-0), 7 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   Fremont scored easy victories over Hamilton and Bell, but Coach
Pete Duffy realizes the Pathfinders have a much tougher test this
week. "I want us to play exceptionally well and if we do what we're
supposed to do, it can be a big win for us," Duffy said. "But if the
ball bounces their way a couple of times and they come out on the
other end, it's not the end of the world." Injuries have racked
Fremont. Linebacker John Thompson is out six weeks because of a
pinched nerve in his neck and offensive tackle DeJuan Clark is
questionable because of a leg injury. Star receiver Mark Bradford has
battled ankle injuries since the start of fall practice.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After his team had polished off Kahuku of Hawaii Saturday night in
Honolulu, Long Beach Poly High Coach Raul Lara settled into a seat at
Aloha Stadium alongside other Jackrabbit coaches and players to scout
an opponent they would be meeting in three weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Concord De La Salle sparkled in in a 31-21 defeat of Honolulu St.
Louis to stretch its national-record winning streak to 127 games.
That was expected.</LD>
<LD>   What wasn't expected was the way Poly manhandled Kahuku, the
two-time defending state champions, 42-16, earlier in the evening.</LD>
<TE>   Poly running back Lorenzo Bursey scored three touchdowns,
quarterback Leon Jackson looked crisp in passing for 172 yards, and
receiver Derrick Jones scored on a 56-yard reception and an 82-yard
kickoff return.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew our kids were ready," Lara said. "But man, the way they
performed.... It was like, wow!"</TE>
<TE>   The big showing upped the interest in the rematch between Poly
(2-0) and De La Salle (2-0) at 2 p.m. on Oct. 12 at California. The
Spartans won last year's game, 29-15, in a matchup of teams widely
regarded as Nos. 1 and 2 in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   De La Salle began this season as the top-ranked team in most
national polls, but Poly dropped a few notches after graduating the
"big five" of running back Hershel Dennis, tight end Marcedes Lewis,
defensive back Darnell Bing and linemen Winston Justice and Manuel
Wright.</TE>
<TE>   Lara contends that the departure of the five players strengthened
his team.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, everyone talked about the 'Big 5,' " he said. "It
didn't give us a lot of dissension, but everyone depended on the
five. This year, nobody's depending on anyone to pull us out. It's a
team thing."</TE>
<TE>   Said Jones: "No one is going to get big-headed. You can't single
anyone out because it's a team effort."</TE>
<TE>   Another factor that may bode well for the Jackrabbits, Lara said,
is that they are ahead of where they were this time last season.
Lara, a second-year coach, attributed the increased preparedness to
spending his first full off-season with his charges.</TE>
<TE>   "It's obvious, especially the way we executed on offense the first
two games," Lara said, "that the off-season helped us."</TE>
<TE>   The Jackrabbits will need every intangible on their side to topple
De La Salle, at least judging from Lara's assessment of the Spartans.</TE>
<TE>   "They execute very well and they come off the ball really well.
It's just like last year," he said. "The only difference is that they
had a known quarterback last year. This quarterback is good but isn't
getting hype."</TE>
<TE>   Cecil Britt completed six of 10 passes for 116 yards against St.
Louis. Britt replaced Matt Gutierrez, who is at Michigan. Running
back Maurice Drew, who scored four touchdowns last year in the
Spartans' victory over the Jackrabbits, gained 125 yards and scored a
touchdown in 19 carries against St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Poly is trying to schedule a game against Kahuku next season, this
time in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Funny thing is, Kahuku didn't want to play Poly this season.</TE>
<TE>   The two-time defending state champion originally coveted what they
considered the bigger challenge: playing De La Salle. But De La Salle
officials nixed those plans because they didn't want to go up against
a team that had already played three games, said Keith Amemiya,
executive director of the Hawaii High School Athletic Assn.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach Edison, off to its worst start since 1987, when
it began the season 0-5, couldn't have timed its bye week more
perfectly. The Chargers (1-2) have lost four starters to knee
injuries and need time to bring their replacements up to speed in
practice.</TE>
<TE>   The string of injuries started during preseason conditioning, when
senior strong safety Dayne Acosta suffered a torn anterior cruciate
ligament. In Edison's second game, against San Clemente, junior
offensive guard Tua Fuga tore his ACL. And last week against Mission
Viejo Capistrano Valley, senior offensive guard Robert Barna
dislocated his kneecap and senior linebacker Bubba Reynolds suffered
a torn posterior cruciate ligament.</TE>
<TE>   While Fuga is out for the season, Barna is expected to return in
two to three weeks. Reynolds, a team captain, and Acosta probably
won't be back for at least a month.</TE>
<TE>   "We're kind of in shock right now," Edison Coach Dave White said.
"We're playing a few sophomores and a lot of juniors. We're going to
make mistakes, but we've got to try to get better."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Loyola senior quarterback Adam Gonzalez will start
Friday against Pasadena Muir even though he hasn't fully recovered
from a shoulder injury suffered last week in the first quarter of a
35-20 victory over Harbor City Narbonne.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez, whose throwing motion was adversely affected by the
injury, had two passes intercepted before being replaced by junior
Scott Deke in the second quarter. Gonzalez came back in the second
half but had another pass picked off and sat out the remainder of the
game.</TE>
<TE>   "He's such a competitor," Loyola Coach Steve Grady said of
Gonzalez, "but he's got to recognize when he's not at full strength."</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez will likely play cornerback if he is unable to go at
quarterback, Grady said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Moreno Valley and North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake are 2-0 for the
first time since the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Moreno Valley defeated Moreno Valley Rancho Verde, 20-10, last
week, giving the Vikings two victories in their first two games for
the first time since 1996. The Vikings, who won once last season, are
led by Sean Brown, who has rushed for more than 100 yards in each
game.</TE>
<TE>   Harvard-Westlake improved to 2-0 for the first time since 1994
under its first-year coach, Greg Gonzalez, with a 35-10 victory over
Rosemead Bosco Tech.</TE>

<LD>TERRANCE FLOURNOY</LD>
<LD>   School: Los Angeles Cathedral * Position: Running back * Height:
5-10 * Weight: 178</LD>
<LD>   Good things happen when Terrance Flournoy touches the football.</LD>
<TE>   The freshman has averaged 24.7 yards per carry and scored three
touchdowns this season in only 11 rushing attempts--as a third-string
running back for Cathedral High.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't act like a 14-year-old," said Coach Kevin Pearson. "As
soon as I told him he was playing, he never quivered or looked at me
funny. He's going to be a special kid."</TE>
<TE>   Flournoy probably would have played junior varsity football this
season had Cathedral's starting fullback and tailback not transferred
to Gardena Serra. When the season started, Flournoy was still third
on the depth chart, behind junior Devin Martinez and senior Chris
Flores.</TE>
<TE>   But after rushing for 272 yards in the Phantoms' first two
games--blowout victories over L.A. Marshall and L.A.
Belmont--Flournoy has been promoted to starter, alongside Martinez.
Flournoy could supplant Martinez as the first-string tailback as the
season progresses, Pearson said, to allow Martinez to concentrate on
playing linebacker.</TE>
<TE>   "He's coming along faster than expected," Pearson said. "He's very
intelligent, picking up blitzes and blocking linebackers real well."</TE>
<TE>   Credit Derwin Henderson of the Los Angeles Police Department for
much of Flournoy's success. Henderson arrested Flournoy when he was a
9-year-old delinquent, then agreed to the pleas of the boy's mother
to take him in and set him straight. Flournoy still sees his mother
on weekends but is quick to acknowledge that it was Henderson who
steered him in the right direction.</TE>
<TE>   "He makes sure I do good in school," Flournoy said. "If it wasn't
for him, I wouldn't do nothing. I'd probably be one of those thugs."</TE>

<HD>Conflicting Matches Not a Problem</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Different fan bases allow showcase events to be
played simultaneously at Coliseum and Rose Bowl.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Soccer promoter Eduardo Aguirre was sitting in the Coliseum press
box, talking about the future of the game in the United States. This
path of discussion, naturally, led to Major League Soccer and the
Anschutz Entertainment Group.</LD>
<LD>   "The only way the club teams are going to grow is if they change
the structure of the MLS," Aguirre said. "Where's the competition?
You have the Anschutz Group that owns 60% of the teams. How can you
create competition?"</LD>
<LD>   Well, there was competition Wednesday night.</LD>
<TE>   There were three soccer matches of significance played within 15
miles of one another, jammed into the window of about 4 1/2 hours.</TE>
<TE>   Two were games of the Hexagonal Rumbo, a qualifier for La Copa
Libertadores event, and the other was the Galaxy's opener of a
first-round MLS playoff series.</TE>
<TE>   At the Coliseum, Morelia defeated Cruz Azul, 1-0, on a goal by
striker Jose Antonio Noriega in the 90th minute.</TE>
<TE>   In the second match of the doubleheader, Toluca defeated Pachuca,
2-0, taking a 1-0 halftime lead on Sergio Ponce's goal in the 28th
minute.</TE>
<TE>   Pachuca, in fact, had a conflict Wednesday, fielding its B squad.
The first team of Pachuca lost to Club America, 3-0, in a Mexican
League match at Mexico City.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time the Galaxy opened the playoffs by defeating the
Kansas City Wizards, 3-2, at the Rose Bowl. As for the other key
result: Galaxy attendance--14,585. Coliseum attendance--7,236.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from both venues downplayed having conflicting matches.
Promoters of the pre-Libertadores event sought permission months ago
for these dates at the Coliseum, long before the Galaxy secured
home-field advantage for the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy felt that attendance would not be impacted because the
team does not have a Mexican player on the squad.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's unfortunate to have fans divided that way because we
should be able to help each other," said Rigo Cervantez, the Galaxy's
manager of Hispanic public relations.</TE>
<TE>   "Soccer needs all the help in the world. But I truly believe our
most loyal fans, the Central American fans and the Anglo fans, will
be here, as Mexican fans will be at the Coliseum. So they will have
their fans and we will have our fans."</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre, the president of the rights holding company to the
Hexagonal Rumbo, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe it should be very different, not saying there won't be
some mix there," he said. "I believe that the fan base the Galaxy has
is a totally different group of people than what we have for these
Mexican teams. I might be wrong--this has never happened.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think this is competition. I think it's good for the city
to be able to have two soccer games at the same time. I really don't
believe there should be any winners or losers as far as fan base
because again, they're different. You cannot compare one to the
other. But I believe the city is the one who is benefiting.</TE>
<TE>   "In Mexico, I think we have five, six teams in Mexico City. I've
seen games, not only between two club teams in Mexico City, but there
were two games of club teams, plus the national team game, on the
same day."</TE>
<TE>   Even fans of Cruz Azul, who were occasional visitors to the Rose
Bowl and the Galaxy, did not seem to be bothered by conflicting
matches.</TE>
<TE>   "That's OK. If they win, it's better. But they've lost all the
time," said Maria Bates of Anaheim, speaking of the Galaxy's record
in championship matches.</TE>
<TE>   One teenager wanted to attend the Galaxy game, but family members
who were Toluca fans won the debate.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have gone," said Alex Cevrian of Los Angeles. "I think it
is [a shame] because it takes people away from the game. There should
have been some other time when they could have played."</TE>

<LD>Freddy Garcia scored on a 12-yard shot in the 81st minute Wednesday
night, giving the Columbus Crew a 2-1 victory over the San Jose
Earthquakes in the opener of their quarterfinal series in the MLS
playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   The Crew play host to the defending champions for Game 2 on
Saturday night. The first team to five points (three points for a
win, one for a tie) in the series advances.</LD>
<LD>   Jeff Cunningham, whose speed caused problems for the Earthquakes
all night at San Jose, crossed the ball from the right flank past
teammate Brian McBride to the onrushing Garcia on the left side. San
Jose goalkeeper Joe Cannon got a hand on Garcia's shot but could only
deflect the ball into the roof of his net.</LD>
<TE>   In the 38th minute, the Crew opened the scoring on a goal by
midfielder Edson Buddle.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 4, Colorado 2--Jason Kreis scored the go-ahead goal as the
Burn won at Dallas in the first game of the series.</TE>
<TE>   Kreis slipped a shot into a wide-open net in the 49th minute as
the Burn broke a 1-1 tie. Kreis' goal, scored off a pass from Ronnie
O'Brien, was the first of three goals the Burn scored in the second
half.</TE>

<HD>Moss Won't Face Felony Charges</HD>
<DH>Jurisprudence: Incident with traffic officer results in
misdemeanor counts for Viking star.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Randy Moss walked out of jail whistling, charged with two
misdemeanors instead of a possible felony for allegedly pushing a
traffic officer a half-block with his car.</LD>
<LD>   The Minnesota Viking star receiver won't even miss a game.</LD>
<LD>   Moss was released Wednesday from the Hennepin County jail after
spending the night.</LD>
<TE>   He was charged with careless driving and failure to obey a traffic
officer.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they found a small quantity of marijuana in Moss' car,
an amount that would qualify as a petty misdemeanor, but no charge
was immediately filed.</TE>
<TE>   Moss had been arrested on suspicion of assault with a dangerous
weapon, a felony.</TE>
<TE>   He whistled as he left jail and walked through a pack of
reporters.</TE>
<TE>   "You'll hear my side later," Moss said. "I was treated bad."</TE>
<TE>   After retrieving some belongings from a van, he left in a car.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota Coach Mike Tice said Moss will start Sunday against the
Seattle Seahawks but will be disciplined for missing part of
Wednesday's practice. He did not reveal the discipline.</TE>
<TE>   Allowing Moss to play, Tice said, is "an appropriate course of
action" based on the lesser charges.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still disappointed," Tice said. "This doesn't change the fact
that we've been dealing with this for the last 24 hours, that I slept
very little last night."</TE>
<TE>   Moss wasn't available to reporters at the team's practice
facility. Tice said Moss apologized to his teammates and coaches
after practice, and would make a statement today.</TE>
<TE>   Moss wound up in jail after his run-in with the traffic officer
during Tuesday evening rush hour on a downtown Minneapolis street.</TE>
<TE>   The officer stepped in front of Moss' car to stop him from making
an illegal turn.</TE>
<TE>   Moss used his car to slowly push her along the street, stopping
when she fell to the ground, police spokeswoman Cyndi Barrington
said.</TE>
<TE>   Barrington said 27-year-old Amy Zaccardi--a city employee but not
a police officer--was not seriously hurt. One witness called the
situation "surreal."</TE>
<TE>   Another said he didn't believe Moss intended to hurt Zaccardi.</TE>
<TE>   County prosecutor Amy Klobuchar said the case was turned over to
the city for lesser charges because there wasn't enough evidence to
prove Moss intended to hurt the officer.</TE>
<TE>   Moss could get 90 days in jail and a $1,000 fine on each of the
misdemeanors if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   A felony assault conviction might have meant 21 months in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Under NFL rules, Moss will undergo mandatory "evaluation" because
he was charged.</TE>
<TE>   Any disciplinary action would follow a conviction or guilty plea.</TE>

<LD>Lamond Murray wanted out, and the Cleveland Cavaliers granted the
disgruntled forward his wish Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Murray, who had been asking the team to trade him for months, was
dealt along with a second-round draft pick to the Toronto Raptors for
center Michael Stewart and a future first-round pick.</LD>
<LD>   "The situation in Cleveland was, we weren't winning a lot," he
said. "Moving on was important for me."</LD>
<TE>   A former Clipper, Murray, 30, was Cleveland's leading scorer last
season, averaging a career-high 16.6 points.</TE>
<TE>   Murray has four years left on a seven-year, $29-million contract.</TE>

Jordan, 39, said he planned to fulfill the contract if he was
physically able.</TE>

the league's plan to withhold money from high-spending teams amounted

<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   FBI evidence response team members who searched the boat of
missing former NBA player Bison Dele in Tahiti reported to superiors
in San Francisco on Wednesday that they found no proof of a bullet
hole and no definite blood stains. Andrew Black, an FBI spokesman,
refused to provide details of the FBI investigators' conference,
except to note, "We continue to try to piece together what led to
these individuals' disappearances."</TE>
<TE>   A source close to the case said "hyper-sensitive blood chemistry
tests" may eventually reveal that some small bits of evidence had
blood on them, but, for now, the findings are "inconsistent with what
some French authorities had said." Dele, his girlfriend, Serena
Karlan, and boat captain Bertrand Saldo have been missing since early
July. French police officials have identified Dele's brother, Miles
Dabord, as the leading suspect, but Dabord is comatose in a Chula
Vista hospital after an apparent suicide attempt and his mother has
reported she has decided to remove him from life support soon.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, investigators in Tahiti halted their South Pacific sea
search for Dele, Karlan and Saldo on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   NASCAR suspended Jimmy Elledge, crew chief for Bobby Hamilton, for
this weekend's race at Kansas Speedway for violating probation and
fined him $5,000 for "unapproved air directional devices" found on
the car before qualifying at Dover last week. Greg Biffle is driving
the car while Hamilton recovers from an injury.</TE>

<HD>Rams' Faulk Is Back at Practice</HD>

<LD>Marshall Faulk practiced with the St. Louis Rams Wednesday, a sign
that the running back could be ready to face the Dallas Cowboys
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The Rams (0-3) didn't have any news on results of an exam on
Faulk's strained neck, however.</LD>
<LD>   Before practice, Coach Mike Martz said he was hopeful that team
doctors would clear Faulk.</LD>
<TE>   "He doesn't have any neurological problems in terms of numbness,
so they felt good it may not be a disk issue," Martz said.</TE>
<TE>   Faulk was injured when he was upended by Derrick Brooks during the
Rams' 26-14 loss to Tampa Bay Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Arizona quarterback Jake Plummer says he meant no disrespect to
Cardinal fans when he complained about booing during the team's 23-15
loss to San Diego Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   After the game, Plummer said he could not care less about what
fans shouted--only in much ruder terms.</TE>
<TE>   "When I said that ... I meant the boos, not the fans," Plummer
said Wednesday. "I appreciate every fan that's cheered for me and
will continue to cheer for me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Safety Pierson Prioleau signed a $3-million, three-year extension
with Buffalo....Kansas City linebacker Lew Bush was cited and
arrested early Wednesday on suspicion of drunken driving. He was
released on $600 bond.</TE>

<KH>KING/DUCK REPORT</KH>
<HD>Power Play Still a Priority</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Behind Ziggy Palffy's 15 power-play goals last season, the Kings were
the NHL's best when playing with a man advantage. With the core
power-play players back, the Kings expect more of the same this
season, but they will have to do it without assistant Dave Tippett,
now the head coach of the Dallas Stars.</LD>
<LD>   Defenseman Mathieu Schneider said new power-play coach John Van
Boxmeer's biggest challenge will be finding the right combination for
the Kings' second unit.</LD>
<LD>   "You can see that [the Kings' coaching staff] has been trying to
get a good look at the young players and see how they work on the
power play," Schneider said before the Kings' 3-2 exhibition loss to
Colorado at Denver on Wednesday night. "We haven't all worked
together yet and you can't really tell how we're going to be this
season until we play with a full lineup against a team playing with
its first lineup.</LD>
<TE>   "It's still kind of difficult to sense what our power play is
going to be like once the regular season starts, but if you look at
our main guys up front in Ally [Jason Allison], Ziggy and [Adam]
Deadmarsh, you know we're going to be a force. The key is getting a
second unit that can score. That will put us over the top and take us
to the next level."</TE>
<TE>   With nearly two weeks to go before the Kings' regular-season
opener, it's still uncertain which players will play on the different
power-play lines.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Andy Murray typically splits up his forwards to give his top
power-play lines a mixture of youth and experience early in the
regular season.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot is going to depend on how the young guys develop,"
Schneider said. "Because there are so many games in the regular
season, there are going to be nights when your top unit is off.
That's why we need our second unit to be strong.... The biggest thing
about your power play is consistency. You want it working night in
and night out because two power-play goals could be the difference
between a first-place team and a ninth-place team.</TE>
<TE>   "We also know that even when you're not scoring power-play goals,
you still need your special teams to be able to control momentum the
way the game is played now. That's how we played last season."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings' Felix Potvin looked sharp while stopping 34 shots in
Wednesday's loss, but Brett Clark and Alex Tanguay scored power-play
goals for the Avalanche in the third period.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Sakic added a goal and an assist for Colorado. Philippe Sauve
stopped 25 shots for the Avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   Schneider and Alexander Frolov scored for the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   First-year Mighty Duck Coach Mike Babcock had a group of players
lined up to perform a drill to kick off Wednesday afternoon's
practice when he was reminded again to be patient with talented
Russian rookie Stanislav Chistov.</TE>
<TE>   Despite having team leaders Paul Kariya and Adam Oates on the ice,
the Ducks' workout did not get off to a smooth start because Chistov
didn't quite understand what to do while skating on the No. 1 line.</TE>
<TE>   "Practice is tougher for him because he doesn't necessarily
understand the drill or the language," Babcock said about Chistov,
Anaheim's No. 1 draft pick in 2001. "So when you tell him something,
he has to paint himself a picture after translating it to Russian."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks, off today, will play at San Jose on Friday and Chistov
is expected to open the game skating on a line with Steve Rucchin and
Petr Sykora.</TE>
<TE>   "The big thing about [Chistov] is not skill," Babcock said. "It's
about becoming a professional.... What I mean by that is the tenacity
on the puck and understanding what he's supposed to do. When you have
him on the first line and they go first, but he did not have a chance
to watch anyone perform the drill, that's not a good situation for
the kid. He screwed up the start of our practice today.</TE>
<TE>   "But yet in saying that, we have to be patient and understand that
we want skilled people in our lineup."</TE>
<TE>   Chistov, the fifth overall pick in 2001, is scoreless in two
exhibition games with four shots on goal and two penalty minutes.</TE>

<LD>Livan Hernandez pitched a two-hitter and Reggie Sanders homered
twice, and the streaking San Francisco Giants defeated the San Diego
Padres, 6-0, Wednesday night to maintain their lead in the National
League wild-card race.</LD>
<LD>   The Giants, who won their fifth in a row, remained three games
ahead of the Dodgers in the wild-card race.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco pulled within two games of NL West-leading Arizona.
The Giants play three games at home with Houston this weekend, and
also have a possible makeup game at Atlanta.</LD>
<TE>   Sanders hit a two-run homer just inside the left-field foul pole
in the third inning against Clay Condrey (1-2).</TE>
<TE>   Sanders hit his 23rd homer, a solo shot, in the fifth against
reliever Kevin Walker.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez (12-16) gave up a second-inning single to Phil Nevin and
a single to Mark Kotsay in the seventh on the way to his third
shutout this season and the fifth of his career.</TE>
<TE>   The right-hander has never lost to the Padres at Pacific Bell
Park, going 5-0 in seven starts.</TE>
<TE>   Giant third baseman David Bell made several great plays on the
night he was named the 2002 "Willie Mac" award winner, which is voted
on by the team for the most inspirational player. It was established
in 1980 in honor of Hall of Famer Willie McCovey.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 6, Arizona 1--Scott Rolen and J.D. Drew each hit
three-run homers to help the Cardinals beat Curt Schilling at St.
Louis.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals swept the three-game series and have won 18 of 21.
Arizona has lost a season-high six in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Schilling (23-7) struck out 12 and walked one in eight innings.</TE>
<TE>   The sweep left the Diamondbacks and Cardinals each with 94-64
records with four games remaining in the regular season. The teams
appear headed for a best-of-five, first-round playoff series, and the
team with the best record gets home-field advantage. If they remain
tied, the Cardinals get the nod based on their 4-2 season series
record against Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 7, Philadelphia 1--Andruw Jones hit three homers at
Philadelphia, then was left on deck before getting another chance to
bat.</TE>
<TE>   It was Jones' first three-homer game. He has five multiple-homer
games this season and three this month.</TE>
<TE>   The last Atlanta player to hit three homers in a game had been
Jeff Blauser against Chicago in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Damian Moss (12-6) gave up one run and five hits in 6 2/3 innings
to win for the sixth time in seven decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 7, Milwaukee 5--Daryle Ward homered twice, and
pinch-hitter Morgan Ensberg hit a tiebreaking single in the fifth
inning to rally the host Astros from a four-run deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Ensberg was the Astros' starting third baseman at the beginning of
the season, but batted only .236 and was sent to triple-A in early
June. He was called up this month and has gone two for three in
limited playing time.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 8, Chicago 2--The Reds, not Sammy Sosa, put on the home
run show, hitting four at Wrigley Field.</TE>
<TE>   Sosa remains stuck at 498 career homers. He was hitless in four
at-bats. Sosa needs two homers in the Cubs' last four games to become
the first player in major league history with five 50-homer seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Russell Branyan, Juan Castro, Kelly Stinnett and Todd Walker
homered for the Reds.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 4, New York 3--Aramis Ramirez hit a tiebreaking homer
at Pittsburgh and the Pirates held on for their sixth victory in the
last eight games.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Williams pitched a perfect ninth for his 46th save in 50
opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez, who was in a 3-for-45 slump, hit a 2-and-1 pitch from
reliever Grant Roberts (3-1) into the center-field seats in the sixth
inning.</TE>
<TE>   The Mets had tied the score, 3-3, in the top of the inning on a
home run by Mike Piazza, his 32nd, and a two-run drive by Edgardo
Alfonzo, his 16th.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 10, Montreal 2--Derek Lee had three hits and Ramon Castro
homered, and the Marlins took advantage of six errors at Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal's Vladimir Guerrero went hitless in two at-bats and
walked twice to remain one home run short of a 40-homer, 40-steal
season.</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Can't Identify With Being a Playoff Team</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the pretend world, the Dodgers speak bravely of a miracle finish,
of a tap dance to the finish, of a flurry of their wins and of Giant
losses, because, you know, it's not over, the numbers don't crunch
the Dodgers out yet, the wild card still beckons.</LD>
<LD>   In the real world, even a rousing bottom-of-the-ninth comeback win
over the Colorado Rockies only means the Dodgers linger barely alive
in the wild-card race with San Francisco. But not really.</LD>
<LD>   As the Dodgers wandered aimlessly through eight innings Wednesday,
and even after they rallied stunningly at the end to beat the Rockies
3-2, it was time to start wondering who the Dodgers want to be.</LD>
<TE>   The way baseball is now, there's nothing more important.</TE>
<TE>   Can you be the New York Yankees?</TE>
<TE>   Can you spend as much as you want when you want? Can you buy
whatever free agent you want, plus plug in, through trades, any good
player the other teams can't afford in the middle of the season?</TE>
<TE>   Or should you be the Oakland A's, the Angels, the Minnesota Twins?</TE>
<TE>   Should you quit worrying about the big, flashy trades or the
flamboyant free-agent signings and concentrate on unearthing little
gems like David Eckstein and producing your own pitching studs, your
own Jarrod Washburns or Mark Mulders?</TE>
<TE>   Do you invest in a great scouting staff and grow your own, as the
Atlanta Braves have done, and then commit to paying them, both scouts
and players, whatever salaries the market will give them? Or do you
grow your own, then give them up when you can't afford them and grow
some more, as the Twins have done?</TE>
<TE>   These Dodgers have no identity.</TE>
<TE>   They seem to be the worst combination of spending big, but not
quite big enough, of needing to go outside for help because there
isn't enough inside but not being quite able or willing to. They are
the poor-man's Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes that works. It has worked for the Arizona Diamondbacks.</TE>
<TE>   They went out and spent huge for two aging fastball pitchers.
Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling have been worth it, have been hardy,
healthy, impossibly amazing winners and for their money the
Diamondbacks have a World Series championship and will get the chance
to defend that title this season.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers spent huge for Kevin Brown and Darren Dreifort.
They've been physically fragile, totally unreliable and the Dodgers
have not made the playoffs with them. Johnson's back could have gone
bad. Schilling could have blown out an elbow. Brown could have been
the 23-game winner. Dreifort could have been the reliable No. 2
starter.</TE>
<TE>   Is that bad luck for the Dodgers or bad scouting, bad karma or bad
decisions?</TE>
<TE>   Dan Evans, the Dodger general manager, stood in the corner of the
dugout Wednesday. His manager, Jim Tracy, was on the field trying to
make happy talk, trying to convince someone to believe the Dodgers
had a reason to try hard.</TE>
<TE>   Words weren't enough for his team. Shawn Green seems unable to
muster the energy to look at more than three pitches, so he swings at
all of them. Eric Karros can't turn on a ball with his bat. Adrian
Beltre seems to be batting with his eyes closed, as if he's
visualizing himself on vacation already.</TE>
<TE>   It is what happens when your team has been climbing uphill all
season. They might not have been good enough if Brown and Dreifort
had been healthy pitchers. They certainly aren't good enough when
they aren't.</TE>
<TE>   When the Dodgers are officially eliminated from the playoff race,
don't blame anybody wearing a uniform, player or manager. They did
the best with what they had.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly," Evans says, "we squeezed every drop possible out of
this club as it is built now."</TE>
<TE>   So it is up to Evans to figure out what the Dodgers will be.</TE>
<TE>   Evans immediately speaks of his hiring of Bill Bavasi as director
of player development. He speaks passionately about Bavasi, the
former Angel general manager. "He is one of the most well-rounded,
intelligent people I know and he has made huge strides already in our
farm system," Evans says.</TE>
<TE>   Never, Evans says, did he even hint that the Dodgers would be able
to look to the farm system for help this season. There was not a
chance, he says, the Dodgers were going to be able to pull a starting
pitcher up to replace an injured Brown or Dreifort. The Angels did
that, bringing up John Lackey in the middle of a playoff race.
"That's what Bill did for the Angels," Evans says.</TE>
<TE>   So does Evans want the Dodgers to be more like the Angels than the
Yankees? It sounds like that. He says that although "there's nothing
wrong with signing free agents or making trades to use as a resource
or as an insurance policy, I believe in teams that are built on
scouting and player development."</TE>
<TE>   If this sounds as if he is endorsing the Angel way, Evans wouldn't
admit it. "I'm not trying to be like any organization," he says. "I'm
just looking to do things the way I believe in. Patience is rewarded
in this sport."</TE>
<TE>   It's a lot easier for the Angels to be patient. There are no great
expectations. The Angels can start 6-14 and there is no great call to
fire the manager or general manager or to make a trade.</TE>
<TE>   Evans will need a strong will and the strong backing of his
bosses. Building from the ground up does take patience. That patience
is rewarded, if you're right, if you win, if you find stars and
replacements for those stars. Right now the Dodgers don't have enough
stars or replacements. They aren't the Yankees. They aren't the
Angels. Who are they?</TE>

<KH>RYDER CUP Friday-Sunday at The Belfry</KH>
<HD>The European Plan</HD>
<DH>Underdogs have home-course advantage, but they'll need
Monty to be very good</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SUTTON COLDFIELD, England</DL>
<LD>It was the Good Monty who turned up at the Belfry ... the polite,
engaging, well-spoken minister of golf in Europe and a shining beacon
of happiness and good will.</LD>
<LD>   Good Monty is a lot different from Bad Monty, who also has shown
up on occasion.</LD>
<LD>   Bad Monty is surly, curt, sarcastic and thoroughly disagreeable.
Bad Monty is the one who threatened to pull out of a couple of
tournaments to protest his treatment by the media.</LD>
<TE>   Good Monty is the leader of the European Ryder Cup team, the
gracious ambassador of the game.</TE>
<TE>   And so it goes at the Ryder Cup, where the dual personalities of
Colin Montgomerie showcase a typically unremarkable European team
that many believe has a good chance to win back the Ryder Cup when
matches begin again Friday after an absence of three years.</TE>
<TE>   Montgomerie, 39, a Scot, is no longer the best player on Europe's
Ryder Cup team. That distinction belongs to 22-year-old Sergio Garcia
of Spain and 30-year-old Padraig Harrington of Ireland.</TE>
<TE>   But he is the player the rest are looking up to because of his
success in the mind-bending pressure of Ryder Cup competition.
Montgomerie has played a total of 23 matches. Bernhard Langer of
Germany has more experience, 38 matches, but it is Good Monty and all
he brings to the table who could earn the Ryder Cup a return trip to
Europe for the third time in the last four meetings.</TE>
<TE>   It's not even as if it's a secret.</TE>
<TE>   "He's obviously one of the strongest players," said Sam Torrance,
captain of the European team.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning with his Ryder Cup debut in 1991 at Kiawah, Montgomerie
is 12-7-4. And if you exclude his 2-3 record at Oak Hill in
Rochester, N.Y., in 1995, which was a victory for Europe anyway,
Montgomerie's record from the 1993, 1997 and 1999 matches is 9-3-3.
He has never lost in singles.</TE>
<TE>   He is rarely at a loss for words either, except for the occasions
he doesn't like the question. A simple roll of the eyes, a quick turn
and he exits. If Europe is to defeat a U.S. team that is slightly
favored, the mature Montgomerie with the skillful irons and the
smooth and silky putter is going to have to step forward and provide
the answers, not the questions.</TE>
<TE>   He sounds as if he is up to the task.</TE>
<TE>   "I just like match play," Montgomerie said. "I like the format and
I like the form of it and I tend to do quite well."</TE>
<TE>   And what of the genteel nature of the Ryder Cup that we seemingly
lost at the Country Club in Brookline, Mass., in 1999?</TE>
<TE>   "It is a game of golf, as I heard Tiger say here the other day;
it's not life and death here. And we do respect each other, and the
crowd hopefully will respect each other as well, and it will be a
good golfing event."</TE>
<TE>   Cue the orchestra, please.</TE>
<TE>   If he is a team leader, it is not in the team room.</TE>
<TE>   "I still feel I have that sort of on-course role," he said.
"Bernhard and myself would be seen as on-course leaders, I suppose.
It's a position that I like and thrive on."</TE>
<TE>   The players Montgomerie would be leading have a lot of work to do.</TE>
<TE>   Just who are these guys? Beginning Friday, we'll find out for
sure.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia is hardly an unknown, even though this is only his second
Ryder Cup. He was 3-1-1 at Brookline, he's ranked fourth in the
world, he's 3-0-1 teamed with Jesper Parnevik and seems on the brink
of superstardom.</TE>
<TE>   Harrington is 31 and made his Ryder Cup debut at Brookline. He was
at his best this year in big events--tie for fifth at the Masters,
tie for eighth at the U.S. Open and a tie for fifth at the British
Open. He hasn't won on the European tour this year, but he has seven
top-10 finishes in 18 tournaments. Bothered by ankle and neck
injuries, Harrington says he's feeling all right.</TE>
<TE>   His playing partner in the practice rounds was Niclas Fasth, a
30-year-old Swede who has had one top-10 since July. One of four
Ryder Cup rookies on the European team, Fasth is an up-and-comer very
highly regarded for his mental toughness.</TE>
<TE>   Torrance put Fasth in a practice pairing with Pierre Fulke, 31,
another Ryder Cup rookie who is a good putter but not a long hitter.</TE>
<TE>   Darren Clarke, the 34-year-old from Northern Ireland, is usually
Lee Westwood's partner, but it was Montgomerie who played two
practice rounds with Westwood. Both Clarke and Westwood, the
29-year-old from England, are huge question marks because of their
inconsistent play.</TE>
<TE>   Montgomerie says he's looking forward to helping lead Westwood out
of the woods.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't take Einstein to work out that there's a possibility I
might be playing with him. Great," Montgomerie said. "I think Lee has
never suffered through lack of nerves or emotion; it's just that he's
lost his swing a little bit over the last couple of years and has a
confidence thing."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Bjorn, 31, has been living off the fact that he beat Tiger
Woods two years ago at Dubai and wasn't playing well until he won the
BMW International in Germany three weeks ago. He is the first Dane to
play in the Ryder Cup. His reaction: "Great."</TE>
<TE>   Phillip Price, 35, of Wales has played poorly, but he's a Ryder
Cup rookie, so he probably shouldn't be expected to shoulder a lot of
the load. At least he's getting some help. He has been working with a
sports psychologist for 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Torrance's fourth rookie is Paul McGinley, 35, of Ireland, who has
missed seven cuts on the European Tour this year. His two best
tournaments since he missed the cut at the U.S. Open are a tie for
14th in July at the Scottish Open and a tie for sixth in August at
the Celtic Manor Wales.</TE>
<TE>   Langer, 45, has nothing but experience and one of the best
long-iron games around. He can play with anybody--and has. He has had
12 partners in his nine appearances.</TE>
<TE>   Parnevik, 37, is 4-2-3 in two previous Ryder Cups and was a
captain's pick. If Torrance had to do it over again, he probably
wouldn't. Parnevik hasn't been better than 17th since before the U.S.
Open and he has missed three cuts and withdrawn once since then.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, how much does it matter to be playing well right now?</TE>
<TE>   Not much, according to Montgomerie.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what it's all about is on the first tee on Friday," he
said. "I think form goes out the window and it's all about who can
handle one's self come Friday."</TE>
<TE>   Well said. Now, that's a Good Monty.</TE>

<HD>Cameron Keeps Mariners in Mix</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Mike Cameron hit a two-run homer in the eighth inning and the Seattle
Mariners once again rallied to stave off elimination, beating
Oakland, 3-2, Wednesday night and preventing the Athletics from
winning the American League West.</LD>
<LD>   With four games left, the Mariners (92-66) still have a chance to
catch the Angels (96-62) in the wild-card chase. The Angels lost at
Texas, 4-3.</LD>
<LD>   Seattle won its fourth in a row. On Tuesday night, the Mariners
scored four times in the eighth to overcome Oakland, 8-7.</LD>
<TE>   Cameron hit his 24th homer with one out after a single by Bret
Boone against Jim Mecir (6-4).</TE>
<TE>   Ricardo Rincon replaced Tim Hudson and struck out John Olerud.
Mecir replaced Rincon and gave up the single to Boone.</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Rhodes (10-4) got the victory, with Kazuhiro Sasaki getting
two out for his 37th save in 44 opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Hudson outpitched Jamie Moyer before leaving after making 92
pitches.</TE>
<TE>   In seven innings, Hudson gave up a run and eight hits, walked one
and had three strikeouts. He hit a batter.</TE>
<TE>   Moyer went seven innings and gave up two runs and six hits. He
walked one and struck out four.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Hatteberg hit a two-run homer for Oakland in the third
inning.</TE>
<TE>   The A's took a 2-0 lead in the third when Ramon Hernandez opened
with a single and Hatteberg homered to center. It was his 15th homer.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners scored in the fifth when rookie Willie Bloomquist
singled, stole second, went to third on catcher Hernandez's throwing
error and Olerud's single.</TE>
<TE>   Hatteberg and Boone each had three hits.</TE>

<LD>So I called Mike's office and got his secretary, told her I wanted to
congratulate the big cheese on making the Angels a playoff team by
quashing the preseason trade of Darin Erstad, and I'd wait on the
phone while she got Mike.</LD>
<LD>   Right away I got a rebuke from this exasperated lady, who said if
I wanted to talk with Michael Eisner, I should never call him at his
office.</LD>
<LD>   I wasn't surprised, of course, because if you call sports editor
Bill Dwyre, you don't call him at the office, you call him on his
cell. And usually he'll stop playing golf long enough to chat. So I
offered the secretary Dwyre's cell number in exchange for Eisner's.</LD>
<TE>   "You'll need to go through Xena," the exasperated lady said, and
while I had no idea the "Warrior Princess" had become a bouncer for
Disney, it could have been worse: She could have transferred me to
Goofy or the Ducks' general manager.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I JUST wanted to congratulate Mike on making a good decision. It's
probably been years since that happened based on how Disney stock is
doing. I also thought praise had been misplaced a few days ago when
one of our reporters gushed about the expertise of GM Bill
Stoneman--when it was Mike who saved the team.</TE>
<TE>   Stoneman is the whiz who had a handshake agreement to trade
Erstad, the Angels' heart and soul, to the White Sox for a bunch of
stiffs. He'd have ruined the Angels' year, but according to news
reports at the time, Mike canceled the deal.</TE>
<TE>   I know you wouldn't expect a good decision from someone who gave
the approval for California Adventure, but if I'm going to go out of
my way to criticize, then I should do the same to congratulate. I
told that to Mike's secretary, and she acted as if she couldn't wait
to get rid of me.</TE>
<TE>   "Did we ever date in college?" I said, but I'm not sure she heard
me, because she had already transferred me to the Warrior Princess.</TE>
<TE>   "Hi, this is Paul," and let me guess, if you want to talk to Xena,
you should never call her office.</TE>
<TE>   I explained to Paul that I was on a mission to praise Mike for
keeping Erstad and Paul said, "Who is Erstad?"</TE>
<TE>   "A Disney employee like yourself," I said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are only a couple of hundred thousand Disney employees,"
Paul huffed. "This is corporate communications; I don't know who you
are talking about."</TE>
<TE>   I would imagine corporate communications at Disney has to be a
tough job when you're trying to communicate with people, and it is
company policy you can't contact the person you want to communicate
with in their office.</TE>
<TE>   "You are not allowed to call Eisner directly; you have to go
through Xena," Paul said, and I was surprised how committed Disney is
about promoting the Warrior Princess. You would think if Disney put
that much effort into some of its own ABC-TV shows, someone might
watch them.</TE>
<TE>   Paul said he'd tell Xena I called; he promised he'd get back to me
before the end of the day. It's almost midnight, and I fear now the
evil Mephistopheles waylaid Paul and I'll never hear from Xena. Or,
Paul just fibbed about getting back to me.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I CALLED Michael Ovitz's office to see if he had an old cell phone
number for Eisner, but for some reason he never called back.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I CALLED Tim Mead, the Angels' vice president in charge of
something or other, and asked for Eisner's cell phone number and he
laughed. He said he would get back to me. I told him to look out for
Mephistopheles.</TE>
<TE>   He called back. He said when the Angels considered trading Erstad
to Chicago, there was a meeting, and Disney lieutenant Paul Pressler
asked everyone to rethink their position. As a result, the trade
didn't take place.</TE>
<TE>   "It never went as far as [Eisner]," Mead said.</TE>
<TE>   And all this time I thought Mike had made a good decision--only to
discover now it still hasn't happened. Maybe that's why Paul didn't
call back; he already knew Mike was incapable of making a good
decision.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THERE WAS a note attached to my clothes when I picked them up:
"Best wishes from your friends at Norton's Cleaners." Inside I found
a crimson and gold "SC" sticker for my car. And they said they were
my friends.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ESPN MAGAZINE reporter Tom Friend wrote about USC running back
Justin Fargas' admiration for O.J. Simpson recently. Fargas, expected
to see considerable playing time against Oregon State, called Simpson
and asked if he could wear No. 32 in his honor. I'd have probably
wanted to ask Simpson one more question.</TE>
<TE>   Fargas got Simpson's approval, and then went to Coach Pete
Carroll, who said, "Can't you wear Marcus Allen's [33] instead?"
Fargas is presently wearing No. 25.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ROCKY TALAVERA brought his 1-year-old daughter, Mary, to Dodger
Stadium for the first time in her life, and Dad did good, getting Tom
Lasorda to pose for a picture with his child to commemorate the
occasion. I imagine this will also be the youngster's first
recollection of sitting in Santa's lap.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE DODGERS played Wednesday night, but if they've given up, I've
given up. Before the game they delivered their concession speech with
the release of their 2003 schedule. How much clearer can they make
it? Just wait until next year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from E.S.:</TE>
<TE>   "Next Tuesday Mike Garrett will be the guest speaker at the
Glendale YMCA Quarterback Club. How awesome would it be if you showed
up and asked him a question? The place would be in absolute shock."</TE>
<TE>   And when Garrett goes running and screaming from the room, who
takes his place as speaker?</TE>

<LD>European champion Real Madrid, English champion Arsenal and Spanish
champion Valencia each kept their Champions League record perfect
Wednesday with convincing victories.</LD>
<LD>   Real Madrid, despite being without injured World Cup-winning stars
Zinedine Zidane and Ronaldo, overwhelmed Genk of Belgium, 6-0, in
front of 60,000 at Santiago Bernabeu Stadium in Madrid.</LD>
<LD>   The Belgian team held its own for 43 minutes, then gave up two
goals before halftime and four more in the second 45 minutes.</LD>
<TE>   "We could never compete with the individual talent of the Real
players," Genk Coach Sef Vergoossen said.</TE>
<TE>   Arsenal, which "did the double" last season by winning the English
Premier League and the F.A. Cup, was even more impressive, shutting
out PSV Eindhoven of the Netherlands, 4-0, on the road.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil World Cup winner Gilberto Silva, a recent acquisition,
scored the fastest goal in the 10-year history of the Champions
League, and one of the fastest ever in European competition, by
putting Arsenal ahead a mere 20.07 seconds into the game.</TE>
<TE>   A goal by Sweden's Fredrik Ljungberg and two more by Frenchman
Thierry Henry completed the rout over the Dutch team coached by Guus
Hiddink.</TE>
<TE>   Equally noteworthy was Valencia's 3-0 drubbing of Spartak Moscow
in Russia, where Miguel Angel Angulo, Mista and Juan Sanchez each
scored.</TE>
<TE>   Viktor Samokhin, Spartak's assistant coach, afterward lambasted
the Russian champions, who have not won a Champions League match in
two years, a 13-game stretch.</TE>
<TE>   "I just have no words to describe our performance tonight," he
said. "Never in the whole history of Russian football have we
witnessed such a lackluster performance by our team."</TE>
<TE>   In other games Wednesday, four-time European champion Liverpool
was held to a 1-1 tie at home by Basel of Switzerland; AEK Athens and
AS Roma played to a scoreless tie in Greece, and Inter Milan managed
a 1-0 victory in Italy over Dutch champion Ajax Amsterdam, courtesy
of a goal by Argentina's Hernan Crespo.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, French champion Olympique Lyon trounced Norwegian
champion Rosenborg Trondheim, 5-0, in Lyon, and German champion
Borussia Dortmund edged Auxerre of France, 2-1, in Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Only six of the 32 Champions League teams remain unbeaten and
untied two games into the 2002-2003 tournament: Real Madrid, Arsenal,
Valencia, Manchester United, AC Milan and Barcelona.</TE>
<TE>   Old Ball Gets $51,210</TE>
<TE>   The ball used in the 1888 English F.A. Cup final between West
Bromwich Albion and Preston North End was bought by an anonymous
buyer for $51,210 at an auction in London on Tuesday but was not the
most expensive soccer item sold.</TE>
<TE>   That honor went to the Copa Italia trophy won by Torino in 1943,
which was bought from Christie's by a representative of the Italian
club for $73,150.</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo's Wife Signs</TE>
<TE>   Real Madrid might have snapped up Ronaldo for $46.3 million, but a
less-fashionable club in the same Spanish city has achieved a coup of
sorts by signing the Brazilian star's wife.</TE>
<TE>   Rayo Vallecano announced that it had signed Milene Domingues, 22,
to a contract through the end of the season to play for its women's
team.</TE>

<LD>Guard Brian Morrison, a basketball transfer from North Carolina,
withdrew from UCLA Wednesday and is expected to enroll at Washington,
sources said.</LD>
<LD>   Morrison must sit out the 2002-03 season under NCAA transfer rules
because he left North Carolina. He was expected to be a key addition
to the Bruins in 2003-04 and 2004-05.</LD>
<LD>   Morrison, who grew up in Redmond, Wash., indicated to UCLA players
that he plans to enroll at Washington, which begins fall classes
Monday.</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman with the Huskies would not comment.</TE>
<TE>   The loss of Morrison, who led North Carolina with 42 three-point
baskets last season, is another in a series of blows to the Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman forward Evan Burns, UCLA's most highly touted player in
several years, could not meet academic standards and enrolled at San
Diego State two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore forward Andre Patterson is ineligible for the fall
quarter and will miss at least four games. He is awaiting summer
school grades and attending Santa Monica College this fall in an
effort to gain eligibility for the winter.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly flush with scholarships to give, UCLA is recruiting three
local high school seniors--forward Trevor Ariza of Westchester, guard
Omar Wilkes of Loyola and forward Sean Phaler of Villa Park.</TE>

<LD>Vagabond quarterbacks need not contact UCLA.</LD>
<LD>   That's the message from Coach Bob Toledo, who expressed no
interest in Craig Ochs this week despite recruiting him out of high
school. Ochs, a sophomore, left Colorado and was reportedly shopping
around the Pacific 10 Conference before settling on Division I-AA
Montana on Wednesday so that he is assured of being eligible next
season.</LD>
<LD>   Last year Toledo spurned overtures from Brandon Hance, who left
Purdue and wanted to transfer to either UCLA or USC. He ended up with
the Trojans.</LD>
<TE>   And in 2000, Toledo rebuffed Adam Hall, a transfer from Texas who
ended up at San Diego State, UCLA's opponent Saturday. Hall is second
in the nation with 1,621 passing yards, but Toledo is having no
second thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pleased with what I've got," he said. "I didn't want somebody
transferring in."</TE>
<TE>   Toledo is content with Drew Olson, Matt Moore and John Sciarra,
all of whom will be sophomores next season. He didn't want Hall's
presence to discourage Olson or Moore from signing with the Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cornerback Joe Hunter has done a solid job on pass coverage. But
even on the rare occasion a receiver beats him to the ball, Hunter
doesn't feel like he was burned.</TE>
<TE>   He has seen first-hand what getting burned really means.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter, a senior honor student, is serving an internship with the
Los Angeles Fire Department station on Veteran Avenue in Westwood. He
likes it so much he has changed his career goal from broadcasting to
firefighter.</TE>
<TE>   "I love helping people," Hunter said. "I'm getting paramedic
training. This is what I want to do."</TE>
<TE>   About 15 of Hunter's co-workers at the station plan to attend
UCLA's Oct. 26 game against Stanford at the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "They are great guys," he said. "They've helped me out a lot."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Remarkably, three games into the season and coming off a physical
game against Colorado, UCLA is free of injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Linebacker Patrick Pierre-Louis (dislocated shoulder) and tight
end Keith Carter (high ankle sprain), the only players who missed
last Saturday's game, have returned to practice.</TE>

<HD>Trojans Have Hit in Opening Act Put On by Colbert</HD>
<DH>USC: He is not the Trojans' fastest or tallest receiver,
but he is their most versatile and sure-handed one.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carson Palmer knew Keary Colbert was reliable even before they became
teammates at USC.</LD>
<LD>   Palmer, a fifth-year senior, attended numerous quarterback camps
and passing sessions during his first two years in college. Almost
everywhere he went, it seemed, a certain high school receiver from
Oxnard was on the field running pass patterns.</LD>
<LD>   "He was just one of those guys who was always working out, wanting
to catch balls," Palmer said. "I don't know how he found out about
them, but he was there every time. You could always count on him."</LD>
<TE>   Palmer, a fifth-year senior, still does.</TE>
<TE>   Senior wide receiver Kareem Kelly is faster, and freshman wide
receiver Mike Williams is rangier and can jump higher. But Colbert, a
6-foot-1, 205-pound junior flanker, is regarded as the most versatile
and sure-handed member of the Trojan receiving corps.</TE>
<TE>   Last week against Kansas State, Colbert caught 11 passes for 125
yards--both career bests. He leads the No. 18 Trojans with 17
receptions for 200 yards, averaging 11.8 yards per catch.</TE>
<TE>   "He's our steady, reliable guy," offensive coordinator Norm Chow
said. "Other guys have to run deeper routes. Keary runs this, runs
that, comes underneath--he does a good job with everything because
he's smart."</TE>
<TE>   Colbert, a sociology major, was an honor student at Oxnard Hueneme
High. But he said it doesn't take a genius to figure out how to
flourish in the Trojans' passing game.</TE>
<TE>   "The offense is set up where it's not one guy," Colbert said.
"Everybody has the same opportunity to do the same things. The key is
to be versatile."</TE>
<TE>   Colbert learned to make the most of opportunities while playing in
a run-oriented offense in high school.</TE>
<TE>   He caught only 25 passes but turned 10 of them into touchdowns and
averaged 24 yards per reception.</TE>
<TE>   "There were guys out there at other schools getting 60 and 70
catches," Colbert said. "I just worked hard. People still noticed
me."</TE>
<TE>   Colbert made an immediate impression when he arrived at USC. He
played in 12 games, started five and wound up second on the team with
33 receptions for 480 yards and three touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second-highest reception total by a true freshman in
school history behind Kelly's 54 catches in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like I could play, but I didn't come in expecting to play
right away," Colbert said. "I just wanted to contribute and see where
I fit in."</TE>
<TE>   Last season, under first-year Coach Pete Carroll and Chow, Colbert
caught 34 passes for 442 yards and two touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to clean up some of the mistakes I made as a freshman
and I think I did that for the most part," Colbert said. "I'm still
learning, though."</TE>
<TE>   The game against Kansas State provided a tough lesson.</TE>
<TE>   USC receivers dropped eight passes in a 27-20 loss before a
frenzied sellout crowd at Manhattan, Kan. Colbert scored on a
five-yard touchdown pass that brought the Trojans to within 27-13
with 10:03 left. But he dropped two passes and he and Palmer read the
defense differently on the Trojans' final offensive play, a
fourth-and-15 at the Kansas State 38-yard line with 26 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer's pass sailed downfield and fell incomplete. Kansas State
ran out the clock to secure the victory.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to sit here and lie and say I don't think about
that play, but it's not a burden like it would have been when I was
younger," Colbert said. "It's over and I'm getting ready for the next
game."</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans begin Pacific 10 Conference play Saturday against No.
23 Oregon State at the Coliseum. Last year, Colbert caught one pass
for seven yards--both season lows--in a 16-13 overtime victory over
the Beavers.</TE>
<TE>   Colbert is anticipating a busy afternoon this time.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about getting better," he said. "Every day, every game,
every season.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if I'll have as many catches this week. But I'll be
working to get open. If I am, Carson will find me."</TE>

<HD>Wilson Shrugs Off 'Worst Game Ever'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Senior guard Zach Wilson made his first start of the season, and 30th
of his USC career, in the loss to Kansas State last week.</LD>
<LD>   Wilson thought it was noteworthy, though not worth celebrating.</LD>
<LD>   "I was getting killed," he said Wednesday. "That was my worst game
ever."</LD>
<TE>   Wilson is confident that he will redeem himself Saturday when the
No. 18 Trojans play No. 23 Oregon State in their Pacific 10
Conference opener at the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson injured his left foot on the first day of training camp and
did not return to practice until the week before the Trojans' Sept.
14 game at Colorado. He played three series at the end of the 40-3
victory and was installed in the starting lineup at right guard
against Kansas State.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I was ready, but I hadn't done anything for five weeks
and it showed," Wilson said. "I'm feeling better this week. I'll be
ready to go."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Pete Carroll said senior tailback Sultan McCullough
appears to be thriving on competition from senior Justin Fargas, who
is participating in all drills at full speed for the first time since
training camp.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the best Sultan has ever practiced since I've been here,"
said Carroll, in his second season with the Trojans. "It's a good
setting right now. Neither one wants to take a back seat, so we'll
just let them loose and see how they do."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The competition between kickers David Davis and Ryan Killeen is
adding a dose of drama to practices.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who struggled the last two games, made all three of his
field-goal attempts, the last from 42 yards. Killeen made two of
three attempts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With Ronald Nunn out for the rest of the season because of a knee
injury, safety John Walker worked some at left cornerback.</TE>
<TE>   Redshirt William Buchanon, who replaced Nunn after he was injured
against Kansas State, appears on track to start against Oregon State,
but Justin Wyatt and Marcell Allmond could also play.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC's receiving corps might be thin against Oregon State. Jason
Mitchell sat out again because of back soreness but said he will try
to return today. Grant Mattos sat out again because of a strained
abdominal muscle.</TE>
